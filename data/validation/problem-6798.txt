At first they didn’t speak, they just fell into each-others arms and held one another tight, letting their bodies reassure their senses that yes, they were both alive, they had come through this and it was all over with.
Tony let out a choked noise that was somewhere between a sob and a hysterical laugh, “He thinks its all an adventure. He’s not aware of how close he came to dying, at least I hope…” He inhaled sharply, “I saw him Steve, Killian showed me my Son strapped to a fucking gurney while liquid fire was burning inside him. I fucking saw him writhing in agony and I couldn’t do a shitting thing to save him!”
“Spy Lady brought Birdy Man and offer man to see you, Mamma.” Zach informed him, wriggling down from Natasha and running over to get picked up by Tony.
Steve got Peter lifting various weights in the gym, they started with just 3 K which anyone could lift and gradually increased the weights until Peter was lifting 400lb with no difficulty.
While on the road Tony looked through the file that he’d gotten from Mrs Davies swiftly learning of A.I.M,s involvement in all of this and recalled that A.I.M had been used to make the adjustments on the War Machine suit recently. Making use of the fake agents phone and dialled Rhodey to get all the info the military currently had on the Mandarin, he also asked for Rhodey’s password so he could give it to Harley and the kid could search through the files while he drove.
“He might be a while.” He said sitting down, Zach rarely threw a tantrum but when he did it tended to take a while to calm him down and Tony would probably stay with him most of the evening as the result.
Peter was allowed home three days after Steve’s interview. For this alone, MJ and Ned’s parents allowed the two out of their grounding lock down and took them to the Tower to see Peter and share in his homecoming party which the team had put together for him.
Tony’s eyes narrowed, “Call my Son a brat again and I will be facing criminal charges for ripping your tongue from your head.”
Thor was besides him, also watching, “He’s not slowing down.” The Thunder God said spinning Mjolnir ready to take to their, but suddenly Hulk was leaping up to catch the Iron Man and bring him safely down to the ground.
Natasha opened her mouth to reply to that, but Roger’s cut her off, “We’re not here for that. We’re here for Bucky.”
“And no hanging out with friends for all that time.” Mrs Watson continued. “You will only leave your bedroom to go to school, use the bathroom, and for meals. Do you understand me?”
Steve swallowed hard, “You’re not,” He said, “But there is something wrong,” he pulled Tony into an embrace, pressing Tony’s head against his chest, “We’ll figure it out together, I promise.”
An argument had ensued, Tony’s pride and desire to keep on punishing himself preventing him from giving in to Steve. They had stood there for several minutes, Tony getting angrier and more agitated until finally he’d tried to shove past Steve, resulting in his getting picked up from the ground and carried to bed, with Steve ignoring all of his protests and depositing him on his bed, determinedly pinning him down when he’d tried to struggle to get back up and demanded to know why Tony was so set on destroying himself.
“Incredible.” Bruce said, “But then a spider can lift 170x their own bodyweight, so, if we work on the theory that your mutation has given you the abilities of an arachnid, you will be able to lift 170x more than your own bodyweight.”
“Comic Books?” Tony asked, a grin over his face, “You got named from the comic?” his eyes were dancing with amusement that Steve knew was going to be giving him a hell of a lot of shit over this.
“I’d ask how you are but I think I can guess.” The Omega said, grabbing a second cup and putting a tea bag into it, “Get the honey from the cupboard will you?”
Half of America’s social elite were present and the Avengers felt every eye in the room fall on them as they entered the room.
“Too big since I’ve got to invite Weed Richards.” Tony said with a sneer, “And I swear if Victor Von Dumbfuck attacks our wedding because Reed Dick is there….”
“I’ll land and join you.” Clint yelled as he took off back into the air going and setting down the jet a little way off, and took Steve’s motor bike back to the base, pushing it at full speed and leaped off the back sending it into a couple of Hydra soldiers as he caught a branch swung up into the trees, getting the high ground from where he began to take out the soldiers with his arrows.
“And make sure to get lots of sun-screen.” Tony added, “And after-sun for anyone who does get burnt.”
“He won’t, he likes you, you’re his Science Bro.” Zach happily chirruped, oblivious to how Bruce’s cheek’s reddened at the nickname. Zach frowned and tilted his head as he looked at Bruce. “You’re real smart aren’t you, like Mamma?”
Gulping in air and sniffing hard as he tried to get his emotions under control Peter looked from Tony to Steve, “How? Will I have to leave school?” Part of him wouldn’t miss school, he always learned more with Tony anyway, but he would miss Ned and MJ, and he didn’t want Tony and Steve to have to go through the trouble of finding him another school or home educating him.
“Okay.” Peter agreed, it would mean he wouldn’t have go out of his window again, at least not then, but he would likely have to do so plenty of other times. Who knew being a superhero could be so difficult?
“You have nothing to be sorry for sweetheart.” Steve said, kissing his hair, “We take care of each other right?”
“Blow me tin can!” Clint replied, flipping him off, and took Lily with the practised ease of a parent, “Hey there sweetie, we’re gonna have big fun while Mommy and Daddy are out on a date aren’t we?” he cooed to her,
“Why?” Steve asked, sounding equal parts angry and frightened, “Why would you do that?” he demanded, he grabbed hold of Tony by the shoulders, turning him around so he was facing him, “Why would you throw your life away like that?”
“I am Peter I will always be proud of you.” Tony said, sniffing back tears of his own and rubbed Peter’s back, “You aren’t bad, you are just confused. You’re going through puberty and trying to deal with being enhanced on top of that.”
There was also the frustration of not being able to fix things for Peter, to not have any kind of resolution in sight. This was all trial and error and as it was affecting his Son Tony was naturally more frustrated and worried than he would under other circumstances.
“To bed.” Steve said, cutting Tony off before he could say he was going to the lab, he also wrapped an arm about Tony’s shoulder to ensure he couldn’t bolt there and lock himself and disappear into a work binge.
“Oh yeah,” Tony stepped away from Steve and grabbed the kitchen roll to finished wiping foam out of his hair, “Its upper state New York, just an old storage factory but with enough land around it for expansion.”
“Right.” Tony said, exhaling loudly, “Instead of hanging myself, I will be in my lab building myself a chastity belt out of adamantium!”
“No, that’s great, thank you.” Steve said already planning to have Jarvis search New York for restaurants that were family run so he could look at them and any reviews they had.
While they could not actually see his face, both Tony and Steve could tell that Deadpool was smiling beneath his mask, as he leered at Tony, apparently indifferent to the glares that the Billionaire was giving him.
“That does not excuse plot holes that are as wide as the grand canyon and a blatant disregard of the laws of physics.” Tony said.
“Has he been giving you any trouble in school?” Steve asked letting Norman go first. It wasn’t worth starting an argument over.
Sadly it didn’t turn out as he had hoped as the Son of one of Howard’s Friends/enemies/what the fuck ever, showed up sporting his own version of an arc reactor looking to get a pound of flesh in revenge for his Father, even though it was Howard who’d screwed the guy over, not Tony.
“You don’t get to talk about my Aunt, Stark.” Sharon snapped at the Billionaire, “Not when you haven’t visited her in five years.”
Once everyone was watered and rested they set off again, cutting through the jungle where he grew denser as no footpath had been worn into it. This was great fun for Zach and Peter as they got to climb over trees and roots and help Steve find the way through to the other side of the jungle where they came out on the cliffs again.
“Will you come with us?” Tony asked Steve. This was Steve’s first winter since waking up. So far, he’d been handling it pretty well. He had still been going out for his runs, up until the snow fall had made that impossible, he had, however suffered a few nightmares since the weather had turned so brutally cold.
Steve sighed heavily. “Both of them are very sensitive and thoughtful boys, who put themselves out for the good of others. Peter decided to use his abilities to help others, that was what he wanted to do, he could have chosen to use those abilities for the wrong reasons, to hurt people, to commit crimes, but he didn’t, he chose to stop muggings, drugs deals, and assaults. He was helping people, saving people, but he didn’t realize the danger he was placing himself in, as children often don’t, as such rationality comes with age and experience.”
“You gotta ess’plain to me why Mamma wont tell Steef that he likes him.” Zach said drawing Bruce’s attention back to him.
“I was gonna,” Tony said, “But you’re up now, and this…,” He winced as one of the yokes broke, “May not be that good.”
Thor had not taken Zach far from the hospital, he took him to the nearest fountain and slowly lowered them both down into the water which bubbled and hissed at the heat coming from Zach.
The next thing Tony knew, some kind of projectile was whizzing past him and he found himself face to face with a young but rather undersized and skinny Alpha.
“You didn’t think you were getting away that easily did you, Stark?” He called casually strolling through his burning factory and igniting products as he went causing more fires and explosions until the other end of the catwalk was cut off too leaving Tony in the centre with no where to go but a fifteen foot drop with debris on fire to cushion his fall.
Clint burst out laughing while Tony gaped at his son in utter shock at the treachery there. “I love this kid.” Clint declared, ruffling Zach’s hair.
“Uh-huh. I went into Mamma’s bedroom and I saw Mamma on top of Daddy, and he was pinning him to the bed with his arms about his head.” Zach looked up at Thor, “Mamma was bouncing on Daddy too, but it didn’t sound like it was hurting Daddy.”
Bucky chose to remain with Tony and Steve and to join the Avengers, having found himself a home with them and formed friendships with the team, (Even Deadpool, although he frequently threatened to strangle Wade to death.)
“You are not him, the real Mandarin.” Tony said, stating the obvious; this moron couldn’t fix a light bulb without screwing up he certainly couldn’t be the head of a major terrorist organisation. “Where is he?” He demanded of the idiot.
Norman was seething as he was finally allowed out of the police station. He’d been questioned for hours before his lawyer had finally gotten him released, and he was still ordered to remain in New York and make himself available to answer further questioning.
At least he’d been allowed to have his friend Rhodey in attendance, otherwise he’d have had no one but Obie and his Parents socialite friends and business associates. Tony had gone through the whole ceremony feeling sick to his stomach. Since Ty he hadn’t wanted and Alpha near him, but now he had no choice, his heat was approaching and the marriage had to be consummated.
“Why can’t the Fuckwit Four ever be present with Victor Von Dumbfuck decides to attack New York?” Tony countered, blowing another bot out of the sky and zooming towards three more that were trying to get the jump on Natasha. As they exploded behind her she turned and inclined her head in acknowledgment.
“Crazy.” Tony declared, moving from the shade to the sun and stretched out, his olive skin was already darkening with the sunlight and he was determined to enjoy it for as long as he could.
He went straight to his office when he got home, and took a spare mobile from his safe, sure enough there was a voice mail alert on the phone. This was just a pay as you go mobile, cheap and untraceable. Norman couldn’t exactly have Curien calling his main phone.
“And I am afraid, Mr Osborn. Your Son’s admission to hitting Miss Watson does change matter’s.” One of the school board said, “As Mr Parker Stark, while being overzealous, was defending a friend from an attacker, something that most people would do.”
“Your bitch fake Mom is fucking my life up.” Harry snarled at Peter, “My Dad’s having deal with tons of shit because you fucked up on the field trip.”
“Unlike you who just depletes the coffee supplies.” Steve shot back. He topped a couple of bagels for Tony, one with cream cheese and ham, the other with Nutella and set them on a plate before the Billionaire. “Eat.” He instructed.
“Tony…Peter and Tony, Jarvis are they okay?” Steve asked tapping his ear piece. He met Natasha’s eyes worriedly, she was battered and bruised, had a bloody wound on her forehead and soot smudged beneath her nose.
"Tell her not to give him any details." Tony said his voice hoarse, "Just tell him Peter's sick, nothing else."
Sharon glared back at him, “I am working, I am continuing my aunt’s legacy, protecting the free world, not destroying it like some people.”
The diseases of Steve’s youth had been all but wiped out, people were immunized against them, there were even treatments for cancer that actually worked, organ transplants, embryos conceived in test tubes and then implanted in wombs.
“And I’ll go and put some coffee on.” Tony said still looking half asleep, he wished Peter a merry Christmas as he headed to the bathroom to wash his face, brush his teeth, and empty his bladder, wishing that Zach’s body clock wasn’t set on waking at the crack of dawn.
Pushing open the door Tony went into the bedroom and found Zach on his bed his face buried in his pillows his little body trembling as he cried into them.
Clint mouthed a LATER at Tony who winked at him and patted Zach to hold onto him as he wheeled himself further into the apartment.
Despite his unorthodox addition to the team Spider-Man, AKA Peter Parker was a very welcome member of the new team of allies they were building.
“We understand M.S Potts, thank you for being so understanding given the circumstances.” Mr Leeds said.
“Hell no, having one child on the ceiling is bad enough I’m not having two up there.” Tony stated, relieved when his suit finally arrived and he could fly up to Peter.
“Great.” Tony said, looking around, “You are never baby sitting again, and you!” He pointed an accusing finger at Rhodey who was trying to be invisible as he cleaned up cracked eggs, “I trusted you to be the sane one, to be the actual adult here, what the fu…. Fumble happened?”
Clint chewed on his bottom lip, “If there is no discussion of my family brought up. Or our past missions.” Natasha hummed her agreement at that.
“I thought he was dead.” Steve whispered, “Everyone did. The fall, it was so far, there was no way,” he gazed at Tony pleading for something, reassurance, hope, comfort, something to ground him and keep him from spinning out of control. “He can’t have survived, that fall would have shattered every bone in his body.”
“I think we’re pretty much agreed we’re doing this.” Tony said once he’d stopped laughing, “J, launch the cleaner bots in the villa and order groceries for us, we’ll fly out Thursday evening, clear my schedule until Monday Morning.”
“You will get a handle on this Pete, we will help you.” Steve assured him, “You can come to the gym with me, get some aggression out on punching bags, learn to hone your senses.”
Sometimes Peter would join in, using his gangly growing limbs to cling onto Steve’s back and hang off his shoulders, helping his brother to pull Steve to the ground and pound him with pillows.
“Come on Stellina, that’s enough of that.” Tony said sitting down on the bed and placed his hand on Zach’s back.
Was he? Tony realized he was and shrugged, “Well that’s what pregnant people do, Pep.” He said, “And as for what I want to do, I want to clear out the room next to mine and start making a nursery. I’m gonna have this Pup and be the best damn Mamma I can be.”
He hated Pietro for shooting and crippling Tony, but Wanda….he was going to kill her, screw neutralizing her powers, he was going to kill the bitch for what she had done and was still doing to his Omega.
This did have Grace worrying about parents calling her about broken windows when potatoes were fired at them, but really she was happy that her son was making friends at last and the bullies were leaving him alone.
The bantering continued over breakfast and Tony woke up a bit more with fuel in his system and called Jarvis to find out what was happening.
“Yeah, so my guess would be that he was just paid off to lie on the death certificate and Hydra dealt with the loose end after the funeral had taken place and any investigation had been wrapped up.”
“It does sometimes go that way.” May said, “The baby must have been at the back of the womb, so there wouldn’t have been much of a bump, and the kicks would have been easily passed off as wind.”
“Then when this is over, when we’ve brought down Hydra and found Bucky and brought him home, then I’ll court you.” Steve said. A shyness came over him then, a blush finding its way to his cheeks, “If you want me to that is.”
She hadn’t seen him, he’d made damn sure of that, taking to the back alleys and going across the rooftops, using Parkour to escape so she didn’t find him, but the fact she was here in Bucharest was enough to have him throwing his meagre possessions into a bag and running for the hills, or rather, for Vienna.
While not technically his daughter, Tony was acting as if she was. Once he’d gotten over his uncertainty about handling her, he had taken to her like a duck to water, hardly wanting to put her down, happily changing her nappies once Steve had shown him how it was done, having Friday download all the information there was on caring for children, child development, and Fatherhood.
Ned had never ridden a bike so fast in his life and neither had MJ, the two of them tearing across New York to the tower and running up to the doors and pounded on them buzzing the intercom frantically.
“Zach!” his Mamma breathed rising from the counter, Zach stumbled backwards, his pants falling from his hands as tears filled his eyes.
“And what if you don’t get “Knocked up” Pepper Asked him, “Or what if, what I assume are hormones to increase ovulation, cause you to conceive a high multiple birth. The Doctor’s attending you will need to know if it was natural or if you had fertility treatment, at which point Steve would find out, and a multiples pregnancy increases risk of miscarriage, premature birth, and birth defects. Not to mention the fact that these drugs could damage you, there have been cases of them causing phantom pregnancies, ovarian cysts, and all sorts of things.”
It took a little while for them to make their way down the cliff and by the time they reached the bottom just foot or so above the sea, Clint and Thor had come out and were relaxing on the rocks.
Steve gave them both a tired smile, “I’ll work on something.” He said meeting Tony’s gaze and rolling his eyes in exasperated fondness.
“I was desperate.” Tony said, “I walked probably two or three miles in the snow dragging my suit behind me before I found a garage to crash in. I got in there and had just sat down when I was shot by a potato!” Silence fell before Harley shoved at Tony.
Speaking of which, Natasha and Thor were waiting at the airport, The Thunder God insisting on being the one to carry Tony onto the plane and get him strapped in.
“What is it?” Steve asked, seeing the lust dying in Tony’s eyes even as the Billionaire fought to keep his emotions from showing on his face.
Tony grimaced, “They probably made sure any investigation was short lived too. As I recall, Aunt Peggy suffered her first stroke just two or three weeks after their deaths, and while it could have certainly been natural causes, she did have high blood pressure and wasn’t young, it could also have been because of some bastard tampering with her blood pressure meds, switching them out for something that would raise her BP and cause a stroke.” He shrugged, “They wouldn’t have cared if it had been fatal or not, just as long as it got her out of the way, which it did. She had to retire, it took her eighteen months to regain the use of her left leg and arm.”
“I do.” Tony said, “And if it works for me then it has the potential to work for many others too, and maybe one day I’ll be able to design something for quadriplegics too,” He wrinkled his nose, “That will take a lot of planning though, they’ll need support from the neck down and it’ll be difficult to design something strong enough to support them that won’t also restrict their breathing.”
“In the morning.” Steve said catching Zach about the waist and easily lifted the Pup up and over his head making Zach laugh and squirm, “Now a good soldier makes sure that his quarters are always in order, are you a good soldier?” Zach nodded his head his expression becoming earnest, “Then help your Mamma put your clothes away nice and tidy.”
The feeling Steve had gotten while sitting on the couch watching Dr Who with Tony’s children, and cooking breakfast for everyone in the kitchen, had been one of contentment. He’d actually felt happy and relaxed for the first time since he’d woken up.
Tony shrugged, “Me and Cap are gonna be hanging here for a few days at least, I don’t want you to be out of pocket.”
If that was not bad enough, the culprits, namely Zach and Peter, had decided to give the sand the shape of a mermaid, complete with a long flowing tail and breasts that would have put Jordan to shame.
Since he didn’t’ want Zach to get too cold, Tony insisted that the Central Park trip wait for the following day after Zach had already spent so long out into the snow. Zach whined for a little while but was soon occupied playing with the kittens and drinking hot chocolate, his previous sulk forgotten.
“Wanda Maximoff has been given psychokinetic and telepathic abilities by the sceptre.” Jarvis explained, “She is able to manipulate matter, move it, change it, and destroy it. She can read minds and implant suggestions and hallucinations, which she has done to various test subjects, resulting in violent behaviour both to themselves and others.”
Steve almost wanted to tell Jarvis to tell Pepper to stay away, to keep the boys at home, but he bit his tongue. He couldn’t deny them the chance of being with their mother, especially not since Tony might…No!
Holding his breath, Steve pulled his arm back from Tony, instantly missing the warmth of Tony’s abdomen on his palm and set about pulling his leg free from between Tony’s thighs, after a few attempts he managed to get his leg free and silently cheered for himself. The was only one limb left to retrieve, then he could run… limp off to the bathroom and spend a few minutes relieving himself.
“So, what brings you three strays to my Casa?” Tony asked, turning to Natasha, Clint, and Sam at last, “Zach, what have I said about bringing home strays, we already have the damn cats!”
“Says the man who nearly set his hair on fire when he fell asleep while using the toaster.” Steve dead panned.
His handler was cursing as new information came to him. It didn’t matter to the Asset, he didn’t handle that side of things, that was for the handler to deal with, he just did the physical work, the elimination of the targets. Who picked them, who decided these things was unknown to the asset and he did not question it, didn’t think to, he didn’t care. He hadn’t been programmed to care.
“Don’t you have any manners?” Steve chided him nudging Tony’s calf to get to put his legs down and get his trainers off the table.
Tony had been feeling pretty optimistic about his condition, then the doctor delivered the gut punch that knocked all the air out of Tony’s body.
It was late afternoon by the time the raft was completed and Steve had caught another three fish which set them at a fish a piece for dinner. Before he got on with preparing them, he helped push the raft out into the lake and waded out with Zach riding on the raft, the only one light enough to do so.
Dragging himself up from the ground, Tony kicked the boot repulsors into action and flew over to Steve, “Time to get out of here.” He croaked lifting the Captain up into the air, but before he could completely get away Bucky grabbed onto his boots and pulled him down, refusing to let go even as the repulsors burned him.
“No.” Steve said placing a hand on Tony’s shoulder, “No IVF, no surrogate. I don’t want to put you through that, I don’t want to go through all that.”
“I understand Jarvis.” He said as the lift reached the lab, slower than normal, giving Jarvis time to explain. “Thank you for alerting me to this.”
Pepper was there, with little Lily in her arms. She had broken down in tears when she’d seen Tony in Steve’s arms, his body limp and bloody. Happy Hogan was there, in the medical floor, his legs gone, and slowly dying of internal bleeding that just wouldn’t stop.
“You take care man, and if you need anything, you call me.” Rhodey had said as Tony had been bundled out to the car to take him and Obie to the airport where they took the Stark jet to honeymoon in Paris.
Having Tony with him at night certainly helped with the nightmares. Waking up in a warm bed with a warm body flush against his own helped to calm him down far faster than he’d have been able to calm down on his own. Once he got his breathing under control he would bury his face into Tony’s hair and hold the Omega close, breathing in his scent and letting it soothe his nerve and slowly pull him back into sleep.
“You both know I love you,” Tony said forcing back a sob, “You two are the best thing I have ever done in my life, the most important and precious things I have and I’m sorry that it has to be this way, but just remember that I love you both very much and take care of each other.”
Tony didn’t seem to bothered by this though, he was snoring softly, one of his arms hanging out of bed and one of his legs outside of the blankets and curled up over the other bunching the blanket between his legs.
“How about we have a lazy day watching movies?” Peter said, “We can stuff our faces on junk food and help catch Steve up on the entertainment he’s missed.”
“Already?” Tony asked sitting down on the bed beside Peter and gently swatted his head when the boy protested and moaned loudly and dramatically, “Share the bed or I’ll sit on your Father’s lap.” Tony threatened him and leaned close, “And we’ll talk about the first thing that comes up!”
“Bosses?” Tony had planned to just threated Curien, maybe give him a few more bruises, he had not expected to engage the man in conversation or to be given information so freely.
“Since when has everyone taken such an interest in shooting things?” Tony asked, “Nat and Barton are trigger happy psychos, but the rest of us aren’t.”
The ground he stepped on was broken, torn up and scorched beneath his feet, the air was thick with dust and ash, the sky an amber haze with the sun trying to burn through the thick layer of ash that was blanketing the earth.
Setting off at his maximum speed Steve tore through the woods, shoving past the remaining shoulders and throwing them out of his way. He leaped up the outer wall of the base, getting a fingerhold and a toe hold between the stones and climbed like a cat up the wall, pulling himself up into a handstand and flipped over at the top. He tossed his at the soldiers who fired at him, knocking them down like bowling ball pins, catching the shield he continued on his run, round to the course way, knocking aside more soldiers, dodging a few more bullets until he reached the entrance to the base.
“A decent computer terminal, long-nose pliers, wire cutters ad wire strippers, tweezers, and a full welding kit.” Tony listed.
Pepper informed him of this when he arrived back at the tower, once she was done yelling at him for getting himself hurt, and then hugging him and making sure he was alright.
Tony glared at the archer but it was Natasha’s basilisk look that had Clint gulping, “Are you saying that there is something wrong with girls and women?” She asked in a frigidly cold tone.
“Would you want to call him Steve?” Tony asked craning his neck so he could look to Steve, “A little Steve Junior?”
“I do not kill or cause harm to human, animal, avian, or aquatic life. I must follow Sir’s orders, though I am encouraged to tease, and may disregard this protocol if sir is placing himself at risk by not eating or drinking for a period of more than twelve hours.
“We know exactly who you are, Mr Osborn.” The detective arresting him said, “You’re the owner of that freak factory which just blew up, and if the reports about what’s been pulled from the remains are to be believed, you are some kind of Doctor Frankenstein.”
“I always liked Andrew.” Steve said, “And Hannah for a girl.” He smiled down at Tony, “What about you?”
“I thought you said a cool name!” MJ Drawled, “Those make it sound like he’s got a spitting problem and sprays everyone whenever he speaks.”
He harnessed the suit to himself with rope he found hanging from a sturdy tree branch, it had been holding up a tire, obviously having been some kids makeshift swing, but now it served as a way for Tony to take the suit with him since there was no way he could carry it’s weight.
In retrospect it was not his best decision as his Malibu mansion was attacked and plunged into the ocean with Tony inside it. Jarvis managed to get him out of what could easily have become a watery grave, but then the AI fell silent, leaving Tony in Rose Hill Tennessee with a broken suit and the whole world suspecting he was dead.
At some other time Tony might have made a joke about impassioned speeches but right now he knew that this was too important, Morgan was relying on them, was dependant on them, they had to do their best for her, so instead of making a joke he quietly agreed with Steve and decided to make the most of the time they had together before Steve had to leave once again.
“I am afraid it has become a spectator sport since Agent Barton decided to take Dumm-E, You, and Butterfingers to the range and give them a variety of projectiles and targets, I have managed to dissuade him from giving them actual weapons but….”
“Alright.” Bruce said, “I need to keep pressure on the wound and you two need to lift the stretcher as one, and move to the exit smoothly.”
That sparked a media debate over whether or not Tony should have given up the armour to the military or not. The pro side said that yes he should have, his injuries were a clear sign that he was not well trained enough for combat and the resulting loss of his intellect and technical genius would be felt by all and could have been avoided if he’d given the armour to a soldier.
“What?” Tony looked at her in confusion, “I don’t… months ago, I haven’t gone into heat in nearly a year. I’m going into heat-secession.”
“If it’s alright with Ned’s parents, sure.” Tony said his face lighting up with a smile when Peter hugged him. He was coming to the age where he’d be less inclined to show physical affection to his parents so Tony was taking advantage of all the hugs he could get while Peter still initiated them.
A frown flitted over Tony brow and then he scowled, “Jarvis you tattle tale!” He yelled, “I’m gonna ground you Mister, and now you’ve got a physical body I can make that grounding literal!”
Peter pulled at his sleeves continuing to frown, “Do you think there’s an afterlife?” He asked, “Somewhere people go?”
He wanted to move, was trying to move, to buck his hips and push up into the heat of Steve’s mouth, but he couldn’t, Steve was holding his hips to firmly, was keeping him pinned and making him a slave to the sensations he was allowing him. It was maddening and perfect and Tony was both desperate for release and for this to go on forever.
“Maybe we could go running together some time.” Steve said, he looked Sam up and down, “If you’re capable that is.”
Instead of doing secret santa as some companies did, Tony had set up a system so that money was collected from the last week of September to the second week of December and whatever the total amount was he would double and then presents for all of Stark Industries employees children were bought and were given out by “Santa” at the party.
He’d been lucky enough that Erskine had chosen him for the super soldier program, then his abilities had all come from the serum. Aside from that and a talent for art there was nothing special about him, he wasn’t overly smart, he could hardly work a mobile phone! What could he possibly offer someone like Tony Stark?
“I’m really sorry Mamma, I didn’t mean what I said and I promise I’ll never say it again or frighten you again.”
“Thank you.” Tony said with a small smile, he felt Steve squeeze his hand in support and drew in a breath for the next question.
If he hadn’t been so angry at that moment then Steve might have softened, might have seen the insecurity that was eating away at Tony and sort to assure and comfort him. But he was too angry, too hurt to hear anything but an accusation of infidelity in what Tony was saying about a younger healthier Omega.
“Wait!” Tony cried, holding a hand up to the cops, “We got this, just… wait.” He looked pleadingly at Bucky, “Please, you came to me for help and I will help you, but you have to trust me now, which I know is asking a lot, but I need you to do as I say and let these guys take you in. I’ll go with you and I will stay with you the whole time, I swear I won’t leave you.”
“You got a call from the Hartwell clinic.” He said to Tony, “They need you to go in for additional blood tests and a scan of your ovaries, because these drugs you’ve chosen to inject yourself with, can cause ovarian bleeds and cysts.” He stared hard at Tony, “Why, why didn’t you tell me?”
“God spare me from sulky AI’s.” Tony grumbled going to the oven where he was cooking Bacon, sausages, and eggs. He turned the sausages, swearing when he burned his fingers but continued to use them anyway. “FRI, the sausages are looking burned.” He complained,
“What, no!” Peter yelped finally lifting his head to look at her, “No rabies. Or cancer or Hepatitis. No sickness at all. I’m fine I promise I’m just different.”
“No, of course not.” Steve said having to clear his throat, “And, um, is there anything I can do?” He asked, “We need to contact Natasha and Fury don’t we?”
“A computer tablet.” Tony said rolling his eyes, “And Jarvis, get J in here, we need to start designing a whole new suit with prosthetic limbs that will work without nerve impulse.”
It had been decorated with balloons and a welcome home banner, the Bots had been brought up from the Lab and were beeping and booping and jostling each other to be the first to get to their creator.
As their kisses began to grow more heated Steve shifted, his hips bucking slightly forward, an unfillable sign that he was aroused and eager for more.
Butterfingers beeped as him and whirred off to go and tidy the work bench, somehow succeeding in making more mess than ever, and upsetting Dumm-E, who was on dusting duty, with a stained, torn, and completely disgusting rag that was smearing more oil everywhere than it was clearing it up. Butterfingers got in his way, setting dirty engine parts back onto the table after Dumm-E had “Cleaned” it. The two angrily beeped and trilled at each other until Tony broke their fight up and sent them to opposite sides of the labs for time out.
“I’m afraid not, Doctor Banner, it is clearly synthetic in origin but has been present in Mr Stark’s blood for a long time.” The Doctor said, “We also have an idea of when and how it was administered to you, Mr Stark.”
“Sure, since a pair of them have now arrived.” MJ Said reaching into her back pack for a bottle of sprite.
“Tony?” Steve asked looking to his lover, “You have the most experience of dealing with the media, what do you think?”
The Billionaire had been inconsolable since he had learned of his Father’s experimentation. He wouldn’t have any of the Avengers near him, wouldn’t eat or drink, and screamed bloody murder if the Doctors tried to touch him.
“Again that is something that can be discussed.” Pepper said, “What do the rest of you think?” She asked looking around at the rest of the team.
After ten days of this he was able to go back to his bedroom and start to mix with the team in the penthouse, his headphones blocking out forty percent of the noise and his sunglasses giving him a twilight view.
“The hell is he doing here?” She demanded, leaping to her feet and pointing an accusing finger at Tony.
“But I don’t care that you have issues, I have issues, you know I do, we’ve spent nights discussing them together, and I don’t care that you are older than me, I don’t care that you’ve been bonded before and have Pups, I love your Pups, Peter and Zach are the best boys in the world, I would be proud to call them mine too, and I understand that they have to come first, of course they do, I wouldn’t want it any other way.” He smiled and held out a hand to Tony, which the Omega took feeling very confused by this, “And you’ve been hurt in the past so much, your last Alpha betrayed you and hurt you terribly and you are afraid of being hurt again, that is only natural, but Tony, I promise I will never hurt you.” Steve was cupping his cheek again, stroking his skin and cupping the back of his head, “I’ll go slow with you, court you, Alphas still do that don’t they?”
“Yeah, I’ll just…” Steve gestured to the bathroom and Tony nodded continuing on his way down the hall.
“No, are you insane?” Tony yelped, “I just got thrown out of a window once I don’t want to go through it again, especially without my suit.”
The demi God looked like there were several things he wanted to say to that but then second guessed himself or thought better of them, finally after several moments pause he spoke again in a quiet and uncertain voice.
“Steve,” He whispered, “They’ve found me.” Hurriedly he shoved the phone behind the Toilet bowl, leaving the connection open so Friday could trace it easier and jumped as the toilet door was kicked open.
“Yes, I was married to my Tony Stark for a number of years. We have a daughter together. Lily. His daughter biologically, and mine by adoption. Our Pepper Potts surrogated for us.”
Heedless of the pain Tony was in the Doctor took Tony’s legs and strapped them into stirrups, his hands roughly spreading Tony’s thighs as wide as they would go to get access to his vulnerable, straining body.
“I’m sure she could win a beauty contest,” Pepper said, smirking as she came into the lab. It was still a bit of a shock to the system to see Tony interacting so easily with a baby, but then, he treated his bots like toddlers, so perhaps she shouldn’t be so surprised after all.
“Tony, we’re coming for you.” Steve said, “We’re prepping the jet right now, Rhodey is going to remote pilot the war machine armour and Friday will be remote piloting the Iron Man suite, we’re going to get you home I promise.”
“Hey baby boy, I hope you’re feeling better. I wish I could be there with you, I miss you so much sweetheart and I promise I’ll be home with you very soon.”
Determined to make up for his mistake that day he set about cooking up a storm while the Stark/Rogers family rested, Natasha sunbathed, and Bruce read, and Thor and Sam played volley ball on the beach.
Tony looked to Pepper who nodded, “I’ll get the wheels in motion,” she said, getting to her feet, “This should make for some interesting headlines if nothing else.”
“Friday, Peter, and Bruce helped me make it.” Zach said, “I thought it’d help you get things down from high places or low places.”
Zach frowned and opened his mouth to speak, but suddenly he was being encased in the Iron Man armour, “Mamma!” He yelled struggling against the metal chassis that was big enough to fight almost his entire body.
“So you would, you fucking coward.” Rogers jeered, wrapping his arms about Steve’s legs and pulling them out from under him so he ended up on his back with Roger’s straddling him and punching at his face as Steve struggled beneath him, deflecting and taking blows, he wrapped one hand about Rogers throat and squeezed, cutting off Rogers air and making his face redden as he struggled to break free of the hold while trying to keep Steve pinned down.
“Going to start throwing your wealth in our faces Stark?” Natasha sneered at him, “Your ego really knows no limits does it?”
“Facial analysis suggests that the Steven holding the Sceptre is at least ten years older than the present Captain.” Jarvis said.
“Zach!” Tony said turning slightly away from Steve, Thor and Hulk, “Zach, baby, I’m so sorry, Pete, are you there, talk to me honey.”
“Mamma, mamma, mamma!” Zach’s yelling preceded him bursting into the dining room and throwing himself at Tony. This startled Steve out of his thoughts of Bucky rejecting him and instead brought a pang to him as he saw Zach climb into Tony’s lap grinning at him, with huge chocolate brown eyes and wild black curls. He thought about the plans he’d secretly made in regards to Peggy after the War, how he’d work up the courage to ask her out, eventually propose, and then they’d settle somewhere and have a couple of kids together, sweet little ones, full of mischief and with bright eyes huge smiles, just like Zach.
While no one really felt like sleeping they didn’t argue with her. Pepper, Rhodey, Happy, Bruce, and Sam headed for the nearest hotel, Pepper had booked several suites for them to use while they were in Prague, Natasha and Clint opted to camp out in the jet, they could sleep on the bunks in there and keep an eye on the hospital even though the iron legion was stationed on the rooftop.
Rogers had found his face could get him into practically anywhere, and while being someone that people recognised did have its downsides, but in cases like this, where he could walk into one of the biggest hotels in Manhattan and be allowed to go through to a gala, it definitely made the downsides worth it.
Loud. It was so loud. Peter felt like he had mega phones in his eardrums he could hear so much noise from everywhere.
Sam made a choked noise, Natasha remained stoic but her hand was poised ready to draw her gun, Steve looked disappointed in Wanda as well as angry with her.
“Oh wanna play hard to get, my metallic masturbation fantasy?” Deadpool tilted his head and spoke in a quieter voice, as if he were addressing an audience, “You see, sometimes, no matter how hot and irresistible you are, the object of your desires is not going to give out without you putting in some work.”
He might be Iron Man, but he was also a Billionaire, Zach, as the Pup of a billionaire was a kidnappers dream. Any school Zach went to would have to have air tight security or he simply wouldn’t be safe.
“Sometimes.” Bruce said, not wanting to give Thor false hope, “It depends where the wound is in the spine and how bad it is, but sometimes people recover.”
He was uncertain with the team, Pepper, and Rhodey at first. Unsure of how he should be and how they would react to him, but as time passed and they carried on being how they had always been, (Inspirational and academically stimulating, Bruce.) (Annoying and cute. Clint.) (Adorable and fun. Thor.) (Terrifying and amazingly astute, Natasha.) (Impossibly honourable and beyond sexy, Steve.)
She didn’t offer false platitudes of “Everything will be fine” which Peter was grateful for, there was no way of knowing if everything would be fine, and saying that would be insulting to his intelligence.
Within fifteen minutes everyone was gathered around the tree with warm drinks and presents were being handed out, some from Santa for Zach and Peter, although the ones addressed to Peter from Santa were for Zach’s benefit. Other presents were labelled from the actual sender and Zach made sure he properly thanked everyone for what they had bought him. He was especially thrilled by the new bike he’d been given, as was Peter, who like Zach couldn’t wait to go riding.
Peter clenched his fists longing to hit Flash. He didn’t care what the obnoxious prick called him, he’d learned to ignore the remarks or deliver a stinging comment of his own, but he hated it when Flash would attack Ned over his weight. While normally pretty confident, Ned was sensitive when it came to his weight, and when people attacked him over it, he would comfort eat which would lead to him feeling worse about himself. It was a vicious cycle that dick bags like Flash fuelled with their cruelty.
“I know.” Tony said in a falsetto voice, “And do you know how I know that? We’re connected.” He grinned and winked at the kid, “Get your butt home, I’ll call you.” With that he sped off leaving Harley to make his way back to his garage and the suit.
“So do I.” MJ said. “I’ll take three months grounding if necessary but I’ve got to see Pete, I need to know the dumbass is okay.”
The rest of the day passed with Zach playing with his new toys, enjoying a lunch of chicken nuggets and chips with his favourite dips, having an art lesson from Steve on how to draw basic animal and people shapes.
In reality it had been less than a minute he’d been out there, any longer and not even the suit would have been able to protect him from the vacuum. But in his dreams he was in that void for far longer, an infinite amount of time, where he didn’t lose consciousness just as the nuke exploded, but stayed awake, able to see everything, to feel the cold settling into his flesh, feel his body beginning to panic from the lack of air. He would be gulping for it, his mouth wide open as he tried to suck air into his burning lungs, but there was nothing, only the cold emptiness of space which he couldn’t inhale. He could feel the gas bubbles forming beneath his skin as the lack of pressure changed the way his blood and other fluids acted. He felt his skin expanding, the suit becoming tight as his body swelled with the gas bubbles, his vision grew hazy as the moisture boiled away, his mouth becoming dryer than a desert as all the liquid in his body boiled.
“You are very welcome Ned.” Steve said with a smile, he was used to Ned’s hero worship by now although it was cute. He looked over his shoulder, “Everyone buckled up?”
Sucking in a deep breath Tony leaned forward and lifted his feet off the bottom of the pool. Once he was suspended in the water he began to swim, he kept his head above the water, swimming across the lake, there was a splash of water and soon Steve was beside him easily able to keep up.
Peter worried at his bottom lip with his teeth and broke the cookie again, crumbling it on the table, “Is he okay?” He asked, “He’s not hurt?”
“Hungry?” Steve asked holding up the bag holding the take aways, “I’ve got a double cheese burger, a bacon cheese burger, a southern fried chicken burger, and single cheese burger.”
They were half buried, mangled, destroyed in the wreckage, the last remains peaking out like head stones on a grave.
“Whatever name you chose, you are not becoming a superhero until after college.” Tony said, “So keep that in mind, Spiderling!”
After taking blood samples and checking his blood pressure, breathing, and heartbeat, Peter was moving into a paediatric side room where he’d be monitored until he’d regained consciousness. The paediatrician decided to administer a drip feed just to help flush the tranqs out of Peter’s system faster, Steve still winced when he saw the canula going into the back of Peter’s hand. He hated this, hated that Peter was hurt, that Zach was missing, that Tony was missing and that there was nothing he could do about it but sit at Peter’s bedside and wait.
She smiled in the darkness of her room. Tonight had been the closest she had gotten to pushing Stark over the edge, just a little more and she would succeed in bringing her families murderer down.
Natasha glared at Clint who had the grace to look chastened, “We’ll talk about it later.” Steve mumbled, red faced and embarrassed.
It was hilarious to see two robots making their way across the lab with their claws downcast and beeps sounding saddened as they were chastised.
Once they had established that he was lucid the consultant pulled up a chair and sat down besides him.
Sam shrugged, “So was the Exo project and I don’t regret signing up for that.” He dug into the half baked, getting both cookie dough and fudge brownie on his spoon, “If I can get the wings I can even help you take down Hydra, or at least this… cell? Is that the right term?” His nose scrunched up as he frowned, “They call terrorist groups cells, so I guess it fits.”
Putting on his clothes did nothing to improve his mood, his shirt and trousers felt uncomfortably tight about his waist which he had to admit was thicker than normal, the bloating clear in a pot belly that he scowled at.
Tony seemed oblivious to Steve’s shock, taking him by the elbow and guiding him back to the lift to take him to the floor he’d chosen for Steve “Because it get’s the best natural light and you are an artist aren’t you? I think I remember Howard saying that. You can decorate however you’d like, the furniture is pretty basic right now, but you can get and change whatever you want, and you have free access to the swimming pool, jacuzzi, and steam room.”
“And look at this, room with a view, ensuite, sky TV, everything a guy needs right?” Rhodey said gesturing to the window.
Sam did not seem as pleased by it, neither did Natasha, but Rogers was proud, though he wished that the other news stations and news papers would leave off. Which was one of the things that he wanted to talk to Tony about, one of the many things actually, since it seemed Tony and Steve were making overtures to other groups to form a team of their own against this imagined threat of Tony’s.
“Wuss!” Tony called after Jarvis as he exited the hospital room, he then narrowed his eyes at Steve, “What are you smirking at?” He demanded, “And where are my recalcitrant brats, have you sold them to highway men, if so you better have gotten a good price for them, Peter’s worth at least a horse or two!”
“Out.” Steve snapped, striding into the lift and punching a button inside. He kept his back turned so he didn’t see Tony fall to his knees, hand over his mouth as he stifled his sobs.
Red and black spots were beginning to dance in front of his stinging eyes and his head was feeling heavier and heavier. His entire body was growing numb as everything seemed to be fading away.
“They are ten weeks old, they were found abandoned at perhaps two weeks old, their Mother was no where to be found.” Peter explained, he bit his lip and looked down at the kittens, “Can we keep them?” he asked.
Zach might not be related to her by blood, but Natasha loved him all the same and she was damned if she was going to let some narrow minded assholes ruin his childhood through their bigotry.
“I promise.” Tony said swallowed down the painful lump that had risen in his throat, “Give him a big kiss from me when he wakes up again and tell him I’ll be home with Zach soon.” He inhaled sharply, “I love you Steve.” Quickly he disconnected the call and spent several minutes breathing heavily and fighting off another anxiety attack before he called Harley and a recovering Jarvis.
“Think my Science teacher will be impressed?” Peter asked Tony, watching as the lava began to settle as the volcano finished spewing its guts out.
It was the need to prove he could do this by himself that had him pushing down that knot and strengthening his resolve.
“Yeah, she’s a huge fan of CSI and Law and Order.” Peter said shrugging, “The Principal’s lucky she didn’t call in Crime Scene investigators and lawyers.”
Pain struck Peter’s throat and his eyes brimmed with tears, “I’m sorry.” He whimpered, “I just wanted you to be proud of me.”
Horror stories of things that had been done to people unfortunate enough to end up in those places were rife through Steve’s youth, and still provided material for horror movies in this modern world.
“Hey, got some info on the Mandarin, or at least I possibly do. It’s connected to A.I.M. They are based out of Miami and according to Rhodey the military have traced the broadcast signals the Mandarin have been using back to Miami.”
“It’s stable now, I managed to stabilize it, and thankfully Zach is seeing it as a gift, something to be joyful about rather than a violation.”
“I’d have killed them if they had dared put so much as a finger on you.” Steve growled, startling himself and Tony with the vehemence in his voice. He shifted uncomfortably and glanced away as Tony started the car and pulled out of the car park.
The woman had run off while he was doing so, and guiltily Peter was thankful as he had no idea what he would have said to her. Thankfully it had been a night when neither MJ or Ned were listening in so they didn’t have to share the horror with Peter. It became another sickening secret he was keeping, this one keeping him awake at night, haunting him when he was trying to rest.
Bruce groaned wishing Zach wasn’t so bright, or so hard to refused, the damn kid was so adorable that even the Pope couldn’t have refused him if he’d asked for something.
“Steve’s right,” Wanda said, “The world hates Stark, they’ll turn from him soon enough,” she smiled at Steve, “You just need to remind them who you are and what you stand for,”
As the media had gotten wind of Peter's injury and hospitalization, Oscorp and Norman himself was facing hate from the general public, several of his buildings had been vandalized and people were throwing things at his limo when he went to and from his town house.
“How are these damn things so fucking difficult?” Sam cursed as he and Steve struggled to get the tents put up.
“Asshole, you are meant to comfort me not insult me.” Tony complained as he splashed water on his face. “And how did Steve even find those damn injections, did you tell him?”
“While you are playing bar tender you can get me a vodka.” Natasha ordered him, getting a salute from Clint in return. “So,” She said looked back at the others, especially at Tony, “Were you ever going to tell Shield?”
Tony screamed on the narrow bed he’d been placed on. He’d been stripped out of the Doctors clothes and another hospital gown had been shoved on him, his wrists had been bound to the bed preventing him from moving and his legs shoved apart so the Doctor, not the one he’d knocked out, a different one, could see the birth canal.
The Twins remained illusive too, Clint and Natasha had been reaching out to all of the European contacts for news on the pair but so far nothing had turned up, the closest had been a possible sighting in Slovakia but it was unproven and when Sam and Clint had gone to search Bratislava they had found nothing.
“I want to do an interview.” He said firmly, “If Stern has the right speak about my family then I have the right to defend them.”
“A bit banged up, but he’ll be alright.” Bruce said democratically, in truth neither he nor Happy knew exactly how badly either Tony or Steve were hurt, they could only assume that they were not too seriously injured by the fact that they had not sort medical attention. However, Happy had said that Tony had once nearly severed a couple of toes when he’d been bare foot in the lab and as he’d been too busy to go to the hospital, he’d attempted to patch his foot up with electrical tape and his shirt!
“They are adorable though.” Steve said still fascinated by how emotive Tony had made the Botts, it was truly incredible how “Alive” they were. They were more like people than machines, clumsy, misbehaving people.
Peter rolled his eyes, “I don’t think we need that for this, Ned, I’m just chasing MJ through the park, not breaking into fort knox.” He groaned when he heard Ned’s sucked in breath, “That isn’t a suggestion.”
The silence hung heavy in the tower after Tony’s speech, an uncomfortable silence that no one felt that they could break, they couldn’t meet each others eyes or do anything but stare down at their feet.
“Bullshit!” Steve cried, startling Tony by his unusual use of language, “Even Thor couldn’t keep her from messing with him, a demi God, what chance did a base line human have?” For once Tony didn’t have a come back which under other circumstances Steve might have found amusing, but right now he was too concerned with convincing Tony that this wasn’t his fault, and he realized right then that Tony always thought things were his fault, was always ready to insult himself and list what he termed as his character flaws.
“Stay still baby.” Steve said he looked down at the wound in Tony’s back and felt his stomach turn over.
Peter nodded hoping Bruce was correct, he’d never get clothes to fit with two more legs and two more arms!
“I’ll whip us up a chilli if that’s alright with everyone?” Bruce offered. He received several nods of agreement, Sam even took over his unpacking so Bruce would be free to go and cook right away which meant they’d all be eating sooner.
That said, Steve could see it from Tony’s perspective. Back when he had been a skinny scrawny waif that a puff of wind could knock over, he’d not been confident in his appearance. Had anyone shown an interest in him, not that they had despite Bucky’s efforts, then he would probably have felt much the same as Tony did now.
“Everything is not fine.” Tony said and Lily let out a shrill wail, “See! Even she knows it’s not okay!” Steve gave him an eye roll,
“Jarvis activated your Ultron program.” Steve said, “He’s currently in the Vision armour and standing guard in the hall, there are six Iron Legion drones over the hospital and more guarding Stark industries.”
“Careful, if you’re going to do that.” Tony cautioned, “Hydra know me and Steve are onto them, they don’t know about you, yet, but if they find out then you’ll have targets on your backs too.”
“That seems like a lot of power to have at your disposal.” Steve said, frowning at the plans and schematics. “The ships are built?”
A few minutes later, they were sat back in bed sharing breakfast with Lily sat between them chewing on an Iron Man plushy that Pepper had gotten her and babbling to herself happily.
“I like him too.” Steve said, taking and cookie, it was warm and sweet and good, the chocolate melting on his tongue when he bit into it.
“Damnit, PETER!” MJ yelled, “Fucking stop!” grabbing Ned by his sleeve she dragged the boy towards Peter and Harry, bending down to take hold of his shoulders and pull him off Harry. They were both shocked when Peter was able to shake them loose with the ease of batting a fly away and continued to whale on Harry until a couple of teachers arrived, scattering the kids and finally breaking up the fight.
“We can do that.” Steve said, making Tony’s eyebrows arch, “You’ve already done it for me and Lily. We can do it for Bucky.”
With pride swelling in his chest Steve knelt down beside Tony, gently turning him so he could see his face.
“We will discuss your injuries when you are completely out of the sedation.” The doctor said to Tony, “I have some tests I need to conduct to ensure that you are breathing correctly and are able to swallow first.”
“I don’t even know if I can enjoy it anymore!” Tony screamed back, he sat rigid on the bed, his upper body shaking with frustration and anger brought on by the situation. “I don’t know if I can enjoy sex anymore.” He said in a hard and bitter voice, “I don’t know if I will feel anything when you get inside me, but that doesn’t mean I don’t want to try and it also doesn’t mean that won’t enjoy having you making love to me, doing all the rest of it even if I can’t feel part of it.”
“Friends!” Thor greeted as he came up the beach glistening from his latest swim, “Have you still not erected your habitats for this night?”
Bucky pulled back his fist ready to strike again, but Sam swiftly intervened, holding back the metal arm, “He ain’t worth it man. Let the law deal with this.”
Peter tore open the skylight with ease, wincing at the metal shrieked and groaned, it clearly hadn’t been opened in a while and he coughed and spluttered as he was hit with a face full of real spider webs, a few disgruntled spiders scurrying away now he’d disturbed them. Peeling away the webbing Peter leaned down and looked inside what was clearly a lab. He could see huge glass tanks with things inside them, air tight work stations with external glove holes so scientists could work without exposing themselves, cages containing monkeys, rabbits, rats, and other animals were lined up with water and feeding tubes connected to them. The poor creatures probably never left their cages except to be experimented on.
“Recruiting reinforcements?” Steve drawled letting himself enjoy the fact that Tony was alive for a few moments before he had tell him the horrible news about Zach.
“No Tony, we do this together.” Steve was adamant about that, Tony had suffered this alone for long enough, from now on Steve was going to be by his side through it all.
Curien was still being granted his immunity and witness protection in return for his testimony against Norman. If and when the asshole was located he would still give testimony against him in court.
Chocking back sobs Zach struggled back to his feet and made himself run for the storage bins, only to find himself running straight into the legs of the man who’d met them at this factory.
With a cry Tony went down to his knees clutching at his cheek, Steve let out an angry cry leaping to his feet to defend Tony, but Peter beat him to it, delivering a right hook of his own that floored Norman.
“You look beautiful all flushed and sated.” He growled and Tony laughed helplessly, feeling rather like a boneless fish.
Professor Xavier had agreed to an alliance should the need arise, Logan had grunted by way of response, but that was his normal response to practically anything, Colossus was of course ready and willing, every solid crome inch of him was practically vibrating with enthusiasm, which had Tony thinking naughty, Deadpool like thought which he promptly shut down, still dreading to arrival of the deranged lunatic.
Tony made a face, he didn’t have a high opinion of Shrinks and certainly didn’t want to take his Son to one of them.
“God I hope I don’t start growing four more limbs.” Peter murmured, “I’m not sure I’d know what to do with them!”
“Slippery bastards slithered away but we will eventually find him.” Natasha swore, the glint in her eyes promising a world of pain for the man when she did.
This meant that the rest of the team would have to double their efforts to make a good impression, something that was going to be difficult when Clint tried to hide in the vents. His departure from them was less than heroic and involved a lot of high pitch screaming, as when Natasha told Tony where Clint was hiding, Tony decided to send one of Zach’s Daleks into the vents to get Clint out.
“Bossman, security want to know if the gentleman in the lobby needs to be arrested, as it seems he is armed!” Friday said.
“You’re ground.” Tony told him letting out an exaggerated oof as Zach launched himself into his lap and hugged him hard,
It was like the Captain knew him, or had known him, but that wasn’t possible, the Asset had no past that Hydra didn’t create, he existed for them, was created by them, he didn’t have friends or anything that people had because he wasn’t a person, he was just a weapon.
“Sweetie you can play with us, it’s only for a week and you will see him every meal time.” Steve said attempting to soothe the distressed boy, but Zach was having none of it, squirming out of Steve’s hold and ran to Peter throwing himself around his legs and clinging on as hard as he could.
Fury narrow his eye at the genius looking like he was ready to string Tony up by toes and go over Shield protocol in nauseating detail, or something equally as painful, however he did send Maria out for the drink and food order so at least Tony was getting feed and watered.
“Pizza?” If Tony’s go to food was burgers and Zach’s was pancakes, Peter’s was Pizza, the cheesier the better.
While not part of this discussion truly, Steve could not stand by and do nothing as Tony was attacked from all sides from these people, that were so very different from the team he’d known. He stood behind Tony, placing a large hand on his shoulder and met Rogers’ eyes over Tony’s head, silently stating that he stood with Tony and if Rogers’ were to attempt anything physical he would have to face him too.
“I still say that costume did nothing for your ass.” Tony said, looking at the original Captain America suit that was on a dummy, all shiny material and tights that made Steve cringe, he’d felt like an over-sized sugar-plum fairy in that get up.
“If we fit the harness about my hips, thighs, and have an additional support around the waist and back then this should work.”
“Will they take us away?” Zach asked, his eyes huge with worry, “Some kids at school got taked ‘way by Social servives ‘cuz their Mom was doing drugs with her boyfriend.” He looked up at Steve worriedly, “I won’t go!” He said, “Don’t wanna, won’t let ‘em taked me.”
Like what? Am I going to have to use adult nappies because I can’t control my bowel and bladder, am I ever going to be able to have sex again, can I ever be Iron Man again?
“He is homophobic.” Steve said, “He needs to grow up and get over it. Its not catching, and there is nothing to fear from us gays is there?”
Natasha told only the bare minimum, how she’d been taken into training as an assassin as a small child, spent her whole lift training and preparing. First working for the KGB, then going freelance, eventually coming onto Shield’s radar and crossing paths with Clint, who’d decided to save her instead of kill her.
Keeping Zach out of the loop was pretty easy given his age. He accepted being told that his Mamma was busy and that he’d call later, he could be distracted with games, Dr Who, food, and other things.
Steve gulped as he realized that his morning glory was pressed flush against Tony’s buttocks and the erection became far more demanding.
“So I will be hearing from you on a regular basis then Sir!” Jarvis shot back, “And while we are on the subject, your blood work has come in, your cholesterol is a little high.”
“Watch it, or you are going into Time Out.” Tony grumbled as he tried to keep his legs from buckling under his body as Steve lowered him back onto the floor. “This had better be life or death or I’mm cutting off Pepper’s Jimmy Choo allowance!”
“A choice Tony.” Killian said, walking towards him. He hardly looked human anymore, his skin was red and glowing, his eyes flames, his hands pulsating with deadly heat as he stalked towards Tony.
With his handlers gone the Asset really didn’t know what he was supposed to do now, he’d never been without handlers before, had never had to make his own decisions.
Wanda, however, drew herself back up and summoned up her magic. Seeing her chance to hurt Tony she took it, blasting him out of Vision’s arms, hitting Vision in the process, and sent them both tumbling across the lawn.
"Yeah we're still waiting. The Doctor's think it's toxic shock, we don't know anymore yet." Steve told her, "Listen, we need one of you to meet Zach at three and..." He paused and looked to Tony, "Do you want him to come here?" Tony paused and then shook his head, "Just take him home and we'll see him later."
“The pizza will be fine, thank you.” Steve said, his cheeks still pink and he went to Sam’s fridge and found the take away Pizza box.
“That doesn’t mean I’m not guilty,” Tony whispered, “I still did it, I still made the fucking thing,”
“He, they are from an alternate reality, Cap,” Tony replied, “He arrived last night with Lily. They are the only survivors of a planetary destruction,”
“I’m afraid times up for tonight. Or rather this morning.” The Doctor said having the decency to sound regretful, “You can come back later on this afternoon. Visiting hours are between two and five pm.”
It seemed that it was fortunate that Tony had called Clint to come and baby sit Lily for the night. He was driving Laura mad, getting under her feet all the time, and she sent him with a letter for Tony, begging him to find something for Clint to do that would get him out from under her feet all the time or she would certainly be committing murder! There was only so much “Help” she could stand having, when he hovered beside her to peg out washing, nearly burned the kitchen down attempting to cook, had repainted every wall in the house twice, and always seemed to be following her around like a lost puppy!
“Yeah, okay, but I don’t bend there.” Tony protested, squirming under Natasha’s grip, “Seriously Nat, that bit you’re saying I need to bend and twist with, I don’t have, I am lacking that bit on my body, hey! Hands, cold hands, really cold hands.” Tony batted Natasha away making her snort and roll her eyes. “Sam, you’re up as the next victim.” Tony said rolling out of the ring.
In an effort to save face Tony grumbled as he wriggled around so he was laying under Steve’s arm and had his head resting on Steve’s chest, “You’re lucky you are so pretty Rogers, or I’d toss your ass out for laughing at me.”
“Is he gonna die?” Zach whimpered his voice tiny and frightened, Peter’s head snapped around to look at his brother and his heart broke at the sight of him tear streaked and pale with fear. Silently he grabbed hold of the younger boy and pulled him into a tight hug, shedding more tears of his own as Zach cried into his shoulder.
“That is, something incredible.” Tony replied shutting the file down, he’d look it all up when they boys had gone to bed, right now he had Pizza, cider and a movie to enjoy.
“I don’t know, the doors locked and he’s not answering,” The door rattled and was knocked on again, “Bucky are you alright?” Stark sounded really worried now and the giant Steve was probably about to start kicking down the door. Swallowing hard Bucky forced himself to speak,
“Robbie, language!” The poor woman said, her cheeks flushing slightly, “Honestly he is Iron Man mad, I can hardly get him out of that costume long enough to wash it!”
“Alright, what’s so urgent that you had to gate crash a private party?” Tony asked, getting straight down to business.
“Yeah sure.” Tony snorted, “And I’ll give you a bedtime story and kiss goodnight!” It was probably good that he’d shut the lights down since he didn’t see the flush on Steve’s cheeks as they headed out of the lab and back into the main house.
“Captain Rogers is requesting your presence Sir.” Jarvis said, “And I must alert you to the fact that Master Zach has instigated full scale war in the lab with Dumm-E, Butterfingers, and U, and Agent Barton is aiding and abetting via the ventilation ducts.”
“Dude, it is so cool Mr Stark and Captain America are letting us stay in the tower. I mean wow, two whole nights at Avengers tower with the avengers!” Ned had been tripping out over getting to stay at Avengers tower since Peter had suggested it and his parents had agreed.
“Why, thank you, Natasha, I shall take that as a compliment.” Tony asked as he finally joined them. He preened for Clint’s wolf whistle then stuck his finger up at the archer while he kissed Steve.
Natasha accompanied them; she was sporting a dark blonde wig that bounced just above her shoulders, she had tied a light blue scarf about her head like an alice band and had large silver hooped earrings in her lobes. She had applied a very obvious fake tan to her skin and very heavy make-up with a shocking amount of bright red lipstick which gave her the look of party girl who spent all of her time thinking about her appearance and very little else. The micro mini skirt that only just covered her backside, the four inch platform heels, and dangerously low cut crop top completed the look.
“Ah, just call him Daredevil, or the big double D-cup like I do!” Deadpool said, trying to get into Bucky’s lap only to be shoved unceremoniously to the floor, where he actually dared to wrap himself about Bucky’s legs and hump them like a dog,
For several minutes Tony threw up with Steve holding him steady and making soothing noise until there was nothing left in Tony’s body to come back up. He then sat Tony down against the sink stand and flushed the toilet, getting to his feet and filling one of the tooth mugs with water and the other he brought for Tony to spit into after he’d rinsed his mouth.
Peter shuddered at the thought of hurting someone, especially Tony, especially Zach, he’d rather die.
In the heat of the fight he and Steve managed to put their differences aside to work together and they kept the halicarrier in the air, Tony nearly getting shredded by the turbines, Thor and Hulk were lost somewhere, and Coulson was killed.
“Whats going on?” he asked, trying to figure out of he was in trouble at all, not that he’d done anything so far as he could remember.
“In the penthouse. Her Uncle Rhodey is baby-sitting,” Tony said, “Having played escort to me many times, he has a lot of experience when it comes to baby-sitting!”
Steve shrugged, “I guess I’ll be sleeping on the streets then. Because I’d rather be homeless than work for people who’d condemn half a country without even trying to save them.”
“I wonder if it’ll last past five years, the last three marriages haven’t.” The woman who’d insulted Violet muttered beneath her breath.
Steve felt sick, he felt the bile rose up the back of his throat and had to force it back down. He heard Natasha say something Russian and Clint swear under his breath. Bruce made hasty excuses and beat a retreat from the room to go and calm down or find somewhere to let Hulk out for a while, Thor was gripping Mjolnir and looked torn between rage and tears. Tony however, he was ashen, all the colour had drained from his face, and he was shaking all over as he glared down the bed.
Peter felt achy and heavy as he slowly opened his eyes, his mouth was horribly dry and he made to sit up to get a drink only to have a gentle hand push against his shoulder.
Tired, hungry, and in need of snuggles with Lily and a hug from Steve, Tony gratefully exited the UN building, flanked by Rhodey and Steve.
Clint he’d put in a simple black suit, with a black shirt, and a dark purple tie and matching pocket handkerchief. Like Bruce the archer was also sporting a rolex on his wrist, the only part of the outfit he wasn’t grumbling about having to wear.
I know he seems abrasive and arrogant, I know he acts like the biggest asshole on the planet, but that is what it is, an act. He is the most generous, warm hearted, and brave man you will ever meet. When I learned that it was already too late, the bridges between us had been burned and there was nothing left but ashes.
Maya ran as fast as she could from the lift and through the car pack, Zach Stark held tight in her arms, his little arms and legs beating her as she went, his cries of protest muffled against her breast as she kept firm hold of him.
Bruce grimaced as he tried to explain, “Its complicated Zach, when adults have relationships that are deeper than friendship it has consequences for them and their lives.”
Pepper had begged him to get help, Rhodey had tried to reason with him, both no avail. Tony had been determined to self-destruct, to bury himself in work until it finally crushed him. Eventually his body hadn’t been able to take anymore and he’d collapsed, being rushed to hospital, sick with malnutrition, dehydration, and exhaustion.
Tony resisted the urge to roll his eyes, “Because we are public figures, household names. In this era practically everything you say and do is political in one way or another and it is so easy to offend people without meaning to. Its why people like me have PR departments to handle most of my press releases, and I generally only have pre-planned interviews or press conferences with pre-arranged questions.” The exceptions to that had been after Afghanistan of course, but for the most part Tony was careful what he gave the press, only throwing them the meat he wanted them to eat rather than risking getting devoured by them.
“You kidnapped a child, put another in the hospital.” Natasha growled at her, “You are holding three people captive here and now.”
“Don’t you even think about running off!” She snarled, summoning her power and taking a shot at Rhodey regardless of the baby in his arms.
Tony and Steve made use of these, covering their clothing and their faces to conceal with identity as they entered the hospital.
Mutely Steve did as he was told, scrubbing and drying his hands relieving Bruce so he could go and wash his hands and then start replacing the packs over Tony’s abdomen and apply pressure to slow the bleeding.
Tony narrowed his eyes at his Son, “You’re grounded.” He said, “And you!” He poked Steve in the stomach and the super soldier let out a grunt more from reflex than actual pain. “You are supposed to be the adult here, the responsible one. I am relying on you to be the responsible one in this relationship because I am unable to be responsible about anything and everything, and Peter Benjamin Parker Stark, you put a single scratch on any of my cars an, you will be grounded until you’re a thirty!”
“You don’t know that.” Steve said, “Peter’s old enough to make his own decisions, he would have found a way to do what he did anyway. Please baby, don’t torture yourself like this, it isn’t your fault.”
"Will you bring him in?" Peter asked shifting again and wishing the bed wasn't so hard and the sheets not so itchy on his skin.
“So, I thought we should probably go and speak to the Avengers, before letting the world know about you and Lily,” Tony said to him, going to pour himself a fourth cup of coffee, “I’ll do a press conference and handle letting the public know as soon as the Avengers are in the picture,” he paused, turning and gave Steve an uncertain look, “So long as you’re alright with that?”
“Brat.” Tony said, “Go to sleep at midnight or I’ll have Jarvis play all of Steve’s PSA video’s on repeat.”
“Pepperoni, what can I do for your most deliciousness?” Tony asked, giving her his best grin, which Pepper rolled her eyes at.
It was the following morning that everything went to shit. After Rhodey left to take the suit to Fort Edwards, and Pepper and Happy went to SI.
Peter honestly didn’t think the pain could get worse until the first crunch of bone, when that happened he wasn’t even able to scream, everything went white inside his head and it was like the whole world had become white noise, he could focus on nothing, not even the pain that was searing through him, another crunch and oddly enough that one he didn’t feel, he couldn’t feel anything beyond that first wave of agony, couldn’t register anything anymore.
“Listen up perverts!” She yelled, “Peter is not screwing any of you in webs, nor is he wearing spandex, leather, or any other type of bondage clothing, so go back to looking at internet porn you sad twisted freaks!”
“Can we make another volcano, Mamma?” Zach asked bouncing on the balls of his feet, “The one that the Doctor went to with Donna?”
“No I mean to me.” Peter said, looking down at the bed sheets, “Am I grounded?” The question took his parents by surprise and it took a moment before they responded.
“That’s bullshit!” Peter shouted glancing slightly to the left as everyone, but Steve left the gym to give the family some privacy, Bruce picked up Zach and carried him out of the gym, so he wouldn’t see Tony and Peter fighting.
“One from Boss Lady, a reminder about the Stark Phone mark seven needing to be completed by the end of the week,” Friday replied. Tony winced. Pepper was still keeping a distance from him since their break up. Was only being professional with him. He hoped that one day they’d get their friendship back, but for now, professionalism was all he could hope for.
“Mamma?” Peter’s sleepy voice caught Tony’s attention and he demanded that Steve put his phone to Peter’s ear.
“Baby, you’re back with me at last.” Steve came into view and Tony became aware of his hand being held, as Steve’s worried but relieved face came into focus.
Rogers and Natasha’s trials took a year to come to court, they were tried together on charges of theft, terrorism, failure to report a crime, attempting to pervert the course of justice, resisting arrest, assault of Tony Stark, Steve Rogers, Rhodey, and Lily Stark-Rogers, and illegal entry to Austria.
Tony wanted to keep his eyes shut, to spit out whatever was in his throat, to curl up and go back to sleep, to escape these dreams and everything, but someone was touching him, urging him to wake up.
“Stop it, stop it, stop it!” Tony howled, clawing his own skin, his nails sunk so deep into the flesh that they left deep bloody tracks, alarming Steve into grabbing Tony’s wrists to stop him from doing himself anymore damage.
When he opened the door he found Stark, Giant Steve, and the baby waiting outside, “Thought you’d fallen in for a minute!” Tony joked, as Steve headed into the bathroom to change the baby, when Bucky didn’t reply he continued, “So, we’re gonna order breakfast and then I need to get to the UN. You can stay here with Matt and Sam if you want, or you can with me, Steve, and Rhodey. I warn you though, if you come to the UN it could be hours of boredom.”
Kissing was easy, they both fell into effortlessly, their bodies leaning against each-other, Steve moving to half lay over Tony his hands running up and down Tony’s sides while Tony ran his through Steve’s soft hair and down his back.
Part of Steve ached to go to Tony, to take over from Pepper and be the one comforting Tony, showing him that it was alright to cry, that it was a healthy way of releasing emotion and nothing to be ashamed of. But this wasn’t his Tony, this was a different Tony, one had been through worse and been hurt so many times that he had started to think that it was his due.
The first thing Tony did was empty his bladder, then he unwrapped his throbbing wrist and peeled off the adhesive dressings to he could take a shower. Washing his hair with one hand was difficult but he managed it, however he had to ask Steve to re-wrap his arm and split it with the spoons.
By the time they had sorted this out and gone back to the tower to regroup, they were all exhausted, battered, and bruised, except for Thor who didn’t bruise, and Bruce he’d been fortunate enough to sit this one out.
“Ultron was the name of a programme that Banner and I were working on. I did not create that android, the life force, intelligence, whatever the hell it was came out of the sceptre that you told Banner and I to study, and yes we thought that maybe the intelligence could help us in creating the Ultron AI but we were no where near close to implementing anything. The scans triggered it and it came to life, created itself a body out of the Iron Legion and Helen Cho’s cradle. And lets not forget the fact that your mind raping Hydra bitch violated my mind, triggered my fears into taking the sceptre in the first place. Had she not done that then Ultron may never have happened. So if you want to blame someone for all of this shit, blame that fucked up murderous whore!”
“You let us die.” Pepper accused, She and Happy stood behind Sam and Rhodey, their flesh flapping like loose cotton in the wind, their bones clear to see beneath the sliced flesh.
“Hey Lily, it’s alright, we’re safe now,” Steve cooed to her, he became impossibly tender and gentle that he completely belied his size. He was bigger than the Steve that Tony knew. His shoulders were easily a foot wider than the Steve from this reality, he was a couple of inches taller too, his eyes were darker a more brilliant and vivid blue than the pale baby blues that this reality’s Steve had, and  he was older.
“Thank you for sharing that with us Wade,” Matt sighed, rubbing his forehead where a tension headache was forming, he was pretty sure that the nerves had formed a very familiar shape, the shape of Wade fucking Wilson.
Unable to speak Tony offered him a smile, wondering when this heaviness and numbness would wear off.
Rhodey turned a frown on his face just before the visor closed and he took off into the air, flying to the centre of the base where he began to remove the slabs of concrete, the beams, the sheets of metal.
“Makes the perfect housewife, doesn’t he?” Tony commented, engrossed in his coffee and the suites wiring.
“It has to be you,” Reed said, “I have to man the controls, Pepper doesn’t want to go, not without Happy, and he’s too injured to leave the bed. Someone has to survive, after all, you have Lily to think about,” Steve looked down at the seven month old in his arms, the little girl was sleeping contentedly, completely unaware of what was happening around her. Steve envied her that, wished he could be so innocent.
“Meet Gingerbread and Espresso.” Tony said, “Bruce and Happy are suckers for Zach’s puppy eyes and took him and Peter to a shelter, where Zach donated all of his allowance and adopted the fleabags.”
A damaged AI, Steve had no idea how to fix that, he doubted that Bruce did either, and the man had bolted for the Hulk proof room that Tony had purposely built for him, the second the mansion had fallen into the ocean. No doubt he was there now, giant, green, and raging.
It frightened Steve to realize just how well he’d gotten to know Tony, that he knew what his contemplative expression looked like, and how often he’d have to have been looking at him to judge his moods by his facial expressions.
Thor and Steve ended up in wrestling match which might have gone better had Steve been using his shield and not a mock up as the hammer shattered it on the first swing Thor gave, then the two got into headlocks and tried to throw each-other down, giving Clint and Natasha the opportunity to take out their opposing team mates, leaving just the two of them against each other, while Bruce, laughing tried to keep out of their way as they took shots at each-other and tried to beat one another to getting to him. In the final lap they both ran at break neck speed, flinging themselves at Bruce while simultaneously shooting each-other.
“Shut up.” Howard said to him, as he filled a needle and took hold of the baby’s left arm pinching the skin at the elbow to bring up the vein. The infant’s sobs grew louder at the pain but Howard ignored them, sinking the needle into the infant’s skin and emptying the syringe.
Steve walked confidently down the red carpet, having clearly experienced this sort of thing in his own world, but was not so cocksure or arrogant as to forget to smile to those who called his name, or to raise a hand to wave.
Tony was getting to his wits end, having had practically no sleep as he’d been staying at Zach’s bedside for most of the time, and had already dealt with several smaller tantrums over having Zach’s hands mitted to keep him from scratching and scarring himself. Poor Zach, while bright for his age, was too young to understand that what Tony was doing for him was for his own good, all he knew was that his body ached and itched and he wasn’t allowed to relieve it and was being covered in a funny lotion that he didn’t like, had to take medicine he didn’t like, and was now being made to sit in a bath full of soggy oats.
Peter was another matter. He was too old to be fobbed off, he couldn’t be so easily distracted, he knew that there was something going on and it was inevitable that he would ask, so Happy and Bruce were not surprised when he approached them, leaving Zach engrossed in his colouring on the floor before a Dr Who DVD.
Thor chuckled, “Twas the closest water source.” He said, “However I think it would be wise for us to return to the hospital.” He stood up and offered his hand to Zach who took it, getting to his feet somewhat shakily, “It will be alright little one.” Thor assured him, lifting the boy up into his arms and holding him to his chest, “Now, would you like to hold Mjolnir with me?”
“We’ve found a lot, more than I want to go into tonight.” Bruce said, “It is also highly likely that Maximoff is still having an influence on Tony, we want to run some brain scans to try and prove this, once we find what area of is brain is affected we can start looking into blocking her.”
“Yes lag-brain. And there was some messed up shit on there. Like crazy ass experiments. Stuff to make hybrids, and I don’t mean Cockapoos or Ligers and stuff, but like breeding cross bred animals for like military use.”
His little sister Emma was jealous at first, until she was gifted half a dozen new dolls with accessories and a custom made doll house from Tony. At this her face lit up and she threw her arms about his waist hugging him as tightly as she could.
Of course, that was the black and white view his child self had, when he’d been wiping blood from his nose after Howard’s fist had struck again. He had yet to go to college and be exposed to endless supplies of alcohol and drugs, had yet to meet Ty Stone and find himself date raped by the sack of shit.
The uncommon but possible side effects were worse, anaphylactic shock being the most lethal of course.
“In normal households feather-heads don’t stuff themselves with enough food to feed ten people.” Natasha told him, waving the butter knife threateningly.
Slowing, Steve waited for Tony to catch up with him, “C’mon you’ve got to run faster.” He urged the Omega, but Tony shook his head and Steve heard the tell tale rattle as Tony struggled to breathe, his respirations coming harder and faster in desperation to draw in air and he recalled Tony telling him that his lung capacity was reduced.
With their business complete they headed back to New York to start getting the planet ready for war, begin Bucky’s therapy, and prepare for Rogers and Natasha’s trials.
“Armin Zola.” He said glancing to Tony, “A Nazi scientist captured during the war, but he died years ago.”
Tony shook his head, “She didn’t like that Peggy was close to me, or that her parents consulted with me over residential care for Peggy when her condition became too severe for them to handle caring for her at home. She felt that it was a betrayal that they put her in a home instead of caring for her themselves, even though they weren’t remotely qualified to do so, and Peggy was becoming a danger to herself.” At Steve’s look of alarm Tony quickly went on, “She’d go out for walks and forget where she was and what she was doing, the Police brought her back more than once, and she was mugged by some asshole who took advantage of her. She also set fire the kitchen by accident, she forgot that she’d left the oven on, thankfully a neighbour saw the smoke and alerted the fire department, but it could have been very serious.”
"Well just because Peter Stark is well again isn't going to stop the investigations. He was still injured and ended up in hospital as the result, you could be sued for psychological trauma as well as for the cost of medical bills, and OSHA are insisting on a full investigation, your own insurance company is insisting on investigations being carried out, they won't pay unless the building and labs pass all safety checks." The PA let out a shriek as Norman threw his coffee cup at the wall, the ceramic mug shattering on impact and hot coffee spilled down the wall.
“Indeed they did, especially Wanda’s.” Jarvis confirmed, “There is a lot of footage of her, most of which I suggest you do not view as it is….disturbing to say the least, especially when she is using her powers on her test subjects.” The team grimaced, if an AI found the footage disturbing that it had to be horrific, “Other tests revealed that Wanda became especially volatile when shown images of Sir, dangerously volatile to any around her.”
Lily’s demanding cries served to bring Steve out of his reverie, and he bent down into the cot, lifting her up, “What’s wrong with her?”
“Very good.” Friday said initiating the launch of twelve legionnaires into space ordering them to take up position around the planet to keep guard. Six of them she set about the tower and upon the roof to guard the tower from threats. The last six she sent with Jarvis as he took flight heading for Prague.
“Good, because I don’t want till jumping up and down at midnight.” As he said this Tony was munching on a donut, the sugar getting all over his beard and moustache. Steve snickered,
The day before it had been science, learning elements from the periodic table, both the letters that represented them and what the elements were used for, where they were found, and what type of element they were.
Steve nodded, if the worst that came out of this was a headache then they could consider themselves lucky. He stroked Peter’s hair wishing the boy would wake up, wished Zach were with them, wished Tony was with them and none of this nightmare had happened.
Peter and Zach had collected a good amount of wood which would keep them going through the night. Steve impressed them by ripping apart several large logs with his bare hands and then took the boys into the lake for a quick dip before the sun started to set.
“Oh my God!” Grace cried in horror as Zach sped across the garden laughing gleefully, nearly tipping off as he was turned left and sent zooming towards the house then almost sent head first into the wall as the breaks were hit, then he came backwards, his legs nearly going over his head as the breaks were hit again and finally he zoomed towards the adults, Peter managing to break just in time or he’d have crashing into their shins.
At first he felt nothing, just his body being lowered down, then as Steve’s cock went deeper he began to feel a pressure inside himself, a vague sense of stretching until finally…
“The cops can’t protect you from Ross.” Tony said, “Not even witness protection will keep you safe from him.”
Peter scuffed his foot on the lab floor, “You were right though I was showing off and shouldn’t have been.”
“I was and still am an artist. During my down time I would sketch a lot, even doing caricatures of myself and the Howling Commandos. Creating comic book adventures for us. My friend Bucky decided they were good enough to publish and sent them off to the New York Times, who liked them so much the ran a strip in the paper, which eventually became weekly comic books, dubbed Captain America.”
Tony frowned, “I know this road,” he murmured, leaning forward, his eyes widening as he saw his parents car appear and be run off the road into a tree by a man on a motorbike. “Oh God,” he whispered, a hand rising to clutch at his throat, as he watched with growing horror, as Howard staggered from the car, running around to the passenger side to help Maria, only to attacked by a man he addressed as “Sergeant Barnes”
“Certainly Sir, and may I congratulate you on successfully wrangling two less than pleasant parental episodes today.”
Okay this is the last update until after the 1st of September as I am going to be without internet for a while in my new flat. Once that is sorted I'll be back to regular updates. Hope everyone is doing well and staying safe. <3
“And get in touch with Natasha and Fury.” Tony said, regretting that his phone had been left in the car and Steve’s at the hotel on charge. “Hopefully Sam’s got a computer he won’t mind me borrowing.”
“You don’t have to stay here.” He said to Steve as he got up onto the bed, Zach immediately snuggling against him. “You can go and enjoy the beach, have another swim, you don’t need to spoil your holiday for me.”
Steve beamed and put on a show of pride for Zach and Peter while praising their hard work in making the raft.
At first everything went well as they bombarded each other with frozen projectiles, Clint had incredible aim but Natasha had impossible stealth and speed. At one point Steve had Zach up on his shoulders and the little boy was throwing snowballs at Tony and Peter who made a big show of struggling to dodge them, that was when disaster struck.
With tears in his eyes Tony would finally stumble on Steve, his broken, dying Alpha who’s own shield had been driven through his chest.
“TONY!” Steve’s voice suddenly came online and Tony’s heart flipped over, all he could feel was relief, never mind what had happened before, all that mattered now was getting his baby out of this hell hole.
“Well something was tingling, if you know what I mean,” Wade replied, “But then it often does when I think of that Stark ripe piece of ass!”
Thankfully the placenta had protected Zach and it wasn’t being passed on through the milk, but it was killing Tony, poisoning his blood.
A strange look came over the man, one of fear. The asset knew fear, he had seen it on his victims faces many times, he could practically smell it these days.
“Then again, the mental age of some of our team mates might be just around Zach’s age.” Tony drawled, making Steve chuckle and pull him into a kiss; neither of them aware of the spectators in the Sky scrapper opposite them, taking pictures on their phone.
“Ha, no pain, no gain.” Clint said picking of bunkers and tanks with the cannon as Natasha floored the accelerator and somehow still managed to steer them through the trees.
“Or you don’t deserve to have your life ruined by my injury.” Peter said giving Tony a knowing look. Little brat.
“Sorry about Zach catching you off guard like that.” He apologised, “He came and landed on me at dawn wanting to know if he could call you Daddy.”
As one they moved, hurling themselves at Thanos, aiming the power of the repulsors and mind stone at Thanos’ shoulder.
“Yep, s’in my backpack.” Zach proudly pointed to his Iron Man backpack which was stuffed with toys, books, and other items to keep him occupied.
Natasha huffed and pushed Tony’s head back with her fingertips and proceeded to put mascara on him whether he liked it or not. “Stop blinking you’re going to look like a panda!”
“Vehicles have been here recently.” Steve observed as they crossed the gravel and dirt noting the tire tracks.
“Bucky!” Rogers cried, getting to his feet and running towards him, “I’ve missed you so…” That was as far as he got before Bucky’s metal fist was meeting his face.
“That’ll never happen.” Tony said giving Steve a lobsided grin, “Besides, if they did then it would mean I wasn’t relevant anymore and if I’m not making headlines what would that do for my playboy image?”
“I’m a superhero Pete!” Zach declared, lifting his head so he could look at his brother, his eyes were shining with pride and a huge smile was on his face as he spoke. “I’m Fire Cracker. I defted the bad guy and saved Mamma.”
Natasha was besides him, dragging herself along the ground with her hands, pulling her ruined legs behind her leaving a trail of blood in her wake, when she lifted her head to look at Tony, blood poured out of her mouth, a thick crimson flood that soaked the ground beneath her.
“Shut up Stark and hold still.” Natasha said as she got the setting power ready and brushed it under his eyes.
Steve kept tight hold of him, shielding him with his broad chest and muscular arms, while trying not to growl at the fact that Tony was shaking like a leaf against him.
“He made it personal.” Suddenly it made sense, the lightbulb clicking on inside Tony’s head, “He hit us right where we live, and why?”
There was an endless amount to go through, and with him not being an Avenger anymore he had more time to spare on them, especially on the Winter Soldier, whom he was still trying to search for.
“You’re grounded.” MJ’s Mother said, “For two months, and no internet unless its for school, no mobile, no allowance except for sanitary towels…”
Sitting on the bed the two took it in turns at cleaning and bandaging injuries, Steve was healing quickly, once the dried blood was washed away it was clear to see that the wounds were scabbing over and bruising was coming out, they would likely be healed in a day or two where Tony would be looking at weeks to recover.
“No, not that, the… flirting and breaking all that tension.” Steve said, “I thought I’d choke on my tongue, but you just handled it without batting an eye.”
So he passed Zach to Pepper when he decided to step out and get some air, which was when the thought struck him…
Bruce look up from his scientific journal which he had been buried in until now, “Not too much junk food, your Mamma will kill us if we don’t send you back to him healthy.”
“Maybe for a while.” Tony said, “But I’ve been thinking about building a tower in Manhattan. Once it’s ready we’ll move into the penthouse, but that’ll take a while, so we can stay here until then.”
“Good God Jarvis, I leave you in charge and look what happens.” The Billionaire sighed looking at the devastation.
“Sweetheart?” He greeted making his way over to Tony. “What’s wrong?” he asked, wrapping his arms about Tony’s waist and pressed himself flush against Tony’s back, placing a kiss onto the sensitive skin on the back of Tony’s neck.
It was adorable and so moving, the way Zach earnestly looked up at him, those impossible chocolate eyes pleading with him to say yes, while his little body vibrated with excitement.
Rhodey would soon have to head back to work, the military wouldn’t grant him leave for much longer and Tony would never allow Rhodey to risk his career.
“For me too.” Steve murmured, waiting for Tony to relax, but as he said those words a horrible thought came into Tony’s mind.
Steve knew this, he really did know this, so he shouldn’t have been surprised when he reached the shooting range and found Tony pushing a live grenade into a water melon and then running like hell just before the thing exploded in a shower of fruit and seeds.
A Paralympian Gold Medallist gave the encouraging message of “A disability is only a disability if you let it disable you.”
Zach let out a bellow of rage, fire blazing up his arms and heat radiating off him fierce enough to scorch the flesh from several feet away.
He updated his will, Zach would inherit everything at twenty-one, save for some generous bequests to Pepper, Rhodey, Happy, and the Maria Stark relief foundation.
It was a rather unusual experience for Tony. To be on the arm of someone, rather than having someone on his arms for an event. Though Pepper could never be described as Arm Candy and he would never do her the disservice of calling her such.
Steve kindly put a tray together for Tony to have once he surfaced and made sure there was enough coffee to sate his lover.
Tony looked at him incredulously, “You just saved my life Cap, you’ve never let me down, I’ve let you down, I let the team down. I should have been stronger, I shouldn’t have let Wanda get control of me like that.”
“Can you feel this too?” Steve chuckled bucking his hips up making Tony keen loudly, and shudder in such a way that it had his cock jerking of its own accord. “I don’t think I’m gonna last long baby.” He admitted, a little embarrassed that he would likely be coming after a few thrusts like a teenage boy who’d just learned what sex was, but after three months with only his own hand in the shower for company while having to keep an ear out for Zach was a long time.
Curien didn’t think so, he was a scientist, a mathematician, the numbers made sense to him, the benefit outweighed the cost, and one day, when people were living with perfectly healthy bodies, having perfectly healthy children, and the human race had been advanced by a thousand years, they would see that he was right too and would praise him for his bravery.
“The energy, it is constantly in motion, constantly surging like the heart of a star.” He stretched out his hand not quite making contact with the orb within the sceptre, but traced his fingers over the flickering energy ball like someone running their fingers through a flame. “Like the heart of a star it contains great power and the potential to beget life.” A slow cruel smile twisted his features, “Or to alter lives and bodies.”
Pepper paused here, letting the reporters and journalists take their notes, shock was what most seemed to be feeling, that and disgust at Peter’s ordeal, she’d heard many gasps and moans of horror at the mention of the vivisection and severed bones. Enhanced or not, Peter was a child, no one could support such actions taken against a child, or anyone for that matter. She could hope that their horror would have them writing sympathetically, especially when she wasn’t done with the revelations yet.
“So, what, they said they’d get you off them?” Tony asked looking about the shit hole the dumbass was living in.
"Okay I'll Natasha and ask her to get him." Steve said, taking his phone out of his pocket and swiping the screen, he brought up his contacts and called Natasha who answered after a single ring.
Bruce’s cheeks were glowing by now and not green but red, at the back of his mind Hulk was rumbling with laughter, the oversized bastard was enjoying Bruce’s discomfort!
Both schools were apologetic for the boys suspensions and after Tony and Steve assured them of Zach and Peter’s behaviour, both boys were allowed back into school.
“And with additional electrical stimulus and robotics to the joints, the legs will be able to function as if you are walking normally.”
“And when the stars come out we can go star gazing.” Steve said cupping the back of her head, “We’ll look for the constellations and try to see a shooting star, no doubt your Mamma will tell you that it’s a fragment of a meteor on the earths atmosphere, but we’ll know better, won’t we Morgan?” Steve met Tony’s eyes with a grin.
“Hmm Rescue Sex, that has potential.” Tony mused, “I think I could be a pretty good Princess; we’ve already got the tower so that part of the fairy tale setting is sorted, Jarvis can be the Evil Step-Mother/Witch, you cool with that J?”
It seemed to have taken time, minutes at least, but in fact it was seconds at the most before he was face down on the ground and struggling to breathe.
“Uh, his first name is actually Agent.” Tony informed her, “And he can’t stay as we’re having family night.”
That was the red rag to the bull, Rogers leaped forward, throwing his shield at Tony, who was unceremoniously shoved out of the way by Steve, who the shield in one hand and brought it back around in time to smash across Roger’s face, knocking the smaller version to the ground.
Steve stood behind Tony, placing one hand on Tony's shoulder while the other covered Tony and Peter's entwined hands, "Come on Pete, you've got to wake up. Zach need's his big Brother, and I need my best Man."
“She invaded my company and my home under false pretences.” Tony said, finally settling on the lexus and heading for the car, “It was back when I was dying of palladium poisoning.”
He was right, Tony knew he was right, but damn it, he wanted this, he wanted to give Steve a baby so badly and his body wouldn’t do it. There was too much damage from previous injuries for him to conceive a baby, and even if he did, there was no guarantee his womb would even be strong enough to carry the child to term.
“Identity confirmed, bossman, where are you, the Colonel and the Avengers have a Skrull in custody whom they are interrogating.”
“Peter says that they fluff wit’ each-other but don’t tell each-other that they like them like that. Why is that?” Zach asked frowning in the most adorable way, “And when I asked Mamma if Steef will be my Daddy if they get married he said that it wouldn’t happen, but it has to happen! If people like each-other they get married, like Roary and Amy, and River and the Doctor, so Mamma and Steef have to get married.”
“We will, but not yet.” Fury said, “We’ll go tonight, or rather the early hours of tomorrow morning, when the guards are sleepy and won’t be paying much attention. Two am, meet us at West Potomac park and don’t be late.” He said the last to Tony who give him a ‘who me?’ look.
Once they were all secured the pilots soon got clearance and took off, the flight attendants coming around with drinks and snacks and setting up the TV with The Hobbit for them all to watch throughout the flight.
“You are not beating him.” She growled, “Leave him be.” Her eyes flashed dangerously at him and the man grumbled, letting his arm drop.
He’d yet to lose his parents to a car accident because Howard had been driving pissed out of his skull.
The team that Tony had described did not sound like the dysfunctional family that he had known in his world. Family really had been the best way to describe them. Tony had been equal parts the Mum and eccentric Uncle, depending on his mood and the amount of sleep he’d had.
“I know we now live in a time when slapping a child on the backside is considered wrong, but there is a difference between abuse and discipline!”
Steve snorted at that, “I’ll have to listen to it and get back to you.” He said, “But I thought you liked that one from Notting Hill.”
“No, she’s been disrupted enough for today, stay with her at the hotel and I’ll call you.” Tony called back to Steve ignoring the impatient huffing from the Cop as his conversations held them up,
Spotting a cannon where three Hydra soldiers which three Hydra soldiers were loading up and preparing to take aim on Sam, Tony fired down on them, blowing it up. “Thor we’ve got cannons and long range missile defences to take out, they will be on the banks around the castle perimeter can you handle that?”
“Plus he was doing crazy shit there!” Ned piped up, his eyes widened when he realised that he’d sworn, “I mean stuff, I meant to say stuff!”
“So why not an element not known to man.” Natasha suggested heading for the front door where Shield agents were bringing in boxes.
He wasn’t in the best position to be doing this, it was awkward and he didn’t have a good hold of his leg which dropped heavily down onto the bed making him rock and bump into Steve interrupting the moment.
“And you aren’t getting any trouble from any other kids?” Steve knew that other kids often didn’t support those that told parents and teachers about bullying seeing it as “Narcing” but he hoped that Peter wasn’t suffering such ostracizing.
“No one is coming for you.” Doctor Curien said getting a pair of bone cutters ready to cut through Peter’s ribs, “Not in time to save you anyway.”
Tony was laying face down on the ground in a pool of blood, he wasn’t moving, wasn’t calling out for help, he was just laying there motionless as the thick red pool spread out beneath him.
Steve rolled his eyes and took Tony’s hand, leading him out onto the dance floor and began to lead them through the foxtrot with a great deal of practised ease.
“Why though, people love the avengers.” Ned said yelping when MJ slapped him, “Jeez woman why are you so mean?”
Every night since her Brother’s death Wanda had been reached out with her powers and invading Tony’s mind, plucking his darkest fears out of his subconscious and bringing them to the surface, making them haunt his sleep so that every dream was a nightmare.
As Alpha’s went Tony supposed Obie could be worse, he wasn’t beaten or anything like that, but there was no tenderness, no love. Sex was brief, rough, and generally restricted to his heats, except when Obie was feeling a little frisky, although thanks to his age that was few and far between.
How had he not known, how could he not have known? He’d been living with this thing for months now, he should have known that something was wrong, should have seen something, a sign that it wasn’t Tony, that it was a Skrull he was living with, but he hadn’t noticed, no one had noticed anything was wrong until the thunder storm had hit and the lightning had struck while Tony had been working on the electrics. He’d been shocked, should have been killed or at the very least serious injured, but instead his true form had been revealed.
“It’ll be alright little one.” Maya said settling herself into the seat besides Zach, “No one is going to hurt you, I promise.”
From across the table Steve offered him a reassuring smile. Tony’s relationship or lack thereof with Howard had left him pretty messed up, so Tony was speaking from experience when it came to such things.
The Principal smiled at Peter, “Truly, this behaviour was very out of character for Peter and I very much doubt anything of the like will happen again.”
The timid question came from across the room, from Peter, pulling everyone’s attention to him. Steve lifted his head from Natasha’s shoulder to look at the pale faced teen who stepped forward, rubbing his nose on his sleeve and sniffing as he did.
Winter was still a part of him, a separate personality, but not one that could take control. The psychiatrists called it Dissociative Identity Disorder, Bucky just called it the voice in his mind.
Some were adamant that it would be long term; because Cap is an old fashioned guy and wouldn’t just have a casual hook up or a fling. Others said that he would do so because he’d never gotten the chance to experience sexual liberation back in the forties. More argued that it wouldn’t last because Tony was “all wrong” for Cap. He was too much older, too selfish, too demanding, too childish, an alcoholic (Apparently they hadn’t realised Tony had been dry for four years)
“I’ll come with you.” Tony said with a significant look at Steve, “I need to check some things out in the lab anyway.”
He leaned over Tony’s shoulder trying to understand the code that Tony was typing in, it looked like gibberish to him, just random letters and numbers.
They knew, thank God, at least something was going right. Although…when did the Avengers get back, weren’t they wanted fugitives? Tony shook his head, he didn’t have time to think about that.
That would be difficult for Peter to deal with, but for Zach it would be devastating, he was such a tactile and friendly boy that to be denied contact with others to be isolated from friends would be an act of torture.
At Two pm dinner was served, without any major culinary disasters and soon the dishes were brought in and plates were loaded with meat, vegetables and condiments, crackers were pulled and stupid jokes were read out followed by groans and paper crowns were put on heads as everyone enjoyed their dinner.
“RTA, struck by a car on the right side of the body, trauma to the lower right limbs, recent trauma to the upper left limb, head trauma, and gun shot wound to the abdomen.” One of the paramedics reported. “Unconscious at the scene, has received ten ccs of morphine, BP 90/40 and dropping, pulse is rapid and thready.”
“If I’m careful can I tie Dad’s bike on the roof of the car and see if I can lift them both together?” Peter asked then his eyes widened, “Hey you could sit on the bike, it’ll be like recreating when Dad lifted the bike with the show girls, only better.”
He nearly broke when Rhodey asked him about the rash on his neck, nearly told him the truth, but he just managed to hold his tongue and change the subject, talking about his birthday party instead.
Was it a good thing that it was taking this long? It had to be didn’t it, it meant that there was something that the doctors could do for Tony.
“I wouldn’t dream of it, Mr Stark,” Steve promised, pulling Tony close to him, “Just relax, you’re safe with me,” he whispered into the billionaires ear, making Tony shiver in delight.
Peter shook his head, “Not your fault, that guy Hammer and the Russian did it, not you.” He looked over Tony’s shoulder and Tony looked behind him, seeing a couple of people in suits talking to the Doctor. “They gonna put me in a home.” Peter said, “Some place for the kids no one wants.”
Peter gagged and tried to spit the tube out, his large eyes staring at Steve and Tony as they continued to speak to him, urging him to lay still and promising him everything was going to be alright. After what seemed like an eternity, the Doctor and nurses arrived, pushing Tony and Steve aside so they could assess Peter and get the tube out of his throat. Peter gagged and coughed as it came away, sucking in lungfuls of air and feeling like he'd swallowed a razor.
“We’re sure its Hydra who has the sceptre then?” Steve asked, “Not that I am doubting it, they are the mostly likely suspects, but is there any other outfit that would or could do this?”
“Bite me Tin Can.” Clint shot back flipping Tony the bird, as he bounced Lily, and blew raspberries at her.
“Mamma!” Zach’s plaintive cry echoed in his head and he saw himself lunging forward trying to grab hold of Zach only to have his son turn to ashes in his hands.
“Married?” It was Maximoff who spoke now, as Rogers slumped back in his seat, shock upon his face. “You married Stark?” she spat, pointing a finger at Tony, who recoiled immediately, pressed Lily close to his body, and turning so his shoulders was facing her shielding the baby from the Witch’s ire.
“Aye.” Thor said, while he had never treated a human in the battle field he had assisted many Asgardian warriors with their injuries and knew how to stem a bleed. Placing his large hand over the wound he pressed down firmly while Bruce got a BP cuff around Tony’s arm and inflated it, clucking his tongue at the reading and then took his pulse.
“He can.” Tony corrected, “He can use Peter’s lashing out as grounds. Social Services would be obligated to investigate and once those bastards get a toe in the door, getting rid of them is almost impossible.” He turned to look at Steve, pulling his legs up to his chest, “They could take Zach too, if they find me unfit, then both of Son’s will be taken and I won’t be allowed contact until they are eighteen.”
Rogers watched Tony’s car pull away, from a window in the compound. He scowled as he saw the flashy red Aston Martin (One of the few cars Tony had that could fit two people and a baby) going up the drive.
It was after one such nightmare and Tony was staggering to the kitchen to get a cup of peppermint tea to try and clear his head that he ran into Captain America, or rather Steve Roger’s looking as haunted as Tony felt.
He couldn’t exactly make sexy poses or jump on Steve like he used to do, he wasn’t even really sure if sex was going to be possible for them anymore, well, it would, Steve could still fuck him, but he didn’t know if he’d actually get any satisfaction from it.
After dinner the team took it easy, wanting to be at full strength for the mission the following day.
“Holy shit!” Tony breathed in shocked horror, he and Steve watched as booted feet impacted on the front of the car, a figure with a metal arm coming into view. The figure was male, with shoulder length dark hair, his face concealed by a mask and his body covered in some kind of tactical suit. He stared at them, what was visible of his face completely blank and emotionless, the eyes hollow empty orbs that reflected nothing.
“They bet that you were having sex.” Natasha said without looking up from where she was sharping an already deadly looking blade. “Sam said that you wouldn’t be doing so, as you were, and I quote, “Sporting Stark’s teeth marks on his throat this morning, when we went for our run. They can’t possibly be doing it again already.” Clint compared you both to nymphomaniacal rabbits in heat who have been fed viagra.”
Steve released him and stepped back looking bashful, “Sorry, I just didn’t know how best to thank you.”
Steve kept the fact he was doing an interview a secret from Tony because he knew that the Omega would try to talk him out of it or insist on joining him.
“I don’t care.” Steve replied mercilessly working his way through the soldiers, “So long as they and Tony are healthy.”
“He looks like you.” Steve said, “He clearly takes after you.” Again Tony seemed to become uncomfortable.
Pepper will probably be Mum to you. She might not get it all perfect at first but she’ll do her best and she’ll never let you go without or suffer. So you make sure you let her know how great she is and how much you love her.
Tony spent the next few months planning for his death and trying to cope with his increasingly toxic blood.
Tony stared down at Steve quite taken off guard by this, he couldn’t say he was opposed to the idea, but he was also aware of the issues involved, the difficulties they may face if not out right impossibilities.
In truth Curien wasn’t surprised, he’d known the damage was bad, he’d not received the best treatment going to a free clinic and only getting a basic patch up when he’d needed surgery right away, having also been hit by a car and sent rolling down the road it was little wonder the damaged has been exacerbated.
Steve’s eyes were on him, baby blue orbs beneath a furrowed brow were searching him out and Tony gave him a weak smile, raising his mug in a mocking salute, “To us basket cases and our fucked up nightmares.”
If he stayed here, if he didn’t feel for a pulse then he could at least keep a hold of his dreams for a little bit longer, just a few more seconds…. Then he was moving, he was running because he heard the tiniest most pitiful moan echo in the chamber and he knew he had not made it himself.
Tony wanted to scream, wanted to fight, he wanted to hold his baby inside him and keep it there until they were safe, but he couldn’t, when the contraction came, he couldn’t do anything but let nature take its course. This contraction had barely finished before the next one hit and he hardly had a chance to drag in a gulp of air before he was pushing again and then the pain was gone and… the most beautiful sound was filling the air, his baby was crying for the first time!
“You need to rest.” Steve said, but Tony was adamant, refusing to try to sleep as he wouldn’t be able to settle, not when he was so worked up over Peter.
Dressed in a three-piece suit that fitted like a glove, Tony walked into the conference hall of the United Nations and resisted the urge to wet his lips or shudder as he felt every single eye upon himself. All 193 representatives were looking at him as he took the stand.
“The party.” Tony said heading for the War machine armour, “I don’t wanna do it. I want to be with my family, the people I love, not some spoiled asshole looking to get wasted on my dime.” Breathing deeply to try and fight the nausea he was feeling, Tony gave the War Machine face plate and pat, “You know, I’m in the mood for Lord of the Rings, and in the spirit of Hobbit culture, I’m going to give away gifts instead of receiving them.” He turned with a bright grin and beckoned Rhodey over, “My gift to you. War Machine.”
Steve hadn’t meant to fall asleep, but the rhythmic sound of Tony’s breathing and the warmth of the bed had lulled him into sleep. He was jolted awake as Friday called out to him.
Steve’s shoulder made short work of the door and he burst into the bathroom, Bruce, and May behind him, looking concerned.
“The big guy is better than a battering ram any day, we’ll just throw him that door and he’ll bring down half the wall with it.”
With a sigh Tony archived the e-mails, planning to look into the pre-schools when he returned to New York. He’d get Pepper’s opinion too, and Happy and Rhodey’s. He would need to thoroughly check out the security of the schools before he sent Zach there.
Shouldering his bag Steve went around the corner to the car park where his bike awaited him, one other possession that had survived through to the twenty-first century. He took pleasure in revving the engine before he pulled out of the car park, pleased that he’d let Happy head back to Stark Tower without him as it meant he had the freedom riding his Motorbike always brought him.
Because of this, the Doctor tends to focus more on movement and strength rather than cardio based activities.”
“Okay, firstly, skip going for a drink completely, I don’t know if he told you, but Tony’s been sober now for nearly four years, he won’t want to change that. As for how fancy it should be, aim for something romantic but relaxed. Tony would be most appreciative of a meal in a family run restaurant, where people dine wearing jeans with a smart shirt and tailored jacket. Smart casual, understand?” Steve nodded, “Getting him a bouquet of flowers is great, no ones done that for him before so he’ll appreciate the gesture and the novelty, don’t worry about having to give fancy gifts or expensive gestures, he’d much prefer something meaningful and from the heart, making him a coffee and a sandwich while he working in the lab for instance. Other dates you might consider, going for coffee and cake, walks in the park, take the kids to the beach, that’s the kind of thing he’d really enjoy, especially family outings because Howard…” Rhodey broke off not wanting to colour Steve’s opinion of Howard but Steve shook his head,
“And do they give you any respect?” Tony asked as a laughing Steve lifted him off the sofa and carried him towards the lift, “You remember young man, I have fed you, and clothed you, raised and nurtured you so you could become Spideyman!”
“Lies, slanderous lies, I have never seen that Chick Flick in my life Steven, how can you suggest such a thing!”
From the tire, where Steve had sat Zach next to Peter, the boys laughed and clapped as Thor came up spitting water and hair in his face.
Natasha rose and eyebrow and dropped down from where she’d been doing pull ups. “Pleasure.” She said getting into the ring.
Deeper and deeper he swam, forcing himself to go further into the cove, frantically searching for Tony, ignoring the burn in his own lungs, ignoring the need to breathe, ignoring everything but finding him.
“Defeated.” Tony corrected, ruffling Zach’s hair and bent to kiss Peter, “How you feeling baby?” He asked him clucking his tongue over Peter’s complexion, which to his eye was too pale and he didn’t like the dark circles beneath Peter’s eyes either.
Clint wolf whistled when Steve and Tony returned from the diner and Sam gave Steve an appreciative once over chuckling at the puffed up chest and smug look on the Alpha’s face.
“And it would have been a cracking good time!” Deadpool declared, completely unrepentant, “And speaking of crack, want me to go and shove my swords between your scrawny twins crack?” this was directed at Steve who opened his mouth, sighed and just gave up with a groan.
Clint wrinkled his nose, “Thor is retelling some Asgardian battle, the last time he did that he used me a prop, I got stood on me head, tossed over his shoulder, and hung by my ankles!”
Tony met Steve in the hospital corridor and leaped up into his arms, wrapping his legs about his waist and clung onto him like a demented koala bear, attacking his mouth with all the fierceness of an octopus.
“Exactly.” Steve said, “I left a time where the black soldiers weren’t permitted to share the same ablutions as the white soldiers, where it was considered perfectly normal and even healthy to beat a misbehaving child with a belt, where homosexuals were prosecuted and faced either imprisonment or being declared insane and put into an asylum.
“Enough!” Steve bellowed his shout being enough to cut off Tony’s rant, “That is enough.” He said in a calmer tone, “You need to stop doing this to yourself, thinking of yourself this way, it isn’t right and it isn’t true Tony.”
“Next time you’re pissed off, just punch a wall honey, Okay? It might do you less damage!” he quipped, getting a weak chuckle from Tony,
“Well, I have a broken bone in my arm which is going to take time healing,” Tony explained, “This cast helps protect and support my arm while it heals.”
Then not only would her former masters in Russia be after her, but the USA and possibly the UN. That left very few countries she could bolt to, and none of them really places she wanted to go.
The first thing Steve did was take a selfie of him and Tony snuggling and posted it on Facebook, the put out the Tweet #Thisislove.
By now Natasha had limped over to Rogers, who was watching Tony intently, ready in case he started fighting again. Sam still held back. He was in shock himself. Never had he thought that Steve Rogers would do something so twisted as to hide the murder of someone’s parents from them. He could not possibly fathom a logical reason for it, to remotely justify Rogers and Romanoff’s actions.
Desperately he tried to find an alternative power source for the arc reactor, but nothing else was compatible.
“After three months without you in my arms can you blame me?” Steve asked lifting Tony up and supporting him while he got his cock lined up, “Promise to tell me if you feel any discomfort.” He said looking Tony in the eye to ensure that the Omega knew he was serious,
Bruce sighed heavily, “It’s a risk I know. But you are both adults, and I’m sure, even if it doesn’t work, you’ll find a way to stay friends. What you have to ask yourself is if you are willing to sacrifice what might be the best relationship you’ll ever have just to stay safe. Or if you have the courage to take the chance and find happiness.”
“What of the Baron?” Thor asked changing the subject, “We should also focus on finding him should we not.”
Steve was more than ready for a shower and then a long sleep in bed and wasted no time in stripping off. It was as he was taking off his uniform that a folded up piece of paper fell from one of the pockets and landed by his feet. Bending Steve picked it up and opened it, his eyes widening when he saw that the writing was his own, his shock increasing as he read the contents.
On the edge…? Steve bolted out of bed and through the penthouse, running out onto the balcony and the landing pad, his blood running cold when he saw Tony standing right on the edge, his toes actually hanging over the edge and his body swaying back and forth.
“You will find this much less painful if you tell me.” Doctor Curien said, reaching behind him he picked up a scalpel and tapped it against Peter’s cheek, “I can get the knowledge myself without your cooperation, but it will be far more unpleasant for you if I have to do so.”
Steve didn’t know if Omega’s and Female Betas had spoken about sex like that, if they had shared stories of conquests like their Alpha and male beta counterparts. He’d figured not, as there was the great risk of an unmarried pregnancy and it was still expected that a female Beta or an Omega would be a virgin on their wedding night. Whether or not they really were was questionable, but it was what society had expected they be, or at least seem to be.
“Yes,” Tony said, pointing at Rhodey, “Yes I hit my head, I’ve hit my everything and what I’ve said was true, the question is, what are they doing here?” He pointed to Clint and Natasha.
Steve blinked, “Really?” He knew that the team had an Avengers Facebook and Twitter accounts, Tony’s PR had set them up and did most of the work on them, with Tony, Clint, and Natasha only occasionally adding to them. He knew that Tony had his own accounts as well, and he suspected they others, possibly with the exception of Bruce since he wasn’t really into social media, also had their own. But he had never thought of having his own.
Proxima went down and one of the Hyena’s flew at Bucky, getting webbed by Peter before its jaws could land on him, “OHMYGOD they’re Wargs, there are wargs!” Peter cried,
Since the press conference the world had, at least for the most part been respectful of Tony’s injuries. There had been a lot of shock which was to be expected, distress and sympathy for Tony, there had been an increase of gifts for Tony at the hospital and around Avengers Tower.
Fury opened his mouth to speak and then thought better of it, turning to the Doctor who cleared his throat.
“I forgot how much I enjoyed swimming.” Tony said turning over and treading water, he was still feeling a little anxious but in control, he knew he was alright and could easily get back to shore, he wasn’t going to drown.
At dusk they all returned to the villa for showers and a change of clothes and they fired up the BBQ that Tony had out on the patio. While Tony wasn’t that much of a cook he was able to manage a BBQ, and proceeded to cook up burgers, steaks, sausages, ribs, haloumi cheese, and corn on the cob, which Natasha and Bruce sliced buns, mixed together potato salad, and some salad vegetables.
“I am upset, very upset. I am being betrayed by my friend, my Pepperoni. My Peppercorn is telling me I’m fat.”
As she grew more accustomed to the intricacies of Tony’s mind she found it easier and easier to manipulate him, prompting his subconscious into causing hallucinations, making him doubt himself, bringing each and every insecurity Tony had to the surface and letting them devour him.
“Umm Bossman?” Friday asked, hesitantly, “There is an Asian Gentleman in the front lobby asking for permission to access the penthouse. It seems he knows Mr Deadpool.”
That was an obvious change of subject, clearly Tony didn’t want to talk about it and Steve didn’t know the man well enough yet to push for information. He climbed onto the bike and started the engine, “You do know that the City is still in shambles.” He said,
“Okay, so first thing in the morning, we get burner phones and start trying to contact Natasha.” Tony said, “J, will keep us updated on what’s going on with Shield and Hydra, Shieldra? That has so got to become a thing, I am officially making that a thing. Until we have some news, I guess we should rest up?”
“But anyway, Peter won’t be doing any superheroing until he’s finished college.” Tony said narrowing his eyes as Peter pulled a face at that restriction. “And as Peter has already said, you can’t tell anyone about this.”
Shock gasps rose from the guests at this and Rogers scoffed, “Oh don’t pretend you all wouldn’t like the chance to give him a good beating. It’s a shame Howard was such a lenient Father, if he hadn’t been so lax and had given Stark some real discipline then he might be a man now, instead of the pathetic, weak excuse he is now!” More shocked gasps followed and people actually had the audacity to ask if Rogers condoned Child Abuse, to which he rolled his eyes.
“Yes, he’ll recover.” The Doctor confirmed, “He has several injuries, the ruptured aorta as I said, also a ruptured spleen, collapsed lung, broken left humourus, a fractured left hip, and an open fracture to the Tibia and Fibula.”
“Whoever made these things needs shooting.” Clint grumbled. He scowled at Tony, “Did you jusy purchase the most complicated tents ever made just to torment us?”
“But this wouldn’t be for the military.” Steve protested, “It’d be used only in defence of the planet, not a domestic war.”
So far they had found quite a few anemones, a hermit crab, some mussels, and plenty of shells which Zach and Peter had collected and put in their bucket.
Had it not been for Bruce Banner, then Tony would likely have packed in the whole Avengers Initiative thing a whole lot sooner. But Bruce never seemed to have a problem with the way things were, so Tony had become convinced that this was how family’s functioned and that he was simply not used to it, having never been in a family environment before.
“Uh, I said I’m gonna kill you second.” Tony replied, “Gonna kill him first.” He pointed to the thug besides him.
“Iron Balls!” Deadpool cried, with an exaggerated squeal, “You are Sooo my favourite hero ever! You are so shiny and sleek, you make me want to rub myself against you and give you a good wax!”
“Hey!” Tony jerked Peter so he was sitting up, his tear streaked and reddened face visible, “Don’t you say that, don’t you ever say that, don’t think it because it isn’t true.” Peter choked and hiccupped, sniffing hard. He flinched when Tony wiped his cheek with his thumbs and looked at his Mother with watery eyes. “I will never regret adopting you Peter.” Tony said, “I love you so much. I don’t care that I didn’t give birth to you, that doesn’t matter, because you are my boy, my Son, just as much as Zach is.”
“Because of that!” Tony exclaimed, “Because you are fucking perfect and I am a wreck. I’m emotionally and physically scarred, I’ve been sexually abused, I have a history of addictions, and I am terrible at remembering things that are important to relationships, like dates, birthdays, anniversaries. Hell I have forgotten Rhodey and Pepper’s birthdays every year! The only reason I remember Zach and Peter’s is because Jarvis, Rhodey, and Pep scream it at me.” He threw up his arms and began to pace.
“Uh, Winter?” Rhodey asked, confused by the mention of a third party, “Who..” He broke off at the sound of police sirens which suddenly pierced the air. Tony groaned and rolled his eyes while Bucky tensed.
There Tony’s heat hit and he spent three days being fucked by Obadiah. The Alpha was not overly cruel, but he was certainly not gentle in his handling of the young Omega, and Tony was left aching and sore with red raw thighs and bruises all over his hips and wrists by the time the heat was finished.
He had Zach lay in the centre of his bed in nothing but his nappy, and was checking his palladium levels when Natalie Rushman came into his room.
“Don’t get snippy Mr or you’ll be on teenage brat monitoring duty.” Tony reprimanded the AI then looked at Steve plaintively, “Why did I agree to this?” He moaned, “I can’t handle this, it’s…..it’s multiple teenagers under our roof for more than twenty-four hours, something terrible is going to happen and then MJ and Ned’s parents will blame me and they’ll come at me with pitchforks and before you know it I’ll tied to stake and condemned for parental heresy!”
“From what Steve’s said, we’ll be looking at Chitauri, those leviathans, the Space whale things, and some kind of mutant hyena beasts, along with his generals, or “Children” as he likes to call them”
Tony allowed himself a smile, at least he and Steve would have the bed to themselves for a few hours. After the day he’d had, the least he deserved was some sexy fun times with the Captain. A glance Steve’s way showed that Steve was thinking much the same which certainly boded well for a good night of rampant sex while the boys toasted marshmallows and star gazed.
“Jury’s out.” Stark glibly replied before turning back to Banner, “You’ve really got a lid on it, don’tcha? What’s your secret, bongo drums, mellow jazz, big bag of weed?”
“He’d use it for himself, use it to take power for himself.” Tony got off the bed and ran a hand over his face, “Ross wouldn’t put this army to work for the US. He wouldn’t have then peace keeping or routing out terrorist cells. He’d have them invading and conquering.”
The woman laughed and glanced down at her toddler who tugged on her jeans, “Hungwee Mommy.” She said.
“Hardly subtle.” Vision said as he fazed through the ground, descending through the depths of the Shield base in a search for Tony.
“Easy now baby, just breathe with me, slowly now, in and out, in and out,” He soothed Tony, “Take a deep breath in through your nose, hold it and then slowly release it counting back from ten. We’ll do it together okay? Ready now, deep breath in,” He sucked in a deep breath and held it for a second and then began to exhale, counting as he did.
In truth he did not. Oh, he had shed tears when she had died, but he had never felt the loss the way Steve had described or been as bereft as Thor now seemed. His heart not felt broken when she had been placed in the ground with Howard, and soon Tony’s tears had dried for her.
Tony’s eyes lit up with hope for the first time since he’d learned of his paralysis, “Let’s get these designs completed and fabricated, I want a prototype ready to go as soon as I am released from my incarceration.”
“Well, we figured, or rather I figured that if I am going to be moving my legs outside of the suit with the braces, why couldn’t they be made to support me outside of the suit and nullify a need for a wheelchair?”
Peter awoke on a hard surface with bright lights right in his face. He tried to move but found his arms and legs were pinned down by metal restraints. He’d been stripped too, his uniform was gone as was his mask. All he had on was his underwear and a bandaged around his right thigh which must have been stitched up.
