"One more terrible pun, and we could arrange that," Logan muttered with a solid eyeroll.
"Great. We should hang out," Logan said, grabbing his clothes from the bedroom and wadding them up under his arm. "I'm packed. Let's get outta here before Stark remembers where the bar is."
"Yeah, stuff's potentially toxic at the right levels. Kind of like too many iron pills. Or having an iron skeleton. I'm sure your healing factor takes care of that, though."
The doctor nodded to the call button near Steve's hand. "I'm going to give you a little time, but you need rest." He met Coulson's gaze, not even bothering to try to convince Tony Stark to do the practical thing. "Be sure to give him some."
"Well, when you put it that way, I suppose we're rather dull tag alongs, Fitz and I," she teased, though it was an odd thought. Loki fit. He really did. That only made it more surreal. "It might actually work. Mr. Stark was right. He might... I'm not sure Agent Barton and Agent Coulson will be very happy about that." Jemma bit her lip. The pair of them had been through a great deal, and she hated to think that they would suffer for the mercy of letting Loki join the team. "After what he did, it's difficult to... well, how do you ignore someone killing another member of the team? Maybe more than one member. It... well, it's not entirely standard."
Logan felt only the faintest hint of jealousy at the sight. Mostly, seeing the two tangled together and knowing that he got to play as well just made it that much more intriguing. Once he got the door open, he noted that the two didn't seem to be intent on immediately going through it, and he grabbed Nat and pulled her to himself for a fast, hard kiss, one powerful arm curled around her waist. "Let's move this inside," he decided with a smirk, letting Nat go to tug Scott into the room. Logan wasted no time tugging his shirt off and tossing his belt aside, but he left the jeans in place for the moment.
Even Logan gave Tony a look that said he thought the man was crazy. "Uh, if I don't work out, pretty sure we should just regroup and-"
The touch, completely unexpected, had made Clint jump. His gaze drifted to Coulson, and he felt the briefest impulse to lean against Coulson. Clint pressed his lips together, trying to get a grip. "Me too," he rasped out. He stared hard at the other man, trying to reaffirm to himself that Coulson was real, was right there with him. "I thought... back at the Fridge... I thought Loki was going to kill you again. I saw the security videos of when he..." Clint's voice cracked, and he took a deep breath. "I could see it happening all over again, and even being there, I didn't think there was any chance I'd stop him."
Coulson pulled off the ear protection and sighed as he sagged against the counter. "Better than that, I just ran out of paper to shoot." He offered Clint a smile and sighed again. "It's nothing. Well, no, it's not nothing, but it's nothing because he won't tell me anything. It's something. It's maybe even something really, really important." Knowing that needed more clarification, he explained quietly, "Whatever is letting me be up and walking around right now... I can't help thinking that might help Steve too."
"Okay," Coulson agreed, not bothering to point out that he already knew who most of Clint's partners were - at least the regulars - and what their status was too. It was a little invasive and a lot stalkery even in his head. He didn't want to know how it would sound out loud. "If I can trust you with my life, I guess I can trust you to know when buying a box of condoms is appropriate," Coulson allowed. He wasn't sure it was true, but he hoped it was. Hoping to shift the subject, Coulson added, "I wish Stark wasn't down for the count. Now would be a lovely time for him to research the best ways to kill a god. Slowly."
The syringe was set aside in a heartbeat, and Coulson took a seat, removing himself from a position of dominance so that they were on the same level. “Just breathe.” It was comforting to see that Barnes was picking up on the cues that meant he was on the edge of an episode. It meant that control might not be as far away as anyone had feared. “Listen to my voice.” Once he saw the stuttering breaths slow somewhat, he reached out and placed his hand gently over Bucky’s. “No one here is going to hurt you, Sergeant Barnes. Just stay with us.”
Clint was looking for paper towels to mop up the coffee he'd spit all over the counter - Phil had guessed accurately - when the agent mentioned the arrow pajamas. Clint froze, his hand on a paper towel in the puddle of coffee. "They... they make those?" he asked, trying to absorb the idea that he had his own merchandise and that Phil Coulson might be wearing it.
"Hmm." Natasha wasn't the slightest bit convinced. Steve wasn't in any shape to have to play referee. "I'll check in. Make sure no one needs a cup of tea every now and then."
It was intense feeling Tony inside him and intense having the man's soft lips pressed against his own. Whatever he'd expected falling into bed with Tony Stark, it had never been that he could feel so loved. Blindly he reached out and found one of Tony's hands, lacing their fingers tightly together. "We should've done this sooner," he murmured against Tony's lips. "You feel so good, baby..."
Though it wasn't a surprise, Natasha still felt her stomach roll at the confession, at the tears and the way Clint leaned into Phil like he was the only person in the world who could fix it all. She rose and moved over to kneel in front of Clint, taking the hand that wasn't desperately wrapped around Phil's. Even as she'd moved, their handler had wrapped an arm around Clint's shoulders, pulling him in close. "It isn't your fault. Either of you," she added with a sober glance at Phil. Despite the man remaining slightly more controlled on the outside, she hadn't missed the tremor of the man's hands as Clint spoke or the glossy sheen in his eyes.
Logan didn't bother to hide the laughter the whole scene inspired. "And here I thought all the sex in Mission Impossible was just to sell tickets." He glanced sidelong at Scott. "Didn't realize it was a documentary."
Scott jumped in surprise, but the motion did nothing to dislodge the fingers from his temples. A flash of something uncomfortable but not precisely painful seared through his mind.
"Not uncomfortable so much as I just... usually say all the wrong things," Tony admitted. He always felt the need to caveat and preamble and generally just wound up getting lost in his own train of thought before he ever managed to get around to saying what he'd intended. He'd managed to make Pepper angry not just a few times doing so.
Being reminded that he'd be getting Steve with lunch served to motivate Tony significantly, and he grabbed for his phone with a smirk. FOOD? I'LL EAT ANYTHING. JUST KEEP IN MIND THERE'S AN AUDIENCE DOWN HERE.
Over the comm, Steve informed them, "Widow, Hawkeye and Agent Coulson will be on the ground with you in a minute. Bruce, it's time to let the big guy out to play."
Steve chuckled but didn't take long to enjoy the humor. He had work to do - very pleasant work. It amazed him to see Tony coming apart. It was one thing knowing he was attractive in an objective sense and another thing entirely to be capable of turning Tony into a whimpering mess. He languidly sucked the head only of Tony's cock into his mouth and felt the man's thighs spasm beneath his hands. That encouraged Steve to take more, though he let nothing hurry him. Finally when he could feel the tension in Tony building to the breaking point, Steve reached for the man's hands and placed them at the back of his head, silently giving him permission to take what he wanted.
Logan tensed, then grabbed Tony by the hair and pulled him in for a brief but aggressive kiss. "Just no hickies," he growled with an ironic smirk, then gave Tony a solid bite on the jaw.
"Guys." Bruce's voice was soft but somehow managed to carry enough weight to draw their attention, save for Clint. "We need him to tell us how to fix the issue with the hammer. And knowing where Tony is wouldn't hurt, either."
Phil briefly rolled his eyes skyward as if asking for help from above, then explained, "There was an incident when I was on my way to New Mexico," he paused and gave Clint a significant look, "a couple of guys looking to get some quick cash. I dealt with it. I was disarmed, so I had to improvise a little." He glanced back at the clerk. "The donuts did the job, though. The sugar rush managed to take me through the rest of the drive." He grabbed a few more chips. Having his blood sugar out of the toilet was doing wonders for his mood.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
"No problem." It was comforting just to hold the drink. Tony always bought the best, and the sharp, woody scent in the air was soothing. "We'll get them back. If Loki wanted them dead, he wouldn't have taken them. Simple as that." Phil took a seat at the bar next to Clint and offered a faint smile. "We aren't going to start losing to him now."
"Obviously, the whole thing was a secret. Loki decided he didn't want to be a skeleton in Thor's closet. Well, he thought he wouldn't be eventually, that they'd be ruling Asgard together," Tony explained, relieved in a way that Steve was asking questions, that someone else might actually understand why Tony could feel at least a little sympathetic toward Loki after all the trickster had done. "He let Thor know that he wanted more, and I guess his brother just cut him loose without a word."
The feeling was mutual, although Loki was loathe to admit as much. He didn't need mortals. He didn't need anyone. He found himself understanding all too quickly, however, why Rogers was so attached to the man. As he truly began to move, Loki heard himself moaning as he found just the right angle. It was easy to pretend that he was simply using Stark for his own pleasure and a bit harder to believe as he strained to hear the same sort of sounds from Tony, as he idly reached up to flick the man's nipples and then bent to lick his neck.
Scott melted against Clint's muscular body. The leather pulled at his hair, making the discomfort more intense - and by turn the sensation. He groaned and responded with another kiss that left absolutely no doubt of precisely what he wanted. "I hear you know how to take charge. Show me." Scott wondered where exactly he'd heard that, from whom. What kind of rumor mill would he have encountered going nowhere but Logan's bedroom except when his skills were needed to help with field coordination?
Though he wasn't sure that it was a fair comparison, Phil still took the compliment with a grateful smile. "I hope so. As long as you think so..." Beauty was in the eye of the beholder, and if Clint was happy with the view he was getting, that was what mattered. Phil had never been under any illusions that he'd seduce every person he met, and he'd never particularly wanted to try. Being good enough for Clint would be more than enough for him. His cell buzzed, and Phil genuinely considered ignoring it for a few long minutes before he reluctantly fished the thing out. The news sobered him slightly, but he was glad there was no addendum to come in. "Boss man thinks our out of town friend might show up soon." It was easy to convey information casually with someone who knew him - and the situation - so well. "No need to start shift early, though."
"Med team NOW," Coulson barked into his phone, though there were already orderlies with a gurney just steps behind them in the hallway. The men lifted Steve, taking vitals. It was hard to hear it all, but they caught flashes, "thready pulse," and "shallow breathing" both making Coulson's heart sink. He put a hand on Stark's shoulder without even thinking about it, squeezing in silent support. "He's survived worse."
Scott smiled right back. The truth was he was pretty sure he wasn't going to regret it. He'd spent most of his formative sexual years with a single person, and while he didn't regret that either, he was ready to do things differently. Scott felt secure with Logan. They'd gone through more together before they even got together than a lot of couples did throughout the whole course of their relationship. They would be fine. "That said? I think I'm pretty okay with finishing this tray of shots first."
Phil's stomach turned at the sight of the blood and the look of pain on Clint's face. He would have done anything in that moment to make sure that he could protect Clint. Unfortunately the impulse played directly into Creed's hand, but there wasn't much he could do about it. Protecting Clint was instinct. //I think I see why he and Loki get along so well.// Phil wondered how different things might have been if Erik Lehnsherr was present and accounted for, if he would have been able to rein his people in and keep some sort of order amidst the chaos. Instead of addressing Creed at all, he switched his focus to Clint. "We're gonna be fine. You and I both know Natasha's not going to leave this alone."
Steve stared at the syringe blankly, then with growing awe. "It will... I'll go back to..." It wasn't normal, and he knew it, so the phrasing escaped him quickly.
They hadn't really checked in, they didn't know where the team was. They had no idea if the fight had gone as badly as it had looked like it was going when they left. Reluctantly, Phil fumbled for the tablet on his nightstand and fired it up, navigating to the reports from the past few days. From their situation, it had been clear that Loki hadn't been defeated, but it still cut to read the report, to know the truth instead of just assuming it. Stark was dead. He could barely imagine how Steve felt, and the thought alone left him reaching for Clint to touch, to feel the reassurance of the man's presence and safety.
Tony's gaze had been flicking back and forth between the two, and it finally rest on Bruce. "Is there seriously absolutely no alcohol whatsoever down here?"
"Got me," Steve murmured, finally shifting his hips, silently encouraging the man to move. He was adjusted - or at least close enough to adjusted - and impatience was quickly setting in. The look of intent lust in Logan's eyes promised that the best was yet to come, and Steve didn't want to wait anymore. A flicker of movement to his side drew Steve's gaze back to Tony. He focused in on the man's hardening cock for a second before looking up into Tony's dark eyes with a teasing smile. "I can help with that," he offered, voice a few notches deeper than normal.
Clint made a sound of pleasant surprise when Phil's lips fell upon his once again. He'd honestly expected Phil to respond by telling him to get up so they could eat. Instead, the archer found himself parting his lips and whimpering softly as the other man's tongue slid perfectly into his mouth. His hand found one of Phil's, slid upward to rest on the man's forearm and tangle lightly in the man's shirt sleeve. Clint couldn't help the soft whimpers that escaped him as Phil plundered his mouth, and he felt goosebumps rising on his skin.
Logan started to try and stop Stark, then thought better of it. //Maybe he'll be easier to put up with if he's unconscious.//
"I'll keep you in the loop," Natasha agreed, heading for the door without another word. She needed to find Clint and then start clearing herself to be officially free again.
Tony smiled. It was surprisingly rewarding to watch his lover devour the meal he'd made, simple as it was. He shrugged at Steve's question, hoping they could change the subject soon, before he got cornered into telling Steve Plan B. "Well, the gun already killed him once, and he didn't seem much worse for wear. Considering his personality, I think at this point he'd be more than willing to take one for the team. And the plan is to modify the old model to hurt a lot less." He was quiet for a moment. "Wish we could've had more time before. It might not have hurt you as badly if-"
Steve's gaze trailed down to the hammer. It had saved Clint. It could save them all. He shuddered to think of what it might have done in Loki's hands. "He's not going to give up on having it this easily."
Having some space between them and the hammer felt better. Coulson let himself relax and tried not to hiss with pain as his bruised back came into firmer contact with the seat. It would be a few days before the ache subsided, but getting thrown around a little was a small price to pay. He wished they'd been able to secure Loki, but until they found a way to knock him out without using the hammer, they didn't have a secure way to transport him. Not one that Coulson was interested in risking without Thor. //Where the hell is Thor?// It irked him that they were chasing Loki and trying to protect the earth from the god's brother without any assistance from him. It irked him and it worried him. Being cavalier about the safety of his girlfriend's planet wasn't really Thor's style. "For tonight I think we all need a long, hot shower and a good night's sleep. Tomorrow we regroup."
Steve allowed himself to be forced back down onto the bed and even closed his eyes, but he knew there was no way he could possibly sleep.
"That sounds like heaven," Fitz answered wistfully. He looked over at his screen and smiled anyway. "Of course, we do have a few interesting things to go over. Should make the time pass."
Steve tried to blink away the tears and only succeeded in sending them falling down his cheeks. Relief was the silliest possible thing to feel in a moment like that, but he felt it just the same and more or less fell against Tony, sobbing without reservation. He'd been terrified that somehow in the space of a few days, he'd managed to lose the man despite him being alive. There was no chance of speaking. He couldn't. The pent up emotions were too much, the relief was too much, the hurt was too much, and Steve wanted nothing more than to cling to Tony until he could remember how to breathe again.
Tony responded with a much weaker yell of his own, his hair mussed in the early morning light as he squinted painfully at Logan's backlit silhouette. "Ahh... whyyy are we yelling...?" He rolled over and pulled a pillow over his head.
Steve gratefully retrieved his shield but halted at the sight of Tony. "Stay back," he ordered sharply. They couldn't afford to run, but he wasn't about to let Tony get in the mix while injured. The sight of the blood was enough to make Steve want to leave it to the rest of them and get his boyfriend to safety. As a leader, he didn't have that luxury. Instead he stalked toward where the Hulk was growling at Sabretooth. "Now might be a good time to get your friend and bid a hasty retreat." Much as he wanted to keep Mystique as a hostage, Steve wasn't willing to risk the safety of anyone else if Loki decided he needed more hostages of his own.
Clint twitched irritably at the remark. Maybe it was a little true. Still kind of sucked to be reminded.
"You agreed to your boyfriend telling you you're his replacement," the director bit out, "and I think that means you said yes in there somewhere."
Natasha couldn't help but hold on just as tight. She could handle anything if she needed to, suffer through any rough patches. Having her whole self pawed through artlessly, having Loki inside her head, had been one of the most horrifying things she'd ever felt. It was good to be home, to be safe, to have Clint's strong arms wrapped around her and know that he understood without needing to say anything. He understood better than anyone else in the world, and even if he hadn't, she wouldn't have needed to explain herself. He didn't require it. "It’s good to be home."
"That... that's what I understood as well, Sir," Coulson managed. The idea of Logan lying to them was one thing, but Coulson hadn't honestly expected Summers to be an issue. On the contrary, he'd hoped the man might help them to keep an eye on his former teammate.
Emerging from the bathroom, Tony mentally summoned the nanobots, letting the suit form up to his waist before he stopped it. He pulled Steve close for a long, slow kiss before letting the red and gold armor swallow him up to his neck. "Ready?"
Logan felt his heart skip a little at affectionate touch. It vividly brought back some memories that he was pretty sure he didn't want Scott to know about. The way they'd been able to go at each other without concern for injury, the raw -  //Okay, think about something else before you have to explain a boner to both of 'em.// "Fine," he said, moving away from Steve's touch under the guise of grabbing the file. He was relieved to see it only seemed to address one particular subject, rather than his entire past. //Hopefully one that ain't too rocky.// Skimming through the files did little to jog his memory, but the fuzzy picture of the artifact was another story. Logan remembered fighting with everyone on the team that had found it and was supposed to be hiding it. He grimaced as he recalled struggling with a man not unlike himself, finally throwing him into an icy lake. "So, Stark was right. I do have a brother. Or did..." Glancing up at Steve, he remembered that the man was looking for something more weird artifact related.
"I'm fine," Tony replied without looking away from Steve. "It can work." He didn't bat an eye as he said so. "Even if it doesn't, between Thor and the Hulk, I think we can deal with any crap he tries to pull." He turned back to Loki. "Just be ready for no one to trust you for a while. And for Barton to probably want to kill you. I'd probably avoid him if I were you. At least until you've fixed his hammer problem."
Victor offered the god an almost coy smirk as he stepped back, keeping eye contact as he unbuttoned his jeans and slowly slid them down. Stepping out of them, he stalked closer to Loki with no lack of confidence in his stride whatsoever. Hooking a claw in the loop of Loki's drawstring, he slowly tugged it loose. "C'mon.... I showed you mine..."
He'd intended not to make a sound. He'd intended to keep entirely silent. The pain had other ideas, and Phil gasped at the sudden shock of absolute, tearing agony. His hands clenched behind his back, trapped against Creed's body, and he had to fight against every instinct that told him to grab onto Creed and tear at any skin he could reach until he ripped the man completely open. Given how quickly Creed healed, that wouldn't do much. Gritting his teeth, he managed under his breath, "Doesn't matter what you do to either one of us. I'm not yours."
Logan frowned, staring hard at the pile of papers. His jaw clenched, and he glared at Steve with a lot more focus and malice than he had a few moments before. "Look, Apple Pie... The few walks I've managed to take down memory lane ain't been a lot o' fun. Been kinda the opposite, really. And I don't think you or any o' SHIELD's cronies are ready to deal with me if I turn back into a ravin' lunatic. " He put his coffee cup down deliberately and folded his arms over his chest. "I think you should probably look somewhere else for whatever it is you're tryin' to find."
"And we'll keep it that way," Bruce decided, putting a chip in his mouth and going back to his work.
"I don't think I've got that kind of following," he answered, "though I should've taken a picture of you feeding the ducks. That would have gotten a few notes." When Clint shrugged it off, Coulson shook his head in return. It was amusing to realize that Clint had no idea what people thought about him. Maybe he didn't have the droves of fans that Cap or Iron Man did, but he was notorious in his own right. "You've saved a lot of lives, and after the Chitauri, people noticed. You're a hero too even if you don't think of yourself that way." He liked sitting there on a cloudy day with Clint next to the pond. Coulson looped his arms over his knees and watched the ducks fighting over the food, more eager than vicious.
"The couch is fine with me," Scott answered. He appreciated that Logan was being nice - new territory for him as far as Scott could tell - but he wasn't ready to throw the man out of his own bed, especially when he could've gotten a room of his own if he wasn't so uneasy about being alone. "Believe me, it's going to be the most comfortable bed I've had in awhile, not counting the hotel. I'll see about a room tomorrow." Scott didn't like the thought, but he knew he needed to learn how to feel safe without a permanent bodyguard, and if he couldn't feel safe in Stark Tower, he would never feel safe anywhere. "Thanks for letting me crash here. Somebody who didn't know you might think we like each other."
Logan glanced at Scott. "Maybe we could call in some o' the X-Men to at least hold down the fort while the rest of us go to... uh..."
"Well, sorry I missed you in the big one, then," Steve answered with a hint of a smile before sighing as Tony twisted the cap off a bottle of whiskey. His first instinct was to reach out and grab it away from the man, but he knew that would stop Tony for a few moments at best. "Might be nice not being the oldest guy in the room for once." They were obviously very, very different people, but Steve genuinely felt that they could connect. They had more in common than he did with most of the Avengers, honestly, and somehow he'd managed to find common ground with them. "Where are you staying? I should probably get him away from the bar soon if I don't want to carry him out of here. Tony? Ease up for a second, would ya?"
Steve blinked. He felt as if nothing but ghosts were surrounding him lately. "Hydra? But-"
"Good boy. You might be useful after all." Nat turned her attention to Clint. "Tell me what you want. We both know I won't necessarily give it to you... but tell me."
Scott could feel the restrained passion flowing off of Logan. The man was drawn tight like an arrow waiting to be released. The thought was both thrilling and intimidating. He knew he couldn't let Logan off the leash yet. He wasn't ready. Hands unused to passivity never stopped running over Logan's back or threading into the man's hair. Scott was having trouble with restraint himself. "Slow like this for... god, just for a little bit." Scott breathed unsteadily in and out. His body ached for Logan to drive into him, but common sense still ruled somewhat. He couldn't shake the habit after so long. "When I tell you... when I tell you, then you can stop holding back."
"I should be fine, sir. I will let you know if I need anything."
In which Loki enjoys one of his strange bedfellows, and Natasha is a little too strong-willed for her own good.
Logan wasn't sure how far Scott would let him push the limits, but he wasn't afraid to find out. The feral mutant slid his hand under Scott's shirt tail, teasingly running his thumb along the outline of the man's abs and then dipping a couple fingertips into Scott's waistband. All the while, his tongue stroked slowly along Scott's in mimicry of a far more intimate act.
Steve nodded. "I'll come back when I'm done. Jarvis, let Tony know dinner's going to be a little late."
Loki found himself surprised once more and laughed aloud at the sensation. "You have to stop doing that. No one..." He shook his head then rolled it against the pillow to get a better look at Tony. "I honestly don't know that anyone else will care overly much if I turn into a blue-skinned freak. Or, for that matter, if I happen to die. As for the former, I intend to conceal it... at least for now." Sitting up, he looked down at himself. It took a moment's thought to leech the blue from his skin and leave it glowingly pale once more. Loki rose and began dressing with careful deliberation. "I think I would prefer to face the Avengers clothed. You may want to do the same, though it seems a shame to cover you."
Natasha saw the way Scott writhed at the words, at Logan taking him. Apparently it hadn't been just Loki's influence that allowed Scott to enjoy Clint's attentions. He was usually less than gentle with the guys he hooked up with as Scott's bruises attested. She filed the information away. Maybe it would make Clint feel at least moderately less horrible about the whole incident. She slid two fingers inside herself as Logan teased Scott with slow and careful to start things off.
Coulson nodded his understanding, though he honestly had zero intention of trying to separate the pair. It got rid of the doctor. "Tony, I can wait outside if you'd like a minute."
Steve was watching both of them closely and carefully interjected, "I think it's best that anyone we have guarding it be changed out pretty regularly. Same for the people working with it. If it's this powerful, we shouldn't take chances. The team's thin enough, Barton. I need you on reserve, not guard duty." He looked back to Bruce. "Tony's always up for talking... and working more than he should. Just help me keep an eye out for when he needs to stop and rest, okay? He won't do it on his own."
Nick Fury shook his head. "Not yet. But he's just going to keep throwing a temper tantrum until we give him attention, so that's what we're going to do. He wants a spanking? We'll give him one."
Natasha stretched, forcing herself to be entirely casual about the matter. "Just an old piece of garbage that needs to be taken out again." Her gaze cut to Clint, checking his face and seeing him looking like he was going to throw up. "Wipe down, put clothes on. I'm not in the mood to have my city broken again." Nat looked over at Darien, appraising how quickly he'd gotten himself together and nodded her approval. "You too. If you're going to join us, you may as well start now."
Bruce, his pulse rate already through the roof, gave Phil a slow nod. The man was right. Letting go, the scientist flung himself toward Loki as his alter ego took hold. He lunged for the god, swatting him with one broad, green palm into the nearest rack of shelving, sending jars and weapons and other oddities flying.
If it hadn't been so dangerous, Phil would have taken the hammer. He wanted it the hell away from his lover. He wanted Clint safe and sound and not touching artifacts that might be tearing him apart from the inside out. "Look at it this way - maybe we can talk Logan into letting you take a few swings at Creed before he gets debriefed."
What little resistance he'd had before he got abducted was pretty well gone. Logan had really wanted to take the high road with Scott, take things slow, but Loki had already stepped in and reminded them both that, in their line of work, there wasn't time for slow. Something was always out to get them, and trying to be chivalrous and noble about things was just going to rob them of opportunities. Scott had barely finished his last sentence when Logan pounced, grabbing the man and slamming their lips together in a raw, needful kiss that unleashed everything Logan had been holding back. He dragged Scott into the bedroom, stopping just inside the doorway to shove the other man against the wall and kiss him again, one of his hands sliding up under the hem of Scott's shirt to roam over lean, toned muscle. "Need you," he growled as he drew back to catch his breath.
Coulson nodded his agreement. The requests were startlingly reasonable considering their source. "Doable. But I'm sleeping on the couch, and you aren't staying up all night. You're going to rest. Tomorrow you can talk to Bruce. Yeah, I can see the wheels turning from here." He smiled almost apologetically. "I'd say I'm sorry, but Steve needs you to take care of yourself right now. Since I'm moderately certain you can't, I'll help."
Seeming to sense Scott's worry, Logan did his best to make the kiss as distracting as possible. They both needed it, and he was more than happy to make sure they got what they needed. As his tongue stroked along Scott's, he began thrusting, matching the pace to the motion of his tongue. "Love you, darlin'," he whispered, his fingers carding through sweat-damp hair as he moved inside his lover.
Bruce sprang to his feet and slammed his hand on the table, and most of the room flinched. "I said no!"
"Good point. Up to now, the best they could do was Bobby Drake, the professional metrosexual," Logan pointed out from the back seat as they rolled down the underground ramp into the Avengers' garage.
"STOP! Everyone, stand down! Please, stop fighting!" Thor had set his hammer down beside his throne and was holding his hands up and out.
"Sounds like the most beautiful case of indigestion ever thought of," Clint decided, though he was unable to convince himself to stand up and actually pull away from the hands roaming over his body. The touches kindled just the perfect hum of low-grade arousal in him, and he was pretty sure he wanted to stay that way until the sun went down. "I don't know... food and beer are up there on my priorities list, but I think I'd do about anything for you to keep touching me," he murmured, his voice relaxed and thick.
"Getting better by the moment," Loki admitted. The man's powerful form and aggressive attitude were enough to put him in mind of other fantasies. Perhaps it wasn't the best indulgence to make, but he deserved the chance to let off some steam. Victor being willing to mark him was a surprisingly intense turn on. "There are a variety of oils on the nightstand. Choose whatever you like." He wasn't interested in teasing or playing, and he honestly hoped Victor wasn't either. Foreplay was well and good, but they weren't in love. They weren't courting, they were scratching a mutual itch.
"You could say - "
"Might do wonders for yours," Logan shot back, though someone with a sharp eye might have caught a brief smirk. "Not sure I like this whole 'Director' thing, I gotta say."
"Just part of it," Steve assured, feeling giddy with relief. He felt a touch on his shoulder and finally turned to see Pepper smiling kindly down at him.
"That's weird, Nick. Never wanted to hear you say 'spanking'." Tony took a bit of satisfaction from the twinge of annoyance on Fury's face.
Bruce sighed and looked over at the young man. "That's his way of saying that you're brilliant and you did a good job," he explained. "But Tony doesn't know how to be nice. Unless you're Steve, in which case he somehow finds a way."
Confident that he could likely move more nimbly and safely than his erstwhile companion, Hank grabbed Phil by the waist and leapt for some of the farther shelves, circumnavigating the chaos towards the center of the room and conveying them both out the door.
Glad to have a distraction from the myriad worries plaguing him, Steve smiled easily in return. “Yeah.” He didn’t have much. There were a couple of boxes of clothes mostly consisting of outfits chosen by Tony to get him out of his comfort zone of slacks and button downs along with another box of papers and mementos. Steve realized as he and Bucky unpacked the items into his new room that he hadn’t been doing much to settle in anywhere since his return. He glanced over to see Bucky lifting out a picture of the two of them, Bucky’s taller form easily dwarfing him in the shot. “For some crazy reason, the newspapers never want to use that shot in my profiles. Strangest thing.”
"I have a present for you."
It was on the tip of his tongue to deny it, a knee jerk reflex that he fought back with an effort. "Yeah, I was terrified, actually. You were hurt, back up wasn't where it should have been... things could have ended a lot differently." What had ended up a mild scar and a decent story for Clint could just as easily have been his last mission. It had come close enough to be terrifying, close enough to worry Coulson in a way he'd realized after the fact wasn't entirely appropriate. "As it turns out, I'm actually incapable of not worrying about you." He reached out to cup Clint's cheek. "You're too important to me."
Without missing a beat, Clint stood and retrieved his bow and his knife, cutting Darien’s bonds with the knife and putting it away before taking a long, appraising look at SHIELD's latest recruiting target. "The Invisible Man, I presume?" he asked, sounding less than impressed. This guy looked more like a con artist or meth junkie than a superhero. He stayed alert. From what Fury had said, this guy was as likely to flee or fight as he was to join up. But then, that was probably why Fury had sent Hawkeye in the first place: seeing hardened thugs get torn to ribbons by a guy with nothing more than a leather outfit and a bow had a tendency to convince people that running or fighting weren't in their best interests.
Steve swallowed hard around the lump in his throat and reached out to touch the cool metal. "I... thanks. Thank you. This will help. You... can you tell me how to... I don't..."
Bruce shook his head. "I can keep some hold on the big guy, but I don't know I'd necessarily trust him with anything more delicate than a club."
Scott's hips set their own pace unbidden, riding the movement until he had to stop or risk coming in his pants like a horny teenager. "Maybe you do," he agreed, "but only because I lack any sense of subtlety." He canted his hips and used his leverage holding Logan to roll the man onto his back. Immediately Scott started tearing open his fly and jerking down Logan's jeans before doing the same with his own. "Fabric is cumbersome. And pointless. And there's too much of it."
Steve grinned at the words because he knew what they meant. If Tony was up to kidding around, he was letting his guard down at least a little. “I said I care about you - I didn’t say you aren’t still the biggest pain in the neck on the team. And that’s counting the big guy.” Almost shyly, Steve held out a hand. “Maybe it’s doing things a little backwards telling you I like you then making a move, but do you think maybe I could take you out sometime for a real date?”
Steve gave up on holding himself back and reached for Bucky’s hand. The feeling of the solid skin beneath his own was more comfort than he could have imagined, and he felt the sting of tears that he tried to fight back. “Right now my job is making sure that you and Tony are okay. I know it’s gonna be a long time before you are, but... you’re not gone. We’re both here and we’re alive, and whatever kind of mess we might be, that means something.”
Logan growled, his hand tangling in Scott's hair to jerk the man's head back and give him access to nip at Scott's stubbled throat. The words had been more than enough to bring out the animal in Logan, and he grabbed the bottle of lube from the nightstand. A moment later, slick fingers lightly brushed over Scott's throbbing cock, grazing his balls before lightly circling his puckered entrance. Logan had to remind himself to go slow. //Real slow...// Scott hadn't made any sort of a point of bringing up his virginity, and Logan wasn't going to play the "are you sure" game. Obviously, Scott was pretty damned sure, and Logan didn't see any reason to press the matter.
Logan grit his teeth and gave Tony a good shake and a thump against the wall before letting him go and putting away the claws. "Government skullfuckers think they know what I want, huh?" he said, turning to face Steve. He crossed his arms over his chest. "If you people have a 'file' on me, then you know I don't play well with others." Ugly arguments with Scott about whether Bobby and Rogue were old enough to be X-Men had pretty well driven Logan to leave the X-Men along with the residual tension in regard to a certain redhead he’d gotten too fond of.
Logan made a sound somewhere between a grunt and a sigh as he watched Scott's mouth slide over his cock. His lover had the most amazing lips, and watching them slide along his shaft was enough to challenge even Logan's control. His hand slid into Scott's hair, hanging on and careful not to interfere with Scott's movement. Logan's other hand covered one of Scott's, and the mutant let his head fall back on the couch for a moment as he panted his pleasure. "You look amazin' down there," he murmured softly.
Tony vaguely registered the interaction, noting Logan's renewed proximity and the way Steve's movements became momentarily distracted. The billionaire didn't need enhanced senses to notice the hungry stare Logan gave the blonde. He felt a sharp spike of arousal combined with a tremor of jealousy at the idea of Steve and Logan going at each other. The idea of the feral mutant tearing into the super soldier was a powerful turn on, but Tony couldn't deny a bit of worry that Steve might want someone more on his level in the end. His hands roamed over the Steve's body hungrily, feeling every shift of the finely tuned muscle beneath flawless skin. If this was a one-time deal, he was going to enjoy it to the fullest. That in mind, Tony leaned up and nipped at the blonde's lightly-stubbled throat, licking a trickle of sweat from the skin.
The bruiser smirked. "Make me."
"Right now, he's not hurting anyone or anything. I'm not going to put a man in a prison cell for what he might do when he’s been asset to the team otherwise."
Not worried about what anyone would think, Phil put a hand on Clint's back, rubbing at the few muscles he could reach with the barrier of the man's vest in the way. The team wanted them sane and functional. For just a little while, that was going to mean being slightly less professional than normal. Leaning in closer, he whispered, "We'll be done before you know it. Then on to donuts and movies."
Scott grinned in return and took a swig from his beer. "That I can and will happily agree to." He was glad that Logan wasn't angry with him. He was glad that they might be okay. "I can even promise closet space assuming I can afford a place with a closet and a drawer. I mean, that would be pretty fancy." Scott sat back to let the waitress set their food down. "Thank you." She gave them a warm smile in return, and he resolved to tip her within an inch of her life if she managed to keep up with their drinks too. The more he thought about it, the more he liked the idea of having a place of his own where he and Logan could be apart from the craziness of everything that went into being a hero. "Then again, after a week I might start missing Stark's tower after all."
"I agree," Tony said, pressing another kiss to Steve's lips, then down his jawline. "In fact," he said between kisses, "I think you could use a few more." Before Steve could protest, Tony was sucking and biting at a spot on his lover's neck, just below the jawline. Tony knew he really should have been getting ready to go to the lab, but he was pretty damn sure that the simulations they'd set up the night before could run themselves for awhile longer. That, and the fact that Bruce would probably have Jarvis harass him out of his room if they really needed him.
Even entering Fury's office wasn't that bad, although the man gave them a warning look when he caught sight of their joined hands. Coulson didn't even blink in response, and the man slumped back in his chair, apparently resigned. "We all know this one's gonna suck, which is why it's just us. We don't have to put the whole report out there for everybody, but the team needs to know the big parts. Coulson, you redact what you need to redact once I get the full picture."
Clint managed to slip back to his room without anyone catching him running around in barely more than his tighty whities, and he was soon dressed in a loose-fitting charcoal gray hoodie and jeans. When Coulson arrived at the door to the cell block, Clint looked far from pleased. "Looks like they've revoked my access. I guess Fury didn't like your report about me and the hammer. If I had to guess."
The Hulk gave Loki a cocky smirk, reaching for him until a blur of motion distracted him, a punch landing just under his eye, then his stomach, then the back of his head in quick succession. A tall, lean figure with a smarmy grin and silver hair seemed to materialize in front of him, and he growled irritably. "Puny mutant." He swiped for the man, but the mutant disappeared and then reappeared just inches from his reach.
Clint's gaze fixed on Coulson like the man was the only thing holding him to reality as Creed seized him by the jaw. Clint's hands rose to pull uselessly at the arm restraining him, his breath hissed through his nostrils as he fought to stay calm. He could feel the mutant's free hand sliding gently down his bared torso, the touches gentle and familiar rather than the harsh groping Clint would have expected. It reminded him of the way Loki had touched him, and Clint squeezed his eyes shut and whimpered softly.
The man - bulky, hairy, balding, and terrifyingly Eastern European - shrugged one tattooed shoulder. "I have special. Only one. You not like," he said in an unplaceable accent.
No smut, no hardcore adult content, but there is mutant trafficking, so if that's a touchy subject for you, proceed with caution.
"Well, it's worth a try," Logan gritted out, firing the weapon one more time. "Stark..." As he sank to the ground, he felt the weight of the weapon pulled from his hands.
Coulson gave a short shake of his head and was about to reply when one of the nurses stepped up to them. "We're going to look her over, but her vitals are stable. Her heartrate's a little fast but not dangerous right now. If the four of you wouldn't mind sitting down and waiting for awhile? As soon as she's up for visitors, we'll let you know."
The contact was thrilling and terrifying at once. Scott's hands were already filled with balled up fabric from the comforter. It was going to hurt, and he knew that before Clint even started. Even if he'd been asking for gentle and slow, it would have hurt. Scott’s heart pounded in his chest, and instead of fear, he felt a sick thrill of exhilaration at the idea of what Clint was about to do. He didn't give any orders, didn't beg, just remained panting and ready and at the mercy of the man behind him.
The feeling of settling onto Logan's cock was delicious. The position forced the length even deeper into his body. It hurt like hell at first, but Scott adjusted quickly. He responded happily to every kiss and clung tightly to Logan's shoulders. Frankly he didn't care if it hurt as long as Logan didn't stop fucking him.
"Yeah, that could work." Steve was pretty sure he'd have better luck raiding Coulson's wardrobe, but the truth was that finding out he was actually too small to borrow shirts from even Coulson would be a blow he wasn't ready for. "A shirt would be good. It's the strangest thing: Clint Barton is actually not my fashion icon." Tony wasn't either, sharp as he looked most of the time. Steve liked his own odd, dated style. Tony could call him an old man as much as he wanted: it made Steve feel like at least some things didn't have to change completely. "You make pretty good pancakes, by the way." Under the table, he let his foot find Tony's and knock against it. "Thanks."
"Are you going to continue to represent America as a homosexual?"
"I'd rather you be at Magneto's throat, but we can work on that," the woman answered, jerking her head down the hallway and meeting Sif's eyes. "Ready when you are. Banner? We might need the back up. Let's see how this goes." The Hulk was always a last resort, but he was a strong follow if they had need of it, uneasy as it made her. Bruce Banner was a good guy. The Hulk was a barely constrained monster. She preferred control whenever possible, and the potential chaos of his alter ego set her teeth on edge.
Steve nodded his agreement, but it didn't do anything to ease the knot in his stomach at the sight of the EMTs checking Tony out and putting an oxygen mask over his mouth.
"I think I might appreciate that," Natasha answered earnestly. She gave Clint's thigh a squeeze, but it was a quick, affectionate gesture obviously not intended as more. He belonged to someone else, and far from being offended, she was relieved. He deserved every last bit of the affection that Phil could offer him. She could keep him physically safe. Phil could protect his heart.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
"Are you still put out about your little friend? Honestly, water under the bridge, and the other one isn't even dead anymore. You take things far too seriously. All is fair in love and war, and that was war. This is something more... subtle. I've found a few new friends." Loki offered Logan a cold smile. "Mutants, I believe you call them. I believe that your people can help me and that I can help them. We all want something - a place to belong, a world that sees us for what we truly are. Tell me, if I were to offer you something of value, do you think you'd be willing to give me something of value in return?"
Tony cocked an eyebrow at the woman, pursing his lips thoughtfully. "He's fine," he said slowly. Staring at her contemplatively, he finally stood up and moved over to her and Fitz's corner. Tony checked to make sure Bruce was thoroughly eyeballs deep in whatever he was looking at before he fixed his attention more intently on the two younger scientists. "So, I'm guessing you two probably have access to samples and whatnot on it all, but... I don't suppose you'd be up for the challenge of trying to help Steve get back to being Captain America? I think he's kind of attached to the whole superheroing thing, and I really just can't tell him no these days."
"I happen to be fond of your thighs. I'm pretty sure I still will be even if there's more of them," Phil decided, tucking into the food with equal vigor. "I'll be hitting the gym tomorrow. Possibly for most of the day after this, to be honest." It took a lot more than it had once upon a time to keep off the extra weight, but he also indulged so heavily no more than a few times a year. It was a treat, not a lifestyle, which generally afforded him something of a buffer even when his job kept him on his ass at a desk for long, frustrating stretches. "Thankfully I know I'll regret this later otherwise I'd be worried about doing it too often."
He gave Bucky a bit of time and space before making his way back to the infirmary. As usual he had a pile of paperwork to get through, and besides that, he doubted Bucky was feeling entirely happy at the news that Steve was spending his night out with Tony. “Mind a little company?” Phil inquired as he shifted the curtain to one side.
That was good because Steve was way too far gone to think about what he was doing. He could only react to the feeling of Tony slowly edging into him and stretching him wider with every thrust. "Love... love everything... everything you do, everything," he managed at last. It wasn't quite the romantic declaration he might've preferred, but it was something. It was words strung together mostly coherently, which Steve thought was a miracle as Tony found his prostate on one of the deliciously slow, rocking pushes inside his body and ground against it. "Right... there..."
Phil barely managed to get his shoes and shirt off before he gave up and crawled into bed. He found himself quickly surrounded by Clint and murmured good night to the man as he tugged the blankets over them both. He wondered if he could have slept without Clint next to him and the wordless certainty that his lover was safe. He doubted it. Phil drifted off before he even had time to start worrying again. For once dreams blessedly eluded him, but Phil woke with a start. Late afternoon light streamed in through the windows, and he supposed he'd gotten a good five hours or so. He needed more, but there were other things going on.
"It made me feel a lot better too," Phil agreed. "I actually don't know if I would've gotten through it so smoothly without you. Taking a few minutes to feel just... just human again. Sometimes I guess I get a little swallowed up by the suit." He knew that sometimes he let the persona take over, lost Phil a little beneath the veneer of Agent Coulson. "So if I can help you slow down every now and then, maybe you can help me unwind a little more often. It's easy to forget I'm not actually married to my desk even though she and I have been in an exclusive relationship for quite a few years."
Tony raised an eyebrow. "Considering we're already friends with the X-Men, I have a feeling we're not exactly on their Christmas card list as it is," he noted. "And you're right; I probably am losing my marbles. What few I had. But I think SHIELD already decided I was unstable, so I'm sure it's nothing a few pills and some whiskey won't fix." //The God of Mischief thinks I'm going nuts. I thought it'd be colder when hell froze over.// "Though if you think I'm losing it, they may skip all that and go right for the straight jacket and six months of containment."
"I second that," Bruce threw in, though he was glowering at Tony rather than looking at Barton.
Natasha pushed the door open quietly and slipped over to Tony's bedside. According to his doctor, the drugs should have been out of his system a good half hour before. Keeping her hands carefully to herself, the woman ventured, "Tony?"
Tony clinked glasses, "Cheers," before taking a slow drink. It was a fruity Shiraz, one of his best. He wanted to see Steve buzzed, relaxed. He wanted them to take the night and enjoy it to the fullest. Not to mention, the light pink wine looked just incredible against Steve's lips. "You know, I think I'd like this night to last forever."
In which Jemma brings Bruce out of his shell, and the science team makes a little progress.
"Sounds dumb. I like it," Clint decided, grinning faintly. Pushing away from the table, he stood and raised an eyebrow. "You ready to go, or do you have normal civilian clothes to wear out?" he teased, tugging at the lapel of Phil's suit. He rarely saw the guy in anything else. He'd even heard other agents joke that all there was of Phil was a head and hands. Clint had learned firsthand that that wasn't the case, but it was still pretty damned amusing.
Loki wasn't surprised that Stark wanted a bit of mutual leverage, though he was almost surprised that the man agreed so eagerly. "Did you ever wonder why I never struggled with my brother for power when I was younger? We were the best of friends growing up, always close, always together. We were different from one another, but I always rather thought we complemented each other." He searched Stark's face but found no ready answers. "No, of course not. No one wonders why the villain became the villain."
Definite consent issues, kidnapping, mind games - though on a pretty mild scale as Loki goes. Contains Loki/Tony and Loki being a little shit. As usual.
"You make a good point." Coulson found himself unable to keep from laughing at the mental image. "Sorry, I'm sorry, that just..." He trailed off, still chuckling, and then got himself more under control. "No, that probably wouldn't be good for anyone's self confidence. Besides, there's no reason to. I told you before, the door's open. I meant it. Still do. Even at two in the morning, you're welcome. I can even get you a key if you want to crash here sometimes when I'm on assignment."
"Good." Phil looked very obviously pleased to have the matter settled enough for the two of them. "No problems there." It was surprisingly easy negotiating the first few issues that might crop up. Clint was willing to be monogamous, neither of them had a problem going public, and Clint wasn't leaving for the night. "I figured I'd have a good time tonight. I feel like a third wheel sometimes, but it's still always fun going out with the team. I just didn't think... this isn't something I really ever thought was a possibility."
"We're counting on it," Fury agreed. "Summers, you willing to stay behind to coordinate with the X-Men?"
"Yeah, looks like it," Bruce agreed, hoping that solving that problem didn't involve losing another teammate. He wasn't sure any of them could cope with that. "We've got Thor back, and at least Clint can survive using the hammer, theoretically. Having him alive means he has a chance of recovery, however long it takes."
A few minutes' walk had them standing in front of Darien's new quarters. "You'll be staying here. You can use the rec room, gym, etcetera down the hallway," he pointed, "and the full kitchen's the other way. Kitchenette in the suite. Just don't leave this floor, or security will want some answers." He paused, giving Darien another almost awkwardly long look. "Need anything else?"
In which we check in on the prisoners, and the status quo is mostly maintained.
"Somewhere," Hank muttered under his breath, clinging to the top of another shelf as he watched in fascination. Hearing Steve grunt, he leapt for that particular fray. "Good Captain, may I be of assistance?" he asked, lunging for the absurdly fast and flexible mutant Steve found himself pitted against.
"Good plan." Tony didn't know how much time they had, but he was going to make a bee-line for his suite and spend every last minute tangled up with Steve in every sense he could think of.
"I never said you did," Phil answered mildly. "I just pointed out that if you're holding back, it's a bad idea. That's all." He crossed his arms and leaned back in the plastic seat as if it was perfectly comfortable. "We don't have the same kind of skills that Xavier had at his disposal, but it's still a bad idea to dismiss what we do have."
Steve cleared his throat pointedly and tried not to look too pleased when Tony froze like a kid with his hand in the cookie jar. "The charge nurse said I can take over this afternoon… but not if you keep doing that. Keep that up and she's going to knock you out until your stitches heal. She already cleared it with Fury."
"Someone has to," Steve agreed. They were doing something entirely new. He was intensely grateful to be doing that thing with Tony by his side. He needed that sure, comforting familiarity to keep hold of himself. Steve let his gaze stray to the nearest clock on the wall and groaned, his arms tightening around Tony's neck. "I have to let you go soon." His voice dropped, and he leaned in to whisper the rest in Tony's ear, "If you still want to keep that promise from the other night... we can maybe see what we've got time for tonight." The situation had changed and so had the playing field, but Steve found himself hoping that Tony might still be up for trying something new.
That sounded like a solid plan. Steve hefted his suitcase and, after a pause in which he waited pointedly and in vain for Tony to get his, grabbed his teammate's case as well. The trip home wasn't as bad as Steve might've anticipated with Logan and Tony trapped in a small space together. Neither man killed or tried to kill the other, and Steve even managed to get some sketching done. By the time they arrived at Avengers tower, Steve was starting to believe that things might actually be alright.
The tears were back, but Steve could feel some of the weight lifting from his shoulders. He'd needed to hear it. Hoping for it was one thing, but hearing Tony say it and knowing that he meant it made him think that maybe he could manage even if they couldn't fix things. He couldn't speak, so he reached his hand out for Tony's and held on as tightly as he could manage. He needed every ounce of warmth and comfort his lover could offer even if he felt awful taking it when Tony should be healing himself. Steve looked around and spotted a pad on the nightstand, jerking his head toward it.
It was a little below the belt having Jarvis keep an eye out and let him know when Steve was away from the room, but being a spy meant working that way sometimes. Coulson knocked firmly on the door and waited. They needed to know that Barnes was safe - and that, by extension, Steve was safe. It wasn’t a pretty job, but it was an important job. Coulson and Fury had both agreed that Barnes alone was more likely to say something revealing than Barnes in front of Steve ever would.
Phil rolled his eyes but couldn't help a flash of fondness. He always enjoyed working with Clint and Natasha because there was an odd sort of synergy between them, each possessing something that the other lacked. Clint definitely had most of the energy. For someone who could sit, barely breathing, for hours while he waited for a target, Clint was a mass of fidgeting nerves most of the time. Phil reached out, popping open a panel on the dash, and pointed to a more up-to-date interface than the one displayed on Lola's otherwise vintage-looking radio. "There's a week's worth of music programmed in there. If you can't find something you enjoy, I despair of your taste."
Steve squirmed at the touch and let out a sigh of frustration when Tony made no move to actually do anything more than tease. "Tony, please?" he finally whispered against Tony's lips, following the request with a kiss that he hoped would melt the last of Tony's resolve soundly. It worked for his own, and Steve was tugging Tony's jeans down his hips to grab a handful of the man's ass in short order.
"Tony? You still with us?" the woman asked in a softer tone while Clint kicked their new captive none-too-gently in the side to make sure he was out. As she spoke, Natasha began unfastening the leather straps holding Tony down. "Can you walk?" She glanced around and nodded toward the pile of clothes in the corner. Clint handed her Tony's pants a beat later and Natasha immediately began helping him into them. The less wrecked he looked by the time Steve and Thor joined them, the better.
Hearing Scott's shaky pleas was almost too much. "You can... nng... cum when I do," he managed, shivering as his next few thrusts put him over his limit. His hips slammed upward into the other man, his arms pulling Scott down into him as Clint cried out in unbridled pleasure. He bit into Scott's shoulder, stifling his cries as he spilled himself inside Scott's tight body.
Clint sighed happily, letting Phil work. "God, you're good at that. I mean, I knew you could patch folks up in a pinch, but... I think you should be a doctor. Or at least my doctor. No playing doctor, though. That's a little weird," he decided. He knew he was rambling, but he felt too relaxed and comfortable to worry about what Phil might think. Phil smelled amazing, even under the beer and fried food, and there was a halfway decent band on the stage. Clint wondered absently if this was what everyday life was like for normal people.
Steve blushed but nodded bashfully. "I work with the Avengers," he allowed.
Clint nodded, idly munching popcorn. "Yeah, we actually talked about maybe doing some camping and fishing. I might have to talk him into the boar hunting, though," he said with a wry grin. "He apparently thinks that shooting at an animal that can tear your legs off isn't very relaxing." He shook his head. "Some people. Just can't get them to try things before they decide they won't like them."
While Fitz looked openly offended, Simmons beamed her pleasure. She passed her counterpart a smug smile and went back to eating her sandwich.
Logan growled his pleasure as their tongues dueled. "Love seeing you like this," he murmured between kisses. "Needy and out o' control." His breath puffed hot and hard against Scott's neck as he loosened the man up and slowly worked another finger into his body. "You just act controlled, but you're really a little slut for me, aren't ya?" Scott had responded well enough to some rough talk before, and Logan was curious to see if it still held true.
Phil nodded slowly. "There's something to be said for that, but the people we take orders from are barely alright with the team we have now. Adding Scott and Logan to the team has been... controversial would be a gentle way to put it. I'm not sure even Director Fury could get us cleared to contact Xavier for anything but information sharing."
Tony opened his mouth, then shut it. Bruce wasn't going to budge. At least not right then. Tony was already hatching a way to make sure Steve was with him the next time they talked. He was hoping a sympathy angle might help.
"A look around his head… which doesn't sound better," Steve admitted. "Unfortunately since even Logan doesn't know what he knows, it's impossible to say what Loki was looking for." At least thinking about it was getting Tony's mind off of being injured and disgruntled at the temporary captivity. "Could've been anything."
"Thanks, but I'll pass on that. SHIELD should have more guards up here in another hour or so. I'll get some-" The sound of the door slamming open behind them had Steve on his feet in moments despite the fact that he had felt dead tired moments before. The sight that greeted him left Steve reeling all over again. The man that Natasha and Clint were supposed to be tracking stood in front of him, and there were no grainy security images to hide any hope that it might be someone else. "Bucky..." The word trailed off as the other man's expression didn't change in the slightest.
Steve was breathless by the time Logan gave him even a second to recover. He was still boneless and blissed out from his climax and it actually took him a minute to register everything that had happened in such quick succession. When it caught up with him, Steve couldn't help but smile at the look of hunger on Logan's face. He reached up and pulled the man down again, the kiss crushing and harsh and kind of amazing. He wasn't going to hurt Logan - or if he did the man would heal just as quickly as he could himself. It was heady and strange to think that neither one of them needed to be cautious or careful.
Having worked for SHIELD for a good decade plus, Clint rarely found himself surprised, but Steve's confessions left him fighting to keep his jaw from hitting the table. Not so much the "what" as the "who," of course. Then there was another struggle to keep from imagining a little too vividly what Steve and Tony would look like tangled around one another, not to mention a third participant in on the action. While Tony had never screamed "super manly," he also didn't seem the sort to be very careful about hiding any of his exploits. Clint's first thought was to ask how the sex was, but he remembered a moment later that Steve probably wouldn't appreciate an interrogation. "I w... uh... Well... That wasn’t what I was expecting. I can relate to that some, though," he admitted, his thoughts drifting to Nat. She had no reservations about tying him up and fucking him senseless, but she had a tendency to shy away if he tried to get close or get her to go on a date with him. He never really knew where he stood with her The one time he'd left her flowers, she'd never mentioned them. Clint knew Tony's reputation even if he didn’t know Logan’s. He could sure as hell relate to Steve's predicament. He furrowed his brow at the other man. "It's scarier to ask and possibly run them off than it is to just keep what you have, huh?"
Steve shuddered at the touch of Tony's fingers. The things the man could do to machines and robots mirrored the things he could do with a man's body pretty accurately. Having that intensity and that focus brought to bear on him never failed to get Steve off. "I want you really badly," he agreed in a husky whisper. Steve glanced over his shoulder and flashed Tony a smile that was far too wicked to belong on any of his old promo posters. "If you're trying to get me to beg, all you have to do is ask nicely."
Logan frowned, feeling a stab of sympathy for the other man. It had to suck to think the one set of people you thought of as family hadn't made the effort to see how you were doing, especially when one of those people was your fiance. "So you're not on such great terms, then?" Scott had made it clear he'd been uncomfortable at the mansion, but Logan wouldn't have expected the amount of bitterness he was seeing. Chuck would check on anyone who'd left. Xavier had already decided that every mutant in the world was his problem, whether they wanted to be or not.
Clint shifted uncomfortably as he looked to Nat. He knew she could probably see his anxiety, even if most people wouldn't have. He started to tell her he was fine anyway, knowing that she'd take it as a signal to leave him alone if nothing else. He realized, though, that shutting out one of his closest friends was probably not the best route to recovery. "I... We're not. Not really," he said quietly, averting his gaze uneasily. He knew intellectually that he had nothing to fear from Nat, but it was still uncomfortable telling her. "Maybe... maybe we can talk when we have some privacy. The three of us." He didn't want Phil left out. The man had a right to know what was said and give his own perspective if he felt like it.
"Oh, so now it's MY raygun."
Logan raised an eyebrow. "Did I imagine it, or was that thing givin' you attitude?"
Phil had seen Clint naked before, but since he made it a point not to ogle other guys at the gym when he could help it, and they'd hardly taken anything off at the club... He found himself staring openly at the man straddling his lap and enjoying every second of it. Clint was sinfully gorgeous, all long, lean lines and sinewy muscle. Phil honestly couldn't decide what to touch first, so he settled for taking a leisurely tour over the whole of Clint's chest with his fingertips. The touches were light and exploratory, finally settling on a paler line of flesh at the bottom of Clint's ribs. "Where'd you get this one?"
Logan nodded thoughtfully, taking a big swig from his beer bottle. "Yeah, I can see that, but that's the good thing about you," he said, chancing a glance at the other man and then just as quickly looking away. He couldn't quite bring himself to tell Scott why he liked him and look at the other man at the same time. "You're stable. You always had your shit together. You weren't out chasin' ghosts whenever you felt like it. And you knew how to think things through." He looked at Scott and grinned a little. "Y'know, before you were ass-deep in trouble."
"Ships are fueled and pilots are standing by. Stark, Jarvis has it uploaded to the suit. We're prepared to take two teams.” Coulson glanced at Darien, “Have the techs show you the way around comms duty,” before turning his gaze to Steve, “Captain?"
"Not at the moment, no," Coulson agreed mildly. "Though it's nice to hear that you're willing to go that far for us. Director Fury will be pleased. I have good news and bad news. Since you get both, it doesn't matter which you hear first. The good news is that since you were only part of the crowd in the video that's making the rounds, your presence is not required for the press interviews that Captain Rogers and Mr. Stark will be participating in this morning. The bad news," he explained while holding out a text-light memo to Logan, "is that we've received word that the commander of your former team has been kidnapped. Very little intel right now as you can see. We don't know who or why, though we have some suspicions."
Tony shrugged. "Or they'll just wonder why you're turning colors," he pointed out. He tilted his head. He hadn't missed the flinch. "So, why not just cover it with an illusion? I mean, if you can turn into..." He swallowed hard, unable to finish the sentence, and looked away. "Point being, you could just cover it up if it bugs you that much." His voice tensed a little as he added, "I mean, if you can do it while you're fucking me, it must not be that tough to do, right?" He knew he was pushing buttons, but he couldn't quite bring himself to care. He'd promised to do what Loki told him to do. He'd said nothing about being nice, and Tony wasn't any more above playing semantics than Loki was.
"That's what missions are for. Put the LZ in my HUD and we'll put a pin in your idea of what I need to test," he told the AI, though he had to admit that he hadn't been entirely sure that nano-based thrusters would work. Tony did a few fancy moves before he leveled off and started angling toward the landing zone.
Steve had stopped drawing while Tony fit the piece into its socket. He'd nearly stopped breathing. From the look on Tony's face, he wasn't the only one. He didn't let himself say again the he didn't have to do it or point out that the idea was crazy. He bit his tongue and prayed that it wouldn't matter what he said or thought, prayed that Tony would just be safe and that they'd laugh later over how terrified they'd been. "I'll wait here," Steve finally decided. "Pretty sure I'm not gonna be a lot of help explaining the specs."
Simmons rolled her eyes and started the simulation again. She pulled her phone out and, before she could get nervous and talk herself out of it, shot Bruce a quick text: COFFEE WOULD BE LOVELY.
Clint huffed, tearing his eyes away from the two and grumbling that they could stand to get a room. //Mostly so I don't wind up standing here with a raging boner. Awkward.//
Steve arched an eyebrow at the thought. “Hmm, well, I guess you have had a few years to watch Pepper,” he decided. If Tony couldn’t learn proper worrying technique from her, he was out of luck. Steve tucked into his food with a feeling of warmth suffusing his mind and heart. “I know it’s going to sound a little cheesy, but there’s not a single place I’d rather be than right here with you.”
Clint was appreciative of the reassuring touch. "Thanks," he murmured, rubbing his right hand over his other arm as he tried to ignore the strange tingle in the limb. "Glad to be getting away from that thing. It was too close, Coulson. I felt too close to losing it again," he confessed shakily. "Gotta give you credit, though. You didn't seem to have any problem putting it down." Then again, it shouldn't have surprised Clint. Coulson had nerves of steel and an ironclad mind to go with them.
Steve drew in a breath and said, "Okay, that's got us. Everybody who's going, suit up. The rest of us will be here on call, hopefully with some of the X-Men within the next hour or two. Be careful." He rose, shaking each person's hand in turn and nodded to Lady Sif. "Everyone who's going with Sif, meet her out front."
Bucky, genuinely surprised to see Steve, perked up a little. "I'd be a lot better if you could spring me out of here," he answered honestly. A part of him was desperate to ask Steve how things had gone with Tony. He could easily lose his best friend to the other man. Then Steve would forget about him and Bucky would be left all alone. That sparked dangerous thoughts in his mind, thoughts of somehow getting Tony Stark out of the picture permanently. But Bucky quickly dismissed such reckless ideas. It frightened him how quickly violent notions entered his head. Realizing he'd zoned out for a moment, Bucky added with a light tone, "I think I've had enough migraines to last a lifetime."
Tony's HUD quickly told him just how many mutants were there on Loki's side. "Maybe we should've invited the X-Men," he muttered to Logan, who was already shouldering the gun and moving for a better angle. To Loki, Tony shot back, "Not a bad entrance. But you left a better impression at the tower." He smirked at the god as the Hulk edged closer.
"Made it," Scott answered with a wan smile. "No body to pick up." He met Logan's gaze and added, "I know I keep saying this, but thank you. All that crap before you left... it was stupid. I'm not saying you weren't stupid too," Scott added, "but you... you loved her. The whole thing didn't have to be a mess like it was." He sighed and shook his head. "Not that it matters right now. What does SHIELD need to know to find these guys and shut down every last cockroach running around the operation?"
The intimacy of looking up at Logan and having him look straight back was shockingly addictive. At first the press of the finger was uncomfortable, but it took little more than a deep breath to clear that. "That's.. it's different." Scott laughed quietly. He shifted to show Logan that his physical interest had not diminished in the slightest.
Loki hummed a sound that might have been agreement. "Creed is difficult to control. Unpredictable. It can be exciting, of course... and tedious." He still wondered how a man like Magneto could put up with the mutant's shifting moods and hair trigger temper. He'd caught a flicker of something when he touched Stark and pressed the advantage by moving in a bit closer. "I may not yet be crazy enough to appreciate him to the fullest extent." Loki leaned in until his lips were a breath away from the mortal's. "How crazy are you?"
Here be plot and smut. Have I mentioned lately how much I love Tony & Steve?
Logan shook his head and suppressed a faint grin. Stark was as deeply apathetic toward societal norms as the press would have everyone believe. He wondered, though, what Steve thought "us" meant. The guy was, naturally, old-fashioned in a lot of his worldview, and Stark clearly didn't know the meaning of the word "commitment." //Then again, I don't exactly have a great track record in that department.//
Tony tensed, his hand rising reflexively as if to push the god away, but instead his fingers rested lightly on the soft fabric of Loki's shirt. It wasn't bad. At all. In fact, it was kind of good, which just wound Tony a little tighter. His fingers curled into the green cloth beneath them, and even Tony wasn't sure if it was to hold Loki in place or push him away, but he did neither, instead hanging on for dear life... or perhaps sanity. His mouth finally yielded to the contact, letting the tongue dragging across his lips dip into his mouth and gently sucking on it.
"I didn't program you to think!"
Tony was busy answering Steve's question, though. "Once in awhile. When I want something different." He ordered another drink for himself from Danny, giving the bartender a wink when Danny did a little flirting of his own. "Found it when I got lost, actually. Or was that when I got drunk?"
Fury nodded. "I'll trust your opinion." Noting that Barton looked ready to pipe up again, Fury pointed at him. "You spotted the issue first. You're in charge of keeping an eye on him. You see any cracks, any craziness, any weird blue eyes, you let me know. Or just kill him right there."
"I like that too. It's different. Just running into someone while I'm grabbing a cup of coffee." Phil followed the observation with a wry smile given the rather awkward encounter the day before. "As for Loki, we're going to find him, and we're going to take him out. And this time we're going to speak to Thor about a more permanent solution to the issue." They couldn't force the future king of Asgard to kill his brother, but they could strongly suggest it. At the very least Coulson wanted to know how the hell Loki had come to be free again to start with. He was dangerous enough in chains. More quietly, he added, "I don't like that we haven't heard from Thor in all of this. It makes me nervous."
"That may actually mean we're screwed, yes," Phil agreed. "It may be why they still have Romanov. If Loki or his allies are looking for something, she might know some of the places SHIELD would put it." He stared at the file as if it might somehow spit out more information. "So much for drinking to forget."
"Steve! Just tied up my little project, and I'm bored. You guys doing anything?"
"Love the way you look all the time," Steve countered with a smirk. Feeling Tony hard and eager against him dissolved the last of his worries. Tony wanted him, was still turned on against all reason. It felt fantastic. He let out a sigh as their bodies melted together. He knew what Tony was feeling, that uncertainty, the desire not to push too far too fast. "I won't break." Steve rolled his hips to remind Tony just how turned on how was. "Promise."
It was more than enough. Deadly force. Pain. Broken bones. The Hulk didn't need any more excuses. Banner curled up with a roar of anger and pain, and then what had been Bruce Banner a moment ago stood, looming over Creed, clearly blaming the relatively tiny mutant for his discomfort.
Clint listened raptly, and he felt his heart sink at the news. While they'd managed thus far without the god, the idea that he definitely wasn't going to show up was a massive letdown. "So that leaves us with trying to find a way to kill Loki on our own. The hammer-"
"I am your queen and your mother," the woman replied, bringing every inch of her gravitas to bear on the words. Many of the guards flinched openly, and Natasha made a note not to piss Frigga off. Thor's mother definitely knew how to make herself intimidating. It was impressive. Frigga raised a hand, focusing on Thor, tendrils of glittering yellow spiraling out from her hands. Only the tight set of Frigga's jaw showed precisely how much effort the spell took. "Your brother has taken enough from all of us. Come back to me."
Steve couldn't respond at first because he couldn't catch his breath. It was shockingly hot to have Tony drawing things out. Normally his lover was the impatient one, the one who jumped in feet first and forget about the consequences until they became inconvenient. Instead Tony was the one stroking him and telling him to wait it out. Steve let out a low moan as as Tony's hard cock pressed up against him and promised everything that would come if he could wait long enough. "Tony," he moaned, rocking back against his lover's finger and making it clear that he approved heartily of the treatment.
"We all need some sort of entertainment, Stark," Loki hissed in reply. The comment had cut in a troubling fashion, and he didn't want to let the man get under his skin. It was supposed to be the other way around. He breathed deeply to calm the tremble within at the idea of how lonely he really was. "The deal is made." It took little effort even in his weakened state to reach out to Creed. //Let them live. Do what you will with them otherwise, but they live.// Loki was certain that Creed would obey. The man was impulsive and at times foolish, but he was a good soldier in his way. Magneto hadn't been wrong about that. "You still think that someone's going to rescue you, don't you, Stark? Do you really think that they would risk their lives for your body?"
Clint paused mid-swig, beer bottle in the air, as his eyes drifted to Scott. He slowly lowered the bottle, wondering what in hell Scott would want to ask him. The archer couldn't think of anything inappropriate that didn't involve... //Well, he is hot as hell.// It wasn't hard to figure out what Logan saw in the guy. But Clint was also pretty aware that if Logan did get released, the man would probably not appreciate hearing -  //Woah. Could be something way less weird. Calm down.// "I... uh... sure?" he said uncertainly. "No guarantees on an answer, but you can ask." He offered a faint smile.
Clint spoke up before Phil had a chance. "Sir, Logan's already offered to gut me. I think - "
Bruce couldn't help the smile that crept onto his lips. He knew she was trying to distract him, and it was definitely endearing. "They are pretty amazing," he said, giving her a dopey grin before blushing and refocusing his attention on the muffin. He took a couple bites, then shook his head. "I know what you're wondering. With Barton, I mean. I guess the hammer's attached to him somehow now. He's the only one that can use it."
"Drive careful."
They all assembled in the garage roughly within the suggested timeframe. Coulson had shed his suit and gone for dark jeans and a button down shirt instead, glasses in the place of his usual contacts. If he was going to sit in a smoky bar all night, lugging around eye drops wasn't his idea of a good time. At least this time the novelty t-shirts were safely stowed in his drawer.
Relieved to be taking Steve out of there, Tony grasped the wheelchair handles and did as he was told for once. Knowing the tower as he did, Tony managed to whisk Steve back up to his room with no one the wiser. The moment he got in the door, he leaned down and kissed Steve slow and deep before drawing away. "Welcome home," he said with a smile and a grand sweep of his hand. "Need anything to eat? Coffee?"
The tension in the conference room was thick as Tony settled in. What was left of their team was already suited up, and Tony looked around at them all, sizing them up before Fury started to talk.
Clint's face twisted into a sadistic smirk at that idea. "I like that plan. Wonder how many times I can put him down before he begs me to stop," the archer muttered. He'd tied the hammer to his belt but he kept a hand on it, fingers idly tracing the runes on the handle as they walked. His eyes shimmered strangely. "I wanna see him break. Both of them."
Victor chuckled at Phil through razor fangs. He had Clint pulled tight against him by the wrists, seemingly barely affected by the archer's attempts to squirm free. Victor's free hand curved around Clint's throat, index finger and thumb digging into tender points right behind the man's jaw. Clint made a quiet sound of protest, but none of the defiance faded from his eyes even as he went still in the mutant's grasp.
Clint nodded, taking a deep breath to get hold of himself. He hadn't missed Phil's convulsive swallowing. "Just for the record," he said quietly, tilting his head to make sure Coulson looked at him, "if you ever need to cry, you can. I mean, I'm clumsy and terrible at handling that sort of thing, but... I'll do my best." He smirked faintly. "One of the probie handlers you sent me out with ended up crying on me about his grandma, and I think that's about as awkward as humanly possible. And I still didn't throw him out of the sniper nest." He paused. "If I ever do see Ward cry again, I might just run away. But if it's you, I'll stick around."|
"Hydra's not a big fan of mine," Steve replied, though he wondered if that could be all it was. He shook his head. "I don't know." It was hard to think at all when he wanted to run out the door, find Tony, and get him home again.
Fitz wasn't far behind. "A lot of it's vintage Hydra, and since the gun worked out so fantastically, we-"
(See the end of the chapter for
"We need you to shut up. No one's dealing."
One would think a large, mystical hammer would stand out. The sheer volume of things crammed into the warehouse meant precisely the opposite. Steve squinted at the shelves, the fluorescent light only dimly illuminating the backs of each one. "It's like the world's least organized library."
Logan was a little less inclined to wax over the truth, though, "The Cap can't be gay - or bi - as far as those government suits are concerned. I mean, you're the Red, White, 'n' Blue incarnate. Blonde hair, blue eyes, devout Christian, non-drinking, non-smoking, non-dancing, goody-two-shoes representative o' the whole nation." He shrugged. "They're just pissed that they lost the last superhero that even the radical far right could get behind. You'll get used to it. I have. 'Course, I'm sure Tony's pet spin doctors can come up with somethin'...”
Clint's smile was faint but genuine. He leaned in to brush his lips to Phil's. "Guess we both let this sneak up on us," he said, shifting a little on his handler's lap to lean on to press his lips to Phil's collarbone, his hands resting lightly on the man's shoulders. "Or at least I did. But I guess not every ambush ends badly."
The pain medication did its job well. Tony slept through the night, blissfully unaware of his aching wounds. His slumber went interrupted despite a series of bizarre dreams brought on by the pharmaceutical products swimming through his system. When Tony finally woke, it was with an almighty effort. He found his mouth terribly dry, and he fought to focus his vision. Tony glanced across the room and was greeted with the sight of Steve asleep on the couch. A rush of warmth filled his heart, shocking him with its intensity. Did Steve care for him enough to keep watch over him, or was he being overprotective because his presumed-dead best friend was involved? Clearing his throat softly, Tony tried to sit up only to groan aloud as a sharp pang shot through his torso.
J nodded and moved over, muttering in a broken foreign dialect with a thuggish looking man who glared briefly at Logan before stalking off downstairs. J meanwhile bustled around the room making sure the windows were properly covered and the door leading out properly locked. "You see, you like. Very pretty, but how you say headstrong. Little bruised," he admitted with a shrug too casual to suggest he really cared that the merchandise had done too much mouthing off.
Logan couldn't entirely suppress a smirk. "So this happens a lot, huh?" Reaching out, he grabbed the case of cigars out of Tony's breast pocket. "Y'know, I think I'll have one o' these after all," he said, helping himself and lighting it. It had been awhile since Logan had had anything nice. "Let's go. Before we completely wear out my welcome. I kinda like this place."
The man shot back, "Many military heads have criticized Director Fury for putting someone so young in charge of such a unusual unit."
"Good. Then we're fine." Phil wasn't sure it was true, but he honest to god hoped it was. Logan was an asset, and Scott could be a huge help to them once he was settled in. They were both good allies to have. He paused and decided it was as good a time as any to let them know where he and Clint had gone. "Barton and I took a little drive, ended up in Westchester. Jean told me to let you know that you're missed."
Logan let Scott drag him onto the dance floor. Somewhere in the back of his brain, he realized he might know how to do some ballroom dancing of his own, but the beat was far too fast for anything like that. Letting Scott take the lead, he grinned as they both awkwardly managed some sense of rhythmic movement. It was stupid, he felt stupid, but Scott seemed to be having fun. That was all it took to make Logan feel sure it was completely worth it.
"Mmm," Phil agreed, his back braced against the tree and his arm carefully closed around Clint. He hadn't been sure at first if that would be alright, but the feeling of Clint's body molding itself to his was enough to tell Phil that it certainly was. The day was quickly becoming one of Phil's favorites. It didn't matter what they did or that the band was more mediocre than talented. The only thing that struck a chord was the man by his side. Given that they were one of the more mundane-looking couples in the place, they drew relatively little attention. The lack of scrutiny made Phil feel pleasantly lost in the crowd, luxuriating in being with Clint instead of worrying for once. "This? This is perfect."
Tony did not have to think twice about the suggestion. "I'd love that," he enthused, flashing Steve a warm smile. "I'm afraid cooking from scratch is one of the few things outside the scope of my genius, so you'll have to make another fantastic meal. Or we can always order in." Either way Tony would be content in Steve's company. He felt a sense of relief wash over him that the evening had gone so well. Indeed, he and Steve had already made a second date and the night wasn't even over yet. Tony knew that the other man was being cautious due to his current state, and the billionaire appreciated Steve more for his kindness.
In which Phil & Clint are left in Creed's keeping, and things are as horrifying as anticipated.
Thor could see the pain in his brother, and it cut at him, as well. The god silently resolved to himself to talk with his brother when they had privacy. "Brother, perhaps you should take a seat," he suggested gently, gesturing toward an empty chair near one of the consoles.
"If you start to sing, I'll punch you, adamantium skeleton or no," Scott grumbled in return, though he smirked a second later. "Yeah, maybe being a total dick to you was the same. As it turns out, maybe I was just desperately sexually repressed and subconsciously knew that you would be a really good option to take care of that." He leaned in and kissed Logan thoroughly only to sag back down onto the bed, exhausted. "I need sleep."
A sharp knock sounded at the door and was followed by Coulson opening it a crack. He averted his eyes but still informed them, "Logan's going on assignment. The head of his old team went AWOL. Figured you'd both want to know. Be sure you zip up before you come out."
Logan opened his mouth to answer, then just nodded. "I'm sorry," he said, looking at both Bruce and Nat. "I didn't know 'im that well, but..." Trailing off, he clenched his jaw and shook his head, taking Scott's hand and heading back to his room. It always seemed like it should get easier, losing a team member. It never did.
"Don't worry, Jolly Green. I'll make sure you don't break Manhattan," Tony assured. "Everyone get in the jets."
Logan helped himself to a good sized pile of eggs and bacon and started wolfing them down like he expected someone to take the plate from him at any moment. "So what now? You guys show me some cleverly disguised secret facility with an airplane under the basketball court? You're gonna have to do a lot if you wanna show Xavier up."
"Whatever happened to 'go big or go home'?" Tony wondered aloud, though he didn't argue. "Fine. I vote for a cabin in the backwoods of Europe somewhere, though. And we don't need plane tickets. I have a few of those things laying around somewhere. Planes. I'm kind of a rich guy, remember?" Tony hadn't really used any of his private jets since developing the suit, so it seemed like as good an excuse as any to dig one out of the mothballs.
"Your little dance floor session is all over the internet. Put me on speakerphone. Stark is there, isn't he?"
"I'm really, really okay with that. Not that I'm trying to plan things out too much, but do you think you might like to get some stuff and crash with me again tonight? I promise I'm not propositioning you, but I think there's a good chance we'll be up early enough to see the sun rise." If Loki had things planned, he doubted the god would wait until a decent hour to unroll his evil schemes. "To be honest, I sleep better when you're close."
Tony had opened his mouth to tell his lover to lay down next to him when the illusion disappeared. He shuddered and recoiled at the god's touch, fear washing over his expression again. "Don't touch me," he growled reflexively, regretting the words almost immediately. He knew it was partially\ his own fault, and he realized a moment later with a chill that he was more angry that Loki had dropped the glamour than he was that the god had done it in the first place. He took a deep breath, trying to keep himself calm. There was no point in feeling guilty. It wasn't like Steve was ever going to see him again. Mostly, he just didn't like the pointed reminder that he'd been fucking Loki, and he wanted to go back to the soothing deception.
"Yes. Yes, he..." Honestly she had no idea if he would be the least bit pleased. Steve had been through too much. "Well, I suspect that he'll be happy to be back in the fight." After a moment of uncomfortable silence, she suggested, "Jarvis? When Captain Rogers wakes up, could you let him know that we'd like to see him?" She didn't miss the note of distinct sadness in Jarvis' voice when he agreed. He might have been AI, but he'd been programmed by Tony Stark, and apparently there were downsides to that brilliance. "Thank you. Dr. Banner, if you'd like to get rest, we can keep watch here."
"Yeah." Except it did, and they both knew that. It didn't matter because of what anyone would say about their relationship. Steve felt fairly confident that at least inside the Tower, no one was likely to doubt that. It mattered because they'd planned for a whole life, and they'd barely gotten to taste what it could have been. It mattered because they'd been robbed of something precious. "I guess I should get down to the lab."
Steve smiled back, the corner of his lips quirking upward. “You might feel a little differently if you’d met me back then, but… thank you. I can’t say I ever did anything like graduating college before most people hit high school, though. You aren’t the only one who’s done some file reading. All that stuff I said when we met? I was wrong. Really, really wrong.”
"We can make sure you won't be a danger to yourself or others," Coulson agreed. He stood back, out of reach, leaving Clint a clear shot at all times. "You're doing the right thing. If we're compromised, Loki has a better shot at winning - and I don't think any of us wants that."
Instead of being put out by the lack of hospitality, Sif placed her hands on the conference table and met his gaze intently. "Thor is in the grip of some spell, our king lies in the Odinsleep, and the Lady Frigga is being held by a companion of Loki's."
Clint smiled faintly, standing. "Yeah, guess so. Doesn't feel like anything broken, but what the hell." He glanced at the hammer, which seemed to be practically begging for attention from its unceremonious spot in the forward corner of the plane. The archer shifted uneasily, glancing at Phil. "So... how do we get that thing to research without getting close enough to touch it? I'm betting Fury doesn't have any ten foot tongs laying around." In spite of his casual tone, Clint was internally a mess. Part of him wanted to pick the thing up and carry it, and the other part was so terrified of losing himself in the artifact that he wanted to bolt from the plane and go hide in his room.
Scott watched Steve go with a sense of relief. He moved into Logan's personal space as soon as the Captain headed out. "You okay?" He knew strolls down memory lane rarely did anything to make Logan feel good. The strange thing was the way he'd been watching Steve, a predatory flicker of something that made Scott think uncomfortably about some encounters they'd had involving Jean. "Sounds like we're in reserve until he has a chance to talk to Fury. We could go back to bed if you want." Scott said no more, uncertain if Logan would want to bury himself in the dark and sleep or do something else entirely. Given the thoughts he might've waded through to provide Steve even the small sliver of information, he knew it could go either way.
"He's not a prisoner," Coulson assured. "Things have just been a little complicated. Fury's hedging his bets. He didn't ask for a second opinion."
Phil laughed at that idea. He wasn't sure he'd ever know everything about Clint, let alone learn it in a single afternoon. "I know one," he allowed. "I guess that means the next step is you figuring out all my secrets. You and Natasha probably already know than anybody else alive." Not even Fury knew him quite as well as they did. So many long missions away with the tight knit team meant that they'd learned things about each other that didn't get seen by the people in charge. It didn't mean, however, that they knew a lot of the deeper things. Phil tried to search his memory, wondering what Clint really knew about him even after so many years. "I'm guessing maybe not so much, though, really."
"He'll understand. Give 'im a call."
"Roger that."
Tony had to work hard to focus on Steve's words as the man worked a spot the man hadn't even known was a weakness until that moment. He squirmed between the tiled wall and his lover, making soft whimpering sounds that were borderline undignified. "Glad it helped," he managed, tilting his head so the water was no longer running down his face, though it had already done its job plastering dark curls to his forehead. "Wanted to make sure you... mm... had something in case the serum... was a bust. Or I didn't come back." He gasped and arched as Steve's teeth raked perfectly over the sensitive spot. "Wanted you safe."
"I would never subject you to the cafeteria." Steve rolled his eyes and got up to get dressed. "Even if you did his all the chefs there yourself."
"I like that plan," Tony decided, curling his arm under Steve's head to toy with soft blonde hair. He sighed. "Of course, you know that he'd just send Nat in through the window or something equally creepy-spy-like if he wanted to get in touch. Then again, throwing the phones in the wood chipper would make it clear just how little we want to hear from him. Maybe he'd avoid bothering us unnecessarily." He let his head fall back against the couch as well, turning his face so that he could press his forehead to Steve's. "Maybe I'll bring a bottle of vodka to distract Romanov if he sends her to find us."
Logan stilled at the reminder. He knew what he'd done to Scott himself. He didn't know what Barton had done, though he could guess that, in Scott's state at the time, it hadn't been gentle. Slowing his movements, he pressed his lips gently to Scott's neck. "Then maybe slow ain't such a bad idea after all," he murmured, gently sliding his hands down Scott's sides. His hands stopped at the man's hips and then moved back upwards, gently pushing Scott's shirt up a bit. Logan almost didn't want to see the bruises, to see what he and Clint had done to his lover.
Fury gave the agent a once over. "Keep an eye out, but yes. For now."
Clint smirked and then patted Darien's cheek as he stood. "Don't think I share just anywhere, anytime," he said with a faintly off-kilter smirk. Reaching down, he tangled his fingers into Darien's hair and pulled him into a possessive kiss. "Ready to head back to HQ? Maybe have a couple more beers and a BJ, then hit the sack?"
"I got stitches. It was almost dramatic." He pulled his own bottle of pills from his pocket and shook it. "Looks like we'll both have no problem with the sleeping part tonight, though." After a mission, sometimes it was almost better to have gotten a little hurt. The fidgety energy that came along with being constantly on edge for a few hours in a row often made it hard to come down and get proper rest despite being exhausted. "C'mon, I'll walk you to your room - unless you prefer my couch?"
Clint sighed, trying to calm himself. "There was something in his eyes," he whispered nervously.
Logan quirked a smile despite himself, but the expression faded just as fast. Steve hadn't really told him how Scott was, just that the man was there. "He didn't hurt anyone, did he?" he wanted to know, watching Steve's face closely. The cell muffled his senses, keeping him from being able to hear the other man's heartbeat, smell his sweat, do anything to tell if he was lying.
Clint smiled against Phil's skin, laughing softly. "Careful. I don't think my ego needs to be fed more," he said, nuzzling Phil's neck and kissing his way as far down as he could with the shirt still partially buttoned. He thought about unbuttoning the last few hanging on, but then reconsidered. He wanted things to stay slow, wanted to savor every moment. He couldn't resist running a teasing fingertip around the waistband of Phil's pants.
Unlike Logan, Steve couldn't help but smile at Tony's incessant wheedling attempts to get another drink out of the man. Still he snapped to focus at once when Logan asked about their potential foe. "More the second one, I think. He's a literal demigod. The upside is that his brother's fighting with us, the downside is that he's a real handful. This isn't going to be easy, but, then, you don't strike me as being much for easy. When Tony's a little less, um, relaxed and we're someplace more secure, he can pull up the files we have." Unable to resist asking, Steve ventured, "How far back to you remember?"
Steve watched in surprise as Pepper moved away to speak with some of the people standing worriedly on the sidelines and dismiss the remaining crowd. His forehead creased. Had something happened between Pepper and Tony? If they'd broken up, Tony certainly hadn't said anything. Of course, he never said anything about his personal life. Forcing that back for exploration at another time, Steve gently rubbed his thumb over Tony's palm instead. "You heard the lady, I need you to keep those eyes open. How are you feeling? You've got a nasty cut on your forehead, and your breathing sounds a little off..."
"Beer," Clint rasped, sagging onto a barstool and watching Coulson prepare their drinks. He was glad that Coulson, for whatever reason, had suggested a drink. Clint was usually a solitary person. He handled problems on his own, he sulked over things on his own, he had hobbies that involved lots of time spent alone. Typically, if he was pissed or scared or just moody, he chose to hide away in his room or a tent at a campsite rather than talk to someone. But right now, he needed someone who had some inkling of what was going on with him. As the bottle of stout was set in front of him, the archer took it with still-trembling fingers and dragged it closer to himself on the bar. He sipped at it before looking at Phil. "Thanks." He meant it in more ways than one. But he wasn't exactly great at talking about feelings.
"I will," Scott answered, happily curling in against Logan with no apparent concern for what anyone else would think.
Coulson hesitated and then shook his head. He caught May's eye and shrugged. "No, it isn't. There are weapons, salvaged tech, and... and a few prisoners deemed too dangerous for-" Coulson paused and put a code into a pad on the wall, "for release. Just letting the guards know we're friendly," he explained with a nod to the number pad. "Otherwise they'd be up here in about ten seconds with guns at the ready. I'd like to leave with the same number of holes in my body I have currently."
Thor frowned. "It could work. You clearly have a strong heart, friend Hawk, since you are not obviously aching to have the hammer with you right now. But if you wield it again, that could change."
"Not what I needed," Loki answered, working through a strong desire to reduce Creed to ash for being a smug bastard. "Not nearly what I needed." The instinct to kill Creed passed slowly, and he broke his gaze away from the mutant to give it a moment to move entirely from his mind. Erik would be less than pleased if he destroyed one of the man's favorite toys. "Asgardian weapons affect me differently. It will be days even with my not inconsiderable skills." The whole thing was humiliating and infuriating to the highest degree. "Do you have anything constructive to add, or shall I assume you're comfortable with the idea of me tearing you limb from limb to ease my nerves?"
Steve grabbed Tony's coffee and the bag of pastries and gladly gave him first dibs. As long as he had his breakfast with Tony, Steve didn't care what he was eating. "Think you'll be up to helping Bruce in the lab today if I grab a chair to get you down there?" The sooner they found a way to help their teammates, the better off they'd be.
After Fury had stormed off, Hawkeye had lingered, sitting numbly in his chair in the briefing room as Bruce had quietly slipped out. He stood at around the same moment as Coulson, and found himself slowly following the man out of the briefing room, hesitant to leave his side.
There was a disagreeable pause before the computer finally said, "Very well, sir."
"I would be most honored," Sif answered, smiling at the pair of them, the expression almost sly as she watched Scott step in closer. "I leave you to your own merriment, my new friends." She turned and followed Jarvis' polite directions to find Natasha.
Logan nodded. "I know what it's like to have relatives that need to be put down," he assured. "It ain't easy." He flicked another glance at Barton and Coulson before he could catch himself. "I guess you and I both have some ugly business to take care of."
"Well, I didn't run screamin' from Magneto, and havin' a metal skeleton is about the last place you wanna be facing him down." He glanced at Tony. "Well, maybe the second-to-last place. I'm in, but you might wanna keep some kinda failsafe handy in case your drape-wearin' wingnut manages to scramble my brains."
“He’s in the lab, sir,” came the prompt reply. “He has asked not to-”
Natasha met May's gaze briefly. "I'll go. Agent May should stay here in case word comes in about Barton or Coulson." They were still keeping an eye out on the channels, but she knew that it was a long shot in a lot of ways. If Loki had them, they wouldn't be seeing them anytime soon. If ever. At least she knew May cared almost as much as she did about seeing it resolved positively and seeing Loki gutted. She explained to Sif, "Loki has two of ours." Her eyes narrowed. "He killed another."
Scott screamed Logan's name as he painted the comforter with his cum and spasmed around Logan's cock. He came so hard it almost hurt. As he descended from the height of pleasure, it did hurt, a gnawing ache that didn't make him regret a single second of the coupling. He could think of nothing to say, and Scott's muscles trembled too much for him to want to move, so he lay panting against the bed with Logan slumped against his back.
Logan raised an eyebrow. "Hey!"
"I'll get my own room," Scott answered with a sigh. He hated it. He wasn't ready to even pretend to be human again, but he knew that letting himself drift farther away from okay would help nothing. "I'll also go out in the sun eventually. Soon. It's just... I dunno. Anyway, I'd better get dressed. You don't have to play go-between on all this. I can talk to them, whoever their point person is." Maybe he would stay around in the long run, or at least until he had somewhere better to be. Scott knew the urge to help would rise again even if for the moment he felt like curling up in Logan's bed and sleeping until the world had safely passed him by.
It was easier said than done. Darien's fingers wriggled, and he rocked on his heels, trying to keep still and quiet. "Read any good books lately?"
Scott shifted, struck at the sudden chill. He looked back to realize that he was cold because the human blanket that had been warming him was no longer there. "You could warn a guy. It's chilly in here," he groused with a flicker of a smile before pulling away himself and stretching as he swung his legs over the side of the bed. "Look, I won't tell anybody you like to cuddle and you don't tell them I'm too scared to sleep alone. We both get to keep at least SOME of our pride."
Worked up as they both were, Scott wasn't far behind, his cock pulsing between them. He knew that by the afternoon, he'd feel enough soreness to regret the choice to some degree. In the moment he just felt sated. "Let's go lay down. Don't hafta sleep, but I think we're both going to lose feeling in our extremities if we try to stay like this." Carefully he unwrapped his legs from Logan's thighs and gingerly stepped into the bedroom. "Actually... shower. Shower, then bed. You want to join me?"
Clint couldn't help the smile that touched his lips when Phil dared the contact, even if it was just briefly. Deciding that it was too nice to stop, he chanced taking a firmer hold of the other man's hand, his fingers hooking over Phil's and holding tightly. They both needed it, and Clint felt fairly certain that Nat would run interference if necessary. He remembered then that Steve was talking and tuned in in time to register that the man was talking about a funeral for Tony. Clint swallowed around the lump in his throat. Tony had been a pain in the ass in a lot of ways, but he'd also been a part of the dysfunctional family that had come to live together in the tower.
"Guys..." Clint was holding up his hands and wondering when he became a mediator type. "Maybe... little less angry?"
Logan nodded. He hadn't missed the slight shift in Steve's demeanor at his suggestion of rest. He didn't know exactly what it meant, but he knew enough to know that he and Sif needed to give the blonde a moment. "Take your time," he agreed, gesturing to Sif to follow him.
"Sir? Might I show you something?"
"Oops, missed." The woman smiled in a way that would have been sweet if she hadn't looked suspiciously like Nat after she snapped the neck of someone who really deserved it. "I'm afraid Loki's busy at the moment, but he sent a few friends to say hello. So hello."
"What, no 'glad you're alive, Tony'?"
The sick look was replaced by something just as wild but far less certain. "He... he said that?"
"From you and from Mr. Stark, yes. Uh, Mr... er, Loki, I would like to examine you as well, but there's no hurry. You're welcome to settle into your room right now. I need to tend to Agent Barton if Dr. Banner is willing to stay and help?" Jemma cast Bruce a hopeful smile. Clint looked like death warmed over, and she wanted the back up if nothing else in case Clint lose it entirely. Even as she watched, Coulson was holding on a little tighter to the archer, silently and stoically protecting him from Loki. As if it would help if he really decided to try something.
"Have us killed."
"We're good," Bruce assured, smirking to himself.
"We'll figure it out," Logan assured, pulling Scott close for a quick kiss. "Just, right now, I don't think it's a great idea to tell 'em how you got your powers under control. Considerin' Loki managed to hijack Barton's brain at one time, I don't think they'd like the idea that he's been rummaging around in yours. And Barton's already got it in his head that Loki's callin' the shots on me."
"Over easy," Phil answered, leaning against the counter and savoring the luxury of letting someone else do the cooking. It was a bizarre thing, really, to let someone else take on the workload. He wasn't used to the division of labor at home. He wasn't used to not being alone. It was amazing. "And the bacon should be so crisp it snaps easily. I will never understand why anyone would have any use for soggy bacon."
Logan was relieved he was done eating, at least. "Guy doesn't fool around where booze is concerned, does he?" he asked, though he had to allow a grudging smirk. //Can't say I blame 'im.//
Tony had been trying to keep himself busy. Constantly busy, in fact. Anything to stop him from thinking too long. He had completed work on a new prototype armor and started on upgrading its weapons system. Having given specific instructions he was not to be disturbed, Tony glanced up with irritated surprise at the sound of a knock at the door. His first instinct was to simply ignore it, then he realized it might be Natasha, and Tony thought better of it. If he didn't answer, she would find some way past the security locks and that would not be pleasant.  Abandoning his work for the moment, Tony padded across the room and answered the door. "You don't have to keep checking on me," he was saying mid-stride, only to stop, the blood draining out of his face when he realized his guest wasn't Romanoff.
"Well, that's fair," Tony admitted, settling against his lover once again. "Back seat of the car was good, though, right?" he asked, running a hand down Steve's chest. "Not sure about how I feel about Romanov and Barton being there, though. If it's just them, they might wanna join in. Barton, at least." When Steve gave him a look, the billionaire shrugged. "He’s flexible. If you get my drift."
The archer didn't reply, instead sliding to his knees in the most graceful way imaginable, his hands still tangled in Phil's pants. He tugged pants and underwear away far enough to get at the goods, leaning in until he knew Coulson would feel his breath, then pausing and looking up. He made sure he had his handler's full attention before he slowly licked a line up Phil's cock. His hands were inside Phil's shirt again, callused fingers tracing circles on hot skin as he savored the taste of Phil's arousal on his tongue.
Clint looked up sharply. He'd been a mercenary set heavily against SHIELD when he'd been selected as an asset. If he'd been labeled a liability, SHIELD would have put him in a holding facility until they could decide what to do with him, which likely wouldn't have been anything pleasant. If Phil hadn't fought for him... "I had no idea," he said. He'd known it was a risk bringing Natasha back, leaving her alive. A big risk. Nat was dangerous, no one could deny that. That was why SHIELD had earmarked  her for death in the first place. Clint had always assumed the reason he'd gotten off with just a warning was that they'd convinced Nat to joint them. "Thank you. For keeping me. And standing up for me."
The question startled him, and Coulson realized he hadn't really considered that aspect of things. What might happen in his own future hadn't been of nearly as much importance as what the information might mean for his team. He blinked and tried to think but found himself struck by the look of concern on Clint's face. It made him feel like blushing and stammering, and Phil Coulson was not a man who did either of those things on a regular basis. "I hope not," he answered honestly after a moment to collect himself. "To be honest, I don't know. I don't know why I'm here. Like I said the other day, though, I know... I know it isn't normal."
"Tony," Bruce chimed in, voice forceful but gentle, "you and I both know that that gun isn't going to hold together for a couple of days, and I don't think the Council's gonna let Fury have another one. If there are any others anymore. This is our option. It’s a shit option, but it’s our option."
"Great," Steve answered, groaning and then kissing Tony's lips gently. "Fine. I'll go." It was the right thing to do even if he didn't particularly want to leave Tony's side. "You've gotta promise me you'll be good while you wait for me. I want to take you back to our room as soon as possible, and I just... I just want you better." He kissed Tony again, lingering until his sense of duty told him to get up and get moving. "Behave."
Bruce shook his head, fighting to hide his smirk. "None."
Phil gritted his teeth. He wanted more than anything to lash out. He didn't let himself. It wouldn't work out well for him, and it probably would've worked out even more poorly for Clint given the fact that Victor's attention was fixed so firmly on him. Instead of screaming or throwing himself at Creed and hoping to buy Clint a few seconds, he repeated, "Look at me, Clint. Please, look at me." If he could have promised anything to get Clint free, he would have in that moment. Torture had never been particularly effective against him. Pain, he could endure. Seeing Clint terrified and helpless was something else. "You're going to be okay. I promise that you are going to be okay."
Clearly pissed, Sabretooth yanked the arrow from his eye - dragging a respectable amount of soft tissue with it - and managed to squirm out from under the Hulk's foot. The green monstrosity swiped at him, but he nimbly avoided the attack. Glowering at Steve with his good eye, he scooped up Mystique's limp form. He smirked, baring sharp fangs. "Just gettin' started, boyscout. Wait 'til you see what Loki's got planned..."
"Sounds good to me," Logan readily agreed. It sounded extremely reassuring, actually, having someone nearby that he felt any kind of connection with. "Guess I'll haveta go shoppin' for somethin' to wear. Not sure how many more washes my stuff can take," he remarked as Steve let him into his room. It was a pretty nice place, a lot more plush than Logan was used to, though that didn't say much. A metal cot and a wall locker would have felt more familiar, but Logan wasn't going to gripe about having a real mattress to sleep on again.
"Hey, ugly! Care to dance?" Steve snapped at the man still trying to open Iron Man like a can of soup. The shield flew again, but Steve followed close on its heels, grabbing the metal disc and then plowing it and his own not inconsiderable bodyweight into the attacker.
Tony smiled at the sleepy words, holding Steve tight as he drifted off. Tony struggled to stay awake as long as he could just to savor the feeling of his lover pressed close to him. He didn't last long, though, with Steve's soothing presence weighing against him, and he was out before he knew it.
Clint tensed at the mention of Loki. "You knew, then, huh?" Getting a nod from Phil, the archer let his head fall against the man's shoulder. Of course Phil had known. Clint was his asset. Phil probably knew more about Clint than the archer himself did. "Loki left his mark on us both," he said, his hand sliding over Phil's chest, fingers bumping over the ridge of his lover's scar as he looked up to meet Phil's gaze. "I guess there are some things we just can't save each other from." It had hurt in ways he couldn't articulate when they'd lost his handler, and suddenly Clint understood Phil's perspective on their current situation that much better.
"As long as you're there," Clint decided. He felt a little pathetic being so clingy, but he didn't want to let Phil out of his sight. He wasn't sure if it was protectiveness or insecurity, but he wasn't in the mood to figure it out at the moment. The confirmation that Tony was dead made him feel even less inclined to leave his handler's side. It hurt. While he was by no means Stark's biggest fan, he knew how it had to have affected Steve. And it hurt on a more personal level, too, knowing they'd lost a teammate. The fact that Steve would be getting back to normal and that Nat was off kicking some Asgardian butt was small consolation. With a heavy sigh, Clint shoved himself out of the bed and went to clean himself up a bit in the bathroom before locating some of his street clothes that he'd left in a pile in the corner. Once dressed, he located his gray hoodie and tugged it on over everything else. It was reassuring somehow being so thoroughly covered.
Loki cast about, trying to think of something, and finally looking up at Clint and Coulson with a flicker of something in his eyes. "Stark mentioned that you don't remember how it is that you're alive, Agent Coulson." He waited until the man nodded tightly and didn't miss the glare that Coulson sent Tony's way. "I cannot change the fact that I was responsible for your death, but I can give you back the memory of what happened. I can open that door for you." It would be easy, really, if he had the permission to do so. If Coulson would let him in, it was a simple task and something he could give as a show of good faith.
Tony was already looking at the two younger scientists. "Dumb and Dumber, I need you to get over your Harvard diplomas, or whatever it is, and dig up the arc reactor specs and find a way to hook it up to - "
Logan pressed his lips to Scott's throat, his hand cupping the man's face as he nuzzled his cheek. "All I could think o' was what they'd do to you if they decided you were too dangerous," he said. "S'why I had to tell you I loved you through Steve. Wasn't sure I'd get to tell you in person," he admitted softly, brushing his lips softly to Scott's.
Logan raised an amused eyebrow. "I think I like that idea," he said, his voice dropping a notch as he leaned in the nip at the side of Scott's throat. Logan had few qualms about PDA, but he figured Scott would draw the line before he ever would. Letting the other man set the pace seemed like the best approach. "Definitely have no qualms about stickin' my tongue your throat in the park."
Steve flushed as he almost always did when Tony tossed out such casual compliments. Steve knew that the man did it just to get a rise out of him - or at least assumed he did. The truth was that they couldn't work together romantically. They were too different. They only barely made sense as friends. Steve tried to keep the conflicting feelings of relief and guilt and worry off his face as he said sincerely, "I'm sorry, Tony." He was. Mostly. Part of him rejoiced at the thought that Tony was free, but most of him just felt bad that Tony and Pepper might be calling it quits when they'd seemed to make one another so happy. Still he let his face soften into a smile. "But, hey, you've still got me."
Bucky gave a small grimace at the mention of Tony Stark's name. Although he remained in the dark over exactly what his attack on the billionaire had entailed, Bucky wasn't keen on asking Stark for a favor. He feared there would always be bad blood between them. "I think I'll just stick with this, then," Bucky decided. He glanced distastefully at the metal arm. "This is going to sound crazy," he confided in Agent Coulson, "but I wondered if maybe this," he lifted the replaced limb, “was causing me to black out and attack people."
"I called him," Scott answered with a roll of his eyes. "I didn't ever exactly have to do the tenure track at Xavier's." It was an easy lie to sell simply because it was, in part, true. Proving himself to SHIELD was strange when he'd been so used to being accepted outright at the school. "I was kind of hoping to skip a grade or two."
Steve let out an entirely undignified sound and buried his face against Tony's neck. Touching him, holding him even with their clothing in the way and knowing he smelled like the inside of a gym bag, was perfection. The tears came, and he squeezed his eyes shut to ignore everything but the way it felt. "Love you. Tony, I love you so much." There were a million other things to say and ask and know, but none of them mattered until they could be alone.
Nat looked more wary than relieved at their presence. "I'm not sure if I'm in for a reprieve or an execution at the moment, gentlemen."
Coulson's eyebrows raised. "That... is unexpected." And yet somehow it made sense considering it was Natasha they were talking about. If anyone could manage the feat, it was her. As they made their way back into the main room, he couldn't resist venturing, "You don't... I mean, if you wanted to-" He cut himself off. Clint had made it very clear that he wasn't interested in going home with him. He'd wanted to go home with Natasha. "Nevermind. Let's grab a cab."
"Well, she managed to outwit him once before," Tony pointed out, trying to reassure Steve. He could read the doubt in the man's eyes as easily as if Steve had hung a sign around his neck. Something he'd read in Logan's file made Tony frown. The drugs made it a little hard to be sure of the detail that was bugging him, but one thing stood out to him, "Why do you think Loki would release one and not the other? Or even release Logan at all? He doesn't do things just to be nice. Logan hasn't stabbed anyone in the face since he got back, has he?"
"Huh uh," Phil protested, still sounding dull but sure all the same. "Couch. It's still made up." He gestured vaguely in the right direction before leading Clint over and patting the back of it. He managed a sleepy smile. "But you have to make coffee in the morning. Sleep. I'm gonna sleep. If you... y'know, if you have anymore bad dreams?" Still somewhat out of it, Phil pointed toward his room through the doorway. He stumbled back in that general direction a few moments later, sure that if Clint needed him, he'd be woken when that moment came.
Fury watched Clint for a moment, then raised an eyebrow. "Barton...?"
"I like it too." It was why he was terrified not only of the idea of Tony charging into battle but the idea of Tony charging off into battle without him. It wasn't a lack of faith in Tony's skill or his bravery or anything else. Steve knew firsthand that he'd do anything and everything to protect people. No matter how often he protested the title, Tony Stark was a hero through and through. Steve just wanted to be there. He wanted to be close. If something went wrong or god forbid Tony actually used the damn gun, Steve wanted to be right beside his lover. He wanted to be strong enough to take that burden on himself so that Tony didn't have to. "Maybe I'll try to come down more often when you're working on your suits. It's nice having some quiet time to sketch. Better when it's with you," Steve agreed, sealing the words with a lingering kiss that tasted of bittersweet grape.
Thor's brow furrowed. "Hammer? What hammer do you speak of?"
"You do, too," Tony answered softly, amazed by how close the contact felt, how emotionally intimate it was. "Love you," he murmured, the words punctuated with a soft moan. Pushing a little deeper, he angled his hips, searching for that perfect spot inside his lover. He wanted to make Steve see stars.
Steve ducked his head, smiling back and reaching for Tony's hand to give it a squeeze. "I can't help it. I like making you smile." Being with Tony felt better than he'd ever thought anything would again after his return from the ice. Coming back into the world had hurt like hell. He hadn't planned to say more, but sitting in bed sharing breakfast with Tony, the quiet, sweet moment between them... "I love you." Though he felt a flash of panic once the words were out, Steve didn't regret saying them. Quietly, he added, "I didn't plan that one. Sorry. I don't... I'm not looking for a reaction here. Just wanted to say it."
Clint glanced at the pills, then to Phil, then after the nurse. "What the hell else am I gonna do?" he wondered aloud, then shoved himself off the stretcher. He raised his eyebrow at Phil. "I take it you're alright, too?"
Coulson didn't much like that thought either. Maybe Steve could withstand it. Maybe he could wield the weapon without losing any life force or going crazy - he probably had a better chance with both options than any of the rest of them had - but maybe he couldn't. "Have you told Captain Rogers?"
"Scott's down the hall," Steve offered, wishing like hell that he could let the two of them be close enough to speak to one another at least but knowing at the same time it was a terrible idea until everything settled. "He seems to be manifesting some of the same issues you did. Clint brought him in." The rest could wait until later. Scott and Logan would need to talk about it themselves. "I'm gonna go see him next. Nat seems coherent, but she's obviously still hurting. We're working on a way to fix it. By we, I mean Bruce and Tony and some SHIELD folks." He smiled faintly and leaned against the door. "The only help I offered was trying to keep Tony from pulling his stitches while they were doing science."
"I... I don't... it..." Steve sank down onto a stool and managed an amused snort. "Leave it to Tony to still be able to surprise me even..."
Meanwhile, Clint untied Darien's arms, then unceremoniously shoved Jason away. Before Jason could protest, Clint gave him a cold stare. "You know what to do." While Jason silently climbed under the table, kneeling in front of Darien, Clint positioned himself where Jason had stood. Wordlessly penetrated Darien's well-used ass while Jason wrapped his lips around Darien's cock.
At the sound of Tony's voice, Steve roused himself from a light nap. He rose from the bed with a smile and made his way into the living room with a smile on his face. "Hey, stranger. Sorry, kinda drifted off for awhile." He'd forgotten how intensely exhausting it was having a body that couldn't handle doing everything he really wanted to do. Catching the worry on Tony's face, Steve gave a shake of his head and moved in closer. "I'm fine. Just tired. Less tired now that I got some sleep. How about you? Need something to eat? I slept instead of eating dinner, so I could make us something."
Loki remained pointedly quiet, for once waiting until he was addressed to speak. Faced with the reality of trying to explain anything he'd done, he felt sick with sudden fear. He could envision no way for Fury and the others to ever accept his hope of becoming their ally instead of their adversary. It was madness to think otherwise.// And perhaps I am as mad as they say…//
Maria Hill's voice came through sharp and certain, "Who the hell-"
Tony drained his wine glass and put it on the table, never one to waste alcohol. "Well, that's no big deal; meetings are boring as hell, anyway." He leaned into Steve's touch and then ran a hand down the man's chest. "But that is fair, I guess. You naked on my workbench might stop me from doing the things that I suppose I technically should be doing. Not to mention you might get a literal screwdriver somewhere it doesn't belong."
Darien shifted uncomfortably in his seat. He'd always believed that when scary people got scared, it was time to bolt. Watching Clint submit so easily to the woman made him wonder exactly how many men she'd killed with her scary mind powers. On the other hand, watching Clint submit was also kind of hot.
"Should I call Bruce? He's kind of a doctor." Tony laughed at the poisonous glare he got and ruffled Steve's already mussed, sweat-damp hair. "Well, if you think there's any chance of recovery, I feel like I let you down. I'll have to fuck you harder next time," he decided, propping himself up on one elbow to look at the blonde. "I mean, I'd hate you to feel like you didn't get everything you signed up for."
"Fine!" J gestured, and the suit-man and his toy were removed from the room. "You pay me five hundred for look."
Clint was going to ask what the problem was, but Fury was already gone. He glanced at the monitor Fury had been staring at and felt the blood drain from his face. It was a list of SHIELD operatives from World War II. Sandwiched between a "Creed" and a "Keating" was the name James Howlett and a picture of a man who looked exactly like Logan. "Uh... that's... probably bad."
"It'll be great for the Avengers. Especially me," Tony declared, giving Steve a quick glance.
Steve had gratefully let Coulson take point on updating Fury while he followed Tony down to medical. Being a leader meant sacrifices, but he needed to know that Tony really was fine and that no important organs were punctured, that too much blood hadn't been lost. He hovered like a mother hen waiting for the doctors to give his lover a proper once over.
Victor caught the subtle shift in Barton's line if sight as the man worked out a strategy. The feral mutant smirked as he took a deep breath, scenting the two before him. "Well, you two are close," he said, "in more ways than one." He barely winced as another arrow lodged in his chest, instead leveling a glare at Clint. "Guess that means that if I get one, I get both."
Loki bared his teeth but still gestured, a sharp jerk of his fingers, and the chains fell to the floor, leaving Tony as free as he was going to be for the foreseeable future. "Perhaps I take after my father after all, Mr. Stark," he answered in a tone that was positively chilly. Realizing there was little reason to hide anything but the most secretive of details from the man, Loki sat down in an armchair that one of the mutants had found somewhere. It was ratty looking but surprisingly comfortable. "I believe that your weapon has affected me after all, though not in the way that you hoped. Perhaps you did kill a part of me."
Tony rolled his eyes. "It's not sorcery, you big idiot. First? Doesn't exist. Second? You're a dick. Third? He was actually kind of hoping to join the team."
Natasha let some of the tension roll from her shoulders. The thought of Clint putting himself in the line of fire again didn't sit well with her, but any of them sitting a round out was even worse. Better to drive forward and do everything they could as a team. "So when do we roll?"
"I'm not sure I'd let him hear you say that," Scott answered with a smirk as he took the beer. "He looks sharp enough to put you through a wall even if he couldn't compose an essay about it afterward. There are, frankly, times when I wonder if in our particular line of work it's not better to be a little dumb." //If you were too dim to have any idea what you were doing meant and how screwed you were in the long run, it had to be a lot more inspirational.// Scott had always gotten himself into trouble over-thinking. "Then again," he lifted the beer, "this is the great equalizer."
Coulson remained at the man’s bedside while he slept off the drugs. He hoped that whatever Steve and Tony were talking about took awhile. For one thing Tony needed the company, for another he didn’t want to worry Steve before they knew anything at all.
Bucky visibly deflated. Just when he and Steve were talking - really talking - for the first time, they were interrupted as if on cue. “Yeah, okay,” he begrudgingly agreed. “I could probably use a little more shut-eye.” He sank down further into the bed, threading his fingers together and pillowing the back of his head. Glancing at Steve, he flashed an uncharacteristically bashful grin. “You’ll think about what I said, won’t you?” asked Bucky with a hint of hope. Now that it was out in the open, he wasn’t going to let it go,  and he didn’t want Steve to think all he was doing was joking around. Steve might end up shooting him down, but Bucky’s near-death experience - his last solid memory - had made him more fearless about taking chances.
"No problem," Tony replied airily. He squeezed both of Steve's shoulders as he straightened again, behaving as if the sexual tension in the room wasn't stifling. "Like I said, you'll get the hang of it in no time." Tony smiled, adding, "It can become a little addictive at first, but, no worries, I'm always here to stage an intervention."  Helping Steve meant a lot less teasing on Tony's part, but he couldn't help feeling a sense of pride knowing he would be such a big part of Steve's new life.
The words sent a shock of nervous energy through Steve. He loved hearing them and felt ill-at-ease all at the same time. They’d walked a strange line between flirtation and friendship since Bucky made his confession, and Steve felt guilty about even that. The only problem was assigning the guilt properly. He hated the idea that he was letting Tony down somehow or leaving the man behind. He hated equally the thought of betraying the man who’d been his best friend since childhood. It wasn’t in Steve’s nature to spend a lot of time complaining, but he realized as he met Bucky’s gaze that it wasn’t complaining to have an honest talk about it all. “I know that. Being here and having you safe and alive is more than I ever hoped for.” Even Steve heard the “but” at the end of the words and fought to keep from wincing. “Right now, I need my best friend, and… that’s all.”
"Right," Bruce muttered, letting adrenaline, fear, anxiety, and rage that he usually kept back boil over. The Hulk roared a challenge at the gathered enemies, thumping his chest with one massive fist and grinning with an eager glint in his eye.
In the privacy of his own chambers, Loki dropped the glamour that was his battle armor. Wearing the real thing was pointless when he was doing little more than making a show for the inmates. His robes weren't much less elaborate but at least looked less likely to put someone's eye out. "I do that kind of thing." Admittedly being in captivity in Asgard had been less than conductive to having any sort of fun, nor had working with the Chitauri. "Unlike our friend in the cells, I rather prefer someone willing to be on top... and capable of living up to their billing. I look forward to seeing whether you do."
"Okay, then, maybe... Plan B is me getting dead. Probably," Tony admitted simply, able to practically feel Bruce cringe next to him. "But! The plan is that Bruce bashes Mr. Evil against the pavement a few times before Logan even tries to shoot at him. It's practically fool-proof. Plan B isn’t a plan we’re really looking to, uh, use. Probably. Hopefully."
Steve felt a rush of heat at the touch. As if it wasn't intimate enough kissing Tony after fantasizing about doing just that, now he also had a gorgeous guy feeling him up while he did it. Though the kiss remained oddly gentle despite its eagerness, Steve could feel the edge of control sliding through his fingers. There was no way he would be able to keep himself entirely in check - thankfully, at least one of his partners wasn't easy to bruise. With that in mind, Steve tore his mouth away from Tony's and turned his head to capture Logan's mouth with his own. He kissed the man with a desperate hunger that brought back memories of quick, messy trysts in too-narrow bunks.
Steve had to remind himself to catch his breath. It was important to keep breathing. He drew the air in and then out again as he savored the sensation of Tony's lips on his skin. "Love you so much." He wanted absolutely nothing more than to stay in Tony's arms for the foreseeable future, but at least they had a night. They had some time for one another. Enough time that Tony apparently felt it was fine to tease. Steve couldn't help smiling despite that fact. "You're a tease, Stark. A horrible tease."
"The nanobots are coming along," Fitz proclaimed proudly. He sent his results to Tony's screen and looked unreasonably proud of the work. "I don't know how far they'll go yet in terms of repairs, but they're enough to keep you in a fight longer than you should be able to stay in one." The gun was a larger issue than general battle damage, and they all knew it, but already the nanobots were enough that they would give Tony more of an edge than he'd ever have with just the suit.
She smiled again and gave Clint a little wave as the pair of them headed out. It was a conversation that could wait until later, a thought that she let percolate in the back of her burning mind. It could wait.
"It's probably his fault." She smiled slowly, "Though I may have consulted on one or two of the designs." Natasha grabbed another handful of popcorn and let herself enjoy the relaxation of the moment. It wasn't time for the heavier conversations they needed to have. Judging by the way Clint had held onto her like she was the most precious thing in the world when they met up, those conversations needed to happen soon. Clint meant far too much to her to hurt him through negligence, especially when she was ignoring things on purpose. It was easier to ignore them. If she could make sure he was taken care of, was with someone who could give him what he needed... well, that would change things quite a bit. It might even keep Clint from breaking. "You two should do that more often. Coulson doesn't leave his office enough."
Fitz rolled his eyes. "Jemma?"
Bruce felt no less tense, and he positively wanted to disappear when Thor stood, hammer in hand, upon seeing them. "How... Isn't that only supposed to work if he's worthy of it?" Bruce wanted to know.
Logan nodded. "I'll be there for ya, however you go about it," he promised. With a faint smile, he tugged Scott back under the water and started lathering the man up. "But as long as we're in here, we oughta get a little cleaner, hm?" It was really just a damn good excuse to run his hands all over his lover.
That was it, then. The weapon was of Asgard, and at heart, he was not. Somehow it was tearing away the mask he'd worn his whole life, or at least enough of it for Loki to feel uncomfortably exposed. "You may have done yourself a disservice. What I am beneath the face I have shown you all is even less pleasant." He said no more. Soon enough he suspected Stark would see clearly enough. At least he wouldn't be able to say much. He feared for the safety of his friends, and he should fear for it. They were in Creed's hands, and the man was a monster himself. Loki wondered if Thor had ever bothered to tell the Avengers the real story of his life and his parentage, if he'd been disavowed at once or if Thor had carried the burden of his teammates thinking their parentage was truly shared. "What did my brother tell you of me?"
