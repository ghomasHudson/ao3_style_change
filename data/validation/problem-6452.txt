“You’re such an idiot” Tony said, sounding fond and exasperated as he struggled out of his grip that had went lax in shock, just to wind his hands around Steve’s shoulder and cling. “Steve?”
He decided he was going to forget everything just for a while at Thor’s weekend party, he was just going to have fun and not think about Tony or his stupid boyfriend. Bucky had been trying to get him to drink his feelings away and Steve decided he was going to do just that.
To top off the worst day ever, he didn’t see Tony all day and didn’t even get texts from him, not even the weird cat memes that he loved to send at random times of the day.
He also got an earful from Pepper who complained about not being Tony’s personal assistant and to stop using her for interference. Steve had sheepishly apologized for both him and Tony and gave Pepper his latte, she had seemed placated when Steve hurriedly left for his classes.
He had also started paying close attention to the kind of people he find attractive. It was actually Sam’s advice, telling him to think about why he found those people attractive and not just because he wanted to draw them.
Loki just smirked at him and went back out, only to return a few minutes later with a bottle of something in his hand. He had a gleeful look on his face that Steve didn’t trust at all and eyed him warily as he set the bottle down in front of Steve.
And Steve just couldn’t take this anymore. He couldn’t sit here while all his closest friends talk about Tony and his new boyfriend and wheedle out all the sordid details from Pepper.
Only Janet looked sympathetic and Steve instantly liked the woman, he didn’t know her very well, she was Tony’s friend from another high socialite family and was a fashion designing major, Steve had always thought her clothes were very beautiful and he told her so.
Tony beamed at him and nodded clearly trusting his answer and Steve’s breath caught at the sheer luminescent force of his smile.
By Friday night Steve Rogers was eighty percent sure that he was into men as much as he was into women, he had been constantly thinking about it since his epiphany on Wednesday.
He was very much physically attracted to Tony, that much was clear and Steve suspected that he was possibly a little in love with his best friend after two weeks of agonizing over their relationship.
“It’s true you know, I can never stop drawing them. It’s so fas-fasci amazing and expressive” Steve stumbled over the words a little, it was getting pretty hard to find the right words he was looking for and Tony had put down his beer and was now blushing.
"It's completely nauseating" Loki said, suddenly appearing beside Steve and making him jump a little.
“I assure you Steven, it has nothing to do with generosity but curiosity, it’s a concoction of mead from New Asgard and some things I brewed myself. It will not poison you if that’s what you’re worried about, I have made Thor drink it and as you see the giant oaf is perfectly fine” Loki insisted.
Steve heaved a sigh, he rolled over the bed and took out his sketch book from his bedside drawer, maybe a little rough sketching will clear his mind.
“Tony-” Steve tried to placate, he didn’t understand why Tony was so angry but he needed him to calm down.
Today was supposed to be the best day, he had it all planned out and was finally going to tell Tony he wanted him to be his boyfriend. Actually, he had planned to tell him on Saturday but Tony had been busy and Steve couldn’t meet him on Sunday because he had an urgent assignment to submit on top of his weekend job.
He pushed himself off the floor and immediately turned towards Tony again, casually pulling him into a back hug (He'd wanted to do this since he saw Lehnsherr do it to Tony in the lab). He felt an immense pleasure at the feeling of rightness at having Tony in his arms like this. He fit so perfectly against him, he was the perfect size for Steve to rest his chin on Tony's head while he cuddled him from behind.
“If you had a tail, it would be wagging so hard right now”, a voice said from behind him and he jumped, almost dropping his lunch.
There were probably a few more that just appealed to him but those were the prominent ones that immediately came to his mind.
On Monday, Steve dragged himself to class even though he really wanted to roll into a blanket burrito and sleep the whole damn week away.
He yelled back at Bucky to shut the hell up and began quickly pulling off his shirt and putting on his sweatshirt instead, they were going to Benny’s to watch baseball and he did not want Bucky or Clint spilling pub drinks on his good shirt.
He was alone, lying on a couch and fully clothed, okay that was good news. He sighed, willing his body to work with him as he tried to sit up. He got very dizzy and stayed put while the urge to throw up his insides faded slowly, he finally spot the bottle of pills and water on the small coffee table and wanted to cry in relief.
He wanted to be drunk by the time Tony and Erik arrived, that way he would finally be numb from the pain of seeing them together every single time.
“Don’t go” Steve said firmly and he wanted to pout, Tony had been hanging out so much with other people that weren’t Steve and it was so unfair. Steve wanted their peaceful friendship back where Tony always
“Not because of you” Tony hurriedly add, “but I think a little bit of space would help me and will probably be healthy and better for our friendship” he said as if quoting from some book or someone else, probably his therapist or Pepper. She had been insisting on a healthy lifestyle and therapy for Tony after he had a breakdown last year.
And now it was lunch and Steve had planned to talk to Tony privately but that too seemed to be ruined.
At that Tony turned to look at him, probably assessing his face for any hint of lies. Steve swallowed nervously and continued.
He'd moaned imagining the wet suction of the person’s mouth and him clutching at the man’s unruly brown curls. Steve didn’t even know how it happened, one minute he was imagining a featureless man and the next Tony was the one kneeling between his legs, looking up at him with wide brown eyes and mouth stuffed full of Steve’s cock and Steve came, embarrassingly fast, harder than he had ever came in a while and he groaned quietly biting hard at his lips.
It had been a great feeling, getting it off his chest and Bucky had called him an idiot but crushed him with the fiercest hug afterwards.
Then there was Ben, also a theater student who was just so shiny and put together that Steve can’t help but admire and draw. There had also been Adam who was in the football team and refused to join in when his teammates bully people and often get into fights to defend someone, and Steve still being a bag of bones then had admired him so much that he put his admiration into sketches.
Out of their friends, Clint hated Thor’s brother the most, no one knew how it started but they were both insufferable when they were in the same room. Thor weakly defended his brother which prompted them to bicker about Loki with Tony chiming in every so often.
And he was surprised to find that thinking about making out with a random attractive man was as appealing as an attractive woman. But still, he wanted to be sure so he put those thoughts on the back burner for a while because it was taking up too much of his head space.
. But he was struggling to picture Tony with anyone he knew except the garbage excuse of a human being that was Tiberius Stone.
It felt as if someone had just put his heart through a shredder and he was still reeling from shock. He stood up abruptly, his chair screeching. He couldn’t meet any of his friends’ eyes, let alone Bucky, he didn’t want to see their pity if they’ve figured out his feelings for Tony.
Bucky made an indignant sound and wrenched Steve’s hand off his face, “Look at me, punk. I know you can be oblivious about things sometimes, God help me no one knows that better than I do. But that doesn’t make you fucking stupid. You’re one of the best fucking people I know and if Tony stark is enough of an idiot to pass you up then that’s on him. Don’t go bad mouthing my best friend like that, ya hear?”
Steve chuckled and ducked his head to nuzzle affectionately at Tony's nose. It didn't feel awkward to be this physically affectionate with him at all, it felt like they have been doing this all their life, natural and easy.
Everything was pleasant haze after that, Steve felt warmed, basking in his friend’s happiness and just drifted as they talked and played board games around him.
He caught the tail end of Clint’s question which was “..will totally do it, right Steve?” and everyone else including Tony were staring at him expectantly, Sam with a knowing look while Natasha seemed deadly amused.
Tony rarely ever talk about his family except to Pepper and Rhodey, both of whom had known him for much longer. But the little that he shared had always been with Steve.
Steve was a much better company in the evening compared to his fumbling conversations during lunch and he was enjoying hanging out with his rowdy bunch. They were getting progressively drunker and by default louder because Bucky and Clint were arguing about their teams again and Steve grinned fondly at the two idiots.
what keeping him glued to them?” Clint asked incredulously, “I thought it was Lehnsherr’s monster dick” he added unnecessarily.
Tony didn’t show up at lunch. No one acted weirdly about that, everyone just nodded and accepted Pepper’s explanation that Tony was meeting with Professor Yinsen about one of his AI projects and would be busy for a few days, probably.
privately about something” he gritted out with a strange emphasis on ‘boyfriend’. He pulled Lehnsherr up by the shirt, forcefully herding him towards the cafeteria exit.
“Thor was just telling us how Loki burned his shoes after he accidentally threw away the rare fungus Loki was growing for his experiment” Tony said excitedly as Steve set his lunch down and took his seat.
Steve stumbled, he didn’t know how long he had been running or how fast he pushed himself to run, his legs were starting to give out so he stumbled to a stop and sat down, panting and sweating.
His memories were jumbled, only because he was remembering specific things in no order whatsoever but the most prominent of them all was his interactions with Tony.
Loki watched him avidly, silently waiting for him to take a sip of the glorious smelling coffee and Steve took a cautious sip.
Steve drifted off with the calming tone of Tony droning on about what they were going to talk about, there was something very important with what Tony was saying and his mind was trying to grab on but it slipped away before he could, he fell into a dreamless sleep.
Steve glared at him, he wasn’t really angry with Loki. He had accepted the drink after all, knowing full well what Loki was capable of but he was still annoyed at the unbridled glee on his face at seeing Steve’s very unfortunate predicament.
It was the rare day when their class schedules coordinate and they get to hang out just the two of them.
Everyone looked to Tony who was now blushing. What the hell, why was he even blushing? Steve was suspicious now. Something was definitely up.
Peggy joined the army right out of high school and they still talk, sometimes they write to each other and she was still one of the most important people in Steve’s life.
“Oh Stevie” was all he said and sat down next to him without saying another word. They were there for a long time, Bucky a comforting presence on his side and he was so grateful for the silent comfort.
Tony gasped, looking speechless as Steve darted little looks at him. It was just too painful to fully look at him while he spilled his guts out like this.
Steve nodded as he pulled Tony closer. The mechanic could hear his heart beating fast and it made him even more angry with Burkwill. "You really want to go, don't you, Tony?"
The flight to New York was fast and uncomplicated. The small screens in the private plane showed the news. About everyone reported from the big press conference in the metropolis or even, at the less reputable channels, showed old videos of Tony.
"Tony, we need you, now. Now you must move out of this workshop and come along. We need you. We need the Iron Man."
Clint and Natasha stayed with Bucky at the plane while the others swarmed out in groups of two or three to search the area.
The few nurses who were currently in the huge building slept or were inattentive. Their eyes were on the devices, which constantly displayed the exact values of the condition of the sick. The Person moved silently across the floor, thinking of the plump woman in the entrance room, who now slept peacefully. She would only find out she was not paying close enough attention to her patient once the guard changed.
Rhodey gave him a strong hug and once again the younger felt safe. Even though the feeling was different than with Steve, he felt comfortable. Then he pushed away. "We should really continue."
Steve felt nothing. Not the sharp edge of the stone he was sitting on, he heard nothing of the fight, only marginally watching as Clint sprinted towards him, warding off the creatures' attacks.
Tony turned away from the others without awaiting an answer. He expected the others to hold him back to find solutions together, but he wanted to avoid that. He quickly ran to the elevator, looking straight ahead. But nobody said anything, the others let him go. Lost in their own thoughts and struggling with their own horror, the Avengers stayed in the room.
"Of course I’ll have to! The man knew everything about us! He has a damned spy with us and a very good one, too! Friday didn’t say anything, she works just fine! He kills agents because he wants to demonstrate his power. What if he decides to take more of you? Pepper is currently alone in China, without protection! He knows that! He knew where Wilson and the others were, he knew where Zemo was, he knows all of that!"
"Steve, you have to go, turn off the center. Otherwise there could be more aliens and the fight would start again. Come on, that's your job."
"Fine," Tony said. "Then we have three cities. And in one of them could be Zemo and the others. This doesn’t say anything about the exact whereabouts or whether we find the psychopath there. What's the plan you're all talking about here?"
Natasha went ahead and scanned the doorbell before pressing one of the names. Tony bobbed back and forth as far as his ribs would allow and was about to say something when a voice came through the speaker.
Tony rolled his eyes and his eyes darkened almost imperceptibly. "Of course. Then the charmer is at least something useful and doesn’t play protector again. I still want to go with you. Grandpa has little communication problems, sometimes."
She looked at the three again. "That's why I did not tell anyone, not even my now ex-wife, because I thought I was crazy. It had snowed again and on my way back all traces had disappeared under the snow. I thought I had imagined all this, but then I found this note there with those grunts. And then exactly the same things came to Toms River a few days ago. I was shocked, I sat there on the couch and could hardly look at it. I knew it was the same thing, so that's why I published it, the picture, I mean."
He looked at Tony again and pointed his thumb at his former team-mate. "He was a bit stubborn with his opinion and we had a little misunderstanding. Look to Stark, be so kind, Vision.”
At the same time, several bullets from the War Machine's armor and Tony's energy blasts shot at the tank. A loud explosion was to be heard and Rhodey and Tony were thrown backwards. "Shit", Rhodey shouted and Tony cursed as well.
"As long as the negotiations are not over, he shouldn’t leave the headquarters alone, that’s what I was told. It's easier to stay here."
She pointed to the photo. Her eyes focused on it, and it almost seemed like she was standing there again.
Dum-E woke him the next morning. Rhodey grunted unintelligibly beside him as the robotic arm of the robot stabbed into his side, but then straightened. It was just after seven in the morning but Tony felt a bit more rested when he got up. He made them both a coffee and at the urging of Rhodey, he also agreed to eat something small. He was not hungry, but he could not convince his friend otherwise.
"I know you didn’t want to do that," he rasped quietly, "but you did. And it doesn't matter what you say, you know that. Not, if you act differently." Tony fell silent. He didn’t want to do this, but Steve sat next to him and stared at him as if everything was alright. As if Tony didn’t know what he knew and as if he had never hit him with a shield when he was already down. He swallowed.
He would now go to the control room, turn off the ship's functions and hopefully prevent the now-dead brain from rebuilding and calling new ships and then he would be looking for Tony.
"And not only do you have to train," added the agent, whose name Steve still didn’t know, "but also become the team you once were. Differences must be discussed, but under no circumstances may there be new divisions. The world needs the Avengers the most now."
The accommodation was not small, but it was not intended for eight people. When the Avengers arrived after forty-five minutes of weary silence, they hustled up the creaking stairs of the old house, on the edge of a suburb of Boston.
"Let Pepper go, I'll come wherever I have to go," he added, but the man just laughed. "You’ll get the information soon enough. But for today it is enough. I still have to feed prisoners. Oh yeah, and Stark," he added. "I want you alone."
He pointed to the cell phone that was still on the table, but Steve nodded. "I travelled the world with him for three months."
"Agent McKinnes, your department starts searching for the source of the video immediately. Agent Malbour, you make sure none of that information leaves the room, Agent Kinsley, you must-"
He quickly turned his eyes to the ground. He felt his hands begin to sweat as Bucky's face appeared in his mind.
"Or at least her cell phone is there. And the GPS system in her earring. Safely held in the purse of an employee who is now sleeping in her former hotel room."
At the other end of the line he heard a sigh. In the background cars honked and street noise was clearly audible.
"We'll fly for another five minutes and then take another few minutes to get in front of the cameras. Nevertheless, you are already straightening your tie. Why would you do that if you are not restless?"
Tony's eyebrows rose. So, in New York. He nodded and stood up again. He threw one last look at Barnes, who now stared at Tony. When he saw that his eyes had turned to him again, he turned away.
Tonight, the therapy would start. The broken arm should be cured by a special procedure within several days so that Tony could use it again and at the latest then the suit should be finished again.
"So, we have a lot of information, but no real material to study," Steve explained, barely holding back the disappointment in his voice. "And,
Only slowly could his breathing calm down again. Tony put his head in his hands. How long had he slept? Three hours, maybe four? It was too little and his body yearned for rest. It hurt.
The second time he had talked to him was when he had brought them something to eat during the therapy sessions. He had been two days after he woke up, and Steve had been too worried that it would be too early, after three shots in the back, more than twelve surgeries and two times in which his heart did not beat in just three days. He'd asked Tony to bring something to eat because he did not want to leave Bucky because anything could still happen, and Tony had come.
This was way shorter than I expected it to be. I'll probably be uploading another chapter this week and then at the weekend again.
His lips were cracked, and the skin broke off due to sunburns. He was sweating and the smell was heavy in his nose.
The sight had been amazing. Steve lay asleep on the bed of the soldier, looking tired and weak at Tony, making an apologetic grimace. Bucky had repeatedly told him that he was sorry for everything he had done, but Tony could only return the apologies.
Clint could not really believe what the others were saying and quickly lowered the plane and turned the nose slightly. Now he saw it too: it was Steve carrying Tony over his shoulder.
"Did I spoil you?" The voice asked through the laptop, innocently. "I'm sorry, but you both knew it all the time anyway. I just want to help. You and your teammates who had to listen to you so often."
Tony could not argue. His throat dried up when he saw how much his friend had cared for him. He knew it was stupid to go alone, but he had no other choice. "If you had come, I would not be here anymore. Or she," he answered softly at some point. He did not want to imagine this scenario, but goose bumps ran down his spine as he thought about who else might be dead at the moment.
"Yes, yes. You get him, and then he fights for you and you all attack us. No. No, Stark, things are different now." Suddenly the man had calmed down again. Out of the mad laugh, a scheming smile had formed. "Do you think I'm that stupid?"
Steve took his chance and held his shield tighter as he took a step forward. The metal shield quickly hit the monster's neck. One last time it roared before it fell forward and died in a severely dislocated position.
He finally found the pills and quickly washed them down. It would take a few minutes before they worked, but Tony pushed himself up. He breathed briefly as his ribs began to throb strongly. Slowly he heaved himself up and stood on shaky feet. His left leg buckled and Tony almost fell down if it wasn’t for the wall on which he was able to support himself. He swore quietly to himself, but then managed to limp slowly to the bathroom.
When the music was completely silent, Steve addressed the mechanic. He was pale and swallowed. "Tony? Tony? Did you see something? Hey, watch out, we'll get- "
For a brief moment, the older man pretended not to have heard her but eventually sighed. She would not go away, and her eyes made him restless and unfocused. Sometimes, when two stubborn people met, one had to give in. He looked up in annoyance.
Vision picked up speed and flew toward the brain. But when he was only five yards away, he bounced off the air. He remained motionless.
Slowly a few of the shadows loosened and sipped on the bridge. Tony shuddered when he saw that two of the alien beings - the smaller ones - were accompanying the persons. He could see them poorly in the little light, but he saw that one of the people limped heavily. When they reached the middle of the bridge, they stopped and were pushed to the ground.
“I just need to make a portable device that we’d be able to use to safely navigate that quantum tunnel.” Tony continued as Steve kept holding him, “A sort of time travel GPS, if you will. Well, maybe.”
, could finish his sentence.  He looked over at Tony’s unconscious physical form, seemingly unaffected by what was going on. He then felt a weight at his back and a pressure around his middle, as if he were being hugged from behind. Steve instinctively brought his arms down around his stomach. It was a weird feeling, like touching a forcefield. He couldn’t exactly feel Tony’s arms, but something was blocking him from touching his stomach.
had squeezed his hand. He brought it back down and the pressure returned, followed by a tapping on the back of his hand. Steve fought the instinct to draw his hand back. After about a minute, he noticed there was a pattern to it, almost like- Morse code! Something was trying to communicate with him. He concentrated on the pattern.
“If you are who I think you are,” Steve said with a cautious optimism, “I’m afraid you’ll have to prove it. Tell me something only we would know.” He held out his hand and after a brief time the tapping returned.
“Tony?” Steve sat up and the pressure on his hand left. He thought maybe Tony had woken up and squeezed his hand. However, according to the monitors Tony was still out, and it didn’t look like he had moved at all. Steve brought his hand up and flexed his fingers. Something didn’t feel normal about this, though he couldn’t figure out why. He was sure
Tony paused mid-chew. “I did, didn’t I?” He said through a mouthful of pizza. He finished chewing before continuing. “Right. Open communication and all that. Okay, Steve, pay attention. It's story time...”
“I will. You’re gonna be whole again, don’t worry.” At that, there was now a weight at his front, and something wrapped around his shoulders. He felt a lingering touch on his lips. Steve tried to return the kiss as best he could, with the thought registering in the back of his mind how odd this would look if someone happened to walk in. When Tony broke it off, Steve felt Tony’s weight shake against him. That most likely meant one of two things.
Steve smirked. “I bet! I can’t even begin to imagine what that must feel like.” It was weird enough for him, talking to Tony's unseen entity and not quite knowing where to look.
While Clint wasn’t Steve’s first choice, it was either enlist his help or fend for himself. “If I had you order some pizza, could you tell Clint to collect it when it arrives and bring it here?”
Tony needn’t have worried about Steve trying to persuade him, he started second-guessing himself all on his own. It was late, and Steve had already gone to bed, while Tony elected to do the dishes before heading to bed himself. He was so caught up in his thoughts he lost control of the hand sprayer, sending water all over. Frustrated, he immediately shut everything off and sighed. Looking at the surrounding shelves, he noticed the framed picture of himself with Peter had gotten wet. Tony picked it up to dry it off, and as he looked at it, he remembered something the kid once told him about allowing the bad things to happen. Steve was right, he had to
Ok, so now what? He had a few options, all of which had the potential to wake Tony up. Seeing as how the man rarely got enough sleep as it was, Steve wanted to avoid that. He could suck it up and continue exactly as they were, risking having Tony wake up due to his increasingly growling stomach. He knew he could easily carry Tony to the communal kitchen, but the movement could wake him, plus it would be hard trying to get food with Tony in his arms. He could try to gently coax Tony off his lap and onto the couch, but that didn’t seem feasible either. The path of least resistance seemed to be to get JARVIS to get someone to bring food to him.
The other two nodded, but Friday spoke up. "Excuse me, but the press conference will start in less than forty-five minutes. The flight time to the building is about thirteen minutes, plus landing and takeoff nearly fifteen. If you want to look around and talk to your teammates before, you need to go now. Mr Barnes, Mr Fury and Miss Maximoff have already arrived at the building and are waiting for your encounter."
His eyes fell on Rhodey and Steve, and after a moment the smaller one turned away, staring at the agent. The agent wiped his hair from his forehead.
They had all seen the danger from their hiding place in the forest, just a few miles from Toms River, a small town in New Jersey. Since the fight against "Team Iron Man" they had to hide away; they had been searched by the government, and after Bucky had healed and thawed again, they had said goodbye to Wakanda and made their way back to the States to grow silent and unnoticed contact with Natasha in the hope that she might help to find a permanent solution.
Right next to the door and now behind Steve was another camera crew who kept their lenses focused on the newcomers. Four police officers were in the room and should probably provide the feeling of security. Steve felt watched.
"I can’t see them. I have to get closer," Tony said coolly to Burkwill. The man nodded and walked ahead, and the
stood behind him. The first's hand still jammed in his shoulder, stopping at least some blood leaking.
Wilson's voice sounded resigned and frustrated before continuing. "We were surprised by a storm and a cold snap and then attacked by unknown soldiers. All signals have gone down so far, Agent Anne Miller is badly injured, but we no longer have any medical aid packages. I repeat, we have no-" the sound broke off again and for a few seconds nothing was to be heard. The camera seemed to have stopped because the different tones of blacks no longer moved over the screen as they did before.
"Where have you been?" he shouted again, hoping Steve would just leave. But the man was right in front of him now.
The doctor blushed, but at the same time he narrowed his eyes in annoyance. "Excuse me, Mr. Stark. But I had to ask that because- "
"Thank you," Tony bit off the last bit of his apple and threw it in the bin. "Tell Friday, she'll tell me. I have to work now."
He could not believe it. His legs were about to give up and his hands were sweating heavily under the suit. His breathing was much too fast, so black spots formed in front of his eyes. The pain and guilt weighed down on his shoulders as he saw his own work standing in front of him.
"And I know that you feel guilty for everything happening right now, even if you're trying to downplay it. But this is not because of you, nor is it just about you. It's about human life! And too many have already been destroyed. You have signed the contract so that no more innocent people have to die and now think about yourself for a damn second!"
But still, it was not the time for it. His mouth was furry and his neck hurt so he cleared his throat.
The very unpleasant face of the creature had a black-brown tone, whereby the small brown eyes without recognizable pupils hardly stood out. The nose was more like a plate and reminded Tony of what he knew about the looks of Lord Voldemort from the Harry Potter movies.
Tony shook his head as he realized the extent of his negligence. They were practically at war, and he'd let Pepper go to China on her own and did not keep checking where she was. Only Friday could locate her, but she would have said something, if not -
"I know you're not sleeping, mate," Rhodey went on. Tony was still staring at the wooden wall across from him, but he could hear another person slipping against the hallway on the opposite side of the door. He could not understand what was said, just that someone said something to Steve, and Tony froze. He shook his head but said nothing more.
Steve turned his head so that he looked back at Fury. The man looked more tired than he did three months ago, and his voice was not as powerful as usual. Nevertheless, he kept his back straight, obviously trying to radiate strength and authority.
Tony did not even have to look for the numbers standing in the corner. Sixteenth of December 1991, of course, his friend recognized this date. And Natasha also seemed to understand. Vision told Wanda something and she held her hand over her mouth in alarm. Fury put his hands on the table. Not even Tony had told him about the video. At that moment, the car crashed into the tree and the inventor flinched. Steve's grip tightened slightly, but it did not hurt.
"What do you want?" Fury asked again. "Friday!" he turned to the AI this time. She still did not react.
"That's the nicest thing I've ever heard you say, Stark," Natasha replied. According to her grin, Friday had left no traces and she had just wanted to test it. At least his AI was still working, Tony thought grimly.
"A painting by a Norwegian child is almost identical to the creatures. The picture was uploaded three years ago by the boy's father. The child was nine years old then."
Although extra-large windows adorned the walls, the dark blinds made little light fall into the room, giving the man's appearance a dangerous look. Leaning in his chair, the fifty-eight-year-old was awaiting the report. The remaining three fingers on his left hand drummed the melody of Mozart's "Little Night Music" onto the cold leather of the black armchair. As James Burkwill waited for his mediator, his gaze swept through the circular room.
"Can I help you somehow, Tony?" Steve asked. Tony's lips drew up in a tormented laugh and he rolled his eyes.
A wave of relief came over him and he had to hold on briefly, to not thank some gods. His hands were still trembling as he tried to wipe some soot from a wound on the mechanic's head.
"Stark?" asked Fury and all eyes turned to him. Once again, Tony coughed, the cramping feeling barely vanishing from his throat.
"Oh, Helmut. That made everything easier," whispered the stranger's voice, chasing goosebumps over Tony's back. Barnes got up and obviously did not know where to go with himself. In the video, you could now see the motorcycle that was holding next to the car. The Winter Soldier was barely visible, but Tony knew that would change in the next few seconds. Then he heard the suppressed cry of an agent and Maximoff. They had recognized Barnes. Immediately, weapons were lifted from all directions in the room and aimed at the man who could only hold his hands in the air with his eyes wide open. His expression spoke volumes. The agony of seeing the video again.
"It's going to be hard, Cap," Falcon replied through the com, "in front of the entrance is a whole horde."
"I don't know why. It was stupid. It's going to put us in danger, but I'll take care of you, okay?" He whispered back. His throat felt thick, and swallowing was hard. He remembered that, as if out of reflex, he had thrown Friday's GPS system beside the tree as he climbed down. It was still off, but he had assumed that all five people got out. Pepper knew him well enough and would definitely search the area if she got out. She would be looking for a GPS system or a cell phone. He had hoped that the five would go to safety and then call for help. He had hoped that somehow it would all be alright, in the end.
"You shall bring them here, now!" Burkwill exclaimed in an exaggerated English manner. Still, the monster's paws pressed Tony to his knees, but he braced himself against it. The creature stank of old sweat and Tony could see the mucus flow out of the pores behind the ears. It covered the creature like a second skin and was slowly running down his armor as well, without being washed away by the rain.
An aeroplane, a smaller one, flew towards the ship at a breath-taking speed. It barely began to slow as it was above the battlefield and flew directly into their direction. "Guys?" Steve asked slowly, "What's that?"
"Look, even children live here," he said between breaths, trying to give his break a rational explanation. He just wanted to 'see' what was in the yard behind the house. The small floor was made entirely of concrete and there was an old metal swing with a wooden board hanging from two thin threads. Sand and two tricycles were scattered on the floor and Tony's eyes remained there. At least he wanted to rest.
"The object is slowly moving towards the metropolis, you can even see the explosions from down here, a few hundred yards below the plane. Just now we got the message that the fighters at the place are certainly the sought-after Steven Rogers, alias Captain America, who keeps the danger at bay with other Avengers, presumably Clinton Barton, James Barnes, Samuel Wilson and Wanda Maximoff. Whether the last of the searched-for Avengers, the as Ant-Man known newcomer Scott Lang fights on the plane, cannot be confirmed yet", the woman clenched her hair with one hand, as a particularly violent windstorm swept through the street. Helicopters flew up in the background, though there was still no danger to see in the camera.
"Hang on, Clint," Tony shouted, racing straight for the man. The other groaned in pain as he was pressed against the fast moving Iron Man armor, but Tony had no time to slow down. His suit slumped briefly and Clint pulled him closer, but still one of the creatures tore the archers foot down. "Fuck," he shouted.
"Instead, we even removed wasp nest from the cave you were in, Stark." Tony clawed his hands into the back of the sofa in front of him.
A message had been sent to Steve, and Tony quickly read it. There was a technical issue that was called due to a server overload. In retrospect, traces of foreign IPs were found, but still could not be assigned. Tony sighed as he read the further description of the problem. Then he handed the phone back.
Again he hurled the piece out of the cave, and so he did with all the parts he was able to reach. It took time, but when he finished throwing all the cables and components he was able to get out of the cave, he knew that people walking or flying outside could make out someone was nearby. If they looked closely enough.
? Tony picked up a piece of a broken armor and threw it to the ground. The hall of the metal echoed through the workshop.
"And that's the problem!" Tony said, feeling his arm tremble now. He realized how his strength left him, how he came closer and closer to collapse.
"There," came Rhodey's voice from the coms. "A big thing! It walks out of the ship. That might be the brain!"
"Who said anything about kids?" Tony exclaimed, laughing. "I have not even gotten used to be laying on the other side of the bed. We're still a long way from anything else."
The pressure from his shoulders subsided as the soldier took his hands away. In the little light, Tony could barely see what the other one was doing.
"We're still figuring out who it is. The woman hid her data very well, but we should have information soon. What we do know is that she is or was a big fan of Steve and that she probably lives in the United States. But the picture was painted on a trip to Europe. The woman must be between thirty and forty years old, probably has no children and lives alone. Not more."
Over time, the conversations became less and less. Tony and Steve had both talked briefly at first, just to make sure the other one was still there, but then they sank into their work. Both watched the video – which was fortunately recorded - several times and could not tell by any programs or observations where the man was and where the other agents were being held.
The older one looked around in the workshop. His eyes fell on the ugly, dead creature on the ground and he shook his head. "There was a city to defend. The suit should have endured even more. Everything was safe," he tried to reassure her.
Tony shook his head. "Only Pepper or I can prescribe that no way leads past it." He felt the panic rise in his mind again as he remembered when he'd last talked to Pepper. It had only been yesterday, probably in the evening, but they had only been on the phone for a short time because she had an important conversation to make, as she said.
Rogers waited for the monster to move toward him again. This time it tried to hit with both claws and already started to, but Steve stood still. It was not until the monster's big hands moved swiftly down that Steve turned away. The creature couldn’t react and only shouted as it touched the grey ground with its hands and leaned forward.
Shortly thereafter they had exchanged more information before Steve got back to work and Tony continued to work on his suit.
He would be a good mediator in a few years, James knew that. Because of his unwanted stay far away, he had learned to speak many languages and met some races that most simple-minded people could not even dream of.
Tony just wanted to hold on to Steve at the moment, but someone knocked on the door and the soldier sat upright. Tony reached for his hand.
His mother had heard him far too late and came to him, even reassured him, but Steve could only remember the fear and pain of his illness.
It wasn’t easy to walk with bruised ribs, Tony realized. Cursing, the man leaned against the wall to which he had stalked.
He waited barely a minute before ordering Friday to inform him when the others had left the building.
Friday was silent for a moment, then she answered again. "There are some pictures of the control room on the file, at least that's what the title says. But I cannot handle the encryption. Should I keep trying, or ask for access?"
The video opened and all agents moved a bit. Everybody had the idea of excluding places through time, that was nothing new.
Slowly he tried to turn his head. His whole body ached, he still felt the strong throb of his head; his ribs and right forearm ached, in addition to several other places. But he managed to turn his head. What he saw then made his eyes go wide.
The picture flashed on a huge flying object in the air, which looked almost like one of the helicarriers on which Tony got together with the Avengers for the first time.
"Glad to see you again, too" Tony replied dryly. A real smile replaced the fake one and he was relieved to see his best friend again.
"Friday, how long do we need?", he asked the AI. They were sitting in a new, but nevertheless large plane, it would take a long time and they had practically only this day and Friday, before the deadline would expire on Saturday. And who knew at what time.
He sighed. "But in the end, I still have to meet the guy on my own, otherwise it’ll be ugly for the agents."
Tony sucked in his breath and rubbed his hand thoughtfully over his mouth. Steve moved. "Thanks anyway for your information. We know now more than before. May we take the pictures with us?"
The soldier nodded absently and looked at the smaller one. "But Burkwill, too. He had not expected that. It's over."
Tony lowered his eyes. He remembered the attack on New York too well. He knew how scary and terrifying it could be. He could feel the cold in his chest himself, the goose bumps that had spread when he was alone in the vastness of the universe. When a nuclear bomb exploded in front of him, and he was sure that the light would be the last thing he would see in his life.
Tony could not help but sigh loudly. "So much work," he mumbled, looking at Steve. "Are you coming with me? Friday usually does not say that, if it's not important. I do not want to open Pandora's box alone."
"Your mind has already figured out where to go. All you have to do is reach out and grab the crucial clue with your hand."
Clint glanced at the floor in front of him and then took a quick glance at Wanda. "People died because of us, but much more were saved. There may be a connection with the emergence of heroes and villains, but we have only speeded up the process. All of this would have happened later, but we protected the citizens of New York, Washington, Sokovia, and all the other places. And we regret all the mistakes we've made because maybe we could have done better. But we are people who may be a bit different, but still people. We make mistakes but we do our best to protect the nations and that is why we should continue to do so. Because it's our job. Not the army, not the police, not the United Nations, no. It's our job and that's why we should continue to be used."
He remembered how the soldier and he watched Star Wars for a whole night, and how thrilled Tony was that the other loved it as much as he did.
By the time he left New York and soon after Toms River was faintly visible, Steve breathed nervously. The small town with the hundred thousand inhabitants shone only slightly in comparison to the metropolis behind him.
Abbie Lopez handed Tony a wavy note. The paper was already yellowing, and the writing was blurred by water in some places. Tony frowned.
You know that - you should've signed the agreement. You know what happens. Since Ultron, we’ve known what happens when we act by our selves. We shouldn’t have fought. You knew it." Tony stared at him. "For how long did you know?" he asked, not wanting to hear the answer. He stared at Steve who nodded slightly. "How were you able to be around me?" his voice broke a bit but Steve didn't seem to notice.
"Yes," he said. "He has. He’s transported the trigger for this attack from the ship and made sure that we could prevent bigger damage."
From his time in college, he knew the Public Garden very well. In the summer he had often written and studied there, sometimes with friends, or those who pretended to be friends.
Desperate, he lifted his left arm and tried to shovel the sand from his legs. But just as before, he could barely move his upper body and shovelling required forces he could no longer muster.
His hands moved quietly back to the man's head. The left hand rested on the larynx, the other wandered a little further up, right to the mouth.
Clint and Vision were placed next to Rhodey, followed by agents. Tony had seen some of them before, but many were new to him. He could call only a few of them by name. He quickly tried to focus on Fury. The man had hitherto given a brief welcome and summed up the reason why they gathered here. Tony tried to concentrate on it. Surprisingly, he felt a bit uncomfortable with so many different people in the room. His eyes fell on Barnes, who was still staring at the projection, then steered it on to Steve. The soldier looked at him as a tightness settled over his chest again. He felt his throat scratching and felt less air reaching his lungs. He coughed and tried to get rid of the feeling. Fury did not stop in his explanation, but Steve's eyes grew more inquiring as Tony once again put his hand over his mouth and coughed.
"Fantastic as always," he replied quickly. He just didn’t want to talk. He was putting the finishing touches on his new suit, and if he got distracted now, he could make big mistakes.
The three Avengers sat back. Tony and Steve sat side by side and Natasha sat down opposite them. Immediately the soldier looked out of the tinted windows as if he found it uncomfortable to sit next to Tony.
Steve remembered that the mechanic had told him in an eternally long lecture what the whole plane could do and how he had flown with it for the first time. Tony's eyes had blazed as he talked about the whole technique, even though he knew that Steve probably didn’t understand.
"Right, we were talking about the aliens. Your information about them is really bad. Maybe the six agents from Norway would know more. Too bad that contact with them is no longer intact. I’m actually sure they would know something more."
Meanwhile, Fury had said goodbye to the group, and Clint was closing the laptop when a loud sound pierced the living room. Everyone listened because they knew exactly what it meant.
Tony heard the blood rushing to his ears as the sentence hit him like a thump. His mouth was open and he could not move as tears began to gather in his eyes. He wanted to scream because he was such an emotional wreck, but he could do nothing. For the last few months, all the last
A woman with her black coloured hair turned her head so that her earrings jingled. "They still write about politics. Not about their lives. Not about the dead and obsequies. They don’t mourn correctly."
It felt like a second after which he was shaken up again. He sensed he was still in the suit but was completely disoriented. Friday had to have taken control because he just fell from the top down on the park, which was now in many places under fire. He scanned the park with his eyes, looking for the spot where Burkwill might be, or the
When Tony tried to turn his head in the other direction, he was overcome with such a pain that he went black again. He barely heard his own cry of pain, so quickly had unconsciousness overcome him again.
Beside his bed, where he lay, was Steve asleep, somehow managing not to fall off a small chair. So he was really here. Tony didn’t know how to feel.
Tony groaned in frustration. He could not believe that Burkwill had his eyes everywhere. He saw that Clint angrily looked at his comrades as if they were the reason the man knew everything again. Steve turned around as if to see if he could find a drone outside the window. But then it got worse, and Tony hung his head in agony.
Pepper still looked bad, but at least her wounds were now taken care of. Exhausted, she leaned against him and Tony pressed his head against hers.
With a booming skull, Tony slowly stood up. He had to wait a moment before the room stopped spinning. Slowly he sipped to the bathroom.
Bucky just didn’t seem to get tired next to him. The corpses of the dead beings were already piled up at his feet, and more and more were coming.
The long island was not wide, but it took several minutes to fight its way out of the dense forest and before he could see the beach. Steve ran a few meters over the fine sand, which looked completely deserted. He could see hundreds of yards to the left and right and saw nothing except the sand and behind him the forest that separated him from the road. The waves beat evenly and almost reassuringly against the beach and for a brief moment Steve just listened.
The desperation came up in the captain as he turned a little. No one among them could fly anymore, no one was able to get to the brain anymore. He tried to figure out if he could throw his shield far and fast enough, but even for him it would be impossible to throw so far with enough force.
"No, it’s just bones that will be reassembled within a few days, it’s nothing, Steve, you know? Of course, it was," Tony replied with an annoyed undertone before returning to his suit, which would soon be ready. Steve was silent and Tony did not care. At least the others would think that they had more to do with each other again. That was more than no development.
"Some agents also look around, but it is more logical with the weather that the six retreated into the tunnel system. You should have the coordinates now."
Tony was only marginally aware of the explosion. He felt more like the gravitation was reversing and suddenly he was under fire. He felt the pressure that made his eardrums quiver and he felt that he could not breathe when he was thrown against a tree with full force. For a moment he saw nothing, then he heard the beeping in his ear. The next moment he choked again and felt Friday open his helmet so that more air could flow into his lungs. The beeping was interspersed with shots and screams. And a roar that made him feel pure panic. Tony vomited before he could do something. He nodded weakly as his eyes blurred again and it turned black.
In the end, Burkwill sounded like a little kid. "Oh, just a second before I let your friends come. O
Steve looked at Vision in disbelief. "We have an important conference right now. Of course I'm a bit nervous," he confessed.
Lost in thought Steve stared out of the big window. He had thrown himself next to Natasha on the couch and tried to organize his thoughts. He was happy. Tony had woken up and even if he wanted to get away from Steve, that was kind of a start.
But Steve shook his head. Again tears came from his eyes. "He’s in surgery again. He was gone. Completely. Nobody's allowed in."
It wouldn’t bother him too much if someone found out that he had gotten out of bed against his promise, but at least he wanted to be able to work undisturbed.
"What is there to look for here? I'm sure you have something to do," Tony said, his voice trembling more than he wanted.
Natasha cleared her throat. "According to the Sokovia Agreement, the appearance of Steven Rogers, James Barnes, Wanda Maximoff, Samuel Wilson, Scott Lang, and Clinton Barton would be illegal, so they will be prosecuted by the United States of America to determine the gravity of the crime."
"Stark, would you please explain why it has to be Boston?", Fury's voice boomed from loudspeakers on the plane. Tony grabbed a pole so as not to fall over at the start, but everyone else was still looking at him.
There was a ... there stomped a thing out of the trees and grunted so loudly. It was certainly twice as big as me and suddenly stopped in the clearing! It grunted, but it seemed to say something. Some kind of slime or water or ... what do I know, dripping from the monster and I was so scared. See, I'll get goose bumps again! It had a note that the creature must have lost there, I found it the next day."
He suddenly remembered a lot of things they had experienced together. Nice, but also bad stuff. He saw Siberia for a moment, feeling the disappointment and anger again that Steve had brought him with his parents' video back then, the unbelievably bad feeling when he had to fight him again.
"Well, that worked," Tony rejoiced. "Friday? Would you be so good and close the door again? Oh yeah, play the New York press conference when it starts. And until then; music please!"
Tony scrambled to his feet, trying to look relaxed as his thoughts raced. Goosebumps spread over his body. His ankles were already white, so much did he reach into the back of the sofa. "I don’t have enough weapons for this. The plan will not work," he replied, but his voice was timid. He saw that Clint nodded affirmatively as if to make the situation better.
Through his cover, Tony could see Vision kneeling in front of the British, several weapons pointed at him and the stone in his head while Burkwill held a knife to his neck. "Come on, tell them why you're here," Burkwill told Vision.
Tony nodded without thinking again. That fight would cost him a lot of money again, but it was worth it. Again, his repulsors loaded and Rhodey flew around him to protect him from larger guns.
Steve and Bucky were sprinting out of the water behind a cover. "There," called the latter. "In the tank."
He froze again. He felt the blood run out of his face as he thought about the words again. With an open mouth he looked at the screen, on which the red thread was still barely to guess.
"And a coffee," he added after the little robot had left. "But only after that. And is there anything new from Lang, Wilson and the four agents?" Tony asked, disturbing the silence of the workshop. Only Dum-E’s humming was heard.
He caught a glimpse of an airplane that looked like one he had designed himself. Clearly, it had to be one of his aviators, after all, he had spent a lot of time and energy developing the best form of them, but it was gone so quickly that Tony was sure he had imagined it.
"If I hadn’t back then, I would certainly now, after I've already been told that twenty times during the last hour or so. Yes, I understand it. I did the right thing anyway."
Tony closed his eyes. His rough voice fainted across the room. "Apparently. How long have I been gone?"
"Boss, you were last here at two o'clock in the night, which was just over 3 hours and 30 minutes ago. The security settings make me remind you that more sleep might be healthier for you."
And he could not even remember a mail or a letter, he could not remember anything. It had passed him, as many other deaths probably did. And now he got his revenge. Somehow he could understand it, even if it hurt. Maybe it was the run he had to take, even though everything was levelling out right now.
"Abbie Lopez is her name. She is thirty-six years old, lives alone in her apartment. She has been single for more than a year. She's an artist herself, even studying in New York."
Groaning, he tried to sit up and look around, but his body didn’t obey him. He just tasted the blood that flowed slowly from somewhere into his mouth. The metallic taste made him choke.
Rhodey nodded and breathed in loud. His chest went fast and Steve could see that the man was struggling to stay in control. "You could have saved him, but no! Captain America wanted to play hide and seek!" he exclaimed.
"Why?" He shouted. "You had everything, Vision, everything! Do you even know into what danger you got everybody?"
"This is Virginia Potts, unfortunately, I'm not available at the moment, please try-", Tony pushed the call away as he slid down the door and finally lost the fight against the tears.
“Stop it," Natasha said then. "I know you find it terrible when someone shows something like friendship to you and you're not at least on an equal position, but can you just shut down your ego a bit now, please?"
Burkwill looked at a wristwatch, then the grin widened. "I did not give any of my employees something valuable. The smartest of them, Lady Elise, has an IQ nearly forty points below yours and even she is still predictable. The rest of my workers are even worse: Peter Krum, Kima, General Astif, you know. The whole range of criminals who put their hopes on me to kill you. Because you have wronged them; because their families died because of you. Because you're the monster you claim to fight."
He needed his Steve again, who used to take him in his arms, in which he felt these very special moments, where he realized how much he had been crushed on him. Of course, no one should know, and besides, he was more than disappointed with Steve and even more angry.
He had to see if Steve was okay and had sneaked into his room, just to sit on the bed and then be too tired to get up again. The next morning he was cuddled by the larger one, while the soldier had just smiled at him. The decision to move was then just made.
Vision had recovered and flew up. Steve could see that he was in pain. "A kind of shield. It seems to be a force field, I cannot get any closer. It must be because of the stone."
He stopped because the sound of the video went on again. "And medicine. We wait for you at a safe place nearby. Over."
It might not have been very smart to fly in the middle of the night, Steve had noticed, but since it was summer, the sun would have to start illuminating the area soon.
"The names of the criminals can be found in the appendix, as well as reasons why they all have to be imprisoned for life. It's dangerous to let them run around. In search of revenge, they would kill innocent people and they would not be better than you. They would be murderers if they are not already. They would be monsters, because they are incapable of being something else. They do not think ahead. Families would be torn apart because they would attack you on the street. Parents would die, children would die."
"His daughter and wife were killed in the same grenade attack as the six-year-old son," said Clint. "He joined the company a year later. He has not even been seen to attend therapy. His father died right between the death of his family and his joining to the company. He had inherited a considerable fortune from him. He bought shares and multiplied the money. Partially the media spoke of the miracle man. He rose so quickly into the ranks of the multiple millionaires."
Now it blinded Tony. His eyes were still sleepily and he groped disoriented on his bedside table. Judging by the noise, he had just dropped his watch. He winced. Groaning, he pressed his hand to his face and then fumbled for the tablets, which would hopefully make the morning a little more pleasant for him. His other arm laid useless on his stomach.
"Pepper, I have to go. The conference starts right away. I want to watch it. We'll talk again tomorrow, right?"
Steve had expected it. He closed his eyes and laid his head on his hands and exhaled loudly. "They aren’t looking right!", he finally said and pressed his hands on his eyes.
Tony closed his eyes again. Still, it was not a reason that one of his best friends had nearly killed him with the shield. Tony could not understand what he had done wrong, that Steve had attacked him that way.
Maybe Burkwill had looked up to this and even made a show of it, but Tony was sure he could not foresee such a fight. The Brit was still sitting in his tank, defying all attacks, probably even with the most up-to-date technology that Tony himself had developed for his next suit. He knew the man could have used his technology if he was able to get all those information, but the shield still could not last forever. But too long. They had to find the brain and then get Burkwill out of there.
He got up so suddenly that the chair fell backwards. He kicked his leg against the table, almost breaking the glass. Head down, Dum-E shoved some old Iron Man pieces of armor toward him before the robot left quickly. Tony stared at it.
"Nice to see you again," Natasha greeted, raising Steve's real shield and throwing it at him. Then she turned to the fighting.
Slowly he put the phone back in his seat, slowly turned away from the shelf and wandered to his desk. He needed the distraction.
Slowly he got up and started walking. He held his shield over his head as a sunscreen, his eyes fixed on the ground in front of him. He searched for traces of the missing. Steve saw sand. Just sand everywhere. The sunlight made the beach seem even brighter than it was anyway. The Captain squinted his eyes so he wasn’t blinded. Angrily he trudged on. It had to be a hint somewhere! Tony was not stupid, he must have done something to show where he was.
"Stark's AI did not let me through," the voice with the British accent continued. A picture rebuilt and two agents jumped and drew their weapons, ready to defend. "Quiet, calm," the Briton laughed. Only the mouth with a white well-groomed beard was visible. He was smiling and straight, white teeth were flashing. "I just want to have a say as well."
When he was down, he pulled the completely wet leaves from his arc reactor. Handerson's shoes slipped in his suit because of the water. He felt as if he had just climbed out of the pool, but then he began to move. He went a long way to walk a little longer to the bridge. Always eager to take big and slow steps, he eventually nourished himself in the place where hundreds and thousands of people would run again each day. Tony still had not put his helmet on. He wanted to show Burkwill that he was not afraid, even if it was not true.
Just when Bucky pulled him up by the arm, his senses slowly returned. The noises had stopped. Clint and Natasha hugged each other and looked up at the sky. Vision, Falcon, and Scott stared at the burning point in the air, which continued to spread in all directions and then to Steve.
"It's already there," the AI replied directly and Steve smiled. Even the computer, the being without human feelings, sounded relieved that Steve wanted to search for Tony. It
"So we go, turn against the only rule we’ve got and help the Cap and Rhodes?" Wanda sounded a little anxious, but not necessarily averse to the thought.
Tony squinted. What the person said did not make sense. He stared at the black screen with the red line and swallowed. The path already faded on the screen and neither of the men moved.
"You wanted to show me how to shoot with your bow," Bucky reminded Clint. He took the other one's arm. "Lang, do you want to come along? You also wanted to learn it, didn't you? Steve?" he asked.
The mouth went a little closer to the camera as if leaning forward. "Wilson, Smith, Lang, Dragenbach and Khatib are my gift to you, Stark. You must know, my son's birthday is in six days. Thirty is such a round number. There is not a single track in the number, not a single straight line. When my son last wished something, he was six. It's hard to make presents when you have not heard anything more from your child for so long. In twenty-four years, they change so much, too. But one thing remains the same for me. A dead child does not just want flowers, it also wants revenge."
Helmut Zemo was free again, cut off due to a technical problem. He ran his hand over his face. He briefly glanced at Steve, who looked just as frustrated. He stared at the phone with his eyebrows contracted, then sighed.
"I just wanted to protect you," he explained, but Tony waved. "There's time for that later." Tony saw a gaping wound on the neck of Vision and wondered how much the Android could endure.
Fury turned his gaze to Tony, who at first could only look at Barnes. He did not know why, but he nodded. "Ask him what you want. But we need him."
Steve could only guess how the man felt right now when his best friend ignored him and then sacrificed himself. He swallowed and turned his head away, to the ground beneath his feet. He clenched his jaw as hold his hands tight so they were already becoming white.
It was Tuesday, two weeks later, when Tony was staring at the phone in front of him. "I didn’t know that your wife could bake so well," he eventually brought out and looked at Clint. The archer grinned. "The eighth best thing of her!"
"He won’t let go," Clint cried in panic. He slipped on the wet armor of the Iron Man and Tony had to use both hands to hold the archer. Suddenly the alien let go and the two shot up, relieved with exhalation.
Thinking that he did not have a first-aid kit, he pinched his jaw muscles together. Why hadn’t he thought of that? Now he had to carry Tony untreated back to the plane. Frightened, he realized this would take several hours with the heavy man on his back. Steve could only hope that Tony would last so long. And he himself, too.
At that moment Clint entered the room and sat down on the couch as well. He greeted them with a nod and then held up a device from the infirmary that looked similar to Tony's cell phone.
"Obviously from Afghanistan, Iran or Iraq, Russia or other countries. I can’t get around the security code and open and read it. But I can see it says
How could that happen? Was it his fault that the once so joyous, often somewhat arrogant Tony Stark was now talking bad of himself?
Fury actually thought for a moment about that, then shook his head. "Not here. The camera crew there is filming every step and I don’t want to know how many bugs have accumulated in this room over the years that haven’t been removed yet. I also can’t promise you the given information was correct."
Wanda sat down on the outside and beside her Rhodey, who seemed somehow happy and at the same time worried. Clint and Natasha - both looking a little tired - were sitting next to them and Fury was sitting in the middle of the table with the Russian. On the other side, between Steve and Barnes was Vision, who seemed a little uncomfortable.
It was quiet for a moment. Then the AI responded with a "No, as far as I know, they are searching in the vicinity of the fighting area, so further north." Steve nodded and considered briefly.
So, yeah. That was all a little rushed. But I don't really feel the story anymore, you know? I'm just gonna finish this with the epilogue next weekend and then I'll forget about this, haha.
The plane had been parked without light in the pasture behind the house, surrounded by smaller and larger trees. The house, which was probably still from the early days of the United States, was inhabited only by an old man who had opened the door with narrowed eyes and had let them in in a rough voice. His humpbacked showed that he worked many years as a farmer, almost unusual for a suburb of Boston. The house stood at the end of a small path, separated from the road by several trees. But even without this privacy, nobody would be interested in the dilapidated building, Tony suggested. The neighbours would be as interested in the man as they were in the polls in Bulgaria.
. The brain was now surrounded by smaller aliens who seemed to protect him and Burkwill had also people and aliens surrounding him.
He couldn’t ban the sound of relief from his voice. Tony was glad that his friend was not angry because he had concealed the matter with Barnes.
He looked at the two with a stunned expression. Steve was a little closer now, his hand still clutching Tony's arm. The other Avengers also came closer, they needed to know what had happened. Tony could practically see the disappointment in Natasha's eyes, that he had never told her this. Rhodey's hand was sweating on Tony's shoulder.
The Avengers all nodded in agreement and looked at Clint. Tony was still trying to control the coughing fit. He needed to do something about the cold, even if he did not feel sick at all.
Thanks for all the kudos! I would be over the moon if I've got some comments! That would be super nice.
Fury moved his hand frantically, motioning some agents to locate the source of the signal. Tony was still typing on his phone, trying to save what he could save.
"So, Massachusetts, then," Barnes said quietly, whispering something to Steve. Tony was glad that he had showered in the morning, now that he was so unexpectedly back among with his people. He saw some of them for the first time in days. Wanda looked absent-minded and tired, and even under Barnes' eyes were dark rings. Steve had been with Tony the day before, or at least it could have been the day before. He did not know anymore. His appearance had not improved. He still looked tired when he got up and said in the round that he was going to change now. As a precaution, who knew what could happen.
Tony could only hope that people were searching in his area. If he remembered it correctly, the nearest beach at Toms River was not on the mainland, but rather on a long island a few miles away.
He felt Steve beside him, who also looked out of the window. The soldier did not seem strained from the few flights of stairs, and that annoyed Tony even more that it made him so tired.
"Gladly," he said anyway. It would do him good to get away from all the drastic changes. Friday sent a message to his screen.
"The fight was a little less than two days ago. Tony, I ... I'm sorry. I could’ve prevented all this. I mean - If I had fought the creature. I should have told you about what Bucky - what Barnes did. I didn't want you to feel betrayed. I think - I
The nausea came up in Tony, but Vision took a quick look at him. He tried to take a deep breath but almost choked on himself. Injured and disappointed, he stared at Vision.
"That's a lot," Wanda replied wide-eyed, but Barton shook his head. "Hardly something usable. We don’t know where he lives, where he is, what he is able to do. If he manages a company that makes weapons among other things, then he can have a large amount of it and surprise us."
"That you actually wanted him to stay down here. But if you just stay silent all the time, it doesn’t make the situation any better."
"Not much further south. There is a clearing, barely visible from above, but big enough for the plane. That's not far from Mr. Rhode's landing position."
"We've already figured that out," Clint interjected. "The most likely routes are being checked by agents."
"And he'll have to wait," Natasha interrupted. "Or do it on the Internet. There are possibilities. Let's see what the doctors say, Rhodey wants to meet him before we fly as well." Natasha looked at Steve from the side. "You talked?"
When Rhodey had asked about it once in a quiet moment, he just dodged the questions and blamed it on getting him so worked up that it was his fault that Rhodes could only go with help and also, so it slipped out, that he missed the presence of the others.
was that he should throw Stark away from him. He did that successfully. Stark had to survive with the new suit."
"It would be, if we hadn’t searched any further. If the camera does not distort more than a common one, we can make out the approximate height of the plane. The shadows indicate it flies to the southeast, and by then, about eight minutes past five, only New York, Baltimore, and Boston flights are likely to leave."
"Do you know these people?" Steve asked, who had meanwhile walked to stand just behind Tony. He shook his head. "Never seen them."
She nodded, trying to breathe a bit more calmly. Natasha peeked into the room and then asked Fury quietly what she had been interested in for some time.
"Only if they had the means," Tony said. "They had one injured and were possibly without food in this tunnel system. They were slow. With three days of runtime and a storm" - Friday had reported the weather of recent days near Trondheim - "they will not have come this far. Where exactly did the signal come from?"
He pulled his chair closer to the screen and tried to calm his breathing. It was quiet in the workshop, the noise was gone. By now, all the other agents and Avengers who were in the headquarters would be able to watch the video. At least inasmuch as they were in a room where Friday worked, Tony thought ruefully. They were all probably just waiting for a sound or an image,
Quite shallow, the intruder ran his hand over one of the many wounds on the man's upper body. He knew very well that the other's legs had not been injured dramatically, he would not have to search there. His job was to view and evaluate the wounds. They would hurt the man, but modern medicine would make it a miracle if they stayed for long. Most of it would heal soon and then The Figure would have more opportunities to act.
Steve handed Tony his cell phone and their hands touched, triggering Tony's familiar feeling. He could feel the tingling of heat that spread not only in his fingers, but then the soldier pulled his hand back and the feeling was gone as quickly as it had come.
"There’s something new," a new voice suddenly announced. Tony's expression froze when he recognized the Winter Soldier who was talking.
A bush rustled loudly behind him and Steve turned around attentively. Soldiers shouldn’t be here yet and animals barely made those noises. "Rhodes?" He called questioningly and waited.
It took scarcely ten minutes for the Avengers to gather the most necessary things and to go to the garage, as Tony had affectionately called it.
"Certainly," the reporter went on, "reigning Defense Secretary Ashton Baldwin Carter said that those Avengers should for now act freely and do everything in their power to avert the unknown danger. He also calls for the other Avengers, who are reportedly still at their headquarters near New York City, to come and help defeat the threat. At the moment, nobody knows what sort of creature we are dealing with here. A corpse is said to have fallen off the plane and still be recognizable due to a supernaturally stable skin. It should probably be an alien species. The local police, however, leaves no reporters to the corpse. The Special Operations Command is currently on the fastest route to Toms River, and security measures around the world are being strengthened at this historic moment. Angelina Miller from CNN, back to the studio."
It used to be easier, Tony noted, but finally pulled his hand away from the window just to press it against a small stone. He hardly dared to look down, because the house was quite high. It took him ten minutes before he found his way down safely. With a dull sound, he jumped on the grass. There was still light coming from the room of Steve and Barnes, but it was off in the living room. Quietly, Tony slipped into the pasture behind the house and opened the plane that still stood there with a short command. Without looking around, he jumped in and just wanted to tell Friday that he could put on the suit when a voice stopped him.
Steve turned back to the hologram and Natasha nodded to Tony to get closer. Paying attention to his attitude, he slowly walked over to the others and put on a smile.
"I went home then. You must know, I swore I would never drink alcohol because my dad ... He had a problem, died early, but before that he would always beat my
Loudly the sounds came from the many loudspeakers and let Tony at least briefly forget the whole situation. He pulled over a chair and sat down carefully. Interested, he bent over the creature and looked at it more closely.
"Mr Rogers and Mr Rhodes both took high-speed planes," Friday said as Bucky pushed the big door open.
Inwardly, James rolled his eyes. He would have liked to keep watching the reactions of the others, but instead, he just kept them in his memory. His blue eyes wandered through the hall. People of different nations and cultures looked at him. He raised his eyebrow. It could be so easy.
Tony's eyes widened, and he saw that the other Avengers and agents who did not know about it yet, sat up. He heard Rhodey mumble something besides him and felt that Steve had sucked in air. Fury enlarged the picture with two fingers.
"He ran amok. He just came out of some hiding place when we got you to the helicopter. Bucky is ... He's still in mortal danger. Zemo just shot randomly, he would have hit you if Buck had not been there. I ran after him."
He teamed up with a soldier he used to be friends with seventy years ago, who was a murderer, instead of just telling Tony? How could he still feel so much for the soldier?
"All of Stark's equipment is destroyed," Fury began, not even remotely remembering to approach the subject slowly. Steve liked it that way. "Neither SHIELD nor FRIDAY can detect or locate signals."
Rhodey stiffened slightly behind him and Steve gave him a questioning look. Then Tony straightened his shoulders. "Friday is turned off in here."
The sun blinded him directly as he stepped outside and the heat came towards him like a wall. After the air-conditioned plane, it was hard to walk in the hot summer afternoon. But Clint looked around and could immediately make out the group of four people who were off the plane. When he arrived, Bucky was helping Steve, whose face was flushed. Clint's gaze sought Tony. The mechanic lay on the ground behind Steve and was just checked for injuries by Natasha. His face looked terrible. The wounds on the stomach already hurt while watching.
But he did not get any further, because Tony interrupted his friend, who slowly got himself angry. "No, we couldn’t have done anything differently!"
The suit would have had to protect him better in such an explosion and especially had to absorb the fall differently. If he hadn’t stopped working on it abruptly, this mistake would have been noticed during the night and would be resolved the next day. With his hand pressed to the aching rib, Tony finally proped himself against the clean mirror in the elevator. His hand left a sweat stain as it slipped a little.
With a watchful eye, The Person stood next to the hospital bed and did not move an inch for ten minutes. The whole time Stark did nothing but to sleep, as if he was not at mortal danger.
"For the time being, however, the United Nations have announced that the Avengers can act as a self-sufficient team to protect nations, given that there is a presumption that the planned operation is directly related to the attack over Toms River."
"What do you want?", Natasha interrupted the unpleasant silence at that moment. Tony remembered that he had to tell Friday to give Natasha some presents for all the help. Steve still did not say anything, just looked at Tony.
that the other one was not like him. For fear he would go away. Or never come back - what had been the reason in recent months. And now, at the most inopportune moment, the other said something that Tony had otherwise only dreamed of. He shook his head in disbelief.
James lifted his remaining arm reassuringly. "Stark will get his revenge. But would the death of your wife really be avenged if Stark had had a quick death? Before he could fully understand that he would be getting shot, he would already be dead. It wouldn’t be fair. Stark has to feel more pain."
It was not until they had explained in detail when Tony had to take which pills, and after another blood test was done, that his bed was pushed through the hospital wing to the elevator and his room.
"Nothing new," said another voice Tony could identify as Barnes's, "but you need to rest. You didn’t sleep at all. It neither helps Tony nor you. You too, Rhodes. Vision is coming in and stays here, nothing will happen. Both go and rest!"
Showering turned out to be difficult; he managed to get away with a plastic bag from his closet around his arm and a small chair he took to the shower.
When Tony woke up, panic overcame him. His hands, his fingers, even his eyes didn’t obey. He knew that he had to lie somewhere, probably in a bed. But his body didn’t respond to his orders. The panic grew bigger and bigger. He tried to break free, but it felt like his nightmares: he couldn’t escape, he couldn’t get out. Desperately, he tried to scream for help, but nothing happened. Then he heard a noise. A door opened a few feet away. Tony listened attentively. There was a brief silence, and then a voice, right next to Tony, spoke quietly into the direction of the door.
Tony looked up and looked at the photo again. He still could not make out a familiar face and became increasingly restless.
"Thanks," Barnes suddenly murmured next to him, startling Tony. He looked at him, studying the tired eyes on his face, framed by the brown hair that had been haunting Tony for months in his dreams. Barnes smiled slightly, but it did not reach his eyes. Tony nodded without saying anything, but it was enough to answer. Barnes turned away the moment the door opened, and Fury, Clint and three agents stormed into the room.
Thoughtfully, the old man lifted his lips. "How did ya know he wouldn’t die?" he asked in his strong southern accent.
"But a damn important gift. Burkwill, you are a man of your words. You’ll release Lang and Dragenbach. Pepper won’t do you any good if she’s dead and I won’t do anything if you kill her."
"Let me help you," Steve said so softly that Tony could barely hear it. The words bounced off a wall of thoughts that the man could not yet arrange. "We’ll go through this together. We are always here for you. I'm here for you."
"Fuck," Tony and Steve muttered at the same time. Burkwill laughed and Tony looked at the soldier in front of him. Tony felt like his organs all just searched for a new place. He felt sick.
He glanced around while Nick Fury got up and projected a picture into the center of the room with a remote control. The table was full of agents and the Avengers that were in town. Rhodey was sitting right beside him, and on the narrow side of the table to Tony's right sat Natasha, whose eyes seemed not only to watch the image in the middle of the room but at the same time Tony. Fury's chair was the one in the middle of the narrow side and next to him sat Maria Hill. Opposite Tony sat Steve, who had changed since Tony saw him for the last time. He seemed more professional now. Barnes and Wanda Maximoff were sitting next to him, both looked spellbound at the picture in the middle of the room.
Lang and Dragenbach said nothing, the agent just nodded and Lang watched Tony closely. The mechanic had not forgotten what the younger man had said to him last time in that prison, but that did not interest him. It was important that his colleagues came out of here.
Still, Tony had to admit that the monster in the picture looked similar to the creature that lay a few floors below him in his workshop. With ink, the round belly had been painted with a brown colour, but the neck and hands were green and so was the face from which big horns grew. Still, the picture could simply be an unusual representation of the Shrek, a being from a well-known children's film. The outlines had been painted with a thick black brush and a sickle moon shone silver in the righthand corner of the picture. With a spiky handwriting, the boy had written "Malet av Bjarne",
"And Mrs. Potts is currently in China," Burkwill ended Tony's thoughts. "You wanted to say that, didn’t you?"
Tony had gone to the hospital floor, where only a few days ago he was lying in a coma. A strange feeling of tightness came over him and he grabbed his neck. He swallowed as his breathing became harder. He quickly closed his eyes to calm down. In his mind, he immediately thought of his workshop, which he now wanted to go back to. He looked around quickly. A green plant stood right next to the mirrored elevator. The light lit the wide corridor with a nice tone. It came straight from the walls and ceiling, there were no visible lamps. Tony remembered how fascinated Steve and Thor had been when they first saw those lights in the headquarters.
,” he explained further. He could not expect them to know this, they would have to open a book for that.
The stairwell was stuffy. Light came through the open door into the narrow corridor, letting the dust glow in the air. It smelled like old food and much older people. Tony wrinkled his nose.
Every form of amusement had slipped from Burkwill's eyes. He shouted something and several of the smaller aliens entered the bridge. Tony swallowed. That was many. Every few yards some aliens stood and stared at the lake. Burkwill had built a living wall within seconds of more than fifteen aliens.
The old man James had been watching before had still tears in his eyes. He looked at him with a trembling lip and a red face. "And why ain’t Stark dead? Ya promised he’d die! Revenge! Ya promised revenge! Instead, he fucking lives and ‘s considered ... celebrated a hero!"
The doors opened and the three Avengers went out into the hallway. Tony could not resist a small moan as his rib stabbed sharply. Steve looked worried but still did not say anything. Natasha looked at him but then walked away from them.
The white walls with the few black, yet fashionable aspects did not attract his attention after all this time. His eyes clung to the left edge of his big table. The three pictures of his children and his wife were in good hands in the golden frame. Jannik, his youngest son, five years old, grinned happily at the camera. In the background of the picture, one could even see Ellen, the nine-year-old daughter sitting on the swing. She had her own frame right next to it. As so often, James had caught her playing the oboe as he shot the photo. She smiled discreetly into the camera when she saw her father. And then there was the last picture. His wife, for so many years. The brown eyes both Ellen and Jannik must have inherited from her, shone with joy.
"Boston, then," he said without a greeting. "I'm surprised you got it so fast, I have to admit." Tony thought he heard some frustration in the psychopath's voice, but he could not properly classify it. "But now that you’re all here, we can start. It's getting boring very quickly on such an old floor."
With every passing day, Tony became more restless. He stood in his workshop or had the therapy done, working alone or in private company with Rhodey or sometimes Steve on his suit or those of the other Avengers.
Quietly he padded through the dark room into the bathroom. It barely took him five minutes to get ready and put on his suit.
, he thought bitterly and stiffened briefly as his stomach rebelled and he had to choke, causing a sharp pain to pass through his entire body.
"In addition, it will be checked for all of the Avengers to what extent they had violated their rights to intervene in the fight on the flying object."
"Excuse me, Miss?" a voice called from the audience. Natasha searched for the speaker. Barnes fumbled nervously at his shirt. "How can you talk about saving countries from catastrophes when every time you appeared so many people get injured or die?"
At last, he could see Bucky and Clint helping Rhodey into the helicopter. A wave of relief flooded Tony and again he nearly stumbled. With every yard he went, he felt a little weaker. His shoulder ached all the more, the harder Steve pressed onto it and he did not have to fool himself: tears left his eyes in pain. At least it's still raining, he thought to himself, but then they reached the helicopter and Wanda gave him a trembling hand, which he gratefully gripped. More hands grabbed him and pulled him under the armpits, but he could not assign them. His shoulder was released, only for someone to squeeze it again the next moment, and the pain chased him anew. He barely felt the syringe put in his arm.
Burkwill was a little smaller than Tony in his suit, but that did not stop him from getting closer and closer. Tony's jaw jumped together. He stared at the man who had stretched out his left arm and now put it on Tony's armor. He kept staring straight ahead. He was looking for Pepper and the others, but they could be any of those shadows. Or none.
The others had all followed and were able to provide good support, but exhaustion was noticeable in each of them.
Again, a pause set in, ghostly calm. Nobody in the room said a word. Pepper clawed her hands into Tony's arm as he tried to calm his breathing.
“Stark isn’t the leader," Fury answered shortly, looking at Steve. The soldier imagined seeing something like sadness in the eye. "And we all have to deal with losses."
"Nothing," he answered quickly. "But if you’re already here. How do you know that Stark Industries can still produce weapons? There are no more plans for weapons and normal ones will not help you with your rescue plan."
, he thought dryly, trying to remember if any person before him had to try to get out of a cave with just one arm.
Fury looked at Wanda. "If you're nervous, it's better to talk a bit too little rather than too much. We can’t afford any more missteps."
Tony raised his eyebrows. "You've got quite something there." He had heard of the hotel in Hong Kong but had never been there before. The photos he had seen were fabulous.
But he did not want to sleep at all, never again. The nightmares became worse, and even though he would never admit it, not even to Pepper, if that was going to stay so for a long time, the great Anthony Edward Stark would perish.
"I wanted to ask you what kind of pizza you wanted,” Steve finally said. “Bucky wanted to order some. We just didn’t know what you wanted anymore."
A red line slowly formed. A trace as if someone was painting with a pen. Slowly and delicately, the line swept up the black background before making a jerky swerve to the left, only to go straight back to its original lane. Tony shuddered when he realized it was a map.
He could nowhere see Burkwill but saw that both Steve and Bucky swam through the lake and were protected by Rhodey. Maybe they had seen something, Tony mused and flew to meet them. "Where?" He just shouted, assuming that the others understood what he meant.
Noise really didn’t bother Steve. He had been at war, it had always been loud. But the reporters shouted to him and his colleagues several questions that he couldn’t understand through the constant noise, so it just annoyed him. Luckily, they didn’t have much to go, because the plane could land just next to the City Hall. Still, with so many people the journey took a long while and over time the captain felt a bit uncomfortable in front of so many cameras.
Several hundred yards long, and about three hundred feet wide, the huge plane slowly flew over the dark, stormy sky.
When they went to the conference room together two hours later, the other Avengers did not look much more awake than they did. Natasha kept talking to Steve about something that neither Tony nor Rhodey could understand. Vision stood alone in front of one of the windows and looked out of it thoughtfully, while Bucky sat at the table and hit with a pen a tune on it that only he knew. Tony wordlessly sat down two seats next to the soldiers. Fury was still missing, and some agents as far as Tony could tell. Besides, Clint was not there yet, and that surprised Tony.
"Come on, Grandpa, get up," Tony said to Steve. He nodded to Rhodes, then walked back to the elevator. Natasha and Steve joined in and the soldier pressed the button to start moving.
"Oh, please. Traitor! I wouldn't call him that. Put it this way, we have a deal that will help both sides." Like an old friend, Burkwill put his remaining arm around the cold armor of Tony. He felt bad when the man pulled him slowly to the side of the bridge.
," he said. Tony could understand that the man spoke to the brain again. The two aliens standing behind the four agents and Pepper suddenly moved. So, they belonged to the brain behind him. It could be the only one. Something like desperate hope flared up in Tony. With strong hands, the two aliens each clawed a prisoner. Wilson cried out for a moment as the claws pierced his shoulder, and Khatib could not help but moan. The two men were picked up and with heavy footsteps, the monsters began to carry them away. Pepper and the others remained sitting on the floor. Tony saw what was happening and panic flared up in him.
It was very quiet in the room. Steve seemed to know that Tony wouldn’t forgive him, he noted. Tony saw only understanding, a little disappointment, but no dislike, no incomprehension in the other man’s eyes. It was a strange situation. Each of them knew from the very beginning that Tony wouldn’t forgive Steve directly. But still the soldier was here. And both were disappointed with the solution, but both were understanding. The two knew that it would never be the same between them as it once had been. Too much had happened. They both knew it and yet the two men looked at each other extensively.
