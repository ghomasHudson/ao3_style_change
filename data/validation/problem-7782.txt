Muffled voices fill his ears and he strains them to listen. He can easily pick up the fight that’s currently going on just down the hall. They’re arguing about the shield again and...his dad.
“You mean, you, me, Pete and…” Tony trails off and points with his beer in Bucky’s direction. The ex-assassin looked off, his skin dull and clammy. He tries to force a smile while he talks with Bruce and Clint, but it appears painful. Tony still has no doubt in his mind that Bucky would still be able to kill him.
“What?” Steve asks.
“That’s your baby.” The doctor points at the screen and Steve leans even closer, eyes growing misty at the tiny blob in the middle of the screen.
The rest of the team provides comfort when they can. They come by more than usual just to check up on Steve and make sure he was okay. Tony doesn’t bother lying. They could obviously see how distraught their captain was. They were too.
Tony sighs. “Sorry. I’m getting moody again. I guess I’m just tired.”
“That’s good.”
“I’m fine!” Peter blurts out, a little too loudly and Steve raises a questioning brow.
“I know, Tony Stark, that you’re a brave, selfless man. You’re willing to do anything and everything for the people you care about. Maybe sometimes you party too hard or lock yourself away for hours down here, shutting the whole world out. It’s just a way to hide. I wish you wouldn’t. You’re this amazing person and everyone should see it. For a long time I wondered if someone like you even existed. You’re a good person, Tony. I don’t care about who you used to be. I love you.”
“I have to go.” Tony presses the button for the upper level and sighs when the elevator refuses to arrive when he wants. “Come on, come on,” he mutters.
“He can sleep with me-us. Right? That’s how my Ma did it.”
“Hold on, Stevie. Look,” Peter points forward and the toddler turns his head, wiggling again to get down and run toward the monument. Peter sets him down and takes his hand, then together they make their way toward the grave.
“This is Steve,” Tony gestures in Steve’s direction. “Steve, this is Doctor Banner.”
Steve lets out a heavy sigh. He’s torn, that much Tony can tell, and honestly he doesn’t blame him. He’s a little hesitant to leave their baby for a few hours, but seeing Steve suffering was affecting him too and he wanted Steve to be happy again. A couple hours wouldn’t hurt.
“Of course, you’re hungry,” Tony sighs, mentally scolding himself for not noticing the signs earlier. He’s careful when he gets up, not wanting to accidentally lose his grip on his son. That thought alone is enough to scare him.
“Just take a test. And if not…” Tony trails off and places a hand over his belly. “We already got a bun in this oven.”
“Huh?”
He lays a hand over his belly. “I’ll protect you,” he tells his unborn child.
“You know what I think I will. Honey, I’m gonna be you okay?”
“Shut up,” Tony warns.
The blue eyes he’s looked into since as long as he could remember were shut, robbing Peter of another chance to stare into them. The hand that he had been squeezing lies limply off the table.
“He’s a baby.”
“I don’t. I’ve broken every promise I’ve ever made. But I won’t make that same mistake. I swear I won’t leave you again. I won’t hurt you anymore.”
“Let me guess,” Peter says and with a sad sigh he comes over, "you’re leaving.”
“I’m okay. I just need to sleep it off.”
“Hey,” Tony keeps his voice light and he wraps an arm around Steve’s shaking form. Steve doesn’t pull away and instead welcomes the embrace. “Talk to me.”
“Yeah. I know we’re not the perfect couple-”
“Let me take care of you,” Tony says.
“Pep, that’s dangerous. He would need safety goggles first.”
“Thank you,” Steve says and wraps the coat around himself. “You didn’t have to do that.”
“Tony, it hurts!” Steve groans and clutches onto his baby bump. Tony can only nod his head as he leads Steve out of the elevator and toward the medical wing where the staff is already waiting for them.
“Stop ignoring me and rolling your eyes! This is serious!”
Tony’s expression hardens. “Happy, let him go.”
Morgan is up two hours later. Tony hears her first and his eyes shoot open, immediately landing on the alarm clock sitting on the nightstand beside him. He rolls over, preparing himself to wake up and attend to his fussy baby.
Tony chuckles. “That’s right.”
“Steve! You need to tell me what’s going on!”
“I’ll be fine,” Tony assures. Happy still doesn’t appear convinced. “I’ll keep you both updated.”
“Thank you!” Tony calls out to him. “I owe you, buddy!”
“Not really. I’m sorry. I just-when you talk about him it just seems like it’s not really...nice. Did you hate him that much?”
There’s his pup, cradled in Bruce’s arms, and whimpering softly. Those tiny whimpers escalate and turn into a loud wail. Steve cries along with him, his heart bursting with love for the life he and Tony created.
“Did you do this so that I’d have something to be happy about? I’m happy that we’re having a baby. I don’t need a party.”
“Holy shit. You’re his kid? Damn how old are you now? 12?”
“Don’t be.” Tony keeps both hands on Steve’s face. He’s finally able to see the faint bruises up close. “What did he do to you?”
“I know.” Steve is still smiling. “Are you coming back to bed?”
“Ah so it’s official. Peter’s all grown up and one of us.”
(See the end of the chapter for

“Mine,” Steve whispers, his hand moving lower, following the trail of dark hair until his fingers brush against Tony’s slacks.
It was a boy.
“Uncle Bruce!” Peter cries out, snapping Tony from his thoughts. Peter rushes to greet Bruce, throwing himself at him and hugging him tight. Bruce returns the embrace and whispers something Tony doesn’t catch.
She goes ignored when her parents start talking.
Tony huffs out a laugh. “Nope. No more drama. Everything is...good.”
“According to my son, very old.”
“Steve,” Tony says, taking his hands again. “There’s something-”
The drive is one of the most awkward drives Tony has ever been on. He was used to driving alone and blasting music or being in the backseat and having a conversation with Happy. For a moment he regrets not bringing Happy along, but then he remembers how he had acted yesterday and Tony did not need Happy grilling him right now.
Finally the door is opening up and Steve is jumping out of his chair. He speaks to the doctor, only picking up a few words. It’s difficult to focus when all he can think about is Tony. The moment he’s granted permission, he’s ready to rush through the door, only to pause and send a glance Natasha’s way.
I’ll update soon!
Sam nods. “How’s the kiddos?”
It’s been two years since Steve escaped Hydra. The past couple of years haven’t been easy. Dealing with four pups on top of discovering a new world and finding his place in it left Steve overwhelmed. He doesn’t know what he’d do without his wonderful mate.
“It’s a long story.”
Tony frowns at them and directs his attention back at the baby in his arms, using Peter as distraction from his friends. Steve frees one arm from around Harley’s sleeping form to rub Tony’s shoulder.
Tony smiles and glances down at his son again. “I’ll try my best. I’d do anything for this, kiddo.”
“You can rest now. I’m not going anywhere.”
“How do you feel about my son?”
“I’ll sneak you out okay?” Peter whispers to Flash. He doesn’t even wait for Flash to respond, and he quickly reaches for his hand and drags him toward the front door, praying they don’t get detected.
Steve scoffs and shakes his head. “So we’re back to this? I knew it. I knew you had a problem with it. You’re the one who offered every single time! How the hell was I supposed to know that you didn’t want to get up? I’m capable of getting her.”
He turns to Bruce for help, only getting a small shrug in response. It doesn’t make him feel better. One glance at his other uncles shows stern expressions and a good chance he’s getting reprimanded for something.
Movement catches his eye and Steve directs his gaze on the stairs. He can make out a huddled form sitting on the last step, dark curls hiding the face that is probably streaked with tears. Steve sighs again and makes his way over to his other son, quietly calming Harley when the eldest realizes they’re moving toward his mean brother.
Steve chuckles. “I’m going to clean up. I promise.”
Steve smiles weakly at his son. “H-hey, Spider-Man.”
“Change of plan, boys,” The head alpha addresses his team. “The boss wants Stark alive.”
Steve takes a deep breath to steady his nerves, and once he deems himself ready to proceed, he pulls Tony in for another kiss. They take it slow, just like Steve wanted.
Tony gets out of the car first and Peter follows, lagging behind when his backpack slips from his shoulder and he has to stop to fix it.
“Who?”
“You got drunk. It’s what you always do.”
Peter sobs again and pushes himself away from Tony to wipe at his eyes. “It wasn’t just you. He did stupid things too. I just wish you both would’ve done more. I wish he didn’t go on that stupid mission. I wish you had been there.”
“I’ll be here tomorrow so…” Tony trails off.
Steve nods. He hopes Tony’s right.
Steve chases after him when Tony pulls back, crashing their lips together again. He cups Tony’s face as he deepens the kiss. It’s been too long since they’ve done this.
With his guard down, all it takes is a second for the man to issue another attack. But there’s no punch or kick.
“We’re all here, pal,” Bucky assures with a soft smile.
“No. I’m far from it.”
“I agree with this big dork,” Sam jabs his thumb in Peter’s direction.
Tony is hesitant to pass over their daughter, which only angers Steve more.
Tony watches the little family for a while before deciding to give them the space Steve requested. He turns back to give them one last glance, this time meeting the little girl's gaze.
Tony sighs. “I know you don’t believe me.”
“Sorry.” Tony can only hope his apology sounds sincere. It must because Steve smiles up at him and brings him in for another kiss. This time Tony makes sure to be more careful around the bump between them.
“J, run a scan,” Tony instructs the A.I.
“I’m home!” Tony calls out once he steps through the front door. He’s not greeted like he usually is and he can’t help but frown. Steve was off and normally spent the day at home tidying or catching up on anything that needed attention. Peter should be home from school by now, but Tony doesn’t stress about his son’s absence. He was probably with Ned.
Steve smiles and lays his hand over his growing middle. His son moves for a moment before settling down into a new position.
Steve takes a moment to catch his breath and he tips his head back, focusing on the simple task of breathing. Tony finds his hand and gives it a gentle squeeze.
Peter nods. “I...I wanted to talk to...him.”
He doesn’t go to his car and drive back to the place he’s been hiding. He still had his penthouse to escape to. His home appears too big now and a part of him regrets returning to this life. Everything seemed so simple back at his lake house. But nothing was simple. It was far from it.
“We’ll figure it out. We have time to get the nursery fixed.”
“I think we know how to make up...right?” Steve’s face heats up again and he quickly reaches for his glass to hide the forming blush.
“I guess so.”
“Go.”
“Yeah. He gets it from you.”
“I’m so sorry!” Peter apologizes. He can’t see how flustered he comes off but he’s positive she can.
With Steve still wanting to play, Tony moves on and climbs off the bed to grab the bottle of lube they keep in the nightstand drawer. It was running low but had just enough for one more night.
“Pig!” Peter points at the show. Steve can’t help but frown. He hated
Steve nods and glances around the chairs already set up in a circle. He finds one closer to the chair he knows the alpha will occupy once the session begins. He’s only known Sam ten minutes and already he’s warming up to him.
“Need help?” Comes a familiar voice. Tony turns toward the voice, thanking his lucky stars it’s Natasha who’s walked in on him like this. They could tease each other every now and then, but a lot of the time she was ready to step in and help. Especially now when it came to her nephew.
“You sure? Just say the word and I’ll drive you to the hospital. I’m not delivering this kid.”
“It’s always a pleasure, sir,” Jarvis says.
“You have to go,” Steve says and gently pats Peter’s thigh as he sits down on the bed. “And don’t you want to see Ned and Flash?”
“I know.” Sam nods. “Bucky just...you understand why he’s upset right?”
He’s forced to stop when gunfire rings out and he quickly pulls himself up onto the ceiling when more men appear. The bullets zip through the dimly lit corridors, striking the enemies and they fall to the floor. Then Peter knows why. His uncle Bucky was responsible.
“Yeah, you’re right,” Tony says and he rises to his feet. He grabs his suit jacket and slips it over his shoulders, adjusting the front. “How do I look? Better?”
“It was all over-”
Steve sighs and takes the offered seat. He doesn’t sit very close, making sure to keep some distance between them. It hurt. Just the other night he was curling up beside Tony.
Steve sniffs and turns until he’s facing Tony. “What if I can’t do it? I already hurt him and-”
“Nothing. I mean not nothing but...can we talk later?” Tony asks when he catches sight of the worried look on Steve’s face.
“I’m not doing that to him. Why would you ask that in the first place? You know what he’s been through.”
“What did I do? Steve, what’s wrong?”
“He looks like a Rogers.” Tony chuckles.
Anyway, the next one will have him and Peter again. Thank you for reading!
“What’s wrong? Are they-”
“What’s this?” Peter frowns and inspects the little box.
The ominous feeling never does dissipate. It seems like hours pass and Steve is still left lying wide awake in bed. His alpha is close by, snoring softly and in a deep sleep. Steve wishes for sleep to come take him away, but the Sandman refuses to visit him that night.
“Last week. You threw a fit over me misplacing Morgan’s pacifier.”
Steve hugs himself and cries, the sound shattering Tony’s heart into a million little pieces. Unable to break free and comfort his mate, Tony is forced to listen to his sobs.
Steve decides on a name.
“It’s okay. I’ll take care of it.”
“I don’t think Dodger will mind. Will you?” Steve smiles and frees one arm from around Peter to pat the dog’s head.
“I do help,” Tony quickly defends himself. “But I also have another kid that needs my attention and-”
“We’re in...the sky…” Steve frowns, unable to believe it himself. “A...hellicarrier...I don’t know. SHIELD rescued us.”
“Did he like it?” Bucky asks, smiling. His smile quickly falters when he doesn’t get the overly excited response from his nephew. “What happened?”
Steve searches for the little screen that was going to give him a glimpse of his baby, only to discover that there wasn’t one. He gasps when the image of the pup appears above him, floating in the air. Steve stretches his fingers out to touch it, pulling back when his hand goes through the projected picture.
A knock on the door is what cuts him off and his head is snapping in its direction. Relief washes over him when he hears Tony’s voice behind the door.
“I’m sorry for just dropping by like this.”
“You didn’t have to wear it. But I thought you’d look amazing and...damn that color looks good on you. Let’s just skip the dinner and go straight for dessert.”
“T-Tony,” Steve whimpers, the fear in his tone capturing Tony’s attention.
Peter’s diaper is wet, but it’s nothing Steve can’t handle. He feeds him again, settling down in the rocking chair to nurse him. Once Peter gets his fill and is burped, he’s falling back to sleep and Steve places him back in the crib.
And just like that, Peter’s mind had been made up. He’d be staying with his uncles from now on.
Steve catches movement on his right, growling out a warning when the bigger alpha gets too close. His warning goes ignored. With his focus entirely on the other alpha, Brock rushes toward him. Steve turns just in time and stabs the knife into his shoulder. The alpha cries out and stumbles back, gripping his wounded arm.
Tony smiles back and pulls out another muffin. “Chocolate chip?” He offers and Steve comes over, stretching out his hand to accept it. “They’re really good. Blueberry is my favorite but this one’s good too. Oh and the tea is...I honestly can’t say. I’m a coffee guy.”
Tony knows he must’ve struck another nerve and he tries to think of something else they could talk about. Peter was obviously smart so at least he could hold an intellectual conversation. They had the love for tech and science in common. Maybe he was his son.
“Uh not really. The kid and I-”
“Not so strong now, are you big guy?” The alpha mocks. He pulls his arm back and slams it forward, connecting his fist with Steve’s jaw. The pain that radiates through his face is nothing; he’s been through worse.
“I apologize. If you do need reassurance, I’m pleased to say he’d be willing to speak with you as well.”
“You don’t know?”
“Uncle Sam asked if I wanted to take your place. I...I don’t think I can. I’m not you. You said I was better but…” Peter trails off with a sad sigh and pulls his hand off the monument.
“Come here, baby,” Steve turns slightly to face his son. Harley smiles brightly and crawls into his mother’s lap. Steve smiles down at him and kisses the top of his head.
“Maybe more than that.”
I will update soon!
At the sound of his name, the alpha is snapped from his thoughts and he blinks a few times, completely forgetting that he had failed to reply to Steve the first time.
Steve has to bite back the snarky remark that forms on his tongue. He goes through the book, reading out the names as he goes; Tony hates all of them.
“Jarvis helped me. I don’t know. I guess what I’m saying is you need to face the pain. It’s going to hurt but it does get better.”
“Our first date?”
Tony frowns when Steve comes back over and puts the items in the bag. “Fine. How was your run? You weren’t gone very long?”
“Understood.”
Peter opens the compass and his eyes flood with tears. The picture staring back at him wasn’t of his own face, but of himself and his papa.
They fall into a comfortable silence. Peter doesn’t talk about Steve anymore, and Tony doesn’t push him, even if he secretly wants to hear more stories.
Hello! I hope everyone is doing well and had a wonderful holiday! I had meant to post this earlier, but life got in the way. I'm off the next few days so I'm going to update this one again and hopefully finish it. These two need their happy ending!
“Older than this!” Sam holds up the
“Of course.”
“Dad, we’re practicing again tomorrow, right?” Peter asks.
“Wow. She’s gotten so big,” Peter beams. The last time he saw her was the day after she was born. It was difficult for him to drop by the compound when he was caught up with school and being the friendly neighborhood Spider-Man. “Can I um…?”
They still struggle to find time for more dates. But that was to be expected with a new baby and the changes that came with parenthood. Tony wasn’t going to give up though. If he couldn’t treat his husband to a night on the town, then he’d find other ways to pamper him. Steve deserved it after everything he’s been through.
Steve can’t tear his eyes away from the baby in Tony’s arms. The baby that he didn’t know about until now. The baby that refused to make any sound since it entered the world. At that realization, Steve’s blood grows cold with fear. Why wasn’t the baby crying?
Maybe a punch in the face was what he needed.
“Sunday is for sleeping in. I thought we already established that.”
“So the kid’s good, yeah?”
Peter smiles brightly and then rushes out of the apartment, making sure to call out, ‘I love you’ before closesing the door behind him.
“Me? Come on, Cap I’m not going anywhere. I told you that remember?”
Eventually he has the men down and the room clear of any threats. He checks the wound on his shoulder, relief washing over him when he realizes the bullet has only grazed him. He just needed to be patched up and he’d be good as new.
“Yeah. It’s a long story that I know I’m dying to hear. Also you almost hit a pregnant guy. Smooth.”
Steve’s expression softens and his eyes grow misty again. He glances down, taking a shaky breath to calm himself before connecting his eyes with Tony again. “I’m sorry,” he says quietly. “I know you’re trying to help. I’m so sorry.”
Tony huffs. “I’m not afraid of him.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“It’s okay.” Steve carefully reaches out for the little boy and much to his delight, his son doesn’t pull away. “It’s only me. I won’t hurt you.”
“Oh so it’s my ass that’s more important?” Sam teases.
Tony thought for sure when this day came that he would be more put together. The past nine months should have been enough time for him to prepare for his son’s arrival, but now as he waits in the medbay for his son to make his grand entrance, it felt as if all of his preparations had gone out the window.
Steve smiles. “Yeah. This has always been my favorite part. I loved feeling all of them move.”
With a shaky hand he takes the bottle and screws off the lid. He’s terrified. He wants to throw them down the drain. He wants to get better and not rely on them anymore. But everything he did to get better wasn’t working. He was never going to be himself again. The old version of him was lost forever.
Pepper takes a breath to calm herself and she brushes back a strand of hair behind her ears. “I just want to know why you let him stay with you.”
Peter chuckles. “Yeah.”
“No, sweetie. You are an Avenger. Steve believed in you. We all do.”
“What’s in the envelope?” Steve gestures with his chin before he takes a small sip from his own mug.
“No, I do. I guess I just thought you’d name him after your dad or something...I don’t know.”
“Good morning, birthday boy!” Tony beams and comes over. He sets the tray down on the nightstand and turns back to Steve. “Before you say anything, there’s nothing wrong with a little breakfast in bed.”
It’s been too long since he’s seen this part of Steve.
“You sure he’s not Tony’s kid?”
“Always,” Steve promises and he pulls his son into another hug. “And when I come back we’ll make you that suit okay?”
Today is one of those hard days, but just like in the past, he has his family right there with him.
His eyes grow watery at the ones he couldn’t save and the one he came close to saving. He remembers all of them; he always will. He can still picture their faces before they were ripped away and never to be seen again. He spent more time with Sarah; it made him feel guilty. He should’ve been able to hold all of them the way he held her.
“Can I have a peanut butter and jelly sandwich? No crust please.”
“Can we not do this?” Tony begs. “Please?”
“You’re a wonderful father, Tony.”
Steve knows he should just walk away, but instead he finds himself leaning forward and pressing a kiss to Tony’s cheek. “Bye,” he whispers.
Not much is said between them after that. Steve takes his beer and leaves, returning to the sofas to chat with Sam again. Tony watches from the bar, wishing it didn’t have to be this way. But it was for the best.
Steve accepts and allows Tony to lead him to the master bedroom. The bed is large enough to hold them and the scent of Tony that lingers on the sheets is comforting. Tony holds Steve close, absentmindedly rubbing his arm up and down along Steve’s arm.
There’s only one guy left standing between Steve and his objective. Steve doesn’t make the first move, eyes trained on the gun the man has pointed on him, no doubt one of Stark’s weapons. The gun is going off and Steve raises his shield in front of him to block the attack. The sound of the bullets hitting the vibranium echo throughout the room.
Tony frowns. “Hey! What about me, kiddo?”
“I didn’t mean it. I would never hurt her. I love her so much. I love you.”
Their lips meet again in another desperate kiss. This time Steve can’t stand the bitter taste of the alcohol and he turns his head away, only for the alpha to grip his jaw tightly and force him to meet his gaze.
Steve loved everything about his boyfriend. Tony was snarky, didn’t believe in sleep and consumed more coffee than any human being should, but Steve loved him regardless. They didn’t always see eye to eye on things, but it didn’t matter when the love they had for each other was strong. Steve didn’t know how he had gotten so lucky.
“I saw this and thought the kid might like it.” Bucky holds out the bear for Steve to take.
Bruce comes in a few times over the next few hours to check on his patient. Steve’s laboring is progressing fairly quickly, which doesn’t surprise the doctor. Tony, on the other hand, is terrified. His son would be born soon. And he wasn’t ready.
Pepper nods in understanding. “Being a first time mom can be scary.”
“I think that’s his new favorite word,” Tony shrugs.
It’s not until Doctor Patterson begins the ultrasound does Steve grow excited. He can’t help but lean forward and glue his eyes to the screen. He can vaguely register the conversation Tony is having with the doctor and the comparison of this machine to JARVIS’s scans. He tunes them out, his attention on the blank screen that he knows will show pictures of their baby.
WARNING! This chapter contains descriptions of suicidal thoughts. If it is triggering in any way please don't read it. I'd rather you back out now and go watch cute cat videos or something. It was hard for me to write since I struggled with postpartum depression for a while and had similar thoughts. And if you are struggling please reach out and get help. You are loved and you matter!
The agent nods and sends Steve another smile before leaving the room and closing the door behind him.
Steve doesn’t hesitate to do as he’s told and he lies down on the bed, flat on his back. Steve shifts on the bed, his cock straining uncomfortably against his slacks and he reaches down to touch himself, palming his hardening cock to ease the ache.
“Don’t worry about it. I was wondering when I’d see you again.”
Peter rushes into the common room a few minutes later, his hair ruffled and skin shiny with sweat. Sam grimaces and makes a mental note to remind his nephew to shower after their conversation.
Finally, the finger slips out and Steve is able to catch his breath. The sound of a belt unbuckling reaches his ears and Steve’s eyes widened.
He’s up way later than he needs to be, but the thought of names doesn’t leave him alone. He’s already dressed for bed and under the blankets with a cup of tea on the bedside table and a book of baby names balancing on his belly. He flips through each page, carefully considering the names he comes across. Some of them work well with both Rogers and Stark. But none of them pop out at him.
“Steve? Honey, it’s okay. I’m here,” Tony assures, squeezing Steve’s hand back.
Peter shakes his head. “It still does. There’s still bad guys out there.”
“Oh yeah! Do you think you can run a quick errand for me?” Tony asks.
Hello! I hope everyone is doing well! I miss all of you. I’m still trying to find a routine and struggling a bit. But I’m determined to get there!
Tony sighs harshly. “Do you always talk this much?”
Steve follows close behind, still begging and screaming for Tony not to take her away from him.
Steve does too. Maybe he was fine and there was nothing to worry about. He wasn’t going to stress about it. How could he when he had to worry about Tony and their baby?
Tony nods and moves toward the closet, opening the door and poking his head inside. He’s seen worse but it was nice to know that Steve Rogers had clutter.
“Steve... he...he got upset again. I don’t know why. I panicked okay! He was holding her too tight and I was afraid...afraid he was going to hurt her. We had to leave.”
“By not eating the ingredients,” Steve huffs and snatches the bag away before they all get consumed. “I see where Pete gets it from.”
Bucky inhales sharply and stabs his fork into the eggs. “And?”
He could count on one hand how many times he’s seen Steve cry. Steve wasn’t the type to let his emotions show. It was easier for him to express his anger than it was when he was sad. Crying was something he did when he was alone and able to let his walls down.
“I won’t hurt him. I promise.”
Peter’s tired of hearing those words. Everyone was sorry for him and his loss, but those weren’t the words he wanted to hear. He wanted to hear that this was just a nightmare, that his papa was still alive.
Tony sighs heavily and takes the few steps toward Steve. He takes the bottle and studies it for a second before handing it back.
The conversation is dropped and they’re once again in silence. Peter is only able to take a couple of bites before he gives up entirely on breakfast.
“Thank you. Tony, you’ve done so much and I don’t know how to-I don’t know if I’m-”
“Yes, Captain. He promises to make it up to you. Would you like to reply?”
“Um I don’t know maybe-”
“You’re always bonding, Tony.”
Steve sighs and returns to his original position. They don’t say much to each other after that.
Harley was a different story. He would get into anything and everything. Tony was constantly having to keep both eyes on the toddler. Harley’s favorite thing to do was follow Tony into the lab when he was supposed to be napping and watch the alpha work. It got to the point where Tony would bring the pup with him and have him skip nap time.
“Let me hold him and say goodnight to the kids. I missed them.”
“It’s a little different,” Sam says. “What he’s going through and what your group is going through aren’t going to be the same.”
Steve drops back down to his knees and places both hands over Tony’s belly, his smile growing brighter when Peter pushes against his palm.
He doesn’t voice his complaints, not wanting to dampen the mood. He sneaks a glance in Steve’s direction, finding a bright smile and twinkling eyes. It’s been too long since he’s seen Steve this excited and happy. The negative results they’ve been getting lately was taking a toll on Steve. Tony is relieved that they’re finally able to have the one thing Steve has been desiring.
“I’m sorry,” Steve says and presses a kiss to the side of Tony’s head. “I guess I ruined the mood, huh?”
“Steve-”
“He’s worse?” Peter asks.
“Huh? Oh yeah. Yeah, I guess that’s fine. I need clothes but…” Peter trails off sadly.
“Hey, bud,” Steve smiles softly at his son. “Lights out in ten okay?”
He grows braver and runs his hand along the front of Tony’s pants, feeling the effect he has on the alpha through the expensive material. Tony growls low in his throat, his eyes growing darker and scent stronger than ever. Steve inhales deeply, his own body reacting to the enticing scent. He’s already wet, and judging by the way Tony’s nostrils flare, he must smell it.
“Yep. James did a little bit of reading today; he did good with that. Uh let’s see...oh! Sarah tried using the potty and well...yeah we’re working on it. Harley helped me down in the lab and Petey slept and pooped all day. Nothing too exciting.”
“No,” Steve sighs and he glances around the aisle they’re currently in, glad to find it’s just them. “Pete needs more things. I guess it would’ve been easier to ask FRIDAY to do it but…”
Training with his aunt was nothing like it was with his papa. She was harsher.
He directs his gaze back on the ceiling, contemplating if he should try to sleep again or get up to ease his worried mind. He chooses the latter and quietly gets out of bed, careful not to disturb his mate.
Tony rolls over until he’s hovering over Steve and ducks down to connect their lips. The kiss starts off slow and sensual, but that pace isn’t kept for long, and soon their kisses are heated and passionate. Steve moans softly and wraps his arms around Tony’s neck, bringing him closer.
“No,” Tony shakes his head angrily. “You didn’t. I hurt you. I said I wasn’t him but I’m not any better.”
“Now I know you’re full of it.”
“I think...I need to think about it some more.”
Steve glances down at the blanket again to hide the tears that form in his eyes.
Tony chuckles and takes a drink from his glass, then he sets it down and gives the menu a quick look over; he already knows what he wants.
The party is going well. Pepper had managed to get away from her busy schedule and fly in with Happy to attend. Bruce had promised he’d come if he was free, and truth be told, Steve was hoping the beta would arrive. Bruce was someone he’s grown comfortable around and the hole his presence left was palpable.
“Yeah. Morning sickness is awful, but it gets better. The second trimester is the easiest. Well, it was for me. Everyone’s different.”
But Tony still felt as if he had lost.
“He’s not the same. He’s not...it’s like he’s not even happy that she’s here. Before she was born he had been excited, and now...now it’s like he doesn’t even care.”
“Yeah. How are you?”
Tony pulls his fingers free and takes the bottle of lube, adding more to his fingers and smearing it around his cock. Steve spreads his legs a little wider, hands gripping the back of his knees and pulling them up, exposing himself. Tony doesn’t hesitate and leads his cock to Steve’s entrance, pressing the head against the rim and watching as it pops inside.
“Alpha-”
Steve winces. “I’ll just make sure the door is open.”
“You’re doing good, sweetheart,” Tony whispers and brings their connected hands up to his lips, placing a kiss to Steve’s knuckles.
“God Bless America.”
Natalie returns a few minutes later with coffees. Tony drinks most of his before he deems himself ready to sign. It’s painless and only takes a couple of minutes, but then it’s done and he is no longer CEO of Stark Industries.
“Maybe it’s nothing,” Tony says, “you’ve had cramps before, right?”
“I want cookies please.”
“You’re not...mad?”
“I know.” Happy winces in sympathy. “But you’ve been through worse right?”
“I have cramps,” Steve replies followed by a wince.
“And risk pissing off Pepper? No thanks.”
“Put him down and see if he’ll try walking again,” Steve says and sits with his legs crossed and arms open. “Pete, come to Papa.”
Now that Tony’s learned the truth about the pup, he finds himself growing attached. He starts to picture his life with the baby. It was going to change drastically and a part of him was still worried about becoming a father, but the other half was excited.
Steve tries to respond, only to cry out instead when another cramp begins to build. He can hear Tony’s voice again, followed by the click of the lock on the door. Tony rushes in, eyes widening at the sight of Steve curled around himself.
Peter starts packing a bag of clothes and other items he was going to need. He didn’t know who he was going to stay with, but anywhere was better than his own apartment. It was too painful.
“Not until 12. It doesn’t matter. You’re more important.”
“This is us at Disney World,” Peter explains, showing off the picture for Tony to see. “It was the last time we went.”
Peter frowns. “I’m tired of your jokes.”
“The baby,” Steve explains even though he shouldn’t have to.
“Fine,” Tony pouts. He comes over to join his son, doing what Peter had done and sneaking a piece of candy from the bowl. They both laugh from the fake hand. “Where’s papa?” Tony asks and he takes a bite from the mini Snickers bar.
“You have to say that.” Steve scoffs and tries to rip his hands free, but Tony won’t let him. Tony brings him even closer, letting one hand go so that he can place it on Steve’s waist. The mere contact shouldn’t affect Steve as much as it does. He sobs.
“Here?” Peter points down at the steps beneath him.
“Papa,” he whispers into the darkness again. “should I...it’s dumb and...I don’t know. Should I find him?”
Peter flushes and turns away to hide his growing blush. “Y-yeah. I mean...not all the time. Uncle Bucky...told me more. Not about you and him! Just...other stuff.”
It’s painful to see them together, but this was what Tony deserved. He deserved this torture.
Steve glances over his shoulder and narrows his eyes, then he continues to get dressed. Tony comes closer, wrapping his arms around Steve’s waist and placing a kiss to his bare shoulder. “I love you.”
“I don’t know. He dropped Morgan off and I haven’t heard from him since-”
“Stop,” Sam says again, this time a little firmer. “You’re upset and I get that, but threatening to kill the kid’s last parent is wrong.”
Steve rolls his eyes again and moves onto the next bathroom, picking up a bit of laundry Peter had left behind from his morning shower.
“No,” Peter replies, then he’s frowning. “I don’t think so. Maybe when I was a kid? He was gone a lot but I don’t think it was for dates.”
“He’s leaving us,” Bucky replies, his frown deepening.
“You can’t walk at all.”
Tony hits that spot inside Steve again, and the omega cries out, his hands gripping Tony tightly. Tony steadies himself on his forearms and ducks his head down, placing a quick kiss to Steve’s lips before attaching his mouth to Steve’s neck. The omega whimpers when his mating gland is stimulated again.
“I don’t think we’re ever having alone time again,” Tony jokes, and he reaches out to scratch Dodger’s ear. Dodger barks happily and licks along Tony’s hand; Tony doesn’t pull away this time.
Steve laughs. “Something like that.”
room. Their forced mating was something Steve has wanted to forget.
Tony finally moves from his spot near the door, taking slow steps toward the bed until he’s standing beside Steve. His eyes are glued on the screen, completely in disbelief over the small life on the monitor. He watches as its little heart flutters.
It’s past dinner time when Tony finally makes it through the front door. He loosens the tie around his neck and lets it hang. He shuffles into the kitchen, opening the fridge and searching through the bit of food he does have inside. With a huff he shuts the fridge and leans against the counter.
Peter straightens up and wipes at his eyes. He picks the photo back up and smiles at it, then places it back on the nightstand.
Pepper nods. “Yeah. There’s a few issues that need his attention and...didn’t he tell you?”
“I wouldn’t suggest it.”
“Yeah.”
“Tempting but school’s important. You’re a smart kid.”
“What?” Tony finally has enough air to speak. Pepper’s eyes are full of tears again and they’re streaming down her face. He’s never seen her so distraught. “Pep, he’s not...what?”
“Way before you,” Tony replies. “I think it was our first Christmas as a team.”
“And neither did you,” Natasha adds, taking his hand again and smoothing her thumb over his knuckles. “It’s not your fault, Steve.”
Rumlow scoffs and grips Tony tightly. He leans in close for only Tony to hear. “You’re going to regret that.”
“I just can’t lose you. I can’t. I almost did and-”
The group of alpha’s are closing in on him, forcing him further into the elevator and backed up against the wall. He keeps the knife raised and ready. It doesn’t compare to the weapons his enemies have, but it was better than nothing. He wasn’t going to stand down.
Happy makes a noise of annoyance. “It doesn’t seem like that from where I’m standing. Has your water broken? Are you dilating?”
“I’m coming back to work. I just need to deal with this first.”
“Just trying to do my part.”
“Hey, it’s okay,” MJ assures. She looks him over, that frown on her face never leaving. It only makes Peter feel worse. “I didn’t know you were back.”
“But my birthday isn’t for a few more weeks.”
He truly was a monster that deserved to feel the pain he was feeling. He deserved to live with the guilt for the rest of his life. He deserved to have nothing.
“Hey,” Tony greets lamely. He doesn’t get a response in return. “Um I just wanted to check up on you, make sure you were okay.”
“What?” Tony’s voice is full of concern. “Hon, what’s wrong?”
“I’m not throwing you in some place where you’re locked up and-”
Steve giggles and snuggles up against his daughter. Tony tries to stretch his arm around her to get to Steve, but after a few failed attempts, he huffs and gives up.
“I’m fine.” Steve’s answer isn’t reassuring. His tone is still bitter and tight. “All I wanted to do was sleep and I can’t even do that.”
He’s been through this enough times to recognize the signs, but it’s his natural instincts that inform him of the new life growing inside of him. The realization that he is carrying comes as a relief. He wouldn’t have to be strapped down and forced to be bred by unknown alphas. That nightmare was over.
Tony regrets those words the second they leave his mouth. He quickly glances at his son, finding the hurt expression on his face. It makes Tony feel like the biggest asshole.
Two alphas have him pinned, one on each side. Steve pays them no mind, his attention only on his son and the alpha going up the stairs. Steve struggles against his attackers, and he manages to slip one arm free and issue a punch to the man on his left, filling the room with a sickening crack. The man cries out and grips his bruised jaw, giving Steve an opportunity to wrestle with the other alpha.
Tony slants back in his seat, scrubbing a hand over his face, wishing the tears would stop coming. A part of him is beginning to regret listening to the message. It was like pouring salt on a wound. A wound that will never close.
Steve shakes his head and leaves the room to attend to his upset pup. Peter is sitting up in bed, tears running down his face and clutching his puppy tightly.
Poor thing. He must be exhausted. One look toward the backseats shows the other three pups. All of them asleep or just about to be.
Peter stops swinging when something catches his eye. He lands on the rooftop of a building to investigate, his heart clenching painfully at what he finds. On the wall of the building beside the one he’s on is a painted image of his papa. The artist had captured the famous captain perfectly. For a moment Peter believes he’s looking at the real thing.
“I love you too.”
Steve nods. He wraps his arms around Tony’s neck, bringing him down for a kiss. He clenches down on Tony’s cock, urging the alpha to move again. Tony groans and moves, slowly at first, until Steve’s begging has him fucking into Steve at a rough pace.
Peter’s smile falters. “He was ready to give it all up just so we could have a normal life.”
“A good one, sir.” Jarvis decides to enter the conversation.
Peter pauses as he thinks it over. He shrugs.
Steve nods his head in response, but Tony can still pick up on his hesitancy. He doesn’t blame him. He barely even believes his own words.
Peter huffs out a small laugh. “Sounds like him. But why did you keep me if you were so scared? I’m just a burden.”
“Hey, J?” Tony calls out to his trusted A.I. “Do you have the footage of me coming home last night?”
Poor Peter. I don't blame him for being curious about Tony. I swear their interaction is next. I already started the chapter so hopefully I should have it up tomorrow!
It comes back, stronger than ever when Steve’s belly swells with the new life. The bump is small and is kept hidden under Steve’s clothes, but Tony knows it’s there. He hates it.
“I am. I just wanted to make sure my two favorite boys were okay.”
Steve growls and stalks toward the alpha, crowding him against the bar and gripping him tightly by the front of his suit, slamming his body hard into the wooden surface. The alpha reaches for something on the bar, a small blade, but Steve is faster and grips the alpha’s wrist, twisting until he’s forced to let go and the blade falls to the floor and Steve kicks it to the side.
“Sure. I can’t say I’m not curious.”
“You didn’t,” Bruce answers. “But it’s been awhile since we’ve gotten together so we just assumed…”
Peter takes another peek at the test, hoping his nerves had conjured up his fears. But when he glances at the little window, the two pink lines are still there. He sobs again and has to fight the urge to throw it against the wall.
“I’m sorry to interrupt,” Jarvis says, startling the pair and forcing them to break apart. “But I don’t think you want three curious pups to walk in on you two...sharing a moment.”
“Hi, Petey,” Steve coos. “You’re finally here.”
“We’ll take it slow,” Tony promises. “We’ll see what happens. And who knows maybe...maybe we can be-”
Peter offers his hand, a shaky breath leaving him at the feeling of holding his papa’s hand again. It felt so real.
“No you won’t. You like to do things alone.”
“In a minute!” Steve hurriedly rinses his mouth again and tries to make himself appear presentable.
“Can you...if you can...I mean…” Steve sighs, internally screaming at himself for being an incompetent mess. Who knew having a baby could change so much? “Can you stay with me?” Steve asks, finally finding his voice.
“Why are you hiding in here?” She asks and brings the glass up to her lips.
Steve doesn’t respond, not that Tony was expecting him to. Tony sighs heavily and leans down to kiss him on the head, then he gives him some space.
“I have an idea for something. Don’t worry about it okay? I need time to bring it to life,” Tony says.
“What is that?” Peter asks after he’s accepted his beverage.
“Shit. They don’t even know.”
It’s the sounds of Tony’s cries that has Steve’s eyes shooting open. He tries to turn his neck in Tony’s direction, but the position he’s in prevents him from getting to his husband.
“My project is more important.”
“I’m only trying to help,” JARVIS replies, his tone cool and collected. It only pisses Tony off more.
But he was sure his papa needed help now, and Peter wasn’t going to let him down. He may be young and still in training, but he could do it. This would be his chance to prove himself.
“No! No, no I’m not scared. I know you wouldn’t hurt me. I’m just...mad. My dad didn’t do anything wrong and all of you treated him like shit.”
Tony smiles. “It is. I was thinking once Pete is older he could play in the lake. He’d like that. The city is huge and loud and God the drivers...he’d be safe here I think. He could be a kid.”
“Tony!” Pepper’s cry of frustration has him slanting back in his seat. There would be no point in arguing with her and he was better off just taking it. He deserved to be yelled at anyway.
“You walked out on me.”
“I know, sweetie.” Natasha wraps an arm around his shoulder and brings him close so that she can kiss his head. “He would be so happy to see what you did for him.”
After dinner Bucky excuses himself and hides away like he always does. Peter doesn’t go after him, deciding to give him space.
Steve chuckles and leans down to kiss Tony’s head. “We’ll see.”
Steve smiles and peers up at his mate. “You’re a good father, Tony.”
“There’s no need to get defensive.”
Steve fights harder than he ever has before, throwing punches and kicks until the men surrounding him fall to the floor. The only two alpha’s standing are the ones that have tortured him for years.
“I’d never forget Peter.”
As soon as he’s back at his penthouse, he’s calling out for Steve and running up the stairs. The omega is curled up in his nest, fast asleep.
They must already know that he’s carrying.
“Don’t.” Steve warns. Another growl is building in his chest. Omega’s were usually not the defensive type, unless it came to their pups. All of Steve’s instincts are screaming at him to protect his pup. “She’s mine.”
“No. Kid, I never hated him. We didn’t always get along but hate was the furthest I felt about him. I loved him. Believe me I wish I could go back and do all the right things. I’m sorry I failed as a father.”
Peter rolls his eyes playfully and throws an arm around his sister’s shoulders, steering her out of the bedroom.
That single word is enough to put a smile on Tony’s face. His eyes focus on Steve’s lips, the urge to kiss them again almost too strong to ignore.
“Yeah.” Bucky rubs at his forehead, his eyes squeezed shut. “Sorry. It’s been…”
With another sigh, he rises to his feet and makes the small journey home. He hopes Bucky’s in a good mood to hear the news. If he was with that damn cat, then Sam knew he would be.
Tears prickle at the corners of his eyes. He was tired of hurting and feeling the anguish. Of feeling the guilt. But it would never truly go away. It would always be there, always haunting him. It was his curse.
“You won’t. I promise you won’t miss a thing.”
Tony frowns. “I don’t whine and complain. Kids cry for everything and then there’s diapers and them getting into everything and making a mess and...Lordy, that’s terrifying. I just saw it all and I can’t deal with that.”
Peter is fussy the moment Tony takes him out of the stroller. He’s searching for food, showing the signs Tony has come to recognize. It’s difficult to hold Peter securely in one arm while trying to get a bottle from the diaper bag. Tony huffs. He should’ve left Peter in the stroller before attempting to retrieve the bottle.
Harley still enjoyed following Tony to the lab and helping with projects. James wasn’t interested in robots or any of the things Tony would build. He was content playing in the room or reading by himself. His reading was getting better, but he enjoyed looking at the pictures more than anything else.
James takes this opportunity to curl up beside Steve and offer one of his cookies. Steve smiles and accepts it, making sure to thank his son with kisses and hugs.
“Is fine,” Tony assures. “She can hang out with me while you shower and rest.”
“Just call.”
“Ah I see. You’re crazy about this guy. What’s his name?”
“Actually...it’s a boy.”
Tony has already forgotten about it and he sits up, lifting his shirt over his head and tossing it on the floor to join Steve’s. Now it’s Steve’s turn to stare, and he can’t help but smile at the sight of Tony’s growing belly. Their son was getting bigger and bigger every day.
being the issue into your head just to cover my trail. It was a lot easier than I thought it would be. You never noticed the tea, or the extra pill I would slip in with the rest of your vitamins. You didn’t even notice when your food was tampered with.”
“You might have put a mark on him,” Pierce says and he comes closer until he’s in front of Tony. “But he belongs to me. I’ll do whatever I want with him and you can’t stop me.”
“Why? So far I’ve done a pretty good job. Steve, he doesn’t know anything okay? You’re safe here. I promise he won’t do anything.”
He had a phone call to make.
“Dammit,” Steve curses when Peter squirms and refuses to latch on.
“He’s just excited to finally meet you. What’s wrong with that?” Pepper asks.
“Didn’t mean what? Did he hurt you? Did he take advantage?”
Steve whimpers and throws his head back. He focuses on his breathing. In and out. In and out. In and-
“Oh. I’m so sorry, Uncle Bucky. I didn’t mean-”
“Tony, what’s going on?” Steve repeats, his voice laced with fear. “Tony!”
Steve waits until she’s gone before finally letting his guard down. The tears that roll down his face are a mixture of happy and scared. He’s happy to have his best friend back and on his side again, and though that news should be exciting, Steve can’t fully devote himself to that emotion. He might have his best friend back, but he was still having a baby. Alone.
It was Happy who insisted on driving him. Usually Tony would’ve argued and driven himself, but his bodyguard was persistent. Tony had no choice but to give in.
Tony decides to take the two boxes in hand up to Steve’s apartment, making a mental note to bring up the rest once Steve is well rested. They ride the elevator up in silence and it’s not until they’re standing outside of Steve’s front door does he say something to Tony.
Sam smiles and nods. “Taking care of four pups must be pretty occupying. How are they? I know you talked briefly about them during today’s session.”
“And there can be limited photography. If you don’t want the pups to be featured then I can request that,” Pepper says.
Satisfied with Steve’s response, Tony is able to fall asleep, positive that everything between them was going to be okay.
“Fuckfuckfuck.” Tony repeats the word over and over again. He’s gripping Steve’s arms tightly, fingers digging deeply into the skin and leaving behind red marks. His back is curved and his forehead is pressed against Steve’s chest. He cries out suddenly, the grip he has on Steve tightens.
“I know. Just take care of it, please? And I swear that’s the last thing I ask of you. I’ll be back in New York soon.”
“Buck-” Sam begins but he too gets snapped at.
“Tony?”
Steve is taken into a new room, the light blinding him and causes the omega to shut his eyes. The room smells clean, but despite the fresh scent, Steve coils. He hated the showers.
“You mean, like I’m pregnant? No. Nat, I did and nothing. It’s just sympathy stuff, right? I’m just experiencing the same stuff as Tony?”
Tony huffs and leans back in his chair. “I’m not always sleeping around…”
“We’re just supposed to ignore the fact that you had been pregnant this whole time?” Clint asks and shakes his head in disbelief.
They both step inside the apartment and are immediately greeted by Alpine. Peter smiles and picks her up, cradling her like a baby and chuckling when she purrs loudly. Sam just rolls his eyes and goes in search of his husband, not having to search very far. Bucky comes down the hall to greet them in the living room.
Tony shushes him softly and kisses his head again. “It’s okay. It’s going to be okay.”
Ever since he woke up in a new world, there had been a lot of events and things he had missed. Movies had been a big one. There were so many films that were created during his time in the ice that he had missed out on. He’s slowly been introduced to them; movie nights with the team and Tony helped, but there were still a few missing from his list of things to watch.
“No. I haven't mastered time travel yet. Think of something traumatic.”
“It means...what if...what if we had the baby and then something happened? What if they got hurt or we got hurt? I could never live with myself if our child suffered because of us.”
“He’s beautiful,” Tony says from his spot beside Steve. He leans down to press a kiss to Steve’s head. “I’m so proud of you, honey.”
The door opens and Tony appears, a frown etched on his face. “What are you guys doing?”
“I’m sorry.” Steve’s voice is quiet, broken. Their eyes meet, allowing Tony to see how shiny and full of pain they are. “I’m so sorry. This isn’t me. You know that, right?”
“It’s yours. They still want the perfect alpha.”
“I know. I just figured you’d need something to cheer you up. You’ve been so...down lately.”
Steve’s hand flies down to the wound to apply pressure, but the blood pours out, coating his gloves in the red liquid. Steve knows he needs to keep moving and he pushes forward, each step causing a flare of pain. He sways and backs into the wall, breaths coming out as heavy pants.
The alpha in front of him wasn’t going to hurt him. Steve knows this, and yet he’s still intimidated by his presence.
There were no nightmares last night. Sleeping beside Tony had been enough to drive them all away.
Peter moves slowly toward his father, tears building in his eyes with each step. He ignores the other people around him, all of his focus is on Steve. Peter chokes back a sob at the sight of him. He doesn’t want to see the wounds and blood on his father’s form, he doesn’t want to see him struggling to hold onto life.
Steve doesn’t even realize he’s crying until his vision blurs and he feels wetness on his cheeks. He wipes the tears away with the sleeve of his sweater and sniffs. He pushes those negative thoughts aside and continues cutting the vegetables for dinner.
I promise these two are going to talk and Tony can get Steve some help. The team is going to help and be supportive as well. They're not going to let their friend suffer. I have a question: Do you guys like how everything is shown through Tony's eyes or would you like to see some of Steve's perspective? Let me know. Thank you so much for reading!
“Please, no. Please,” Tony quietly begs to himself as he waits for the information to download. Then his screens are broadcasting the footage and news articles Tony was hoping didn’t exist.
Steve goes back to his bed and sleep takes over once again.
“No,” Tony shakes his head and places his hands over Steve’s, taking them off his shirt and connecting their hands instead. Steve opens his eyes, revealing fresh tears. “I don’t want to lose you. Morgan...she needs you the most. You’re going to leave all of that behind.”
Agent Coulson leads them back to the room where the pups are currently playing with Clint and Natasha. The sight startles Steve. His children had been so reserved when he first met them and continued to be around people they didn’t know. It was surprising to say the least to find them playing with the omega and alpha.
“I’m not like you.”
He can’t help but grow aroused from the sight. The smell of the omega was intoxicating; one of the sweetest scents Tony’s ever experienced. He can’t tear his eyes away and he finds himself taking steps toward the omega.
“He’s almost here,” Tony says, doing his best to hide the fear in his tone. It must show because Steve is turning his head to glance at him.
“Yeah...just tired. Haven’t slept well in a week.” It’s a response Tony has heard before, and he doesn’t question it. He’s been affected by Morgan’s presence, but nowhere near as close as Steve. He didn’t have to carry her for months and then suffer with the birth; Steve did all of those things, so the guy deserved to complain a little.
“I love you,” Tony says, running his fingers softly through Steve’s hair.
“Yeah?” Steve smiles. “I know Peter is going to love you. Look how much Dodger loves you.”
Tony moves to get behind Steve, smiling when Peter’s eyes connect with his. “Hey, kiddo. Daddy won’t be here tonight, but you’ll be good for Papa, right? You won’t be a little stinker?”
It’s Tony’s turn to laugh. “Okay and carrot cake. Speaking of...your birthday is coming up and-”
“Hey, Petey-Pie,” Tony coos and drops the gun to touch his son. Peter stirs and his face scrunches up, a soft whimper escaping his pouty lips. “Shh. I know, kiddo. Daddy’s here. Mommy’s here too. We’re gonna get you out of here.”
And even though his friends want to make this day special and celebrate it the way they know he would want them to, they can’t help but feel that it’s too soon to have a party. It wouldn’t be the same without Steve’s smiling face.
“Yes but I-”
Peter sighs heavily, taking in the words being said to him. “I hope so. I want to be like you.”
“That’s beside the point. I’m gonna tell him, and I’m gonna apologize profusely for even doing it. I just had to make sure the baby was mine. I was ready to kick him out…”
“Let me guess,” Tony sighs and he moves to sitting back on the couch. “It made him the ultimate bad guy, right?”
Tony nods and holds Steve close again.
“You’re not my little girl anymore, huh?”
Tony smiles. “You too, Cap.”
Peter sneaks a peek in his dad’s direction, still finding him red faced and fuming. He releases a small hiccup and glances down at his lap again, more tears streaming down his face.
“Thank you, Nat.” Steve curls up against his friend once they climb into bed. They had boundaries like all friends do, but he was comfortable around her. She had been his first real friend since coming out of the ice.
The restroom door opens and Peter gasps softly, pausing to listen and try to guess who just walked in. When he can’t determine the person by sound alone, Peter wipes his eyes quickly and tries to make himself presentable. He discards his used tissue into the toilet and flushes, then grabs his backpack and exits the stall.
He frowns when he realizes he hadn’t purchased anything for his own place. He assumed Peter would be staying with Steve full time, but during the times he had their son, he was going to need to furnish one of the rooms he wasn’t using. It would be easier if they lived together, but Tony knew that wasn’t an option.
Steve puts the empty bag up in the closet, then he leaves the room and shuts off the light behind him. The first thing he notices when he makes his way down the staircase is a delicious smell wafting through the air. His stomach growls at the thought of food. His immediate assumption is Tony had ordered them takeout again, but he’s surprised to find the alpha cooking in the kitchen.
One baby down, one more to go! Peter is on his way. His brother had to come first. I'll try and get the next chapter up by tomorrow!
Sam smiles and nods. “Okay. What do you like drawing? Don’t ask me because I can’t even draw a stick figure. Don’t judge me.”
For a moment Peter wonders if that person could be him, but he quickly backtracks. He can’t raise a baby, not when he was just a kid and trying to graduate high school. He wanted to go to college and eventually meet the right person and settle down. Flash was definitely not that person.
“You’re…”
“I feel fine.” Steve shrugs, though he does start to wonder about the bit of nausea he’s been experiencing lately. He doesn’t want to get his hopes up. He’s done that far too many times.
“Yeah,” Peter nods and buckles himself. “We talked about Alpine. Or I talked. I guess he just listens now.”
Steve bites down on his bottom lip. One interviewer didn’t sound so bad. He had caught a glimpse of Tony’s live conference, and just watching it from a tv screen in another room made him nervous. He couldn’t imagine getting up in front of a huge crowd of reporters to tell his story.
“We’re not naming any of our kids Little Sammy.”
The shaky breath that escapes Steve doesn’t go unnoticed, nor does the tears that are beginning to roll down his face. Tony lets out a sigh and reaches for Steve’s hand, only for Steve to move away.
“If you want me to say yours then I’m afraid I can’t do that. I’m on no one’s side. But perhaps you should be on his.”
Steve nods his head. “More muffins?”
“Honey, there was nothing you could’ve done. You heard what he said-”
He bangs his fist against the metal door, crying out when the next contraction hits with a vengeance. Anyone standing outside the door would ignore his cries, assuming he was crying out from his punishment.
“Yeah.” Steve hadn’t intended for his tone to sound so concerned. He often wondered if the pup was truly going to take after him and inherit the serum. A part of him had wanted this pup to be born normal, free from any enhanced abilities. He’d mean nothing to Hydra then.
Any day now they would be welcoming their little Harley.
“Buck-” Steve tries to protest, but Bucky is already rising to his feet and opening his arms. With a sigh of defeat, Steve places Peter in Bucky’s arms. “Careful with his head.”
For the most part the run starts off normal. Steve pushes himself a little harder than usual, which of course doesn’t go unnoticed by Sam. They don’t mean to compete with each other, but it usually ended up that way.
“It wasn’t simple but…I liked it. A lot different than past Valentine’s Days.”
“So that’s how big you are.” Peter smiles and lays a hand over his belly. “I don’t want to call you blob and since I don’t know if you’re going to be a boy or a girl, I’ll just call you...Blue.”
Tony turns to look at Steve over his shoulder and shoots him a smile. “You couldn’t even if you tried.”
Tony nods and leaves the room.
The touch is back, this time with more pressure. Steve glances up to find Tony staring at him with a worried look on his face.
Halloween had finally arrived. The Stark-Rogers residence was finally decorated and the rest of the compound had received the same treatment. A party had been planned for the evening after a little trick or treating (for Peter of course).
“No I am! I’m happy everyone is here and that I have a new cousin on the way. I just miss them.”
A scene is starting to form. Cars are blaring their horns and bystanders are watching with curious eyes. Tony prays no one records a video. He’d be accused of hitting someone. He can already see the headlines on tomorrow morning’s paper.
And come up with a damn good apology.
Harley kicks again and rolls, no doubt searching for a more comfortable position. Tony pulls back, chuckling at the way Steve’s stomach morphes with each movement from their son.
“Okay.”
“Clint-” Natasha tries again, only to go ignored.
Steve studies the bottle. He didn’t know what Asgardians did for their young, but he wasn’t about to start following their customs. He still struggled enough with this new century.
“Nothing. Let’s just get a few more things and go okay?”
“Hey. You’re okay,” Tony soothes. He keeps his hands on Steve’s shoulders until Steve is relaxing. He lets go. “It’s just me.”
“Hey,” Steve’s voice takes on that soothing tone he likes to use when Tony needs calming. Tony can’t ignore it, nor can he pull away when Steve takes his hands. “This is a lot to take in, I know. But it’s exciting. We’re having a baby.”
The alpha hasn’t changed a bit. He’s dressed sharply in a charcoal gray suit and black dress shoes.His eyes still hold their icy stare and his lips still form into that monstrous smirk.
He moves quickly through the rest of the apartment, his heart pounding loudly in his chest.
“Tony,” he quickly rises to his feet and steps forward, only to pause when Tony holds a hand out to stop him.
“It’s okay,” Tony assures. “I know you’re curious. And I did.”
Tony chuckles. “It’s what kids do.”

“But I’m still a whack job?”
“Oh yeah?” Steve smirks. “Are you ready for your new mission, Cap?”
“Pete, you need to relax,” Steve leans forward in his chair to pat Peter’s thigh. “Everything is going to be fine.”
“Sometimes I wonder, sir.”
“Jarvis Junior.”
“Whenever you want,” Tony sounds distant now and when Steve turns around he finds him heading toward the living room to probably put some cartoons on for Peter.
The connection ends.
Steve heaves out a heavy sigh before answering, “I...panicked. I didn’t know the first thing about being a parent. I didn’t know your dad very well, you know with us sharing a mutual friend and all, but I told him and he freaked out.”
“I don’t want to lose you either,” Steve admits. His eyes glisten with fresh tears and a few roll down his face. “I don’t want to lose me. But I am, Tony. I feel like I’m not myself anymore and I don’t know how to get the old me back.”
“Good morning,” Steve says and turns so he can properly greet Tony with a kiss. “Happy birthday.”
Peter huffs and adjusts the strap of his backpack over his shoulder. He takes one last glance at the tower, then he heads in the opposite direction.
“You can be my therapist.”
“You want to...now?”
“Hey, you’re up.” Bucky smiles. He seems a little brighter now, but Steve’s unsure if it’s because of the coffee or because Sam is home. He decides both.
The call is from Pepper. She has the paperwork and is ready for him to sign. Tony finishes up with the crib, then heads to his office to meet her.
“You don’t like being here, do you?”
“I know you want to know how it happened.”
“This is my home so...yeah…” Tony gestures around the large space once they step inside. Peter’s eyes are wide again and soaking in as much as he can. “Don’t freak out. It’s not a big deal.”
Tony sighs, unsure if he should believe his son. He ignores his nerves and allows Peter to lead him toward the party, happy that they were together again.
The ride up is excruciatingly painful. No conversation of any kind is created; they remain silent and distanced from each other. Unable to take the awkwardness anymore, Peter clears his throat and glances at the large man.
It comes off as a joke, but Tony made stupid jokes when he was worried or didn’t have the proper response for a situation. He knew Steve wouldn’t take the small steps and throw himself off the cliff, but with the way the omega was acting, it made the alpha concerned and fear that maybe that’s what was going through Steve’s mind.
“So far. The next one might be calmer,” Tony says with a small shrug.
Steve holds out a hand to stop him. “I’m showering alone.”
Tony sighs. “You’re right. I’ll talk to them.”
“Hey! He was the only one available.”
That scene doesn’t play out. Steve is alone with his son.
“I punched it...so yeah I guess. Ah!” Steve hisses when Tony starts to clean the wound. “You know the serum will take care of this, right?”
Peter sobs quietly into his father’s chest. “I’m so scared.”
Peter huffs and crosses his arms over his chest. “I don't want to talk. I just want my brother back!”
“Sorry,” Tony turns to pretend to gather up the food. He can feel Peter’s eyes on him.
“Hey,” Tony is the first to say. “How’d it go?”
But Steve still struggles to relax and enjoy his evening. Tony had chosen a restaurant that was familiar to them. It had been too fancy for Steve back when they dated, and it still was now. He ignores the extravagant centerpieces and the tuxedo waiters. All he can think about is being alone with Tony.
Steve wants to accept that a child was not in the cards, but he can’t help but yearn for one. He said no more trying. And maybe right now they would take a break. Maybe they just needed some time until they were both ready.
Steve is ready to ask what ‘here’ was, but he’s never given the chance. Tony is already getting out of the car and walking around to open Steve’s door. Steve takes his offered hand and gets out.
He regrets it immediately.
“I don’t care,” Tony says and he lays a hand over Steve’s thigh, gently rubbing circles over the area. “Honey, this is a partnership. I don’t want you to feel like you have to do everything on your own.”
“I believe you.” Pepper ties the tie perfectly. “Steve would be happy.”
“There’s no rush, remember?”
Peter’s heart skips a beat at those words. At least he knows his dad missed him.
“Good night,” Natasha whispers and kisses him softly on the head.
“You’re gonna make me fall asleep,” Tony mumbles. Steve peers down at him, smiling when he finds his husband already drifting to sleep.
“Hey, Peter!” Ned’s cheery voice fills Peter’s ears. Peter turns, meeting the smiling face of his best friend. He looks away quickly to hide his disheveled appearance.
“Speak of the devil,” the omega says with a roll of her eyes when Tony steps out of the elevator and into the room. He’s whistling a happy tune and has a brown paper bag in one hand and a disposable cup holder with three large, white paper cups in the other.
“Wow. You must have your hands full. Four pups. I don’t have any myself. Riley and I never had a chance to.”
“So gorgeous,” Tony says at the sight of his boyfriend’s half naked form and leans down to connect their lips again.
“I don’t think Captain Rogers would appreciate your behavior.”
“I-I...can’t.”
“And you’ll get there. They’re called baby steps for a reason. I wish I could say after this session that you’ll walk out my door and feel a hundred percent again, but unfortunately that’s not how this works.”
Tony takes his full mug over to his computer monitor and has Jarvis boot it up. He sips his coffee as he waits, and then once everything is up and running, he has Jarvis search for Steve again.
“That is adorable! We’re doing it!” Tony agrees and Peter cheers in triumph.
“I’m sorry. God, Tony I’m sorry for everything. I want to be me again. I want us to be happy. I want Morgan...I just want us to be a family.”
“Wait,” Peter stops his uncle from going any further when a picture captures his attention. “I remember this,” he smiles and peels back the protective film to take the photo into his hands. “He let me wear his helmet sometimes and I’d pretend to be Captain America. We’d play for hours.”
“I’ll be back in a few days. In the meantime work on some of those suit designs.”
Steve shows no fear in front of him. All he has for the alpha is rage.
“Is he alright?” Bruce asks, his tone laced with concern.
“I don’t know. Tony, I don’t know.” Steve sobs, clinging to Tony tightly.
Dinner isn’t as awkward as Peter thought it would be. His parents are no longer giving each other the silent treatment, and they’ve managed to discuss their day without any tension. But Peter still feels some tension between himself and his dad.
“Ouch.”
Harley whimpers and clings to Steve’s chest and Sarah’s giggling dies down. Steve adjusts her and places her in his lap beside her brother. He hugs his children and kisses both of their heads.
Now he was going to do what proud fathers did: brag about their child.
“Are you from here?” Tony decided to break the silence. He doesn’t know what he’s expecting. Steve had already made it clear that he wasn’t going to engage in any kind of conversation.
Tony makes a mental note to never get on her bad side.
It’s not until another soft whimper reaches his ears does Tony pull away to glance over his shoulder. James and Harley are standing in the doorway, tears running down their faces.
They were friends...or at least Tony wanted them to be. They still had a lot to learn about each other, but there was no denying the chemistry between them. Tony didn’t want to jump ahead and assume they could be possible mates, but the idea of them as a couple wouldn’t leave him alone.
Tony rolls his eyes. “Those aren’t my intentions.”
“Tony-”
He blocks the sounds of their mating out. He chooses not to listen to the sounds the alpha makes. He ignores the sparks of pleasure that shoot through him.
Steve smiles and holds Peter close. “Yeah, baby. We are super strong.”
“It kinda feels like it is.”
“Nope. If Tony Junior is out then so is JJ. What kind of name is that?”
Those were definitely the wrong words to say.
“Morning, sleepyhead.” Natasha smiles. “How are you feeling?”
“The team can help us.”
Steve and Tony finally talk a little bit...
“This doesn’t make up for you ignoring me.”
How could he possibly carry a baby? How could he care for one when he didn’t know the first thing about being a parent?
“Tony?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I wasn’t sure, but now...now I’m okay with it. I’m terrified but at the same time I’m happy. I want to make him comfortable and keep him safe at all times. Just him being alone right now is making me anxious.”
He needs a name for her. The others never received a name, even when he had planned one out in his head. They probably wouldn’t be allowed to use it anyway. He wasn’t even allowed to be called anything other than Omega. That’s all he was.
He talks with Pepper again and Bruce, but it’s Happy he hasn’t gotten a chance to mingle with. He wasn’t sure why the beta was so intimidating. Usually it was the betas who were calming down distressed omegas. But Happy was different. His scent wasn’t bad, at least not really, but it lacked something.
He still thinks about the other alpha and the threat that’s still out there. He’d probably always be thinking about Hydra. The fear of being found and captured would never truly vanish. Hydra would stop at nothing to have him and his pup. But Tony promised safety, and it was a promise that Steve held on to.
The discussion of marriage never comes up again. Steve does his best not to dwell on it, but he can’t help but wonder why the topic never appears in any of the conversations. It’s almost as if Tony had forgotten he had even suggested they take the next step. But Tony wouldn’t just forget something like that. He must have something planned, or at least that’s what Steve decides to tell himself.
“Lift your shirt for me please,” Bruce instructs and Steve does as he’s told, lifting the hem of his shirt until the fabric is bunched up above his belly. He flinches when a cold gel is applied to the bump. “Sorry,” the beta apologizes with a sheepish grin. “It’s a little cold.”
I’m not feeling too bad today and decided to write. It relaxes me. But I swear I am taking it easy! Thank you all for being so patient and kind 😊
Steve nods and more tears spill from his eyes. “Yes,” he replies.
“I know.” Steve huffs and leans against the doorframe of the bathroom and folds his arms over his chest. “I just wish you didn’t have to go.”
Peter huffs and rolls his eyes. “I just want to go.”
“I’m pretty sure I’ve heard worse.”
“I don’t know,” Tony sighs. “Sometimes these things happen and we don’t know why. But it’s no one’s fault okay?”
“Till the end of the line, remember?”
There’s a rush of guilt that floods through him when he’s allowed to see his son for the first time since he was whisked away. The tubes and wires surrounding his son only add to the guilt. This wouldn’t have happened if he would’ve known.
Tony sighs and shifts in his seat. “He was...stubborn as hell. It was like I couldn’t even say anything without pissing him off. I mean, I’m not an easy person but...he was...something else.”
The kitchen is a mess after breakfast is made. He wasn’t the chief of the house; Steve was the cook. But with his husband fast asleep and their five-year-old demanding food, Tony had no choice but to attempt cooking.
He glances down at the pamphlet Dr. Strange had given him. The idea of group therapy sounded both terrifying and appealing at the same time. He would have to interact with others and tell complete strangers his story. But they would understand. They wouldn’t judge him. They were broken like him. They too were trying to figure out what to do next.
“What’s wrong?” Tony asks. He doesn’t bother keeping any worry out of his tone, and he knows, just by one look, that Steve picks up on it. Steve shakes his head, refusing to elaborate. “Honey, what’s wrong? Is this place not good? I can get you moved-”
For the most part, everything appears normal. Steve doesn’t complain about any of his earlier symptoms, and he’s able to enjoy the film and their family time. Tony’s no longer concerned, figuring whatever it was Steve was feeling was nothing to worry about. Steve understood the changes his body was going through more than anyone, and if it was something to be concerned over, he would say something.
“They’ll find a way. They always do.”
“It’s not a big deal.” Tony grunts again and pulls the blanket back to inspect the bandages wrapped around his side. He gingerly runs his fingers over the wrappings, frowning at the reddish brown stain. When he glances up he finds Steve looking at him. “I’m fine. This is just...it’s fine.”
Steve’s face turns crimson from being called out. There was no point in denying it. He wanted a check up. The bruises and cuts were practically gone at this point, but the exam was for something else. Something he hadn’t told Tony about.
“Hmm…” Peter thinks it’s over. “Because we’re super strong!” He exclaims.
“I’m serious! We need to stick together. You’re all I have left.”
“Just let me go. Let me make it up to you. I should’ve gone on that last one. Maybe things would have turned out differently had I gone.”
