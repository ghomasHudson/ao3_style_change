“…I love you too.”
“Oh I’m not a stripper.” Tony blushed furiously, suddenly regretting his attempt at wearing a sexy outfit.
“Beauty.” the Alpha was feeling a little unsteady himself, but he pushed it aside so he could keep reassuring Tony, keep crooning praise and adoration into the Omega’s ear until it was only remnants of pleasure causing Tony’s breath to hitch. “Damn, I wasn’t ready for that. I missed you.”
“We said we'd revisit the moving forward
of what’s going to happen if I keep seeing him.”
It was bullshit but it was
“Uh yes, wine.” Steve tapped at a bottle with a name he had no chance of pronouncing. It was red and with in the price range the internet promised was expected so he hoped it was a reasonable option. “For our entrees, I would like the porcini ribeye with the aged balsamic and my guest would like--”
“Okay.” she laughed under her breath. “Okay, lets start telling the story a little more romantic than that, but sure. Clint’s a big Omega. Maybe we just
Howard Stark was a titan of an Alpha. Not so much physically imposing as he was intimidating simply by virtue of his last name, of the tech company he’d built from scratch and the pages of patents that paid residual income in the form of six and seven digit yearly dividends. The Starks were old money,
“Yes.” Natasha answered impatiently. “Is everything okay? What’s going on?”
“His name is Steve Rogers and he lives in Brooklyn.” Tony chewed idly at a greasy fry. “Apparently he did a couple years pro ball for one of the MidWest teams, then joined the military alongside his best friend when things got bad overseas. They did most of thirteen years almost exclusively deployed and then were given an honorable discharge or early retirement or something for heroism in battle or--or going above and beyond the call of duty?”
“Are you gonna sigh and roll your eyes over the excess?” Steve palmed over Tony’s ass, kneading and gripping until Tony popped his fangs teasingly and pushed the grasping hands away. “You haven’t even see what I bought yet!”
“I see.” the nurse made a note in their file, most likely the start of a tally for how often Pete might be in Urgent Care.

Steve stayed quiet, waiting for his mate to continue and Tony pulled in a shuddering breath, “I um-- I used to imagine that conversation, you know? Like a thousand times, a

His throat jerked as he forced the words past the gagging sympathy in his core. “What the fuck, kiddo. What in the

“Right, right.” Clint knew the story of Tony’s last heat and how the come down from being settled had nearly wrecked him. “So instead of vomiting from nerves, you got fed and kissed and called it a night?”
Tony had seen it happen in their own building, children taken away, Omegas moved to state housing against their will, investigations into innocent occurrences or stereotypical kids roughhousing-turned-injury that were made out to be worse just by virtue of there not being an

“He’s perfect.” Steve’s throat closed up with tears as he held physical evidence of just how much Tony loved him, how much Tony accepted him and
“I… did.” Howard nodded hesitantly. “I called to try and check on you but you didn’t answer so I assumed--”

, darling.” Peggy shifted Peter to her shoulder when the baby started huffing and cuddling in like he wanted to sleep. “No matter how strangers might look or judge or anything like that, you know you’re doing the best you can by this little guy and that is all that matters.”
“Wowza!” Clint’s blue eyes bugged out wide. “And since that’s a word I hardly ever say, I’m gonna go ahead and say it again.
when the Alpha blinked scarlet at him. “I um--”
Tony puckered his mouth automatically, and Steve leaned way over the eggs and bacon to plant a searing kiss on the Omega’s orange juice sweetened lips. “Thank you, sweetheart.”
And yes, Tony had promised his mate lace but he knew Steve hadn’t expected delicate nearly sheer lace with silver threads snugged at his skin and he

The watch had been a gift, a spur of the moment purchase while Steve was getting his own watch adjusted at the store. It had been on sale-- which hadn’t mattered, of course-- a pretty piece the designer no longer carried and was the last available.

“T-Tony?” Steve gulped, then gulped again, shock making his voice a little high pitched. “What--
“Sure sure.” The Alpha really should be focusing on watching the customers in case one of them was his target, but he couldn’t resist adding, “And what about your friend? Is he pretty?”
“Hey baby.” Bucky dialed the phone without thinking about it, and when his mate picked up, he started talking immediately. “You aren’t gonna
Another minute of watching clear camaraderie and maybe even flirting between the two Omegas, and Bucky did what might have been the most impulsive thing he’d done lately and dialed the number for the diner right then and there. The Alpha wasn’t sure if he was hoping Tony would pick up so he could fire off some questions or if he was hoping big and blond picked up so he could—

, you’re beautiful.” Steve abandoned the idea of cleaning up and crossed the room to sink onto the couch, unable to wait a single second more before burying his hands in the Omega’s hair and dragging Tony in for a kiss. “God, Tony. Anything you want to wear when you stay the night with me is fine. This is perfect, you are
and I’d get forty dollars out of it!”
The Alpha tapped at his own chest. “
“Okay, right?” Clint wrapped an arm around Tony’s shoulders and plonked a kiss on his friend’s head. “I heard my sister in law screech it at Barney the other day and I dunno exactly what prompted that particular argument but my god, I’ve never wanted to use a description more in my life.”

“Steve.” This time when they parted Tony was close to tears, fingers trembling as he touched his lips in confusion and awe. “What are you doing?”
“When my Dad found out I was pregnant, he told me to get rid of the baby or get out.” The words had lost their sting for Tony, the truth of his Dad’s anger and those scary months of pregnancy long since overshadowed by just how tough day to day life had become. “I chose to keep the baby and he uh-- he put me out the very next day. Cut off my phone, my bank accounts, changed the locks on the house. As far as Dad was concerned, getting pregnant meant I was forfeiting college, a career and my entire future and he didn’t want any part in enabling someone who made such poor life decisions.”
The thought of Tony and this Omega—
…. But good
“If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it, right?” Steve’s bashful smile was endlessly charming. “I can’t think of a single thing I’d ask you to do different. I’d be happy doing this sorta thing every day for the rest of my life, I’m perfectly content.”
“I’m not.”
Bucky could do as best friend and guaranteed best man at the wedding was to make friendly with the bright eyed Omega after he and Tasha had gone a little Guantanamo Bay on Tony the last time around.

“Yeah.” Steve nodded shortly. “He told me. I’m sorry you’ve ever had to do that, baby. And the apartment-- that’s why you never let me send anything to your house?”

What kind of fella do you take me for exactly?”
spilling some rather corny Clint-esque humor, and the moment passed as he arranged the napkin on his lap and took a sip of his drink. “You should call me Tony, then.”

“He means pancakes.” Tony explained haltingly, hurrying to pick Peter up. “Pancakes are special occasions at our house.”

me because the more I thought about asking you to stay, I didn’t want you to ever feel like you were staying because you have to, cos I pay the bills or because you were more or less kidnapped from your old place and won’t be able to get it back. I heard what you said about how your last name and social eliminates any help from the government, how your only choice without me or a similar arrangement would be an Omega house and probably having to give Peter up but
“Steve, can I be very honest with you right now?” Tony took pity on the Alpha and squeezed at his forearm gently. “Hm?”
“The only reason I’m not arguing with you is cos you aren’t stressed about buying diapers anymore.” Clint kissed him one last time. “I’m gonna miss seeing you when you quit this place.”
“I--” Tony’s first instinct was to to shelter Peter from the soldier with her sharp scent and bristling demeanor but there was something deep in Natasha’s green eyes that felt like trust and

“Umm…” Clint glanced around the kitchen then ‘accidentally’ upended a bag of fries into the dryer and ‘whoops’ knocked a burger patty onto the griddle. “Two minutes?”
“It’s just a Costco run.” Tony met Steve’s gaze steadily. “Couples do that sort of thing together all the time.”
“You-- you want a wedding?”
“Alright.” the Omega finally nodded and tried to tease gently, “I guess you could help a little bit.”
Peggy was quiet, and Tony sank onto the bed with Peter in his arms, weary and heartbroken and
“That’s okay.” Tony hid a too big smile behind another tiny sip, and didn’t let himself think just then about why it made him happy Steve didn’t want him dating anyone else. “I’m glad you don’t have anyone else either, even if it’s only because you’re wildly awkward.”
“Why weren’t you going to be here in the morning?” Steve prodded gently. “You know you’re welcome here anytime, Tony. I feel like I’ve begged you to come over more and stay, you know you’re welcome here.”
Steve’s next smile was shy. “Thank you for not making fun of my uh-- my fantasy.”

Peggy inclined her head towards Peter knowingly, and Tony nodded. Though Peggy had never had any children of her own, she knew the stereotype of Alphas not adopting another’s child and understood firsthand how strong the instinct to raise and nurture their

“Then it will be the last time we see each other.” Tony snuggled the baby up close and rained kisses all over Peter’s cheeks, purring and trilling at the toddler until Peter clicked his tongue right back and left a slobbery kiss on Tony’s chin. “Because I will
I mean all of it right, you know I mean it?”

“Wait.” Vivid blue eyes opened wide. “
...and just then, despite what he'd told Bucky, despite this being an arrangement and not a relationship, despite it only being the third date and them only having shared one kiss, Steve knew right in his soul he never wanted Tony to leave.
The Alpha pulled away to press a kiss to Tony’s nose, to his cheek, to the Omega’s forehead, nosing through the longish curls and sighing shakily when Tony plastered himself in against his chest, hugging Steve tight around his neck. “And it’s okay, you don’t have to say any thing back, that’s not why I brought you up here and showed you the painting, but I just wanted you to hear it, alright? Nothing-- nothing too serious and not me expecting anything back I just wanted you to hear it. I am

“...I’m falling in love with Steve.” Tony whispered, hugging Peter tight and trying not to let his voice crack. “I’m falling in love with him.”
“Hey Buck, I’m upstairs!” Steve called, and waited for the tell tale running stomps of his best friends feet up the stairs to the loft. “You brought the good pizza?”

“Thank

“Neither of those things.” Tony checked the clock and sighed cos it was already almost time to get back to work. “That’s not what this is about, Clint. It’s just a job and I’ll only be doing it until me and Pete can get a little ahead in life. Money saved means I can afford the ride to a better job, better job means more money and more money means eventually a better place to live. This thing with Steve is just a means to an end.”
“No trust me, you care about this.” The other Alpha interrupted again and when Steve growled in warning, Bucky growled right back, impatience roiling over into his scent. “Steve, I wasn’t spyin’ on your Omega but I ended up seein’ him while on a job and did you know he was working at some piece of shit diner way out there by the tracks?”
, and the Alpha’s chest clenched up with longing when Tony stood on his toes by the stove and lifted the lid on the pot to smell the sauce, then made a surprised noise of excitement and anticipation that made everything else clench up as well.

“My whole fantasy was to meet someone and fall in love.” Steve tickled Archie’s tummy and the puppy growfed at him, then looked up to meet Tony’s eyes steadily. “Get married, have a kid, live happily ever after. Seems like I’m only missing one thing from that equation, so I should start looking at rings, huh?”
“About you ruining my day or the guaranteed food poisoning?”
. “What’s wrong?”
He hesitated, and Natasha’s voice sharpened, “Bucky? What else is

“I love when you smile after we’re done.” Steve checked in with Tony with a brief touch to his shoulder as a quick warning before gently, efficiently cleaning him off of Tony’s stomach. “Makes me feel like I did a real good job taking care of you.”
“Where’s Tony?” Steve ignored Bucky’s outstretched hand and tried to push past into the living room, nostrils flaring when he caught burnt chamomile and the withering scent of faded apple blossom in the air. “Bucky, where’s Tony?! Where is he!”
The bed was so soft Tony didn’t even bounce on it, didn’t have to
“We never even spent Christmas together.” Peter was whining now, trying to reach his Daddy as Tony cried harder. “Mama decorated the house the year she passed and Dad had it thrown away after and we never did it again. I don’t know that man and I want to be so mad at him but at the end of the day, Howard Stark is barely a person to me! He’s my
It was a careful dance of not quite lies but not whole truths and the Omega got more and more anxious as the questions continued. Steve usually took what Tony said at face value and only asked follow up questions for reasons of legit interest, but a group of soldiers and intelligence officers were a different story and by the time half time was over and the game resumed, the Omega’s stomach was
And sure sure sure
“Yeah?”
But with Tony and Peter moved in and with two cart fulls of Costco supplies, the space was quickly crammed full with all the purchases and Steve loved it. For so long his house had felt empty, he hadn’t wanted to buy meaningless trinkets, he didn’t have any sentimental items for the shelves but now he had toys for Peter and all of Tony’s supplies and their towels and toiletries and the artwork inspired by Tony hanging in the bedroom and one of Peter’s handprint paintings on the living room wall…
“Four.” Steve answered so quickly that Tony actually laughed a little bit at him. “Pete, a set of girls sort of close in age and then a little brother, a little Bubba. That would be perfect. Or if the last one is another girl we could try one more time for a boy and--”
. Not to work, not just hanging out, maybe out to dinner with you but since we’ve started cooking at your place or eating from food trucks when we take a walk, that doesn’t make sense either. I just didn’t need it and it didn’t really fit my life, so I was going to return it and get something else. I didn’t want to tell you because I didn’t want to seem ungrateful and it-- it’s usually easier to ask forgiveness versus permission.”
“It’s just us.” he said again. “I have a neighbor who helps me with childcare, but it’s just me and Pete full time.”
Tony’s lips pursed, and the Alpha finished, “You came from
The sound of Steve’s laughter popped the private bubble they’d been sitting in while the game and conversation flowed around them, and when the game paused for halftime Steve’s friends gathered around ready to get to know Tony better.

to just get up and head towards the door without kissing or hugging Tony or promising another hundred times that everything was going to be okay. Steve didn’t know where to begin with his questions or whether or not Tony would be open to giving answers. He didn’t know if he’d done the right thing by not acknowledging the baby or if Tony would resent him for that since the Omega hadn’t made any move to invite Steve’s attention to the kiddo beyond checking to see if they could both stay so Steve just didn’t
His throat felt like it was on fire and his head was fuzzy, but Tony scrubbed at his body as best he could in the lukewarm water and the last bit of bar soap left in the dish. He hadn’t made it to the store for the weeks supplies before Pete had gotten sick and now there was nothing in the house-- not soap, not an extra tube of toothpaste, not even a can of soup to heat up and try to drink down, no clean laundry…
as being vaguely outside and perhaps upstate, of course, but Howard didn’t need to know that.
And after he’d cried it all out and pulled himself back together because he was an adult and Peter was counting on him and no one else was going to take care of them so Tony had to do it--
“Wait, why the spare bedroom—” Steve’s voice trailed off when they pushed open the door and he stepped into a
Tony didn’t say goodbye, didn’t smile or even wave as he let his mate turn and walk them away down the path, leaving Howard alone in the cold behind them.
“Well, I love you anyway.” Another flurry of kisses over Tony’s forehead, into his hair, and Steve relaxed back into the pillows. “That was really good, sweetheart. Thank you.”
“This is the color you wore on our first date.” The Alpha picked up a paintbrush and touched the clean bristles to the soft red Tony had worn to the steakhouse. “This color here is the way your eyes look in the sunshine when you laugh. This shape here and here-- you’re so
“Don’t say I didn’t warn you.” Tony shrugged. “By the way, Peggy says she can’t wait to start watching Pete a few days a week at the new place. Apparently all the other old ladies are

getting hysterical. I just don’t appreciate a list of questions that have nothing to do with my kiddo having a fever. When can we leave?”
“Thanks for callin’ the diner, this is Clint speaking. I’d read you off today’s specials but they’re all literally terrible. What’s up?”
. “Alpha.”
“I--I--” Clint swallowed. “Well, uh--the weekend? I mean--”
. Curvy Tony was tempting enough to send Steve right to his knees and the Alpha cut another bite for his intended mate, secretly looking forward to the way Tony’s cheeks would flush with satisfaction and his dark eyes would sparkle once he was full.
because those women at the jewelry store had been so needlessly cruel to a father just trying to take care of his baby. “Any extra money you give me goes towards clothes for Pete or to paying forward on our bills. I can only see you once every two weeks because I have to work at least six days a week to make rent and I only have Peggy and every once in a while Clint to watch Pete. Can’t do overnight--”
Dessert had been milkshakes shared while they walked through the park, stopping to kiss underneath the stoplights and check text message updates from Bucky and Natasha about Peter. Tony hadn’t expected Steve to book a room in the expensive hotel so when the car dropped them off at the front, he turned with wide eyes and the Alpha just kissed the look away and urged his soon-to-be mate up the stairs and into the lobby.

“You look real pretty tonight, sweetheart.” Steve changed the subject before Tony could respond, nosing at the Omega’s cheek and dotting a kiss to the corner of his mouth. “Don’t know how I’m gonna concentrate with your tummy out like this, all this lace is
“You’re so wet.” Steve marveled, crooning sweetly when Tony arched into a tentative lick at his nipples and fastening his mouth over the stiff bud to suckle as he worked a second finger in as far as he could manage, trying to stretch the Omega as gently as he could. Steve was big,

“Daddy!” Peter cried from somewhere down one of the gargantuan aisles, and a moment later Steve came charging back up holding a squealing toddler under one arm and a huge box for what looked like a blow up ball pit under his other arm. “Look! Balls!”
He never painted commissioned pieces during this time of the day, these couple of hours where he didn’t need artificial light to see his canvas. Steve only ever worked on his personal projects, his

thinking about me going back to school and roleplaying naughty student and strict teacher things at home?”
“Thank you.” The next unsteady inhale swamped Tony’s senses with too potent Alpha scent, heady, syrupy rosewood and bold cedar, and he stumbled a step when it swam
“It’s my pleasure, Omega.” Steve got to his feet and bent to kiss Tony’s head before going to get another beer from the fridge. “My Omega, my pleasure.”
“Half a Swiffer mop.” Bucky chuckled at his wife. “That’s a good one, add it to our jar of stupid shit Steve gets mad about.”
, and his voice dropped towards a rumble, “I’m real glad to hear that, Omega. And whatever is ‘complicated’ about your life, I can handle, okay? So long as you’re not married, I can handle it.”
“I’m not traumatized.” Tony wiped at his eyes carefully and grabbed the lotion to hide his shaking hands. “I’m just careful.”
“Not particularly.” It was a well known fact that most Alphas had no interest in kids that weren’t their own, that most Alphas wouldn’t even consider dating someone with a kid since their biological imperative ran too strong towards continuing their
creeping up between them. Clint had assuaged the worst of his fears regarding Peter for the time being, but every date with Steve and every time the Alpha came close to admitting feelings made Tony tense up and nervous about all the

direction, and while Tony hated the idea of walking several blocks in his barely warm coat, the idea of Steve seeing his address on the shitty end of town or seeing the charge on his card for a long ride was somehow worse. “Actually I was just going to--”
“I know I am.” he replied calmly. “But even James Bond Level good looks like mine can’t counter an Alpha’s ego being bruised cos I’m taller and stronger than they are. Facts is facts, Tony. Besides, they told me the money wasn’t for me, at which point I asked them to guess what I’d done to their pie and
“St-St-Steve–”
“Don’t laugh.” Steve warned good naturedly. “I’m an artist so you know this is going to be dramatic.”
“Hey!” the Alpha automatically smiled, even though he looked confused when Tony came up and kissed him. “What’s going on? Did you forget something?”

The Omega’s smile spread wider and Steve breathed out a sigh of relief. “Damn it’s good to see you smile, Tony. You scent easier too. Feeling better?”

“This is Archibald ‘Archie’ Stark-Rogers.” Tony plopped the puppy right into Steve’s arms. “He is eight weeks old, was the heftiest boy in the litter and will be the absolute bestest dog for us.”
“He’s the reason I’m going to get a grocery delivery.” the Omega smiled a little when his phone buzzed with a message full of Steve’s debit card info and the password for his account with the grocery store he used, just in case there was one close to Tony’s apartment. There wasn’t one of those stores nearby, but the gesture was still impossibly sweet. “Tonight was supposed to be a date night and I was too sick to remember. I um-- I told him I didn’t have money for groceries after going to the doctor and he told me to buy groceries and medicine and to pay whatever bills I’m behind on after missing work.”
“Enough to pay my mortgage for the next two months.” Steve admitted, and Bucky choked over an unfortunate inhale of pepperoni. “Yeah, remember all the times you teased me about being artsy and nerdy? Which one of us is making gross amounts of money right now?”
“Stop.” Tony pointed a finger at him over Peter’s head. “This was the longest I’ve been away from my baby, and yeah okay, that sort of made shopping torture. Steve was talking about which shade of pink he thinks I could pull off and all I could think about was how I’ve only seen Peter for an hour in the last day.”
He kissed Tony’s left hand. “And a silver mark right here.” a brush at Tony’s bonding spot. “Be mine.”
as he thought about everything in college he’d missed out on. “Want a degree for your trophy husband?”
The studio apartment he called home was four rickety flights of stairs up and at the end of a dingy, dimly lit hallway with carpet that grew mold every time it rained and doors that stuck in the summer heat. It always smelled like old fast food, Tony was almost positive someone was selling drugs out of the apartment three doors down and there were some nights the police were called multiple times to the building.

“What…” Tony ran his hands through his hair in disbelief.
“Don’t worry, darling.” Peggy blew Tony a kiss and tucked the little bit of money into her pocket. She wished and wished she could afford to watch Peter for no money at all, but the baby had to eat and Tony didn’t have very much food around so Peggy saved the dollars for snacks for Pete and the occasional walk to the park to get a popsicle on the warm days. “It’s plenty for me. Are you working tomorrow?”
“Definitely as happy as you are.” Tony was practically starry eyed as they parted, chamomile and apple blossom scent bubbling over with pleasure and excitement. “I feel like I should be half comatose after what you did to me last night, but I think I could go for another round or two if you’re up for it,

Another one of those noises like Steve’s brain had failed to compute and Tony tucked his chin, looked up at his boyfriend from beneath his lashes and whispered, “You wanna breed me, Captain? Fill me up real full till I’m spilling over? Might be worth a try…or two.”
Tony had to stand on his toes to reach Steve’s bonding spot, and when he dug his fingers into the curve at the Alpha’s throat, Steve arched into the touch and growled pleadingly,
“Please don’t call him that, I cringe every time I imagine him bald and sixty.” Tony laughed a little. “But it was really nice. I got uh--” he lowered his voice. “--
“Good Omega.” Tony whispered, and Clint purred in appreciation. “How’s that, better?”
“You were the customer on the phone.” Any color left in Tony’s face abruptly disappeared, and he washed alarmingly pale. “Clint kept saying how weird it was for someone to call for a reservation and that you’d asked sort of pointed questions while flirting with him. Was that you? That was
. I figured this was the ‘moving forward’ date.”
“Yeah okay.” Tony let himself fall pliant into the Alpha’s arms, let Steve take his whole weight and floated for a moment in steady cedar and warm rosewood. “This… this is good.”
“No.” Cheeks burning, Tony forced himself to take a drink and then another one to give his brain time to come back online. “No, that doesn’t matter to me. Most Omegas marry older Alphas and most Alphas don’t get married until they’re at least thirty anyway, so I’m fine with it.”
compromised by the idea of role play. “Alpha, maybe this is a conversation for when we aren’t in public?”
as he watched Tony admiring himself in the mirror, and he told the manager, “He’ll wear these out, I’ll take the box and a cleaning set for them as well. Take the price out of the money from the watch and I’ll take the rest back in cash.”
“Steve.” Tony choked out a laugh, stomach swooping as he looked over at Peter snoring happily on the bed again. “Alpha, you are talking crazy.”
The Omega was furiously
. It was his own rules that kept him from staying, his own rules that had him leaving before nine to get home to a baby that was secure and safe with a friend, his own rules that Steve tried hard to never break and Tony had no one to blame but himself for feeling so lonely right now.
“Alright.” Bucky nodded. “Alright, we’ll leave it alone. We’ll only say it once and if it all blows up, we won’t say I told ya so and if it all works out, me and Tasha will be clappin’ the loudest at the wedding. I just had’ta tell you, okay? Had’ta say it at least once.”
over the clamor of the stove and dishwasher.
Three hours of service and nearly an hour of relaxation in the lounge afterwards left the Omega feeling boneless, warm and sleepy and pampered to the point of delirium but then a picture on the service menu caught his eye and after several moments of deliberation, he texted the Alpha.
Tony opened his mouth and Steve cut him off again to add, “And don’t ask for something you
“Look at his face!” The Alpha stopped at a picture of a

What did I ever do to deserve you?”

“Well if you

“I said no.” Bucky jolted into action, snatched a hair tie off his wrist and twisted his hair up into a messy bun, hands on his hips as he surveyed the dismal apartment all over again. “Alright here’s what we’re gonna do. You’re gonna pack yourself a bag, get some stuff for the baby and the both of ya are gonna go downstairs and get in my car.”
what I want.”
“When was the first time you noticed the baby acting sick?”
“Well then boy howdy, it’s a good thing I can make pancakes, huh?” Steve grinned at the toddler and to Tony’s surprise, Peter grinned right back, dimpling up into a happy smile at the Alpha. “Chocolate chips?”
Tony’s smaller fangs cut through the Alpha’s skin in a flash of pain, and Steve shouted in release when his cock throbbed again, coming a second time with the burn of fangs and the clench of his mate’s body tight at his knot. “

“-- the only that would matter is whether or not you and Peter were okay, even if I wasn’t in the picture.” Steve went back to unwrapping his new utensils. “My friends aren’t always the most tactful but they always have the best of intentions no matter which way they’re coming at a problem. I understand if you’re nervous to see them again, but from what Bucky’s been telling me, Tasha is ready to spoil the hell out of Peter and he knows he owes you an apology, so don’t worry about it.”
“Fine.” she agreed begrudgingly. “I’ll scope out this Omega with you, my love. Steve
The sweet Alpha pulled the jeweled barrette from her hair and slipped it onto Tony’s shirt where she’d tucked the ends, pinning it in place for some extra security. “Now then. Shouldn’t come undone unless someone is
Tony spent the entire morning of his birthday at the spa in the 1 Hotel Brooklyn Bridge. Peggy held onto Peter, the Omega muted any and all calls and text messages from his boss asking him to please come in on his day off because it was Memorial Day weekend and they were busy, and after a quick text to Steve to let the Alpha know he had arrived, Tony put his phone away and slipped into  a luxuriously fluffy robe to be led through a day of pampering.
When Bucky had spent weeks trying to come up with a way for his pal to get un-lonely and to get very much
Sam, it was a decorative coaster from one of Steve’s hoity toity art friends, remember?”

It was the truth but the words felt like
“Archibald Stark Rogers?” Steve didn’t know he could fall in love immediately with a dog, but when Archie cracked a sleepy eye at him and yawned theatrically wide, he thought his heart would burst. “Tony, are you serious?”

to reach out and drag Tony in close.
Encased in steam and with the echo of droplets off tile muffling any attempts at conversation, they were quiet instead, quiet as Tony soaped up the fragrant sandalwood soap and scrubbed with the loofah, with his hands, with his
“You know what? He’s right.” she finally said, and Bucky nearly fell over laughing at the look of consternation on Steve’s face. “He’s right, Steve. That spaghetti is something else. Good for you, feed that Omega some noodles and definitely get some bedroom time in. Easy peasy.”
“Wait.” Tony caught the twenty dollar bills in confusion. “Wait, they gave

and when she went to hug him tight, the Omega had to resist the urge to jump away before he remembered she was being nice and put his arms around her to hug her back.
The stretch of Steve’s knot inside him made Tony scream, made the Omega arch up and gush wet and he bared his neck and
stepped out into the sunshine.
He placed a gentle hand on the still dozing toddler. “Which… I guess Bucky told you about where I was living?”
-- could start that attempt at reconciliation and forgiveness.”
“Where are you?” Peggy wanted to know. “I thought you’d be home by lunch?”
“I have been commissioned before.” Steve felt foolish holding the only menu, but Tony didn’t seem bothered by it, so he kept perusing the list of entrees and trying to make a decision for the both of them. “And I dabble in a little bit of everything, though painting is where my passion lies. I turned the loft of my house into an art studio, and that’s what I do most days, sit up there and paint.”
“I’ll hand feed you filet mignon.” Bucky ran his tongue over his fangs pointedly. “Let you lick the gravy right off my lips.”
“What’s on your mind, Alpha?” Tony rubbed his nose at the Alpha’s heartbeat and went a little more pliant against Steve’s solid frame, letting his muscles unlock one by one and trusting Steve to hold him steady. “I half expected you to be asleep already too, seeing as how you and Pete had
“But it sure seems like there’s a lot of distance between us?” The Omega finished in a whisper. “I’m sorry about that, Alpha.”
“Oh yes please.” Steve had made enough pasta to feed a small army, which wasn't really the Alpha's fault, it was hard to eyeball dry noodle servings and Tony was grateful for the extra that would be dinner for him and Pete for the next few nights. “But I was serious about the garlic bread so--
Tony paused, and took a closer look at Steve. “Are

care about meeting the friends and instead just wanted to fall into bed and let the Alpha take care of him.
“Yeah.” Steve would’ve much rather lingered in the kitchen holding Tony and cashing in on a long over due kiss, but he knew at least one of his nosy friends would come barreling in to make a scene if they stalled any longer, and he didn’t want to risk it. “Come on then, sweetheart. Brace yourself.”
“Uhhh no.” The Omega shook his head, and Steve cursed under his breath about missing it. “No, it’s fine. Having a birthday right around Memorial Day means everyone is always busy anyway and I haven’t celebrated a birthday since my seventeenth--” a whole truth that almost made Tony want to cry. “--so it doesn’t matter. You’re not missing anything and you should absolutely do your family thing instead of being here for my birthday.”
“I have a room?”
“God no.” Steve forced a smile and hoped it didn’t look too much like a self loathing wince. “No, you’re engaging and very sweet and downright gorgeous. In fact, I’m a little tongue tied over just how beautiful you are. No, it’s not you. I’m the problem.”
“It’s the worst advice I’ve ever given you so
Steve waited for the Omega to disappear up the stairs to kiss a still napping Pete, then switched tabs to the jewelry store he was ordering Tony’s bonding jewelry from. He had to make sure the pieces were set to be delivered to the suite at the hotel tomorrow late afternoon before they arrived, he checked and checked and

and his eyes instinctively darkened. “Tony?”
“You take care of me just by being happy to see me in the morning.” Steve ruffled up the curls, wiped his thumb over a smudge of lipstick at the corner of Tony’s mouth. “And this was all perfect, thank you for such a perfect, domestic night. I told you what I’d wanted back in the war and you gave me everything-- the home cooked meal, the feeling of being married, being in our bed together. Everything, right down to me not knowing I’d love seeing you so much in a dress and lipstick.”
“You start storing rocks in your pocket for Pete and you’ll end up with more than you think.” Tony warned, but the Alpha only scoffed, “I’m a big Alpha, sweetheart. I can handle a few rocks.”
“Ohh-h-h-h trust me.” Tony rolled his hips back, reached back to touch his own entrance in open,
“Dada?” a little voice down the hall put an end to whatever Steve was going to say. “Dada? Awake! Bug’s awake!”

“I’ll be right back!” Tony called from the living room and Steve called back, “I’ll be right here!”
for a few breathless seconds as Steve just gathered Tony up and took them both to the floor.
“Alright then.” Bucky backed up several steps, giving Steve some space but still staying between the worked up Alpha and the rest of the house. “First of all, you need to know I used a Command on Tony and he’s still a little shaky about it.”
“I don’t know if we’re ready for a dog.” Tony smiled apologetically at the same time Steve declared, “We’ll take the fattest puppy in the litter!”
“My Grammy bought them for me the year I graduated high school and I’ve lugged them around to every place I’ve lived ever since.” The way Tony lit up at being proved right made Steve’s heart flip flop in his chest. “I used to have my family mail me one once a month when I was deployed so I’d have something new to read. I am an absolute

?” Tony asked in bewilderment, and Steve repeated, “Big ol’ rock, Tony. I don’t even go on boats just in case I fall out. Not scared of sharks, scared of my big ass dropping to the sea floor like an anvil and them not being able to find me. I don’t even take baths. Rather just stay away from it altogether. Do
side of things? I don’t see why someone at thirty would be less fun than someone at twenty two, to be real honest, I think the still-in-college kid would be downright obnoxious but I guess everyone’s got preferences.”
“I saw you outside the hotel and didn’t know what was up, then saw ya at the diner and stayed to watch where you went.” Bucky suddenly felt cold, frozen to his bones thinking about how Steve would feel knowing the Omega he loved lived in such squalor. “When you went runnin’ down the street just now I came in t’get nosy but I never thought--”
“I was really really scared.” Tony continued, and Bucky nodded quickly. “What you did was really shitty but I believe you were trying. Steve says you have good intentions but the subtlety of a tank and um-- well, my life is pretty good right now and I guess in a way I have you to thank for that.”
“I got a real sick feeling right here.” Bucky touched his stomach. “And all I could think about was how me and Stevie, we grew up poor but we were never not safe and you that pretty baby ain’t safe there. I never meant to scare you but I knew I couldn’t leave you there either.”
It was sort of an awkward end to what had been an incredible couple hours, asking if Tony wanted to stay only because the Omega was hazy, and not because Steve so badly wanted to fall asleep with his nose buried in Tony’s thick hair, but Steve had to offer anyway, “If you want to stay for a little bit then--”
“Well that’s okay, we’ll just have to get to know each other, won't we?” It had been a long time since Steve had been around a toddler. All his nieces and nephews were at least elementary school and he hadn’t met Val and Diana’s family yet, so he was sorely out of practice dealing with two year olds but the Alpha slid out of his chair and knelt on the floor anyway, one big hand held out towards Peter and his voice pitched low and rumbling comfortingly, “Heya kiddo, my name’s Steve and I’m your Daddy’s friend. How are you?”
“Oh hey guys!” Clint grinned-- and maybe blushed a little bit-- when he looked up and saw his next table was none other than Bucky and Natasha. “Good to see you.”

“I suppose I never did come here with you and your dear Mama.” Howard opened and closed his hands, expensive leather gloves flexing in the cold. “But now that I’ve retired from the board of directors and from most of the company responsibilities, I’ve begun walking this route every day for the exercise and for the--” he blew out a deep breath. “--for the nostalgia.”
, he’d suggested the Sugar Seeking Sugar app mostly as a joke but also as a way to force his best friend into socializing.
Once safely past the table of Alphas, Tony hurried over to a coworker sweeping the floors and Bucky pulled out his trusty Stalker Binoculars so he could get a close up look while still parked across the street.
“Very fun.” the Alpha decided. “I can’t wait for all those days with you, but you know, I wanted to talk to you about something else. Sort of related to this but-- but different.”
“You already are.” Steve stretched back out in the recliner, pulling Tony down until they were plastered together, the Omega held safe over his heart. “My Omega, my mate.
“You’re a war hero too, Buck.” Steve’s fangs glinted when he grinned. “Don’t see

“Oh no, I’d let Steve suds the hell out of me.” Tony bared his little fangs half viciously when Clint cracked up laughing. “I’m saying
“M’fine.” Tony hesitated, hesitated, then clutched tight at Steve’s side, bunching the shirt up between his fingers as he fought the urge to bury into Steve’s chest and just hide from it all. “Sorry about this.”
“We’ll take the biggest boy, that one right there.” Steve looked entirely too pleased with himself as he handed the phone back. “Can I have your number so we know when to pick him up? Which vet are you currently using so we can keep up on the puppies shots and appointments?”

“Goddamn you’re so beautiful like this.” Steve’s fingers skittered towards and then away from the nape of Tony’s neck, the urge to

***********
He stopped when Tony’s frame stiffened. “Right, you wouldn't think it was funny that we joke about stalking. Sorry.”
“Well you’re in luck, cos you might be awkward but I actually love mushrooms so...” Tony waved one of his forks in the air and speared one of the mushrooms right off Steve’s plate. “Thank you in advance for all of these.”
“Dunno about cotton mouthed.” Tony stirred enough to smack his lips a little before settling right back in against his boyfriends heartbeat and sighing in contentment. “Feel like you gave me enough to
“I um-- I--” Tony was at a loss for words, suddenly seeing the mess as a bonding moment between his son and the Alpha he loved, the hand prints as artwork Steve was happy to have all over his walls, the paint on the floor and broken brushes evidence of a day spent in laughter. This was hours Pete and Steve had spent together, money apparently not an issue as Steve had allowed the toddler to paint all over brand new canvas and had most likely purposefully broken the easel legs so Pete could reach without sitting on a stool. Hours and hours of messy, innocent fun that had left them both worn out and happy.... “I-- I--”
“It’s good thing you’re here to distract your Daddy from being stupid all the time, huh?” he teased, and Peter-- who had no idea what was happening-- just grinned and kicked his legs when the Omega ducked under the table to clean his mess. “Yeah, you and your mess are super distracting but I love you anyway. I love you anyway!”
for you in this.” Tony replied, but when Steve’s eyes popped open wide in horror at some sort of misunderstanding, the Omega quickly added, “I’m joking. Joking. I’m sorry, it’s been a long time since I’ve been on a date and I’m nervous and uh--”
“You never are, Omega.” Steve smiled then, coaxing and encouraging and as wholeheartedly open as he ever was. “But the way you’re still scenting a little scared is really bothering my nose. What can I do to fix that?”
It took depressingly little time to gather anything salvageable from the apartment and lock the door behind them for one last time. The idea of actually deep cleaning the studio was laughable since there was no rent contract in place and Tony had always paid cash month to month on the lease. There was no security deposit to void, no cleaning deposit to be lost so Tony just locked the door and walked away without looking back.
he’d been the one to get Steve into the whole sugar thing, but that didn’t mean he had to sit idly by why some big booty flashy hair pretty fanged Omega took advantage of Steve's good ol’ boy gullibility and wrecked his best friends heart, right?
“Steve and I are going out tomorrow evening and staying the night away.” the Omega started slowly. “And I thought I’d ask if you and Bucky would come over and stay with Pete for the night.”
Tony hung up and turned to his almost-mate. “Why is Natasha like that about Pete?”
, Steve loved Tony's laugh and as the Omega giggled out loud, the blond tried to surreptitiously open mouth inhale the floral scent of apple blossoms, shivering when it brushed his senses like a puff of wind.

. It’s not like finding out that I don’t actually like burgers and was lying for the sake of a second date. These are huge details.”
Steve put a hand to his chest like his very soul had twisted hearing the promise in Tony’s words, but he only smiled and repeated, “I’ll be right back.”
?” Tony asked, bewildered. “Is this online dating? Clint, I don’t need an Alpha, I need a damn babysitter so I can work extra shifts and pay my bills!”
Tony simply stole another mushroom and let his eyes dance at Steve from across the table.
. “I love you.”
“Would that offend your old fashioned sensibilities if I were married, Mr. Rogers?” Tony sounded like he might actually laugh, and Steve didn’t realize how badly he wanted to hear the Omega’s sunshine laugh until he was holding his breath and
“I read a few things too.” Steve was flushed clear up his chest and into his cheeks, eyes still liquid heated blue and breath coming harsh as he palmed over Tony’s chest, tweaked at his nipples and pressed experimentally at the protruding curve of Tony’s stomach. “Turns out if we keep your hips elevated, we got a better chance of getting a baby too.”
though. Marry this guy and hook me up with some of his friends. You have tapped into a hell of a stay-in-bed business right here.”
“Where’d you grow up?”
“Gross.” Clint shook his head. “No. Buy new clothes.”
“I love you so much.”
“You’ll call me to babysit Pete every once in a while, won’t you?” she whispered, and Tony whispered back, “Of course. And have you over for dinner-- I’ll pay for the car to come and get you. We won’t just let you go, Peggy. You’re family.”

“You can move in with me and Pete .” Tony didn’t even hesitate to offer. “If you keep Pete for me when I meet Steve, you won’t even have to pay rent. We can drive to work together, it’ll be fine.”
about is--”
Another echo of giggles, a flash of dark curls and just the tail end of a still bubble bath covered butt cheek as Peter tore past them into the kitchen looking for some juice.
Steve had said Tony was a waiter, the Omega had briefly mentioned working at a place close to midtown and Bucky had assumed it was an Applebee’s or something. It probably wasn’t enough of a lie to matter in the grand scheme of things seeing as how Tony wouldn’t be in the market for a sugar daddy if he had money but… but Bucky hadn’t expected
“Well not at first.” Steve kept his voice pitched low, nearly a rumble so the slow vibration would keep Peter asleep. “But Pete woke up from his nap and I showed him what I was working on and he wanted to help. So I told him we should decorate my room so it was pretty. He did a
, he hadn’t expected Tony in a dirty apron trudging out of a disgusting diner, he hadn’t expected the Omega to cringe away from the table of Alphas that called at him when he got back inside and Bucky wasn’t expecting to feel another wave of itchy uncomfortable thinking about that damn kid with Tony’s smile and now Tony apparently working in
“You look nice.” Tony was setting the roast on the table when Steve came back, and he peered up at the soldier from beneath his lashes, still bent just slightly provocative over the table, the dress falling in soft swaths over his hips and brushing at his legs, the neckline gapping only enough to allow Steve a peek of skin and brief hint of satin beneath. “I love you in a good button up.”

“Can I just hold you for a minute, sweetheart?”
“They screamed at you?” Peggy’s faded eyes twitched scarlet in a flash of her own fury. “Are you serious?”
“I’ve never been away from Pete on my birthday and I’m not going to start now.” Tony interrupted. “I’ll send an Uber for you. I’ve got lobster and steak coming for dinner and a bottle of champagne I shouldn’t drink all by myself. Please?”
“I’m serious.” Steve said patiently, or maybe a tad
Tony’s scent lightened again, apple blossoms sugar sweet and chamomile soft. “I love that idea.”
“Sort of shockingly handsome in an overgrown Midwestern sort of way, yes.” Tony’s pants were more spandex than anything else, a pair of dark blue stretch jeggings he’d snagged from the juniors section that made his booty look all sorts of
“Steve–!” Tony fruitlessly squirmed against the onslaught, tried to twist away from the relentless suckling and then in the same motion pushed back further into Steve’s mouth, crying out loud when Steve

he looked. There were still fading fang marks at his throat, his lips were nearly purple from being kissed so much and the scruff from Steve’s chin rasping at his face. His heart was still pounding, his grip shaky at the sink and he could still feel the
“I love you too.” Tony was squirming, trying to reach for Steve to drag him back down, popping his fangs and purring nearly growling until the Alpha was braced over him again, settled heavy on him again. “Steve-- Steve-- don’t leave me. Don’t let go.”
Tony was sitting in the back of the car nearly halfway home when he realized he’d forgotten to get money from Steve. It had felt weird enough to just
“Yeah, it’s my super power. Comes along with the hearing aid and the degree in sarcasm.” Clint reached out and snagged Tony’s arm, dragging the other Omega in for a quick kiss on the lips. “I expect an invitation to the wedding. And don’t think I forgot about knee capping that Barnes guy. What the fuck kinda name is Bucky anyway?”
and the vibration rumbled up his core and right into his cock. “Oh my god please– please touch me, please–!”

“You’re so hot in here.” Steve cursed out through grit teeth, digging imprints into Tony’s ass as he drove forward deeper. “Hot and–and tight. Fuck sweetheart,
Peter never went to anyone new, was painfully shy in uncertain situations and had entire meltdowns sometimes if they went to the store and there were too many people around, but here he was cuddling into Steve’s side while the Alpha promised to buy
“You didn’t message me back after our last date.” Steve chose not to comment on Tony’s blatant attempt to get his scent and instead slipped his arm around Tony’s trim waist and side hugged the Omega into him as they walked towards the Uber pick up spot. “Would you rather me not message you?”
“I-- wait, no that doesn’t make any sense.” Confusion again, and then a ripple of awareness and realization that looked a little bit like
. Every inch Tony’s child right down to the way his little nose wrinkled when Tony kissed his head and when he smiled for real and hid his face back in Tony chest, it did something swoopy and breathtaking and
“Thank you.” Tony said again, and the other Omega only winked before heading back into the dining room to serve their less offensive customers.
“Pretty Omega.”
He stopped, cocked his head curiously at the apartment door and the new-ish doorknob on it. “What happened here? Did they already re rent the place?”

and it had been such a long time since Tony had enjoyed anything in life that the simple act of learning Steve's kitchen well enough to put dishes away kept him smiling. Steve had never had anything even

of questions but Steve just shook his head and crept towards the door again. “We’ll talk again in the morning. You and Pete get some sleep, alright? If you need anything, just grab it. You know where everything is in the house. Help yourself.”
The Alpha made an embarrassed sort of gesture, “I just know what an asshole
The conversation turned to lighter topics and easier questions, and though Tony had to be carefully misleading when Steve asked where he worked or if he had any hobbies or what he did on the weekends, the Omega was able to sit back and actually enjoy himself as their dinner plates were taken away and the waitress came back with a dessert menu.

idea, first of all.” Steve pointed out. “You said you used to come here as a kid.”
. A football game watch party was tame compared to what most sugar babies did with their sugar daddy and Tony was lucky this was the first time an event with friends had come up. He’d chosen to show up, he wasn’t obligated to be here, Steve had invited him and it was gonna be fine, no one was going to judge him, he was going to be--
“I told you I wanted to get you diamonds.” The Alpha sighed down at the ruined pan. “Do you want to be involved in that or do you want me to pick the sets out and surprise you at the ceremony?”
“Yeah.” Tony took an absentminded bite of the burger, his mind squarely on Steve and the affection that so often turned those blue eyes hazy. “Yeah, I-- I will.”
to the old man, knowing he was signing papers where my dick had been.”
“And if your friends don’t come over, me and Pete will just play in it, huh?” Steve scooped Peter back up. “C’mon Bud. Wanna go find something else fun while Dad does the boring shopping?”
Tony made it home the next day by lunchtime, several hours past when he’d planned to sneak out of Steve’s place and get back to Peter, but still a few hours before work so he could catch up his friend about the night.
“Steve.” Tony hiccuped through a few tears. “Steve?”

that was echoed in her solid stance and piercing gaze. “I’m Hope. We’ve heard a lot about you, it’s nice to finally meet the mysterious boyfriend.”
“Some of them are doubles.” the Alpha admitted when Tony held up two identical shirts in confusion. “I liked the color too much to just buy one. Take one home, keep one here.”
Tony was gorgeous like this, every tiny gasp and breathless whimper electric in Steve’s ears, the grasp and slide of fingers against sweat soaked skin and the
“Doesn’t matter.” Steve wrenched his own shirt off first before reaching for Tony’s, tossing the soft long sleeve over his shoulder and capturing both Tony’s wrists in his big hand, pinning them up above Tony’s head and groaning at the
Tony couldn’t stop laughing, clapped his hands over his mouth and tried not to cackle while his Alpha was
“But it’s gonna wear on him.” Clint finished. “Always askin’ you and always bein’ told no, especially after not seeing you for a while.”
“Bucky you’re my best friend and I know you’re trying real hard right now but so help me
“This is so comfortable, I might never leave.” The big Alpha said as he stretched his feet out onto the matching ottoman. “I mean good
“Yeah, but I’m not trying to take care of a toddler.” the blond pointed out. “Which incidentally is a wonderful segue into the thing I wanted to talk to you about, which is this right here-- can I see your phone?”
“Oh my god!” Tony yelped and pitched the phone like it was on fire. “
. “I wasn’t expecting you to be this beautiful and I-- I’m finding myself at a loss for words.”
Tony didn’t have time to be self conscious over his soft tummy or the way he was certainly
Tony bit at his lip in anticipation when Steve closed the bedroom door and started towards the bed, yanking at buttons carelessly and tossing his belt somewhere on the other side of the room.
in his scent. “I’ll text you.”
Once Peter was back in his crib and sleeping again, Tony turned to face the unexpected Alpha, arms folded and jaw set stubbornly as he stared up into the glacier blue eyes and silently dared Bucky to judge him.
“Gremlin-hobbit-scrooge.” Steve set his paint brush down. “That’s a new one, thanks. I appreciate it better than the one about me being a shut in who should just start adopting cats
“That’s right you could.” Bucky rumbled approvingly. “What else do you need from us?”
They paused as the waiter came to deliver food, and Tony poked at the admittedly delicious looking sea bass before saying, “I could go for a walk.”
The furious pacing slowed, stopped, and Tony blew out a deep breath. “
“Now of course
“I do.” Tony tossed him a wink over his shoulder. “But we’re doing something different tonight. Come on, spare bedroom.”
If they weren’t overly tall and
“Welcome home.” The way Tony’s hips moved in the heels was incredible and Steve couldn’t look away, could barely get his eyes focused and mouth in motion to accept a sweet kiss from his boyfriend, then the whiskey glass pressed into his palm. “Dinner will be ready in twenty minutes, why don’t you go clean up and then join me?”
…Steve did the human equivalent of blue screening, expression going slack and eyes blanking out, all motion stopping and mouth falling open as he stared. “Wh–what?
“I’m the Captain.” Steve couldn’t keep his hands off Tony, holding the Omega securely at his side, fingers resting at Tony’s hip and down onto the rise of the Omega’s rear, his other hand sat at Tony’s leg. He wanted to put Tony right on his lap and he wanted to smother the Omega in a kiss but neither of those things would go over well with his obnoxious friends, so he contented himself with just holding Tony close instead. “They were all under my Command when I was in the Army.”
The park was beautiful, even at the start of winter. The leaves had long fallen off the aspens, the apple trees past their harvest and bare, but the evergreens were full and lush and scenting like sweet pine, lining the perimeter of the park and bringing bright bursts of color to the faded grass and the gray water of the partly frozen creek.
“You’ll just have her watch him on the days you work?”
*Gentle reminder not to throw your phone or screech at Bucky, he's doing the best he can with the situation he's been given and is coming at this whole thing from a position of good intentions both for Steve and then for Tony, and sure, maybe he reacts with all the tact of a bulldozer, but we don't call the guy Bronco because he's subtle, okay?*
“You know it.” Bucky dropped an extra large box of the best pizza in town onto the side table in Steve’s artist loft and came over to drape himself over the other Alpha’s shoulder, cocking his head and eyeballing the painting Steve was working on. “Hey here’s a question--”
hadn’t been enough to break a little of that All American self discipline.
“Steve--!” Tony had only a second to catch his breath before the Alpha caught him to cushion the hit at the floor, then pinned him to the hardwood. “
.” Giddy over the attention, half drunk on the knowledge that he was going to be bonded to such an incredible Alpha, that he and Pete were going to be safe and taken care of, that he got to wake up every day in Steve’s arms, Tony let the big blond pick him off off the ground and make ready to carry him right back to bed but then--
“I--” he sniffed. “I would like a bath when we get home. With you. Let’s put Pete down for a nap and I really really just need you to hold me and keep me warm.”
When the scheduled Sunday date came around, Steve cooked steaks while Tony mashed the hell out of fantastically butter and garlic-y potatoes and they ate upstairs in the art loft, balancing their plates on their laps while surrounded by Steve’s most recent projects and the lingering daylight of the early summer evening.
“I’d like to talk to you too.” Almost a whisper. “Thank you, Steve….

“I could add him to my Uber account?”
“It’s just the flu.” The Omega was

“It’s supposed to be a visual representation of the journey from loneliness and grief to hope, Buck.” Steve cut in before the big brunette could offer some off base wildly sarcastic opinion about the painting. “Shades of blue with undertones of grays instead of black, that eventually lighten to whites and violet. It’s a commission for a widow I met at an art show.”

“Yeah and we've both been here since six am and can’t go home till sometime around seven or eight so
“No one can prove it since I’m all the way over there.” the redhead said calmly. “What were you and Steve talking about?”
This was

about exactly how to do this, how to kiss and touch and convince the Alpha he was experienced and that sex wasn't a big deal but as Steve licked through his mouth and nipped sharp at his tongue, passed those sharp fangs along his bottom lip and tugged longingly, all those worries and stress fell right away.
“Bear?” Peter’s little eyes popped wide when he saw the size of the toy. “Bear!”
“Well, on that note.” Steve pulled back so he could count money out underneath the table, then took Tony’s hand again and passed the bills smoothly into the Omega’s palm. “There we go.”
“Okay yeah, that was a pretty bad innuendo.” Steve laughed but it twisted into a growl as Tony reached to knot slim fingers in his hair and hold him just

“We don’t live anywhere near here.” Steve spoke for Tony again, and the Omega leaned into him gratefully. “If we have any desire to contact you, we’ll look you up. Have a nice day, Mr. Stark.”
But last week Tony had come over for their regularly scheduled date and they’d cooked dinner together, talking over easy music and swapping places in the kitchen as they tried to cook seafood linguini and chocolate lava cake dessert. The dessert had been a complete disaster, most of the sea food had been eaten as it cooked and dinner had ended up being

making me feel like that, I just-- I can’t shake that feeling. We’re playing house but it can’t last, I shouldn’t get too comfortable in this life because it could all be taken away-- I’ve kept this job at this shitty place because since I’m not paying rent I’ve been able to stock away every penny of paycheck and tips because i can’t stop worrying about what we’ll do if Steve gets tired of us. Its like walking on eggshells. Something’s gotta give.”
The Alpha eased away enough to sit back on his heels and give Tony a chance to breath. “Can I scent you, honey? Now that it's just me and you?”
“I’ve gotta get a condom and some--” Steve’s throat closed up, core tightening with need when he made to pull away and caught a glimpse of the wet patch on the red panties where Tony’s cock was leaking, the shine at the Omega’s thighs where Tony was slick. “Okay, not lube, doesn’t look like we need lube. Just a condom?”
“Oh no honey! If your Alpha bought you that as a present--”
The Alpha full body shuddered when he parted Tony’s thighs and found the satin soft skin already wet, clear slick easing the way at Tony’s tight hole and Steve jerked forward with a low growl, rutting against the mattress when Tony whimpered and spread his legs to allow him
He gestured meaninglessly, miserably to their tiny studio apartment and shabby surroundings. “Just leave us alone.”

out of that situation. Having to barricade the door, hearing gunshots and the police at all hours of the night-- even back in the old neighborhood in Brooklyn Steve had been safer than that growing up and it tore him up six different ways knowing Tony and the sweet little kid had been through that all night every night. “You didn’t fail, Tony. You didn’t.”
“I don't even understand why you have this room if you don't use it!” Tony added when Steve sighed down at the stain and then tossed a rag over it and kept right on eating. “What, do you just order in take out and live in your art loft?”

You grow up, meet someone and fall in love, get married and pop out a couple kids. But I was small and I was sick and hell, even back then I knew I didn't like dames. But it’s still stuck in my head that
“I don’t think I’ve ever been so horrified by anything you’ve ever said in my life.” Steve rolled away from his easel for a piece of greasy, cheesy pizza. “Muses and artists don’t always sleep together, artists aren’t all slutty and art isn’t all horny, where did you even

“It’s not sketchy if there’s an app for it.” he tried to joke, then took a deep breath...

A work emergency sounded plausible, but Tony could barely hold it together long enough to ask the Uber driver to wait while they ran into CVS, and he knew talking to Steve would trigger a breakdown.

“Never.” Steve promised, and bent to leave one more kiss at his Omega’s lips before Tony lost himself in the steady, intimate pleasure. “I’ll always be right here.”
Tony waited until the kitchen door swung shut again before he collapsed, but
“Okay?” Steve waited, and finally Tony swallowed and admitted, “I’ve got to spend more time with Pete in the last few weeks than I have in his entire life. Sleeping in and getting home quickly and not having to work full time-- I’ve never had that option which means I’ve missed a lot of moments with him and you start talking about school which means he’s going to be gone and I-- I--”
“If a color could fly.” The artist in Steve was delighted with the imagery, with Tony ascribing such intense feelings to a particular color. “I love that, Tony. You wore red on our first date, was that on purpose?”
“Steve.” Tony gulped, heart pounding.  “Are you– are you proposing to me right now?”
In the morning they woke up together still naked, warm and drowsy from a night spent cuddling and when Tony rolled over for a good morning kiss, the Alpha pressed him back into the pillows and drove it
“Oh I’ve got no problem replacing your clothes, sweetheart...and I want you soft, right now.” he admitted after another few seconds, not quite negating the idea of being worked up enough to tear clothing, but also wholeheartedly promising that tonight didn’t

“I don’t need paid to hang out with my best little bubba.” Clint scoffed, but pulled the money out anyway and nearly shouted, “Ho Ho Holy dollar bills Batman! Is this how much you usually get from Steve?!”

“Doubtful, but sure.” Tony smiled hopefully when Carol came over to check on them. “Hi, I have a date tonight and apparently my clothes are gross?”

“You want to give me two hundred dollars?” Clint’s jaw nearly dislocated. “Tony, that’s way too much.”
“Oh my god.” Steve just sighed and rearranged Tony out of the wet spot on the bed before pulling the little brunette in over his heart and covering him with the sheets. “I know I should be used to you by now, but you shouldn’t say things like that after we make love. It sort of ruins the moment.”
He winced uncertainly. “Sorry for… for lying to you.”

“Tony has a kid?” Steve repeated faintly. “Buck, I-- I--”
Alpha and Omega were still standing in the foyer holding each other several minutes later, foreheads touching and noses bumping with every breath when Tony hummed softly and asked, “Did I do okay tonight?”
“It’s fine, sweetheart.” Steve waited until Tony had wandered over towards the necklace display, then turned on his heel and marched right up to the manager’s desk. She didn’t even have the grace to look ashamed and

with each punishing stroke.
“That you don’t have a valid reason for not goin’ and getting some loving from that Alpha?” Clint suggested. “I’ll keep Pete. I don’t work tomorrow so I’ll even keep him over night. We can watch cartoons on my phone and eat buckets of Mac and Cheese. I’m not exaggerating when I tell you it will be the most fun I’ve had in months. Go see Steve.”
“Yes.” Tony nodded slowly. “The Maria Carbonell attached to at least a dozen charitable organizations was my Mama. The uh-- the curly haired kid at her side in most of the older photos? It’s me. I went everywhere with her since Dad never wanted to be there. It was always me and Mama.”
It was a gorgeous house, well worth every single penny of the outrageous mortgage, consistently ranked on lists of best brownstones in the neighborhood and meant to be home to a family who wanted to live and grow and make memories in the spacious halls and welcoming rooms.
“Is this um--” Steve licked his lips to chase the taste of the Omega, still close enough that their mouths touched as he spoke. “Is this alright? I've been dyin' to kiss you all night but I should've asked first--”
“Take this.” From behind the easel that was Tony’s painting, the Alpha pulled an envelope out and handed it over to Tony. “Keep it. Use it for whatever you want, for rent or savings or whatever, use it to party for your birthday, use it for anything that will give you some peace of mind and make sure you never have to call me crying again.”

“I didn’t ask!” Tony hissed, ducking down in the booth and trying to hide from the prying eyes of the last few customers. “Sheesh, Clint! You can’t just ask someone that!”
“I gotta stop you right there, baby doll.” Steve paused in opening the utensils that had been his birthday present to himself. “I know that Bucky and Tasha weren’t exactly welcoming the first time around, and I know I came damn close to tearing his throat out for using a Command, but you gotta know that once Bucky saw your work, your house and especially Pete and once Tasha found out about Pete? Anything negative they might have been thinking about you completely disappeared.”

Tony was still laughing over Steve being so ridiculous as they left the store, earrings on and bag in hand and with Steve subtly tucking the left over money from the watch into Tony’s bag. “Oh no wait, I don’t need that. Steve, you should keep the money.”

“...thank you, Steve.”
“So maybe not the giant teddy bear then?” the Alpha asked half guiltily. “Cos now it seems really super dangerous.”

as the Omega as well and Steve had alternated between awww’ing at soft moments to laughing his head off when Peter got snarky. They’d shared grilled cheese and a modified version of the Mac and Cheese song, they’d napped on the living room floor when Peter fell asleep mid sentence shrieking about the dinosaurs on the TV, and the painting--

Both of Tony’s wrists fit into one of Steve’s hands and they both moaned when Steve shoved Tony’s hands up towards the pillow and pinned them there, the motion stretching the Captain’s body far over Tony’s back and bumping his cock against the swollen hole.

“A long way from your bedroom in Brooklyn, hm?” Peggy patted at Tony’s shoulder as she squeezed past him. “And yet Pete was just as happy here in this apartment as he ever will be in that Alpha’s mansion, do you know why?”
If he was asked about it later, Bucky wouldn’t be able to pinpoint the exact reason he took the crumbling stairs up several floors and tramped down an honestly depressing hallway to get to the apartment marked Carbonell. In fact, if he was asked about it later, Bucky wouldn’t be able to pinpoint the exact reason why he tried the lock on the apartment door and then broke every single one of his rules about not

“You’re beautiful.”
The Alpha waited until Tony was almost out of sight and around the corner before turning his car back on and creeping along slow to follow Tony down the street. He couldn’t imagine where the Omega was going on foot right now-- the subway was the other direction and ten blocks north, the bus stop was passed without hesitation, and Tony ignored the flashed lights of available taxis cruising the street looking for a drunk to take home. Bucky had no idea where Tony might be headed that was close enough to walk to, but this was a dark, dangerous part of town and ihe briefly considered blowing his own cover and simply zooming up on Tony to demand the Omega get in and let Bucky drive him somewhere.
“I-- I don’t know what you want me to say.” he finally said. “And I don’t know what you’re planning on doing but you’re stressing me out standing there so why don’t you leave and let us be?”

This was not  the moment to try and spark a bond-- that would come later-- so the Alpha bit Tony at the hinge of his jaw, at the curve where neck met collar bone, the lobe of his ear, the meat of his shoulder, scraped fangs over what he could reach of Tony’s chest, hefted the Omega higher and stroked deeper so he could bite at Tony’s lips and taste

house and Tony and Peter were only staying. It was Steve’s kitchen and the Omega was very careful to remember where everything went so he could empty the dishwasher or clear the strainer. It was Steve’s guest bathroom so Tony was very careful to keep their toiletries in the mirrored cupboard and off the counter, to keep their towels dry and neatly arranged and to wipe down the bath and shower every time they used it.
“I will kill you.” Steve threatened and the other Alpha snort laughed. “Bucky, I swear to god. Just come over, watch a movie, give him a bath, put him to bed, make him breakfast in the morning. It’s not that big of a deal.”
“I’m starting to believe it.” Tony whispered. “Yeah.”
It was
“I think it was maybe page fifty two.” Steve corrected, and Tony smiled around the last bite of spaghetti. “But yeah, that's exactly what happened. I just needed furniture and I didn't care what it was. The living room is from a catalog, both the guest bedrooms are furnished from a catalog... I had a little input into the master bedroom, but it's just a bed, right? It isn't that important. I order in a lot of take out, go for my runs down the Riverwalk and Promenade and spend my days and most of the night in my art studio.”

“Okay.” the Alpha reached to cover Tony’s hand with his own, weaving their fingers together and lifting Tony’s hand to kiss his knuckles. “No problem. We just won’t talk about it. Please don’t scent so sad, sweetheart. I’m sorry I even brought it up.”
“Tony…”
pleadingly when the Alpha murmured something else sweet and reassuring into the phone.
“Thank you for this.” He whispered again as Tony was drifting off to sleep. “For being so beautiful and bringing a part of my old life here and letting me be open and honest with you. I couldn’t want anything else than this right here.”
“That makes me real happy, babydoll.” The Alpha murmured back. “I love you, Tony. So much.”
“See?” Bucky wiped at his eyes and made a quick kissy noise at the phone for his wife. “See, you shouldn’t be nervous about anything tonight. Why are you cleaning like this?”
“I have to work tomorrow afternoon.” Tony pointed out, but Steve brushed it off-- “That’s fine, we can spend the morning together. I’ll empty out a drawer and we can go shopping and buy you whatever you want to keep here. Or call out of work and spend the entire day with me. I’ll give you twice your normal allowance to make up for any tips you miss and it’ll give me the chance to really spoil you. We can do whatever you want all day long, what do you say?”

or something.”
“I kill people, love.” the Alpha said flatly. “I collect data and then use the data to kill them. If we’re being honest about all this other stuff, we might as well be honest about that.”
“Stop.” Tony put a hand over his mate’s mouth and sighed in relief and adoration when Steve immediately nuzzled at his palm and kissed his fingers. “Let’s start with one and go from there, huh?”
“Okay.” Tony pursed his lips and pretended to think. “And how am I going to buy new clothes on my half minimum wage salary and tips that go to babysitters and diapers?”
“My Omega.” he repeated, and Tony put a hand over his mouth to quiet an instinctive, helpless whine. “We’re all gonna be just fine. You and Pete can stay right here with me, right here at home, alright? Stay.”

“Oh no, I wasn’t gonna comment on how you’re clearly only takin’ commissions that reflect your own sad little heart.” Bucky’s long hair fell forward into his eyes when he shook his head. “I was gonna say somethin’ shitty about how you got this big ass house and spend all your days up here in the attic like a gremlin-hobbit- scrooge.”
“Pete’s just old enough to have a really good time opening presents.” he continued. “And I’ve got a list a page long of everything I want to buy you, so after we settle on a wedding venue or even before we settle on a wedding venue, let’s start talking about Christmas.”

up to the family Omega to let a new person meet their baby so Tony offering was a big deal and the weight of it didn’t escape Steve’s notice. “Tony, I would love to meet him.”
Tony bit at him again, cutting his little fangs into Steve’s earlobe, into the Alpha’s neck and into the meat of the broad shoulders until Steve groaned and stuttered forward against him, the hand at Tony’s ass shoving up beneath the sweater to get to bare skin and nails raking down Tony’s back.

For most of the past year, this time of day had been entirely unproductive for Steve, his mind blank and hands still as he stared at halfway finished projects and couldn’t seem to find the energy or want to pick them up and continue working. Pieces that had taken his breath away at first brushstroke lay in piles abandoned, sketchbooks filled halfway and then never looked at again… it was

to approach the dog, and the Alpha panted an apologetic, “Sorry about that. I don’t know if Pete’s ever seen a dog up close, he wouldn’t know to slow down and ask about petting first.”
“And you’re gagging for my knot?” Steve shoved his face into Tony’s throat and nipped at him playfully, thoroughly loving the way the Omega squirmed and wiggled further into him. “Mr. Carbonell, do you kiss Grandma Peggy with that mouth?”
“You’re so awkward.” The Omega laughed softly. “And I’m fine. Just moving slow. It’s um-- it’s been a long time for me and you are-- you are--I’m a little worried about being sore for my shift tomorrow.”
“This is your freedom, Tony.” The rosewood scent deepened
Steve would be seeing any of this, and his hands tightened on the steering wheel preparing to speed up and snatch an unsuspecting Omega into his car just so he wouldn’t have to explain to his best friend why he let Tony walk alone through some god awful street after sunset.
