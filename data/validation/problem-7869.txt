He tugged Tony’s hand and pulled him forward, kissing him gently. It hurt, because his nose was still throbbing at any light contact, but it was worth it anyway. Tony kissed him back just as soft and tentative, like he was still nervous Steve was going to turn around and push him off any moment.
It took another minute of everyone chatting before Bucky actually got around to driving off, but eventually they managed to exit the parking lot and head out back home. Whilst they drove, Steve ticked off a few names on his checklist- Thor and Peggy were both done now, and he had Bucky’s Christmas gift planned out already, so that’d be fine. Everyone else would probably not be too bothered about whatever they received anyway- he knew for a fact that he could give Clint a dirty sock and the guy would probably cherish it.
He’d survived death before. He could do it again. Tony was stronger than that, and Steve just had to have faith in him.
But he remembered it. He… he remembered the feeling of Tony’s body breaking underneath his hands.
Apparently, though, bathing was the same no matter what age you were. Tony sat the kid down in the water promptly after discovering as such, grinning at Peter’s surprised expression. “You ever had a bath before, Munchkin?” He asked, swirling the bubbles around and watching as Peter gazed down at them. “What about bubbles? Ever seen them?”
But no matter how hard he tried, nothing came up. The most he got was the briefest of flashes, like images through a cloud of smoke, hazy and unable to be properly grasped. His hands clenched down hard against the side of the table and he felt sweat form at the back of his neck from the energy he was exerting, but to no avail. It wouldn’t fucking come.
And that- his five friends were pretty much the only people he had in his contacts. After that, there were just his favourite takeouts, his therapist, and-
With the grace of a ballet dancer, Tony watched as Steve slid into the driver’s seat and pouted, thinking it over for a second. “All parents are like that in the beginning,” he settled with, shrugging his shoulders, “we’re no different.”
Tony nodded, biting down on a small laugh as he pushed Steve back with a hand on his chest and leaned up to his tippytoes in order to lock their mouths together once more. “Adorable,” he said again, softly murmured into Steve’s mouth as his fingers snuck around to the back of his neck, “and
Steve frowned when he heard a roaring noise. It seemed out of place here. ‘Why not?’ He asked.
Steve smacked him on the chest with a scowl. “I hate you and I think you're insane,” he declared- not that Tony seemed to mind much; just lowered his hands to Steve’s elbows and then hauled him up into a sitting position.
“Mm, Barnes indeed” Steve turned back around and thrust a bowl of popcorn into Tony’s chest, “he’s calling it Bertha,” he said sadly, “and he made me apologise to it. I think I’ve been traumatised.”
“You actually are,” Tony nodded his head and fastened his seatbelt, “I told you to just give them the money. You would’ve fared a lot better if you had.”
For a second, Steve opened his mouth to scream at him. He wanted to. He wanted to scream that
Staring at the sea of open and vulnerable faces, looking up to him for advice, it swept over him with a horribly sort of realization. If he let the lesson go, then they’d not get an answer. And if they didn’t get an answer, then they could end up getting their ass beat in a relationship too. And Tony... maybe he could take it, but these kids?
Steve huffed, rolling over and sliding his arms around Tony’s waist. He pressed a soft kiss into Tony’s hair, and the man sighed happily, tucking himself further into Steve’s hold.
of November 2013, to be precise, because yes, that memory was permanently fixed into Steve’s mind), he was pretty sure that he hadn’t been able to take his eyes off Tony for the entire night while he’d played. Tony said it helped him concentrate and come up with new ideas, and had been proven right when, while midway through performing Beethoven’s Violin Sonata No.9, Tony had suddenly dropped the bow and then lurched over to his desk, completing the work that he’d been stressing over all night. At Steve’s count, Tony could play four instruments with ease: Violin, Piano, guitar and drums (usually only pulled out for stress relief or during the more manic nights), but in all honesty, Tony probably knew more. Just being the smartest person alive was not enough for that man- he had to be a brilliant musician, too.
want to hide it, Steve,” Tony’s voice was soft as he glanced back, “ever. I promise, that’s not what it was. But I- I just… it’s so complicated.”
, and that was a special kind of amazing that Steve had no idea he valued so much.
“Yeah, okay, so how the fuck do you think you’re gonna find him then, bright spark?” Bucky asked dryly, leaning against the frame of the door and shooting Steve an unimpressed look.
“Have you ever tried to stop Steve from fulfilling a task that would make you happy?” Bruce retorted quickly, “That door did not stand a chance.”
He grinned at the phone a second later, when Tony wrote
Tony looked panicked as he flicked his eyes around the room, landing on Steve just for a moment before slipping away immediately. “I- I- uh-“
But there was no way back now, and nothing to lose. So he might as well just dive right in and take what he wanted.
He said none of it. Instead, he just sat down slowly at Tony’s free side, sliding his hand onto Tony’s knee. Because everything else in the world could fucking wait—right now, Tony just needed someone to be there.
The journey home was fairly short, and by the end of it he was aching to step through the threshold and back into happiness. Going into the city for whatever reason these days was just… terrible. It was the only way to describe it. It was empty and dark, filled with the remains of a disaster that the world just didn’t have the manpower to clean up. Sometimes people recognised him, too. Sometimes they screamed, threw things, told him to go to hell. ‘We believed in you’, they’d hiss, and Steve couldn’t do anything except keep his head down and try to ignore it.
“You hurt him so badly that they’re saying he’s going to press charges, Steve.” Paul rubbed a hand over his hairless head, eyes screwing shut. “Buddy, we can’t afford to get you a lawyer. What… I don’t know what we’re gonna do.”
He shut his eyes and pushed the guilt down for a moment in order to scoop Tony up and begin carrying him out of the room, feeling the beautiful sense of familiarity and home that he’d been missing for weeks now.
“Mmm, I’m surprised too,” Tony mumbled, shooting him a weak smile as Rhodey hurried forward and got to his knees in front of Tony. His hand settled over Tony’s. “How’d I look, Platypus?”
Steve didn’t speak. He didn’t think he’d be able to bear putting the reality of it out there—that this was his fault. Instead, he just smoothed his hand back across Tony’s face and grabbed the new pile of clothes from the side.
“You really shouldn’t make a habit of getting your head stuck in things,” Tony laughed, and Steve knew he was thinking back to the terrible helmet-incident too, “what happens when you put on hats? Or have you just decided to never risk that?”
Steve eyed him. “Are you… serious?”
Blinking back to life a few moments later, Tony turned around and made a face, picking up the pillow and chucking it back at him. “I know it was a joke, obviously,” he said airily, although his eyes spoke otherwise as he wandered over to Steve’s side of the bed and then grabbed his phone from the nightstand.
Steve sighed. Tony looked over at him and opened his mouth, and Steve wondered if he had been about to backtrack- but no words ended up coming out, and so the old ones stuck. Yeah- Steve figured he'd probably been a source of amusement for Tony Stark since the very first meeting. Everything he had done since that had been slightly odd and most definitely not someone of Tony's status would ever engage in. Ice cream, Jesus- it even
"Don’t you think it’s so incredible? Literally, Steve,
, of course he would, and-
Steve just gave him a long look, stroking the hair from his eyes and letting his thumb linger across the outline of his cheekbone.
, I can’t-“
him. It was enough to make him want to run up to the rooftops and yell at anyone who would listen.
Steve glanced over at the machine, a frown creasing his face. He had no idea what it was- just looked like a pimped-up box to him, but he figured if it had the potential to go bang, it wasn’t as superficial as what Steve was seeing. He did note, after a second, that it seemed one of Tony’s fingers were pressed firmly into one side of the machine, and he hadn’t moved it since Steve had walked in. “I’m gonna go ahead and assume if you lift your hand, bad things will happen.”
Fuck, Steve had a maybe-probably-boyfriend. Tony was his maybe-probably boyfreind.
“It’s okay,” Tony began instantly, “Steve, it’s fine, I’m over it already, it’s just like any other fight-“
For a single second, he thought it might be cool if he got to rename it. Maybe he’d call it Anthony. Seemed like a good name for it.
Well. Tony would take a compromise when he saw one, obviously. He agreed to Steve’s terms, and soon they were caught up in each other on the couch while something explodey and loud played in front of them. Unfortunately thanks to the presence of Steve’s mother in the house, it couldn’t get past anything other than kissing, but that was more than enough to make Tony happy. He forgot about the movies after less than a few minutes, too busy trying to work out all the spots Steve was ticklish in while also refusing to be dislodged from Steve’s lap when they boy reacted to his wandering hands. It didn’t last long, of course—Steve’s Vampiric superstrength made flipping Tony onto the couch and pinning him down pretty much no problem at all, and soon it was Steve doing the tickling, a grin on his face and a slight pink tinge to his otherwise pale cheeks. Tony couldn’t even be mad at him for the horror movie thing. Or the relentless tickling. He was just too damn pretty.
Tony paused for a moment, eyes darting around the room—out to the window, where the rest of the world remained, sharp and harsh and unforgiving. Steve had checked that morning; everyone was still going nuts over the stupid video. If Tony went to work today, no doubt that would be all he’d get goddamn asked about. Steve didn’t want that for him—not ever, but especially not now. He deserved peace.
“No!” Steve shut his eyes and sat up off the floor, despite the pain it caused him, “no, I did not sleep with Tony fucking Stark. Yes, I am aware of how everything around him explodes spontaneously into flames or whatever the fuck you all seem to think happens. And no, he did not force, bribe or otherwise coerce me into following him.”
There was a mute nod, and when Tony stood up, he had to pull with all his weight to get Steve to follow. How Tony hadn’t noticed this sooner, he had no idea, but he wasn’t going to let it happen again. Steve was obviously completely exhausted, to the point where it was becoming
Shit.
Catching the look, Tony managed to smile. “We’ll finish when you get back,” he promised, “now go, save the world or whatever.”
“He’s an abuser, Mr. Wilson. I know the type. And he—he hurt Tony. Badly.” Steve bit his lip—it hurt. He realised it had been cut in the altercation. “I saw him and I just… lost it. I’m sorry. But I couldn’t stand seeing him walk around so casually. He tore Tony’s life apart like it was nothing to him.”
They walked through the corridors confidently and quietly, until Natasha veered off in the direction of the CCTV rooms. Steve had gone through his rushed plan with her already—she had a little pill that she would pop into a drink that she knew Joseph, the tecchie who worked the security room during nightshift, would like. In that pill was a concoction that would knock him out for an hour or two, and then wake him up later with no recollection of what had happened for the previous few hours he was awake. Steve didn’t want to ask why she happened to have a variety of sleeping pills and other drugs to hand in her apartment. It was easier to just let her keep her secrets. Either way, once she’d completed that part, she’d do her thing with the computers that would loop the feeds for long enough to get Steve where he needed to be without detection. He didn’t bother asking about that part either. Computer stuff had never been his forte.
He needed to find Natasha and yell at her. He was fast regretting the decision to introduce them to one another- God only knew what other terrible decisions they were going to make in future.
There was a moment of silence, and then Tony sighed. “Too fast?” He asked.
“Go away Sam,” He repeated, voice muffled by his still-damp pillow.
Was Bucky mocking him? Tony couldn’t tell. “Sorry,” he blurted on autopilot, just in case- and then felt worse when their smiles slipped and turned into confusion. “Sorry,” he said again, apologizing for apologizing that time, oh God
“Just returning this,” Steve pulled his bag off his shoulder and marched forward, digging his fingers into the opening and tugging at Tony’s jacket. He kept his eyes fixed on Tony’s as he shoved the thing into his chest, hard. “Sorry for being such an inconvenience to you these past few weeks,” he hissed quietly, voice stiff.
Tony looked at him, before just sighing and shaking his head. “It doesn’t matter, Steve-“
“He’s in the principal’s office again?” Steve sighed, and then remembered he was supposed to be mad at her and gave her an obligatory shove in the shoulder, “also, I do not approve of feeding my best friend copious amounts of vodka and then persuading him to buy a car. That’s what a lot of people call ‘morally wrong'.”
Again, he got a vague shrug. Tony took another lick of his icecream. “Howar- my Dad’s leaving for work tonight, so I’ll go back then. It’s no big deal.”
Tony groaned quietly in despair, eyes shutting as he grabbed Steve’s hands and then pulled them away from his jacket, a pout on his mouth. “I can, and I would very much
Steve paused for a second, debating the pros and cons of Bucky’s request. On one hand, he could possibly get charged with theft and various other crimes if he ended up in the passenger seat of a car Bucky may or may not have stolen- but on the other hand… it was Bucky.
He wasn’t going to just sit here and watch his life slip away from him because of some stupid HYDRA conditioning. If Bucky could break out of it, so could he. Exposure therapy. That had to work. Or at least, he was going to make it work. The brain automatically took the path of least resistance. And Tony was the most stubborn, resisting bastard his brain knew- it’d just open his memories back up in order to alleviate the agonizing pain.
managed to seriously injure Tony, so what the hell must he have done this time, now that he hadn’t been holding back at all—
God. They were probably yelling at each other right now- over Peter himself this time, which might mean it was his fault if they split up, if this was the argument that set everything in motion,
As the days passed, Tony only became more and more determined to give Steve the perfect proposal. He focused any pent-up energy and lingering anxieties on the challenge, charting up data and running through ring blueprint after ring blueprint until he’d gotten it down to three solid ideas. Steve probably thought he was working, and yeah, perhaps for half an hour or so every few days he was indeed checking up with Pepper to see if the launch had gone smoothly and such, but most of the time he was calling up restaurants and booking tables or texting Bruce and debating whether it would be feasible to get ahold of point-four grams of Vibranium from Wakanda, depending on how hard he batted his eyelashes at the king. He was pretty certain he wanted it to be Vibranium, after all- and if worst came to worst, he could always synthesize some more. He’d just have to get Steve away for a little while so he wouldn’t notice the workshop getting turned into a bombsite—
Howard’s voice got quieter, and Steve felt the hairs on the back of his neck stand up on end,
He looked at Tony through his blurry vision. The man’s face was pale and sickly, interspersed with blues and greens and browns from various bruises, and his lip was uneven, swollen from the split that cracked down across the right hand side of his mouth. He looked heaven-sent to Steve, though.
When he’d managed to take out all his pent-up frustrations on the bag in front of him, he quickly took a shower and then slipped back downstairs, going over to the couch and picking up his sketchbook. He’d draw for a little while, then try find Tony again, have another discussion – this one hopefully a little calmer.
Steve softened and moulded himself around Tony’s form, cheek pressing into the other man’s hair. He could feel Tony go still against him, ear pressing closer into Steve’s chest in what was clearly an attempt to hear his heartbeat, and Steve was happy to indulge him for a little while. “Sandra asked if we could milk the cows while we’re staying over,” he mumbled, before adding, “that’s the farmer’s name, by the way. Sandra and Owen. They were real nice to me.”
Bruce had also gotten a suspension. Nat, Clint and Sam were all in detention for the next few weeks.
He was quiet as he slipped around the armrest and then slid to his knees in front of Tony’s face, hand slowly rising to stroke softly across Tony’s cheek, into the thick hair. Curled up like that; Tony seemed so small, so vulnerable, and it made a burst of protectiveness and sheer, pure love erupt in Steve’s heart. He found often after particularly trying Ops, that he became a little more attached to Tony, if only for a few days. Those sort of things just… made a guy think. Remember exactly what he had to lose.
Pops didn’t say anything, but he started moving across the room, and then sat down on the edge of the bed. They were both quiet for a while, and it was obvious that his Pops was trying to think of something to say.
“You’re so weird,” Tony said, before kicking off the brake and revving the engine. Steve cackled, feeling the pull in his stomach as Tony drove out of the parking lot with his engine growling loudly.
He cleared his throat as he stepped up to Tony's side, and Tony turned to him. "So," Steve asked, eyes sticking on the kid as he slowly got lost in the crowds, "what was that about?"
Pushing his shoulder against the door of the conference room, Steve pulled the trolley inside and then wheeled it over to a corner. There was no lock on the door, he realised—but that would be okay. Rapping a knuckle against the lid of the trash compartment, Steve informed Tony he was free to leave the confines of the trash. “Are you sure this is going to work?” He asked, helping Tony’s fragile body out and balancing him as he swayed. “What if the signal extends out of the building as well as into it and your arms can’t link up to your suit?”
“FUCK!” He yelled, head turning in search of the voice before the tone registered in the back of his mind and he frowned, “wait- JARVIS, is that you?”
Tony didn’t hold himself to quite the same standards, however, as he took Steve’s hand and slipped it over his crotch, pressing his fingers downward against the tent in his pants. Steve’s breath hitched again. “I’ll let you work that one out,” Tony said with a grin, before leaning down and licking into Steve’s mouth. “You know where the bedroom is.”
Steve looked around at them. “I don’t know,” he said, and he felt numb when he heard the words, “I really… just don’t know.”
His legs propelled him through the thick snow faster than any normal human could go, following the general direction of the noise further up the mountain. A minute later and there was another smattering of bullets, quickly followed by what sounded like return fire. It was still faint, but growing louder with every step Steve took. Five, maybe six miles, give or take.
“You think I don’t see the way you tense up when I walk up behind you?” Steve whispered, something so completely broken in his eyes that Tony thought he was going to cut himself on the edges, “you think I don’t notice how you’re constantly apologizing to me? You don’t even realise you’re doing it, Tony. I…
He gritted his teeth and looked down. “Doesn’t give him the right to try and control my entire life,” he muttered angrily.
And, of course, barely a second later they were pillow fighting in the middle of the living room whilst Sam sighed and attempted to break it up. This signaled the end to any homework attempts, obviously- and they all accepted their fate ten minutes later when they packed the books back into their bags. Mrs. Wilson probably wouldn’t be too happy at the fact that both her boys had landed themselves with about five different detentions, but that was the nature of school, wasn't it?
The first time Steve actually punched Tony, it was because he’d been pushing something he shouldn’t have. Really, he was the one to blame there.
“Is this it?” Tony asked, bouncing up and down on his seat as he craned his neck to look around the bend like an excited child, and Steve couldn’t help but chuckle as he nodded his head. “Oh, it looks all… serene. Nice. You’ve got good taste, Rogers, I’ll give you that.”
It was stupid and he knew it. This wouldn’t help anyone. Wouldn’t make anything better or absolve him of any blame if he listened to it. Were his therapist here right now, she would currently be telling him to do the exact opposite, probably. Talk to him about unhealthy thought patterns and his tendency to put all the responsibility on his shoulders when he didn’t need to.
Immediately, the living room burst into action, everyone jumping to their feet and brimming with excitement at the prospect of a night spent watching the play be performed on stage.
“This is not about you two right now,” he told them sharply, “this is about Peter. What are we going to do now? Him being superhuman is going to change how social services take on his case, right?”
The roof of the tower was brisk with wind, and he shivered as he glared at the suit that was stood on the tower. It hurt to look at, but he’d almost gotten used to the pain by that point. He could get through it pretty easily now.
After the shoes had been removed and placed neatly against the couch, he spared one last longing glance over to Tony and then straightened up and checked his watch.
“It really is.”
Steve completely ignored him, however, simply choosing to advance until he was merely a few feet away. Tony cursed and knocked his suitcase into Steve’s shins, stumbling backward at the same time- but Steve barely even noticed it, merely kicking it to the side with such force that the thing concaved in on itself,
“Really?” He asked, blinking rapidly.
Steve stared at her chipped nail for a moment, before deciding that her offer was better than nothing and then extending his own. They shook solemnly before Natasha dropped it and grabbed Clint by the arm. “Come on, Barton,” she told him, “we need to go tell Miss Price why we didn’t give in our Math homework.”
Steve rolled his eyes. “We’ll evaluate the situation when we get into the kitchen and see what it is, alright?”
Steve nodded once, snatching the letter back off the desk. “Where’s he being held?”
go around hitting people for the sake of food.
Steve sighed but said nothing, bumping their shoulders together. “Thank you,” he said earnestly, “and for the record, I’m sorry for snapping at you yesterday. I didn’t mean-“
The grin slid off Tony’s face, and was replaced with an involuntary scowl. “I told you, Steve- kid prodigy, I never liked any of that stuff-”
“Just you is fine, sweetheart,” he whispered, before taking Tony’s mouth in a kiss, “all I need is you.”
Tony’s mouth dropped. That wasn’t… “I just—” he began, but suddenly everything he wanted to say fell flat on his tongue. It sounded stupid.
He was useful. He stayed out of their way, but he stayed useful, and that was enough.
it was going to be dangerous, and he’d let Steve go on his own anyway. “How far out, J?”
“Looking for you,” Ty answered equally airily, but Steve could tell the tension in the air immediately, “you’ve been disappearing a lot lately. You still owe Sunset a pack of cigarettes, you know. You said you’d get them for her next time you went out back.”
“He’s going to fly straight off the rails,” Steve finished quietly, thinking back to when he’d first met Tony, and he and Bucky and Peggy had gone searching his name on the internet. He could still see the headline that they’d dug up; a fuzzy image of the boy Steve loved, barely even 15, lying unconscious on a table surrounded by partying strangers. The arrest records, the drug charges, God, they couldn’t let Tony go down that road again.
“I think we got them all,” Bruce told him, wheezing in a short breath as he shuffled upright and turned to Tony, looking him over. “There were about fifteen of them. Nat and Rhodey went out and picked off most of them. I took the four that managed to get through the door.” He turned to Steve. “Are they still alive?”
The night passed him by in a blur, spent talking to neuroscientists and going back through all the notes they had on Bucky and his HYDRA programming. The next time he looked up, it was 7am and Steve was knocking on his door with a sandwich and a concerned expression. “Have you even been to sleep?” He asked as soon as Tony buzzed him in.
“Nat, for the last time, you know what I’m like. I… I can’t talk to women! This is useless, come on!”
Tony backed up as Steve took another step forward, his thighs hitting the side of the desk. “I do what the fuck I want,” he said, his voice angry and his lip curled, showing bravery he really wasn’t feeling.
He wasn’t going to be stupid this time. He was prepared, see.
“Tony I swear, it’s fine,” Steve patted him on the chest and looked up, eyes sparkling in amusement at Tony’s despairing face, “no one is calling homeland security. JARVIS apologized. He even says he likes me, so I’m counting this as a success. Now can we go and buy food?”
The man glanced up, and Tony threw the little block at him. Steve, of course, caught it- and then immediately dropped it when he felt the slimy texture. Tony just smiled. “Choking hazard,” he explained, once more turning back to Peter. “Don’t eat plastic. It’s bad for you.”
Tony looked down at his hands; tapping incessantly against his knees, and pointedly did not look at Steve. He wished he had just lied- said it was because he thought it was lame, or never enjoyed running around as a little kid, or just
were different. Steve wasn’t abusing him. He was just.... stress relieving. On Tony’s face. Yeah. Anyway- Tony had seen what Steve did to the
, for Christ’s sake. What else was he hiding? What else was there to the boy who’d caught his eye on the very first day and never really let go since?
, Bertha I’m sorry I accidentally broke a piece of your shit body off. Happy now?”
“This is an intervention,” he began, before tony cut him off.
According to the SHIELD speaker system which gave them all a handy overview, The Villains of The Day were using some sort of sonic device among the usual machine guns as their chosen weapon, and there appeared to be about 30 of them, all dropping on to the helicarrier from a small aircraft up above.
“Pr’b’y n’t,” Sam attempted to say, shrugging indifferently. When he swallowed, though, he went back to looking at Steve with slight concern. “You feel better now, though, right? I know you were having a tough week.”
“You didn’t think anyone would care about looking after you, you mean,” Steve adds, stopping his fussing for a moment to stroke a hand through Tony’s hair and get it out from his face. “Tony- I know about your list. I’ve known for months- you left the hard copies out on your desk one night when I came in to put you to bed. It… God, Tony, you care so much about everyone else, but you don’t expect them to care for you back, do you? You didn’t add your own triggers or fears or history in there. You didn’t… you didn’t think they were relevant. So I made my own file for you- granted, mine wasn’t quite so fancy as yours- but I’m so very glad that I did. You need people to show that they care about you just as much as you care about them.”
What would a good man do?
He smelt the metallic tang that came with a grenade explosion, saw light cascade in front of his eyes, heard the screaming of people falling to gunfire. For a second, he thought that maybe he could save Peggy this time—maybe now he knew what might happen, he’d be able to reach her, push her out of the way before the IED went off—
Rolling immediately to his feet, his head shot up, eyes wild as he threw himself forward mere seconds after falling to the floor. His wrist cried in pain, and Steve assumed he’d injured it when he’d stuck the landing, but again, it wasn’t important.
Steve had been the first to hear it. Sat in Tony’s workshop in the compound, drawing like he always had and pretending everything was normal, he’d suddenly realised that there was the faintest little beeping noise coming from somewhere around Tony’ desk. FRIDAY was still online, but she no longer operated any of the equipment in Tony’s workshop, so Steve assumed something must have started malfunctioning. He looked up and waited for the beeping to stop.
“I-“ Steve began, but Jan shook her head and waved him off with a flick of her hand.
Then he dialled Fury’s number.
Probably.
Seemingly sensing his tension, Steve sighed and kissed his temple reassuringly. “You don’t have to do this tonight,” he murmured against Tony’s skin, “we have time. Another one of us could do it instead—”
is he,” he growled, hand going to the car-door and clicking it open, “Steve, I swear to fucking God, what did he do to y-“
“Thirty-eighth floor west side.  Non-code compliant smoking balcony,” Stark told him.
Beyond the door, a large, round security desk waited, manned by two hulking cave troll-sized Alphas doing their best to avoid eye contact with Tony.  Good to know that the contingency plan of the government’s top spy agency for an infiltration by Omegas was literally just looking the other way, Tony thought with a flash of annoyance.  He didn’t have time for this. Steve was here, somewhere, and there had been an
humor is bad?” Steve objected.  “You have never met a terrible pun you didn’t love.”
Heat dripped into Tony’s belly as if poured through a sieve.  A burgeoning pressure came behind it in little waves that lapped against the inside of his stomach, then dipped lower.  Steve’s cock, already hard and full, rubbed against his own.  The friction hurt and felt good, making his vision white out for a moment while his brain tried to decide how to handle the dueling impulses.  His muscles went loose, quivering a bit at the sudden sensation.  A warm rush of slick coated his ass and the tops of his thighs.  Steve’s nostrils flared.  Blotches of red dotted over his skin.  Tony licked his lips and watched Steve’s eyes follow the motion.
Tony would be okay. Steve bet his fucking life on it.
When he glanced back at them, they were looking at him in confusion. He saluted them lazily, and let his eyes slip away- noting Tony watching him again as he did so. Only for a second, because then Steve had turned around once more, but in the fraction of a moment their eyes had met, Steve noticed the frown creased on his forehead. God only knew what he was thinking- it seemed like sort of a mess up in that head- and Steve just let it slide in the end. He kept his eyes firmly facing the path in front of him and refused to turn around even once.
Thor looked back at him. “We do what we can here,” he said with a nod, “the concussion is the most dangerous injury, so we have to monitor it accordingly. Falling asleep will be okay, but we’re gonna need to wake him up periodically to check on him. I don’t think it’s his wrist that’s hurt, now I’ve looked a little better—but it’s a dislocated shoulder, so we’re gonna have to set it back in place for him.”
“I think we’ve lost ‘em, Brucie,” Steve heard Natasha say, her voice somewhere between exasperated and amused. Steve was too busy thinking about how Tony was slowly starting to grind on him to apologise to them, and quite frankly, he didn’t even have the heart to feel guilty about it.
And then, not looking back, he swiftly exited the room.
“I know, I know!” Tony sat up suddenly and then shuffled around, crossing his legs and leaning forward on his elbows as his fingers interlocked underneath his chin. He looked up at Steve with his stupid puppy eyes, and Steve just rolled his own when Tony started to pout. “It’s all a part of my charm.”
Tony sighed, looking down at the kid. "Please shut up," he said in his nicest voice, "please please
He happily drifted back into unconsciousness for a moment, letting his head fall against the floor that he’d been wishing to swallow him whole a few hours ago. It was comfy there- or at least, comfier than sitting up and rolling back into bed.
Oh god, he should have known this was coming. He should have done more. They were going to take Peter and they were going to do God knows what and it was all his fault. And now he needed to think, needed to
Because that… that had hurt. He hadn’t overthought that- what Tony had implied had been clear.
He shook his head and hurled the last motorsled-engine onto the pile. It wasn’t worth worrying over now. He would do it when they got back home. And that was fucking promise.
On the other end of the fort, Tony and Bruce were engaged in what sounded like a highly scientific conversation, talking about carbohydrate levels and the sweet/ savory balance of a topping. Steve, meanwhile, was teaming up with Peggy and choosing to use guerrilla warfare in order to subdue Clint- the constant barrage of peanut shells at his head was going to wear him down soon, and when it did, team Pineapple-Should-Die would be victorious-
Bingo.
“Yeah, but I just…” Tony blinked and looked up at the ceiling, smiling bashfully as he waved a hand around the room, “I just want to tell you again. You do
“That is a trashcan,” the other man hissed, “I am not—”
Steve looked at him, unimpressed. “If you think I’m just gonna stand around and let him treat me like shit until he eventually gets bored of doing that, you got another thing coming, buddy.”
“Come on Steve, before the sun sets completely,” Tony’s eyes crinkled at the edges as he smiled and tugged Steve further out, walking backward in order to face him. Steve let himself be led, and then held out a hand for the helmet as Tony threw it his way and slipped his own on.
“Not in baby-care! What if he…” Bruce made a face, “what if he pees on me?”
18 days in, and they got a distress signal.
Tony snapped his head back to the pair in surprise, watching as Clint’s face contorted into one of delight and he punched the air triumphantly. Peter was smiling up at Bruce and clapping his hands together as best he could while Bruce nodded and confirmed, in his usual manner, “Yes, that’s me, Bruce Banner at your service.”
Which didn’t make much sense-
As a general rule, Steve did not switch his work-phone off. It was emergency-only, so it was rarely used anyway, and when it was, SHIELD tended to call during normal working hours; you know, 9 to 5, that sort of thing. Sometimes he got one or two a bit later in the night, although that was because of immediate assistance being needed to deal with situations. Never one past midnight though; not in the year or so that Steve had been working for the organisation.
“I need to speak to Reed,” was all he said, praying desperately that the man was here, “now.”
needed to. So Steve was channelling his inner Exhausted Janitor, and he was doing a stand-up fucking job of it, thank you very much. Agents passed by him hurriedly, not even noticing as he wheeled between them, and Tony remained thankfully silent the whole time, so no suspicion was even aroused as Steve slowly worked his way up to the third floor. By this time, the agent manning the desk on the underground level would have undoubtedly informed the team sent to check on the holding cells that a blond man had escorted Tony Stark from the floor a few minutes previously, and a search was about to be very quickly organised in order to find the two fugitives.
But he had to, really.
There was a resounding crash from somewhere- possibly the hull, and Tony groaned again. “They’re
“Of survival or death?”
Steve wiped his nose against his sleeve hastily and then pulled his concentration back to the matter at hand. He wasn’t going to waste his thoughts on Howard fucking Stark, not when the man’s son was currently bleeding out in front of him. “Hold still baby,” he whispered as he pressed a sticky gauze pad against the largest cut on Tony’s forehead once he’d finished with the butterfly stitches. Tony winced when the pressure was placed on his head, but he followed Steve’s orders.
“Sorry about the coffee,” he parted with sweetly, before turning around without another look back, headed for the vending machines in the corner of the room. He let himself give Ty a little wave and then smiled in grim satisfaction.
“Pretty sure half the team can’t even make it. Are you okay?”
Steve pulled away, irritated. It seemed everyone had decided they knew what was best for him, all of a sudden. Even, apparently, Tony fucking Stark. “You don’t have a clue about me.”
“Jarvis had been driving her out to pick me up from school,” Tony continued, and Steve heard the way his voice flattened out; felt the tremble in his fingers. “They wouldn’t have… I didn’t even need to, not really- could’ve walked. Could’ve got a lift. But I- we were supposed to spend the day together and I just thought-“
Steve couldn’t help it. His breath caught in his throat automatically, Tony yet again taking his breath away in the same way he managed to do every time Steve set eyes on him.
Steve paused, turning to look at him for a few moments. He didn’t say anything, and neither did Tony. They both knew what the other was thinking, after all. Then, slowly, Steve’s hand came up and reached for Tony’s, and he smiled softly. “Thank you,” was all he said before he slid from the chair and allowed Tony to take his place. He dropped down and pressed a kiss to the top of Tony’s head and then ambled off in the direction of the microwave. Tony was left looking at Peter and his horrendously messy face as the boy stared up at him. His fingers were covered in orange-brown mush.
“You what?” Steve turned to her rapidly, eyes widening, but she just shrugged and drew a figure of eight on the table, flicking her hair out of her face.
“Why is everyone so convinced he’s so fucking awful, Jesus Christ!” Steve burst, hands flying through the air in irritation, “you don’t even know him, Buck! None of you do! Not even me!  All I’ve got on him is that he’s apparently the type of guy to leave a party hours early to drive my stupid ass home! So for God’s sake, could you all just quit it?”
, I suppose.” He felt his cheeks heat and pursed his lips. It sounded so childish when he said it aloud.
“Why are you… what?” He asked, words still sitting thick in his mouth as his brain attempted to boot itself back up from its night of sleep. “Rhodey, why are you here?”
“You say it like a joke, but that would probably make me feel better, yes,” Steve admitted, laughing a little when Tony batted him lightly and shook his head.
He looked back at JARVIS, nodding imperceptibly. “Yeah,” he said.
She paused for a moment, and then sighed. He’d said something along those lines every other time she’d attempted to speak to him. And it had been three days, by his count. She had to be getting bored of it by now.
“Nope,” he warned himself, pushing the thought out as he turned his back and slipped back through the doors. “Don’t even fucking go there, Steve.”
“What happened to her?” Tony asked, voice gentle, and they were still standing together on the middle of the pavement, which felt weird- felt like they needed a more serious setting to have this conversation, yet here they both were.
_____
pay, actually,” Tony dived in and stole a chip from his plate before he even had time to counter, and then threw it into his mouth with a wry grin. “So just keep the money and leave me be.”
There was a crackling noise, and then Thor’s booming voice came over the intercom. “Steve!” He cheered, whilst a few other voices joined in the chorus. “Come on up, I’m on the top floor.”
when he’d first laid his eyes on the boy over the parking lot on his first day of school.
“That is not a snack, Peter,” dad said, because unfortunately he was good at reading Peter’s mind like that. “That’s like, a full meal. We’re having dinner in an hour, are you serious-”
“This wasn’t just some overglorified excuse for you to go out and have a smoke, was it?”
, and it terrified me so much that I couldn’t even move, and he stabbed me. I… I can’t keep doing this.” He shook his head, defeated as he slumped against the fridge. “I just can’t. It’s killing me.”
Tony was ashamed of him.
he thought, feeling a tear slip down his cheek as he hefted his shield for the last time,
Two rapid blinks, and the thought was removed swiftly from his head, shoved back down into the drawer he’d stuffed it in since the whole debacle had occurred. 52 beats-per-minute was fine, and that was all Tony needed to know. He looked back down at his work and then signed off another paper, taking in a long breath and trying to keep his eyes firmly open. It’d been two, maybe three days since his last full sleep. He’d most just been living off naps and short rests, but that was it. He knew he was going to have to give in and go to bed properly soon, but he was just… busy, currently. That was all.
“Please don’t, Tony,” he said, shaking his head, “whatever you’re about to say, I don’t… just leave it. I’m fine.”
“No, I’m… I don’t mean it like it was just you making a dumb decision on the field- although it was dumb. Very, very dumb,” Steve said with an unhappy intake of breath, finally looking Tony in the eye, “but it’s not about that. This is about you being hurt and me… me being hurt because you’re in pain. Because that’s always what happens. You get injured and I just… I go nuts, okay,  I
start crying through fucking exposure.
There was only one person capable of all that.
Steve smiled, then looked back to Tony. “Are you sure you’re going to be okay?” He asked.
He was man enough to admit he screamed a little. He
"it's true," Clint waved a hand over to her and shrugged again, "also, Nat, new info- I think I'm a prostitute."
“Hey, Jay.”
“I do not experience feelings of claustrophobia,” JARVIS told him as Steve gingerly picked up the computer. It was heavy, and his arms strained to lift it, but he managed. “Although I must admit, this is one of the less sophisticated exteriors that I have possessed. Due to the nature of Tony’s hasty download, he did not get the chance to open up my system and allow me to expand my reach to any other devices as I am used to doing. It was a straight transfer from his home system to this computer. The base codes that make me the AI I am were transferred, nothing more. I suppose, in human terms, I do feel somewhat… trapped.”
He’s… he’s pretty much
She didn’t say anything, and for a moment he wondered whether she was thinking of a counter-argument, a plea for him to let it go. But she didn’t. Instead, she shuffled a little closer and rested the side of her head onto his shoulder. “Do you remember when the whole team got arrested in Japan that one time?” She said—and the memory was so out of place and surprising that it made Steve burst into an unexpected laugh.
Steve was struck dumb by the weight of Tony’s words, mouth simply hanging open like it was the only thing his face knew how to do. Tony was looking up at the ceiling, and even in the halflight Steve could see the faint flush on his sharp cheeks, the nervous tap of his fingers. Emotions were dangerous to Tony. But he was letting them out anyway. For Steve.
Steve chuckled wetly. He must look a fucking mess right about now. “No. I don’t want to use drugs to solve my problems.”
“Get out,” he told Steve harshly, jerking a thumb behind him, “you’re not authorised to be in here.”
sort of talk. Probably not his best, that was for sure.
“STEVE!” Sam called again, “
to never try and use your reactor for anything other than its designated use in your chest. You didn’t listen to me either.” His gaze flicked down with a small frown, hovering over the light in Tony’s chest. He swallowed. “It looked horrible,” he admitted, “so empty. Where your heart was supposed to be, where the light… it was just black.”
And then he was off again, crouching down with Natasha and waving a finger toward one of the rafters in the ceiling. Tony simply watched, breaths shallow, vision hazy. He couldn’t move. Could barely even talk.
Tony shrugged, pouting a little as he arched up into Steve’s touch, hands wrapping around his neck and mouth finding Steve’s. “Does this mean,” he whispered in between kisses, “crazy morning s-”
So sue him, but Steve didn’t end up feeling all that assured by it.
They both got ready quickly- or at least, as quickly as they could manage whilst in the company of one another and wearing minimal amounts of clothes. So all things considered, an hour was pretty good.
Eh. He’d cross that bridge when he got to it.
“I did not risk my fucking
Steve did; feet scrambling against the wall as he raised himself higher- and then there were hands at the material on his shoulders, pulling him up easily by the jacket, wow, Tony was
God. Okay. No. Concentrate on the popcorn, Steve thought to himself hurriedly, shaking the thoughts from his mind. “Please don’t say you’ve got a name for her too. I’m not ready to deal with two of you.”
“Of course,” Tony nodded and then, using all the willpower he could muster, pulled away and turned back to the trousers now lying across his desk. He yanked them on hastily and then picked up the buckle, looping it through the holes with slightly shaky hands. Caffeine deprivation, that was what it was- he just needed a triple espresso to wake him up and he’d be raring to go. “How do I look?”
“I…” Tony started, and Steve turned to him just in time to watch him forcefully relax himself, breaking into a grin and a careless wave of his hand. He didn’t look at Steve. “Yeah, sure. I’ll be there.”
get in the trash!” Tony yanked the janitor’s cap off Steve’s head and then stuck it on his own. “I’ll be the janitor, you get in the wheelie-bin.”
“You’re going to lie, aren’t you?” Steve interrupted before he could bother, and he wasn’t even angry, really- just confused as hell. Tony always made him
Later, Steve would ask how the hell he and Natasha managed to take down an entire squad of HYDRA soldiers and not end up mortally wounded or dead. Until then, though, Steve would simply have to settle himself with being mildly terrified of the prospect of ever getting on either of their bad sides.
His eyes burned and his muscles jumped with energy—he didn’t want to stop, there was too much; rage, too much
He stared blankly at Loki before turning away. “Just drive, please,” he said blankly. He didn’t have the energy to engage in a debate with Thor’s lost little brother.
This was not a boy you wanted to get on the wrong side of.
He woke up and it hurt.
He staggered back, the wind making a hissing noise as Steve’s fingers whipped through the air. He lifted a hand to cover his cheek and then sent out another one to steady his body against the counter. It stung with sharp pain; sharper than a normal slap would. Then again, it was Steve. He was stronger than just a normal slap.
Steve—if this was Steve, of course—had just killed what looked to be nearly fifty men. Without a single weapon.
They were silent for a few rather awkward moments, until Steve blurted “thank you. I wanted to… but then you weren’t at school and… yeah. For Saturday. It was real good of you to take me home. I’m sorry for ruining you night.”
“Oh no, I know already that this is going to be a stupid thing you’re about to say,” Bucky sighed as he slammed the door shut, turning around to Steve and popping his collar against the cold wind, “Stevie, buddy, I love you, but if you’re going to try and convince me to do something dumb again, I’ve gotta tell you, it’s not happening. It’s too cold and there’s pizza inside-“
He stared up at the ceiling, and couldn’t help but be glad about it, in a roundabout sort of way. Yeah, he was going to hate himself in the morning- but damn, did it make a nice change from doing nothing all day and then heading to bed at six.
“Yes,” Steve bit irritably. He was an idiot, maybe, but he wasn’t a fucking child- he could handle a bit of noise.
Steve just stared.
“Tony!” One of them yelled, hurrying forward. She was wearing a huge fur… thing, and ridiculous pink heels as she scurried over and threw her arms around him, embracing him in a hug that he returned with a laugh. “Tony, what a surprise! Sweetie, it’s been so long! Months and months- God, when was the last time-“
Gently, Steve pulled Tony away from the window and over to the bed. “Let’s just relax,” he said softly, “forget about it. It’s over. You’re safe, and he’s gonna be in jail for a long fuckin’ time. It’s gonna be okay.”
His eyes narrowed, and he turned down his head. What was he wearing? Jacket- just some thing he’d bought from Target a few months ago, nothing expensive. Shoes- he looked down at the scruffy trainers and cleared them off the list. The only thing he had with him was the backpack he’d taken with him to help carry the pizzas back. Chances were they weren’t going to make a move on him anyway- they seemed otherwise occupied. But preparing for the worst was just a habit, by that point. He’d been too used to getting caught off-guard by those types of people.
But he’d told Steve, with such fire and conviction in his voice, that he
Another smack, and he heard Tony’s quiet plea, the
“So,” Clint interrupted Steve’s train of thought in his usual Clint Way, and when he looked over in Steve’s direction, Steve just sighed and prepared for something undoubtedly stupid and/or terrible to fall from his friend’s mouth.
"Well- I should probably go back," Steve pushed an unenthusiastic hand back in the direction of the cafeteria, and he watched Tony look horribly, awfully sad for a moment, before the usual face slipped back on and he just shrugged indifferently.
“That’s
It was an awful day.
It’s us. We can get through anything.”
I’m not crazy, I promise, just really… really tired.”
Tony bent down, kissing his forehead softly. “They can look out for themselves. Seriously- how many times have both me and Bucky ‘died’? We’re nightmares, honestly, it’s a wonder you keep us around, I’m pretty sure we’ve been cursed.”
“Love is difficult, is it not?” He asked quietly, looking back down at Steve. There was a weary smile on his face as he let go and then started to walk forward, following after the others. “I’m gonna go after them. Need to make sure my brother's not… doing something stupid. I’ll see you 'round, guys.”
(Someone else does, though.)
A second later, and the room was deathly quiet again, only Steve’s heavy breathing permeating the room. He was dizzy, shaking. His mouth tasted like blood, and he wasn’t sure whether it was psychosomatic or whether he’d just torn through this lip.
Steve grinned. “Should’ve called earlier- I mean, I
Steve opened and shut his mouth a few times, before jerkily nodding and beginning to move his feet of his own accord. When he got to the foot of the steps, Tony chucked the helmet over to him and then climbed on the front. “You ever ridden before?”
“Are we taking your bike?” Steve asked, the tinge of excitement filling his voice as they both made their way down the corridor and into the kitchen, where Tony opened the door and then stepped outside. THe look on his face told Steve he knew exactly what he was thinking.
“Since when did Tony regulate people’s alcohol intake?” Jane asked, leaning back and smiling innocently.
He heard Clint mutter something about going back and checking out what was left of the armour, and Natasha informed them she’d start searching through the storage, leaving just Steve and Tony standing in the corridor, forehead to forehead as Tony frantically wracked his brains. He refused to acknowledge the panic. It wasn’t going to help. Instead, he focused on Steve. The way his back was hunched. How his hands were soft against Tony’s skin, but lined with insurmountable tension that showed he was holding so much back. The way his breathing hitched up and down, like he couldn’t even stop it. If Tony didn’t think of something, Steve was going to start trying to punch his way through the steel-enforced walls.
“He’s there, Steve. He’s okay,” Bucky repeated quietly, voice laced with sadness as he looked down at Steve.
“Desirable?” Tony had helped drily, and Bruce had just nodded.
“I don’t think this is a Hulk situation,” Thor said, “we can deal with this alone.”
“Sit,” Tony said, pushing Steve onto a barstool. He glanced upward. “JARVIS, lockdown protocol.”
Sam pulled a face and clutched his plate up to his chest. “You’ve done them for the past five nights, man. Even I can admit it’s my turn, you just go back upstairs and text your boyfriend. Yes, we both know you’ve already been doing that for the past ten minutes. Normal people don’t have to stifle laughter when they look at their own crotch.” Sam winked wryly and tugged Steve’s own plat out of his hand.
“Motherfuck,” Steve responded with bluntly, a hand reaching shakily to his head, “mother
JARVIS must have thought Steve had been thinking of going to the man responsible. Admittedly, it had crossed his mind. Just walking in and snapping his neck. Or maybe making it hurt more, making him scream, pulling the pain out of his own chest and forcing it into the man who had created it.
“Oh, that wasn’t even us being intimidating,” Pepper said absently, turning another smile on, “you should see us when we’re talking to a real shitwipe. It gets scary.”
Steve laughed and grabbed Tony’s wrists as they came out of his shirt and then pushed the money back in Steve’s direction. He grappled with the idiot for a few seconds, before Tony won out and pushed him backward, grabbing both his wrists and holding them down as he shoved the note unceremoniously into the pocket of Steve’s-
He turned his head sharply, gaze locking with Tony’s. He’d thought the other man was asleep, but at some point he’d woken up and started to look at the same phone that Steve was, full of all the bullshit from the past few days. The pinched look had returned to his eyes. “I know you don’t think it’s my fault,” he continued quietly, “but it doesn’t make this any easier for you. I don’t… I just hate putting you through this shit. It’s not fair you have to deal with my problems.”
God. Usually Tony had to worry about the state of his
“Thank you for accepting my apology.”
“I’m trying to take your hand,” Steve answered, “but I’m having some difficulty locating it.”
“I…” Steve began, voice hoarse, unsteady. “Tony—”
bruh im sorry this took so long, but!!!! it is here now, and I made it extra long to make up for the wait!
Peggy knew that too, because her smile was impossibly large as he leaned in, unable to resist another hug. “I’m glad,” she whispered in his ear before pulling away, grabbing her coat from the rail and backing up a few steps, “and also jealous. I’m now the only one in this room who’s single. I feel like a social outcast.”
Zeke eyed them both up, his gaze malicious. Steve wanted to hit him so fucking bad. “You got a thing for the new guy, Stark?” He asked softly, his voice dangerous as his gaze flickered back to Steve, just for a moment before he returned to Tony, “that’s interesting.”
Waking up the hospital bed a few hours later, the first thing Steve saw was Bucky.
Tony thinks that’s what he loves most about Steve. Those hands can tear through walls and punch men dead- but Tony only ever feels them as a gentle caress. Steve is even softer and careful than most normal humans, and it must be so much harder to do for him. And yet he always manages.
of them. Peter was having to stay for hours, when he should have been getting home to help his Aunt run their cafe. So he was getting into shit at home, too, 'cause his Aunt was getting angry and grounding him, and... yeah. It was just a mess," Tony shook his head again, jaw clenched. "Idiot should have just told me sooner, Jesus," he muttered to himself.
Steve just shut his eyes in despair, trying not to flinch as Fury started to yell. Tony was right.
He couldn’t help but glance to the left for a second, over to Heather as he said “you still coming to mine on Saturday, right?” softly, leaning up and curling his hand around Tony’s forearm.
Steve thought, sending it out into nothingness and wishing that Tony could pick it up,
They leaned against one another for a few moments; Steve’s head fitted perfectly into the crook of Tony’s shoulder. Eventually however, when Steve yawned massively, he decided to call it a night. Standing up with bleary eyes, he pressed his hand against Tony’s face and then kissed him once more. It still hurt his nose, but it was worth it.
Tony didn’t answer for a moment, and he wavered dangerously, like his legs were seconds from giving out. Since meeting him all those years ago, he’d barely aged a day. Steve- Steve had developed laugh lines and a few silver hairs, but… well, demons took their power from other beings, and stayed forever young. Angels shouldn’t have aged as quickly as Steve had, either, but he figured that’s what happened when you spent all your time in the company of someone who naturally sucked away your life force.
Tony thought vaguely, falling on to all fours as he gagged up the phantom water that he could feel crawling up his throat.
The Avengers found them on the battlefield, side by side, chest to chest, still holding onto one another’s hands as they lay amongst the rubble of the world they’d just saved.
Turning around and dropping a few of the bags, he hitched his backpack up and then continued on his way. It made his back ache like shit, but it was the least he could do for Mrs Wilson. And anyway- she’d asked for baking stuff, which inevitably meant cookies were on the way. And Steve
“A lot?” Sam raised an eyebrow, understanding.
His foot stopped an inch from her plaque and hovered there uselessly for a few seconds before he dropped it gently back down a safe distance from it.
They’d all seen Tony go down earlier, but in the chaos and the fighting, the team had been separated and they’d lost one another. Steve, Thor and Clint had had to keep the brawl going so that the attention was on them and not the others while they’d dragged Tony to safety, but it also meant that now those stupid HYDRA fucks had finally been dealt with, none of them knew where the others actually
Bucky groaned loudly and let his head sink into the carpet, half his face smushing into his calculus in defeat. Beside him, Steve and Sam did variations of the same thing- Sam took the wall, and Steve rested his head into his hands.
"Oh, by the way," Natasha looked up for a moment, waving to Steve, "your boyfriend is about to start a fight in the corridors. Again."
Pulling out his phone, he saw the texts from Bucky and Peggy wishing him luck, and grinned despite himself. Moving away from Brooklyn and over to Manhattan had been hard- not being able to see both of his best friends whenever he wanted was even harder- but they were still there. And he was going back down to see them after school, so it wasn’t the end of the world. He could get through this.
So he spent twenty minutes methodically cleaning up the bathroom, making sure there was not a speck of red amongst the floor and pretending like he couldn’t feel his jaw throbbing in pain. It was stiffening up and he needed to get some ice for it, but he couldn’t go downstairs. The team were downstairs and they’d ask, and Tony didn’t know what to say to them. He couldn’t say Steve had hit him- that was too incriminating and, and out-of-context, and anyway, none of them would believe him anyway, because it was Steve.
“You know, it’s okay to still be fucked up about what happened,” Tony said softly, “it’s okay. And Bucky might look like you just shot his grandmother, but if you need to talk to him about it, I’m 100% certain he will be there-”
What the fuck is WRONG with you?”
“Knock yourself out,” he replied warily, wondering what it was the AI was about to impart on him.
“So it’s your word against his, then?” Fury asked, “and you’re the one who walked up to him unprovoked and attacked him.”
"It appears so," Thor said, cocking his head, "Tony, not to be rude, but, uh- what the fuck?"
Clint and Sam began bickering at the table, but Steve was already pushing himself away and beginning to try and navigate himself through the crowds. Natasha watched him go with a raised eyebrow; he saw her out of the corner of his eye, but didn't acknowledge it. He wasn't really sure what his goal was- maybe he just wanted to see. Maybe he was curious.
Tony had had a shitty few months, his head was all over the place and for a brief period he’d been on a downward spiral of self-hatred that had threatened to consume him entirely, sure, but it was
Steve blinked a few times. Peter stared at him intently, skinny arms folded expectantly like he was waiting for Steve to say something. When he didn’t, Peter sighed.
“This isn’t up for debate,” Tony told her sharply, but she just rolled her eyes and then fell into step next to him, shoulders brushing as they hurried out of the venue.
“It doesn’t matter.”
And, apparently, Tony did too. Because he hovered for a second, just a single second, and then tilted his head and leaned down, capturing Steve’s mouth in the softest of kisses. It was obviously nervous, Tony’s mouth barely even pressing against his own, and the world was roaring so loudly in his ears at that point that Steve didn’t think he’d have been able to concentrate on anything else if he’d tried.
here in a week, Clint.”
Recovery was slow going, not just for Steve and Tony, but for the whole world.
Tony thought it over. “I don’t want to make any of your friends uncomfortable—”
Tony leaned in and kissed him quiet; lips a soft press against Steve’s moving mouth- and really, Steve didn’t think he was ever going to get used to that; to the way Tony’s mouth felt against his own, to how softly Tony held him. It was addictive. It was perfect.
“I do.”
She said it with conviction. If Tony didn’t know her so well, he’d think she believed what she was saying.
“Hey,” Steve shook his head and laughed, “don’t do that to yourself- he notices you alright. I’ve seen the way he stares at you when you walk by. And Tony’s always complaining about how much Thor complains about his hopeless crush on you. It’s obvious, Jane.”
but Tony didn’t flinch, because Tony knew that voice better than anything; that voice was safe. That voice was home.
Once they’d kidnapped him, it didn’t take long for all of them to end up in the communal kitchen, dropping Tony gently on the table and then pressing a mug of coffee immediately into his hands.
"Alright,
“Stop it,” Steve hissed before he even knew what he was doing, covering his head with his hands. He couldn’t listen to any more of it, “stop the recording, JARVIS, now.”
It was quite honestly adorable. Although maybe Steve was slightly biased. But who the fuck cared, really?
Deep down, Tony knew he was right. Steve was good at this; the tactical evaluation, the cold hard facts and logic as opposed to Tony’s emotionally driven responses. It was why they complemented one another so well on the field- Tony was the heart and Steve was the head. And where Tony would cling on to this, desperate to try and have Steve as close as possible and try and just pretend none of this shit had ever happened, Steve looked at it logically. Steve knew that it
He liked to think she was out there, somewhere. Maybe not in the city- she’d never liked it, not really- but with the stars. With nature. With the sun and the threads of gold it weaved through the buildings. She’d always been a ray of sunshine to him, after all.
“No,” Steve said, palming a hand over his face before raising it, a sign of peace, “no, fuck, I’m sorry. I’m just… it’s been a long night. Stay.”
wrong, where the was no evil in his heart or sins to his name and they’d done that to him, for months—
“Of course it matters, Natasha. Did he apologise? I bet he thought it was his fault. I’d drilled it into his head every other time I fucking hit him, after all.” Steve’s jaw clenched to the point of pain, and he felt the vicious sting of tears bleed through his eyes. “Did he cry?”
Tony had gone totally nuts, screaming at him until his voice got caught in his throat and he started to choke up. Steve was so distraught by the sight of Tony like that that he just hadn’t had it in him to try again.
After that, Steve stopped raising his voice entirely.
“What other choice do we have?” Thor snapped, “the best chance we have of getting to him in time is if we call a large-scale search party. This mountain is too big to search alone and without equipment.”
it. If Thor hadn’t rushed in and tackled him before he could throw another punch, he would have done. He would have beaten Tony to death.
Both Thor and Tony pulled the same face at the same time. “We’re hiding,” Tony admitted in the end, and Thor nodded again. “From evil forces,” he added.
“You’ve absolutely
does that at least once-“
“It doesn’t sound like a whim to me,” Steve said gently, “it sounds like Scott just proved you could do it and survive.”
“I’m not, I told you, this isn’t… I’m no good with them, not in the long term, and they’re smelly and dumb and loud and—”
He and Sam waited impatiently in the living room for a few minutes; Steve glancing up at the door every other second to check. Sam poked him in the shoulder and told him not to worry.
Or, a better way of saying it was that the fault-lines became more obvious. Tony realised that most of them weren’t even belonging to Steve.
“Steve’s turning sixteen,” Sam wiggled his eyebrows and smiled brightly, “we’re throwing him a party!”
“ENOUGH! Fine! I may excessively call my h-
“He might be a little sore right now, sugarsnap. But I’ll let you draw on mine, if you really want,” Tony’s voice filtered through the haze, and oh.
“You wouldn’t be having an anything if it weren’t for me! The least you can do is respect my wishes!” Peter argued, grabbing his dad’s foot and pushing, jerking him out of Pop’s arms and sending him rolling off the bed.
you that?” He asked, horrified, “oh Jesus, see, this is why I’d be the worst housewife ever. I am so sorry. That is
The gentlest of hands, too small to be an adult’s, settled on his leg. The singing stopped, replaced with: “Am I allowed to draw unicorns on his cast?”
“You really don’t have to make anything up-“
, Steve.”
The sky was beautifully clear, and the place was utterly, utterly silent.
The last thing Steve saw as he flicked his head back was one of Tony’s friends slipping an arm around his waist and pulling him close, laughing loudly. Tony let his head fall into their shoulder and said something that made them laugh harder, and then both of them veered off sideways, falling into the nearby car door and clutching one another, hysterical with amusement.
So basically, he’d started his panicked Christmas shopping a month early, in the hope that he’d stumble upon something perfect and also preferably under thirty dollars. Which was seeming more and more unlikely by the minute.
Steve looked up at him, nearly bumping noses with the other boy when he realized how close they were. Tony just smiled- sad around the edges. “He was very grateful when I showed up with his little brother though. Took me inside and gave me some ice for the black eye Loki had inflicted upon me and everything. I don’t think there’s a malicious bone in that boy’s body.”
Steve shrugged. He… had arranged a cab. But at some point between entering the place and getting to this kitchen, it seemed he no longer had any money in his jacket. “I’ll work something out.”
Steve’s things.
Following Tony’s orders, Steve didn’t hang up. Just tucked the phone calmly into his pocket and then raised his fists.
“You want help?”
Tony’s eyebrows raised up to his forehead, and Steve couldn’t help but grin. Yeah. He felt that. “Oh, yowza, that’s a bit of a bombshell to drop in the middle of a fight, huh? Don’t blame you for losing your cool.”
“Oh, right, that makes conspiring with terrorists okay then.”
At that, Steve frowned. “Why would he-“
Tony grabbed the pillow back from Steve and smacked him with it. Steve spluttered in offence and hit him back. Of course, this ended with Tony pinning him effortlessly a few moments later, hands digging into his sides and tickling him ruthlessly, despite Steve’s loud yelling and ungainly flailing.
Tony paused, feeling the panic fade as fast as it had come. There were hazy images and vague memories of waking after Steve had arrived, but he had no idea how much of that was real and how much was delirium. Knowing that the team had all made it out was a huge weight off his shoulders, and he picked up the next question on his growing list. “Am I in South Korea?”
“These are my rooms,” Steve reminded him. “And you were not invited here. What do you think Tony will say when he finds out you have abandoned your confinement and come here?”
“Yes. Run away,” Steve suggested evenly.  His eyes narrowed, looking around at the garden with its walls and gates.  “But, you were already doing that, weren’t you?  Cutting across the garden to get to the courtyard without notice.”
A desperate keening welled up inside him like a silent scream, his insides going liquid and boneless as Tony’s mouth grazed over the pulse beating on his neck. His breath was warm, and his teeth--God, his teeth--Steve moaned, gripping the bedpost with one hand, his eyes catching on his reflection in the looking glass again. He looked obscene.  His skin was flushed, his eyes half-lidded, his collar pushed back from his neck while his cock tented his pants and painted a burgeoning wetness on their front.  He was damned, too, then, Steve thought to himself, closing his eyes and tipping his head back.
“No,” Ms. Potts said while Rhodes covered his laugh with his hand.  “You two,” she continued, “have to get dressed. The gala starts at seven, and it is—almost six, which means if you are fashionably late, as usual, you still only have a couple of hours.  Tony, your tux is in your closet. Steve, your suit is in your room.”
That was his first thought.  The room was cold. Dark. Well, not dark, really, just darker than the corridor. It took his eyes a moment to adjust to the dim lighting.  Machines beeped. There was a low, susurrating hum of air that sounded too steady to be anything other than man-made.  Images in varying degree of detail glowed on large monitors along one wall.  Displays of vitals and other information lit up screens attached to different machines.  A nurse was putting a blue sheet coated with dark stains of red into an orange plastic bag marked biohazard.  She looked up in surprise as he entered, one gloved hand clutching the sheet part of the way into the open mouth of the bag.
“Wow.  Cool.  Eh, can I get a selfie with you?” the student requested.
“Don’t,” Steve warned, his stomach sinking.  He should have seen this coming.  He should have realized Brock wouldn’t let the money go so easily. “Brock, you can’t do that.  He’ll sue or--”
“How’d they know about all that stuff?” Steve asked.
Once for trust, once for joy, once for sorrow, once for plenty, once for want and the final binding for forgiveness, for that was one that needed to be closest to love, which tied the knot. It was only when Steve looked down at their bound hands that he caught it, the light, silvery flash buried against the rope, tiny links of chain in a metal that Steve knew already bound them.  His breath caught in his throat, the sudden hitch catching Tony’s attention.
“A passing few,” Tony admitted, nodding his head back and forth as his lips curled into a smile.
“Um...excuse me?” Tony blurted out, a whiplash of bright, white pain lancing across his chest. He swiveled back around to watch Rhodey lean against the desk next to where Tony sat, arms crossing over his chest. “That's not—no. That's not possible.”
When they finally subsided, Steve paused for a moment to realize this was the most he’d talked about his mom in ages, and the first time in months he’d said anything about her that wasn’t related to her condition.  It felt good.  Freeing somehow.  Except that it wasn’t real, none of this was, and there was a new wardrobe with a shirt worth more than anything he’d ever owned sitting downstairs in the shithole apartment his best friend let him crash in.  Well, that certainly breaks the spell, he thought.
Steve let out a soft, frustrated sound.  That was… definitely not a conversation he was looking forward to having, even if he knew he had to talk to Brock at some point.  Mature adults talked to their partners about sex.  He had withstood sixteen solid hours of being pinned down with nothing more than a few rocks between him and the people armed with way more guns than they should have.  He could handle a talk with his boyfriend about sex.  He just… somehow didn’t think Brock was going to take the suggestions that they change things up all that well.
Naked, greedy hunger, that was all that Tony could discern on Steve’s face, not that he had much time to think it over.  He sometimes forgot, even now, how fast Steve could
“I’m good, thanks,” Steve said, taking the chair opposite where Tony lounged on the loveseat.  “Everything okay?” he asked, glancing around towards the suite, where Pepper was pacing behind the glass doors with a phone stuck to her ear, gesturing wildly.  “Was there news about…the thing?  Is that why everyone was here this morning?  I didn’t want to intrude.”
“I’m fine,” Tony sniffed, his voice quavering on the words, but it was true.  Now.  He was. Really.  Steve was here and everything was okay—well, except for probably the police station.  Except he wasn’t okay. They held him down and put handcuffs on him and put him in a
“Oh, now, see, we both know you’re lying there, Steve,” Brock replied, chuckingly darkly.  “I was gonna be nice, you know?  Take my money and let you go.  I said, Brock, sure, it’s a great piece of ass, but no big loss. There’ll be another.  But now?  After that little display?” he made a disapproving tutting sound.  “Now, we’re going to have to play this a bit differently, you and me.  The way I see it, this can go one of two ways.  You can go get that check back, take your punishment like a good boy--I won’t even make it that bad--and we’ll forget today ever happened.  We can go back to the way things were going to be.  You and me and everything working out like it was supposed to before you fucked it up.  Or, I can see how much the tabloids will pay me for this story.  Maybe not a million bucks, but it’ll feel good to see your name dragged along with Stark’s.  Let the Buchanan’s and all your Army buddies know what you really are.  Got a nice copy of that NDA you signed off your email.  I think that’d look real nice right under the headline, don’t you?”
And none of the explanations that ran through his head in the next few moments of silence explained the look of abject horror that skirted quickly across Tony’s face as Barton left.
Ah, rationalization, my old friend, Tony thought with a flat grimace, forehead creasing as he looked out the windshield at the crumbling front of the building, wishing, not for the first time today, that Rhodey didn't have an actual job that occasionally required him to do things that served the taxpayers.
“If I didn’t please you, I’d be...punished,” Steve filled in, finally, the words dragging out of the bottomless pit of his stomach.  “Zola said, if I didn’t please you, there were punishments, Tony, and—I didn’t want to think—I
“Beautiful,” Tony murmured, glancing down at Steve.  He moved away then, to the side of the bed, and Steve heard the rustling clank of metal again.  His heart skipped a beat, then thudded at his ribs, counting off against each sound as Tony pulled the chain from the base of the bed and wrapped it around Steve’s thighs, one, then the other, tightening it until Steve’s ass was pulled apart far enough that he felt a rush of cold air tingle across his hole.  His cock juddered and spurted.  Tony glanced at it, seemingly uninterested, then hummed again, low under his breath, and lifted Steve’s right leg up, affixing a smaller chain from the base of the bed around Steve’s knee to the headboard.  The other leg got the same treatment, until he was chained and spread wide, pulled apart and exposed for Tony to see.  To use.  Steve swallowed.
“Nnuh-uh-uh, can’t have that kind of attitude, now.  I had a nice talk with Lord Sitwell about you, and I think…I think you and I, we’re going to need to come to an understanding about how things work around here.  This,” Zola said, swinging an arm wide.  “Is…I’m sorry, what’s your name, boy?”
.  Steve came back. Tony wasn’t sure why that last part meant so much, but it did.
Shellhead would disappear every now and then to eat, or keep lookout, Steve wasn’t always sure, but he always returned by nightfall.  It took awhile for Steve to fall asleep, particularly at first. The darkness was nearly absolute, with just a few stars and the moon giving light.  There was something deeply unnerving about the sea at night, so inky black that Steve couldn’t tell where it stopped and the sky began. It was eerily quiet out here, too, with just the water lapping at the boat and Shellhead occasioning splashing or thumping a tentacle at the hull.
“But, I’ve been told I need to update my wardrobe,” Steve told him, with a deprecating sort of smile, though Tony had tuned most of that out after the part about Happy telling Steve where he’d taken Tony, which meant Steve was keeping tabs, which, okay, of course he was, but the chauffer-shaped LoJack still rankled a bit.  “Maybe you could point me in the right direction.  You could pick up whatever you might want, too.  I know you didn’t bring much from home.  You might want…something new.”
Later, Tony would swear it happened just this way:  Steve turned a bit in his seat, caught the waiter’s eye, and plates of food suddenly appeared.
“In case I didn’t mention it last night, thank you for, ah, rescuing me and all,” Tony said.   “My hero,” Tony added, smiling shyly up at Steve.
“Right,” Tony said after a beat, then sat back against the back of the car, the flurry of motion seeming to drain out of him.  “Right.  Of course.  That’s…yeah.  Good point. No reason to carry this thing too far, right?  High Roller, Happy,” he added, almost as an afterthought, slashing a hand through the air, then letting it drop to his thigh where he fisted both his hands, then splayed them out again, before reaching up to tap at his chest.  A habit.  Some kind of anxiety reflex.
“You have already broken the record for the furthest manned spaceflight,” JARVIS reminded him.
“No, he does not say these things. Not to me.  General Rhodes, perhaps,” Cam said.  “Everyone, they want something from him, you know?  Even now, they are all crawling around the Castle like ants, hoping for a crumb before he leaves.  He gives you things so that you do not ask. I think, he does not want you to ask. Not you.  Me, this is okay,” Cam finished, wobbling his head a bit as he considered it.
“Tony,” Steve groaned, pulling the name out from somewhere deep.  Sleep to this, to all of this, the rush of sensations, soft hands and rough beard, friction and want, all of a sudden, it was too much and not enough.  Stop, don’t stop, more, less, it was all whirling around in his head like one of those storms Clint talked about that turned so fast it sucked the trees from the earth.
The last wasn’t a denial. Steve thought it might be a prayer.
“Yes,” Steve replied around a sigh.  It still didn’t seem real.  Like something out of a strange dream, where everything was wrong and then something happened that seemed to have nothing to do with the rest of it, but was right in the middle of everything.
How was it then that Tony felt so humbled, so powerless as he stood here, holding everything that mattered in his hands? How was he supposed to do this without screwing things up and making Steve think of options, which totally did not exist, so let’s just stop even thinking that word, right now.  He should have JARVIS scrub it from any online dictionaries or libraries or e-books and replace it with Voldemort.  That would be ironic. Okay, sure, only for him, but still.
Something about the stars...
He took a moment to wonder at the irony of the fact that his attempt at regaining a sense of autonomy had resulted in a situation where he was in even less control.  He didn’t even know his current client’s name or where he was going.  Not that Steve felt threatened, exactly, just completely out of his element.
“Did he come?” Conference Room Steve asked the other Steves.
Steve nodded and stepped back, giving Tony plenty of room while he rinsed the shampoo from his hair.  When that was done, Steve turned the water off and handed him one of those white, fluffy towels from the warming rack just outside the stall, and then took one of the smaller ones and held it up in question. Tony nodded, and turned to let Steve work the towel through his hair, squeezing and rubbing the excess water out.  Tony finished drying the rest of himself off, then picked up the robe from the floor and put that back on. Steve ducked out of the bathroom when the suite’s doorbell chimed in just the towel slung low around his hips, and Tony’s eyes couldn’t help but follow the sight.
“It would just be nice if it wasn’t so hard, you know?” Brock went on, drawing Steve’s wandering thoughts back to his boyfriend. “Just a
Tony sat at the cabin's small, round dinner table and nudged the fork next to his plate into a straighter line, then back again when it still didn't look quite right. He looked across the table at the empty place meant for Steve, and reached across to adjust Steve's fork before raising his eyes to look at the clock on the mantle. Rather judgmentally, in his opinion, it was steadfastly ticking towards the time when Steve was scheduled to arrive.
“You two doing the tourist thing today or what?” Rhodey asked, taking a huge bite of panic muffin as he did.  “You should do one of those bus tour things with the little headsets.  I’ll pay.”
Steve huffed out a low breath and glanced over at the punching bag, then nodded and looked back at Tony. “Both of us. I don’t know. Whoever needs to hear it,” he shrugged. “Come down to the kitchen. I’ll make you an omelette, and we can talk.”
“There’s Happy,” Steve said quickly and pulled his arm from where he’d looped it through Tony’s, cleared his throat and nodded his head towards the valet line.
“I don’t...I don’t know,” Steve managed to choke out.  “Never tried.”
Tony smiled, almost mischievously, and leaned over Steve’s chest, dipping his head to take one of Steve’s metal-covered nipples in his mouth.  Steve’s whole body jerked.  His hands came up to scabber at Tony’s head, though he couldn’t seem to decide if he was pulling Tony away or holding him close.  He felt Tony’s tongue, warm and wet, flick against the delicate nub where it was caught between the teeth of the two half-moons.  A low chuckle sent a puff of warm air across it that cooled when it met the wet skin.
“I think we just need to let the lawyers handle it from here, Tony,” Steve answered, letting his head dip down to his chest where he leaned against the counter.
After his face was smooth, he considered doing his chest, then figured it wouldn’t matter.  Not like anyone was going to see it.  For a second, he imagined what it would look like covered in a gauzy, lacy red material.  How it would feel, the soft satin rubbing across his nipples.  The lace, just abrasive enough that he would feel it under his shirt all night.  No one would know, except him. And Steve. Steve would know.  Every time he looked at Tony, Steve would know, and Tony would know he was thinking about it.
,” Tony’s voice rumbled across Steve’s skin.  “Say it.”
The world tilted on its axis, blurred, then formed into almost too-sharp relief, everything crashing into him at once, but none of it made sense.  It was there, in front of him.  He could see it.  Right there.  But his mind couldn’t make any sense of it.  His vision blacked for a moment, everything seemed to dissolve, then reform.   When it did, it was wrong, distant somehow, like he was above it, not fully present, watching it happen through a long lens.
“You?  This was—how did—what in the—” Tony stammered, walking around to the front of the van where a large dent had caved in nearly the entire engine block.  Off to one side, a concrete pylon that had to weigh at least a few hundred pounds was sitting broken into three pieces.  He looked back at Steve, who was still holding the door panel, in confusion, then scanned the destruction around him. Slowly, Tony walked back over to where Steve stood.  It had clicked into place, though, not so much clicked as sort of settled over him, this terrible, wonderful realization.
“Nah, I’m good.  Bus picks up right down the block. But, thanks,” Steve replied.  “You have a safe trip, okay?  Knock ‘em dead with your science stuff.”
He’d woken up on the fourth day feeling like he had the worst hangover of his life, his dick red and chafed and so damn sensitive it hurt to touch, his hole loose and raw around one of the dildos that was still shoved up inside him, being utterly useless.  Someone helped him into the bath and cleaned him up, but the cold water stung at the abraded skin, and left him shivering and curled into a ball on the mess of a bed, just barely able to muster the energy to hate life.
Tony waved, then turned to Thor and pushed him away back down the corridor. Steve watched, amused as the two boys had a brief shoving match, until Thor had to pick Tony up off the floor and then back away when Tony made a few rapid gestures, pointing off in the direction of the science corridor. Once Thor had bounced off looking excited, Tony turned back around and leaned against the windowsill, grinning down at Steve.
It took Tony three seconds to cave. “Oh my God,
“Will both of you quit flirting for one goddamn second and focus on the mission at hand?” Bucky grumbled, “we’re trying to defend our ship from invasion and all you’re goddamn doing is yappin’ at one another-”
“It was—”
Steve shrugged. His fingers were tapping against his leg again- a habit he’d only picked up a few weeks ago, and now seemed to do constantly. “Wanted to be ready if we got another call. SHIELD said there was a chance they’d come back again.”
Again, Steve and Tony shot one another a look. “Home sweet home,” Tony said through a sigh, and Steve slipped his arm around Tony’s waist, thumb running back and forth along the warm exposed skin of his waist.
He took a step forward, moving around the couch and keeping his jaw clenched tightly to stop from crying out with the sense of lingering distress. It was stupid, stupid stupid stupid, but he wanted to sob. The emotions that had been left behind were still there, with no outlet to conduct them to. What he ended up with was a frustrated sort of fear, caught between trying to tell himself to pull it together and simply bursting into tears.
She crouched, hand still gripping his hair. “You do realize that you’re in the same facility where your little pal Bucky was conditioned, right? You do also realise, that all the equipment that we used on him is still fully functioning, just ready to be used?” Her face moved to his ear, warm breath against his clammy skin. “How do you think Tony Stark would fare against a Steve Rogers under HYDRA’s control?”
She wiggled her eyebrows and then laughed, smiling her lovely smile as she jumped up and down next to him. “He kissed you!” She said with a squeal, and Steve felt the infectious excitement buzz inside him as he joined her in jumping around the room.
“You bet they are,” Tony responded, walking further in and then dumping everything onto the table. The team crowded around, hands reaching out to grab their assigned stuff. He watched Natasha’s eyes sparkle happily at the new suit, felt the pat on the back and heartfelt thanks Thor gave him when he pulled out his new reinforced strap from the little mound of inventions. He spotted Steve’s eyes on him and quickly delved down into the mound, pulling out a USB stick from the bottom. “New training program for you, Cap, don’t worry, I didn’t leave you out.”
It had probably been unwise. Sick, skinny, asthmatic little Steve, begging and begging to play out in the freezing cold with Bucky. He’d spent hours and hours just looking through the windows at all the huge shop displays covered in tinsel and snow. December meant Christmas, and everyone was always happier at Christmas. Even his mom, who was always usually so tired from her work, seemed to have that little extra spring in her step. Sometimes she’d come home with cookies she’d pilfered from her office, and Steve remembers vividly how he’d firmly believed that it was Santa giving his mom those cookies throughout the month. She’d always made up the most imaginative stories about it- tales of reindeer flying up to the roof of her building, doling out cookies for the workers and then running off again to recommence with the Christmas preparations. He’d always thought his mom was the best mom in the world when she’d come home and given them to him instead. Thought it was the kindest thing a person could do- especially seeing as the gifts had come from Santa himself, and she could have just kept them all to herself.
been an asshole.
He tasted the smoke curling into his own mouth, bitter and sharp and mixed with the taste of Tony as he pressed softly against the boy’s lips, feeling Tony’s mouth open under his own. His eyes fluttered shut; the fireworks bursting behind his eyelids and sending his heart racing manically- and Steve felt Tony’s hands wrap delicately around Steve’s waist, pull him closer until they were chest to chest, Tony leaning up trying to catch as much of his mouth as he could manage.
“You know absolutely
“I dunno, depends on how much you gave away to Social Services when you called them,” Bruce told him with a tight mouth, “because they’re on their way up as we speak, but in the light of some new information, it turns out that handing him over right now would be a very bad idea.”
“Petey? Can I come in?” Came Pops’ quiet voice outside his room.
“I know I say this every time,” Sam said, his face more serious now, “but if you ever want to talk…”
He tried to think of it. It was important. Something about love and dates and Christmas crackers, and…
But he had. He had gotten hurt. Because at the end of the day, this had been a boy, looking at the ugly power of his father’s rage, and just wondering what the hell it was that he’d done to make his own dad hate him so much. Steve saw the look in Tony’s eyes when he talked about Howard sometimes. Saw the pain, the childish frustration. Under all the resentment, under all his cold indifference, Tony had only ever wanted his father to be proud of him. To love him.
“I seem to remember a particular evening that involved me up to my elbows in dirty dish water, you getting home and us finally scratching kitchen sink off our list of Everywhere But the Kitchen Sink,” Tony said with a grin.  “To this day, the smell of dishsoap is a turn on.”
“Can you, ah.  Can you tell him…” Steve began, then sucked in a breath and flattened his mouth.   “Thanks.  I guess.  Just, you know.  Thank him for me.  He--”  Steve stopped, biting his lip.  “Just thanks,” he finally settled on, though it felt empty and hollow and not at all what he wanted to say, even if he didn’t know what he actually wanted to say.
“Thanks,” Tony muttered, shooting Barnes an annoyed look.
“Shocking conclusion on my part, considering you haven’t been the last two times when I was working,” Steve pointed out in a droll, tired-sounding tone.
What had he expected, after all, he wondered with a moment’s bitterness aimed squarely at himself.  It wasn’t like he didn’t know what last night had been about.  That had been very clear.  Tony didn’t want to exchange small talk over breakfast with him.  He’d gotten what he wanted from Steve last night, and he kept his side of the bargain.  The proof of that was in Steve’s hand, which was all that was required, not holding Steve’s hand like he was some innocent in all this.  So, being disappointed at not seeing Tony again would be just plain ridiculous on his part.  Whatever this had been, it was over, just as they both promised.  As it should be.  Because Tony was…
“We ate everything in the ‘fridge before it went bad,” Tony recalled.  “God, I don’t think I’ve ever been so sick.  What were we thinking? Death by condiment, obviously.  Why did we have so many jars of pickles anyway?  Who needs that many pickles?”
But Tony ignored him and continued on, seemingly talking to the park at large.  “I thought I was above that.  A better person than those other people that would just use you.  But the truth is…I knew from that first night that you wouldn’t be doing this without being absolutely desperate.  Maybe some people could and just enjoy the money, but not you.  I knew that, but I let myself keep on with it anyway.  Told myself whatever it was, I was helping, after all, right?  Making it easier, right?  God, what a crock of shit.  Never let it be said I can’t thoroughly delude myself when I really want to.”
Stark hummed, but didn’t say anything.
Ten nights of feasting and feting the emissary from Carvahlla and his retinue had kept Tony busy with matters of state, and the rest of the compound occupied with providing entertainment after the official parties and dinners were over.  Cam was an endless source of gossip, and with little else to occupy him, regaled Steve with story after story he picked up from the other attendants.  The Ambassador brought his own concubine, a small, plump woman with dark hair down to her knees, who kept a pet monkey on a gold leash and painted her skin in elaborate designs, and to hear Cam tell it, sometimes wore only that.  Two of the Ambassador’s retainers preferred each other, but didn’t want the Ambassador to learn of the relationship lest one lose his post, so engaged the concubines in their subterfuge.  Lord Barbrey only wanted to watch.  Lady Sybel liked to mount men.  Lord Roche wanted an older woman who would treat him as if he were still a babe in swaddling.  Lady Claudia came so loudly, the servants thought she was being murdered.  Lord Marbrand fell asleep in the middle of the act, so soundly that the poor concubine thought the man had died and woke him with her scream of horror.
“It…didn’t seem relevant,” Steve said with a shrug after a long moment of staring at his plate.  He shifted uncomfortably in his seat under the weight of Tony’s scrutiny.  Tony was watching him in that pin-the-bug-on-the-board way of his, and, yeah, Steve knew that wasn’t much of an answer.  He wasn’t even sure himself why he hadn’t said anything, except that he wasn’t sure what there was to say about it.
“My Dad always said the best weapon was the one you only have to use once,” Tony added with a small shrug of his shoulders.
“My mouth does tend to have a mind of his own,” Tony agreed with a lascivious leer that probably worked better on whatever blue movie Tony must have seen it in.  “Eh,” Tony said, tossing up his hands in a gesture of surrender. “Sometimes, you just gotta take your shot.” Tony bit his lip, rolling it between his teeth and smiled wickedly up at Steve from under his lashes.
“Well….” Steve said, the word a drawl.  He looked Tony up and down with exaggerated appraisal.  “I think we might be able to work something out…”
“Shall we?” Steve asked. Tony couldn’t have answered if he’d tried.  Instead, he just nodded and stepped towards where Steve stood.
“No, no, it’s--it’s nothing.  It’s fine,” Steve replied in a rush.
“You loaned out enough prototypes—two, I checked--to get a photo-op, get some press, get the doctors and everyone excited, and then you left the rest of the line waiting while you renegotiated things with the Army,” Tony said.
Didn’t mean he had to correct Steve, though.
“Looks like it’s my lucky night,” Steve said.
Tony unbuttoned his pants and slid the zipper down.  Cleaning himself up was easy enough, but there was something terrible about it, too.  It felt wrong.  Awful.  Mortifying.  He didn’t want to deal with any of this, but he didn’t have much of a choice. Thanks, biology.  Great assist, there.  This is what you’re made for, he heard echoing in his head.  Why would your body do this if it were meant to be any other way?  A warm, moist hole for an Alpha to put his dick in, and you’ll say thanks afterwards, just like all the rest, he thought bitterly.
“Is it okay if I put some water in my hands and then on your hair?  I was…well, I was thinking I’d wash it. I’ve kind of wanted to get my hands in it for a while now, but we don’t have to, Tony, honestly, it’s okay,” Steve said.
“Uh, yeah. Yeah, I'll just—I'll go. Never much liked the cold,” Tony said, backing up as he turned to go while Steve leaned forward against the railing, craning his neck back to look at the moon, the long column of his throat working up and down, his whole body gone rigid and coiled. Restrained, Tony thought out of nowhere, and wished he hadn't, because he couldn't unthink it or unsee it, the way fissure of certainty that he might not be the only one who knew how to break apart and put himself back together.
“I know,” Steve replied.  “Pumpkin.”
“Just like that,” Jarvis replied with a nod. “I’m not suggesting it is an easy thing, Tony.  Far from it.  Particularly not for you.  But, to paraphrase Lady Macbeth, what must be done, best done quickly.”
“No,” Steve cut in.  “No, you did fine. Great.  Really, Tony.  You were wonderful.  I’m just…they call it processing these days, I think,” he said with a small huff.
“Uh, of course,” Steve mumbled. “Should I just…”
Groggily, Steve sat up and looked around.  Candles glowed from various holders. Even the chandelier had been lit.  A fire sparked merrily in the fireplace.  The same grayish light spilled in from between the curtains, giving him no clue as to what time of day it might be.  He was alone, still in Tony’s bed, though...he thought perhaps he hadn’t been alone for very long, though he wasn’t sure why he was so certain of that.  He was clean, at least, he noticed, and wrapped in a soft quilt of red and gold that had a crest on it that wasn’t familiar to Steve.  A plate of food and cup of something sat on a small table by the bed. He was hungry, but, more than anything, wanted to know where Tony was.
“Thank you,” Steve said, clearing his throat.  “Hope I didn’t step on your toes.”
“You are,” Steve agreed, though he knew Tony wasn’t looking for agreement.  Tony looked at him for a long moment, mouth flattening into a thin line, before he moved forward, into Steve’s space, and ran his hands up the planes of Steve’s stomach and chest, fingers grazing across his nipples just hard enough to let Steve know he meant it.  This was a different kind of touch, which probably meant Steve had struck a nerve, but Tony’s body was pressed into his, and Steve’s cock was already half-hard, so he let the conversation go and held on to Tony instead.
“Then close your eyes. Close your eyes, Steve, and when you awaken, you will be mine. Forever. And I yours. If that is what you want,” Tony said as lightning flashed through the sliver of the shutters, casting a thin line of light along the floor.
“I just…you know.  Suggested it.  As a possibility.  I’m not a chemical engineer or anything,” Tony pointed out.
He was almost healed now.  It had taken all of Anto’s skill and knowledge to keep the Stranger alive this long, but it had worked, and for that, Anto felt a keen sense of…not pride. That would be wrong.  The knowledge wasn’t his, after all, but passed down from Maara, and from her mother, who had been healer, and from her dam-father, who had also been healer and so on back further than even Jhrvis could see, and he was mog-ur.  Accomplishment, maybe, Anto thought. Everyone had assumed that the Stranger would die. Anto thought that might be why Tyber hadn’t argued more with Jhrvis, though he would never say such a thing.
“I think we can find a better use for your mouth than lying, don’t you?” Tony said idly, as if the thought were only now occurring to him, though Steve doubted that was so.
“Something like that,” Steve said, then smiled and shook his head, looking up at the sun with a squint.  “What about you?  You were some kind of kid genius, right?  I remember reading a profile about you.  Said you went to MIT when you were, what, sixteen?”
“Steve. How much—how much are we talking about, here?” Tony asked quietly. He was surprised at how calm he sounded, distant, like he was observing this trainwreck about to happen from afar, and somewhere, the back of his mind suggested mild shock in a cultured, British-sounding voice.
“S’okay,” Tony tried to assure the alien.  “Heal me. Fix me. The gift is life, right?  That can’t be ba--oh! Oh, yeah. Yeah, there you go, that’s--” he let out a long, low hiss.  “You should really put this in the brochure,” he managed to rasp out as the alien’s finger found the ring of his hole again and started to rub at the puffy rim with his thumb. “Ahhhh, God, yeah, wow,” Tony said with a choked-off gasp that became a long, low moan.
“It’s not…Tony, that was a long time ago.  You’ve had a shock today.  You—you just need to give this time, and you’ll see.  You’ll think about it, and see.  You—you have this life, and I’m—how would I even begin to fit in there?  I don’t.  I don’t, and we both know it, you’re just…whatever you are about this,” Steve said with the same weary tone from earlier as he slowed to a halt outside his door.  “You’ve got this idea in your head that we can just…turn back the clock, and we can’t.  What happened, it was awful, and I hate it, for you, for me, for what you thought for all those years, but…come on, Tony, you gotta see that this was never going to be a happily ever after.”
“Breathe,” Tony ordered gently, and Steve realized by the cold tightness in his chest that he had forgotten to do that.  He drew in a breath, took in too much air with it, but swallowed it down with a shudder.
“You should talk to him,” Matt said.
“She still going with calling it a tennis lesson, huh?” Tony quipped.  “Well, I guess there are balls—“
all been a dream.  What made more sense, after all, a man in fine clothes appearing out of nowhere in the middle of the night on a barely used road in a backwater town or that he had fallen asleep or taken a heavier blow to the head than he realized and dreamt it all?  Still, sometimes, late at night when he couldn’t sleep, the memory of it would bloom clear as day in Steve’s mind, and he could watch it all unfold, as if from afar.  And he would think, he wished he knew the man’s name, though he didn’t know why such a thing mattered, before the memory slipped away again as soon as morning came.
“You said you won’t break our Bond,” Tony said carefully, drawing Steve’s surprised gaze to his face.
“I know what you are,” Steve grits out, low enough that only Tony can hear him. His voice is thick and hot, on the verge of tears from sheer exhaustion. He brings the Shield down over the face plate, over and over and over. It must be disorienting enough that Tony— not-Tony— can do nothing but flail his arms in a discoordinated attempt to wrench Steve off of him. The face plate crumples and Steve rips it off, shoulders heaving.
When Tony next wakes, Howard is gone, and his mind has cleared enough to know that no one was ever really there. And he can sit up, still. And he remembers his own name.
The walls are damp and cold, concrete. He stumbles over a cord running across the floor of the hall. His hand lands on a doorknob.
It did not occur to him until he started talking that it had been a long time since he’d talked to anyone like this. Tony was a loner; the highest level of social interaction he had accustomed himself to was between himself and his trusty bartender, with some occasional back-and-forth with Timely’s local quack doctor, or the most stubborn sheriff in the west.
He’s pissed himself, but he feels mostly dry, now. It’s been some time. The room reeks of urine and soot and smoke and sweat, and rancid dry mouth breath. His throat tastes like copper, and he’s too parched to even swallow.
“Alright. Then what are you going to do?
(No, the question is, could Steve love him?)
Steve’s opinion of Tony will never recover from this, he thinks. Not that the good old Captain ever seemed to be Tony’s biggest fan. Steve plants himself between Tony and the crash site, watching in undisguised repulsion as Tony convulses and vomits— for the third time today. The smell of his own burnt flesh doubles the nausea, and the pain is beyond words. He’s cooked— and definitely concussed from the crash.
It’s about liberty. It’s about privacy. It’s about lives lost.
He leans forward on the podium, gripping it authoritatively with both hands.
Tony all along, they’re able to leverage this against SHIELD; Tony secures pardons for all surviving members of the resistance in record time. The hero prisons are shut down. The victims are released. Steve worries about him working himself back into a hospital bed, but at the same time, he’s familiar with the haunted look in Tony’s eyes, and he knows that Tony can’t rest until he’s righted some wrongs. Steve has the feeling as well. Guilt is a powerful motivator, and they both have a lot to atone for. Still, it’s hard to watch Tony hold himself accountable for things he
Steve said, “Make it one for each of us.”
“No.” Steve pauses. “Well, not really.”
The TV is on, and Steve is frozen in place watching as Tony’s image steps onto the screen. The golden stage lights make him glow. He strolls up to the press podium and smiles at the cameras. He dazzles in the spotlight, and Steve is one of the small handful on earth who know how false his public persona truly is; the world may know that Tony Stark
“Sooner I go, sooner we get you seen by a medic.”
“No, but—”
“Sher’ff,” he called, half shouting, half suppressing his voice, throwing an anxious look over his shoulder. “Sheriff. Steve! Open up!”
“I think,” Steve says, frowning, “You had a seizure.”
(This will haunt Steve for a long time after.)
“It should be easy, in and out, shake hands, smile for a picture. The flight will take longer than the job,” Tony assures him. Behind the bar, the margarita blender screams and whirs, pulverizing ice and tequila as the bartender salts the rim of a stemmed glass. Tony sucks on the husk of a used lime from the bottom of his first drink. He holds up two fingers, and mouths, “Make it two more.”
“It happened again in the night,” Steve tells him.
He’s quiet for a long time. He can’t stay much longer; the guard will change any minute and Steve will lose his window to slip out undetected. He isn’t done his work yet, so he has to stay vigilant. He has to go.
Tony nursed his drinks slower than he might’ve, had he been all by his lonesome. He found himself tracing his finger around the rim of the glass, forgetting to chase himself into a stupor. Talking to Steve captured his full attention, and for once, Tony was okay with being present. Turns out, the Sheriff was capable of being less than uptight once in a while. Call it a Christmas miracle.
“More,” he wheezes.
“I’m fine, Steve. I’m mostly fully recovered. A few more months on my diet and I’ll be weight restored, too. It’s nothing you need to worry about,” he says. What he doesn’t say is,
, either. I could at least be numbing the pain right now,” Tony snaps. If it’s pathetic, Steve doesn’t point it out. If he sounds desperate, he pretends not to notice.
They had been playing for hours, now. The last player folded out of the round, ceding victory to Tony, and he cackled gleefully. He was a few whiskies deep.
The thought isn’t fair, there’s still so much left of him, and he feels—
from town was present tonight, and in good spirits. The chatter and music, and the warmth of too many bodies packed into a small space, led to an irrefutable sense of— and Tony hated to admit it—
He jabs a finger at Tony, “You don’t think it’s simple? Fine. I can make it simple.”
“S’pose I earned that,” Tony breathed. It came out like a sort of sigh and a whine, instead of sounding like words.
masks and secret identities. They want to feel safe. We have to win back their respect.”
A fresh wave of empty tears and fear and loneliness. He’s never felt so
Really, something just really made him want to be here tonight. A feeling with no name. It had been a long time since Tony had wanted to be
Not this time. Of course he wouldn’t be so lucky.
“I don’t think it’s crazy, to want to do the noble thing,” Steve says, “That’s called courage.”
Apparently, a little too pleased.
“I put fifty on you pulling through,” Jan says, all smugness and dimples. “But it was just in good fun. We were worried sick, Tony. Really.”
“Sorry. I was distracted,” Steve says. Tony smiles. It’s that smile Steve fell in love with so long ago. That smile Steve missed when it was replaced with a false one, the smile he missed when Tony was gone. He hopes to see a lot more of it, going forward.
“Fucking disgusting.”
He turns it over in his hands, barely allowing himself to breathe. The metal is ice against his skin.
Talk about an anticlimactic death.
“Maybe that’s where we went so wrong. We needed both of us, to see the full picture. I wish we could have landed in the same place. I wish—”
Tony rubs his wrist.
He feels a tingle, deep down inside.
After logging so many hours in the Iron Man armor, Tony should be used to plummeting through the air, yet it never gets easier. Falling scares him. Every time.
“I know. I know you’re not,” Steve treasures, practically lying on him to keep him from hurting himself, “You’re not like that. Natasha isn’t here. Nobody knows.”
Tony’s throat felt tight. “Just fine.”
He tripped over his own feet and made it four whole strides before one of the bandits grabbed him none too gently by the arm.
“When the rain dries, I can climb out,” Steve goes on. “I can start a signal fire.”
“Million dollar question, huh?” He’s not being frustrating on purpose but he can’t seem to turn it off. Tony’s the expert deflector, but Steve can’t seem to hide a thing. He’s flashing frustration and fear like a neon sign. “Perk up, cupcake. You’re better looking when you smile. Let’s not make a whole event of this, huh?”
“Dramatic.”
Tony kisses Steve again. Steve’s only a little taller, and he bows his neck to meet him, and their bodies press close together. Warmth radiates between them.
“She stabbed me,” Tony says.
Steve takes the card. “You need to get help, Tony,” Steve says again. He holds it like a live grenade.
“Oh, uh. I can, I’ve got it. I can do that. Thank you, though, thanks,” Steve says, heat flooding to his cheeks. He feels crimson. He drops the sheet and fumbles with the towel, sopping up the soda on his pants, willing his confused body not to respond.
Unlike the previous night, when the bar had been a ghost town, it seemed like just about
* * *
It’s 1:30 in the morning. Snow falls. Steve is just another shadow. With the curfew in full swing, and the blanket of white muffling every sound, the city is as silent as the grave. Steve can hear his own heartbeat. His ears and nose grow numb and cherry red.
Needle prick.
She probably wouldn’t have even wasted precious time lingering at the mouth of the cave to keep Tony company before he drifted off to what would have been his death.
"It's over."
“You would have killed yourself. All you had to do was wait for the sedative to wear off. You would be dead right now if you bashed your head in.” Tony nods. He doesn’t get it. He nods anyways.
Steve isn’t in the habit of wandering around a common area in bare feet and under clothes, but he feels like a man possessed. Without the manufactured control that comes with the serum, and the years of trained calm, his hands might have been shook as he plugs his phone into the computer, and goes through the steps as he remembers— in crystal clarity— how Tony showed him.
There aren’t many things Steve wouldn’t do for Tony, and it feels like this is he time he really needed Tony to be willing to do anything for Steve. It isn’t
“Everything’s going to be okay,” Tony-Howard purrs. His voice sounds like three people speaking in unison. The world swims. Howard-Tony affectionately caresses Tony’s cheek.
“What’re you on about?”
“Where’m I?”
They’re losing numbers. They’re losing morale. They’re losing. And whatever is happening, Tony’s at the center of it. Tony and some kind of secret. Steve becomes obsessed with the idea of a change, but he says nothing to his colleagues. He’s sure they’re not too dense not to notice, but they grant him the dignity of not mentioning Steve’s rapid decline into obsessive paranoia.
If ever there was a God, let this be it.
Tony grimaces; he’s only had the one drink, and with his tolerance, it does nothing to settle his nerves or dull the throbbing in his skull that just seems to get worse and worse. After spending his morning hungover and sick from chemo, he hadn’t been able to hold down anything but a few sips of ginger ale in the car riding over to the airport.
“Really,” Tony assured him.  He reached out and took Steve’s hand, then canted his head to the side, straining to listen.  Slowly, a smile formed. “Not to be completely cliché about it, but…I think they’re playing our song.”
“How about one with a kiss?” the photographer called out, holding up his camera.  “Come on, you’re newlyweds, right?” he urged.
“He’s found an audience,” Charles said, with a small, fond shake of his head.  “He’ll talk your poor Alpha’s ear off.  Nice of him.  Your Steve.  Most wouldn’t want to give David the time of day, not now, anyway.  He’s too old.  Reminds them of what they’ll become.”
“There were a bunch of teams looking for you,” Steve said.
“Uh, yeah—I mean, thanks.  For that,” Tony mumbled, the words seeming to stick in his throat. “He—we.  You know, I don’t actually have any idea what he would have thought of all this.  Maybe this would have been enough, who the hell knows?”
Whoever Steve was, you just had watch other Alphas around him to know that they had figured out the pecking order.  Maybe it was the military thing or the annoyingly perfect thing or some other thing that only Alphas who knew the secret spit and scratch or some stupid Alpha scent bullshit knew, but they all got it, and got it fast.  It would be fun for Tony, all the bowing and scraping to his Alpha, except for the paralyzing terror.  What must it be like, to always be able to get what you wanted? Still seemed hard to believe that someone like Steve, who had clearly hit the Alpha lottery, managed to not be an utter dick simply because he could.
“I told you the boy knows what he is about,” Tony reminded him as he dipped the sponge in the water again and brought it back to Steve’s neck.
“I think we should try,” Steve responded.
Except, no one said that, of course.  Not Steve and not Brock, and okay, yes, it had been something they agreed to, together--mostly?  His frown deepened.  Anyway, they agreed, and it wasn’t fair to hold it against Brock now, just because maybe Steve wished… God, he didn’t know what he wished.  He couldn’t bring himself to wish it hadn’t happened.  He’d be lying if he tried to tell himself that.  Maybe he just wished… things were different somehow.
“They ruined my blanket fort,” he said again a few minutes later, and when Steve turned back to look at him, Tony was staring at him with an adorable pout on his face. “I
Thor beamed over at him, patting him on the back. “Surprisingly well! The Wrecking Crew are fools, but they certainly offer a strange form of entertainment for a Tuesday morning.”
He didn’t think about any of that. Instead, he worked.
Tony wondered whether he dreamed about, on those nights when they both woke up to the sound of crying from the crib. He wondered whether Peter, on some level, was aware of what had been done to him.
Steve had been out celebrating his promotion with Bucky and Peggy, the two of them egging him on to drink more than he probably should, and Tony had just been forced into going somewhere that wasn’t his workshop by an exasperated and mildly worried Pepper. Tony would later say that it was him who started the ball rolling; catching Steve’s eye across the crowded bar, romcom style, and smiling at him, but Steve disagreed. He was almost certain he’d been the first one to smile. Not that it really mattered. But it had been fun to bicker about in the mornings.
Things came to a head on a Saturday night, in the kitchen where it had all begun.
Steve beamed and grabbed his shoulders, pushing him backward until the back of his knees hit the bed and he fell backwards with a short yelp, Steve landing right on top of him. He made quick work of the rest of Tony’s shirt and then discarded it somewhere on the floor before leaning in again, hands braced on either side of Tony’s face as he kissed him.
Bruce, after a silent conversation with Tony, nodded and then walked quietly out of the room with a small smile in Steve’s direction, leaving the two of them alone in the hospital room. Steve was still staring at Tony, somewhat unwilling to believe anything that was happening. His head hurt, and he felt tired. Exhausted, even, despite the fact Bruce had said he’d been out for days. Nothing was making sense. “I… I hurt you,” he muttered, looking up at Tony somewhat disbelievingly, “I remember, I—I thought I’d—”
“WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?” Steve said, loud enough that the whole room turned to him that time, both Tony and Bucky jerking over to look at him.
“I hurt you,” he said, the words alone making Tony flinch a second later, “I can’t believe I-“
Bruce got back up a few minutes later to double-check whatever traps they’d set up around the cabin, and then slipped out of the door to go swap shifts with Rhodey. As soon as the other man walked in the door, he went immediately to Tony’s side and knelt down next to him, getting comfortable on the floor with Natasha. They shared a smile and discussed battle strategies quietly as Tony dozed, but there was a lingering thought that he kept at the forefront of his mind, right up until he was strong enough to voice it: “You guys need to get back down the mountain. It’s too dangerous up here.”
been known to be pretty contrary sometimes.” He grinned cheekily, but then leaned down and fluttered his eyelashes against Tony’s cheek- and God, that was such a Steve thing to do, Tony had never met
“You don’t fuck around when you’re playing hide and seek,” Steve answered solemnly. “It’s every man for himself. You could hide with someone for a whole game and have their back, but once they get caught? You ain’t on the same side no more,”
“He—what? Why?”
Tony swayed a little, the dizziness clearly messing with his vision as he tried to locate Steve. A second later, Thor jolted Tony’s socket back into place quickly, and Tony jerked.
Maybe sleep was a good idea.
“May I add,” JARVIS said hurriedly, and Steve got the feeling if he’d had eyes, Steve would be getting a death-stare off him right about now,  “that it was simply one of those ‘good-natured ribbings’; like what we had discussed earlier this morning-“
“Sorry, am I intruding, gentlemen? I thought the interview was over,” Pepper replied calmly.
He looked at Steve, lowered his head just enough to press a kiss to Steve’s lips, then dropped the faceplate and tightened his grip around Steve’s waist.  The HUD spread the galaxy out before him.
“Yeah,” Tony corrected, surprised that he was, actually, sure of this one thing, if little else.  “I do.”
Want to talk about fic or gay superheroes in love?  I'm sabrecmc on tumblr.  Come on over.
“No it isn’t,” Steve said, frowning down in confusion at the recorder.
“Say…say I was interested.  How am I going to date, Nat? That’s not exactly fair to this guy or whoever it is.  Lying about who I am, putting them in danger, not being able to tell them about…about the whole thing,” Steve argued, mouth twisting around the words.   “Not exactly the formula for building a relationship.  Pretty sure there’s something about a foundation of trust I’ve heard about.”
“Okay,” Tony said, muffled against Steve’s skin.  He was warm and solid and smelled like musk and sex and soap.  The hairs on his chest tickled at Steve’s side, and his cock, soft now, still felt amazing against Steve’s hip.
“Yeah,” Tony said.  “I get it, Steve.  You don’t have to explain.”
Steve frowned at her, drawing in a sharp breath.  Was that it?  Natasha was...incredibly observant was one way to put it.  She was also manipulative and worked for Fury, and Fury wanted something from this whole thing with Tony, something Steve couldn’t quite see.
He didn’t know what to do with this.  Politics and intrigue were like an upside-down chessboard to him.  Absently, he walked over to the credenza and picked up the package, setting the white lily to the side.  A jewel-crusted wooden box was below. Steve opened it.  Sitting in a swath of blue velvet was a simple ring, made of iron, Steve noticed, holding it up to the light.  The same insignias Rhodes had shown him on the coin were stamped around the band, meeting at the center where an uncut stone of pale blue sat.  It was far from the most expensive gift Tony had given him, but Steve’s hand shook as he held it.  It meant something, something Steve wasn’t privy to, not now, not yet. Something Tony didn’t want him to know.  But, there was meaning there, deep and true, and for some reason, he thought of the flat rune stones the soldiers had taken to wearing pinned to their mail, if they had it, or on simple chains around their necks, if they didn’t.
Steve wasn’t sure if Tony really believed there was nothing to it or was just saying that for the benefit of superstitious guards who gave the stones a wide berth as if they were afraid they might accidentally disturb them.  Somewhat to his chagrin, Steve found himself doing the same. They walked on for awhile, then Tony suddenly stopped and raised his hand.
“We fish,” Steve replied with forced brightness, holding up the rods.  He took those and the tackle box and headed for the dock, trusting that Tony would follow him.  The dock was a bit more rickety than he would have liked, and the old wood was peeling in some places.  He should have brought a second blanket for Tony to sit on, but it hadn’t occurred to him.  Truth be told, the only fishing he had ever done had been down at some of the streams that meandered off the river back in Brooklyn, him and Bucky with a cane pole, some string and a hook made out of one of Bucky’s mom’s sewing notions or sometimes just them and their hands, still too slow for the silvery fish that darted in the shallows.  Now, here he was, with all kinds of fancy fishing gear and nothing for his Omega to sit on, except dirty, splintery wood.  It was no wonder Tony didn’t want anything to do with him when he couldn’t even manage the bare minimum you were supposed to do for your Omega.  Should’ve stuck to the movies, Rogers, he thought with an internal rebuke.
“I—yes,” Tony replied.  She raised her eyebrow again and took a sip of sherry.  “I am.  Really. Steve, he’s…” All the things that Steve was sat there on the tip of his tongue.   Kind. Smart.  Different kind of smart than Tony, but fiercely brilliant, Tony knew.  Funny, when you knew how to read him.  A good man.  That was a trite turn of phrase, but Tony thought it may have never been more true than when applied to Steve.  None of that really told her much of anything, though.  It wasn’t what she cared about.  “I’m in love with him,” Tony said instead.  His throat clicked as he swallowed and dropped his head, one hand coming up to rub at the bridge of his nose.  “I didn’t mean to.”
Tony didn’t want him.
Steve stared at the final file.  Howard’s Lakehouse, 1985. The little arrow hovered over it, a key to Pandora’s final box.  The sudden urge to peel back the chunk of cement and drywall that hid the burner phone behind the refrigerator in the tiny, jagged crevice he’d found that first night he was here.  He longed to hear Tony’s voice, even if it was raised in anger, just to hear him, solid and real and present in the world in a way the flat reflection of Tony in these videos couldn’t be.  He wanted to tell Tony he was sorry.  For what, he wasn’t even sure.  For all of it, he supposed.  For the way Howard had used Steve as a blunt instrument to batter his son.  For the way Peggy still saw the man flying a clandestine mission over enemy territory far after that man had become someone else.  For Stane’s betrayal that came packaged in promises and approval.  For everything between them that they hadn’t done to each other, but that kept pushing them apart, no matter how much they each tried to hold on.
“Tell His Highness that I am fine.  I have been sketching and reading, and now, I will eat and drink, and he need not worry,” Steve said with an exasperated sigh.  He glanced sideways at Cam, who was giving him a considering, narrow-eyed look.
“Home,” JARVIS’ voice said.  The strange mental image of himself laying on the table, like a reflection, opened up across a panorama in his mind, then was gone.  “Heal. Home,” JARVIS’ voice repeated.
, he always had, like some fantasy fuck from one of those terrible novels his mom used to read by the pool, and now, he could just let it happen.  Contentment filled him. He was blissful, euphoric. He thought it might not all be his feelings, really, but it didn’t seem to matter. He felt them.  Reconciling what was happening to him with reality or experience just wasn’t plausible, all he had was feeling, and it felt incredible. Right.  Perfect.
He’s relentless, and while he knows Tony is embarrassed by his own need, he thinks that he’s lonely, too. The loneliness beats out the shame eventually, and Tony finally agrees. Steve is guilty and relieved; he shouldn't have pushed, maybe. But he thinks this is for the best. He thinks Tony won't let anyone else near enough to see how damaged he's become, and he has a fear-- one he dares not put into words-- of what might happen to Tony, alone.
“What?”
Pointed ears. Wrinkled chin. Green and unfamiliar. It isn’t Tony at all. It never was.
Some part of him can’t separate reality from the visceral feeling that he’s killing
Tony steps into Steve's space. He presses a monogrammed towel to Steve’s leg, patting his thigh where the soda made his pants wet, moving it rapidly up his pants, startlingly close to Steve’s—
Tony shakes his head and snaps his fingers in Jarvis’ direction. “Bring those over here, old chap. I’m dying for it.”
It feels wrong to call him
And he really sounds like he wants Steve to take it.
, Steve wants to say.
“Hello?” he calls out. There’s a lump in his throat and his pulse feels electric; he isn’t being smart, he isn’t being stealthy. He’s being stupid. He’s being hopeful. He can’t help it.
inside.
The conversation lulls, and Tony doesn’t mean to, but he’s putting nearly all his weight on Steve.
Suddenly curious, but not very hopeful, he turns his attention to the ground to see if the flask miraculously survived somehow. Hand tremoring, he brushes soggy ash away and unburies what remains of it— melted, warped, and empty. Just like Tony.
Someone chuckled in the shadows.
“Cap,” Tony says, throat impossibly tight, “Steve.”
“You’ll pay for that, swine.”
“What happened to you—” Steve begins, and he doesn’t know what to say about the condition Tony’s in. Whatever horrors happened here, he knows he’ll never get the whole story. That’s okay. Some things are too dark to say out loud.
He helps Tony drink until he splutters, and water runs down his clavicle. He coughs for a long time, gasping and choking, his bony rib cage heaving for air, so hard Steve irrationally worries about him breaking himself. Steve doesn’t think twice before putting a hand on the knobs of Tony’s spine and rubbing slow circles into the skin. Then he realizes that physical contact may be distressing, after God knows what hell Tony’s been through— but that was what his mother used to do for him, when he couldn’t catch his breath. That feels like forever ago, now.
“What—” Steve says. Everywhere Tony's hands touched burns, the skin ablaze under his clothes.
Steve can’t deny him. He helps Tony drink again. Tony immediately gets sick. It’s mostly just water that he spits back up, but he looks miserable, and Steve feels to blame.
He could never express how much he regrets. He still believes the Registration is wrong. He believes that things happened that didn’t need to happen. But things have changed; he’s seen that this is bigger than them, and that tearing each other apart doesn’t do any good. Tony had been right about one thing, and that was that they
Steve holds his breath. He can't stand to hear he's wrong.
At the bottom of the hole, there is only pain and blackness.
Tony finally makes a healthy weight. Steve can see the difference in Tony’s body— he looks more like a hero and less like a victim— but that’s more in the way he’s carrying himself than anything else.
Steve tells him they have to move, something about looking for shelter. Tony doesn’t hear him very well because his pulse is so loud in his ears. He looks up in the dark and sees that the cut o Steve’s forehead has healed, leaving a puckered scar.
“Don’t trust anyone.”
. You, changing. Tell me I’m wrong.”
Tony cleared his throat.
“My point is, if I didn’t want you to make it, you wouldn’t have made it.” He clears his throat, and he won’t look at Tony directly. It occurs to Tony that Steve is emotional about this. It isn’t something he knows how to deal with. He isn’t used to people fighting that hard for him. He doesn’t understand the point.
He does it just as Tony taught him.
The music lulled, and then started again. Barnes was playing a new song, something slower and almost sad. Tony peered across the room and saw the handsome young deputy making lovers’ eyes at his bride, who was leaning on the piano and swaying to the music.
” Steve asks, incredulously. Not for the first time, Tony regrets Steve’s resistance to just communicating via text, like everyone else in this century.
“Curfew? Can he even do that?” Cassie asks anxiously. The whole group has gathered up around the TV.
After every dirty play and shamelessly political ploy, Steve doesn’t know how to believe a word Tony says anymore. It's a loss in its own right which Steve will mourn when he has the privacy.
“To a swift recovery.”
It was Christmas night. Poinsettia flowers, bleeding red, and wreaths, handwoven from desert plants, hung from the moulding and the bar. Every window had a white candle burning in it, and Deputy Barnes was playing a holiday melody on the out-of-tune piano in the corner. The whores were wearing red and green. Hundreds of feet of paper streamers— hand painted with red and white peppermint stripes— hung in billowing loops from the ceiling. They rustled and fluttered on the breeze every time the door opened or closed.
Tony draws him arm back like he's going to hit Steve. Steve leans easily to the side and dodges. Tony tries to hit  him again. Steve hates to do it, but he catches Tony's wrist in his hand, immobilizing his arm. Tony's eyes bug out of his head. He starts thrashing, beating at Steve's chest with his other fist. It doesn't really hurt.
It happens like he expects: she sicks her dogs on him. He warns them. No one listens. (No one ever listens.) Steve has to
A wolfish whistle rang out in the stillness and Tony’s heart leapt into his throat. Frantically, he scanned the blackness for his aggressors, but he couldn’t see jack shit beyond the boundary of the street. The faces of the buildings were mostly in shadow, as were all the spaces between them. He could hear the tell-tale jingle of a coin pouch, stuffed full. They must’ve gone back and picked up Tony’s (rightful) poker earnings, as well as their own cash. That would explain the hold up. After all, one couldn’t travel very far in these parts without a full wallet, or you’d be hard pressed to get by. A group like them would never leave their money behind.
has to oversee it, someone has to be there to keep the demons in the box--”
“Be safe, Sam” Steve says. Sam salutes. He disappears into burning sky.
coming after all. Was it the rumble of the earth? God, wasn’t he dead yet? This seemed excessive.
He leans forward. Everyone watches him, an energy present that had been absent before. Steve drawing from some hazy idea of the leader he is to them, he tries to be that man. He doesn’t remember how to inspire hope. This is almost hope. Not hope, but something like it. A prayer to hold onto.
The inertia gives way, and Steve rushes into the room. All he feels is cascading relief. The hatred, the loathing, the anger, the hurt, the betrayal— it’s all gone somewhere else, for now. In his most primitive, incoherent thoughts, all Steve can muster right now is how glad he is to see Tony alive.
Tony’s vision splits and multiplies like he’s drunk. The irony doesn't escape him. The world is a sickening kaleidoscope. He fumbles with what little muscle control he has left for the glass beside the bed. It smashes on the corner of the bedside table. Tony gropes for a shard of glass, too impaired to control his grip. He feels it slice deep into his palm, and hot blood trickles down his wrist.
get back to his home and find a pistol, he’d have to find bullets, too, and then there was the risk of the thing backfiring. He hadn’t cleaned any of his guns in years.
“Whatever you say. I could walk all night.”
The pain stopped. His ears rang. Then, it hurt again.
“No, thank you. I’m fine,” Steve says. Tony opens the fridge and grabs a soda for himself. He pops the metal lid on the edge of the counter top, and the carbonation hisses. Tony wraps his lips around the mouth of the bottle, and Steve sudden'y can't tear his eyes away. Steve watches Tony’s Adam’s apple bob as he takes a long swig of the beverage. Steve looks down and clear his throat.
One more message appears, lighting up his screen:
“I don’t know what I’m doing. Oh, God. I don’t know what I’m doing. And I think,” Tony pauses. For the first time in their meeting, Tony purposefully meets Steve’s eyes, and the desperation is pitiable and startling. “I think, something is wrong with me. Or, I don’t know. I feel like I’m going crazy. I think someone has been following me. I can’t sleep. I think someone’s following me. Or I’m going crazy. Sometimes at night when I open my eyes I swear…” he trails off. Silent. Whatever he sees at night, Steve is pretty sure Tony is seeing it in front of him now, in the darkness. Something sinister and ephemeral, a thousand yards away. A chill runs down Steve’s spine.

This Tony has a different fighting style; he’s crueler and blunter. Clumsier as a pilot, but the smart armor makes up for this disadvantage. Steve could tell the difference between the real Tony piloting a suit of armor and any imposter. They’ve fought together too many times.
