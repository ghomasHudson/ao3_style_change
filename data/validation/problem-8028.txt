Tony is late for someone's birthday, Clint is putting his brain to good use (probably) for the first time in his life, and Steve is just SO DONE.
Jarvis, the man himself, was long dead. In memorial of his actual father figure, Tony built Jarvis. It was never the same, of course, because Tony couldn't stand hearing his voice but not seeing the man. That's the reason for Jarvis to have a slight robotic touch built in his voice- so Tony won't get his hopes up, so he won't break at hearing a dead man's voice.
With high heels.
She sighed. "Take it as a challenge then. Won’t you like to be the one who caught Iron Man? Or the one that overcame that sort of technology?"
Now she needed to talk with Tony before she pulled all of these strings.
The Scepter seamed to radiate this energy; it glowed with a power that Tony could feel all the way over here.
Our sneaky boi Tony trying to be a SHIELD agent, and Pepper is figuring out some shit of her own... or is she?
Poor Dr. Banner. Probably no one ever had a simple conversation like that ever since the Hulk thing.
"There is no need in that sort of action" Thor cut her off, cheerfully so.
Tony circled the room, almost getting to the door, his head facing the floor the whole time, trying to avoid the cameras. Loki almost smiled at that- Stupid mortals with their stupid problems, such as none-magic magic devices. He sometimes wondered how they could live in a world so naked of any magical artifact, no places to learn true witchcraft. In some way, Loki almost felt sad for them.
What was he supposed to tell Pepper now?
She left without another word.
And in that exact moment, Pepper Potts entered the living room.
"he sure was." And Banner told him his farewell, and Tony snuck away with the Scepter in hand.
Steve already informed Natasha that he wouldn't be attending today's meeting, because he got plans for tonight.
"Pause it!" Clint shouted, and Natasha did as he said.
So he turned away from the two Avengers and got into another room.
And with that, Tony and Banner went to their separate paths.
Steve only sighed in disappointment while giving him The Look ™.
"You looked happy!" Peter called out, making Harley come out of his room, "you are very happy!"
They deserved nothing less.
"I'll contact you. Is seven okay?" Steve nodded, and Iron Man nodded back.
This was getting complicated, because on the one hand- she didn't want to pry too much, she didn't want Tony thinking she was involving herself too much in his life, but on the other hand- she was scared for him, she really was. He wasn't doing well since they broke up, and she didn't know if he had found a solution or got himself into more trouble.
It was just so hard to stay focused like that- Steve, Captain America, his stupid, silly crush- that could never love him, obviously, the blood-soaked rag in his hand spoke plenty. It was humiliating, even. Not only he was crushing on Captain America (and couldn’t shut his mouth about it near the guy), but he is, most likely, the one and only person on the planet that would never have any chance of getting his feeling returned. The Captain, plain and simple, could never love him back. He was the guy that gave him all the work, all the headaches. He probably wanted to strangle him by hand or shoot his chest a couple of times.
Vigilante, Terrorist, Villain, Monster, The Merchant of Death- no matter all the nicknames he had, SHIELD was no closer to finding his real one.
Well. Time to get down to analyze some data it seems.
"Hey, Gary was it?" he heard from behind him, and he put on the fake smile again.
Hawkeye groaned into the comms in frustration, cursing to himself Iron Man and most of the world, as he had to change his shooting position, again.
"I thought we had something for a moment there." And with that final line, he flew away, disappearing at dawn.
"She did look a bit stressed. Maybe more than usual." Natasha replied, shrugging.
"It's Iron Man's file," he said with wide eyes, after a quick glance at the three pages the file contented. "Why give it to me?" he asked in a shaky voice, and Pepper couldn't exactly understand- was he excited as an engineer, to work on something like this, or was there another reason?
.' And the heavy breathing that was there all the while became steadier and steadier, and right before any of them could move, Iron Man flew away from their grip.
"the booty is the problem!"
She sighed. "As a matter of fact, we do," she answered. "We need to go through our last two fights with Iron Man"
She knew he might get all protective about this sort of thing, but why would he reject a job offer then?
Bruce furrowed his eyebrows. "She has a stressful job; of course she would be freaking out all the time. Who wouldn't?"
The suit's eyes were dark, as was the big hole in its chest. Steve grinned to himself. Finally, a successful mission.
So Tony went into the room, acting as if he owned the place, as if he belongs here.
The guy searched for what Tony assumed was his gun, but the suitcase made sure he won't be searching for anything for at least half an hour.
Of course, Steve just couldn't think something without anyone ruining the perfect image he had in his head.
"Het Pete," he said, shaking himself out of his worries for now, "whatcha' doin'?"
Maybe they should recruit that Daredevil guy.
Maybe some fresh coffee would help his case of a broken heart.
Everything happened very fast after that.
On the one hand, this was Captain America. The leader of a team designed to take people like him down.
"Tony, open up!"
Unfortunately, Iron Man noticed it as well.
As always, if you liked the chapter, please leave Kudos and comment, it encourages me to continue writing! if you have an idea, opinion, or if you'd like to point to any mistakes that are in the story, please do, and I'll keep everything in mind!
"I think you know why."
It was also obvious that Iron Man was attracted to men as well as women, given his constant flirting with Steve and Natasha. Steve was flattered and yet very much concerned, and Natasha- being Natasha- did not bat one well-kept eyelash in his direction. Steve could only hope whatever Iron Man had for them was either nothing but a tactic to throw them off their rhythm (which worked in Steve's case) or a simple, harmless crush. The last thing they needed was some powerful villain like Iron Man going crazy and starting killing people just to get their attention.
The television now showed them their first fight out of two they needed to go through, from a higher perspective- one filmed from a helicopter. SHIELD took the video, so they could hear the conversations and orders through the comms just as they happened on the battlefield, including Iron Man's chatter.
And then there was Iron Man. A foe? A friend? He couldn't tell. He saved Hawkeye's life twice, yes, but he was blowing up things all the time, like a terrorist.
And Captain America's big smile when he landed at his feet.
Clint crossed his arms, pouting before dropping them to his sides again.
"Shit shit shitshit…"
Tony opened it, and indeed- the bag was stuffed with chocolate and lollipops. He mentally laughed- those were his favorite, and Rhodey knew that.
Almost.
Most of these days, he didn't get The Itch, but from time to time, when he was feeling really down in the dumps, he would've wished for a bottle of some good whiskey.
He told as much to Thor earlier, but the god had pointed out that Clint threw himself off buildings all the time, so nobody will actually stop anything while he's at it.
Clint recalled three times which Thor wasn't around to catch him. One of them, the Hulk growled before crashing into him, breaking his nose but sparing him two broken legs.
"And why would he think that?" Natasha said, and Bruce looked up at her with one sassy eyebrow in the air and returned a sharp;
She groaned in annoyance. "We don’t have to see whatever meaningless tricks you got this time, Clint, so this better be important." She finished, and just before Clint could tell her that, actually, everything he does is important and majestic, Steve joined the fuss-
As if they had a previous home to begin with.
She nodded half-heartedly at him before getting the Iron Man file out of her purse.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Stane Industries has some leads." Was the first thing Pepper said to them, about the whole Iron Man case."
Steve had to stop the urge to stomp his foot on the ground in frustration.
He went to the kitchen, and made himself some coffee, even though his fingers itched for something stronger.
Maybe it's time to act like the guy who literally opened him doors- time to act like a Gary.
"It's a collaboration with SHIELD."
Natasha and Steve continued arguing in the kitchen while Clint sighed to himself quietly. He sat on the couch of their sort-of living room, in the Avengers area at the compound. The compound itself was huge but definitely not designed as a place where the best of Earth's freaks could gather in.
She kicked her ex in the stomach with high heels.
"Well, I gotta give this back to Fury. He seemed pretty furious back there, right?" he joked, and got the Scepter with a glove he found laying around the room.
Clint groaned loudly, loud enough to cause Thor to jump, now wide awake.
Hope you enjoyed it! The next chapter will be longer and with more interactions between characters. And, of course, a bit of The Avengers plot, but not too much. Please comment and leave Kudos, it encourages me to continue writing!
Almost.
Well, nobody will know if she did tell him…
"Like SLEEP?!"
"So, how's your man doing?" he asked and watched in amusement as Steve's brow furrowed in confusion while Nat rolled her eyes.
One by one, all but Banner cleared the lab. Tony pulled out his phone while they passed by, ducking his head all the while Fury and the Widow passed by him- the only two able of seeing that he didn't actually work there.
"I'm so sorry I'm late kiddo."
Pepper could feel her heart pumping in her chest while taking the elevator.
The last thing he heard from inside the suit, even though it was already flying away, was a faint "
AH! There's one, but he's talking to another guy. That's just unfortunate for the other one really, to be dragged into this mess.
She turned around to leave, and heard behind her Bruce ask, "There?"
Pepper, of course, knew what he was speaking of. The form, one she emailed them herself, listed many names- and she tried to look into the form, she really did, but she knew he couldn't temper with the names. She wanted desperately to take Tony's name off the very long list of people thee, but she knew SHIELD would track any changes back to her. She couldn't risk herself that way, because she wouldn't be able to help Tony at all if she was in SHIELD's custody.
So sorry for the long wait! I hope you liked the chapter, and if you'd enjoyed, please leave a comment and Kudos! it encourages me to keep on writing!
The only data she could gather about Tony's actual connection to the company was that his father, Howard (which Tony never spoke of), was one of the men to build the company. Tony then worked there for a couple of years, before being fired without any warning or reason, as much as she could see.
"Oh you know, your man- or should I clarify, your IRON Man? How's he doing?"
"Clint, shut your mouth and gear up, we need to catch him before he'll escape"
"Just so you know, Stevie-my-boi," Steve already looked so done with this shit, "that it was actually 42 mini marshmallows. Mama raised no coward."
She knew that a job like this could help him and his kids a lot, because after Harley and Peter's mother died he couldn't really get a stable one. She knew he built and repaired things to escape reality for a bit, to have some rest, and that this was the reason he became a mechanic in the first place- but maybe a good and stable job could help his mental state for the time being.
Virginia sighed in frustration. Iron Man would be the death of her, right after Tony.
Now he was searching for someone… not someone specific, just someone who was similar to him enough so he could steal their badge.
"I know- I know you said you hated this company,"
"Time will tell," came the vague reply, and the man was gone, the door shutting behind him and making an echo inside the room.
They all looked at each other, alarmed because of their recent discovery.
She could already feel another headache forming in her head.
Now, for the mission at hand…
So he ducked his head each time they passed the visible cameras and hoped that SHIELD was stupid enough to not place any other ones, ones that he won’t be able to locate.
Well, yeah, he could've easily flown back home, but where's the fun in that? Besides, Peter was sleeping at Ned's place and Harley was doing the same with his friends, so there wouldn't be anything else to do at home anyway.
Speaking of which, Harley and Peter just entered the front door- both with stupid smiles on their faces.
A good excuse, and yet Banner lift one eyebrow.
They never figured out if Iron Man himself upgraded the Armor, or if he had a mechanic to do it for him. The Iron Man weapon, it said, was changing each fight, each time seemingly more powerful or with more gadget. Frankly speaking, it seemed that whoever wrote it was very frustrated about having literally no material to work with- they just couldn't know where Iron Man was going with this.
Steve put a hand to his ear, wanting to warn Banner not to Hulk out near the Quinjet- but Iron Man beat him to it.
Why was he caring about a hero in the first place? He shouldn't. He's Tony Stark! Iron Man! He's their enemy!
Thank god he did that because on the last turn he had to make were the Black Widow and Captain America, talking strategy about what sounds to be against him, Iron Man.
Not that Rhodey would kill him, not physically- he would probably stare him to death. Which was one terrifying way to die.
He saved them, whether they knew this or not, a couple of times.
"Pep-"
"This is not the same file," Pepper noted, and Natasha nodded.
And hearing these two argue day and night about some tin-can gets boring after a while, and considering this
The suit of armor was getting closer. Iron Man was walking slowly towards him, intentions still unclear.
Why oh why, is this file always right in front of her when she doesn't need it, but on the one time she does it's gone?!
But Stane Industries- Stane Industries was a different case. Stane always had a too-tight grin plastered unnaturally on his face, and everything about him screamed 'fake'. Maybe he was just a liar, but Steve thought there was something bigger than that, he just felt it in his gut.
Switching topic lines is something Tony's very good at, but this was his eight years old son. He didn’t need to try any harder than that.
Clint nodded and picked up the sentence. "We are asking you to give us, as in SHIELD, a report about each individual. The list only contains about a dozen people; we need SI to give us its information about each one."
He reminded himself how proud was everyone he knew when he got through his ninth year without drinking alcohol.
"This is the fourth time this week!"
He took both badges, just because.
"The Hulk doesn't like smashing Iron Man," Bruce said after a long, silent pause while looking at the floor.
She dialed his number for the third time now- and he FINALLY answered his phone.
This train of thoughts was depressing and Tony didn't like that.
Steve fought the blush down. This had to stop, right now, and if they won’t get Iron Man in their grip he'll just fly away again, never to be seen until his next attack- and they really cannot have that.
The common room in there floor contained a television, a big' round table made of fine wood, and eight chairs. They had a kitchen and three restrooms. The other Avengers floor was the one above the common one and had their rooms and five more restrooms.
Discovery? Suspicion? Understanding?
"I hate this, I hate him. What kind of a monster attacks at four AM anyways?! I mean, doesn't he have something better to do?"
After about three hours, Steve stopped in his tracks and waited for Iron Man to show up.
"Listen, Iron Man! You can surrender now and come with us willingly, or we will have to use more force than necessary!" this was a long shot, and it never worked on the man before, but Steve didn't want to hurt the guy more.
"Thor, can you call Banner up here? I think he needs to hear this, 'cause you know-
" and the suit was out of his hearing range.
Steve couldn't help but blush every time he thought about the rather sweet things Iron Man told him.
The Black Widow whispered 'Banner!' in the comms, and the man turned greener slowly.
He missed tons of calls from Pepper and wondered if he should call her back- but decided against it since it was nearly three AM. She sent many text messages, too, all that read something about calling her back as fast as he could and that they had to talk, and as soon as possible.
Pepper took one look at the file and pulled the chair next to Natasha, sitting down herself. She dropped her bag on the table and took a closer look at the paper in her hands.
He put back his hearing aids, flinching at the sound of yelling coming from the kitchen and trying to ignore it at the same time- and obviously, failed to do as much.
"But what?"
Oh, joy.
The elevator to the Avengers common room dinged as she arrived, and Pepper blew out a breath she didn't know how much time she held in.
"You're an enemy to the Avengers, are you not?" he asked, voice and eyes sharp, digging into the man's back.
Bruce facepalmed while Natasha slapped both men across their heads for making the captain angrier and quite frankly, embarrassed.
She stepped out, her designer bag in her hand, and arriving exactly on time, as usual.
He had it coming, Tony reasoned with himself.
She learned after a while of checking in on them with Phil Coulson, their actual manager assigned by SHIELD, that they were not as perfect as some pictured. They were a wreck, a bomb ready to go off and blow in the world's face. It was a wonder they could keep it all to themselves because their issues were a very serious, potentially dangerous case. Cases. Too many issues tied to each one of them to be considered one case.
(See the end of the chapter for
Bruce and Thor arrived, and they all settled down while Clint explained how Iron Man saved him two times, and not by an accident.
It was late at night, both kids already ate and went to sleep, Harley staying two hours later then Tony liked to help him with a suit.
And Harley would probably giggle at the ironic situation and blow what little cover he had left at this point, so he was glad that his children weren't home right now.
"We're just going to see if we can get anything from the last two fights, and then you can go."
"What's up Pep, I'm busy." She sighed inwardly.
(See the end of the chapter for
want from you, either."
Natasha only smiled at him and told him to use a condom.
After three more hours, Harley was nodding off, so Tony insisted he should go to bed.
She shook her head mentally while frowning, and gave him the file. She hid almost every bit of information before she came over, and left only the important parts- the thing that an engineer like him would most likely find useful.
She was nervous, but you couldn’t tell that on her right now. She needed to look as calm as possible.
The Badge Guy's friend went unconscious immediately, but the target himself was just knocked away from the impact.
The cake was good and it seemed like everyone enjoyed themselves, so Tony was satisfied.
They went over their plan- each fight against this tin-can required a new one-, which now included one paralyzing arrow, courtesy of Stane Industries. The arrow would be able to shut down the Iron Man weapon, as Obadiah Stane himself told them on team briefing. Apparently, they were working on this arrow for months now, but only now it was ready for them to use.
And he hang up on her, the bastard.
But this was a man who blushed at the nicknames Iron Man gave him. This was Steve Rogers. And Steve Rogers was the one to smile at him so beautifully when he took off and flew away. And to go on a dinner with someone who cannot see your face, or know your name, would be one of the most challenging things for someone to do.
"What do you want now, Iron Man? There are no SI factories nearby! Why are you here?" he shouted up at the metal man in the sky.
Hawkeye, Clint as he insisted she called him, nodded his head towards her. "Thank you for coming, Pepper. We needed your insight on a form from Stane Industries, the one about potential enemies of the company?"
Maybe he should be glad that they were the only ones inside the room earlier.
"A job?"
With the Avengers relocating, he could have more time to cause trouble to SI without them on his tail, because they will be too busy adjusting to the new place.
This was a different one; he could already tell by the way that the door looked.
'KNEEL!'
He could at least thank god for Pepper arriving while Harley was out of the house to go pick up Peter from his friend Ned. He couldn't even start to explain to Peter who was Iron Man, and he really didn't want to. What if Peter hated Iron Man, and one day would find the mask just lying around in the house?
He got to this situation because a certain god decided to go easy on The Avengers and just be put in a holding cell, like a fucking idiot.
it's time to visit someone, and maybe it's for the best (Is it, though?)
Sorry for the long wait, I'll try to get the other chapters done quickly! If you enjoyed, please leave a Kudo and comment, it really encourages me to continue!
Maybe some hot chocolate would help his case of a broken heart.
Most importantly, for the moment at least, was
Tony, also Iron Man, was playing Galaga just in front of the Avengers, instead of analyzing data, as Gary should be. Poor Gary got into so much trouble over being at the wrong place at the wrong time.
Of course, it would never happen. This isn’t a love story, he reminded himself, no. this is more of a… tragedy. He could never have the man he loved, yet looked after him while attacking him as much as he could.
"And what would it be?" he asked her, and she wanted to scream at how tired and sad he looked like this- sitting in his chair like that, with an Ice pack on his stomach while waiting for her answer- "Pep?"
Pepper was supposed to attend for a short while today, at the common room of one of the Avengers floors.
He was a good man, and even though they broke up not too long ago, she wanted the best for him. He really does have a golden heart, and she knew that even if they weren't dating she wanted to keep it safe from any harm.
"Not only words, Thor my comrade!" he wiggled his eyebrows at the captain,
Honestly, Steve thought that Tower was too big, too ugly and really, too useless to be considered such a wonder. He didn't even understand how is it that Stane Industries would let them stay there- The company have been dealing with Iron Man related damaged for months now, and The Avengers were the ones hired to stop him- but they didn't, and yet the company let them stay at one of the best places in New York.
"Well, Director Fury asked me to bring him the Scepter for inspection. The Gem inside was an energy source, a bit like the Tesseract." Not a lie, a totally valid point, "so he wants us to analyze the energy source in a compartment to the both of them."
"I'm so sorry Dr. Banner, are you okay?" he asked, trying to help the scientist he just knocked down up on his feet.
Steve could never be too sure, not with a person like Iron Man. "So what exactly are you here for?" he asked, now softer.
"I knew it!" he heard Iron Man louder now. The man -the machine- was landing on the ground softly.
Iron Man noticed them, of course, but instead of facing them in a proper fight, he flew back, to the other area of the facility, which remained unharmed until this point.
Really, the man looked to be more and more peaceful at heart each fight they had. He didn't attack anyone on the team, only striking when he had to. And for some reason, Steve could almost see himself fighting side by side with the man, sharing these stupid jokes he said and the probably meaningless flirts together.
As if she wasn't busy.
Tony had to fake his smile at that.
So, new plan- taking this Scepter instead of the Tesseract, which was evidently not here. Maybe it had enough power to power up his machines, and maybe just some of them0- but it certainly was something.
Next chapter will be up pretty soon. as always, if you enjoyed this chapter, please leave Kudos and comment, it encourages me to keep on writing!
Iron Man tilted his head to the side, as in signing him that the man under the suit is thinking.
The thing was, that he would obviously be dead falling off buildings all the time with no help at all, and that's why he was glad he had a flying god/super-prince, if you will, Thor on his team, ready to catch him almost every time.
"You looked troubled, my friend," Thor explained when he asked him about the look, "you just don't look so deep in thoughts throughout your days, as you never seem to think that much at all. Is everything well?"
And of course, it seemed to work, the soothing robotic voice, the harmless position, everything- seemed to calm the Hulk just enough so Bruce would pass out, and Iron Man flew away from them, AGAIN.
But why would Tony be so mad about SI, mad enough to blow up their factories, if all this was only about being fired? As much as she knew, Tony didn’t have any anger issues…
Iron Man fully faced him now, too distracted by the captain to notice that Hawkeye was no longer in his eyesight. "Oh look! It's my favorite boy-band!" He shouted "oh, hey Widow, didn't see you there. Anyways, will you sign my repulsors?" Iron Man flew closer to them, and Steve could hear Hawkeye on the comms telling him that he was in a good position to shoot.
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony followed the jet that picked the Avengers up, the one that the Black Widow piloted, and managed to get on the Helicarrier with it.
He was so fucked.
Harley nodded, and thus the family of three started making lunch together.
Thankfully, the pissed off spied looked too damn stressful and angry to care about him for the moment.
He waited until everyone else left the room, a place more like a little hall, and put the armor back into suitcase mode.
Right at this moment, Harley was starting on rebuilding an older suit, one that had been severely damaged. He made sure that nothing was too damaged in the suit that Tony used today in the fight with the Avengers, or Earth's Dumbest Fuckers as he secretly called them, all the while Tony was hacking onto some SHIELD and SI servers in order to check for any new plans or surprises they had ready for him.
"What we
Peter said a very small 'sorry' before giving his dad the bag.
"We need better plans."
Though that couldn't stop him from worrying.
"That's because I am happy, Pete. But what about you? Are you happy?" he asked, but Peter frowned at him in return.
And of course, with his luck, this had to be the Avenger Bruce Banner- the Hulk.
(See the end of the chapter for
Pepper was sure that her ex was hiding something.
Here it is! Thank god…
But he really wanted to pay them a visit, too, and he couldn't do that if he attacked SI in the near future.
As much as Tony wanted to stay and hear more of the gossip about how awesome and undefeatable he was, he couldn’t take the risk of getting caught with the Scepter in hand, and a Badge not his.
"Why don’t you ask him yourself?"
Thor grumbled that he 'had to do everything on this planet' whatever he meant by that, before going to the labs to call Bruce.
It was hard, but he stopped for his kids. He was drunk almost every other week, and he couldn't take it anymore- because he saw how Harley was looking at him, sadness and fear for his father coming up every time he saw his father drink another bottle. The kid grew up mostly with Rhodey taking care of him, so now, when Tony was constantly sober, he treated both his kids as best as he could.
This chapter is happening at the same time as chapter seven.
"Are you sure, Tony? This is really not a big deal for me, I won’t be in any problem for doing this for you, you know that right?" well, almost no trouble. She might get a few more frowns, but she was the female boss of many sexist men- she could pull this one off.
"Alright. I will look at it, of course, and will come back to you about what SI has on them. I will have to talk to Mr. Stane about it, of course, but I don't believe it will be a problem. This is likely to take a couple of days, so I will contact you." Pepper replied, taking a final look at the list before picking her bag from the table, and standing up. "Will that be all?" she asked, in the same manner she would ask Stane himself.
Steve raised his shield, and Iron Man stopped in his place. "I don't want to fight you," Steve told him, "but…"
Loki pointed to a door in the far corner of the room, his face not giving up anything, not one emotion. But if Tony would've looked closer, his eyes gave the story up- he was curious about this human, so confident while in danger that Loki was sure was coming for him.
Iron Man decided to ruin his good reputation by continuing his attacks on Stane Industries, causing a million dollars' worth of damage to the place and the products.
Next to the villain, inside the Quinjet, Steve could see Bruce getting up, his eyes already turning one shade greener.
"You don’t happen to know where the exit is, do you?" he asked theoretically, even though he guessed the god knew more then he let on.
Clint's eyes turned to look at Banner. "What did he mean, 'happy to see you again'?"
Of course, the Captain was the leader of the group that hunted him down, so it was obvious that he would smile at such moment- but it still stung a bit.
Fuck, that was so weird.
“You haven’t told Tony yet, have you?” Pepper said quietly.
Pepper frowned as Natasha blinked at it. “Your phone never rings,” Pepper said.
“Have you made an appointment with our counselors?” Fury asked, voice severe.
Tony made a small, sad whine in the back of his throat—and it was a calculated noise, Steve
Tony, who had stood up and begun walking towards the door, stopped. Turned around.
“Yes, Tony,” Steve muttered.
This was his first big, major case, and he had been looking forward to completing it. It was the first real test of his ability to investigate and help others.
—no omega should be between two alphas who were fighting, and so Steve grasped at Tony’s waist, meaning to set Tony aside and tear Rumlow a new one, when Tony’s fingers laced with Steve’s and stroked over the back of his hand. “Gentlemen, please tell me we are not fighting over the remote,” Tony said, and this voice was not one Steve had ever heard Tony use—throaty and husky, almost playful, and more than a little…
After a few moments of silence, Ste-Virn stood up and stretched, letting his back crack and his shoulders pop. “Meet me tomorrow at the spaceport, and we’ll hitch a ride over to Rodia and begin investigating together.”
Again, this was an actual café, and Clint had in fact served more than a few customers today, yesterday—hell, he’d been here almost a full month. There were two other customers, a businessman and a young college student, both of whom were ensconced in different corners of the café, each buried in their favored electronic. Stark, while out of place, was not alone in assuming this front was just another coffee place.
“Is that Steve?” Natasha murmured.
It took Steve perhaps too long to realize exactly what that look was, but after he had done just a cursory check, he glanced at Tony a second time and realized what it meant. “Oh, do you have any experience with computers?”
your new team members, excluding Banner and our Asgardian envoy,” Fury cut in to say.
“There’s, fuck, there’s a whole universe out there, and we knew that, of course we knew that, but they’re so much more advanced and they are
“Oh look, that’s Clint,” she said absently, and hung up the phone.
. You didn’t get checked over in medical, you didn’t have anyone to make sure you were okay—” Natasha began.

“C’mon, I know ya. Th’ only one who mightta known ya better is Megarann. Y’ never, like, made a move or anythin’, an’ with his speech an’ behavior, I know why, but that doesn’t change that ya found ‘im attractive. Still do.

was mistreated, but SHIELD isn’t supposed to do that shit. You need to report that. You
“I’m on my way,” Steve said immediately. “You’re by Central Park, aren’t you?”
He was better than this, and being upset about the past was not conducive to living in the present.
…Saark was a Jedi Knight. A grown being. He knew his mind, and knew what he was getting into. He knew Ste-Virn had a way to track him. He trusted that Ste-Virn would be able to follow him and get the evidence that was needed in order to shut down this company, and stamp out much of the whole operation.
Barton hopped off the counter, and Steve watched as Tony almost flinched—but held himself completely still.
The usual boring news about corrupt politicians and shit changed to- what IS that?
Tony cursed to himself.
"But this job can really help you, Tony. It's exactly your type of thing, it really fits you- you would be perfect for this one, I swear!"
A good time to put on the suit, isn't it?
Iron Man.
Not much was written there- only upgrades that were used in fights, things he said or his obvious fondness towards the Captain were there.
She noticed Thor, the one farthest away from her nodding off.
How can Tony not smile at that? Peter was radiating innocence like the sun radiated heat.
"And why not?"
Tony was hiding behind a box on the Helicarrier, trying to hide long enough so the people could go away.
His thoughts wandered to their last fight. He was almost taken down, and he remembered the fear, no, the PANIC he felt when the reactor shut down.
Clint gaped in shock at the sass coming from the thousands of years old alien sitting next to him, but then remembered that he should probably tell everyone else about his…
"Not happy like that, daddy!" he squeaked. "You were happy-happy! Like when you were with Pepper!"
"I really missed you all, you know? However, I need you to leave now. I really don't have the time to fight you all right now, so please- this time just go. I'll owe you one." His electronic voice said, and even though it was very robotic to the point of no recognition, Steve could still hear the panic over it.
For Tony.
(A possibility that chilled Steve to the bone, he actually shuddered at the thought of a limp suit in his arms, completely lifeless and silent-), and the other possibility- the second and last one, the one which he preferred yet tried to avoid altogether. A possibility, where the Avengers did win over Iron Man, but instead of killing him on the spot will bring him to justice, jail maybe- or again, death or his actions.
Tony scratched his nose, just so he could hide his face with his hand when he passed a security camera, and got close to the Badge Guy and his friend. Separating them from each other was now useless, so he decided to go big, and so he swung the heavy suitcase in his hand at their heads.
Due to voice filters, and high boots, SHIELD could not know if they were dealing with a smart, short man or a child inside the suit, but the team believed it was indeed a man.
He continued to stare at his son's eyes with that little smile, and Peter gave up.
"-CLINT! Focus on the mission, and complain later. We have to be faster this time around, no distractions." Steve heard himself say, and almost immediately regretted these words as all of his teammates looked at him with disbelief in their eyes.
"What's the rush?" he shouted at the man, "you're not going anywhere!" and under his voice he whispered quickly, "Hawkeye, take the shot!"
And would you look at that- there was an unoccupied position for an engineer on the Iron Man case. She would have to talk directly to both Stane and Fury to get this one, but she knew that Fury feared her and that Stane needed her desperately, so it wouldn't be a problem.
"I know you would, so I brought you all that I can."
The other two… the other two were on missions against Iron Man.
"What do you say?"
"Sorry Pep, I don't think I'll take you on that offer."
The world held their breath when the figure, which turned to be Iron Man himself, came back from the wormhole in one piece, falling rapidly back to the ground.
"Oh, I just might- but you, you're not a real SHIELD agent, are you, human? Why would an ordinary, pathetic, human-like you would need MY Scepter?" Loki hissed at him, walking closer to the glass that separated them.
Steve shook his head as if it will help getting those awful thoughts out of his head for good. It didn't, of course, so he got up and went to the kitchen.
Tony…
Hawkeye lurking somewhere high, Steve on the field, Natasha on the ground, waiting for the best moment to attack, Thor, unfortunately, back on Asgard (he hadn't come back since the whole Chitaury business, and Steve was starting to get worried.) And Bruce, sitting in the Jet, ready to jump in and fight at any giving moment.
His voice cracked through the suit, half-robotic and the other half not passing through the machine.
"You don't want to destroy your only ride home, right?" he asked skeptically, and Bruce looked sheepishly at Steve's direction while stepping closer to Iron Man, who backed away in return.
He blinked and started the coffee machine.
And in those missions, the rest of the Avengers team hot on his tail, Iron Man was the one to catch him and quickly drop him somewhere close enough to the ground, leaving Hawkeye very much confused but luckily, very much alive.
"Clint, I swear to god," Natasha started,
Steve thinks until he gets a headache, and Pepper is trying her best, really.
she wanted to add, but that was classified.
"I know about the file you are referring to. What did you want me to see?" she asked and was handed the copy by Natasha, sitting to her left around a big, round table.
Peter giggled and Harley let out a breathy laugh- "It's MEMES, dad, and no- we were, uh, just hanging around…"
Steve shot him a quick 'Language' before swinging his shield at Iron Man, the loud sound of metal on metal colliding as Iron Man was thrown back from the impact, just next to the Quinjet. The others ran toward them, and Iron Man threw the shield aside and got up, a new dent in his abdomen.
He hacked some SHIELD files the other day and was surprised to see that the weapon they used on his was a simple, paralyzing arrow.
Thirdly, he didn't want to take the case she gave him about Iron Man…
Right at the end of the video, Clint tensed.
"You can have one each, for now. You can pick what you want, and that's it for today- I don't want you getting your tummies full before dinner, got it?" and Peter smiled so brightly at his, Tony could feel himself smile too.
Secondly, he was recently, as in the past few months, going away more and more. Rhodey even called her and told her that he thought Tony got involved with the mob, or in some fight club, because of some odd injuries he noticed Tony had.
"What are you hiding over there, mister?" Tony came with a lopsided grin towards his son.
"Uncle Rhodey gave us candy!" he breathed out as if he was giving national secrets up.
"Your place or mine?" he asked with a smile, and he could swear that the suit looked relieved.
Tony didn’t realize how long he was staring at the wooden floor of his house, up until he noticed his son, Peter, staring at him with a wide grin and wide eyes, unmoving.
Now, he was treating the wound he got today in the fight while trying not to think of how his heart ached more than his bleeding abdomen.
He thanked God he wasn't a mean drunk like his father was, and that he never got violent with his child. He couldn’t even think of what he would've done to himself if he would have laid a finger on Harley, he just couldn't.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Well, I have to get back to work now. I will hopefully see you soon."
She sat down, trying to figure out what was going on with him by focusing on all the data she has.
Harley, being his eldest son and the only other person to know of him being Iron Man, was his assistant in almost everything that involved the Iron Man suits. He came up with safety protocols, and cool gadgets his father should have in the suit to help him fight and was the number one fan of Iron Man out there- not that there was very much of a competition, with Iron Man being a villain of the Avengers.
The Avengers notice him, and he didn’t want them to. There were simply too many other agents in this room to fight against, so he had to be quick about his plan to get the Tesseract- quick and careful before anybody would notice.
"I suggest a dinner, then. No attacking, no missions." The static voice sounded almost hopeful, as in hesitating to ask- and Steve felt a pang of pity in his chest. Or maybe it was hope too, Steve couldn’t tell for sure.
"He thinks it's wrong."
He could almost see a future together, him and Iron Man- or more likely, him and the man behind Iron Man.
'Oh yeah, the Iron Man armor is so lame, any kindergarten could have cracked that thing. What kind of employees do you HAVE, Pep?'
Where are you where are you where are you?
"At least try, Tony."
She opened the Iron Man file, which was one of the lightest, thinnest ones SHIELD has.
With his enchanted hearing, Steve was able to hear the voice of an English man coming from inside of the suit. He thought that it was Iron Man himself, but the slight robotic touch to it made it sound more like a robot than a human person. The robotic-English-voice was speaking, telling the man to '
The party was fun, as much as a Blue and Red themed party for an eight-year-old can be, (Peter insisted that those were his favorite color and that he wanted to
"I found you a job, Tony."
Who even needed a personal assistant these days?
She turned around briefly to say these couple of words: "your new home, The Avengers Tower."
, Steve, is better equipment. Iron Man had no idea what weapon we were going to use, yet he still managed to run away. No plans are going to help with that, Steve! Stane Industries is one hell of a sponsor, but not nearly enough against this guy!"
Iron Man wasn't here to fight or threaten him, Steve understood after a bit.
"Okay, here goes nothing, then!"
"Whoa, there, Banner, I'm really happy to see you again, I don’t think seeing the other half of you is quite necessary." He said, his hands held in front of him with caution as if he was trying to calm an animal down.
So yeah, Virginia didn’t have the best day today.
On the TV, he watched the Avengers arrive at the new, flashy, Avengers Tower.
When the kid almost drank the motor oil beside him, Tony put a stop to that nonsense and sent him to bed.
And despite all of the surprises they had, Hulk catching the vigilante did not give the world a shock. Instead, it warmed most of the people on earth's hearts. A good in the Evil, they said about Iron Man now.
He got the static response he was waiting for. "I was just looking for you, capsicle! And don't you tell me you didn't miss me as much as I did you!"
"You know how I feel about Stane Industries, and no offense, I'd hate to work under Stane."
Loki smiled a real smile for the first time in hours in this place. This man could be an allay, he thought to himself, and his smile grew even wider when the alarm started blaring and shouts were heard from outside of his room.
"You're very smart, Gary. Why aren't you working for something more than analyzing data? You could go places."
He didn't expect an answer, but received one anyway.
The Chitaury invention went horrible, in everyone's opinion. The humans on Earth just discovered how much they were not prepared for any attacks from space, and the Avengers were considered heroes now more than ever. People started digging into their past, asking all sorts of questions- from will they continue to fight ordinary, human villains such as Iron Man, or will they be focusing on Aliens more, to what exactly was the relationship between Hawkeye and the Black Widow.
He went down the hall, and once getting out of Banner's view, started to check out the path in front of him, Scepter behind his back and as hidden as possible.
So The Itch stopped, but Tony was still going to contact his sponsor in the morning.
That means Hawkeye was his main target now- not to kill, because he couldn't bring himself to kill any of them. But he'll have to keep an eye out for that Hawk. and maybe stop catching him every time he throws himself off a building.
Virginia couldn't find it.
"It's so good to see you, Pep" Tony said after he got himself an ice pack, "but next time, please wait a couple of minutes before you start kicking things, okay?"
The common room filled with Iron Man's heavily filtered voice.
"I may not have the team with me right now, but believe me- targeting only one member wouldn’t get you anywhere." He spoke, now in his normal tone, hoping that he somehow managed to sound intimidating.
Tony himself stayed up all night hacking into files and rebuilding his old suit.
"Can you move it back?" Clint almost whispered, and Natasha nodded before moving the feed to show Bruce, about to Hulk out next to the Quinjet. Iron Man was next to him, trying and succeeding in calming him down.
She could practically hear the gears turning in his head from the other side of the phone.
"Yeah, it's fine. But you need to be careful running around like that…" Banner searched for the nametag, and Tony held it up, "…Gary. Are you going through there?" he asked, pointing at the door that leads to where the original Gary worked at.
"What's up kiddos? Did you and your friends created more… mee-mees?"
"Yeah, nice to see you again Dr. Banner."
The Avengers were arguing, but it was basically Fury against all the four of them. Tony didn't know where Hawkeye was, but the Black Widow seemed sad- maybe he was injured? Captured?
Well, it's time to pay her ex a visit.
Again.
This was a horrible situation.
"Clint-"
When they all started arguing inside one of the labs, he realized something crucial- the Tesseract was not here. There was a scepter- Loki's Scepter, just besides Banner. This was so bad.
'Whoa, there, Banner, as much as I'm happy to see you again, I don’t think seeing the other half of you is quite necessary.'
Then, Bates looked at the anxious-looking Peter, “The young lad didn’t want to share his daddy, but I’m sure you wouldn’t have a problem with that, right, Captain? I hear you already have a lover. Your loss is my gain and all that.”
“Thor.” All of them replied as one, easily ignoring Tony. Some were bitter about it (Clint), some apparently nonchalant (Natasha), some reluctantly happy (most) and some ecstatic (Thor and Jan).
matter.”
“Possessive much?” Tony probably intended that as a rhetorical question, but Wanda’s magic apparently couldn’t distinguish such a concept and forced him to answer anyway.
“Hey, guys, coffee’s ready…” Just when Steve wanted to make Rhodes understand, possibly by shaking him a little or perhaps a punch here and there, Tony came in with three cups of coffee. Apparently, the atmosphere was so suffocating that even Tony caught on that something was off. “Everything alright over here?”
"...I am," Tony finally replied, looking intently and directly in Steve's eyes. The storm in his dark blue eyes finally settling down and allowing the calm of Steve's sky-blue ones reflect on them, "
Probably the moment he met Tony fucking Stark, that’s when.
Not knowing what else to do and finally finding himself alone, Steve hurried to dress as he had never rushed before to go to Tony's rescue. It was a matter of time before the Avengers realized that they were both hexed and started to have fun at their expense. But first, he had to collect all of his and Tony's clothes.
“Well, at least you put the emphasis in “cheated” and not in the “Steve” and the “you” part,” Tony observed forlornly, looking away from Rhodey now. “Clint is an ass.” He finished as if that explained his comment. And maybe it did.
Such different beings found each other not long after Steven started working in the stables. They started to seek each other’s company since Steven, skinny as he had been back then, had saved the young noble from an uncontrolled horse accident.
Wow, could this be more of a DRAMA?! Still, I hope you liked it! I wanted Steve and Tony to have a conversation right away, but it just wouldn't happen... don't worry, no matter what, I plan to make the next chapter my last one... I'll try VERY hard to not make it longer, especially since it wasn't that popular, hehe, which I understand, cause it was horribly written, really.
, Steve thought,
“Um, no, not at all,” Steve conceded curiously. “Go ahead.”
about Tony in some way-”
, shall we?” this time, Rhodes sounded more hesitant. Steve didn’t mind the tone too much, so he lighted up again; that was more than what he thought he would get out of the meeting, anyway. He’d learned to appreciate the small victories. “Now stop wasting my time and go wherever superheroes-that-are-not-Tony go in their free time, Rogers.”
When he caught sight of the arc reactor, he couldn’t help but halt his clothes-removing-actions and kiss tenderly around it, just like the first time they’d made love. This artifact was the reason Tony’s heart was still beating and he couldn’t be more grateful for its existence.
“Normally, I would agree, but this is
doesn’t know when to shut his bloody trap!”
“I just realized that we never really talked about it.”
“You're right; he mentioned something like that.”
“You’re kidding, right?” When she saw the honest confusion on Steve’s face, she let an exasperated sigh leave her mouth. “I sometimes forget that you're older than a dinosaur. Have you never heard the saying ‘boyfriends come and go, but friends are forever’, more commonly known as ‘bro’s before ho’s’? No? Right. Well, something that has changed a lot since the 40’s would be the appreciation of friends, especially since divorces started to be so common. People realized that your friends stick with you no matter what but a romantic relationship can end with just a stupid quarrel.”
Lieutenant Colonel Rhodes answered the phone at the first ring. His voice tight and sharp.
“I give up!” Rhodey said dramatically – something he learned from all the time of being friends with Tony –, making a show of going to fetch his phone, “I’m calling Pepper.”
Tony felt the air leave his lungs in tormenting relief. Steve had come for Peter. Steve had really cared for Peter in all the ten years that they had been married. Without being able to help it despite the horrible timing, the realization lifted a weight over Tony’s heart and brought a little peace of mind to his nightmares.
“No! You don’t get to call me that when you know
As if waiting for his cue, the lights went abruptly down at the exact same moment that the window nearest to them went shattering in a rain of sharp glass and, a second later, gunfire started going off all around Tony; miraculously the gun at his back was spared from the action. It seemed they weren’t going to shoot at him without a direct order. Nice to know.
“No, I called him.” Steve confessed which made Tony blink his eyes in surprise. “Yeah, I asked JARVIS his mobile phone number, but apparently he already had mine because he knew it was me the moment he answered.”
Pepper confessed in a dark tone.
More background building for the main, sorry about that. I hope you guys still liked it and that you'll leave tons of comments and kudos to inspire me to edit faster.
Rhodes made a pointed cough in order to startle them so that they would have to turn around to face him. No walk of shame would be made in his apartment without Rhodey enjoying it. Even if Tony looked smug, Rogers appeared quite tense and mortified. Good.
It was all it took for Steve to reposition themselves on the couch. He turned them both so Tony had his back on the cushions, giving Steve the chance to pin him down with only his weight. Steve looked at Tony intently without moving, he waited till Tony’s eyes opened searching for his own sky blue; impatience and frustration at the sudden halt of the movement were easily read all over his face. That’s when he decided to thrust into Tony slowly, carefully.
”, he insisted with more force.
“Tony, I don’t want to sound crude–”
One day late, sorry about that! I still hope that you enjoy this.
“You can’t be serious,” Tony disagreed while slowly shacking his head. “Steve’s the best thing that’s ever happened to me.”
“What can I say? I’m a handsome omega.” Anthony half-joked because they both knew how true that was. “But you never led me to believe you were that possessive.”
And before the whole sentence leaved his mouth, Steve could hear the constant bip of his phone’s line indicating the dead line.
annoying – if War Machine showed up and killed his boyfriend because of mediocre paparazzi work. He took a deep breath and chuckled at the article again. The probability of it being true and he not knowing it by now was really slim. If it weren’t Tony calling him – which admittedly wasn’t all that common – then it would be Pepper letting him know of his role in the national icon’s demise while she was effectively tying up the last loose ends on the Judgment Day that would be about to fall upon Rogers.
It was enough for Steve.
"I agree," Steve conceded easily with a snort, “Then again, that is only when you absolutely
An awkward silence followed and Steve fidgeted a little, "Sorry, you probably don't want to talk about it-"
“Captain, let’s get something clear,” the moment those words left Rhodes lips, Steve knew he was due to long series of calming, just-don’t-kill-him breaths. “I really didn’t know Howard Stark; I was introduced to him by Tony once and I spotted him in a couple of events from afar. Let me tell you something, I didn’t need to know him, or hear the guy out, or read about him on the newspapers or anything to hate his guts; I only needed to know how Tony was doing his best to kill himself over impossible tasks while trying to make a father that wouldn’t even bother to give his son the time of the day for something other than complaints and disappointment.
Crown Prince Bruce was quite dense if he couldn’t see the sheer terror on his brother’s face at the mere idea. Steven wanted nothing else but to push the touchy noble away from his beloved and enclose him in his arms just to never let go. Instead, the young future king led his beautiful wife away after the proper courtesies were exchanged and exited the stable.
Her tone made a drastic change as she said that; she was serious. Death serious.
This time, Steve couldn't found the energy in him to do anything but let Tony leave. He then allowed himself to collapse on a chair by the table with an enormous sigh. When he stopped hearing Tony’s hurried footsteps, he put one hand over his eyes while the other pulled not-too-gently at his hair.
Jan thought he was crazy. As in
Rogers glared at him with defiance while going after Tony who was shouting after him. The blond crossed the door and closed it behind him, finally interrupting their death-staring contest.
Steve tried to keep the disappointment away from his expression when Wanda Maximoff announced the bad news.
“But the fact that you’re here implies a certain amount of-”
But the happiness brought out by his amazing morning replaced the negative feelings in an instant for an impossibly happier thought; he surely had amazing people surrounding him.
“Really? Would you do that for me? I would really appreciate that.” Steve thanked relieved that he was going to let this situation on very capable hands. For a moment, he understood plainly Tony’s appreciation for the redhead.
“Isn’t that great, man?” Tony prompted squeezing Steve a little. “I think I can finally go steady. Well, if that’s what Cap wants, of course.”
It didn’t take long for Pepper to send him a short message with the date, time and place where he was expected to meet the Colonel. She didn’t even write him to say if Rhodes was aware of the meeting or not, only to ‘be punctual’.
“What can we do for my lords?” James asked probably to avoid any slip from Steve when he was jealous. Bucky was a beta, sure, but he understood how alphas worked thanks to living with Steven and to being punched by Sharon more times than he could count.
“That’s exactly what the boss said you always say when he tells you you’re sulking!” the chauffer remarked with an easy laugh full of amazement. “But before we touch the subject, you should probably get in the car first. Rhodey will literally kill you if you are late. And let me tell you, Captain, America’s biggest hero is not having a painfully death under my watch.”
But he had to know.
(See the end of the chapter for
Nothing but Anthony’s good reflexes saved him as he rolled the moment he made contact with the ground and lashed out to the wolf's snout with his torch, eliciting an angry and wounded bark from the animal as the blow landed directly on its eye.
“You’re asking for a truth serum.” It wasn’t a question.
“Whatever keeps my mind at ease.” Rhodes finished ruffling Tony’s hair just to spite him. “How about that coffee you offered just before you dropped that bomb-of-news on my face?”
"How? After you said that, I can't also think about much else but how I should be inside you," Steve confessed, a little unwillingly, but it was something that he could admit in any situation. However, he wasn't willing to continue, "You feel amazing, I want to take you apart piece by piece and then put you back together over and over until you're as addicted to me as I am to you."
“Get off me…” Tony ordered resignedly after a full minute of stubborn silence when he seemed to admit to himself that Steve wouldn't move until he got his way. Instead, he tried to put some distance between them with a tight grip on Steve’s shirt. At this point, Steve was grateful at the connection rather than put off by it.
After all this time of knowing each other, after all these months doing
That provoked another laugh from Rhodey, the same one that died as soon as he saw that Tony was still on the depressed side despite his efforts to hide it.
They were in an empty warehouse but for a pile of boxes on the far corner away from the entrance and the two desks and two tables full of things Steve haven’t ever seen before and knew better than to ask about.
“Tony, it will be a really damn freaky day when I don’t spend at least five minutes of my short free time - thank you for that, by the way- worrying about what idiocy you decided to do that day.” Rhodes said, deciding to ignore Tony’s last words. Steve didn’t want to jump to any conclusions, but he couldn’t help but feel that the Colonel's response was probably a way of telling Steve to ‘back the hell off’ from the conversation. And by
“And which is so not my point–”
“I covered for your ass so you could go and play with the Royal Fire all night, so now you must cover
“Yeah, about that, I want to know why it means that much to you. You feel good when someone attempts against your ego or something?”
“Can we help you?” he asked cautiously at their neutral expressions.
It seemed that Steve really lost this round. He was done. He couldn’t take it anymore; the physical closeness, the emotional fortress around Tony's heart, the lies, the hurtful words, the screaming at each other, the draining of his physical and mental energy with every word. He let Tony go completely, finally deciding to let Tony have his desired space in order to pace around the kitchen, even at risk of Tony fleeing. He was again glad that it was three thirty in the morning and no matter the decibels of their yelling, it was highly unlikely that someone would step in on them.
Steven could recognize the imploring eyes on Anthony’s face anywhere, but this time, they were directed to his lover’s half-brother, who seemed to be considering the situation.
“I’m hurt!” Tony exclaimed while making an exaggerated grab at his arc reactor. Steve couldn’t help but chuckle at his lover’s antics. “That’s just mean, using Pepper for your stalker ways.”
be together, Steve!”
“I love you,” Steve whispered again in Tony’s ear when they were both expended. Steve had rearranged their positions so that he was now with his back on the couch with Tony mostly on top of him, the brunette’s arc reactor shining softly between them, “So much.”
” He finished with a slap to his forehead in regret.
Stunned at his words, Tony just seemed able to stare at him in contemplation. Or was that adoration? Steve hoped for the last because he was sure that's the way he was gazing upon Tony.
"Thanks, Happy", Steve said as he got into the limo and on the copilot seat so Happy could close the door behind him. Steve thought he may have imagined the little pleased smile that flashed on the driver’s face as he rounded the car to get on the pilot’s seat. For what? Steve would never know.
Anthony searched for Steven’s eyes and this time, the aristocrat didn’t try to break the eye contact between them. Steven could read the apology all over his face, the resignation.
by the idea of you two meeting.”
“Why does Tony's friends always think that something’s wrong with him?” Steve asked with humor. He figured it would be best not to lead this conversation anywhere near to a repetition of the call with Rhodes, so he has started with a little humor. But this time he wasn’t nervous; this was Pepper. Pepper
“I appreciate the consideration, but as honoured as I am by such a proposal, I must humbly decline, as I rather enjoy riding by myself.” Anthony declined gently and with all the diplomacy that he carried in his blood. Steven was always bemused to witness it.
But Jarvis and JARVIS were a whole different package.
“Bates, I’m warning you, let my husband go. I won’t say it again.” Steve threatened. Peter looked from his stepfather to the villain, to his father, looking by all means like he didn’t have a clue of what to do, but not willing to be the one to screw things up and get his father killed.
“Tony, listen to me-”
to cover it,” He agreed easily, relieved that her doubting was over. “But I'm no saint. I think I deserve exactly what I'm getting, considering our history of painful up and downs. I'm just out of options. But the important thing out of all this interrogation is that this means you’re going to help me, right?”
Looking at the horses’ impatience, Steven realized how late he was and he finished stuffing the last of the animal food faster. “Now, come on! We are late for everything, give me a hand.”
"I sure did, thanks for asking." the genius replied with a smirk firm on his face even if he seemed to have trouble getting his shirt on.
can't be? You’re telling me that you want me to leave you alone for good?”
“God Tony,” Steve groaned appreciably when Tony rubbed himself over Steve’s still covered manhood in order to accommodate in a position over the blonde’s lap that allowed the genius to nag Steve for his honest belief in his stupidity. “If it were for me, you would always be hard and naked. I will never get tired of looking at you like this. ”
?" Steve asked, not understanding what the small woman was talking about, "what's a shovel talk?"
!” he repeated as if Tony was so stupid that he couldn’t grasp the concept.
“Peter, get away from him!” Tony yelled at his son in terror. No, please, Peter was just beside the Winter Soldier; he was going to kill his son just as he had killed his parents in cold blood, “Now!”
And here came the hard part “Um, were you– are you aware that the Colonel, well, you know-”
It was a good thing that Tony had reinforced all the furniture in the tower in an almost unsuccessful attempt to stop buying a new living room every week. Steve didn't even notice when his hands stomped over the surface of the kitchen table, making everything on it jump. Tony didn't even blink, instinctively trusting Steve not to hurt him, but he stayed silent and tense.
And Steve knew that, but now he had a lifetime of opportunities to make amends.
"It surely wont." Rhodey made sure that his eyes were looking directly to the super soldier as he said this. No question in his words. The colonel's threat matching the determination reflected in the blue eyes.
“Why do we not hasten our steps so we do not lose more time of this lovely morning, gentlemen? We only have one hour, after all.” Anthony asked in another attempt to keep the attention away from Steven. The blonde appreciated the effort to protect him, but it only made him angrier.
“I cannot care less if you are an alpha or whatsoever-!” Anthony interrupted a little too high pitched to be casual to Steven’s ears, he even kicked off some of the hay on the floor in a very un-princely way. The blonde knew he was trying to keep the attention on himself, but it was too late; the two lords were now eyeing with disgust at Steven being restrained by Bucky.
"Oh, yeah? And how does that works, Rogers? You may be the perfect golden boy, so I'm sorry to tell you this, but a relationship consist in
In the other hand, Tony was used to play his part for the whole world to see and didn't care much about the theatrics he had to pull in a social convention. Not that Steve cared much about what unkown people thought of him, hence wanting to come out to the world, but Steve knew that Tony’s real 'whole world’ was a little restricted; there was his friends, Jarvis, his creations –which included JARVIS, the bots and SI–, the Avengers and himself.
“Captain,” Scarred-face greeted with a pleased smile, as if he felt no pressure from the situation he was in. In contrast, Steve looked murderous and ready to rip him apart limb for limb. Yes, that was exactly the look that Peter had mirrored moments ago that had surprised Tony so.
The annoyed groan that James made was enough to make Steve laugh. “Nothing, man! I’ve tried everything to court her proper and she just refuses to look my way!”
to remember why he should be
“What?!” Peter jumped at the order trying to go round Steve, but he got his son by the shoulder at his side in a smooth movement, “You can’t do that! I won’t forgive you!”
“Oh my
"Longing, rusted, seventeen...” Bates started to chant, and Tony could only look as Barnes started to lose his control over himself, grabbing at his head as if it was hurting, “...daybreak,-”
Before Tony could do anything more than to gape at his son in action without his suit, the genius was being dragged back by both thugs that still got their tight grip on him. However, it wasn’t even two steps back that both soldiers were yanked away from him; the first by one of Peter’s webs and the next by the force of two well-aimed knives; the first one went through the soldier’s hand that was aiming his gun at Peter with a sickening sound of cartilage breaking, the other encrusted in the thug’s neck probably before he could even register the pain from his hand.
Now, Steve was a soldier himself, so he knew how hostile some of his fellow soldiers could get over a simple misunderstanding, except Steve could not think of a moment with the Lieutenant Colonel when such a thing could have happened. He wracked his brain and yet the results always ended with not a single clue popping up in his mind because, once again, he had only ever talked to the man about the Avengers… and maybe about Tony.
like that. The first thing he would do was wipe that pleased smirk off the duke's face.
“Not my husband anymore, Thug-number-one,” Tony couldn’t help but remind everyone in the room of that
A massacre had also taken place outside but wasn’t yet completely finished, which seem to distract his captor but for a second. No longer afraid to die in front of his son, Tony immediately took his chance and head-butted Bates with all he got left. Tony got enough leverage to barely avoid the first shot at where his head had been a millisecond ago. Finally, adrenaline was taking over his body and his body was battle-ready in a second. Except, in that same second he seemed to forget that his hands were still tied behind his back, so his victory was inevitably short-lived. He seemed to have missed Bates’ nose and the goon had recovered quickly enough to kick the genius right on the butt before he could turn to face the soldier and he lost his balance. Tony fell face-first onto the concrete that used to be the parking lot of the warehouse and now resembled more a gory cemetery. He managed to turn his body’s weight onto his right shoulder to try and run for it, but it was already too late.
“Don’t sulk, Captain!” Happy asked with clear amusement. "You have to know that I really do like you and that I think that you're great for the boss.
Even if that was the case, the fast step of the animals was too much a match for a simple human being, even when Anthony knew that some of them were doomed to fall in any of the traps that surrounded the pathway.
I decided to keep editing as soon as possible so I can publish the next chapter within the next few days. That or maybe I'll publish the next chapter as it is as soon as I get around 50 kudos or something. Whatever comes first! Thanks for reading, my dears!
Steve sometimes forgot the danger of displaying any form of affection towards Tony in front of the little, devious woman, even if Tony wasn’t around; she seemed to be over-interested in their relationship. Tony suspected she was taking pictures of them making out and selling them on the internet to the highest bidder.
“Tony,” Steve in a persuasive tone, “I know this is very important to you. Maybe I should try one more time?”
“Steve, I couldn’t get here in time because Obadiah threw a last-minute formal banquet in honour of our new guest and all. They wouldn’t allow me to retire early because, apparently, I have to be paraded all night for them to be happy with me.” The bitterness of his voice was enough to soften the clear blue eyes of his mate. Steven knew how awful was for Anthony when he was treated like a prize that would go to the higher bidder. It just provoked the taller man to demand his distressed lover's lips again, but this time it was a tender and comforting kiss.
“Anyway! That's a story for another moment!" She dismised his cuestion with a wave of her hand. Steve was going to complain, but she continued with a malicious glint in her eyes and the blond decided to leave it for now. "Now, my friend, if you’re that determined to talk to Rhodey and try to patch things up (or at least get a little revenge for what he said– just saying! No need to glare at me like that!), then we call in the big cavalry.”
“Happy,” he acknowledged the smiling man with a small nod. “What are you doing here? Did Pepper ask you to come for Tony?”
“I went looking for help; a different kind of help,” he announced slowly. Steve knew he was staling, but he wanted to keep that position forever and Tony’s reaction to the truth will be explosive if he's lucky, “I went to Wanda and convinced her to make me an Honesty Serum.”
Steve thought about it, about all the flaws and even more qualities that his lover possessed compared to his own. He thought about the good Tony did for the people and never gave himself the credit that he deserved. About the way he struggled when Steve carried him forcefully out of the workshop for a well-deserved (and forced) rest. About the way Steve left food near the equipment Tony was currently using because it was the only way that he would subconsciously eat and how adorable he would look when realizing that some of his tools had been replaced for fruit. He thought about the way he tried to make him smile with his sarcastic humor when Steve had had nightmares or he’d been sad over something. He thought about how he would wake up with a tangled Tony all over him because he wanted Steve to wake him up for a morning kiss before he left for a run.
“Hey, don’t be like that,” Tony tried to say it casually, but Rhodes swore he heard a tremor in his voice.
“Wow,” Bucky whispered astonished. “
It could have been hellhounds after him for all Anthony cared, it will always be worth it.
Pretty huge, indeed.
Yes, the fanaticism was definitely the main culprit for Tony’s headache, he decided.
The gall of the fucking guy. He even sounded honestly relieved that he'd found Tony. James now was truly regreting not having gone for the gun. Even a knife would have sufficed. Damn his self-control.
“For one, the immeasurable desire to punch your teeth out for the hellish potion that you forced on me and that won’t let me fucking stay quiet. For the rest, I can’t be selfish all the time, Steve; I will not be the one responsible for breaking up the best thing that has happened to us,” Tony confessed with determination.
“And I did. But every time I realized that none of your supposed conquests would get below your belt,” Steve continued while massaging said place. When Tony closed his eyes and started to get lost in the contact, Steve dipped his head further into Tony’s space so he could whisper directly in his ear, “At first I was so angry at you for letting other people touch you, but then, I realized that this was part of your denial and that you were becoming more faithful to me over the time; the hickeys were more and more my own, and rarely you went out to drink without me. It wasn’t that long until
This was embarrassing in so many levels. It felt like karma was working its own kind of magic already...
Tony seemed to take his words into consideration because a few seconds later, he sighed and murmured “Yeah, you’re right.” then he went straight to Rhodey’s bathroom without even sparing a glance at the guest’s room.
“I see…”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Captain America does not sulk.” He said dryly. “Not now, not ever.”
“I know,” Tony acknowledged tenderly, as if he didn’t think Steve was capable of anything but.
she added when she probably heard the disillusioned sigh that came from Steve’s mouth.
“Hey, don’t call him that; he means well.”
Steve felt those words like a good punch in the gut. He thought that he now understood Rhodes’ resentment towards him better. He'd thought it was a simple case of
“Jarvis! What the hell!? I was listening to that!”
“And you did,” His lover agreed gratefully, smiling warmly at him. “And I know you did it for me, so I’m really happy to have someone like you with me, but if you think I’m hardheaded, then that’s because you don’t know Rhodey, at all. He’ll come around with time, Steve. With a
Pepper.
Rhodes had sat on a table by the window. He hadn’t waited for Steve to order, since he was already drinking his black coffee as if it was water. It somehow reminded Steve of Tony and not for the first time he questioned himself what those two have exactly lived through together.
Some thought he saved his own skin, some said he was downright suicidal to go through a wormhole in space with no allays, no backup plans, and a missile.
"I'm not too sure what I
I hope you enjoyed this chapter, even though I did not very much enjoy it myself.
He was very glad though, that the encounter with the Avengers earlier today at one of Stane Industries' facilities hasn't turned into a big fight, or else he would have missed the party entirely, and that's without including the bruises and injuries.
There was a genuine chuckle from Bruce at that one, and Tony couldn't help but feel a little pleased. A month ago, Bruce would have flinched away from references like that.
“Don’t, Nat.”
“None of your business. What are the two of you up to?”
Rhodey glowered. “Unlikely. The company’s been seriously struggling since Hammer’s arrest. I doubt they’ve had time to come up with stuff like that.”
“Fuck off, BirdAss,” Tony rasped, his mouth unbearably dry. He accepted the cup of lukewarm water Natasha handed him gratefully, gulping it down too quickly and triggering a coughing fit that left his chest burning, air whistling through his damaged lungs.
“When do you think he’ll be back?” Steve asked, absentmindedly scratching Butterfingers’ arm.
“So how’d you overcome it?” Steve asked, voice edging on desperate. Bruce shrugged.
“I know what you’re going say,” he said warily. “I don’t want to hear it.”
“This is criminal,” Tony complained. “I mean, this is really the worst of the worst. What kind of sick, twisted person interrupts Project Runway?”
They were watching a movie - Tangled, one of her favorites. Of course, she’d die before admitting that to the team, but Clint had suggested it, taking the ribbing from the others like a champ, sending her a covert smile. She had nodded back, making a mental note to thank him thoroughly later tonight.
Clint, of course, was one to talk, because the archer also had a habit of perching in high places and falling asleep with his eyes open, which terrified Tony every time he came into the kitchen looking for a midnight snack.
__________
Steve nodded, exiting the lab as quickly as he could while still maintaining a semblance of dignity. Once he’d made his escape, he made his way up to the training room to sort out his head.
Also unfortunate for her? Neither of these two goddamn idiots could hold their liquor.
Thanks for reading folks! I can't promise that I'll be able to post super regularly because it turns out grad school is a LOT of work. But I can promise that it's not going to take two years to update this time. There is a point to all this, and it will be coming soon!
Natasha nodded. “I’ll have Clint contact them.”
“So, what’s on the monster menu today?” Tony asked as he swooped down over Lexington.
“Thank you, Ms. Lewis,” Steve said, brushing past her as politely as he could manage, and making his way to the tiny office he’d been given when he became a S.H.I.E.L.D agent. Since becoming an official Avenger and moving into the Tower, he’d rarely spent time there - much to the consternation of Agent Hill, who was forced to leave mission reports on his desk in that office, as Tony had forbidden Jarvis from accepting mail from S.H.I.E.L.D. As a result, he was massively behind on mission reports, which Fury insisted he fill out on paper. Now seemed as good a time as any to get caught up.
Steve grinned back at him. “Good night, Tony.”
“I don’t know what else to do.” Steve croaked. “I love him so much, Natasha, and I can’t tell him. And then Rhodey went back to see him and I couldn’t even be mad because I don’t have any right -”
“I’m sorry, what?”
There was a gentle clearing of a throat in the doorway, and Steve looked up to see Natasha leaning against the doorframe, arms crossed and expression neutral.
While normal was not necessarily a term bandied about frequently in Avengers Tower, there were at least days that were somewhat less eventful than others.
Well, all except one conspicuous absence.
My apologies for the delay in posting - first I was caught up studying, then I broke my foot, and it's kind of been a struggle bus the last few weeks. So here's struggle bus chapter which is finally setting up the major plot arc for this part of the series!
Steve, on the other hand, had been doing everything he could to get to Tony’s location since the moment he’d heard the A.I.M agent’s voice over the comms. It was barely three blocks away, but it felt like miles. He’d dodged snapping teeth, sharp horns, and trampling legs nearly thick around as Thor’s body, but it still didn’t feel fast enough.
Rhodey shook his head. “I’ll let him explain. Try to get some rest, okay? You’re going to need your strength for trying to break out of here against medical advice once you’re not so drugged.”
“Iron Man!” Clint barked out in warning, and Tony swerved in the nick of time as another pterodactyl swooped down at him.
Clint stared at him. “You can’t be serious?”
Tony felt his face flush -it was pathetic, how this one man made him feel like a teenager again - and quickly sent off a reply.
He shoved the two men towards the shower, helping them pull off their shirts in the process. Once they were under the stream, awkwardly facing each other with their shirts gone and their hair plastered to their heads, Bruce turned away, breathing a sigh of relief. Now, a few minutes together under the hot water, and soon….
It helped, in its own way, with his own baggage as well. Before the ice, it had always been him and Bucky looking after each other, and he’d missed having that companionship after he woke up. Tony’s mindless rambling and his scolding of his bots, the way he would sometimes look at Steve with concern, as if he could sense those moments where it felt as though the ice was going to crawl back up his spine and refreeze him all over again. In those moments, Tony would abandon whatever he was working on and encourage Dum-E and You to bring Steve increasingly disgusting smoothies from the kitchenette.
“Be there in half a minute, my friend,” Tony said, wincing at the ‘friend’. Shutting the phone off, he smiled apologetically at Pepper. “Hate to discuss and dash, but there’s a city to be saved.”
During the war, it had been easy to know what that symbol was supposed to be. He was a symbol of American freedom, of the compassion and righteousness that stood against the hatred and fear mongering of the Nazi party.
Perhaps the face mashing would have been more effective after all.
Steve couldn’t help but snort. “That doesn’t sound like Clint.”
“And where are Steve and Tony?” Bruce asked, finally waking up some.
-XO, Obsidian
However, forcing one of them to come to the other’s rescue might just work. Maybe.
“Yeah, do you mind coming here for a second?” Bruce responded. “I need someone to hold this beaker steady while Tony and I add the reagents.”
Yes, white pizza with broccoli and bacon is delicious. Don't judge me.
“Tony,” Steve called. “Focus, please? You can bash Richards later.”
"Tony?" he ventured. There was no response from the inventor. His eyelids barely twitched in acknowledgment of his new companion.
“Speed that up J, we’re not going to be able to get all of these things down without major structural damage to Midtown,” Tony ordered.
“There is no more need for monologues, Mister Stark,” the man said, cocking the gun. “Only goodbyes.”
He thanked her and stepped into the room, walking quickly towards Tony’s bed.
It's been a while.
Steve grinned widely. “Well, I do. Dum-E and I are best friends, aren’t we bud?”
“Sir, yes sir,” Tony saluted, and spiraled upwards to blast a couple more of the ugly flying creatures down. “Jarvis, how are we doing on locating the originating signal?”
Very brief mentions of panic attacks and allusions to Howard's general suckiness this chapter. Enjoy!
----------------------------
“Fury wanted an analysis right away,” she said gently. “I’m sure there will be plenty of questions that Richards will need your help to answer.”
"Yeah, I'd love to move in."
It wasn't until a particularly bad night for Steve that he finally understood just how much Tony was really struggling. Since his defrosting, as Natasha lovingly referred to it, Steve had found that he didn't need as much sleep as he had before he was frozen. Seventy years was a long time to hibernate, after all. Sometimes, lying alone in his room, it just felt too cold, and quiet, and the air around him would thicken until he could barely force out a breath and -
It in no way matched up with everything Steve had ever been told or had seen of Tony Stark, and it drove him absolutely crazy trying to understand why this Tony - the kind, thoughtful Tony with dark circles under his eyes and a genuine smile - had never been seen in the public eye.
Tony grinned. "Really?"
“Are you and Clint…?” He hesitated, knowing that Natasha’s personal life was a sensitive subject for her, but he had wondered ever since he’d seen them together that first time, in the med room on the Helicarrier.
“Hmmm.”
He studies the object intently for a moment, turning it over in his hands. “Um, Steve?”
“What the fuck?!” Tony exclaimed, staring up at the ceiling before running over to Steve, hauling him back onto the couch. Dum-E, fire extinguisher in claw, raced over the the flaming papers, dousing them in chemical foam. He then trundled over to Tony and Steve, and in an abundance of caution, sprayed both of them with flame suppressant as well.
He was greeted in the kitchen by a stack of pancakes and a fantastic view of Steve’s ass. The supersoldier, wearing a pair of tight running pants that left very little to the imagination, was slaving over the stove, carefully tending to at least two dozen eggs. On the counter next to him sat two plates of pancakes - one regular, one chocolate chip - a heap of bacon, a bowl of fresh cut fruit, and a pitcher of orange juice. The other Avengers were hanging around in various states of repose, squabbling over the crossword and nibbling at Steve’s brunch feast.
Clint looked up as he sat down next to them. “Fury’s apprised of the situation, and Thor and Bruce will be heading over here as soon as they get done with cleanup, which should be pretty soon. Pepper’s approved us all as next of kin so the doctor will let us know as soon as they have any updates.”
“Yes, you can,” Natasha said. “Whatever permission you’re waiting for, it’s granted.”
"You Hulk-proofed for me?"
Tony rubbed at his eyes. “Yeah, of course, I just…” he trailed off, patting Dum-E’s strut. “I built Dum-E in a drunken, angry haze when I was fifteen. He’s not exactly a functional machine, hardly useful at all and not really that exciting. I’m...most people don’t really interact with him.”
“Sure,” Steve agreed readily, giving Tony a dopey grin. Tony blushed, focusing his attention back on the bottle of chemicals he was holding in his unbound hand - Thor’s attempt at matchmaking had left him with a sprained wrist. Bruce rolled his eyes, then turned to switch out the bottles he had.
There was something comforting about it. Back in his previous life, he and Bucky had provided each other with the same kind of emotional support. When Steve’s mother had died, Bucky had walked him home, fed him, made sure he was getting to work. When Bucky’s first love had left him high and dry, Steve was the one to get him to shave and get back out there. More than anything, he’d missed that kind of quiet camaraderie.
Bruce snorted as he settled in next to Tony, taking another piece of bacon off of his plate.
Steve winced, disliking the thought of Tony being alone in the hospital, no one but Rhodes to worry over him or visit.
Suddenly, the mixture bubbled up, foaming until it reached the rim of the beaker, where it exploded everywhere. Bruce hit the deck, prepared for the explosion, but Steve and Tony got completely soaked.
“Well if we’re not going to fight them, and we’re not going to see if they taste as much like Jell-O as they look like Jell-O, then why exactly am I here?” Tony asked.
“We at A.I.M. are not opposed to a little friendly collaboration, Mr. Stark,” came a new voice from behind him. Tony whirled around, dropping into a defensive position.
“Not the worst you’ve had, sorry to say. Bit of a concussion, broken ribs, punctured lung from the broken ribs. Bumps and bruises from falling off of a six-story tall building.”
Steve rolled his eyes. "Not like that, Stark. You need sleep.”
Steve muttered something under his breath, and reached out to pat Tony’s hand.
“Yeah?”
He suspected that the attack on New York had something to do with Tony’s seemingly newfound quietness - he had noticed that Tony appeared to have lost weight over the last few months, that he would occasionally flinch back from loud noises or sudden movements.
Steve looked through the document, identifying it as a to-do list from Tony’s “Shit to Get Done” title. Most of the items were fairly bland - sign SI papers, repair the suit, review R&D designs. Scrolling down, the sight of his own name made him stop.
Bruce sighed. "I know, I'm sorry. I was out in a couple of the rural villages and I lost cell service. I didn't even get the calls until I got back last night."
"Wait, what do you mean, you lost cell service? Starkphones are designed to never lose service! They’re supposed to get service on the other side of the galaxy!" Tony sat forward again, suddenly anxious about his technology’s performance.
Tony just wants bacon. Clint just wants to watch Project Runway. Hulk just wants to smash something. Fury wants a new job.
Tony had refused to let the other Avengers leave New York without personalized, completely untraceable Starkphones, so it wasn't hard to find Bruce's number. It was, however, apparently impossible to get the man to actually pick up. Tony called six times over three days (he didn't want to risk seeming needy, but the fact was that he had woken up curled around the half-finished robot body he was building for Jarvis, so it was clear that he was in desperate need of human contact), and it took another twelve hours after that for Bruce to call him back. When he finally did, he sounded completely exhausted.
He saved Capsicle for last, primarily because he wasn't sure how the super soldier would take the invitation. While they parted after New York on far better terms than they had first met, Tony didn't think they could exactly be considered friends. Still, the rest of the team would be here, and Tony knew that Cap - being the stellar leader he was - would probably like to be with his teammates. If only to make sure that Tony and Bruce didn't accidentally blow them all up.
Clint threw a pepperoni at his forehead with unerring accuracy. “Come join us. I'm teaching Thor how to play Super Smash Bros. I might even let you win a round or two if I’m feeling generous.”
One new message from: Captain Capsicle
“Loud and clear,” the director said. “Do what you can to figure it out.”
“We’re trying to shut this thing down, not make it better,” Clint reminded him.
The archer patted him on the knee. “Iron Ass won’t give up on us this easy. We’ve still got to find out which of the designers Heidi Klum will vote off.”
Tony raised an eyebrow. "Are you propositioning me Cap? Because I'd expect a little more from the pillar of American morality. Dinner at least first, I'm not that easy."
“So?” Tony asked, knowing this conversation was not going to end well, but feeling compelled to continue the argument anyways. He’d never been a particularly good Gemini. “It’s not like I’m not used to operating with diminished lung capacity.”
The standard-issue office chair protested loudly against his weight as he settled in, staring blankly at the stack of papers in front of him.
This was another thing that he couldn’t come to terms with about his feelings. He knew Tony reveled in his notoriety, practically wore it like a suit of armor (or an Ironman suit). But since New York, he had softened around the edges, keeping out of the tabloids and away from the press in general unless it was Avengers or Stark Industries related business. Some might even say he was settling down.
“Be careful, Shellhead.”
He felt awkward calling Cap - did the man even know how to answer a phone? - so he texted him, and hoped that a caring neighbor would help the poor guy answer.
_______
He staggered back to his feet, making his way over to the nearest bathroom and locking the door behind him. Catching sight of his reflection in the mirror, he hardly recognized the person who looked back at him. He was covered in dust and sweat, a thin trickle of blood on the side of his cheek from where one of the velociraptors had gotten in a lucky swipe. His eyes were sunken and haunted, the eyes of a man who’d lost too much.
Each of the Avengers was withdrawn into their own world, processing the stress of the situation. Natasha and Clint had inched impossibly closer, and were now so intertwined that there was no way to tell where one spy ended and the other began. Their eyes, however, were glassy and vacant, both lost in memories.
Tony approached the device cautiously, examining it from all sides. It really was a lovely piece of technology, all curved black edges and a simple transmitter causing so much chaos. He wondered if Fury would let him have it after they were done, to examine the coding. He highly doubted it.
The others nodded in agreement, all of them experienced with the temperaments of their teammates.
“AIM created some kind of time vortex machine, set dinosaurs loose in Midtown,” Steve said. “Tony tried to shut down the machine, and some of the agents ambushed him.”
“Whoever ordered pizza is my new favorite person,” Clint announced as they exited the elevator into the lounge. “Behind the delivery guy, at least.”
“Thoroughly fried,” Steve confirmed. “Nice work, Tony.”
He wasn’t sure why he was so desperate. But there was this ache in his gut telling him that something was
But first, maybe, a nap.
“Yo, Rogers,” she said, poking at his bicep. “You awake in there?”
She nodded. Tomorrow, they would begin to plan how to get their resident idiots together.
Unfortunately for everyone else in the room, Steve and Tony had somehow ended up across the couch from each other. This meant that every few seconds, one of them would cast longing, furtive glances at the other, before heaving a quiet sigh and turning their attention back to the movie. It had gotten to the point where Natasha was able to time it, counting down the seconds until the next time Tony or Steve turned puppy dog eyes on the object of their desire.
There was a resigned laugh from the other end of the line. "Okay, fine, you got me. I forgot my charger and my phone died. Don't worry that inflated head of yours off about it. But seriously, what's up?"
These problems, thankfully, seemed to mostly sort themselves out. Despite the cracked concrete and shattered glass, the infrastructure of Stark Tower was undamaged, and overall the repairs (during which he once again found himself doing some heavy lifting) went fairly quickly.
But Tony? Tony was all enthusiastic (if a little off-key) singing, a surrogate father to his bots, a man who laughed so hard at Steve’s reaction to the Star Wars reveal that he snorted milk out of his nose. He was genuinely fun, and truly seemed to enjoy catching Steve up to the twenty-first century, whether it be teaching him how to use Google or explaining the difference between the Rolling Stones and Rolling Stone.
Bruce was exhibiting a truly exemplary amount of calm, alternating between meditating quietly in a corner and staring at the fish floating gently through the aquarium at the far end of the waiting room. Thor was snoring, passed out in a chair next to Clintasha. The only sign of his stress was the way his hand clenched around Mjolnir.
Oh, and it contains some hurt Tony. I do love torturing my babies.
The robot trilled sadly, dropping the toy that he’d built earlier into his hand. Steve squeezed the metal hard enough for it to creak ominously.
Hellooooo, friends of the interwebs, I have arisen from the death that is finals into the sweet light of summer.
“Yeah, well, sue me for wanting to keep my team alive and well,” he mumbled, turning back to the stove and shifting from foot to foot.
So yes, he had seen Steve and Tony eye fucking each other. Hell, at this point, a Martian could probably see it from Mars, without a telescope. And not only was Clint observant, but he was a man who loved a challenge. If he could get the infamous Black Widow to somehow fall in love with him, there was no way he couldn’t do this.
“Why?” Tony asked, the beeping of the heart rate monitor accelerating with his anxiety. “About what?”
“Oh you are on.” Tony vaulted over the back of the couch to grab a controller, and Steve chuckled, stacking half a dozen slices of pizza - white with broccoli and bacon, his favorite - and settled in to watch the battle unfold.
Natasha would probably coax Bruce out of the lab with promises of tea and a sandwich, and Clint would probably goad Thor into some kind of contest, be it in the boxing ring or on the Wii. Steve, long home from his morning marathon (and Tony really wished he could say that he was joking about that), would probably offer to make everyone lunch, and end up whipping up a three course meal complete with perfectly balanced protein-starch-vegetable ratios. Tony had yet to solve the mystery of how Steve Rogers, who’d grown up dirt poor in Brooklyn, then spent his time running around the European countryside, had somehow had time to learn to cook like a Michelin-star chef.  Every time he asked, Steve merely winked and said something about everyone needing their secrets.
Thor allowed himself one sly smile.
“Okay but seriously,” Clint said, a faint twanging sound coming over his line. “Does anyone have any suggestions on how to keep these things corralled? Because these triceratops seem very intent on exploring brunch spots in Hell’s Kitchen.”
It took a couple more weeks for everyone to settle into routines as they adjusted to living together, but they soon worked out a couple of ground rules. No one could enter Clint or Natasha's rooms without knocking first, unless they wanted to risk an arrow or a knife between the eyes. Knocking on Bruce's door at any point was out of the question - the quiet scientist had quickly warmed up to his new roommates, and spent most of his time out in the common area, down in R&D, or training in the gym. When he did retreat to his room, it was usually to calm down and cool off, so interrupting him was strictly off-limits unless they wanted a slightly greener Bruce than normal.
Steve sighed. “Have you ever felt like the way that people see you is different from the way you feel about yourself?”
This Tony built Bruce a meditation room and put together an art studio for Steve. He made sure that the gym was always in great shape and ordered replacements for all of the training equipment that Clint and Natasha managed to break without complaint (though there was some good-natured hassling that often resulted in Clint holding Tony in a headlock on the living room floor). This Tony had Jarvis monitor the number of PopTarts in the kitchen and warn Thor when their supplies were getting low. He suggested movies and television shows to catch Steve up on pop culture, and showed him how to work the toaster properly, and stayed up late in his workshop to create more aerodynamic arrows for Clint, easily-concealed poison darts for Natasha, and flexible, stretching pants for the Hulk.
“Master Stark is currently at Stark Industries, attending a board meeting,” Jarvis supplied helpfully. “Ms. Potts threatened portions of his anatomy that he would rather remained intact.”
-------------------------
He didn't bother calling her, as Coulson had told him the story about the last time he called her in, and he didn't want Natasha to snap his arm for interrupting her during a mission. Texting, however, seemed like a safe enough form of contact.
He knew, however, how much his fellow Avengers enjoyed their beauty rest, so he was surprised to find Tony slumped over the kitchen table, head buried in his arms, staring out at the twinkling lights of the Manhattan skyline at three o’clock in the morning.
“And Steve?” Tony asked, a forced casualness to his tone. The Wondertwins shared a smirk over his head anyways, and he told himself that the heat rising to his cheeks was the result of the pain steadily increasing throughout his body.
Unfortunately, the reinforcements are about as helpful as a bag of bricks. Which she would cheerfully murder them all with.
At the thick silence that passed between them, Steve stubbornly didn’t leave Rhodes eyes for even one second. He tried to read his expression, but the Colonel didn’t show more than complete seriousness.
“Hold your horses, Captain.” Rhodes interrupted with the biggest scowl yet. “If what you’re looking for is my approval of you and Tony as an item, then you’re far from it.”
His proud, manic expression suddenly changed when his gaze fell upon Tony again, his voice turning seductive and only accomplishing to further anger present company, “And talking about beautiful, I can see why you’d love this sweet-ass,” the crazy man dared to lick the outline of Tony’s ear; it was disgusting in so many levels. The genius tried uselessly to throw him off again --to at least create an opening for someone to stick something sharp in this bastard, anything, really-- but his captor seemed like he hadn’t even noticed he moved, “I only spend a little time having fun with him and we haven’t had the opportunity to
“Well, then.” The Lord agreed smugly while making a dismissive gesture with his hand so the other two horses went ahead. “You should remember your place, servant.” The Lord advised almost spitting the last word. “I should warn you to keep your eyes low when you are in the presence of your masters since you are not worth more than the filth around this place.”
At first, Steve had been surprised that Tony had a friend like Happy when he first met him.  The super soldier had thought that Hogan didn’t look like the kind of civilian who would stick with Tony’s eccentric ways in the long run. However, Steve could effortlessly see what Tony liked so much about Hogan's easy way after he spend more time with the chauffeur; it was probably a tempting thing to have near when you have people as organized as Pepper and Rhodes around all the time.
“‘Hard time’ doesn’t
“He’s just trying to be a good friend and look after me, you know that, right?” Tony asked hopefully. Steve couldn’t help but feel worse at how blind he had been to be unable to see such an amazing person as the one standing before him; even when trying to please Steve by telling him what he wanted to know, he would still show loyalty to his best friend trying at the same time to defend his actions. He was still trying to make Steve understand how much Rhodes meant to him.
“No.” he finally answered with sincerity. “I’m not.”
. If you know what I mean.” The last sentence he directed at Steve.
Steven wouldn’t have any of that and kept it slow as they become one. Reassuring himself that the sounds coming from his beloved meant that he was still alive, that he heard Anthony’s calls just in time; that they could be together in their veiled cottage, dreaming of the day when they would finally be allowed to be together without hiding or sneaking around so they could steal just a brief touch. A look.
Steve felt the words like a slap from the Hulk. The supersoldier swore he heard a little part of his heart breaking in pieces at such an
the hostility in the air. It’s been a while since he wanted to take a defensive stance outside a battlefield.
“You saw him yourself!”
“Get away from me!” Anthony yelled uselessly at the hungry growls that couldn't be fooled by a hidden passageway now that they had his scent to pursue him.
you?”
“What happened?” Tony inquired gently while running his hands slowly up and down Steve’s neck. The Captain gave up his tense demeanor and found comfort by rounding Tony’s slim waist with his arms. “You seem really frustrated, and don’t you try to deny it because that’s my normal state and I can recognize it from miles away.”
He hadn’t had only lost his beloved mother, but his father as well as he got consumed by grief and addictions. Not even Prince Robert Bruce Stark Banner, the alpha son of the first wife of the king and heir to the kingdom, had been able to help him out of his grief and misery at the death of his second wife. Soon, the heir had given up and decided to take care of the kingdom instead of their father. Both King and Prince had surrounded themselves with their own problems and forgotten all about twelve-year-old Anthony. Everyone but Virginia Potts, the youngest prince's favourite maid, and Edwing Jarvis, his trusted mentor, left him alone.
“What is that supposed to mean? That’s just-”
Steven looked at Anthony’s stiff posture in response to his godfather’s tone. If he wasn’t looking for it, Steven would have missed the second when his eyes met Anthony’s if he hadn't been so concentrated on his reactions. He saw in a flash how the prince's eyes gathered courage and Steven was tired of fearing for his lover’s well-being in such a short period of time. He opened his mouth to intervene, but Anthony was faster.
Okay, this is nothing new, I know, sorry about that. I just found myself recently reading this thanks to an unexpected comment, after all these years, and I decided to prove to myself how much my English has improved. That's why I started to re-write some of my stories (starting with The Royal Circle) and noticed the number of mistakes that this had! It was outrageous!
“And why’s that?” Steven asked warily, he knew it was hard for Anthony to like the other nobles; it was almost unheard of when he said something nice about them. So far, he'd only liked King Xavier and Lady Van Dyne’s company. “Did you talk to him?”
sick of this. He was just so tired of Tony running away from what has been obviously happening between them, and Steve, for once, wasn’t willing to respect his wishes, anymore.
"He probably does," she agreed, "you should have seen him when Natasha was giving
“No.” He said simply looking directly at his godfather. Resolution clear in his voice.
After his question, Steve waited patiently for the magic to beat Tony's internal struggle to answer it.
“It is quite impressive, my Lord,” Anthony commented dryly when he looked at the stud. “I am sure he is the perfect specimen.” For what Anthony knew about horses, he was being quite curt.
A name has high meaning in the magic world and has been sacred for all the living creatures, magical or not, to treasure and respect their given names. A name is power and protection, a reflection of the soul and the marked history of its ancestry. A nickname, a twist of one's name, was frowned upon in most societies and considered insults with sometimes the exception of when loved ones pronounced them. The consensus of allowing someone to twist one’s name meant giving power over oneself and creating a powerful bond.
“Well, maybe it wasn’t him!”
Steve allowed a short silence to let the Air Force soldier assimilate his words.
to. But I’ve never seen you want to be ‘pliable’ outside the bedroom.”
Steve tried to sound calm, he really did, but he was way past the point of simply annoyed. He almost had to leap for the brunette’s arm the moment Tony’s typical cowardice manifested again anytime the conversation turned anywhere near feelings and
Captain America was when he blushed! Believe me, ‘adorable’ is not a word within a Stark’s vocabulary if it’s not accompanied with sarcasm. I was really shocked; I almost missed a red light... that’s a funny story for another day, by the way.” Happy concluded.
