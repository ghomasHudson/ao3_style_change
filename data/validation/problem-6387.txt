Slowly he was regaining that trust and faith in people, but it was going to take more time for him to truly accept others. It took him some time to trust Tony and the friends he’s made through his mate. He only trusted this new alpha because she had aided in his and his family’s rescue.
The appointment goes well; both Tony and the baby are doing fine. There had been concerns with Tony’s age and if his uterus was capable of carrying a baby to term-it was the whole reason why Steve was supposed to get pregnant- but the scans were good. It was relieving.
Morgan doesn’t drift off to sleep right away, instead keeping her eyes locked with Tony’s. He smiles down at her and gently strokes a finger along her face. Her eyes flutter, only to open again.
He settles into bed with a book, deciding to educate himself on parenthood before dozing off. He’s already read a few chapters, finding the information both useful and overwhelming. It’s a lot to grasp and he knew once he finished the book that he wouldn’t be an expert on babies, but the information is comforting in a way. He felt it would improve his skills and aid him.
Steve pushes aside those thoughts, not wanting to upset himself over the past. That was behind them now. They were free and moving forward.
Tony doesn’t buy it, though and he crawls onto the bed and toward Steve. Fuck their break up. He was going to hold him until whatever it was that was bothering him went away.
Peter doesn’t laugh and instead sits down quietly on one of the cushions. He scoots forward until he’s sitting on the edge and picks up a small bottle of hand sanitizer for his hands.
“Good evening, Steve,” Jarvis greets, startling the omega. “My apologies, sir. I didn’t mean to scare you.”
Steve knows he should just walk away, but instead he finds himself leaning forward and pressing a kiss to Tony’s cheek. “Bye,” he whispers.
The burning in his back has subsided, leaving behind nothing but a dull ache. It’s uncomfortable but tolerable than the agonizing pain he felt before. Tony tries to open his eyes, only to squeeze them shut from the light that blinds him.
“N-no.” Steve manages to grit out. The contraction is beginning to taper off. “They’re getting closer. Seven minutes, I think. Maybe five.”
“Oh, thank you.” Steve steps further into the room. He’s still unsure and it must be noticeable because Happy frowns at him, then sighs heavily.
“I don’t even know who I am anymore,” Steve says, “I think the old me went into the ice and never came out. He’s gone.”
At the sound is his name, Tony’s eyes shoot open and he glances over his shoulder, expecting to find his husband still curled up around him. But Steve is sitting up, a pained expression on his face and arms wrapped around his middle.
Tony chuckles and wraps his arms around Steve’s waist, pulling him close and affectionately nuzzling their noses.
A soft bark from the foot of the bed reminds them that they’re not alone. Steve breaks away, turning his head toward Dodger, a small chuckle escaping him. “Guess someone just wants attention,” he says.
“Try having a baby and get back to me.” Steve’s tone is bitter and tight. The last thing Tony intended was to anger him and start an argument.
“Please?” Steve’s begging is what snaps Tony from thoughts, and he peers in his husband’s direction, finding fresh tears streaming down his face.
Peter had been the only one able to pull Tony out of his funk and start creating again. It was Peter who got Tony to quit drinking. And it was Peter who made Tony get back in the suit.
Steve’s lips curve into a small smile. He works quietly on tying the tie, and once finished, he runs his fingers over it to smooth out any wrinkles. “Don’t be late. I was thinking maybe dinner and if Morgan falls asleep early…”
Steve is taken further into this new base, going down corridor after corridor until he’s at a metal door. The alpha on his right scans his badge and the door opens. The cell he’s thrown into is everything he was expecting. It’s dark and cramped, not a lot of room to move around. It’s cold too; Steve can’t help but shiver when his bare feet touch the floor.
No one greets Steve the second he pulls up to the house. With a disappointed huff Steve shuts off the ignition and leans back in his seat. He keeps his eyes on the lit up house, hoping that at least one of his pups would run out the front door to greet him.
Steve watches the banter with an amused smile on his face. It was these moments that he cherished the most. He loved his team, his family.
“It’s fine,” the omega chuckles. “I’ve seen worse. At least you’re dressed. The others have been...well, you can imagine. I see he let you borrow his old MIT sweatshirt. You must be special.”
It’s obvious that Peter's initial wish to leave the space alone has been granted. Everything is how Peter remembers. The kitchen is still tidy along with the living room, except for the layer of dust covering most surfaces. Pretty normal.
“And you’ll get there. They’re called baby steps for a reason. I wish I could say after this session that you’ll walk out my door and feel a hundred percent again, but unfortunately that’s not how this works.”
“He didn’t tell you the truth?” Tony questions, giving up on his work to be fully engaged in the conversation.
Steve groans and does as he’s told, dropping his chin down to his chest and pushing as hard as he can. A burning sensation flares between his legs, emitting a scream from Steve’s throat. He pushes harder, unable to fight his body’s urges. He listens to Tony and the soft words he tells him.
“Tony!” Steve tries to make a run toward his alpha, only to be pulled back and shoved down to his knees. He’s forced to watch as Rumlow yanks Tony up and orders him into a similar position. The gun in his hand is pressed to his head. “Please!” Steve begs. “Don’t. Don’t hurt him.”
“I’m so proud of you.” Tony places a kiss to the top of Steve’s head. “That must’ve been scary as hell.”
Steve doesn’t return any of his calls or messages that night. Tony is forced to lie awake and wonder what he’s supposed to do from here.
The tears in Tony’s eyes roll down his face. There’s a mixture of guilt and anger coursing through him. It was his fault Steve was forced back into this hell hole. If only Tony had been stronger, had been a good alpha, then his mate wouldn’t be hurting.
“You’re done controlling me. I belong to no one,” Steve fires back, his hands rolling into fists, ready to collide them with Pierce’s jaw.
Tony is facing the stove, his back turned. He curses quietly to himself and quickly reaches for the wooden spoon he has set out on the counter. Steve can’t help but smirk at the scene in front of him.
Steve is sobbing uncontrollably now, the grip he has on Tony tightening with each painful sound he makes. Tony can only hold him and whisper softly. But he wants to do more. He wants to go back and prevent this from ever happening.
“He doesn’t look scared to me,” Thor says, glancing over at the smiling toddler and giving him a little wave.
Harley is pouting again when a serving of broccoli is placed on his Mickey Mouse plate. He pulls a face and shakes his head, refusing to eat the vegetables. Peter points out that they’re just like little trees. Harley isn’t amused.
“We don’t have ten minutes,” the alpha, Nat, snarls. She crouches down in front of Steve, ignoring the way he bares his teeth in defense. Her eyes scan over him again, brows furrowing in concern. “He’s hurt pretty bad and Stark is in worse shape.”
It’s a few minutes later when they both emerge from the bathroom and Peter is rushing downstairs to show off his costume. Tony is lounging on the sofa when his son and husband come down to greet him, and he peers up when he senses their presence, a smile forming on his face.
“You said you weren’t like him, and I believe you. What you did wasn’t you.” Steve steps forward again and Tony takes one back. “Please, Tony. I’m sorry.”
Tony was healing nicely from the latest mission, but Steve still refused to leave his side. He promised he would be there to take care of Tony. It was a struggle at first to juggle his care and their son’s, but they found a way to make it work.
“Can we not talk about the B word?” Peter suggests, his eyes flickering in Flash’s direction again. Flash had decided to abandon dinner and hide behind his glass of water.
“I have to go.” Tony presses the button for the upper level and sighs when the elevator refuses to arrive when he wants. “Come on, come on,” he mutters.
“One doctor one time doesn’t count, Tony. I’m honestly surprised he hasn’t had any complications with this pregnancy. The scans all look good but maybe I’m missing something.” Bruce rubs at his forehead and his eyes squeeze shut.
“I’m terrified. Mother’s can be scared, too. My ma never showed it, but there were times when I caught her caving in. I’ve done this before but each time I’m terrified of the outcome. I always wonder if I’ll lose another pup.”
The chance to talk with Tony comes a few minutes before Steve is set to leave for one of his group sessions. Ideally Steve would have preferred them to talk when he wasn’t needed. He loved talking and hearing the omega’s that needed him, but it was obvious his mate needed him too.
Steve glances down, a small gasp escaping him when he finds a small bump where his abs used to be. “What the hell?” He whispers.
He stops pacing when he hears someone at the door to the lab. He curses to himself when he realizes who it is.
Steve takes his time, enjoying the nighttime ambiance that echoes around him. The lake comes into view, but it’s the gazebo the path of lights leads him to.
“I do,” Tony repeats. “I thought I could pretend that what I was feeling for you didn’t exist, but I can’t deny it anymore. I love you. I’ve always loved you. I was an idiot and I’m sorry. I should’ve been honest with you up front.”
“I know. I trust you.” Steve smiles and leans up, cupping Tony’s face again and bringing him in for another kiss.
Pepper is generous enough to wait until they’re back in Tony’s office and he’s had a few drinks of coffee before she reprimands him. He huffs and sits back in his chair while she scolds him like he’s a little kid. And maybe sometimes he acts like one, but he was trying to get his life back in order. He had a son and there was no more room in his life for immaturity and instability.
He’s left alone when the doctor leaves to set up an ultrasound. Steve tips his head back, a shaky breath leaving him when tears threaten to fall. He still has one hand over his belly, clutching what was left of the small bump.
“He’s your brother,” Steve explains and adjusts Peter in his arms so the older pups can get a better look. “His name is Peter.”
“You really want this, huh?” Steve asks and Peter turns his head to face him, nodding his head. “It’s gonna be dangerous. Being an Avenger is more than just a cool outfit.”
Steve smiles again and presses their lips together. “Then do it, alpha,” he murmurs against Tony’s lips.
“Good morning. I’m doctor Patterson,” She greets with a warm smile and holds out her hand for Steve to shake. Then she’s turning her attention to Tony. “How are you feeling?”
“Dammit,” Steve curses and he shields his eyes until they can adjust. He lets out a yawn and sits up. “‘M so tired.”
I’m not feeling too bad today and decided to write. It relaxes me. But I swear I am taking it easy! Thank you all for being so patient and kind 😊
“Hi, sweetheart,” Steve coos softly. He brushes his thumb along her face, smiling when she peers up at him. “I won’t let them hurt you. I promise.”
The dressing up part was another thing Steve didn’t find amusing. He already dressed up when it came to saving the world, and there were some days when he’d prefer just normal clothes. Those damn sweaters were his addiction. The candy he enjoyed from time to time, but the one thing he couldn’t wrap his mind around were the decorations.
He finds the common room empty and plops down in the arm chair. For months no one has dared sit in that spot, but he felt he deserved to. He felt he deserved a lot of things, having life not fuck him over so much was one, but he knew he couldn’t have that.
It doesn’t happen right away, not that Steve was expecting it to, but he couldn’t help but wonder if their chance had finally come. He doesn’t want to get his hopes up, though. He’s done that way more times than he can count. But he can’t help but get those hopes up when Tony starts acting differently.
But like the nursery rhyme goes: first comes love, then comes marriage. Only, Tony didn’t want a baby carriage to follow. He was content with how things were. A baby would throw everything off.
Peter ignores the voice. He made a mistake, but that didn’t mean his life was over. He had plenty of options. He could fix this.
He didn’t need to ask to know what they were fighting about. It was obvious that their current argument involved him. It made Peter feel worse about his situation.
Somewhere deep inside he felt guilty about Steve’s death. No matter how hard he tries to convince himself that it was an accident due to miscommunication, Tony refuses to believe that he was innocent.
No couple was perfect. Tony knew this, but he couldn’t imagine trying again for the sake of their son just for them to fall apart and have Peter stuck in the middle. That wasn’t fair to him.
Someone is touching his shoulder and for a second Peter forgets he’s with Ned. One glance around shows students heading toward their classes.
The alpha continues to struggle, but Steve is stronger and faster, and in a matter of minutes he has Alexander Pierce strapped into the breeding bench.
“I know, but little pups like you need to sleep. And mama and daddy need to sleep. We can play tomorrow.”
“Fine. If that’s how you feel then don’t bother calling me for anything ever again. I won’t be there.”
The sweet smell of an omega fills his nose. He’s used to the scent; he smells it every single day, but now it was like the aroma Steve naturally gave off was dialed up. Tony slams his fist against the door and leans forward until his forehead is resting against it.
“You finally strung together a few words, huh? Or did you ramble again?” Tony jokes and his son’s face heats up.
There was good news waiting for them when they’re allowed to see their son. The less wires and tubes around him was a good sign. The baby was breathing on his own, something both parents and medical staff didn’t expect to happen so quickly. Steve wonders if the serum had anything to do with his son’s health.
Steve forces himself to look away, deciding it was safer to glance down at his lap instead. He doesn’t want to say the wrong thing and screw up this opportunity. He wants to make things work with Tony. He loves him.
“You were right. I should’ve told him the truth. I should’ve done something.” Tony throws the bottle and it shatters, making Pepper flinch. “And you know what? He loved me. He loved me back and I...and I fucked up. I thought if I walked away from him I could spare myself and him but…I made a mistake. I should’ve told him the truth.”
“So gorgeous,” Tony says at the sight of his boyfriend’s half naked form and leans down to connect their lips again.
For once everything feels right. Steve was happy and planning a special evening for them. Maybe this was the time they had been waiting for. Maybe that storm that has been lingering for too long was finally passing.
Peter sneaks a peek in his dad’s direction, still finding him red faced and fuming. He releases a small hiccup and glances down at his lap again, more tears streaming down his face.
“Not as bad as yours. I didn’t see my parents die, but I didn’t get to say goodbye to them either. I was a punk and wished I had acted better. I regret it.”
Everyone loved Captain America. He was a hero among all ages. Big and small; it didn’t matter. And there was no doubt that Steve paid extra attention to the little kids that adored him. Tony remembers the fanmail the team used to receive when the world learned about them. Tony had his fair share of letters and drawings from the younger members of the Avengers fan base. But it was Steve that received a little more, and the smile that would appear over his face when a new letter was delivered was infectious.
“I know.” Her fingers are in his hair, gently threading through the locks to help calm him down. “It’s not fair and I’m so sorry, sweetie.”
“Hey, relax,” Tony soothes and cradles his son’s head. “It’s okay. Things just happen. I’m not mad. I love you, alright? Don’t think for a second that I don’t.”
Tony ignores the pain and sits up, biting back a groan when his back protests. He brings Steve close and wraps his arms around him.
Tony enjoys the comfort the bed has to offer. It doesn’t beat the one he sleeps on every night upstairs, but it would do for the next couple of days.
“I’ve grown quite fond of your mate. And he had asked me politely to refer to him by his first name.”
Steve is out of his seat in seconds, his instincts kicking into high gear. If his son was hurt or sick then he wanted to be there and know everything that was going on.
“I remember when you were this big,” Steve gestures to one of the posters on the walls. The poster showed the different stages of fetal development. “I think you were the size of a grapefruit.”
He’s busy in the lab working out the bugs of his newest hologram. It’s more family friendly, exactly to Steve’s liking. Tony stops himself when JARVIS alerts him of a visitor. He turns in his seat at the sound of the passcode being entered. Peter comes into the room, a bright smile on his face.
“I miss him so much,” Peter continues to sob. His uncle keeps him in his arms, doing his best to comfort him.
With Steve tied down, Tony works on removing the tie still around Steve’s neck and carefully placing it over Steve’s eyes and tying it tight. Steve gasps and writhes in his restraints.
All he wants to do is curl up beside his husband and hug him close, but he’s reminded of the bathroom he needs to clean.
Bruce finishes up the exam and hands Steve some paper towels to clean off the gel. Tony moves quickly to Bruce’s side, leaning in again to whisper something into his ear.
Sarah comes rushing down the stairs, dressed in her favorite Cinderella gown and matching tiara. She resembles the princess with her long gold hair and sparkling blue eyes. It’s not until Steve realizes his daughter is ready to burst into tears does his smile falter.
“I know. But then I got a taste of it and...why stop there? This isn’t exactly the simple life I envisioned but I wouldn’t change what we have. I love you and our son,” Steve says.
Even Steve can’t help but tense. He knows Tony won’t react badly, but he’s been in this same situation. He had made the same mistake.
Tony only looks away from his son when the door to the connected bathroom opens and Steve shuffles out, looking drained and beat down. It’s a look Steve doesn’t wear often. He comes closer until he’s able to climb onto the large bed and adjust himself beside Tony. He winces and shifts, a hiss of pain escaping him when his lower half meets the bed.
He pushes the idea of going down to medical out of his mind, deciding to get comfortable and try to sleep off the rest of the discomfort that still lingers. He changes into a pair of sweats and a plain t-shirt, then he’s climbing into bed.
The alpha scoffs. “Mother? What kind of mother risks the life of their pup? You were willing to harm her the minute you decided to escape these walls. You’re not a mother. You don’t deserve her.”
Tony’s feelings for the dog never shift to anything more. He keeps his space, as much as he physically can anyway. Wherever Steve goes, Dodger was sure to follow. They practically did everything together, and the only time Tony was free from the dirty mutt was when he was down in his lab.
“I don’t think so. I think he’s still in there. Maybe we just need to use a lot of force to get him out.”
Tony offers a small smile and takes Steve’s hand, no longer caring about his rule of no touching. Steve may be off limits with some things, but he wasn’t going to leave Steve hanging if he was upset. Tony was trying to be a good friend.
“No! If I’ve done nothing but made your life a living hell and made you question everything then I’ll go. I was ready to do this alone.”
For weeks he felt like he was living with someone else. Steve, his husband, the man he promised to spend the rest of his life with, no longer existed. The person Tony resides with resembled the man he loved, but it wasn’t the one he remembered. Steve had changed drastically since the birth of their daughter, and for a moment, Tony believed he had lost him for good.
Just seeing it in person again brings tears to Peter’s eyes. He walks closer to get a better look, running his hand along the star. This suit was purposely made to contrast his papa’s original suit. No one could ever be him. It was time for a new Captain America.
Steve gasps and his eyes shoot open. He sits up and looks around the dimly lit room, searching for his attacker. The room is empty. It had been another dream.
The door to his lab opens and Tony spins around, surprised to find Pepper. He has a hunch for her unexpected visit.
Steve sags in his seat. God did he wish it worked like that. He’d give anything to be cured right on the spot. His pups and his mate needed him.
Steve nods, taking Tony’s suggestion and trying to calm himself down. But it’s difficult when his son refuses to do the same.
Steve is cautious when he does enter the kitchen. Maybe he could avoid another interaction by saying he’s not hungry, but the aroma of chicken and pasta fills his nose and his stomach rumbles in response.
Tony responds by popping open the lid of the lube and covering his fingers generously with it, then leads his wet finger toward Steve’s hole and presses the tip against it. Steve’s body grows taut and his legs struggle to remain open.
Tony makes sure Steve is comfortable before leaving the apartment and making his way downstairs to Natasha’s. The first thing she does when she greets him is pull him into a hug. Tears gather in Tony’s eyes but he refuses to let them fall. He had to be strong.
Steve sniffs and quiet sobs escape him when their son is placed in his arms for the first time. The doctor and nurses leave the room to give the new parents privacy and time to say their goodbyes. Tony remains by Steve’s side, his heart aching because of the pain his husband is in.
All he can do is suffer through it. He’s glad he has Bucky by his side. He couldn’t imagine having to do this alone.
Tony follows his gaze, then he lifts Steve’s chin and their eyes meet. “It wasn’t about me. It was about making you feel good.”
I finally updated this one! I had a push from one of my amazing readers and I finally got the last chapter completed. I hope you all enjoy it!
At the sound of the unfamiliar and disembodied voice, the three pups react fearfully and rush to hide. Harley crawls into Tony’s lap, climbing up the alpha until he can hide his face in Tony’s neck. Sarah clings to Steve tightly and hides her face as well. James shies away behind Steve’s legs.
“You okay?” Tony is quick to sense Steve’s uneasiness. “If you want we can just do the small stuff,” Tony suggests, taking a couple of small boxes into his arms. He gives one a little shake and smiles when something slides around. “This one might just be clothes.”
“I wanted to. You and Mr. Rog-Steve, you guys are like...family. I see you as my dads or something and-sorry that’s weird to say.” Peter’s face is beet red at this point and he wraps his arms around himself.
“Really,” Tony parrots and he puts an arm around his son’s shoulders. It’s the first real contact they’ve had since meeting.
“It’s okay,” Tony says, though he knows their situation is far from it. He’s at the point where he no longer has the proper response anymore. Whatever he says never heals the ache and the loss of something they’ve never had.
Steve smiles and opens his arms for her, needing to hold his little girl and kiss her messy, brown hair. Morgan is more than happy to be in his arms, her cries dying down the second she’s in them.
“Like who? Him? I told you I wasn’t. I could’ve left you on the street, I could’ve taken you back to Pierce when he came sniffing around. But I didn’t! I fucking cared about you and that pup! Look what I did!” Tony gestures angrily around the large property surrounding them. “Was it not enough? If I didn’t care then I wouldn’t have brought you here. I wouldn’t have made sure you felt safe.”
He wonders if the omega had been brought home with him. That’s how he usually liked to end his nights.
That single word is enough to put a smile on Tony’s face. His eyes focus on Steve’s lips, the urge to kiss them again almost too strong to ignore.
He moans softly when Tony kisses and bites the sensitive flesh of his neck. Tony’s hands are back and they slowly lift up Steve’s shirt, exposing his upper half. Steve raises his arms and the shirt comes off completely. It’s thrown somewhere behind him.
Though they did spend most of the day in the lab, Tony enjoyed curling up on the sofa with Dodger right beside him. Which is where Steve finds them when he returns from a briefing.
It wasn’t just the words he was saying, but just hearing him in general. Tony would never get to hear his voice live again.
“See?” Peter’s eyes are full of a tears, a few escaping and rolling down his face. “He did ask for you and you did nothing.”
“Yeah.” Steve smiles at the thought. He always wanted a big family. He never thought he’d get that chance, but now he had a son and the possibility of more children.
“He asked where you were. I told him you were busy and if he wanted to schedule a meeting with you again he can go through me.”
Bucky nods and glances back down at the newborn when Peter stirs and his eyes flutter open. Peter yawns, the simple motion bringing a smile to his uncle’s face.
Pepper winces. “Oh that reminds me. There’s been a few issues with the tower in Hong Kong. A meeting is scheduled next week-”
“I know. I’m just saying. I wanted to help you out and then I learned about the pup and…” Tony trails off, deciding to divert his attention back on the device. Steve can’t help but frown. He wonders what he did or said that could’ve made Tony shut down.
“It was nothing,” Happy replies modestly. He smiles when Morgan yawns and opens her eyes for him. “You look so much like your dad,” he whispers to her. “I’m glad you’re here. You really do know how to make an entrance.”
“H-hey,” Peter greets, wringing his hands nervously, “I’m sorry. I’m sorry for making this difficult on everyone.”
No more missions; Steve kept his word and hung up the shield. It was a temporary hiatus. He’d probably continue saving the world once the baby was born, but for now he was home and preparing for their little one.
“Yes you can.” Bucky reaches into Steve’s belt, pulling out the item that he hopes will motivate his friend. He opens the compass and shows Steve the image inside. “Fight for him. Fight for your son. He needs you.”
Steve pulls off and uses his hand to stroke the hard flesh, his lips red and swollen and his pupils blown wide with arousal.
They fall into another silence, and when Tony glances down at his omega, he finds him fast asleep. Tony holds him close, and gently runs his fingers through Steve’s hair, hoping the gentle touches are enough to calm him. His sugary scent returns.
“Are you traveling back after the party?” Steve asks, even though he already knows the answer. Bruce never did stay more than he needed to. He would talk to Tony for a little while before he departed but that was it. Traveling back and forth must be exhausting. It made Steve wish he had just stayed back in New York. Maybe it would be easier for everyone then.
Most of the questions are about his medical history, which thankfully his papa steps in to answer. Peter sits quietly, listening to the adults talk until their voices drone out and he’s left staring numbly at the poster across from him.
He should be excited, but a part of him can’t get with the program. He’s heard the stories and the comments-mostly from his uncle-but he didn’t want to believe that his dad was that same person. Time was supposed to change a lot of things. He thought for sure it would’ve changed his dad too.
“Relax,” Sam assures with a small smile. He tries to sit up, wincing as he does. He waves his nephew off when Peter tries to help.
When he’s finished, he wipes his mouth with some toilet tissue and tosses it in the toilet and then flushes everything down. His stomach is still churning and the cramps haven’t gone away.
Harley points at the doorway, giggling happily when Tony comes in with the double stroller that carries their younger pups. Peter is fast asleep and Sarah is babbling to her new doll that Tony insisted she needed. It’s not until she notices Steve does her face light up and the doll is forgotten.
He grumbles behind his coffee cup and pretends to take interest in the contracts she places on his desk.
“Just a few days,” Tony reminds as if Steve had forgotten. “I love you and I’ll call you as soon as I can.”
Tony liked to spoil him, at least that’s what Steve had heard before. His birthday had been ridiculous and Steve was still finding confetti in the tower months later. Steve appreciated everything Tony did, but this Valentine’s Day, he didn’t want flowers, stuffed animals or gifts made of gold; all he wanted was Tony.
Steve bites down on his bottom lip and his brows pinch together. He was used to scenes like this playing out differently. It was usually the alphas forcing him to do what they wanted.
Tony’s smile brightens. He moves his hands to Steve’s hips. “Good. This is how it’s supposed to feel. Mating is supposed to feel like this. Try moving, sweetheart.”
“Not exactly,” Tony winces. “I haven’t told him yet okay! I don’t think I even want to. I just have my doubts and I want to make sure he’s really having my kid. Pepper already told me to kick him out and...and I can’t. I know I should but I can’t.”
“You look different…” Tony says, sound a little unsure. He sits up and gestures for Steve to come closer so he can get a better look. His hands immediately find their way to Steve’s stomach.
“Yeah. I mean, I know I wanted them once but I never thought we’d actually get to have a family. Not with our jobs and the fact that I was told this could never happen for me. And then we broke up…”
Tony chuckles and throws an arm around Bruce’s shoulder and leads him away. “This is me being nice. Unless you want to help out with the late night feedings?”
He’s not sure how long they’ve been locked together. Tony’s in some kind of a haze, the effects of his rut and the omega’s pheromones are too strong.
Steve does too. Maybe he was fine and there was nothing to worry about. He wasn’t going to stress about it. How could he when he had to worry about Tony and their baby?
“Something’s missing,” Sam says and brings his son over so that Steve can add his drawing. “He appreciates this. I know he does.”
“I don’t know. We’re not there yet. Look don’t worry alright? I can handle this and if it gets worse then-” Tony pats Happy on the shoulder. “-I have the best bodyguard in the world.”
Tony would be lying if he claimed he wasn’t wary about spending a week alone with his son. He saw how difficult it had been for Steve. Tony had to drop by Steve’s place a few times just to help. Steve had said Tony was great at getting Peter calm, and maybe he was, but he was still far from a perfect parent.
“Deal,” Tony holds out a hand for Peter to take. “Last chance. And if I fuck it up then you can disown me and kick my ass. I’d deserve it.”
“No. I mean...no. He’s just...adjusting. And believe me I get it. I’m trying to figure this out too.”
“I don’t know how to say this but...but I’m pregnant. That night at the party...Tony, I never intended for this to happen and I’m sorry that it’s taken me this long to say anything. I’m really scared and I don’t know what to do. I can’t have a baby right now. Not with the job I have and my duties as the team’s leader.
A part of him wants to answer the phone and tell his dad he’s thinking about him too and misses him, but the other half argues against it. Maybe he’s being too immature about this, but he wants his dad to feel just like his papa had for all those years.
“They need a new leader,” Steve says and he places one hand over his belly. “And they think this baby is it.”
After a few minutes, Peter’s had his fill and Steve lays him over his shoulder, gently patting his back to get a few good burps out of him.
Tony is awakened by the sound of whimpering. At first he thinks it’s Peter waking up for his middle of the night feeding, but the whimpers grow louder, more terrified, and Tony opens his eyes, allowing them to adjust to the darkness before turning toward his mate. It’s Steve.
The way Steve closes in on himself indicates that he’s uncomfortable talking about his torture. Tony doesn’t want to learn anymore if it’s going to upset him. At least, for now anyway. He’s still intrigued and wants to know more about Steve’s past, but he’d save that conversation for a later time.
“Hey, you’re up.” Bucky smiles. He seems a little brighter now, but Steve’s unsure if it’s because of the coffee or because Sam is home. He decides both.
Peter grabs a bunch of toilet paper, accidentally taking more from the roll and creating a mess. He curses and tries to fix it. The custodian didn’t need more added to his work load.
When they pull up to the tower, Peter isn’t surprised that they use the back entrance to avoid being seen. He’d be lying if he said it didn’t bother him. He wonders why his dad is hiding him. He doesn’t want to automatically assume the worst but he can’t help but feel like his dad is ashamed of him.
“Steve let him hang out with Ned all the time,” Sam says, ignoring the glare being sent his way. He holds his hand up in defense. “You know it’s true.”
“I will. I’m just...nervous. Plus I don’t want to interrupt them. Steve hasn’t-this is important to him and I don’t want to steal this moment away.”
The growl that rips through Steve’s throat has the alpha cowering, a small whimper escaping his bloodied lips. Seeing the alpha scared was something Steve never imagined. The alpha was always boasting about his strength and the power he had. But now Steve was the strong one. He was the dominant one. He was the alpha.
The alpha sighs heavily. “He wasn’t always the bad guy. Or at least not to me. Sometimes we don’t know people as well as we thought we did.”
Harley releases Tony’s hand and rushes toward his sister, throwing his arms around her waist. “Maguna! You came home!”
Even Tony drops the topic and decides to talk about work instead. Peter’s instantly distracted and enjoys discussing the new inventions or the trial and errors that occur in his dad’s lab every day. Steve can only sit back and listen, smiling to himself.
“I don’t know. I don’t want you to feel like you have to do this because it’s me. Tony, you made it clear that you didn’t want to-”
So Peter texts his dad on the first night the team leaves. Much to his surprise, his dad texts back and asks him to come over.
Peter offers his hand, a shaky breath leaving him at the feeling of holding his papa’s hand again. It felt so real.
“Need help?” Comes a familiar voice. Tony turns toward the voice, thanking his lucky stars it’s Natasha who’s walked in on him like this. They could tease each other every now and then, but a lot of the time she was ready to step in and help. Especially now when it came to her nephew.
Peter’s eyes are wide and bright when he enters the room and sees his baby brother for the first time.
Natasha’s expression shifts and she lays her hand over his. “Tony told us last night. We wanted to come earlier but you were asleep and visiting hours were over.”
He draws a spider in the middle of the suit and shades it in. He leans back to properly examine his work, smiling at what he finds. He hopes Peter likes it.
Tony smiles and curls up beside his husband, a sigh of content leaving his lips. Steve wraps an arm around him and brings him even closer. He presses a soft kiss to the side of his head.
“I’ll be right back, Mr. Stark.” Natalie makes sure to send him another smile before leaving the office.
“I really do know a guy. But if you want something simple then I can do that. Whatever you want, it’s yours.”
A shaky breath escapes him and he squeezes his eyes shut when they fill with tears. But as much as he tries to be strong, he just couldn’t be. He couldn’t be what everyone expected him to be. He couldn’t be Captain America.
A few minutes later, all three pups are gathered on the large sofa downstairs with warm milk and a plate of Oreo cookies. Steve can’t even find it in himself to be upset. Tony was just trying to help.
“You’re doing great. You’re so good with all of them. I’m sorry four pups are...unexpected. I know we had only planned the one but...I wouldn’t change anything. You’re perfect for me, for them. I don’t know what we’d do without you.”
“Hey, you’re not that guy anymore. So you messed up the kitchen sink. It’s not a big deal. You’re hurting right now. Steve was my friend too,but I can’t even imagine the pain you’re going through.”
But Peter is still managing to smile through it all. It’s not very bright and probably forced, but he’s smiling nonetheless. Just proof that he was the strongest among the two. Tony was weak, relying on his expensive liquor to ease the ache. He hides away and pretends that everything around him isn’t going to shit. Peter at least had the courage to face the world.
Bruce and Thor are occupying the chairs underneath the window, both holding gifts. Thor this time has chosen a more appropriate gift and he has a stuffed bear dressed to resemble him. Bruce has a bundle of balloons. There’s no sign of Clint, or Bucky and Sam. Steve’s heart sinks.
Steve lets out a sigh and decides to cut his run short. He was exhausted from a sleepless night and the bit of exercise he was able to complete. He frowns at that realization. He should be able to go longer.
When he doesn’t respond, Steve steps into the lab and says, “I guess we don’t have to try anymore. There would be no point, right? I’m putting you through this pain too.”
Sam whistles. “I forgot how strong you are. I didn’t study you as much as Riley did but I know some things. It’s a serum, right? It makes you this really big, strong dude?”
“He likes being here,” Steve says. He doesn’t say it out loud, but he enjoys being in Tony’s home. They were together with their son. They felt like a real family.
Steve hates that his first thought is Hydra. They weren’t a threat anymore, and yet Steve can’t help but fear that they have something to do with his family’s absence. Maybe he wasn’t as healed as he thought.
Sarah was quiet and liked to keep to herself. She enjoyed playing with the new toys daddy had gotten her. She only loses her temper when her older brothers try to intervene. That’s when she became feisty. Definitely a Rogers trait.
Steve chuckles and steps into the room, knowing better than to piss off his pregnant husband. Steve’s hands find their way to Tony’s jeans and it’s not long before he too is growing frustrated.
“No, nothing like that,” Tony says and Peter’s shoulders sag in disappointment. “Something...something very sad has happened....”
“Steve. Sweetheart, I’m sorry,” Tony apologizes, bringing their connected hands up to his lips and kisses Steve’s. “I’m so sorry. I never should’ve left.”
It’s not long before Steve’s falling asleep on Tony’s shoulder. The alpha kisses the omega’s head, and whispers the three words he promises to say for the rest of his life.
“Relax,” Sam places a hand over Peter’s shoulder to calm him. “He’s just giving you a hard time. If you want to go to school there that’s fine.”
“Thought about it. He called last night and he’s having these weird little pains. It’s nothing serious,” Tony says quickly when he catches the concerned look on Pepper’s face.
“Hurry up.” The alpha orders and pulls out his gun, aiming it for the beta’s head. “Don’t make me blow your brains out. The boss wants this quick.”
“Wait, kid!” Tony calls out and runs over. He pants for a minute to catch his breath. “I’m sorry. What happened back there-”
Steve had wanted to hold off on exposing his secret a little longer. Only his close friends knew and if Steve could have it his way, they’d be the only ones. The world didn’t need to know that the famous Captain America had a one night stand that resulted in an unplanned pregnancy. Especially if the other father was Tony Stark a.k.a Iron Man. The press would have a field day with that information.
“Whoa hang on. Disown you? I’m not disowning you, kiddo. I’m just…” Tony trails off with a sigh. “I’m scared. And yeah I know this is happening to you and not me but...but it still scares me that you have to deal with this.”
Peter chuckles and leans back in his seat, a sense of ease washing over him. The rest of the drive mostly consists of conversations circling around school and his friends. Happy makes sure not to bring up anything to do with Flash or the baby unless Peter was okay with it.
“He’s not coming home,” Bucky grumbles and shoves his phone in his husband’s face. Sam has to pull his head back slightly just to avoid being hit in the nose.
One glance around shows how much the Captain was loved. Candles, flowers, and other gifts have been left near the base of the statue. Tony feels even worse for not bringing anything to lay down.
Peter’s first instinct is to rush toward her, but he holds off and takes slow, cautious steps instead. Her guard is only down for a moment and as soon as he’s close enough, she whips her head in his direction.
“Hey, Petey,” Steve says softly to the bump, imagining that their son could hear him. The doctor said the baby could hear them and was moving, but that it was going to take a few more weeks for them to feel the movement. Time had already passed since then and they had yet to feel anything. “You’re probably sleeping, huh? You wore daddy out.”
“Please. I do forgive you, Tony, I do. I know what you did wasn’t you. You’re not like other alphas. You’re not like...him.”
“How do I know?” Peter questions. “How do I know you won’t listen to me when I need you? How do I know you won’t walk away when you can’t deal with me? You didn’t even hesitate to walk out on him. How do I know you won’t do the same?”
Steve smiles brightly and kisses Tony. “I’m gonna make breakfast and then plan this out,” he says the moment they break apart.
“Fuck!” Tony nearly shouts and Steve flinches from the outburst. “Sorry,” Tony apologizes, his tone a little calmer. He runs a hand through his hair and begins pacing, all while muttering every curse in the book.
“You almost died, jerk.” Bucky lowers himself down in the chair beside the bed and takes Sam’s hand, his thumb tracing the gold band on his finger. “Don’t ever do that shit again.”
But then the loud wail reaches his ears and he finds the strength to lift his head. A smile forms on his face at the sight of his son. Harley is gently placed on his chest, covered in blood and other fluids, but he’s absolutely perfect.
Bucky gives him another look over, clearly not convinced. “Okay. But if something changes you’ll actually tell me, right? Lord knows how many times you’ve kept things from me.”
Steve attempts to get up, but then he’s registering the pain in his side and he slumps back against the wall. He presses his hand on the wound, hissing from the intense burning that flares up.
“Hey, Pete,” Steve greets with a soft smile. His smile falters quickly when he takes in his son’s appearance. “That bad, huh?”
Wrong words. Steve mentally scolds himself. That little voice reminds him of the feelings he has for the alpha. He argues with it. He doesn’t have any feelings for Tony. They were just strangers.
“It is, but I promise it’s a good difference. Look what you did.” Tony gestures to the happy baby just a few feet away from them. “Look at her. We have her because of you.”
They fall into a silence. Steve returns his gaze back to his son, watching intently as he nurses. He’s gentle when he decides to touch him, treating his son like he’s made of glass. He runs his hand up and down the baby’s back, freezing when his son squirms from the contact.
Steve makes himself comfortable in the chair beside his husband and takes his hand, rubbing it soothingly and encouraging Tony when the pain is at its worst. His stomach tightens again, this time more intense than before, and it pulls a pained gasp from him. Tony lifts his head from the pillows, a frown appearing over his face.
“You wanted to know how I’m feeling. I still can’t really describe it, but the closest thing I can compare it to is drowning. It’s like no matter how hard I try to swim to the surface, the waves keep pushing me down. I try and scream for help; for you, but you can’t hear me. No one can.”
Eventually he has the men down and the room clear of any threats. He checks the wound on his shoulder, relief washing over him when he realizes the bullet has only grazed him. He just needed to be patched up and he’d be good as new.
He’s no longer in bed, deciding that he’d rather walk around to get things moving along. His water had yet to break, and judging by the way his contractions were coming, he was sure it would break soon.
Steve sighs harshly. “What about the team? We’re supposed to be doing this job together and now you’re just going to walk away?”
A sound from behind them captures Natasha’s attention and she pulls her gun out and whips around, ready to shoot any approaching threats. She lowers it when Bucky steps forward, his own gun raised. He does the same when he notices them, then he catches sight of the state his best friend is in and he rushes toward them.
“He’s almost there,” Sam assures, and he sends Steve a wink. “You’re a lot stronger than you think, Steve.”
“What else does he need?” Tony asks, moving along the aisles and studying the shelves. “Probably more clothes, but we can hit that section later. Bottles? Or are you going to…” he waves a hand around his chest, causing Steve to blush.
But that scene never played out. Tony had left. He left Steve, their son, and the rest of the team. He threw away his family like they were disposable. Family wasn’t disposable. Family wasn’t perfect, but none of the members deserved the harsh treatment Tony gave them.
But he wasn’t going to give up. He wanted Steve to be himself again, he wanted him to be happy and enjoy life again. That Steve was still in there. It was just going to take some time to get him back.
Tony huffs and pulls himself to his feet. “I guess you’d rather stay in there instead of having some of the delicious lunch Papa made.”
“I know.” Tony nods. “We can talk about this later okay? Right now I need to get you down to medical.”
Steve comes over to greet his daughter and mate. Sarah begins growing fussy when she isn’t immediately given attention to. Steve chuckles and sets Harley down, then he unfastens his daughter and takes her into his arms, kissing her and hugging her the way he had with her brother.
“I can’t.” Steve shakes his head. More tears are beginning to form and stream down his face. “It hurts.”
Tony claimed that he didn’t care what Steve looked like. He even went as far as to say that Steve had never looked more beautiful. It’s all a lie. It had to be. There was no way Tony truly believed that.
Saark started to open his mouth, and then closed it. His eyes fluttered shut, lashes brushing against his cheek, and Ste-Virn did his best not to notice as those eyes slowly opened. “Of course, Master R’Garr. We’ve been apart from one another for a long time. I believe your new master took you only a few months before I was taken as well. We both grew up, and haven’t been in one another’s orbit for years. Seven, at least, I feel.”
Saark shrugged, a fluid motion that drew attention to his shoulders and arms—one that Ste-Virn viciously quashed. His feelings on this matter were pushed down and repressed, and he would strive to keep them there. “I was a child—headstrong, foolish, and angry. It was unacceptable, the way I treated you and the way I treated Knight Kulsi. He helped me, but I know that I said many words in anger, and never apologized for them.”
, “I need to apologize, Steve. I should have gone through Stane’s staff, not just identified who he was. I should have done my job well, and I did not—”
Stark barked out a laugh, and a tiny thread of tension seemed to easy from his shoulders and neck. “Yeah, we probably didn’t look like the most stable bunch of adults, did we? But they—the team—they were really good. All disappeared on me, of course, none of them wanted to come back to my tower, but we worked together.” Then he squinted at Clint, leaned back in his chair. “In the right light, you know, you might even be one of them.”
“I guess I’ll see you around,” MJ says. She doesn’t leave right away, and it makes Peter wonder if she has more she wants to say. But she never does.
“Hey,” Tony takes on a warning tone. “Steve was not there. All he did was call me for help and I helped.”
He wants to believe every word that came out of Steve’s mouth, but he's torn. The things Steve told him just weren’t adding up. Was Steve really abused and held captive all those years? Was he really from a different time period and frozen? Did they really meet and Tony sired the pup Steve swore was in his belly?
“Hey! Watch who you’re calling old,” Bucky says and throws an old magazine at his husband. Sam dodges the attack and laughs.
Tony opens his mouth to respond, only for the words to get lost and a curse leaving his lips instead. Peter grins and applies more of the ointment, emitting another curse from his dad.
With her down, he decides to reach out to Natasha, only to find out that she wasn’t available to babysit.
The AI sighs harshly. “You really need to be careful with what you say. Sometimes I wonder if you’re aware of the way you run your mouth.”
Steve takes her over to the rocking chair and carefully lowers himself down. He adjusts her, making sure she’s comfortable before he starts rocking back and forth.
Steve brings him closer, pressing his lips to the top of his son’s wet head. “Shh, I’m here. I’m right here,” Steve soothes.
It’s not until Thor is there and the blue sky returns does the toddler grow excited over another family member.
“I’m pretty much done here,” Tony is already rising to his feet and sticking his phone back into his pocket.
Dodger barks again, this time tugging on the sleeve of Tony’s shirt and pulling him forward. Tony immediately knows he needs to follow him and he rises to his feet. He catches movement from the entryway of his lab and he glances up, eyes locking with pain-filled blue ones.
He hits that spot everytime, forcing an array of curses and moans past Tony’s lips. His cock twitches in Steve’s hand, the tip leaking and spilling over Steve’s hand.
“Yeah. I struggled, but I made it work for you. Peter, don’t ever think for a second that you were a mistake or that my life would have been better without you. Your dad and I love you so much.”
“No,” Tony shakes his head and places his hands over Steve’s, taking them off his shirt and connecting their hands instead. Steve opens his eyes, revealing fresh tears. “I don’t want to lose you. Morgan...she needs you the most. You’re going to leave all of that behind.”
The three of them haven’t been this close since the day Morgan was born. Everything had been different then. They had just welcomed their little girl and had a new journey to embark on. They had never anticipated it to be easy, but they never imagined the devastating pain that awaited them.
Peter frowns and peers up at his dad. “No you didn’t. I didn’t see you at the base. I snuck inside and you weren’t there.”
“Yep.” Bucky shuts the tv off and makes his way to the kitchen. Peter makes sure to remind his uncle to add extra jelly, and Bucky gives him a thumbs up in response.
“Pete,” Bruce is calmer when he speaks, a complete contrast to the other version of himself. “You shouldn’t be here. These missions are dangerous. You could’ve been seriously injured or-”
He finds Ned first. They talk a bit about last night’s homework and possibly hanging out come the weekend, but then the small talk ends and Peter knows what’s coming next.
The scent is intoxicating, waking up the alpha inside of him, luring Tony in to claim the omega. To fuck. To breed.
“Will you stop!” Pepper cries in frustration. Tony blinks a few times as he tries to register her last words. He had zoned out again.
The silence between them seems to go on forever. Steve should say something, anything at this point. Hell he’d rather talk about the weather if it meant ending the torturous silence.
Tony smiles and brings Steve closer, then kisses him softly on the forehead. “Don’t worry. You’re safe now.”
“I’m sorry,” Steve gives his condolences. He couldn’t imagine losing his mate. He’d be nothing without Tony.
More drama! Don’t worry Tony will apologize and all will be well again....for now. Just wait until Tony shows Peter the last voicemail 😈
Bruce approaches Peter’s side and smiles warmly. “I need you to unbutton your jeans and lift your shirt.”
Ned was a good kid. He still got tongue-tied around Steve, but that was to be expected when talking to one of the Avengers. Steve saw a lot of his own friendships in the one the two kids created over the years.
“I miss home. I miss you and Morgan and all of our friends. But I know this is good for me, for us. It’s just a lot harder than I thought it was going to be,” Steve admits.
“Okay. Here let me help you with um…” Tony’s face flushes at the realization of helping Steve out of his sweatpants.
“He knows me,” Tony replies. “It’s a long, long story. I don’t have all the details and I wish I did. I don’t even fully understand it. All I know is we met somehow and he’s pregnant with my kid.”
The first thing he does is run into the bathroom to check on his appearance. It’s not until he realizes it’s just Flash does Peter stop himself from fixing his hair.
Steve crawls over to Tony and curls up against him, burying his nose into the crook of the alpha’s neck and inhaling his scent. Tony touches him this time, wrapping his arms around Steve’s frame and holding him close. It’s not long before Steve is purring.
Steve is still panting hard, his chest glistening with sweat and flushed darker than before. Tony gives him a moment to compose himself. The other alphas probably never did.
Soooo....this one has some more drama between these two. I swear I’ll leave them alone and let them be happy!
Steve smiles softly and caresses Tony’s cheek. “It’s okay. I’m giving my consent. At least you made sure to wait until I did.”
The alert from JARVIS is what jolts Tony awake. Tony grumbles and buries his face back into the pillow, inhaling the familiar and comforting scent of his husband. He had grown used to sleeping near Steve to the point where he required him if he wanted to get any sleep. Now that he was pregnant and falling asleep before eight, he didn’t rely so much on his husband’s presence, but he still missed the warmth and security only Steve could give.
Alexander’s gaze doesn’t soften, nor does his grip on Steve. “I’m very disappointed in you, Omega. First you run away-again might I add- and now this. You need to know your place. Maybe a refresher will do you some good.”
The elevator arrives and the doors open, interrupting their conversation. Peter doesn’t make any effort to keep it going, knowing what kind of direction it was heading in. He didn’t want to discuss living situations when he wasn’t sure who he wanted to live with.
“True, but I for one don’t really care what people think. Stopped worrying about it years ago. But if it makes you that uncomfortable then we can leave.”
Steve takes a deep breath and blows it out. His free hand clenches and unclenches; Tony has never seen him so nervous.
“H-hey,” Peter stutters under their burning gaze. His uncle Bruce looks disappointed, but it’s the fiery, pissed off look on his uncle Sam’s face that lets him know what’s coming next. “I can explain-”
“This kid isn’t even born yet and already he’s spoiled,” Tony jokes and makes himself comfortable on the sofa, blowing out a breath when his ability to breathe is stolen for a moment. “He’s definitely awake now,” Tony grumbles and rubs at his belly, releasing a small groan of discomfort when Peter decides he hasn’t had enough of pressing against Tony’s ribs.
Tony attends to Morgan and changes her in a fresh diaper, then he prepares a bottle for her and takes her out with him to the living room. He lowers himself down on the couch and cradles her in his arm. The minute he offers the bottle, she latches on and nurses greedily.
It’s embarrassing and unusual for him to be acting like this. He does start to wonder if maybe Natasha was right. It wasn’t just her urging him to take a test or see a doctor. Tony would probably drag him down to medical if he could.
He can’t help but wonder if maybe this pup was different than the others and had the serum. Steve quickly shakes his head from that thought. He doesn’t want to worry about that, not when he had bigger problems.
“Hmm.” Steve ponders. The more he thought about leaving and starting over, the more appeasing it sounded. “Maybe once the pup is born.”
Steve’s hand flies down to the wound to apply pressure, but the blood pours out, coating his gloves in the red liquid. Steve knows he needs to keep moving and he pushes forward, each step causing a flare of pain. He sways and backs into the wall, breaths coming out as heavy pants.
This time Tony turns himself to properly look at Steve. He doesn’t spot any obvious signs of his depression, but he still can’t help but feel hesitant to leave him. He can’t shake the feeling. He reminds himself that Steve was making significant improvement. The support group was helping him cope with the pent up feelings and the pills...well, they needed to be upped a dose.
His disguise of a baseball cap and sunglasses didn’t always work, but today he hoped it would pull through. The last thing he wanted was someone to recognize him shopping for baby items.
Yikes Tony lost his temper. Don’t worry he’s not a bad guy in this fic. He’s just upset but he’ll come around. Poor Peter needs all the love and support ❤️
Steve glances down at his son, hesitant to let him go when he just got him back in his arms. But there was something about this alpha. Steve had initially thought she was a threat, but she was proving that perhaps not all alpha’s were bad. Maybe she was one of the good ones.
A soft knock on the door interrupts and Steve pulls away, settling his teary eyes on the doctor. Bruce smiles softly and steps into the room.
“Uh-huh.” Tony lies and pulls his hand away. He picks up his tablet and pretends to work again, hoping Steve would drop it and go to bed. He was complaining that he was tired all the time anyway.
They share a smile, and it’s at that moment when Steve realizes that not all alphas were bad. There were still some good ones in the world. And he was lucky enough to consider one a friend.
“We’re so excited to meet you,” Steve continues to talk to their son in a soft voice. “Just a few more months and you’ll be here. I can’t wait to hold you for the first time. I promise daddy’s excited too. He’s just…” Steve sighs. “He’s just tired. And a little cranky. He can’t have coffee anymore. But he loves you so much. And so do I.”
Tony deepens the kiss and gently lowers Steve back down. His lips attach to Steve’s neck, teasing the spot the omega desperately wants touched. He doesn’t spend too much time marking up the unblemished skin and he moves down lower until he’s peppering kisses along Steve’s chest.
The room is brighter now, a clear indication that it was well into the morning. It’s tempting to go back to sleep, his body demands more rest, mostly due to the extra work it’s being put through to care for the pup. Steve lies back with a huff, one hand coming up to run through his slightly damp hair. He rolls over, bringing one of the large pillows close and breathes in the comforting scent of the alpha.
Natasha comes over with a couple of gift bags and hands them to Steve to pass out. Tony snatches the one with cute safari animals and rips the tissue paper out, letting it land on the floor near his feet.
This is such a mess and poor Steve is so broken and Tony feels so guilty and awful. They’re going to talk some more in the next chapter. And I’ll bring in another character. Steve needs to find out how his baby’s doing.
Steve understood his fiancé was busy, but Tony’s absence couldn’t have come at a worse time. They had only moved into their new home a few days ago and unpacking still wasn’t done. Their friends had helped when they could, but the Avengers were busy too.
Steve is up bright and early, ready to start a new day. The sky is still dark, just the way Steve likes it. He hasn’t been on a run in a while-being a parent meant sacrifices-but now that his son was old enough, it was time he tagged along.
He wanders around until he finds himself in what appears to be a common room. Just one glance at the space lets him know that this is where the Avengers do more than just unwind after grueling missions. He knows parties and other celebrations have been enjoyed here. Peter had talked about movie nights, and he wonders if this was the place where he and Steve would do it. Maybe the whole team joined them.
“Hey,” Tony urges Steve to look at him and Steve turns in his arms until their eyes are meeting. “Don’t say that. The last one wasn’t your fault.”
“Hey,” Tony’s soothing voice is what snaps Steve’s from his thoughts. The omega lifts his head to meet his alpha’s eyes. He shifts in his seat, suddenly finding the plush leather uncomfortable. Tony gives him a small smile and takes his hand, intertwining their fingers. “Talk to me. What’s going on?”
“You don’t think I’m trying? Coming back here seems like proof, doesn’t it? Do you know how hard it was to come back?”
“Hey.” Tony smiles and steps further into the room, his eyes immediately landing on the bundle in his husband’s arms. His smile grows wider. “Wow. She’s here.”
He had other options. He could give the baby to a family that wanted to have a child. Maybe there was someone out there meant to care for his baby. Someone who could provide all the love and care in the world.
Tony scoffs. “Yeah, that’s going to go well. Once he finds out I’m not comfortable with him being alone with our baby he’ll lose his mind. I don’t know. I’ll figure it out.”
Peter arrives at the tower later than he expected, but he’s not worried. It wasn’t like he used the main entrance anyway. He wonders if one day he’ll get the chance.
The plan goes south fast. As soon as the jet comes to a stop, Peter assumes they’ve landed, and he gives himself a few moments before stepping out of his hiding spot. He didn’t want to be seen just yet.
Perhaps too slow. The alpha in him was demanding Tony throw out their plans to wait and mate with the omega, but he fights the urge. He was out of bed before Steve could even wake and he rushed downstairs to hide away. He didn’t trust himself to do something stupid, and he promised he’d never hurt Steve like that again.
Nick nods. “It was going to happen eventually. Hopefully I won’t need to drag you out of retirement, but if I do-”
Those breaks he tried to give his husband never lasted very long. Morgan would get hungry and only Steve was able to fill that need. It was a special bonding time for them. Feeding her was Steve’s alone time with Morgan. At first, Steve had been happy to nurse, but little by little, that too changed.
“Think of Pete,” Tony smiles and brushes back the damp strands of hair that have fallen in Steve’s face. “You have to do this for him. Your pup.”
The air around them is different; it’s tinged sour with the rage the alpha gives off. Steve can’t help but cower in fear. He knew what angry alphas led to.
Steve forces himself to meet the doctor’s eyes. He can’t hold his gaze for long and he peers down again, shifting uncomfortably in his seat and trying to fight back the pitiful whine that’s trying to crawl out his throat.
After her cocoa and gushing about the cute boy in math class, Morgan deems herself ready to face her parents. She had ignored all of their texts and phone calls. She had only been gone an hour but to them it probably seemed like longer.
Maybe the serum wasn’t working on him anymore. Maybe it was the bit of depression he found himself in that prevented him from truly understanding the beauty it was to bring a new life into the world.
He doesn’t get a chance to respond to her. The man is coming toward him again. Steve moves quickly to stand, only to pause when the pain returns. He tries to ignore it and rise to his feet, but he’s not quick enough and he gasps in pain when he’s kicked in the stomach. He goes down, unable to find the strength to get back up. But he knows he has to.
“Yeah,” Steve stammered, nodding. “Hank Pym made me quite a few before I left. I shouldn't have a problem.”
After the bath Tony had toweled Peter off before putting on a diaper. He still had no idea whether or not Peter was potty trained, but he was too tired to ask and he didn’t want to deal with an accident in a new bed. From there the two ventured into Peter’s bedroom where they went through the closet and dresser. There were a few outfits that Pepper had supplied, but none were suitable for sleeping. Tony assumed she had it on her list of things to get, but he would remind her, just in case. - Right. He still needed to do that.
To say that Tony was tired was an understatement. He had only gotten a few hours of sleep before Steve had called him, and there was no way he could get sleep with all the events that had occured since. All Tony could do was numbly stare out the window from the medical wing of the compound.
“Morning daddy!” Peter replied back as he pushed himself up onto his knees, rubbing his face with small fists to get the sleep out of his eyes. “And yeah I did. I like your bed better than mine though. It’s nice and hard.”
“Did you say my bed is hard?” Tony asked as his browns pulled together in confusion. “I’ll have you know that I have a very nice and comfortable bed.
“That is enough Tony Stark,” Pepper warned one more time as she let go of Tony’s head. “I’m done trying to deal with your self pity. You can either accept that you make mistakes, forgive yourself, and move on, or I will just go back to New York.” Tony’s eyes widened and he bit his lip as he looked down at his lap.
The little boy was a little wary when Pepper pulled out the scissors but Tony was quick to distract him. After one quick Google search for “popular children’s cartoons” Tony decided on the show
“Well...my bed is really squishy. I don’t like it.” Peter explained. “Your’s is hard...it’s nice.” Peter said, giving Tony a reassuring smile.
“Friday, order some diapers and baby formula. And get a list from Rita about what the younger kids need. And ask Bailey and Samantha if they need anything. If they do, get it for them. And tell Rita to get a bed ready for Peter, he still needs to be evaluated.” Tony said as he scrubbed his face with his hand. With that he turned back to Steve and Peter. The super soldier was just quietly looking down at Peter as the boy leaned into the side of his arm, holding the plushie tightly to his chest. “I’ll take it from here Cap,” Tony then said as he discarded the gloves.
“I know you think I mess everything up—” Saark began, hissing, shoulders tight and tense, and Ste-Virn had a brief vision of a much younger Saark, less controlled, more puffed up, hair ruffled like feathers and hands spread wide and eyes flashing, the room a mess, torn up from their fight. Ste-Virn would punch things, in his anger, and Saark would throw things. It was on that that Jedi Knight Kulsi walked in on, and stared in disappointment at the two young Padawans.
Taking a deep breath, Natasha blew it out, and tried not to let her hands shake. “I know—I know he will not take it well. At first, it was because we were too new, we didn’t know each other, we… didn’t work. But we work, now, and we want to know Tony—and want him to know us.”
There was a long period of silence, to the point that Ste-Virn was opening his eyes to see if they had gotten disconnected, when Byu-Kyonn said quietly, “Ain’t that what yer doin’, now? Revisitin’ yer past, so y’can heal an’ move on? You wanna know what ya missed, back then. What y’ didn’t see in ‘im, an’ why he rubbed ya th’ wrong way. I know you, Steev, I know you too well t’think that y’brought this up fer no reason. Yer conflicted, an’ I’m sure yer crush th’ size of th’ galaxy ain’t helpin’—”
“What do you think you’re doing?” Natasha asked quietly directly behind him, making him yelp and jump two feet into the air.
There was no movement at all, and then a soft exhalation before Tony stood up. His hands went to his pants almost immediately, and Steve hastily said, “No, no—don’t, keep them on, that’s not—no, don’t do that.”
“I knew how to make the bombs, though. But I also knew how to build other things. MIT, after all. And I was desperate.”
This was his first big, major case, and he had been looking forward to completing it. It was the first real test of his ability to investigate and help others.
A wry smile curled the corner of Kulsi’s mouth. “He did request, yes. A month, two months ago, thereabout. We were not going to honor his request until we realized your cases were one-and-the-same. He thought we had denied his request—”
“Be sure to check-in soon, and send your reports. You have worried a lot of people. We had hoped that you two could work out your differences.” Master W’Lsinn’s face flickered, then steadied. “Where are you that transmissions are this weak?”
you from running headfirst into danger,” Ste-Virn replied, knowing his voice showed his stress and fear. The signal had frozen two days ago, and Ste-Virn, in the small ship he’d chartered to follow the signal around, had nearly had a panic attack.
like I’m about to fall over.” Gingerly, he moved to sit down next to Ste-Virn and then leaned his head back against the wall. “I’m sorry.”
The one thing they had not tried to do—though Saark had tried to float this idea at the very beginning—was put one of them out as bait.
Steve blinked, and glanced at Natasha, who looked equally surprised. “No…” he said slowly. “We just assumed—there’s almost no male omegas in the military.”
“Is compromised, at best. At worse, it looks like he has a spice addiction. And just because some of the guards can identify slavers does not mean that the slavers actively gave them beings. It does not mean that any Indenaturing Mining high official knew about this. I need something more.”
But all Saark did was mutter and walk down the hallway towards the small room their pilots had provided.
Turning the corner to come to the kitchen, where Natasha was sitting at the table and Barton was perched on the island. Steve stepped forward, lightly tugging his arm away, and Tony released it instantly—and then began sinking to his knees against the wall.
“Ah shit,” Tony muttered, glancing hastily at the clock—and then froze, one eye sliding to look at Steve.
Saark cut a sharp look at him, eyes almost too-bright, seeing too much. Ste-Virn fought not to flinch, to meet Saark’s eyes head-on.
“Well, I was recalled as well to speak with you, but I had set up a transport for myself to be taken into Ryloth through back channels. The transport is one I suspect that helps ferry kidnapped and enslaved beings into Ryloth’s mines, or being shuffled into more legitimate-looking transports. As you heard, my investigation suggests that the workers in the mines are not free and able to leave when they like; they are slaves, and they have no where else to go. Two or three planetary systems have voiced their concerns with this…” Ste-Virn trailed off as he flipped through his information to bring up the names. “Ah, here—Kalinda, Lorahns, and Zhar. These small systems all have anti-slavery laws, and are concerned by some of the reports come from the mines.”
Now that Steve could place the voice, he could also place the scent—metal and motor oil, a little bit of ozone? Burning air? What would that be called?—and he sucked in a deep breath. “Cold,” he muttered.
Rumlow’s face flattened out, became blank. “Look, you can’t control how teams treat their omegas—” he began, but there was no fire in it. No passion.
