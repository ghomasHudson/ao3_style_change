“What do you want from me?” Tony asks, squeezing his eyes shut. He says it again, again, until he’s shouting it: “What! What do you
“Sometimes love isn’t enough,” Jim persists, but he’s out of luck with that tack. Steve couldn’t agree more.
“What’s wrong with Nat?” Clint says, expression sharpening, and Tony swallows.
“You want me to be nicer to him,” Tony sneers, but Shuri only rolls her eyes.
“Okay, honey, time for bed,” she says with the kind of ebullient false cheer that parents have been perfecting for aeons. She glances over towards Steve. “Sorry, Steve.”
There’s a moment of silence where he can feel Widow glaring at him, but she eventually does as requested. It’s the most logical tactical decision, after all.
Tony laughs. He glances up to approximately where he must think Steve’s head should be. It’s closer to his neck from where he’s crouched on the floor, but the considering expression on his face is relaxed. Amused, almost.
In the following weeks, Tony doesn’t make much progress on Steve’s killer. Eventually, what always happens to him happens again: he begins to lose focus. Steve thinks maybe someone else would be upset that Tony doesn’t keep on his monomaniac quest for vengeance, but a dead Steve is still a Steve that worries for Tony. He’s just glad that Tony stops driving himself into the ground.
“JARVIS, could you order some burgers for me and Hulk?”
“You better be big spoon,” Clint said, and Steve snorted despite himself. He slipped under the covers and turned to lay on his side, facing Clint. He draped a tentative arm over Clint’s middle, and was rewarded with Clint shuffling back a little until they were sharing heat, not quite pressed up against each other, but enough for Steve to find a bit of comfort in their proximity. “Stop overthinking everything and go the fuck to sleep.”
“Look,” Tony tries, “if you didn’t want the job you would have already turned it down. But you didn’t. You left the door open because you want it. So I’m telling you that you can have it. This works out, Steve. You said you’re just meant to cover for Barton. I’m working through SI’s transition. It’ll just be for a little while. A few months at the most. We can still talk. You can call me whenever you want. Think of it like a break. Did they have those in the 40’s? They must have.”
“Spidey,” Tony says. It’s quiet, which makes Steve nervous. Tony’s quiet anger is perhaps the worst part of him. It is the most dangerous part: the fire that has crafted him into the kind of man that can kill in the same breath as he saves a life.
“We’re going to dinner,” Rogers said, stubborn now, and Tony let himself be bundled towards Jarvis’ house. There was a long pause. “And then, maybe, if you’re good, we can play a few hands at the forge.”
“Welcome home, Captain,” JARVIS tells him when he steps into the elevator. “I hate to trouble you when you’ve just arrived, but there’s a situation that requires your attention in the Avengers’ communal living room.”
You will love again the stranger who was your self.
Steve pulls open the stairwell door and pushes Tony ahead of him, letting the door slam shut behind them even as he’s crowding Tony up against the wall.
Steve nods, slipping into stiff military attention the way he always does when he’s nursing a hurt. Then he turns and heads back up the stairs towards the elevator, tension strung across his broad shoulders.
“Two minutes,” Bruce promised. “I left the compound to release the masks in the quinjet’s medkit. It’s a little brown glass bottle. Use the dropper along the edges of the seal and it’ll slide right off.” There was a slight pause. “Considering the situation, Captain, I am going to have to insist that you go home.”
Steve listened with a small smile, accepting bites as Tony offered them. He wasn’t even sure that Tony was aware that he was doing it, his instinctual need to feed Steve kicking in as he focussed on giving Steve a history of Chinese-American migration from the 1800’s to present-day. Still, there was something guarded about him, something he wasn’t telling Steve. The moment had passed, though, and it was too late to ask him, especially now that he seemed to be settling a bit. So Steve smiled, and let Tony feed him, and asked questions at the appropriate moments. He could bring it up the next time Tony took his medication.
The woman interviewing him was a blonde that Steve didn’t recognise, but Tony had an easy rapport with her that spoke to a casual acquaintance. Tony was just the slightest bit realer with her than he was with the average reporter. It was something Steve had only seen with a handful of journalists, ones that Tony really respected.
“We took a vote,” Bruce says mildly, and Tony pauses, because,
“And you?” Xavier asks. Steve raises his eyebrows at him, not understanding his meaning. “Did you cry?”
"Cockblock," Tony sing-songs. It's worth it for Steve's bright blush; Clint's stuttering response is just the cherry on top. "Can you hear him, JARVIS?"
for a hundred miles through the desert repenting.
Tony nods, a short, curt thing, and Steve lets out a breath.
“I pushed you up against the suit, Tony,” Steve says, sounding tired. “If you had protested, I wasn’t…you froze up and I just kept going until you
“And Steve’s not back yet?”
Outside, true to form, Logan is staring down at Steve’s Softtail with a covetous expression on his craggy face. An unlit cigar hangs from his mouth, and Steve considers him, arms folded over his chest.
“Hey,” he said, quietly, and Rogers blinked sleepy blue eyes open at him, smiling easily. “Can you eat a bit of this for me?”
PTSD galore
“You’re a bad man,” Tony croaks, and Steve cracks a grin at him. “Please go shower. Now.” God, he’d almost forgotten about the damn eight pack. Tony didn’t even know some of those muscles could be visible on the human body outside of anatomical models, before he met Steve. The man is honestly unreal.
“I love you,” Steve says, and oh, that hurts. That hurts worse than Tony could have possibly imagined it would. “Tony-”
“Does Tony need any other kind of medical attention?” Steve asked, stubborn. There was a telling pause.
“Well.” The priest hums. “First off, lusting after your soulmate is quite natural, and even mostly permissible in scripture, so I think we can let that one slide.”
“You want to leave Loki where he can piss off the other guy?” Then he shakes his head. “No, that’s the point. I’m the prison guard.”
, he thinks, is a funny thing. It hurts,
“I’ll come back, to say goodnight,” Steve repeated. Then he turned, and headed for the door. He wouldn’t have the strength to leave, otherwise. Already he’d spent two awful, freezing cold nights down here this past week, Tony howling and pounding ineffectually against the glass to try to reach him on the other side. He’d cried so much that he wasn’t sure how there was any liquid left to spare in his body.
been told it’s an excellent asset for a soldier to have in the field.” He leans down and slides an arm under Tony’s, pulling their torsos flush together. “Hmmm.”
Give wine. Give bread. Give back your heart
“Sir is in the workshop. He has not eaten anything solid since Wednesday night, before the mission.”
“Hi,” Tony says, maybe a little breathlessly.
“Well,” Tony murmured, “I kinda thought you liked hanging out with me.”
Pepper blinks at him. "So what's this, then? You know I can't do this, Tony. We agreed this was the last time-"
Steve whimpered, getting desperate but not quite there yet, but Tony just hushed him. He kissed him slow and searing for what felt like ages, tongues sliding wetly together inside Steve’s mouth. He reached down to toy with Steve’s nipples, rocking into him steadily, and Steve could feel tears now. The tension built higher in his spine with every stroke of Tony’s fingers over his pebbled skin.
Tony considers this, then slides to the side, moving back in the direction of the quinjet. Natasha’s expression could cut steel, and Tony makes sure to keep a wide berth, chuckling a little at Loki’s shit eating grin. Bastard.
“Tony!” Steve manages. He’s unaccountably glad that Tony can’t see his face. He stumbles forward and gathers himself, then gently presses his hand into Tony’s. As soon as he’s sure it’s solid, he scrambles into Tony’s space, cupping his cheek. He presses their foreheads together.
One calloused finger pressed deep inside him, a shock that sent him scrabbling at the sheets.
“Yes, sir, and may I say how glad I am to hear your voice?”
“Call JARVIS, if you need us,” he says, finally.
The second Sight Bond pair Tony met were Rhodey’s grandparents, and that was the one, if anything, that might have made him believe that maybe true love was possible. They’d been together fifty seven years, and they stayed that way until they died within days of each other. But Tony had almost never seen them apart, and the idea of needing someone that much terrifies him. Tony is uncompromisingly free. It is the part of himself that he loves most, and that he clings to with force. Tony is his own man. He does what he wants, creates things beyond most people’s wildest dreams, and doesn’t care what anyone else thinks of him. The idea of being inextricably tied to someone in such a visceral way for the rest of his life is the most terrifying thing that Tony has ever come up against—more than captivity, or the dark expanse of enemy-laden space, or cardiac arrest. Even the love that shone in their eyes when they looked at each other wasn’t enough to circumvent the knowledge that their bond was antithetical to the way that Tony prefers to live his life. Even now, with a Sight Bond of his own, he hasn’t shaken that fear. He’s self-aware enough to know that much of the way he reacts to Steve is a manifestation of it: the worry that Steve’s old-fashioned sensibilities might spell the end of everything about his life that Tony actually likes.

to Bruce: Oops, I think there's a pic of your dick on my phone
to Jane: Waoh chillax, just cause you were so drunk you passed out for three days doesn't mean it was the case for everyone.

to Peter: Fucker.
to Miles: like a incubus or whatvs

to Tony: You do know he's back in the US, right?
to Kate: Want drinks instead ?

to Miles: BUT I'M SITTING BETWEEN HIS SISTER AND HIS BROTHER IN LAW NOW!!!!
to Natasha: Anyway, wanna come over and watch a movie?
to Peter: WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING???
to Kate: Hey! At least we didn't have sex in front of her dog
to May: And what did he do??
to Phil: Yeah, but goods news is that we can finally stop feeling guilty after giving each other drunken lap dances.
to Tony: Last time you tried to set me up with someone, I almost ended up in jail
to Charles: Wait no, you're the Darwin. Being the Hank means that no one wants you
to Kate: and if it makes you fell any better, you'll probably never have any dog see you naked anymore
to Thor: your snapchat, facebook, twitter and instagram
to Steve: Nine minutes back home, and you're already fucking up and ending in jail for some guy.
to Sif: How do you even know I was gone?
to Loki: Do you guys know each other since kindergarten too?
to Mack: mack wait!!!!!!!!
to Darcy: I know right????
to Darcy: I hate her
to America : will you buy me something to replace his dick if I dump him ?
to Bob: I swear buddy, i'll find the right woman for you
to Mack: okay i see your point.
to Tony: Is it really that hard to put your dirty dishes in the dishwasher?
“I’ve been lying to you,” Steve said, and saying it felt like someone had slashed a knife through his lungs, all the air whistling out of him in a rush. “I knew. I’ve known for a long time.”
“Gelato,” Steve agreed, smiling. Tony grinned at him, handsome and his, and Steve leaned in to taste the chocolate lingering at the corners of his mate’s mouth. “Mm. Tastes better on you.”
“I’m not weak,” he says, and Steve laughs, eyes crinkling beautifully in the bright sunlight. His expression is openly fond as he tips his head back and stares at the clean, clear sky.
Loki: *opens a portal into the abyss, screams*
He wanted to be good for Tony. He wanted Tony to come in, and see his omega waiting patiently for him, and know that he was loved more than anything else in the world. He wanted Tony’s eyes to flash dark and possessive, wanted the proprietary way he smoothed his hands over Steve’s flanks, his thighs, his back. He wanted the way Tony sounded when he was hungry for him, voice low and rumbling and rough. He wanted Tony to press inside him and make him feel so good it hurt, until he cried. He wanted so badly.
“Mute!”
Tony hasn’t had marathon sex like this since he was with Pepper, but it’s a Saturday so he doesn’t bother worrying about the time commitment. He has JARVIS hold all his calls and lets Loki work him over with his mouth and his fingers, coaxing the dry orgasm from him that he’d promised. Tony’s too boneless to move at that point, mostly just subjected to Loki’s exploration, but he lets him do as he pleases. He isn’t as young as he was, but he’s certainly not complaining.
“Very good, Captain.”
“That’s me,” Steve agreed, “an upstart omega with no sense of his place. I haven’t got any biological family to speak of, and I grew up as poor as they come. I haven’t even got a ring.”
“Okay,” Steve says, but the tension in him doesn’t ease. Tony huffs a sigh.
He does; it was easier to throw his weight around when SI was controlling the majority of the U.S. weapon industry as well as support, i.e. tactical gear, vehicles, tech. Now they’re splitting those profits with competitors, and Tony knows better than anyone that the U.S. government is more interested in things that go “boom” than they are in Chitauri-derived body armour.
When he came back to himself Tony was shaking, eyes wide and disbelieving, and Steve hummed a question at him that made his back arch with overstimulation. He could feel Tony’s knot going down, now that he’d come again, and he waited patiently, savouring the feeling of Tony on his tongue. He didn’t like that he hadn’t really got to taste him, what with all of it going straight down his throat, but overall he was incredibly pleased with himself. He felt languorous, and probably more smug than was good.
“Being friends with Steve meant bearing witness to the kind of small, simple kindnesses that often left me breathless in their sincerity. Steve was-” Tony stumbles, then pushes through it bravely. “-an attentive, careful friend. He always had an encouraging word for someone who looked down. Especially the younger, less experienced members of the Avengers. He always knew when we weren’t taking care of ourselves, and how to help.”
“You know I don’t remember,” Logan says curtly, and Steve holds up his hands in surrender. “Probably for the best. That first costume was an eyesore, bub.”
Tony groans. “I hate when you have a point.”
Loki considers him for a moment before nodding once. A smile still sits on his lips.
“Wake him up,” she said, heading towards the elevator. “Tell him we’re on our way.”
All the breath leaves Tony’s body in a heavy rush. “Fuck.” His eyes snap open, panic building in his chest. “Fuck, I have to talk to him.”
“I’m yours,” he murmurs, and Tony blinks as a wave of something overwhelming and warm rises up, surging through him like a storm and leaving him shaking. “Tony.”
“I want to take care of you,” Steve says, and Tony rolls his eyes. “Tony-”
“Tony,” Steve says, and Tony takes a slow breath.
“There was no magical residue left on Cap’s body-”
“Probably not weeks. Look, I-… I can explain the science to you, back at the tower.”
, he tells himself.
“Look at me,” Tony demands, and Steve forces himself back. His fists are clenched hard behind Tony’s head, arms trembling where they’re looped around his neck. He’s looking at Tony almost sightlessly, so wracked with pleasure that he can barely focus his eyes. “Incredible.”
Loki narrows one eye, a scrunched expression spreading across his face that seems ill fit to his usual elegance. He’s relaxed, Tony realises, surprised. “It is better to hold something in reserve when you are at a disadvantage.”
Steve nodded. He swallowed. He turned to face Natasha and Clint. Then he picked up his shield, and jogged into the woods.
me, when you have a concussion, or when you’re hurting, or when you’ve broken something. I could tell you weren’t telling the truth, or being completely honest, or…I knew something was wrong. So I went through the medicine cabinet, while you were at work, and I found the bottle, and I looked it up-”
“Ouch,” Beth says, laughing. “Where’s your Saint Patty’s Day spirit, Cap? We’re both Irish. Tony’s the interloper.”
“Rude,” Steve says. He presses a soft kiss to Tony’s ear.
Loki grins, then shifts so Tony’s other leg is hooked over his elbow. Tony shivers with anticipation, intentionally staying relaxed as Loki presses in. He moans a little, and Loki just keeps going, all the way to the hilt. When Tony opens his eyes, Loki is staring at him with an unreadable expression, patient as he adjusts to the stretch, and when he flexes the leg slung over his shoulder to spur him on Loki smiles and begins to move. His pace is slow, maddeningly so, and Tony groans in frustration and pleasure, reaching up one hand to brace against the headboard.  Every thrust drags over his sweet spot in the position Loki’s shifted him into, and he squirms, trying to get more friction.
Steve swallows. “I’m ashamed to say I don’t know how many lives that would be, father. But I have performed many acts of charity to restore the city in the wake of the alien invasion, and I will continue to do so until she is made whole again.”
“Tony Stark!” A familiar roar echoes down the stairs, followed by the clump of several sets of feet. “I must speak with you!”
“I can feel you
There’s an awkward pause. She looks, incredibly, a little offended.
“What,” he says, faintly, and Stephen sighs.
“Well, Natasha as good as admitted she did it on purpose,” Steve says. He turns his head to glance through the glass, and Tony does the same, pressing his nose into the soft hair at the crown of Steve’s skull. He breathes in the scent of his sweat, his woodsy shampoo, of leather and wind and grass.
without the priest thinking he’s a monster.
“How can I help, sir?”
Tony frowns, and Steve cups his face in his hands and presses a kiss to his forehead. He murmurs a soft prayer against the skin there.
“Okay,” Steve says, nodding. “But just so you know, I kinda miss my best friend.”
“But,” he says, stepping out of the closet, “I think it’s simpler than that.”
“I don’t remember agreeing to that,” Steve says, and that impish twinkle in his eye will be the death of Tony someday, truly. “What’s wrong, Tony?”
Tony slid his hands over Steve’s stomach, lingering over the lines of his abs, callouses dragging over the sensitive jut of his hips. He grazed the back of his knuckles against Steve’s cock, and Steve whined, his whole body tensing with the shock of it.
Steve has seen a lot of things in his long life. Bad things, of course. Death camps. Mass graves. Personal losses, too, which were often more impactful. He knows, better than Tony probably thinks he does, how difficult it can be to just accept a win in their line of work. It can be hard to remember the good things, too: home, and shared meals, and family. Long, sweaty games of basketball. The lightness of being when he clicks together with Tony on the field, and everything moves like a well-oiled machine, and everybody lives.
If Steve loves him, he can’t possibly understand what that means for Tony. He can’t know what it would mean to lose what little of him Tony has. They laugh, and they fight, and they function best as a unit. Steve keeps him safe. Steve seeks him out when he wants solitude, as though being with Tony is the same as being alone, as if they were one being. If Steve loves him, Tony has always loved Steve Rogers.
They want you to love the whole damn world but you won’t,
"Okay," Tony says, "what the fuck? Who are you and what have you done with Steve Rogers?"
Steve’s eyes snap open. He squints carefully at Tony. “How?” he asks suspiciously, and Tony huffs a laugh.
“Ok, I’ll bite,” he says, when it’s clear Bruce isn’t going to say anything. “How can we be Pack Bonded without a Pack leader?”
Tony groans and switches lanes to pass a truck. "Pepper. Pepper-pot. Light of my life. Focus."
Steve shakes his head. “I’ll clean up.” He swallows again, blinking quickly. His scent turns sharp when he’s angry like this—almost spicy. It’s still unbearably appealing. “I’ll go-”
“Uh, yeah?” Tony says.
He knows what Loki’s doing; the slow and intense fucking imitates an intimacy that doesn’t exist yet, just as Tony’s claiming touch and desperation and desire to make Loki keen when he came was all about power and proving his prowess. Loki’s trying to make Tony trust him, and Tony’s trying to convince him that the sex is too good, to come back for more and develop something true.
“The BBG footage?”
“Still in Tampa,” Carol says, mouth twisting up with something that looks like guilt. “He and Rhodey and Spidey stayed behind to liaise with Reed and SHIELD. There’s some tech stuff they’re figuring out, still.”
He smiles tremulously at Tony, then heads towards the door.
Thanks for reading!
(See the end of the chapter for
“Thanks for the save,” he murmurs, and Bruce sighs, body slumping towards him. He’s hot, skin fevered, fatigued. Tony tightens his fingers in Bruce’s blanket.
"I don't have a hover board either," Steve teases, but he settles back into the seat and watches Tony fiddle with the controls, content to subject himself to his friend's whims.
"Well played," Tony mutters, smirking as one moment Natasha is standing in front of a SHIELD agent with a terrified trigger finger, between a furious Hulk and a wall of men who should be evacuating Madison Square Park, and then there's nothing but green and gold light. The bullet lodges itself harmlessly in a tree, and then Natasha is behind him. The agent is out cold. She takes the gun apart and drops the pieces on the floor in front of the rest of his unit, who quickly find themselves somewhere else to be.
“Tatatatata,” Dani tells him, and Tony grins at her. The brightness of it changes his whole face.
Tony blinks at him, then at Rogers. He takes in the new lab, Bruce’s greying temples, Rogers’ close physical proximity to him.
“Riri Williams,” Bruce said, bringing her face up on the screen. She was young, only fifteen,
Steve nods, and stays quiet. He can sense that Jim is working up to a shovel talk, and he has the strange thought that maybe this is how other people feel when they talk to him. It makes an inappropriate burst of laughter nearly creep out from inside, but he stifles it down sternly. No one’s ever given Steve a shovel talk before. He doesn’t think it’s ever been warranted, but this one is. As always, Tony is special.
Steve’s jumped off of a lot of tall things, and not even always with someone to catch him. Usually Tony is the one who rushes to meet him mid-air, muttering about Steve’s bull-headed recklessness. He’d thought he was used to it, that nothing could phase him. But it’s strange, falling without the wind whipping against him. He feels weightless, almost. Below him, the city is spread out in a dot matrix of glowing lights. Little cars shuttle back and forth like fireflies, quickly growing larger. The street is nearly upon him.
“You did?” Tony asks. He wipes the sweat from his brow with the back of one hand, then fixes Steve with a sceptical expression. “When?”
Chase Stein. Dumb jock kid of shitty abusive inventor supervillains. Right.
“Alright, Tony,” Rogers said, and Tony couldn’t help but stare at his throat as it worked. He’d never seen Rogers so biddable.
Afterwards, Steve lay on his back in bed on top of his coverlet. The duvet was cool against his skin. The cream ceiling was perfectly painted, entirely inoffensive. There were no cracks to speak of, nothing to count, just him, and his bed, and his sins. He didn’t know how long he lay there. Hours, maybe. Long enough for the sun to shift in the window, the light changing until it slanted over the bed, hitting his neck, his jaw. The warmth of the sun reminded him of the way Tony’s touch lit him up, made him feel like he was something beautiful, something worth cherishing. No one had ever made him feel like that. Not even Peggy. She had been strong, and beautiful, and made him want to be a hero so he could be worthy of her. Tony’s touch made him feel like he was already worthy: worthy of decadence, of worship, of only the deepest joy. It was the best thing Steve had ever felt in his life. Tony was the best thing he’d ever had in his life.
“I wanted to see your face,” Tony said, stroking a gentle thumb over his cheekbone, and Steve could feel himself flush with pleasure.
“Hell yes,” Tony says. “J, remind me. This is witchcraft.”
“She’s an alpha.”
Tony knows he’s here. He knows. He has to know. He has to-
“Sorry,” Tony says, feeling suddenly shy.
“I hate spoilers,” Tony protests, an old argument, and Steve hooks his arm around Tony’s neck and drags him in close, digging his knuckles into Tony’s scalp. “Hey! Ow!”
,” Steve says, although it seems neither he nor Tony know what he means by it.
, he thinks, curiously. It’s a distant thought, one that gathers shape and form as he studies his own lifeless face. He leans over it, frowning. What’s wrong?
Steve laughs. “Okay.”
“That’ll be all, Ms. Potts,” Tony says through his teeth.
“How do you think of him?”
, he doesn’t say. He feels wrong-footed.
“Sometimes, I think, Tony really needs his own space,” Steve says, looking down at his hands. “He’s a…complicated man. He gets lonely, but I think he also gets overwhelmed by people. He needs time to decompress and work on his own. He’s not used to having people in his space all the time like this, the way me and Bruce have been. So I think maybe Tony just needs some time to himself for a bit. That might be the only way he can heal his inside hurts. Do you understand what I mean?”
“What’ve you got for me, baby?” he asks JARVIS.
The kiss that cuts him off is biting and laced with a throaty groan, Steve’s fingers gripping his thigh so hard it’s going to leave a perfect five-point bruise dotted into the skin. Tony’s fingers scrabble at Steve’s shirt, and then his own t-shirt is being pulled up and over his head, coming to wrap around his wrists over the plastic. Steve’s gaze on his body is ravenous, calloused fingers dragging slow over Tony’s stomach, tracing around the top of his waistband and over the sensitive jut of Tony’s hipbone. The shock of pleasure is enough to make Tony’s head knock back into the wall, and Steve immediately moves to Tony’s neck, biting along his jaw. He unbuttons Tony’s jeans one-handed and pulls them down, over the curve of his ass until they can’t go any farther.
Steve groans, and Tony tips him up so that the camera can see the fast-fading bruises marching all across his chest through the reflection in mirror. He reaches around and pinches one, revelling in the dazed, desperate look that Steve’s wearing. God, but he’s beautiful.

“Hush,” Rogers said, but he was laughing now as he pulled Tony out into the cold street. The shock of it was enough to sober him up a little, and he blinked bemusedly out into the darkness.
“A second, if you don’t mind,” he says as the window rolls up. He keeps his eyes fixed on the black wall between them and the front of the car, then taps his hand on the door armrest once, twice. “Is there something you wanna tell me?”
“I know,” he says, simple, and Steve swallows. “When you’re a little more stable, okay? I’m not going anywhere.”
The truth is, Tony usually hates Saint Patrick’s Day in New York.
enhanced, aren’t you?”
Steve studies him for a long moment. Three breaths. Four. A small, shy smile breaks over his face. "I think you like me better this way,” he says, slowly, like he’s testing the words out in his mouth.
alphas who can’t control themselves more than anything else. He’d made that abundantly clear. And Steve had just…made a complete and total fool of himself in front of Tony. God, he’s always been
“I couldn’t say, sir,” JARVIS tells him, but that’s alright, he thinks. It doesn’t seem so bad, settling down. He might even enjoy it.
Steve sucks in a shaky breath, rubbing a hand over his closed eyes.
JARVIS’ silence is smug if he ever heard one.
“Alpha,” Steve whimpered, and then he was coming: a slow, rolling, achingly sweet and good kind of climax that took him in waves. He could feel Tony shaking against him as his body tightened, moaning sweetness in his ear, thrusting until he could feel his alpha coming inside him again, filling him up, and oh that was so good too.
Steve moans softly into the kiss, his free hand sliding down over Tony’s stomach to take hold of his cock. He breaks the kiss with a soft bite, mouthing along Tony’s jaw until he’s settled back behind him, mouth slipping sweetly over the shell of his ear.
“This can’t be happening,” Tony tells Bruce for what feels like the fortieth time.
“Natasha thinks it’s nice that we love each other very much,” Steve said, trying to break the tension, and Tony let out a shaky laugh. “We’re just so domestic, and it makes the tower feel homey. Isn’t that sweet?”
“Just like we talked about; heavy hitters on frontal assault to draw them out, I slip in and pull Cap out while the wonder twins do their wetwork. Quick and dirty, lady and gentlemen. You know how I like it.”
you speak ancient Greek and know everything there is to know about octo- uh. Octo
“Good morning, Bruce,” Steve tries, valiantly unflinching in the face of Bruce’s emanating disapproval. He looks pointedly at Tony’s face, then back at Steve.
“Damnit,” he breathed, closing his eyes for a moment. “Unlock: Captain Handsome.”
“I didn’t want to shoot her, but I was farther up,” Clint says, looking disgruntled. “And I don’t think she knew I was there.”
The professor smiles, gestures to the window; to the children outside, happy and safe, to his fellow teachers, to the sanctuary he’s created. “What do you think, Captain?”
“Good,” Tony says, opening his hands. He holds out an earbud, which Steve picks out of his fingers warily. He pushes it into his ear with a furrowed brow. “If I get back in the suit it’s gonna make this worse, isn’t it?”
“Let’s move this to the bedroom,” he says, and Steve’s eyes light up in his face. “You mentioned something about dessert?”
“Sorry,” he says. A touch of pink spills over his pale cheeks, and an answering delight bubbles up inside Tony at the sight of it. He’s unfairly adorable. “I…I’ll get used to it. I promise.”
Tony hadn’t wanted to bond, but Steve had. Steve had wanted this. He’d been so selfish.
Afterwards, Steve will go back over every single moment between him and Tony—especially the weeks of quiet stalking before they met that Tony doesn’t know about and Steve hopes he never will—and think,
“That’s not really the same,” Steve says, a wry smile breaking over his face, and Tony laughs.
Thor tilted his head, considering. “Is it not necessary for me to go to Tony? He is the alpha. He may be able to overpower any of the rest of the team with presence alone, if he is distressed or angry enough. Midgardians are fierce when their mates are threatened. We have long known this in Asgard. The brutality that can be birthed from the primal need to protect is where the tales of berserkers originate.”
“Two minutes out,” Bruce said, sounding pretty frustrated himself. “SHIELD has put up a perimeter. They’re doing a sweep now.”
Pepper tilts her head to the side, one brow furrowing as she looks at him. “No, I don’t expect I’ll have much trouble from him,” she says, confusingly. Then she nods. “Go on, then.”
“I don’t deserve you,” Tony mutters. He can’t stop himself from saying it. The look Steve spares him as he climbs out of the tub, dripping wet, miles of pale skin like a Grecian statue-
“What if I want to tell you?” Tony challenged, letting his chair fall so that he could stand. He padded to the glass, arms folded across his chest, but Steve only smiled up at him. He resolutely did not trace the exposed cords of Tony’s arms with his eyes, the way his shirt pulled taut over his shoulders. God, he couldn’t wait for tomorrow.
The cold was biting, even as Tony spurred his horse faster through the building storm. He imagined the wind as a baying pack of black-eyed wolves, sharp teeth biting at his ankles as he thundered through sheaves of blinding white, streaks of snow clouding his vision and making it hard to make out anything of the road ahead.
Tony clutches his fingers in the fabric of the pillow, taking comfort in it even as his heart races with panic.
What Tony wishes he’d replied with is:
“I’m sorry, Captain, I’m not at liberty to say,” JARVIS says. He sounds cold, and Steve frowns.
“I want to,” Steve breathed, desperate for Tony’s mouth. His breath was skating over Steve’s wet nipple, the rush of hot breath and cold air in alternation serving the sweetest torture. “Please, I want to. I want it.”
B O D Y
“I do not think that Captain Rogers finds you ‘weird’ or ‘creepy’, sir.”
“Yes,” Tony drawled, and his eyes were dark enough that Steve could drown in them. “Make sure you’re well rested, well-fed.”
“Can I tell you a secret?” Tony whispers loudly. He glances around to great effect, and Franklin blinks wide eyes at him. He nods, and Steve’s heart melts a little when Tony crouches down to reach him. He leans in to whisper in Franklin’s ear. “You already are a real superhero. Because you’re helping us save Captain America.”
“Your so-called ‘Spidey Senses’ are an imperfect tool. They do not tell you what you are sensing, just that you are sensing
Steve wrenches his mouth away with a wet sound that curls hot and writhing in the pit of Tony’s belly. His eyes are huge in his face.
Tony isn’t looking at him. He’s standing over Steve’s body silently, his arms folded across his chest. He looks tired, but that’s nothing new. Steve would almost call his expression impassive, if he didn’t know Tony as well as he did. Instead, he watches the minute tremble of Tony’s jaw, the way his hands are shaking. Tony wants a drink, and he wants it badly.
“Miss Potts was able to find a sex worker for the last day of your heat because you were so miserable.” The implications of Tony’s current condition are left unsaid. “She bribed the hotel staff.”
Peter rolls his eyes. Then he unfolds himself with all the ease expected of Spiderman, and holds out a hand to Tony.
(See the end of the chapter for
"He played us like a harp," Bruce says. He offers Tony a wan smile, all teeth. "Again."
"If it came through the United States Postal Service, sure, it would be. But seeing as it was magically placed on my bedside table, I'm not overly worried." He pauses, uncharacteristically reticent. "SHIELD has been scanning me and running tests all morning. I'm perfectly healthy, and have somehow regrown my tonsils."
“This isn’t a war,” Tony says, but it’s a weak protest.
“Thor’s my people!” Tony shouts, when it seems like Loki might tear his brother’s throat out, and Loki jerks as though yanked on a leash. His body twists strangely to the side, and then there’s no longer a man standing there. In its place is an enormous brown canid, something between a jackal and a wolf, lithe and dangerous.
Tony watches him work, his hands mixing and adding and mixing again. There’s a tightness there that Tony knows well, and he glances at the nearest security camera meaningfully before moving to rummage in the cutlery drawer for a butter knife.
, he tells himself, and when nothing further happens, he lets out a soft huff of relief.
“You’re insatiable,” he said, and Steve tilted his face up to beam happily at him. “Eat some more gelato, you minx.”
“Oh, is that what you were doing?” Tony asks, crooking a finger at him. Steve swings a leg over the rail with a bright grin, then the other, ambling forward with his hands in his pockets. “You know, if you cause any mischief, we’re out in public. Anybody could see you.”
Sam smiles softly at him. He nudges him with an elbow. “What do you wanna do, now that you’ve got your body back?”
, alpha,” he exhaled, and then he did as he was told.
Steve had done a lot of reading, but he hadn’t been able to figure out if Tony’s birth nature was omega or beta. It didn’t matter, not really, but he couldn’t help but be a little curious. There had never been a confirmed record of an omega-omega bond in all of history. There were rumours, of course, and some who felt that such things had been supressed by a sexist society. If Tony’s birth nature was omega, then he might have no hope of ever bonding to Steve. And if he bit Steve and it didn’t take, then what? What was he planning to say? Was he planning to come out if he was forced into it?
“Fuck! Cap! Cap, come on! We’re almost out of here!”
Tony takes a photo with the sound on. The artificial shutter sound makes Steve shudder. He pulls out, until just the very tip of him is breaching Steve’s body, then takes another photo.
“I’m sorry I didn’t notice, before,” Steve says, and Tony huffs a laugh.
Tony gives it to him. He pushes and doesn’t stop, just keeps going, trusting the slickness of his skin and Steve’s unbelievable body. He keeps going until the widest part of the ligula slips into Steve with a squelch that he can feel, and Steve lets out a broken whine and presses his face hard into Tony’s chest. He pants openmouthed against the skin, his whole body shaking.
“You don’t trust him?” Tony asks, and Natasha tilts her head to the side.
“Mine,” he said, reaching out, and Tony leaned down to meet him, pressing soft, adoring kisses all over Steve’s jaw, his neck, against his panting mouth. “Alpha.”
“He’s a fellow superhero, I take it,” the professor laughs, and Steve grins at him.
“You’re bait,” she says, in that flat, toneless way of hers. Wilson looks at her, eyebrows furrowed. “I need an opening to take down Hasegawa and Barnes. Your metal wings will be a shiny target for The Melter, but you’ll have to be annoying enough to keep his attention off of Tony.”
“Well,” he says, “better to know, I guess.”
Steve leans in, taking Tony’s mouth in a slow, drugging kiss. It’s enough to make Tony moan quietly into his mouth, and when he pulls back, Steve looks like he’s ready for a second round.
“Gorgeous,” Tony tells him, and Steve cracks a smile. “You’re incredible, all trussed up for me like this.”
“What if what I want’s not something you want?” Tony asks him.
“It’s Asgardian mead,” Natasha says. Steve eyes the barrel with newfound respect, noting the ornate tooling in the bilge hoop. “That one’s all for you, wonderboy.” She holds up a bottle of Tovaritch! in her other hand in demonstration, while Clint hefts a jug of Yamazaki. Steve wonders what Tony is apologising for this time.
“Let’s get you into the tub.”
Steve set his jaw, looking away. “Pepper kicked me out.”
“Think I can’t do it? Put your money where your mouth is, Shellhead.”
Tony smiles. He can’t help it. “A true gentleman,” he teases, but it’s the wrong thing to say. Steve’s shoulders lock, his whole body curling in on itself.
“But you’re ok.”
Tony shrugs, difficult to do with a super dense god draped over him. Something in him doesn’t want to shake him off, likely the part of him that shook at the sight of Loki’s blood splattered all over Amora in the wake of the explosion, his guts and burnt clothing lying in a soupy mess at the bottom of a charred pit.
“GTA?”
“Your definition of necessary has shrunk.”
“Respectfully, sir, that’s bull.”
“No,” Thor says, simply. “You are our friend, and it is the task of friends to care for one another as best they are able.”
“Well, you do a poor job of looking out for yourself,” Stephen says, and Tony laughs sheepishly. “I am sure that everything will be fine with Steve.”
“It’s been a while,” Tony protests laughingly. “Sue me.”
“NIA couldn’t hold them,” Rhodey says bluntly, and Tony lets out a soft curse. “Tony, we knew that, come on. This was what was always gonna happen.”
“Stop. Just, stop that,” he said, putting the bowls on the chair. He leaned down, shifting Rogers up on the pillows and sitting on the bed, one knee tucked up between them. He pulled one bowl to him, dipping the spoon in and feeding Rogers the first bite.
Tony gets in and takes a deep breath, letting it all out at once. “J?”
Loki’s mouth twists. “The colonel must remain unprotected. She has fought him, after my supposed demise. And she will be suspicious if your newest compatriot is also sporting protection, when she knows he does not work with you regularly. And I certainly cannot protect Thor.” He frowns, looking at his folded arms. “She will be suspicious regardless.”
“You asking?”
Steve turns to look at him, startled, but he’s already pulling away. He waves a metal hand over his shoulder and goes over to pour himself some coffee. Then Sam touches him to get his attention, and Danni wants to play peek-a-boo, and the moment to ask passes him by.
“Yeah, and now it’s spiralled out of control.”
“I know the rest of the tower is safe,” Steve said, face smashed against Tony’s stomach as they lay on the couch. “I know that. I know.”
Steve’s gone.
JARVIS helpfully pulls up the camera from the workshop door, where sure enough, Steve is standing and looking more than a little forlorn. He tries his code, then sighs, stooping down to leave one plate of what looks like lemon chicken and cauliflower rice by the door. God, did Steve
“Because it was untested. He said to tell you biochem and radiation are his arena, and you’re an idiot for not asking for help earlier.” Hawkeye is grinning, and Tony turns to look at him. “Are you-”
Beth shoves Tony under the spray, not waiting for the water to get warm. Tony yelps, but he doesn’t shout at her or even really protest. Instead he just stands there morosely under the spray. Beth fetches up against the sink counter, her arms folded across her chest, and watches Tony through the frosted glass of the shower. Her expression is resolutely pitiless.
“Are you going to fuck me?” he asks, and Tony near about swallows his tongue. “Or let me taste you, like I wanted? I’ll be good for you.” His eyes dip half-closed, lashes a golden sweep over his flushed cheekbones. “I was good to you last time, wasn’t I?”
he thinks viciously, then stops in case Loki can hear him. Loki just drags himself up with a grin, wiping the blood from his mouth. Tough bastard.
“I’m not sure I understand,” Loki tries again. “If you both-”
A soft hiss alerted him to the arrival of the armour, and he turned to see Tony standing in that damned flight suit of his. A wave of arousal washed over him at the sight of his alpha standing there in skin-tight black, but it was a passing desire. Tony winked at him, then took off at a run, vaulting the railing before Steve could even shout at him to be careful, to not be such a reckless posturing alpha. Steve screamed, more instinct than fear, but overlaid was the sound of Tony’s whooping laughter, the whine of the repulsors as the armour chased him as he fell.
and loving Steve. Tony drunk in a fucking gutter while Steve walked away because he couldn’t bear the thought of his own weaknesses, and still, still, loving Steve. Tony descending a staircase like a prince in a fairytale, smiling at him days before Christmas and calling him Beloved. Tony mostly naked except for the swath of red cloth that hangs from his hips, revealing himself as Iron-Man, an image that has haunted Steve for years-
Amora looks at him speculatively for a moment, her eyes flashing with gold light. “No, I don’t believe we do,” she says sweetly, and Tony swallows as something in Cap shifts towards her, body going loose and pliant.
“Of course,” Steve echoed. “What about Thor?”
“We have,” Shuri admits, and Tony grins. “But for now, come and let me scan you again. We’re going to go over the igniting incident and see if anything interesting happens.”
A loud cough interrupts them, and Steve pulls away, both of them turning. The sight that greets them nearly brings Tony to tears.
interested,” Tony muses, and Steve squeezes his eyes shut. “I’ve been swimming on my private beach. What’s your excuse, hmm? Wet hair…my, my, Captain, were you
He stares at Steve’s body for a long time, motionless, expressionless. Then he moves over to the little bank of computers on the side, and begins fiddling with the controls there. He messes around with the computer for about half an hour, during which Steve grumbles at him for wasting time, sings him an old trench song, and tries to touch Tony again. He isn’t expecting it to do anything. It doesn’t seem like it does.
“Very good, captain.”
“I said the consent was getting a little grey!” Tony exclaims, standing. He takes a few steps forward, pacing back and forth like a caged animal. “I don’t mean- God, why is everyone so sure I’m some sort of SVU heroine, Jesus Christ.”
“That sounds ominous,” Natasha murmured, folding her arms over her chest.
“Beth, please tell me this is actually a beneficial loss-leader,” Tony yells across the room, but he’s mostly kidding.
“So, I pissed him off,” Tony says, sipping his coffee and watching Bruce. He raises his eyebrows as Bruce reaches behind him and offers Tony a plate of buttered toast.
The line clicks off, but it's too late. Steve is already laughing too hard to breathe, loud barks of it echoing down the empty urban canyons and over the park's green canopy across the street. He takes a moment to plant his feet, hands on his hips as he arches back and laughs, and laughs, and laughs.
“Are we playing good cop, bad cop?” Steve deadpans, and Tony snorts.
“Be gentle with him.”
“Why, what do I smell like? Is it bad?” he asked, shrinking in on himself, and Steve jumped up before he thought better of it. He crowded close into Tony’s space, putting a hand on his shoulder and swiping his own sweaty hair out of his eyes. He needed to get a haircut, soon.
“Access Granted: Steven Grant Rogers, Codename Captain America.”
“What are you
Tony moans helplessly into the back of Steve’s neck, then buries his head there to hide himself from the sight.
“If you’re okay with it.”
“Chase,” Minoru says warningly.
“My apologies, we have never been properly introduced,” Loki says, walking up to Pepper and manoeuvring deftly around Tony in a way that speaks to a thousand years of court dances and intricate battle training. He holds out a hand and does this little courtly bow, and Pepper raises an eyebrow at Tony but takes his hand, letting him kiss her knuckles. “I am Loki, once a crown prince of Asgard.” He pauses, considering. “Now, something else, I think. And you are the fair Ms. Potts, guardian of the Stark empire, whom I have heard so much about. What shall I call you?”
"Stark has generously offered up his own home to house the team. He's got the best head for strategy after me." He turned, sparing an apologetic glance for Romanov. "You are excellent at what you do, and that is not full frontal warfare. We're not looking to form a black ops team. We want to be above reproach.”
JARVIS’ silence felt judgemental, but maybe he was just projecting. Steve didn’t have the emotional energy to feel much more than a twinge of guilt for being so tetchy. DUM-E helped him over to the couch, and Steve fell more than sat down on it. The couch, at least, smelled equally of him and Tony. He spent enough time down here that he was kind of surprised there wasn’t a dip in the couch. He knew for certain that if anyone took a blacklight to it, they’d probably have to throw the old thing out on principle. Tony had fucked him over it so many times it probably qualified as a biohazard.
“I know what you’ve been through,” Steve says, and Tony’s mouth snaps shut. “Just because you don’t think it’s a big deal, Tony-”
“Steve?” Natasha ventured, and Steve realised he’d been staring at Tony with a lovesick expression for far too long. Tony looked amused, but mostly worried.
“Yeah,” Tony manages, and Steve grins at him. “Fuck. You’re too much.”
“She’s got a mouth on her.” Steve approved. “Is she…?”
“Hey, we did it!”
“Stark-”
Steve is surprised to hear this question from Peter. From some of the newer, less familiar heroes, sure. But Peter knows it’s not like that-
said. I’m such a fucking idiot.”
“You like it?” he asks.
“Sounds like a cop-out,” Steve deadpans.
He gets his answer pretty quickly. Tony strips off his shirt, normal enough for him when he’s sleeping. But then he steps out of his boxers, entirely naked. He leans over, the dimples above his rear perfect to Steve’s stunned eyes, and rummages in the bedside table. He pulls out a bottle-
Steve, embarrassingly, was so relieved at the comfort of touching another living human being that he’d even let Franklin crawl onto his shoulders at one point. “Does it look like I’m floating?” he’d asked Tony.
“I shall close the portal after the last of your machines passes through,” Loki says, and wow, what a trip to hear his voice on the comms and not via magic. “I will not speak to you while you are engaged with Amora, but I shall hear what JARVIS relays.”
The door closes behind him with a snick, and Tony takes a deep breath.
“If I may, sir, the captain asked that you not to make him wait too long. As that is the first open slot in your schedule for a date-”
“Salt. Seafood. Sex.”
“I will,” Steve said, and pushed himself to standing. He brushed the dirt off of his knees. “Thanks, everyone. For everything. This week, and the last. I’ve been a mess, and you’ve all been great.”
“I get tired just listening to you talk about everything you’ve been handling,” Steve murmurs. He presses a soft kiss to Tony’s throat. “I’m sorry, about earlier. I know you’ve had a lot going on.”
“I think Steve’s smart enough to figure it out.”
“Gooey?” Steve asks, a shy smile slowly breaking across his full mouth.
a human scientist,” Loki says disapprovingly, and Tony winks at him.
Rhodey shrugs at him. “He’s helping us now, and we’ll shoot him later if we have to.”
Steve just moaned in response, the sound garbled in his throat. He couldn’t breathe, and his head was spinning with it, and it was so, so good.
“Nausea?” Bruce asks, eyeing Tony critically.
Tony thinks about caution, throws it to the wind. He twists his head to be free of Loki’s fingers. “Thinking about you fucking me when you’re iced over,” he says, grinning at the shock flashing across Loki’s face. “I bet it would feel incredible.”
“Oh, god,” Tony gasps, and his wrists are still caught. He’s pinned, helpless and desperate as Steve’s hands slide over his stomach, his back, the swell of his ass. “Gonna strip me right here, where anyone can walk in-”
He stood silent, straining to hear over the rush of the wind. A low moan was the sweet answer he’d been desperate for, and Tony dropped to his hands and knees to see the barest hint of a familiar boot under the snowy scrub before him.
“Not enough time,” he said, which was an obvious lie. “He’s on a mission right now.”
Rogers shuffled slowly up the bed, face a rictus of pain, and Tony cursed low under his breath.
“I like my pies a little past the brim. Make a mound,” Clint says, and Tony shrugs. He can get behind that. “Look, forget about the team or what Steve might feel or not feel or whatever the hell else anyone is telling you. What do you, Tony Stark, want? Really want? That’s the question you gotta answer, man.”
“Nothing!” Tony says. “I’ve gotta go.”
“Scout’s honour!” Tony calls, already drawing up schematics and consulting with Grace about some minor software concerns. “What if we can get the lights to blink in tandem with speakers?”
“Well, now you have Loki to do that bit for you,” Pepper says, smiling a little, and Tony groans and rubs at his brows with one hand. He offers Pepper a napkin. “Is Natasha coming?”
“I don’t need to tell anyone that the world is poorer without my friend in it. I suppose I don’t need to say that it was richer for his presence, either. He made each and every one of us better, myself more than anyone. So what I wish—selfishly and more than anything—is for that light not to go out. I know that’s what Steve would say, if he were here with us. He would want us to believe in ourselves, in the light within each sapient creature in the multiverse. He would want us to keep taking care of each other. He would want us to become the best versions of ourselves.
Jim laughs at that. He tips his head back, teeth gleaming in the light. It’s a true belly laugh, deep and good, and Steve basks in it. He’s always liked Jim, even if they aren’t close by any measure.
“Maybe,” he admits. “Or maybe something else is going on. But we won’t know until we talk to her.”
Loki smiles, then very purposefully presses his lips to the tip of Tony’s cock, slowly dragging his mouth over the head until he’s sucking it, his tongue flat and hot against the skin. Tony lets out a long moan, unabashed, and curls one foot against Loki’s ribs, pressing to get some skin contact between them. Loki looks smug as Tony’s ever seen him as he works, talented tongue and more years of experience than Tony’s been alive leaving him panting, rocking his hips up to get a bit of friction. He lets loose a broken noise when Loki lets his mouth go slack, encourages Tony to fuck into him a few times before swallowing him down to the root.
. Really.”
“That’s good,” the professor says, smiling. “If that changes, please let me know. It was good that Stark had already provided you with so many of his coping mechanisms throughout your time working and living together. Good housekeeping and routine is a big part of recovery for someone like you.”
“It won’t be long, now,” he tells him. He brushes the hair off of Tony’s forehead. He cups his cheek when he turns his face into Steve’s hand.
“What is wrong with Natasha’s mind?” Thor asks, and both Steve and Tony wince.
“I never should have shown you that movie,” Tony laments, starting towards the elevator again.
“Sure, but did you tell him to look for Steve’s ghost?” Peter asks.
“And he undid the spell,” Natasha allows, looking wary. “I expect you figured out his big plan?”
Steve swallows. He looks down at his hands, folded in his lap. “I’d like to think so.”
“You want to rummage around, check for any mines Amora might have left behind,” Steve says tightly, nodding. “Have at it.”
The snap is the most painful he’s ever experienced. He feels like his body’s been wrenched apart into individual molecules and pulled back together again. He’s in so much pain he doesn’t know which way is up, but he reaches out a blind, desperate hand and feels around, praying for something solid. Skin. Warm skin.
Tony’s mouth snapped shut as sure as if Steve had reached out and hit it closed. He looked equal parts horrified and bewildered. “What?” he croaked.
Bruce raises his eyebrow meaningfully towards the entrance to the lab, and Tony turns just in time to catch the sight of a very familiar bright red boot disappearing up the stairs.
On the screen, Maria folds her arms across her chest. She’s somewhere in the field, because the wall behind her is brick, nothing like the gleaming steel and glass of SHIELD. There’s a small cut below her right eye. She looks tired, but also cautiously optimistic. “Because he stood by you.”
“I take it I am not welcome for this discussion,” he says, eyes sliding between the two of them as they settle together on the couch.
Tony wonders if holding your head up high ever gets tiring.
The smoke coils around the room, slowly, filling it up. When it hits Tony he expects something to happen, but nothing does. Tentatively, he pushes his hands into it, but it moves right through him. It’s like he’s not even there.
Loki blinks at that, then nods his assent.
The sentence, in Tony’s voice, rises to the forefront of his mind like a body rising from the river. He doesn’t know where it came from. All he feels is Tony’s grief, total and all-encompassing, wiping over his mind. For a moment, they are one being, head held in their shared hands, alone, mired in grief.
“Yeah,” Tony said, and then he was fucking him, slow and deep, hard enough that Steve imagined he could feel every thrust in the back of his throat. “I’ve got you, sweetheart. I have you, come on.”
“Sure, and I’ll tell her I’m mad at Cap and avoiding the team. Easy.”
Clint shakes the knife at him, and Tony raises his hands in placation. He goes back to laying slices of apple down.
“You’re trying so hard not to smack talk right now,” Tony says, grinning a little.
“If that is your desire, Sir.” JARVIS opens the shades again, the pinkening sky the only hint of light on the horizon.
“Tony,” he whispers, biting along his jaw, curling his tongue into Tony’s ear. “Tony.”
Steve raises his hands in surrender. "Okay, okay," he says. He sucks in a breath, the kind that pulls his shirt tight over his chest. "I, uh. I had a question."
“I can promise you,” Senator Collins says, suddenly, “if you went up to Doctor Charles Xavier’s haven and spoke to those children, they would tell you; their neighbours always know exactly what they are.” She stares at Cochran until he looks away, and Tony marks a point in her column. She very pointedly closes the StarkPad without looking at it and hands it back to him. “Forcing innocent Americans to register their biological status is absurd and against all American values. History has already proven this. But we can certainly talk sanctions. The Avengers cannot continue to operate without oversight.”
“You thought I would be rough and demanding?” Loki asks, hitching Tony’s right leg around his hips and sliding a hand up his skin. He touches the injured side of Tony’s mouth, eyes glinting. “Did you take me for someone coarse?”
“We had a fight.”
“Rogers!” Tony called, but there was no answer; just the snow, and the skirling wind, and the endless crunch of hooves as Tony raced down the path.
“Tony?”
“Yeah…” Tony prevaricates, shrugging. “I don’t know about that. But that’s my problem, not yours.” He offers Stephen a wobbly grin. “Thanks for the help.”
By the time Tony’s bundled into the car with Happy—after, of course, leaving a hefty tip for both Taesha and the overly-polite porter who’d taken him downstairs—he’s about ready to take a horse pill. His head feels like it’s going to burst.
Bruce snarls, a little more Hulk than Bruce, but he lets Tony touch him, one hand on either side of his head. He breathes in slow, holds it, breathes out again. He waits for Bruce to calm himself. He waits for his own pulse to slow.
He rubs a hand over his face, letting out a harsh breath. “Hey, J?”
“No,” Tony says, shuddering. “The last time you and Clint ganged up on Thor, we had to open every window in the tower and a hazmat unit was deployed to his suite.”
Tony closes his eyes, then takes his clothes off slowly, the way a lover might. He lets Steve run his hands over his shoulders, down his chest. They move slowly this time. It’s tentative. Later, nestled once again between Tony’s legs, rutting lazily against each other, Steve learns that he can, in fact, reach orgasm if he works at it enough. Tony proves more than willing to put the time in, and he buries the shaking moan that bursts out of him in his lover’s mouth. He wishes he could feel Tony’s breath on his face.

to Steve: so, sleepover and you take me to court tomorrow?
Steve realises, with a kind of distant mortification, that he’s about to be visibly hard in his sweatpants.
Maria smiles thinly at him. “That’s why we get on.”
A startled laugh flies from Steve’s mouth, too loud. It bursts out into the larger chamber of the church, echoing strangely when the sound has already fallen flat within the tiny wooden box they share. Steve flushes, embarrassed.
Tony hitches a breath, then laughs at himself. He pours two fingers of Teeling, slides in a sphere of ice. “Trouble,” he complains, a now-familiar refrain.
“I would!” someone shouted, to a series of loud cheers and jeers. Tony startled, as though he’d forgotten their audience, before a wry smile slipped over his face.
Tony wishes he’d never gotten out of bed on Monday. “Tell her Thor is in Asgard,” he says snapping on his homing bracelets. He stumbles into his room to pull on a pair of boxers, then out into the hall. “Deploy.”
Tony didn’t respond for a long time, but he didn’t tense up, either. Instead he carded his fingers through Steve’s hair, long strokes that sent waves of indolence slipping over Steve’s spine. His breath was steady, and Steve waited, knowing that Tony was gearing up to saying something important. He was weighing the words in his mouth, testing their value, their rightness. Steve was patient. He had always been more patient than Tony. He could wait while Tony gathered his thoughts.
Loki is watching him, his mouth twisting into something wry and melancholy as he studies Tony’s face. He reaches out, takes Tony’s glass from his fingers. He takes a long sip. “I know you don’t trust me yet,” he says. There it is again, that use of the word yet. “I swore I harboured no ill will towards you and your compatriots. And I thought...”
“Tony,” Pepper says, very seriously now, “do you know what you’re doing?”
“So we’ve got nothing.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Before the serum, Steve wasn’t able to see red. It’s not something a lot of people know, or maybe they do and they aren’t aware of how much seeing the world differently changes you. He’d been an art student who was known for his black and white work, and he knew that most people thought it was a sign of the times. It had been ration time. Paint was expensive, and when it came to the war posters he’d been commissioned for, black and white was easier for mass production. But the truth was, Steve had been colourblind before the serum. Nothing could erase from his mind that moment of stepping out of the capsule and seeing Peggy’s face in full colour, bright lipstick painted over her lips a revelation, and then; blood. He’d never seen blood in colour before. He hadn’t known that the army wore a terrible shade of green.
Steve is tired of Pepper flaying him open and walking out, but he supposes she did learn from the best. He has no idea what to do with what she has given him this time, though. He has no idea how to even begin processing the things she’d said. Before now, Pepper had been someone he respected, a friend he would have trusted with his life and the lives of those he loved. He can’t quite reconcile that woman with one who would say, blatant and unashamed, that she doesn’t care about the greater good.
Steve shakes the thought off. He and Tony need to talk and figure out their Bond before he thinks about taking a job that will force him to leave home for extended periods of time.
“You don’t have to do that,” he said. “I know I’m the worst cook, extremely pitiable-”
“Professor Xavier. It’s an honour to meet you.”
“I can’t believe you’re still calling them that.”
“The likelihood of getting the NIA to relinquish custody once they had already taken the Captain’s assailants in was nil. Our window of opportunity was before they took the assailants in to start with, and the odds are against you having affected that outcome positively, sir.”
“Were you talking to someone, sir?” JARVIS asks. “I saw nothing.”
Tony stills, suddenly, and Steve turns in time to catch the lowering of his eyelashes. He near swallows his tongue when Tony opens his mouth under Steve’s hand, tongue slipping out to lick along the line between his middle and ring fingers in a slow, filthy sweep. Steve can feel his stomach tighten, the muscles in his body coiling as he meets Tony’s half-lidded gaze, his eyes dark and sparkling with mischief.
“Accepted,” JARVIS said, and then the elevator began to move, and Steve wondered how the hell he was even going to face this conversation.
P L E A S E
“True,” Loki hums, tipping his head to the side. He vanishes anyway, and Tony lets out a sigh.
“Good,” Pepper says, sounding vicious, and Tony bares his teeth at the empty room. “Italian, from that little place you like near Central Park West, and some cannoli’s.”
“We could put an SI float in the Saint Patrick’s Day Parade,” Pepper says, and Tony lets out a rough laugh. “I could put you in charge of something fun and creative and crazy. You like that.”
Tony knows he’s gaping like a fish, but he can’t manage to do anything else. He has no idea what to say.
Tony feels as if his heart would climb out of his throat if he let it. He pulls back to stare into Loki’s face, not sure what he expects to see there, but when he checks, Loki’s mask is firmly in place. The only thing that betrays him is the slightest twitch of his irises, as though he wishes to break eye contact but can’t quite manage it. Tony moves his other hand to cradle the other side of Loki’s face, so his head is pressed between Tony’s hands. He can feel coolness slipping into his demeanour as he examines him, but he can’t quite mange to stop himself. Tony knows that this is a habit of his; as he studies opponents and allies alike, runs back video footage, surveys spending habits and daily routines, he is always asking,
“Do you have a better name?” Tony asks, pouring himself a few fingers of Suntory Hibiki and dropping an ice ball into his glass. “Come on, honeybunch. Where’s Hasegawa.”
“I can’t leave him out there,” Tony said, stubborn. Cage nodded. “I can do this.” To Cage’s credit, he said nothing about Tony’s manic ramblings. “Okay. If Steve had made it to one of these buildings in the past two days, his deputy would have had word already. And I reckon Wilson has already got a plan for if he comes in, yeah?”
had he been there?
“They always leave,” Tony says again. The easiness with which the words come is all wrong. They rip the breath from Steve’s throat with their brutality, and they pull Carol in like a magnet. She crushes Tony to her chest, his face buried in the side of her neck. “I’m a genius, but that’s not enough. A brain in a can. I’ve never been enough to make anyone stay-”
“We’re both assholes.” Steve smiles unhappily. “That’s why we’re in this business.”
Boring, but good. That seems on brand.
Tony sucks in a slow breath.
Tony taps his fingers against his chin a few times. “Okay. Run it through simulations based on both Amora and Loki’s readings, poke at the variables, and I’ll see what I can get from Thor in the morning.”
“Weak sauce, Foghorn Leghorn, weak sauce.”
Once again, cathalinaheart's lovely art for that first scene is here:
“So, it’s my fault,” Pepper says, nodding. Her mouth trembles a bit, and Tony reaches to touch her cheek before changing his mind.
Tony laughs as he takes out another group of Hydra agents attempting to flee the scene. "Oh, that bastard." And then, "You opened my mail? That's a federal crime."
“A wise idea,” JARVIS agreed, and Steve nodded. “My scanners would suggest that your biometrics have almost returned to their normal levels.”
“I come for the company,” Tony amended, but that seemed a little too honest. He cleared his throat. “No one else in this thrice-damned town will play me at chess anymore. Too much lost money and hurt feelings.”
“I wasn’t exactly a confidant,” Steve acknowledged, mouth twisting as he remembered how poorly their first meeting had gone.
“I like that idea,” Jamie says, and Pepper nods.
He’d tried Googling “why does my mate smell different?” but that just brought up a whole host of strange things about yeast infections and smegma and STIs that made his skin crawl. He’d closed that webpage pretty quickly. When he’d asked “can you be an alpha and an omega at the same time?” he’d gotten some confusing answers about trans-natured people and gender identity, and he didn’t think that what he was looking for at all. Then he’d typed in “people who choose to wear blockers all the time” and stumbled onto some blogs that claimed to be a part of something they called the anti-dynamicist movement. And there, on the internet for everyone to see, on a post with over
“Thor did it last year, and he and Jane are married.” Steve grinned.
“No,” Loki says, and Tony nods at him.
“Nothing,” Tony tells him. He glances over at his armour, which probably has tentacle goo in it now. “I guess I’ll have to clean that.”
Tony just breathes for a moment, thinking. “Not really,” he admits. “But not all of us have perfect recall, Steve.”
Steve huffs, frustrated. “I don’t know what answer you’re looking for, Professor.”
Steve laughs, throat rougher than he expected it to be. “That penny dropped years ago.”
By Strange’s expression, this is not the desired result. Tony can tell, and any levity that had creeped into his face immediately falters, then disappears entirely as the smoke fills the whole of the room.
Thor’s laughter is a familiar rumble as he leans over the back of the couch, placing a gentle hand on Tony’s shoulder. “I shall fetch the dustpan,” he says, and then disappears.
“If I’m remembering correctly,” Tony hums, “giant Pacific octopodes mate for upwards of four hours sometimes.”
"Sure," Tony says, a deep feeling of trepidation creeping up on him. This does not bode well for future negotiations. "Whatever you want, Michelangelo. Paint away."
team?" Loki inquires, raising one eyebrow.
“Well,” Bruce says, “Pepper is already doing construction on the mansion. If you wanted a place to retreat to, should something happen…” He surveys Tony’s wince with an unsympathetic eye. “I know you have bad memories lodged there, but it’ll look different than you remember. And it might be time for us to expand a bit, if you’re thinking recruitment.”
“I was such a wreck at that point that I just smelled like alpha fear and anger. I’d been wearing the same clothes for months, and I’d sweat in them. Apparently it was overwhelming. I wouldn’t know.” He smiled, a sharp flash of a thing that made Steve wince. “My GP reached out to Pepper while I was gone. She was my health proxy, and he thought that someone involved in my recovery needed to know. Smart move on his part, even if it was kind of illegal. Pepper sent meds with Rhodey, so he’d be able to help me when he found me. She didn’t tell him what it was, because she’s the most incredible friend I didn’t know I had.”
“Oh, look at you. My sweet thing,” Tony purred, kissing him over his eyes, his cheekbones, the sensitive corner of his mouth. “I’ve got you. I have you, baby, come for me, come on.”
“Can you see me?” he asked. There were still strains of fighting happening around him now, but Widow seemed to be watching his six well enough. He had to fight off a few more goons, but he stayed put. “Can Tony see me?”
When he pulls away his head is spinning, and Steve looks ravenous. His eyes are black, just a thin ring of blue around the pupil.
Credit to this excellent meta for giving me background re: Steve’s medical history. http://meta-buck.tumblr.com/post/103316156094/a-prisoner-of-your-own-body-pre-serum-steve I’m chronically ill myself (and wear glasses, which isn’t quite the same as colour-blindness but still), so it was a great read/really interesting to think about how it would feel to wake up and just…be fine. Ironically my next Potterlock Chapter has been tentatively titled Deuteranopia (for the past few months R.I.P.) so that’s the kind of colour blindness I decided Steve had. It also explains his weird obsession with the red white and blue. It’s pretty novel to him, actually. ‘MURICA °˖✧◝(⁰▿⁰)◜✧˖°
“What?”
Unbidden, the image of the little glass bottle came to him.
There was a crackle of static over the speakers, but the fighting was winding down now. Steve couldn’t have pulled his eyes from the little blinking red light if he tried.
Tony’s teeth grazed the thin skin there, carefully, just enough to make Steve sob.
“Say it again,” he begs. “Please.”
“Keep me updated on whatever bullshit he spins, so I know what to say when I next get ambushed by camera-laden vultures.”
You do not have to walk on your knees
“Tony!” Steve hisses. Then he sucks in a breath, shaking his head like a wet dog. “Sorry. You’re…I’m sorry. Give me a minute.”
“I fucked this up,” Tony admits, and Steve swallows.
“I do not like to admit limitations to my programming, Captain, but I think you already know I am not the unbiased party my original programming might suggest me to be in this matter.”
. He never fucking listens. “Actually, I…Fury and Romanov have been bugging me about taking more missions with the STRIKE team while Barton is on leave.”
Steve shook his head to clear his thoughts, following Natasha through the door that led to Clint’s quarters. Clint’s sitting room was kind of messy, clothes and a few empty beer cans lying around. The TV was on low, subtitles flickering at the bottom, and Natasha shook her head at the sight and walked over to turn it off. Up ahead, Clint padded out and leaned against his bedroom door, one hand scratching idly at his jaw as he yawned at them. He took one look at Steve and shook his head.
“Stephen already did some digging around Steve’s death. He didn’t find anything.”
"Get ready for pickup, bird brain."
“Fuck, yes, Jesus. Lock it,
It had been 78 hours since Steve’s death, and this is the first time Tony’s slept since it happened. He’d spent the entirety of the first night pulling blood from Angel, Logan, and every other regenerator and immortal-type in the superhero community. Nothing had helped. He’d even tried talking to Loki and Doom. He’d hovered over vials of Steve’s blood with the Hanks. He’d spent a sparse fifteen minutes crying silently, violently, piteously in the bathroom, then washed his face and come out and done it all over again.
The tension was broken by the beeping of the fridge, and Steve turned to finish putting the butter away.
“Some of these machines are Strucker’s design alone. I cannot determine their purpose without more time.”
“I…” Steve tries, then stops. There are so many things wrong with Tony’s assessment he doesn’t even know where to begin. No one can even hear him, which he is, for once, desperately glad of. He feels like he’s coming apart.
“We aren’t a Pack,” Tony says slightly hysterical, because there’s a terrible suspicion creeping up on him. “Bruce, I’m not an alpha.”
“You’re only gonna get to use that card a few more times,” Steve tells him, and Tony swallows down a completely inappropriate laugh. “Two, maybe three. Pick ‘em wisely, genius.”
“Sorry,” Steve manages. His head is twisted to this side, half of his face buried in the pillows. He looks half-gone, his brows furrowed. “God, you have no idea how many times I’ve thought about this.”
“Mm?”
“You’re stuck with me, now,” Tony teased, but he was grinning about it. Something in Steve’s face made the smile slip from his lips, though, turn serious and gentle. He traced over the line of Steve’s cheekbone with one calloused thumb.
He was surprised that Steve hadn’t asked after Barnes, though, now that he thought about it. Maybe he was so focussed on Tony and his own health that it hadn’t occurred to him to worry? But no; Steve had been on a monomanic quest to recover Barnes for the past two years.
"Creepy stalker much?"
, were responsible for the protection of the house, and omega
“I thought we had come to an accord,” Loki says wryly, and Tony feels his chest tighten a little.
“Why?” Tony asks, wary, and Steve offers him a wry smile.
Tony sits on the couch sideways, turning so his body faces Steve’s. He curls an arm around his shoulders, pressing his nose to the soft line of Steve’s hair at his temple. Steve doesn’t move, just holds himself still, and Tony sighs and presses a gentle kiss to his cheekbone.
. It was still so awful when you laid it out like that. “They have, unfortunate as it is, never truly had a chance at a civilian life. You, on the other hand, attended art school, graduated, and began a career in illustration before you joined the military. You had a mother who loved you, and something like a brother who you fought alongside in the war. You just may be the only one of the Avengers who understands how unusual the life you now lead is, simply by having a point of comparison.”
“I look forward to it,” Dr. Chandrakar says, sounding beautifully genuine. Tony could kiss him. He restrains himself, barely. “Do you want a kerchief…?”
“Come on up for a game, then,” Tony said easily, because someone needed to be. Rogers was never going to be that man, but that was alright. Tony was from Gotham, where tastes were a little more cosmopolitan. “If you think I cheat at cards, you can try me at chess.”
The disc hits the basketball with a much more satisfying sound this time, and the ball pops up onto one of the branches it was wedged into. It rolls leisurely along for a breathless second, and then it’s falling. Steve bounds forward to catch it, then turns around and holds it aloft to show Tony, unaccountably proud of himself.
“Well, you can’t go on a date with yourself,” Pepper agreed, to another round of laughs, and,
“And if it didn’t work, you wouldn’t get Steve’s hopes up?”
He’s tried to stay on the other side of the door when Tony’s in the bathroom, but the jacuzzi tub is too far from the door. Steve’s been dreading the day that Tony uses it, because then there will be nowhere to go. He’ll just have to stand there, and watch Tony, and he can imagine it, can’t he? Tony easing in with a soft groan to lie back in the hot water, his olive skin dotted with moisture and-
Tony doesn’t know what to say to that. This is Bruce in a nutshell, though. Effortlessly brutal and kind, all at once.
“Like me?” Steve says, trying his best to hide his bitterness. By the huff of air that escapes Tony, he’s not sure he succeeds.
. Be inexcusably rude to him while he’s trying to make small talk on the flight back to the helicarrier.
“I didn’t mean it like that,” Tony says, waving his free hand. “Reed was just talking shit. The fault is mine.”
He doesn’t want to get into the elevator with Tony.
“He may have just been drunk,” Steve says, wincing. He nods, once. “Tony’s changed. That’s what you’re saying, isn’t it?”

“I did not intend to trigger a panic response, no,” Loki says, sounding offended. “However, if you entered into battle tonight with such a conflicted mind, you would have lost. I need the logical, pragmatic genius. It was better to excise the wound now than to wait.”
“Cheating.”
"Hawkeye," Cap says warningly.
Eventually, Tony throws his hands up and falls onto the workshop couch. Steve falls down next to him, half into his lap. And then he lays there, and does his best to tone out the argument happening above him, because he feels sicker than he’s ever felt with the serum in his body. If he had a head, it would be splitting open with pain.
, he doesn’t say, but Steve hears it as loud as if he’d shouted it.
Steve blinks, because he’s never thought about the team like that. Is that how other people see them? Him as the idealist, and Tony as the architect?
“Astrologers?” Tony repeats, a little offended. “I am a man of science, Miss Potts, how dare you.”
“This pretty little lady right here is named Amora, but she goes by Enchantress. She’s an Asgardian, and apparently the goddess of love.” The Connecticut senator in the corner snickers, and Tony fixes him with a look. “You wanna laugh? Two minutes of exposure to her had Captain America acting like an adolescent ball of hormones. He attacked me, one of his supposed best friends, in an elevator during a common disagreement.” Tony flicks the footage of Cap punching him up onto the big screen for effect, but turns off the sound. A little lie to convey the seriousness of the situation never hurt anybody.
“Can’t help that you don’t have taste buds after all that army coffee.”
“Only to you!”
“Captain Rogers, if I let anyone just walk in and have a chat with Miss Potts whenever they pleased, Miss Potts would never get anything done,” Ms. Bliss says, adjusting her glasses. She narrows her eyes at Steve, and Steve strains himself to keep an easy smile on his face. “I know you think that just because you’re an Avenger you can do whatever you please-”
“Who are you telling?”
“I probably shouldn’t stay in the U.S., even.”
"No," Steve says, shaking his head. It's an old game, but they have yet to run out of new things for Steve to learn about. Tony looks at him with mock indignation.
Steve doesn’t know how long he stares at his computer screen without looking at it, but whatever the answer is, it’s too long.
Tony tilts his head back onto the lounger and throws an arm over his eyes. And then, with no one to see him but the early moon and a few lone seagulls, he cries himself sick. He cries like he hasn’t cried in years—since Jarvis died, and Tony had nothing but the rest of his lonely life staring at him like the barrel of a rifle: the longest, darkest tunnel, with only death at the end. He cries until he’s sick all over his lovely imported French tiles.
“Sheriff,” Tony said, but it was the wrong thing to say. Rogers’ face closed up like a safe door. “Aw, hell, don’t be like that.”
“So the alternative is to never ask for what you want when it matters?” Bruce asks him. “You’re not the autocratic leader of America, Tony. You act like you’re one step away from becoming a supervillain-”
“Sure, Cap. Me, too.”
Tony lets out a slow groan, rubbing a hand over his eyes. JARVIS tones down the sound of traffic now that he’s awake, and he lies there in the silence for a few blissful seconds. He’s been dreading this meeting all week.
Steve’s frowning again. “What did I do wrong this time?” he asks, tiredly, and that’s the answer, isn’t it? That’s Tony’s answer, right there.
Loki glances between him and Steve for a moment, expression unreadable. Then he dips his head, disappearing in a blinding flash of gold. Interesting. Tony files that away for later, then turns to Steve.
“What was that for?” Stein complains, scrambling after her. The deinonychus ambles after him, turning to offer Tony a strangely polite dip of the head as it passes by. Right. Delinquent superpowered teens with a sapient dinosaur and…is that a giant nose ring?
“Love is for children,” Tony murmurs, remembering what she said to Loki.
They’re going to figure this out. Him and Tony. They’re going to figure it out.
“About what?” Tony said, and he looked so exhausted. Like he already knew. A warning growl built in Steve’s throat, without him being able to help it, and Natasha held her hands up, fork and all.
“It’s a date,” Steve says, which, no.
“Changed my mind,” he said. “I don’t want to know.”
“Stay,” Steve said instead, reaching a hand up to keep Tony in place as he held him down just under the reactor. He pushed his own pants down with one hand, pulling his cock out and beginning to stroke it roughly while his eyes roamed over Tony’s naked, heaving body.
But Tony doesn't want to ask Steve for anything. That's the thing he hadn't been able to say to Bruce, that he's kept hidden behind the arc reactor next to his battered heart all this time. He doesn't want Steve's noble sacrifices. His careful, smothering sense of duty. His beautiful tears. After their last conversation, he'd expected shouting. Recriminations. He'd expected all of the weighty force of Steve's anger to come bearing down on him, just like it had on the helicarrier. He was prepared for that. He'd expected that. He wasn't ready for this coy, teasing campaign. He wasn't prepared for mischief and flirtation, for Steve to bare his heart like it was easy and then ask for Tony to do the same.
“Steve,” Tony gasps, and Steve sits up. Heat rushes down to his cock. He doesn’t know if he can get hard, but by God, he wants so many things. He’s just a man. “Fuck.”
“We have sacrificed liberty for convenience!” Ghost screams. Spittle flies from his mouth. “Heads of corporations run our most sacred branches of government! Tony Stark is a cancer-”
“Since Tony usually flies or drives himself,” Steve says, and Evan nods. “Well. I’ll admit, I’m just as happy taking the subway. But I’ll keep that in mind.” He studies Evan carefully. “You’ve been bored, huh?”
“Yikes,” Peter mutters, which, yes. Yes, that is the correct response.
Stephen doesn’t say anything, and Tony turns back to him. His grey eyes are narrowed, suspicious, and Tony throws up his hands.
“Tony, do not mistake me. Just because he is Captain America, does not mean you have to let this stand. You have rights. People who will protect you.” He winces, then, taking a long draught from his cup as Tony blinks at him, completely baffled. “I must admit, I don’t understand why you didn’t say something at the start, but you are notorious for hiding your hurts. I suppose I am not so surprised, after all.”
Tony looks up at the door to the workshop, waving a hand for JARVIS to let Thor in. Clint and Natasha are behind him, looking somewhat bewildered.
“Well,” he says. “We could park it in the Memorial Park.”
“You keep saying that,” Tony muses, “but I’m optimistic.”
It was like touching an electric fence, sensation rocketing down his spine in a lightning spark that made him arch, opening up his body instinctively as he went limp under Tony’s touch. It felt like being drugged, like Tony pushing inside him on that first, sweet, burning slide, like the full force of the sun on a beach in August. It felt like Tony had split him open down the middle, and when he pulled his hand back Steve reached out desperately for him, gasping. He hadn’t even realised he’d stopped breathing.
He puts his hand into the cryochamber first, feeling a little silly about it. Touching his own hand doesn’t seem to have any effect, so he pushes through the side, then lies down on top of his own motionless body. His head sinks back into his own head. He lines his feet up as best he can. Then he concentrates on trying to move his hand, and have his flesh hand come with it. Again and again, he lifts his hand, but nothing happens. He flexes his toes. He takes a deep breath. He shouts, but it doesn’t do a single thing. Nothing moves. He’s lying in a coffin with his own corpse, and he can’t do a single damn thing about it. His body might as well be another piece of furniture.
Steve licks his lips. “Ah.”
Reed hums. He flicks something on his screen over to Tony’s. “I’m making an observation.” He reaches over to Tony’s screen, enlarges a graph. “Look at this.”
“Alpha?” he shouted, spinning around. He took out another two soldiers with his shield, eyes searching frantically for a camera, something. He stopped when he found a CCTV camera in one corner, staring up into it with what he knew was quiet desperation. “Tony?”
. The sounds you made, your mouth…”
There are more things Steve wants to say. That it isn’t easy, and that he’s still trying to forgive himself. That he forgave Tony a long time ago. That he would love Tony even if he hadn’t forgiven him, had loved him even as they fought. But he doesn’t say any of those things. Instead he leans forward and crushes his mouth to Tony’s to stop his protestations, sliding his hand up Tony’s chest to cup the nape of his neck. He drowns Tony’s self-doubt in desire.
This is a kind of therapy he is intimately familiar with; soldiers around a table, sharing drinks and horror stories. He remembers Peggy’s unsmiling face, her cool professionalism masking what he knew was genuine care. He remembers, too, his Howling Commandos. He thinks Jim Morita would have liked Clint a lot.
“For what?” Tony asks. He’s soldering the boards for the light relays, and thus has a perfectly valid reason to avoid looking at Steve at all.
“You’ve found Tony a new game,” Pepper says, amused. “You should see him torturing Steve with pop culture.” She looks at Tony, expression souring. “Do I want to know what you’re planning to do?”
“You gonna talk to him?”
For a moment he doesn’t understand what he’s looking at. There’s a lot of pale skin, and he thinks maybe Steve has his phone pressed to his ear still. But then the camera moves away, and slowly, with the delight of the very, very inebriated, Tony discovers that he is in fact staring at Steve’s strangely hairless, impeccably sculpted, downright edible pectorals. There’s a flash of pink nipple, the top of his abs, before the camera is trained on Steve’s blushing face.
Love is your master, for he masters you;
“The depths of your depravity amaze me every time,” Tony said, shaking his head. “Come on, stud, let’s go. Maybe if you’re good we can have another round in the shower.”
Reed takes this in. “You mean…”
“For what?” Tony asks, quietly amused.
“Something about the heat now being regulated?” The sheriff sighed, scratching bashfully at the back of his skull. “To be honest, I don’t see half of what you and Peter are ever bobbering on about. Can you just go and make sure the boy’s not about to burn the poor widow’s house down?”
“There are enhanced whose powers amount to nothing more than an increased lung capacity, or a healing factor,” Secretary Mattis points out, shaking his head. “I agree, some of these men and women are dangerous, but-”
“Mmm, gorgeous,” Tony hummed. “Satisfied?”
Tash snorts. “Do you know why Amora decided to hurt you?”
“It is a Japanese animated film about a Word War I pilot cursed to live as an anthromorphic pig. The film is directed by Hayao Miyazaki. Miyazaki is arguably the most well-known Japanese director in the United States, and Agent Barton thought that Porco Rosso was best suited to your tastes.”
A L W A Y S I S
“Yeah,” Tony says. He pulls back, leaning over the fetch the lube from the drawer in his bedside table. He hasn’t had much occasion to use it of late, and it’s blessedly full. “You want me to use a condom?”
Tony laughs out loud, even as his cock twitches painfully in his boxers. “That’ll teach you to try to out-seduce an infamous, world-reviled libertine,” he calls, gleeful. The shower turns on, and he grins up at the ceiling. “Point one to me. Make a note, J.”
