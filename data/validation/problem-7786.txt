Tony gazed up at the ceiling, not sure whether he was asking JARVIS (or maybe a Norse god?) to spite him for messing up something as simple as buttered fucking toast. He did not have enough coffee in his system to deal with his own incompetence this early in the morning.
Tony took the sock and gently placed it back on Pete’s foot, chin lightly resting against the top of the boy’s fluffy head as he reached around the child in his lap, “Uh. Yeah, he taught me how to be angry. Howard taught me a lot of things. Best to save that story for another day.”
Desperately, his brain scrambled to find some solution to his error, because his legacy as a reluctant parental figure was not going to be butter-soaked breakfast.
“Mister Steve and I always go see the berry lady. She’s nice and old,” Peter informed the mechanic with an air of certainty that Captain Rogers possessed most of the time. It brought a quick smile to Tony’s face.
do this to me Rogers, I swear-” Tony began, yelling after the Captain, who was taking three steps at a time up to his floor. The genius followed as quick as he could, not having as long legs as the other man did.
Lunch on the floor lead to Peter feeling cautiously chaotic with the rule-breaking high, because by the time lunch ended, jelly and peanut butter had somehow gotten itself all over the boys face and in his hair.
Tony flinched as large, calloused hands gripped his shoulders. Blues bore into warm browns, Steve commanding all of his attention, “I’m not the least bit angry. Sometimes, I may get carried away with stories from the past, I won’t deny it. But now is more important than then. And Howard Stark was then. You’re now. I prefer now.”
A father, in charge of the happiness and well-being of a child. A dad, who was in a happy relationship with a nice looking, dorito of a man. And fuck, if this wasn’t sending Tony into a spiral because truthfully, he never imagined himself ever being called “dad” by anyone. He had never had that talk with anyone he’d ever been with; Pepper and him didn’t get their relationship stable enough to ever reach that point. And Tony had never really felt the urge to have a child, or be looked up to in that sort of way.
Tony cursed his fluttering (albeit weak) heart at the thought of ‘Steve’.
“Whatever for?”

There was a silence that followed, but the barely-there crackle of static indicated that JARVIS was very much listening, and had not powered down to leave Tony in the quiet.
She let go of his hand and gave him the once-over. Tony looked down in momentary panic to see if the black tape had somehow peeled off the arc and revealed his telling feature, but there was no hint of light peeking through.
“People just find a friendly confidant in me, is that so hard to believe?”
Stark quickly protested.
Yet the genius did not utter a single peep.
And oh no, Tony looked about ready to puke, the man’s eyes were glassy with unshed tears. There was a sound of a faint rip as the shirt hem that Tony had been anxiously fiddling with tore at Steve’s words. Cap really needed to stop.
(See the end of the chapter for
For a second, Tony had to fight the urge to snap. The sudden need to get angry, to scare the boy off from ever asking about Howard again. It was the automatic response to anyone when they asked about his dad. But then, that’s exactly what his father would have done. What his father had taught Tony to do. And although off-putting, adults knew how to interpret Tony’s harsh words as his defensive nature. But a child knew no difference. There was no way in hell he was about to discourage Peter from asking questions.

So, consequently, that night found the small group around the unusually empty dining table, eating pizza and conversing about their days. It was almost enough to help Tony ignore the doom lump in his airway, pretending that the metaphorical meteor that was undoubtedly on a coarse straight to their living room was, in fact, not coming. This fake ignorance only lasted for a few moments, however, until Natasha’s phone rang, vibrating in her pocket.
bring up for Peter, but he wasn’t going to take his chances.
“Peter Parker!” and oh no, he had used the tone his dad would use; that deep, ground shaking tamber that lodged fear right in every throat of the children who heard it.
“I don’t know, maybe because I ruined the memory of your good friend? You always seemed to enjoy telling stories about him. I thought maybe you wouldn’t want to hear it,” Tony explained, looking up into Cap’s blues. The super soldier raised an eyebrow at the mechanic, “Okay, don’t give me that look, I guess it was a little stupid.”
“Go to hell, JARVIS,” Tony barked, not needing the sass from his AI that he had lovingly  installed.
“What do you mean ‘
Cap huffed, bowing his head and closing his eyes, hand pausing at their frantic work. The pause in hectic movement felt like taking a deep breath to Tony, as if the air between them had settled with a simple pause of motion. Even so, his piercing grip on his own arms did not let up.
There was a pause from the other end of the phone; a deadly silence in which the world ceased to turn. Pepper hadn’t spoken once throughout all of his explaining, and without talking to her face, he couldn’t measure whether she was beyond pissed or cautiously indifferent. Tony waited with held breath, sitting stiffly on the bar-stool and staring down at the sparkling granite. His coffee rested on the counter next to the toaster behind him, having been forgotten in the bustle of Poptart preparing and conversing with his ex. The mug looked too lonely, and Tony
Tony gave a wet sniffle into Steve’s left peck, the super soldier honestly not caring if the man was leaving a tear stain or not.
Clint nodded in agreement, “The media will pounce on this once it gets out. And they will find out, we can’t keep the kid locked in the tower his whole life.”
“Howard was a dick,” Steve grumbled, a slight bout of anger snaring in his stomach. He felt betrayed,
He expected Peter to agree, to declare that Tony was indeed the worst; a failure because he couldn't even get one freaking bath right. Instead, the boy began giggling, as if the self deprecation was entertaining.
Tony opened his mouth as if to retort, and Steve could almost heard the inevitable ‘no I haven’t’, but then the man closed his mouth, realizing it was no use arguing with Captain Rogers.
Steve notices something's up with Tony, and tries to get it out of him. He may get more than he bargained for.
The second warning sign had occurred a couple of days after the Captain’s hug, when Doombots were once again sighted terrorizing the unfortunate city of New York. The team went into panic, all looking down at the child in their possession, none of them quite sure what to do.
Peter reluctantly let go of Tony, pouting while looking at Steve as if the good Captain had done the child wrong.

“Mr. Tony? Are you sad?” Peter asked, concern heavy in his tone. The boy began to sit up on his bed, sensing something was wrong. Tony reached out and patted Peter’s legs, assuring him that he need not worry.
(See the end of the chapter for
They both sat in silence, watching until the bath was ready before pulling off Pete’s Hulk themed underwear. He squealed when Tony dipped him in the bath, writhing in his arms with enough gusto to make the genius weary of an accidental punch to the nose.
Alternative chapter title: Feels For Daysssssss
“Right. Okay. We can do this, right?” Tony assured himself, sighing deeply as he crouched down to where Pete sat. The boy nodded and wiggled a sock-covered foot at him, gesturing for him to take it off.
, not a machine, and Tony was really starting to feel the need to scream because the universe just really fucking hated him sometimes didn’t it-
The pair stumbled when the boy launched himself at Tony’s legs, clinging to them in a hug with a wide smile plastered on his face. Pete’s cheeks were rosy red in excitement, and for a moment, Steve allowed himself to enjoy the child’s happiness. However, he quickly reminded himself why they were there in the first place, and changed his focus to Tony.
Oh god, he wasn’t going to be able to get down to the workshop today, was he? Pepper was going to murder him.
“Mr. Tony, I know you’re awake,” Peter said, giggling as he pat at Tony’s face. The mechanic groaned, eyes fluttering open at being found out. The boy cheered and began wriggling once more, bouncing up and down from where he sat on Tony’s chest.
“Pep, honey, you’re killing me here. I already told you, this is why I’m calling you in the first place. There
But the man was still reeling from the dread of possibly blinding Peter, so nothing could have prepared him for the cup full of water that was thrown right in his face.
when he had a nightmare, let alone a five year old kid, “Do you, uh, wanna sleep with me?”
Tony tightened the embrace for a few seconds before pulling away, cheeks slightly flushed as he emerged from the comfort of Steve’s arms, “So you aren’t angry?”
“Tony, I’m sorry, there’s nothing I can do,” Rogers addressed quickly, sprinting down the hall towards the stairs, and there was no fucking way he was going to let the good Captain go so easily.
“JARVIS?” Tony addressed to the camera he knew was hidden in the corner above his head. If he squinted hard enough, he could make out the swivel of the device, turning to focus on him.
Once breakfast had been successfully achieved, the next step of the day was the park. A step that, at first, Tony thought could be put off until later in the afternoon so he could start working on the smartphone prototype. However, he was soon proven that, no, the trip to the park had to happen right then because apparently, Pete and Poptarts did not mix well.
If someone had told him that finding Peter had been some part of God’s plan, he would have believed them in a heartbeat. There had been such raw vulnerability in those brown eyes; it had broken Steve’s heart in two and immediately stitched it back together with vibranium sutures. He had always thought the concept of “love at first sight” had been so naive when he saw it in the films. Now, he wasn’t so sure they had been far off the mark.
The biodegradable basket was offered to him, little hands barely able to encapsulate the whole thing. Tony wordlessly accepted it, throwing it into the lake, completely lost in attempting to stave off an odd sort of panic attack. It wasn’t a feeling he’d ever experienced before. It was something of a panic, sure, but it was filled with emotions that he couldn’t discern. And he usually ignored his emotions, but this lodge of something foreign-feeling would not let it’s presence go unnoticed.
Tony mocked her, humming unsurely, as if he didn’t always come running to Pepper when anything happened; as if he didn’t know she was a good listener.
There was a deep rumble on the other side of the line, and Tony immediately knew that a Fury-sized meteor had just interrupted their dinner. And honestly, Tony should have guessed the goddamn meteor was Nick Fury, of course it was that man’s fault.The assassin's face went stony and her lips pressed into a thin line as she got her orders, green eyes turning dark and serious.
Happiness looked good on Tony Stark.
“No. I wanna keep playing,” Peter replied, and damn it, Pete never said ‘no’ to Cap when he asked. Tony was being conned, he knew it, the child was a manipulative little bastard.
Tony ate breakfast with Pete the next morning, distracting the child as Cap talked on the phone with Fury about the morning’s headlines. Fury was scolding the Captain about taking the Hulk off the field and not thinking about the media fire, if the loud shouts from the other end were anything to go by. Which honestly didn’t make much sense to Tony because wasn't SHIELD dismantled?
Tony pressed his face harder into Steve’s shirt, as if he wanted to become part of the fabric. Peter and Stark were sometimes eerily alike.
The feeling of doom was lumping in the billionaire’s throat, quiet yet undeniably there. Tony could no longer pull off genuine smiles, his lips now only able to form weary grimaces. And he couldn’t place what was making him feel so afraid. But what goes up must come down, and he was sure something was about to come down hard.
“Rogers. Don’t,” Tony croaked, voice cracking as he clenched his teeth. There was no use in telling Cap “don’t”, but this wasn’t fair and the super soldier knew it.
For those of you who know me as the author of Recalibrate, don't worry, I am not abandoning that fic. This is actually the fic I work on when I can't get a chapter of Recalibrate down on the page, so have no fear!

“I miss Daddy all the time. But he’s coming back, he promised,” Peter declared, determination so ingrained in his conviction, Tony didn’t have the heart to tell the boy that Dad wasn’t coming back, no matter how much Peter had loved him.
Bath time occurred early that evening because of this, beginning with an exhausting chase after the elusive five year old monster who ‘didn’t need a bath’ and ‘liked the pb and j on his face just fine.’ And even though it turned out to be quite a struggle to get the peanut butter out of the child’s hair, Tony was ready this time for the ornery splashes of bath water Peter sent his way.
Steve’s heart had dropped the moment the man stepped out of the elevator that Saturday morning. There had been pain, apprehension, and dare he say fear written all across Tony’s face, eyes zeroing in on the child in Steve’s lap as if he was seeing the stuff of his nightmares. He should have held on to Peter, should have told the boy to be gentle around Tony, because it was obvious the billionaire had been on edge. Instead, he had let Peter make a beeline to Tony, and everything had gone downhill from there.
For some reason, Tony had assumed the walk to the berry lady would only take a couple of minutes. For some reason, Tony forgot that Steve Rogers did not get tired of walking and a five year old boy had all the energy in the world. For some reason, Tony did not remember the fact that neither the Captain nor the small child would have a sense of exhaustion or time when it came to a stroll in the summer heat.
Maybe Steve brought Peter home because he reminded the super soldier of the late Peggy Carter. Sweet, caring, and ready to do the right thing. He had thought he had seen Peggy in those tearful eyes, but that brown wasn’t Ms. Carter’s shade of brown. It was a beautiful brown, with flecks of gold and dark reds woven subtly into the warm chocolate color. Eyes that were
“He worshiped you, you know. Never stopped looking for you….”
“No killing!” Peter exclaimed, before falling into another fit of laughter, splashing more water out of the white ceramic tub. Tony couldn’t help but chuckling along. Tony attempted to commence the bathing once more, but Peter making a game of it to dash away from the genius. This, of course, got old very quickly, until he gave up on the rest of the bath, settling for the half-washed child.
“James Buck. Captain America’s very best friend,” and oh, Tony’s heart dropped to his stomach. Bucky. Of course, there was no one better to tell bedtime stories about than Bucky Barnes.
Tony’s face was beginning to get red as the anger rose within him, and somewhere deep in his mind, Steve tried to remind himself that getting frustrated was not helping anyone. But he was too far gone to care.
“Oh, meeting him in the middle? How’s that worked out for you so far?”
There was one clue, however, that Tony Stark was banking on.
something was about to happen but he had no fucking clue what was about to hit. It was like knowing the was a warning that some weather was coming, but all the weather forecasters had died, so no one knew if there was a light rain shower or a goddamn meteor coming their way.
So of course, Peter was dressed with a shirt of the Captain’s shield, Nike shorts that had the “Just Do It” swish artistically placed to be Iron Man’s smoke trail, and gym shoes with all the Avengers on them, lighting up with every step the walking advertisement took.
Tony woke up that Tuesday morning to a squirming body atop him, knobby elbows and knees jabbing into his ribs. For a moment, he froze up. He was in unfamiliar territory, and that humming noise above him must be a helicopter flying by, and the small body wriggling around must be some new type of torture the Ten Rings were introducing; what could that small body be? Were they trying to torture by small monkey?
But then the groans of “Mr. Tony, Mr. Tony,
After his hair was sufficiently wet, Tony grabbed hold of the “no-tears” shampoo, ready to sue the shampoo company if he saw any sign of salty water in the boy’s eyes. Peter eyed the bottle in Tony’s grasp skeptically, uncertain eyes drifting up to look at the man.
Smiling to himself, Tony slowly rose off the bed, ducking his head as he stood so as to not collide with the flying Iron Man making laps around the room. He left the door open behind him, just in case Pete yelled for him during the night.
gonna be parenting, don’t you dare say that!”
re-lived those days whenever an episode was triggered. There was no fighting it off. His PTSD was as hard to fight as it was to defeat a dragon. And dragons weren’t real, so it was damn near impossible.
He swore it had been the Arc Reactor. But it was obvious now that he had been wrong, and maybe Peter’s lips on Tony’s chest may have not been the best thing to help whatever was going on.
Tears streamed down Tony’s face as the man finally broke, screaming as he had never screamed before, “
to go to bed at the same time the small child did.
When Pete opened his mouth, Tony expected him to say something along the lines of ‘are you sure you know what to do with that’ or just plainly ‘I don’t trust you’. Instead, Peter asked, “Why does Mr. Steve call you Tony?”
“Yes, but I’m an adult and it’s my job,” he retorted, Pete’s eyes narrowing as the genius used the dreaded ‘you aren’t old enough’ excuse, “And, um, if you don’t go to bed on time, then Iron Man is going to be sad.”
Tony followed behind him, grinning like a stupid idiot. This was, dare he say, slightly enjoyable? Cap was right, he had this in the bag.
(See the end of the chapter for
As soon as Tony caught his breath, even though his hands still slightly shook, his face broke into a grin, “Oh, you’re gonna get it!”
Cap tried again, “There’s something off. And I don’t know why you’re being silent about it. You obviously aren’t okay with Pete, and-”
So first of all, I am super sorry for the huge hiatus there. Basically, school happened, and for me, it's really hard to juggle being a science major in college with my joy for writing. So naturally, I fell off of the face of the earth without a word.
It would have been so easy to follow these images, to get sucked into them, suffocating in the memories. He almost felt the start of losing himself, body beginning to curl inwards subconsciously, when his gaze fell to the boy in the bathtub.
In a haze, he paid Gladus the two dollars needed for the biodegradable basket of blackberries, and followed Pete as the boy ran to the edge of the lake to feed the ducks. Tony never really saw such an activity as feeding ducks to be so exciting, but here Peter was, throwing berries in the lake with such enthusiasm, as if his life would amount to this moment, and only this moment.
“Captain, I really don’t need to have this discussion right now, I was working on-”
They were having an Avengers meeting, everyone sitting on couches and chairs as they discussed the newest pressing issue: Peter Parker. It was Monday, and they had all agreed to eat lunch over the topic in the communal living room. Which had been the first sign something was off, because Tony had come out of his workshop without even a grumble of frustration, eyes glued to the Stark Pad held tightly in his grip. Not a single word was uttered from Tony’s direction, not even a chuckle.
“Well. I mean. It’s stupid, you don’t have any of Jarvis’s memories. You just sound like him and do stuff for me like he did and,” Tony paused, taking a deep breath. He was rambling as he always did when he couldn’t get the words right, “Well, I just wanted to say thank you. For taking care of me. For being a Dad to me. I wish I could have told you when you weren’t an AI. But, well… Damn it I’m rambiling. Just, uh, thanks for reading me bedtime stories.”
“R-Rogers, I can’t- Howard was a drunk-” Tony suddenly sounded like he was pleading, and Cap really should have reeled it in, should have noticed that the man was needing the fight to stop immediately. He should have realized that he was suddenly in very dangerous territory. But he would go to hell before doing so, because Tony Stark was always able to rile him up and make him say things that were mean and biting, and this time was no exception.
“I’ll call you Mr. Tony then,” Peter declared. Tony’s hands paused in the boy’s hair as a spike of pure joy rocketed through his heart. For something such as a name, something that really shouldn’t matter, he was over the moon. Being Peter’s favorite hero no longer included just the suit, but now also included the man who wore the suit. And he was sure it didn’t mean anything, being called Mr. Tony, but it felt like everything to him.
And holy shit she totally looked like a Gladus. Tony would have guessed Margret on the fly, but ‘Gladus’ fit this woman like cookies and milk. Which he was almost certain this woman fed to her grandchildren when the parents weren’t watching.
“It’s okay, Mr. Tony. Mr. Steve gets water in my eyes all the time when I’m taking a bath,” Pete managed between giggles, splashing his hands against the surface of the water again.
“No it’s not,” Tony tried to assure the boy, but Peter was having none of it.
,” Tony glared at the hidden cameras he knew were placed in the room, seeing as how he had done the placing, “Are you spying on us, Ms. Potts?”
“You’re full of crap, Tony. Call Bruce. You have to be at tomorrow's meeting with everything prepared, no exceptions. Make sure to get
The pair walked up to the glass sliding doors, hands plastered to the side of their heads as they peered in. Tony could be seen at his metal workshop table, banging his head to the music as he fiddled with something in his hands. Blue holographic screens surrounded him, causing an eerie blue glow to reflect in his brown eyes. His Arc Reactor shone through an Aerosmith shirt, fabric thin from many times of wear. So much blue. Whoever insisted Tony’s colors where red and gold had never met the man, because the color was so obviously the electric blue that he surrounded himself in and housed in his chest.
“Got everything?” Natasha asked the Captain, who nodded quickly. They both gave Peter a goodbye peck on the cheek, Rogers gave some last few encouraging words for , and then they were gone.
Once the whimpering stopped, he took the towel away from the boy’s eyes, “Can you see?” Tony asked, swearing on his mother’s grave that he would never forgive himself if the child went blind. It hadn’t even been his fault, Peter had been the one to insist on playing with the water. But Tony felt immensely guilty, as if every accomplishment in his life didn’t matter when Peter was in pain.
Thank you all for reading and sticking by this process. Again, I'm super sorry it was such a long wait. Hopefully this chapter will make up for it!
Consequently, she was the only person that knew about his painful pining of the one and only Captain America.
the not so good thing happened.
“Cap, please,” Tony tried, but the blood pulsing in Steve’s ears was too loud, too deafening to focus on the shorter man a few long steps away.
It was take-away night, and Peter had chosen pizza, to the surprise of literally nobody. Tony had once said the boy ate pizza like an opioid addict popped pills, an analogy that had Cap sporting a disapproving frown and Clint snorting into his pepperoni pizza. The analogy was painfully accurate however, no matter how much Cap disapproved of it. They ate pizza at least two times a week because Peter insisted. Tony would have stopped it by now if the child didn’t get so damn happy when the pizza man arrived, treating the acne ridden, most likely high-as-a-kite teen as if they were the second coming of Jesus or David Bowie.
“Peter, listen,” Peter stopped throwing berries to look up at Tony with big brown eyes, probably sensing the seriousness of the man’s tone, “Am I… What am I?” and that was a damn stupid way to ask that question, wasn’t it? Tony quickly attempted to correct himself, “I mean, do you want to call me Dad? Am I Dad?”
The rest of the day went by smoothly enough, despite Peter seeming bored and agitated by Tony’s lack of ability to entertain while working on the new Stark smartphone prototype for the inevitable meeting the next day; a task that was no longer avoidable, despite how much Peter disapproved. And it ended up being clear that Peter didn’t have nearly the right amount of energy spent throughout the day, when the child didn’t immediately go to bed after a “James Buck” story. Peter’s plea to sleep with Tony and “his chest nightlight” was begrudgingly agreed to, and next thing Tony knows, Peter spends another night sleeping in the guest room with him.
They all turned to the billionaire in question, whose gaze briefly flickered up from the Starkpad. Once he realized all the attention was on him, he quickly looked back down at the screen, successfully avoiding everyone’s stares. Something was obviously wrong. Tony didn’t reply to Bruce’s question, even though he would normally jump at the opportunity to talk. He loved to converse like there was no tomorrow, and rarely ever went quiet, especially when the discussion was something important. And in Steve’s book, raising a child was a very important subject.
It was obvious that, in that moment, a line was crossed. Because Tony’s angry red turned to a sickly pale green, eyes widening at the mention of Stark Senior.
“Steve, you should talk to Tony about this. I tried to convince him to talk to you before you started to hunt him down. But he didn’t take my advice, I guess.” Bruce explained, his shrug heavy and defeated.  The super soldier nodded in silent understanding, patting the scientist on the shoulder softly before standing up, adjourning the discussion for the moment.
“Just do what Howard did,
must have gone right, so just

He had spent 70 years alone under ice. He could not tolerate a single moment more, no matter how much Tony liked to avoid people and disappear into himself.
Rogers looked up from the overflowing duffel bag. Sky blues met chocolate browns, and “Steve” settled on Tony’s tongue once more. He wanted to bite the word, kill it with a gnash of his teeth, but it felt too sweet on his taste buds; like a candy he just couldn’t bare to resist.
“Tony, I really don’t need to hear about this again. What you subscribe to on your off time is not my business-”
Steve gave in again on Wednesday, resolving himself to find Tony and figuring out what was
“Listen, I’m just- I’m not good with kids, okay? They cry and scream, they always want food. They’re different than machines, and I just prefer machines,” Tony said, waving his arms about in a desperate attempt to make Steve believe him. But no matter how hard Stark tried, he would always avoid eye contact with the person he was lying to. Tony’s eyes flickering from one object to another was a dead give away.
For a split second, Tony considered dissuading the young child about seeing the ‘berry lady.’ Work still hung over his head like an unwanted, depressive shadow, and going to the berry lady meant walking and taking longer at the park than he had planned. But then, Peter looked so set on seeing the berry lady, and who was he to stop a little man and his dreams?
Tony grabbed a Poptart pack out of the brown sugar box, which was Thor’s favorite flavor based on all the raving the Asgardian did about it. Sometimes, the mechanic suspected Thor only came back to Earth for the Poptarts, and not for his friends who lived on it.
Great. The park. Now Tony
His brain was swimming with work, figuring out his plans for the day, until a child’s disturbingly accurate sounds of play gunfire interrupted his train of thought. He realized exactly then what the full extent of Peter’s existence in his every waking moment truly meant.
“Mr. Iron Man is here to protect me, Mr. Steve! He’s gonna make the monsters go away!” Peter had exclaimed, a soft thumping sound indicating that the small boy was now jumping around in unadulterated joy. This was soon followed by a tired sigh from the Captain, who had just been able to get Pete to settle down with a glass of warm milk.
“Too hot! Too hot!” Peter insisted, stomping his feet on the mat as if trying to set out a fire. Tony groaned. The water had been fine, he swore. But apparently it hadn’t been cold enough, because Peter was now glaring at Tony as if every wrong thing with the world was because of him. He took a deep breath, settling the slight frustration that quietly lay deep in his stomach. It was so subtle, it almost felt like a leftover genetic reaction from Howard Stark. Lovely.
“Where are you going? Don’t leave! It’s pizza night!” Peter protested, slamming his fist down on the table as he had probably seen Tony himself do a couple of times. It would have been funny, small hands curled in angry fists, if Tony wasn’t focused on what this meant for him.
“Why don’t you call him Steve?”
he could hear desk drawers opening and slamming shut, possibly looking for a Starkpad to contact her new lover with.
“So I think it’s safe to assume Stark isn’t actually okay with this whole Peter thing,” Clint announced. Steve wanted to scold him for making light of the situation, but he settled for a withering glare instead. It would not do any good to upset another teammate at the moment.
But somehow dragons were real, and they could be defeated, because the desert and the cave began to recede from the peripheral of Tony’s vision until all that was left was the grinning child. And this was really something else, because only moments before, Tony had been so scared. But now, he felt a ball of happiness settle in his chest at the sight of Peter; a sort of happiness he had always associated with Pepper, Rhodey, and more recently, Steve.
They didn’t see Tony for two days, even with Steve conveniently placing himself in places he knew Tony would venture into at certain times of the day. But the genius never showed up, never gave any indication that he was alive after hastily leaving the meeting at lunch. And Cap was worried. Of course he always did this, always hid himself, always disappeared inexplicably. Yet Steve was always able to catch him stumbling into the kitchen and grabbing another cup of coffee (because if there was a coffee machine in the workshop, Tony would never be seen again).
They’d never hugged before. There was some handshakes passed between them throughout the years, yes. And there had been a side hug once; although that one hadn’t really counted, because carrying a bleeding Tony off the battlefield, supporting him as he limped, wasn’t actually a hug. So why Steve felt the need to hug the shorter man was beyond him. It probably had something to do with how broken the man looked, as if he had been keeping the weight of the world in his heart. And now, Steve was simply seeing what Tony felt every single time parents or kids or families were mentioned. It made sense, the need to be as far away from Peter as the genius could get. He now understood the clench in Tony’s jaw that came with every story Steve told of the late Howard Stark.
he tried to tell himself, cringing inwardly at his words. However, Peter did not pay attention to that part of Tony’s message, focusing instead on the fact that he was letting his favorite superhero down.
tried to give Tony the space and time he had needed. Although he didn’t exactly approve of Stark’s tendency to hide from conflict, he always attempted to give him an ample amount of alone time before approaching. But he couldn’t wait three days this time. He barely made it past one, too wrecked by Peter’s seemingly constant mood of sadness. The boy had really taken Tony’s reaction to heart. Peter hadn’t known what he had done wrong, but the guilt was obviously eating him up inside. Steve could not handle seeing Peter feel bad for simply being excited to meet Iron Man, and therefore, Sunday afternoon found themselves confronting a reluctant Tony in the library.
Peter’s splashing continued as Tony was left to his inner frantic thinking, the splash radius growing with each pat, until the bath water was soon flying over the edge. He was about to tell him to stop it, that bath water was meant to stay in the bathtub, when Peter stopped abruptly with a screech.
this has been a good talk. I’ve gotta go work on some… stuff, Pepper will kill me if I don’t. Ciao. It’s been real.”
that if Cap was there, Pete would be all but frolicking to the bathroom, giggling and having a grand old time with the star spangled man. He concentrated on slowly exhaling, grounding himself best he could, before delving into the horrors of responsibility.
The only evidence that the man was still alive was the small pieces of ‘Peter Proofing’ that had been laid around the tower. Random things that popped up, such as plastic covers for light sockets and squishy corner covers for table edges. New protocols, like “Feed The Creature”, which would supposedly alert a nearby Avenger when Peter was hungry. However, Steve was pretty sure it only alerted him, because Natasha had been in the kitchen when JARVIS alerted the Captain from his workout four floors down. And then there had been protocol “Change The Payload”, which was there to alert when Peter needed his diaper changed. And that’s when Steve knew that Tony didn’t know anything about children, because the five year old child was already potty trained and assured Steve that he was in fact “a big boy” and could use the potty “just fine”.
Tony attempted to reign in his frown at these words, following briskly behind Cap as they walked down the stairs to the communal floor, where Natasha would most likely be waiting. He did not want to call Bruce. He shouldn’t have to, because ‘Stark men are made of iron’ and surely Tony was stronger than to be bested by a five year old.
Tony fumbled with the plastic cup, accidentally dropping it into the bathtub with a splash. Peter apparently found this hilarious, because he laughed like a maniac, patting his hands on the water’s surface over and over as if he were playing patty cake with the liquid.
“Is that a child? Tony Stark, do you have a
Sad ending, but I swear this story is going to be happy at some point, trust me XD
Hey all!
It was after breakfast, Peter full with blueberry waffles and Steve feeling good after a refreshing morning run, that they got onto the elevator and headed down to Tony’s workshop. The mechanic would freak that Steve was bringing Pete down, but maybe catching Stark off his guard by bringing the object that was causing him distress would be what they needed to resolve this.
He tried to last for as long as he possibly could along the walk that Peter was giving him. And Tony was proud to say that he had made it pretty far before considering turning around, probable upset child in tow as consequence. The Loeb Boathouse was in sight, and the ducks on the lake were quaking, and really, he had done good to warrant a turn-around. But just when he was about to break the bad news to the brown-haired boy, Peter suddenly began to tow Tony along with a new vigor. And just like that, they were suddenly on a bee-line path straight towards an old lady with a fruit stand, her back to the lake behind her.
“So you see, that’s why I was calling you,” Tony explained, wrapping up the past few weeks, “I’m taking care of Peter today, so I’m not going to be able to get any work done,” he had pulled out Peter’s Poptart during the story, the boy now sitting at the dining table a few meters away from the granite island, eating his Poptart with ravenous content. Tony knew he was going to regret giving the five year old a sugary breakfast later on, but the idea that Peter had been eating nothing but healthy apples and granola bars in his stay at the tower made any sugar rush more than worth it.
dads, and Tony Stark’s weak heart felt ready to implode because damn it, he had not prepared for this sort of thing in a simple stroll through the park. But of course, nothing was ever simple in their life.
T: "yeah, im sorry about before it really wasn't my intension to make you uncomfortable"
S: "thanks I think it is because I have something I want to fight for"
S: "I want... you... to fuck me"
T: "I heard you screaming a name, Bucky who's that?"
I need to go for a walk I thought to myself, I got up out of bed and started getting dressed when I felt someone staring at me, it was tony he never left the room and now he was staring at my almost naked body while I was only in my captain America boxers, they all got me for Christmas last year, it felt good having him staring at me like that, I've always felt secure about myself even before the serum, but now with this beautiful man staring at me I couldn't think of anything but how much more pretty he was, his jaw was sharp with his beard making him look so good, wonder how it would have felt against my chin, and his toned body, with little to no chest hair, and the bulge in his pants looked like it was growing and mine was growing bigger in my pants, I guess he noticed because when I was just inches from him he pressed his body closer, our lips were almost touching and I could feel his bulge against my leg and he probably felt mine against his lower stomach.
The months passed by and me and Bucky spent almost every night together, and no one said anything I think it was because of my size, they were all scared I was going to die if I slept alone in those cold bunkers. I was not as strong and well trained as all the other were, we started everyday by running 2 miles before breakfast and 3 afterward, I was always the last one to reach the goal, but I had the courage, the will and I was a lot smarter than the others in my troop and I think that's why they had chosen me.
S: "please don't tell anyone, we told each other not to make a big deal out of it, were just trying... to see if it works you know"
B: "it's going to be alright"
This one is pretty much Fluff with some Angs and a pinch of smut if I'm right
T: "what took you so long?"
P: "we all have something to fight for you see, Peter over there he is fighting for his parents who were taken away from him by the Nazis, and john he is fighting so his daughter can live on outside the war.
I couldn't help it I jumped on him kissing his lips hard with passion, he picked me up and kissed back, his beard against my naked chin felt amazing, I kissed him more intense, he paused for a minute and looked into my eyes.
Bucky fell, he fell almost like in slow-motion until Steve couldn't see him no more
Steve: "I decided to join my boyfriend in the army" I said checking to se if anyone was around to hear
S: "yea sure I'll be down in a minute Tony"
We walked and talked for several hours, the sun came up and tony took me for breakfast at a diner near the tower, we got on the elevator and he turned to me looking at me with his brown eyes and parted his lips slowly.
S: "I just need some fresh air"
S: "yes, do you want to"
I heard from behind my back as I felt Bucky's arm on my shoulders, I got butterflies in my stomach as I always get when he is touching me, and he knew that
P: "now get back to doing those push-"
S: "sorry, I don't want to come over uninvited"
S: "what do you mean?"
B: "more than anything"
B: "I can't risk it"
He hung up leaving me and tony in silence again, he took my hand in his again and hugged it tight making sure he was there for me, I gave him a hug and kissed his forehead, we stayed like that a few minutes before he softly spoke into the crook of my neck sending shivers down my spine
S: "Bucky please I'm begging you, I need to cum"
He kissed me again standing us both up, and laid me on the bed and kissed me from my mouth, to my neck, to my chest, down my stomach, he kissed the tip of my penis, stroking my length, it was so small in his big hands, he took it in his mouth licking and sucking me, making me moan and trust into his mouth, he looked me in my eyes and kept sucking I was so close, I told him that and stopped
B: "Steve you know I love you"
S: "just had to talk to the crew before leaving"
N: "I promise, you need this im so happy for you guys"
S: "excuse me but who is that"
I never told any of the others avenger im gay, i never felt like talking about Bucky at all after the accident, i never thought I'd find love again, Bucky was my everything and would have loved to be able to show me off as his boyfriend, because after the war the law was changed and homosexuality was not illegal anymore, it was not seen as a sickness, and now in the 20th century it is celebrated, they have parades and even a whole month just for... "us", Bucky would have been so happy, we used to go to secret clubs for gay people just so we could hold each other, I was so small in his big strong arms, he'd always been so mad about the law he would have loved the 20th century. But I did find love again, that stupid and arrogant but beautiful man named Tony Stark
P: "I am here for the same reason as you, to make the world a better place"
S: "yes please James, don't make me ask again"
S: "Tony! I don't I have time for this"
I stuttered, on the brink of tears thinking I could have just died without telling Bucky one last time I loved him.
S: "I don't want to just survive, I want to live, live with you"
P: "yes and well I have to tell you, you are the braves and the stupidest man I have ever met"
S: "I need you inside me, Now!"
I woke up all sweaty, probably screaming because everyone was standing at my doorway, they all looked concerned and could I blame them this was the third time this month I had woken up like this, I told them I'm fine, I just had another nightmare, they told me I should talk to a psychologist but I can't, I won't tell anyone about Bucky and myself even if homosexuality is legal now, it wasn't legal back then.
S: "hey! Clint don't be an ass he's right"
T: "yea, yea sorry, it's not like I pay for all this or anything you could just make a new one Clint"
“Something on your base is pulling half the juice out of the power grid. We came to see if you needed any help.” Dugan raises an eyebrow at Steve.
“Mmm-hmm, that’s nice JARVIS.” Tony’s breath is a tickle on his jaw.

She breathes a sigh of relief on finding it empty but still tiptoes through, her skin alive to any shift in the air that could mean she wasn’t alone. She pauses when passing the TV room. Somebody was snoring, it was Steve stretched out from the corner of the couch, with one hand resting across his chest and the other wrapped protectively around Tony who was curled into his side scrunching his face up in his sleep and clinging to him. “I could have told you

Her companion cleared her throat abruptly. “If I do this,” She hesitated, only slightly, but Natasha picked it up and looked around to find herself under her scrutiny.
He paces, restless by the door a while longer, listening for the tell-tale whur of electrics starting up; before he gives up heading to his room. Tony was home, Tony was safe. He could at least get some sleep.
“What?”
“Sure, Tony… Sure I’ll come home.” He pauses waiting for Tony to look up.
So go on, why her,

Tony can’t resist, a slight shift of his hips and a tense of muscles and he watches Steve double over.
He feels himself losing control, the handle he had on whatever was telling him to savor every moment and take it slow slips and he bucks his hips up making Tony cry out.
“Besides, I have something that belongs to him,” she strikes the pin on the edge of the desk closing one eye and tilting her head to the side to catch the frequency it resonates at. Skippy twitches his large elongated ears and does the same.

Only to have it lost in his throat. It has him waking up at 2 am, like clockwork, downing the water that’s on his sideboard and wondering what it all meant. The whole Bucky/Winter Soldier situation was still raw, and he
Tony starts to breathe a little easier, the shaking starts to subside, he stops clawing at his chest and brings his hands up to circle Steve’s wrist, keeping a loose hold.
Somebody says, “Should we check on Steve?” Tony’s eyes flare with panic as their teammates’ shadows pause outside. Steve stomach drops, he’s still holding Tony in his lap covered in cum and filth and he doesn’t remember locking the door.
Tony crawls back up, ghosting his lips and hands over Steve’s pliant body, letting his cock brush against his thighs and rest on his stomach.
Tony goes quiet, dropping his shoulders and leaning on an upturned palm. He draws a pattern on the worktop from the condensation of his glass muttering, “Because you’re so perfect,” and pulling a face.
“It’s not going to get me drunk,” He smiles, letting his eyes slide closed at Tony’s fingertips running down his thighs then back up the inside trailing along the red skin in the crease of his groin where his pants had been chafing. Steve jolts at the touch, almost sloshing champagne onto the bathroom floor, but he lets Tony have his way.

Steve says sensing the shift in mood that signaled the end of whatever they were trying to achieve here, “What are SHIELD files doing in a warehouse belonging to Howard?” He looks over at Tony whose expression is waxy and pale.
“So, what’s this thing on the monitor?” Tony jumps at the chance to steer the conversation away from broken hearts, feelings and somebody dropping the inevitable ‘There’s plenty more fish in the sea’ cliché.
Or a way back?

He knows the looks he’ll get if he goes upstairs. Two-day-old t-shirt, snot of the sleeve and ominous vomit splatter down the front adding to the menagerie of stains, jeans that are falling past his hips because eating didn’t seem all that important anymore. It’ll be the pitying look of ‘poor Tony, betrayed by his friend
Steve gasps, it’s too much, Tony’s hand is slipping in the sudden wetness and Steve holds onto him for dear life, bucking unevenly - his jaw clenched so tight he thinks he might break a tooth. Tony’s still pulsing- planting frantic sloppy kisses on his neck, his grip tightening giving friction and pressure where Steve needs it most until he’s coming too; clinging to Tony whose fetched up against his chest, grabbing fistfuls of his silk waistcoat,
fiction with each upward push.
Natasha’s long gone and he’s relieved, guilty and a little bit empty to find that Tony is nowhere to be seen.
It turns into a full-blown fit of giggles and Steve takes a step back. Staring in bewilderment at a very golden Tony still wearing the under sheath of the suit (leaving
Steve says a little louder than he means to and raking a hand through his hair. “I’m happy that you’re talking, but this.” He waves from the tablet to the tumbler then to Tony, “This isn’t going to help the situation.” He pauses long enough to give Tony a pained expression. “Look there’s a team investigating, we won’t know anything until morning, and drinking is not going to help. Jesus Tony, I sat with you whilst you had a
. I have a lot of work to do,” he says with his back turned.
Tony watches him, bracing with both hands against the edge of the workbench, his eyes blown so wide that his irises are barely slivers in the overhead fluorescent. It’s the way Tony flinches, the twitch of his bare skin against Steve’s slow exhale, that raw reaction from Tony, usually wrapped in something expensive and now
It meant that he tuned into most sounds background or otherwise without realizing; it also meant that Steve could recognize the people he spent a lot of time with by their footfall or certain noises they made out of habit.
Tony falls out of rhythm; squeezes him a bit too tight around his waist. He buries himself deep and comes with a rough shout, but still doesn’t stop, he wrings the feeling dry. Steve is still pulsing, still full of Tony all he wants to do is collapse.
The door has barely latched before Steve’s pinned Tony against it, kissing him like his life depends on it and thumping his head against the wood.
“Natasha tells me she can help,
“What has that got to do with anything?” Natasha says and finds herself smiling.
applauds them with an encore of fireworks erupting from the street below.
He moves the plate back into Steve’s reach, leaning in to kiss him soft and sweet, “well, you’ve got me there… I really do.”
“All I see is grainy security footage, send them my card. Maybe we can kit them out with something that will show them more than just a few pixels.
Steve can’t stop the unexpected rush of air that escapes his lungs and the sudden urge that shoots down his body making him double over and dash to his room.
that tonight his tongue is going to spend more time in Steve’s mouth than his own.
“You could have come to me, Steve,” Tony says the hostility dropping out of his voice so he sounds more exacerbated than angry, “we could have..
Tony replied as the door slammed shut between them; locking Steve out. Leaving him standing with his face inches from the metal, he balled a fist and pulled back an elbow with half a mind to slam it straight into the door peeling it open like the lid of a sardine can. It’s the thought that he might get shot with one of Tony’s repulsors that stopped him short; he knows how jumpy he’d been since New York, and it’s not like Steve even knew what he would say to him.
Tony looks sated, a lopsided grin on his face and a glow on his cheeks. He glances down and Steve follows his line of sight suddenly realizing what was sticking them together. Tony’s painted both of them from chest to stomach in stripes of white. He shrugs cheekily, “It’s been a while.”  It’s the last thing Steve sees before the remaining candles flicker and die.
“I can’t just leave this alone Nat. It’s…
Steve sighs, “I’ve never been much of a liar,” he goes to put his hands in his pockets and suddenly remember he’s standing in his shorts, “I really should…” He trails off.
is ever going to compare to the first time he kissed Tony Stark. The way he goes ridged then melts against his chest, gauntleted hands that slide around his waist and pull their hips together. The slight smile he feels curl on the edges of Tony’s mouth before he lets him in. The way their teeth catch because neither can get close enough.
His secret world he had built with Steve lay in ruins. He put a wall up brick by brick to keep himself strong, to block it out, now he can feel it collapsing, taking him down with it until he’s curled under his desk, knees pulled up to his chest.
like they both needed it to live. He thrusts his hips and Tony’s right there to return the favor, there’s no friction, just the smooth glance of skin on skin that makes Tony arch and groan.
he doesn’t manage the rest before he comes; waves of white-hot pleasure rip through him, blowing his mind and his load all over the silk sheets; his body starts to go slack and he's still reeling; still groaning like a whore and Tony’s
“I don’t,” She hears Sam pause behind her.
Had anybody of been watching it would have looked like a perfectly timed movie kiss. Captain America and Iron Man against a backdrop of the New York skyline whilst fireworks explode overhead- they don’t have anything on the fireworks that go off in Steve’s brain when they pull apart and Tony utters one-breathless-word-

The small sliver of iris that’s visible against his dilated pupils is an incandescent blue in the moonlight. “I found it.” He says breathless holding up the bottle and flushing with heat, feeling foolish that all it takes is looking into Steve’s eyes to make him swoon and

Mind telling me who
Tony’s not home by the time Steve decides to call it a night; the remainder of the day had been spent overlooking the witness reports from the security staff that Pepper had sent over. All the reports were consistent but vague, everybody interviewed gave the same story, they had seen something out the corner of their eye, but couldn’t be sure, then nothing-they had woken up a few hours later with a bad headache and a ringing in the ears. Natasha had sat with him for a bit to frown over the reports but was oddly unhelpful and dismissal of Steve’s theories.
“Somebody broke into one of Da-
Natasha watched her stuff her hands into the kangaroo pocket and scuff worn shoes on the grass. “You look…” She sighed taking in the twitching and eyes that darted around restlessly, the shoulders that drew up around her ears, the slight stoop in her posture in an effort to make herself smaller. Standing at least five foot eight she’d always had an inch or two on Natasha. “How’ve you been?” She eventually settled on.
Steve knows how to get a rise from him, he closes his eyes, he opens his mouth and when Tony touches the wet dripping fruit to his tongue he sucks his fingers in with it.
this was temporary. The whole thing and Tony was pissed
There’s no hesitation when Steve drags Tony half way down the bed and pulls him into position, he ends up with Steve slotted in between his thighs with his hands under his ass lifting him ever so slightly, fingertips just brushing the small of his back. He feels so open,
“I woke up with nobody, in a world
He knows all the places that make Tony twitch. He could find them blindfolded, the smooth patch behind his knee that makes him sigh, the inside of his thigh where he likes to feel stubble, on his neck where his tendons cord and the slightest pressure of lips makes him give out in Steve’s arms.
Natasha rolls her eyes and let her shoulders relax,
“I’m not telling you that Stark,”
You’ll do it?”
The movements lazy, soft fingertips trace the hard planes of his bare chest, the slightest hint of fingernails catching on his skin as he maps out Steve’s chiseled midriff before running it back up his sternum. There’s a jingle when his fingers find them, he stops with a half-muffled grunt of intrigue; taking the two oblong pieces of metal that were nestled in the dip of Steve’s well-defined torso in between his thumb and forefinger; his solider is wearing his dog tags.
“JARVIS, you’ve still got the data files from SHIELD, look her up,” Tony says to the AI without breaking his eye contact with Natasha.
He made his way back to the TV room relieved to see that Tony was still curled on the sofa where he had left him, only he’s nestled further into the warm spot that Steve had left behind with his hands tucked under his cheek, he shifts and groans in his sleep. And it shouldn’t,
“No-trust me,
The conversation drifts into a comfortable silence, Steve moves to get out,

Tony panics and rushes over to where Steve has retreated looking like he’s about to bolt. “It’s just… I can’t
Steve doesn’t mean to be rough, but restraint gets overwritten by lust and he grips onto Tony’s hips a little
“Tony, you disappeared. Nick Fury nearly cast a kitten! You turned off comms, sensors, you didn’t tell Pepper where you were going, she nearly bit her nails back to the knuckles for crying out loud! I was left holding the bag when we couldn’t find you!

Tony for them.”
Tony clicks his tongue when he spots the chafing on Steve’s neck and traces it with a finger then goes up on his tiptoes and follows the same line with his lips. Steve hums in contentment, the soft cool cotton of Tony’s shirt that he only just feels against his skin, the warmth from the candle flames, the careful hands that push and pull him out of his uniform lifts the weight of responsibility from his shoulders, fools him into thinking that maybe, just for a moment he can shut the world out and be Steve,
Steve feels himself blush, from his ears right the way to his toes. It doesn’t go unnoticed and Tony groans.

“I think we’re way-
He manages to breath out, covering Tony’s mouth with another desperate kiss as he laces a gloved hand through his hair making a soft cradle between him and the door. Steve pulls away.

JARVIS lights up the monitor off to the left, “Well sir, there was an artifact reported stolen from the Natural History Museum four months ago.”
“Bottom drawer.” It’s as good a ‘yes’ as any, he props himself up on his elbows watching the muscles on Steve’s back ripple and flex whilst rummaging through his bedside cabinet. He’s leering and it’s shameful what just looking does for him.
Sam responds; Natasha sees him out the corner of her eye giving the dog bed and Ilona a wide berth. Natasha was used to it, Ilona’s presence always had a way of making people uneasy, like the air fidgeted around her, even more so when her emotions were heightened.
He doesn’t waste any time, he rips his boots off, half hopping half running as he yanks his pants the rest of the way down and kicks them away.
.” The edges of his lips twitch into a smile.
JARVIS wouldn’t even tell us where you were..” Steve rakes a hand through his hair. Pent-up anger mixed with a dozen other emotions he’s too drained to place boils just underneath his skin, He hadn’t meant to raise his voice. Tony looks back at him bewildered and blank. Steve meets his eyes for the first time. Softening his tone to reluctant exasperation.
Tony’s waffling, he’s not even looking at Steve anymore. “They didn’t hurt anybody though, I’ve gotta get down there.” He turns and disappears before Steve can stop him.
Steve stands alone in the corridor reeling from the wake of his conversation with Natasha. Clenching his hands to fists out of nervous-frustrated habit, because it came back to Bucky. It always came back to Bucky and now there was someone else involved.
They stand in awkward silence, the atmosphere building to something thick with all the things that are going unsaid. Steve looks furious, every muscle in his jaw pulled taut as he glares down at his desk.
… It was just an old dusty warehouse; low risk but it still had cameras.” Steve hears the call end and guiltily steps into view.
Tony’s skin felt exactly like it had in the dream, smooth and soft, but with a delicious give under Steve's fingertips, his control starts to slip the higher his hands go shaking with the anticipation over flinching muscles.
“You spend-” Tony says his hands straying to the zipper of his pants, “-so much time looking after everybody else,” methodically working it loose, “I figured you needed a night off.” He tugs and has them at his ankles caught on his boots Steve hadn’t had a chance to take off. Tony drops his gaze down and grins from ear to ear at Steve’s briefs that jut out from his body, the fabric stretched obscenely tight, and says laughing, “Or maybe a night
“I was-” Tony tilts his jaw up and nibbles his lip thoughtfully looking for the right excuse that’s going to pull Steve away, if only he
“Please Tony,
The moment protracts, the clock keeps ticking and the fridge keeps humming but neither make a move.
He’s so keyed up that all it takes is three firm strokes and he’s coming, shuddering and gritting his teeth under the spray, curling his toes against the unyielding floor and throwing a hand out against the wall to steady himself as guilt, confusion and pleasure slip down the tiles in great splotches of white.
Tony says almost as breathless as he is, pushing him back with the flat of his palm, fumbling with his pants like he can’t remember how an elastic waistband works, Steve can’t stand it, can’t control himself and paws at the fabric until they end up pooled at Tony’s feet.
Tony gets a little bolder, leans further into the inches of space between them,
The one Cap’s looking for?”
Tony pants above him, his face twisted up into ecstasy, little beads of sweat trickling down his sternum and glistening in the candlelight. And he’s so tight,
Sighing, he relents to being awake and hauls himself out of bed, he’s wandered the tower at night a thousand times before.

She said snorting dirty laughter. “When I ran from SHIELD life wasn’t about living anymore. It was about
Steve rubs the bridge of his nose and shuts his eyes, “I didn’t mean it like that,” he mumbles.
He says grinning and punctuating his statement by tucking into another.
He stretches up until there’s barely an inch of space between their lips. It’s almost a kiss.
Natasha follows Sam’s gaze. The whole place is oppressive, looming over them and cutting a solid block out of the horizon. Unnecessarily complicated and messy electrical cables span the whole length of the street hanging overhead like mesh wire that’s going to fall down on top of them. Natasha sees him shudder and stuff his hands into his pockets. “This is the place.”
-it’s the possessive side of him that he’s never been proud of. He chokes on a gasp and catches Tony’s elbows in each hand when he strokes the outlined shape of his cock through his shorts.
Bringing Sam may have been a bad idea.

“Will do Nat.” He says returning the gesturing. He throws one more punch, just to see if the damn bag will split. It swings wild at the impact before wobbling to a stop. It doesn’t split, but his frustration has waned, possibly because he can feel his pulse in his knuckles, possibly because of his chat with Natasha, but he calls it for today.
happening?
He mumbles.
Waking up a little from the dreamy half-consciousness he had fallen into from the low light and the warmth and the fact he’d been on his feet most of the day. He can smell the strawberries already, carrying on the steam from the water, sweet and ripe, he leans his elbows on the edge of the bath and Tony feeds him the juiciest one from the top.
Steve kept finding his bed too big, his hands too empty and the nights too cold and lonely, he misses all the times he has woken to Tony curled against his back,
Tony hands are hot through the cotton and the friction of the fabric grazing over taut skin is something else, it lights every nerve on fire, his hips rock forward.
They’re pressed together so close he can’t exactly hide what’s quivering in his pants. He tries to tell himself it’s a perfectly natural reaction to touch…
