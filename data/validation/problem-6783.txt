“Yeah, but you don’t want too,” Steve said to him. “You don’t want to stop being Iron Man yet, either.”
"You're right, but you have a better imagination than me, that's for sure." Tony tapped his fingers along Peter's nose. "I've seen your drawings, you're pretty talented, kiddo."
"Tony?" No one had that right to sound that adorably sleepy under the age of ten. Tony turned to look at Steve. "Did you stay here all night?"
“Pepper Potts.” Tony stared at her as the car left the airstrip. She had taken Jamie from Steve, and Steve had his arm wrapped around Peter as he dozed lightly against his side. They had left the park after one more round of park hopping, and Peter guilting Steve back onto the Tower of Terror. “I know that look. Potts.”
He still held true to the fact that Steve's lips were soft, softer than they had any right to be, but there was always passion behind his kisses, a sense of purpose. Tony's lips were not nearly as soft, years of biting and licking out of habit while he worked, and even the months of torture in a cave had taken their toll on Tony's lips. He regularly pulled skin off, never regularly used chap stick, and he let them bleed sometimes if he pulled a little more than usual. It was all habit.
When they finally called it a day and headed for the emptying parking garage, Jamie was still Hyper while the boys were starting to run out of steam. The art fair had been full of games for the boys to play, and Steve had gotten a few ideas for some new art techniques he’d like to try. Steve noted that Tony looked a little lighter, not as stressed as he had since they had gotten back to the Tower. He resigned to making sure Tony got out of his workshop more often, to destress.
"Yeah, he's keeping an eye out on them." He glanced at Steve, noticing his shoulders were a little tense as he thought about his best-friend-turned-assassin downstairs. "I'm not gonna lie and say that it wasn't risky sending him out to go after Wilson-"
Tony licked his lips. "Well, I got some ice cream upstairs, leftover dinner, and nearly every movie known to man. I know I'll feel better being on the same floor as my son, and I think you're not getting any sleep either, so let's be crazy insomniacs in the same place."
“You have put a lot of work into this.” Tony smiled at him, pushing the tablet on the couch, and wrapped an arm around Steve’s neck. “I like when you’re prepared.”
Steve had managed to destroy a punching bag, specially made to withstand his strength, then went to take a shower. He was dressing in his quarters when there was a knock on the door. Fury was standing there, looking at him. "We found a match for Loki, in Stuttgart, Germany. You're up, Captain."
Tony looked up at it, blinking a little. “You know what, you need someone big next to you, holding onto you.” Steve’s head whipped around to look at him, already knowing where this was going. “You should take Mr Steve! He’s never been on that ride!”
"Tony?" Meg asked quietly. He looked over and saw her playing with the hem of her shirt. "Does it get easier? Digesting stuff like this?"
"I'm not happy with you," Tony said quietly, nodding a little, turning his back to Steve and Peter, so that at least Peter didn't hear anything more than mumbling. "And why didn't you tell me that this was the one who was there during the Incident."
“I have near perfect recollection, Tony,” Steve said with a fond little smile. Of course he knew how long it had been since Tony had visited his therapist. But since it was still under a two month period he hadn’t felt a need to start pestering Tony about scheduling another visit. Maybe now, though, would be a perfect time to get him back down there. Maybe it would help Tony get some sleep. “I think that it wouldn’t be a bad idea to go see Danielle. In fact, I think that the workshop should remain locked until you do go see her.”
"We'll have to get them talking soon, but we'll just keep an eye on them for now." Steve pulled his eyes away from Peter. "Tony should be up in a little bit, he has the stuff from the shooter...." Julie nodded tightly. "He's, he'll be up." She rubbed his arm a little. "I should get her a snack, try and get her to sleep soon," he said, moving his arms a little to indicate he was talking about Jamie. "Let me know if I can do anything, though."
"It's chaos out there," Tony said, gesturing towards the outside. "And if I can stop something from adding to that chaos, then things will go much better as we try to head back towards normalcy." Steve moved forward then, wrapping an arm around Tony's waist, lifting him up and moving backwards away from Rachel. Tony growled and tried to break free of Steve's hold, but the blonde pressed the phone to Tony's ear.
"We're going to be spending some time in the kitchen," Steve told him with a smile. "I want to start moving her up to more soft foods, see what she can handle."
“Necessary risk.” Tony rubbed his temples a little, and glanced over at the other side of the bed. Jamie was asleep between a sleeping Wade and Peter. The two boys didn’t want to leave Tony alone until they knew that he was going to be alright, specially after Steve had gotten him back in the car completely not conscious.
“The materials have been rated for different atmospheric pressures, different levels of gravity,” Tony rattled off. “Or,” he started to amend when he looked up at Steve’s expression, “for hypothesized space travel.”
"Yup, that's it, right there." Tony let out a slow breath. "Nothing big, probably stopped bleeding by now."
"Let's start with that stick of his," Steve spoke up again. "It may be magical," and what the hell, magic?, "but it works an awful lot like a Hydra weapon."
Walking in, Steve looked around, noting that the apartment wasn't as big as the one that Mary had, but it was bigger than what he used to live in back in Brooklyn. Everything felt vaguely familiar, the furniture looking vastly different from what Mary had. It reminded him of furniture he would see in the windows of the high end furniture stores in his time.
"I've known him for over a decade, that usually helps," Bruce added in. "My silent language with Tony is much different than the one that he has with Mary, or even with you." Steve hummed a little, nodding. "Tony, you can also use Sam as the Steve interpreter."
"Okay, well, first things first, you've been out for like, six weeks," Tony told her. "Most of your other injuries have healed, and I'm sure that Jarvis is monitoring your brain activity."
Tony got up, taking the ice pack off, slipping his watch back on. "Hey, I like it. Fabricate it, paint it. Don't wait up for me." Tony walked off, heading for his bedroom to get changed.
Steve could feel a fine tremble in Tony's hands as amber eyes opened to meet his. He must have heard Thor's words. "Hands on my shoulders, Tony." Tony nodded, slowly moving his hands up to grip Steve's shoulders. "I'm gonna do this slowly, I'm gonna get this off, alright? I'm sorry if it hurts." Tony rolled his eyes a little, a sign of 'Get on with it.' Steve took a couple of breaths and reached both his hands up to one side of Tony's face, feeling for a latch, and gently lifting it. Tony winced a little, but otherwise didn't move. He could hear the hard breaths coming from Tony's nose, his hands moving to the other side. The second latch was lifted, and Tony closed his eyes tightly. The gag hadn't just fallen right off, it was still clinging to Tony's mouth. Not Steve knew why Thor had said to remove it slowly.
Steve had never been so glad for Coulson's redesign to the suit. Loki hit hard, especially with that spear, but the suit was able to take and absorb some of the blows. It didn't take him long at all to jump back to his feet to react to the attacks. He didn't hold back anything. But neither did Loki. The music had been unexpected though.
Tony twitched his nose a little, seeing the little bit of vulnerability peeking through Mary's eyes. They'd known each other almost five years now, and Peter was always their first priority, but they had built a close bond over the years. She would usually call after hearing about Iron Man on the news, checking up on him. And after the press had died down, at least back to a normal level, where he could start to slip away again, he would come over to have dinner with her and Peter at least once a week, staying after Peter went to sleep just to talk.
"Yeah you do," Tony nodded, standing back up, hands resting on both boys head. "In fact, everyone is staying for dinner, and they're all upstairs."
That was what Tony had once said. It had all been a front, that's what Tony was good at, deceiving. He had turned it into an art form, out of necessity.
Steve leaned his head down slightly, Tony tilting his up. “I’d like that, too,” Steve barely whispered out. He moved his head, their lips brushing. Tony leaned in more, hand landing on Steve’s arm, pulling in a breath through his nose in surprise when Steve responded in kind. They both blushed, pulling away, when the cacophony of sound burst from the living room. Vee and her Gems, arc, and Brave, all letting out delighted shouts and calls before moving closer to the kitchen. The Gems started to dance around their feet, and Steve laughed as he pulled Tony closer so they didn’t trip over them.
“Of course, Captain Rogers,” the AI replied helpfully. “Taking into account the plans you have discussed with me, I have made a couple templates that I think would suit your thoughts.” The display by the wall of the shower tub combo lit up and Steve moved towards it. He looked over the different settings that Jarvis was proposing and nodded.
“Keep your eyes open Tony.” Steve slid his arm under Tony’s knees and lifted him up, the hand holding the shield at his back. “Need you to say awake until we get back to medical.”
"I do believe that Sir is having a panic attack, and regrettably I am unable to help him." Steve raised his eyebrows a little.
Unbeta'd as usual, and Marvel owns more than me. Songs and TV shows/Movies referenced don't belong to me either.
“Please don’t let her first word be sex,” Steve murmured, only loud enough for Tony and Bucky to hear.
"Yeah, I can see that. Shut it down Jarvis, I'll pull it out and we'll go into manual mode." He sat at the edge, peering down to see the top half of his suit leaning against one of the arms that would have taken the helmet. Tony sighed and leaned down into unit as Jarvis released control. He pushed the chest of the suit up, hearing the groan at the joints, then reached for the pin to lock them in place. He pushed the first one in, then reached for the second as there was a louder groan. A stripped wire sparked, dropping onto Tony's arm, and he shouted as he jolted back. The loose arm dropped against Tony's shoulder, the wire sliding against others, electricity flaring by his eyes.
"They were going to use her," Steve said carefully. In complete opposition to how the two men were acting, Jamie reached an arm out towards Bucky. "Her name is Jamie." Bucky looked back up at Steve.
The mans voice was easy on the ears, soothing, in a way that was different from Mary's. Mary had a soothing parent voice, but this man, it felt more personal than that. His tone was soft, but it wanted answers as well. "I'm,...." Tony looked around, and he saw the bed, saw the light coming from the bathroom. His bedroom. "Yes, I'm in my bedroom."
"You want me to put the hammer down?!" Thor was sounding a little mad, and Steve was on edge now. He grunted and suddenly jumped up, arm raised, aiming for Steve. Steve raised the hammer, steadying his pose and his grip, ready for impact.
"Okay, Daddy!" Peter grinned at him, which meant that Tony had to smile. Peter's smile more infectious than the common cold. Tony always thought that Peter's smile looked more like Mary's than his own. "Now, we should probably get back over to your place, and leave your neighbor here to his own day. I'm sure he has his own plans today."
"Just the things that you've done for Wade and I over the last year.... I don't know how to ever thank you, Tony." Tony tried not to squirm, uncomfortable, and unused to genuine praise from outside his close knit circle at the Tower. "The offer to live there-"
"It's from Phil," Peter said quietly, but loud enough that Tony jumped a little. They had been sitting in silence for several hours, and he hadn't been expecting peter to talk anytime soon. Tony glanced at Peter, then brought up the message.
"Fine, you're a den mother, happy? That makes you a wolf." Tony dropped down onto the couch, curling up against the arm.
“I’d hope not, because I just gave you an old fashioned date.” Steve smiled at him, letting his tongue peek out around the spoon.
"You're getting worse, Tony!" Steve shouted at him, making draw up short. Tony kept his back to the man as he continued. "You don't sleep, Tony, you barely eat. I can see the haunted look in your eyes. This isn't healthy. What happens if Peter-"
“They’re gonna try,” Steve said. “We told everyone so they could try and get the day off of work.” Tony took that as a sign that Steve had no idea on if the spy twins were gonna show up or not. A part of Tony thought that it was unfair to keep them in limbo like that, but he also wasn’t entirely in a stable state of mind at the moment. “But all of your friends from school are going to be there. It’ll be fun seeing them again, I bet. Uncle Rhodey said he was going to try and make it, too.”
"It's okay," Tony sussed, pressing his nose into Peter's hair, rubbing his back. "I'm here, I'm here now. There's no more bad guy to hurt you. I'm so sorry, so sorry, Peter," Tony whispered. Mary dabbed at her eye with the knuckle of her finger, but had a little smile on her face. They'd make do, they always had until now.
"You mean down in 'Former-Hydra' Central?" Tony snorted a little. "Yeah. Starting to think that I'm gonna need to add a second AI or something to try and help Jarvis out with all of this."
"You are cruel to me," Tony muttered, as he straightened back out into an adult, and finished his coffee.
“You’re welcome for information that you didn’t even have,” Tony shot back. “You’re also welcome for not putting out the word that your back, and calling for your brother.” Loki nearly hissed, and Tony didn’t try to stop the smile from crossing his lips. “Tensions are a little high in the building, if you hadn’t noticed, so I’m sure it will be no problem to get that word spread.”
"That sounds like the Steve Rogers approach to parenting. Anal Retentive Trying." Steve didn't try to keep his grin off his face that time. Bucky pushed his arm and stepped back. "Fine, we'll be up there. I'm not going to promise the safety of you other teammates though if they try to corner us again."
"I had figured as much," Mary responded in the same soft tone. "And normally, I would have stayed like that all night-"
"I don't like bullies." Tony's head whipped around at the new voice and he swore his jaw dropped. The man standing there was dressed in a ridiculous costume, but one that he knew all too well. And attached to his arm was a very familiar red, white, and blue shield with a star. The man threw the shield, hitting Vanko's suit in the head, causing him to stumble back, and the shield rebounded back to his arm, and he threw it again.
Steve helped Tony up, waited until he got his balance, then walked over to where Thor talking to someone. The blond turned and they saw a woman in long robes, dark skin and hair, but with light grey eyes. "Anthony, Steven, I introduce Arbiter Taleigh."
The announcement came barely five minutes into the meal, Peter hardly able to contain his excitement, forcing Mary and Coulson to tell everyone else in the room. Rachel and William were the most excited, Mary's mother checking the ring to see if it fit. Apparently it had been Rachel's great-great-grandmothers' ring, and it was passed down in the family to every generation. Phil had asked for it at Christmas time, asking their permission for Mary's hand in marriage. Tony kept a smile on his face as they ate, the sun sinking slowly. They all ended up bring desserts to fireworks.
Peter smiled at her then looked down at Jamie, who was babbling softly in his direction. He wrapped his arms around her middle then picked her up so she was still facing out towards the cameras, then nodded. “Yeah, she’s pretty smart like that. I taught her to be smart like that, though.” That pulled a laugh from both actors, and Steve bit his lip as he smiled before taking some pictures of them. He zoomed in on Peter and Jamie a bit, and knew that that picture would be making its way to his and Tony’s bedroom.
"Well, surprisingly it is." Tony held up his mug, clinking it together with Steve's orange juice. "I got more than four hours of sleep last night."
Up the elevator to the fifth floor, Tony nodded to the nurses at their station, and put his hands on top of Wade's head, steering him down the hall and around the corner. Julie's door was closed, and Tony knocked twice before pushing it open.
Tony put his arm down and let out a hollow laugh. "You think I don't do that already?" Steve frowned and Tony rolled his eyes. "Come on, Rogers, don't act like you’re surprised." Tony took a step back, shaking his head. "You know, you're really something. Here you are lecturing me about getting help, about nightmares and flashbacks, when you have them, too. Remember? I'm there when you can't sleep. What do you know-"
"You look better." Steve took the present he had and leaned it against the couch. "I didn't actually realize how much hair I had until they started cutting it off, and the ways to style my hair were drastically reduced."
Trigger warning: Flashbacks, nightmares, panic attack, talk of drowning, and some PTSD. I don't think it's too horrible, I try not to be too graphic with some stuff, cause I might accidentally trigger myself, but I'm putting it out there. I will summarize things up for people if some stuff gets too heavy, just let me know. The warning is still there.
"I'm also really good for it," Steve smirked, pressing a kiss to the corner of Tony's mouth. He froze then, pulling in a sharp breath after a distinct 'plop' sound. Tony was biting his lip, trying not to laugh as he watched the small dollop of fruit puree slide down Steve's neck. Jamie was smiling, her fingers in her mouth.
There was a beat of silence, Steve and Tony looking at Fury to explain. "Because of him." Fury pointed over at Thor, who looked stunned, muttering out a shocked 'What?'
“I didn’t bring my suit for a reason,” Steve watched him get undressed, raking his eyes up and down his body until Tony pulled the pants, and eventually the white shirt. “These pants, might be tighter than what I wore last year.”
"I've got the suit, just worry about finding out what the hell is going on." He paused a little. "Mary, who's the Winter Soldier?"
"Just a little bit more," Tony told him, pulling him up to his lap, wrapping him up in a hug. Peter wiggled a little, but he didn't fight to get away. "We'll still have boy time, and we'll still hang out in the workshop. That won't change." Tony bit his lip a little. "Maybe one day, she'll be like a little sister?" Peter whipped his head around to look at Tony with what should have been an adorable frown, but it was there, the wrinkle between his eyes. "Yeah, you're right, one thing at a time." He kissed Peter's head, holding onto him. "It's just going to be some adjustments, that's all."
"Your love for him is so deep," Loki mocked, jerking Peter, making him cry out and whimper. Tony jerked forward and Loki let out a laugh. "You'll end up like every other father, though. You'll end up like your own, neglecting your son until he hates you, drinking into oblivion, until eventually, you'll be a mere shadow of a man you actually thought you could be." Loki smiled, crazy coming off of him in waves. "The Chitauri are coming, nothing will change that. What have I to fear?"
"I'm on it," Tony said. He looked at Steve. "Meet me at Engine Three." Steve nodded and ran off, and Tony went for the suit.
"What about me?" Tony asked, looking over at the woman. "I stayed in my seat the whole time, and I didn't even speak up at the, 'Speak now, hold your peace' shtick."
Loki was sitting, and he had a new accessory, something over his mouth, that actually looked a little painful. If the glare he leveled at Thor was anything to go by, it must have been. Steve had walked in as well, and frowned a little when he saw the mouth piece. "Is that necessary?" Steve asked, glancing between Thor and Fury.
Mary teared up a little and hurried over to him, wrapping her free arm around his neck to hug him. He held back a wince and a hiss and hugged her back with one arm, his other hand reaching up to softly run through Peter's hair. He teared up a little himself, being this close to his son again.
"He's an expert in Gamma rays, that's how Fury wants to track the cube," Coulson explained. "We'd like you to help."
I will be posting something later on my tumblr about writing this chapter, and the next one, cause I started to really pour myself into it, and it got interesting.
“You’re forgetting to say the boys are quiet,” Steve corrected. “For some reason, those two get her riled up.”
"Going to put a new design on my freshly painted wall," Mary grumped a little, and Tony heard the disgruntled huff of Peter.
“The asshole had it coming!” Tony huffed with a pout. There were still a few lawsuits out there against George Hayes, and the press was still waiting for Tony’s big reveal about the relationship that he had promised them. He kept reassuring them that it would come, and that he hadn’t forgotten about it. He also praised them for putting in an effort when it came to Mini-Me.
"In a coma." Tony froze. Everything in his body just stopped working. Tony looked at Coulson, really looked at him, and he knew it was true. He could see the slight redness around Coulson's eyes, the worry lines pulling at the corner of his eyes, the tense stance. Oh gods.
"I could show you, if it would satisfy your curiosity." Tony turned a little to look at Loki when he suddenly moved. It was faster than anyone thought that he would be able at the moment, and in one second Loki had grabbed Tony's hands with his bound ones, slammed his hands up and smirked a bit when the gag latched onto Tony's face.
It may take me a while, but i do fully intend to go and respond to each and every one of you that left a comment. because i appreciate it, and I've so thankful. I still go with my mom almost everyday to her therapy sessions, so that I know how to help her when she is eventually discharged.
Tony made sure to stay far away from Rhodey when the game was over though, sticking next to Steve, who was smirking, just a little. “There’s only one way they could have tied that late in the game!” Rhodey had said, eyes slicing over to Tony who was already on his feet and picking up Jamie. Mary took the three kids to watch in the observation deck while everyone gathered in the training room. Clint and Natasha were already there, deciding they didn’t necessarily watch Captain America playing a game with a former Hydra assassin, and Bruce had arrived just a minute before the rest. Coulson had joined Mary and the kids, and Sam, Rhodey, and Bucky stood behind Steve and Tony, on the opposite side as Cling and Natasha. They seemed to only be missing Thor, but there had been no communication from him for a while.
"I'm glad I'm the one getting this call, then," Bruce said, and Tony could practically hear the eye roll. "So, why am I getting this call?"
The breath had been stolen from Steve's lungs at the news. She was alive, but in a coma. Her injuries were serious, so they didn't know how long until she woke up. Coulson didn't say it, but he knew the doctors had said it; If she woke up.
The day before Peter left to go to California, they had both caught sight of the metal armed man, (Mr Steve said his name was Bucky), in the living room, furniture pushed to the edges of the room, and he seemed to doing some kind of exercises. He had a couple of pieces of slim, polished, wood in his hands, and he was flipping them about, quietly going about some kind of routine. And then Miss Meg came out and then they were sparring, quietly since the twins were asleep. They were working on some fighting lessons.
"Not to your line, Sir." Oh. "Okay, okay, yeah, put it through, mute my line until we know who it is."
"I would just accept it, it's going to happen," Steve told her. She knew about Tony's penchant of setting people up with things that they needed, heard about it all the time from Steve, especially with everything that he had done, and was still doing, for the people of New York.
"Well, seems like Grandma and Grandpa had a Christmas party in the morning, so they were going to be gone all day tomorrow," Mary said, taking off her jacket.
Blue eyes closed, leaning against the fridge in the kitchen, taking a couple of deep and steady breaths. He was getting worked up over nothing. It was obvious that Tony was also interested, or else he wouldn't have taken the carefully crafted bait to kiss Steve outside of the gym.
"All the more reason to get her out." Tony rubbed his face with his hands. "I'm not part of one SHIELD's missions, Mary! And I don't want SHIELD getting involved in stuff they shouldn't know about!"
“It’s all yours,” Tony said with a little smirk. “Literally, she is all you. I didn’t realize just what I was getting myself into, but-“ He squawked and wiggled, almost painfully, when Steve poked his side. “You still have to learn how to do her hair if you’re not going to cut it.”
"Come along, little duckling, I shall teach you how to use a kitchen." Tony's expression deadpanned, grabbing some paper towels as a floor bot started to scrub the mess on the floor. "Pancakes aren't that hard."
Steve pursed his lips as he tried not to smile at the seriousness of Tony’s tone. “To turn on me? They’re not a coven.”
Tony let out an exaggerated sigh. “Yeah, I figured that was it. Peter is by far, more adorable than I am.” Amber eyes looked at Steve. “I have a confession. I had you move in so I could spend more time with Jamie. She’s far cuter than you are, Rogers. I need to raise a girl alongside my boy to make my life complete.” Steve snorted with laughter, and Tony couldn’t help but smile. “Stop being too good for me.”
"Because if we're going to have two bedrooms up there for the kids, then we need to have more room. With four of us up there, we'll need at least three bathrooms, specially with me, and when Jamie grows up." Tony looked at Steve, now with both eyebrows up. "Move in with me?" Tony rushed out. Steve blinked a couple of times at him. ".... Or not, just a suggestion. It's probably too fast though, and we've both just gotten back from some really big things. I'm probably really not thinking with a clear head, but I thought that you could paint a mural-"
"Depends on what kind of signals they've programmed in, but anything that gives off energy or power is going to shut down as soon as it enters the field." Tony zoomed in on the pictures, but he wasn't able to get any more details from that. "It can take down energy shields, disable tazers, most alarms, force-fields," he listed off.
They sat in silence for a couple minutes, Steve not letting go of Tony's hand, Tony not moving from his spot on the bed. "Do you wanna talk about it?" Tony asked gently. He wasn't going to begrudge the good Captain if he didn't want to share. Tony wasn't exactly the most open guy with his nightmares, and he assumed it would be the same with Steve.
"It's been an hour after lunch," Wade added in. Now that Steve looked at them, they were holding their hands behind their backs as well.
"She's never thought you were good enough for Mary and Peter," William corrected. "To be fair, no one will be good enough in her eyes, so don't take everything so personally."
“You’re getting lucky,” Pepper agreed. “I’m working with PR now to set up a statement for when the mainstream media does get a hold of this.”
"I felt the Universe move," Tony heard himself whisper, and that only seemed to make Steve smile a little wider.
“Steve!” The two men looked over as a red-headed woman walked over to him. “We missed you this week. There’s gonna be a bake-sale next week, and Brenda was hoping to get your name down on the list.” Her eyes slid over to Bucky and her smile perked up a bit more. “Who’s your handsome friend? I hope not your boyfriend?”
Steve never liked messages that requested his presence ‘most urgently.’ Especially not from the person that Tony had gone to visit. The text that came from Dr Strange had him moving immediately, with Jarvis contacting Mary’s parents to ask if they could watch the kids while he bee-lined it down to the garage to grab his bike. He passed by Tony’s car on the road before squeezing his bike into a parking spot closer to Strange’s residence.
"I'm not, but I thought you wanted to try and keep Peter and I out of the press?" Mary asked, knowing that Coulson was watching as they danced.
“James, apparently, since he’s denouncing his nickname.” Steve’s foot kicked into Bucky’s. “He was here to get the boys while I took my fella on a surprise get-a-way.” Izzie hummed a little, smiling at Bucky, who just quirked his eyebrow a little.
Steve was flipped over the mans shoulder and Tony moved forward with a thrust to his chest from the heel of his hand. His wrist was grabbed and Tony threw an elbow at his jaw, but the man deflected it. His armored hand free once again he grabbed onto the barrel of the gun, palm covering the opening as the man pulled the trigger. The vibration of the shot reverberated through his hand and he felt the bullet lodged in the workings of the repulsor, effectively shutting it down. His eyes widened as it occurred to him that the gun was at head level.
“I’m Sora!” Peter quickly claimed, turning on the couch to look at them. “From Kingdom Hearts! Wade wants to be Riku.” Steve’s brow drew together in confusion and he looked at Tony.
"I'm sorry, you're right," Tony nodded. "You're so smart Petey, remembering all the rules." Peter smiled, turned his little body to kiss Tony's cheek, making the man smile.
He threw himself to the ground, crawled over and pulled out his phone. Yes, it was late in the States, but all his mind wanted to do was call Mary, to talk to Peter. He started pressing buttons, stupid country codes, international calling, all the- -thunk-
Tony hummed, leaning in and smelling them. "Mmmm, they smell really good. But do you know what I really feel like eating?" Peter turned his head a little to look at Tony. "I feel like eating you!" Tony started to fake chew on Peter's ear. The little boy squealed and giggled, wiggling around, Tony's arms around him keeping him in his lap. Steve and Bruce chuckled as Tony made exaggerated eating noises, making Peter laugh louder.
"This," Steve touched the top of the leather bound book with two fingers. "The only thing that changed after reading this, was how strong I see you. What was planned for you, what they were doing, and to see where you are now? To be able to be here with you? That's what really matters."
Steve took Tony's hand as he stood back up, balancing Jamie on his hip, and kissed his knuckles. "It's probably just bad timing," Steve told him. "He doesn't know what happened, and he just got back from a vacation."
"I know that." Steve frowned. "It's not like I'm expecting to jump into something serious, because I don't think either of us is ready for that, yet." Natasha smirked at him, but didn't say anything. "I mean, not to say that I've been giving deep thought to anything, but it's not like I haven't given it any thought at all, but-"
“That’s the length of a Peter,” Tony said with a smirk. “But, still in your twenty’s, so still time to enjoy the little bits of life that aren’t dedicated to a kid.”
“No, just to pull Tony away from work,” Steve mumbled. He pushed himself up straight and walked into the living room. “Hey, babe.” He leaned over the couch and kissed Tony’s cheek, pulling his attention away from the tablet. “Can I interest you in a distraction?”
Tony closed his eyes tighter as he slowly came back to consciousness. He knew that he was in his own bed, back at the Tower, and it was still kind of early since Steve had woken him up to go down to the gym to get a run in, since he hated running in the snow. So why was Tony awake already if Steve wasn't the one waking him up?
"Confirm what I'm seeing," Bruce said quietly, but quickly to him. Tony frowned but looked down at the screen.
Tony grinned as it started to come together. He wrapped his hands around the small sphere, the atom, then threw them out, spreading his arms. The two scientists were bathed in a blue glow, Tony grinning. "J?"
“Yeah, specially since I’m sure that Bucky was about to start spoiling them,” Steve told him as he walked to the closet to find a shirt, too. “Specially Jamie. Apparently they’ve bonded. Continuing to bond as we speak.”
"Loud and clear, Captain. Engine three is down, we need Stark to get out there," Coulson said over the coms.
"Still doesn't-" Jamie started to softly giggle and Steve was able to pull the spoon back. "Oh, I see. How old do you think she is?"
“I couldn’t understand why he wanted to hurt us,” Wade continued. “I still don’t, but it doesn’t matter now. He went to go work at a big office, then went overseas, cause he was high up in the Army, and Mom got the courage to divorce him. We didn’t miss him, actually felt pretty relieved when he had to leave.” One of Wade’s fingers started to scratch at the jeans on his knee. “She got the papers back, and we moved. I wanted to stay in school with Peter, and asked my mom if there was a way that we could make that happen. We didn’t move too far away. And we hadn’t heard from him since then.”
"The altitude record for fixed wing flight is eighty-five thousand feet, sir," Jarvis told him, showing him the information on the screen as well.
“Jarvis,” Tony called out, rubbing his eyes with his palm. “Run names of passports entering the US within the last eight months, look for facial recognition on Hilda Mueller.” He saw another screen pop up, code flying across the screen as Jarvis accessed the TSA’s servers. “Also, just on a hunch, run facial on those entering into Germany in the last eight months.” What were the odds that she would return home?
“Traitor,” Tony mumbled, slouching a bit in his seat. “Alright, what happened after Star Wars,” Tony asked Peter and Wade, turning back to them. “Did you get to the castle?”
Steve nodded after a beat, then got up to follow Tony. They could tell as they got closer to the kitchen, the smell of food guiding them. It smelled like Bruce was also making some hash browns, and eggs for those who didn't want pancakes.
It was the little touches at first that broke through to Tony. The fingers tracing circles on the back of his neck, the soft motion of the other hand running up and down his spine, and as Tony shifted a little to get comfortable, Steve's leg was wrapping around his. A shiver ran through Tony's body then and he had to take a breath. It was a sudden sensory overload. Steve's breathing had been soft and measured, but could hear it, picking up just slightly, could hear his heart beat start to speed up. Tony could hear the muscles shifting in Steve's arms as he pulled Tony closer, moving him up further on his chest. He saw the fabric of Steve's shirt bunch minutely as Steve tilted his head down to kiss Tony, and that, Tony felt all of that.
The building started to rumble again, floor to ceiling, all shaking. The energy was building too much, too fast. She needed to get out. With a shout of pain she pushed herself up, running for the trucks. She could hear crackling behind her, cement starting to break up. There was one sedan, started, but the agent heading for the car had been caught in the crossfire of Barton and Hill. She slid in, gasping, and slammed the car into gear and raced down the tunnel.
Tony lifted his head a little and saw that Loki was looking at him, the back of his head still facing the others. Hazel eyes ticked over to see where Barton and Romanoff were standing, keeping their distance from Bucky, and then something clicked in his mind. Loki smirked a little, as if reading his mind.
“Well, it helps that we’ve already been outed, so we wouldn’t need to put on a disguise for the taping.” Tony let out a little moan and dropped his head back. “I haven’t put this much thought into this, in case you were wondering. We should try it some time.”
The song ended, and the woman shut off her radio, grabbing something from the car, and turning to open the door. As the door opened, she looked over, blinked, saw Steve looking at her, then smiled, cheeks flushing a little. "Judging by the look on your face, I can tell that you've been watching for a while."
On a side note, I've finished a rough outline for the rest of this story. Good news, Bad news. This story is probably at least half way done now, but there's going to be a part three. I fully intend on following Peter into his adventures as Spider-Man, because how is Tony Stark going to handle a teenager, a teenage superhero no less?!
“Which room, Daddy?” Peter said when he got to the end of the hall, looking between two wooden doors on either side of him. Tony pointed to the right, and he turned to read the sign then his eyes widened. “Awesome!”
"On one condition," Tony said as he got up from his seat. "I want more kisses tonight, cause dayumn son, is your skin soft." Steve gave him a confused, but amused, look. "I have a thing for soft skin."
“Sure are,” Tony answered easily, sunglasses fixed in place, hand resting on Peter’s head for a moment. “Stick by Mr Steve while I check us in, alright?”
"You've probably figured out that he wasn't under any orders by anyone to kill Tony, or yourself." She took a breath, putting a hand to her right side. "He found me again, a couple weeks ago, but dressed as he is now." Steve glanced over at his best friend, now standing at the foot of the bed, and sure enough he was in civilian clothes. The world didn't have the face of the Winter Soldier yet, so he was able to walk still relatively safe. "I've only seen him a couple times, when I go out with the twins."
"You got lucky with it!" Steve looked at her with what Tony called his Captain America eyes. Not the disappointed eyes, those were worse than Peter's Puppy eyes. "If anything, you probably just put yourself on his radar."
"That was impressive how you got that approved so fast after a disaster," George commented. Tony pushed him inside the door first before shutting it.
"That's what Ma used," Steve said as he double checked that he had put on the diaper right. Jamie was starting to kick her legs about as he fumbled a little. Tony smirked a little when he heard the Brooklyn accent pop a little. "It's what Buck's sister used, too."
“Daddy!” Peter gasped, tugging on Tony’s hand. “Tower of Terror!” He pointed up at the big building, the faint screams coming from other tourists inside. “Pleeeeease??”
My cats woke me up in the middle of the night to horrible sounds of killing each other, so you guys get an early morning chapter! (Everyone is alive, no worries. Boy cats. *eye roll*)
“We have to try and break the connection while we have him in this state,” Strange said, looking at the other sorcerer.
“If she thinks he’s the fun one, then she’ll want to go to him, instead of coming to me,” Tony said looking at him. He slid his hands up Steve’s chest, then gripped the collar of his shirt, pulling Steve in for a kiss. “I need to insert myself in her life as the one that she goes too when papa says No.” Steve’s expression deadpanned. “What? I’m the one Peter goes to when Mama says No, and you’re the one he’ll go to when Daddy says No.”
Tony flipped through the pages, seeing a drawing of Peter and Mary, one Peter and Tony, and one of all three of them together. Tony grinned when he saw a drawing of the red and gold armor of the Iron Man suit. He put his arm out, beckoning Peter closer. When the toddler was there Tony wrapped his arm Peter, pulling him into his chest and planting a kiss on the top of his head.
"I'm going to put nearly forty pounds of primarily water weight around you, then tell you take a walk in winter," she called through the bathroom door. "Your boy is crazy, Steve!"
And yeah, Tony had caught the end of what he could only assume was Steve's default 'Captain-America-speech' mode when he was coming back up from the workshop. He wasn't sure why the man would say any of those words about him, maybe because he owed them since Tony had thrown himself into a space wormhole.
“Aye,” Thor nodded. “I had recently defeated the enemy that had taken the power of the Aether, and was going to collect it myself, when Tony arrived. The Aether was weak, and I’m afraid it was attracted to the device that is in his chest that powers his heart, and it tried to take a new host.” Steve’s arms tightened minutely around Tony, and Tony batted at his shoulder with his bare hand. “I was able to extract, and contain the power.”
Steve nodded and let out a little sigh. "I still don't know nearly enough about what kind of father Howard was with Tony, but I know there are some deep seeded insecurities if he thinks the only way to do this is to keep a secret in the gym."
"Do you know when she might wake up?" Tony interrupted. Steve nudged his arm a little, and Tony gave a little apologetic wince to the Doc.
"You've foiled my plans!" Tony exaggerated his movements, trying to reach around Mary to get to Peter. "I can't tickle him anymore!" Peter was giggling, grinning, face red as he caught his breath. "I guess that means that we have to go eat breakfast. And then, was there something else?"
"Pierce wants him alive," the man said, taking a couple steps back. That was all the warning Tony had before one of the men in front of him fired another rocket. Tony fired from his gauntlet, stopping the first rocket, but was unable to get another shot off before the second one slammed into him. He was throw to the ground, rumbling over the concrete before slamming into a SUV. He fired the rockets on his boots to get him before he was hit with another rocket. When the HUD went dark he knew that this one had been a high powered EMP. "Get the suit off of him!"
Something larger hit the window and Jarvis turned on the sound so they could hear the loud ‘thunk’. “Someone is very insistent. What’s the threat level on this Jarvis?” Tony brought back the live footage, trying to find a trajectory for the objects.
"Miss Parker," Steve jumped a little at the british accent that came from the tablet, "I do apologize for interrupting, but I find it most urgent." Steve looked up at Mary who looked almost as surprised as he felt. She walked over and took the tablet from the table, giving an apologetic look to Steve, and set her bag by the closet.
"Jarvis asked me this morning for stuff for the birth certificate," Steve said quietly, continuing to feed her. "I don't know what to put for a birthday."
"And?" Tony walked over and helped Bruce take the top off the unopened crate. "Uncle Bruce, I do believe that we have work to do."
"Mary is a dirty blabber mouth." He pushed his feet into her lap now, using his usual pushy tactics to try and make her more comfortable. She grabbed a pillow and shoved it under his feet without touching them. "I don't actually know where I was going with this point, but try not to worry too much about it. Steve and I got this."
"To use you as an asset," Mary said, and Steve nodded once. "Well, that's the beauty of me being appointed your Handler. I get to do things at my discretion," Mary started to explain. "My way of thinking is, you're still human, still a man, and waking up after over six decades is going to be hard to process right away, hard to take in. Things have changed a lot for you, and I don't think that it will help you any if you're forced through anything, and don't have the proper time to digest." She shrugged a little, as if this was just something that should be done. "I'm a mother, so I know patience, and because of how Peter's father is something, I know a lot of coping skills," she said with a chuckle, and Steve became a little more curious about this man.
“Whoever got into my systems planted one nasty virus, tailored just for J, and about a dozen data mining bugs.” Steve frowned a little as he kept down and paced the wall, finding a spot, then easily vaulted over.
"It's not like I can't stop back over to my place to get some clothes." Tony's nose wrinkled a little, Peter really wanted to stay here, and apparently there was a reason, and going back over to the mansion wasn't like it was required. He could take Peter with him when he got his stuff, and they could say hi to Dummy, Butterfingers, and U, then. Those three bots honestly adored his little boy, and that always warmed his heart. Tony would just have to be careful, to always have his hat and sunglasses by the door, just in case. Not that he really planned on seeing anyone while they were there.
"Whoever did this must have been casing the building for a while," the red head said as she stood up from inspecting the missing window. "They knew that this wouldn't be regular glass, if they weren't thinking about breaking into one of the most dangerous buildings in the state."
"If you'll follow the lights in the ceiling, I can direct you to one, Dr Banner." A couple of the lights above the lab door started to flash, and Bruce followed them. Tony watched him go, and flopped down into one of the chairs by the crate. He closed his eyes and took a breath. He had been beginning to lose hope that Bruce would ever be able to make it, and that if he did he would be too late. There was still that possibility, but Tony wasn't going to give up yet, not just yet.
Tony chuckled a little. "You okay?" He looked around the gardens that they had fallen into, waiting for the rest of the drone to drop in.
"Never said it was a birthday present," Steve said with a little smirk. The little shit. "I did want to say, I'm sorry." Tony frowned. Why was he apologizing to Tony? "All those things I said, back on the Hellicarrier, none of them were warranted, or true, and-"
"Tony?" Tony and Bruce looked over at the end of the table, the other four looking at them now. Steve looked a little concerned. "What did you find Bruce?"
Steve frowned a little. Howard wouldn't have done that, would he? Not the Howard that Steve knew at least. But if Steve really thought about it, how well did he know Howard Stark? "He started to drink, a lot," Tony continued. "I never really had a close relationship with him, or one in general." Tony put the top back on the decanter, slowly putting it back, but didn't close the door on it. "Do you know how I met Bruce? It was by accident really. Bruce is older than me. I met him after I took over Stark Industries. He had waited to schedule a meeting with me, not wanting to meet with Obadiah, and now I really can't blame him." Steve could tell there was another story there. "He told me that Howard had been funding his research, the same research that turned him into the Hulk."
It was hard not to notice Tony as he turned, and Steve's eyes were drawn to his body as he turned, something curling in his gut when he watched Tony's ass, the fabric of his pants drawn tight against the skin. A faint heat crept up his neck and he felt like he should take a dunk in the pool. Except that the water wouldn't be nearly cold enough.
“Something I’ve heard from a British show, or something,” Tony said with a shrug. “How long do you think we’ll last before we’re calling for a video chat with the kids?”
"Well, I mean, yeah," Steve nodded. "Sure, there are some things that we have to discuss. A lot has happened in the past week alone, but-"
"Mmmmm," Tony hummed, carefully looking down the line of kids. Towels had been thrown on a chair so they didn't get too wet. "I think I'll take, those two!" He pointed the nozzles at Peter and Wade and quickly shot them with water. They both squealed and wiggled around, Tony following them with the hoses, cackling loudly. The rest of the kids erupted in shouts and laughter, also yelping a bit when they were also hosed off.
Steve quickly followed Tony, the smaller man moving quickly. "Tony." He didn't stop at his name, kept moving. "Tony," Steve said, this time reaching out and taking a gentle hold of Tony's upper arm. He turned around quickly, looking at Steve with wide eyes, his other hand reaching up, but then resting on Steve's wrist. "If you need to talk-"
Tony shuffled into the building, Ruby by his side. It was late, he was tired, and he wanted to dive into his bed and have his girls smother him. The worst part of traveling was that he was unable to sleep on a plane, and he had gotten onto a plane after the last business meeting, meaning he had been up for more 24 hours. What Tony hadn’t been expecting was the giant fluff of an Arcanine, and the streamlined sleeping version of a Braviary in his living room.
Tony turned his head a little, to glance back out into the living room. Eleven curious pokemon were still watching them. For some reason Tony felt himself blushing a little. When he looked back over, Steve had moved closer to him. Tony swallowed, letting his arms down slowly, but not moving away. “Um, I don’t, uh, don’t mind if you want to spend time with them…. Vee does it….”
"Some, yeah, he wanted me too." She wrinkled her nose a little and looked over at Bucky. "Report." All eyes were on Bucky now.
"Just Steve is fine," he smiled at her. "It's nice to see you here, too. I hear you'll be around more often." He sat Jamie on the ground, on her back at first, and watched her roll herself over onto her stomach.
“No superheroes,” this time she did let herself smile, but Tony knew that it was because of her next comment. “But I have treated other celebrities.”
"We iced up, Jarvis!" He shouted, waiting to see the blue light up again in his eyes. "Deploy flaps!" He waited another half a second. "Jarvis!!" He was falling, and falling fast, a weighted down hunk of metal in the air. "Come, we gotta break the ice!" He wasn't sure if he was talking to himself, or to the unresponsive Jarvis, but it was something that needed to happen. He reached one hand down, dragging his finger across the leg of the suit, waiting for his fingers to fall into the divot of the manual release.
Tony looked at her for a minute, then nodded a couple times and took back the papers. "Alright, seems we have a deal then." He folded the papers back into the envelope. "We'll this ball rolling this week, there's a notary in the building, and my lawyers will have all the details worked out."
Steve kissed Tony’s knuckles. “We’ll find someone, babe,” Steve said quietly. “It’ll be alright.” Tony nodded a little, hand tightening around Steve’s.
"Peter doesn't get to see his Dad that often?" Steve couldn't help the curiosity flowing through him, and apparently, out of his mouth in the form of words.
"Daddy! Come look!" Peter called from the living room, and the older Stark was turning on his foot obediently. He opened his mouth then stopped when he saw Peter sitting on the couch, arms squarely around the little baby boy, and sitting next to him was Steve with a baby girl in his arms.
Because I had so much fun with this chapter, Birthday part 2 might be posted on Thursday, or Wednesday. It's super fun what I have planned, and they deserve it!
.' She stood up, looking for him now, forgetting that she playing into the scene. "Then you're off your chair, in one exquisite movement, wondering, searching, sniffing the wind like a dapple deer." Mary noticed that Phil was dancing with her mother on the dance floor, a little familiar smirk on his lips. He had even helped! Mary decided to go with it, moving towards the dance floor, other couples still there.
"Records are made to be broken," Tony grinned,, putting all the thrust into the boots. He watched the altimeter on the screen, and just kept going straight up. "Come on!" He would make it, make it to ninety thousand or more.
"Get to the parking lot, run there. Now." Tony said, trying to keep his voice as calm as possible for her. "Jarvis, first car that you can lock on to, unlock it, start it, and get her into it." The AI confirmed, showing Tony which car he had triggered on the screen. Back on the camera feed, Tony could see that the two women were up and had fired their guns up into the air, the crowd scattering. There were a few hero wannabes though, and Tony closed the screen as he saw the pistols being aimed. She wouldn't need to know about that if something happened. There was nothing they could do right now.
Steve was sitting close to the kid, hand on his shoulder, giving it a little squeeze. “I just,” Wade pressed his lips together a little. “I don’t feel bad.” He looked over at Steve. “I don’t feel bad at all for being responsible for his death. For killing him. Does that make me a bad person?”
There was a knock at the connecting door in their hotel room, and Steve could hear Rachel telling them they had to change clothes. "We gotta get ready now, Mr Steve. We're going to get some dinner, and we're gonna be eating with Winnie the Pooh." Wade was already scrambling off the bed, but Peter sat up. "Tell Daddy I said Hi, and that I miss him. I miss you, too."
Even the kiss had been amazing, and Tony had kissed a lot of people in his time. The two kisses with Steve had been so much better than any kiss he had had with George, and that had been Tony's latest, and rare, attempt at something serious.
"No kill order has been issued," Bucky murmured, sounding more soldier than human. Tony watched him out of the corner of his eye, picking up Jamie to burp her. Steve looked at Meg. They all saw the blank look come over his face, ready to assume a new mission.
Steve looked at Tony, surprised, then glanced back at the Hulk behind him, who was looking at Peter with much curiosity. He wanted to trust that Bruce wouldn't let Hulk do anything to hurt Peter, but he didn't know how much control Bruce really had over him. He changed on his own, sure, but he was sure that the Hulk wanted to break out anyway.
He turned around, slipping out of the chair when he heard the workshop doors opening and he smiled. Steve had trimmed his beard a bit closer to his face, not nearly as full as a couple weeks ago on their vacation, but it wasn’t completely gone either. Steve was holding onto it as long as he could. He had Jamie balanced on his hip with one arm, and a tray with food balanced in his other hand. Jarvis had swung the door open for them.
The explosions should have been tracked, the military should have been able to see them; he had made enough of a ruckus during his escape. Now he had to just keep walking, to make himself visible from the air, to be seen, to-
"You don't know that." Tony opened his eyes, looking ahead, feeling Steve behind him. "Used to be a time that I couldn't even get function without alcohol. Who knows, maybe I'll be better if I go back to that." Steve's hand squeezed his right, his left resting on top of Tony's now, but not trying to pull away from the decanter. "Won't have to think, that's for sure, won't have nightmares because my brain will too busy drowning itself with too much activity, or maybe too little, I'm not really sure."
Construction on Tony’s, and now Steve’s, Penthouse had started when they left for California. Since getting back they had temporarily relocated down to Steve’s former floor, that seemed to be becoming Sam Wilson’s floor when he was in town. The floor just above Tony’s workshop was also being worked on, but Tony was hoping to keep that secret from Steve at the moment. He was turning it in the Studio that he had mentioned to Steve a month ago. Construction in the Penthouse was coming to an end though, just finishing touches on the floors and coats of paint were going up. Steve had insisted that they go out to some furniture stores in the next couple days, because he refused to all the shopping online, much to Tony’s chagrin.
“And it’s a lot of sugar for her,” Steve told him, eyes narrowing slightly when Wade shuffled forward. “She’ll never go to sleep.”
The humvee behind him, that's where Rhodey was. "Rhodey!" He screamed, keeping his back against the truck. "Rhodey!!" Rhodey would make sure that he got back home, that he got back to seeing Peter.
"I'm sorry," Tony said quietly. Here he was, running away, from Mary, from Peter. Rachel had her right to berate Tony, he wouldn't be surprised if they demanded to take Mary back to California, and Peter with them.
"I want you to know though, that if you have any questions, you can ask me," Mary told him. "At any time, I don't even care if it's three in the morning. I'm going to help you learn the new tech of this time period, and the new cultural and social norms."
Thor ripped off the gold faceplate as Steve dropped to his knees. "Is he breathing?" He practically whispered. He couldn't see anything with the suit around Tony, couldn't see his chest, couldn't feel for a heartbeat. Steve put his hand on the suit, and paled a little, seeing no blue glow. Could he rip the chest plate off to give him CPR? Could he do it without breaking Tony's ribs completely?
Tony hummed, annoyed, mostly with himself. "Yes, I'm starting to sense a theme in life," he muttered under his breath. "Thanks, William. If he wakes up before I get back, tell him I'll be here soon, just making sure that Meg gets settled. Can't be sending her back off to the hospital."
"I could always help you," Steve offered and Peter grinned. Tony opened the door a little for Steve, the silent invitation. "Why are you making cupcakes?"
Tony frowned when he saw the sixth and seventh song appear, then the songs ended. A knot started to form in Tony's gut. "I already added that song, to the other playlist. Jarvis, who has access to this playlist?"
"That's great." Tony turned when Mary interrupted him and saw that she was already moving to take a seat by the couch.
"She showed me some ideas she drew for sculptures," Peter told him. "She said I could watch her work on it, when she started."
Strange lifted an eyebrow at him, stopping just at the bottom of the steps, a gap still between the two men. Tony had pushed his hands into his jacket pockets. “And last I remembered, you were well on your way to drinking yourself into an early grave. I’m sure there were some drugs involved, as well. I thought for sure that I would see you end up on a table in front of me.” Tony nose twitched a little.
Tony held out his hand, asking permission to use the pen, and Steve put it in his palm, smirking a little internally. Did this count as handing something to Tony, again? Tony held out his arm and placed the top of the pen to his shirt. The rectangle on the pen lit up, showing the color of Tony's shirt, and the tip of the pen clicked out. "You now have the color of my shirt at your use." Tony grinned at the pen. He placed the end against Steve's skin, and the screen lit up again, changing to his skin color.
Steve's breath caught in his throat, the cold in his stomach knotting up, and he quickly covered Peter's eyes, much to the boys protest. Tony shot up into the sky a split second before everything was being fired at him.
Peter's Dad was sounding more and more like an absent father, and he wondered how Mary could be okay with this. Peter needed a constant male role model in his life, along with his mother. Steve had had Bucky's Dad, and Bucky himself to a point, and he was convinced that it had helped. He didn't want to see Peter slip down the slippery slope of becoming a bully, or becoming a lost, or rebellious teen. From their short meeting, he knew that Peter had potential to be anything.
“Ah, of course,” she nodded and put them down on the arm of the chair, along with a pen, and went to her notepad, unfazed. “You can call me Danielle if you’d like. What would you like me to call you?”
He reached out for the door handle, there was someone important inside the car, someone he needed to keep safe. When the door opened, Tony stopped. There was no one inside. He straightened back up and turned around just as a sharp pain erupted in his chest. Tony gasped and his hands flew up to press at the pain source, face crumpling when he pulled back his hands to see them covered in red. Looking down at his shirt, it was quickly stained with blood.
“Actually, Bucky was the one to introduce me to the wonder of sci-fi,” Steve spoke up, and Tony grinned at Pepper. “The little stories written in the magazines, we’d pool our money together once a month to pick one up. They were swell,” he said with a smile, then winced a little when Tony’s head whipped back around to look at him. “It slipped-“
Mary grabbed Tony's shoulder again, this time squeezing it a bit. "Getting real tired of not being able to sleep," he confessed to her. "But, world keeps spinning, things keep moving, and in the end, I still have a job to do."
"Oh, it's beautiful," Stane breathed. "Tony, this is your Ninth Symphony. What a masterpiece, look at that." Stane dropped down onto the couch, between him and Peter. "A new generation of weapons with this at its heart. This is your legacy." Stane smirked a little, then reached over, pulling Peter up by his arm and into his lap. He could see that Peter was unconscious, a little trail of blood that had come from his ear, but he was still breathing, still alive. "Or, is this your legacy? This brat, that you've tried to hide, all too well, from everyone, from me. Well, he certainly looks like you, I'll give you that."
"But she doesn't get better," Wade said. Peter seemed to burrow into Wade's side a little more, wrapping the big blanket around them tighter. Tony came out with a platter of a mugs, setting them down on the coffee table. He glanced at them and raised an eyebrow. "I was telling Mr Steve that my Mom is sick with cancer." Tony's eyes widened a little.
"Tomorrow, bud," Tony said, reaching over to mess up Peter's hair. "If we start it now, it'll go past your bed time."
“You know he totally likes her now,” Tony said, looking at the ceiling, putting his hands behind his head. “Maybe not completely, but he doesn’t scorn her anymore.”
"I went to go see Wade's mom," Tony said, looking over at Steve. He was actually feeling kind of comfortable, even with someone sleeping on his chest. "Remember when I told Wade I'd ask her to reconsider moving in?" Steve nodded. "Well, I got her to say yes. She should be moving in a lot of their stuff right now. It'll probably take another couple days to get everything in, but, it's a start."
“Thanks,” he gave her a nod, before turning back towards Steve. The blonde got up from his seat, giving a polite nod to Dr Cavanaugh, and slipping his arm around Tony’s waist. He pressed a little closer to Steve, and there was a sense of calmness around him. Steve really hated that they’d have to break that when they got back home.
“But, she will start crying soon,” Wade warned as Jamie let out a third, longer, whine when she couldn’t move Bucky’s leg. “I really don’t think you want that.”
Steve looked back at Tony when he heard a couple of faint wheezing sounds. He was trying to catch his breath now, trying to pull it in. This was something that Steve was familiar with. Bucky would wake up with nightmares sometimes during the war. None of the Commandos would say anything, and Steve was always there for him.
Steve looked at Natasha as she walked out and he followed her down the hall a bit. "That doesn't count as a talk, just so you know," Steve said to her.
"So, full disclosure," Tony started, "Agent and Mary are dating, relatively seriously, too." The Doctor glanced at Steve for a second, and he just motioned between to Coulson's room. Steve was actually a little happy to hear Tony going back to calling Coulson by his ridiculous nickname. "As soon as he wakes up, he's gonna wanna go see his lady love, so what are the chances that he can move from the bed?"
"This is completely unfair," Tony uttered, putting his hands up in defense. "Your numbers are starting to increase, and it's not fair to the boys in the Tower." The three women looked at him, and he gulped a little. "It's like being hunted by velociraptors," he whispered to himself. "Oh look! A car!" He breathed out when he saw a car pulling up to the curb. It was one of the company cars, so it seemed that Meg had probably talked to Jarvis so she could leave as soon as possible to get back.
"There's my Petey," Tony said, pressing his face into Peter's hair. He had his little boy in his arms, he was safe, unhurt, in one piece. That's all Tony needed. He could be content in life with Peter in his arms. He felt Peter shrink a little in his arms, growing shy at something, and Tony lifted his head. Peter was looking behind him, and when Tony turned his head, he saw Steve, and the Hulk still standing there.
“He needs to rest,” Strange spoke up, and Steve looked at him, briefly forgetting that he was there.
"I did, but she was pretty insistent that she was ready to return back home, and, I quote, 'Couldn't be bothered to wait another second.'" Tony snorted softly. "I do believe that Sergeant Barnes is shadowing her vehicle."
“I am indeed operational, Captain,” Jarvis responded in his ear instead of Tony. “I’m afraid that Sir is still working on restoring the communications system inside of the Tower. If you could capture the image of the vehicle with your phone, I shall immediately start following the trail through all available street surveillance.”
"Kind of been wondering the same thing about you," Tony said without tearing his eyes away from the monitor. There, almost in.
"Well, it just seems a bit easier for a couple of reasons." Steve settled back to lean on his elbows, eyes always on Jamie. "We're still not exactly sure how she ages, physically and mentally, with the Serum, and Tony and I talked about it, and we really shouldn't have her birthday come before Peter's." Bruce raised an eyebrow. "He's not Jamie's biggest fan right now, and while I'm confident that that will change eventually, I'm really not going to be taking any chances. If there's something that I can handle in this big mess of life at the moment, it's making sure that Peter doesn't think we're going to start ignoring him, or stop loving him."
Tony knocked on Mary's door, trying his damnedest not to look behind him where he knew The Neighbor's door to be. He wasn't sure if the man was home, but he didn't want anymore awkward encounters. Since Valentine's Day he had seen Steve six more times, and all but two had been with Peter. He and Steve had practically run into each other when Steve was coming back from his morning jog. Tony was forced to be up early for a meeting with Pepper, and he told Mary that he could take Peter to school. As he got out of his car, not only did he almost hit Steve with the door, he stepped out and almost face planted into the taller mans chest. (Not that he would have minded, for a few seconds at least.)
"-and you wouldn't want your son to see anymore violence." As George lifted a second finger, Tony felt like he had just been slapped with it. George grinned, but it wasn't a pleasant one, it was a shark that had gotten its prey. He reached into his pocket and pulled out some folded up papers, handing them to Tony.
"Good, bring up surveillance of Peter's room," Tony said as a small rectangle appeared in the corner of the screen. He could see Peter sleeping his bed. "Alert me if he's about to wake up. What are the cell towers looking like? I have a call to make."
A familiar, and not always welcome, warm tingle swept through his body, up to his nose and eyes, and he tried to push back the tears. “Vee, Vee, Vee.” She licked his face all over before jumping back down to go back to the Gems. Tony let out a breath, a wobbly smile as he watched them all, a complete group again. For the time being.
“He sleeps weirdly in a bed, too,” Steve said softly. “It’s Tony’s hip that I’m going to be concerned about later. Jarvis? Did you get a picture of this?” The lights dimmed softly in response and Steve nodded. “Thanks, Buck, I got this from here.” Bucky rolled his eyes a little and clapped a hand on Steve’s shoulder before heading back for the elevator.
"Fuck! Mary, holy fuck!" He moved closer to her, hands hovering but not touching yet. "Shit, uh, how's your breathing? Are you in pain? Should I move? Uh-"
“He’s down with Mary, with Wade. They’re doing their schoolwork.” Tony relaxed a little bit. “His birthday isn’t until tomorrow, you didn’t miss it.”
She just smiled at Tony, then shook her head. "I'm sorry, I don't. We're keeping a close eye on brain wave activities, looking for swelling, but sometimes the body just does what it wants to do. I know that isn't the answer that you were hoping for, but I can be positive that she will wake up." Tony let out a little sigh and nodded. "I can give you good news on Mr Coulson, though." Both Tony and Steve perked a little bit at that. "We're going to bring him back to the waking world tomorrow afternoon if all our tests come back positively."
"I know," Tony said with a small smile. He leaned in again, capturing Steve's lips, sliding his hand up Steve's arm and to the back of his neck. "Why do you think I'm kissing you in my workshop? Nothing ever stays here, at least not for long." Steve smiled and kissed Tony again, drawing a moan from the genius.
"I've currently managed to contain him inside of his room, but I'm sure that he'll be out in mere moments once he realizes the doors are locked." Steve wondered about this Jarvis actually being a robot.
"Yeah, but you have no intention of having this conversation at all, do you?" Natasha guessed and Tony wrinkled his nose up. "So might as well have it with me." Tony wasn't looking at her, and missed the pointed look out the door. "Do you regret it?" She asked again.
Tony took an invisible breath. He knew the question would be coming, told himself not to think about the actual event while up there. "I can tell you that the attackers were repelled and defeated. I was just one small piece to the team that took on the threat. There are many fine men and women of the police force, and the firefighters, and hospitals, that put their lives on the line to help. We would not have been able to accomplish what we did without them, and I thank them, and honor their fallen numbers."
"We have no quarrel with your people," Fury spoke up, bringing the attention back to him. Glancing around, she could see that Fury was stalling, but stalling for what?
Tony shuffled out to the kitchen, hitting the button to start his coffee maker and pulled open the fridge. Sometimes he felt like the little old ladies who had a dozen Skitty’s, all his Eeveelutions around his feet, waiting for this own breakfast. He pulled out the tray of puffs for them, divvying them up, and finally turning back to his own caffeine savior to get him through the morning.
“Ohhhh, you call him Bruuuuuce,” she teased, poking his arm a little. “Do you have a thing for the good Doctor? He’s a little on the short side, so that would be interesting in a logistical format, because he’s shorter than even Tony. But, the hair is very-“
"We're gonna get some air," William said to Tony as Rachel walked out of the room as well. "Your, AI?" Tony nodded, "he said that he was alert us if anything changed, or when dinner was ready."
"I hired her to make some stuff for my company." He smiled a little, loving when Peter talked so easily about a subject. He really seemed to enjoy art, even more now that he was getting exposed first-hand to different mediums. "Pretty cool, huh?"
“You do this often, don’t you?” Bucky asked the ten-year-old. “You seem like the type who likes to throw himself into stupid situations.”
"Reroute all work calls to me, please? It's Tony's birthday, and he deserves a break." Jarvis responded in the positive as Steve stared down where Tony had disappeared. "Where is Dr Banner?"
Tony easily lost himself down in his workshop, working on the new suit. Jarvis would tell him when it was time for dinner, shut down the lab if he had too, but Tony needed this little distraction. He wasn't sure why hearing that Mary and Agent were engaged was such a shock to him. He certainly wasn't surprised, they had been dating for a while now, at least two years if his thinking was right. Tony dropped the screwdriver on the desk. He couldn't concentrate now.
“If it happens,” Tony said with a nod. “I never liked glasses, and I’ll still have contacts for public events, and going out as Iron Man if I can help it, but if it’ll help stop drama, then I’m all for it.”
"And then you get to deal with both Peter and Mary when you tell them that you've moved them in," Steve reminded him.
"Yes, and I will see them when I leave here. And you, Stark?" He looked up at Tony. Tony froze a little, looked at the man, then down at his mug. Did he? Yes, he had Peter, he had a son, but was he truly family? Tony hadn't acted like a Father, like a Dad should. Not that he had the best role model growing up. Tony had tried to take some cues from his butler Jarvis, but he hadn't been a father to him. Howard hadn't prepared him to have a family. Tony knew what not to do, but he didn't know what was the best thing to do with Peter. So was Tony really family with Peter?
"It feels different," Peter said after a few minutes, pulling Tony's shirt back down. "But, in a good way. It doesn't feel as, ummm," Peter's face crinkled as he tried to find the words to describe was he was feeling. "It doesn't feel as icky. I like this one." Tony nodded, smiling at him.
Tony reached for the emergency latches and peeled himself out of the suit as quickly as he could. As long as he was here, he could disable the disruptor. Tony stood up and scrambled over to the machine, circling it once before he got down on his knees, crawling underneath, to find the main hatch inside. He took a deep breath before reaching up to open it.
"What?" Tony turned to face them, his own club soda in his hand as he crossed his arms. "Peter likes the zoo! It's like a living zoo in the wild."
Tony started rubbing his nose. "Why is this our lives?" He muttered under his breath. "Okay, so, how do we get more information?"
The display took over, starting to recognize people, read faces, until it zoomed in on one familiar face on the ferris wheel, two people sitting next to him. Tony grinned and moved a bit faster, doing a fly-by, watching as Peter saw him, and saw his eyes light up. He couldn't hear what he was saying, but he tugged on Mary's jacket and pointed up int he sky, at him, grinning. Mary blinked and looked over, and Tony was already flying away, back over the water, and heading up into the sky.
Steve tried not to smirk, pulling on his jeans. “And what’s wrong with that? I’ve gotten glowing reports from everyone else about him with the kids.”
Tony nodded. "He was friends with him." Tony channeled his childhood, when he was still young enough to be happy when he thought of Captain America, before he realized that Howard gave more attention to a dead man than to his own son that was there in front of him. "I wanted to be just like Captain America when I was younger." Peter reached up to Tony to be held again, and he obliged, moving on to show him the other displays. There were magazines, and his old posters, costumes that he tried to make with the maids and nannies. "He was brave, and had no fear, and did what was right, to make people safe."
"I asked him, then I told him to stop hurting my Daddy," Peter spoke up. "Then he stopped." Steve glanced at Tony who shrugged, then hissed when he moved his arm.
"You love trying to rile me up, don't you?" Mary smirked at him and he rolled his eyes, a little smirk. "Does Tony not like me?"
"Cool!" He hurried off to his room, completely ignoring Jamie. Steve and Tony agreed to let it go for a couple of days, as long as he wasn't actually mean to her, and then they would try getting Peter to interact with Jamie more.
Wade tried to pull his head back, but Meg held onto his chin and put the frozen bag of peas on his cheek. He grinned at her as she clicked her tongue. “Your Mom is going to kill us,” she muttered, putting Wade’s hand up to hold the bag.
Tony groaned and moved to sit up, his good arm wrapped around Peter. "He jumped out of the window, Jarvis is still down, but I've got Peter." Tony kissed the top of Peter's head, not paying attention as the other three coordinated their approach.
Obidiah walked around the couch, grabbed Tony's jaw and moved his head to look up at him. When he let go, Tony's head drooped a little to the side and Tony thought that his body was going to seize up again. He saw Peter's hair on the couch next to him.
"Weren't you helping Tony with the rebuild?" Bruce glanced at him, then went back to what he was making. "Getting the windows in on all the livable floors?"
As he pulled the door open, he threw an arm up to cover his eyes and he started moving again. "I wonder if this counts as your first kidnapping," Tony idly wondered, quietly. He didn't want to let anyone else know where he was. There was more gunfire, and shouting, but it sounded a bit away. "I mean, this is a rescue, but you weren't taken from a safe home. This is, literally, the opposite of safe."
Loki rolled his eyes, letting out a huff. “Your lover’s mind is being pulled in a different direction than his body is, and it could be catastrophic if this is not handled delicately. You could be left with a breathing husk of a body.” Steve’s body jerked and Loki lifted his hands again. “I said could. Honestly, Captain, wording Is everything. As is the application of magic. It’s a very sensitive thing, and I do believe that the Doctor will be able to handle it.”
"Yeah, I know that." Tony shrugged a little. He pushed himself to his feet. "Wasn't like I could just leave you trapped in a nightmare though, that's some kind of cruel punishment." He turned to look at Steve who had gotten up as well, and Tony was treated to the sight that Captain America slept with no shirt no, and what had to be some joke pajama bottoms with pictures of what looked like genie bottles? Tony raised his eyebrow, looking at the pajamas, then back up to Steve's face. Steve glanced down to wee what Tony had been looking at them, then looked back up, his cheeks tinting red.
Tony hummed, looking through updated files on all of the Avengers, which he supposed they officially were now, which was kind of weird to think about. He went through and took out any information that linked Peter to him, because he still didn't trust SHIELD, and didn't want Peter's life in danger. The important people who needed to know about Peter knew through Tony himself, that was enough.
"We're gonna have to make a list of everything you need." Tony sat down on the edge of the bed, watching Steve try to get restless legs into the outfit. "This is fun to watch."
"We'll watch Peter for you." The opposite of what he had been expecting. "You go and shame all of them, teach them another lesson in the humanity that they don't have."
Unbeta'd, and Marvel owns more of this than I do. Also, all music/movies/tv shows belongs to those that wrote/performed/produced/etc them. I use them for humor and good times.
“Sir is not allowed to exceed twelve cups in one eight hour sitting,” Jarvis said, selling him out. “There are even restrictions on the size of the cups. Miss Potts learned that lesson early on.”
"Thank you, Mama!" Peter smiled, then looked over at Steve. "My Daddy makes robots, and he said he'd teach me how to make them too! He's really smart, and he says I'm gonna be really smart, just like him."
"Where did you get these children? What did you do with the real Wade and Peter?" Meg snorted and smiled, and she took the plate from Wade's hand.
"I just did." Even Jarvis sounded rushed. And then he was up, flying, dropping off the rest of the chitauri soldiers.
"We're here to see Julie Wilson," Tony said, watching Wade inspect around the desk. He was very curious.
Steve’s head turned when he heard a soft roar, and Tony grinned, hand out flat, and a gauntlet seemed to slam into his hand, then unfolded up to his elbow. Two more pieces flew in the room, attached to his bicep and shoulder, all coming together to form the left arm of an Iron Man suit. “Tony? What-“
"I couldn't tell," Tony deadpanned. "While she was, doing what she does, her brother came in. Told me all about my weapons that almost killed them.... I know what happened. Do you think that they're going to be a threat, to come after me?"
Tony took the most direct route to what he knew would be a safe space. He didn’t need to put in the code, Jarvis was already opening the hidden door in the back of the workshop. Any other day, Tony would say that he had built a nest, but on days like this, it was the only thing that he could trust. The room was dark and cool, lots of pillows and blankets around, the floor padded with lots of cushioning, and custom made bean bag chairs. He went for the furthest corner of the room, dropping into the oversized cushion that would practically swallow him. The fabric had been painstakingly fabricated so that it wouldn’t irritate his already overstimulated sense of touch. The room was quiet, with insulation and extra noise canceling foam on the walls, and the temperature was constantly regulated.
“What is it with you white boys?” Tony cackled and Steve’s eyes widened a little. “I think I can excuse this though. The Army man is admitting that the Air Force is better, that’s okay, that’s why he brought in another brother.” Steve blinked. Tony was running out of air while he laughed. “Hey, Captain, it’s okay, I understand, and I humbly accept this honor on behalf of the Air-“
"Sand, there's so much sand," his whispered, sliding down to sit on the ground. "It's so dirty, not like the shop, I can't work here. Peter, I need to, Peter, he's okay? He's okay, he's with you, he's safe, right?"
Jamie leaned forward as much as she could, and grabbed at the dress. Her little hands were messing with the ruffles, but she wasn't throwing it. Steve shrugged and counted it as a win. "Okay, but here's the deal, I need you to not make a fuss when I put it on you. And I will be putting socks and shoes on you, so, you know, don't kick those off." She looked up at him as he spoke, still holding onto the dress.
"I'm fine!" He may have said it a little too loudly, but he could feel the embarrassment rolling through him. "Much better, thanks for the talk, I'm just gonna go now and work downstairs, good night!" He made a motion, hoping that Jarvis would know to hang up.
“Tony,” the older man corrected. “I prefer Tony.” Steve nodded a little. “Good news, I was able to fix the balls. I recommend replacing them soon though.” Tony walked over to him, holding out his hand to give Steve a supply of Luxury balls. Steve put them in a pouch on his belt, and Tony held out the other two pokeballs.
“Did you know that he had been keeping Vee?” Steve said he was going to try and get past it, but Vee was his first. He had found her abandoned as a baby, and nursed her back to health. They had been inseparable. And then Tony Stark had swooped in while he was gone and stolen her.
"How can you defend him?" Steve glanced over when he heard Rachel's voice behind him. Steve raised an eyebrow. "After everything's that happened? All the trouble that follows him? He's still known as the Merchant of Death."
"Yeah, and you probably wait, looking for the coolest one," Peter continued. "We haven't decided what color for you yet."
Steve had faltered a little as they walked up the walkway to the front door, staring at the mansion. Tony glanced back at him. "Come now, warm bed waits inside, Cap."
"It should be for the price you paid for it." Tony smiled when Pepper walked into the kitchen. "All the tables have been set, the flowers in place, and the DJ has set up her stuff." Tony nodded and took the tablet from Pepper's hands.
"Of course, Sir," the AI chimed in, lowering the volume to not frighten their new resident. "Shall I create a new folder?"
Her jaw dropped a little. "You have a prototype from Tony Stark himself? How did you manage that, and can I get in on this??" Steve chuckled and let a little smile turn his lips up when he saw another song pop up in his playlist. "That's a smile of familiarity. Do you work with him??"
"There is another way that I know of," Loki spoke up. "Tis a way that you know to work even on me for the truth," he said looking at Thor.
Tony held up his phone, wading into the argument. "I've already called a Stark jet to meet us at the airport in a couple of hours. I've got exactly Twenty-Four hours before my son is back at the Tower, and I'm going to take advantage of it by actually sleeping."
"You just want to jump right into work?" Tony said, watching the man. "You don't want anything to eat? For me to show you where your room is?"
“No,” Tony told him, stepping into the elevator. “I’ll go tell him myself. He knows that I need to go, but I might as well get anything else we need for Peter’s birthday as well.”
"I'm not going to help you if you try to get the other guy to come out." Tony smiled, but made a motion of zipping his lips. "And when this is all over, I wanna meet your kid."
“Sometimes I get busy,” Tony said. “I’m rebuilding the rest of the Tower, sorry if it offended you.”
"He'll probably sleep for another forty-five minutes," Tony continued. Natasha walked over and Tony caught her eyes. "Does this mean you're officially out of my actual business?" Steve glanced between Tony and Natasha.
"Captain Rogers, while I would usually agree with you, right now I must insist that Sir retreat to his workshop." Steve frowned. "I have been unable to properly record his vitals, and run tests on his new arc reactor, and must make sure that his is not suffering from any adverse side effects from the new element."
"That thing is really cool, Mom," Wade said excitedly. "Mr Stark makes them himself, and they're so much cooler than an iPad!" Tony grinned at the statement. Hell yeah his stuff was better than Apple. "He's letting me use one while I'm staying with him and Peter. And Peter's grandparents are there, too, and his Granpa is super fun!"
. Steve found it vaguely annoying. "I'm sorry, that's actually him." She pulled out a sleek black device, the screen lighting up for a short time as she tapped her thumb across the screen, then put it back in her pocket.
“The cloaking spells around him are stronger when he’s around me,” Strange said, turning in his seat as Tony walked by and over to the fridge. “Also, he kind of knows more about what we encountered than anyone else.”
"You know your Mom's upstairs, right Wade?" Tony asked as he walked over, plopping himself down next to Peter.
My mom is a single mother, and I'm her only child, so I was suddenly put in the position of making the decisions that would save her life. The doctors were telling me that there was still a good chance that she wouldn't make it, she was a surgical emergency and a medical emergency. She made it through the night, and made it through the surgery, and she had to have a leg amputated above the knee. So in between making sure she's doing well in rehab, I have to clean the house out, get a storage unit, sell the house, and find a place for me to live. (Mom luckily has case workers that will help her get that ball rolling for when she gets out.)
