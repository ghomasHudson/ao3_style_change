“How are your classes? Routines set?” Steve asked as he sat across Bruce , sipping coffee while Bruce hummed around his tea.
“No! Steve no please" he whimpered but Steve didn’t stop until it was inside , he wouldn’t have been able to manage if he didn’t have the strength he did to immobilize Tony even with him trashing around
She walked inside and gave a small smile to Tony, handing a small water bottle to him. He took it with shaky hands and drank most of it in one gulp. Steve shared a look with natasha and she nodded and left.
He took a second in spite of himself to make sure he was steady, and walked over to the snacks table and took a cookie and took a bite Turned to us and grinned.
“I cant see him like this Clint, he hates everything medical and it’s only going to get worse after he’s awake"
“Ok I’ll see you guys in the morning she said” before hugging Steve a moment too long like she was just taking in the fact that he was alive and Steve wasn’t ashamed to say that he clung to her for just as long.
Five minutes into the silence of his class while he spoke about the French revolution Tony’s head dropped onto rhodey's shoulder, his eyes shut. Steve almost took a tentative step towards him but aborted at The last moment and tried to finish the class as best as he could.
“Okay, so now that this is solved. What are we going to do about Tony’s living arrangements?” that was something steve honestly didn’t know
There was one more thing Steve needed to talk to bruce about, more as a friend than anything . He caught him just as they were about to leave “bruce” he placed a hand on his sleeve and Bruce slowed down and sat down on the table knowing Steve needed something from him.
“he is a little shy" Steve said loudly just to ease the situation and thor snorted and Tony scowled at him. Which reminded him ,Steve didn’t know if Tony had officially met thor yet.
Tony's eyes were tracking Bruce like a hawk. "Tony hey look at me, baby. It's just a needle. It will only take a minute. Come on, here; look at me" I told him forcefully turning his head to face me.
“Agent romanoff and Barton are in the locker room of the gym in the basement.”  Steve smirked at him folding his hands “ what if I wanted to ask you something else?” he asked raising an eyebrow but Phil still wasn’t amused ,infact he didn’t even look up from the stack of papers he was going through.
Steve dropped him onto the bed , albeit carefully and Tony scowled at him as Steve retreated from his grabby hands.
“Bruce told me he has been failing his classes , how does that work when said persons IQ is higher than the class combined?” she asked , but what caught Steve’s attention was the person who gave her the information
“you with me now?” Steve asked and it took a moment before Tony nodded against him and natasha wiped his tear streaked face with a wet towel.
Turning to fury he said “ you came to me , told me the best place would be under the watchful eyes of captain America. Did it never occur to you that captain america has a dangerous job?”
“we are… well me and him ..I don’t know what to call it okay? Just know that I like him more than I should.” Steve finished lamely.
“that was a really bad hit mr Rogers" that other boy warned before they left even though rhodey looked very reluctant to leave.
Ten minutes back Steve had roused from his sleep for some reason and he soon realised it was because the warmth next to him was gone and Steve had searched the bathroom, and a couple of other places before he heard the minute noises from the kitchen and had ever since been standing there at the entrance staring at his lover who seemed to be oblivious to his presence.
“Okay" he sighed “thank you" he whispered and Steve couldn’t help but run his thumb over the already bruising skin on Tony’s shoulder.
“can I have a kiss?” he asked once Steve nodded his agreement. Steve leaned back a little before he caught the hurt expression in Tony’s eyes.  With a small smile he wiped the graphite Marks tony had on his cheek from his pencils, and gave him a soft kiss on his cheek.
He walked through the isle on the side towards Tony’s row and nudged lightly at the person sitting on the corner and whispered to him to call Tony. A few heads turned but thankfully they had shut the lights off and it didn’t distract everyone as much. Tony’s head snapped to the right single eyebrow raising.
They had a peaceful breakfast , well as peaceful as it could be with Clint and tony blasting paint everywhere.
His fingers were nervously twisting in his shirt and Steve felt instantly guilty when he tried to comfort him and Tony just pushed him away.
Steve was shocked to say none the least, a lot of people usually just assume that Steve does not feel the pain ,truthfully he does feel the pain but since his gig as Captain America he has been in enough fights that his pain threshold has increased to quiet a bit.
“Close your eyes, I am right here. You focus on my hand okay ?” He told him as he snuck his hand below the gown and drew gentle patterns along his back.
“maybe you should sleep a little first, we don’t want your concussed brain getting too overloaded.” Steve tried but tony frowned at him, and Steve knew what was going to come next so he averted his eyes quickly.
He forced himself to focus on the papers in front of him that he had to finish grading, letting tony sleep a little longer. He had gym after Steve’s class but Tony was in no shape to be playing today and Steve would write him a note for the next time. He didn’t think Tony would miss it either way.
He eased out from under tony, stuffing firm pillows under him before brushing the hair matted to his forehead one last time smoothing the slight frown there with a thumb.
“You are okay anna, you collapsed in gym. Can you look at me?” he asked as he waited patiently for her to turn and recognize him.
Tony was awake staring wide eyed at the ceiling and grasping at his chest like he couldn’t breathe and the monitor connected to him was screeching loud enough to wake anyone on the floor.
Off all the things Steve thought he would be experiencing emotionally in that second, he never thought fear would be one of them. A sense of cold washed over him as he realized that he was indeed much bigger than Tony, literally in size and strength and if he has one second of lapse in control he could hurt tony beyond repair.
“Obadiah stane, howards business partner , found Tony on the site of the crash. Took him away, for fear of someone coming back to finish the job. What Obadiah didn’t know is we kept tabs on him as well and watched him raise Tony as his own. Tony was in boarding school because obadiah thought it would be better to keep him away from his father’s company as he believes someone who is after the company is who is responsible for Howard and Maria’s death.”
“I need you at my place stat" Steve cut her off ,he was practically growling and to be honest it was scaring Tony somewhat
“hey, everything alright?” Steve asked as he sat down opposite to him after politely declining the seat offered from the chemistry teacher. She had been trying for a while to get Steve’s attention on her but he obviously wasn’t interested, that didn’t stop her from trying though.
“Dry your hair please" he said instead and Tony gave him a look and went to do as told carrying his coffee with him and Steve watched him as he walked out of the room with a slight limp.
“It’s burning , give me a minute” he said with a not so straight face and Steve pitied him as he went to the door and locked it, and walked back to Tony and shifted him so he was sitting against Steve’s chest.
Steve skimmed his hands upwards thumbs brushing the perfect nipples and Tony stiffened just as little as Steve put a little pressure into the touch
Tony had an arm tucked under Steve’s back and one around his torso. He was snoring softly, just a soft soft sound on every inhale , and Steve felt Tony’s chest rise and fall against his own side with every breath he took.  His face was still tear streaked and the room smelt musky from their activity last night.
Tony let out a whine like he hadn’t meant for this to happen trying to close his legs to cover himself up , he wouldn’t even open his eyes as Steve manhandled him.
“Stane is not getting in, I don’t care what he says. I don’t want him near Tony” clint nodded as he walked off with his own towel wrapped around his neck.
“I’ll just wash my hands and let natasha know she can come back inside , we need to let the nurse fix your IV”
“I have enhanced hearing, I could hear you from the door.” He said folding his legs underneath him and turning towards Tony who wouldn’t turn to look at him ,his eyes glued to the TV.
“please sweetheart, let me hold you” tony leaned forward ever so slightly ,but it was all the green light Steve needed as he wrapped his arms around the teen and pressed him close to his heart.
“He always blindly accepts it.. he doesn’t have time for all this he is always busy with the company"
“You did it all these days, it wont be any different.” Steve shook his head “everything is different, that boy was everything to Howard.”
He was not leaving until the next morning so they had some time and he really did not want to make things worse.
Tony pulled away first running his hand through his hair leaving it dripping and wet and Steve reached for the shampoo bottle , and cleaned his hair out as much as he would allow before doing the same for himself.
“You asked me not to judge you that morning” she started and Steve stiffened in his seat his glance wavering to Tony who was now laying the ground feigning hurt as Clint hit him with the paint.
“I know” he said and Tony squirmed as Steve started kissing down his throat and his chest like he had done this morning. He let go of Tony’s wrists and fought a smile when Tony kept them there .
He left early that morning to school ,it would be his last for a while. He could hear Tony whining about the substitute teacher in his head and he smiled sadly as he thought over how to inform him about the mission. He knew he couldn’t lie and tell him that shield needed him because there was no one else, he also didn’t know what to expect of Tony’s feelings towards him right now.  So he kept an open mind as he walked to his first class just as the bell rang.
“If I had known all it took to put you to sleep was my teaching, I would have done it a lot sooner.” Steve smirked as Tony  snorted.
“phil found these when he first looked into stane. There are a lot of them,pre surgical ,post surgical. Even follow up x Rays upto the age of twelve.” He just nodded, looking at the documents , the amount of medical jargon was baffling and even though steve knew lot in medical terms, this was some advance things and he couldn’t make out a lot of the science.
“Hey hey , come on sweetheart” Steve coaxed and natasha slid in beside Steve placing a palm on Tony’s forehead.
“I will be” he said confidently and that was enough for Steve. He stood up and pushed Tony backwards onto the bed ,hovering over him.
Steve was about to ask her how she was feeling but before he could, there was loud bang as the door was pushed open and Steve heard the distinct whimpering sound he knew all too well.
He used his other hand to continue running through his hair while telling him that he was going to be okay
Tony resisted, trying to turn his face away , “relax for me tony, it’s only there to help you.” It took a little bit of coaxing on Steve’s part but eventually tony settled against his chest, exhausted. His breathing slowed down drastically and Steve eased the mask off his face after a few silent minutes.
“There is obviously something we are missing here" clint made a face , steve recognized that face immediately
“When did it start?” he asked not wanting to pry but he really was curious. He had been so selfish since Tony, he hasn’t been giving attention to the others that matter.
“There is a lot of air in the room, all you have to do is follow my breathing okay?” Steve coached him as tony slowly started listing forward , he used his other arm to stabilising him , holding him upright.
“It depends” he said , clearing his throat  and then continued “on what your definition of making out entails” Steve pursed his lips holding in a smile . If he could make snide retorts then he would be fine.
Steve iced his laceration on his cheek with an ice pack, the swelling still obvious. It had been rather deep and Steve was starting to understand just how distracted he had been during today’s battle. He had to make sure that didn’t happen-
“I have some friends willing to help me monitor them, I am sure we will be able to handle it if you can okay this for me” the principal did not look too happy with Steve today ,normally he was always very pro anything with Steve because he knows Steve’s secret and nobody denied captain America anything.
“I promise , I am fine. I am here and talking aren’t I?” He asked as he reached for the water with the straw someone had clearly already made him drink some.
“Fine,” he mumbled and when Steve calmly wrapped his fingers around Tony’s to still them, his breaths started to come in tiny gasps and natasha said something about being in shock and getting a sedative and vanished.
“Excuse me?” He asked playing dumb and tony gave an exasperated sigh as he reached a hand up and traced a line on his cheek with a finger. Steve had to force himself to stay still and not catch the teens fingers in his own or lean into the touch.
“Can you do it?” he asked and Steve sighed considering just lying to Tony that he had no medical experience whatsoever even though shield had given him extensive lessons to manage almost all situations.
Steve took a moment to catalogue the faces, his eyes stopping at one. His breath faltered just a tiny bit when the brown eyes looked up to meet his. The new kid.
“No sir,  we don't know.  All she said was she wanted to talk to you" he nodded taking the phone from him and looking through the call history.  The were about 7 calls from Tony but that was it.  And just as Steve was about to ask the agent again if he was sure it was a girl on the line,  the phone buzzed again Tony’s name flashing on the screen. He picked it up concerned “were you able to find him?” he heard from the line , that was definitely peppers voice.
“no” tony frowned and steves eyes darted up from the shirt he was throwing in the hamper along with tonys pants
“Are we done? I ordered my pizza two hours ago” came clint's voice over the com. He had surprisingly stayed silent during his and Natasha’s conversation.
“Mr. Stark I need to speak with you for a moment" and he saw Tony’s eyes meet peppers across the room and he glared at her until she left as he stood there waiting for  everyone to leave.
Bruce shrugged "we are all mostly fine, just a few bruises here and there" he said looking at Tony, which was Bruce's way of telling me I should currently be paying more attention to the man now snuggled into my arms.
"Maybe three glasses of beer, nothing else. I swear" steve heart broke for him as tony tried to justify his drinking
“He was there, when I was being held in some underground facility. I remember him , he was often there. They argued a lot about money and weapon transactions”
A letter from cps, claiming that if Tony was being kept with them unwillingly then legal actions will be taken. But it didn’t matter, they just needed Tony to tell them about the abuse by stane and the team can be easily assigned as his temporary guardians. Well easily because shield will pull every string in the book to make it happen if he tells them to.
Stane on the other hand had gone berserk when CPS came forward with original birth certificate and had denied any claims regarding the fake one saying that it was what Howard had left him with.
“so it would be better if there was no link between me and tony at all?” He asked needing a confirmation. He wanted nothing more than to be the person to protect him but Steve will do anything if it meant keeping him safe.
“don’t you dare talk to me about risks, don’t you dare.” Steve has never seen fury not take the upper hand in an argument , especially when the other was yelling. “my boy is lying on a hospital bed, do you know what it feels like to get a call saying he was injured in a bomb blast?” Steve flinched
The meeting was interrupted when a nervous junior agent knocked on the door. Fury glaring at him because he had no business being here.
“Sorry sir, we did say that but she is insisting that she speak with you.” Steve sighed as fury rolled his eyes and motioned for steve to leave. Steve apologized to the group of people sitting around the conference room as he left to take the phone from the agent .
“You two, out, Now!” said the man in the fancy suit. Steve had seen him only once, he had only spoken once informing Steve that the world thought he was dead but Steve had shrugged.
“then be there for him.” And Steve sighed, knowing that’s what he had failed to do. Twice now actually.
“The palladium is not out of his system yet, we need to treat it but now we know it’s not being made worse.” Bruce said as he tweaked a few things around Tony and finally , finally stopped.
“Because I already took a shower this morning , stop moving for two seconds atleast.” Tony whined as Steve finally managed to get Tony’s shirt off. His skin was pale from the lack of sunlight for so many days and skin pasty.
Steve stood , a hand on Tony’s back while the teen tested the temperature of the water falling from the shower. Steve had brought him to the showers, turned the water on cold and asked Tony to get under it hoping that would make his problem go away.
“If you need our help, you are going to have to tell us who did this” she said in a no nonsense kinda way
He pushed him self up before he could get carried away and Tony whined at the loss of contact making grabby fingers at him
Steve had changed into a pair of pants and shirt , casual and comfortable and Tony came out wrapped in his towel looking sheepish as ever.
Tony didn’t seem to be too disturbed by the accusation from natasha but Steve on the other hand was and had been planning to give her a piece of his mind when she came back.
“Ste-..nng" whatever he was about to say died down the moment steve pressed his own body down against Tony’s, his aching cock seeking friction from Tony’s.
“Still feverish, he doesn’t know he is sick and he remembers everything from last night” the last part took her by surprise
Tony was pouting full force, Steve could feel it even if he didn’t see it. He groaned inwardly as he succumbed.
“I only have my bike with me, will that be okay or do you want me to borrow Bruce’s car?” he asked now wrapping his other arm around Tony’s wrist
“Well , you aren’t a genius for nothing I guess" he said ignoring the last comment Tony had made. Steve could not encourage it and he didn’t intend to. But today was hard day for everyone
“is he okay?” tony asked Bruce his voice rougher than before , the fatigue finally showing on his face and stature. Bruce gave him a once over before answering “mild concussion,  a broken wrist , some bruising. He will be brand new within the end of the week" steve blushed as tony smirked before leaning down and giving him a quick kiss on his lips. “I need to talk to fury about coordinating my SI crew for clean up .will you be okay for a few minutes?” he said waiting for steve nod but instead all he got was a pout.
Steve pulled the shirt he wore over his head in one swift motion and Tony for a second was stunned at the physique and his lips popped open with an audible gasp
“I will kill him" was all Steve could say and natasha was honestly taken aback , Steve, captain America the all sensible righteous one was being torn apart right in front of her.
“You didn’t make him eat yesterday after everything? He hasn’t eaten anything since we picked him up and don’t even try to deny it Tony, because you were with us the while the time and if we didn’t eat you didn’t either.”
Steve was still fuming and no matter how many times Bruce tried to get him to sit down shove the water bottle tony had just drank from earlier at him he couldn’t keep still , he found himself needing to smash something. He had trained so hard to keep his strength under reigns but at this moment it felt like he was going to lose it all.
“I have to pee" right, they had taken out the catheter yesterday. Someone had to wall him to the bathroom now.
She froze at the doorway taking in the scene for a second and then broke into a smirk “Steve if you wanted the money you could have just asked us, there was no need to kidnap the son of a billionaire”
His eyes snapped opened as he came to a startling realization that he was not trapped under the water, but that he was sitting down under a shower. And the pressure weighing him down was a sleeping Tony he was clutching close to his chest.
He gave them both a genuine smile , “we are just headed to a friends place, weekend getaway” he said and he knew he had been immediately caught with the lie when tony frowned at him looking him up and down, but surprisingly he stayed quiet.
“Steve is missing his little one” thor promptly dropped the apple at that, a whine coming from Clint as his bow traced the path of the falling apple .
By the time he was taking full breaths he had listed completely against Steve looking truly exhausted.
Steve flagged down a cab in front of his apartment ,and let Tony go tipping the cabbie ahead so he was sure that Tony would indeed get home safe . He was aware he was being overly protective and that Tony was not at all incapable of getting home in a cab. But considering that Tony  was almost dead on his feet from exhaustion he didn’t want to take any chances. He gave Tony a quick peck on the cheek before closing the door after him and waved the cab off.
“steve!” was the last thing he heard before he pulled the door closed behind him and entered the biting cold of the morning air.
“Uhm, I don’t think so.. he kinda seems out of it.” Now Steve was annoyed as to why in the world would  Tony drink this much.
“when we found him again , he was enhanced like me. “the winter soldier” is his code name . A murderer, he was brainwashed, under some kind of influence.” Tony still hadn’t moved so Steve continued
“are you really so out of shape or are you milking this?” he asked him sitting next to allowing Tony to cozy up to his side.
“Stane, you are being irrational.” Fury began but was cut off by stane “no, I am being a realist. The job you do is by no means a walk in the park. I will not have my godson prancing around with you lot , only to get a call one day that there has been a tragic accident.”
“You were best friends with dad, so you know the mansion as well as I do" and Steve laughed at Tony’s reaction it was so damn adorable and Steve nosed Tony’s throat smelling the rain on him still.
The next time Steve came to , it was much more pleasant. The healing factor in the serum taking care of everything.
“I am telling you nat” Steve stretched his arm as far as it would go to gain maximum moment to bring his shield down on the doombot. It screeched as the connections severed and fell to the ground like a puppet “this kid, I don’t understand him. Why lie, you know?”
“You are not fine, you passed out yesterday Tony! How long have you both known? Why was I not told?” he voice raised and Tony flinched ever so lightly.
"okay let's go then, it's my turn to pick the movie! So let's make this fast!" he said trying to sound chirpy, but I could hear the tremble in his voice.
“One mile and we will be back at the tower, come on you can do this" he tried coaxing him but this time Tony just fell to his knees giving up. Steve cringed as his new shoes scuffed up against the dirty road.
Everyone settled back into their chairs as Bruce quietly studied the monitors before tucking a blanket around tony and steve .
Tony huffed as he shifted on the bed a hand reaching for the IV and Steve was across the room fast enough to interrupt the scratching that was about to happen.
“Steve! Put me down people will see us!” he said trying to get away but Steve held him tightly feeling Tony’s harsh breathing and fast heartrate against his own chest. Maybe this was not the best idea , but it was a start.
This time around Steve didn’t hesitate to tell him about tony. Bucky listened painfully quiet about everything that Steve had to say  and he never gave away even a small emotion and Steve worried that maybe he was making a mistake.
He entered the bar, eyes immediately zeroing in on two people looking distinctly out of place. They were sitting at a booth at the far end looking uncomfortable and anxious. Good , steve thought to himself as he made his way over .
“He will be just fine buddy , keep him warm yeah?” his smile turned bigger when he felt Tony wrap himself around Steve and plant a kiss along the underside of his jaw. Steve reciprocated by wrapping arms around Tony and holding him close.
“I don’t know, okay? He’s just...” Steve trailed off considering himself to be lucky that he had an excuse to not complete that answer as a doombot struck him particularly hard in the abdomen.
“you are really biig" he heard not one chuckle but actually a few and his head whipped up to see rhodey and natasha and pepper standing at the door.
“Okay, so I told Bruce ibam taking you home, they think you have food poisoning .” Tony made a disgusted face but followed him out to the parking
He flipped Tony around so that he was lying facedown on Steve’s lap and Steve pulled the briefs higher to check more closely.
He silently pulled the covers over him and hooked the IV back to the port on Tony’s wrist. Who sat quietly not uttering a word letting Steve do whatever he needed to.
“Don’t you have class?” He asked tapping his watch and tony only shrugged. Steve had wanted to be done with this conversation but tony didn’t seem to want the same.
“She’s down, went hard on her ankle. Wasn’t there to back her up” shit, this was Steve’s fault , if he had been there then they could have split up properly.
“code black in 3 .. 2..” Steve did not have time to think before reacting , everything happened so fast, the doors on the metro closing as pepper was screaming for Tony,Steve wrapping himself around Tony and pulling him to the ground covering as much flesh as possible and the loud boom that shook the entire station as the bomb exploded .
“You can at least wait for her to leave” he mumbled looking embarrassed and Natasha just shook her head and left the room pulling the door closed behind her
“Didn't want you to see me like this" he said looking away and Steve hooked his finger under Tony’s chin pulling it towards himq
“Okay, you can either sit here and sulk or come spend your last day with me. Turns out you are not the only one who got permission to go home” Steve said flashing a smile at Tony holding up another letter.
Tony winced as he sat down and Steve bought his knees up so he could rest his back against his thighs. Steve pulled the covers up over his shoulders, covering all the tempting patches of skin. Tony was still looking at him with this amazed look and Steve wanted to just accept it and well maybe go for round two.
“Steve you need to talk about exactly what happened. It will help keep his mind from having to fill in the blanks with its own thoughts.” Clint said as he kneeled down next to natasha holding a first aid kit which Steve recognized as the shield mandated kit.
“There will be a reactor casing implanted in his chest, and the reactor core can be changed at will.”
Bruce shut his phone in what seemed like just few seconds but Steve had a feeling he had zoned out for a lot more than that.
“Calm your tits cap, we rented out the whole hotel, no one is here but us.” Oh! That explained a lot and Steve chuckled to himself at how extravagant shield did things sometimes.
"How long?" He asked once they were alone and Tony finally looked up at him with pleading eyes. What he was pleading for, steve didnt know.
Here’s the thing, Tony even at sixteen had the soft baby skin and the scanty body hair didn’t help much with the image when he was dressed like this. It made steve feel just a little perverted , he shook his head slightly to clear his thoughts and went over to the silent brooding teen.
“You want me to touch you?” He asked as he watched his cock twitch at the mention of touching but Steve didn’t , he kept teasing and tony was getting restless in between his hips grinding back against steve and he had to bite his lips to not lose to his own needs because he couldn’t do that to his still sixteen and virginal sweetheart.
Steve shut the door close to his class, walking back to him as tony slowly and very reluctantly undid the buttons on his shirt.
Steve had completely forgotten that he was wearing his uniform, he didn’t want to lie anymore. Tony didn’t deserve it
“Yup, from what I have heard he’s been doing exceptionally well in other subjects as well. Seems like we may finally have one student we can make a difference with. But there is something off about the child, he doesn’t listen in class but yet is so bright I don’t know how to help him.”
Tony did call him almost every alternate day for the first week and then when Steve did get caught they had taken away his phone and his clothes .
"Were they always drunk , even when it was something you did that made them angry?" Tony nodded against his neck letting Steve thread his fingers through the finger tips that were peeking out of the green bandage around his wrist and palm.
When tony responded to the kiss he pulled away and used his arms to lift Tony and position him between his legs and used his own feet to pull apart Tony’s and held them there exposing his twitching cock to the expanse of the room.
“is this some new kink you are discovering?” steve asked him light heartedly but he didn’t expect tony to nod against him and mumble a “maybe"
He was freezing, steve could tell by how cold his skin was and he made Tony stand for a minute while he grabbed him a fresh shirt to put over his head. He couldn’t raise his arms yet and Tony was glad for the help.
“There’s nothing in here that mentions what happens to the company in case something happens to Tony” he shuddered at the thought but quickly shook the thoughts away.
“You want to eat something before you sleep?” he asked shaking Tony a little knowing he was getting drowsy
“actually I wanted the billionaire itself, not the money. So I though hey there he is, let me grab him!”
"oh look!Iron ass fainted!" I heard Clint say and I wanted to give him a snarky response but my brain still did not seem to have a handle on things.
Tony didn’t fight them further,  he was silent throughout the prepping process. He kept his eyes on steve , tracking every movement he made. Steve stuck by his side just the same. He kept his hand firmly grasping Tony’s until he was asked to let go so they could strap his arms up and Tony took a second to really let go.
“I think I am jealous of Tony’s book” apparantly bruce didn’t thinking was as funny as he thought it was
“You with me?” he asked as he studied his face for signs of distress.  Tony nodded trying to contain a yawn as he leaned into Steve’s hands and he twisted his neck to get the crick out of it. Steve rubbed his hand along the nape of his neck trying to help.
“Can you stand?” he asked as he watched Tony wobble a little on his feet as he carefully stood up, he kept his hands hovering around his waist to catch him not wanting a repeat of what happened two days ago.
"Ofcourse sweetheart. What do you want to talk about?" Tony lifted his head from hiding and looked at Steve, timid and shy.
Steve had sat considering their options of how to handle this. He was internally raging and needed to go a few rounds with a punching bag but he couldn’t leave Tony alone, besides he didn’t want to. He had finally given in to his lustful desires and kissed the teen, safe to say he wasn’t going anywhere for a while, from the teen that is.
He pursed his lips not sure if anything he would say would help but atleast he finally knew what had been troubling Tony ever since they were back.
“Tony!? Whats wrong baby?” steve asked he not so carefully grabbed his hands to still them and  when Steve saw the recognition hit Tony when his eyes turned to meet Steve’s.
Just as I turned around in my minimal efforts to get comfortable again and go back to sleep I felt cool fingers brushing through my hair only to stop at the nape of my neck and cup it and wow did that feel good.
He had to take a breath,  close his eyes to clear his head before capturing Tony’s wandering hands and pinning them to the bed above his head. Steve opened  his eyes to look directly into Tony’s, immediately noting the fear in them
He didnt speak a word ,nor look at Steve the entire ride back to shield. Not that steve was looking either. He didn't know why Tony had gone and gotten drunk or how often he does this. He had been doing well the past month in school, less detention and more focused on his science experiments with Bruce. The two were becoming close fast and Steve was just glad that he seemed to be staying out of trouble.
“they switched out his oxygen mask to a cannula, he’s breathing well. Said something about needing to watch out for infections and cleaning up the reactor casing was said. I am not too sure, but bruce said he will be by in an hour.” Clint updated him as Tony made puppy dog eyes at him to come sit with him so he ciuld cuddle and Steve hesitated a little before he carefully wedged himself between tony mound of pillows and Tony himself.
“I have a few questions for you, will you look at me please?” Steve asked after he had had enough of Tony’s exaggerated chewing.
“I-yeah , that’s fine . But what’s going on? Why cant Tony go home?” pepper asked turning to upraise Tony but now Tony was glaring daggers at Steve ready to argue and dent everything Steve was asking of them.
“Ms Jones, can you hear me?” he tried as he gently shook her shoulder but she didn’t show any signs of waking up.
“Come on baby, help me out here. Tell me what’s happening" he looked pale and Steve was getting worried
Tony took a half step back when Steve approached him, he was sure his ribs were at least bruised if not actually cracked.
“Uhm she also mentioned that my fever ridden body might be the best thing for you right now" steve grinned, motioning for Tony to come to him.
"but tony" Bruce started but I cut him off. pointing to the reactor and hopping off the jet to get to my lab as quickly as possible.
“It’s just me Tony.” He said quickly as Tony took in his surrounds and relaxed his shoulders. He tried to rub the sleep out of his eyes before turning to look at Steve. Steve held back his sprained hand carefully before he injured it further.
"Hey! Stop that!" I tried to smack the hands away but Nat glared at me and I had to keep still. She gracefully slid of my blazer and undid the top few buttons of my shirt and she dropped to her knees in front of me one hand cupping the back of my neck effectively holding me still and looking directly at me she asked-
“you wanted me here so I wont go to the battle?” he asked him even though he knew the answer and Tony nodded breath hitching
“True, but there are a lot of people on the board, they wouldn’t even need Tony to do anything. Just sit there and take the name" Bruce put his coffee cup down forcefully the sound reverberating through the small shop
“Hey" he croaked and Steve’s heart went out to him. Tony was clearly exhausted and had not slept yesterday after he had sent him home.
“what the hell was that for? ”tony rasped  “for being the stubborn idiot that you are” she said handing out cartons of food to everyone as everyone chuckled while tony pouted .
Steve walked around the corner finding an empty class room and sat down at the desk shutting the door behind before enabling the link on his phone.
"Okay I think we should call it a day then, assuming everyone is tired that is"I looked pointedly at Tony, he opened his mouth to argue but I cut him off "come on babe, let's head upstairs and you can tell me all about the disgusting pasta"I said pulling him up with me.
“I know I can’t promise you that nothing bad will happen but this is what I am made for. My team needs me there, i need you to Understand this.” Tony didn’t say anything,  didn’t even nod so Steve continued
“Get your own” he said smacking his shoulder and Steve grumbled as he walked over to grab a plate. He turned around at the excited gasped he heard from Tony to find him and Clint bent over something he couldn’t see from this angle.
“Clint , did they send back the quinjet?” natasha asked and he shook his head while both thor and Clint cleared the bed so they could lay Tony down.
Tony squeezed his eyes shut and nodded as Steve continued undoing them and let his broad hands settle along his narrow torso pushing aside his shirt letting it slip over his shoulder a bit to reveal the small coffee colored nipples Steve had come to like so much.
“Okay, what was that?” he asked settling at the table and noting all strewn documents on the table amongst lot of empty mugs of what he presumed was coffee.
“Something wrong?” Tony nodded so quickly Steve wondered just how long he had been waiting for Steve to come back so he could confide in him and not tell the others.
“Steve" he turned , still feeling sluggish, to look at the redhead ,as if the world was turning in slow motion “phil has a room set up for you with some warm blankets by the medical bay.”
“Steve you need to get some rest ,he is not the only one that is currently  recovering, head back to hotel for a while.” Natasha tried for the fourth time since Tony had fallen asleep. Until now Steve had been stubborn to do so.
He quickly made his way over to where Natasha was interrogating the man. And stood beside Clint behind the glass watching her break him. It was mesmerizing to watch Natasha work, she had a way with her words that would tear anyone apart .
He quenched his own fear of hurting the boy in his arms because needed to desperately show Tony that he was his no matter what. All this insecurity Tony has been carrying needed attention and it was only Steve that could give it to him.
“okay, next” and tony let out a low whine as he pouted at the prospect of more rules. Steve laughed tugging on a few of his hair strands , constantly trying to keep him grounded
Tony’s baby pink shorts were thankfully not harmed and Steve’s ears burned at the thought and he quickly grabbed hand towels from the kitchen giving one to Clint and using the other to clean Tony up as much as possible .
“I…what?” he was completely unsure where this conversation was going, Steve had no idea about hacking he was not a techie and his mind was still reeling from the look on Tony’s face.
“Few things before we do this okay?” Tony nodded shakily and Steve ran his fingers through his hair to keep him grounded as he spoke
“they told us , the board members , that Howard’s son tony was alive and was kept under witness protection for his own good. They told us it was a need to know basis and only between us board members.”
"I love you, you know that right?" he nodded yes "I just don't want to see you get hurt or let you run yourself down" he nodded again "I know" he said closing his eyes leaning into me.
“Thank you” he said breathily like he was in wonder of Steve complimenting him. He used one hand to cup the nape of Tony’s neck to make him look at Steve.
“yeah , I will go take a shower . How about you get us something to eat?” he asked pointing to the little menu card that was lying nearby the telephone. Tony nodded
“have you eaten?” he asked getting up from the couch and stretching his arms trying to remove some of the tension there.
"Bruce I think something's not right" Steve sounded panicked. I whined as Steve shook my shoulders in order to wake me up.
Tony reached out tentatively and Steve pulled back , he scooted his chair just out of reach for Tony giving him a silent apology.
“And so history repeats itself as you find yourself back in my class” he heard a few chuckles and multiple groans and he smiled back pleased at the cheeky introduction he had managed to pull off.
But tony only looked at him, averted his eyes as soon as it met Steve’s and stayed silent. Steve sighed as he rounded some grammatical mistake on the paper in front of him.
“Is it that bad?” sometimes steve forgot just how smart Tony is. He always sees him as his to protect and forgets that Tony is a genius and that it is going to be okay.
“Humor me" tony did. He ate atleast five bites before pushing away the plate and wrapping his ligs around Steve’s waist and holding him in place. Not that steve was planning on going anywhere.
Steve caught him to stabilize him before he could hit the ground but Tony flinched ,even of it was just a slight flinch , it was definitely there and Steve immediately let him go frowning.
“I don’t understand?” he asked and Tony wrapped his arms around Steve’s neck burying his faace in Steve’s neck
Steve wasn’t sure if what he had done today was the right thing to do. On one hand he wanted to dissipate Tony’s fears that been instilled by rumlow who he was going to kill as soon as Tony falls asleep by the way and on the other hand Steve had just done this with a sixteen year old ,one he cherished and vowed to protect forever when he was just one.
“Steve?” a small voice asked as he felt fingers on his waist moving up under his jacket, roaming his ribs.
“pepper said tony is opening up to you,I thought maybe it was time to tell you, so in case he does come to you , you will be able to help him in the right way”
“You have mentioned him at least five times in the last two days” she deadpanned and she was right, Steve never really spoke about his school to these guys.
Steve nodded towards Tony “ I trust that tony has told you about us" and he waited while they confirmed  and continued “the rest is for Tony to share, that is if he so wishes to do” they were both giving even more confused looks now but Steve had something more important to ask them right now and he was hoping that Tony would just for once agree with him
“The cut on your cheek that disappeared, the occasional absence from school . Thanks for that by the way ,the sub was such a dud! Oh and of course the muscles! “
He shuddered at the thought his face suddenly lacking all the smugness from before ,he pulled Tony’s feet down his fists balling up as he tried not picture the damage he could cause.
But knowing Tony was now awake he said “the quinjet is here , I have to leave now” and Tony pulled back waking up completely
There was a frown that was plastered onto his face the whole time he was listening and when Tony sighed in irritation of how long this was taking,  the doctor shushed him and asked him to stay still.
I am still wondering if Steve should just do it with Tony,  probably help release some tension between the two that's been going around lately.
Steve walked back and forth around the room for a while. He had actually forgotten Bruce and natasha were still in the room with them until bruce came up to him to stop him from pacing
tony was sitting cross legged on the bed, he looked pale and ashy. But the latter was because he still had considerable amount of ash and soot covering his skin. He had his chin resting on his palms, staring at the bland painting on the wall. His eyelids dropped every few seconds and Steve wanted to leave him be and let him get some sleep.
“Tony..” he wasn’t sure what to say. Steve was in shock though, he hadn’t expected it at all. Tony seemed to have hated his guts since he found him sitting outside the gym ,always picking arguments.
The scalding hot water had helped in more ways than one and by the time he came out of the shower wrapped up in a robe that was much too short for him , food was already waiting for them . A lot of it by the looks of it and Steve couldn’t have been happier as he plopped down next to Tony onto the bed and reached for the first thing his hands could find.
“It is, it was. Your dad and the two of us had a lot of fun during those days" she told him and chanced a glance at Steve who was still at a loss of words.
“really?” Steve said his lips tugging in a smile as Tony reached for the wrap and settled by Steve side trying to wiggle himself in between Steve’s arm.
"You are tired huh?" Steve whispered because Tony's breathing was starting to even out. "Do you want stay over tonight? You can tell stane you are sleeping over at a friends? Does he let you do that?" Tony was now mush against him ,pliant and content just laying against Steve's chest. It warmed his heart, as he felt Tony's eyelashes flutter against his skin.
“we are working on something in the lab anyway. He should be okay" Bruce said before  taking a sip of his coffee.
“Steve hey you with me?” Tony asked and Steve found it rather stupid because he should be the one taking care of tony right  now and not the other way around.
“But I am fine! And what is there to talk about?” He asked sulking already at the prospect of talking. Steve sighed bringing a blanket along with him and dropped it on the teens lap.
“That’s an emergency,  I need to get that" he said tapping on his ear to indicate the noise and Tony let go and Steve jogged over the living room for his phone.
“I am not breaking up with you” he said slowly reaching over he placed a hand over Tony’s and Tony turned his palm around his fingers threading through Steve’s
“I am fine,” but before he sigh in relief Tony added a “for now" and Steve’s heart skipped a beat and his eyes wide
He turned to pepper, who was now frantically shuffling around waiting to help “I need you to go let Natasha know that he is going to be fine and ask her to bring us a water bottle in a few minutes. Can you do that?” She nodded immediately but refused to move , her eyes trained on tony  “he will be fine , I am going to help him. But I need you to do this for me okay?” She reluctantly left after telling tony that she will be back.
“school is closed for the next two days, did you hear?” he asked Tony instead because whatever was going on Tony’s head needed a lot more time than a few minutes of attention.
He was expecting to be cut off even before he finished that sentence but this time tony only nodded and opened his mouth sighing softly “ I will be seventeen next month”
Clint was nursing an ice back to his ribs and limping ever so slightly ,some butterfly bandaid holding together a cut on his left eyebrow.
“Sex, will it hurt a lot?” steve wanted to just squeeze him and  protect him from everything wrong in this world.
“Honey, it’s okay” he said as he ran his up and down Tony’s chest and Tony whimpered as Steve pulled his knees apart and ran his palm over the wet material.
As soon as they were out the door, Steve gathered the boy in his arms , “I have you tony, you are okay. We are both okay” he said again and again using one hand to soothe the tremors wracking through his spine. Somehow he didn’t think about what he had just done, but tony didn’t seem to mind as he buried his face into Steve’s chest clinging on tighter. It suddenly hit him, that tony fit perfectly in his arms.
“I just know things” he said smiling smugly at the brunette as he watched Tony put two and two together.
“Wait, are you saying we can just grab the whole lot and take it with us?” bruce asked and now they were all smiling. This is something Tony would be ecstatic about for sure. Atleast there was one good thing that came out of today’s discussion.
“I am done being nice" the nice suit-wearing man said before leaving the room. But Steve was already too out of it from the electricity that was coursing through his body, presumably through the chains holding him hostage.
Bruce sauntered in after a while looking dead on his feet and he had ended up on Natasha’s lap which was an odd sight to see.
“Steve,” it was that tone again that came with natasha voice that made him look up in concern and he really didn’t like what he saw there “we think these are actually Tony’s x rays"
“If this has still not healed it must have been pretty bad" he said his voice just above a whisper as he let the realization sink in.
“No, you don’t get to talk to Bruce about it. Want to know why?” he asked or rather shouted and Tony looked at him eyes questioning “because whatever you say tony , it was still my fault. You were not a day over seventeen,tony you were ,no you are still a minor. And I am the asshole who thought it would make things right if I gave you what you wanted even though I knew you had no idea what you were asking for. And after you asked for stane I felt like it was me who was the actual monster not stane. Me tony , bruce was right. So no, you don’t get to defend me about it"
Steve went first to Tony’s doctor , because he hadn’t been there for the morning rounds and he needed to hear first hand from his doctor about how he was doing. Steve liked this guy, he was straightforward, not judgemental and seemed to truly be concerned about helping the patient. Something that steve had realised was a very rare quality in a doctor these days.
He looked around , eyes wide and panicked until Steve spoke gently to him getting him back to the present.
“Honey, you have to tell me what’s wrong or I cant help you" Steve tried again but Tony just scooted closer to Steve.
Five minutes later and natasha finally wins. “in your face clint" she said as the nurse pulled her needle out taping it with a hulk band aid. She ran her fingers over it to make sure it was secure and hopped up, from the bed patting a pouting clint on his head before heading towards us.
“tony, are you still not done?” he asked knocking on the bathroom door after setting the tray down on their nightstand.
"it's fine j, do your thing!" I nodded and as the mechanical arms grabbed at my gauntlets. Bruce and thor was still looking at me concerned "man of iron, do you need the medical facilities?"
As a publicity stunt, fury had ordered the avengers to donate blood ,which was why we were all here in the city hospital with cameras following us as we entered the hospital wing for the donation. Clint and natasha were so excited ,I didn’t understand why getting pricked and literally having  things sucked out of you was in any way entertaining. But hey, it was for a good cause after all. Thor was besides himself even though he had no idea what a blood donation was ,but fury had promised him biscuits and pop tarts. Bruce on the other hand was sullen, he was afraid the other guy would not appreciate this particular event as much . And then there was Tony, head held high, smirking at the cameras , walking with as much swagger as he could muster. But what gave it away, was the fingers of his right hand ever so subtly playing with the end of his blazer. He was nervous for some reason , but hid it well enough from the watchful eyes of the media.
"He's in detention. What are you doing here?" Since tony was in detention for next hour Steve figured he would get back to read up more on the mission.
But Tony resisted  ,”I’ll walk” he said and Steve started to argue that he really shouldn’t push it but Tony was already walking to the door pushing it open with a determination he hadn’t seen in a while.
“Noo I like it here. He’s so big! Have you seen how big he is? Look!” he said turning his face into Steve’s chest
Steve cocked his head to the side, unsure where this was going as he waited patiently for him to explain “I liked it when you called me sweetheart” he mumbled, this was the softest tone he had heard tony speak in so far and it tugged at Steve’s heart.
Tony  slept,  he slept through the night with not so much as a twitch and Steve had woken up almost an hour ago, it was half past seven. He didn’t dare move and risk waking Tony. He needed to pee, but that secondary.
“the colors are just an added bonus" he told Tony with a wink and he blushed so hard Steve almost hardened in his pants.
“Are you sure nothing happened baby?” he asked once more as he held Tony’s gaze , the sudden neediness was worrying Steve but he will take what he gets.
“What's happening to him?” he asked a little unsure as Clint chuckled at Steve’s expression when tu Tony chose to not believe him instead turning to the two spies.
Steve was awake and talking with the rest of the team settled in various spots in the hospital room before tony managed to barge in the worry showing through his disheveled hair and clothes.
“I’ll tell you what, if you will allow me to,  I will show you how good it can be” he said lowering his voice and reaching for Tony's shirts top button.
“Then , do you agree that something has to be done about this?” Tony nodded and Steve smiled at him sadly wondering if he had scared him too much. But he was not lying and Tony needed to hear it.
"Nothing is going on just like I told ste-" I turned to my left to where Steve was just sitting to find him gone .I looked up puzzled. "Where did Steve go?" I asked confused. Now everyone was staring at me like I was the crazy one. Nat reached over to grab the wet cloth from Clint and wiped my face and neck with it. And damn did that feel good!
“That’s normal okay? You are not hurt , I promise.” He said as he laid down next to Tony,  waiting for natasha to come back because he would rather her do the IV. He just wanted to hold Tony for the moment.
Tony had been exceptionally quiet as they had explained to him about everything they had spoken about yesterday. He looked shaken and Steve had a hard time keeping his hands from not touching him to reassure him.
Steve was in a somewhat happy mood as he made his way over to his class that morning, Tony’s class to be precise and the students were all already in their places. Tony was also there, and Steve heaved a sigh of relief he didn’t know was there when he realised that tony was okay. After tony didn’t show up for two days he was worried that injury he was so reluctantly nursing might have been worse than projected.
“Are you asking me if we are still in a relationship because we fought yesterday?” Tony nodded carefully searching his eyes for something and Steve didn’t know what
Tony didn’t speak for a whole minute and Steve thought, good. Maybe atleast now his too young lover understands how Steve has been feeling. And soon as he thinks that he feels immediately guilty that he wanted tony to understand it.
“I am sorry, I didn't mean for that to happen but I couldn’t stop and..” he was blushing and Steve was just relieved he was talking.
“No. He’s Staying here actually.” Steve didn’t process what he said before the words slipped out in a rage
“thank you , I’ll be back in a few.” He said leaving without even glancing at Tony towards his meeting.
"I am hungry though, I didn't eat my lunch cause pep needed help with her math homework" tony was chewing on his lip looking at Steve through fluttering lashes.
“Sweetheart, are you listening?” He asked after lifting his fingers away completely so Tony can concentrate on what he was saying and Tony nodded again, and Steve could tell he was clenching his teeth. He could hear the minute grinding noise his teeth were making
“I don’t want to be the reason you get hurt or worse….I don’t know what I will do with myself if I am the reason that something happens to you"
"You kill all the fun romanoff"I muttered as she and Bruce left. I wanted until they were gone to look at Steve. He was still leaning against the wall but avoiding looking at me. I stood up leaning against the table, "so…. You are mad at me." I said trying to sound as innocent as possible. Maybe he will forgive me quickly. Steve rarely gets mad, well he gets mad a lot when I dont listen to what he says during a battle. But when it comes to getting mad with me outside of the battlefield, he's not even actually mad. He's always so nice about it. That makes it even harder for me.
“Show me that you are okay” steve sighed dropping his forehead against Tony’s for a second before pushing away to pull his shirt off.
“hey, do you want me to take you home?” he asked rubbing his hand up and down on Tony’s back in slow soothing circles.
“It’s a museum, they are teenagers. They are going to be bored ,theres not much trouble they can get into” Steve tried .
“So you haven’t contacted stane yet right? I know I said I wanted to make sure it’s ok for Tony to stay but ..”
I shall break this man’s bones! As soon as we have finished with this mission, I am going to RIP his flesh-"
“Shall we go?” he asked as he swung his leg over his bike and pushing the side stand up and Tony nodded getting on behind him holding onto Steve’s shoulder for support.
“You thought if I knew who he was and things didn’t go as planned , I would seek him out and kill him.” Bucky finished his face down and arms  crossed across his chest. Steve knew Bucky had to be feeling worse about what happened now, and Steve wasn’t feeling any better and to be honest he can’t seem to worrying what Tony must be thinking right now . It would have seemed like he chose bucky over Jim, when he needed him and still he had called natasha to find out if Steve was okay.
“I will have phil do the paperwork, he will be able to visit you tomorrow” tony looked shocked and he opened his mouth and closed it a couple of times like a fish out of water. Steve would have found it hilarious if not for the situation.
Steve froze for a second his heart skipping a beat and natasha gave him a slight nudge to snap out of it.
But currently steve was beyond seeing reason as he pushed away from the table and ran a hand through his hair . He didn’t see how Steve keeping information from him was relevant or even the same.  He was only trying to protect him and Steve was losing to his temper quickly.
Everyone knew Tony doesn’t do well when he is forced to keep still for long periods of time.  He was constantly fidgeting and drumming his fingers on his knees ,his legs bouncing in place one  hour into the speech. Enough that the other teachers started to take notice. Bruce nudges Steve from where they where all the teachers were standing at the back of the room keeping an eye out .
“that was an impressive swan dive  you did today. Ten on ten I would say.” Tony smirked pulling away from steve and resting back on the chair and steve sat down on the adjacent chair turning it towards his lover.
Five minutes later, all the wires and weird things packed away Tony turned to him giving him a smile his hair disheveled and he had graphite marks all over his face from his fingers.
By the time Steve made it down both natasha and Tony were very seriously working together , natasha holding a bunch of things Tony no doubt had taken out from the oven and Tony had his head inside the machine.
“he has really got you wrapped around his fingers rogers" she said without turning back and he smiled knowing it was true .
“We could have saved this you know” Clint started but Steve knew how dangerous their job was, it was one of the reasons why Steve couldn’t tell his students, they were all just kids. So was tony.
He realized that as he graded the papers that his class had written two days back and Steve remembers Tony working on it while Steve had sat next to him at the island in the kitchen at the tower trying to get him to finish the food on his plate. He hadn’t even hinted he was having trouble with it and Steve has never really had to help Tony or be generally bothered regarding his school work because he was usually excellent at it. Genius and all.
“we are fine, whatever it is ,I promise we will always work it okay?” and Tony sighed relieved and he shifted closer to Steve his hair tickling his nostrils and Steve stood up,  carrying tony still and made his way to his room.
He watched as natasha made it over to the bed, steve suddenly feeling like maybe he should be covering Tony up , but she simply pulled the sheets away from under him completely before tucking it back again around him. She settled on the bed as Steve watched silently , wondering what was happening as bruce followed , with a tray of mugs , steve could see the fumes coming from them. He set them on the night stand and pulled a chair near the bed and settled down.
He looked up  and immediately Steve pulled him in for a kiss. He kissed him hard, passionate, nothing like they had ever kissed before. The pencil in Tony’s hand clattered to the floor and Steve caught Tony’s hand wrapping his fingers tight around his small wrist.
Tony nodded feverishly, mumbling to himself until Steve held the straw to his lips. He took a few sips before pushing it away and moved a hand to Steve’s chest, like he was feeling the material of the uniform and just as his hands skimmed over the laceration Steve winced and tony withdrew his hand immediately.
“I don’t know if we can save this academic year for him, but he is a year younger. So maybe holding him back shouldn’t be a problem" steve hated to even think that. Tony had been doing so well, he was smarter than anyone , any of his seniors even.
Steve didn’t make a move to follow Tony as he walked through the foyer and Tony turned back waving him over to follow him
“Steve he is a minor. What do you think you can do against the law? You cant just waltz in there and take him away"
“Tell me again, how was Stane was involved with your mission?” bruce asked as they drank their coffee that natasha ordered for them all. Steve didn’t know he had been hungry until he had smelt the food and he drank his first cup in under ten seconds.
Steve thought after their conversation in the hallway and with Tony not showing up in his classes, there was something definitely wrong but the next day Tony showed up to class happy as ever even answering some of the questions Steve threw at the class.
“ sweetheart, I am really sorry.” He said breathily ,barely above a whisper against Tony’s lips and before Tony could process he captured his lips again. Tony pushed him away though and Steve didn’t want to but he let go of Tony’s thighs , arms going higher ,skimming over the soft flesh of his hips and settled above his waist . Tony shivered a little and pulled the covers tighter around himself.
He eventually fell asleep but Steve never got to finish his conversation with bruce . He sighed closing his own eyes, allowed his hands to finally still sure that Tony wouldn’t wake up again.
“Its not just because I am worried, it’s because it’s not right. I know you understand that. So why don’t you tell me why you don’t want to fight this?” he felt Tony shudder slightly and he rubbed his palms on his shoulders trying to relax him
“I am not” he said unconsciously bodily leaning towards Steve and Steve knew exactly what he needed.
Careful not to apply pressure Steve ran a hand down along the front of Tony’s pants, and sighed still feeling the hardness and Tony whimpered in his sleep.  What ever drug was in his system had made him drowsy and maybe that was a good thing for now.  He just readjusted his grip on Tony and settled in.
“I am going to go back to shield, find out what I can. You need to get back in there, he thinks you are mad at him.”
“Sweetheart,  come on , I need you to atleast try" he said waiting as Tony finally turned to look at him.
“If you will sit with me in there then yes" he said his lips forming a little pout as he leaned forward and Steve kissed those puckered lips.
“thunder God! Let’s go my man" he said dragging a duffel bag with him. But Steve seriously doubted if there were any actual domestic necessities in there.
“He’s smart, he knows how to hide things from people. The first time I asked him about it he lied to my face and I believed him"
"Can you look at me? Please" tony looked up , steve could see the tremble now taking over his shoulders.
“you are okay" he said softly running his hand through his hair as he took in his saddened face. He was flushed red up to his ears and Steve just let him sit there until his breaths calmed.
“hmm" Steve  said not really listening to Tony and was snapped out of his thoughts when Tony got up from his chair and walked over to Steve his hands wrapping his arms around his torso.
"I am sorry" he said softly. I melted at that, sighing knowing that my grouchy mood had ruined his day as well.
“obie lied to me all these years, I can’t go home. Home is not even home anymore” he said so quietly it tugged at Steve’s heart.
“All is good as long you have figured out what to tell stane” both them watched as tony stiffened, wincing at the name.
“Mr.Rogers!” He turned towards the eager voice, to see pepper waving at him while Tony kept a hold on her elbow , seemingly pulling her towards him.
"He went to bring you a change of clothes from your room." Okay, but why couldn't he just go up to his room and change there? And then sleep on his own bed?
“No, he was too exhausted so I didn’t push him for information.”  Natasha sighed looking somewhat annoyed she said “you can’t coddle him Steve, he needs to tell us what he knows . Or we will be working blind here. Where is he now?” Steve scorned at that , he wanted to defend himself saying that Tony was truly in no shape to be answering any questions but he knew natasha was right he shouldn’t have let his protective instincts take over.
“Steve, you don’t find it odd that they knew to hurt you just enough but not enough to set off the tracker? But the moment the three week mark was over, they let you hurt into unconsciousness?” Steve’s eyes widened at the thought and before he could ask how they had figured it out
"Because Bruce thinks you might be sick and we are taking you to shield medical" oh. On that note, where did Bruce go?
Steve froze , it was the first time Tony had said that to him and the words that came after that confession broke Steve. He took a few deep breaths before pulling Tony away and holding him at arm length “I love you too sweetheart and I promise I am not going anywhere unless you want me to" he said looking at him but Tony’s face told him just how much he feared what he had just expressed.
“You …I..just" he was blushing now and Steve rearranged them so Tony was now seated sideways along the length of the bed and he moved forward till Tony was tucked into his chest his heading resting against his shoulder
“Sweetheart hey, what’s wrong?” he asked as he watched his breath hitch and he tried to pull away from Steve , instead steve picked him up and carried him to the living room couch laying him down and ran his fingers through his hair until he seemed to calm down.
Steve gave a shuddering sigh and nodded heading back inside and just as he was about to open the door she said
"Jarvis briefed us on the battle, is everyone okay?any one of you hurt? "I asked as I rearranged myself to accommodate Tony into my hold.
“I…didn’t …I..” he stuttered and Steve cut him off “pepper is good for you” and Tony’s look of betrayal will probably give Steve nightmares that night but he knew he had to do it.
His concern now increased ten fold, he worried at his lower lip as he watched Tony trying to curl in on himself
They sat in the water until it was just lukewarm and not hot anymore. Steve brushed his lips against Tony’s forehead silently checking his temperature and finding it to be same he reached for the towels handed one to Tony and he left the bathroom to give him some space .
“Steve! Are you okay? There was so much blood and you were not waking up. I tried but Natasha didn’t let me near you . And they to-took you away.”
“Tony” he called out softly, not wanting to close the distance between them just yet. His eyes snapped up to meet his finally and Steve hated that look of unease and sadness they portrayed.
“So this wasn’t just one big dream then" tony said staring at Steve in awe while Steve placed a palm on his forehead wondering if he was sick. He felt fine. Warm, but that was from having just passed out on his desk in the middle of class.
“I’ll see what I can do" he said taking a bite of his sandwich. Tony and bruce have been spending a lot of time at shield studying the reactor and Tony had slept at the base every single night.
“Okay, what’s this new element and how is that going to fix things?” he asked eyes drifting to Bruce and back to Tony
So far Steve’s plan was to barge in, hero style and take the man out of the equation. Okay he had to admit that his judgment was currently very clouded from anger. All the more reason to have involved the spies . Tony would understand, if not then steve would explain it to his much younger ‘boyfriend?’ that this was for his own good.
oh Steve!sweet sweet Steve was laying by my side ,sweat soaked in his morning jogging clothes. I turned my head to the side to give him a quick peck on the lips.
“It will hurt, a lot. And the next time rumlow does succeed in drugging you and If I am not there or if no one is there , things will happen. And it will not be pretty. Are you with me so far?” he asked feeling the wood under his palm creaking from how tight he was clenching it.
“Can you please take your shirt off?” he asked as he picked up his stethoscope and put it around his neck. Steve could tell Tony really didn’t want to and he slowly sauntered over towards him and sat on the bed  beside him.
Neither of them could actually get drunk because of the serum but they had come to like the taste of it.
Tony slowly let go of Steve and he was gently pulled out of Steve lap and onto the bed. He let the doctors examine him wincing every now and then when they touched a sore part.
But it had been two days away from home , away from tony. I knew there was some sort of battle the remaining avengers were called in for. Which meant tony was busy fighting bad guys with bruce and thor, which meant I couldn't get in touch with him until the battle was over and the debriefing was done.
“Try the gym showers, its usually a quiet place. Tony likes hanging around there knowing no one will disturb him when he really has to get work done.” Steve smiled gratefully at him taking off.
he finished saying quietly and it took Steve a while to realize that Tony was trembling again and that Steve was probably going to throw up .
Bruce took Tony’s hand placing his wrists on the inner aspect of his wrist taking his pulse. Someone in the meantime had cranked the ac up and had placed a table fan by our side trying to get the air circulation going.
“He is doing well , give him a couple of hours to wake up from the sedation and we will check his o2 stats and we can take him off the ventilator. Other than that,  we will need to wash out the reactor casing every four hours once he is awake and keep him on bed rest.”
“I’ll take out the cannula,only until he falls asleep again. This level of stress is not good for him" bruce said pulling the tube over Tony’s head and Tony all but threw himself over to Steve while natasha quickly unhooked the bag from the catheter to keep it from tugging.
“okay, Tony. Just let me have one look make sure you are okay and we can pretend this never happened”
After what seemed like at least twenty inventions, Tony finally deemed himself hungry and they both trudged upstairs Tony shooing dummy away from the elevator door as it closed.
Tony was sweating by the time they sat down. He had been adamant about walking without a break even when Steve insisted they sat down for a while.
They spoke to each other quietly for a while, steve carding his fingers through Tony’s hair gently and he fell asleep like that, tears staining his face and head pillowed on Steve’s arm.
“There you go , just like that. You can do this” he coaxed and after a couple more minute Tony’s breathing was finally somewhat relaxed and he plopped down onto the floor heavily listing towards the wall his one hand still held against Steve’s chest.
“You were dead" he repeated again clinging onto Steve’s robe and Steve rubbed his palm along his back trying to soothe him but it was not helping any as Tony’s breathing took a harsh turn and he started gasping for air.
“I hate you" he muttered and Steve chuckled as he manhandled Tony onto the bed and under the covers.
“Woah, steve stop. It’s not their fault , its nobody’s fault! I figured it out  and it’s going to be okay" Tony’s voice wavered at the end like he was second guessing himself
He was wheezing and every breath he took sounded painful and he was swaying where he was kneeling on the floor and Steve knew he was seconds away from passing out.
“NO. You are not leaving. I just got you back. You are not going anywhere. You can stay here in my apartment as long as you want , I wont bring  him here, I will move in with shield for the time being. You are not leaving, let me help you Bucky please"
“Give us a minute" steve requested to the spies and nat rolled his eyes at him  before muttering about getting them food before they both left, clint keeping silent throughout the whole exchange.
"let's talk about this later okay? I promised to go help out the clean up crew" he said nodding, for me to come to him. We met halfway , he kissed my head before walking off. Okay so he was really mad then.
“its called a flash back , sometimes your mind flashes back to traumatic events that you have been through.” Tony made an ‘oh' sound taking a second to comprehend and then asked “do you remember everything about that day?” Steve stiffened ever so slightly hoping Tony wouldn’t notice and thankfully natasha was quick to tell him “let’s hold of on the questions till Steve is feeling a little more like himself okay?”  Tony’s face immediately took on guilt and Steve brushed his fingers along his hair “it’s fine, but for now let’s just eat okay honey?” he said pulling them both upright as they handed over the food.
“we don’t know of any such incidents, we don’t have a continuous eye on him, stane says it’s unnecessary and tony is smart enough to figure it out immediately” that he was.
“He went home,  he was absolutely against the idea of not going home.” Clint and nat scrunched their eyebrows together waiting for an explanation but Steve pursed his lips shrugging his shoulders
“You just agreed to teach a bunch of girls who practically drool every time their eyes set on you.” He deadpanned and Steve rolled his eyes
“Yeah? That actually sounds nice. Have a good weekend.” Steve said, trying to end this conversation and get them moving along towards the fast approaching train.
Before Steve could tell him that no this was something he could actually talk to Tony about he continued
Steve ate quickly and threw the carton away before Tony was even done with half his burger mostly because he was too busy asking questions about their lives and what not which was all very well answered by an evasive natasha.
"She is not your property" now Steve sighed. Whatever was going on, steve didn't like to get involved. Ever. He rarely bothered with such incidents because he believed these kids were mature enough to handle it themselves.
“Agent Coulson!” Steve called for Phil as he saw him walk by the bull pen of the operations department where he went looking for Natasha and Clint.
We waited a whole minute before asking him again if he was okay. He rubbed his palm over his faces as if to rub the weariness out of his face. In the few minutes it took for Tony to regain consciousness the nurse had already removed the needle and placed a band aid . His bag was only half full ,but she sealed it up anyway.
Tony didn’t say anything as he raked his eyes over Steve’s body and Steve tried again “I would hug you, but since my hands are busy at the moment so how about you give me a hug instead?”
“what am I supposed to wear?” he asked scratching the back of his head. Steve tossed his other new underwear and Tony pulled it up beneath the towel and then let it drop onto the floor. Steve’s face flushed as he remembered last night and he pulled Tony to the bed and sat him down.
It took another forty minutes to catch thor up and Steve was happy to see the thunder crackling across the sky as they mentioned the abuse. Steve was glad that Tony not only had him but also the avengers team to protect him.
“what? Why are you guys in a bar? Why did they let you in?!” he almost shouted Into the phone his concern replaced with disappointment and irritation that not only had Tony been drinking but that he had roped his friends in as well.
They waited for another five minutes and his eyes slipped closed, tears staining Steve’s shirt as he turned him around so that they could check the reactor. After a while,  it was only Bruce and Steve , who sat in silence as they watched Tony’s chest rise and fall.
His face was drawn in like he was stressed, eyes closed and mouth open as he took shallow breaths. His head was tipped to the side lying on the edge of the tub.  It took a moment for Steve to understand that Tony had fallen asleep here and the blood was from his wound which would have probably reopened because the steri strips didn’t stick just like he had thought.
“color?” he asked and Tony’s blushing cheeks were answer enough but he waited for Tony to say “green" before bending down and kissing the inside of his thigh as he pushed his legs wider at the hips and Steve’s touches becoming a little more rougher as he pinned Tony’s waist to the bed and took him in whole into his mouth.
Steve’s face contorted as he realized that that would mean Tony’s now smooth chest , would be stuck with something permanently in the dead center of it. He wasn’t sure if Tony had even processed it, but he knew Tony had hastily agreed to everything because he feared for his life.
Tony let out a shaky breath as Steve trailed his fingers lightly over his straining shaft and that did it for Tony
“No don’t want to" and for once Steve just let him be. He thought tony had fallen asleep after a few minutes of silence when his quiet voice startled him
Tony’s legs came around Steve’s waist and he clung to Steve desperately, breathing hitching as tears fell from his eyes.
“such a dirty mind , Mr. Rogers" he said his hands gripping at Steve’s shoulders as the needle pierced the skin.
“but you are allowed to look that adorable?” Tony smirked at him and took the few steps towards Steve and Steve shrugged off his jacket handing it over to Tony who put it on without protest.
“steve come on man, give me some tips here" clint asked me. I just laughed shaking my head. “I am just the best, no tricks here.” Clint stuck his tongue out at me.
“It was not your fault , I still feel safe around you. And Steve that scares me even more" Tony admitted his voice small and Steve pulled him into a hug feeling absolutely wretched.
“Only good?” steve asked him holding in a smirk and Tony blushed a small smile playing at his lips and Steve’s mind relaxed finally.
He wasn’t sure why tony was here, stane had made it clear that he would be forcing tony back to boarding school.
Tony had long eyelashes. Steve couldn’t help but stare as he slept through the afternoon lips parted slightly. He, on the other hand, couldn’t get even a wink of sleep as he lay awake fingers dancing across the pale skin of tony's thigh that was wrapped around his own.
“ minor concussion, some bruises and a sprained wrist. Obadiah should be here in an hour to take him home"
“Slow down, and the sooner you tell me the faster we solve this , so that you don’t have to tall about it anymore.” Steve said holding onto Tony’s upper arms on both sides
“They are really nice” she told him but Steve couldn’t put his finger on what seemed to put her off about them.
“I know  you didn’t , we all know you didn’t. We are just trying to figure out if he was keeping tabs on you without you being aware of it" he said gently and Tony’s shoulders fell as he relaxed back into Steve’s hold suddenly finding himself seeking the comfort.
“Relax, I wont tell anyone. Besides I think you are good for him. Keep him grounded , you know?” he said smiling.
steve face softened as he looked at Tony’s,like actually looked at him. He had been going through this all alone and Steve was being an ass. This was not the time to be angry, and he hated himself for that being his first reaction. And Tony probably knew him well enough and that’s why he had kept it from him.
“Can I stake a shower?” he heard an unsure voice pull him out of his reverie. He gave a small smile nodding “I’ll get you some clean clothes. Towels are on the drying rack.” He said getting up to go grab some of his clothes for Bucky.
“Finish that sentence and I’ll make sure you will stay here an extra day" steve interrupted him and Tony gasped
“Steve, put him on the couch. Shouldn’t let him sleep like this, wake him up, he will have nightmares if he sleeps after this"
“Don’t call anyone, I am fine” the words left his mouth in a rushed manner and he turned away from Steve before he added a “please”
He trailed up slowly behind them , peeking over to see what they were eating. Tony was halfway through his waffles , the chocolate syrup had soaked through now, making them soggy.
apparently tony thought everything was Steve’s fault this morning and Steve smiled , always he wasn’t freaking out yet.
“Honey, come on. You know you agreed to it all when you agreed to the surgery" he said plainly and Tony looked at him puppy dog eyes and pout full force
"How did you both get here, should I have someone drop you?" He asked and they both shook their heads resolutely lips pursed.
Steve kissed his forehead and pulled away carefully ,tucking the blanket Clint had brought from their room around him.
Clint nodded “the blast shook the train a little, but no one inside it was injured. An agent is driving her home as we speak.”
He had to wake Tony up, he wanted to talk to him before he was under the influence of the anesthetic and didn’t know what was happening around him.
“Can you tell me what’s wrong?” he asked ,his voice just above the shrill of the monitor beeping incessantly.
“Of course sorry natasha" thor said slapping a hand on his shoulder which almost had the bowl she had in her hand tilling over and she glared at him.
“Bruce and me will be fine. What I want from you is to only take care of yourself, I told you yesterday that we will be talking about your lack of self preservation”
it was a nice change of pace, sitting together eating. Steve was through with his salad before tony had even taken a single bite of his burger. That may have been because he was too busy asking questions about them and lucky for him and Clint, Natasha did most of the answering, evading questions like a pro.
“Okay, where is the jet?” he asked as he fished out a toothbrush and some fancy looking paste and soap.
“yeah, just need to walk it off.” He was feeling better just really needed a good stretch before he could help the team.
But every ounce of hesitation vanished when Tony smiled at him dopily and Steve worried for a second that he was back on morphine.  But Tony reached a hand out and steve took it cautiously .
Steve sighed rubbing the weariness that had creeped onto his face with his palm “okay, I am going to come get you guys. I don’t want you drinking anymore. Eat something if possible and please stay put until I get there. Do you understand me?”
“Kay, but I have to get to physics” he said sitting down his lips still a flush red and inviting. Steve shook his head slightly to clear his head and nodded
“hey hey, I will see you in school okay? But not tomorrow, you need to rest sweetheart. That’s all I meant . Okay?”
Clint and thor were on breakfast duty. They had been gone for about twenty minutes with a promise of bringing back something for the rest of them. Bruce had already woken up  and showered ,it was one of the perks of being at shield medical,  all facilities were always available.
“I know you don’t want to hear me say this but someone who has sexually harassed you is as a minor is not family” he said firmly.
“No , you were getting restless and the other teachers thought it might do you some good to leave for a while" he said nipping at the little bit of flesh between his shirt collar and his hair .
"huh? Nothing, just got a little overloaded with energy from the squiggles, but I switched it out, so now it's perfectly fine" he said nonchalantly before abruptly kissing me.
Jarvis, as if reading my thoughts said quietly "it's half past 3 pm sir. You have slept for over 14 hours. Captain Rogers went for his morning jog 4 hours ago and joined you in bed again about one hour ago"
“Yes fellow comrade. I am indeed fine. I just wish I had gotten here sooner as I would have thundered the people who captured you.” He said and there was a distinct sound of rumbling thunder to be heard outside and tony gave a little gasp as he turned to look out the window.
Steve didn’t stay a minute longer than necessary after the screen shut off with orders from fury to get home as soon as Tony was in condition to be transported.
What steve didn't know was what the circular opacity was in the center of the sternum , just at the location of the heart.
When tony refused to answer, both clint and Phil silently left the room pulling the door closed behind them , giving the two some privacy.
“They knew you were okay , everyone knew . Except for me ..I don’t know if I can do this anymore. I can’t do this" Steve’s emotions scattered like a million humming birds and he took a step closer to reach out to take his hand and tell him it’s going to be okay and Tony pulled his hand back and still didn’t look up to meet Steve’s eyes.
“Sweetheart, come here" he said pulling Tony upright and settling him between his legs just like the night before.
“I don’t know, he seems to be responding well to me and our memories together. I just need to get him to snap out of whatever this is.”
He had his legs tangled with the sheets away from Steve’s own and was currently occupying more than three fourths of the bed lying almost horizontal ,only his torso and face tucked up against Steve.
“spies don’t knock” he said , and the three of them watched as recognition hit tony as his eyes went wide and his mouth twitched not knowing where to begin.
“Either you let me have a look to make sure you are okay, or I am calling your parents to have a chat about your incident today.”
Once steve let him down , he wobbled a little on his feet and held onto the couch until he could kick his shoes off and sighed from the relief
The next time he came to, it was much more pleasant. The air around him didn’t smell burnt and the fog around his mind was cleared. He pried his eyes open, thankful they had left the lights at dim or Steve’s enhanced retinas would have burned.
“so anyway, we got food” Tony was never given the chance to dwell as Clint held up two boxes “salad or burgers?” The look on Tony’s face was comical.
“Huh.” It was clear Tony was not satisfied with the answer but Steve was just glad that this conversation was over atleast for now.
“Do you really think pepper is good for me?” Steve groaned , taking a step back finally looking tony.
“Is he alright now?” he asked wondering if maybe he shouldn’t have brought the fancy (and also apparently very expensive) chocolate mousse cups for him as an apology.
"I was just passing by and saw him sitting here. Came over to say hi, and then noticed his eyes" steve immediately crouched down beside Clint hand going to Tony's chin tipping it up.
“I am not planning to tell anyone.” Steve sighed “I meant I can’t keep watching you get abused and do nothing about it”
“Why the hell did you bring Tony here?” second things second. He glared at both of them but all he got were concerned looks.
He lined himself up next to Tony’s smaller cock and almost came then and there when he realized that he could probably fit Tony’s entire length in his palm
Steve lives a dangerous life, anyone who was associated with Steve inevitably ended up getting hurt emotionally or physically. It was the job description.
He shook his head clearing his mind and walked behind Tony towards his car and realized his keys were with his wallet and Tony handed them to him but he held both their phones in his hand getting in to the car not waiting for Steve .
“I am sorry, it will get better. Do you want me to draw you a hot bath?” he asked and felt Tony nod but before he could remove the sheets ,natasha and Bruce burst through their door. Natasha didn’t look impressed but Bruce froze at the doorstep at what he was seeing.
“Do you want to go spar? Break some of that tension , it will be good for you” clint asked as he cleaned up and Steve nodded “I do, but I don’t want him to wake up alone” he said pointing to Tony
“I know that already,  but things changed for me last month after I realized that even Captain america can die”
It took almost another hour for Steve to round up the meeting. Fury was annoyed for most of it, thanks to Steve's sudden disappearance. It had extended and wasted everybody's time.
He knew that this relationship was going to be different from his other ones. Tony was a lot younger than him, he had to be patient with him. Especially with the abuse and such, steve knows and yet he had failed him.
“I got you , sweetheart. You are okay.” He mumbled a few more things until he felt the timid shoulders relax under his hold.  Steve was just glad that he was still clinging tight to him rather than push him away. He took it as a good sign as he held on tight.
He pulled him closer willing his dick to stop reacting to Tony’s words pulled the covers up over both of them settling Tony against his chest. It was a tight fit on the couch but it was comfy.
He had a few cuts and scrapes on his arms and he seemed to be favoring his left leg. Steve took a step towards him and Tony pursed his lips and promptly took a step back. Hurt and worry marred Steve’s facial features before natasha called out for him.
“sweetheart can I see if you are alright?” he asked tugging the comforter away from his body but Tony pushed his arms away trying to get away from him.
“No don’t tell me to calm down. Because mr adult here thinks its okay to let someone sexually abuse him, he thinks its okay to let someone hurt him and that I have to watch and do nothing about it! Are you really that stupid enough to think I am going to stand by your idiotic decisions to ruin your life?” steve was breathing hard face flushed in anger
“you know tony stark?” Steve felt an eye roll coming, as he wondered what sort of trouble he was creating again.
“What intel?” he asked eyes zeroing in on steve and he sighed as he motioned with his hands towards his still pasta clad hair
“Tony let’s go, the train is here” she said as she turned and boarded and turning around only find that Tony hadn’t followed her.
Tony for his part looked absolutely terrified as he reached out for Steve again , raising both his arms towards him. Steve understood what he wanted but he couldn’t give it to him right now, not with all the things he was connected to.
"Steve! Natasha! Welcome back" Tony said surprised to see us, he walked towards me and plopped down in between me and Nat.
Somebody dragged a makeshift chair towards Steve and he gratefully sat down on it before looking up at natasha and Clint.
By the time Steve finally laid his eyes on the teen , he was pent up with nervous energy which he had realized was just the need to see for himself that Tony was okay because now Steve knows what was happening at his home and that he was going to be feeling this everytime Tony was at home.
"He's been really over working it,and his eating habits are getting worse." Nat said as she picked up the glass of orange juice tony had not touched.
“Let’s go, to the nurse” he said pointing with his thumb behind him and tony immediately pursed his lips, stepped around Steve “I can go by myself, thanks” and he was off before Steve could even blink.
“He is quiet the smart alec, I’ll give you that” Clint said walking by Steve to lean against the pillar.
“its cold, don’t go” Tony said making grabby hands at him and Steve gave him a few more minutes to cling to him before he really had to leave.
”you with me buddy?” He asked after he didn’t get a response from the teen even after a few seconds and when he tried to push the teen back onto the bed, he was met with resistance.
"what happened to your reactor?" I asked already panicking. I saw Natasha sit up straighter as well.
“I was talking about the ones under here” he said as he reached for Tony’s shirt and lifted a little and when Tony didn’t protest he tugged the shirt over his head dropping it to the floor.
“is he going to be okay? Maybe we should get a doctor to see him” steve smiled knowing Tony wouldn’t be able to see it with his head up.
“And of course this information is not yours to keep" she said just before she let the door close behind her.
Clint got along with the kids so easily , if he didn’t look older, people would have thoughth he was just part of the group.
Tony looked surprised when Steve waved a bowl of ice cream in front of his face as they settled down onto the couch, tony immediately pushing himself as far as possible into the couch.
“Tony” she said softly “you can stay with either me or Steve, I’ll leave it to you but you are not staying alone today" and Steve glared at natasha like she had just done the worst thing possible.
“I am not lying to him anymore. He knows” Steve said tersely “actually, he figured it out” he received unimpressed looks from the assassins.
“Okay I have never seen her be that comfortable with anyone before" he said staring at the back of the couch like he could actually see them through it and Steve chuckled as he grabbed his own coffee and sat down .
“That is definitely a solvable problem" Steve said grinning as he revved the bike before moving forward again.
“You stink” he said his nose wrinkling and Steve chuckled before he just wrapped his arms around him again squeezing him tight before letting go.
“That’s great to hear, I am happy for you. Does that mean I won’t be seeing you at school anymore?” Steve couldn’t deny that even if he was happy for Bruce, the thought of his only good friend here at school might be leaving was saddening.
“No needles please” he said and Steve relented as he dropped the suture and needle back into the bag holding his arms out and Tony relaxed.
Tony was already gone to sensation and Steve rubbed his thumb over the leaking slit and that was enough to get him over the edge.
“so the best way to avoid gym is by sitting out in the hallway?” Steve said and Tony defensively picked out a hall pass for the nurse from his pocket and showing it to him said
Steve knew  he was a teenager and emotions run wild so he had been careful around him trying not push any buttons. Shield agents still followed Tony around to keep an eye on him and that was enough to keep steve sane .
”I am not so sure you can handle a bike ride at the moment” he said and tony frowned at him after they were seated and buckled in.
He made a quick detour to the mall, he hated going there normally because people would stare at him and it was harder to hide there. He spent almost a half hour picking out the best running shoes he could find.
“Yeah, feels good to be out here finally” he sighed as he cuddled closer closer to Steve seeking the warmth.
They had changed him out of Steve’s clothes and put him in a hospital gown, he looked small in the big bed with an IV attached to his hand.
“I am here now aren’t I? And you are still not doing so good honey" he said gently and Tony refused to look at him
“Hey, look at me” tony didn’t budge and Steve tapped him with a finger on his IV clad wrist until he looked up
“oh, shit!” he pulled back and fumbled with the covers until he was safely under them his hair falling on his eyes as his cheeks turned a beet red.
“Can you watch him for a minute,  I’ll go get him a shirt" she smirked at him turning back to watch tony and Steve quickly went up to get one of his shirts for Tony to wear since they double as pajamas for him and they come down to his knees anyway.
But Steve’s fingers had gone cold at the thought of Tony having a bad heart and that thing lodged in his chest and never having known about it. But ofcourse all this is could be very much un true.
“What were you thinking steve?” steve only held up a finger to his lips and pointed to the couch where Coulson walked around and the look on his face was definitely worth it when he saw Tony and natasha practically cuddling. The widow never let’s anyone that close.
Steve wasn’t particularly disappointed  at how this conversation had turned out but then again he hadn’t exactly expected something else.
“What the fuc-" it was cut off by a loud scream followed by a whimper Steve immediately recognized . His heart racing as he ran out of the kitchen towards the scream. He froze on the spot as he saw , saw Bucky holding Tony by his neck his shoes a feet off the ground. He was clawing at Buckys fingers wrapped around his throat.
“I have planned some very important things actually” he put a finger under Tony’s chin lifting it up so Tony would look at him before kissing him long and hard. Tony moaned as Steve slid his tongue along his teeth and pulled away holding Tony back at arms length.
When Tony’s back relaxed once again and his toes unfurled , steve dropped another kiss on his now sweaty hair
“I need to hear it tony” tony grinned at him cheekily all traces of their previous conversation forgotten and bit his lower lip
“Sweetheart, we haven’t even scratched the surface” he said smirking when Tony stared at him wide eyed and shocked.
“I have a pair of boxers in the bag" he said shy and playing with the discarded paper Steve had pulled off the steri strips from.
“cap, how is he?” Clint asked as Steve made a quick stop at the interrogation room where they had the guy. Natasha and Clint were going over some files as Clint chewed on a sandwich noisily.
“Think he had a nightmare" steve told them and natasha moved onto Tony’s right reaching out to touch him.
He had felt awful about the last part of their conversation but was just as worried for Tony, panic attacks especially multiple ones did not just happen at random . there was always a deep seated reason for it and to think that Tony had suffered one had Steve’s heart rolling in turmoil. The only information he got on how Tony was doing was from pepper, his girlfriend or whatever it is that they are, when she came to thank him after class the next day for helping Tony out and had said that he was feeling and doing much better. Steve was happy , he really was but he couldn’t help but think something bigger was going on here.
They were X rays of somebody’s chest, that much steve knew. He read the name at the bottom of the sheet, cooper milind, age :3 years
Steve ran a hand, trying to rub the weariness away from his face ,natasha was right. It might help them understand what was going on within the company. But right now, the problem felt more personal than company related.
“Steve  aaah" he moaned head trashing back trying to arch off the bed but unable to ,the monement just making him thrust into Steve’s mouth.
His eyes landed on a cautious smile , “nat" he cringed at how raspy his voice sounded suddenly remembering what or why he was here , sitting in the cold. He looked down, to find tony asleep, head on Steve’s chest. Fingers grasping tightly at his shirt ,lips parted lightly .
“Obie says I have to go back to boarding school” he said , looking square into Steve’s eyes, and it was worse than pointing fingers while accusing.
tony was not happy by the looks of it, as nat gently thumbed the area she had injected as tony stared at it like he could will it away.
before either of them could address it, the door opened , Clint and Natasha pushing their way through holding take out containers. They froze at the scene in front of them, Tony’s hand frozen above Steve’s now bare chest.
“Bucky, let go of him. Hey Bucky look at me come pn" he said his voice trembling as Tony started wheezing . But Bucky didn’t even glance at Steve his focus solely on the struggling boy.
He sighed rubbing a palm over his face and settled in waiting for Tony to wake up.  He didn’t last even fifteen minutes before he had to move to the bed and embrace the teen as he slept on.
“if he wakes up and finds me gone , he won’t take it too well, I have never seen him like this nat. Not even when rumlow drugged him” he said as he stretched his limbs and joints.
“I am perfectly fine, no more blood okay? Just lay down for a little while. Close your eyes.” He said his fingers brushing through his hair but Tony wouldn’t have it .
Steve was thankful that they actually listened to him for once. He quickly reached over feeling for her pulse that he found was slower than normal.
“What is it?” he asked moving to place the bowl away but Steve just guided the bowl back onto his lap before he could set it down. Thankfully tony didn’t even notice and just took another spoonful.
“Steve give him to me, come on. You need to take care of yourself before you can help him" he didn’t want to let go, what if Tony fell into the water again. “steve , hey! Snap out of it"
Steve taken out of his own reverie as he realized he was being preached by Clint, the one who is always joking around and never things seriously. That’s when he realized how terrible he must look for Clint to actually drop this face and get serious with Steve. He smiled gratefully at him , and took the towel Clint offered offered him.
“I come bearing gifts!” he said trying to look more enthusiastic but it was obviously failing. He handed one out to each of them before grabbing one for himself and steve scooted over and patted the extra space on the bed for tony to join him. Steve was sat propped up on pillows and Tony carefully wedged himself between Steve’s non broken arm and sat drinking his smoothie.  Twenty minutes into a lighthearted conversation among the team tony started sagging into steve his head tipping onto his shoulder. Just as natasha had said. His body slowly giving in to the exhaustion. Nobody mentioned it as steve carefully took the smoothie from tony and placed it on the adjacent table and rearranged both of them so that tony’s head was now laying on his chest his hand brushing through his scalp easing him into a more relaxed state. His breathing was harsh now , sounded like every breath he was taking must hurt. His skin burning to touch,His fever had definitely spiked. He gave a suppressed cough his hand covering his mouth trying to hide it.
“Hey" he said knocking on the door getting their attention and they both turned giving him a irritated look and Steve held up his hands mouthing ‘sorry' . He had apparently distracted them from something important.
Tony squawked trying to get out while Steve used one hand to hold him there and the other to get the shampoo bottle open.
“look at me.” Tony didn’t “come on , hey" Steve going on his knees in front of Tony so they would be face to face
“Okay, thank you” he said politely and thor understood that Steve was asking for a little privacy. He left quickly after one look at himself in the mirror.
He turned around offering a hand to Tony but Tony stood up and took a step away from him before brushing his pants from sitting on the dirty floor.
“this is so embarrassing” he whined after a few seconds and Steve figured that he must be feeling better.
He wasn’t wearing a shirt, but Steve could see the material of his pajama pants peeking out from the sheets. One look at the adjacent table told Steve the story behind the lack of shirt. It lay there on the table , dried stains of what looked like oatmeal. Either tony had spilt it over himself or he had thrown up on it. He really hoped it was the latter.
“Mr Rogers can you please explain the last portion of the class to us once again? We were quite confused”
”please stop” he said looking down , he was clenching his hands again and Steve reached out to stop him from hurting the injured hand further.
Tony sighed “hmph" nosing Steve’s torso and then he pushed himself up , the covers falling from his shoulders and pooling around his waist. He squinted at Steve through the light.
Steve was honestly embarrassed to hear about his capture from thor because there was always this unspoken competition between the two about their strengths.
“You know Mr.Rogers, it would be nice if you could share with the class how you gained super healing abilities” and then Tony was looking up at him expectantly and Steve panicked.
“water?” steve asked holding the cup up in front of tony and he took it with shaky hands , steve allowing him to take his time as he carefully removed the straw and drank straight from the cup most of the water dribbling down his chest.
“you feel that?” natasha asked softly but voice firm enough to penetrate through his mind and Tony nodded against his chest as Steve continued to rub his back.
Steve chuckled and finally turned towards him , he used one hand to card through Tony’s hair once before kissing him on his lips softly.
Day five they had touched ground and Steve had managed to get Bucky in his apartment without incident. It wasn’t until there was a knock on the door that had Buckys eyes go glazed and focused laser sharp as he headed for the door while Steve was in the kitchen trying to put together something to eat that it all went to hell.
Tony flailed from the sudden unexpected movement trying to hold onto Steve so he wouldn’t fall face first to the floor and gave an undignified shriek.
Tony whimpered at the intrusion his breathing picking up again and Steve gave her a pleading look as she made her way over to them. She sat down on the other side of tony , fingers find his hand and holding on firmly.
"How did they even let you in? Did they not ask for an ID?" He found it hard to believe they let Tony in, what with his doe eyes. The same eyes Steve fell for, he had to remind himself.
“You are doing so good sweetheart, can I pull this down?” he made sure to let Tony know everything that was happening so as to not startle him and Tony appreciated it even though he felt like a child in Steve’s hold
“Okay, so its settled then. We are going to have so much fun once you are not sick anymore buddy" Clint saying smiling at him and Tony gave him an unsure smile.
Tony’s breaths completely evened out in a few minutes and Steve eased the mask off his face. He carded his fingers through Tony’s hair just holding him close. He wet the cloth in the bowl of water they had placed and wiped the grime and soot off Tony’s face.
but Tony’s breathing was not calming and he was still gripping Steve’s arms in a death grip and Steve’s heart was breaking as he gathered the boy into his arms lifted him and sat on the bed with him on his lap.
They stayed out with the team watching a movie and dinner was a huge affair what with Clint ordering every food group possible.  Tony would have been used to large birthday celebrations,  what with being a billionaire and all that.
One night of good sleep and Steve knows he can talk to him tomorrow about everything that they discussed.
“Uhm, I am sorry. We really weren’t planning on it , but Tony called us and he seemed really upset about something and we just wanted to make sure that he was okay so we thou-"pepper rambled on nervously her voice edging on panic
“ you are still a minor. And might I remind you about a certain blonde named pepper?” Tony puffed his cheeks exhaling the air
“You volunteered” bruce cut short and Steve smirked at both of them before giving tony a once over. He had been doing that a lot lately ever since he collapsed from exhaustion. He wasn’t yet fully recovered and Steve felt responsible and guilty .
“I am telling you nat this kid is just different. He is a genius, and even though he's been in this school less than a month he’s already one of the most popular kid in this school.”
“Let’s go , come on” he said to Tony motioning him forward but Tony stood rooted in place playing with the Bill’s in his hand. Steve took two large steps towards him and guided him out to the car with a hand on the small of his back. Neither Steve nor Tony said anything as they drove back to shield. Tony’s cheeks still flushed and his gait was stiff as Steve walked him in towards the conference room and sat him down in a small office next to their room.
“Tony, hey wake up" I said lightly tapping his cheek. He stirred a little , a small whine escaping his lips.
“I will but you need to calm down Steve this is not helping anyone” bruce said ever the voice of reason but for the first time it didn’t make Steve feel better it only made him get angrier
“Go get dressed , we have to go to shield. There should be some of your clothes on the bottom shelf" he said sitting back against the headboard and watched as Tony found them and put them on. He left the dog tags on, under the shirt and Steve had never been more pleased.
“Clint and nat , but they don’t know the details. Well natasha might” he said remembering the catheter in the hospital amd Tony’s almost violent reaction against it.
Steve’s body went rigid underneath and Tony didn’t dare breathe afraid of what Steve’s reaction was going to be. He kept his eye ls on his fingers dancing on Steve's arm as he saw natasha get up dropping the bottle on the table in his peripheral vision.
He shook his head as he remembered those little fingers that closed around his index finger when Steve had first held Tony after he was born before the fated accident.
He let him drink the water and then reached to unbutton his pants and Tony squirmed unable to actually move because of the pain.
Even if steve did know what it was like to be that age he was still disappointed with Tony for having roped in his friends.
“Arms up” he ordered and tony slowly complied, his face only a few inches from Steve’s own as Steve wrapped the bandage around his torso. He kept his eyes fixed on his own hands very acutely aware of Tony’s eyes burning a hole through his head.
Tony sat next to him throughout the ride and Steve was just glad he was not asking him any more questions as they rode the bus in silence together.
Tony struggled even more at that, he is going to be so angry at us after this. But it's okay, he will be okay.
They nodded in unison as thor stood up , “I will do everything I can" he said and left before giving Steve a rough shoulder pat.
Steve shared a look with the other two before the guy mouthed to Steve “He will be here in four hours”  and they left silently pulling the door closed behind them after promising tony to get something for the pain.
steve frowned, he pulled Tony away from him to look at his face, why did they think he would need a hospital? Tony’s eyes were still unfocused and he was sniffling every now and then but it didn’t seem that bad.
“Okay baby, now pay attention to what I am saying, Can you do that for me?” he asked as he watched him struggle to comprehend.
Then there was me, I had a bruise covering my jaw much like natasha,  a couple of cuts here and there but another two hours and most of it would  have healed completely.
Tony shook his head eyebrows puckering “I am going to say something now and I want you to listen before you react okay?” Steve told him as he moved his hands from Tony’s shoulders to the arms of the chair be cause what he was going to say was not going to be pretty.
It seemed to take him a moment to focus and Steve explained to him that it was Natasha ata the door. He stiffened immediately when Steve yelled for her to come in.
“He’s going to be fine steve , but like I said it’s a long road to recovery and he needs this now, if he doesn’t do this tomorrow,  there might not be a him after that" that shook steve and Clint to the ccore but it also helped accept the surgery.
“did I tell you that obie made me stand in the corner for an hour when I broke the tv remote? I was so bored and he told me if I moved from there then I wouldn’t have legs to stand anymore. He was a big meanie”
“I know that, but it’s been more than two years and I haven’t once been able to even…its embarrassing”
“Yes! Oh my God yessss" he said as he sat up on the bed straddling Steve and bent down to kiss him properly.
“I need to get away for a while.” He sad sitting on the floor hands clenched in his hair as he tried to control his breathing
“You are supposed to be the level headed one" he said accusingly and Steve winced already knowing what was in that envelope.
Tony pursed his lips and it was just adorable in a forgive me kind of way “sorry, thanks" he mumbled and was off to wherever he was headed to in a hurry.
Speaking of Thor, there was a jolt of thunder that shook the quinjet. None of them were even phased by it, if there were civilians on the jet right now, they would have probably shit their pants.
Tony cursed , jumping down to retrieve it and Steve stayed perfectly still wondering if sleepwalkers were supposed to be so aware. Tony just calmly climbed back up and resumed tinkering with the now faceless microwave.
“Go take a shower Tony,” he said pulling his shirt over his head. Tony watched him as he walked around the large room to get to his closet , pulling out a faded pair of pants.
Steve spent his next class on reminding himself that he needed to really take a breather. The kids in his class looked a little terrified of him today, possibly heard about his mood from the previous class. Word travels fast in a school corridor , that much Steve was aware of.
Teenagers. Steve refused to sigh, as he turned to raise an eyebrow at his still seething boyfriend. He was red in the face and still glaring refusing to back off.
“Howard used to put up a out of order sign board on the elevator , to keep obie out" he said chuckling as he remembered
He pulled his legs away from her wandering hands like the touch burned him “I am not going with obie, I want to stay here with you”
Lying there in his pants in a puddle of his own blood Steve wondered just what amount of injury the tracker considered was severe enough for it pick up on it. Because he knew he had been lying in his own filth trapped in a dungeon , hands bound to metal shackles that had a constant blue glow similar to the tesseract around them.
“I love you and I am sorry you are currently angry with me for not telling you about stane sooner" he said wiping away the residual tear stains on his lovers face and for once Tony smiled back and returned the hug.
Clint looked like he wanted shoot an arrow through stane and natasha was glaring daggers at him. Fury sat uncomfortably between the two.
“yes please” Steve said and pulled the covers down that was surrounding tony still worried because tony had fallen into an exhaustive sleep when he generally denies sleep every chance he gets.
“Why are you giving them to me?” he asked still looking at the metal and Steve tipped his chin up so he would meet his eyes
He trailed his fingers along his chest , stopping at his nipple and thumbing it gently and giving it a squeeze.
Steve would have never thought he would ever have such strong or immediate response to anybody’s touch but with Tony nothing was imminent.
“That's Mr.Rogers to you” Steve tried lightening the mood but tony worried at his lower lip suddenly irritated with Steve
I walked in after punching the code into the lock pad. Tony motioned for me to sit on the Chair in front of the desk.
tony mulled it over for a second like it was the hardest decision to make and nodded eyebrows scrunched up all serious
Steve didn’t stop , he kept two fingers in feeling the heat and the velvet soft lining , he used his thumb to massage the rim from the outside.
“You just listen to his heart okay honey? He is right here with you, nobody is going to take him away from you and if anyone tries , he will have to go through us first.” She said and Tony’s breath hitched just as the tears began to fall.
“Tony, it’s just me sweetheart. You are okay" tony relaxed against him , leaning back against him trying to get the kinks out of his neck. Steve wrapped a large warm palm behind the nape of his neck kneading the muscles there.
Pepper hesitated for a moment and fidgeted nervously before she said “we were kissing in the men's room and the next thing I know Tony says he cant breathe and I told him I will call for help but he said it would be okay , and that I shouldn’t. So I tried to help him but I didn’t know how and then I came to get you.”
she nodded tugging on Tony’s legs to straighten them , running her fingers over the pants to make sure he wasn’t hurt anywhere they couldn’t see. “We were told to release him in the care of one Obadiah stane after”
“I don’t he’s coming buddy.”clint said finally getting his needle removed and a thor band aid. He flexed his biceps ,to make the bandaid pop, and pop it did,l. The nurse gave gave an exasperated sigh as she removed another thor bandaid before taping it in place. “this is the last one Mr.barton,better hold on to it" clint snickered at that “yeah,yeah" he said brushing the back of his hair as he walked over to grab the snacks.
Her entrance was accompanied by a smirk followed by an annoyed scowl when she saw the scene in front of her.
Steve pulled a blanket over the two of them and pushed Tony further into the bed. "I think you need to get some sleep. We will continue this once you stop looking less zombie-esque."
“So where do we start?” steve asked as he kept an eye on Tony’s bowl below him as the contents very very slowly disappeared into Tony’s mouth.
Tony was nervous. That much was clear to Steve seeing as how Tony tried to stall with every which way he could imagine as steve tried to get the teen to get in his car, which steve had natasha drop off to school.
I looked down at him, he was dutifully ignoring this conversation , which made me even more nervous.
“Steve?” he was so surprised to hear Tony’s immediate response that he ended up pulling the little device out the voice in his ear jarring him.
“Good, can I put your cannula back?” he asked as he helped Tony gulp some water. It was not a panic 'attack' attack yet but Steve was determined to stop it here. Tony for once was cooperating fully as Steve slipped the cannula under his nose.
“okay, take care” Bruce said and Steve smiled at him gratefully before heading over to inform the principal that he won’t be in for a day or two after, Perks of working for shield.
"we can probably Transfer the excess energy onto a different receiver" he nodded looking at me intently.
He then took a quick detour to the cafeteria , bought a water bottle and a sandwich and headed back up to class. But his heart stopped for a moment when he entered his room and found it empty.
“What?” he asked trying to look down at it like he suddenly remembered that it was there and Steve lifted his palm so Tony can see.
Steve was hesitant to leave him. But this had to be done so he nodded and Bruce left after injecting something into Tony’s IV.
Tony’s eyes were already drooping thanks to the effect of tramadol. Steve was actually hoping Tony could sleep for a while. The haunted look from exhaustion was breaking Steve’s heart.
“Did stane-" natasha started but cut herself off running a hand across her face. It was rare that she was ever speechless but she knew Steve hadn't asked this yet and he probably didn't because he didn't want to know the answer.
“There you go sweetheart, you can do this. Come on , nice deep breaths for me” it took a while, but eventually Tony’s breathing turned into something less strained and not just wheezing. Steve let go of his hands and prompted tony to sit up straighter. But when he didn’t Steve reached out again
"Morning" I grumbled as I got up to head to the bathroom to get a ,well lets say late start to the day as Steve puts it. As I got up I felt the world tilt slightly and I stumbled
“I’ll get you food , you sit here” he said pulling her towards the large couch in the communal area. Nat smirked at Steve and he had fight the urge to roll his eyes again.
“I admit I have been better.” He said smiling again but Tony looked so worried and all Steve wanted to do was hold him close for ever.
“can you please make sure he gets home safe?” he asked mind finally calm enough to think with at least an ounce of rationality.
“you run out of clothes to wear?” he heard natasha ask Steve as he headed towards the kitchen to get her some water.
Something about how oddly domestic this was seemed to relieve Steve after his month long capture. Everyone on the team had their own way of dealing with things after a particularly bad mission , they had long learnt to never question and to just be there for each other.
“I distinctly remember being told by the medical staff that you need to be off the foot" he said pulling Tony away from her to ease the pressure on her leg.
It was funny ,Steve laughed to himself as he thought about how he was basically hanging from chains, covered in blood and filth and sweat since two weeks and all he could think of was that he didn’t know why rhodey and pepper had not sat with Tony in class . Well he did have enough time to mull over why it had been in his thoughts and he had concluded that it was because he knew Tony had two very reliable friends when he was not there for him. But it worried Steve to no end thinking what if they were still on bad terms. He chuckled again and one of the goons, that is if you can call him that when compared to Steve got up and walked over to him with an irate look
“Do you think whatever influence they have on you, or had, was what made you lose your control after seeing that day when Tony came to see steve after he had brought you here?” bucky looked confused like he didn’t understand what she was getting at and Bruce looked even more confused because he didn’t know about what had happened that day.
“Kay okay. Geez! What time do you leave?” he asked clutching tightly at Steve’s wrists so that he wont lose balance.
“Here" nat handed them both Styrofoam cups and Tony pouted when he saw his didn’t contain coffee like Steve’s did.
“well , he and Tony probably had quiet the night then huh?” Steve smacked Clint with his pillow before getting up and and pulling his robe around his shoulders.
Tony had told him about the sexual abuse and then Steve had proceeded to stroke him into orgasming and stane would know and would have heard everything.
“And the best way to avoid it is by sitting in the hallway?” He asked as he subtly looked at the kid head to toe, trying to figure out where he was hurt other than his ribs which was obvious from his posture.
Tony was blushing, he was red all the way down to his chest. It was adorable and Steve wanted to kiss every part of him. He pulled away, as tony sat shy all of a sudden as Steve pulled the blanket over the teen and guided him to lay down.
