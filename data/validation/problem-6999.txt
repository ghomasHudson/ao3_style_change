Steve snorted, but he still had a worried edge to his expression. It made Tony feel kind of warm inside. Or maybe that was the venom. Hard to say. “And I’m sure he’s very sorry.” He cleared his throat. “You were really brave by the way.”
“Gods, I was so--” Stíofán moved just in time to catch Tony as he collapsed, his whole body stiffening. He held him tight while he waited until Tony shook it loose.
He’d been right of course. Peter had taken well to the arts as much as his other lessons, though he still hated French grammar. Mr Rogers kept him in check, firm but fair and with a level of kindness Tony hadn’t found in the previous tutors he’d hired. Mr Rogers seemed to adore Peter almost as much as Tony did, and he would often find them laughing and playing as they learned.
The beast swiped again, this time a claw caught the side of Stíofán’s face, tearing a burning line down his cheek. Stíofán growled, slapping it away with the shield.
Then he’d met Peggy and she was...amazing. No one else mattered after that, and he’d been sure they’d get married and have a family, and with that, no one needed to know.
They rounded the edge of the canyon, coming off their horses to afford them some stealth. Steve looked over the encampment trying to spot any sign of Tony. He couldn’t see him, but he saw a few of Hodge’s men sitting by a fire, another few keeping watch.
But that had worn off rather quick at the sound of Steve’s heavy breathing behind him as they crawled along.
“Actually, he made it,” Bucky chimed in, ignoring the death-promising glare Steve was giving him. “Come on, open it.”
Mr Rogers looked a little shamefaced. “I never meant to cause any alarm. I only intended a short walk for my luncheon.”
“Ok? These are like, art gallery good. Don’t undersell it.” Tony gestured to one of them. “I think you might’ve taken a little artistic license with me though.”
“I know,” Jarvis told him, rubbing his furry head against Tony’s chin. “You’re under a lot of pressure. I understand. But come. Food first, then we’ll tackle the next problem.”
He waited impatiently for the guard at the platform to open the door and accepted the alpha’s hand down so he didn’t slip on the stairs.
“A very big huff. Maybe I’ll be so dissatisfied, I’ll forget to start breakfast and you’ll have to go to the housebuilding, hungry, lamenting if only you had mounted--”
“Yeah, it got you alright. But Timber rattlesnakes often give you a warning bite before the venom, and they’re not too dangerous for adults. Your Dad should be ok.” He looked up at Tony. “You alright?”
As he started across the street, he saw a flash of movement out of the corner of his eye and turned his head to see Natasha coming down the street at pace. Sam made his way over, and he expected their usual exuberant greeting after time apart, but instead she gave him a quick kiss before taking his arm and making a beeline for Steve.
“Only if he lets you,” Pepper told him, hand on her hip. Her voice was getting higher the longer the argument went on - a sure sign that she was seriously concerned. “What if he’s some awful tyrant and keeps you locked up?”
“You… made me a sexy joke calendar?” Tony asked very slowly and Steve looked like he was about to spontaneously combust.
“Dad’s already freaking out about me moving to the West Coast. Can you imagine how he’d handle it if I moved continents?!”
“Oh my god, oh my fucking god,” Rhodey babbled into his ear. “What the actual fuck were you thinking?”
He pushed himself up and out of bed, hurrying to the small window to peek outside. He watched as the Sheriff saddled up his horse and took off down the road.
The wood moved, several of the thick beams popping free and Stíofán leapt forward with his heart in his throat, trying to grab the kids as they tumbled off. The wood clattered as it fell everywhere and the kids disappeared from sight.
“I got to go in ten minutes, I need the refill now,” the man at the other table grumbled. Steve rolled his eyes, and shot Tony an apologetic look before heading over to pour coffee into the man’s mug. Tony hoped he’d come back, but once he was done there was a shout from the kitchen and Steve wandered away. Tony wasn’t too worried this time though. The coffee and doughnut were delicious, he’d definitely be coming back for a return visit.
As he swung himself into the saddle he felt the first patter of raindrops against his face. He felt the worry deepen. He’d better make haste.
“I have to go,” Steve choked out, backing up towards the chopper. He grabbed the handhold and stepped up into the carriage, his eyes never leaving Tony’s.
He finished the last one and looked up at the face of the barely-holding-in-his-excitement kid in front of him. “Yes?”
When it was time to go, Steve walked them home, citing Dodgers leftover energy from the dog park cut short, and Tony agreed, happy to spend a little more time in Steve’s company. When Peter got tired, Steve even offered to carry him, putting him up on his shoulders in a way and making the little guy laugh as he gently bounced him. Tony expected the familiar panic but was surprised when none came. That was...something. Somehow, Peter being two meters off the ground and flailing wildly with joy didn’t seem so scary when it was Steve doing it.
If Tony was honest, he was falling for Steve a bit. Steve, who he had learned was an artist, worked for an animal charity, unashamedly liked Korean Dramas and whose mother was a retired nurse. He also liked working out which Tony could tell without being told.
“And I figured any man who’d eat that monstrosity of a pie must have a heart of gold...and a cast-iron stomach.”
“I think so. He’s strong, and Tony took good care of him and got him here. He’s got a real good chance, especially if we can get the fever to break. The rash is a symptom. The fever is the real problem.”
Although they coupled often, some nights they did nothing at all. Instead, they would lie on the pallet, and Stíofán would tell Tony stories from his home. Grand tales of magic and warriors, or simple stories, like the time he and Buck had accidentally let the livestock free and been forced to chase them across the fields.
“Very much so,” Stíofán rasped, and he tugged gently at the silks. “I’ll be even more pleased when I can see beneath these.”
”Jobs. Well, I say jobs.” Bucky waved a hand at Steve. “Had to take pictures to - you know. Secure evidence. Stuff like that.”
“Holy shit, it runs like a dream,” Sam told him looking impressed. “It took like thirty seconds to get to baking temp.”
Steve felt a surge of love and exasperation. “He’s fine. I saw him when I swung by the house. He was barking like crazy: it’s how I knew something was wrong.”
“It’s lovely,” he told him and watched as the Sheriff’s smile became proud. He stepped out of the buggy, coming around to lift Tony down, his strong hands spanning Tony’s waist and lifting him like it was nothing. Tony couldn’t help the little thrill that sparked through him at the show of strength. The Sheriff sent him in, opting to carry the trunk and bag, and Tony stepped inside.
Stíofán leaned down to blow gently on his neck, feeling Antonius shiver. His own interest was becoming plain, his cock pressing against the front of the knotted fabric he wore, straining between his furred legs. He tried not to groan at the feel of it pressing against the doe’s thigh. “Mhmmm. I smelt your sweet scent and all I could think about was getting you here, mounting you until you bleat loud enough for everyone to hear.”
Tony swallowed down the sense of dread, his society-omega training taking over, and he managed to answer her. “Fine. I've gotten a handle on the cleaning, and Steve taught me how to shoot.” He tried to swallow the lump in his throat at Steve’s name.
“You’re a fucking idiot,” Tony said for the umpteenth time, ignoring the way Steve kept rolling his eyes. “Three fractures! For a fucking plant!”
Tony turned his head and his eyes widened. There in the alley was a group of guys, three tall and one much shorter. Tony’s eyes caught on the shorter one who faced his way, face screwed up in determination. He was glaring at the other three, standing in front of what Tony could see was a bike lying on the ground and assumed was the source of the noise.
“I see,” Tony said, unconvinced. “Well, I expect you will be more careful with your equipment in the future.” But he couldn’t help but be amused. He leaned down and ruffled Peter’s hair, the child laughing in delight.
He’d been feeling a little hot for the last hour though, which he assumed was a sign he should take a break soon. He figured he’d talk with one more couple and then see if he couldn’t get some fresh air.
“Done,” Bruce stifled another yawn. “Right, I’m off to bed. See you later, Steve.” The doctor gave him a wave as he headed towards the back of the house. Steve nodded to Betty, who was in the kitchen making tea, and stepped into the doctor’s office.
He scrubbed roughly at his face before some well meaning tourist noticed and offered help. He felt too raw for other people right now.
Tony was definitely going to try and get his number if he could. The older he got, the fewer non-soul bonded people were on the market, and Rogers wasn’t wearing a bond ring. He wasn’t going to miss his chance.
And really, how could Stíofán ignore a challenge like that? He flipped them, thrusting back in hard and making Tony cry out. “Like this?”
He helped Tony roundup some of the cafe cats into carriers, and took a few cakes from Rhodey who sent them off with a wave.
“Gods, I-- I’d hoped but I--” Stíofán could feel the grin sliding over his face, the happy bubbling of joy in his chest.
“I suggest you take your omega in hand, Sheriff. Someone might think you let him walk all over you.”
It turned out that he was an amazing artist too, bringing landscapes to life on paper. And when he wasn’t drawing his favourite subject - sketchbook after sketchbook full of planes and the dirigible - Tony was shocked to find Steve’s attention fixed on him.
“I’m sorry you’re having such a rough time,” Steve said in his ear. “But you’re doing so well! I couldn’t do what you’re doing. I couldn’t even do what
Tony’s eyebrows raised. He wasn’t usually that friendly with new people. He watched as Steve grinned in delight, petting Jarvis with a firm hand.
The Sheriff smiled, putting on his hat and offering his arm. Tony slipped his hand into the crook of his elbow and started their way into town.
The crowd was almost silent as they watched it disappear, and Stíofán walked back towards the emperor, feeling the blood dripping down his jaw.
Tony sighed. “No, we don’t. Not as long as you ask--” He turned around to address the dog’s owner, “Mr…?” And oh. Wow.
“It’s not just you,” Tony managed. “I want your knot so all those omegas who bat their eyelashes at you know you’re mine, and they don’t have a chance.” The last was a growl, and he felt Steve shudder in appreciation. “This is just for me, and everyone’s going to know it.”
“Fiancé?” The alpha frowned. “I think you’re lying. What kind of alpha would leave his intended waiting on the platform, without a chaperone? No,” he leaned closer and took a sniff. Tony flinched, panic rolling through his stomach. “I think you’re trying to get rid of me. But I tell you, I’m not someone who runs away just because an O is a little shy. I can make you-“
“Course you are. Always scary the first time your alpha gets hurt. It’s not easy being married to a lawman.” Her voice was gentler this time, and he looked up to meet her eyes. “Now, he’s going to need your help when you get him home. Do you know any remedies?”
The punch never came. Instead, Tony’s arm snapped up, gripping the alpha’s wrist and twisting it down until he yelped.
He sat up as Steve moved forward, grabbing Dodger's collar and pulling him back. “Good boy, let it go, come on.”
Steve grimaced, trying to keep himself from thinking about the smell. Serum enhanced memory was both a blessing and a curse. “So are you going to help me or not?”
“Ah, sorry,” Steve said quietly. “It’s been...a really long time since I’ve done anything like this, and what I did do wasn’t much.”
There was a steady pulse beneath his fingers and Stíofán breathed a sigh of relief. This close he could see the doe’s dark eyelashes, smell his warm spicy scent. And the way he’d fallen, the soft fabric covering him up had slipped, giving Stíofán a clear view of sharp collarbones and the long line of his neck. Stíofán licked his lips, mouth suddenly dry. He moved to his storage chest, pulling out a rag and dipped in his water bucket. He knelt back down, and wiped it over the doe’s face, letting the cool water splash gently down his cheeks.
He liked him a lot. More than any other guy he’d met. He wanted to be around him. Even if it was never anything more, being in the orbit of someone else with no agenda, and who wasn’t just going to tell Steve he needed to hurry up and start integrating into the modern world was a huge relief. He just wasn’t ready to say goodbye yet.
in Captain America merch. He looked down at Steve, and then at his duvet cover - a recent semi-joke gift from Rhodey - with a giant picture of Cap’s face surrounded by little hearts staring back at him with that charming smile.
As he was carefully placed on the horse, Mr Stark sliding onto the saddle behind him and tugging him back against his chest, an arm around his waist, Steve couldn’t help wishing it were different.
He stepped down feeling stupid. Why on earth had he listened to his mother? It had been thirty years since her own journey of course things had changed. He skulked away to the edge of the plaza, sitting down on a bench and trying not to panic. What was he supposed to do? He hadn’t heard of it being this difficult for other witches: usually, they showed up, and at the very least people were curious.
“Oh really?” Fury asked, raising the eyebrow above his good eye. “Risky business. I thought you were taking the slow and steady route.”
Steve seemed to like the touch, leaning into Tony’s hands and Tony rewarded his enthusiasm. He trailed kisses over his neck and chest, feeling the twitches beneath the skin each time he uncovered a new spot. “Ticklish?”
Steve read for a half-hour or so before he seemed to notice Tony was tiring. “Perhaps we ought to leave the rest for tomorrow evening.”
He needed them to be back where it was safe and where he could make sure no more harm could come to his omega. Some food and an early night seemed just the ticket.
Steve nodded. “Yeah, the best roommate I could ask for. It used to me and my best friend Bucky, but he got himself hitched and had a couple of kids, so now it’s just me.” He shrugged. “It’s not where I thought I’d be at thirty, but what can you do?”
“Well then.” Tony slid slowly down until he was kneeling on the floor, his palms resting on two muscled thighs. He kept eye contact, hearing the sheriff’s shallow breath. “Perhaps I could-”
It was tiring, though Stíofán was feeling the effect. He was getting stronger, faster, and quickly becoming the best fighter in the
“Flatterer,” she told him with a smile, handing him a flute of pretty average champagne. “You look like you wish you were anywhere but here.”
Now that the need was gone, he felt a little embarrassed. He’d said many things, but had only thought them in the heat of passion. Now it felt as though the doe might think him callous now that they were no longer joined.
“Just because I still look good covered in bruises doesn’t mean it’s my go-to. But thanks.” He picked up the magazine on the counter and looked at it again. “It’s a nice picture Steve.” His voice was soft, and Steve felt it like a touch on his skin.
It felt all the more foolish now that he’d walked so far to escape Mr Stark and his kindness and charm. If Steve didn’t already know he was an incredibly unattractive match, Mr Stark’s expression at seeing him weak and sickly would no doubt do the trick. Steve was under no illusions that Mr Stark would ever want him.
He saw the alpha dip his head, and suddenly there was a hot, wet suction on his nipple, and he hissed at the sensation.
All Tony had was a sore eye, a life-or-death situation, and no idea if Steve would even care or not when he heard the news.
Tony took his fee, tucking it into his pocket along with the little box of cookies Laura gave him, making him promise to visit again to return the container with a wink.
Mr Rogers stood excitedly greeting a man in a bright soldier’s uniform. They knew each other, the man’s touch on his shoulder far too familiar for an ordinary acquaintance.
“That’s nice. Have any of those overinflated omegas invited you for tea? Took them a year to offer to me, and by then I’d already decided they weren’t worth knowing.”
“What can I say, I use a lot of energy around you,” Steve replied, running a hand over Tony’s thigh. It was tempting to keep going, keep the motor running until they were ready to go again, but Steve was hungry and Tony could remedy that.
“Yeah, it’s been a long day,” Tony agreed, tucking into his bread and groaning as the sweet jam hit his tongue. So good.
He felt the scratch of Steve’s beard as he pressed a soft kiss to the back of Tony’s neck. “That’s been clear to me since you compared me to a grunting hog. I couldn’t help but think about what a spitfire you were.”
When he thought about it, Tony was pretty sure the first time he had realised he had it bad for Steve was when he watched him stare down a guy who had yelled at the waitress and refused to tip her.
“Well, at least it’ll be the nice kind of gossip,” Tony offered, feeling a thrill that his alpha seemed to appreciate his looks. He and Jarvis had clearly chosen well in his arrival clothes. “I don’t mind being the talk of the town.”
“No, I was just worried about both of you. I’ll make sure to apologise to Daddy. Don’t you worry.” He bounced him on his hip. “How about we go see if the tea house has any cake hmm?”
Tony nodded. “I keep her memory alive for him. So that he might know her, even if he is left with me as a poor substitute.”
He picked out the outfit Jarvis had chosen for him. A pair of his nicest flowing trousers, black heeled boots and a wine red embroidered tunic. He’d forgone his corset - it was too hard to lace in a small lavatory - but he thought he cut a nice figure nonetheless, so hopefully the Sheriff wouldn’t notice. Lastly, he pulled on his travelling jacket and hat. There, that would do.
It wasn’t too big, it wasn’t too small, and when he landed near the edge of town Tony was delighted to see it was bustling and full of life. Yes, they could do well here.
“Tony!” God, there was so much yelling, Tony thought, and then there was Steve picking Peter up and swinging him out of the way. Once he was clear, Tony felt a tug under each arm as he was dragged out of range.
“Great! Let me go grab my purse and we can go.” With that she headed down the hall, slipping into a room four doors down.
Tony was staring at him with something in his eyes Stíofán couldn’t identify. Then he punched Stíofán in the arm.
“Mr Stark,” Mr Rogers says and looks at Tony intently. “Although it would of course be nice to see him, I think perhaps you are under a misapprehension. Bucky is my friend, perhaps brother may be more accurate as we grew up together as children. But I have only a familial affection for him, no more.”
Tony’s eyes flitted to his and Steve felt his cheeks heat. He ducked his head, trying to concentrate on Jemison’s fur in the sun.
“It’s a stupid name,” Steve said seriously and Tony snorted, running his free hand through Steve’s hair before he kissed him again.
Steve tore through the tents, slamming into one of the alphas who tried to run. He was edging towards feral. He could feel it: something that alpha’s rarely experienced outside life or death situations. He should try and draw it back, but he felt himself leaning into it. That rage would get him to Tony faster.
He helped Tony to his feet, letting the doe take him by the hand and lead him behind the kitchens, hidden mostly from sight. He pushed Tony up against the wall, his hands already wrapping around those hips that were becoming softer by the day. He undid the knot of his wrappings, pulling out his cock, and pushed up the back of Tony’s shift. The round, furred buttocks looked so plush and inviting. He’d never get tired of that sight.
It did not explain, however, his sudden preoccupation with Tony. Before Lanova he considered Tony a valued colleague and friend. They sparred, played three-dimensional chess, and often ate together -- the latter had begun as a command from Captain Fury for S’Teve to ensure Tony ate regularly instead of skipping meals when he was caught up in his work, but it had soon become a simple tradition, in which S’Teve brought food for them both to Engineering and they would sup together when their schedules allowed.
“Sorry, I didn’t see you there,” he said, trying to regain his composure and feeling a little embarrassed.
He sighed. It didn’t really matter that much, he guessed. No alpha wanted an omega that looked like him anyway. Small, slim, delicate - that was the type of omega that alphas wanted. That was very not much him, if the building he’d been thrown through last week was anything to go by. Not to mention the fact that he’d never been able to hold his tongue, not even when he was still a little guy.
“It’s ok,” Tony told him, patting down the fur. “Life just moves a little faster here I guess. We’ll get used to it.”
“Fainting satyr,” Stíofán managed, the pieces clicking into place. “He’s a fainting satyr. He was down longer than you usually are.”
Steve hustled Tony out of the clinic, and he had him in a room eating a hearty bowl of soup within the half hour.
“Yeah of course,” Steve said, reaching into his pocket and taking out a red ball. “You want to try to throw this for him?”
“I’ll let you unpack while I settle Daisy,” he said, scuffing his boot lightly against the floor. “Welcome home.”
Tony let out a sob that surprised even him, and in an instant he was surrounded by alpha. He clung to Steve, all the stress and worry seeping away, until all that was left was a resounding relief he felt all the way to his bones.
They were not in love of course, but Tony felt they already had a fondness for one another –far more so than any of the alphas he’d met whom his parents thought would be a good match. It was his ticket away from all of this, and rumour had it that society in the West was less rigid than in the East, something Tony hoped might mean he might be able to forge a path for himself.
He dressed in a fine white top, with a pair of deep red trousers that opened wide at the ankles. He put on his daintier heeled boots, the height making him feel graceful.
And they’d only grown closer since Stark Tower had become Avengers Tower, hanging out in Tony’s workshop, watching movies, going to baseball games (more for Steve’s benefit than Tony’s), and going out for food.
On his back had soon become amongst Stíofán’s favourite ways to mate, the doe’s face as Stíofán moved inside him was almost breathtaking.
“I’m not sick. I was just bone tired. I feel better this morning, less like my heart is ready to leap out of my throat.” He sighed. “I was worried we might lose him. Our only pup. And I--I know I haven’t been able to…” he petered off, unable to speak past the lump in his throat.
The sign was as they had described, but was propped up with a slight gap between the edge of the sign and the roof, and as Steve looked at it, he calculated the angle, the force, and deduced he could probably set it right with a good shove.
“Are these happy tears or sad ones?” He asked, his tone light, but Stíofán could see it was a serious question.
“Stop! I cannot listen to this speech again,” Tony whined. “We’re all very grateful you fought the terrifying manticore! But that does not help me make horseshoes!”
Inside was a man seated at one of the desks, cleaning a pistol. He had brown eyes, and a dark, well sculpted beard, kept much shorter than Steve’s.
Tony looked at the bike, along with Steve’s proud grin and the brown leather jacket he’d clearly bought for riding, parked in the backyard of the bakery. It was a pretty hot image he had to say.
Peadar reached his arms up to loop around Stíofán’s neck, rubbing his horns against Stíofán’s. “Sorry Da.”
Stíofán nodded and pushed himself to his hooves. He helped Tony up, brushing a curl behind his horn. “I meant what I said. I love you.”
He excused himself from the people he was speaking to and made his way over when Jan beckoned him with a wave, coming to stand by her and giving Tony a charming smile.
“Jesus Rogers, if you’d keep your head out of the clouds we wouldn’t be able to mess with you,” one remarked, tone mocking. “Think less about what’s up there and more about how dangerous it is for you on the ground.”
“Oh good, good.” The sheriff pointed to a large-ish building ahead of them. “Come on then, Let’s go speak to the clerk. Also, if he makes a fuss, I do apologise. People in this town have been waiting for me to get hitched, and my making a match with an out-of-towner, especially one so-” he looked over Tony who felt himself preen at the attention, “if you don’t mind me saying, Mr Stark, so beautiful. It’s going to cause quite a stir.”
It hit him all of a sudden too, what he had done. Travelled across the country to this new place, leaving his friends behind and knowing no one but his new husband, and he felt the combination of desire and despair mix in a perfect apprehension, even as the pleasure rolled like a wave.
“A 1942 Harley-Davidson WLA Liberator. It’s, uh, vintage.” Steve had learned early on that word was basically a free pass.
After the announcement, Stíofán followed the others to get cleaned up. He washed the dust and sweat from his body, even as the complaints reached his ears behind him.
Tony followed him out, watching the two lawmen gallop off before following Steve’s advice. He tried to go back to sleep, but he was unable to drift off, so as soon as the sun was up he got out of bed to start the day.
Bucky scowled, tossing a handful of mud Stíofán’s way. “I’m going to treat my doe like a queen. And I’m going to get fat on his cooking, you’ll see. All does are good at it and his Buck said so when I asked to make the match.”
“You’re going to be fine,” Tony told him fiercely. “I have made you armour fit for the gods, and you will be fine. We will walk out of here together.”
He frowned, shifting to go back to sleep, but the heat was right against his chest, and he opened his eyes reluctantly.
“It could,” Steve agreed. “But I promise I’ll always do my best to come back to you. I won’t leave you if I can help it. And if something ever goes wrong, Bucky and Sam will help you, Ma too. You won’t have to face anything alone.”
“Don’t worry yourself, Mr Rogers,” Deputy Barnes said, patting him gently on the arm. “Stevie just got a little...lightly stabbed.”
Tony purred with the compliment. “Well Pepper thought you were going to be some scoundrel setting a trap for innocent city folk, so I’m glad she was wrong.” He linked their hands where they rested on his belly. “I certainly lucked out, getting the handsomest alpha in the town though. Seems to me we’re a perfect match.”
She rolled her eyes but grabbed her toilet bag and opened the door. “I’d ask if you were raised by wolves but that would be the worst kind of self-burn.”
Tony snorted as he realised it was a picture of the bartender Carol as some sort of terrifying goddess, gesturing at a crowd of dogs with huge puppy eyes. One dog in particular was a lab with floppy blond hair.
He gave Steve a farewell wave - he had to hurry along so he wouldn’t be late to meet up with Rhodey - but the exchange made him smile for the rest of the day.
“Sure, fair’s fair.” Tony let Steve sit up, and dragged off his own shirt, and then jeans for good measure. Steve followed suit without hesitation, though it was obvious he wasn’t used to stripping off for this kind of scenario.
Perhaps the extra bedroom might become a space for guests. It certainly wasn’t going to become a nursery at this rate.
“Yes sir,” the man replied, gesturing to another and going out the exit to the stairs. Pierce pointed to the guard who had hit Tony. “Bar the door. He’s not getting in.”
Steve’s eyes went wide as he caught the shift in Tony’s voice. “Figured it would be a surprise. Does it look good?”
Stíofán stroked faster and licked deeper, until the doe spilled onto the wall, panting and gasping as his knees gave way. Stíofán caught him, tugging him down in his arms and holding him as he shivered.
“You seem to be operating under a misapprehension that you’re in charge here. Let me tell you, if you don’t start being more helpful, I’ll order Rumlow here to start shooting civilians.”
Tony snorted and opened his mouth to joke back, when he caught movement out the corner of the eye. There was a face peering in the window, lit by the warm glow of the bakery in the growing dark of the evening. Rhodey caught his look and turned to see, smiling wide as he did. “Oh, Steve!”
Steve turned at the voice to see a fluffy tabby cat watching him intently from a pile of books. He blinked. “Uh, sorry?”
Stíofán lowered them down onto their pallet, covering him carefully, his arms holding him up. Tony kept kissing him, slipping his hands under his shift and tugging at the
J.J got in but Pops came to a halt, hands on his hips, head bowed. Dad reached for Pops’ wrist, saying something she couldn’t hear before he pulled Pops’ face into his neck and rocked him side to side.
The Sheriff sat back. “But you weren’t wrong about me not making sure you were safe. I keep forgetting you didn’t grow up here. You’ve just taken to everything so well it’s hard to remember that you don’t know everything. So, we’ll start making sure you have everything you need to survive out here so that if anything ever happens to me, you aren’t stuck here.”
When he reached the Sheriff’s office, he tapped tentatively on the door. It was all well and good trying to make sure his alpha was fed, but he didn’t want to be a bother.
Because there really wasn’t any way to come back from ‘shirtless poster from your experimental transformation in 1943’ with any kind of dignity. He swallowed nervously. “A technically classified image of project rebirth.”
It was a start, and it made Tony feel less hopeless. He helped Rhodey for the rest of the day, greeting customers and trying not to flush as Rhodey talked him up and showed off the new magic till. Near the end of the day people were clearly talking about it in the town, as there was a long queue of nosey people lining up (and thankfully buying bread and pastries as well) up until closing.
He went by the healer to get some of the ginger, making sure to fetch some more meat from the trader. Tony would need his strength when he felt better.
“All done. You shouldn’t have any problems with it now, but if you do I can come back, tweak the spellwork.”
“It’s no trouble. My husband’s an old softy. There was no way he was letting you leave here without making sure you had somewhere to go.” He smiled, and Tony felt himself return it.
Carol smiled. “You’ll understand when you’re older kid. When you meet the right one, they’re worth the wait.”
Steve nodded again. “Just needed to get out. New York wasn’t like I remembered.” Jemison meeped, and Steve reached out to pat her, smiling when she purred.
Tony looked away, “Unless I’m just reading too much into it? You were in heat, and needed an alpha and I was just at the right place, at the right time?” He looked a little sad now, shoulders slumped slightly in disappointment. “I’m sorry. Now that I’m actually saying it out loud, it’s pretty clear I'm just reading way too much into it. I was convenient, I see that now, and I’m just grateful I was there to help you--”
“Sure.” Steve glanced up at him, doing a double-take at the shit-eating grin on Bucky’s face. “On second thought, no, absolutely not.”
“Yeah, about that,” Tony said, taking off his glasses and cleaning them on his sweater. “The motel is...not great, if I’m honest. The owner, Logan, he’s not exactly the cleanest guy around. I’m not sure I could let you stay there in good conscience.” He slid his glasses back on looking a little shy. “So, if you want, maybe you could stay here? I live in the apartment upstairs, so not much of a commute.”
Tony snorted, even as he felt his cheeks heat. Hot engineer guy huh? Guess he hadn’t been the only one looking.
He wandered the backstreets of the town, letting himself actually look. He’d been so harried lately that he’d forgotten to really stop and get to know the city.
Tony accepted the shake, trying to gather himself after the surprise. Now that he had a moment, he let himself look over the Sheriff, the man who was to be his alpha.
“Oh am I?” Tony asked, spotting his prey across the street. “I didn’t notice. Now are you going to lend me your arm, or am I supposed to risk taking a tumble?”
Bucky snorted and Stíofán turned just in time for two bouncing balls of fleece to hop into his arms. “What? These two? No, can’t be.”
“Oooh, can we get pizza? All this daydreaming about luring a pizza guy to his death in the woods is making me crave ham and pineapple.”
It felt a little less painful than those memories usually did, and he thought perhaps it was that he wasn’t sitting alone at a cafe or in his sterile, empty apartment. Edwin and Ana were kind, and he supposed it helped that they were closer to his true age than people he usually interacted with.
“Steve?!” He squeaked out, voice barely a croak. No one heard him, too focused on the scene at hand.
Steve wiggled his eyebrows and Tony’s jaw dropped. “Oh my god. I can’t believe history thought you were some naive virgin.”
Tony cradled the puppy carefully. He was adorable, all eyes and big paws, and he was looking up at Tony with a curious expression. He’d never had a pet before. His parents hadn’t wanted the trouble or the mess. Now he had a companion of his very own.
“What -“ He stumbled at another tremor, only saved from falling by the tight grip Steve suddenly had on his arm. The terracotta pot wobbled dangerously and Tony yelped as he dove forward and wrapped his arms around it, holding it steady. “What the actual
J.J brought in the last of the bags just in time to see Pops give Dad’s butt a pinch and hear him yelp. “Ew guys come on. We’re in public.”
“Shhh, shhhh,” Steve hushed, even as he kissed back fiercely. “You were perfect. Strong and brave just like always. He’s safe, and you're safe, and I’m here. Let me carry the burden for a while.”
Steve nodded, unsure what to say. He felt a little panicked and he had no idea how to explain it with his fabricated backstory. “I’m just a little…”
“The lines have snapped!” The reporter yelped, clearly taken by surprise. The wind is taking the dirigible up into the air. Oh! There’s one rope still in place!”
Stíofán shook his head. “He’s just feeling a little unwell. It’ll pass.” He wondered if he should mention that Tony was carrying but decided against it. Better to wait till Tony was well so he wasn’t peppered with questions.
After everyone had given him all the advice and their best wishes, they made their way out to the back garden. He didn’t have a broom of his own, too fond of using his own creation when he could get away with it, so his mother had given him one of hers, imbued with all the protection magic she could give it.
“You need to go to the doctor’s,” Nat told him patiently, her hand patting his arm. “Come on Sheriff, I need you to get your head on straight, there’s a couple of people who need you something fierce.”
And then he was gone and Steve was lost to the heat, his body desperate for relief. Everything after that was just a blur.
“The best in the village. Now please keep them out here where they frolic on the rolling green hills, trot through the bluebells and--”
“It’s ok. It’s ok,” he murmured, stroking a hand through the dark hair. “I’m here. I’m sorry I went away, but I'm back now. It’s ok.”
Tony quirked his head. “Maybe you don’t have to choose? Maybe you can be happy and still do what you need to do. Work can’t be all you live for.” He snorted. “Well, unless you’re me. But at least mine comes with kittens.”
That made Steve feel a little guilty. This alpha was obviously old money, and no doubt he had a lot of it to give.
The doe looked up at him, gaze heated. “I believe there was something else you said you’d like,” Antonius said, and then his head was dipping down to Stíofán’s lap and --- oooh yes.
“Stíofán.” He placed a hand behind Antonius’ back and helped him to his hooves. “Are you sure you’re alright?”
There was a quiet meep behind him, and Steve smiled at Jemison, eyes finally starting to blur. “I have to go girl,” he told her, giving her a scratch under the chin. “Thanks for looking after me so well.”
Tony nodded. “I know. But you know how he is. ‘Witches use brooms: they’ve always used brooms! You don’t need that newfangled crap!’ Nevermind that my techmagic is more reliable and safer. Guess we’ll just use that wooden death trap. Hope we don’t plummet out of the sky,” he added, rolling his eyes. He caught sight of Jarvis looking nervous. “I’m joking. I’m sure we’ll be fine. It’s just going to be colder and less comfy.”
“What about that one?” Jarvis offered, pointing a small paw at a part of the coastline that jutted out, creating a small harbour. Even from here, it looked perfectly picturesque.
He ordered a coffee and took a seat at a table in the corner, leaning back and letting his eyes fall closed.
“They didn’t know,” Tony shrugged, ears drooping. “The Stables all but promise matches, you only become a slave if your costs can not be regained in a dowry, which they always advertise outside of Rome as uncommon. When the Stables realised my little problem, they opted to save themselves the
Laura nodded, sipping from her mug. “It can be hard when you have other people’s expectations on your shoulders. If you had needed help that would’ve been ok no matter what your dad said, but I’m glad that you managed to do it on your own anyway so you didn’t have to deal with it.”
“Why don’t you get a room at the saloon?” Betty offered. “I’m sure they’ll have one going, and then you’re nice and close.”
He’d been dwelling on it, turning it over in his head, knowing he wouldn’t be able to drop it until he saw his sweetheart again and made it better.
Rhodey put him down, reaching out to take the kid - “Riri,” Sam told him --  and Tony smiled at how proud the two men looked as he accepted praise from the townsfolk cheering around them.
“I’m glad. I’ve always loved cats. Never really been in a position to have one of my own though.” The tabby tilted her chin so he could scratch the white fur beneath.
He could’ve nodded off, happy and warm with his mate in his arms. But instead, a hand slid it’s way down his chest, wrapping around the base of his cock. He kept his eyes closed, trying not to react.
“Let’s see if you can get these buns toasted,” Sam said with a snort, and Tony laughed as he rolled up his sleeves to get to work. Finally, he could be of use.
“Shows what they know,”Stíofán said lightly as he picked up the pace. here would be a few bucks who would meet the ends of his horns tomorrow though, make no mistake. “If you were my roman whore I’d have you hooves in the air and ready for me whenever I want, not working your fingers to the bone at the forge.”
Tony laughed, unable to stop the flush from creeping into his cheeks. “Flattery will get you everywhere Sheriff.”
marking their place, and putting it aside. He took the pup first, putting him into his bed and tucking him in, giving Oscar a little pat when the dog jumped up to lie beside him to keep watch. He gave Peter a kiss on the head and pulled the door mostly closed behind him.
Tony straightened, defiance radiating off him. “It’s not my fault. Your deputy asked to see, and I could hardly refuse.”
“A mate and a kid, you could not make me any happier,” his ma said, beaming. “It’s nice to meet you Tony.”
Normally Tony would feel ridiculous being carried out of a building damsel style, but he was pretty sure he was going to be bragging about being rescued by Captain America to everyone he knew, so really the pictures on the news site would just back up his story.
That underhanded, conniving baker! Tony shoved the basket at Steve along with the note. “Guess this is for you.”
S’Teve wasn’t sure how to respond. His emotions were spinning out of control, and he wondered if this was what it had been like for his mother and father, realising that proximity born from necessity had grown into something more. Because it was true; he did care for Tony, knew he was never truly objective when he was around him. And now that he had more information, he realised why exactly Tony’s dismissal had been painful. It was easier to ignore something when you hadn’t had it confirmed.
He tried to shake off the usual sick feeling soulmate announcements always left him with, and stepped inside for an evening of cheap wine and paint splashed on canvases pretending to be meaningful.
Stíofán rolled to his knees before the big, unwieldy guy got to his hooves. He threw himself over the buck’s chest, clinging to the wide expanse as the satyr fought him. He took advantage of Ivor’s lack of grace, straddling his chest and pointing his sword at the thick neck beneath the heavy helmet waiting for the call. He saw the gesture finishing the fight and stood, his arms out as he showed off a little to the crowd, the bright sun warm of his naked chest, and his fleece damp with sweat.
Steve was suddenly acutely aware of the fact they were in his room alone. He licked his lips. “I’d like that.”
“If you’re in trouble,” Rhodey said, sounding urgent, “I know some people. I can call, try and pull some strings--”
“They’re good climbers aren’t they?” Stíofán said, knowing he was preening and Tony rolled his eyes.
Realisation swept through Stíofán like a wave, anger roaring up from deep inside him. How dare Tiberius go anywhere near him. He couldn’t help but wonder if it was prompted by the defeat Stíofán had dealt him during their training fight that morning.
impressive,” Miss Foster corrected. “Using that kind of precision with just the ingredients nearby was genius. Tell me, what do you know about astronomy?”
“Da, tell a story,” Hugh begged as they sat around the fire, his bowl of stew Tony had made before darting back to finish a few things at the smithy waiting to cool.
Nakia grabbed her to pull her in for a hug. “I can’t believe how well you have done.” She tilted her head. “Actually I can, you have always been brilliant.”
Another quake rocked the floor and Tony clutched the plant tighter even as Steve pulled him back to his feet.
Tony flipped through a couple of pages, snorting at each. He reached July and a braying laugh burst out of him. “Oh my god. You dressed up as Uncle Sam?? This is---oh, I can’t breathe. At least we know you’ll still look good with a beard at eighty.” He wiped a tear from his eyes as he mouthed the words under the photo,
Steve chuckled. “Thanks, I--” His eyes flitted to the side, and his gaze went cold. Before Tony could ask what was wrong, Steve had picked up a peanut from the bowl on the bar and threw it across the room cracking a glass and knocking the drink from the woman’s hand, sending the liquid to the floor beside the bartender. She and the bartender both looked up, and Tony gaped at Steve.
She walked over to the window, watching as they came out the front door, walked out across the parking lot towards the rental car.
Tony thought back. He had seen something when they came in, something large and white near the water, but he hadn’t given much thought to it.
For a minute he wondered if he should ask Steve out, maybe try for something more than just Dog Park Buddy. But being friendly with them wasn’t the same as being into Tony. Steve himself said he worked for a charity, he might be just one of those people that likes to be nice.
“No can do, Cap. Not today.” Tony patted the baby bjorn. “I have precious cargo. Can’t risk getting caught in the crossfire.”
Barely two days since his arrival, and Stíofán had gone to kitchens to fetch him, only to find that Tony had apparently built a way for hot water to be delivered to the kitchen instead of having to fetch it from the large vat outside, and made the water hot faster. Tony had given him a defiant look, but Stíofán had just barked a surprised laugh, getting the doe to explain what he’d done. Clearly, Stíofán hadn’t just landed himself some pretty thing to look at. His mate was smart.
Only a few hours later the Marshall had ridden up, requesting his and Sam’s presence for a posse. Normally he would’ve had time to go home and prepare, but the Marshall had told them they were hot on the fugitives’ trail and needed to leave immediately.
Peter was a constant heat against him, and the struggle of carrying him there had left Tony exhausted. His legs felt like gelatine, and he stumbled, trying to keep his feet. There was pressure on the toe of his boot, and he felt a stab of panic as he caught himself on a stone and went flying forward. He panicked, instinctively rolling his body to buffer his pup against the fall...
– and the big lug had stopped to look at his phone to see a message from Tony. His body was relaxed as he leaned against the fireplace, chest on full display, and on his face was the most besotted expression. It was a good pic. It was a
Steve chuckled as they pulled apart and Tony looked at Peter with a raised eyebrow. “Honestly after all I do for you, I can’t get a little me-time?”
Maybe-George considered him. “You know it’s rare to find someone to date who doesn’t care about it all. Kind of refreshing.” He leaned forward, and Tony found himself mirroring it without thought.
“Like that is it?” Tony asked, voice amused and Stíofán tried not to blush beneath his beard. He was glad it hid his cheeks, having been able to grow it in the longer, thicker style his people preferred now that he was free. Tony kept his short, something widely talked about along with his olive skin but Stíofán had a feeling one more winter might change that if his cold pink cheeks were anything to go by.
He rolled over burying his face in the pillow and fell asleep to the thought of Steve’s pretty eyes.
First, lots of people didn’t like to do it. It was soulmate or nothing, and the idea of putting in the effort when you might meet your perfect match at any time was unappealing. Most dating services focused on it, setting up speed dating events. Thirty seconds was usually all that was needed.
Steve turned to smile at him. “Not to worry. We’ll have that gang trussed and delivered to courts by lunchtime. It’ll be easy.”
As he approached, he noticed many of the does perk up in interest, which was flattering. Stíofán knew he cut a good figure, the years of fighting making his body tight and lean, muscles on full display. He was younger too, still only in his twenty-third year, compared to most of the others who were now old men, haggard and grizzled, though strong enough to put up a good fight.
“Now don’t rush, and don’t just pick any town. Make sure it seems right,” she told him, fussing over his hair and his bag. “Make sure to find somewhere to stay as soon as you can and don’t let people swindle you! Many a naive witch has had their money stolen by a commoner on their journey, and--”
“Anyone touches the doe, hell, you so much as look at him while you’re thinking anything like that and I’ll gore you, no questions asked.”
He wasn’t sure how the alpha managed it, but he kept his face clear of any disgust. He chewed and swallowed. Then he gave Tony a smile. “Delicious as always, sweetheart,” he said, raising his voice to be heard a little over the chatter.
Thanking him, Tony stepped onto the platform, trying not to seem too obvious as he scanned the area. He wished he knew what Mr Rogers looked like. He’d planned to send a daguerreotype with his next letter, along with a request for one in return, but then his plans had changed.
Instead, the sheriff was well behaved, complimenting the meal and asking Tony to read to him. Tony felt relieved that at the very least, Steve still wanted him for the company.
He rolled over, finding the oil lamp and matches and lighting it. The light spilled over the bed and now he could see the problem.
He pulled on his hat, applied a touch of rouge, delighted in Steve’s compliments, and by the time they walked into the church hall, he was feeling confident.
Steve scowled up at him from where he was sprawled against a plush armchair. “Maybe if you hadn’t put me in heels--”
He helped put the cat back in the carrier, and walked Bucky to the door to open it so he could get the carrier out. As he waved, he noticed a car waiting on the curb, seeing it was Bucky’s ride when he opened the back door.
He was absolutely furious. How dare these men come here and treat them like this. If they tried to lay a hand on Pepper again, he’d do more than swear at them.
“So Sam told me that maybe we got off on the wrong foot. I’m a bit of a hothead, so I’m sorry I went off on you before you could explain.”
He slipped under the covers, stretching out and getting comfortable. It wasn’t long before the curtain was tugged back and a faun shoved his way into his arms.
“The food ok?” Steve asked, looking concerned. He’d nearly finished his own by the time Tony was barely a third of the way through.
She tutted, led him to the porch, and let him sit down. “You’ve had a bit of a shock, I suspect.” She raised an eyebrow. “And I bet that dunce of a deputy just sent you out here without thought for what you’d be feeling.” She huffed out a breath. “Some alphas, honestly.”
“Named for the first African american woman in space.” He gave the cat a scritch under the chin. “This gal’s an explorer, seemed fitting.”
Tony nodded, not even sure what he was talking about, but if it was as gentle as his previous ministrations, it would be welcome.
“You laugh but wait till you see it tomorrow. You’ll be amazed.” He looked thoughtful. “Perhaps I could apply myself to the trade in your homeland. I could make us good money.”
Steve turned to look at him, face serious. “Tony, I came to check on a situation only to find you right in the middle of it, voluntarily crawling beneath a broken cart. A broken cart that collapsed not soon after. You could’ve been killed.”
Sam gave him a long suffering wave. “I’ll finish my drink and see you at home.” He sighed, but he seemed amused. “Honestly this is one of our quieter Friday nights.”
“...and so I was thinking I could increase the capacity of the warp drive by -- hey! Are you listening to me?”
These games had come with a twist, they soon found out. Instead of simply fighting each other, a champion from a different Ludus was here, a large, heavyset man by the name of Ivor. He was big, very big, but Stíofán could already tell he’d be slow. He’d looked over the does, a mean smile on his face, and as the one he already thought of as his flinched, Stíofán realised there was no way he would let Ivor anywhere near him.
“This don’t concern you Sheriff,” Hodge spat, and the omega whose arm he held whimpered. Her friend tugged at her arm trying to get her free.
Tony looked up at the clock. Twenty-two minutes past. Perhaps he ought to accept Mr Rogers wasn’t coming. Maybe the whole thing had been a scam, like the ones he’d read about in the papers. He should consider himself lucky he supposed. He could’ve been like that poor woman he’d read about last month - coming all the way out west, being held up by ruffians, and finally arriving only to find her intended was one of the aforementioned thugs!
Steve couldn’t imagine it. Couldn’t make it fit together in his head. “I’m just not sure that’s in the cards for me.”
Tony turned to see the gaggle of omegas he’d overheard at the store. “Good afternoon,” he offered politely.
Steve nodded, looking down and scrubbing the back of his hand over his eyes. “I just want you to be happy Tony.”
“Can’t believe I missed out on a doe, I’ve been here ten years and this young buck just up and nabs the first decent opportunity I’ve had. My balls are about ready to explode the amount of use they’ve had.”
Pops shot in a moment later. “Tony what’s-“ His eyes landed on the envelope in his hands. “Is that-?”
to his people. If only he had never left to trade in Londinium. He never would’ve been drugged by the man he had been beating at dice and traded for an amphora of wine to be a slave in Rome. But it had happened, and now there was only this. Earning a pittance, trying to buy his freedom.
The man beneath the cart’s face was going red as he struggled, and it was that which prompted Tony to action. He ran over, sliding to his knees as he inspected the problem. All the weight was on one side, and every time someone tried to remove any of the boxes, the pinned man gurgled alarmingly. They needed the cart gone, and it needed to be gone fast. He could see underneath the way the wood had twisted with the pressure and came to a conclusion as his brain pieced together the solution.
Because Tony was...well. Tony had been GQ’s hottest alpha three times for a good reason and he didn’t need to do a thing. Steve was just gaming the system.
Tony snorted. “I was mad. But I know sometimes you have to go round up criminals. I just needed to cool off.” His mouth twitched. “‘Sides, I overheard Natasha telling Betty that Mr Bullski is leaving town, and the General Store is going to be under new management. Wonder how that came about.”
They landed a fair distance from where the blob was based, arriving to a large group of soldiers dressed in full tactical gear, and several SHIELD agents. Steve stepped off the helicopter, accepting a salute from the agent in charge, who he recognised as Maria Hill.
Tony tugged at Steve’s shirt until he got the message, pulling it off and letting Tony run his hands over the well-defined muscle. Honestly, it was truly immaculate work.
Tony wiped at his eyes until he could see Steve clearly and gave him a smile. “Hi, I’m Tony. Nice to finally meet you.”
Tony instinctively spread his legs, and the Sheriff slid into place, so that the only thing keeping them apart was the flimsy material of his nightgown.
“You have a nice day, Mrs Bonneville.” He tipped his hat to her, before he turned back towards the station, picking up the pace. He could see the smoke now, which meant the train had likely arrived on time.
The twins cheered, taking off at a sprint to be the first one to grab at the greenery on the newly ploughed field.
“You don’t know that. You could feel fine, but the sickness could be inside you. We must be vigilant.”
“Just a minute, sir,” Steve called to the customer, and then turned back to Tony, opened his mouth and--
Tony ignored him, still mad and unwilling to engage yet. The alpha fell silent, walking dutifully behind him. They made the rest of the trip home without speaking, the Sheriff only stopping to take care of the horse.
Tony went out to the pump to get some water, bringing it inside and dipping a cloth in it. He wrung it out, draping it over Peter’s brow to cool him.
“If I win, you may take any riches I am awarded. I only want the wish the Emperor said he would grant.”
“Oh for -- these are my robes, see? And I have a cat!” he brandished Jarvis wildly, who obligingly meowed in greeting.
“It’s great,” Tony said, and it was. I mean flying was no big deal, but the mechanics of this thing were fascinating. His magic reached for it, feeling it out, and Tony could sense every thrum of its engine. “Imagine how long they take to build.”
Tony sighed happily, soft moans from his lips. But Stíofán wanted more. He wanted Tony to see heaven itself. A thought flashed into his head, of a conversation he’d overheard once between two bucks, both of them speaking of what they preferred when they spent the night with a faun. One of them had waxed poetical about the taste, how you could spread your tongue through the slick and make a doe whimper.
Tony snorted. “A tasty mush, though I was allowed to add a little fig to yours. Fury was impressed with your fight.”
“Oh right. Well, that sounds great. And hey, just saying: you’re an adult. Whatever you and Steve get up to in that workshop is your business.”
What-- Bags? Drawers? He didn’t understand, he knew what he needed and it was slowly slipping out the door.
Steve fidgeted, making Tony more annoyed. “I told you, they’re work trips. I can’t say any more than that, client confidentiality.”
He looked over at where his parents were still chatting with Nakia and T’Challa. “Reckon I can convince T’Challa to say he desperately needs the Ambassador to Wakanda for a week after we’ve gone? Keep them busy.”
