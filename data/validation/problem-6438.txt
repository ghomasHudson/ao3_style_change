"No, no, Steve, just hold on a second," he heard Natasha say from somewhere on his left side. "Let me get it for you."
"That's very good advice, Gwen," said Mr Harrington from his seat over by the bleachers. "No sense in punching holes in your confidence, you'll all be plenty nervous on the day of the competition as it is. I've had quite a few students over the years that end up barfing their guts out into the trash cans right outside the auditorium before the speeches, and that's a terrible time to be tasting your own vomit in the back of your mouth."
"So, how did you get him to calm down?" Steve asked. Despite the horrible circumstances, he couldn't help but admit that he was enjoying Tony's story. He loved hearing about what Peter was like when he was little. "What ended up working?"
"But… that doesn't make any sense?" said Bucky. "He's only a kid! What good does it do to punish a kid for something his grandfather did?"
"No," he choked out. "Or I mean, nothing more than usual. My dads are just out of town on a mission, and I—"
But before he could even finish his sentence, Dad disappeared with a soft popping noise, so abruptly that Peter stumbled forward, barely able to keep himself from tipping over.
Out of the corner of his eye, Steve saw Tony frown. "Um… I thought I'd been assigned to work with Bruce this morning? Something about the funky space lights over Wakanda last night?"
Tony cringed, clutching Peter's shoulder and Steve's hand even tighter as Sam and Bucky attempted to clear a path for them through the throng of reporters and news cameras crowded outside of the hospital entrance. Colonel Phillips had warned them that the news people had been camping out at the various hospital doors in the hopes of catching a glimpse of the Langaran heroes, but Tony hadn't quite understood the scale of it until they stepped outside and were immediately bombarded with camera flashes and shouted questions.
"Yeah, I'm not surprised," Steve said. He tapped his fingers idly against his shield as he thought. Tony was right in that it seemed far too convenient for this all to be just a coincidence, but even that didn't mean it absolutely couldn't be. And if Thor's vision was correct—which he kept insisting that it couldn't be wrong—then his team needed to keep their focus on that.
he thought, blinking as the nanites in his left uniform sleeve quickly reformed into a near-perfect rendition of his shield, complete with a white star in the centre. He immediately raised his arm, wincing as remnants of the target Bucky destroyed rained down onto it.
"Oh, well, that's true," Ned said, giving Peter a rather sheepish nod. "I guess being the son of two superheroes can be pretty rough sometimes, huh?"
He thought he heard Gwen calling his name as he hurried back to the kitchen, searching for a back door that would hopefully lead outside. He knew it was freezing out, and that his jacket was likely buried under about thirty others somewhere in the front of the house, but all he cared about in that moment was getting away. Away from the booming music, away from Flash.
"Well, don't just leave him in there, goddamnit!" Tony shouted after about three more heartbeats. "Get him out!"
Several minutes passed as Peter waited, the bunker echoing with the fierce sounds of gunshots, metal crashing against stone, and lots and lots of shouting. From what he had gathered from the various voices barking orders, Gwen's father was there in the bunker with the rest of the team along with a few other police officers, which hopefully meant that the rest of the world would soon be aware of exactly what had been going on there.
Lorraine also said that the father called because the kid recognised Steve’s name, which could mean a couple of different things.  Either the kid is a spoiled brat who gets everything he wants out of some feeling of guilt on his parents’ part, or he’s an actual fan of the sport and just assumed that Steve would be interested in coaching now that he’s retired from competition.
"That's 'cause he loves him," Peter said softly. He pressed the button on his bed that turned off his overhead lights and leaned back, trying to get comfortable. "Finally Dad has someone who loves him."
"Oh. Well, are you sure?" Peter couldn't imagine why someone as strong as Steve would have trouble climbing a tree, but he wasn't about to pry into something that was obviously bothering him. "'Cause we don't have to. We can pick something else."
"Okay, let's just all try and calm down a bit here," Steve said, holding up his hands. "We don't know where Fury is. This device was found in the street a few days ago, bearing this symbol."
Loading up a tray with a bowl of the hot soup, some oyster crackers, and another mug of the cinnamon tea, Steve made his way to their room to find Tony sitting up in bed, blotting his forehead with the washcloth Steve had left for him.
"Yeah, babe, it is." Tony breathed in as he took Steve's hand. "I knew there had to be something fishy about that new janitor at the school, I just
Steve frowned at the mention of Obadiah. "Well, I can't say I'm not glad that we don't have to worry about him anymore."
"And normally that would be fine," Natasha said. "But Thor seems pretty worried about this, so I'm wondering if you don't want to try and wake Tony up yourself so we can get going. Clint said he can join us whenever you're ready."
“Very good sir.”  A second later a photograph of Brock Rumlow, leader of the STRIKE team, appeared on the screen.  Tony’s stomach immediately did a flip, and he instinctively turned away, unable to tolerate even the sight of that monstrous prick.
"If not tomorrow then definitely the next day," Steve said as he arranged Peter's blankets. "I promise."
The team had come home from their trip to Wakanda both rejuvenated and with a sense of optimism that they had sorely needed. For Steve, though, both of those had only lasted a few days before dread began to seep back in, weighing on him like a leaden cape draped across his shoulders. Every spare moment he could find he spent strategising, sometimes with Sam and Bucky's help but most of the time alone, while Tony shut himself up in his lab, refusing to take off his nanite armour case for any reason and constantly building things in his own attempt to beat back his demons of fear. More equipment for the team, including an upgraded version of Sam's Falcon pack, new Widow's Bites for Nat, and a new bow and hundreds of new arrows for Clint. Then there were the new armoured suits, two of which went to James down in D.C. as upgrades for his War Machine armour, but most used to repopulate the Iron Legion that had been retired ever since Tony had perfected his defence drone design. The Iron Legion suits now numbered close to thirty, at Steve's last count, and had been placed at strategic positions throughout the Tower and Compound's properties, programmed to launch at the first sign of anything out of the ordinary. Tony had even asked Principal Morita if he could station three of the suits at Peter's school, but was turned down when Morita reminded Tony that he would first have to receive approval from the city's school board. Since neither Steve nor Tony wanted to involve any branch of government in any of their plans, no matter how local or small, they had instead settled on positioning two of the suits inside the Tower's roof facing the school, ready to launch if given a signal by either Steve, Tony, or Peter.
And then it got pushed back again after all of HYDRA's wanna-be super soldiers started coming out of the woodwork, forcing Tony to channel all of his attention into developing his nanites.
“Can’t what?  What can't you do?  Dad, it was an accident!  He didn't try to hurt me, he thought he was protecting me!”
"Yep. 'Bout damn time too." Tony glanced down at his chest, watching as the nanites began to flow back into their storage case. "I'll give it a real test run this weekend, yeah?"
"Your pizza order has been transmitted, Master Peter," said JARVIS. "Estimated time of delivery is approximately thirty minutes."
"No, I understand," Ms Sharon said. "I need to go contact Colonel Phillips anyway. I'll come back to check on you in a bit, all right?"
"No, we don't," agreed Steve. He straightened his shoulders, glancing around at his teammates. "I know we're all tired, but now's not the time to give in. Think of it as the bottom of the ninth. The score is tied, the bases are loaded, and the count is full, which means that—"
And Uncle James had mentioned it a few times to Peter as well. As had Grandpa, and Ms Sharon, and a couple of his old friends back in school, but Peter figured that the point had been made well enough.
"Listen to Эем, he knows what he's talking about," Bucky said. "Птер has to do this himself, that's the only way he'll be free of it."
"Okay, now we're just splitting hairs," Tony said. "Regardless of the wording used, you're under eighteen and therefore still under our care. And while you're still under our care, Papa and I are going to expect you to follow the rules that we set down, which, may I remind you, are there because we love you and want you to be safe." He paused, cupping Peter's face in his hands and silently begging him to understand. "Pete, you could've been
"Watch out!" he cried, pushing Sam and Bucky back just as an ear-splitting crack of thunder exploded across the neighbourhood and Thor literally dropped from the sky, landing on the pad in a sizzling sparkle of lightning.
But if Peter at only eleven years old was assisting Anthony with a project that he had designed for the Air Corps, now
Anger bubbled up from the pit of Tony's stomach, threatening to bring his cat food right back up again.
"Wow, Rogers, you really are in a courtly mood this morning," Carol said with a laugh. "What the hell is up with you?"
"No! You can't have me!" screamed Image Peter as the sceptre flashed, with Peter joining in from the bed less than a second later. Tony flinched in Steve's arms, scrabbling against his chest as Steve tried to cover his ears.
"Russian? Why Russian?" Mongolia had its own language with various dialects, so it didn't make sense for everything to be in Russian, unless…
Since Liz had always been especially fond of the lightning round, the team spent pretty much the entire time with answered rapid-fire questions, with Peter and Gwen answering the majority of them, much to the chagrin of Flash Thompson.
A sentiment that Dad seemed to share, given that he was glaring missiles in Dr Strange's direction, who seemed to be completely oblivious to Dad's current state of freakout.
"Copy that," Tony murmured. He glanced back at Rhodey and Wilson just as Steve's comm went completely silent, indicating that he'd broken through the atmospheric barrier. Thirty seconds later both Barnes and Carol went silent as well, just on time.
Peter woke with a start almost as soon as the jet touched down, adorably confused and disheveled and wondering what time zone they were in as the team collected their luggage, waiting for Happy to give them the signal that it was safe to disembark.
Steve shot him a frown. "You're feeling guilty. And don't try to tell me you're not because I can see it written all over your face, and there's just no reason for it, sweetheart. No reason at all. There was no way we could've known that Raxton guy was gonna be at the theatre today when we didn't even know what he looked like."
The smirk plastered across Senator Davis's face made Tony's blood pressure spike, and he took a quick sip of his water, reminding himself that he should probably try and project the image of politeness, at least in the beginning.
And once Peter came along, even though his discovery was one of the biggest shocks Tony had ever experienced in his life, he swore that he would never, ever neglect his own child.
separate aircraft, and managed to build all of those goddamn satellites that are up there taunting you as we speak, so why the hell can't I figure this out?"
The chance to win an Olympic gold medal is a gift, and one that Steve does not intend to waste.  Not now.  Not ever.
"Actually, we waited till the third date," Bucky said, rather sheepishly. "I'd… um… I'd never been with a guy before, so—"
As the weeks stretched on, as the summer faded into autumn and then winter, Steve and Tony slowly grew back together.
“Good race,” Steve says as he holds out his hand towards the scowling German.  Whether he’s won or lost, Steve has congratulated his competitors after every single race he’s ever swam, and has never experienced any sort of backlash for it.  So it’s a bit surprising when instead of taking his offered hand, Schmidt shrinks back from it, staring down at it like Steve has suddenly been riddled with a horribly contagious disease.
It felt like at least an hour had passed by the time Steve regained some semblance of feeling in his limbs, finally peeling his eyes open to find his husband's lust-blown brown eyes watching him, his chin resting comfortably in the curve of Steve's pelvis.
Steve leaned back against the bench seat in the back of the Quinjet, his shield tucked next to his feet as he slowly breathed in and out, trying to find some semblance of calm. Ever since Tony's last aborted transmission from the spaceship, Steve had felt like he was standing on the very edge of a cliff, trying desperately to keep his balance even as his foot was slipping ever-so-slowly over, sending dirt and pebbles bouncing down the bottomless chasm.
Steve's heart lurched so painfully that he almost cried out. "Yeah, little guy, I'm home," he said as he took Peter's other hand. "You brought me home."
"All right," Steve began, looking around the circle of heroes that he called his family. "Based on Redwing's surveillance sweep and the low number of guards, it appears that this base has been abandoned, maybe recently. I'm hoping that means there won't be too much resistance, but we should still be on our guard. This is definitely a HYDRA base, and we can't put anything past 'em, so we all need to be alert and ready for anything."
"Nothing important," Peter said with a quick shake of his head. "Just reciting some trivia stuff that we worked on the other day for Decathlon. One of the questions I got was about Admiral Nimitz."
They found Papa and Dad waiting in Papa's truck in the parking lot, where Peter's gaze was drawn to the unmarked police car just exiting the school's property, with Gwen riding in the front seat.
Grinning, Joseph tilted slightly as he shifted around the mountain, rechecking his fuel gauge as he dipped into a wide crevasse, skimming just above the surface. Hopefully Colonel O'Brien would be too distracted by the ceasefire announcement to notice just how low he'd managed to run the fuel again. The X-101s were the most smooth and maneuverable aircraft that Joseph had ever flown—not to mention just downright
"Ned, who actually coined the term, 'Cold War' to describe the differences between the Communist East and the Democratic West?"
"Oh God." Tony breathed in a shaky breath, still holding his forearm. "And yet you didn't turn him in?"
"Phillips assured me that it was a harmless type," said Steve. "Or at least only minimally harmful. But the procedure was pretty intense. It felt like my limbs were getting physically stretched at the same time that I was getting the worst sunburn of my life."
of code scrolling across his monitor woke Tony from his fitful doze, his head snapping up so fast from its lolled position that he wrenched his neck.
Steve gasped, his face flushing hot. "Sweetheart, I'm already having enough trouble controlling myself here. I don't need you making things worse!"
"Well, that just proves that you haven't kissed her yet," Uncle Clint retorted, giving Peter a rather cheeky smirk. "Otherwise you wouldn't be so touchy about it."
It didn't help that even Peter himself had asked Steve very seriously if he truly liked his father or if he was just someone he was looking to fool around with. Steve had practically bent over backwards to reassure Peter that he wasn't the fleeting type, that he'd always been afraid of dating and relationships before he met Tony, and now that they were together he had absolutely no intentions of doing anything to mess it up.
Tony cursed as he swerved yet again, trying to compensate for the power fallout in his left boot as he aimed the last of his arm missiles at the back of the Hammer suit in front of him.
As soon as he was done, Peter dropped his head, rubbing at his tight neck muscles as JARVIS translated the text. Unfortunately, the file turned out to be nothing more than a supply list for one of the HYDRA bases in Iceland that was abandoned before the team got there in the fall.
"What?" both Steves said simultaneously, just as a glowing, sparking circle suddenly appeared, hovering right there in the middle of the battlefield. The very same kind that Dr Strange had used to locate Steve and Sam in Central Park back before the whole mess began.
"Yeah, yeah, I guess that makes sense." Tony huffed out a sharp breath, rubbing at the tight knots in the back of his neck. "Yet another thing to add to the list once the mission's over, yeah?"
He brought Steve's hand to his lips and pressed a slow kiss to his knuckles, still covered in bruises and scrapes from one of his morning workouts. It was going to be a challenge, and a very expensive one at that, but once he could get it figured out… well… like Beck had said, the applications could be limitless.
But, based on the massive bomb that Uncle Thor dropped when he blasted himself onto the Tower right before Papa left, and what Peter had overheard while Papa was down in Namibia, he wasn't surprised that the team had a lot to discuss. He only wished that he could be in on it, instead of having to watch—or listen—from the sidelines. Again.
All four men turned to face the main viewscreen as the grim visage of Nick Fury appeared, his single uncovered eye scanning across the room before landing on Tony.
"Well, I'm pretty sure that we just made Pete's month," Tony said once they arrived at the motorcycle. "Did you see the look on his face when we walked in together?"
Bruce dropped his head, pinching the bridge of his nose. "Thor's… dead," he said, so softly that Steve barely heard him. "Thanos, he intercepted our ship. Somehow, he knew we were transporting the Tesseract, and so he disabled us and came aboard, and then he—he—"
"O-kay, well…" Tony trailed off, still thinking. "You're right that I haven't had the pleasure of personally fighting against Thanos," he continued. "But Pete and I have fought against two of his lackeys, and I know someone else who went up against him one-on-one and lived to tell the tale. And I really think if we all worked together, we could do it. But we'd have to all be on the exact same page the whole time, which means no winging it."
"We'll see, buddy, okay?" Dad said with a sigh. "Papa's a bit concerned about what could be hiding in it, and you already have to keep so many secrets that we just don't wanna push it too much, yeah?"
"And then I can leave here?" Steve asked, not taking his eyes off his husband's face. "I don't—I don't wanna—"
"Okay, but how long are we gonna wait? And where're my dads? And why won't anyone just tell me what's going
"Tony, I don't think this is a good idea!" Steve said firmly. He wrapped his arms around Tony's body, pinning his arms to his sides as he drew him close. "JARVIS, is Peter all right?"
"I'm right here, babe," he said as he reached for Steve's free hand, grasping it as the medics hoisted him onto the stretcher, covering him with a thick blanket. "I've got you."
"Nothing that you need to be worried about, Peter," Papa said, way too fast. "Dad and I are just checking up on a few things, okay? We should be back tomorrow in time to pick you up from school."
Tony's heart leapt into his throat. That was yet another thought that he'd been too afraid to voice lately. "No, no, let's not go there, okay?" he said, almost as much for his own comfort as Steve's. "We're not gonna think like that, okay, Mr Optimism? Pete's gonna be just fine."
"Did you see what happened?" he demanded of the poor sergeant, who was staring up at Steve with wide eyes and raised hands, as if he was afraid that Steve would suddenly keel over. "The beam, did you see where it came from?"
Which meant that the weekend probably wouldn’t turn out to be any different from most of their weekends.  Dad would get caught up in some project that just had to be done “right now”, and Peter would be left on his own.  Again.
"I bet Dad's thinking the exact same thing right about now," Peter said softly. "But you don't have anything to worry about, if that's what you're thinking."
"Yeah, it was around this time of year that he got out," Dad said softly. "But that's still no excuse for what he did, Pete, and he had no business coming up here and putting you in danger. Absolutely none."
And now—now HYDRA had him, and who knows what they'd been doing to him all this time. And where was Peter? Was he still safe, or did—
"Well, I guess you're not much for pleasantries today, are you, Steven? Well, okay, I'll try not to take it too personally. We can just get started then, since you seem like you're just raring to go." He glanced down the hallway, nodding at someone out of Steve's eyeline. "You can come on down, sweetheart, I guess we're ready for you."
that would be somehow even more terrible than what they'd been through already, and he would end up losing one or both of his beloved boys. There had already been way too many times where he'd come too close for comfort.
"Oh no, you'd just do it on accident because you were too drunk to see straight, isn't that right?" Tony said. "Nothing's ever your fault, is it? Always blaming everyone else for everything that goes wrong because you can never own up to the fact that you're the failure! It was
"So, Uncle Thor was thinking about maybe taking Gwen and me to a hockey game sometime," Peter said, picking up a fallen bit of cheese from his third taco. "And we were kinda hoping we could go before we leave for spring break, so… you guys think that'd be okay?"
"No, no, let me help you," a woman's kind voice suddenly said, startling Peter so much that he gasped, which immediately triggered the very coughing fit he'd been trying to avoid. He squeezed his eyes closed as he gave into it, curling into a tight ball as two chilled hands took hold of his arms, guiding him to a more upright position.
"Uhh, it's time? Time for what?" Peter asked, confused. "What happened to my dad, is he dead? Did Thanos snap his fingers?"
With a final nod, Steve hurried back to the rest of the team, still huddled underneath the wizards' shields.
Breathing in a shaky breath, Tony gathered up his armload of completed simulator protocols and the speaker and hurried out of his office, finding Phillips dozing in his chair in the upper section of the hangar. Apparently he'd found that afternoon's patrol rather boring.
I’ve gotten a few questions about the difference between the CTX-616 and Aminacin that I wanted to clear up.  The CTX-616/ Cortexiphan was the original drug developed back in the early days of SHIELD/ HYDRA to help wipe Bucky’s mind between his Winter Soldier missions (and bonus points to anyone who recognises the name Cortexiphan! 🤓).  The Aminacin is my version of the Extremis portrayed in Iron Man 3, which is basically a souped-up/ slightly altered version of CTX-616.  In this series, Aldrich Killian never met Maya Hansen, who was the inventor of Extremis, and so had to look elsewhere for his maniacal purposes.
And with their relationship as new as it had been back then, Steve knew that Tony was still haunted by those arguments. He would never admit such fears to Steve's face, but Tony's nightmares never lied, and were often far more telling than he was while awake.
"Ah, I'm afraid the reports of my demise were greatly exaggerated," Thor said as he swung again, sending two war dogs careening into a third. Then he paused, tilting his head. "That is how the saying goes, is it not? Starkson told it to me, but for the life of me I cannot recall the exact wording."
"We're not done yet, little guy!" Steve said as he launched his shield at the second target, catching it right in its midsection. He paused, his eyes going wide when the target continued on as if nothing had happened, ripping the shield from its body and dropping it behind another pile of wreckage at least twenty-five metres away.
Tony nodded as he burrowed even closer, listening to the sound of Steve's strong heart beating in time with the music.
And especially not after the news JARVIS had given him right after Peter had finished eating, while Steve was helping him brush his teeth.
"Yeah, I bet it did," Steve said softly. He narrowed his eyes at the screen as the reporter launched into yet another meandering statement regarding the unexplained phenomenon that had taken place high in the skies over Wakanda. Tony sighed, trying to ignore the high-pitched, nasally drone of the reporter's voice as he repeated himself for the third time.
At Steve's nod, Tony ordered JARVIS to turn off the television, pulling Steve to lie back down. Steve draped his arm across Tony's waist and pulled him as close as possible, burying his nose into his hair and breathing in.
"You mean, like absolutely nothing in the way of, right?" Tony cut in. "Like, we literally cannot do it. Our best space shuttles can only go to the moon and back, and even then, all the goddamn red tape we'd have to wade through first would make it impossible to get anything done in a reasonable amount of time, so—"
Suddenly, a beam of light as bright as a thousand suns burst down from the sky, landing on the battlefield about fifty or so metres away. Stunned war dogs shot out from all directions, yelping in dismay and forcing Steve's attackers to pause just long enough for him to see what appeared to be a massive axe shoot its way out the bottom.
"Pardon me, Master Peter, but Mr Stark reports that his telephone call has concluded," JARVIS interrupted. "He is ready for Sergeant Barnes now."
It had been Sam's way of telling Steve that a small amount of guilt could be healthy, as it tended to motivate people to try and fix things for the better.
"No, no, no!" he cried, his voice rising with every word. He pushed against Tony, nearly sending him off the side of the bed as he tried to crawl away. "Oh God, Papa, I
"I wish I could," Steve said, his expression so downtrodden that Tony had no choice but to believe him. "But since I'm flying patrols today I'd rather not. A hard run helps me focus, and after last night," he paused to press a firm kiss to Tony's lips, "I think I'm going to need the extra help."
"Oh, now, Captain, there's no need to be rude, is there?" replied Doctor List. "After all, we're all on the same side here, aren't we?"
"And their lights won't have turned off because the tesseract is powerful enough to run both Langara and Meridia for… well… we don't actually know how long, but estimates put it into the centuries," added Tony.
And after having to watch in horror as that light almost flickered into nothingness following Tony's self-sacrificing flight into space, Steve had grown even more attached to it. The way it shone through the thin, ratty t-shirts Tony often wore, its ever-present hum that Steve could hear in place of a heartbeat, and the warmth it radiated whenever Steve touched it with his hands or lips while they made love.
"Yeah, I think I'd prefer that," Tony said. No sense in them getting arrested for treason before they'd even committed it.
"Oh," Tony said, annoyed that he hadn't thought of that since it made perfect sense. "Well, shit. How in the hell am I supposed to work around that?"
been the one who had discovered the location of the prison, which no doubt ended up saving not only Papa's life, but both of the Maximoffs as well.
"Mmm," Peter grumbled as he moved another pawn. "I keep forgetting that you can hear like me and Papa."
"Oh God, Tony," Steve groaned, his breath hitching when Tony's hand slid down his sternum to his abdomen, tracing along the waistband of his pyjama pants. "You don't—you don't have to."
"Tell you what," Helen continued. "I need to go and check on the setup for the operating room, so Tony, why don't you get Captain Rogers cleaned up while we're waiting?" She pointed to a small bathroom off of the examining room. "There's a basin and washcloths in there that you can use."
regarding the fact that you have been seen in the company of Anthony Stark on numerous occasions since the initiation of the X-302 program, outside of what they would consider to be normal program hours." He clasped his hands together, letting out such an obviously fake chuckle that Steve's blood almost started to boil.
Not surprisingly, the rain forecasted for that afternoon had decided at the last minute to cancel its scheduled appearance, and since Steve was fresh out of excuses for avoiding his teammates he had reluctantly agreed to head out to the ball field once their patrol shift was over, hoping that smashing a few baseballs over the far fence would help to curb the rather annoying ache that had been gnawing at him ever since he'd first laid eyes on Anthony Stark.
"Holy shit," he whispered. "It's like a deus ex machina, out of some goofy ancient sci-fi novel or something."
Hurrying to his office, Tony barely managed to get the door closed before the tears he'd been holding back finally escaped, burning their way down his cheeks. His stack of papers and notes scattered as he slumped down into his chair and laid his head down on the desk, cursing everything that he could possibly think of for being so goddamn unfair.
"I won't, Tony," Steve said firmly. "We're going to grow old together, remember? You and me, sitting in our rocking chairs up at the Compound, long after we've passed down our shields and suits of armour to the next generation of heroes."
Peter watched as she stepped inside her house, pausing to wave at him from the window by the door as he stepped down the stairs to join his aunt and uncles.
Steve told himself for the umpteenth time, tightening his arm around Tony's lax body. Tony let out a sigh in his sleep, sliding his leg across Steve's lap as he burrowed impossibly closer.
living historians in your family," Ned said as he and Peter made their way from the lunchroom back to their lockers. "I mean, the history books that we have don't even tell half of the story, so how're people like me supposed to even know some of this stuff!"
"It's only a stupid chest cold, honey, and I absolutely refuse to go anywhere just for a goddamn chest cold," Tony stated. "It's no big deal, Steve. I'll be back to normal in a couple of days."
"Hmm…" Tony muttered as he walked slowly around the hologram, tweaking a few things here and there. Fifty million Newtons would probably be enough to withstand Hulk if he was just standing still, but since Tony could not actually imagine Hulk just standing still—and even less so if he was going bonkers—then it wasn't going to be enough.
And for Steve, who had never, ever passed up an opportunity to demonstrate his love and affection for Tony, that was saying something.
Steve watched Bucky go, still struggling to breathe in the dust-laden air that smelled of ozone, gunpowder, and teargas. It was only supposed to have been a diplomatic mission, not yet another battle with the very same enemy that had haunted Steve ever since the war.
Unfortunately, Dad's poor attempt at bravado had Peter in such a bad mood the next morning that Gwen, who had been so excited about their upcoming trip to the Compound that she had accidentally let it slip in front of Ned, actually suggested to Peter that they postpone it instead. Peter immediately vetoed that idea, assuring Gwen that even if he did end up spending the weekend with his dads as usual, nothing would change.
"Yeah, just like one of these days you're actually gonna pay up, right, Buck?" Steve retorted. "I'll see you guys later."
"Thanks, Captain," said Anthony. "So, the first thing we'll run through are the takeoff procedures. Now, following a normal runway takeoff the first thing you'll need to do is…"
"Yep," answered Peter. "Except it's not exactly accurate anymore since he's still living. That book was written before Papa was found in the ice."
"Yeah," Gwen said as she bit off part of an apple slice. "You're usually daydreaming through most of our classes, and when you're not you're just pretending to take notes when you're really drawing schematics or something in your notebooks."
"Dad, you don't have to pretend with me anymore," Peter said, so matter-of-factly that it sent Tony's heart plummeting to his knees. "I know what's going on, I'm not a little kid anymore."
Peter wrinkled his nose. He found it highly unlikely that Papa ever forgot anything with his eidetic memory, but he appreciated the compliment anyway.
"Or a warning shot," Peter muttered, catching himself when Papa gave him a frown. "Nevermind. You sure you'll be home tomorrow though?"
he said, waggling his eyebrows. "You know in order to get the nanite template as accurate as possible, JARVIS has to scan you."
"Yeah, whatever," Tony mumbled, briefly squeezing his eyes closed. He was starting to panic again, and now was really
"Wouldn't put it past 'em," Tony mumbled into Steve's chest. "They've already started debating that new legislation even though Spider-Man hasn't been seen in months—"
Gwen smiled, hugging her books even tighter. "Great! Um… would tomorrow be okay? You could just come home with me after practise, and we could work on homework until dinner time, if that sounds okay."
"Are you sure you'd be able to handle being that close to ice, little guy?" Steve said gently. "And the hockey arenas are always pretty cold, so you'd have to make sure that you stayed warm enough."
"Please!" he pleaded. "This is all happening because of me, so I need to make it right! You can help coordinate the first responders out there, but just make sure that Gwen's all right first, okay?"
"Yeah. Well, anyway… I um…" Tony broke off, swallowing as he tried to reign in the wide smile stretching across his lips. "I've kinda got a date tonight, and—"
"Yes!" Uncle Thor suddenly shouted from the opposite end of the suite, nearly causing Peter to drop his plate. "That is yet another victory for our beloved Rangers!"
"No, no, honey, you were perfect," Tony assured him. "No one except for me could tell that you were rattled."
"Yeah, yeah, okay honey," Tony said quickly. He brought Steve's hand to his lips and kissed it, the scratch of his facial hair against Steve's scorched skin causing him to flinch. "That's a new one, isn't it?"
"What the?" he heard Quill ask, slowly turning his head towards him. Quill's expression hadn't swayed too far from the
And try to reign himself in. Because despite everything he'd tried to tell himself about keeping Steve at arm's length, at least at first, Tony could already tell that it was going to be much harder than he had anticipated.
Peter huffed as he stuffed his sweaty, stinky gym uniform into his backpack and zipped it closed, taking extra care to not yank too hard on the zipper. He was already on his sixth backpack of the school year, having torn his last one only the week before, and it was starting to get more than a little embarrassing. Especially since Gwen seemed to take notice every time he showed up at school with a new one.
As it is, Steve ended up low-balling himself anyway.  He knows his time is worth more than the ten dollars an hour he’ll be making to coach Peter, but he figures he can always renegotiate once Peter starts going to meets and racks up some decent times.  Empire State allows its professors and sports coaches to earn up to an additional twelve percent of their university salary on outside projects, which means Steve still has some wiggle room to work with.
Through all of the intervening years, Tony had never even considered the possibility that he might actually fall in love with someone, and even less so the possibility that that someone would be so thrilled about Tony having a son. Working up the nerve to tell Steve about Peter—and especially the fact that he was sick—had been one of the most difficult things Tony had ever experienced in his life, and when Steve didn't even blink, when his face didn't give away a single hint of trepidation and instead he expressed how excited he was to meet Peter, that was the first moment when Tony realised that he had truly fallen in love with him.
His hands trembling against the stone wall where he crouched, Peter sucked in as deep a breath as he could. Papa was trying to hide it, as he always did, but Peter had sparred with Papa enough times to recognise when he was reaching his limit, and from what Peter could tell, Papa was already so far beyond his limit that Peter was shocked he was still conscious.
And he still needed to come up with something to tell Peter. Sam had told him just an hour or so ago that Peter was already getting suspicious, and Tony knew that he couldn't keep putting him off for too much longer. It wasn't fair to his poor boy to keep him in the dark.
The loud groan of bending metal immediately followed Winter Soldier's words, and Tony jumped when not even a second later he had ripped the arm from his chair and slammed it right across the face of the Russian colonel, knocking him flat to the floor with a very undignified shriek. Spitting out a mouthful of blood, the colonel attempted to crawl away as Winter Soldier quickly freed the rest of his limbs, grabbing the colonel by the scruff of his neck and slamming him up against the wall.
Steve shook his head, shrugging. "I was scared," he admitted. "Once I realised that he was your son I just panicked because I thought you'd get upset if you knew that I was visiting with him when you couldn't. I know how protective you are with him, and with his condition I didn't want to do anything that might upset either of you."
"Yeah!" Peter exclaimed as much as his waterlogged lungs would allow. "I haven't talked to him in ages!"
"I've also named it," Peter cut in. "I figured something this monumental deserved a name. But it's a surprise, so you'll have to wait to see it till you get here tomorrow."
“All right, so we’ve got super-scary HYDRA energy weapons and a helluva lot of trigger-happy soldiers ready to fire ‘em,” says Tony.  “Call it, Captain.”
At Tony's reluctant nod, Natasha scooted forward, allowing Steve to curl his arms around their sleeping son. Peter was apparently so out of it that he barely even wiggled as Steve situated him on his lap, burying his nose into their son's hair and holding him as if he feared it might be the last time.
“Tony,” Steve whispered as he cupped Tony’s cheek, tilting his head up to capture his lips.  He didn't waste any time keeping the kiss chaste, running his tongue across Tony’s bottom lip and whimpering as Tony allowed him inside.  Before Tony, Steve had never been a huge fan of kissing, finding it little more than a small stepping stone to the real event.  But with Tony, Steve had discovered that it hadn’t been the kissing itself that he hadn’t enjoyed, it was just that he hadn't ever kissed someone that he loved.
Tony nodded as he took a sip from the cup of coffee Rhodey had brought him about half an hour ago, along with the news that Steve's patrol shift was going to be cut short by one hour so that the X-302 aircraft could undergo a more thorough maintenance check.
"Oh yeah, just working on my homework," answered Peter. For some weird reason that he couldn't explain, he loved that Uncle Bucky always reverted to Russian whenever he spoke one of their names. It just sounded so cool and mysterious.
And while he knew that the days ahead wouldn't be all sunshine and roses and white-sand beaches, nightmares never just go away when their root cause is gone, after all, Tony knew that at least one of his nightmares, perhaps even the one he most feared, was now only just that.
"The designation was CTX-616," said Beck. "I noticed it was marked for destruction, so I managed to grab a bit of it before that happened. I had more of it synthesised after our initial tests were successful."
"And we will," Dad stated. "The only thing I require is that Pete needs to stay close to me. We know how to work together, and I need to keep an eye on him."
"Yeah, Liz is pretty upset about it, she told us that she's gonna be moving out of state now with her mom 'cause her dad's in some kind of witness protection or something, so… but please don't forget to tell Peter that I called? Please? And as soon as he's feeling better I can bring his homework by, and—"
It had been the ice again. The Arctic ice this time, with the sounds of shattering glass and groaning metal rumbling in his ears and the freezing-cold water searing right into his lungs to choke the breath from him as he sank, lower and lower and lower…
Fury scoffed, letting out a morbid chuckle.  “Heh.  Yeah, I guess so.”  Then he steepled his fingers under his chin, suddenly aging about ten years in less than a second.  “Tony, I can’t tell you not to go.  But please, as an old man who cares very much about you, don’t just try and wing this, okay?  We’re uncovering new information almost by the second here, and none of it’s good, which leads me to believe that Rogers’ kidnapping has been in the works for a long time.  And because of that, I don't think they’re gonna make it easy for anyone to get him out.”
He may be a super-kid, but he was still just a kid. And he deserved to keep whatever innocence he could for as long as possible.
Somehow, without ever having heard his voice in person and relying only on Tony's descriptions, Peter had managed to program Mr Jarvis's voice so closely that Tony was instantly able to recognise it.
"Don't—!" Steve shrieked as Tony carefully placed him down, gripping Tony's hand. "Tony, don't leave me! Please, don't—!"
"Yeah, that's it," Tony rushed out. He scrubbed his palm down his face and sat back up, turning back to face Peter. "You hear that, Pete? Papa's never gonna leave us, so we're gonna be just fine."
As soon as Mr Rogers sees Peter’s head pop up, he crouches down, a rather impressed smile on his face.
knew that you were supposed to squeeze it from the bottom and roll it up as you went, not from the middle like Dad did.
Peter bit his lip, trying desperately to keep his tears contained. "Not quite everyone. My friend, Gwen, her dad's a police officer, and she told me that he's pretty upset by all of this, so… it's not everyone."
"Far as I can tell, there's nothing," Uncle Sam said. "It's like they're just waiting for us to make a move or something. I can't imagine this'll be how this ends."
Sliding back into his chair, Peter burrowed down into his hoodie, attempting to ignore Ned whose eyes were boring straight into Peter's skull.
"Yep," answered Tony as he stole a small piece of the croissant, winking as he popped it into his mouth. "Bruce and Sam said they'll have the panic room prepped and ready by Saturday morning, so…"
Because if Tony—or Peter, for that matter—had had even an inkling of what had been going through his head, then… well, Steve was certain that there was no way Tony would ever allow Peter to visit his store again.  Much less tell him they would see him tomorrow.
"Yeah, yeah, not likely," Tony mumbled, his mind already branching out into several different directions. "Remind me again how many parameters we've set up for target identification?"
No wonder Steve had told Tony so many times that he couldn't wait to meet Peter. It was because he'd already
His hair rinsed and conditioned, Tony turned in Steve's hold, pressing a light kiss to his stubbled chin as he reached for the soap bar so he could wash his husband's exquisite body, lingering on his gorgeous pecs and abs while Steve's intense blue eyes never wavered from Tony's face. It was something that Steve had been doing quite a bit ever since the battle down in Miami, as if he was afraid Tony might up and disappear if he happened to look away. His expression was a mixture of love, longing, and the tiny hint of disbelief that Tony knew still lingered in the back of Steve's mind, the disbelief that he had a husband and a son who loved him, something he never thought that he might actually get to have.
"Oh, shut up, Flash," Ned snapped before Peter could respond. "And what are you even doing here? Aren't you supposed to be spinning tunes?"
"I'm looking forward to it, sir," answered JARVIS. "Based on the preliminary designs already included by Master Peter, I am currently estimating no issues with either the satellites or the containment vessel."
"We'll have to talk about it, Pete, okay?" he finally said. "You, me, and Papa, we'll all talk about it together once it's ready, and we can decide then."
Steve's throat tightened as he smoothed Tony's hair from his forehead, leaning down to brush a gentle kiss there. "It won't, mo grá. I've ordered it to stand down for the moment." Given the time, he figured Peter would be waking up soon enough, and Steve could send him to get him some food once he came in to check on them.
He broke off, shaking his head as he pulled up the bill's text with the offensive sections already highlighted, and handed it to Papa.
"I wish I could help you more," Peter mumbled. "Maybe then you wouldn't worry about everything so much."
"I will try," Tony said honestly as he laid back down, allowing Steve to pull the blankets up to his neck.
Shuri nodded as she laid the dripping cloth across the worst of Tony's burns, Steve's heart nearly cracking in two when Tony let out a long, agonised groan.
"Holy shit!" he exclaimed, blinking against his watery eyes as he took off racing towards it. He could no longer imagine any scenario where its intentions could be anything other than hostile since that power plant was the main source of electricity for almost the entire continent. "Base, I have eyes on the unidentified aircraft and it appears to be on a direct kamikaze course for the power plant. Do I have permission to fire?"
Mr Jarvis had always said. It was never just a simple 'your welcome', like most people offered—when they bothered to offer it at all. It was always 'you are
The Langaran and Meridian leaders had been playing both sides against the middle for years. Maybe even for the entire war.
"Yeah, okay, but we don't need to talk about that right now either," Steve said. He drew in a deep breath, trying to maintain some semblance of composure. He, Natasha, and Clint had arrived at the Tower in the Quinjet just in time to witness Tony being tossed out of the penthouse window, and Steve had nearly had a heart attack at the sight.
Tony watched as Steve sauntered away, resisting the strong urge to say the hell with dinner anyway and chase after him. While they hadn't exactly been celibate since that awful night when Steve tried to burn off his skin, Tony had been extra careful to avoid using sex as a crutch when Steve got particularly bad, instead calling Sam to help talk him down.
Tony shakes his head, his hand vibrating between Steve’s.  “No,” he says.  “You—you’re—I’m not the one you're—I always thought that you we’re—that you—”
"Yeah, no kidding," Bucky piped up from the passenger seat. "Hey, Sam? How come you didn't get me a nice big house on a lake, hmm?"
The faintest hints of light from the rising sun were just starting to peek over the horizon when Tony woke from the deepest sleep he'd had in months. He groaned softly as he shifted, burrowing further into the cocoon of Steve's arms, a soft smile quirking the corners of his lips as Steve instinctively cuddled him closer.
And every single one of them always had an open door for Peter as well, pretty much whenever he needed one. It was a massive weight off of his and Tony's shoulders to know that if one or both of them got held up somehow, that any number of their teammates could jump right in to pick him up from school or something.
"I was thinking, Peter's summer vacation is coming up in about a month, and since we went to Italy over his break, I was wondering if we could plan a trip to Ireland sometime during the summer? Maybe take him to a couple of the places that we went on our honeymoon?"
"I only require Mr Lang's signature for his employment paperwork," replied JARVIS. "Once that is complete, there is a car waiting at the building's entrance to transport him to the airport."
There was another flash of red light, and Steve felt himself being forced back up to his feet only to be immediately shot in the abdomen. He doubled over, choking and gasping for breath, his heart audibly cracking in two as he realised that in order to protect his son, he was actually going to have to fight his own husband.
Steve smiled, the first true smile Tony had seen from him all day. "Yeah, I did," he said. "'Cause it's the truth. And even more so now."
"Are you guys coming?" Peter mumbled, opening one sleepy eye. "I don't—I don't really wanna be alone in here. This bed's way too big for just me."
"Oh, my sweet boy," Papa said as he took Peter's hand, cradling it in his own. "Peter, have you talked with Uncle Sam about this?"
"But that's what a good parent does," Steve whispered, sniffing as a tear rolled down his cheek. "A good parent puts their child's needs and wants above their own."
"All right, all right," said Uncle Sam. "Go ahead and try, but I'm afraid he's just gonna see right through it." He let out a heavy sigh. "When's the next time we're supposed to hear from Steve?"
The backseat heater was going full-blast as Peter climbed inside the truck, which Peter was extremely grateful for as he fumbled to put on his seatbelt. Even with his Spider-Man suit, three layers of clothes, and a down jacket pretty much designed for a climb to the top of Mount Everest, he was still cold.
"Captain Rogers," Helen said gently, placing a soft hand on Steve's shoulder. "Captain, you're going to need surgery on your foot. There's a surgeon already flying down here from New York, and—"
Tony gritted his teeth. He should've known they wouldn't find anything, 'cause that would just be far too easy. But still…
"I don't know," answered Peter, bracing himself as the next impact grew closer and closer. "I don't—I don't know, but don't worry. I've got you."
“Yes, sweetheart, I promise,” answers Steve.  He lifts his head to press a kiss to Tony’s forehead, then lets it fall back, too weak even to hold it up.  His eyes flutter again as he hears a strange sort of ruckus, followed by an odd ripping noise as a shadowy figure appears, almost like a god descending from the heavens above.
"Yes, Your Highness, I do understand that," Thor cut in. The tall, strong god looked more frightened than Steve had ever seen him, which did absolutely nothing to calm Steve's already frazzled nerves. "But you see, my entire world, Asgard, was recently destroyed, by a force that I knew nothing about until it was nearly too late to save my people, and that is a fate that I would not wish on anyone. And especially not to the people of this world, who have so graciously granted sanctuary to what is left of my race. So, Your Highness, as a fellow leader, I beg you. Please listen to myself and my dear friends here when we say that this threat is both grim and imminent, and that it is imperative that we all work together in order to defeat it."
"Yeah, yeah, famous last words, buddy," Tony muttered as he took his nanite case from his pocket, attaching it to his chest. "Now, c'mon. Grab your Powerade and let's get going, yeah? It's not nice to keep our elders waiting."
Steve huffed, tipping his head back as his heart migrated from where it had lodged in his throat back down to where it belonged. Out of the entire set of mission parameters that Tony had given them, the re-entry aspect was the only part that had truly frightened him.
"Doing a final sweep of the perimeter now, and all I'm seeing is a lot of debris," said Sam. "Looks like we did it, guys."
"Yes, but that small increase in mass will give you another seventy-six percent in channeling capacity," insisted Grandpa. "And we could probably boost that up to eighty or even higher if we altered the design from a true cube to a more rhomboid shape." He paused, holding out his hand for Peter's pencil, which Peter promptly handed to him. "It's like this. You alter the design just so, and—" Peter watched as his grandfather proceeded to sketch out a rough diagram of an alternate containment vessel, one that slanted slightly outwards instead of straight down. "—this would allow more of the energy to build up inside the container before it gets funnelled into the satellites, which means higher amounts of energy are produced, which means—"
"Bruce? What're you doing here? What's going—?" He cut off as his gazed swerved over to Dr Strange, gasping as he recognised him. "You? What the hell are you doing here, you goddamn, no-good quack? Last I heard, you ran your car off a mountain or something!"
Peter scowled, lifting his head. "Why? So I'm not around while you and Dad interrogate the dude who tried to break in?"
"But you can't think like that, little guy," Steve insisted. "Part of being a hero is that you can't be always second-guessing yourself. You just have to follow your instincts, and the best way to do that is to hone those instincts through training."
"Yeah, she did," agreed Steve, nodding as Cam Mitchell took his seat next to Major Lorne, who had arrived with Sharon Carter on his arm. All of Steve's teammates were now there, just like they had been for Peter's serum procedure.
Tony thought as he twisted to his left, repulsing away another flying chariot and grinning behind his faceplate at the alien's cry of shock.
The tree turned its head, nodding in Steve's direction just as its right arm—branch?—extended, spearing four of the war dogs clear through their bodies.
Steve watched as Wong and Dr Strange exchanged loaded glances. "What? Is there something else you need to tell us?"
Tony bit his lip, hesitating. On the one hand having official police and FBI backup was probably the best way to go. But on the other hand this was HYDRA, and they weren't about to take it easy on anyone who they found to be assisting the Avengers.
Peter sighed as he shook his head. "I didn't notice the smell until I'd eaten about three bites of it. I was—I was tired, and when I'm tired—"
As it turned out, Peter was a bit tired from school, but unfortunately perked up considerably when Tony informed him that he was going to be working with him and Bruce to crack the formula for the Pym Particles.
Peter's shoulders sagged, nearly causing him to drop his History textbook. "Yeah, me too," he said sadly. "But you know my dads. There's no way they'd leave me here by myself after what happened at the Compound." He didn't add that despite having to be away from Gwen yet again, he was actually looking forward to getting to see Wakanda.
And then, if that wasn't enough, Dad had informed Peter during their last conversation that in the years since the Battle of the Continents, there actually hadn't even been a real Meridian government at all. There had only been a sort of puppet organisation working for General O'Brien, in order to give each country's citizens the illusion of an opposing force.
"I don't know," Steve said honestly. "But what I do know is that neither Tony nor Peter have done a single thing to deserve any of this, and yet they're both being punished for it."
“I’m already done with my homework, so please?  If you're that paranoid, you can just tell the security guys to follow me!”
Peter nodded at his plate.  “Yeah, something like that.”  He paused, waiting for Dad’s answer.  “So… can I?”
Following his usual routine, Steve headed next for the kitchen. He debated on making something light to eat, knowing that Tony hadn't eaten anything since dinner either, but eventually decided against it. He wasn't hungry in the least, the nightmare having completely stolen his appetite, so he instead prepared a fresh pot of coffee, pouring two large mugs to bring into Tony's lab, adding a bit of cream and sugar to his. He wasn't as big a fan of coffee as Tony, and especially not of the strong, black stuff that Tony constantly drank, but he also wasn't interested in trying to sleep anymore that night unless Tony was with him so he figured the caffeine might be helpful.
Thankfully, JARVIS didn't hesitate.  “Very good, sir,” he said, accompanied by three beeps and a loud
Of course, Tony is a business owner, and one that relies heavily on word-of-mouth reviews to grow his business, since it seemed like at least half of the Yelp reviews were from people who’d heard about Tony’s shop from one of their friends.  So he could just be that charming to everyone, which means that Steve is pretending to see things that aren’t even there.
“Now that Pete’s a bit older, I’m sure he wouldn’t mind going out on the bike every now and then,” Tony added.  “I’ll have to get him a helmet so you can take him out for a ride sometime.”
"Your eyes bothering you again?" asked Ned as he started peeling an orange. "I've noticed you've been wearing your glasses a lot more often lately."
Now, though, after Steve’s meltdown and Peter’s busted-up finger, Tony literally had no idea what to do.  Leaving Steve sprawled out on the floor of his bookstore as he begged for forgiveness had been one of the hardest things Tony had ever done in his life, but he knew he couldn't just brush aside what had happened either.  Steve needed help, more help than Tony or Peter could give him, and Tony just couldn't risk the possibility that something worse might happen if Steve continued to refuse to get the help that he needed.
The whole thing was like something out of some old spy novel, the likes of which Tony would’ve probably never come across if he hadn’t met a tall, blond, and exceptionally handsome guy who just happened to own a bookstore.
"He's alive!" Peter exclaimed, a huge smile breaking across his face. Uncle Bruce had told Dad and Papa that Thanos had killed Uncle Thor when he attacked their ship, but if Uncle Thor was still alive, then maybe that could be how they—
"Like a souped-up version of the trigger words," Peter mumbled. He let out a hard shudder, fatigue pulsing through his body with every beat of his heart. His legs felt like jello, his head was pounding, and his vision was so wonky that he could barely keep his eyes open.
"Did—did you build that yourself?" he asked, indicating the air canister. "Петр told me that you build most of your own equipment."
Uncle Bucky nearly spat out his mouthful of Dr Pepper all over the chessboard. "You did?" he asked, laughing and sputtering. "And how'd Стиви feel about that?"
"Thanks," Tony murmured. As soon as the door clicked shut, Tony made a beeline for the abandoned chair, lifting Peter's hand to his lips as tears spilled down his cheeks.
"No, Tony, it's nothing specific," answered Steve. "I mean, Nat and Wanda were in there while I was in there, and they were asking about Peter, and about how Bruce was doing, and wondering if they should go ahead and order Pietro some more shoes, 'cause he's already worn through the entire supply that we got for him when they first arrived. It was nothing out of the ordinary, but the whole time I just kept thinking about how I just wanted to get back to my son." He brought Tony's hand to his lips, kissing the back of it. "I'm just tired. And I don't think it's the kind of tired that sleep can fix."
"Oh no you don't!" he said, straining against the web as the suit attempted to jerk itself free. Grunting, Peter slowly pulled the suit towards him, finally getting enough leverage so he could slam it down onto the floor, sending pieces of it skittering across the concrete.
the code said, and Tony barely suppressed another eyeroll at the thought. He'd heard enough whispered gossip just walking from his office to the classroom a few moments ago to fill an entire marketplace for the next week.
"Ah, Captain, Stark," Thor said as soon as they walked into the room. "Please accept my most sincere condolences on Young Starkson's injuries. I trust, though, that he will make a full recovery?"
“I’m gonna try and get a read on the entrance!” Tony calls as he suddenly angles downward, approaching the far corner of the building.  But just as he’s about to skim across the top, he bounces off what appears to be some kind of invisible energy shield, nearly knocking him off of his flight path.
Not wanting to waste a golden opportunity, Steve had also asked Shuri to take a peek at Tony's heart and its surrounding blood vessels, where she set about repairing the internal scars left behind from the shrapnel, arc reactor, and the surgery Tony had had after the arc reactor was damaged. She had even offered to heal the damaged nerves in Tony's left arm, which he had suffered way back during one of his first missions as Iron Man. Tony had always tried hard to hide just how often the arm had bothered him over the years, but Steve had always been able to see right through him.
"So antsy," Steve said, just before capturing Tony's mouth again. Steve loved kissing Tony, loved the feel of their lips and tongues sliding against each other's and the little whimpers that Tony made whenever Steve cupped his cheeks with his hands. They kissed until they were both out of breath, panting as Steve broke away to kiss and nibble his way across his husband's—his
Actually, it wasn't quite the truth, but Steve wasn't about to tell JARVIS that he'd just realised that he needed to pee. Nor was he about to wake Tony, who was sleeping soundly next to him on the bed, flat on his stomach with his face smashed into his pillow. Following the battle at the prison, Tony had been so concerned for Peter and Steve's injuries that he'd completely neglected to tell anyone about his own, which Steve had had the unfortunate opportunity to discover once they got home and Tony got undressed for bed. Steve had nearly choked when his eyes landed on the mass of deep blue and purple bruises that covered almost the entirety of Tony's upper back and shoulders, bruises caused by the grenade and missile hits that he'd taken while fighting against the Hammer suits.
"Yeah, but I need to say this," said Uncle Bucky, thick and low. "Peter, I'm sorry. I'm sorry for judging your father before I even knew him, and I'm sorry for what you've been through because of people like me. It's not—it's not right. None of it's right."
"Well, I'd personally take Peter's enthusiastic appetite as a compliment," said Steve. "Now, where do you need me?"
looks. "Spoken like a true adolescent boy," he said, his eyebrows all scrunched together. "No, buddy, I'm not afraid in the slightest."
It was almost funny the way Obie’s expression changed as they filed inside the office.  From the despicable
"Oh, that's so much better, thank you!" exclaimed Hammer with a flourish, almost as though he was speaking to an audience. "Now then, as I stated, we're ready for Steven here to begin the test with the latest prototype, oh, and you're just going to
"There's four guards right outside this door, and four more at the bottom of the stairs," added Phillips. "I shouldn't be gone longer than a half hour or so."
"No, probably not," agreed Steve. "But the biggest question now is, why? Widows of other pilots who were killed in action during the very same battle were given support, and so have most of the widows since then. So why wasn't Ma? What made her case different?"
"That's 'cause it's the absolute truth," agreed Tony. He tugged Steve's face down for another kiss, one that nearly made Steve's knees buckle. "But you are pretty cute, so I guess I'll keep you anyway."
"Oh, shut up, mister goody two-shoes," Bucky said as he tossed a bit of roll at Steve's face. "And hey. Where the hell were you this afternoon, anyway? Sam and I were looking for ya."
the weirdest thing going on right now? The fact that I'm in the boys' bathroom, and not that you're trying to sneak off to go and find your papa?"
“Ahh, just you wait till I tell him how brave you were,” Tony said as he brushed the tears from Steve’s cheeks.  “He’s gonna be so proud of you, honey.  He’ll be bouncing all over the restaurant like a ping-pong ball with it.”
Another ear-splitting explosion caused him to jump, his arm instinctively pushing the stick to the right and almost directly into the biggest fireball that Steve had ever seen.
Gamora rolled her eyes, shooting Tony an apologetic glance. "Sorry. He's not used to not being in charge."
"I'll take that as a yes," Bucky said once Steve had finally stopped coughing. "Gods, Steve, you've really gotta quit trying to choke yourself to death every single time I bring that stuff up!"
“Well… okay,” he said, in that smooth, smarmy voice he liked to use with reporters.  “Um… while I’m not quite sure why Tony felt the need to parade all of you gentlemen in here, it was nice to meet you.  However, if you’ll excuse us, Tony and I do have some private business to discuss—”
And the movie, while definitely not the best he'd ever seen, did turn out to be at least decent enough for him to want to see again.
Dad sighed heavily, and Peter pictured him pinching the bridge of his nose, like he always did whenever his coffee ran out before he was done tinkering with whatever he was tinkering with.
"I don't know," Uncle James finally said. "Tony's so beside himself right now that I didn't have the heart to ask him, so…"
"We actually believe that it'll unlock all of them eventually," said Bruce. "But unfortunately, this Bible had a rather tenuous history with the translation that caused it to be delayed for over fifty years, and during that time there were several changes in both dialect and the people who were in charge of actually translating it, so—"
Peter gulped. He knew he was approaching dangerous territory, but aside from the fact that he thought Uncle Bucky was just being silly in trying to push Uncle Sam away, with Project Phoenix coming up so soon Peter couldn't afford for Uncle Bucky and Uncle Sam's personal issues to overshadow any of Papa's planning. Peter knew that Papa was already going to be worried enough about him and Dad while he was gone, and the last thing he needed was even more to worry about.
"Steve—" he said again, finally having the presence of mind to tap him on the shoulder. "Honey, let's get on the bed. Like, right the hell
He also had a strong feeling that Tony was itching to poke around Shuri's lab a bit more, which was also not at all surprising.
“All right,” Steve says after a short pause.  He and Tony do work really well in tandem, as the Battle of New York and their previous HYDRA raids have shown.
Surprisingly, Tony managed to doze off for about thirty or so minutes, waking only once the sun began to rise in earnest, sending bright beams of sunlight across Steve's perfectly organised room. Tony groaned, raising his arms above his head to stretch before reluctantly deciding to concede defeat in the argument with his very full bladder and get up from the bed.
"Master Peter is not present, sir," JARVIS said. "I currently have his location marked at the school, but—"
"Thanos," answered Bruce. He stepped back, clutching his arm. "Steve, he's coming, and we're—we're just not ready! We're nowhere near ready!"
And, of course, all the guilt that accompanied them. Guilt he couldn't shake no matter how fast he ran or how many punching bags he destroyed.
Peter let out a heavy sigh. "Well, it's a start, at least." He tugged gently on Uncle Bucky's hand. "Now c'mon, my dad's waiting for you."
Which is good.  Because Steve’s patience, never one of his strongest suits, is rapidly approaching its breaking point.  Dealing with such constant, unrelenting pain for the last four-plus years has been nothing short of hell, made a million times worse by his humiliating failure at the Olympics sixteen months ago.  Add to that Ma’s death, the mile-high stack of medical bills that he has yet to make a decent dent in, and his overall shattered trust in humanity thanks to his asshole ex-boyfriend has turned Steve into nothing more than a fragile shell of his former self.
He was cut off by a piercing scream, one that nearly stopped Tony's heart. In a flash, Steve took off running out of the lab, nearly tearing Tony's arm from its socket as they raced back to Peter's room to find him thrashing around on his bed, obviously trapped in one of his nightmares.
“All right, honey, did you hear that?” Dad asked.  “Pete says everything’s good, so if this is it, then let’s do this, yeah?  Let’s do this and get you free of this monster’s claws!”
Peter was sleeping when Tony got to his room, so he slumped into the chair next to his bed and carefully took his hand, his heart lurching painfully at the sight of his beloved boy covered in wires and tubes and surrounded by beeping monitors. The oxygen mask he was wearing covered most of his face, and while his pale cheeks and lips were no longer the horrific shade of blue they had been when they'd arrived, they were still nowhere near what Tony would consider normal.
“Tony?” Steve asks around the metal stuck in his mouth.  “Uhh, are you waiting for me to do something?”
"So, I hate to be that guy," Cam said as he popped the last of his fried potatoes into his mouth. "But given how powerful this tesseract thing really is, are we sure it's safe for us to use? I mean, how can we be sure that it's not gonna explode as soon as Steve deploys it?"
He sat in a crumpled heap on the floor for a couple of minutes, fighting against the dry heaves that always followed until he felt strong enough to attempt to stand. His arms and legs were shaking violently and tingling like he'd been electrocuted as he splashed some cold water on his face and rinsed out his mouth, trying to take the slow, deep breaths through his nose that Uncle Sam had taught him.
"Yeah," Peter said with a light chuckle. He had often suspected that one of Dad's reasons for inventing JARVIS in the first place was so that he could have someone besides Peter to talk to that didn't constantly want something from him.
Natasha pursed her lips, glancing down at Peter. "Yes, he has. Are you sure you're feeling up to discussing it?"
"Protect the stone!" Steve heard T'Challa call into his comm as he landed across the river, followed immediately by a burst of purple energy that took out at least five of the war dogs. "Shuri, make sure the stone is protected!"
"Okay, so… that whole bedtime story that Thor told us about these infinity gems, that was all actually true?" asked Sam.
Steve raised his head, his beautiful face flushed and shining with sweat as he looked deep into Tony's eyes.
"Yeah, well, I'm pretty sure he's got guts to spare," said Sam. "Now, did I hear someone say something about pizza?"
"I was living on the Kree homeworld with no memory of who I was or what had happened to me," answered Carol, rather sharply. "Is that out of commission enough for you?"
"Prince T'Challa!" Steve heard someone scream, presumably one of the female guards that were stationed outside. The entire forward section of the trailer had collapsed into a jumbled mess nearly two metres high, and Steve could hear more explosions booming off in the distance, the frequency of which exactly matched that of the powerful HYDRA grenades he'd heard way too many times over the course of his life.
"Yeah, he was pretty impressed when I told him," Peter said, curling his gloved fingers around his cup. "Then we spent the next hour developing an algorithm for one of our next Avengers training programs." He glanced up at Steve, a rather shit-eating grin on his face. "Just wait till you see it, Papa. I think you're gonna love it."
in return, Steve gave his cat one final pat before exiting the room, making sure to keep the door cracked so she could do her usual wandering throughout the store at night.  Then he headed back out into the main part of the store, watching as Tony grabbed Peter’s backpack from its spot behind the counter.
Discovered by chance three miles off the Langaran coast about five years prior to the Battle of the Continents, Howard had been researching possible ways to utilise the oddly glowing cube right up until the Battle of the Continents and his subsequent arrest for treason. And ever since then, the military government had kept it locked away in some secured vault somewhere beneath the Air Corps base while their scientists attempted to come up with ways to use it to develop weapons of mass destruction.
looks. "I already know that, Peter, just like anyone with half a brain knows that. Besides, it's not like Captain America could be corrupted anyway, right?"
"These are not ugly, Tony," Steve said a couple minutes later, brushing his lips across the worst of Tony's scars. "These scars tell a story, one that demonstrates your tenacity, your genius, and your love for our son. They represent your absolute refusal to give up under the most frightening of circumstances, and for that, I'll always be grateful for them. I wouldn't have found you and Peter without them."
"That's probably 'cause you won't need to start shaving till you're thirty," Flash Thompson said as he came up behind Peter, slapping him hard on his backside. "Little baby-faced Prince Peter probably doesn't even know how to grow facial hair yet."
Tony let out a sigh as he cupped Steve's cheek, tilting his head up to look at him. "I don't think that Cole's the real enemy here, though. I think he's just a puppet, which means there's someone else—or a few someone elses—who are still in the background pulling the strings."
“Ah, what?” Obie said, his eyes going almost comically wide for a second or two before he was able to catch himself.  “What’re you looking into the drug trials for?”
"Do you remember what I told you the night before the Phoenix mission?" Steve asked, his lips following the path of Tony's scar. Despite all of Steve's protests to the contrary, he knew that Tony still found his scar ugly, so he always tried to lavish as much attention to it as possible when they were intimate.
"That's 'cause we're getting ready to bring you home, honey," Tony said quickly. "You just sit back and enjoy the ride now, okay? JARVIS is gonna do all the work."
Stifling a groan, Steve lays back down, trying to ignore the fact that the floor now feels as cold as the Arctic ice where SHIELD found him.  He suppresses another shiver as he rolls onto his side, curling into a tight ball.
"Yeah." Tony would have far preferred to have gone over the calculations with Bruce one final time before starting in on the render, but seeing as how Bruce was offworld with Thor and Loki,
"And the Asgardians, you said, Captain?" Thor spoke up from his seat next to Bruce. "You said my people were there as well?"
By the end of the two-hour practise, Steve’s voice is hoarse from calling out encouragement and he’s nearly dripping with sweat in his thick button-down shirt.  He makes a mental note to start packing a t-shirt and a pair of shorts that he can change into before practise, hoping that his newly improved range of motion will finally allow him to start wearing t-shirts comfortably again.
"Oh. Great," muttered Rhodey. "Long as you remember that I'm not as young as I used to be, all right?"
"Okay," Steve breathed as Shuri tapped Tony's nanite case, her eyebrows twitching as the damaged armour began flowing back inside it.
"And… uh… I'm not exactly sure," he said under his breath, barely able to hold on as the suit he was riding abruptly changed course again. He scanned its head and neck area, figuring that the team was targeting that section for a reason. "Below the neck, below the neck, below the neck. Ah yeah, there it is!"
"And you know that I agree with you, mo grá," Steve said carefully. "And so do the rest of us. Director Fury never said that we shouldn't be prepared, just that it's… unlikely."
And now came the hard part. Convincing Phillips had been relatively easy since he was sick and tired of the constant war. Convincing the rest of the military government, though, would not be.
don't talk like that. Peter loves you so much. Even before I really got to know him I could tell that he adored you beyond words. He was always talking about how smart you are, and how important your work was." He curled his arm around Tony's shoulders, hugging him close. "You're his hero."
Steve laughed, an action that had been so rare lately that it almost felt foreign. "Well, you do always say that I'd made a horrible spy."
he thought, his immediate reaction being that there could be no possible way that this Doctor List person was telling the truth.
"Stacy said quite a few things that night," Steve grumbled. "But I thought we determined that he was just ranting because he was frustrated, and not really a threat?"
Steve drew in a deep breath, his eyes already fuzzy with unshed tears at the looks of awe from his teammates. "No longer am I going to be just another piece in someone’s game. From this day forward, our world will be going forward! This is the fight of our lives, and we're gonna win it!"
"Okay." Steve turned a page in his beat-up notebook, rereading a few of the notes he'd scribbled earlier that morning. "Um… I'll be there in a couple minutes, okay?"
"Oh, really?" Steve asked, grinning wickedly as he did it again, this time going even slower and deeper. "You think so, huh?"
Somehow, over the years, the genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist had managed to drop the playboy part of that equation, replacing it first with father, then with husband.
"Nah, the training at least gives him something to do," Tony said. "And it's also in a controlled setting with people who would all rather die than hurt him, so it's really the best thing for him. He gets to pretend to be a superhero and burn off some steam, and we get a little less grumpy kid."
"Well, at least there's that," muttered Steve. He had absolutely no reason not to trust Sam, so if Sam thought that he and Peter could work through Peter's nightmares on their own then Steve wasn't going to say anything. He and Tony had just had a conversation about that very thing a few nights ago, following Peter's fifteenth birthday dinner. As Peter enjoyed reminding them from time to time, he was a teenager now, and Steve and Tony were trying to give him the space he desired while still keeping as close an eye on him as they could.
Tony let out a heavy sigh, pushing his glasses up his nose. "All right, then we may as well get going. Phillips already dismissed me for the day."
After swearing to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth so help them God, Tony and Steve retook their seats, waiting expectantly as Senator Davis cleared his throat, giving Tony that politician's smile of his that always made his skin crawl.
Steve thought, squeezing his eyes closed as another starburst of pain shot up his left leg to his knee. His foot felt like it had been stomped on by something heavy and metal, which didn't make too much sense since he couldn't remember encountering anything metal that could take steps, but given that this was HYDRA, Steve wasn't putting anything past them.
Because while JARVIS hadn't yet been able to determine who had accessed Quentin Beck's renegade server after their infamous meeting, the UI
"My King!" cried General Okoye as she rushed forward, only to be repelled in the same way. Steve was next, managing to knock Thanos' arm away with his shield just long enough to take a swing at his head. The blow was as strong as Steve could deliver, but it barely even registered with Thanos as he drew back his own right fist, punching Steve so hard across the face that for a moment he blacked out. He came to in a rush, barely able to blink his eyes open against the harsh white light beaming down from the tops of the trees.
“Ah huh,” says Tony.  “Well… have you ever wondered how Strucker managed to get it away from there so fast?”
"Good evening, Miss Stacy," Dad said through the passenger window as they approached the truck. "Thanks for keeping Pete in one piece for us."
"On it!" Rhodey replied in a boom of afterburners, flying past Tony while launching his own grenades. One of them happened to explode right next to the suit's leg, knocking it off-course just enough for Tony to re-aim his laser below the thing's neck, knocking out the critical power relay as he breathed out a huge sigh of relief.
Tony shifted impatiently as he waited for ole Crotchety Phillips to finish blathering on about his various educational and intellectual achievements, fighting against the strong urge to roll his eyes at the utter lack of interest on the faces of the pilots seated in front of him. Only Carol seemed to be even making an attempt at listening, which Tony found particularly funny since thanks to Rhodey, she probably already knew all the stuff that Phillips was telling them.
The corners of Dad's lips quirked up into the slightest of smiles. "Sure thing. Go on and brush your teeth, yeah?"
And, as much as Tony liked to complain—good naturedly, at least—about how much Thor liked to eat and the occasional power surges when he was messing around with his hammer, he had to admit that having him around had been especially good for both Peter and Steve. Peter's nightmares had been pretty bad ever since the water monster incident, and hadn't been responding to any of their usual tricks until Thor volunteered to start sparring with Peter, hoping that it would help tire him out enough to sleep a bit better. Peter had been sparring with Steve from time to time before the incident at the lake, but ever since Steve's horrible dream of seeing Peter as a Winter Soldier he hadn't been able to bring himself to fight against him, even if it was only in training.
"I wasn't keeping secrets!" Tony said, dangerously close to shouting. "I was just—" He drew back, shaking his head. "Look. You were already so upset about the fact that I flew that missile through the portal—"
"C'mon, baby, stay with me," he ordered. Steve's eyes were still open, but Tony couldn't tell if it was because he was still awake or they were just frozen in place. "JARVIS, where the hell is Barton?"
And not at all what he would've expected from the son of Howard Stark, the infamous Langaran traitor.
"Yeah, yeah, I got it, Pep, thanks," Tony said, pinching the bridge of his nose. "I'm gonna have Bruce take a look too, see what he thinks, but I'll let you know first thing tomorrow at the latest, all right?"
“Thank you, Agent Fury,” Steve said softly.  He held out his hand, which Fury eagerly shook.  “I can’t tell you how much this means.  To all of us.”
But even so, the elimination of HYDRA as a threat would allow Tony to focus all of his attention on the imminent Chitauri threat, which, based on the increasing severity of his nightmares, was only getting worse with every day that passed.
"But—!" Joseph said, the high-pitched tone reverberating throughout his head like a ping-pong ball. The attacking aircraft hadn't slowed down at all, and Joseph knew that he only had about ten more seconds until it would be past the point of no return.
"Well, young Peter was near death when I found them, and Tony was gravely injured, so they were first airlifted to the base hospital for rest and recovery, and once it was determined that Peter was well enough to be moved, we returned to the United States."
appreciate it if you didn't mention him around anyone else, and that includes Tony," said Steve. "At least not for awhile. There's… a lot of mitigating circumstances with him that I know Tony doesn't want being talked about around the base."
"Well, they weren't exactly all that difficult, but I'll definitely take my share of the credit," said Natasha. "As will Clint."
"If you actually mean is he eating practically everything in sight, Captain, then the answer is yes. His appetite has been especially voracious in the past few days."
Justin Hammer, a complete asshole who never had an original idea in his life, compare his slapped together monstrosities built with stolen alien tech with the Iron Man armour that Tony built to personally exact revenge on the terrorists who tortured his beloved boy and killed Yinsen?
"Good," said Steve. "Now, as soon as JARVIS has completed your travel arrangements, you can be on your way."
Not that Steve will ever get a chance to do anything more than look, but… apparently, he has a type.
"Can I?" he asked, so sincerely that one might've thought it was their first night together. Tony's eyes burned with tears as he gulped, finally nodding a few heartbeats later. Slowly, Steve slipped his fingers underneath the worn fabric, sliding his palm back up Tony's stomach and chest as the tank top pooled over his wrist, finally working it over Tony's head and tossing it aside.
"Thor?" he said again a few heartbeats later, peeling his eyelids open a fraction of a millimetre at a time. His ears were rumbling with the sound of rushing blood, but he still was able to hear the
"Hey, yourself," Steve replied, leaning down for a quick kiss. Or at least, what he intended to be a quick kiss that somehow turned into a thirty-second makeout session. He had noticed that both he and Tony had been more intense with their physical affection lately, and whether it was out of anxiousness about the mission or Peter—or both, which was arguably more likely—Steve couldn't help but enjoy it.
Steve's dewy cheeks flushed pink as he shifted on his feet. "In the hangar you looked like you were upset, so… I just wanted to make sure that everything was okay."
"Oh my God, that sounds awful!" Peter exclaimed. "And I thought it was impossible to destroy Mjolnir!" Peter couldn't even imagine Uncle Thor without his ubiquitous hammer; it would be like Papa losing his shield or Dad trying to fight without his armour.
"I'm trying, I'm trying," Steve muttered. He bit down on his bottom lip to keep from groaning as he pulled himself up using the metal railing, looking down at the tank just in time for Rumlow to aim and fire again. Steve leapt off the fire escape just in time, jumping down on top of a massive trash compactor before landing on the ground a metre or two away from his shield.
"Yep," said Tony as he, James, and Sam came to hover about twenty metres above the wizards' shields, with Quill and Carol taking up flanking positions. "Waiting on your signal, hon."
"Shh," Gwen said as she brushed her fingers across Peter's lips. "It's not Spider-Man that I'm gonna miss, Peter."
And he had always been right. No matter the cost, ever since that day in the middle of the desert, Steve had always come through for them.
Steve smirked as he tightened his grip, resting his chin in the valley of Tony's hipbone. "I learned from the best, sweetheart."
Steve allowed himself a small smile. A promotion to Major would've meant a lot more to him a few months ago, when he wasn't busy planning a complete overthrow of the military government. He honestly hadn't given a lot of thought to how the military might look afterwards, once all the dust had settled, but at the moment he didn't much care. All that mattered to him was keeping his family safe, with Peter being able to have his operation at the very top of the list.
"Here we go, little guy," Papa said softly as he set Peter down on the living room couch, with he and Dad settling in on either side of him while Dr Cho took out her stethoscope to listen to Peter's chest.
"It's gonna be okay, Steve," James said, barely audible through the rush of blood past his ears. "It's gonna be okay."
"There's no way Liz's parents would let her have a party without them there," Peter said. "They're almost as strict as you guys."
Fighting the urge to jump for joy, Tony raised his other arm and planted his right leg slightly behind him, assuming his usual repulsor firing position.
"Nevermind that now," Tony said firmly. Peter didn't need to know any of the gory details, the kid was already spooked enough as it was. "I'm sorry I woke you, buddy, but I just—"
