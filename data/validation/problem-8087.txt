Very slowly, Steve allowed his head to drop forward in his hands. He felt all of them staring at him, their eyes anxious.
Steve’s hands were everywhere. He was always very enthusiastically into the sex they’d had. It was as though he was studying Tony like he did with his history books. His fingers caressed his shoulders, kneading a gentle massage before he turned Tony around on his stomach. Then his mouth was back on Tony’s skin, kissing a trail down his back. He bent him forward. An arm around his waist kept him steady, and Tony put his hands on the headboard of their bed. When Steve licked the small of Tony’s back, Tony arched and shuddered, instinctively pressing backwards against him.
. Couldn’t Steve let him get a breather? Tony was
As if in a haze, Steve walked into the dressing room, opening one of the many closets warily. Those were clearly Tony’s clothes, but beside them…
, but what came out was: “I couldn’t bear the thought of no longer having you in my life.”
By the time the world returned to him, he was dizzy with sensation.
* * *
“We can help you, Wanda,” Tony gritted out. “I know you hate me for what happened to your parents. I know you had to watch them die, and trust me, if I could go back in time and can SI’s weapon’s production long before you were even born, I would. In a heartbeat.”
Steve cringed. He had hoped Bucky wouldn’t confirm his suspicions about the procedure, and he wanted to rip something apart in his sudden rage. Not wanting Bucky to see the fury he knew was flickering in his eyes, he lowered his gaze to the floor. “I’m so sorry, Buck,” he whispered.
It was true, and… Ultron’s words haunted him. Fake vision or not, he’d been wrong about one thing. It wasn’t a weakness, no. It might just be their greatest strength.
That was… It was… Tony blinked. “You… you did all this, staying by my side, for—
That said, he pulled at his underwear, stepped out of it and—and threw it on top of the tank top already lying on the floor.
Natasha jumped to their side out of nowhere, and leaned down to check Tony’s body for injuries, freezing when she noticed what was probably a lot of blood soaking right through his shirt. “Stay awake, okay?” she asked softly.
Tony hummed.
“Step back,” Vision said, landing right next to Natasha. “Let them.”
Tony stared at all of them for a long disbelieving minute. “Are you all kidding me?”
* * *
, the young Tony called, and behind him, Steve saw Tony,
Bucky chose that instant to wrap his arm around her. "Textbook romance," he agreed. “And soon to be wed, however the hell that happened.”
It was slow. The teachers were simply not interested in quelling their boredom anymore. Which was fine except for times like now. With the upcoming road trip hanging above Tony’s head like a guillotine, he could use an excuse to get distracted without the added bonus of consequences.
“Oh, shut up,” Steve said and tried to keep the panic from his voice. Did Natasha know? God, Natasha probably knew. He kept looking at her, but her expression betrayed nothing.
“Your habit of falling off of things is getting out of hand.”
I love you," Steve said, unprompted. "So much, Tony. You're amazing."
Steve leaned closer, his face barely an inch away from Tony’s, which, for some reason, had Tony’s heartbeat quickening. “You didn’t touch that sandwich I brought you last night. You haven’t eaten since your burger yesterday at lunch.” He tapped a finger to the counter and shot Tony a look of pure superiority. “Now eat. It’s time someone takes care of your well-being, since you obviously won’t do it yourself.”
This could not be a good idea, Steve thought as he followed Bucky's confident stride towards the elevator. For a man whose life wasn't exactly on the right track, Bucky had a carefree air about him that Steve envied, and the thought made him shake his head at himself. Envied Bucky? Really?
Steve hadn’t only beaten the shit out of him, he’d lied to him—kept secrets from him, and thus destroyed whatever friendship there had ever been between them.
When Tony sat down on the bench in front of Barnes’ room, the man in question was sitting on his bed with open eyes. His face didn’t have that empty, numb expression anymore. Instead, he was looking at Tony with a look that was half annoyance and half curiosity.
Ian rubbed his nose along Tony’s chest, his chubby hands pulling his shirt in so he could drool down on it.
“That must’ve been Obi’s idea,” Tony said on a long, resigned sigh. “I told him not to make a fuss. I swear, the man makes it difficult to remember who works for whom.”
Tony was very aware of the bulge pressed against his stomach, and slowly, he remembered their not-so-intimate environment. He gasped against Steve’s lips. This was Massachusetts, and the campus was only a few blocks away, and Tony was sort of famous and… this had the potential of getting very bad very fast.
“Your words, not mine,” Bucky said, grinning widely as he stood up and made to leave.
The buzzing continued unabated. Jesus, his head hurt. He groaned out loud, stood up very carefully and looked around for his pants.
Natasha backed away. “You don’t look okay.”
This. This was how it should’ve been between them all along.
“You married a Stark?!”
you said it!”
The night went on encompassed in complete silence. Tony sat on the edge of the bed with his back to Steve, while he took a seat in the reading chair. Tony’s shoulders were tense, head down, fingers wringing together. Occasionally, he’d nip from his glass, but didn’t speak again. They just sat, not looking at each other.
“JARVIS, what’s going on with Tony?”
“Just like that?” Fury asked slowly, his eye narrowing.
a position,” Tony said.
Nothing ever changed. He woke. He travelled. He killed. He slept. From his seat in the plane, he stared down at the world and waited for it to make sense. He sat for hours and waited for the voice inside his head to make sense.
And how wrong he’d been about him for a very long time.
Tony thought, then he stomped all those feelings down. It wasn’t the time. Soon, if he could man up about it—but not today. “Sure. Thanks.”
One hundred and twenty-two long, agonizing hours.
“Steve…”
Clint sighed. “Honestly, guys, he looks kind of like… a sack o’ potatoes.” He glanced up at Bruce. “Are you sure his mind hasn’t turned into jelly?”
“I really have,” Steve admitted unashamedly. He loved what Tony did to him—
Tony pulled back at that, looking down at him. “You do?” he asked softly, an awed look flashing across his beautiful face. “You wanna stay here?”
And yet, he’d never grasped the real truth behind Tony’s words. The truth that did not only question everything that had ever happened between them, but a truth that literally questioned
become friends, Steve had found himself seriously considering it.
“Says you,” Tony echoed back at him, smiling softly, only broken by a chocked-up gasp after one particularly deep thrust of his fingers.
, who are… you are a genius. You don’t need my services. You don’t need to resort to—”
These days, whenever Tony crossed paths with Steve, his posture was always stiff and uncomfortable. Steve had tried to talk to him, several times, but Tony blocked every feeble attempt. He’d put Steve on various online black lists, had deleted his contacts, and Steve was almost sure all of his emails and messages were automatically spam-filtered.
Every night leading up to the USO tour in Italy.
“Keeping the turrets busy. Won’t make it to our checkpoint. Sorry.”
“I don’t know if they’d want to see me again,” Steve said.
, looking delicious, and he was suddenly hungry as hell, so he cast Steve another smile and reached for one, taking a bite, and then another.
Fear gripped him; insidious, chilly tendrils curling up and wrapping around his stomach, creeping upwards toward his heart. If Barnes hurt Steve—or worse, if something happened to Steve because Tony hadn’t been at his side, he’d never forgive himself.
Tony scrunched up his nose. “Stop saying that. I’m not… ready for you to say things like that.”
“Shit,” Natasha exhaled, and Steve realized he had never heard her curse before. So it had to be bad.
Rhodey shifted and produced the road map they’d been working on for the last month or so. “I already told everyone that they could only come along, Tones. And a few minor changes won’t ruin anything… I know that you’re upset but we really should look at the bigger picture.”
Tony rolled his eyes, but his smile stayed firmly in place. “Was that sass? I’m feeling sassed right now,” he teased, nudging Steve’s nose with his. “Just… trust me with this? If you think we’re going too slow, you can tell me. We don’t have to make a big deal out of it, I just… I’d love for us to take it a little slower this time around.”
“Did you forgive him? For what he did?”
“2018,” Bruce said, very slowly.
Steve nodded curtly. Tony grimaced as he eased him down onto the spare bed, and winced even more as he kneeled over his crotch and set to work, getting plate after plate off of Tony’s body with marksman precision.
, Steve, I never thought I could fall for someone so deeply.”
Well, he’d promised revels.
Tony hadn’t heard from Natasha and Bruce in over a week. All communication systems were down. Steve, Sam and Barnes—they had kept loose contact, fighting the fight in Europe with their own team. They hadn’t exactly worked together since Thanos had arrived—they’d only been on a need-to-know talking base, calling each other once a week to make sure they were still alive and fighting.
The noise didn’t care. The more he tried to ignore it, the louder and more shrill it got.
Steve snorted and followed Tony’s thoughtful gaze. Bucky’s cufflinks were hexagon-shaped, with geometric patterns along the border, and black engravings on its white-golden surface. He remembered vaguely that they’d belonged to Bucky’s grandfather once, and it was almost surreal that Tony had found them in some World War Two museum.
“1996,” Steve told her quietly. “I didn’t know for most of the time. When they told me it was only a few days before I went under.”
Next to him, Clint huffed with a long-suffering expression. Natasha only chuckled softly and boxed him into the side.
, tell me. I… I don’t
It was as exhilarating as it was frightening. This new body was very obviously meant to fight, to endure the heaviest strain, the longest exertion. And yet, he was sitting here, in this slightly run-down motel room, doing absolutely nothing.
“No,” Tony interrupted him fiercely. “I never loved her. I never thought I was capable of hating another person like that. And I wasn’t. Not until I met her.” He paused. “You really didn’t know I love you?”
“Good,” Steve told him, then stormed forward.
the voice said.
what had happened on that day. Hell, he could still smell the nighttime alleys he'd run through in his memories...
.” Steve bit his lower lip. “Imagine my surprise. He kind of kissed me the moment I arrived there. Didn’t know I wasn’t his husband.”
It turned out an hour was only just about enough time for her to prepare Tony before he had to take off to Washington. He was steamed, plucked and primped. It had been years since she’d done this for him, and Tony felt a familiar warmth spread through him. “Thank you,” he told her quietly as he fastened his tie.
Tony sighed, covering the granted space between them and slowly sat down on the bed next to Steve. He draped an arm around his waist, shivered off his warmth, and willed himself as close as he could get.
Tony’s calm expression began to fall. There was open sorrow in his gaze now that had Steve’s insides tremble with confusion. Were their opinions really that different and he just hadn’t noticed?
. He marveled at how Steve could make him happy to see him and thoroughly furious, and really, really pissed off and annoyed, all at the same time. He kneeled next to Tony, looking down at him, and as much as Tony was glad to see him, he also kind of wanted to punch him in the face.
“Forever,” he agreed and pulled Tony even closer.
His hands traveled from Steve’s chest to his arms, grazing lightly downward until, finally, Tony laced his fingers with Steve’s.
“Tent?” he mumbled.
Fury shook his head slowly, eye trained on the phone in his hand. He started to type, then turned the device around.
The words echoed in Steve’s mind. Tony had never loved Indries.
“I’ve got you,” he whispered and everything in Steve relaxed all at once. Tony smiled at the gesture, and then he pushed inside Steve, one fluid thrust, grunting as his warmth surrounded him. When he was fully seated, he pressed soft kisses on Steve’s spine, and set a sweet and slow pace, pivoting his hips just so.
"But that's a five hour drive! And he invited
Tony snorted against Steve’s lips, but drew back anyway. He squeezed Steve’s hand gently, before he settled back into his seat and closed his eyes.
Steve shook his head. “Sorry, not buying it. You're telling me that I went to so much trouble and got so close only to turn around and leave? That’s not like me.”
“Give him some space!” Barnes snapped.
“Hmmm…
“There you go,” Tony said with a low smile, leaning in and dropping soft kisses across Steve’s chest. Gently, he pulled out and added a bit more lube before pressing two fingers against Steve’s opening. He gave him a second to comprehend, then slowly pushed forward. It went in easier than expected—he
“I always figured Tony wouldn’t want children,” Natasha mused softly.
Fury shoved a hand in his jacket’s pocket and handed Tony a piece of paper.
Back then, Tony hadn’t seen that the Accords had too easily defined superheroes as weapons, something to be deployed like an arm of the military. This bill they’d worked on, it was instead founded on trust—not on fear or force. During the mess with Zemo, nearly all of them had gotten distracted from a hero’s main responsibility: to help and protect. But with any chance, they could do exactly that for the years to come, if only the UN agreed to sign this.
“Wonderful,” Steve exhaled, then louder, “That’s real mature!”
“Master Rogers,” he greeted him and Steve felt himself blush at the foreign title. “Master Anthony wanted me to inform you that Mrs. and Mister Hogan will arrive in about half an hour.”
Steve hummed, a beautiful crooked grin playing with his lips. “Yeah, that’s… highly unusual.”
had happened since this morning?
—you didn’t kill anyone. HYDRA did. And now, come on. The shop’s downstairs. Won’t even take half an hour.”
At least, he didn’t look disgusted or anything. Tony hadn’t been exactly sure how Obi’d react to the whole being into guys, and—
to believe Tony was right so badly. He wanted to believe they could make this work. And for Tony, he needed to give it a try. His heart had been too long in love. Too long Tony’s and Tony’s alone. There was no way he and Steve would be standing on opposite sides. Not ever.
Steve really didn’t want to think more about what had happened last night, but he couldn’t forget it either. Tony was there, and dream or not, it was definitely the same Tony he’d kissed only hours ago.
“Of course,” Tony said. “Unless you have any objections to that?”
With a low breath, Bucky sat down, and within the next minutes, Tony busied himself with getting the arm back in place. His movements were precise and efficient, just as the few times Tony had worked on his arm before.
Clearly, she wouldn’t be making it easy for him.
He let go of Steve’s hands then, leaving it to him to pull the thing off, while Tony made quick work of his pants. It was easy enough to drag it down his hips, but the legs were tight as hell and Tony snorted when he had to hop up and down a little not to lose balance. “Yeah this is undignified,” he said, and leaned against Steve so he could drag his left foot free.
—but he couldn’t. “I…”
His words were followed by a small nod. “That must’ve been something.”
Steve’s shoulders straightened slightly. “I’m glad you called, by the way.”
Unexpectedly, Peggy stirred at the sound of his voice. Slowly, she opened her still beautiful blue eyes and reached for his hand. She didn’t make a sound, and Steve watched as her mouth fell open, mimicking the shape of the words he spoke.
discuss this. I’m not saying this document shouldn’t undergo a few changes, but it’s a draft, we can work on it. I know you wish you could put down your foot and the problem will simply go away, but it
Tony hugged himself and studied Steve’s profile. He almost looked exactly like his own Steve had, only his hair was a bit longer… and there was a light scruff on his cheeks. He looked somehow rougher than before. Tony turned his gaze straight ahead and, for just a minute, reveled in being with Steve, verbally sparring with him again, having him near again.
Tony yelped when Steve threw himself over the back of his seat, right into the place between him and Natasha. As soon as he heard Steve’s muffled grunt from the impact of the attack, the Winter Soldier was in front of the car in a flash, and a second later, Tony heard the
"What the—" Steve started asking, then shook his head. The dust spread quickly and engulfed a small section of the ground, reaching to where Clint and Natasha stood. Natasha was closer, alternating zapping the creature with her stingers and shooting it with her pistols, while Clint was a little ways behind her now, firing arrow after arrow, hoping one of them would work. Steve could tell the two were getting a good whiff of the stuff. He himself was completely immersed in it.
“I’ll be in slow motion. You’ll see it coming. You respond at any speed. Whatever comes naturally, okay?”
Next to Maria, Natasha grinned knowingly, and obviously sensed that there was good gossip at hand. “And tomorrow’s the big day? Finally?”
Mister Stark grinned as well. “It made you smile, so it was at least a
Bucky’s eyes narrowed. “Gonna have to make it count then.”
They were still for long moments—timid and quiet. “Thank you for giving this a try,” Steve told him honestly.
Ian bashfully turned his head to the side, burying it into Tony’s shoulder. Almost indiscernible, he shook his head.
Vision shifted closer to her, which had Pietro roll his eyes. “We would protect you.”
“What if he’s not himself?” Sam asked. He followed Steve down the streets, however, not even waiting for an explanation.
“We could always fake his signature,” Tony said, only half-joking.
Steve could feel the sting of tears beginning behind his eyes. He wanted to look away from Tony, but his gaze seemed to hold him in thrall, and he couldn’t break the connection. “I made a vow,” he said. “And I’m sticking to it. No matter what.”
Steve smacked his lips together, eyes twinkling devilishly. “Maybe.”
“Pepper is keeping him company.”
Tony sighed, but he didn’t say anything more for a good minute. Instead, he started pacing. He walked about the room, his eyes sometimes dropping on the half-filled tumbler that dutifully waited for him on the nightstand. He never walked over there, though, instead he kept brushing his fingers through his hair as he walked.
“Hands off. I know I don’t look like it, but I could shoot you in the head in about one point five seconds.”
With a sigh, Tony looked at his hand, so close to Steve’s. Finally he said, “You left the team.”
sap, and kissed him chastely. “I love you. A bit more every day. I don’t tell you enough.”
“You filthy piece of crap!” a man yelled and the words echoed all across the ballroom. He was staring down at Tony with furious eyes, pointing a finger in his direction. He was even shorter than Tony, in his mid-forties, and Steve was about to restrain him, but Tony held up a hand. “Let him,” Tony murmured, as he wiped his face.
All the while, Tony’s hands were practically wrapped around Steve’s constantly. It felt great, to show his affections like that, but the more time passed, the more Tony had to think: Only two days, and he’ll be gone. Two days, and we’ll have to end it again.
Steve watched Bucky fly all across the room and into the next wall. He couldn’t shake his stupor until Tony took stance to fly after Bucky—his helmet now firmly in place—and only just managed to hold him back with a grab of his hand.
[New Client2] [chat_server:46956]
It would take a long time for Tony to wrap his head around that, but… no matter what would happen from here on out… there had been a version of Steve who’d once had said ‘yes’ to him.
“So, Steve,” Clint said as he flopped down on the couch, “tell us what it’s like to live in 2022?”
“Steve?” Tony prompted.
“You’re my friend!” Steve shot back, grief causing his mask of indifference to drop. “We needed to get out, so I did.”
He started to trash against his restraints, eager to leave that foul, claustrophobic place and to find some fresh air. Yet when he tried, he realized that he could not sit up. There was little more than a four-inch gap between his face and the lid of the box in which he now resided. Because it was a box, he realized. A box made out of metal he could not open, could not break through. There was some sort of spyhole right in front of his face, a window so thick with ice that looking through it was impossible.
“Well, hello, Picasso,” he said and cast him a wicked grin.
“He is right about this,” Thor added, smiling at him reassuringly and clapping a hand on Steve’s shoulder, before he walked closer to the cradle.
“You don’t have to, baby,” he told him, petting his head gently, as he tried to school his expression so he wouldn’t look disappointed.
“No, but it powers something that does. I’ll… I’ll show you later.”
“For a while there I thought they weren’t gonna get you patched up again,” he whispered.
“Maybe it’ll get clearer when we reach the camp,” Steve said and realized all too late that he’d already lost Tony again.
Thanks for reading. Hope you enjoyed it :)
“Pepper I grant you, but that’s not on you, buddy. You’re only friends with Pepper because she’s a saint and actually made an effort of looking past your bullshit. You
“Nope.”
“Tame?” Tony asked, his hips jerking forward to meet Steve’s fingers.
Ross reluctantly sat down, taking the seat opposite where Steve was sitting. The four senators were silent sentinels at his back.
. But he knew that the chances they’d make it out on the other end were slim to none.
With that, Jarvis left and Steve could only stare after him.
think it’s strange?”
Tony huffed—a shaky little sound. “I don’t know what this is,” he whispered. “It’s either driving me mad or bringing me back to life… and fuck if I know which.”
He didn’t realize that Tony had stepped out of the elevator until the room fell completely still.
“So he really wants to see this through,” Tony mumbled. “Stubborn bastard.”
Steve smiled right back at him. “I’d say.”
“No, not really.” Steve was sitting in the reading chair next to the large window front, a book in his hands.
There was a pause. “And, on the off chance that you can hear me, I… I understand what you said. About needing time. And, I would give it to you, if I knew I’d have another chance, but… this might be it, right? Who knows what comes after this, if there’s even an ‘after this’. I just… I really like you, Steve. In a completely not-platonic way. Well, also in a platonic way, but… yeah, you get the drift. And I think you at least find me attractive, right? So on the off chance that we won’t be seeing each other after this trip is over, I want to make the most of the time we have…”
“As I said: You trust me,” Steve said, shrugging. “Come on. Let’s go.”
“We’re all night owls, Stark,” Bucky replied good-naturedly, raising his voice for the first time. “
Agitated, he shot Bucky a look, nodding towards the truck’s opening. Bucky understood immediately, and sprinted for the rear hatch, where the cradle rested. Natasha made a grab for the robot attempting to intercept Bucky, holding onto its helmet and smashing it on the ground.
He’d deal with it, obviously. It wasn’t as if he’d ever had any hope of sparking Steve’s interest. That was a ridiculous thought. But seeing the reminder of his marital happiness still felt like a punch to the gut every damn time.
"Wait Steve—" Bucky called after him, but he was out of earshot and didn't hear what he had to say after that.
“Yeah,” Steve confirmed. “We only just regrouped to fight Thanos.”
It didn't stop at a simple press of lips, either. Steve had spent long enough thinking about what it might feel like to seriously kiss Tony, that he couldn't stop himself. His tongue pressed forward, sliding easily between pliant lips and tasting, teasing. A small sound left him at the feel of it all. It's been so long since he'd kissed anyone.
“You’re gonna regret this in the morning, hm?” Tony whispered after a while. They’d be at the campus in a few moments, and the idea of bringing Steve to the dorm had quickly flown out of the window. Tony had no idea who they’d be running into, and there was no real explanation why Tony would be letting a professor sleep in his room.
We would also like to thank our readers for all your lovely comments. We were very pleased you enjoyed our protective!Natasha.
young to be flirting like this with older men, that was for sure. His hair was a dark mess and Steve couldn't tell if it was intentional or not, and those brown eyes twinkled with mischief. Combining that with the unrefined flirting, Steve was confused beyond what he was comfortable with.
The smile didn’t fade, but Steve only nodded. Didn’t matter if Tony acknowledged it, but the two had gotten along far better than they did a year ago. Calling them friends was likely pushing it a little, but they did share jokes, and had a mutual obsession with Mario Kart and Frappuccino coffee, so it wasn’t that far off either.
“This might be a really bad idea.”
(See the end of the chapter for
But Steve didn’t.
How long they remained like that, looking at each other without saying anything, Steve didn’t know. Only that it seemed hours before he finally found it in himself to walk further into the room.
“No, it
Next to him, Bucky sighed, and his gaze narrowed. “Steve. It wasn’t your fault.”
Steve snorted and nuzzled Tony’s jawline. “Rather bend you over something,” he mumbled.
Also, Tony might or might not have been some kind of toga-wearing senator in Rome in one of his past lives. That was, if that complete bogus concept wasn’t total crap, which honestly, it probably was.
, we need to—oh, well, never mind.”
end you—their combined force is simply too much for one soul to handle.”
“Yes,” Natasha said with a sympathetic smile. Steve didn’t know her all that long, but he’d gathered that she was very empathetic. And he had a feeling she could read him like a book. “I can almost guarantee he can do it. I could ask him to come over sometime, then you can tell him everything you know.”
His eyes landed on the aspirin Rhodey had placed at his disposal; the scent of fresh coffee hit the air. With another sigh, Tony snatched the pills and obediently followed his nose.
Tony also still had this on and off thing with Pepper going—and he was straight, as far as Steve knew.
He knew how it had ended, too.
“That’s what you get for marrying a bullhead like me,” Tony whispered.
Steve hummed. He somehow felt bad for dragging Natasha from Bucky’s side and vice versa, especially in a situation like this. “Didn’t think he should join us either way. Maybe it’s for the better, if Ultron can get to him… the risk really is too high.”
“Down in the cellar. Now that the Infinity Stones are destroyed, I’m sure they’ll just use it to hoard even more books.”
, simple as that. Unable to help himself, Steve brushed his nose along Ian’s head, inhaling the wonderful unique scent.
During the last weeks, Tony had predicted almost every attack by random villains, giving the team pointers as to what they needed to do. It was risky business, but Tony just couldn’t stand on the sideline, waiting for one of his teammates to get hurt. Last week, he’d also outed Clint’s family at a team dinner because he’d forgotten that he wasn’t supposed to know about Laura and the kids, and only barely managed to gloss it over with his ever-favorite JARVIS-alibi.
He held on to Steve's head for dear life, fingers trembling against his neck while he pressed his back against Steve's chest. With the hand around his dick, moving in perfect sync to Steve's steady thrusts, the pressure built quickly. It radiated from his core, spreading heated flames to the tips of his fingers and the soles of his feet.
On the next beat, Steve tugged at Tony’s arm to spin him, then pulled him close again.
It seemed that now that he knew this might be his future—
involve breaking into a castle and thus breaking about twenty international laws. It was about the last thing they needed right now. After they’d defeated Thanos, they had regained some of the respect they’d lost during the Sokovia fiasco. And yet—one wrong move and they’d be back to square one. And really, Tony couldn’t go through that again.
He waved at the house in front of them, and
. This was where he belonged. Where Tony belonged, too. In Steve’s arms, his hands hooked behind his neck, his face tilted upward in anticipation of his kiss.
The door crashed open, and another HYDRA agent flew between them. He landed on his backside and skidded several feet into some shelves. Tony and Steve both turned to look through the windows at the commotion in the stockroom. Thor and Sam were in there, knocking around a few more men, and Clint rushed forward to take on the others.
“I’ll get there,” Steve promised and his voice was raw silk. Steve caught Tony’s hands in his and brought them to his lips, then held them out of the way as he leaned in. Tony thought he meant to kiss him again, but Steve gave his mouth a pass and went straight for his shoulder, sucking at the spot where it joined his neck. His lips and tongue delicately traced the same path along Tony’s collarbone that his finger had earlier. He let go of Tony’s hands and ran his own slowly down Tony’s body, thumbs scraping his nipples as his fingers molded themselves to his every inch, mindful of his wounds, finally coming to rest on his hips. Steve rubbed his hands over the skin of Tony’s stomach, bringing them up to hold the back of his neck as he nuzzled his ear.
He figured Obi had only wanted to introduce him real quick—the new golden goose that'd make the rich even richer—but Tony had taken one good look at his board, and decided then and there that things wouldn’t play out like that.
“He has that effect on people,” Rhodey agreed with a grin.
“I have a secondary mission,” Natasha told him without premonition.
Tony paused, looking up at him. There was a light pinch between his eyebrows as he stared at Steve, like he wasn’t sure where to put him.
“Rugrats? It’s all one and the same. Could call them hell-spawn if you want.”
Steve made a face at him, but did as he was told. He wound an arm around Tony and pulled him near, moving them back and forth until he could take a decent selfie of them both and the mirror.
It just wasn’t possible.
“Right. Steve, you gotta hold him down. Tony,” Bruce pursed his lips in sympathy. “Don’t fight blacking out.”
It would likely be a good idea to follow Steve’s lead for now—Tony had to admit that. He knew Steve was afraid to muck up his future—and Tony didn’t want to be responsible for ruining it.
“You want to quit?” Steve asked, and he already knew that it didn’t really matter what his answer would be. Whatever Tony wanted to do with his life—Steve would be at his side for it.
“I’m just saying. It would be much easier if it was
“Tony…” he started, hesitating as he searched for the right words. “About Stane. I—I think there’s something wrong with him.”
“Sure,” Tony confirmed all too quickly. “I told you the documents can be amended.”
Steve hummed. “Pretty sure Bucky has nothing to do with this.”
“No,” Steve said. “I only meant if you need a timeout—we don’t have to go right this week.”
At any rate, Tony winced when he saw him.
Tony’s eyes hesitantly drifted upwards, clashing with Steve’s blue ones. They were a deep sea of shock and the world around Tony crumbled. Steve looked real tense, and it wasn’t hard to tell this wasn’t going as he’d hoped it would.
God, but he felt empty.
Tony snorted. “I am, trust me, I am. I’m… this is already better than everything I’ve ever done before.”
“Well, it WAS my first chance to use it in your presence. Also, as the guy who
“I truly believe that this is our best shot,” Tony added, glancing at Steve for a reaction—for
Bucky’s mouth quirked upwards. After a moment, he nodded and looked relieved.
“We talked to Reed Richards, and he is sure that Doom had already gathered the Sequencer back in 2018.”
love you,” Steve tried again.
. He had become better at talking about these kinds of things, hadn’t he? Where did all of that stammering come from? Steve clamped his mouth shut and turned his head, wishing he could just make a run for the door and end this. But Natasha was his friend. So he gathered his words and tried again. “You were there for him. That’s what counts.”
(Side note: Yes, I took the name Ian from the 616 verse, with complete 100% disregard to 616!Ian Rogers’ history. I simply liked the name and the fact that Steve once loved a son and named him Ian.)
Instead, he closed his eyes and summoned the image of Steve bashfully glancing at him across the dinner table. Steve laughing a full-belly-laugh as he sparred with him. Steve swearing like a sailor over a game of Mario Kart. Steve sitting on the too-small couch in the workshop, a soft smile reaching his lips whenever Tony would turn around to ask him something.
Steve smiled. “I know. I trust you.”
Tony’s jaw clenched, and he firmly schooled his expression so he wouldn’t be giving any of those feelings inside of him away. He couldn’t let Strange of all people see how much… how much all of what had happened in those last three years had broken him. This war—this stupid, pointless power game between him and Steve, and all the wreckage that had followed. The abyss that now gaped between both of their teams, the threat of a final apocalypse looming over all of their heads, the loneliness Tony felt every day when he stood in their living room, looking at the large table that had once housed many team dinners.
, was to try and stop the team from splitting up. I tried to protect them, over and over again. And where did that get us? It was futile! I obviously wasn’t fit for the job, and I can’t watch them grieve and struggle all over again—for
Tony fought back the urge to just roll on his side and hug Steve, beg him not to cut him off again, but he knew it was futile. He could practically hear the wheels in Steve’s head spinning, could hear him scolding himself, tormenting him with what-ifs, and Tony was sure the second he’d touch him, he would freak out completely.
Clint chuckled. “Ohh… big thing, huh?”
Natasha and Tony shared a look, then after a moment of pointed and silent communication, Steve huffed out a loud breath.
“Steve never should’ve known about me!” Barnes snapped, and Tony saw the metal hand flexing at his side again. “It would’ve been better if I just—”
“How much longer?” Tony asked.
signs in the distance.
Steve cast a thoughtful glance at him, and said nothing.
Steve was drowning in sensation, completely lost in Tony. The world spun away quickly, and he wasn’t even aware of the bed beneath them, just the feel of Tony’s body and his mouth and his hands and his voice whispering indistinguishable endearments into his skin.
“That much? Aw, I knew you secretly liked me,” he said, then gave a low chuckle at his own joke.
“Go on…” Stane murmured. “Don’t be afraid to let go.”
“We’ll have to wait out the rain,” Steve said and looked to the side and at the branches over their heads. Water was already dripping into both of their hair.
be doing that, and that now was most definitely not the right time to talk to him, but he was already here and the sentence was hanging unfinished. He hurried to complete it, though it came out as a weak afterthought. "—you."
Steve returned Tony’s smile and a comfortable silence fell between them.
He’d known before it happened. JARVIS had made the calculations long before the knife even pierced his body.
“Oh! That’s why you...” Steve stopped abruptly before betraying the fact that he had been awake when Tony had touched him earlier. “I heal fast. You know that.”
He strolled.
Which was a shame.
Steve leaned back heavily, his hands pressing onto the bed. It was… a bed. He was far away from that nightmare-scape. Things came into focus again, but slower, like he was wading through water. "What…"
A man was standing over him, Steve realized, his hands bloodied and his black hair, his clothes, all gleaming wetly. His features were twisted with hatred, a thin crust of drying blood streaked across his nose and chin. He was lifting his foot to deliver another blow to Steve’s head, but this time, he saw it coming and managed to dodge. He forced himself to his feet, watching the other man warily.
right—they would work it out, with the UN and with Thanos and his army, and screw the rest of the world, they would have a whole future together, finally making it right.
no preparing for what would happen once Steve’s flashbacks were gone. Better to get his mind on a different track altogether. Tony whistled a long sigh. For now, Steve wanted him, so he would simply have to make the most of the time they had.
The sounds were truly horrifying. Howard’s choking, Maria’s whimpers and cries, the sound of bones cracking. ‘
“Is this…” Tony pressed his eyes shut.
Now Tony looked offended. “I thought we weren’t gonna talk about last night!”
of time talking, and sometime along the way, well… they’d made a plan for the next few years with the two of them splitting their time between superheroing and being… parents.
“No,” Tony said. “It’s… a bit like a migraine. It’ll pass, and we have to take care of that body first. You got it, right? The body?”
“Oh it’s a promise, not a wish. I’ll take you so deep inside, you won’t ever forget me again.”
Bruce shook his head. “You seriously think that since I’ve joined the team I’ve lived a single day not knowing what I might eventually have to do? That I might get imprisoned for being who I am? For things the Hulk did? Granted, I really hadn’t thought it might involve a few rogue Avengers—but I can do this. I’m ready to play my part.”
“Ba-ba-ba-ba,” Ian blabbered again, when Steve stepped into the room. He squealed happily as Tony pulled him out of the cradle and against his chest, turning him so that he fit comfortably in the crook of his right arm.
“It’s not that bad.”
“He is,” Steve agreed, then chuckled. “He’s also a real jerk. Infuriating, crass, arrogant… but underneath all that, he’s a good man. That’s all that ever mattered to me.”
So everyone was up and about. Everyone but Tony.
Steve stopped as he regarded them. The worried expressions, the supportive postures.
“So you’re choosing me over naked women. Good to know.”
Another day was slowly melting away. Another day before Tony left him forever.
“Yeah. But it wasn’t.” He smiled softly and kissed him. “It means a whole lot, Tony.”
“Right,” Tony said. After a moment, he quirked a smile. “That was hard for you, wasn’t it?”
“Steve!”
Anyway. Howard had rented them a pretty large RV (not the Winnebago Tony had initially planned for, but alas, minor changes to his plan were expected and calculated), they’d gathered all of the supplies (the usual camping-trip stuff, Tony’s new telescope and lots of food and beer), they had the money, and they’d had the perfect day-to-day route that would bring them to the small town of Hopkinsville (a.k.a. the 2017 eclipse’s point of ‘Greatest Duration’).
But for the way Tony was sliding over his lap and nuzzling his stomach, he had to do something now. “Tony.” Steve’s hands shot to his arms and he hauled him back up. “No. We can’t. You were angry at me.”
There was a moment of silence, and Steve had to bite back a grin when both Phil’s and Maria’s eyes kept getting drawn back to where Ian was happily gurgling in Tony’s arms. He sure was a sight to be seen.
“I’m glad you’re with me, too,” Tony answered, and even though he wasn’t stuttering anymore, the words were barely comprehensible in the midst of the storm. “For what it’s worth.”
“Tony?” Steve breathed, terrible confusion and fear leaking into his voice. The fact that he still used the name Tony had given himself upon arriving in Los Angeles and not his real name—not
Natasha stared at him. Her expression was one hundred percent blank for a long beat, then an amused smile reached her beautiful red lips. Bucky’s brain momentarily zoned out as his fingers began stroking her, begging her body for those overwhelmed trembles, those soft gasps, those tiny moans, all those signs that meant Natasha was finally losing her poised demeanor. “No one would believe how sappy you can be,” she whispered.
So, grasping his face in return, he pulled Tony in and kissed him.
He’d always hated things he didn’t understand.
“I didn’t hurt you, did I?” Steve murmured after a long moment. One of his hands was tracing what Tony thought might be the formation of a small bruise on his hips.
The smile of reassurance that crossed Rhodey’s face was only mildly comforting. He removed the washcloth the next second despite Tony’s murmur of protest, then gestured to the nightstand. “He said you’d have a bad headache,” he said. “He ran out this morning to get some aspirin. You want it now?”
“What is it?” he asked.
It felt like the end of time, the end of everything. And they all stood side by side, shoulder to shoulder, just like it was meant to be. Tony waited until Steve ducked and then let loose a blast from his gauntlet, making one of the minions that had come in Steve’s direction explode neatly. Sam was on the second one in a moment, and it too was history. The next blast missed its target by less than an inch, lodging in the robot’s shoulder, but the Hulk grabbed hold of its arms and slung it as hard as he could, breaking it in half. The robot fell on the ground, and Tony looked over to see Wanda Maximoff sprawled on the floor, a dazed look on her face.
“Look, I know it’s a bit hard to visualize all of this from a schematic alone, but… uh… I really think you might like it.”
Tony tried to keep his face in check, but his features visibly softened. “Charmer.”
“My bet was they’d kill each other two weeks in,” Maria said.
is going on here?!”
A wave of panic crushed Steve’s system. While this was exactly what he wanted, there were certain mechanics to be adhered. Tonight was a step into unknown territory. He only ever had sex once, and that had been over far too quickly, and with little finesse. He didn’t want to ruin things with Tony with sex. His heart couldn’t survive it. “I don’t even know how this works… with guys. I—”
Bruce chuckled, before glancing at Bucky. “And you? What would you like for breakfast?”
“Just ignore him,” Bruce told Natasha and Bucky. “It’s a phase.”
Tony was roused from his half-sleep by the sound of Steve’s phone vibrating on the nightstand.
“Yes,” he gasped. “Yes.”
Natasha huffed, and Steve felt torn between straightening his back and making himself smaller.
As the sun wandered across the sky, it gradually went behind a thin veil of clouds, letting them see the crescent with almost naked eyes. The sun was almost half eclipsed by now. It was like looking at the moon only a few times bigger and many times brighter.
Steve was murmuring words that might have been an agreement. Murmured broken promises into Tony’s neck as his body wound tight and he finally gasped and spilled himself between them. Something in Tony crashed and collided, and he slumped against him, touching every cell of Steve, every nerve, every inch he could reach.
“—Thursday’s roastbeef day,” Tony continued, smiling up at Bruce. “Tell Betty I said hi.”
“I have access to a decent databank. And the comparison for your current expression is someone mourning a relative at a funeral.”
not shudders racing down Steve’s spine.
A dream. That would make a lot of sense, and it’d explain the strange-looking interior of the room. Steve’s fantasy had always had a mind of its own. The question remained why Steve would dream of a guy like this. The man was irritating, and downright obscene, not to mention that he was treading on very illegal grounds and didn’t seem to care all that much.
"I don't take orders from pedophiles—"
“It helps to have someone to lean on occasionally,” was all Bucky said.
. He had the words on the tip of his tongue, but now that he faced Tony, a man who intimidated him in a way no other person had ever managed to do, all arguments seemed to fail him.
Steve shook his head. The doctors hadn’t talked to him, but he knew Tony, and he was a fighter. “Not yet, but you know Tony. Stubborn as the day is long.”
There was a reason he loved working here.
“I know,” Bucky said and grinned self-deprecatingly. “Seems like I can’t keep the bad guys outta my head.”
His façade was crumbling. Tony felt it, but could do shit about it. So he buried his face in his hands instead, feeling far too sober for a heart-to-heart conversation with the murderer of his parents.
“Yes. He’s head of security.”
, handsome,” the man said, his brown eyes sparkling as he looked Steve up and down.
Tony took a fortifying deep breath, willing the next words out of his mouth, “You need to look at the plans of the Helicarrier again? I’m sure they’ll send Barnes right to Commando Bridge.”
are his husband. The Sokovia Accords was one thing, but faced with a simple choice, Steve would always choose you.”
Steve looked adorably put-out as he glanced at Tony in question. His lips were red and decidedly kiss-swollen and Tony almost leaned in again to mess him up a bit more.
A surprised smile tugged at Steve’s lips and he was reaching for Tony’s hand. “That’s what I meant: I’m really glad you’re my friend. I just wanted you to know that if you need someone to talk to, I’m here.”
The scent of his cologne teased Tony’s nose as their cheeks brushed, and he allowed himself a moment of pure and utter happiness. He inhaled deeply, filling his lungs with the scent he’d identified with Steve for as long as he’d known him.
It was a few hours later, probably no more than three, when Tony suddenly jolted awake on a few mumbled, panicked words. It was still dark, the wind still howling through the trees. From the few sounds leaving Tony’s lips, Steve only made out ‘don’t’ and ‘please’ and he cast Tony a worrying look once his brown eyes found his. It obviously took a moment for Tony to realize where he was and why he was sleeping out in the open.
Steve grinned, glancing back over his shoulder again, and… Christ, Tony was just too damned attractive, gaze intense, mouth turned down into a pout that made his bottom lip look extra biteable. The fact that he was now outright flirting with him, all the subtlety from before gone, wasn’t exactly helping.
“Yeah?” Tony asked. At first, his mouth ran dry and his brain sort of short-circuited. Just—
Steve’s eyes fell on Tony with guarded apology, but he offered nothing more than a shrewd shrug in consolation. To be honest, that was exactly what he was thinking.
There were retching sounds coming from both Clint and Pietro, and chuckles from Wanda, Bruce and Natasha. Steve pursed his lips and turned around slightly. “Can you give us a bit of privacy?”
He wanted Tony in his life. He wanted him at his table, laughing with him, arguing and sparring with him; he wanted everything. He wanted the added bonus of having him in his bed as well as at his side.
The tension Tony’d been harboring rolled off his body with a long trembling breath, and he finally relaxed in Steve’s arms. “There wasn’t much you could have done…” he told him quietly. “It’s just really fucking frustrating.”
Natasha opened her mouth, but Clint talked over her, “Let it rest,” he said with a clipped voice. “You don’t know anything about what she—”
“Sure is,” Sam agreed. “For the, you know, ‘enhanced people’. Not the mere humans. I won’t touch that stuff with a pole, I’ll only make fun of Steve once he does.”
He was half-joking, but was relieved anyway when Steve chuckled lightly. “Not divorcing you any time soon. No, it’s… something good, I hope. Bit of a life-changer.”
So he did.
“Ah,” Steve said, nodding eagerly. “Yes, yes, I would like that very much.”
Tony hummed, glancing at him with one of his patient smiles. “Don’t you think it’d bore you?”
That drew his attention away. “Do I—? You know that I do. I—”
Tony honestly had no damn clue what he was going to do when Steve got back, because… It was laughable, wasn’t it? Completely mad. A part of him was still sure this was a mistake, a joke,
“Ohh, he couldn’t,” Tony said, grinning at them. “He very much tried to pull me out of the way, but I was faster this time. Only a few drops got past the armor, so it was definitely better that way. Steve would’ve scratched his skin raw.”
This is it folks! Last chapter :) I will post a Bonus chapter in a week or two, but otherwise, this is it. I know a few asked if I would solve the issues Civil War created and I did, in parts, but I also didn't, because I really want to be able to eventually continue this series when MCU moves on to Infinity War.
“Steve, my God… you…”
“I did like it,” Steve said, frowning at him. “It was home.”
“I do,” Tony offered while taking another healthy bite out of his toast.
Ross smiled. “I wanted to talk to you about this in person. I’m reaching out to you.” He glanced sideways, and raised a brow. “But I’m not sure it’s appropriate for him to join us.” Though he tried for casual, his feelings for Bucky were clearly heard.
This was Tony coming after him, Steve realized.
“But you haven’t been in a while,” Steve finished.
“I heard you. Come inside.” Tony stepped aside and held the door open. “Join me for breakfast.”
He had a strange sense of déja vù—it sure as hell wasn’t the first time Bruce went all cockblocker on him, especially when it came to his prof-friends. Whatever. Not like he
The television in the living room was running. The late night news were on and Steve didn’t need to hear a lot to know what they were saying about them. ‘Mass murderers’, ‘terrorists’—and those were just the most striking words. He remembered that Captain America-graffiti in Sokovia, with the word
Steve was inches away from him, his body one hundred percent stiff. It didn’t take long to prompt his gaze; so he turned and gauged Tony’s eyes. “Yeah. I… I figured it out just now.”
Tony grinned at the awed noise she made then, and cleared his throat. “Everyone, meet Ian James Stark-Rogers.”
“No,” Tony said, rolling his eyes. Some part of him wished that he could re-lose his virginity to Steve. That Steve could be his first everything. That they could be each other’s, how it was meant to be. But then again, it didn’t really matter. Everything else had just brought them here, to this moment, so it was okay. “You’re with me now, right?”
It didn’t seem right.
“‘We’ being your sorcerers?”
Steve smiled at him—and Tony had forgotten that Steve had ever smiled at him like that. So softly. “Always.”
“Tony,” Steve prompted, stopping in his tracks and grabbing for Tony’s hand so he’d come to a halt, too.
pull the shield from his back holder.
Steve cleared his throat, looking at the red body with an uneasy feeling. “And you’re sure about this?”
, really. It seemed there was little human in those people, but it made them all the more deadly. “That’s not very impressive. Are all those years finally catching up on you?”
“Now that you did, you might as well make use of it,” she said, sliding her tongue over her dry lips. Steve smiled at her words and handed her the glass of water, watching her drink. She remembered him. Today was a good day, then.
? Heck, don’t you see? Without you, I… I would’ve never made it here. I was stuck, and you pulled me out. You gave me a
From where Steve stood, Tony didn’t seem to do much of anything, only staring at the large blueprint he’d taped to one of the walls.
A week in, Tony had a little meltdown, yelling at the room and trashing a bit of furniture. They both had realized early on that leaving the room wasn’t much of an option. They’d simply find themselves walking through a door, only to reappear on the other side of the room. Outside the windows, it was always the same scenery: New York by night, though Steve had noted that his dream-memory of the skyline wasn’t quite as accurate. A few buildings didn’t look right, but then again, it supposedly didn’t matter.
Maybe he was already letting go, cutting Steve out of his life again.
“What—”
The words hit Steve like a tidal wave. He couldn’t move. Couldn’t open his mouth to do as Tony asked and that was it—that was enough. Tony’s hands dropped from Steve’s body and a self-deprecating smile took hold of his lips. “It’s alright. You’re a good man. I would never ask you to love a murderer.”
And in a matter of seconds, he’d be gone.
He staggered upright and watched her race to the car, saying something to his target, and the next moment saw them racing across the grounds. She had a hard time getting the scientist out of his  range, though, the plump man was slowing her down, and the Potemkin Stairs offered no cover.
Of course, Steve never mentioned his dreams to anyone. The men and women he went on stage with were nice enough lads, but Steve wouldn’t know what to tell them, anyway. The dreams, strange as they were, were his. Completely his. And he wasn’t in the mood to share.
“God,” Steve gasped. “That is so much better than I thought.”
“Not likely, Elsa. There will be friendship bracelets now, and insider jokes, and couples’ nights. From here on out, you'll hear this beautiful voice every day.”
“Haven’t seen you wearing this in years,” Tony murmured. “Not since… I don’t even know. Didn’t it burn up at some point? I can’t remember.”
“The Maximoff girl really got to you, huh?” Tony asked quietly. “Darling, do you need to talk—”
They looked at each other for a minute longer, until Steve’s shoulders sagged again with the weight of solemnity. “Come on, Tony, you know what I mean. This morning, everything was so wonderful, and now you’re giving me the cold shoulder. I might not have a lot of experience with sex, but I know when I’m being turned down.” He paused to lick his lips as his eyes darkened in reminder. “I just wished you would’ve told me so…”
“Make everything about a billion times more complicated than it has to be. I just
Tony frowned and shook the thought off with little success.
“Just get inside me,” Steve said, grunting irritably when Tony moved his fingers languidly from side to side to spread him wider. “I can take it.”
During his speech, Steve had stared at him with an open mouth, barely moving. For a good whole minute, neither of them said anything. And then, because Steve was a fiercely intelligent man, he came to the right conclusion.
“Just let me…” he said, pressing his fingers against both of the suit’s sides and triggering the manual opening mechanism. It didn’t go as smoothly as it usually did, so there might be some dents after all, but after a few moments, he was moving out of the suit.
He took the glass of water Steve offered him and drank it all down in one go. He eyed Steve’s uniform with a small smile, putting the empty glass aside and stepping closer to him.
Barnes was as calm as could be expected, but still aware of his surroundings.
That got a snort from Steve. “I’m just making sure you don’t turn into a beanpole, Shellhead.”
* * *
Steve sucked in a breath and moaned Tony’s name aloud, his hips arching off the bed and right against Tony’s groin.
“I can see why people would want to be with you,” he said, forcing the words out of his lips before he could think too much about it.
“No,” Tony agreed. “No, I suppose you can’t.”
The idea alone made Steve sob. Tony’d let Steve have him; he knew he would. But it’d leave him ruined for anyone else, and all too soon he might not dream of Tony again, and where would that leave him?
“I want it,” he said softly, as he let his thumbs brush along Tony’s cheeks, close to those lips he had yet to taste.
Steve smiled. “So… effortless.”
“I wouldn’t care,” Tony said brokenly. “I fought this so hard, but now—”
Tony wondrously stared at the side of Steve’s head. He couldn’t even get a glimpse of the man’s face when he said all that, which was a shame, really. Tony felt some sort of wild giddiness bubbling in his chest, searing his nerve-endings with newfound life and inspiring his heart to erratic bursts every time he replayed Steve’s half-declaration.
Tony groaned and squinted distastefully at his body.
been his last meeting, after all, Tony thought. And this was just some kind of trap, some way to get him out of the picture before he caused any more trouble. It wasn’t how he thought the UN operated, though. Ross was a dick, but a professional one with a pretty straight moral compass.
Howard added.
“I know,” Tony said, not using Extremis for once, and Steve was glad. Because if this was it, he needed to hear his real voice. “ETA two. Please hold on.”
Taking a first—heavenly—sip from the coffee, Tony walked up behind Steve, leaning up a bit to put his chin on Steve’s shoulder.
After dinner—after the table had been cleared from the various dishes, it took about ten minutes before the first person, Clint, had announced movie night.
"Sure," he said absently as he made quick work of it. "When you're eighteen we can tell whoever you want." He helped Tony clean up and tucked the both of them back into their sleep clothes before finally settling down next to Tony's warm body, hugging him.
Steve pinched his nose, but intoned anyway, “Don’t step in front of Clint if he’s doing something stupid.”
“I’m sorry, sir. I’m afraid I can’t find Mister Hogan anywhere.”
Steve was so wretchedly confused with himself he could barely move. Yet somehow, he managed to drag himself to the shower. His first shower after
Maybe after the gala, they could find some time for themselves, and then Tony would break the news to Steve, and hope they could find a solution together.
, but Tony had really missed kissing Steve.
Tony was very close. Steve couldn't recall a time they were this close before. It wasn't… bad, but it was making it a little difficult to concentrate on the conversation. He knew that Tony was joking at his expense to some extent, but somehow it didn't sting as much as his previous jabs had. The hand on his knee was warm, and Steve had to force himself to ignore it for the sake of answering. God, he hasn't been this close to anyone since the war.
Guh. It was beyond difficult to find words. He’d been sure they’d return to him once the shaking had settled into a post-coital hum. They didn’t. It seemed sex with Steve had rendered his mind goo along with the rest of him.
Tony closed his eyes and sighed. “Trust me, you don’t want to know the details.”
Tony pursed his lips. “Great. Look out for my husband, would you?”
Fucking coward.
to look into it after you tell me what SHIELD built on
“Sure is,” Tony confirmed. “I’m his grad student, Tony.” He offered the guy his hand, shaking it once but not letting go right away. It was very warm and the guy had a good, strong grip, so Tony couldn’t help himself and let his thumb trail over the skin for a second longer.
Steve didn’t go into Barnes’ room. Not anymore. He’d tried a few times, in the beginning—had tried to talk to him, but Barnes hadn’t reacted well to his visits, either ignoring him completely, or showing severe signs of anxiety until Steve would eventually leave and let Bruce deal with the aftermath.
“If I stop, they’ll take you away from here. Put you in a cell until your dying day. Or worse.”
* * *
“He’s a travesty,” Tony murmured. He met Steve’s eyes again. “I can show him to you if you want,” he explained gently. “But he’s a strange fellow. For one, don’t ever drink what he wants to offer you. No matter how good it looks. Alright?”
A smile at that, and a hum in agreement. “Part of it, yeah.” He closed his eyes, revelling in Steve holding him near and pressing soft kisses into his skin. He loved this, having his lungs filled with Steve’s essence, and his warmth against his body.
Steve felt heat rising to his cheeks. “I, uh, that… that would’ve been yesterday, I guess. I’m, well, I’m bi.” Every time he said it now, it did roll off his tongue a little easier.
“Edwin Jarvis. My butler. And my oldest friend.”
“Yes. I’m sure.”
“Oh God, my head. Oh
And the wings… the wings were still right
Tony felt a lump in his throat and he swallowed, his tone turning more serious when he said, “I mean it. You keep me sorted out, these days.”
Which meant…
The bot was a giant failure. And he wasn’t the only one.
Then, without ceremony, Tony sat up a bit, settling on top of Steve, bringing their middles together. He lined them up, and after spitting into his hand, wrapped it around both of their erections. Sparks detonated across Steve’s skin, as an inhuman moan ripped through his throat. His body was aflame, his blood bubbling with elation so pure it had to be illegal.
He opened both eyes and grimly noticed the unslept-in side of the bed. Steve hadn’t made it upstairs for two full weeks now. Tony rolled around, though kept his fist coiled in a steadfast grip for long seconds. Every inch of willpower tingled on its last nerve; he was so fucking sick of waking up alone.
Before Tony could change his opinion, Steve had already slipped an oiled finger into his body and rubbed his insides with gentle, steady movements. Tony was very tight around him, clearly not used to the intrusion. With soft words and calm instructions, however, Tony was able to calm down a little, unclench, and take what Steve had to offer. With tender swipes of his tongue, and a few pointed thrust of his fingers, he soon enough had Tony’s hips eagerly buck against him. And throughout it all, Steve held him to the earth, keeping him grounded.
Tony’s tongue slipped between Steve’s lips, and with a long whimper, all of the fight left Steve’s body. There really was no taste in the world that could rival Tony’s. He was pressed intimately against Steve, his erection rubbing against Steve’s pajama-pants, inciting small, involuntary whimpers from his mouth. Steve’s skin was hot all over. His blood rushed with excitement.
He closed his hand around the base, before fondling Steve’s balls. Well, maybe some other time.
What would happen now? He couldn’t possibly kill Bucky.
The steps creaked beneath Tony’s shoes, softly but loudly enough to announce his arrival.
you.”
And then Tony withdrew his hand and pulled away, and Steve felt a tug in his chest, like something was wrong. This wasn't how it went, but...
Tony huffed, but there was a small smile playing with his lips. “True.”
“If it comes down to it, if you find a way to give this a second try, let me be there with you.” Steve met his eyes steadily. “In case you need backup.”
Sam squared his back. “I’d say so, yes. Flying is what I miss most.”
“Do you have to tell Mister Stark today?” Jarvis asked. “It’s going to bring it all back again, and worse than before.”
“Yeah, well, you know how it is. Can’t watch kitten videos on YouTube all the time,” Tony joked then heaved his old man’s body up. For some reason, he suddenly worried that this was yet another pop culture reference Steve wouldn’t get, but his mouth had quirked upwards so Tony figured it was okay.
[New Client2] [chat_server:46956]
Tony’s hands fell back to Steve’s hips. He thrust downward, squeezing Steve with all he had, even as his hands trailed under Steve’s uniform top, pinching both nipples.
Steve snorted. “Not about us. Or, well, kind of, but not—I told him about me. About, you know.”
Tony looked over his shoulders, raising a brow. Steve already wore his full Captain America gear, sans the helmet and shield. “We ready to leave?”
Steve nodded, his thoughts trailing off. The words almost tumbled off his lips on their own account. “You know, when Bucky died, I…” He sighed, rubbing his forehead. “I had this moment, when I thought that I might as well quit. That I’d rather let the world go to Hell, because what did it matter if my brother wasn’t in it anymore.”
Rhodey sighed, waving a hand in front of Tony’s face. “Earth to Tony Stark.”
“This is nice,” Tony said after a moment of quiet, trailing one hand down to Steve’s hip to pull them flush against one another.
there were voices in front of the barn, followed by Barnes’ shouting: “Steve! Get your pants back on, for God’s sake. We gotta go!”
Steve nodded. Natasha was right, of course. In two weeks, freshman orientation would begin and that meant that, if Steve wanted to get his friend back, he needed to make every second count.
That was his
he hadn’t expected. And clearly, Steve hadn’t either. Tony screwed his eyes shut, trying to come up with a way to handle this.
“That’s more than enough,” Tony said, leaning in to kiss him gently.
,” he snapped, his eyes a tad hazy.
“I’m sorry about the tower, by the way,” Steve added.
He breathed in the scent of Tony's hair and the tangy musk of their love making. His ass felt fine, as he'd expected, which… was a shame. One of the rare opportunities where superhuman healing would get in the way instead of being a massive improvement in his life.
Steve grimaced, though he tried to hide it. Tony did have a point there, he hadn’t exactly put up much of a fight. “I was sure you were glad to be rid of me,” he explained quietly. “I was still surprised how well we… how good it was. Us, together, I mean. That you were willing to stick around, work together, after everything. And when we came back, I guess I just thought that… that I had no right to force you into spending time with me if you didn’t want to. It was very clear that you were avoiding me… and I wanted to respect that.”
"Don't
What had Bruce once said about timelines and multiverses? Before you knew what was what—whether you’ve traveled to another dimension or another time—, you had to be very careful not to mess anything up. But Steve… he’d, well… either way, he’d gone forward, not back, right? So nothing he could say would really cause any problems. At least, he hoped so. Besides, he would need help getting back. He didn’t have a clue about interdimensional travel.
Adding more lube, now onto his condom-clad dick, Steve sat up, adjusted their position and pulled Tony onto his lap. He angled their bodies just right and started pressing in, eyes flicking between Tony's face and where their bodies slowly connected.
God, he needed Tony to come home right now. He needed to talk to him about this—about those things Stane had said, which collided nicely with the ghosts already following Steve around. But more importantly: He wanted Tony to be
Steve’s eyes flickered to something in the back of the barn, and when he walked to the tractor, Tony didn’t understand what he was doing at first. But then he stepped up to him again, twirling the little red screwdriver in his hand. “That’s mine,” he announced, and pocketed it right after.
“Oh,” Bucky’s eyes widened even further, then narrowed.
your business. I can work like this just fine, got enough proof of that by now, thank you very much.”
He fell quiet for a moment, letting all of that sink in and
At that, Clint turned around from his spot in the driver’s seat and gave them an exaggerated pointed bow. “That’d be me,” he said with a grin.
“What does, brother?”
And it would be true, wouldn't it? If they were really going to go for this thing that was building between them, they needed to have each other's backs and they needed to be able to talk things out if they wanted to make it work.
Steve’s smile grew. “Thank you for tonight. I know you didn’t really care that much about the ceremony.”
The question remained whether Steve had the courage to actually go through with this. He had always been a bit of a coward when relationships were concerned, and Tony…
“That line is getting old,” Tony retorted bitterly. He stared up at the ceiling of his bedroom. “Was it the way to go when you decided to rip everything we had apart? To look at the one chance that could’ve kept the team together, and decide to damn it all to hell? That the way you’re talking about?”
Steve kissed the corner of Tony’s mouth while one of his hands moved down from Tony’s chest to his navel to his hipbones. Then, he dug his fingers into the flesh of his ass.
Things were decidedly not okay between them. And a part of him—a rather large part—still hated Steve a little bit for what had happened. For not talking to him about his parents, for not believing in him enough to work together.
Tony sighed as he watched Steve step into the elevator. He leaned against its door for a moment and waved a hand. “Bruce and I will start working on one of the bulbs it threw on the street, so… when you’re done, meet me down at my workshop.”
. But,” he took a deep breath, counting to three, calming himself. “
“I just need to go to the bathroom real quick,” he said, pointedly
“Steve—”
He grabbed hold of his rifle and pulled himself up the slope. He took a good ten seconds to aim, waiting until the car reached the right height, before he pulled the trigger. The shot echoed along the Potemkin Stairs, and then the bullet burst through the car’s tires. The car veered off course immediately, and skidded sideways, falling off the embankment.
“I think I blew one of the jocks,” he murmured and wiped at his mouth again. “I told you not to leave me alone today. Where were you, anyway? I thought Carol said she wouldn’t come.”
“So you’re saying there’s no other charmingly handsome man waiting for me? That’s a bit of a bummer.”
“Sure. Why wouldn’t it be?”
Steve stared at the letter for a long moment, sorting out his thoughts. He'd never gotten a goodbye letter before, and the sense of finality to it was both terrible and unbelievable.
Natasha snickered and patted Steve’s knee. “You binged about twenty episodes.”
“Yeah, that… looks like it,” Steve agreed, walking up to them warily. “Pain relief?” he asked and cast Bruce a questioning glance. There was a bottle of oil on the couch table that Steve recognized from the many times Bruce had rubbed the fluid against his temples after a Hulk-Out. Next to that, there was a gigantic bottle of Advil.
Oh great. That was just—
When he finally managed to raise his eyes and look at Steve, he felt his body go rigid.
“—not the do-gooder he wants us to believe he is,” Tony finished. “Yeah, well, we figured. Aside yourself or the agents down in records, I don’t believe anyone knows
Bracing himself, he walked into the room, greeting the first guests on his way. Tonight was about getting his mind off of things, and spending some time with his team.
Infiltrating SHIELD at this point was basically a suicide mission. Missions of that magnitude took weeks of planning on a normal day, and that was
[J.A.R.V.I.S.] [chat_server:46954]
When Tony sat up, Steve turned to look at him. "I shouldn't be wanting this," he told him slowly, surprised at his own words. Some part of him
A small smile tickled the Rhodey’s lips. “‘Pleasant’? That must’ve hurt.”
“Iron Man—Cap,” came a voice through the comm-line, mercifully stopping Steve from saying
True, the Avengers had overcome many obstacles together, but the big endgame was still out there. All those unknown forces, all those powers. It didn’t have to happen tomorrow, or any time soon, but it would be naïve to think that just because they’d defeated an alien army, a couple of psychotic scientists and hobby villains, they’d be able to take on everything else. That there wouldn’t be
Was he remembering the many balls he’d hosted with Indries at his side?
Dammit, he really wanted to brush her hair out of her face, wanted to cup her cheek, showing her that it was alright to open up right now, but his goddamn arm was gone.
“You know,” Bucky said, suddenly feeling bold, “things were a lot easier when all I had to do was kill you.”
“I can still stop him,” someone said behind them. They all turned around, and Tony stared at the blue woman with the robotic features.
Her memory was the only thing that kept him awake. All he had to do was close his eyes and he wasn’t alone.
”—”Are you alright?”—”Is everything okay?”—”Are you hurt?”
“Shhh… I know.” Tony leaned back to pull out a little bottle from his pants’ pockets, and coated his palm with the fluid, before returning his slick hand to Steve’s dick. Steve grasped Tony’s hips and held at the new sensation, thrusting forward ever so-slightly.
Just like Natasha.
It took a moment for Steve to replay the last bit of the conversation, then he rolled his eyes. “I told you it’s not the same, You really don’t know when to let it go, do you?”
He noticed how Steve kept glancing back to the suit, and smiled to himself. One of the legs was still missing and the chest plate wasn’t snapped into place yet, but otherwise, Mark forty-three was mostly finished. And he knew it looked impressive. It was, by far, the most powerful thing he’d come up with, and the first with a built-in arc reactor, just in case.
“We thought that… that you might know what happened.”
Still, Tony thought belatedly, did it really matter? In about two weeks, Steve would be on the far west coast, playing football for Stanford. Maybe all of this didn’t matter, anyway.
"Alright," he said, leaning over closer. "Can you put the condom on me?" It was an open invitation, really. Steve would do it himself if the situation called for it.
“Just about,” Steve agreed, smiling tiredly. “I’m sorry we’re making you guys uneasy.”
“I fix things,” Tony explained with a pensive expression. “It’s what I do.”
Letting himself enjoy the physical contact that Steve would probably never allow if he were sober, Tony pushed his nose against his shirt, breathing in. “Smell good…” he muttered, digging his fingers into the cloth as he felt himself drifting off.
Tony smiled, resting his forehead against Steve's. He kissed him, slow and languid, and while he pushed his tongue in, he pulled out of Steve in one smooth motion before shoving back in. And Christ, Steve's walls clenched and squeezed around him, strangling him so good that Tony was having a hard time concentrating on the kiss.
Tony quietly inched over a little bit so he could turn his head and study Steve’s face. He was still asleep; his deep, even breathing causing his chest to rise and fall steadily. His tousled blond hair had fallen across his eyes, but otherwise, he looked peaceful… at rest. The moonlight played across the planes of Steve’s face and Tony couldn’t resist tracing a finger across his cheekbones, following its path.
“Don’t need you to last,” Steve said. “We can make the next one last.”
Bucky scowled at him. “Says the guy who passed out while holding hands with Esther Ralston behind the church.”
After only a few steps, Tony called his name. Steve stopped, looking back over his shoulder.
By all means, this mission shouldn’t be too hard. Or so Tony told himself.
“Good,” he said shortly, turning around and shooting towards the sky again. “You can start with the hundred over there.”
Next to Steve, the elevator’s doors had opened, and Steve was able to pull Tony in before he could participate in the argument, so that clearly counted as a win.
Now, there was only Rumlow and Steve, and a vial he couldn’t let him leave with.
Bucky tackled Steve down to the ground, pinning his legs down, letting the metal hand rush down on Steve’s face, hitting him once as hard as he possibly could.
Tony met Steve’s eyes, his skin burning. It wasn’t the first time he was looking at a man from this position, but with Steve it was… vastly different. Watching him as he watched Tony, his eyes clouded with passion and love and a thousand other feelings at once, and Tony felt himself falling deeper into an abyss from which he never wanted to be freed again.
“Not all that good, apparently,” Tony countered, and it was always like this with him. He was bold and flashy and his words were meant to show that he didn’t care either way, but beneath all that, he was the most vulnerable person Steve had ever come across.
“Probably wouldn’t—wouldn’t stop you, if—Oh God…” His breath hitched when Steve rubbed him more firmly, and he let himself fall against Steve’s chest, barely managing to stay on his feet. “You’re not playing fair,” he accused him with a smile, closing his eyes as he felt fingers fumbling with his belt.
“It was my only chance to get through to him,” Steve told him. “I knew he was still in there. I saw it in his eyes, Tony, I couldn’t just leave him there…”
The date was June 11th.
“Anyway,” Rhodey said, “I liked Steve when I met him, but you wanna know when I realized he’d be really good for you?”
“But you
“About how you’d think. But I learned my lesson.”
He tended to Barnes’ hand methodically. They all had some basic medical knowledge by now, and while Tony’s was probably the worst, he was still able to clean and disinfect some cuts and scrapes.
“Seven secure.”
because of Steve, at least. “This was… bigger. Was a matter of priorities. And what is this, anyway? Are you giving me advice on my marriage now?”
“I don’t believe you,” Steve whispered.
“Soon,” he shot back, wiggling his brows in mock-question. “Only you would call this ‘soon’...” He huffed, moving one hand off of Steve’s thigh, moving it towards his groin and rubbing the bulge there. “You can think all you want but I kinda got lube and condoms covered the day after you and Barnes stormed my lab.” He grinned mischievously, pointing towards where he hoped his messenger bag was still leaning against the nightstand. “Front pocket.”
Tony nodded, though he did nothing to wipe the omnipresent smile from his face when Steve pulled off of him. The fact that everyone was pretty much okay with what was happening between them and that—outside the expected leers, stares, and almost-commentary—no one had said anything negative, struck Tony as an utter miracle. The least he’d expected was for Barnes to punch him once and be done with it. His not-quite-approval might be very palpable but also pretty much resigned.
* * *
Steve smiled. “It wasn’t a spur of the moment decision to get you in the sack, if that’s what you want to know.”
For long moments, he panted in recovery, trying to somehow get his bearings before he looked up again. What a picture they must make, both still dressed with their pants barely shoved down over their asses. The thought made him laugh, and when he leaned back a little, he glanced down at Steve with mirth.
“A farm,” Tony commented, once they’d walked past the few trees, the landscape giving way for a huge house a few dozen yards away. “You live in a farm. Barn, tractor, little vegetable garden, the whole nine yards.”
he wanted to say.
Tony had held control over Ultron the whole time. But at what price?
With a heavy heart, Steve stood up and turned around, finally taking in his surroundings. The whole team was there—each and every one of them: Wanda, and Vision, and Peter, and Scott, and even T’Challa. It was both a bit much and strangely heartwarming, that they’d all been working together to get them back.
Steve blinked, pulled back. “What?”
Damn it all, he really should’ve told Steve as soon as he’d gotten notice of the Accords. It hadn’t been fair to keep this from him for so much as an hour, and yet… He guessed he’d been too afraid to take this step, because…
The excitement Tony felt rise within him almost uncontainable, now. He could fear his own heart beating against his chest. The sun was now almost eighty percent eclipsed. It was then that the dark cumulus clouds appeared from nowhere and veiled the sun.
“Ba-ba,” came a joyful sound from the small room nearby. A pause, followed by a few gurgles, then: “Ba-ba-ba-ba.”

Tony didn’t wait a second longer. Extremis’ doors opened, and where there had once been a low tingle at the edges of his mind, he now met Ultron full-force. His presence was raw and vicious as it whipped through the cracks in Tony’s mind, and he fought to suppress uneasy shivers.
—fuck it all.
, Tony said on the comm-line.
Tony snorted. Sam would fit into the team just fine. “I’m good here. Thanks.” With that, he cast Sam a grateful smile. “Don’t know if you’re interested in this becoming a long-term thing, but there’s plenty of space in the tower and you’re welcome whenever.”
“Splendid,” Tony said with a bitter undertone. When he had dressed down to a shirt and his boxers, and lay down on the bed, Steve noticed the dark circles around his eyes, and the paleness of his skin.
“Shouldn’t let this become a habit,” Steve murmured as he looked at the unconscious form, then he started to run. As he headed towards their car, however, Steve spotted spotlights and dozens
Steve’s eyes were glimmering with amusement and Tony really thought he should be concerned about Steve’s lack of discomfort, but for some reason—he wasn’t.
Ignoring Steve, Tony looked up at Wanda. “You saw it. What will happen. We all need to stick together. This is more important than me. You—”
* * 6/13/22, 2:58 PM * *
Steve, after everything that had happened? Why should he suddenly want to call the guy?
There wasn’t an inch of him that didn’t tremble with awe. “Perfect,” he mumbled, completely sated and feeling full in so many wonderful ways.
They were standing side by side next to a table in front of the RV, and chopped vegetables. It felt like a lifetime ago, them sharing a beer, talking about everything and nothing. Just them and this blissful togetherness… and without all this baggage they had now.
A sense of despair pushed through him, but it was too late. Electricity burst through his limbs. Pain rained down on his face, filling his eyes, nose and mouth. Choking a bit, he screamed. He
“I know, I designed the thing.”
“We will get it back,” Steve said. He thought of Ian, and of Tony, and he knew it was the only option. “I promise.”
“Oh, I think you heard me, hot stuff,” was the only thing the man said, and it had Steve huff an annoyed breath.
Steve only raised a brow.
“Steve!” Tony called. “There you are. I was just about to send Jarvis up there to drag you down. Come here.”
Steve nodded in agreement. “Will do. Just wanna see if he needs any help with the set-up.”
“And what then?” Tony snapped suddenly. “It doesn’t work that way! There’s… there’s history books about you. Everyone knows what happened to the great Captain America! Do you really think my meddling would change anything?”
about that.
Steve agreed.
"Tony," he said, and it sounded like a question and like judgment and pity all wrapped in one, even Steve could hear it in his voice. "What happened to you?"
“Why are we here?” Tony asked, as if reading Steve’s thoughts. He had looked up at last, his hand falling from his face, even though he still didn’t look at Steve—or anyone, for that matter. He only stared at the space around him, some sort of shadow falling over his eyes.
A part of Steve wasn’t sure anymore if the last two months had even transpired the way he remembered they had. If he and Tony had really been as close as it had felt to Steve—or if he’d maybe read the situation completely wrong. He certainly still remembered holding Tony close during the storms, or swimming with him in the river. He remembered Tony telling him about how he’d become Iron Man, and he remembered soft smiles and even softer looks.
Tony smiled timidly. “I don’t know how anyone could

aren’t. And you won’t even make it into the Quinjet if I don’t let you. This is still 2018 and your codes don’t work here. And I won’t change that.”
“That works,” he agreed, hands clutching at Steve’s back. “I’m sorry I messed everything up.”
“Of course it is,” he insisted. “He’s eight weeks old today, aren’t you, precious?”
The others, however, walked right up to them. Slowly, one after the other, their gazes settled on Tony.
“I want you to watch over my work, make sure it’s in the right hands. You’ll have Pepper and Rhodey, but I want
“Late growth spurt, maybe,” Steve’d said.
Natasha’s expression was suddenly far away. “You of all people should know best what he’s going through,” she said softly.
“We were,” Steve answered, trying not to grin. “And now we’re back.”
“Tony… I….” Steve started, his fading blue eyes wide as he stared at him. “I’m s… s….”
“Of course,” Steve had said softly.
Steve’s brows perked, obligatorily slowing down the RV as the wheels hit gravel. “I didn’t think there were so many visitors.” He sounded terribly disappointed.

, I think.” It was hard to keep track of time, sometimes.
“See,” Natasha whispered next to Bucky, smiling. “Told you it’s all fine.”
Sitting down, Steve watched with wide eyes as Tony slowly undressed himself. He could barely see him in the dimness of the room, but just the thought—just the thought of his nakedness was enough, and he felt his erection slowly returning.
A second later, though, Ultron jumped on top of the truck and approached Steve with an upraised hand and calculating red eyes. “You know what’s in that cradle?” he asked without preliminaries, his voice vicious, as he fired a repulsor blast at him. “The power to make real change. And that
something—needed to move around.
“About seventy years.”
Steve froze completely. Only after a long moment of silence, he found his voice again. “Come
By the end of it, Steve’s fingers were pumping hard inside Tony; his lips were teasing his ears, his neck, his mouth. And just when he thought he was going to bring him over the edge just with this, Tony quickly removed his fingers and replaced it with his cock.
” Tony echoed. “What happened to your optimism?”
And at that moment, he wished he could’ve said the same thing to
He leaned back down to catch Tony’s mouth into another toe-curling kiss.
Tony took a deep breath. “It’s slow, okay? Everything is really slow. I’m getting annoyed by my own AI, switching between tabs is literal hell, and don’t even get me started on using a fucking internet browser. It’s… it’s a work in progress, getting used to the slowness, and please don’t say you feel sorry for me because I
Suddenly, Steve felt a loss so strong rush through his insides that he had to keep himself upright with a steadying hand against the door. His mind was torn—split with the agony of loving Tony and how much loving him had cost him so far.
Sam stayed with Tony for the time being, letting him have a last look at his wings, before teaming up with the others later. His main job was to distract the Helicarriers’ Phalanx guns on deck and, well… not get killed in the process.
The meaning behind those words was painfully clear. It wasn’t a ‘when’ Steve was asking, it was an ‘if’. And the question whether or not Steve was welcome was…
“Maria sent a message. Someone called off the government squad for now.” Tony smiled grimly. “Looks like you’ve got friends in places we all didn’t know about.”
“Yes, and I have to deal with it, too, don’t I?” Tony said, and only when Natasha cast him an unimpressed glance, he groaned and nodded. “Fine, I’ll talk to him.”
“Apparently I can’t walk away from this,” Tony breathed. He yanked Steve’s shirt up a bit, until his naked chest was momentarily exposed to his hungry, conflicted eyes. “And we can’t…” he continued, fingers tracing a trail up his abdomen. “We can’t just pretend like this isn’t happening.”
talked about so far and… he immediately felt like walking on a very thin layer of ice. “Yes,” he said, his voice subdued.
Preparing dinner didn’t take much. Steve, predictably, did the bulk of the work, while calling out orders here and there.
Tony’s eyes were piercing as he studied him, and whatever he saw there, it set him in motion. “Come,” he said simply, and reached for one of Steve’s hands. He didn’t pull, only tugged gently, with Ian still cradled against his side, and Steve followed them down the corridors.
Steve killed a grin. Tony was too damn cute for his own good.
“Uh, thanks,” Tony said as he took his shirt and slipped into it. Then, he accepted his jacket from Steve, pulling it on, too.
Tony put one hand on Steve’s hip and slowed him down, showing him how to move so that it was like dancing, their bodies rubbing against each other in a perfect, soundless rhythm.
For a moment he thought about ignoring the plea, hoping that what had happened was only a dream—but he knew that reality wouldn’t bend to his wishes. Extremis was gone. Just as JARVIS was. He felt it with every inch of his body, like a limb had been cut off.
Steve pouted adorably.
She merely smiled brightly. “Hi, daddy.”
As Tony made his way through the hallway leading to Barnes’ room, he came across Steve and Natasha. Every waking hour, they were seated side by side in the hallway of the infirmary. They didn’t talk, as far as Tony knew. There was still this icy distance between them, and above that—whenever Tony walked past them, the air was thick with anticipation. They were expecting him to finally offer the solution to everything on a silver plate, as if he was the only one who could do so. It left him both pleased and scared shitless of failure. If Bucky Barnes died at their hands, the consequences could be inexorable.
“It means
“We’ll buy you a new one,” Steve declared. His face was beet red, but he betrayed absolutely no shame. Or maybe he just stoically endured his predicament. Both options were equally awesome. “Please leave now.”
to him, that he wanted to actually
Sleep hadn’t cleared Tony’s muddled thoughts. Wrapping his mind around Steve and this goddamn kiss seemed impossible. Seemed something more like a distant, bizarre dream than anything that could have truly transpired. How it was that Tony found himself here in this situation … and yet, it had happened.
by Steve’s decision. If he wanted him to stay, he could’ve said so, couldn’t he? He obviously hadn’t wanted Steve around, he was glad not to see him every day anymore.
Steve’s mouth twitched even as Tony rolled his eyes. “Hello,” he said and returned her surprisingly firm handshake.
Steve snorted, then—on the next beat—his expression fell. “We’d never have to leave this place…”
Tony felt a mixture of surprise and betrayal. The first because Steve-”There’s only one God, Ma’am”-Rogers was apparently sitting through the entire movie, and the second because they were watching Monty Python without him in the first place.
Secretly, Steve had to agree with Natasha. After all, he had seen how good it could be between them. To throw all that away, all that love and caring and passion and tenderness, which was what he had always wanted but never received. To turn his back on that…
Bucky groaned in annoyance, then visibly reined himself in. “What are you still doing here?”
Tony stared at him for a moment. “You think so?”
“I don’t need—”
“Don’t make jokes about this,” Steve said quietly. “Please.”
Sometimes, one would even dare to say something about his dead wife,

“It was.”
talk to him. About Stane. About Indries. Together, they could surely figure out a way to deal with this mess. If only Tony would listen.
He closed the browser without looking at a single one of them.
Ross nodded, and turned the television off. He walked closer towards the table, putting the remote control down with a clicking sound.
more precisely.
“Let me try,” Tony said out loud, feeling the determination inside him rise.
“And you called yourself reckless and impulsive. How is this any different from what happened on the bridge? When I said to keep trying I meant to come up with a plan, to actually think it through, have a strategy at hand, and not to dive into the next catastrophe head first.” He sighed. “When have we switched places? When did I become the reasonable part in this relationship?”
Steve’s smile widened and was rewarded with a squeeze of Tony’s hand on his shoulder. With a soft push, Tony directed him towards the balcony, then closed the doors behind them.
And with any luck, they could soon go back to their not-quite-normal lives, and finally do what they’d planned to do for far too long.
Rhodes was casting Steve angry glances as he tried to discuss last details with Tony. Tony only nodded to everything his friend said, and didn’t seem much interested in the upcoming event.
“But I want you to know,” Steve went on, “that meeting you, meeting the Avengers… it changed my life for the better. Until I fought with you by my side, I never knew how it felt to have someone understand. Ultron told me I can’t live without a war, and he might’ve been right about that. This, the team,
Tony shrugged. “It’s alright. I’m sure you had to deal with your own demons after the Sokovia Accords.” He glanced at Steve, smiling a little. “I keep forgetting what it was like in 2018, but… you and your Tony… you haven’t seen each other in a long while, hm?”
Tony blinked. “What, because of me?”
A pang of guilt rushed through him as Steve remembered the punches and kicks he’d dished out on the kid—and he was really only that, a kid.
Somehow, he’d expected Tony to show him around, to have his steady presence as he explained everything about their new home. But no matter where Steve had looked, Tony was nowhere to be found. Only now, hours later, he spotted him sitting in the dining room, and it somehow felt as though they’d been parted for years.
Immediately, images of Tony’s lips tightly closed around his cock rose to the surface and—
“Steve,” Tony whispered, slipping a hand between them, his fingers dancing in light movements across his stomach, until he reached the waistband of Steve’s pants. “Damn it, I want you so much. Every second of every day. You’re all I think about.”
Stephen Strange and Rhodey stared helplessly at him and Tony hoped he was wearing a glowering, determined expression that would make it very clear that neither hell nor high water—and certainly no magical entity, human or sorcerer or otherwise—was going to convince him to do this.
It was so ordinary, so relaxing, so—
—ignoring the little twitches of his hands, and the way his lips were forming a thin line whenever Steve said something—it was absolutely exhausting.
TS 3:53 P.M.>Awesome. Meet at 7 tn8? Made reservations@Marea
They were two weeks into the whole ‘dating’ thing, and aside for some serious first base action, they hadn’t done
Tony expelled a low chuckle, tried to sit up, and fell flat on his back the next second. “Nope. Bring me something? If the others ask, just tell them I couldn’t get my legs to work.”
“Okay. Just… Tony? The agency—I don’t wanna pressure you, but…” He could hear the hint of warning through the phone. “Usually, most agents would double over to support Iron Man and Captain America, but the superhero thing is actually a no-go for some. And… showing them that you can’t even make your appointments most of the time isn’t exactly giving the impression of reliability.”
“It’s linked to the campus’ power grid, that’s enough to power ten of him, easy.” Tony slumped back in his chair, feeling the exhaustion in his limbs. He really shouldn’t quit now, Obi was about to show up here any day, and if DUM-E wasn’t working…
Jarvis’ smile turned into something a little cheeky and something that looked, for just a second, a whole lot similar to Tony’s smirks. “I’m glad you brought Master Anthony back home, I was beginning to think we’d never see him again.”
“You’re the devil,” Steve said quietly.
There was a pregnant pause.
,” Obi echoed, and he didn’t exactly yank his hand out of Steve’s grasp, but it was a close thing. “Really, are we doing this?” he asked on a sigh, looking at Tony with an expression that was an interesting mix of disbelief, exasperation, and annoyance.
“I mean I knew something was off, but…” Steve frowned. “What happened with our Tony? If you’re here, he—”
Steve nodded. The name certainly fit him. “I’m Steve. Nice to meet you.”
Gritting his teeth, Tony pushed forward. He found the core of Ultron’s system, and logged into it. His hands were wound around Ultron’s throat as he looked down into the flickering red eyes, and it was in that moment when his grand plan became perfectly clear.
This was home, he thought to himself, thanking whoever had been kind enough to help a poor and sickly guy from Brooklyn to even make it this far.
Now, Steve had braced himself for about everything, so he managed not to gasp in shock when Tony glanced up at him with the usual black Extremis-eyes. He did, however, flinch when he noticed the dry lines of blood all over his face, and the new tickles oozing out of the eye-corners.
, in some way. He’d heard the warning loud and clear, had understood that Tony thought himself to be so broken and undeserving that he’d wanted Steve to keep the professional distance between them. However, Steve had cast all that aside, kissing Tony instead, pouring all of his repressed feelings into that kiss, wanting Tony to know that, however dark his past might had been, their future could still be something good.
Tony remained quiet, then whispered, “You’re right.”
“Then, let

, he said over the comm, then hurled Steve down on the HYDRA group, effectively throwing a few of them to the ground before he even had the time to raise his shield.
It was so strange—this was still the same man he’d kissed only minutes ago. The same man who’d so easily declared his love for Steve. And yet… this was a version of Tony who, as far as Steve knew, still couldn’t stand to be around him for longer than was absolutely necessary.
“Look at this,” Ultron said, almost cooing now. “Still trusting Stark, even when he never once trusted you. You’re terribly naïve. But we’ll see how you like him when all he can do is drool on the floor.”
There was a minute’s consideration. Fury winced as he stood up, effectively torn. The look on his face was a mixture of worry and fret, and he looked completely out of sync with whatever it was he was trying to grasp. “Pierce might be—”
“Oh, I am sure the Captain will take care of that,” Vision supplied, casting Wanda a reassuring smile. Tony couldn’t for the life of him tell if he was acting like this because he thought Wanda needed the close interaction, or if he was actually flirting with her.
Sure enough, Steve nodded, the motion tense, and Tony heaved a breath before answering. “No, we didn’t,” he said. “You were drunk, I’m not an asshole…”
Rolling his eyes, Tony leaned forward, spitting the remaining toothpaste into the sink, rinsing his mouth with water. Only then, he glanced back up at Steve. “Since you love me and all, chances are pretty slim that you’ll leave me for someone younger, huh?”
Tony thought.
Steve shouldn't pursue anything with him. He knew he wasn't seeing Tony as a full adult—not all the time. It would be unhealthy for both of them. Steve could feel the drive to be a nurturing force in the kid's life; to be the person who made sure he was eating properly and had someone to turn to he could trust no matter what. That couldn't be good ground for a romantic pursuit. Besides, the kid already
Weirdly enough, Thor hadn’t even protested. They’d talked about the Mind Stone in Loki’s scepter and Thor had agreed that they needed to keep it safe as much as possible. And Vision was their best option to do just that.
After that, Steve seemingly couldn’t stop touching him. And Tony fully understood. It’d been too long since Steve’s skin had been under his hands. And before he could blink, his shirt had vanished and Steve was tugging at his pants.
When Bucky woke, he was being hurled to the side with strong arms restraining him. It was Steve—he knew immediately that it was Steve, and at first, he had no idea where he was or why he wasn’t sleeping while curled around Natasha’s body.
The others were already fast asleep, and Steve—Steve was going to break something, soon.
Tony reached forward as if in trance, the tips of his fingers running over a few light scars, tracing Steve’s ridiculous abs, flicking his nipples just to gauge a reaction.
She pressed her brow to his. It was so strange. He remembered wanting to kill Steve so clearly. He had bruised his body with his fists. He had done nothing to deserve all of their kindness. Sometimes he wondered why they even bothered.
The sun was barely breaking the horizon when the Quinjet circled over the small forest, searching for a landing spot. Tony refused to look at any of the others, especially avoiding Steve’s eyes, as he opened the rear hatch and stepped out onto moist grass.
“Maybe I spent too much time thinking there was no one in my life who’d want kids with me. Guess the thought stuck. Hard to teach an old dog new tricks…”
Thanks for sticking with me for the third installment. I hope you'll enjoy this part, it's probably the most explicit thing I've ever written *hides* x.x Thanks to the lovely
Bucky looked back and forth between Steve and Natasha. “What?”
Months could as well have been years.
Steve looked down at the USB-stick in his hand with some trepidation. He didn’t know what kind of SHIELD Intel was on it, but the fact that Fury had tried to leave him in the dark about it, and only trusted his best spy to do the job, was a telling sign if he’d ever seen one.
“Янепаниковал.”
Steve deflected the first with his shield, and barely dodged the second. The third hit his waist, leaving a severe burn mark, and on the fourth, Steve had already reached him, pressing his shield down on Tony’s throat so hard the metal of his helmet cut into his skin.
Steve hummed in agreement. He couldn’t even visualize it anymore. That a time existed when they both tried with all their might to hurt each other. Softly, he kissed the corner of Tony’s mouth while Tony sighed with contentment against Steve’s cheek.
Another crack of thunder pounded the earth and set the heavens ablaze.
Steve stirred soon after. He rubbed his eyes, a sleepy and confused look crossing his face when he caught Tony watching him. “Good morning.”
“Come on, you can go faster.”
‘A lot’ didn’t even begin to cover it. What a sight they must make: A red-caped God, a man-robot, another man wearing nothing but purple stretch pants, and three people fully covered in ashes and grime. There was probably one of those God-awful bar jokes in there.
The air fell still for several more seconds. Steve just stared at the two agents for a full minute, his pulse racing.
The world only reassembled itself slowly, while Tony lay slumped over the bench. His body was on fire, his heart was hammering and every inch of him trembled and ached. He felt wet and open and used and he just… he couldn’t even bring himself to lower his ass.
he heard Tony ask, bringing Steve out of his reverie.
Steve sat slumped on the Quinjet’s floor—he seemed to be doing that a lot lately—staring down on his phone, wishing with a good amount of desperation that he could just call Tony. Make sure he was alright. Ask what was going on. But he couldn’t. Any long-distance communication was off the table for them, and he knew he’d have to wait till they arrived in New York to know for sure if Ultron had told the truth.
close? Close enough that Steve had somehow become the most important person in Tony’s life?
, I’m just trying to do you a favor.”
"I'm not gonna change my mind," he said after a thought, guessing that Tony might need to hear this. "But I want you to understand that this gap
, Tony had never imagined it could be like this. He knew it would be amazing. How could it not be amazing? But this, right here and now, was truly mind-blowing. It was light and dark and violence and heat. And Steve was glorious like this, in complete control over him—and they were truly glorious together.
“We’ve had worse.”
From what Steve knew of Howard Stark, he really hadn’t anticipated anything different from the man. Steve tried to cast Tony a sympathetic glance when he and Rhodes became aware of their arrival, but Tony’s expression only turned into the usual mix of embarrassment and anger, and he dropped his shoulders and walked inside the RV as fast as he could.
“And Natasha?” Tony asked.
There was a hand on his shoulder, and Tony could feel the cold metal all the way to his bones. “Then don’t.”
An air blast rushed past Steve and when he managed to look up, he saw Pietro Maximoff shoving Ultron out the way. There were red blasts of magic wavering through the air, and Steve heard her before his blurry field of vision cleared up. Wanda walked towards Ultron, and the street’s guard railing was pulled out of the ground one by one. It wrapped itself around Ultron’s body, squeezing him tight.
Steve swallowed. It was hard to tell if Tony knew about their future, or if he was just generally not that keen on seeing him. It was all… it was all equally likely, wasn’t it? Even though he’d spent days—weeks—around Tony Stark, he had no idea what
There was a moment of surprised silence. “Wasn’t very subtle, was I?” Steve huffed—not quite a laugh, but close to it. “Please don’t be mad at her, we barely speak. I just… asked how you were doing. Needed to know how you were faring after…”
“Ha ha.” Steve grabbed the pillow next to him and hurled it right at Bucky’s face. Of course, he snapped it right out of the air with his metal arm, shooting Steve a shit-eating grin.
"You want me to do this
Tony’s brow furrowed. “Well,” he said. “Yeah? I don’t remember much of last night, but I’m pretty sure I didn’t score a sexy hunk like you. So it’s obviously my dream.”
“Taking it one step at a time.” Tony reached out and stroked Steve’s palm. “Well, your next step is getting through today.”
And Bucky likely wouldn’t survive it.
There was a heavy pause and Steve didn’t know what to say.
“Mmmm… Now’s your chance,” Steve murmured, half asleep already.
Tony arched a brow. “He almost killed the both of us within half a day, I think I’m allowed to call him whatever I want.”
“Don’t make me leave you hanging tonight.”
“You’re already much better. This entire thing’s gonna be one of those one-step-at-a-time shindigs.”
“Okay,” Sam whispered. “That’s scary.”
Tony sighed, opened his mouth to speak but she cut him off.
“Uh-oh!” Ian exclaimed, when the gem on Vision’s forehead suddenly glommed brightly. “Ta-ta?”
“I always loved seeing you down in the shop,” Steve admitted, trying for a tiny smile. “All mad scientist, brilliant and beautiful. Don’t know when I started looking, exactly, but I’ve wanted you for… a while now.”
“Steve… if Ultron really planned to use the city as some form of meteor… the impact will kill thousands. And once it gets high enough…”
“I’m having trouble with this,” Maria said as means of greeting. “You want to know why?”
. Steve wondered at that thought. Why
“I really wish you’d stop doing that,” Tony snapped.
“Try not to faint,” Strange said, and it took Tony a long moment to realize he had addressed him, not Steve.
Fuck it, Tony didn’t care how desperate he must be looking. Not with Steve. He only wanted more. And more.
“Great,” Steve said matter-of-factly, “but those are the keys to your house in New York. Try again.”
The words resonated deep in Steve’s mind.
Tony snorted, trying not to lose his shit right then and there. “See? That’s—you said that before. In those exact words, I think.”
“I don’t,” Bucky said, bracing himself. “I wouldn’t. You can be an ass, if you want, but so can I, and you… you’ve been good to Steve, and you gave Nat a family when she probably thought she didn’t need one, and… ah fuck, you’re a decent person, too, Stark, and I think we’ve been friends longer than we both like to admit, anyway.”
He really needed to keep himself together.
Steve’s jaw clenched, and the hands still resting on Tony’s arms moved to his cheeks once again. “You, Tony. I came here for you. And because…”
“I love you,” Steve said, trying to make Tony understand. “Whatever happened—it won’t change that. I’m right here.”
He thrashed in Steve’s hold, sputtering threats to have him sued for child abuse, and emotional manipulation, and deprivation of liberty, and a bunch of other things that only had Steve laugh out loud. Tony wiggled in his grip some more, glaring daggers because what the
“Jealous?” Natasha asked without once looking away from the television, but Tony could see a small yet scary smile tugging on her lips.
Like a man on the gallows with a rope around his neck, the wait was almost worse than the drop. He paused to collect his thoughts and put them in some kind of coherent order. “The day we brought in Loki’s scepter, do you remember how I told you I’d be willing to meet with that adoption agency?”
“Today’s gonna be packed,” he murmured. Steve’s heart rate seemed mostly back to normal, and he closed his eyes listening to the soft thumps. “Might as well grab breakfast and start early. Have a feeling Jarvis is already on it, either way. He tends to go overboard when I'm away from home that long. Fair warning.”
Steve nodded, his nerves dancing dangerously near the end of anything resembling control.
A beat.
—how long had it been already? A full minute at the very least. He should be calling for help, have Bruce come down here, or maybe Natasha, he should—
On the right side of her face, Steve could see a few very colorful bruises. Her throat was red and Steve could see the vague traces of a handprint.
When the eclipse began, Tony thought about a Million things at once. About him at ten, and him at sixteen—and the chasm of grief between those two points. He’d lost himself when Jarvis died, and for a long time, there hadn’t been a single particle left of who he was. For a long time, he’d let all that chances fall through his fingers.
With a soft groan, Tony rasped, “Fuck, you’re right. What the hell have you done to me?”
“Right,” he tried.
A soft sigh. “Isn’t that obvious?” Steve asked. “I wanted to see you. I’ve missed you.”
While the others broke into big smiles, Bucky walked over to bring him some clothes. All the while, Steve’s eyes lingered on Tony, watching how his shoulders were hunched a little, his gaze downcast and his face expressionless.
“Your opinion doesn’t matter, birdbrain,” Tony said. “You nearly shot me.”
“Whatever happened to him wasn’t his fault.”
So Thor had finally brought the antidote, and Tony knew it was something he should be happy about. No more headaches for Steve, no more having to be cautious around him, no more wracking his brain over the concept of past lives.
was heard.
“He said he needed some time out,” Clint supplied. “No big.”
Steve let out a little breath and sagged back on the grass, his arm still cradling Tony’s head. “Yeah. You?”
And also one big, giant metaphor.
“Why aren’t
“Because if you really thought things were hopeless… if you’d really stopped caring about him like you say… you wouldn’t still be wearing the dog tags he gave you.”
It was such a strange thrill to feel Tony's nakedness only against his dick, and when his fingers traced between Tony's cheeks, probing gently at his entrance, he couldn't help the hitch in his breath and how easily his finger slipped inside. "So ready…" he mumbled against Tony's lips, then pulled back and put both hands on Tony's shoulders. "Bend over the bench."
"Can't really promise that right now," Bucky said, leaning against him heavily. Steve was ready to protest but Bucky shook his head over Steve's shoulder. "It's just been a shitty year," he continued. "I could use your help."
A part of Tony needed to know that Steve wasn’t doing this because of what had happened, but didn’t have the heart to ask. When they parted, Steve’s eyes seemed to be filled with aged understanding, as though a thousand years had come and gone, as though the torments of the last few days were constantly echoing through his mind. This small lifetime that they’d squeezed into a few endless, horrible hours.
Of course Father would give it back to him
“As I said, there’s a lot of people dying to get their hands on you. And this—” He pointed to the stack of papers. “—will tell them that you’re our problem to deal with. It will keep a bazillion federal institutions off our backs. The Avengers don’t have a white card for everything, but we have certain perks when it comes to explaining ourselves and our actions. And trust me when I tell you… you need those perks.
, he clearly underestimated the amount of brain cells Tony had lost in the last twenty minutes.
“Right,” Steve said, not quite able to keep the bitter undertone out of it. “I’m off.” And with that, he made his way to the rear opening, gripping for one of the handles next to it.
“And you want us to go there and obtain the… thing?”
“Tony—”
Tony watched as Sam spread his wings then took off into the clear sky like he had been doing that every single day of his life. And he tried not to let it show how much it ripped him apart not to step into the next suit and follow him into battle.
* * *
Steve smiled ruefully and pulled Tony close to press a lingering kiss against his lips. “Got that right.” His gaze once again fell upon Barnes. “This feels terrible.”
Tony startled a little—he always zoned out when his mind was racing—, but once he’d noticed Steve approaching, he smiled at him. “Work,” he said as he leaned back, waving a hand at the circular schematic.
him?”
Steve laughed, and turned back around to arrange the last cupcakes. “So, what did you wish for?” he asked.
Tony nodded. “Yeah. I thought… maybe we can make it work like this for a while. The team. Our job’s to help people. To save and protect them. Maybe we should remember that.”
“Not your fault.”
“Afghanistan.”
He grabbed for his gun.
“I never said that.”
“It’s all right,” she said, immediately. “You know I’ve had worse.” She stood up and walked over to them, then brushed a hand down his tangled hair. “Этоничего, любимый.”
“I’m not all that good,” Tony said and chuckled when Steve pulled him near, turning him around in his arms. “I’m
“What is he doing here?” he whispered to Rhodey, hands balling into fists.
“I didn’t think it’d feel like this,” Tony mumbled into the air, voice hoarse, his hands sliding under Steve’s shoulders. “Didn’t think it could feel this good.”
"I’m sure it won't be that bad," Steve said, protesting, then grabbed for Tony's hand, squeezing it. "Maybe we can even spend a bit more time together, after?" Seeing how anxious Tony seemed to be about facing the others, Steve figured he might as well offer a silver lining.
But it was too late. Tony’s mouth was already on his and Steve’s whole body went rigid.
Rhodes only nodded at him, clearly tired, and sat down on the sofa group. Steve sat down in the passenger seat.
“Poud?” Ian asked and giggled when Steve peppered his face with more kisses.
“Ah,” he commented, trying not to sound too alarmed, then fired-up his boot thrusters and raced towards the ground. His scanners confirmed that Romanov and Barton had likely inhaled the stuff as well, but by now, they were already on safe grounds, so what he did next was a no-brainer.
“Gotta wash this off real quick,” Tony said, staring down at his briefs as if they’d personally offended him. “That powder’s driving me crazy.”
Tony raised an eyebrow. “You really expect me to eat all that?”
He looked into his eyes for a moment before his mouth reclaimed Tony’s.
He wanted those memories unlocked. He wanted that new and scary part of himself. That sort of passion, that sort of selflessness, that sort of love was something he’d craved for longer than he’d liked to admit. And to know he was going to have it—with
Steve pulled back. “I promised you,” he said, thumbs still rubbing comforting circles on his cheeks. For some reason, it made a cold shiver run up Tony’s spine. “I’m not leavin’. I meant that.”
,” Steve breathed, once he was fully settled, his brows drawn tight together. “You’re tight.”
“But that’s for
The machine’s humming grew louder, joined by a sharp, high-pitched keening sound, and there was a sudden flash of light that made Steve screw his eyelids together and bite down on his lip—
Something stilled inside Steve, and he knew what it was, it just took him a moment to find the right words.
“Yeah, I’m sure you are,” Bucky said. “Look, play games with the leftovers, okay? You have dessert deprived people out there waiting for chocolate mousse.”
Bruce only shook his head evenly. “Nope. Don’t pull me into that one.”
He pursed his lips in thought. There were flashes here and there and an odd sense that he needed to be very embarrassed when it came to looking Steve in the eye today, but other than that, nothing particularly scandalous came to mind. “No,” he said. “Not a thing. Why? Did I do something? Oh God, I did something, didn’t I? Dammit. This is why I didn’t bring any hard liquor.” He tried to sit up and immediately fell back with a pained groan.
slow. The need in his body was too intense. And from the edge in his voice, he could tell slow wasn’t exactly something Tony wanted, either. “Hold onto me,” he told Tony, and got a surprised look for it.
Tony rolled his eyes. “Flattery’ll get you nowhere, toots. As Steve wa—”
“The body they found today… There was no one sailing with Indries. It’s her body. It was hers all along, lying in that boat beneath the mansion. The woman I identified back then, it wasn’t her. I knew it wasn’t, but I told the police it was. I killed her. I killed Indries, and she was in that boat ever since.”
In their room—
“And what word would you use, Mr. Secretary?” Natasha asked with a pleasant smile.
was still surprised.
It hadn’t seemed possible before, but now… he had a feeling they could.
“So, this is… odd,” Tony said, and cleared his throat. “I think I said that already. Maybe it’s kind of a déjà vu dream, huh?”
Steve’s hold on him faltered. He stared at him, and though it took him a moment to grasp Tony’s words, the relief was bright and all-consuming.
have him back, not yet. But having Steve’s future self here was the proof that his Steve was still alive, right?
“He was always there,” he said softly, his voice even. He didn’t feel particularly sad about the whole thing—JARVIS was still there, after all, just… he’d evolved, outgrown his own self, and sometime in those last months, Tony had mostly made his peace with it.
“I know.”
have the most dysfunctional family is the whole universe.
Tony probably wouldn’t call them friends, but he sort of liked Steve, and maybe Steve sort of liked him too. Still. This was taking it a step too far.
Steve winced at the mention of his Dad, and that confirmed what Tony had already suspected: There were a lot of things Steve was desperately trying not to think about right now. Things he ignored for the time being. Which was clever of him, all things considered.
“Forgive you… for what?” he asked.
The smile on Steve’s face gentled. He drew Tony back into his embrace, and kissed his lips. “I really do.”
She was silent for a minute, her hands caressing the shoulder where his metal arm was curled around her. Softening the skin where he was as hard as stone. Soothing him where he ached.
Maria stepped closer. “And he hasn’t woken up?”
Steve’s gaze was instinctively drawn back to the ambulance where Tony was currently being examined. He was still unconscious and since he’d been underwater for almost four minutes, his skin was paler than usual. On the narrow bench next to him, Bruce was talking with one of the Sokovian doctors, alternatively nodding, shaking his head and pointing towards the arc reactor.
about it.”
was kissing him.
He did. He knew why. He just couldn’t believe it.
Tony fell silent, taken aback by the truth that he never wanted to think about; the reality of his life; the never-ending, ceaseless pattern of doing and going until he couldn’t anymore.
Tony backed up towards the door. “He’s a bit of a night owl these days,” he called over. “So don’t be surprised when he won’t go to sleep till midnight.”
“Very,” Clint agreed.
He looked so good Steve stared at him dumbly for several minutes.
Tony would know what to do. He'd make it feel good.
Grabbing a towel and wrapping it around himself, Tony headed out of the bathroom. As he passed by the door, he felt a familiar tingle, an outward tug at his core. He froze in place for a moment, then smiled as he saw Steve sitting on their bed.
“It’s Stark?” he asked incredulously.
Steve would for sure.
Vision shrugged—he’d seen Wanda do it, whenever she tried to look casual, and figured it were those little things that would make him seem more human. “He figured out who Steve was, and decided to call him out on it. He did, however, realize that Steve had no hostile plans, so he decided to play along, and lie to you in the weeks to follow.”
“No, it was his. Steve, you gotta—”
Sam stepped up next to Steve. Helping Clint to his feet, he quipped, “Look at that, guys. The world didn’t end. Again. I think it’s 34 to zero, right?”
anymore. Not just us, all of this. I need to get out, before there’s nothing of me left.”
With a low breath, he forced his muscles to unclamp around Steve. “I don’t know,” he answered truthfully, probably more than he should. “Never had to know, but… this is good…” The faint feeling of discomfort had faded almost instantly, and the only thing left was Steve, thick and large inside him. “You feel so good.”
. Steve was with him now. And he’d be damned if Steve forgot again how close they were.
Despite it being much more dramatic than he'd planned, Tony had actually said
[TStark] [chat_server:46953]
“I have that place in the Maldives,” he said. “It’s warm all year around. We could give her a little time out… Maybe fly there afterwards, ourselves. If we can’t make a proper date, maybe we can get away with a vac—”
They were going to live together in the world-famous Stark Mansion.
As if sensing Steve’s minor freak out, Tony’s eyes opened, finding Steve’s with such immediacy that he doubted he had been asleep in the first place.
“They won’t go without us, will they?”
These people had other things to deal with, that much was clear. The thousand of corpses outside—both of humans and hellish beasts—were proof enough of that.
moments like these.
Sam shrugged. “We figured you wouldn’t want to stay here, after everything’s said and done. And we’ll go where you go.”
He whirled around, relieved when he saw Rhodey and Jarvis approaching.
A loud snore from the RV sounded out in agreement.
Putting a phone inside the letter’s envelope had been a last minute’s decision. He’d only meant to apologize for everything he’d put Tony through, at first—to give the both of them some sort of temporary closure. But as soon as he’d closed the envelope, he couldn’t bear the thought of this being the end.
“But you do want it now?”
“Admit it, you have a dirty kink about catching Steve and me in compromising situations.”
“We’ll talk about this in the morning,” Steve said, forcing Tony to look at him. “We will talk about it, I promise. But not like this.” With that, he crawled out of the tent and dragged Tony with him.
A smug smile creased Steve’s mouth, and he glanced away, down, and back to him again. “At least we can talk about it now.”
“Won’t Ross suspect anything when we’re all suddenly gone?” Tony asked.
“Boss, Miss Romanoff is asking for you to come upstairs.”
Tony offered a whimper and pleadingly thrust forward. “Anything,” he said automatically, because at this point, he really wasn’t picky. Even just touching Steve, his own arousal be damned, seemed like a great idea right now. As long as he finally got to be near him,
“Blowies always count,” Tony decided. “Besides, serves him right for never knocking.”
“I slept plenty.”
Bucky was still a bit wobbly as he took his first step. Together, they walked to the stairway. It was at that moment that a loud sound filled the house, like a generator powering down. The overhead lights flickered rapidly, and then it was suddenly pitch black. A booming, crashing noise sounded from somewhere outside.
