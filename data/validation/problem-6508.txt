you Tony. It’s plain as day. You’re the only one who doesn’t see that, or you think he’s got some kind of distorted view of you after meeting this Other-You. Well guess what? He’s wanted you way before that. He’s wanted you since he met you. Even
to make Tony feel the same way. So he pulled himself together and finally pushed Tony down onto his back and climbed on top of him, giving himself a few firm strokes with his lubed up hand.
"You know. Because we missed my birthday." Tony looked down. "I know you're only hanging out with me because you have this sense of responsibility or whatever." He waved his hand in the air as if to explain it.
"Oh! A Latin Jazz band! That's a treat!" Tony settled in, deeper into his chair and leaned on Steve, listening to the smooth notes. Steve took charge in finishing dessert, loving the rich chocolate. He alternated between taking a bite, and reaching over, carefully guiding small forkfulls topped with a bit of berry to Tony. He got shivers up his spine every time Tony gleefully accepted the treat. When they were done, Steve paid, and the band picked up speed, the music turning into a quick and fun melody. Tony squeezed his arm in thanks, watching the band intently. Soon, he noticed something strange. The waiters had stopped serving food a couple songs ago. There seemed to be less and less tables every time he looked up at the band. Even though everyone was done with their meals, no one had left. Instead, more and more people were now standing by the bar, or on the floor in the middle of the restaurant, dancing.
"Yeah, I'm fine. Just...thought your bathroom was on this side…" Tony slowly answered. Well, it wasn't like Tony would know his bedroom layout all that well, so Steve let himself drift near sleep again. He listened as the other man slipped back into his clothes and shuffled to the other wall towards the bathroom. When he heard the toilet flush loudly, he realized the bathroom door was wide open. Huh. It was odd but...well he supposed Tony was never really a very private person.
He couldn't believe it was already so late, time flew by and he didn't even realize it until the bar announced last call. They had spent the night drinking fruity mocktails to keep awake, chatting with friendly patrons, standing on the sidelines as they watched impromptu dance-offs between the regulars, enthusiastically cheering them on. Best of all, Steve enjoyed dancing song after song with Tony, who was kind enough to only let Steve be his partner.
"So, where do you want to go for dinner, baby?" Steve kissed Tony again, wondering if he'd ever be able to keep his hands to himself again. Probably not.
forgotten. The New Hero Deal - the new name for the amended Accords - had been signed by everyone just a couple weeks ago. It was worldwide news at the time, and when it was first announced, everyone that signed had been bombarded with interviews, cameras and meetings with national leaders from all around the world. They took some time off to move in and adjust to their new teammates. But the press conference today was their first public appearance together. The whole team would be there.
He sat, uncomfortably, on his couch. He pulled up the photo of him and Not-Tony again, and stared at it for a long time. It already felt like the events of last night happened years ago. A lifetime ago. He
He'd been on the other side of the room all night, talking to Rhodey. Steve knew this because he couldn't stop himself from glancing over every few minutes. It felt like they caught each other's eye more than a couple times over the course of the evening. Steve wondered if Tony noticed the heavy weight of anticipation in the air too. All of Tony's favorite songs had already played, but he hadn't moved, strange for someone who loved to dance at every opportunity he could get, especially with friends.
"Why can't you be more sympathetic, Platypus? I'm having an existential crisis over here. Plus you were already nearby."
"Really? The Red Sox? Aren't you from Manhattan, though?" After a while, they had taken residence on the stools facing the stadium, where they could see the whole field. Facing the windows, he felt like he could ask Tony anything without fear of being interrupted. To his surprise though, the rest of the team seemed to be intent on leaving them be.
"Sounds like he's either really dense, or wanted to kiss you and chickened out. I'm sure you're making this way bigger in your head than it really is, knucklehead." Tony tried to think back to that moment, but just then his phone dinged.
He could. He got comfortable on his side, he could only see Tony's face on the screen, Jarvis probably just had a screen in front of Tony while he worked. But it was exactly what he needed.
"Just like you said. To go to Tajikistan with us. You know - to help with construction and setting up security and stuff." Steve was confused. Isn't this what they had been planning for the last couple of days?
"Hey. Just wanted you to know.." Tony wrapped himself up tighter in his blanket, Steve thinking he looked like a little burrito. "I know it's lonely. But I was thinking, if you start to feel that way again, y-you have me. I know I'm not much, but you can always ask me to come see you. Or you know, we can hang out when you come back home. O-or you could call? Or text. I mean, whatever you need really-" Steve leaned down and hugged the other man, pulling him up to his chest.
"Huh." Tony got a little uncomfortable. "Mm. 'Kay. Uh, Jarvis'll let you know where to meet me Saturday morning. So just...call if you need anything, 'Kay? Okay. See ya then, Cap."
"Earlyyy...." Steve chuckled, yeah. He supposed they did stay up pretty late last night and he was only fine because he didn't need as much sleep, being a supersoldier.
"Stevie here saved the day, so I'm making him some breakfast. Don't worry, I made enough for everyone."
"Shocking. I know." Tony looked back out to the game, and fiddled with his soda bottle. "I don't seem like the type, right? Especially with all my daddy issues. But I think that's exactly
"So. You disappeared earlier." She pulled Steve aside, away from any nosy agents that might be stalking the halls.
“No. You can stay.” Tony whipped his head around excitedly, but Pepper held up a finger. “I only have one stipulation. You need to be honest. What is going on with you? Rhodes told me about Steve. How he had sex with...your twin from another timeline or something.”
“Team? Ha!” Tony’s rage came to the surface again. “Are you serious right now? All this shit, and you're still worried about the
"Yes. A party. For you. Get with the program, Cap." Tony came to his side and gave him a little shove with his elbow. "You're not still tired are you? Jarvis said you just got up."
“My hero!” Tony sang out. They took each other’s hands and unknowingly headed to their next (successful) mission.
“So...everything is different because...I got blinded by the sun for a second?” Steve scratched his head.
“Yeah. I know you want to cum, honey.” Tony spoke into his crotch, as if he was speaking to his dick. It would’ve made Steve chuckle, if he wasn’t barely grasping onto his sanity at the moment. “But you’re going to have to wait a little longer. I want to make you cum harder than that Other-Tony did.”
tw// There's a small mention of rape in this chapter - nothing actually happens, the act is just mentioned in coversation briefly with no descriptors.
"Yeah, I was planning on it." Steve reached down and pulled one long blanket off him, and Clint was finally free.
"I'll bet it can be. You should ask him. I'm sure he'd tell you just how hard it was for him." Pepper said wisely. Tony thought about it. It struck him, just then, that he hadn't told Steve about Other-Steve kissing him. Not that it compared to what Steve had done anyways. It was completely disproportionate. He hadn't even had the time to say anything, really. I mean, it's not even relevant at this point...
The thought of being Tony’s hit him like a punch in the gut, and he came, hard. He pumped up into Tony’s mouth, his hips seizing up uncontrollably. Tony's eyes rolled up, watching as Steve came undone. He forced Steve’s cock deeper still, his nose buried into the short patch of hair he kept trimmed, tickling him a bit. When Steve’s cock stopped throbbing in his mouth, Tony finally pulled back, coughed up a bit of spunk, and wiped his mouth through a satisfied grin. Steve was laying on his back, a faraway look on his face, his mind blank for once as he came down from his high. He felt Tony tenderly run his hands up and down his thighs.
"You guys go ahead. Steve and I have some work to discuss. We'll meet you there later." Tony's voice was cool and collected, nothing like how Steve felt right now.
"Great. So you guys are dating now. Why couldn't this have just been a quick call, again? And where exactly is your boy toy, anyways? He better not walk out of that bedroom naked."
The fashion show didn't happen. Although, the night wasn't a complete waste. Actually, it ended up being nice. Really nice.
“And I’ll make some drinks! I’m the best bartender in Hungary, you know. Remember Budapest?” He asked Natasha as he stood up excitedly.
"To be fair, this is a very complicated matter. The dangers of leaving our reactor in such a place - I would hate for the technology to fall into the wrong hands."
that these science experiments are important to you, but while I’m gone...you can’t just do something so dangerous without telling someone. Anyone. Please, Tony. I just don’t want you getting hurt.”
“Woe is you.” Bucky pushed Steve’s legs off the sofa and sat next to him. “You guys made up. He wouldn’t be putting in all this effort to fix the team by your side if he didn’t care at least a little. Just be nice to him for a change.”
They took turns bashing Tony Stark, calling him every name in the book. Accusing him of treason. Saying he was gullible, arrogant, had grandiose delusions. It felt like an eternity of torture passed before Steve finally had the floor. He was fuming. He stood up, knowing it would catch everyone's attention, crossing his arms and eyeing the suddenly alert group. He heard a quiet
As the hours passed, and Tony worked on all of Steve's essentials, his anger lost steam. Rhodey and Pepper tried to reach him, but he ignored those calls too, letting them know through Jarvis that he was fine and would call back. He kept trying to convince himself that he was just looking out for someone who didn't have a lot of experience in this century. But the quiet walls of the lab wouldn't truly believe that. He knew Steve could take care of himself. That's not what this was about.
“You didn’t really need to. We’ll have to move it all again next week anyways.” Tony didn’t even look up as he closed another drawer and walked to the closet instead, abandoning whatever he was looking for in that dresser.
"It's not about the destination, Tony. I want to see the country and its people. That means getting to know everything
"What if he doesn't like me back?" Steve stared up at the ceiling, not wanting to meet Natasha's piercing stare. "If we had to just be friends, I think I could live with that. But if things were to get weird between us, or if I scare him off and then he wants nothing to do with me...I can't lose him like that. I need him in my life. Isn't there just some way to let him know I like men and I'm interested? That way he could make up his own mind if he wants to reciprocate - like some code? In the war, we used to put a baby blue handkerchief in our back pocket, or say we're 'a friend of Dorothy's' as a signal. Something like that?"
"He's the Iron Man, An Avenger, Superhero. I'm safe." Bain spoke to the head of security, but her smiling eyes were fixed on Iron Man.
"I know. No, I mean, who doesn't know? I mean, everybody knows it's National Day. Wow, I didn't know it was your birthday. Happy birthday!"
“You were wrong about me, Tony. I don't want a throne, I just want a second chance. A chance for you to let go of what you thought of me. A chance for us to put everything behind and start all over again."
"Well, I'll call on Iron Man to defeat him." Bucky picked up the silver-barrel-monster next to him. "He can shoot Unibeam and knock your shield away. Boom, boom... "
"You followed him?!" At this, Spider understood. "You left me in prison to die! What about implementation as planned? What about teamwork?"
"I know, but what do you think about my age with a suitcase around the campus, more likely to cause raised eyebrows. I don't want to be seen as a strange Uncle."
“Jarvis, bring me my coat. I'll go to Rogers' again before daylight. At least tell the mother her son is okay. If she gets crushed, we're all screwed."
"Well, let's do it. Iron Man and Spider-Man will fix up the Jet. Hawkeye and I will stay here to look after these guys, take over S.H.I.E.L.D." Steve returned to the captain's normal state, arranged the task.
Tony's frustration didn't last long. Ten minutes later he sat up, put on his watch, pressed a few buttons, called up a memo, adding: upgrade armor system, add auto-cleaning, medical repair and auto-pilot sleep assistance. priority 5 stars.
"You're not just a human being. The Tony I know is not. Iron Man is still the smartest person in the world when he takes off his armor."
This time Steve didn't get off his raised hand, but lightly patted the crying child in his arms on the back.
"I... I was just busy. I was busy saving him, and then trying to keep him out of jail, and then trying to keep him from drowning, and then trying to keep him from crying, and then busy for... So, I forgot..."
"Don’t treat yourself as an old man just because your old teammates are old or dead. What is someone saying in that perfectly righteous sentence? 'Their life is their life; Your life is your life'. So, live in the moment, don't be a man out of time.
"Damn it! What the hell? Libra! You pick a hell of a time. Send me back, now! Don't bring me here even if all the universes are going to be destroyed. In an hour, thirty minutes at least..."
"I'm already thinking about coming here for Christmas Eve dinner next year." Tony said with a smile.
"Then do something about it. Can't you hack into that perverse, powerful Forever Crystal? If the data is wrong, fix the data."
"I know the weather is tough to get out of. The house is a little small. We haven't had a chance to be alone these past few days. And Seth is a little fierce." Kris whispered in Tony's ear. "The good news is that Seth is busy cooking Christmas Eve dinner and the two kids are helping to cause trouble in the kitchen, so we can sneak out to the barn."
"You misunderstood me. I meant that no one other than me would bother you." Said Bain, closing the door of the room.
"You are too late, now we have no money. When he died, we were strapped for cash on Jane's support alone. I think Tasha will scold me for ruining the Quinjet this time. I'm afraid we can't afford a new one."
"Just say, you are too stupid. Recently, Tony Stark has been playing for too long. I was thinking of taking an opportunity to let Iron Man come out for act."
"I think eventually only Tony himself can solve this mess, so we have to hurry up and get him ready. No matter how afraid we lose him again, but we need Iron Man, the world needs Iron Man."
Sitting in a traffic jam on the Lower East Side, Mr. Krats grew increasingly agitated. His shoes kept beating against the bottom of the car.
"Oh? Are you talking about democracy instead of leadership, Cap. Or do you want to pass the buck?"said Tony coldly.
"Well, I don't particularly want to sell them, but as things stand, they're the only big payers left." Krats said with a shrug. "You must have a pistol in your drawer, the one you're going to shoot yourself in the head tonight. You can shoot me with it now."
"That means, how long the two of us are going to take care of this little brat depends on how soon the headless heroes inside find their way back. That's so annoying."
"Because I want to be able to play everywhere. We're locked up on this stupid island. I want to have some fun."
"You mean that motorbike?" Tony said as he fired a repulsor at the motorbike, which fell apart in a split second.
Then more Doom robots emerged from shadowy corners and attacked the Iron Man. Tony sighed. He knew it wouldn't be easy to meet the real Doom. So he concentrated, concentrating on the Doom army in front of him. As the number of Doom robots increased, Tony became impatient. He collected the robots in one spot with bait, then pulled off the shield and fired with Unibeam on his chest.
"Congrats, Vic. You ‘pop’ like this, all my data is ruined. I don't have a habit of saving files every minute."
"I think I can figure out a way to neutralize his poison, but I don't have anything in my hand right now. Oh! I hate places without technology. Wait, Dr. Octopus’ lab is here. If I can slip in... Even if I can open the prison door, I can't escape all these guards."
Garth, Professor Elden’s assistant, Level A Contact: Mr. Stark, we need to talk about your attendance and your paper. If you don't want to take science again next semester, you have to hand your paper at the end of this week.
"But he used to be nice to me, and to my mother, only because he was out of work, and my presence annoyed him." Steve hung his head and said crestfallen.
Steve was in the pilot's seat. Tony was in the copilot's seat. Hawkeye and Spider-Man in the back row.
"Yes, back then we were just close friends. In order to make up for my mistake, I didn’t give up searching. It was a very cold winter in New York City. It was snowing heavily that day. On such a blizzard night, I was very worried about him, so I drove my motorcycle to every tavern in the city... When I finally found him, he passed out in a dark alley wearing a single coat. I picked him up, took him back to the Avengers Mansion. He was shaking in my arms all the time. I put him on the bed, covered him with a quilt. He was still shaking, pulled me, begged me not to leave. So, I stayed..."
"It's not too far from turning here in California anyway. Besides, I wanted to see Captain America and Iron Man being escorted into the police station for a street fight."
"You're bored." Said Tony, slightly disappointed. Then he blew the candles on the cake. "All right, guys, let's eat the cake. It is a big surprise cake."
"Something interesting. Which means there's no space-time turbulence in that new place, no Weirdo Doom. That’s perfect."
"Seem to have seen you before. I got it. This magazine..."A policeman held up a magazine, and the model in that magazine was dressed a little bit.
A meter away in the bed, Peter was not asleep. The spider sensor, which was always ineffective at times, now works properly. He saw Tony's every movement, and he felt his growing desire. He had seen Tony put on his headphones, he had seen him close his eyes, he had seen him unbutton his pajamas one by one, revealing the muscles of his chest. The implant in his chest flickered in the dark, seductive. He saw that he began to reach out and caress himself, following the lines of his muscles, going down... He saw his desire to rub his genitals, his head constantly thrown back, his legs and toes constantly straightened. He heard him groan and gasp.
I have an S+ contact? I didn't even know that. It seems that I still need to tweak this new system. Tony played the message.
With the help of Iron Man, people in Dent Village evacuated from the bottom of the valley in an orderly manner.
"All right, all right. Don't get lost in there, wait for me to find you." Tony had an impulse to lift his mask and rub his eyebrows.
The train rocked slowly. Peter, who was sitting opposite Tony, fell asleep. Then Kris fell asleep on Tony's shoulder. Tony took out his book, continued drawing the draft for Spider Armor. He started shortly after the journey started. The journey was too long. He was too bored. Looking at Peter, he got some inspiration and started on his long-delayed design.
"After the diagnosis, it can provide 4.62 hours of support without the shield or 3.21 hours of support with continuous shield."
The tower's alarm goes off wildly. A group of guards rushed in, firing a volley of guns at the intruder. To make matters worse, the armor shows less than 1% of the energy left, just enough to sustain Tony's chest implant. Now, so to speak, it is just a pair of old-fashioned armor.
There is a toy shop in an alley deep down Evans Street. It is called a toy shop, but it is not like a toy shop. It is not like other toy shops that hang colorful balloons, have clowns, wooden horses, swing cars and other things to attract the attention of children on the porch. It is gray, in the showindow of all kinds of weird things. A flying saucer with claws, a metal ball with eyes, a small box with a rotating leaf on top, a three-legged torch, a metal cup with an upside down umbrella, an iron box with holes, a watch without hands... Even on a clear day, this place looks eerie. No children wanted to go near it. It was said that the shopkeeper would lure children in and put them in a basement for gruesome experiments.
Hawkeye sat down in a chair, drinking his wine. Tasha walked over to him, handed him an ice pack. Hawkeye put it on his face, sure enough, the place where he had been beaten was burning.
Don't end up in a coffin. Don't. Tony thought. He sat up straight and felt around, but could not touch the barrier. Not a coffin, thank the world.
He saw the blonde girl still standing on the side of the road. He pulled out his hand, which was being held by the brown-haired boy, and bent over to pick up the fallen painting. Just then, a siren sounded and a policeman came running with a baton.
The setting sun dappled the black monument. The memorial is engraved with names. There were many white-haired elderly people in wheelchairs nearby. Steve stood in front of the monument, searching for familiar names, bringing up memories of the era in his mind. He thought about Bucky, he thought about Peggy, he thought about the Invaders, Human Torch, Toro, Namor... And those who fought alongside him, forever drowned in battle, but failed to leave their names on this monument.
"I'll slide down a little, a bit. Scream when you're in pain." With that, Steve split Tony's buttock.
"Sometimes I forget he's an Android. He is becoming more and more like a human being. Mr. Krats is amazing."
"What? Are you sure? Not fighting prehistoric monsters? Not to stop the Galactus? Not even have to hit the Red Skull? Just deliver a bat?"
"That's what I'm worried about. Don't let anything that is so far ahead of the technology of that time come into existence that it will gravely disrupt the timeline. You already know the consequences of creating an extreme paradox."
"I want to go to bed early!" Tony said aloud. The Spymaster was a little confused about what he was selling.
The Zodiac has a key to knowledge, which can open the space of all dimensions... use the word of this age, 'digital library'. Others focus only on the weapons of knowledge, while I focus on philosophy, the philosophy of the cosmos. I've been studying it for years, and the answer is only one word 'Balance.'The multiverse must be balanced."
He hadn't been home in days. His hair was messy, his eyes were red, and there was nothing but whiskey on his table. He could not look like this to investors.
Tony leaned over and kissed the old idiot who was naked underneath him, and then he went inside him. Better than he could have imagined, better than any woman he had ever experienced before. The feeling of deep immersion, the sense of security enveloped in it, and the dangerous lure of every rise and fall, made him want to sink deeper and want more. He wondered why he hadn't thought of doing this before. He even knew that he would agree if he asked. Perhaps subconsciously, he was afraid of falling so deep, into his body, into his heart, into his thoughts, and going further and further with him. He is so thick that it is easy to become infatuated with him after reading page after page. From the moment he entered him, Tony had fallen in love with the feeling of being in him.
"So that's what you want? Become the dictator of this space, enslaving all people. You will be disappointed. Any tyrant will eventually be overthrown, no matter what lies he tells his people."
"Catch! Don't interfere, old man. Today I am going to practice the fighting skills you taught." Tony was already in combat mode as he said.
"Swilce an hatian, dearr to abealg God, wite se mihte of Mjolnir.(Such a despicable, dare to offend god, taste the power of Mjolnir)." Thor shouted, knocking down several guys in front of him.
"So... You're actually a fake baseball fan, you haven't even been to a baseball game." Tony laughed.
"My world! My girl! No, your girl! If it wasn't for the girl in your painting, you wouldn't have been targeted. Never mind the painting! Run! Trust me, prison is no fun."
Compared with the threat posed by Hulk, they were minor, minor problems that no one would notice. If they hadn't searched for Hulk, passed this area, suddenly lost contact, they wouldn't pay special attention to the abnormal regional magnetic field. If Libya is telling the truth, this issue is far more serious than the threat they are currently dealing with, could lead to a global crisis.
A man walked slowly to the station with a large bouquet of flowers. The bouquet was so large that it hid the giver's face.
Over the Atlantic Ocean, Iron Man was flying, holding Spider-Man's arms. Peter's eyes were tightly closed.
Tony looked at himself in the mirror, seemed to look sloppy. He touched a layer of stubble that had grown above his lips.
From the lab, Krats watched the scene unfold through a monitor on a screen. He shrugged, headed down and continued to build his "toy," which took shape like a silver armor stack of iron buckets.
Everyone in the restaurant turned to look at him. Kris, who was sitting opposite Tony, tugged at his sleeve.
Although the Avengers were less effective in this battle, these enemies did not fight them for long. Perhaps the chaos in New York City may just throw a stone to clear the road. Libra, the Zodiacal messenger, left the earth with the remnants of his gang. The black circle disappeared, and the sun was restored in New York.
Tony pulled up his swivel chair to the table, grabbed the sandwiches on the plate, and began to eat. When the taste of peanut butter came into his mouth, it was sweet to him. He wolfed down the sandwich, sticking out his tongue and licking the crumbs at the corners of his mouth. Steve smiled as he finished his meal.
"Bucky, my mom won't be home for a while, so why don't you tell me a story? A story about the barrel-monster."
"Tony, after what happened today, I hope you trust your teammates more, trust Avengers more. Sometimes it is easier to tell the truth, is it?" Said Black Widow.
Tony, now in prison, was depressed. Yesterday he drank a dozen beers, and when his head got hot, he promised to take the Rush Brotherhood’s rookies to steal the painting, but he was arrested. I had the potential to be a criminal. I have a criminal record now. I don’t have to be 29 to become a big badass. Compared to me, he was a saint. He had been the Iron Man for years.
Tony found a power source to recharge his chest implant. While Tony was recharging, Steve let Spider-Man out, even though he could have done it by himself.
"What? Why are you both looking at me? I'm not ready to move back yet. I was just thinking, I think Jarvis has changed the title to you."
"No, I've made a lot of mistakes. If it hadn't been him, I would make a mistake that I'll regret it for the rest of my life. Shortly after I joined the Avengers, I met Zemo, the man who killed Bucky. Despite Iron Man's objection, I followed Zemo to South America alone. I beat Zemo, but I didn't stop. I grabbed Zemo's neck... The scene of Bucky falling from the plane was magnified. Resentment around my head. Then he was in... The charter he had framed in the Mansion; the room he had made for me; the uniforms he had hung in my wardrobe; the shield he had mended on my desk... Although I didn't use any of the high-tech equipment in that room, it made me feel that the world was not so strange. Revenge resentment suddenly seemed less important than anything else I had gained, so my grip on Zemo's neck loosened."
‘Damn it! Libra! #&@% Looks like you've cut a short way into my head. That's convenient. Get out of here! ’
Spider-Man had been stuck to a nearby wall. When Tony's eyes rested on him, he scratched his head and said: "Guys, is it time for the awe-inspiring lines? I'm really bad at this. 'Make sure you don't miss the decimal point, and bring us all back, Tony. 'How about this?"
"Young master Antony, you are too much in the way. You didn't hold an umbrella in such heavy rain. I'll get you a cup of hot chocolate."
"And we know at least one thing after this, we can't indulge men too much, inside them all lives a little boy. Most of the time we women are more mature and calmer, know when to make tough rational decisions."
"What am I going to say if they ask where Tony and Peter are, and how do I explain where Iron Man and Spider-Man came from?"
"Criminal mastermind, creating chaos, Ha-ha." Libra suddenly laughed, he raised his hand and slowly turned around. "Tony Stark, very well, very well. Just yourself today. I've been waiting for you."
"Hulk is an selden feond in mine lif. I habbe feaht mid him fela langlice beforan, ne sige. Se feoht is an lif and hryre of Midgard, mine lic is badan, Mjolnir earfopne to drafan... (Hulk is really a rare opponent in my life. I have fought with him many times before, no victories. This battle is a life-and-death of Midgard, my body is constrained, Mjolnir is difficult to drive..)" Thor began to rattle on about the details of his battle with the Hulk. Steve chimed in now and then, but he couldn't keep his eyes off the door.
"I've been thinking about it since last night." Tony put his arms around Steve, gave him a long deep kiss.
"You know now. Do you think I'm a Philistine?" Kris hung her head a little worried, stirred the food on her plate with a fork.
"The weather here is also unusual, Zzzz... Heavy rain triggered a mudslide, Zzzz... Spider-Man and I had things under control for now, Zzz... Transfer request..."
"Thankfully, his heart hasn't completely stopped beating yet. I'm going to reverse the airship's power to the implant in his chest. Hoping it works."
"It's all your fault, Hank. You drove too slowly. Look what we missed. Congratulations, Cap. "Jane leaned in and kissed Steve on the right cheek, then she turned kissed Tony on the left. “And you, Tony. I knew you two would be together again. It's like back to the old days, isn't it? We're family again."
Steve felt a strong uneasiness, the uneasiness that he would once again lose Tony forever. He opened the drawer and found the watch. He turned on the locator. There was no indication of Tony's position. He ran out of the room to the mainframe room, located Tony's Avenger ID card, which indicated that Iron Man was located in the Avenger Mansion hangar. Steve sprinted over hopefully, spotted a brand new vintage motorcycle in the spot where Iron Man should have been. His shield was hanging from the motorcycle, and the small dent in it that Tony had broken had been repaired. Tony's ID card was on the seat.
"Believe it or not, Doom is above lying." Doom shrugged off Ironman's provocation, then said with a sneer, "I know who did these, but all I can say is that Tony Stark made too many enemies. I can tell you, but it's a lot less fun, isn't it?"
"I hadn't really thought about it. I've never been good at dealing with media things. He used to do all these things, our funding, our equipment, our satellite information, contacting the government and S.H.I.E.L.D., solved our various legal permission and collateral damage issues after battle... I didn't need to worry about all those things in all these years. I just needed to lead the Avengers, kick the bad guy's ass. He did other things, and then kicked the bad guy's ass with me. Now he's gone..." Steve looked up at the pictures on the wall, his mind grew long again.
"I could have to solve this matter earlier. But I... I procrastinated time unconsciously. To fight with you, just the two of us... Let me... It made me so happy. When I came to the future, after so many chaotic things, it was the first time I was so happy. That makes me forget that so many people in the world are still counting on us... counting on Avengers."
Tony cried for a long time. At last, he felt something was wrong. It did not seem to be Jarvis that he was holding. The contours of the chest and the warmth of the hands that beat on his back were familiar to him. A thought flashed through his mind, but he did not want to look up at the fact. He stopped crying and froze. Steve sensed Tony's stiffness too, so he broke the silence.
"I thought the Avengers had priority permission from the U.N. to act around the world. "said the Hawkeye.
"Well, I was just passing by. I heard someone crying. Children calling for help. Well, I guess I heard something wrong, I heard the wrong thing. Sorry, sorry, I'm your good neighbor Spiderman. I'm always at your service."
"Nothing new." Said Tony vaguely. "All I can say is that whether the prediction of Libra is true or not, it is certain that the earth will not be destroyed for a while. If it makes you feel any better."
After thinking about it, he added: Call Maria Foundation to restore Central Park, priority 4; Fix Steve's shield, priority 3; Build an old fashion motorbike for Steve, priority 1.
Steve's shield flew out, caught in the long whip of the Whiplash. A light from Tony's machine fell on the shield. The shield shook quickly, and the whip that wrapped the shield shattered into pieces.
"I've guided Franklin to set up a Pocket Universe where all heroes who jump into the vortex of time should be safe. They just have to wait until Iron Man's machine filters out enough space-time energy to neutralize the time turbulence."
"Steve, I have an idea now, but it's a risky idea. The success rate is about 50 percent or less." Tony said.
"The S.H.I.E.L.D. mission put me in a hurry, and the preparation for doing this is quite complicated."
At this time, Steve's voice was warm and deep. Tony could feel his breath blowing to his ears, blowing the tips of his hair, twitching itching.  But his restrained state made him unable to lift his hands. He just let the itching grow.
"My sonic attacks only temporarily dissociate him and contain him, but soon the electrostatic particles still accumulate, which is not the ultimate solution." Tony said.
"But I would say you shouldn't get your hopes up. The hole is so big, Dr. Octopus may not have sampled all the minerals." Tony said.
"Thank you for the compliment, but you are wise enough. Blended in with the Rush fraternity applicants, acted like an outcast newcomer, captured my heroic psychology, added a few drinks, urged me to take you to steal the painting. You deliberately gave me the wrong shift time, got me caught. And then you used Brennan to get Kris to bail me out. You figured it would be hard for me to say no to her invitation to a party when I got out of jail.
Steve lifted Tony, who was already naked, to the bay window, opened his legs and leaned down between them, unbuttoning his pajamas one by one, kissing his body as it came off.
"You see, he was a famous playboy, who people on the fringe like me read about him every day in the papers. In the social, financial, tech, and entertainment sections. He was the target of big or tabloid reporters."
"Tony. This is the path he chose, not the path you chose. You're young, you're in college, and you can go through all kinds of life. Don't let his life be a burden to you."
"Nonsense. When you returned from 'outer space,' you could have conducted your experiments in the lab at the Avengers' mansion, but instead you hid in Doctor Octopus's lab."
"Oh? It's full of all kinds of old-fashioned stuff. There's no high tech like Tony's room, it should not conform to any Tony's interests."
Tony sat straddling Steve, put his hands around his neck, kissed him hard. The kiss lasted thirty seconds. As they parted, there was a hint of appeal in Tony's smile.
In the future, I will be with Tony, in a permanent partnership. We live in a horrible high-tech tower with lots of basement floors. Under my temptation, we probably have one or two children, using both of our genes, and nine out of ten will be born with the help of Pym Biotechnology. Tony won't listen to my advice about naming them. He'll probably just call them Mark 1 and Mark 2 without too much fuss. He will hate to take care of kids, leave all the chores to A.I. We will have robot butlers, robot nannies, robot cleaners, robot chefs...
There was no echo, the place beside him was empty. No need to read the message. It must be Avengers Daily. Tony rolled over on his left side again, landed on Steve's accustomed side. With the familiar smell, continue to close his eyes.
"That... Hm... Tony told me." Peter picked up Gatlin and walked out to avoid more questioning from Kris.
"The previous mission on the California coast was actually what I suggested to Tasha to let you back up. I know you were in the area and I was a bit busy, because at that time I was..." Tony whispered something in Peter's ear.
The man who had been helpless and vulnerable vanished, became a reliable leader again. Perhaps the best cure for him is fighting. Maybe Tony is the same.
"Nothing. Same old, same old. To do some scientific research in outer space." Tony answered with a shrug.
"I don't know, I don't feel him. I just know that with you by my side, I'm not so scared. Will you stay this time? I mean, are you coming to see me again soon? I understand... You live far away and you're busy... I do hope you'll come and see me more often. Or you can tell me where you live and I'll go and see you." Steve's voice trailed off until he dropped his head and ceased talking.
"You asshole, can't you thank us for throwing you a party when our money is so tight?" Hawkeye said, carefully concealed the altered brush.
Finally, he couldn't resist opening the only message from the S+ contact. Steve's voice is soft and thick. "A level 5+ tornado broke out in Colorado... I didn't wake you up. You’d better eat something before you rush out."
"And you promised to follow my plan... And I... I chose to be a coward this time. "said Tony thoughtfully.
"Well, since you admit it, I'll take the one in your room." Tony looked up and kissed him on the chin, took his hand, walked out of the lab.
He's Tony Stark. If he doesn't want to be found, then no one can find him. If he doesn't want to be chased, then no one can catch him. And I'm just an old man on a motorcycle.
"No, my armor is equipped with an automatic drying system." Tony said as he gently pulled down Steve's mask. Steve's blond hair was instantly drenched. "And you, you won't catch a cold."
So, this time Tony gave Steve a long kiss as the door closed behind him. But this time it was he who did not get a very enthusiastic response.
"I was so frightened. I rolled over, put my ear to the door and listened. There was a pattering sound in the distance, like footsteps, which I could not make out if I did not listen carefully. I grew more and more frightened. But I knew that if I didn't figure out what the sound was, I would be afraid all the time. So I decided to see what it truly was. I put on your... I mean, the uniform of the hero that I admired so much... I went down the stairs, down the hall, around the hallway, down the basement... Every step I took, my heart was pounding. Every step I took, I wanted to run to my room and hide, but I didn't. I felt like wearing something with his logo on it. He would be there for me. That gave me courage."
"I've been thinking about it since last night." Tony put his arms around Steve, and gave him a long deep kiss.
"There was a fire on campus, Iron Man saved her. I took care of her at the hospital." Tony said calmly.
At this time, Jarvis came through the door, pushing a dining trolley which had a big cake on it. Seeing this, Tony became so excited.
"It seems that your friends have come to see you. I can't keep you today." Bain said with a smile. "But don't worry, we'll be seeing each other again, Iron Man."
It would be a two-story cabin with a fire in winter and an old ceiling fan in summer. The walls are covered with yellow photos and my paintings... My children, my wife, the countryside... The children's toys were scattered all over the house, tripping Peggy and me. Peggy's face would have wrinkles, her hair would be dyed with silver gradually, but she is still beautiful. Because of housework and children, her temper might be a little bad. Sometimes she might teach these little bad kids a lesson, then they would hide behind me, seek refuge. I must soothe their angry mother.
"Put it back. Maybe you'll need it again someday." Steve handed Tony the mask. "The irony is that he didn't make the device to filter poison, he did it to filter alcohol. It turned out to be effective against countless poisons, but not alcohol. And his drinking problem was getting worse..." Steve's mind drifted a little further.
"Dr. Octopus was a bit stuffy in his single room. I had no trouble getting him to talk. He was on that island on a commission from Zodiac to examine certain minerals." Tony said. "The bad news is that a week after we left the island, a volcanic eruption flooded the mine."
Then they went back to doing what they had been doing before Tony fell asleep, and that's when the Avenger ID card went off. Tony, who already knew where Steve's Avenger ID card was, took Steve's card to hand.
"It's kind of boring, like a retirement home. Would you like some dessert?" Hellcat handed over the plate.
"You can’t fly. Your following will only slow me down. You stay and take care of the DeGanns. Do you have your Avengers ID card?"
"Aged stalking beats your future technology." Tony looked into Steve's eyes in disbelief. He saw a smile in them. He knew immediately that he had been fooled.
"I'm so sorry, Mr. Krats, I'm late. The Great Depression is over, and the streets have become congested. It's a little inconvenience that comes with something good." Carbonell came in, smiling. At the sound of his voice, Krats stood up. He took the hand that Carbonell held out to him.
"Well, I know what you're trying to ask. It's easy for you to guess sometimes. Ha-ha." Libra laughed. "Depends on what you mean by 'the same.' Nothing can ever be completely 'the same.' It's a whole new world. When you wake up, it will be a whole new day... Now go to sleep, go to sleep, Tony. '
"That's an important part of the purpose of this class. We often lose electronic contact with other Avengers, and at that time we need a tacit understanding without explicit information."
Tony looked thoughtfully at Jarvis as he left. When he turned around, he saw Thor and Steve both staring at him.
"No. Don't you know everything under the window? The one who hired him has high-end technology. It's above me. I can't figure it out yet, so let him go. And he/she isn’t going to kill me at all, just trying to get me to give up Iron Man identity. Spymaster will go back, send word. He/she will know that I have fully understood the purpose, and I will never give up my armor. I think he/she will back off, stop bothering me."
Tony flew out the window, found an open field 30 miles to the left. He turned back, flew to the window of the Quinjet. When they lost electronic contact, it was all about body language and chemistry. Tony pointed out the direction to Steve, flew under the Quinjet to steady its turbulence. With their cooperation, the Quinjet narrowly landed in the open space above the cliff. Iron Man dragged up a pile of sand and dust at his foot.
The most special one? This applies to every Tony Stark, including the recently blackened one. These philosophical lunatics can recite a few chicken soup philosophies anytime. Tony shook his head, laughing at himself. He walked back to the machine, finished the final operation of balancing the magnetic field.
"Disgusting. You really have peculiar eccentricities, Dr. Octopus. That's where Spider-Man would go."
"No, I mean..." Paige still didn't look at Steve’s eyes. "They knew. They knew about me sneaking back from school with you and going into the toy shop. They all say it's not good for me. They say you are strange, your family are pagans, and the Puritans aren't supposed to hang out with pagans."
"It's not that I haven't been thinking about moving back. But after that night...You know, after that, everyone assumed that he and I were supposed to be a couple and I was supposed to move back. They asked me again and again. But I don’t want to... I don't want to be tied to him, or anyone else. The sense of anticipation that has been set in my life bothers me. Everyone thinks I love him, but it's not. It's just hormones. It's just hormones somehow, inexplicable. He's the only man I've ever felt this way about. I don't know why nobody believes me."
"Whiplash, you actually still have a chance to change. Think about your children. What would they think of your crime today?"
And then there was a fire. How could a small fire be Iron Man? Without even thinking, I put on armor to be a hero, and played the role to save beauty. I put the unconscious Kris in the attic of the building opposite, without paying close attention to the environment, which was filled with tanks of oxygen, helium, and nitrogen. I covered the fire with an electric magnetic field, separated the oxygen. The fire went out, but the air was filled with electrical sparks. The sparks flew across the way. When I hurried over, although I used the shield to withstand most of the explosion, Kris was still hit by the falling object. I took her to the hospital. Unclear if she's alive or dead, now.
Steve looked at the open door, shook his head. He got out of bed, closed the door. He was tired. He told himself he should get a little sleep before the Avengers' morning meeting, but lay flat on his back with his arms behind his head, he couldn't sleep for a long time. So, he simply dressed, went to the conference room, only to find it empty. It seemed that after yesterday's big fight, no one was going to show up on time today. Then he headed to the simulation training room to find some robots to beat up.
The castle was like a maze, and without the aid of the locator, Tony not only couldn’t find Doom, but also couldn't tell where he was going. He simply gave up searching in vain and went straight on shouting.
Hawkeye swam ashore from the Colorado River, dragging Spider-man, who had been knocked unconscious. He gave him CPR, then half-opened his mask to give him artificial respiration. The guy coughed up water and woke up slowly.
“Thank you for saving me, Tony. I passed out in the middle of the fire. I don't remember anything. I woke up here."
"Trouble you've made of yourself? Is it hard for you to admit that you're not all that different from me?" Eric said sarcastically.
"While you were destroying his old connections, you were making new ones. His trust and attachment to you. You saved him, you stayed with him, you made him feel safe, you helped him build the strength to overcome his fear. So you have to re-enter his life and walk him through those early steps."
Tony felt his body. The armor was still on him. So he felt more at ease. He activated various detection devices in the armor, but nothing was detected. Within the detectable range of the armor, no people, no living things, no known material exists.
"Don't go back yet. Come with me." Kris dragged Tony away without arguing. "Trust me, there are surprises."
The two little bastards were hiding in a side alley. The brown-haired boy was already convulsed with laughter.
"Did you mean me or the former Iron Man?" Tony pointed to his own nose, then leaned forward to search for the air behind Steve. "First of all, I'm sorry to inform you that the former Iron Man has died, Old Tony Stark is dead; and unfortunately, I'm the current Iron Man, and I'm Tony Stark, the only Tony Stark in the world. And the most unfortunate thing is that I cannot fight the so-called 'no-fire war', and I will not apologize for the things I have done right!"
“Well, Mrs. Rogers, this is an accident, no one's fault. He's an alcoholic, he fell, that's all. But you know, we can't call the police, we can't, it would cause a lot of trouble. None of us wished him any further harm. Harold is waiting at the door. He'll help us dispose of the body and clean up the blood. But you must be strong, you must stay in this house, so that suspicion will not arise."
"First time meeting a stubborn old Brooklyn man, aha?" Steve burst out laughing. "Thank you, Wanda, thank you all. I'm fine. No more wait. Now let’s go to a Christmas dinner. I wonder if Jarvis has improved his cooking again this year."
Krats put down the phone, rubbed his forefinger, thumb between his eyebrows. His brain was spinning at high speed. Tony Stark, what are you gonna do?
"Ah!" He exclaimed. The water pressed against his eardrums, filled his eyes. He was so frightened, he fluttered about like hell. Just when he thought he was going to drown, he was pulled out of the water. He breathed in and out.
Doom's question made Tony hesitate. He had not expected Doom to see him in the bedroom, and it made his prearranged guard waver a little. But Tony soon composed himself. He said, steaming his voice.
The rest were a little frightened at the sight, but by sheer force of numbers they gathered round again.
"I'm right behind you. I've been waiting for you. I've been waiting for you for so long. You want to see me, right? You want to see who I am, right? So, could you turn around now? Then you'll see me."
He pulled him along a few blocks to the East River. It's an abandoned pier next to an abandoned warehouse.
"You should tell me when things like this happen." Steve lay on his side looking at Tony, one elbow on his head, and with the other hand he played with the hair on Tony's forehead, which was growing fast over his eyes.
It had been a long time, longer than he had ever had sex with Steve, but Tony still didn't want it to end, just as it had been when they first kissed. He wanted it to stay in his body forever, so that they would never be apart. He wanted to take him away and everything they've been through, but Tony knew he couldn't, so he could only hope that time stops at this moment. But time was not a line. The past, the present and the future mixed together were just now, and he had only now.
The counter punch landed him in the face, and the next hit him in the stomach. He doubled over in pain and coughed violently. He was then kicked in the shin, followed by the back knee. He was kicked to the ground. He heard the laughter of the other children. They crowded around him, and he knew more punches would fall on him. He closed his eyes and let the pain come... But the pain didn't come. A clear, smooth voice rang out.
"Manipulating the press, distorting the truth, playing war of words, and forcing the Avengers to remove me was not a glorified geek tournament, Dr. Doom."
"Thanks, teach. I appreciate you taking your valuable time to help a desk Jockey with his neuroses."
You also realized your mistake, so you want to kill her. First you secretly dazed her, want to let the fire help you solve the problem, caused an accident. And out of all the confusion, Iron Man gets her out first.
"I don't really remember. I don’t actually have this memory of what happened in my brain. But I remember a record of it after I left this space."
Tony suppressed the rush of thought, concentrated on the task at hand. Everyone was counting on him. If things go wrong, he can be a real sinner of breaking up lovers. So he had to shout one more time.
"Jarvis, I screwed up. I really screwed up this time. I...... I...... I had no idea... I was busy acting like a hero... I killed her, I killed her... It's all my fault, I'm a murderer..." The caller repeating this sentence, pounding the wall. "I am a murderer".
The agents of the Zodiac. This is the second time in recent cases that they have been involved. It doesn't seem simple. But Tony still couldn’t find the key clue to all this. He continued to shut his eyes and pretend to be unconscious.
"Believe me, there's no bad news today. It's not very pleasant to be constantly delivering bad news." Tony said.
He took off his bloody clothes, bathed him, dried his body and the water from his hair. He dressed him in some pyjamas, carefully buttoning up every button. Then he carried him to a room full of his paintings. He put him to bed and tucked him in. All the while, Steve never took his eyes off him.
Steve turned his body to Tony, holding Tony's shoulders with his hands, slowly turning Tony's body towards him. Tony was confused, but he didn't resist. He faced Steve.
"Actually, I..." Hawkeye was about to raise his hand again, and this time he met the fierce look of Cap. He put his hand quietly behind his back. “I... I think the wine is good today."
He was trembling with anger. He was angry. He swung his fist as hard as he could at the boy in the cap. He hit the boy, but he didn't pose any threat.
"Hwy cunnan thou secgan se? Wit brothers. alatan me, mine eald freond Tony ne wendan. Is se macie thee earm? I witan se thou faran to Grand Canyon to secan se weg of Hawkeye. Hwy wendan anlice seon thou and Hawkeye?(Why would thou say that? We are brothers. Let me guess, my old friend Tony hasn't turned up yet. Is that making you upset? I had heard that you two went to the Grand Canyon to search for the trail of Hawkeye. Why only see you and Hawkeye return?)"
Libra turned to Tony before leaving and said, "As a thank-you, I'll tell you something. I have looked into multiverse, almost every earth has an Iron Man and a Tony Stark, so I know who you are. And, you, you're the most special of them all, so never ever give up, believe in yourself Tony, believe in yourself..."
His legs were pushed back to his sides against the window, his outer thighs feeling the cold of the ice-covered glass, his inner thighs feeling the warmth of Steve's kiss. His body was gnawing at him with an intolerable tingling, and the heat rolled in his lower abdomen. He wanted more. So he asked him to give more.
"Give me a coffee-milk one, give him a walnut." Tony pointed to Steve, said to the ice cream vendor.
Seeing it seems like yesterday, but I've been living here for nearly a year. And this year, I have changed so much...
"She was just an 'assistant'. I wouldn't have fired her if she knew the word 'personal'. I'm your partner, aren't I? And your best friend. Well, at least one of your best friends. If someone is around your best friend... So..."
"Childish! Ignorant! You think they could fly in the black circle, was that what they did? "Doctor Octopus scoffed.
"You're welcome. I feel sorry for what you've been through these last two days. Do not know which sentence is wrong will ignite the powder keg. He has always looked at me unpleasantly, and I have always avoided him."
"He didn't send it in the first place, ah. He got beaten up and his dream girl just stood by and watched."
"Captain, I am very short of money. I still have a wife and children to raise, unlike you heroes who drink and fight every day and get money."
"You may well say so. When I was a kid, my father hardly ever took me to baseball games. Adult, as he said... Busy to saving the world. And I have one more thing to confess. When I was a kid, I didn't have a bat or gloves. All I could do was watch the neighborhood kids play baseball with envy. Until my eighth birthday, I got my first baseball bat. I joined the street team and played baseball for the first time in my life. But I was really bad at it. They didn't want me anymore. I didn't use that bat a few times, but I kept it. And when I'm an adult..."
"Fix the fire hydrant first. Got it!" Tony sent out a repulsor, welded the hydrant, stopped the water flowing.
"Believe me, that bed has been unused for so long, it is cold." Steve wrapped his arms around the man who was running away. "And I miss you."
Conspiracy and trap or not, Bain gave Tony a night of orgasmic sex. Late in the night, Bain seemed to be asleep. Tony, not at all sleepy, got up naked and went to the large French window. He reached out a hand and laid it against the window, and the cold rushed through it. He was overwhelmed with loneliness and desolation. The more content he got in his body, the deeper the hole in his heart. Tony didn't dare stop himself from thinking about what the feeling meant, so he turned to put on his armor and headed for the mainframe room. He needed the calculation, because he needed evidence, evidence that explained it all. Even if it's an outcome he didn't want to face, an outcome that would send him into the abyss. He quickened his pace.
"Here you are at last! Luckily, Captain got here in time, or I'd still be locked up." Said Spider-Man.
"I don't want to draw undue attention to myself and I don't want you to release my name publicly, as we agreed to do."
The golden mask girl's words had been ringing in Tony's ears ever since he came back from the uninhabited Island. He tried to shake it out of his head.
It's basically a replica of the universe that you came from, but as I told you before you left, it's not exactly the same. There is some paradox in the process of transcription, some space-time turbulence. Simply put, the data is wrong. And it's nascent, fragile, and squeezed by the regional warps caused by collisions and friction with other parallel universes nearby. If we don't fix these errors and resist the pressure now, it will crumble very quickly."
"Trust me, sometimes it's better if you don't answer, just say Avengers’ secret mission." Tony tried to calm down.
Confused by Spider-Man, Clint completely forgot that the Quinjet was actually equipped with parachutes. Even though he didn't want to admit he was right, he jumped after him. The Quinjet crashed into a rock wall.
"I see. You take risks every day. I'm used to them, almost. Tell me what it is. I'll follow you." Steve replied.
"You could have picked so many exteriors, you picked something close to him; of all the names you could have chosen, you chose his name."
"Ah, ah, it's just a bunch of fish guys on California beach, not Galactus attack. They can handle it. Didn't I also provide Spider-Man's information? He could back up. Or could I say, I betrayed his whereabouts.
"Not for nothing." Tony said. "After S.H.I.E.L.D. took him into custody, they confiscated the equipment at his lab, so they still have the samples. I've got the samples back. See."
"Pretty much," Steve chuckled. "Clint, you know, is not a man who likes to keep things to himself. Then it will probably come to light."
"Am I hallucinating? Only three hours ago you saddled me with a terrible secret I didn't want to know."
Tony held on to Steve's hand, sitting astride him, looking down on him. He bent down slowly and gave the old man a gentle kiss. When he wanted to get up, he felt Steve's tongue brush lightly across his lips. A sign of inquiry, so he stepped in again, opened his mouth gently, greeted his inquiry, danced with his tongue, and exchanged eagerness for each other. The kiss grew hot and warm. Without being interrupted, it lasted a long, long time.
"That's not what Stark's tracking system said. The stolen armor designs are in this drawer." Tony stiffened his voice.
"That's a long name. Can I call you Bucky? It's much easier to say this way. By the way, my name is Steven Rogers. You can call me Steve."
"Thanks again. You are really good! I could not see your movements, but they all fell down." He exclaimed.
As Tony shouted, Steve jumped in through the window. The Spymaster frowned; His confidence has gone.
"I don't need Jarvis to tell me. I knew what he was going to say. ‘Don't remember what Anthony Stark did. Remember what Anthony Stark tried to do’"
"The watch he confiscated is also a locator beacon. I have recently added this function. Because the last time I got lost on campus. I was just thinking about what the heck map would be need if it could be connected to satellite direct navigation, so, I updated it."
"Ah, my mask, my identity." The first thing Spider-Man did when he woke up was make sure his mask was still there.
Bain's bed was wide and soft and comfortable. Her body was as soft and comfortable as Tony had imagined. She and his previous women were not the same, not a trace of shyness and coyness, but total indulgence. It unleashed the wild and sensual side of Tony. He can do without scruples and compassion. He got into her with such force. She screamed, and then groaned unrestrained.
"This is a dimension of space outside of all time and space. I am not really here. I am only speaking to you through the Forever Crystal."
“I'm going to tell you something. It rained every day in England, and I couldn't sleep, so I sat by the window..."Tony whispered in Steve's ear, not missing every detail of that night, blowing his own breath and longing into his ear.
"I have a... message for Iron Man. The next time you talk to him... tell him I know he’s innocent. And tell him if he needs anything... ever... I hope he knows... I’ve got his back."
"That's Blacklash. Attack his base. He relies on base flight from air superiority, but every time he attacks launching a whip, the base current will be unstable, so he’ll habitual right, balance of the body. In that interval, you aim at his base, and it's all right for him to fall. And if you don't want to be barbecued on a skewer, don't let his whip through your shield. You will be hit directly by high-voltage currents due to the echo amplification effect of the Vibranium conductor."
"You...... You don't have to be for me... If only I could go back in time, it would all come to an end."
They were taken to the chief's office. The chief lowered the blinds, stepped forward, personally uncuffed Steve and Tony.
Spiderman was swinging his gossamer threads between skyscrapers. He was clearly in a hurry. Next to him was Iron Man, flying at Mach 0.1.
"Fujika's facilities are a bit outdated, and I'm no longer employed by them, and I'm no longer working for the Avengers. Let's just say I'm a single man."
"But once in a while he would come up for a breath and arrest a child who had come into his toy shop by mistake. He is out now, walking up the basement stairs. Flip-flop... And then he reaches out and grabs you from behind..."
"Hey, girl, don't pay any attention to that bastard if you're smart!" Shouted a tall, stout boy with a cap askew.
"It was a boring old people's party at home. I pulled Pete over. The music he played lit the audience."
"So, I have another plan. We drag this unconscious guard in there disguised as you. You follow me into the lab."
"You've basically destroyed the key emotional connections to the old world that he had from his early memories."
Although the tornado had passed, the wind was still around nine. There were no pedestrians in this sparsely populated town. Many houses collapsed. A row of telegraph poles and trees fell.
"That's what I was going to say," Spiddy interposed. "The guy who is jealous of his teammates, abandons teammates, dare to speak up about trust? No wonder you can't get along with West Coast Avengers. Fortunately, you are not the leader of Avengers."
"What's the use of running away? None of us can hide from what is coming." Said Doctor Octopus. "This late November tornado was not a simple event. It should be part of a global phenomenon."
It was well past midnight when Tony installed the last of the device and returned to the Avengers Mansion. The New Year had already begun before he noticed it. With a sigh of relief, he went straight to Steve's room, flung open the door as usual. Whether he was asleep or awake, he would jump on him, kiss him with all his might, and rub his golden hair.
"In fact, the key plot of a Western movie is not counting stars. It is the person who counts the stars with you." Steve pulled Tony over his chest, touching his skin, warming him.
"What is your explanation for why Iron Man is not on the list of the UN Special Peace-keeping Group of Seven or on the reserve list that you have announced?"
There were too many opponents, the armor was confiscated by Steve, the only fighter golden mask girl was down. And he didn't think the self-defense skills Steve had taught him would work against these professional killers. So, he pretended to be in a coma, right into their base to find out who they were. Anyway, the wristwatch is still working. When they let down their guard, he can contact Steve with the watch. Hoping he wasn't too stupid to know how to use it. From time to time, he opened his eyes, secretly remembered signs along the road. At last, they came to a cave.
"When I was a child, my home was so big. Every time I woke up in the middle of the night, I would get lost in the dark. I was afraid, but I could never find my parents."
"Black Widow, this is Iron Man. Cap is taking care of his personal affairs, so don't call him unless Galactus is coming." Tony curtly interrupted, then added, "And Happy New Year, Tasha. Do you remember? It's New Year's Day. Who wants to have a meeting? No one."
It was noon when Tony woke up again. He stretched himself and sat up. A little reluctant to face the minutia of everyday life. Tony clicked on his watch, opened his voicemail. Sure enough, there were hundreds of messages. Tony recently added an automatic filter system that automatically ranks messages by contact, saving him a lot of time. At this point he only selects messages from people with an A or higher level. The message begins in chronological order:
"And if I don't agree? Now that you're calling it my Time Machine, I can lend it at my own discretion."
"To be fair, that person is dead, this one is just him ten years ago. He didn’t betray you." Spider defended Tony.
"Electronic music, video games, racing cars, chasing girls... My hobby, my hobby... It’s... That's all... Youngers' hobbies." Tony was out of breath, but did not forget to argue.
"Cap can't back up. He's in Washington D.C with Iron Man. He suggested we contact Spider-Man to back up." Black Widow cut off contact, said.
They parked in a private place, put on the clothes of ordinary people, mixed with the crowd. At least today they're just Steve and Tony.
"... I used the microwave frequency add to your Vibranium, adjusted the circuit board to the correct frequency, directly removed his whip. He stared. Ha... Ha... "Tony ate three hamburgers, had a spirit, and began to gush.
"I admit I sent Whiplash and Spymaster, but it was a contest between the two of us, a friendly contest between the only two geniuses on earth. But it turned out you were no match for your future self."
"But it can save your life. Fortunately, he gave us the implant before he died, or else we didn't even know how to save you. And he saved you again today, saved us again."
Thor and Steve were indeed looking for Tony. Avengers were out on missions. Although the backup power was running in the mansion, communications were being cut off by a blockade. Thor's powers have been malfunctioning recently. He could neither fly nor break the barrier with his hammer. They needed to rely on technology guys to solve this problem. Tony was the only scientist on the Avengers roster in the black circle now, so they headed for Columbia. They didn't expect that Tony had already traced to meet them halfway. Steve wanted Tony for technical support, not for hand-to-hand combat with a pair of gauntlets.
Tony was a little pleased to see him worrying about him. He resisted the urge to kiss the man in front of him, instead, gave him a big smile.
"I will sneak into The Bain Tower. You're outside for lookout support. Don't you have some kind of high bug sensitivity or something?"
There was no echo, the place beside him was empty. No need to read the message. It must be Avengers Daily. Tony rolled over on his left side again, landed on Steve's accustomed side. With the familiar smell, he continued to close his eyes.
"It's just... You said you didn't live around here. So... Can I ever see you again?” He lowered his head, tangled his fingers, picking at his nails. His stomach turned down again.
Steve began unbuttoning the buttons on Tony's pajamas, two tightly knit rows of extremely difficult buttons.
Everyone was nervous about the captain, but Hulk stopped. A row of arrows had been strung across Hawkeye's bow, pointed at Hulk, ready to shoot.
Tony stared at her enchanting figure. Her white slender thighs, with red high-heeled shoes, stepped on the floor and issued "dada" sounds. Her round hips wrapped in a short skirt swayed gently up and down to the rhythm of her steps. It was obvious that the slow walk was a mild torment as he imagined the landscape beneath her skirt, which made his body agitate. Finally, Bain opened the door to the mainframe room.
"I just took a wild guess." Tony smiled mysteriously. "Well, it's settled. I'll meet you at the door of your dorm tomorrow."
"Well, you know I need money. Wait a minute. If you know what I was supposed to do today, that means you know who I am. It's over, it's over, my secret's out."
The moment Steve entered his body, Tony felt pain, a great pain. Despite all the preparation he had done, mentally and physically, it still hurt. But right now, what he needed more than anything else was pain. The pain reminded him that he was still in the world, that he and he were still alive. The pain could make him feel his presence acutely, feel that he is not far away from him. The pain freed him from the weight that was weighing on his heart. The pain gave him a reason to cry, and Tony cried... He bit his lower lip heavily, but the tears ran down the corners of his eyes and into his ears.
Melony is a beautiful but not enchanting red-haired brown-eyed girl with a few small freckles on her nose. She wore a denim hood, very talkative, had the fervor of a Western girl and a sweet smile.
Tony smiled. "I reckon the ones who have made similar threats in front of us... Ah, your ranking is about... too low to calculate.
"Time is a living organism, which may be likened to a plant. So it needs to take down roots and get enough nutrients to grow and be strong. You need to create that initial environment for it."
"I'm just too busy to talk. The boss behind this guy is trying to keep me busy. If we don't find him, I'll stay busy... Busy, busy, no time to do other things."
While eating, drinking and feeding, Spider instantly felt happy. It’s more important to hold the thigh in front of him, throw away fragile friendship with Tony without much guilt. Eat, shut up, don't defend Tony, better get out of the way.
"I danced with Tony at that party." Wanda said bluntly. "I asked him a question, 'How long can you hold on if someone you love no longer has an emotional connection to you? 'It was really a self-answering question, but Tony answered it anyway, saying,' It won't be long. I'll move on. '"
"Well, since the real Peter is in Portland all this time, the person you know is me. And it's because of me, I keep making rookie superhero mistakes, failed to sense, failed to support teammates, had no survival skills in the wild, and often caught." Said Spider-Man gloomily.
"You won't make a mistake, you'll never make a mistake, or at least you won't make a mistake like mine, a mistake worse than any I've ever made, you won't. You're Mr. Perfect. The perfect captain, the perfect hero... Are you?"
"I'm afraid I don't have time." Peter said, "I'm working at Daily Bugle this weekend. By the way, I remember that the appointment with my tutor is almost up. Sorry, guys, I have to go."
"Perhaps. Everyone says girls have to be protected. I don't think the Black-Red-Woman needs to be protected. She can shoot steel needles out of her wrists. She can protect herself very well. She also has the guts to do things that other girls don't dare do."
"I actually... only lied to you." Steve said, biting hard at Tony's collarbone on the shoulder and neck, leaving a red stain.
Scarlet Witch pressed her fingertips against her temples, focused her Chaos Magic, took control of Serpent Society. Spider-Man next to her threw out silk to bind them. They cooperated well. Soon all the Serpenters were caught.
"Yes! That’s so great!” Steve said in surprise, then he lowered his head again. "Can I go? Tickets are expensive, you know."
Looking back on that day in New York, Tony felt that the Avengers had a much easier victory, as if Zodiac didn't really want to fight. Tony hesitated.
"Is that enough? Or do I have to do more so you'll listen to me?" As Tony softened, Steve's tone resumed the banter of the two of them alone. "Believe me, I've always wanted to do more after you gave me the night that I'll never forget. But you had been avoiding me, and you would rather see Tasha alone than me when you came back."
"It's terrible. Stark's stuff has a high failure rate. What to do? I can't fly! We're dying!" Spider-Man grabs Clint. The autopilot failed, making it even more difficult for him to control the joystick.
"Kris, we gave Elise your previous room, so you'll have to share a bed with her tonight. We didn't have a guest room, so I asked Gatlin to sleep with me. I'm clearing Gatlin's room for both of you. If you don't want to share a bed, one of you will have to sleep in the barn. Trust me, it's not a good idea to sleep in a barn this season." Seth said.
"So... I screwed up, didn't I? Ha, Tony Stark screwed up again, as expected." Tony sank into depression.
"Yep, that is true. But in any case, he can’t even think about manipulating the operation of Avengers as before. I'm staring at him." Clint said fiercely.
"In fact, I did not struggle, his is mine, mine is not his, mine is still mine... How to calculate this account is my profit. And what else do you think of me? You are thinking about taking off my clothes, keeping eyes on me, right?" Tony's flirting joke gently dispelled the sadness Steve had been trying to suppress.
You were flying a knife. I didn't have to duck, because I knew you had an order not to kill Tony Stark. You were trying to poison Kris, but when you found out it was me; You freak out. So, you asked me that question immediately just to make sure I'm not going to die."
"That... Hm... Snowstorms! Yes, it's a blizzard. They need Tony back to help make the weather controller."
"Maybe we have a little time before Tasha comes back." Steve squawked as he buried his head in a kiss on Tony's bare back.
Steve is absolutely violent. Tony thought with a smile. Once in a while one or two woke up, saw him, Tony raised his gauntlets, they fell. Actually, I'm violent too. Tony laughed at himself.
"I wouldn't dare. You know, mother is old and goes to bed early, but she told me repeatedly to get to you. The kids knew you were coming back and tried to stay up, but eventually they fell asleep."
"You know, since I had been in the future, everyone told me about him. Thor said the stain of honor; Hawkeye said he was always a liar. Wasp's tears. Jarvis's sigher. Dr. Pym seemed relieved. It doesn't feel quite the same from you..."
"What do you know, stupid woman, Mr. Kolsky took a fancy to it, and there were bigger men behind him. Just give it to him, then we'll make great friends, be rich and get out of this damn place."
"Tasha, you didn't have to do this, you did a good job, you were a great chief." Steve said with a slight surprise.
"In addition, only the seven members of the Special Operations Group and the seven members of the Reserve Group, which we have formally submitted to the United Nations, can conduct special peacekeeping operations in the territory of the United Nations members state. Unfortunately, Iron Man is not on that list." Tasha said.
"I was going to come back with a compliment, but who knows? I'll never come back. Nice work, Tony. Shooting Hulk made me feel so good." The second, Hawkeye came up, patted Tony on his shoulder.
Krats never paid attention to the time when he was so engrossed in making "toys" that he hated being interrupted. So he did not look up when Jarvis entered.
Steve was happy again. He was lying on the carpet in the toy shop, still holding the shield in his arms. Bucky laid beside him.
"Only shit! Who's going to fist fight when you've got technology at your fingertips? Oh, yes... Like this one."
Gambit was obviously not in the mood to notice the offence in Hawkeye's words at this moment. He spoke with a sorrowful voice.
Steve held Tony in his arms, ran his fingers through Tony's hair, which had grown a little too long to cover his ears. Steve smoothed down his curly hair.
Kris, I really haven't thought about her in a while. Tony added in the memo: "Date Kris, priority 3."
‘You are bored. Looks like building a brain control A.I to meet my various requirements is more convenient. Now, you can go away! ’
Ten minutes later, music, video games and video images kept popping up on the little dial. Steve just couldn't open the map. He finally broke down.
"Bain is a legitimate business. But we've made a lot of enemies over the years. We've always had hostile peers."
The terrified guard pointed to the second hole on the right. Steve knocked him unconscious, dragged him into the shadows.
It's easy. The armor is on my body, the equipment is in my hand. This is the way Tony likes. It feels like everything is under his control. The detector swung harder as Tony approached the target. After a few turns, Tony made his way to the jamming facility. In the middle of the cave was a large silver-shining device. The left of the device was a mainframe, and a man stood next to the input panel. The man was dressed in a pale frock, wearing a mask, which represented the constellation Libra. Tony raised his gauntlets at him.
"You heard it wrong. It is the roar of the train." Peter carefully discerned. His spider sense came online again.
"The source was a wave of energy that preceded the occurrence of the black circle. It can also be said that the black circle was the spatial interleaving caused by the fluctuations it brought. Then I tracked similar energy fluctuations on a global scale, trying to map the points where they appeared, map their coverage, identify the various anomalies, the overlapping areas and time gaps."
The Black Widow jabbed him with her elbow. But it was no wonder Hawkeye’s blunt question. Generally, the representative of the X-Men sent to knock on the door of the Avengers, even if it is not the boss Professor X, after all, he is inconvenient. At least one will be a professor-level figure such as Cyclops, Wolverine, Jean Grey, etc. It would be more fun if they sent over their relatives, the Beast. Gambit is an outsider in the X-Men franchise, and he doesn't know the Avengers very well. If they needed him to come to their door with a message, something big was going to happen to the X-Men.
"I'll tell you one more thing. I'm afraid you'll be disappointed. You've done a very poor job. My armor didn't charge very much. I was lazy in the early hours of the morning, and wanted to go to bed early."
Although they are bad guys, they don't attack for no reason. They always have some reasons, such as taking over the earth, taking revenge on society, dominating mankind, seizing wealth and so on. His reason is really confusing." Steve said.
"Just kidding. It would be a terrible mistake if I drank with you around..." Tony reached out his left hand and touched Steve's right hand as he flew the Jet.
Peter touched her head and said, "It looks like you're the only one who wants to be with me tonight."
From above, he looked down, the flames reached the second floor. Thick smoke blocked Tony's view. He raised his gauntlets, started the air swirl, blowing the smoke.
"My God! Tony, you're working for Avengers, for the greatest heroes in the world. That's amazing!" Kris's eyes lit up with adoration.
"It's pretty much a 24-hour job, and over the years there have been changes in the Avengers' permanent staff, so the emergency response team has been adjusted. The new and potential members will be announced by the current Avengers chairwoman, Black Widow."
"Something has happened to Professor X. The negative feelings that have accumulated over the years in the Professor's mind have merged with Magneto's hatred of humanity, and in the Professor's head a monster has been born, a monster that none of us can stop..." Gambit's face was frightened. He could not speak for a long time.
"She was obviously his first victim. Because it was sent too late, the doctor said the low temperature damaged her brain cells. She is very difficult to wake up in a vegetative state.”
"Who made the superhero circle I know so far, only you and me are similar in age? And after we lived and died together, it is considered a close friend of life."
‘Wait a minute, hear me out. After I researched the crystal management system, I found a way to communicate directly with your brain. After all, turn off the memory interference frequency of the system to transmit back and forth, which is very easy to attract the attention of the Time Keepers. It’s safer.’
Tony had no reason to refuse the warm invitation of such a beautiful girl, and he did not want to, so he followed Kris upstairs to her room.
"It's a big day, founders reunion day. Congratulations, Thor, finding your hammer again." Jane said.
"Hulk hates Archer! Hulk, smash!" Hulk slammed at Onslaught, gradually opening a crack in its shield. More arrows shot at the Hulk. Hulk became angrier, and went into a complete frenzy. At last the shield cracked, sending energy shared flying in all directions, bounced Hulk off. The swirling energy of space-time turbulence twisted upward into the air.
"That's bad news. In other bad news, now, the other Avengers are in California, Wisconsin, Africa, Atlantic. The nearest are on Long Island. The situation of Giant Man and Wasp is a bit tricky, and can't be solved for a while. Black Widow talked to me with a black face, 'If Captain America and Iron Man can't handle a little Popsicle, they could be off the roster. '
"Thank you. Fortunately, you have the habit of holding a bunch of old things, or I really don’t know what to do now."
"So... Is actually... You went AWOL? Are you absent because of me? And I stopped you halfway and made you stay away longer?"
"I'm sorry, Kris, I couldn't do anything. If I were That-Tony... I mean, if I were my cousin, I could help fund the reconstruction of the valley." Tony's heart sank as he heard what Kris had said. He held her hand.
"You fool! Do you all have a pile of rubbish in the Avengers' database? It's his son you need, Franklin."
Tony used his Avenger ID card to plug into the device, and finally made contact with the Avengers outside. Wasp, Giant Man, Quicksilver and Hellcat in Southampton found out that something happened in New York. They are about to arrive.
Paige picked up a model of a woman dressed in black tights and with red hair. She pressed the top button, and the model twirled and leaped, shooting needles from a pair of steel wrists.
"Without a conclusion, I was locked here. Spider-Man broke into my lab, but I'm the one locked up here. It's not fair, is it?"
Tony was walking toward That-Tony’s room. As Steve watched Tony fadeaway, his mind drifted back to many years ago...
“It's nothing, Mrs. Rogers. He's a good companion to James.” Krats handed over the blonde child to Mrs. Rogers.
"Ridiculous! That is the failure of you too, teacher, if your so-called fighting arts can't even beat a few ruffians..."
"Invite him in... Wait a minute, let him in ten minutes and take good care of him. Get me a cup of coffee first, Samantha."
The super serum is so restorative, it won't leave any traces on his body. But Tony didn't need to look in the mirror to know how many traces of himself he had left on his body that would last a long time. The distinction between human and superhuman is unfair. Maybe some science can be done. A local inhibitor is a good idea. Where should I brand it? Maybe it should be in a place that is not easy for others to find. A wicked thought flashed through Tony's mind, he smiled evilly.
Steve had no idea how he had ended up in the East River, on the pier by the abandoned warehouses, where Bucky had taught him how to swim. He forgot how it had all happened. All he knew was that he was dead, that mighty monster, just dead, lying motionless in a pool of blood. He would never hurt anyone again, not his mother, not him. He looked so slight and weak before he died, so fragile and pathetic, his eyes wide open with fear.
As the music began to play, he saw Cap walk up to Tony, take Tony's hand, and walk off the dance floor. Then Peter saw them in a corner, hugging and dancing, whispering to each other, Tony laughing now and then. Before the music was over, Cap took Tony by the hand and slipped away through the door at their side. Peter stared blankly at the empty door for a long time.
"And that is probably all. I transferred Doctor Octopus's commission from Zodiac." Tony lay flat next to Steve, and spoke to the ceiling. " I have to stay in the lab all the time. You know the rest."
"You know very well that men in steel masks always fascinate me." Bain turned and put her arms around the mysterious man behind him. The mystery man pulled off her skirt, carried the naked Bain to a nearby table, and opened her legs.
"If we hadn't attacked your base, foiled your plot, how did the black circle in New York disappear?" Tony said.
"Well, I seem to have misunderstood you." Pretending not to notice, Tony bent his head and quietly typed in the security code.
Steve felt the warmth of Tony's lips against his, felt his hands caressing his chest, caressing his waist, and then his naked body was searing against his. He kissed every inch of his body. His kisses were not as passionate as they used to be. Each kiss was long, warm, and full of love. It was a terrific dream, if it was a dream.
"I've been doing good work lately, and Mr. Krats has given me a little prize. That should be enough to buy tickets for both of us. Besides, I've been in the basement too much lately. I want to get some fresh air."
"Well, I will tell you one more thing. When you enter this space, you will lose all memories of the original time and space. And you're not the only one. Everyone will lose their memories, including myself."
"How do you know? Oh, right, there's no system you can't hack into. But my real identity is not in any system. How on earth do you know that?"
"I'm not stupid. But I'll need to be a little closer to him to test his new gear. You protect me for a few minutes."
"Trust me, not at all." Bain put up her hand and stroked his iron mask. "Like I said, sleeping with a man in a steel mask makes me... makes me... Ah-ah..."
Tony didn't dare raise his head, but he plucked up his courage and said "If any of you are going to use this as an excuse to think the founders voted unfairly, look at Jane and Hank. They vote one for one, too. Personal relationships don't affect my fairness."
After they repaired the Jet, Tony put Peter back in the copilot’s seat, taught him how to start the Jet and operate the control panel.
"It was almost two hours of fighting. I'm starving. I feel like I could eat a row of hamburgers. I've torn down this noshery. Don't go in there. Go to the corner one." Tony picked up Steve and left.
"Then you will say, 'I was the one who made my first armor in a cave’, see, I have heard this story... "Steve can't go on.
"But I am not you." Tony retorted. "You take off your flag suit and you're still a superhuman with super serum, but without armor I'm just a normal human. I could do nothing in the face of flash floods and earthquakes."
"You're so slowing down, Spiddy. I've been thinking of building you a spider-armor to speed you up." Tony complained.
Tony looked up and around. There was no look of surprise on their faces, no look of disgust, as if this were just a daily thing at Avengers Mansion.
"When this is over, I'm going to have a long holiday. The Avengers has been handed back to you two. Chief is a real backbreaking job. You can keep your couple-shop." Tasha smiled at Tony, slid gracefully into the vortex.
Then we can run out together, confront Dad and save Mom. But... I am alone, and I am a thin, twelve-year-old boy.
Just then, two policemen on patrol noticed what was happening. They came running from a distance and pointed their guns at them.
"You are very brave, Kris. Most people would have been scared out of their minds in a situation like this, but you wanted to save Cooper in the first place." Tony said admiringly.
"Jarvis, get my coat and stick ready, and my hat." He said as he slipped out of his protective suit into a shirt hanging nearby and wore his tie in front of the mirror.
Tony slowly opened his eyes. Steve's face zoomed in front of him. The effects of the poison were still on him.
"All right, all right." Tony turned to get his backpack, pushed the button on his chest, and the armor attached to him. He became Iron Man again.
"How wonderful! I thought I was going to rot in jail tonight. You have no idea how glad I am to see you! I owe you one big favor today."
A few of the bead lights on the letter "K" went out, making it look like an "I". A sizzling electric sounded on the rainy night.
"This is an Iron Man puppet?! Are you sure? It looks like a red and yellow swamp frog. You sewed it yourself? Thank you P... Thank you Spider-Man."
As his desire was contained in his lips, Tony's body was consumed by pleasure, the greatest joy he hadn’t experienced for a long time. His reason and logic had abandoned him once again, leaving him to sink and swim in desires, in the arms of this man. His broken moans echoed through the room again, in the stillness of the night.
"Really, again?!" Moaned the brown-haired boy. "I thought the best thing to do at this point was -- run!"
When Spider-Man opened his eyes, he was surrounded by a group of gunmen. Hawkeye was nowhere to be seen...
Then Tony solemnly spoke to the contact on the Jet. "It's nice Cap remembers when time to throw a party. I'm looking forward too, Black Widow."
"You're welcome." Hawkeye glanced at him. "I don't want to know who you are, as long as you don't hold me back."
All the fire emergency passages had been soldered to death. The crowd trapped by the fire had to escape through the front door. The kids, who had been half drunk and half awakened awake. Someone had fallen, and the one behind had stepped on the one in front. The fire didn't look like an accident. Someone started it on purpose. But now Tony had no time to catch the arsonist. Saving lives comes first. He swooped down, broke the welded-down emergency fire exits. The crowd of trapped people streaming out of the new passages.
"All right. But you'll hang on a little longer. I promise you I won't delay this time. I'll be worried if I leave you with this villain for too long. I have a theory... Should be able to quickly solve him."
"Here we are again, Iron Man. You can walk right through the front door. I won't turn you away." Bain said with a chuckle.
Tony is not much of an art lover; art to him is just a stream of consciousness. Tony is more pragmatic. He believes in measurement. He believes in what the evidence said rather than what was imagined. But Kris loves art, and it's easy for Tony to figure out what she likes from her profile. Tony always knows how to make a girl happy.
"No wonder I've been running into you lately, Stark blew in his ears. No offense, but after what happened today, I think you're pretty good. It's just that the thought of that guy setting it up makes me mad. His older version dominated the Avengers for many years. Three Big Head, Thor won't be on Earth for a long time. Nominally a co-founder vote, Wasp and Pym were busy with their own small home, were not permanent staff at all. Steve was the longtime leader of the Avengers; He was an associate. They were interchanging sometimes, actually running the ‘Couple Shop’. As long as he blew in his ears, Steve would probably agree with him. In the end, the Avengers became his private armed team, didn’t we? For his kind of rich man at the top of the world, the Avengers are just a way of showing off his wealth, his charity, and some of his kind heart to ordinary people like us. I'm not surprised by all the bad things he did, because he wasn't such a good guy. Treachery, full of lies, he had them all."
"If we can access communication devices, we should be able to use their network to contact the outside Avengers." Tony said.
Really transforming to this, rather than a hard hologram, is a small compensation for the brain being directly connected to Libra once in a while. The night is long. It's so far into the '30s that it's finally time to go have some fun. The famous Hellfire Club. That-Tony was a regular. I'd love to see it in the '30s.
"Think twice, give me a hand." Steve said with a smile. "But there's no gadget in my sleeve that can open this door easily."
"So that the Avengers can exist, and you will be able to continue to be the perfect leader loved by all?!"
"How big a threat are these disasters, and will they eventually cause the destruction of the planet?"
"I think I made only one mistake today," Tony said stiffly. "My armor wasn't smart enough. If my armor can’t only detect the attack position of these simulated combat devices, but also automatically counterattack; If it can calculate your possible attack mode through the analysis of your past battle data; If I use my mind to control my armor directly, instead of controlling it by voice, it will be thousands of times faster than now. I don’t need to do it myself and you have been defeated by my armor. So, I don’t need your cookie-cutter simulation training course, or rely on the so-called ‘subconscious body actions’. I just need to create a smarter armor system.
The crowd on the ground floor was a mess. The flames and smoke were drifting up to the second floor. Tony's head began to clear a little. He realized what had happened. By the way, where is my backpack? He had too much drink yesterday, and they had poured him a few more bottles just now. He had forgotten all about the backpack. Where is the backpack? Right, he left the backpack in the car. Sure enough, I am a rookie superhero, and once again forgot to take my armor with me. I have to find my backpack, put on my armor where no one is looking.
Tony grabbed Victor's outstretched hand and jumped to the half-pace. The moment he hit the platform, he felt the feeling go out of his feet. He staggered and fell forward. Victor reached out to catch him and took him in his arms.
That's interesting. Maybe Peter found an opening. Tony added in the memo: Contact Spider-Man, priority 4.
"Thank you, Steve." Paige gave Steve a hug. “Can I come and help you in the shop every day? It will be much faster if we do it together."
"It's going to be hard for Spider-Man to team up with Hawkeye. His tongue is a powder keg. Has Spider-Man offended Tasha lately?"
"Since I came here by your time machine, I can only find you and return as I was." Tony put stress on the words "as I was".
"It's just some conjecture, there is no reasonable explanation and sufficient evidence for these anomalies. So, I want you to let me go. I need time to find out. And you Avengers have been too busy lately to care about these little things."
"It's really unfortunate. So I took your data and talked to Franklin's father. Since you've been harassing his son, I'm sure he has information."
Tony passed a video store. There were black-and-white televisions and tube radios, but no customers, and a clerk was dozing. Tony rummaged through his trousers pockets and counted the money. Not enough... If you sent me to fend for myself in 1930, you should have given me some start-up money at least. Well, I'll pay for them when I get some money. I'm just going to borrow them. Tony comforted himself. The store was robbed that night, and the alarm never went off.
Through the glass Sunset Bain saw the Iron Man hovering outside the window on the 77th floor. She reached for her hair, stood up slowly, walked slowly past, gently pushed open the window, high heels on the carpet did not make a sound.
"Steve, no, not yet. There's so much grief now, it's getting out of hand. Don't drag me into the picture. So don't say anything mushy, you know I hate crying goodbyes."
"If you like, I can give it to you." He tried to sound calm, but his stomach was churning nervously.
"You are not him." Doom was no longer addressing Tony. He muttered, head down. His words over and over again.
Tony looked wistfully at Steve. I shouldn't have thought those things at that moment, I shouldn't have brought them to bed, but now... Tony put on his clothes, picked up his backpack as he spoke.
"Well, they want to stay and help, they want to, but the mission in New York desperately needs their help..." There was sweat underneath Peter's mask.
Tony strode past the fallen Electro toward Steve. He walked over to Steve, took off his helmet. The spray instantly wet his hair.
Although the tornado has passed, but the wind is still around the nine. There are no pedestrians in this sparsely populated town. Many houses collapsed. A row of telegraph poles and trees fell.
"Well, thanks to the bad weather in the UK, otherwise I wouldn't have had the patience to read the fine print of all the Avengers codes and understand the ‘hidden rules’." said Tony sarcastically. "I always thought saving lives was the first job of an Avenger. Apparently, the one who repeatedly told me the 'first task' and signed these agreements had a better explanation than I did. What do you think, Cap?" Tony put an emphasis on the word "Cap".
"Oh my God, give me a break. Why am I teaming up with that weird guy whose mouth doesn't sit idle for a minute? His brain circuits are not human." Hawkeye beside Widow protested. "Is that Cap's advice?"
He was shivering in the closet. He was pulling his knees toward his chest, he was burying his head between them, he was crouching his feet toward his hips...
"Well, you are fast asleep now, like a harmless little angel. But I can't sleep yet, and I need to deal with all the problems you've caused. I’ll write it down in my note, and get it back from you someday." He said to Steve, who was asleep.
Moonlight reflected off the snow through the window into the room. Tony's words paused as he gazed into Steve's dark-blue eyes. The rest of his words were buried by Steve's kiss. After a long kiss...
I can't make money in this form. Of course, without the support of the forever crystal system, completely changing my form is a bit difficult at the moment, but it's possible to make a deceptive hard hologram. I still need some materials... Wherever I can get them in 1930...
"The detection device I have is relatively simple. Preliminary diagnosis, the black circle is some kind of force field, which forms a barrier to block New York City, sends out certain frequency interference to disable electronic communication in this area. But look, where do these Zodiac agents come from?" Tony pointed to the carrier airship which was hovering overhead. "This airship is working, proving that their power sources were undisturbedIt. They can freely go in and out of the lockdown area, constantly sending their agents in."
“Well, this small toy, please turn over to him after he wakes up." Krats gave the shield to Mrs. Rogers.
Tony lifted the gauntlets, raised a shield. The shield counteracted most of the current, but it also got punched through.
I have an S+ contact? I even didn't know that. It seems that I still need to tweak this new system. Tony plays the message.
Tony hit an infrared hotline, smashed a big hockey puck above Steve's head that he just avoided.  The debris dissipated. Tony used the sonar shield to redirect them. A pile of debris hit Steve 's face directly.
"It's a long story." Said Tony, rolling over to the bed. "You know, Spider-Man is a very talkative, illogical, emotional, paranoid and superpowers unstable teammate. Next time the founder votes, I'll be rooting for him to stay on the Avengers backup roster."
"Ah!" He was so frightened that he let out a cry. He fluttered wildly and knocked the spider off his neck. He knocked over a row of shelves and the models on the shelves fell to the ground. The models stood up and moved toward him. He just screamed out of the shop. He splashed the water outside the door and disturbed the neon reflection in the water. The neon sign said:
As he looked out into the light of New York City, Tony felt lonely. Five months ago, Steve broke into his home with the Avengers, disrupting his quiet life. He was so desperate to follow him into this strange world. He had never given much thought to what the departure would mean to him. He had lost almost everything, his parents, his friends, his old life, everything he knew. The reason for leaving, Tony told himself, was to avenge his parents. But with Kang's failure and the death of his future self, the original reason has already ceased to exist.
"Or if you don't want to go, we could do something else." Bain's hands around Iron Man's neck didn't let him go. With her leaning back, Tony can see the arc of her breast. He leaned forward to pursue the temptation.
"As you like." Said Tony, shaking Peter by the shoulder and smiling. "There's one more thing, I hope you'll forgive me."
"Now it is the right time. It's good to have so many people. As soon as possible, no excuses, no delays. "Tony replied.
"So, I hope you will forgive me when I suddenly leave or lose touch with you because of these duties." Tony said.
These so-called American heroes have reached out to "rescue" Britain... And we can't help but ask where our homegrown heroes have gone. Captain Britain, once an example of our hero, has disappeared...
"Actually, Tony walked in, lit the mansion on fire," said Peter defiantly. "His family love him, don't they?”
Steve handed the postcard back to the policeman. He was tickled to see what Steve had written, took his hand, tears in his eyes.
"I think there has been some misunderstanding. They are good people. I was saved by one of them. I was saved by Iron Man." Kris said.
"Speak of the devil, there he is. The party is interesting now." Hellcat got up, put down the plate, and started to walk to him.
The attack on the Zodiac happened three days ago. It was a sunny day. Tony held a map, walking on the campus of Columbia University. He may be a genius engineer who can build a machine with a glance at a schematic, but he also has no sense of direction. He circled around the campus but couldn't find the way to the registration center. When he finally found it, the popular professor's science class was already full. He had to go next door to professor Elden, whom the old birds called "Western Witch." When the queue reached him, he was scared stiff by the professor in front of him. This professor, known as Western Witch, is Meredith McCall. She was his girlfriend from MIT before his time-travel. Tony gave up his MIT studies now because he is afraid of meeting people he knew. He couldn't explain why he would continue to take MIT classes 10 years later and still look the same as 10 years ago. However, nobody can predict, the past still finds him. No wonder the ebullient blonde became a "Witch". She was dumped by Tony for no reason, married a cryonics scientist, had an unhappy marriage, and finally divorced. She still uses her ex-husband's last name. Tony didn’t pay attention until it was too late. Tony didn't believe that he would not be recognized when he walked in front of her. He didn't know whether he should be fortunate, but the power was cut off at this time, and the entire campus fell into darkness. It should be said that the entire New York City fell into darkness.
Steve was alerted by Giant Man's cries. He ignored the operation panel, rushed to catch Tony's body as it fell in front of him. Not so long ago, the same Tony, 10 years later, had just died in his arms latterly, if this one... Fear thrilled him with the cold in the dark dimension.
When Wanda heard this, disappointment came into her eyes. Steve was perceptive, so he put aside the idea of visiting the World War II memorial in Washington, D.C., and said, "I don't have anything in particular in mind. Tea, painting and a quiet day is a vacation for me."
"Well, fine. I'm locked up in a Doctor Octopus lab with Spiderman, and the Golden Mask girl is next to me. She's still in a coma, and we're all fine for now. The bad news is we've been poisoned by Dr. Octopus. The good news is I'm immune to poison, and Dr. Octopus is not on base."
The Young Genius Iron Man came on stage, raised one gauntlet which popped out a small box inside, and shot it straight at Steve.
After the handsome brunet kissed the handsome blonde captain in public, Hellcat was very depressed all night. She said to the golden-mask girl next to her: "Why are all the handsome men gay now? Didn't you say he is a playboy?"
“Look out!" Steve was quick to take Tony, rolled over to the side of the street, ducked behind a car, and then rolled out of the car into a nearby alley. His movements were masterful.
"It can be remedied, that's great!" Tony heaved a sigh of relief. "What should I send him now to make it up to him?”
Tony was sitting on a bench in the corner out of the SICU, elbows on his knees, hands on his head, fingers deep in his hair. His arm was covered with blood, and the wound turned up, with fragments of glass in it. The nurses passed by, repeatedly reminded him to deal with it. But Tony, overwhelmed with remorse and fear, refused to listen. And that's exactly what Steve saw when he walked in.
"Peter, don't cry." Tony stroked Peter's head. "Have I displeased you? Or do you blame me for not letting you fly?"
Tony connected the satellite, located the track of the signal, and where it finally disappeared was Baintronics. It was clear that the high level of encryption and frequency interference at Baintronics Headquarters made transmissions impossible.
Peter, watching Seth leave, breathed a sigh of relief. He returned to the farm, opened the Yellow pages, grabbed the phone on the wall, prepared to alert neighboring farms. Because of the earthquake, the telephone lines were down. Peter had to pick up the local map next to him. The nearest village is two kilometers away. He took the map into his arms and rushed out of the farm, preparing to launch spider silk and swing over. He looked around and saw that there were no tall buildings for him to climb, not even a few big trees. Of course, this is the highlands. Peter remembered the tragedy... He pulled back the silk sadly and ran in the rain to the next farm as fast as he could. It's horrible to be in a place without tall buildings. I still fit in as a neighbor in New York... The drenched Peter thought.
"I hope you won't make me regret my decision today." Said Tony, lifting his gauntlets, knocking the rock out of the hole.
But Steve's voice just dropped... A flickering whip, caught in the wind, came down from the sky and fell straight in their direction.
The smile in Steve's eyes was widening. He might have been trying not to laugh. Tony knew he had been fooled.
"These happened, so... However, I have decided to take off my armor, resign my position as the Avengers, leave the Avengers Mansion, leave all your sight forever... Maybe I should go back to MIT, to California, or anywhere..."
"I don't think the security protocols are problems, but you need to tell me where the lab is." Tony said.
"Thanks to Iron Man and Spiderman, all peace, the village is rebuilding now, although we got the government relocation allowance subsidy, but half of the families couldn't afford reconstruction. Before this happened, they had already fallen behind on a lot of bank loans. This happened after they could only sell their farms, and went to cities to make a living. They were all families who had lived there for generations, and many of them were friends I'd grown up with. Too many tears of parting... You knew, it made me want to run away, so I came back." Kris lowered her head and stirred her drink with a straw. A tear fell in front of her glass.
It's only three months in the future. I've already been in jail twice. And this time I'm innocent. The more Tony thought, the more depressed he became. Steve, next to him, kept a smile on his face. Don't know why he can laugh now.
"There was no time. And you know he followed me, but you don't say a word. Have I been trusted in this team?" Tony said.
"I like it now. I found boxing is a good way to vent." Tony swung his fist into Steve's face again and landed another blank.
Tony felt a violent shuddering of the man he was hugging. And then Tony's bleeding arm was pinned down against the wall above his head. The blood, mixed with hot water, slid over his body, and over Steve's body, landing at their feet, pink on the bathroom floor. The force of the push also knocked Tony's bare back against the cold bathroom wall. The sting of the cold made him feel the heat of Steve's kiss even more keenly. His heavy breathing was drowned by the sound of running water, but it was close enough for Tony to feel the irregular heaving of his chest. Tony curled up his mouth.
"During Christmas, earthquakes and mudslides occurred in the Yorkshire Dales. The Avengers authorized Iron Man and Spider-Man to carry out rescue operations in the Yorkshire Dales after receiving requests from local people for help. This event was not just a natural disaster, like the recent snowstorms in 32 U.S. states, but a mysterious anomaly that threatens the safety of the planet. So in accordance with the Avengers Charter for Safe Peacekeeping signed by the United Nations, we took urgent action to protect the safety of the local population."
"He was kind enough to take care of me when he didn't see you." Spider-man softened his tone a little as he remembered that Hawkeye had saved him and made food. "I think he was mostly upset with the older version of you. They might have had some old grudges."
The data lined up in a way he had never thought of before. Oh, it can be like this. Looks like I'm not that talented. Tony thought sadly. But he soon concentrated, rewriting the formula and coding in new permutations. Tony had entered the new formula and code into the mainframe just before midnight, and now he just had to wait for the result of the calculation.
The Golden Knight had put away his armor; He is just Tony Stark longing for the man in front of him. Tony pulled up Steve's uniform, stroked the hard muscles sticking out of his waist. Then, following the line of muscles all the way up, he uncovered his clothes, fondled broad back muscles.
He pulled a chair to one side of the bed and sat down on it. He rested his elbows on his knees and folded his hands under his chin. Steve shook his head again. He pushed the covers off him, pulled his arms.
"I will carry you back. The average speed of my armor is 490.028 times that of your motorbike. Aren't you hush to go back?" Tony picks up Steve, heads for the Avengers mansion. Steve was still thinking about his motorbike on air.
"Boys, I think you are just too laid-back to get into a street fight on the National Mall." With a magnetic female voice, Black Widow stepped out of the shadows. "I should consider giving you both more assignments."
"Anyone here?” He cried out. He pushed his way through the shelves to the counter, where he found no one there. He decided to grab anything and run out. He reached for the shelves... A spider about a foot in diameter landed directly on his shoulder from the ceiling. It crawled over him, spitting silk, and the stiff hairs of the spider's belly scraped his neck.
"I don't think it's likely to get clean." Bucky looked down at his shirt. "How about we dye it red, and then we dye yours blue?"
Tony doesn't know much about art. For him, this exhibition is just a gray-and-white image of naked men, drugs, and sex, an exaggeration of reality. At least it's not the same kind of art as Steve's wall of paintings. But he immediately shook the pictures and the name out of his mind, listened intently to Kris. Tony knows when to listen, when to interrupt. The art room was quiet. They were whispering to each other. The smell of orange blossom perfume from Kris's body touched Tony's heart.
"Guys, can I have a word?" Spiderman raised his hand again. "It's me. 'The Avengers sent us to backup' was an excuse I made up to hide my identity. I made up the story that Doctor Strange sent us there, which obviously wasn't a good story, and Tony didn't..."
When Tony saw her appearance, he gave a whistle and jumped down the car. He gave the flowers to Kris, kissed her gently on her cheek.
"I’m not going to tell him to hit it. You know, he's Hulk, he's uncontrollable. So I'm just going to let him do it and make sure he's in the right position to do his maximum force." Tony replied as he worked on the monitor. "Now, Hawkeye!”
Just then Jane walked in, wearing a low-cut black and yellow evening gown of her own design, her hair pulled up high to make her look radiant. She walked straight to the table where Tony was.
"I'll help you." Spider-man helped Steve move the rubble, while Hawkeye stood motionless behind them.
"It's not like that at all. He created this universe out of subconscious protection of his parents. I just mentally told him that his parents were in danger. He did the rest himself. This pocket universe isn't just a pocket, it's a real universe. If we break it apart from external intervention, it would cause the collision of two universes and the destruction of two universes, that one and our one. So it has to be someone in the pocket who has to find their own escape."
"Hulk, listen to me. We are all counting on you. The world is counting on you. You want to be a hero today, right? Do what a hero does, fight with your teammates. Otherwise, all your efforts, all our efforts, will be in vain."
"How is it possible? I have been in this place for less than a month. Few people know the armor pilot has been changed. I'm just a transfer student in NY, 19 years old with a simple background. Has he been away from Earth lately? The message has been a bit sluggish. He doesn't know that Tony Stark is dead."
Ha, a minor inconvenience since the end of the Great Depression. Damn the '30s. If it is modern, I’ll fly away in my armor. I really miss my armor. I'm dying to build one. If I just lock it in the basement, it shouldn't cause too much trouble. Tony thought.
Everything went according to plan. The invisible armor eluded their monitors and infrared scanning systems. On the 65th floor, Tony found the mainframe, plugged into his armor system, hacked it in, skipped the Jocasta project, the Detroit Steele, the Pegasus... He found Stark's designs. Delete, simple. Wait a minute, there's a source, on the 77th floor. They have a backup. Tony could only go on to the 77th floor.
"Mine froend, Steve, thou feallan se bet, thou sculan drenc mara. Mine friendas, und alles war irgendwann neulich, Jarvis, folgap mara win.(My friend, Steve, you lost the bet, you should drink more. My friends, it's like the old days again. Jarvis, another round.)"
"Steve, I have an idea now, but it's a risky idea. The success rate is about 50 percent or less." Tony said.
Tony stared at the card, wishing his eyes could shoot a flame and burn out the card. Damn ‘superhero daily’. Tony thought angrily.
"Wow, Thor. Is this a treasure from Asgard? What?! You bought it at the shop next to the children's hospital? Okay... That's good, too."
While they were talking, Electro had connected to nearby power lines, recharging himself once again. Electric lights hit them one by one. They dodged confusedly. All repulsors Tony fired back were absorbed by Electro. Tony had to stop.
Steve threw his arms around Bucky's neck before he could finish his sentence. He made such a big move that the closet door burst open. They tumbled to the floor.
"The good news is that your spider sense worked really well and there were real blizzards in 32 states across the US. The Avengers are seriously undermanned and we need to get back immediately."
Two blocks down the road, Krats remembered the naggings of Libra and said to Harold, "Well, I've changed my mind. Let's go find a random nightclub in Manhattan."
"I'll fly out and have a look. Fortunately, although the electronic guidance system is offline, the armor power system is still available, I have to polit manually."
"An apology? Why apologize? Apologize for saving someone's life? Absolutely not." Kris's eyes widened at this.
"Hope this can help you." Peter put a data disk in Tony's hand. "I've checked the Avengers database, and there's no record of anything like that. How about you?"
"But I think we'd better get out of here before Tasha and others come back and catch us. I thought you wanted to see the World War II memorial in D.C.? Since today is to make up your last vacation."
Tony shrugged and replied, "I've accepted the fact that I'm not him. It's no use being hard on myself. I can't solve problems his way, so I'll have to use mine. But no matter what, the sun will rise tomorrow and life will go on. Tony Stark's life goes on, Iron Man's life goes on. At least I'm trying to keep them both going."
"In this way, he’d better become 'him' earlier, so that Avengers funds can be restored. Otherwise, it will be closed."
"Maybe at first, but he can do a lot of things. What can I do? Stark Enterprises was acquired but I could do nothing. I didn't know what to do with the high-tech criminals. I was a second-tier on Avenger missions. Even if I built an armor, it was not enough energy to be invisible. I have to walk on the streets in armor in the middle of the night.
Tony successfully broke through the perimeter defense system of the Bain Tower. He stretched out a finger of the gauntlet, gently cut an entrance on the 62nd floor glass of the building, and slipped in. He called out the main structure of the Bain Tower via satellite. Based on the configuration settings, he estimated that their mainframe was between 60 and 70 floors. He decided to go in first. If he could locate the frequency signal of the designs internally, he would be able to find their mainframe.
When Tony's kiss aroused Steve's desire, Steve habitually reached out and hugged him, trying to roll him over and caress him. But Tony put Steve's hands to the sides of his head.
“She has recently gone from being a 'wasp' to a 'butterfly' for unknown reasons. Since that, it's been a long time since Tasha didn’t let her go on an official mission. It seems that no one can be sent this time. Congratulations! Accompanying me to the third-line search and rescue team. You actually want to go to Florida, do you? According to footprints analysis, Hulk is most likely to be there."
"Master Rogers, you are here too. I just brought tea to your room, you were not in. Would you like me to bring it here?"
“Wasp and Giant man are still on their way, so we can have a meeting as soon as they arrive." Steve said.
What caught my attention was the remark she made when she woke up. She said, 'It's not Iron Man's fault. He didn't start the fire. 'Kris fainted in the fire, woke up in the hospital. The first reaction of most people would be that it was an accidental fire. How could she blurt out that it was arson? So, she must have sensed something. That was a knee-jerk reaction.
The so-called Avengers’ Charter and various signed legal agreements were written by Tony for outsiders, for the government, for the media. Avengers themselves, whoever is in charge, have the same result, are favoritism. It is impossible to be part of Avengers without knowing the word 'private'.
I can't believe it. He didn't let me carry armor. It is really unreasonable. Tony recalled the circumstances of his departure this morning.
"Tony is only 19. They can start over. But I am no longer the innocent girl who only had you in the eyes when I married you. Those scars, I cannot forget, don’t want to forget. Cherish the moment Hank, Cherish the present."
"I confess, I was glad to let you play around. I haven't felt happiness like this for a long time, you know, since he... Well, if someone is going to take the blame for this, it's on both of us.
"For those years, why don't you understand?" Tasha interrupted the Hawkeye. "The Avenger hasn’t been weighed on the scales since the day of its foundation. If it weren't for favoritism, would you be here? Would I be here? Would Wanda and Quicksilver be here?
Long or short kisses continued between them. In the intervals between these kisses, the conversation continued.
The door was not wide enough, and Bain was standing in the doorway. The Iron Man squeezed sideways, the armor sweeping Bain's breasts. It was not a personal touch, but Tony seemed to feel the softness of them.
"Tasha was giving everyone a day off, I was staying on duty. When your call came, I rushed out without thinking... Kris was out of danger, your side was stable, I must hurry back."
He couldn't believe how lucky he had been today, escaped the whip. Perhaps because it was his birthday, God had blessed him and spared him from punishment. He made a birthday wish today, a secret birthday wish... He ran back to his room, grabbed his slate, paints, and brushes, and rushed out the door. He hoped it was not too late...
"Hey! Silly ice face, do you think you can become a god by deranging a few genetic codes? I don't believe in false gods. In other words, I don't believe in any of the gods! Why don't you try this!"
"I think so." When the guards had gone, Tony opened his eyes and sat up. As expected, it was Spiderman.
"Tony Stark's security protocols were not supposed to be easy to break, and you definitely didn't hold him off long enough. And don't you forget, he wouldn't be here at all if I hadn't instigated the media to put pressure on him." Said the mysterious man. "Voluntary devotement? Hum... Don't you enjoy this initiative?"
"On behalf of the Avengers, I would like to make the following statement in response to recent questions raised in the UK media about the rescue operation in the Yorkshire Dales..."Steve said.
In Steve's hand touching the armor, Tony launched the booster device on the gauntlets, turned, held Steve; At the same time, a repulsor fired off Steve’s shield; His gauntlets pressed his wrist, put on either side of his head. The whole action took only one second.
“The size and weight are just right, my calculation is completely correct. I just need to slide it down to replace the original one. It won't set off the alarm.”
“I'm so sorry, Sir. There is a traffic accident ahead. At a crossroad, a construction truck and a food truck collided, scattering bricks and cans all over the ground. The crowd was looting. There are people everywhere. We can't get around them."
"The black dimensional circle in New York; the ocean tidal fluctuations caused by the subtle changes in the force field between the moon and the earth; The magnetic field chaos in the Grand Canyon...These unusual natural phenomena have been popping up intermittently around the world recently, many of them are very inconspicuous, difficult to detect."
"It doesn't matter. Just call me ‘Steve’ when you're not on task. Call 'Old Man' in private is fine. After all, I was born in the 1920s. He used to call me 'Old Man'.”
"Actually, you know..." Tony wanted to say that he didn't like baseball at all. As a teenager, he preferred to stay in the lab, not the playground. He had never bought a baseball shirt to watch a baseball game. But for some reason, he couldn't... He didn't want to disturb the memory of the man in front of him. So, he said:
"I think our mainframe should be able to hack into the Columbia database." Tony hurriedly operated the computer, and said as no one was watching.
"There are an infinite number of living ones in universes, and each living one has an infinite number of possibilities for its choices at any given moment, but there are not that many parallel universes. Creating a parallel universe requires enough cosmic energy to converge at a point in time. In that way, a new branch may be able to generate at this point. And the one who gathers this energy must have a very strong will, a very strong obsession at that point in time, to be able to resist the original timeline of that universe, so that the energy can gather and engender a parallel universe. In short, your obsession created it."
"I have some theories, but they are all guesses. These events are very fragmented, maybe some just happen to happen, maybe some are related." Tony said.
The brown-haired boy leapt up from the water, grabbed him by the ankles and pulled him straight under.
Hitting him at that time was the biggest mistake I ever made, which cost me my best friend once again."
"My baby fell to the ground because of the emergency brake. He hit his head and is still unconscious... God help him, he's only three years old." A blond-haired woman was crying as she sat next to her son in the hospital bed.
Meet with investor Mr. Leonard, to discuss the development of Starktron, at 3 o'clock yesterday afternoon. Delete directly.
She walked to the wine cabinet, pulled out a bottle of red wine in a swaying posture. Her hips twisted in the skirted curve, rose high as she bent down to fetch the wine. By the moonlight Tony could see the curve of her inner thigh under a short skirt. The sight made Tony's throat dry. He swallowed saliva involuntarily.
“What's the big secret?" It took Tony 30 seconds to realize. "You mean that. I didn't really want it to be a secret at all, at least not on the level of 'who I am'. It just happened, and I let it happen."
"Thanks, Wanda. This ornament net is very... gypsy style. Uh? This is a dream catcher. Well, I could definitely have a good dream looking at it..."
Before Tony could finish his sentence, Spymaster was hurling a flying knife at Tony. Tony didn't get out of the way, but the knife stuck close to Tony's face, headed for the backpack behind him. The moment the knife touched the backpack, it sprayed a flame, pushed the backpack directly into the corner.
But by this time Tony was in front of him, this time attacking his stomach. Steve dodged the attack with a back flip.
"Scientists are all crazy. We are essentially the same kind of person, always alone, always looking for one another. I'll erase your memory, but I'll let you be yourself. I'll let you choose. None of this means anything if you're not who you are, if you're not who Tony Stark is."
Tony lay lazily and contentedly on Steve's chest, tracing the lines of his chest muscles with his fingers. Then he bit it hard, a shallow impression soon disappeared.
"I have a present for you." Tony handed Peter a backpack. "On your back, just push the button on your chest. I was gonna wait until your birthday, or something special, but I thought what the hell, today's a special day. It's only 1.0..."
It was past midnight and the lobby of the New York Police Department was still crowded, and officers were busy.
A middle-aged woman at the table next to Tony watched the TV and wiped her eyes. "Haven't these Avengers thugs done enough in New York?" She mumbled. "God, how many more have to get hurt before you punish them?"
Tony walked up to Steve, stood on his toes, put his hands around Steve’s neck, closed his eyes, and kissed him hard. This was a very long kiss. Tony was a little reluctant to let go. What he had just said, and what he had done, had taken almost all his courage. He was a little afraid to let go at one moment, afraid of what was going to happen next, afraid of what other people would look at him.
"Iron Man, are you here to die? Your shell is the best conductor. I’ll make you into an electric skewer. Ha-ha." Electro roared with laughter.
Tony was afraid. The future was completely unknown. For the first time as a 'future man', Tony was filled with a sense of powerlessness about the future. He tried to hold on to all the memories of Steve, but the memory gradually disappeared with the red, blue and white figure in the time vortex. In the end, only one name remained. Tony mumbled the name before he lost all consciousness.
"Ahem... Not because of you, not because you begged me pitifully, not at all. It was only because Kris woke up. She reminded me that Iron Man was just there saved so many people got out of danger. I think it's better for me to continue him to exist."
"That's convenient. If only saving the planet is that simple every time, that would be wonderful. Let's get this over with, I want to go back and eat another piece of my cake. By the way, who am I delivering a baseball bat to?"
"I see. You take risks every day. I'm almost used to them. Tell me what it is. I'll follow you." Steve replied.
"That's great! I think I can use my university lab to do some research. Chemistry is my forte." Said Peter happily.
"Don't worry. This will not be a farewell. I know no matter how far or how long we are apart, you'll find me. If you can't find me, I'll find you."
In a few minutes, Tony became a little boy of seven or eight, with brown hair and eyes, in a half-sleeved striped shirt, black short overalls and sandals.
When Tony stopped, he felt that Steve's wrist was still pressed by him, but he had no intention of letting go. This position gave him a sense of psychological superiority, a sense of control. It was a good thing he had not given up his armor, or he would never have been able to beat him and keep him down like this. So, he took advantage of this posture, and began to ask.
"Ah, ah, dead, dead, level 131... You've come at a bad time. Ever since I've had that dump thing in my heart, I've been like a prisoner, spending hours every day recharging my implant, doing nothing but playing video games."
"I actually didn't do anything about that party, mainly because of Tony." Said Peter, who was sitting next to Melony.
"Guessing and being told the truth are two different things, okay? I was never prepared to take on the responsibility of keeping such a big secret. In comparison, selling your own ‘criminal’ photos to the one who frames you in order to pay tuition and bills is really just a piece of cake. But as the old saying goes, 'With great power comes great responsibility'."
"If I remember correctly, this is an area where all the electronics are disabled by interference. So..." Said Spider-Man.
"Only his armor, can't see his face, unlike the others." Tony looked closer. "But you injected expression into these armor paintings, as if they have thoughts, as if he and his armor are all one."
"My friend Peter is also very good at music. He saved a completely hopeless party last time as a DJ." Tony took the opportunity to promote Peter.
"I really don't know who I am. They said that one of Peter Parker and I was the original Pete Parker, and the other was a clone of Pete Parker. But Mary Jane chose him. I had to choose another name for myself, Ben Reilly. Recently, MJ got pregnant. Peter wanted to live a normal life, so he and MJ moved to Portland. He gave me the Spider-Man title. I'd love to experience your bad growth, but I can't. I'm just a clone, right?"
"Which day?" Tony said slowly, not really knowing what he had asked, but just following Steve’s words.
"Someone's broken through the outer defenses!" Almost all the guards of the cavern were running towards the opening.
Too bad, Aha? Last time I nearly killed Meredith. This time the victim was Kris. How many such mistakes I made before I can recognize the fact that I am not him at all, and I will never be him. Because I am far behind him, I'm not a hero. I simply don't deserve Iron Man, don't deserve the Avengers. I am just a dazed, confused, conceit, arrogance, selfish bastard!"
"How can that be? Not every day, though. But if we have to wait a year every time, I will be on Hawkeye’s Stoic list again."
"No more of those little toys he built to help you in the simulation room this time. You couldn’t beat my new upgraded armor with the same old tactics."
"But he and I are decades apart. He is so out of time. His room looks like a 1940s barrack. He is also very stubborn, and refused me to modernize it in any way. You know what? His bed made my back stiff." Tony complained.
When Tony arrives, Steve is in the middle of a fight with Electro. His shield is struck by Electro's light, and the electric current from Vibranium is directed through Steve's body, causing him to tremble.
‘Reverse? Not at the moment. I need to look into it. You can buy your own ice cream if you want it.’
Tony lifted the gauntlets, raised a shield. The shield counteracts most of the current, but it also gets punched through.
"What about X-Men? What happened to them now? And he... How's Magneto?" Wanda chimed in anxiously. She has the mutation and has never joined the X-Men, but she still considers them a kinship. She was worried about Beast, and she was even more worried about her father, whose name she would not name.
"When we went to the baseball game, he wore a shirt. He said when he was a teenager, he wore it. Until I saw him in it, I thought nostalgia was for an old man like me. He was always updating his stuff. I was always laughed at by him, 'the man out of time' clinging to old stuff."
"I'll try." Said Tony over his shoulder. "Could you tell me the address? Since we are all in a hurry."
Tony got it done easily last time, teaming up with Iron Man is more reliable. But as a newcomer, he doesn’t have a say right. Spider thought sadly.
Steve could feel the tension in Tony as he lay on the bed with his head on his side, the stiffness in his back. So he took his hands, which lay on either side of his head, and clasped them with his fingers and squeezed them. He kissed all the way down from his neck, feeling his body gradually relax under his passionate kisses. Tony gasped softly... Then Steve split his buttock petals and entered his body.
