Steve's smile borders on flirtatious and Tony's really not sure what to do about that.  Steve's sitting close enough that their arms are touching and it warms Tony all over.
Nanna gives Steve’s elbow a squeeze as they pass her in the kitchen.  Bucky and Clint are both still hard at work at the table and don’t even bother to look up from their keyboards.
“Did you end it?” Howard asks.
“It was his idea,” Steve says. “Whatever you wrote meant a lot to him.”
“Natasha told me you’d dated,” Steve says.  “Would you mind if I ask what happened?  Unless it’s too personal...”
“Me?” she asks in surprise.  “If I’m dreaming, don’t wake me up, sugar.”
“Did you know?” Tony demands through gritted teeth.
, which was very nearly there in their friendship anyway.
about it,” James says, with a little bit of accusation and some humor. “Go ahead. Touch me however. But make it obvious where it’s gonna be so I don’t get jumpy.”
“Ummm, I’m pretty sure that you being into guys is something I’d have heard before.”
Natasha’s got the gun out of Sam’s hand before Sam has time to protest. She fires once, hitting James expertly in the shoulder. The beeps steady back out and the neural alarms silence.
“Well don’t let him hear you say it,” James says. “He doesn’t need help gettin’ into trouble.”
Nanna looks surprised as she shakes her head in protest.  “No, dear.  Howard never spoke ill of you to me.  When he talked about you as a child, he often remarked that he saw potential in you that would allow you to surpass his own achievements.  Maybe there was a hint of jealousy there, but also pride.”
They have to press close as they make their way toward the door between all the people crowded into the small dining area. Tony’s whole body feels warm from the physical contact with Steve and that is
“It’s not trouble,” Natasha says, without turning around. “If you’re going to date Steve we’re part of the package.”
Even Tony, who’s never been big on carrying traditional weapons, is holding a paintball assault rifle that would send whole armies running.  He’s got a paintball gauntlet, too, attached to his hand.  And that’s before he pulls out a series of large gun parts that he has to assemble on the spot.
Steve’s never seen Tony so flustered.  So gobsmacked.  So... eerily quiet.
Tony lifts the mug and takes a cautious sip, checking the heat.
“You’ve got to eat up,” Clint prompts.  “The record’s four platters, and tonight, we’re going for five.”
Which is... puzzling. Bruce must look confused because James sighs.
“Is that a gun in your pocket or do you really like woodsheds?”
“And all for one,” Sam and Bucky say in unison, piling onto Clint and Steve.
Tony had never seen so many victory GIFS. Or eggplant emojis. Clint has infinite amounts of creativity stored up for just this sort of occasion.
Bruce taps at his screen and brings up the scan they’d taken in the chalet to compare it to the shoulder scan they’d taken on the quinjet.  There is literally no difference he can see.
It feels even more like love.
“For a billionaire I could put up with a few scars and a nightlight,” one of the hosts says.
Steve takes his own step back, out of Tony’s space.  A waitress walks toward their table and Steve raises a hand to give her a small, friendly wave away.
A groan interrupts them. It’s Clint.
“Then what’s wrong?” Tony asks. “Why do you sound like someone pissed on your puppy?”
Steve looks torn, even as they open the doors of the van.  “There’s not enough cover on the roads,” he says decisively.  “And the van is an obvious target. We’re going to need to move into the woods on foot.  Lose them there.  Then we can call Nat for a pick up.”
Everything is fine right up until a few mornings later when it occurs to Tony that Steve touches everyone but him.  Not in a way Tony thinks is meant to inspire jealousy (although it does.)  Just in an ‘I’m Steve Rogers and these are my friends and I’m a tactile person’ sort of way.  Tony can’t even blame Steve for how miserable it makes him (watching the security feeds up in his office) because Steve is doing exactly what Tony asked him to do.  Distance between them is what’s good for the company.  And no matter how much Tony hates it, it was the right move.
“I can walk,” James says sounding unconcerned.
“We don’t doubt he’s sincere,” Natasha adds.
“Tony,” Steve says quietly.  “I’m going to walk around the bed, now.”
“Show me what you’ve got.”
“Yes, you are,” Steve agrees. “Why are you enjoying this exactly?”
“Bad. Ass,” Clint says, lifting it and admiring it with the sort of adoration generally reserved for a firstborn child.
“You can’t know that.  You haven’t seen--”
“You can touch my leg to assess my knee,” James says abruptly. “Tell me before you do.”
“I’ve got his body. His body doesn’t like you bein’ so cavalier with yours.”
“That’s what we figured.”
He’s just not sure he wants to.
“Think I can close my eyes then,” James says drowsily. “Stark or Steve... don’t want them near me til I’m awake… but they can be in the house. Will you tell him that? I’ll see Steve. Get to know him maybe...”
“Yeah, we’re buying this,” Tony agrees.  “J, track down the artist.  Make them a generous offer on my behalf.”
“To answer your question, no.  We haven’t tried an invitation,” Steve says slowly.  Tony can see the strategy wheels turning.
to let stories go.
“That’s it,” Bruce says. “Notice any difference, James?”
Tony’s voice is cut off as the elevator doors close in Steve's face.  He’s been dismissed.  Which is fine.  It prevents Steve from saying anything else embarrassing or stupid.
“Story time,” Clint declares.  “The first time I met Steve I’d just spent the better part of a day trying to kill him.”
“But you want me, right?” Steve asks.
Tony pushes away from the jet and makes for the ramp, but Steve stops him with a hand to his arm.
Natasha smiles. “Couldn’t leave you losers alone for too long. There’s no telling what kind of trouble you could get into. And speaking of trouble, where’s Bruce?”
Clint puts down his coffee and starts blindly patting around behind his computer before pulling out a sheet of copy paper.  There’s a neatly typed list there that’s nearly unreadable because of all the  furiously scribbled out words and notes and addendums.  Tony is absolutely sure this is not at all the kind of thing Clint should be showing him.  HR would be in tears.
July is hot here,
For Steve, it’s got to be a nightmare come to life.
James doesn’t verbally acknowledge the offer. Instead he meets Clint’s eyes, looks terribly unimpressed by their efforts to comfort him, then stomps into the house. The door to his bedroom slams a few seconds later. Clint and Bruce follow him inside and Bruce flops onto the couch before pulling a throw pillow over his face to just hold it there.
“You like him,” Pepper says.
“It’s habit to cover for him by now,” Pepper says.  “It’s easier than...”
“Functional,” James says, noncommittally.
Steve’s the Captain of the other team, and Tony’s his first pick. Tony beams at him as he joins his side, and Sam makes loud gagging noises. Which gets him picked by Bucky. Clint goes to Tony’s team and that’s it. Three on three.
into you,” Clint insists.
Steve doesn’t want to fight and by now he knows that if he pushes, Tony can push back harder.  So he decides to just ignore the request.  To focus on moving forward.  “Do you still have clothes here?”
DO NOT SHOW TO NANNA OR PEPPER FOR THE LOVE OF GOD
“Great.  Can’t believe I’m suggesting this, but I don’t want to have to wait for Happy to get here and...” Tony taps on his phone a few times.  “There’s a QuickCar just down the block.”
“Lucky me you’re so polite,” Steve says.
Bruce pulls out his phone. He dials Steve’s number and hopes to god he answers it so Bruce doesn’t have to leave the most awkward voicemail ever. Steve picks up on the first ring.
“I don’t want to deal with doctors,” he says.  “Unless Bruce is around?”
“Thank you,” Tony says, with real gratitude.  He can't hide that he’s a little shaken up by the conversation.  He’s just not sure if he’s more shaken up by Obie trying to sabotage his safety, or by having two strangers protect him for years, without his knowledge.
He’d have never guessed Tony’s nonsense rambling could be considered comforting, but in a way, it is.  Now that he’s gotten to know Tony, he knows it’s not a lack of professionalism, or a demand for attention or a worldview that sees trauma as one big joke.
“I asked because... I guess, I wanted you to know I’ve been treated like my body isn’t mine more times than I can count. Sometimes I’m still not even sure it is, if I’m being honest. So when I keep asking you questions, and keep confirming that we’re good here... that’s a lot of my own issues surfacing. I’m sorry about that. I’m kind of a disaster.”
“On art,” Steve says.
“Okay.  So he’s getting sex.  What are his partners getting out of it?” Steve asks.  “If Shayla’s telling the truth, the sex isn’t anything to write home about.”
Tony nods.  “You gonna stick around the tower today?”
“Does Steve know he’s with you?” Tony asks.
“There’s nothing naive about the way I feel about you.  I’ve been watching you use relationships to self-destruct for years now and I know how things ended between you and Pepper.  I’m still here.  I’m still willing to try.”
“Fuck Shayla,” Steve growls. “She wanted her 15 minutes of fame and she got it. I never believed one word of her bullshit.”
“Pulled them from a train station locker,” Natasha says.  “It’s not a language I recognize.”
“Clint!” Natasha screams into the comms.
“I’m really proud of you,” Steve whispers into Tony’s ear. He pulls back enough so Tony can see him. “Am I making the stupid face again?”
James looks at Bruce like he’s batshit crazy.  It would be almost comical if it wasn't kind of sad.
“Sorry-- sorry,” Clint apologizes. “I should not be laughing at someone with your estimated kill count. It’s just you sound like pretty much every other person ever who’s been out on a mission with Steve.”
“I want that,” Tony says. “I want all of that.”
He steps around Tony and enters the house.
Steve trails off and bites his bottom lip. Tony’s face lights up like a kid in a candy store.
A few hours have passed since the conversation about Pepper.  Tony’d welcomed Steve back thoroughly, they’d showered, and now they’ve ventured out to the kitchen, half-dressed.
Explanations, Egg McMuffins and a major misunderstanding.
Tony’s boyfriend is called Sean and he’s a personal trainer to the rich and famous.  Sean is tall and blonde and muscular, and Steve doesn’t fail to notice they could be cousins, as far as looks go.  He hopes that’s where the similarities end because Sean’s an ass.  Steve
“God, who even let you near the internet?” Tony asks, unable to keep the smile off his face.
“Don’t really sleep much anymore, anyway,” Steve says.
“And Bruce. Someone needs to make sure he’s okay.”
“Twenty bucks says the hidey hole came from Fury,” Steve replied. “The knife was Barton’s idea, and the kitchen sink is gonna come in handy. You’ll see.”
It’s a shocking thing to hear.  Tony would have given his right arm to be friends with someone like Steve in High School.  To have not been the thirteen year old prodigy to whom no one would give the time of day.  To have been invited into a room like this to laugh, and flip through dirty magazines and... do whatever it is normal high-schoolers do in bedrooms.  Tony isn’t even sure what that is.
He lets go of Tony enough to pull back and get a better look at him.
it doesn’t seem like much.
There's silence. Steve's gotten lost in his own thoughts and Tony can see how a trunk isn't a great place for that to happen.
Bruce hangs up the call and turns his attention back to James.
“Dunno,” Tony says, pauses, then adds.  “Have you seen Back to the Future?”
“I thought the world’s best cheeseburger was our first date,” Steve says.
The water turns off.  Tony peeks his head out a moment later.  His eyes are tired and there are traces of red in them.  He doesn’t look happy to see Steve.  He looks miserable.
“If we wait for her to finish, we’re not going to eat until dinner. She’ll find us when she’s hungry.”
Tony nods. “Sorry about the freak out.”
“You as the poor factory worker with a secret child.  Me as the wealthy foreman.”
thinks those interviews don’t get to him...”
“No,” Steve insists.  “It’s him.  And if you stay with him and he hits you again I’m going to rip off his arm and beat him with it.  I mean it.  It’ll give a whole new meaning to the phrase ‘stop hitting yourself’.”
“Is it everything you wanted?” Steve asks.
“No monkey business up there!” Bucky shouts from below.  “Not while we’re busy savin’ Stark’s ass down here!”
“Without looking, can you tell me how many fingers I have on your hand?” Bruce asks.
“Yeah, I do too,” Tony says.  He looks beat.  “Was gonna keep the Loki-impression in the floor but Bruce went and got all sulky about it so I had the whole place cleaned up.  Want a smoothie?”
“He’s my boyfriend.  He has every right,” Tony says.
James nods once.
“You think I’d put Iron-Eggsy in a nest prototype?” Tony asks.  “I’ve given myself enough concussions from suit testing to know better.  I'd have to be egg-stremely irresponsible to risk it.”
Steve shakes his head.  “I have not,” he says.  “I saw a link, but I don’t believe just because you’re a celebrity you don’t have a right to privacy.”
a sentimental longing or wistful affection for the past, typically for a period or place with happy personal associations.
“Except for the part where I didn’t know you were around,” Bruce points out.
“No,” Tony says immediately.  He’s not letting an 80 year old woman risk her life for him.  He’s surprised when the rest of the table seems to be considering it.
Tony chuckles at the enthusiastic introduction and the last of his stress gives way.  Clint hadn’t pointed when he’d said the names, so Tony’s still not sure who is who, but they look friendly enough.
?" Tony growls.
I got the impression they believed Sir had told you of their departure from the fundraiser. He is in his workshop now. Would you like me to patch a call through to him for clarification?
Tony and James meet in person for the first time.
“Are we done here?” Tony asks, glancing up at Steve with all the petulance and irritation of the young teen he was when he’d written the damn thing.  He even crosses his arms.
“Do the scan,” James says. “Get it over with.”
James closes his eyes and lets his head fall back against the cushions. “Do what you want. I don’t fuckin’ care.”
They’re as confused as Steve is.  Steve hasn’t heard anything about Reno. (Now that he’s ditched the Morning Shows, he’s perpetually behind on gossip.)  He’s definitely not noticed any panic attacks, though he’ll be watching for them now.
Steve hadn't realized they were serious.  He’d met the woman only once, and that was more than two months ago.  She’d seemed nice.  Smart.  Pretty.  And now she’s leaving bruises.
“I won’t really braid your hair,” Bruce assures him, in case that’s what has James worried. “We were being ridiculous. I didn’t mean to make you feel uncomfortable.”
“Your knee doesn’t feel like it’s healing?” Bruce asks.
“The last time I saw Barton in person, it was because he got himself banned from SoupSoupSoup for abusing the All You Can Drink Soda Machine, and he dropped by the tower to ask if I could buy the place and re-institute his soup privileges.”
Tony leads Steve through the house to the game room, where he has a whole wall of classic hockey memorabilia. His collection rivals what’s displayed in the Hockey Hall of Fame, only Tony’s is better, because almost everything is signed to him. He’d started collecting back when he was a kid and his dad was the best hockey player America had ever seen. And now Barnes’s puck is going front and center.
“Raised a loser,” Tony says. “I made the best shot I could, dad.”
“I take it this game is between more people than just the two of you?” Tony asks.
“If I thought for a second that Operation Shake and Wake would work, it'd be the new Plan A,” Tony says consolingly.
Which causes Bruce to groan and practically trip over himself in his hurry to apologize and assure James that isn’t what he means. Which gets the first real laugh out of James for the afternoon.
“Want some coffee?” Steve asks.
Whenever Tony would walk by he’d catch them chatting softly over coffee, or passing an old, beat-up folder back and forth, or circling locations on digital maps.  Sam and Natasha could even draw a smile out of Steve on occasion.  A smile that would disappear the instant they were out of the room.  When they were gone, Steve was glued to his laptop and all he did was frown.
“It was the second underground network Nanna founded,” Steve says proudly.  “Her first was in France, during World War 2.  She was fifteen.”
“We’re here,” Clint yells back, as they rumble to a stop.
(See the end of the chapter for
of them home.”
Bruce holds up his hand, makes sure James sees it, and then slowly lowers it to James’s leg. “How many fingers do you feel?”
2 Eggs Down - 5 To Go
“Triple that for Stane,” Natasha tosses in.
“How long has it been?” Bruce asks
Bruce puts down the baton and James stares at it like he’s trying to see through it. Or set it on fire with his thoughts. It’s hard to tell.
“Just wait for the magic soup,” Steve says.
“You didn’t make me sign anything,” Steve says as he’s closing the pizza box.
Pepper hugs Tony tightly and they whisper a few things quietly to each other.
“Oh!  And take off your pants.  Nanna doesn’t like pants,” Clint adds, too enthusiastic to keep his cool anymore.
Bruce is 100 percent certain that if he texts Tony with a few parameters, he’ll have them a place before Bruce can finish packing his things. He’s usually shy about accepting Tony’s generosity, but desperate times, and all that.
“What did you do really?” Steve asks, once he’s pressed against Tony’s side. “Why are they all so sorry?”
Tony doesn’t have a quick reply for that one. Instead he just looks sort of stumped. He lowers his eyes to look back at the menu, and Mae leans down so he’ll have to pay attention to her.
“Yeah, well. Better late than never.”
“Jarvis, go ahead and bring their devices back from the stone age. They’ve learned their lesson.”
Bucky smacks Clint upside the head as he walks past him. “No chirpin' Stevie.”
“That depends,” Steve says.
“May I make another inquiry then?  Since we are friends.”
“Then come as my date. A bro date,” Tony says.
He’d taken every ounce of his anger at Howard and he’d put it into his game. Scored three goals. The whole arena was electrified. Tony’d never felt so fucking alone.
Tony walks back out to the hall, and then down to where he hear voices and smells something that might be appealing if his stomach can figure out what it plans to do with itself. The hall opens to a combined living room/dining room/kitchen/laundry/study area. Or well-- there’s a stove, fridge, and sink, plus a laundry line and ironing board, a dining table, two desks, a couch and several chairs. Tony’s not sure there’s a name for this kind of room. It’s big, so it isn’t cramped. Just... cozily multifunctional.
“There’s something we’ve been wanting to tell you,” Pepper says, once they’re seated in front of waffles.
“Was it Shania Twain?” Tony asks.
When Nanna nods Tony continues on, introducing himself in polite, fluent French, explaining about the trunk and then thanking her for her hospitality and willingness to take him in.  Clint mouths
“You don’t owe him anything. You don’t owe me anything. So when I put this out here-- take it or leave it,” Bruce says, wanting to be extremely careful about applying any pressure at all. “Even though you aren’t Bucky Barnes, that doesn’t leave you as a no one. I’ve enjoyed meeting you. I think you seem interesting and I hope I get to know you better before you decide to leave. Steve might like that, too. He’s a good guy.”
There’s a muffled voice speaking to Steve, then the phone is shuffled around and Natasha’s on the line without introduction.
“Better than Uber,” Steve says, as they all pile in. the doors slide shut behind them.
“If you’ve got a problem with me having a boyfriend, you need to get the stick out of your ass, Capsicle,” Tony announces.  “This is the twenty-first century.  Deal with it.”
Bucky and Clint nod simultaneously.
him into the trunk or anything.  I asked nicely.  Said please and everything.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Clint turns a little in the seat so Bruce has any easier time inspecting him.  He’s careful with his touch, and Clint manages to keep himself perfectly still.
It feels true. The rest of breakfast is full of laughter and stories Steve has never heard about some of Tony and Rhodey’s more off the record exploits. Steve hasn’t laughed this hard since the night Dum Dum Dugan got so drunk he shit in his own boot, forgot about it, and then put it on the next morning. Good times.
Tony tilts his head like he doubts Steve’s sincere.  When he decides that Steve is, he places the mug down on the table, turns his hand over, palm up, and holds it out insistently.  Steve sits down next to Tony on the bench and takes his hand. He’s careful to be gentle as he presses down and begins to knead.  It’s impossible to resist smoothing his thumb over a few of Tony’s  callouses, but otherwise Steve keeps it professional.
Bruce winces, but he gets what James is doing.  Provoking the threat out of Tony rather than wait around and have a threat surprise him.  Bruce has been known to do the same thing-- the first time he met Natasha comes to mind.
“Oh.  Right.  Yeah, obviously,” Tony snarks.  “Can’t have Captain America looking up gay porn.  The world might end.  The rivers will run with blood.  All the kittens will die.”
“I’ve got a couple of thoughts,” Tony says.  “One, we sneak down the hall and steal the queen bed that Nat reserved for herself.”
Tony’s not used to people taking care of him. At least not people who aren’t employed for that specific purpose. Tony complies, mostly out of confusion. Either Natasha is very convincing, or his headache is very bad. He’ll figure that out later.
“Side project. Mostly Bruce’s. Redefining food as we know it. Just eat the damn thing. If you’re going to mope around the tower indefinitely you can at least make yourself useful.”
“I more meant your name,” Bruce points out. “Do you have a name?”
“He’s got eighty-six biographies in print,” the soldier says. His focus is entirely on his food as he takes small bite after small bite.
Bruce’s smile brightens. “That depends on how you feel about relocating Manhattan to the moon. Me? I’m not a fan.”
“We offer amnesty,” Tony says.
Steve has to avert his eyes when he notices the sort of gray-purple of the flacid ham in Tony’s sandwich.  He pushes his own McMuffin to the center of the table.
“It’s food,” Steve says blankly. “I don’t know what else you want me to say. It tastes like food.”
He leans back against his pillows, apparently satisfied now that he’s called Steve out.
I like to write poems,
James wakes up at Clint's Secret Farm, and the gang is all now on the same continent. It's about time.
Mae leaves with a smile on her face.
Bruce nods, even if he’s not entirely sure Clint’s assessment is accurate. It’s valid to Clint, and James seems to feel comforted, so Bruce isn’t going to provide further clarification.
He can try and drain off some of the blood. Maybe it will help. Maybe it will kill James. Maybe. Maybe. Fucking maybe. He doesn’t know.
“Wouldn’t need to figure out how they work,” Tony says.  “I had a hand in the original project.  They’re based on my designs.”
“My condolences,” Steve says with a smile.
The front door opens about 15 minutes later, and Kate and Bruce walk in together.
“Good. Then you can sit down and rest,” Bruce says, before correcting himself to make it less of an order. “If you want to sit, that is. It might be good for you? There are some frozen vegetables here that we can use for an ice pack.”
Tony could have guessed that when he sees Nanna and Kate follow in behind them.
“Hey-- excuse me, sir, you can’t just--” a young man says in the background.  Tony walks in further, no doubt to smooth things over, and Steve struggles to take in a breath deep enough to make words work.
“They seemed lonely. I hope you don’t mind?”
She may have won, but she was also oozing paint.
ass,” Clint laughs.  “Big difference!”
“We renamed it after all those things Stark said about you boys,” Mae consoles. “It’s just a C3 for now. Coffee, Cookies and Cream. It can’t hurt you.”
“He’s kidding-- about the interrupting,” Bruce tries to help, since James is eyeing the wall with a peculiar stare. Though it only takes Bruce a second to realize James isn’t looking at Tony at all.
Tony looks at Pepper like she’s grown an extra head.  “One form?” he asks.
Tony runs a hand through his hair to brush it away from his forehead. “I’m not ashamed,” Tony says. “Howard just thinks it would be better for my game to avoid distractions.”
It turns out, Tony doesn’t have the market cornered on jealousy. When Steve accompanies Tony and Bruce to a science talk at one of the nearby universities, he finds out just how miserable it can feel.
Clint smiles brightly. “Just a guess, but I think he heard you."
“I don’t deserve you,” Tony says helplessly.
“You’re hurt,” Steve says.  “Who did this?”
“It’s good to have you back, Sir.”
.  My ask box is always open.
“Clint means well,” Tony says, looking up from his work for the first time since he’s been on screen. “I’m hit or miss. J, move me to the big screen?”
“Will it hurt?” James asks.
“That’s helpful,” Bruce says.  “When you say that it’s uncomfortable, could you talk more about that? Actually, can I put you on hold for a second?”
Bruce quirks a small smile.  He really should have seen that coming.
“Yeah,” Tony says. Reaching up to nudge Dum-E’s claw away.  “I kind of do.”
“What. The. Fuck,” Clint whispers.
“So what’s the deal with you and Stark?” Clint demands, as soon as Mae is out of hearing distance. All his best charm used up apparently.
“Wait.  You’ve used The Google?  Captain America has googled me?”
Bruce is lost in these thoughts when the neural alarms on James begin to chime. This time there will be no ICER bullets to stall the inevitable. For better or worse, Bruce will let James wake and stay awake.
Tony reaches to Steve’s McMuffin and picks it up and places it next to the few bites left of his own, possessively.
Tony grabs a plain bagel and a little plastic container of plain cream cheese.  Steve pulls several bagels from the pile closer to himself.
“Can you not call me that?” Steve asks.  “Cap is fine but Captain America... I’d just rather you not.”
This time they don’t move any further than the bed.
“It’s similar to what they might do in a hospital, but the formula Tony keeps in the Quinjet is years ahead of what’s out on the market. It lets us use a smaller needle and a thinner tube. Your body can start using it right away, and you shouldn’t feel any discomfort other than the initial insertion. The risk for complications is low,” Bruce explains.
“Are these movie quotes?” Steve turns to Natasha to ask.
Steve doesn’t miss the challenge in Tony’s voice.  It’s obvious Tony doesn’t expect he’ll stay.  Won’t want his company.  And why wouldn’t that be his expectation?  If his own father couldn’t bother with him, Steve reasons, why would Tony ever think
“They are now, sir,” Jarvis supplies.
James looks up from his hands and lets out a breath, like he’s exhaling his confusion. “Guess it makes sense, what with neither of you havin’ one lick of sense.”
“A worthy goal for your day, Captain.”
“Really?” Bruce asks Clint with a smile. “Because the last time I checked it feels like there are plenty of you. Tony’s got to count for 10, minimum.”
and important, unlike so many of Tony’s dates how consider Jarvis creepy or a bother.
“He isn’t what I expected,” Steve starts.  “He’s Bucky-- but he’s not. He cares but he doesn’t. He told me I need to see a shrink.”
The thing is, once you know Tony’s tells, it’s easy to see when you say something that upsets him.  Everything about Tony’s face goes to a look Steve used to think of as ‘rich kid wise ass.’  Except since that talk with Pepper about Shayla’s interview, Steve’s known better.  What he used to interpret as bravado or contempt, he now knows is more often than not, Tony’s way of hiding hurt feelings.
“You and me,” Steve confirms.  “Always.  I think as long as we--”
Steve knows the day will come. He just doesn’t know how long it’s going to take.
Steve starts to talk to give Tony a solid distraction, first about himself as a kid, and then the story stretches on to his teen years.  The bullying, the fighting, the never staying down.  Steve talks about Bucky and missing him.  About the first time he saw boobs.  When it moves to the war, Steve avoids his own triggers.  He talks about how much better grapes tasted off the vine in Italy, and about learning to steal cars.  Basically anything that comes to mind until finally Tony relaxes against his arm.  It’s maybe 30 or 40 minutes later.
To drive home the point, he rests a hand on Tony’s hip.  It’s a tentative sort of touch and Tony leans into it with absolutely no shame.  “You seem awfully sure where this is going.”
“Should be easy-peasy,” Tony says. “But yeah-- J, drop the picture, but keep the audio feed up. Banner can let me know when he needs my genius input and--”
“I didn’t open it at first, because I didn’t want to know how little he thinks of me. What he was going to offer me to buy back my friendship,” Bruce says. “He’s smart. He’s got to know a few million aimed at a medical clinic somewhere poor would do the trick. I’d resent him, sure, but I’d fake a few smiles if it really helped people, right? It’s not like I’ve got enough friends to turn him down, and he’s got you and Pepper and Rhodey so I only half need to matter.”
They’ve got Jenny in the game and Sam’s a better trainer than a player, but it’s still a rough game. Jenny’s got pads and a low center of gravity so she gets in some body checks that make all the guys cheer.
“Anyone who can make my Steven look happy again is worth the whole world to me.”
The sex noises and accompanying jerk-off gesture make Steve snort a loud laugh and then choke on his iced tea as it goes down the wrong pipe.  “No!  No, I have never thought that and now I’m never going to be able to unthink it.  Thank you.”
“I’m not worried,” Steve says. “But aren’t you? I mean… if you’re seen with me, people are going to talk.”
“I bet you say that to all the boys,” Tony quips.
“I didn’t communicate that well,” Bruce says in the gentlest voice he can manage. “That was my bad. I’m not angry with you. If anything, I’m annoyed with myself for not being more careful.”
“You know Bucky and Bruce,” Clint starts, once they’re all within talking distance.  “And this is Nat, Sam, Kate and Steve,” Clint introduces.  “Guys-- this is Tony freaking Stark.”
“Was this... I mean was this what you hoped would happen?” Steve asks.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’m sure you do,” Steve consoles.
There are milkshakes and more fries and burgers than Steve can count.  And when the meal is over, there are kisses and hugs and more congratulations.
He takes a few more deep breaths and the other guy grudgingly pulls back and away.
“Bathroom. Hall. Dying,” Steve mumbles.
“Sure, why not?” Tony says abruptly.  “JARVIS, reschedule the jet and warn Bruce we’ve got company.  Naked science time is over.”
“Not a lock that’s going to keep those two out.  They’ll be up here any minute and Clint will bring popcorn and say he’s gonna watch.  They might even jump in bed with us because they’re idiots like that.  We’ve got to go help.”
“Hi. America,” Steve starts. “And maybe the world? It’s me, Steve Rogers.”
“If I was Bucky, what would you say to me?” James asks.  “M’not him so don’t get your hopes up.  But if I was?”
Steve rolls his eyes.  “I don’t know why I hang out with you.”
The woman huffs indignantly and stomps away.
Hey, is Tony okay? Sober?
“I don’t know,” Jonathan says irritably.  “I don’t have set plans.”
“What’s that face for?” Steve asks.
Either party may end their relationship at any time without workplace retaliation.
James looks conflicted and annoyed. “I’m
He heads up the stairs and Steve dutifully follows like Tony knew he would.  He leads Steve down the hall to the room they’ll be sharing, and just as Tony expected when Steve steps inside he can’t help but laugh.
“Fine, fine,” Bucky drawls.  “Come on, Clint.  Let’s do what Stevie says.”
James moves deliberately around the table.  He pulls out three small pieces of tech from the third box and places them off to the side.  He picks up the instructions and takes a few steps back to read them.  He keeps an eye on the room like he expects something to jump up and attack him.
“I will,” Steve confirms.
“Well, you could try,” Steve smirks.
“Dad, can you stop being embarrassing for, like, three minutes?” Jenny asks.
“It’s fine,” Tony says, though he’d really like if this conversation was a thing that could happen.
“Yes, sir.”  Tony knows better than to personify JARVIS too much and still he can’t help but think his AI sounds relieved.
“It’s a bet.”
“Right?” Tony prompts.
“Should have,” Tony says quietly.  “Unless Pepper threw them out.”
“So a haircut is out, I think,” Bruce says.
Steve carefully takes the egg out of the pocket of his jacket, where it has been nestled in a handkerchief all day.  He holds it upside down and they can all see Pepper’s signature.  It’s legit.
“The first suggestion is that you sit with your right hand resting on your knee for a few minutes. You have a lot of practicing identifying areas of malfunction; I’m not as sure that you have practice noticing the...” Bruce lets out a sigh of his own, because again-- this is where Tony starts tossing words in. “Noticing the nuances of pain,” Bruce continues. “And your hand on your knee may guide your brain to a tangible place of focus. Maybe. Or I might be talking out my ass, because this suddenly feels a lot like I’m talking out my ass.”
It starts soft. Steve lets Tony lead and opens his mouth compliantly when Tony deepens the kiss. It never becomes rushed or urgent. Steve enjoys the warmth and absolute bliss of the intimate gesture, and then Tony pulls away.
“But Bruce needs his alone time and Clint’s a disaster?” Tony guesses.
Bruce forces himself to look at James again. He doesn’t want to make James feel as if he’s done something wrong. Bruce doesn’t doubt his own intentions. He knows he’d never take advantage of anyone in this position so it isn’t like looking is lascivious.
Steve’s happiness lasts for all of about three seconds when reality socks him in the stomach.  As happy as the memory was, it’s tainted now.  There’s no one else who remembers.  They’re all dead.  And Bucky might be something even worse.
Tony shrugs.  “Dunno.”
“How much do you know about me?” Bruce asks as he sits down on his knees, getting closer to James’s injury without making any move to touch him just yet.
“We’ve met a few times.  Mostly we email.  You’re lucky to have good people protecting you,” Steve says.
pass. Unless Bucky wants to give us a show all on his own?”
That’s directed to Clint.
“Kind of the point of a musical,” Steve breathes out.  He needs this to be a real conversation but the way Tony’s looking at him is making it difficult to think.  Impossible.  “You wouldn’t mind?  If I spent some time...”
If he’s honest with himself, a big part of Steve’s ambivalence toward the younger Stark is just how hard it is to look at him without feeling sad.  Howard could be a pain, yes, but he was also a friend.  To Steve, it’s been less than 4 months since he flew into the icy water and left his friends behind.  Tony’s presence in his life is a constant, painful reminder of that.
“Nothing,” Steve mumbles, when Tony lets go. “Enjoy your menagerie. Distract me with more of that and I’ll let you move on to bigger scores. Llamas. Hippos. An elephant. A zoo. I’ll help.”
The year's 2020,
Tony agrees wholeheartedly.  They needed to draw attention away from Nanna and Kate, and they did that.  This was never meant to be a shoot out if they could help it so getting a move on before the helicopter blows them up is a really excellent idea.
“Yes,” Bruce insists. “Yes, it matters a whole damn lot to me.”
The smile’s small and slightly pained but Tony can feel that something’s changed.  That the wall that’s built up between them for the last six weeks has lowered a couple of inches.  It makes it a whole lot easier to breathe.
“There’s no such thing as ‘like a man’,” Steve soothes.  “That’s the kind of thing I heard when I was a kid.  The world knows better now.  Besides, you want Widow to hear you say something like that?”
Bucky groans.  “It’s not a bad plan but that’s the last I wanna hear about Nanna’s bra.  Ever.”
“JARVIS could broadcast a message,” Tony says.  “Something... I dunno... old-timey.  Something he might notice.”
“Home?” Tony asks. “I kind of love that. No. I don’t kind of love it, I really love it. I’m going to have someone cross stitch it onto a pillow for you.”
“We need groceries,” Tony declares.  “There’s nothing in here you wouldn’t find in an elementary school cafeteria. I can’t live like this.”
Tony throws up his hands. “Doctor Hulk would--”
Steve takes a deep breath.  “Yes.  Affirmative.  Do it.  The video is a threat to the safety of the Avengers.”
“WIth any luck, none of us are going to need to be involved. JARVIS is going to deal with the copter and Hammer’s security.  You on it, J?”
Steve isn’t sure what to say. There’s definitely an awkward few seconds before Clint takes the lead.
needy.  It’s sad.  He’s only fun when he’s drunk and-- that-- that gets us back to where we started with the...”  The woman holds up her finger again and lets it droop down slowly.  She’s giggling so hard she can barely stay in her chair.
“That sounds legal,” Bucky drawls.
“Girly mags?” Steve asks in a whisper, shoving the magazines quickly back into the plastic bag Clint had handed him. They’re sitting in the middle of the SHIELD cafeteria where anyone can see.
The making out is heated and prolonged.  They grope each other desperately, tugging at clothes and pushing hands up under shirts for more access to touch.  It is absolutely the best way to spend a Saturday even if some jackass wants Tony dead.
“No,” Tony cuts him off. “I didn’t tell him. What’s done is done and telling Bruce isn’t going to change that. Did you taste any flavor in the BannerBar at all?”
“I noticed that, yeah,” Clint says. “And if I thought you were there to hurt Bruce, I'd have taken the shot. But I don't want to hurt you. I wasn’t out trying to rescue you, either. That’s Steve’s deal. Which-- look, I get you don’t want him to know where you are, but he’s out busting his ass looking for you and dragging along my best friend in the process. And since Cap’s scared you’ve been captured by HYDRA he’s landed them in some dangerous places.  Got himself shot the other day.”
“If he wants my autograph bad enough to invite you back over, figure I’ll send him one of his own,” Bucky says with a smirk.
Jenny shrieks again and Rhodey slaps his hands to his thighs and pushes himself up off the bench.
She leaves it there and Steve looks up from his StarkPad in slight exasperation.  “Anyone ever tell you that talking to you is like riddling with the Sphinx?”
“Maybe talk before you write me off as gone?” Tony says.  “I mean, I did stick around for Murder-Ride 2016.  I feel like I should get credit for not shooting you.”
There’s something mischievous in Steve’s eyes, and Tony feels like he’s missing a joke.
Tony grins like a seven year old.  “I so am.”
“I do this every time.  I take good people and I break them.  I make them snap. It’s always the same.”
“Do it now,” James agrees.
The line goes silent. The silence lasts long enough that Bruce speaks again.
who is incredibly talented and seriously easy to work with, and who drew this picture of Tony having a panic attack to raise money for a friend in a need.  She sometimes does commissions and you can find more information about that on her Tumblr and if you do it soon (6/6/16) then you might be able to help out her friend as well.
Life goes on. Sober and happy, Tony develops new inventions at a rate unmatched by any of his peers. Unmatched even by Howard’s successes at the height of his career.
Tony lowers his chin, sniffs, and then makes a face.  “Ugh, I am.  I’m really gross.”
“We lived,” Tony says. “I say we call it a win.”
Bruce draws his finger over his own collarbone so James knows exactly where he means.
He hands the phone back to Sam, and it sounds like Sam connects her to Natasha’s headset.  A moment later Clint’s phone dings.  He checks the message.
“When you get back up here you can have some cookies with your coffee,” Nanna says, as Tony passes her.  “Clint can share.”
James sighs, sounding incredibly put out.  “Fine. Call ‘em. Tell him to stop looking.”
“I guess you could put it that way, yeah,” Tony agrees.
“Call me Pepper,” she says with a cautious smile.  “And you should keep them, Captain Rogers.  Howard wanted you to have them.”
“Any chance he’s into guys?” Clint asks.
“Now, Sam,” Natasha insists.
Clint’s smile is non-committal. “You’ll have to come with me to find out.”
“What can I do for you, Captain Rogers?” Jarvis replies.
“That’s bullshit,” Steve protests. “Completely unfair. What about second chances? What about forgiveness?”
“I want to go to bed with you,” Tony says. “Robot murder can wait.”
“Don’t have too much fun without me,” Clint warns. “I’m gonna be really pissed if I get back in the morning and you’ve stayed up all night having bro talk and braiding each other’s hair.”
Ever since the words “Who the hell is Bucky?” were uttered, Steve's never been far from misery.  In that moment, and every moment since, Steve could only see a future of all or nothing.  Either Bucky returned, or Steve lived the rest of his life in loss.  He got Bucky back or he would be looking for him forever.  Now... looking at Tony.  Thinking of dishes thrown, and late night beer, and bad television and Judgement Free Zones... it's the first time that it occurs to Steve that maybe it’s not all or nothing after all.  Maybe even without Bucky, there is something left for Steve in the in between.
“I held the paper, but I didn’t move it or anything. It’s all him.”
Not in the way Steve thinks.  Tony feels greedy for his time now.  Pleased with anything that’s going to keep Steve on the lab sofa until the early morning hours.
“You’ll see me when I’m ready,” James chastises. “Stop chasin’ me. And stop bein’ stupid with your safety.”
Tony feels a pang at that. He wants to offer to pay because that’s just what he does when he feels like the people around him don’t have money for things, but Bucky looks right at him and gives him that disarmingly flirtatious smile he uses when he’s serious business about getting his way.
At least Jarvis’s refusal to spill the beans means whatever it is, Tony isn’t in imminent danger.  And Steve does feel better knowing Rhodey and Pepper have been keeping an eye on things.
“Yeah, I think you might be right,” Steve says.  “I’ll have to add Green Smoothies to my list of things to avoid.”
“I’ll be right here,” Clint adds.
It’s hard not to ask James to confirm one last time this is what he wants. It’s hard, but Bruce resists because he will not infantilize James, and third-guessing him when he seems so sure about his decision would be a dick move.  That’s a shitty way to treat an adult and it's not the way Bruce would ever want to be treated.
Clint’s a bad influence.
“Not bad.  You want the rest?” he directs toward James.
Steve tilts his head.
“One more question and then we need to cut to commercials,” the main show host says.  “Apart from the sex, which is well-- obviously-- you’re saying you weren’t that impressed.  But otherwise... is he what you’d expect?”
“Is this a friendly?” Bruce asks.
“We should probably send him a thank you gift basket,” Steve laughs.
The above referenced employees acknowledge that:
Except Bruce is in danger.  Kate’s got to put on her big girl panties.
Bruce takes a few steps back to give James plenty of space to do the scan of his knee. The floating picture above the baton begins to fill in, and when James hovers the scanner over his injury, Bruce gets his first look at the damage. He’s seen enough of Steve’s second-hand charts to know exactly what he’s looking at.
There is absolutely nothing in her tone that makes that sounds true.
“The rules are simple,” Pepper says, sounding as put together and professional as ever.  “JARVIS is texting them all to your phones now.  One, you must have your egg within reach at all times.  He’ll be watching to see that it’s never more than five feet away.  Two, no breaking someone else’s egg.  Three, the egg can be wrapped or covered but the wrap or covering must be removable and some portion of the egg must be visible at all times.  Four, the last person with an uncracked egg wins.”
“I think you’ll be fine,” Bruce says. “At worst, he’ll call you stupid and threaten to shake some sense into you. I can’t tell you if he’s Bucky Barnes or not, but what I know for absolute certain is that he’s a hell of a lot more than Hydra gave him credit for.
Steve takes in Tony’s words.  He doesn’t miss what a turnaround like this will cost Tony in the long run.  Justice.  Vengeance.  Retribution.  All things that by all rights Tony might feel he deserves.
“You’re right,” Steve says. “It’s your fault you aren’t on the team. Operation Scorch-The-Earth worked great and everyone was pissed at you and even though things are mostly better now they still aren’t back to normal. That’s on you. That’s your fault.”
“This is everything,” Tony says.
“Okay. I just don’t want you whipping out the Eyes of Disappointment when you see me. You can break people with that shit.”
“Right,” Clint says. “Can I just apologize now, though, real quick? I was watching, but not
is uncomfortable when he’s hurt,” James says sharply.  He sounds pissed.  Familiar.  Spot on to the Bucky that Steve knew.  “I want to know what Steve Rogers has to say.”
Steve takes a step back and Tony grabs his wrist and pulls him forward.  Without the Iron Man suit, Tony can’t budge him, but Steve’s in enough of a daze he steps closer anyway.  The last thing he expects in the entire world is a hug from Tony.  A real, consoling, heartfelt hug that lasts at least 10 or 15 seconds before Tony lets him go.
The atmosphere in the studio is like one big USO rally.  A whole party devoted to dehumanizing  Tony Stark.  There’s so much enthusiasm for this train wreck that the hosts have to wait a moment for the noise to die down.
Which just gets a sad laugh from Steve. “Yeah.”
“Don’t,” Tony says. “You hate Cleveland.”
Tony’s not sure in what world a taco could be comforting in this situation but Steve seems to believe what he’s saying so sincerely, Tony kind of wants to see if he's right.
“Then send Katie with me.  She’ll be my trainee.  We’re a lot less suspicious than the four of you.”
“Fine.”
James gives another nod. Bruce presses a few buttons and then helps guide the stretcher as it lifts off the ground. His hand hovers over the comm built into the health monitors.
Tony sits up.  He doesn’t remember falling asleep.  He doesn’t remember moving down the couch to get more comfortable.  He looks down at the warm fluff surrounding him and he
Steve picks up Tony’s keys from the floor.  “Mind if I drive?”
Steve tips Tony’s chin up so they’re looking at each other.
Tony waves the spongy yellow brick in his hands in front of Steve’s face.
“Thought you might be mad at me, Dr. Bruce,” Clint adds, as Bruce carefully begins the scan. “I didn’t tell you that I’d ask Nat to come for back up,” Clint continues. “I didn’t tell her ‘xactly where we were.  Just asked her to get to Switzerland, near the border. After James freaked over the haircut figured that it might be smart.”
“The commoners?” Tony asks.  “This isn’t feudal France, Barton.  Yeah, I could go out for a drink.”
Fifty-three cents and this guy needs to wait for a check to pay up?  Tony’s going to need to look over how much these people are making.  Obie had been stingy with starting salaries.  Tony figures people do better work when they aren’t sitting around worrying about their rent.
Picking Tony up from rehab is surprisingly anti-climactic.  It’s a Sunday so he drives over in the morning like usual.  The only difference is that this time Tony’s waiting for him on the porch with his duffel bag and a suitcase.  Steve knows Tony had planned to say all his inside goodbyes before Steve got there.  Tony’s exact words were “Leave the car running.  I’ll be ready to go.”
He comes around the corner and Tony glares at him from where he’s sitting on the floor.
“What was that about Bogotá?” Tony asks, tucking his feet up under him.
“Genius,” Clint agrees, grabbing greedily for the plate passed his way.
“I-- Okay. Okay,” Steve says. He sounds stunned. Possibly in shock. “I’m in New York. I’ll be at the tower. Bruce can tell you which one.”
The newspapers the next morning are not kind.
“You’re here telling me the one time everyone thought you’d cheated in the past you hadn’t,” Steve says.
When Clint makes falsely wounded eyes at her, she gives him a nudge of apology.  They’re quite a pair.  Steve misses when he was the one with the best friend so close that half their conversations only required a raised eyebrow or a tilt of the head.
“That’s because you’re delusional, sweet cheeks.”
“One... four... three...”
Bruce sees James stiffen in his seat. “He asked me to call him James,” Bruce explains. “He doesn’t remember anything about his life as Bucky and he doesn’t much identify with that name. But he’s here and he’s safe. We’re all looking out for each other.”
People know Tony’s in rehab.  People know Steve’s been spotted up there dozens of times.  But apart from a few internet rumors, no one has put together the exact nature of why Steve visits.  The general consensus is that he’s up there to try and gain access to the Iron Man suit.  After what Tony had said about him, it’s too much to believe that Steve could be so forgiving.  But Steve trusts Mae with his privacy.  She’s never been anything but supportive.
Bruce takes that as a good sign. He stays quiet, letting James acclimate to his surroundings on his own terms.
“In-two-three-four... out-two-three-four...  In-two-three-four... out-two-three-four...  In-two-three-four... out-two-three-four...”
Steve smiles at that. “Well, you’d better get used to it. I intend to keep you very happy for as long as you let me.”
Steve’s ridiculously easy to talk to and seems content to let Tony ramble on about things he and Bruce have accidentally blown up in the lab and about Dum-E and U, too, and all the terrible things they try to put in his smoothies.  Steve listens and laughs and asks a question now and then.
“Will you please fucking stop?” Tony snaps.  “I don’t hate you.  What you did to my parents... I’ve read the HYDRA files. That wasn’t a choice you made.”
Bruce isn’t sure how to get an answer without being awkwardly direct.
“I’m sorry for everything you’re going to read about yourself in the paper tomorrow,” Tony says.  He sounds nervous.  “Maybe I should go out there alone.  Lead them away.”
“Hawkeye, how’s the weather in Peru?” she asks.
Keep us updated.
“We need Tony’s help to do anything more for James,” Bruce says, as he climbs to his feet and moves toward the front of the plane. “He’s stable enough for me to worry about you, finally.”
“He has agreed.  You’ll see him shortly,” JARVIS supplies.
“I’ve had worse,” Steve says.  When he glances down he can see red stains on his white button up and dark blots along the black jacket.  He doesn't care in the slightest.  “Are you okay?”
“Not pretty?” Tony asks.
“I’m hoping you’ll rename the C3 milkshake back to an Iron Man for me,” Steve says.  “Not right away.  Just... before too long.”
“Oh. The day you said you would never want to see my naked,” Tony remembers. “That was a good talk.”
“Seriously,” Steve tries again, gently.  “I know everyone thinks I’m some big prude, but if you’re enjoying yourself, I’m happy for you.  I want you to be happy.”
“I should have gone to you and told you what I’d overheard,” Steve says. “It wasn’t fair of me to go behind your back, even for a good reason.”
“We can talk about this some other time, if you want. I’ll leave you and Clint to your fun.”
Bruce sounds bitterly sad about all this. Like he’s repeating things he’s heard other people say, or maybe his own deepest doubts about his likability or worth.
“S’not a problem,” Tony says. “I don’t like how they’re treating you in the press. Can’t do much about that, but I’m not going to let it happen right in front of me. Being gay’s not a crime.”
Steve knows Tony’s not serious.  The picture with Dum-E’s hearts had been displayed front and center in Tony’s rehab room, and at some point Pepper had brought a frame for it.  It is currently sitting on Tony’s bedroom dresser in a place of honor.  Valued.
“JennyLouWho, come look.”
It looks like Tony’s going to stop there, but then he speaks again. This time his eyes flick straight to the camera.
“I’m not going to disagree with you,” Bruce says. “But Clint brings up a good point. Would you consider letting me call Steve to tell him you’re with us and ask him to back off until you’re ready to see him? Then he’ll have no reason to keep running into trouble.  It’s up to you. It’s not your job or responsibility to protect him.  I just think it might give you and him
Steve sounds as pained as Tony feels.
“I’ve got extra clothes if you want something extra to keep warm,” Bruce offers.
“She would,” Sam whispers to Tony conspiratorially.
“I’m not saying we can’t do dinner,” Steve says.  “I’m just saying my preferred order of events starts with dessert.”
“If all my consent questions are bothering you, I’ll knock it off,” Bruce says. “Just let me know if anything I do makes you uncomfortable and I’ll step away.”
“Don’t mind if I do.”  Natasha says with a smirk.  “You seem... better.”
“Tony, can we talk about this, please?” Steve asks, loud over the noise. “Don’t you even want to know why I spoke to him for so long?”
Steven nods enthusiastically. They take a table and Steve completely loses track of time. It’s fascinating. He’s happy to hear that Boop had married a serviceman, and that she’d had four children with him. Those children had given her a dozen grandchildren, and when she passed in 2010, she’d been surrounded by a huge family who loved her.
“He’s waking up,” Sam says, eyeing the nearest display and all the data it displays.
He looks relieved though, like this is exactly the kind of ridiculous problem he needs to solve to get his mind off Bucky things.
“You’d be about the only one,” Clint says.  “SHIELD wasn’t big on coddling.”
“Well, at least no one can accuse me of being a bad influence with all my delinquent ways.”
“Something wrong?” Steve asks wearily.  “Something
“Well that’s not new information,” Tony reminds him.  “Come on, sit down.  Let me finish this call, and then we’ll-- I dunno.  Figure out a way to get us all drunk.  Or-- something--”
“I’ll unwrap all that,” Clint says.  “You start back with the pancakes.  I think I’m burning them.”
Steve tries to school his features into something less miserable.  “Sorry.  Just... what you said about me not being a national treasure.  You reminded me of Bucky, is all.  He never got tired of taking me down a peg or two.  I think it was his way of helping me feel normal.  Keeping my ego in check whenever he thought I was acting a little too invincible...”
Perth stupid or Budapest stupid?
Tony stammers over the last word.
“Steve. Talk,” Tony prods. “And then I’ll talk. We’ll talk. It will be fine.”
Honesty does the trick. Tony’s hand hovers in mid-air and then he lowers his busted noisemaker slowly to the table. Steve continues.
He says nothing. Somehow Tony manages to kick the door closed and then they’re crashing into a wall, kissing, touching, grabbing. It’s rough, a little like hockey, but there’s no parting here. No hip check and skating away. Tony never wants to let Steve go. Ever.
“Didn’t buy the place,” Tony assures him.  “But I did call the owner.  Offered to start a tab for the Avengers.  If you’re ever down there, the soda machine really is truly unlimited now.  Grab as many Mega-Gulps as you want.”
Tony doesn’t know what to make of that and he looks away.  The silence is awkward and he doesn’t know how to make it better.  He feels a hand on his arm and when he turns back, Nanna’s taken a step closer.
“You give me way too much credit,” Tony says.  “I thought it would be mountains of paperwork, and even then, Pepper’d say no.  I’m one sexual harassment case away from losing the company.  I didn’t want to fuck everything up.”
Clint’s slightly disparaging description of their process gets the reaction Clint wants since James relaxes.
“Shitshitshit,” Clint swears, as the drone footage switches from the server building to a much further overhead shot from Stark Satelite Three.  The new images shows the helicopter is moving fast.  “They are not fucking around.”
“You can track us, though,” Clint adds.  “Shouldn’t be hard.”
“Please, can it wait? It's nothing bad. Or. It's nothing that would be bad for you.”
“No,” Tony says.  “Your egg.  You have to be the one to crack it.  It’s only right.”
Tony can’t get to his phone fast enough. He’s been ignoring Steve’s texts and there haven’t been any new ones in days. He taps out a message and hits send before he can talk himself out of it.
“You sticking around while we sleep?” Clint asks around a yawn.
“Glad I’m in good company,” Tony says.
“I don’t know when it got so long,” James says quietly.  He lets out his usual huff of frustration when expressing himself takes effort. “I don’t remember.  I don’t like it.  I
“Fuck them,” Tony says, loudly.
He learns a lot in the next half hour.  He and Pepper share a love of art that makes conversation easy.  They talk about museums and galleries and traveling exhibits.  Steve tells a funny story about a time he and Howard snuck into the Louvre, and Pepper laughs until she snorts.  She tells him a story about Tony getting them both kicked out of The National Portrait Gallery for sneaking in a potbelly pig and Steve nearly chokes on his latte.
“I’m sorry that Howard got bitter,” Steve continues.  “If I hadn’t put the plane in the water--
Tony glares.  That’s clearly not the answer he’s looking for.
“And who created JARVIS?” Steve asks.  “Or the armored car?  C’mon, sweetheart.  Let me brag about how awesome my boyfriend is.  I have never been more attracted to your brains.”
He’d put it away in the closet and tried to forget.
“I lost my virginity to his great-grandmother!”
Emotional comfort is not Tony’s specialty.
He doesn’t miss the way Tony ducks his head, a little shyly, and Steve’s pleased he can still get this reaction.
A marriage proposal is coming and Steve can not fight back his grin.
Steve slams his fist down against the wooden conference table hard enough that it cracks in two.  Microphones and drinks tumble toward the center where the sagging table cloth catches them in a pile. The simultaneous feedback of five mics banging together all at once sends a painful screech through the room.
“We ‘ad to schtop for tacos,” Kate replies, around a full mouth of food.
Tony makes a face, but doesn’t argue Steve’s point.  They’ve both read that particular family therapy pamphlet more than once.
Stop trying to make me jealous.
“What’s that?” Tony asks.
“You know it.”
“I’ll be fine,” Steve confirms.  Another lie.  At this rate Pinocchio’s nose is going to be in New Jersey by morning.
Bruce doesn’t ask Steve what he’s trying to fix.  Bruce treats people like adults and he doesn't pressure.  Steve suspects that’s why the doctor ended up the de facto counselor for the team, as well as Steve’s personal tour guide to the greater culinary world.
That’s all Clint says before he’s back to chatting with Bucky and Natasha.  Tony’s pretty sure they aren’t even speaking English.  Steve takes the intrusion as if it’s the sort of thing that happens all the time, and continues on as if there was no interruption.
“Like you’ve ever been in a Wal-Mart,” Steve scoffs.
“Keep your mouth shut about Stark,” Clint warns, all of his usual friendly nature gone.  His eyes are hard.  There’s no room for argument.
“Think I’m gonna go for a run,” Clint says.  “Clear my head.”
“Can you move toward Tash?” Clint asks. “She isn’t clear. Can’t cover you both unless I grow another set of arms.”
And it is a report. There’s a forced effort to James’s voice that Bruce hates more than a little. Not to mention the mess that is James not identifying the leg as his own. Bruce knows dissociation when he hears it.
“I’ve spent worse Saturdays."
Steve visits Tony every Sunday. As Tony’s time at the rehab center stretches on, they add phone calls to the mix, and they get more time together each weekend. This visit, Steve surprises Tony with a few sketches for his rehab bedroom walls.
“What did you try?” Dr. Gerber asks.
“I will.”
Bruce walks around to the other side to carefully lay a finger on James’s hand.
“While I’m standing on an exercise ball,” Clint says. “I learned to do it when I was twelve and no one ever appreciated it.”
“Definitely, I do,” Bruce agrees.
“Is it like this every morning?” Steve asks.
There are a dozen handguns stored inside and ample ammunition. Tony recognizes all of it. It’s the sort of collection you can’t just buy down at the corner store. More like the nearest Russian armory.
Steve gives a slight tilt of his head.
“Only if you’re ready,” Tony says.
Never mind that it took him almost two months from when he’d first thought he ought to contact Stark to get here.  Tony doesn't know that.
It’s Tony’s boyfriend.   Jonathan’s been charming all night with the team.  He doesn’t sound charming now.
“What’s going on?” Tony asks.
It's a rare thing for Tony to find the scale of a problem overwhelming-- he's always been good at dissecting a situation and then solving it in the fewest moves necessary.  It's probably telling that a possible crush on Steve is somehow a more difficult state of affairs for Tony than an armored space whale or Feolin's Unsolved Theor--
“I assumed you knew, this being your company and all,” Steve points out.
The Science Squad has totally achieved their Fourth of July aspirations.  Soil, rock and chemical clouds go red, white and
Because Steve doesn’t have to tiptoe around the ugly truths with Jarvis.
“Not an out,” Bruce says.  “It’s hard not to give you accidental orders.  I’m trying to account for that.”
He loves the way they both look at him in surprise.
Bruce has no idea how much time passes. He knows he’s thirsty and exhausted. He knows his calves ache and his shoulders are sore and that his hands have been cramping for the last however long. He knows that the back of his shirt is damp from sweat and the front is soaked in blood.  Sam stopped talking any more than necessary maybe half an hour ago.
He is damn sure no one in his family has ever looked at him that way.
This conversation is really not going your way. Make him a nice arm, Tony. Please?
“He saw me in Salzburg and he’s been following me ever since. Not to keep me in line, apparently. He was extremely clear that I could have smashed whole villages and he’d have been cheering me on from the sidelines.  I guess in his mind we were traveling together.”
“I’ve got to pee,” Tony groans. His head hurts so bad. So bad. Everything is bad.
So that’s it then.  Tony tries to ignore his overwhelming disappointment.
“Don’t be unprofessional?” Steve asks.
“I haven’t told Tony I’m not traveling alone yet,” Bruce says. “And please call him James. He thinks the Winter Soldier sounds stupid.”
“I don’t want to hurt you,” Bruce calls out in warning, as the man approaches. “Please don’t make me do something we’ll both regret.”
the damp in the chilly air.  Wet in his lungs. This is somewhere Tony’s been before.
“It’s more of a safety issues than anything else,” Steve explained. “People get crushed because there’s sort of a swarm. We’re fine if someone inside the cafe takes a picture. You don’t have to confiscate phones or anything.”
Steve leans in and kisses Tony several times lightly on the forehead, and then down his cheek, and along his neck, to his shoulder.
There’s something else in her voice beyond fear. Pain, too. Shock.
James makes eye contact with Bruce for long enough to let Bruce know he considers this conversation to be the very height of stupidity, and then he returns his focus to the laptop.
Tony can never seem to resist reaching out and touching Steve’s chest when Steve’s shirt is off. Steve rolls Tony forward again, the last few inches, and tugs at Tony’s shirt.
Tony’s a little dazed, and it isn’t helped by feeling Steve’s hands on him.  But when he’s finally out from under his latest project, he’s smiling.
“You’re going to make me walk to rehab because I’m not impressed by your naive little crush?” Tony snaps.
“What?” Tony asks.
It turns out, the answer to that question is pretty much everything.
“Tony.”  Steve thrills a little at the feel of the name on his tongue.  Mostly he only ever says it in his head.  “What are you doing here?”
“You look fine to me,” Bruce directs to Bucky. “Functional. I’m not an actual medical doctor-- I feel like maybe we should all keep reminding ourselves of that,” he adds. “If we’re only a half hour out, I think as long as James feels up to continuing, I can look him over more closely once we’re indoors.”
She picks up a gun and loads it expertly, with the sort of fluid muscle memory that gives Tony the impression she could do all of this blindfolded.
“Wasn’t talking about saving James,” Tony says as Steve bounds back into the room.
Clint flops on Steve dramatically. “Nope. One for all--”
Tony smiles wistfully at the memory.
Now Dr. Gerber’s eyes go to Steve.  “You won’t let him buy your gas?  Why is that?”
“I should go,” Pepper says.  “If they can’t get a quote for Tony, they’ll try to get one from me.”
“You’re going to bleed out,” Steve says. He can’t save them both.
“We don’t need to keep it serious, to keep you safe,” Clint says. And damn it, he’s being all gentle and apologetic about it. “We could do this in our sleep. Steve was--”
“Jarvis?” Steve asks.
“Because Clint is our guest.  And those Fig Newtons are for him,” Nanna adds.  “I bought you Oreos.”
It surprises Steve when Tony drops the bag to the floor, closes the space between them and pulls Steve into a tight hug.  Tony’s fingers wind into Steve’s shirt so they’re tucked together tightly.  He rests his forehead against Steve’s shoulder, keeping his face hidden, and he stays there, holding on to Steve like he has no intention of letting him go. Steve hugs Tony in return.  He buries his face in Tony’s hair and breathes him in.  Tries to memorize the way he feels in his arms.  It’s what he would have done with Bucky before they’d swung onto that train, if he’d known it was time to say goodbye.
And from what Bucky can tell, Stark’s doing an excellent job. It’s very possible Steve over-reaches for her slapshot on purpose, or maybe the kid’s just that good.
“But rather than scorch the Earth, Tony chose to build.  Not just the Iron Man suit, but a future where he and his company could do more for the world than create death and destruction.  I am tired of people ignoring the good Tony does.  He’s thrown himself into clean energy and sustainability, into medical technology and development, into every facet of innovation and he daily pushes the boundaries of what humankind can achieve.  He puts on his Iron--” Steve pauses, looks at Tony and gives him a slight nod-- “sorry, a Gold-Titanium Alloy--,” he corrects, before turning back to his audience “suit, and he makes the sacrifice play.  He is a loyal member of our team and we trust him with our lives.”
"I'm not talking about the many PhDs Banner claims to have but didn't yet come handy when we were in the fight," Thor told him. "But when you remembered to call Mjolnir in the past. Being able to work your way out of tricky situations even when it seems-"
"Steve, a little help here?" Bucky called out, making Steve hesitate before he rose to his feet. Only as he got close did he finally get what was going on.
"It wasn't his worse joke yet, either," Groot only nodded.
Since a soul-mark can be removed, but never tattooed over (and it would be visible on special equipment like X-rays still), the custom was if that a mark was removed, they'd tattoo a new fake (and often way over the top positive) mark on your other arm.
"How are you holding up?"
He all but dragged Tony to an abandoned chamber, and he pushed Tony down to the closest surface not unlike how Tony did with him the last time, kissing him.
"FYI, I
"The Avengers are synonyms for poor organization, inadequate use of resources, and way too much hot-headedness for me," the doctor declared.
Just as he made a simple, yet nefarious plan to talk with Tony after two weeks passed.
"Yes, I did some magic without your help, I'm unbelievably talented..."
"Who is Walter?"
"But, Captain, you already want to put things in my mouth? This can barely count as a first date. And gagging, really? Maybe it's true what they say, the meek sometimes are the ones who have the dirtiest imagination?"
"Believe me, you don't want to," the scientist told him.
"Why? What do you think I'm talking about?" Tony asked with a mischievous smile, so Loki was careful not to fall into that trap.
"If you know me so well, you should also know that I don't actually mind."
It was the first time that he was about to have sex with someone who knew him so well - even better than Pep - and normally he would have been terrified by that thought, but with Rhodey everything was different, and not just because of their marks.
If anything, the first time Thor was free of Odin's watchful eyes, he did something he wasn't supposed to do: fell in love with a mortal, so technically defied Odin and Asgard. Did he really deserve Loki's rage as Odin?
And Steve felt like he was dying with him.
It was funny, but it wasn't just a joke. Steve might have laughed if he didn't start to worry about Tony every time he heard something like this, and if he didn't expect it, even if he didn't guess the exact joke.
"Believe me, I've seen monsters, and a walking ghost demon drinking blood that was freely offered doesn't even qualify to be in the top 20."
"I thought you didn't do one-night stands," he still told Steve after they finished, and both of them basically collapsed into the covers after all the fighting and then the extracurricular physical activity.
If it was Rhodey, Tony could still trust another person, and for once his luck seemed to swift somewhat, because, for a start, that was enough. It undoubtedly helped that while Rhodey and Tony shared a certain sense of humor, Rhodey was still more mature than any of Tony's past flames, so if things got rough, he'd compensate for Tony's quirks, until they managed to get back to some kind of balance again.
"I was. In the past," Groot now spoke up.
"Not more than you are, Captain."
“No,” Steve admitted. “But I imagine nobody is, right now. Are you going to be? Okay?”
And Coulson doesn't quite get how much so until he sees her, and though she can barely keep her eyes open, she still talks to him for hours and makes him laugh so much that by the end, Phil's sure his face muscles will be sore the next day from all the smiling.
Nebula only firmly nodded.
"I mean, I only realized I was in love with my best friend when he died, and by then it felt kind of pointless to tell anyone, but not being interested in the ladies should have been my first clue," Steve told him. "Heck, not even the Avengers know, even though I have been told this era is more tolerant. I just... don't want them to look at me any different."
"The jury's still out on that one, and you broke Steve's heart, so you leave now. Or, I'll be only too happy to arrest you..."
"We can remedy that as well. And Pep, just to show you," Tony said, and not only didn't fight Bucky's hold on him but made a show out of kissing him, not just a peck on the lips either.
"What on the Nine Realms?! It's not safe for you to-"
It was Bucky, smiling at him tentatively.
Pepper hired people as fast as she could, while Tony wrote an extremely complex algorithm that found everyone a relevant job, organized relocation, and provided training. Some posts couldn't be abandoned no matter what, and people wanted to have something to do (and also get paid), but those two didn't magically meet in the middle on their own.
Rocket would have gone to the prom with Quill if he asked for real, and... he was no longer surrounding himself with people he didn't like so...?
"Why don't we have dinner at the diner? I could eat," he suggests, making Steve grin.
Loki cut his wrist with his dragger and placed the cut just the right way to feed Bucky.
The purpose for the latter was simply that if Quill was kept longer than Ronan in school, Ronan at least wouldn’t wait for him trying to beat him up on the way home - a small break.
"I don't need charity, Stark."
"I'm glad to hear that."
“That’s exactly what I’m afraid of, that something goes wrong and you...”
"I'll try my best," Bucky almost sardonically promised.
"I can't tell. Are you referencing some vampire movie I haven't seen? Your list just begs for an edit, Cap."
"You think they'd even let you in your precious Tower looking like this?" Strange tried to stop him.
“I’m sorry Tony, but I’ve decided to take you to a location not even the OSP knows about.”
"I should have looked for you."
“As I’ve said, I’m good. I’m sorry about him, and I hope you’ll find Omegas who need help and you’d get to save them, Mr. Rogers,” Tony told him. “But I’m not who you’re looking for. And I don’t want to upset my perfect Alpha with staying away for too long.”
And, as surprising as it was, Tony felt up for this when he didn’t for even standing. Not that he minded the fact.
"Alright, not just one, but the best," Tony now had a faint smile in the corner of his lips. "My work is my life. And although I've always given it all I got, since you've been secretly feeding on my emotions, the same thing - all that I got - means a lot more. I don't want to lose that. Not to mention-"
"Not."
"You look worse than yesterday," Steve got up later, showing great concern, hovering way too close. "Maybe I should have called you a doctor. You have a fever..."
"Well then, have I ever mentioned I was a Frost Giant?" Loki shifted to his original form he still despised. "But we don't have time to discuss who is more hideous now, so if you'd only drain me from my life-force this time, we could postpone it-"
"How come I'm disgusted by you even when I try to like you is a mystery," Gamora only wrinkled her nose. "But Quill's right. We'll all come and get to take you to prom, Rocket, even if it's the last thing we do together as this group."
"Fine," Loki echoed in a similar fashion. "I just hope that your healer skills are better than your magical abilities were."
For everyone standing, someone - their most precious other half - had to die (if they hadn't already). And with it, the idea of having a soul-marked partner too had to die too, at least for some years until the next generation was born and raised.
Lately no matter what chapter I post here it ends up being crack? XDDD
"But that was only because Loki cursed me to be this small animal you people call a kitten, and the Hulk was taking care of me until the spell wore off."
"I like my current arm plenty," Bucky said, but Tony saw how he eyed everything in his workshop, and he was still toying with the new arms movements.
Maybe he wasn't Captain America any longer, nor a Guardian, not really, but he had a partner, a couple of friends, and a home. As Thor reminded him, always just one decision away from another Steve, and in this case, he was looking forward to seeing what would that mean for them in the future.
And, although his magic was still in wild disarray, Loki could still teleport away just enough so a magic-less Sorcerer Supreme wouldn't find him. Left Earth, heard about Odin's death later, just as the destruction of Asgard.
Everyone was snickering, so instead of noting that Steve did none of these things, he went with it.
But the cloak only imitated an angry shrug.
His magic needed to be replenished, his wounds healed, and paradoxically while he felt light and agile, he also was very lazily sleepy, and couldn't keep his eyes open.
"You were right," Tony even looked up from his toys, giving him a look. "I don't have the slightest clue why you're here, Cap, but do me a favor and ask me directly."
Rocket got drunk once and sent them both to hell, but in such a funny way that Vision could only smile - almost provoking him to a fight, until Nebula took him away to rest.
Although, Quill still wasn’t big, and that was part of the problem. It wouldn’t have mattered if Ronan was to beat him up if he could at least land a few punches on his own.
So maybe Loki couldn't live with Tony honestly, but he could sacrifice his life without lies. After all, Thanos taught Loki most he knew, and there was no way for Loki to win, but at least he could protect Tony, right?
One glance at the wizard who clearly never heard of color coordination given his blue attire, red cape, and yellow gloves, and Loki knew that this mortal was so quick and eager to use his magic because it was the thing he treasured the most. Maybe the only, given how desperate he seemed to prove himself.
And, as far as the days went, Hulk's predictable routine was both a comfort and a good enough opportunity for Thor to plan an escape, so he stayed with Hulk for now.
"She'll be missing more than a protocol, I can personally guarantee that," Tony declared on a tone that didn't promise anything good.
“I know. But finally, for the first time in my life that I have a real choice to make. And I’m not gonna waste it on going back.”
Coming to cover him, Barnes single-handedly took care of a dozen thugs, while shielding Tony from most attacks, communicating to Cap on the radio that Tony was out of commission.
“I won’t let any more people die on my watch,” Steve promised. “If I have to, I’ll go and bring them back myself.”
"Or, has it not occurred to you, that maybe - just maybe - I don't want to have sex with you?" Loki was quick to jump on defense, hoping this would be discouraging enough.
"You want me to pick one," Coulson thinks he understands, but he doesn't know Fure that well yet.
"What do you think you're doing?" Quill couldn't just sit there, and ignore them.
"I thought I could check out how those cats you mentioned looked like."
"And yet, none of them would tell me to pull myself together."
But, letting Nebula die, only to incorporate her into his systems, when he was too late to ask for her permission was not something Vision wanted to do.
Except that wasn't true either when Quill was quietly trying to eat on the very corner of the cafeteria as fast as he could (only risking it because he saw Ronan and Nebula slip into a hidden corner of the library together, and estimated they'd be busy for a while) when Rocket and Groot showed up with their trays.
"Is it a modern cosplay costume or something?" Rhodey wondered when he first saw. "And what's with the gold and red?"
"But they would," Nat notes. "Fury's right about that."
"I'm sorry, but my personal life isn't meant to earn you extra credits," Steve was about to leave, trying to not take offense, but still feeling somewhat of a laughing stock, when Rocket stepped in front of him.
Maria is his best friend, and Nat and Clint are her friends, so they often just hang out. There's Jimmy, too, who Phil used to date, but they ended up being friends.
“But you don’t get it, I’m the worst. You think working for an organization like OSP, I’d know when to listen to an Omega when they tell me not to take them away from their Alpha. Their destined mate!”
"Now you're just telling me what I wanna hear."
"Alright, because if you're straight and I was coming on too hard by telling you about my crush on you the last time, I just wanted you to know I'd never-"
“That I knew but I didn’t care because I was an asshole. Which I can be but not to this level, Steve...”
Bucky was already wearing some of Steve's clothes because he didn't have much moving in. And Steve insisted he could order new ones online, just as he demanded them rooms next to each other, and any time Bucky wanted to leave the Tower, by default it had to be with only Steve.
"You're right you aren't, at least not yet," sensation started to return to Loki's limbs, and Barnes was just standing too close. So Loki could use a swift move to tackle him - using his own body weight to gain the advantage over Bucky. It was clumsy, but maybe also a reason why Bucky didn't expect it quite so soon. "But now that the tables have turned..."
“Shut up, and that’s an order. Just let me have this. I’ve never been with an Alpha who cared about me."
Even so, he first had said no, but when Steve appeared on his doorstep, looking as if he was just a step away from a complete breakdown, with a wild look in his eyes, and told him Peggy was dead, he ended up packing a bag.
"Like you hadn't seen Star Wars a thousand times before," Rocket huffed.
It didn't matter though, so Steve told him he had already decided, and after a month, he was back.
And, Hulk was going somewhere, and he had much longer legs than Thor. So trying to stay perched on Hulk's shoulders was just a strategy, not that Thor agreed to stay with him.
"Because it's true? I haven't said you're great, just that you aren't terrible."
Except, then Tony kissed him again.
“To hold you. Kiss you. Knot you.”
"Sometimes it's just trivial things," Coulson notes, because now Rogers was making him sound bigger than life.
"Midgardians keep these things around for no reason?" Loki didn't see the appeal. Unlike a horse that had at least some practical use, this creature seemed to lack it. "Or maybe, it's like a food source that you only slaughter when-"
"I did not. Tiny is closer than you think," Thor quickly told him, fearing for his life, when Hulk started throwing the furniture at him. Which stopped abruptly.
"Why, you don't want to try it at least once? Fuck yourself?" Stark, however, seemed to be adamant it was the best idea he ever had. "Because given our arrangement, if you let me do it, you can do the same to me later. So, how about tomorrow then, if you're busy today?"
“And maybe I’d also like to spend some time with you, and not just in bed,” Tony added, kissing him. “By the way, do you have any plans for tonight?”
"Except I won't hurt them."
"Groot, tell them," Quill tried to ask.
"You say information," Bucky said. "But I suspect it's something that would keep your mind off of whatever is that you're trying to avoid. And I guess what I'm saying is that I could help you. With that."
If he was dying in a possibly relatively short time, at least he wanted to talk to Stark once - while they were both completely themselves.
And this once there was no crude remark, or sarcasm, or even a hint of annoyance in his tone.
The good Captain could be just as funny as his conversational partner, just maybe before, he was only surrounded by a group of mediocre people, so it didn't quite show.
"That's not true though," Banner's voice stopped him. "You could have defeated the Hulk if the Grandmaster didn't shut you down."
Thor thought it was best if he left before he could be next, even now that without the inhibitor in his neck, he had a chance to fight Hulk, that was the last thing he wanted.
"Great. I still have just barely enough magic to sustain a projection for each night, so my life is pretty much back to normal, but I also got to get some sleep, which is better... But you aren't here to talk about that, are you?"
Friday couldn't have known about Tony's past, there was no record of it, only in his memory, and sometimes even he forgot, but if she was analyzing his speech patterns for months, she'd know.
He didn't have to wonder long though.
"Why am I standing on a sandy beach with palm trees? I thought we've made it clear the kittens came from burning buildings."
"Neither."
"Thank you for telling us," Bucky stood, and circled the table to kiss Tony softly.
Without sex, Loki could only siphon some of Tony's darkness slowly, incrementally away, with care. With the physical side of things, with touch, he could directly take everything as if it was offered on a plate, and it was... addictive. Like a drug for humans. And Loki was powerless against the pull it had on him, just as Tony probably was, the only difference being that Loki knew better, and he had the power to stop.
"And I also demand you to teach me some magic. So the next time you want to suck my darkness out of my body, at least I'm aware. Maybe even capable of stopping you, if you would use it to kill yourself on the field," Tony now gave Loki a disapproving look. "Deal?"
"Kinda like me?" Thor wondered. It sure didn't sound like it the way Banner just said it.
The next time Quill asked Yondu for a favor, it wasn't a suit.
care less what someone did in their bedroom!" Steve was growing more agitated as well, and Tony could only inwardly sigh.
“Just reprogramming Jarvis a bit. I’ve also set up a foundation. I’m planning on establishing a safe haven for Omegas who need it in the Tower. I’ve already hired Pepper, but I also want to hire Miss Romanoff, who is a kick-ass lawyer, Dr. Wilson, who is the best counselor in town, and Dr. Banner who is the leading scientist in the field of safe suppressant research - if you agree,” there was still some hesitation in Tony’s voice, but also a bit of cockiness that only recently emerged.
Whatever, it’s a little lie.  And yeah, maybe the lies add up.  He might know a bit more about biology than he lets on to Bruce, or more about the physics of the archer’s paradox than he lets on to Barton, or more about well-- everything-- than he lets on to Steve, but it’s for the best.  He likes Steve.  He likes to be around Steve.  And Steve isn’t going to like a know-it-all.
“I think you’re full of shit,” James agrees. “But go on if there’s more.”
James speaks in the disinterested tone of someone who is worried that showing too much interest in any given thing is sure to mean it will be taken away. Bruce has been there.  He gets it.
“SHIELD offers classes in that?” Bruce asks.
“Okay,” Steve says.  “That’s-- that’s really not so bad.”
“When JARVIS told you to buy me a bagel, did you think he meant all the bagels?” Tony asks.
“Good look or bad look?” Steve asks.
“Still working on it,” Tony says.  “If all else fails, ban the quinjet from the roof till the last ones hatch and the whole family moves on to greener pastures, I guess.”
Natasha, Sam and Steve all look relieved.
James looks up from his knee. “Take a gun.”
When he finally removes the pillow, it's because his lungs are burning from lack of air. Clint is still there, watching him, with a look Bruce doesn’t entirely understand. Fondness, maybe? It’s confusing.
to Clint, and then gets back to the task at hand.
It helps to have Bruce around.  Bruce levels Tony’s anxiety out in a way that few people can.  And this time Tony knows where they’re going and they have much bigger fish to fry.  Plus he’s got a kick ass gun courtesy of his dad.  That’s cool.
“Bucky, yessss,” Clint grins.  “If the van’s a rockin’ keep on walkin’!”
“What’s not to enjoy?” Tony asks.  He’s smiling an awful, fake smile, that makes Steve’s chest hurt.  “Bondage is great.  Don’t knock it till you try it.”
“I believe Captain Rogers feels much the same about Sergeant Barnes,” Jarvis continues.  “For him, less than two years have passed since they last met.  Yet all those memories, he bears alone.”
"Alright, will this take long?" Tony could only sigh. "Because I wanted to go back by lunch, I have an SI board meeting at 2."
"And if you feel like you need more time," Steve said, looking at Bucky who only nodded before Steve started speaking. "We can just watch another crappy movie or two tonight instead."
"You're such a liar, Rogers."
"I'm going to die soon," Stephen announced, almost just to himself.
"Thor hid Tiny! Hulk no listen!"
"Is that all?" Strange wondered, but then, when the other wizard appeared, he turned back to Tony. "If you manage to teleport yourself the way you did in your dream, showing Wong and me, you got yourself a deal, Stark."
"What is that supposed to mean?" Rocket now looked at him.
"Don't. He isn't worth it."
"Bullshit."
It was only on Tony's birthday that Tony got into a huge fight with the both of them. Tony was just getting to know a lovely redhead who had a not so appealing mark ("black" and "widow", despite never being married), but she wasn't shy about it, and that was exciting and something new, and Tony might have drunk a little bit too much, but he was having fun, except when his party was canceled.
Tony let out an amused chuckle.
“And that would be a great idea except now they are on a lookout for us, and this mission wasn’t supposed to take longer than a couple of hours and I don’t have a day,” Steve tried to not panic, or hate the fact that the 21st century almost had him convinced that it didn’t matter what he was when it just compromised this mission.
"So, you're dating Pepper now?" Rhodey asked out of the blue just when Tony thought he was comfortable with the silence between them.
of the teleportation magic.
"But I know you. You trashed Stark's floor with me."
"I don't want to intrude..."
Never mind the fact that Thor didn't have an explanation why he was sleeping next to Hulk without clothes, but at least that's not where Hulk's mind went.
“I can, it pretty much happens regularly, just... in this era, the treatment was hardly effective, Tony, Omegas had to be in a sealed room, chained to a bed if not mated, so...”
So he absorbed all the energy he could, from the spell that has been already released and substantially more powerful than him. He fully expected to die, and it's not like it would nullify the enchantment entirely. You couldn't put back a genie in a bottle, even though Loki tried.
"As you can see, I don't have any," Tony only noted when he appeared, busy working away.
Especially when Steve noticed Bucky noticed and colored slightly. Every single time Bucky couldn't even let himself think about anything like this, just to find himself already in it without warning.
"And I don't wanna brag, but I have changed," Tony said because it was true. Maybe his abduction, maybe his heart surgery, or just the years, but something left a mark on him other than the mark he already had. "I'm not letting her go because I trying to get rid of her, I'm trying to help her so she wouldn't resent me later, and would still be my friend after."
"Then it's good you're basically in a glass building like a huge greenhouse," "Steve" was about to leave him without anything.
"The chance that I get hurt and unable to speak at all is still more significant than I'd like, so I need a workaround ASAP, while I ran tests what happened if this new feature was added to the Tower's speech recognition system as well, but there is a risk that it would create a security gap."
While Steve in real life looks always friendly and upbeat when he is aware that Peter is about to press the button at the camera, his whole demeanor changes, and he looks more murderous than sane.
"There we go again," Steve just gave him a frustrated groan. "I'd better get to work."
Then Thanos attacked a couple of years later (Loki excepted that too, even earlier), and while Loki and Thor did their best to try to tell everyone on Midgard to be ready for such an attack, there was no way they could have been.
“So that’s your solution? Running for the rest of our lives?”
by a European aristocrat/crime lord who seemed to have the real "iron" and "man" mark, and wouldn't listen when Tony tried to convince him his mark wasn't real.
He had most of Strange's powers, but not the slightest idea how to control it.
"It's baby Thanos crying! Wong, I think he's hungry! Again!" Jade reported while Wong appeared with a bottle of milk, rushing past Loki and Strange now.
"How is that?" Loki went along with the joke.
He had no plans. He couldn't go back to Asgard, not to mention how furious Thanos probably was with him, but he didn't know any other life.
Thanos not only snapped away half of the entire universe but also made sure to half every soul-marked couple.
"I've lost count. And it was very boring. And sometimes very sad," Jade told them. "So you better get together. I changed so many things already..."
"No, I mean it, you should ask her," Steve this once didn't let Tony talk himself out of the topic at hand. "And believe the numbers if you don't believe me. Or Bucky. Do you have any idea how difficult it can be for him now?"
"Of course, we don't have to deal with this now, I promise."
"Define taking it easy," Tony said.
"Bruce said he was dead."
“You asshole, you already destroyed my walkman! Give them back!”
"That's not what you're supposed to say, Daddy!" however, now the tiny Jade appeared, not just a spectator anymore. And Strange used this to get them out of the loop.
"It's been locked, boss."
"Do you want me to grab you lunch from the kitchen?"
"Learn my secret once, and it's over," Barnes acted nonchalantly. "Put that off to a later day, keep me in a limbo of when you'd try to find it out, and until then, I might just be pressured to be as entertaining as I can be."
"I can teach you a spell or two for that as well."
Here I decided to have a 6 month gap between the events in Ragnarok and Infinity War.
"Oh?" Tony would have loved to have a comeback for that, except he was a loss for words, still half-convinced he misunderstood, but fully hoping he didn't.
He also invented a collar that didn’t choke Omegas so badly, but still wouldn’t allow any Alpha to bond with them while wearing it.
"So what? I can't sleep with you until I give myself up to the Midgardian authorities, and by then, too bad, because they'll keep me locked up and far far away from you anyway?" Loki just asked instead.
"You tried to get close to me right your very first day here," Gamora said as if that was proof.
Rocket coming up to Steve with an annoyed expression.
"Alright. I'd need some energy to heal if I can stomach anything."
"Nor are you, with the insults."
"I've always liked you, Steve. Thought you had some brains at least if nothing else."
"Ah, how unlike you to show such great mercy, I simply revel in your exceptional kindness."
So he did only gave Steve a crushing hug, promising "no secrets" then, but meaning no secrets other than the ones that would hurt Steve if he knew. And he didn't resist Steve trying to spend all his free time babysitting him, nor did he get a computer.
"So, you couldn't live without me?" he pulled Rocket's leg a little bit, only too elevated that he could.
It was a start. So Strange first explained how the spell was supposed to work. Then he went through the composition of the spell, and the intricate tricks you had to pay attention to, and he left the gesture last on purpose because he didn't want Stark to accidentally trigger it, but before they could practice the movement for more than 5 seconds, Stark grew impatient and used the spell anyway.
, maybe he’d only get punished accordingly. If he let Steve continue with this mad obsession for the truth, however, Obadiah may never forgive him.
And, some years later to the century, they have a good enough picture as well, that has nothing to do with Phil's presence, but rather Peter making a joke, and the Captain genuinely laughing if only for a second, which Peter managed to masterfully catch at the perfect moment.
"It's not dark yet," Steve stated the obvious. "And you have no reason to come to a bar anyway because you can't get drunk any more than I can."
That said, sometimes payback was still in order, but luckily, Tony seemed to be entertained by that side of Loki as he was fine with all the other sides of Loki, which was not a small feat, given that he knew Loki the best.
"I'll pour you a real drink, while I pretend to join you with some water, and you have to tell me all about it."
"Yeah, sometimes more than one, too, I'm never going to miss that routine," Pepper pulled an unamused face. "But you said it, they were all
"It's customary to pet the kittens though."
"Maybe I don't see myself because I fall in love, which is another significant life-changing event, just as if I was going to have a child or lose magic or something like that."
But Loki moved fast, maybe even without thinking, and he was supposed to be dying next, but. He felt a change coming, and instead, he lost consciousness, the Hulk taking over.
"Sure, sure, just don't let Jade hear that. Not right now, at the very least."
"I've never told you my catchphrase. We didn't get to fight each other for that long or intensively, so it's kind of a missed opportunity."
"I'm surprised you left this utopia then," Loki had the answer immediately. "Or maybe you just decided you didn't like the taste of said bots?"
"Although, I don't think I'd like it to be a taboo either, just..."
"There, now I'm going home," and Stark just took off the Eye, placing it Wong's hand, shook off Levi, and walked out on the door.
Just before he was kidnapped and held hostage for
He was rude but also had a very nasty-looking bruised face now, and Quill somehow got the impression that he was... what? Trying to be decent in his own way by giving Quill the phone?
"Lying, even to himself," Bucky seemed to be sure. "I remember when Peter came to the kitchen one time, and how far you suddenly distanced yourself from me as if afraid being caught."
"I thought you were adopted."
It wasn’t always so simple. Tony’s past wasn’t making anything easy on either of them. But slowly ever so slowly, they were making progress.
Which was fragile before at best, hidden behind a facade, so it was only healthier now, but not how it seemed to be directed toward Loki.
Quill didn't. But then, it also meant that he went with the group to break out Rocket, and when Rocket seemed to be only so happy to see them, Quill relaxed as well, and all of them danced together the whole night as if nothing happened.
"It's not that difficult to grasp."
"I'd tell you I'm a very kind person and I owe you to do the same for you."
"All I'm saying is that I've changed my mind," Loki declared. "For a lack of a better option, you'll do for the task at hand. After all, this is all your fault."
between us, we'd still tear each other verbally apart on dates."
“I’m completely fine,” he told Steve.
Only, he didn't exactly guess how different would it become as the Heat worsened, and they couldn't do much else for three days straight. Steve thought he was prepared for it but wasn't really.
"No, I mean my body. You got magic, but me, on the other hand... I'm still struggling with the simplest of spells."
"That's right, and it's non-negotiable."
"A mad scientist from a TV series who is old and forgetful. Kinda brilliant, but got some parts of his brain cut out, I think," Tony said because it's not like he had time to watch anything. He only streamed some content while working and listened to it, if even his beloved Metallica got too old too, sometimes.
The next time Loki would see him, he would make him regret talking about the Odinson family as if he had any idea what it was like. But he already tried to teach Strange a lesson and that turned out spectacularly worse than expected, so then again, maybe not.
Only for Tony to emerge a couple of days later from his shop, joining them to watch
As Bruce explained, before language, memories of a small child are stored and called back very differently than as an adult, so Nebula had a couple of years before she would begin to remember - if she ever would.
"I'm so sorry Steve," Phil says, while he offers some comfort. "Why haven't you told me before?"
"You mean you can see it?" Wong asked.
"I... it might be not as before, but it's still a deviation. Some people will always say-"
Rhodey went up to a podium, holding the cards Coulson had given him, ready to read them, but then his eyes met with Tony's, and he simply threw them away.
"Maybe I needed some time to adjust, given the era we're from, and what I was told when growing up, but I still don't know why would that matter."
Next, Steve was on the run, then back fighting, and when he saw Tony again it was when Tony all but stumbled into his arms. From. A. Frickin'. Spaceship.
"The people I've been training with are gone. Except for Nat, but she doesn't need anyone telling her what to do.”
"For the record, I know what it's like."
And it wasn’t a lie. Spending time with Steve, he was happier than ever before, and Tony had already seen so much. Letting go was something he could do without regret.
“Jarvis. They’ve tried to get rid of him, but he was hiding from them all these years. It took me 20 minutes to get him back.”
Tony wondered about that for a mere second, but the facts were still facts. Bucky's world revolved around Steve, and that made everything else irrelevant.
"There should be always a couple of protein bars on stock around here somewhere," Tony shrugged. "Other than that, I don't know what to tell you."
"I don't get that."
was a funny story, but not the way I had to find it out," Rocket remembered. "I'll tell you all about it later."
"I'm not sure anyone would like to hear about that," Loki said.
"Don't worry, Phil," she then tells him. "We won't tell the players about the all basketball trading cards you own."
"I got the same message," Tony told him. "Can I assume then that in no way did you indicate to Friday you were in distress just to get me here?"
"Because I'm so happy? With my boyfriend?" Steve spells it out for him nevertheless, and that's when it hits Phil how much exactly Steve likes-him-likes-him.
"Whatever you say, boss," Friday chirped from the speakers, sounding more entertained than intimidated, as far as synthetic voices went. "But Sergeant Barnes is right, and you'd have to work your issues out first."
"Yes."
"Let's do it. I'll tell Wong first thing tomorrow."
Loki loved it. Bucky just manipulated the God of Mischief to do what he wanted, and with such mastery that it should have been taught in schools or something.
"You know what I would have told you if you told me that in Stuttgart, babe?" Loki kept nodding as if in agreement.
"It concerns our school and every student, so for us, it's not."
Coulson's doing good enough in school. If he puts in some effort, his grades show it, and he also has a grasp of what it means to get to an elite university and he decides quite early that it isn't his path. He'd rather settle for less if he has some time to kill instead.
"You don't even like me, you said so yourself."
"Believe me, I know."
And the next thing he knew, they were kissing, and then, just at the very worst of moments, the proximity sensor of the ship went off, signaling that another ship was passing by them, and they had to rush into the cockpit to try to radio them, everything else put on the hold.
“Yes, as a matter of fact, I did, very much, thank you for asking,” Steve was sure he was blushing now.
It wasn't easy, and the "Winter Soldier" made an escape once again - surprisingly capable once he decided he wanted to fight, but still pulling enough attention of the locals wherever he went for Loki to find him easily enough.
Steve is training the next gen of Avengers, so he was contacted by Prof X, so they could cooperate regarding the youngsters, and they'd become good friends!
As if provoked, Steve found himself closing the distance between them one second, plastering Tony over his desk before he could register what he was doing, and his doubts made him stop, but Tony was tolerating his touch still, looking at him with a determined expression, licking his lips. Making Steve wonder how Bucky was probably right and Tony would never deny him anything if Steve made a move and meant it.
Only when Rhodey was shot down on a mission and lost his ability to walk Tony couldn't pretend to ignore him anymore. He had to show up for Rhodey, even if Rhodey made it clear he didn't want to see him.
"I'll go, you have my word," Loki said. "But let me check him first. I think I could speed up his healing."
Thor wasn't mighty. He lost his father, he lost his hammer, and now his dignity: Thor barely got out of the prison in Sakaar when Loki turned him into a small, weak, but always incredibly hungry beast with a yellow-orange fur.
"Of course," Loki agreed.
“What kind of training?”
“Why haven’t you told me?” he finally asked Steve with a confused expression once they got to the room. “We’ve been dating for years but we have to come all the way to 1970 for me to figure out that the man I love is an Omega?”
"You're saying you'd like to talk? Well go on," Rocket gestured at Quill. "Communicate with our new friend. Show me how it's done, then."
"See? He likes you back, Quill," Gamora stood, finishing her meal with a smile. "Why even wait until prom to ask him out?"
"I would have told you to show me not just tell me," Loki gave him a wink, and that, in turn, made Steve laugh. Right before he also applied that advice on their current situation that had nothing to do with fighting, that is.
"And unlike most heroes, if you could go back to your shallow, superficial life, you'd do it?"
Before Yondu would make them move again soon, not even leaving him enough time to return it, preferably.
"Of course, there's no guarantee," Loki said. "I could turn to it just as unexpectedly as I was pulled to you..."
"My whole family is gone, and I have no regrets."
He was sure everybody was just as uncomfortable in his presence as he was with all the heroes in one room, so finally, he slipped out before Barton could make an appearance.
"Well, your body reacts to all sorts of hot individuals so I figured-"
"And what do we have here," a familiar voice said, and the person lifted him.
"He's-" Friday started to say, but couldn't finish.
kids. Nothing less or more,” Steve said. “And we wouldn’t know either, not until they would present.”
"And the media will probably crucify us for this relationship sooner or later."
"It was because of Natasha and Clint."
"I believe it's what I've just said."
"And I could help with preparing the dinner," Steve offered.
“Steve your shaking, and I don’t know what are you talking about,” Tony told him.
So it was unfortunate because while it meant that he could save Midgard and even the individual Midgardians who would have been caught up in his spell more efficiently, he didn't count on staying alive while doing it.
"He was just testing me. He cares about you," Rocket told him.
How was it possible, that despite Tony being a mortal, he was a better lover than any of Loki's previous flames was a mystery.
“Are you okay? Do you need something?” Steve immediately became alert when Tony shot up in bed, the realization hitting him.
Loki didn't quite get how it happened, but Banner could make him laugh, even when the ship they stole began to malfunction, and there wasn't any habitable planet anywhere close.
"If this is your way of calling me weak without even saying, the joke's on you. I'm not the one lying defeated, unable to move."
"Her name is Jade."
"Stevie, don't."
"You know me so well, but then why are you upset when I'm only being myself?" Tony knew the whole night he was acting like an ass, but it was also the soul-marks' influence.
But, the simpleton wasn't getting the magnitude of his threats either.
"I'm sorry, Buck," Steve never felt like this before, not even when he got the crap beat out of him, before or after the serum. That was so simple, he knew what was wrong and right. But now? "I just..."
, at least take a shower first."
So, Bucky might have been living in Loki's tent by the time he told Loki.
Yes, they started sleeping with each other half a year now, perhaps, and even managed to shut up Bucky about it, who kept teasing them both, but Coulson always only allowed himself to be moderately happy about it, not taking anything for granted because...
And even though it was obvious he was just kidding, Tony also couldn't help but laugh, and not just because he could get used to the new name for the suit.
“This is so fucked up,” Tony could only scoff. “I even teased you about the things you were doing and I thought wasn’t very Alpha-like...”
Safe to say, he used all his free time next to correct what went wrong.
"Yeah. I never expected him to accept me. And now he's even making jokes about it, it's quite surreal. I'll need some time to adjust."
“Relax, if I wanted to kill you, I could have done it while you were passed out,” Rocket told him, but that didn’t sound comforting at all. “And I got you your comics back, even though they are drying.”
"How did you do it?" now the second magician was on Tony. "What did you even think of?"
"You mean..."
"I can't believe this."
And he was finally free of the Aesir the first time when he fell. He could have just started a new life, yet when Thanos talked to him, he barely needed to push a few of his buttons, and Loki himself asked how he could be of help to the Mad Titan to destroy order because he was fuming again. It didn't even take much.
"Tell you what exactly?"
"I'm sorry that I chose to hinder Thanos' plans of destroying half the universe instead. Why do you think I'm here? He has already 4 Stones, and won't stop," Loki told him. "So if she has the Time-Stone-"
"Sounds like something you could already do on your own."
“I am all of these and much more. But you can’t even know that!” Tony told him.
"I trust you'll take care of yourself," so that was all that Loki had said.
This meant that Loki wasn't that special with his skillset anymore and that Bruce could have dated literary twice as many other people, but when that didn't seem to happen, Loki just started to relax a little after a long-long time.
Maybe it was the artificial voice that didn't give enough emphasis, or maybe Bucky didn't find it funny, but he just frowned.
"Where?!"
"Maybe I'm also high on adrenalin too, but no it's not."
But that's also fine, if not nostalgic, just like the mug Coulson bought with Steve's picture on it just as a teasing joke at the bake sale, but that's still in the cupboard there.
"I'm not going," Quill told her, while Yondu only eyed them with interest from the background.
"You're meaning to say you teleported on your own?" Strange seemed to be stuck on the least important detail.
"Hell you don't, you're supposed to help us break out Rocket, remember? Nobody of us knows how to do that shit but you."
"But do you think I should ever come out? Or just keep that private, not exactly a secret, but not admitting it in front of everyone with an internet connection?"
How his life was ironic that way, right?
"But who?" Tony wondered.
“Nobody’s gonna die. We go get the Stones and we come back.”
"You chose to become like this again," Thor reminded him. "And you have more authority than Quill all day, every day, even like this, or maybe exactly like this. So why would this be any different?"
"Wow, thanks, buddy, for having my back like that," Rocket only noted.
While also soaking up the team's dynamics, personalities, and general status quo that should be very helpful for the paper when Coulson will come out with the exclusive.
"Just so you know, I like the suit so much, that even if we break up, I'm going to take it."
"I have a shitty memory," Tony admitted. "Just one of the few qualities that I can blame if you say you don't want to be with me."
"So you'd like me to stay?" Thor only smiled, not rushing to save Stormbreaker from the claws of Rocket at all.
And the teachers loved the protege, Ronan so much that even when Quill tried to use a teacher as cover one time, thinking surely Ronan at least wouldn’t hurt him in front of one, Ronan did the same and the teacher pretended not to notice. Or maybe it was because of the generous donation Ronan’s parents were making so he couldn’t get in trouble but the result was the same. Quill wasn’t safe anywhere.
"I don't know what to say-" Vision's woman seemed somewhere between overwhelmed and disbelief.
Tony didn't show up right away again, - he never liked to be told what he should do, even if he knew it was for the best.
Usually, that only gave him grief, but not when Erskine told him on no uncertain terms that he didn't want an Alpha to take the Serum - not again. Then it was a source of hope.
"And what if I wanted to look at some nudes? Do you want me to do it on your laptop SHIELD gave you for work?"
that,” Tony told him. “But nobody’s invincible, and when I saw that you didn’t vanish, after coming back from space, I... was secretly glad that you weren’t risking your life anymore.”
“Yet, you’ve just said something I’ve only heard from abused Omegas. You’re full of scars that didn’t heal properly, and you keep adjusting your tie as if you aren’t used to wearing these clothes. Not to mention the fact that you aren’t infertile, but you never had any pups. How does your Alpha take care of you during your Heats?”
"That's my point,
Thor couldn't sleep thinking if Hulk had a nightmare, he could just easily squish him, but Hulk only talked sometimes, and otherwise didn't move, and was warm, and still better than if Loki were to find him.
Loki refrained from commenting on that, but only because he saw no point trying to convince Captain America about anything he didn't want to believe.
To his credit, Bucky didn't complain or push, but he didn't leave either. Which was annoying. Ever so much when the people of Loki's village started to get to know him, and everyone loved Barnes, even though he could probably drain and kill them all in a matter of minutes.
"Why would we?" Bucky didn't understand, and it wasn't his fault.
And Hydra must have used his weakened state after the ordeal to influence his mind, so it wasn't over just because Barnes shook off their control once, as Loki thought it was.
"Just great? You must hate it."
"He thinks we could travel back in time, Thor. Get the Stones. Use them to bring everybody back."
"I've always wondered what my purpose was," Vision said. "If the human concept of fate existed, why did I have the Mind Stone only to lose it? Why did I have feelings for Wanda just to watch her die? And why did I keep on existing after she was gone and my power was gone?"
"Captain, I'd rather just stay here, and have a few good years than going back where I have nothing."
"Just don't do it again."
"Oh, I'm sorry, it's my bad," Tony couldn't help but say. "I'm so horrible that I was willing to give up the woman I love so that she could be truly happy..."
"Not to mention, I enjoy the process. When you leech on me while you're under me," Tony was now smugly grinning. "No offense to Wanda, but not in a hundred lifetimes could I enjoy her
"Hard pass."
In a way, he was right. While he was also very wrong. But Loki didn't have it in him to resist then, and Tony took it as an agreement. So they didn't break up.
"Alright, one spell, and then I'm out of here."
"I'm perfectly capable of walking a couple of blocks."
"Don't give me ideas," Rocket said, trusting the device back at him.
Bucky didn't start to resist until Loki mentioned it was about Barnes' brain and not his life that Loki was after. So Barnes should have some very dark secrets, even if Loki wasn't completely sure before, now he had to know.
“Nice to meet you, Mr. Rogers, Sir,” Tony’s computer seemed to speak up.
"I thought you knew," Steve tells him, and Phil realizes that it's not just a practical joke, but real.
"Buck, I don't have anybody else," Steve tried to step closer, but Bucky only pulled away.
"The Mary Poppins protocol has been initiated."
So he stopped clawing at the door and gave Steve an unamused look.
"So, what is the problem?" but the soldier didn't sense Tony's sudden discomfort, only taking a couple of steps closer still, until he was standing there shoulder-to-shoulder with Tony, looking at the projections.
“I’m willing to try and see if that’s true,” Steve kissed him, but then pulled away for a brief second. “Just... please don’t act like this on the field, I don’t think I could concentrate on the mission at all...”
Thor could only hiss at his brother and tried to claw at him when Loki attempted to touch him.
"And we should have a code-word if we were to discuss something serious so the other would know when not to just crack up jokes about it..."
"That's why I'm not suggesting that, but a three-way, closed relationship. Stranger things have happened, and we could still kill each other
Of course, his knowledge might be worth nothing, if he was weak.
And it wasn't like Tony was about to do anything with it. He gave up on ever meeting his destined then long ago, just as he realized he might need friends, but that meant little and close to nothing if those friends don't like you/want to see you.
"Define finer gestures," Tony asked through the interface. "I assume you can still give Fury the finger anytime you want, even with this arm."
"We already do," Loki was deliberately obtuse. "And we're also in agreement that nothing more should happen. If we have to parent her from here, then that what we should do, not letting her-"
"What?" Steve gave him a look.
"Did you disable them because of me?" Bucky was right, the time-frame fit, but it wasn't the reason, so Tony had to even explain further, just when he thought he was done talking for the week.
Tony first thought Bucky will laugh it off, but he didn't. If anything, he seemed furious.
"You know, I find mortals extremely vulnerable and their life too short," Loki started, and when Strange gave him an annoyed look, he self-corrected. "What I mean to say is, I left not just because it was the right thing to do, and because not in a thousand years did I feel so embarrassed, but because if I stayed and actually turned out that I liked you as I imagined I could, you'd be gone way too soon, and I'd only end up worse than before, probably, and I don't need that, frankly."
“No, but you can have this,” Rocket straight on threw something at him, making Quill wince when it managed to hit one of his injuries.
"No, don't, my pleasure. Like, literary," Tony kissed him. "I got some food for us already, and was thinking that maybe we could spend the day in."
"So?" Wong appeared a couple of days later. "You know what I'm about to say?"
"Oh, I thought you weren't supposed to," Tony was shocked.
"So what, it's not like I can go undercover, they know who I am," Phil says, even though he isn't exactly popular, and while a lot of people read the newspaper, not many can connect him to his name, and he's completely okay with that. "Or at least can guess, since I was here to interview you just yesterday."
"He'll be just fine without your tampering. Now-"
"Of course," he echoes, and then remembers there was something about the planet in Fury's sentence as well, so he adds. "Go Earth."
To make matters worse, Steve, who rushed to them to make sure Tony was fine, had witnessed the exchange and added.
Steve was quite old-fashioned when it came to sex, preferring to do it in the bed a hundred times over than the unforgiving surface of any table where anyone might just walk in on them, and Thor knew this as well, but there was no need for them to announce that, was it?
And when Loki tried to pull at least some of the darkness from Tony, now he was met with impenetrable walls. Stark not only had a brilliant mind, it seemed, but some elementary magic as well without noticing.
"Deal." This was one of the reasons he couldn't stay mad at Tony for long. And if Tony could forgive him, Steve could also put up with some of his antics, right? "What are you going to do?"
"Anything else?" Steve didn't move, and Tony figured he was watched for his reactions, so he threw the screwdriver on the table, and came closer.
"And I'm a talking animal," Rocket said. "So what?"
"I'm not that busy, but I'm also sure you can figure it out by yourself," Phil tries to keep his calm, and not panic that Rogers seemingly unaware of the effect he had on others and wants to spend more time with him, but Phil's voice sounds harsher than he originally planned on, so to ease that he adds. "Steve."
my allies isn't a habit I can afford, even if it sounds fun."
"Don't say that,
"Um, I have a question," Rhodey was still lingering while Tony was typing away on the screens, analyzing the data Rhodey collected during his first test drive, looking for possible improvements or anything to fix.
"Or, make us admit we all want something more because we could have something even better than what we have with Buck. If only we were men enough not to shy away from it," Steve said, just as if urging Tony to make a sarcastic comment on how it couldn't have been possible Captain America who all but just suggested an orgy, but Barnes beat him.
So when all the online news were full of not even the news about the suit, but their relationship, Tony was just hoping Rhodey wouldn't be offended, but he shouldn't have worried.
“Yes, but maybe we can pay other people to do that. Except for the test for secondary gender.”
"No, but she's been asking about you. I told her nothing, of course..."
"You just keep telling yourself that," Jimmy grins. "Should make your job easier."
Except, Steve genuinely thinking the fight was over turned out to be completely wrong when Scott showed up, and they had another chance of correcting what went wrong.
"You're here often enough anyway."
"Nah, just ignore them. I estimate we have about ten to twenty years before he could get truly dangerous again - if he ever does, - and we still have countless dates ahead of us, so let's concentrate on what really matters here."
It was different when he did, Thor showing him around first, then Bruce helping the villagers out instead of him, then somehow ending up staying for months, and only later noting.
"Why, do you not employ someone to clean your table from time to time, friend Stark?" Thor only asked, as if serious, making Tony probably have a minor stroke right there and then before Steve could jump in.
"No offense, because I know Stark is very capable considering he's just a mere mortal, but I doubt that's possible," Thor sighed.
"So if you're having a hard time because how you think others would react if they knew Iron Man was only a human being, they'd never have to know," Bucky told him. "But if you feel like we'd push you to do something you don't want, just know all you have to do is tell us to back off. Or we can always give you time if that's what you need."
“Tony, when was your last Heat?” it was funny how panicked Steve sounded.
It was Tony's way of saying get out, but Steve only asked in return.
"You aren't as inadequate as I thought."
"I haven't thought about that. Come over tomorrow, I'm going to show you something."
"For today, I thought I could cook something nice welcoming Steve back, and we could take it easy," Bucky told him as if he was reading Steve's mind.
"I wouldn't. If you dueled her for real. But if you don't change back, you can bet you wouldn't like what comes next," the Grandmaster only said, and promptly left, before Loki could even try to explain how he wasn't capable of the impossible on a whim just because he had - used to have, as it was - magic.
"I think he means you owe us a tour if you feel like you're up for it," Steve told him, also giving Tony a kiss.
"What the hell-"
"I mean, you've never actually said you wanted anything more than just a big green Hulk pillow, so I'm only putting it out there, but maybe I wouldn't mind if you did."
"I wasn't aware that we were going out."
Tony shook his head. He felt sick, not hungry. Just when his Heat was over - his condition got worse and worse. He didn’t know, but he was slowly dying.
“Don’t,” Steve hoped Tony was joking.
"Because I was pushing you into a relationship, and you didn't want to destroy me by saying no," Tony stated, not even looking at Loki, but still very much using it as a question to access what happened.
And unlike the other schools, where Quill was always just a loser but at least popular, somehow the worst thing was how all the people who were there just stood by watching - except Gamora who stormed out as if angry that they were taking up space in the locker room - with a stoic expression on their faces, and as if Quill only got what he deserved.
"If you could also do something about making the finer gestures work, I'm in."
"But there is. I've literary just said that your motivations are the most common," Banner said. "And you only want to shut me up because it's what keeps you up at night. Not just a fear of being completely ordinary or ignored, but the fear that Odin was right to treat you the way he did because you
"Yeah, you keep telling yourself that," Fury says, then goes to yell at Bucky and Thor a little, and Coulson is reminded how Maria had said the same, even before Phil started this gig.
“If you tell the OSP officer anything, I’ll make it go away, just as I always do, but once that’s done, I’ll chain you in a dark hole. No computers, trinkets, and digital companions for you anymore, Tony, for the rest of your life. Or maybe you thought I didn’t know you made yourself an AI boyfriend?”
"As I said. Pep usually takes care of the thank you cards people send me, you could have saved a trip coming here."
Simple people were the worst at recognizing the danger they were in and judging someone's character. Loki only knew this too well, they took him in too, when he wasn't a healer just yet, not even completely sane either just then, 100 years ago. Or was it 140?
After that conversation, and as Rhodey's birthday was slowly coming up, even though Tony knew it was a bit too much (but when was he ever known as subtle?), he thought of what could be a great present.
"Why are you doing this, Quill?"

“Steve?”

Tony didn’t expect the raw desire in Steve’s blackening eyes as he said that, but… he could only smile.
Oh. Loki didn't expect that, but of course, he understood. He wouldn't date someone like himself either.
Of course, Tony was blaming himself for the kid and everything, but Steve was having none of it. He was the leader of their team. Being able to do that despite his status also meant that he was the one who took the blame if he fucked up. And he did.
