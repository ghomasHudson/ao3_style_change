to keep moving, no matter how tired he was.  Nothing was worse than Hydra taking him back. They had been injecting him with the same poison twice a day for the past 47 days, upping the dosage every time. It should have killed him weeks ago. At the very least, it should have erased half the memories in his brain by now. And yet, here he was, living and breathing with his memories mostly intact. His best guess was that the rare metals in his arc reactor were acting as an antidote to the poison, keeping it from having the full effect on him. But with the dosages getting higher every day, it was only a matter of time before it killed him. Besides, he was sick and tired of being a lab rat. He had to escape.
, and all of these people were just standing around his apartment, staring at spilled milk and getting absolutely nowhere with the security footage. It was driving him crazy, especially because he knew there was nothing
Steve sighed and shifted his weight closer to Tony, going back to counting his breaths. He was so mesmerized by it that he didn’t notice when Tony woke up.
“Natasha, go!” Steve yelled as he slammed the hatch closed with one hand.
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve had stood up and was slowly walking towards Tony, but stopped and backed up when he heard his terrified plea.
Natasha looked like Steve had just slapped her across the face. “Come on, don’t do this.”
“I’m here, Tony. I’ve got you.” Steve smiled softly and scooped Tony up into his arms. He held him close against his chest and let him rest his head on his shoulder. Steve thought he could stay like this forever, just holding Tony and listening to him breathe. It was the sweetest sound he had ever heard.
Once he was upright and fully clothed, Pepper yawned. “Okay, it’s close enough to night, I’m going to go find some kind of carb and then sleep off some of this jet-lag.”
As requested, Steve helped Tony smash every screen in his former bedroom, until there were no shards left big enough to see his reflection. Then the other man stood guard by the door as Tony turned his attentions to the bed. By the time he was done, the adrenaline had long since faded, leaving Tony shaking with exhaustion.
Something warm and terrible breathed through him like a sigh, and Steve felt his eyes roll closed, felt the exhaustion lying in wait rise to pull him under.
“Not the only one,” Steve murmured aloud and shivered, unnerved by the Titan’s words.
Tony took his hand, kissed his palm. “I know. I know, Steve.”
Thanos opened his eyes at their approach, a distorted grin spreading across his face. “…Stark? Is that you?”
Steve breathed, his heart singing with the pure piercing joy that he suddenly, finally, could name;
“Purple Rain,” Tony acknowledged the Mad Titan without breaking his and Steve’s circle.
Tony was grinning for some reason; he looked up at the Soul Stone and shrugged. “Maybe just hide yourselves a bit better this time? Y’know, strike all this ‘achieve infinite power’ nonsense off everyone’s bucket list between now and ever.”
And Steve was infinite again, blasted open but this time there was no pain, only a rising hum of joy that spun into patterns he recognized, patterns he knew. His memories. They were reading his memories; Steve was a child, sick, angry; his mother turned to him with love in her eyes, smiled before kissing his forehead - universes blossomed at her touch, and he was a thousand comforted children, a million. Steve was young, sick, furious; Erskine giving him a chance, one last hope - he lived millions of young chances, found millions of last hopes. Steve was ready, strong, eager; Erskine nodding, the one proud moment they’d shared before their story was ended - billions of stories raced through him, each a tapestry woven through with countless moments of pride, hope, love; Steve watched as each life connected in a vast web that spanned planets, then galaxies, universes.
“Yeah, sure,” Tony said, his face stiff. He forced a nod. Smiled. “Well, looks like duty calls, folks. Enjoy the buffet, and hey, let’s make it a free bar, shall we? Raise a glass or three, my treat.” He turned away from the now-jubilant crowd and followed T’Challa safely out of sight.
It wouldn’t only be Tony, either. Peter was sharing their couch, curled up at the other end with Tony’s feet on his lap, and was currently snoring softly. Nat was stretched precariously along the back of the couch, her head resting on Steve’s shoulder and her arm tucked around both him and Tony. Sam and Clint were sitting on the floor but each kept finding ways to subtly lean against Steve. Bruce and Rhodey had dragged the other couch over for themselves, nearly closing the group into a circle. Rationally, Steve knew that the team was just seeking reassurance after the near loss of their leader, but it was kinda intense to go from full isolation protocol to being stuck in a nest of semi-traumatized friends.
“How does it feel?” Tony asked, deeply curious. Like they’d hoped, her synthetic body was showing no signs of rejection or damage, which was a good sign for the endgame.
The restored light throughout the cockpit was bright enough to make Steve’s eyes water, the front view revealing only swathes of anonymous green against the deep blue of sea and sky. Steve noted the subtropical look of the vegetation, but apart from that, they could be anywhere. With a few deft gestures, Tony disabled the autopilot and spun the jet to land on a well-concealed beach. The other man unbuckled his harness and stomped out of the cockpit without a word, operating the armor with far less than his usual grace.
Tony sat in the empty room, staring at nothing, until Okoje burst in impatiently. “Launch time, Stark,” she announced, then paused, her gaze sharp. “Is something wrong?”
. “Oh Stark,” he managed to whisper. “I won’t be… the only one…”
He followed the corridor to the kitchen, where there was no sign of any activity. Unusual, since it was approaching dinner time, but he could hear faint sounds of life further ahead. His stomach was keenly aware he’d skipped proper lunch - energy bars did not count as nutrition, he’d been thoroughly informed - so Tony scooped up an apple before he left. The sounds were coming from the sunny side of the house, in which case he knew exactly where they’d be.
Steve wasn’t perfect at believing. His faith had wavered, here and there, culminating in a real rough patch four years back. Shortly after visiting Nat and her baker in France, a bad nightmare had sunk itself into Steve and wouldn’t let go; he’d woken in sure, hideous panic that their shared use of the Infinity Gauntlet had somehow entangled their futures, magic twisting fate so that himself and Tony would inevitably end up together. Tony had made him breakfast, heard him out, then shrugged, “so?” After Steve had pointed out the numerous consent issues with predestined happiness, Tony had asked, simply, “then what would you like to change?” The question had flummoxed him, so Steve had taken a full week to think about it. He’d come back with a question of his own.
who first ran out of patience, sitting them both upright and swinging his legs off the side of the bed, whereupon Tony graciously decided it might be time to move along. He slid down onto the floor, ignoring any complaints from his knees and helped Steve finish kicking off his pants, revealing no underwear - Cap, you icon - and a cock so impeccably sculpted that Tony heard choirs of delirious angels sing in his head. Eureka. Hallelujah.
Steve breathes in, and out. “Yeah,” he says. All things are possible, he thinks.
, Steve thought, his heart swooping painfully and wonderfully, as if about to burst.
But what Steve was struggling with was… different. And no one, not even his friends, understood - heck, Steve didn’t think he understood - and so it wasn’t normal.
So Steve thought it best to apologize, untangled himself and pushed Tony away to a safe distance so he could properly say how sorry he was for bothering him, but Tony’s face kept doing a strange crumpled thing so that didn’t help either, Steve’s teeth beginning to chatter from the seeping cold while he begged for Tony to forgive him, told him all the best ways to forget him. But no matter what Steve said, there was Tony, waiting and listening until he ran out of words again; then he was gathering Steve back in his arms and Steve didn’t know where else to go so in the end he just let Tony carry him through, the other man holding his body close, murmuring soft words in his ear. Warm words. Impossible words. Steve knew he should keep himself awake, should listen to the words until he believed, until he deserved, but there was so much wrapped up in them that he couldn’t quite reach, and he was so tired. He was just so goddamn tired.
The thought echoed through him, anguished and hollow and wrong; in him woke the sorrow so vast that he had never dared speak of it.
“It won’t be enough,” he said, and everyone fell silent. As if they already knew. As if they all knew but they’d been waiting for someone else to say it. Tony gritted his teeth. “Let’s assume everything goes perfectly. Assume we win, take out Thanos, gather the full set of sparkle stones. Whoopee, congratulations to us. But actually, our bad, because Earth has just permanently painted a target on its back.”
Next time he woke, he found himself coughing so hard he swore he heard his own ribs rattle. “Goddamn,” he muttered.
“Mr Stark! Mr Stark!” The kid was nearly levitating with excitement. “You gotta see-” He glanced over his shoulder, “uh, something’s
Tony held up his hands in surrender and settled back in the chair. Rhodey sat back down on a nearby stool, and they looked at each other.
Somehow, from her, the words didn’t sting. “Uh, takes one to know one?” Tony countered. May managed a laugh that actually sounded genuine, then held out his spoon.
Nebula hesitated, then gestured and another portal opened. Steve had been oddly quiet since their arrival and even now seemed preoccupied, so Tony stepped through first, repulsors ready. At first he found nothing but the same gloomy view, but then he turned and saw the single tall mountain peak rising over them.
…maybe, just maybe, there’s still a chance to save
Nat crossed to the couch, kneeling before Tony and Steve. “He asked where you were, so I told him that you just left, that you went home. He seemed… excited. He asked if it was true that Steve had come back from the dead. Then he asked if you knew.”
The Soul Stone sighed. “This is all very sweet, but you boys still have a job to do.”
“He wasn’t supposed to be there today,” Tony told her, his throat tightening. “It’s my fault, May. I’d warned him something big was coming. I wanted him to stay safe. He swore to me he wouldn’t get involved. He
fine,” Wong said a heartbeat later.
“May I?” he asked, breathless. Steve’s eyes held his, lust-dark and open; for one dizzying, chaotic moment Tony felt real but unreal, ready but eternally unready, caught in a fever dream from which he never wanted to wake, but Steve’s nod rang through him like a bell, calling him back to action. Tony grinned back and began sliding down Steve’s pants, moving as slowly as he could bear, but this was revealing new parts of Steve, naked skin he’d definitely never seen before and he was unable to resist licking the muscular crease that arced beneath Steve’s hipbone, because oh
Yet resting brought him no peace. Far beneath his surface thoughts, he could sense the monstrous pain lying in wait; its temporary absence was not a relief so much as a threat, a murmuring reminder that it would soon wake and rise to swallow him whole. As his pulse increased in dread, Steve heard the machines around him speed up in turn, and he grimaced at their betrayal.
“Brought you something,” Tony said. He retrieved Steve’s sketchbook from the bag, tempted to throw it at his idiot smiling face but tossing it onto Steve’s stomach instead. The super-soldier’s eyes flew open and he sat up in surprise. He stared at the sketchbook so long that Tony was beginning to wonder if he’d done something wrong.
, all adding up to a soul more raw and wild than anything the world would allow. But when the world called for service, Steve answered. Whenever the world demanded a symbol, Steve stepped up. Whatever the cost, whatever the burden. And in six years of working together, Tony had never once heard him complain of what he’d lost-
The other man lay still, unmoved.
is the easier option?” Steve said, trying to gesture at their surroundings, but his arm was so heavy. He gave up, an even steeper wave of exhaustion crashing over him. “With the other fight, at least there'd be a chance of winning.”
“Screw that, how would you like to own one?” The man’s voice was familiar. Warm.
Steve turned to him, concern dawning at last. “Are
“Oh thank god,” Tony blurted out, his starburst smile crinkling all the way to his eyes before he pulled Steve into another kiss.
“The names,” Steve whispered. “At first it was just on the bad days, but now I think about them all the time. Except if there’s a fight, but… I need them. So much that I don’t know if I can stop. I’m not even sure I want to.” He blew out a shocked breath, turned his face away from his own words. “That’s… that’s awful. Right?”
“You okay?” Steve asked Tony, wanting to check in while the others were distracted.
“Not all of them,” Tony admitted. He thought for a moment. “Not even most of them, really.” It was difficult to think about those videos as real when he had no memory attached. Technically, thanks to Ty’s chemical interventions, he hadn’t even been
Avenge.
“Might be a start.”
Tony sends him weekly updates on the Avengers. It turns out Wanda Maximoff had somehow crossed paths with Loki and in this timeline had obtained her powers from the Tesseract. Without Ultron giving them a common enemy, the team’s attempts to recruit her have so far failed but Tony loves a challenge. Every update ends with him asking when Steve is coming home.
Fate-tempting jokes aside, Tony was right. Steve’s unspent energy was still crackling throughout his body; in battle, his senses always upped a gear, deepening the world beyond vision and touch and hearing to something operatic and harmonious. It was like there was a constant dance of poetic existence all around him, a deeper reality that he could only access in small doses without bursting, but the beauty he found there somehow provided a path he could follow all the way home. It was how art made him feel, at its best. During a fight, it’s what kept him alive.
Her self-deprecation was a perpetual annoyance, and Steve caught her gaze. “You know you’re much more than that,” he said earnestly, then smirked. “Auntie Nat.”
and people are
Tony tried everything he could think of, pleading with Steve, calling his name, slapping him, but the super-soldier refused to wake, and the hideous damage was spreading throughout Steve’s body, quicker on his limbs. The serum was protecting his vital organs, Tony realized. But if he couldn’t remove the Power Stone fast, Steve would die. Only the Gauntlet could save him now, and the super-soldier was in no shape to wield it.
“Uh-huh,” Steve said, sketching away. He was wearing his own jacket. Cold confirmed.
’ Steve had whispered, blue eyes wide on his. Asking Tony to take care of him. Asking Tony to
“You can maybe eat my ass, Sesame Street,” Stark shot back, and with a blue flash, Iron Man was gone.
,” Steve again blurted out without thinking first.
- that he didn’t notice the door sliding open to announce the doctors’ return, but Steve did, grabbing Tony’s hand between his own to keep it in place against his cheek, holding him tight as if to never let him go.
Yet at the first brush of Steve’s touch, Tony wrenched himself away, staggering as if wounded, still hacking out those choked, agonized sounds as he headed for the exit.
Strange reeled off a bunch of medical-sounding jargon that sank right through Tony’s grasp. When the ER staff had safely transferred Steve to a bed, he let Friday recall the nanobots so the doctor - Christine? - could continue her examination. She sounded so smooth and calm, asking Strange further quick questions, her deft hands steady.
By now Tony had lost track of how much of the truth it was safe to tell; too dazed to reach for a lie, he just nodded.
But for his defiance he had burned too recklessly, too bright, as he had always feared, always known he would; the second Steve stopped to take a breath, he knew the ice would be waiting, this time blotting out everything, leaving no warmth, no light, no hope. Only bargains, and costs, because the Captain had a mission; there was nothing else left now but the mission.
Ty screamed in fury, looming closer to the camera as if he could burst through the screen. “This is my
Steve sat. Tony joined him on the bed but kept a careful distance between them.
The Quinjet’s ramp was still open, which he hoped was a message. He found Tony in the cockpit, finishing up the pre-flight checks and studiously ignoring his arrival. Steve stood awkwardly in the doorway.
Red Skull paused. “I do not understand.”
,” he said. “You goddamn idiot.”
Tiberius smirked, a knowing look in his eyes. “How much?”

“Fuck
It’s the third summer and the flowers are blooming. Once more disaster calls, and they answer. Steve comes home with a stab wound in his shoulder. It takes three days to heal. He watches. There’s a scar, and it’s beautiful. Tony agrees. Steve sketches. Steve paints. Colors, life. Summer passes.
, Steve thought.
And now… Tony swallowed, tightened his arms around the sleeping man, as if that alone could keep Steve safe. The one lifeline that had kept him sane through the past six months was the knowledge that if they were successful, if the wizard was right, then the unfolding horrors were only going to be temporary, and someday, for someone, everything would be okay again. The belief had kept him skimming over the surface of all those desperate weeks, had provided him with the necessary mental leverage to survive the setbacks, the doubt, the fucked up sickening wrongness everywhere he looked. Even through every golden moment he got to spend with Steve, Tony had kept part of himself clear, aloof, because his faith in the wizard’s end meant believing he couldn’t keep any of it, the good or the bad, and so, right to the end, he had kept himself ready to let go.
“They’re in place,” he said.
Natasha narrowed her eyes, still inscrutable. “And why would you send him, instead of going yourself?”
Instead, Steve tried to practice letting go, because he had learned that life couldn’t stop. Wouldn’t stop. Not even for him. It had to be messy, and glorious, and stupid; it was not a thing to be displayed safe and dead in a museum, admired only from afar. These days Steve knew the deepest beauty lay not in the art but the
for trying to save the world from a nest of Russian Nazi super-soldiers. Short odds are he’ll call back in the morning with a plea deal.”
The AI obliged. “A ship has appeared in orbit, boss. The system detected no sign of approach. It just wasn’t there, until it was. According to its entry vector, it is heading for New York.”
“Stark,” the alien said, his tone almost affectionate. Familiar.
Only in the face could Tony find any traces of the man he knew. There was Steve’s stubbornness, carved along the jaw; his sudden humor, slipped into the curve of the lips. The more Tony stared, the more he found, familiarity emerging between the lines of the man before him. The hands, yes, those were still Steve’s hands, elegant and deft and strong. The shoulders were not Steve’s shoulders, but still determined and ready and brave. The arms, if they were really Steve’s arms-
Bruce didn’t take his eyes off Clint. “Maybe if the adults had done better at talking, he wouldn’t have needed a side.”
They had argued the options back and forth, but all had eventually agreed that going back in time to confront Thanos too early would be a mistake; two functional Gauntlets pitted against each other could annihilate the Earth in the blink of an eye. No, they had to target the moment after Thanos snapped his fingers, the moment after his Gauntlet cracked into a smoking, tenuous mess, but just before the Titan stepped through a portal and left the living half of the universe to their ruin. In that moment, when Thanos was distracted with victory, their fully working Gauntlet should surprise the Titan, should let its wielder take him out without any collateral damage. Only then would they proceed to undo the Devastation, hopefully intervening before all the doomed souls vanished, then bringing back whoever had already been lost.
“But there’s no need to rush,” Ty said. “Word is the festivities will go on for days. And we also have something to celebrate.”
“You have failed, Thanos,” Steve said. “In every way possible.”
“I’m gonna make you feel so good, Steve,” Tony murmured, beyond paying attention to what he was saying anymore.
“Or me,” Rhodey said; one by one, the others repeated the sentiment.
“I guess we’re both grieving,” Tony whispers.
“At least let me take the bag?” the super-soldier offered.
“Hmngh,” Steve managed.
And somehow, for some reason, the idea of Steve waking up alone made Tony’s insides crumble. His body started trembling, every cell united in a refusal that was going to be really embarrassing to explain, because Tony was suddenly mathematically certain that if he were to leave the hospital right now, Steve would die, or maybe Tony would, or both.
“Norway?” Ty asked in sharp interest. “You mean the Asgard celebration?”
Rhodey hesitated. He was already dead, Tony thought in a blinding stab of panic, he died a year ago and nobody told me. “Rhodey…” Tony felt his breath catch, a warning sign of what was to come.
“Don’t,” Tony whispered; his anger cracked away to show such sadness underneath, such hurt, that it took every scrap of willpower Steve possessed to keep from sitting up and going to him. Instead he could only watch as Tony dropped heavily into his chair, scrubbing at his face. “Please don’t lie to me.”
Steve is nodding before he even looks up at the man silhouetted against the sun.
Luckily, just then May Parker entered the waiting room, her dark eyes lighting up with amusement when she saw everyone tangled across the couches.  She nodded to Steve as she approached, then gave Tony a quick wink before crouching down to study her snoring kid. “I talked to Happy, he’s sending a car to bring us home,” she said, then smoothed some stray hair back from Peter’s face. “Damn, he’s totally zonked. I hate waking him.”
, was the thing. Clint and Scott had been allowed to come home to their families, and he was close to pardons for the rest. Peter had been safe. And somewhere in the middle of all of that responsibility, Pepper had decided he was worth marrying, and had proposed. For the first time, every part of his life made sense to him, and it all had been going great, up until a wizard popped out of a portal and ruined his day.
Instead, Tony turned and walked away, without a backward glance.
, Captain,” he breathed, eyes dancing. It was just so ridiculous, so endearingly
“I could never make it fit,” Steve said, amazed by his own emerging certainty. The giddy, overwhelming
Earth was safe.
Tony refused to dignify this accusation with words, instead scoffing loudly and rolling his eyes.
Tony opened his eyes to a beautiful world, Steve Rogers lying sideways beside him. Serene, golden. His. They looked at each other as their breaths slowed towards peace. Neither considered words to be necessary.
“I honestly didn’t really think about it,” Tony said, glancing at the closed door. If someone, anyone, walked through, he would have a reason to hang up. Stop it before he really got started.
After a long pause, Tony agreed.
And when Steve looked up, there he was, leaning against the door-jamb, busily finishing an apple. Taking a moment to watch the twins play in the sun. Steve watched him right back, drinking in the sight. Dark eyes. Messy hair. Amused. Beautiful. Tony flicked his gaze over towards Steve, inscrutable thoughts quirking his lips upwards. All these years together, and Steve still ached to know more, learn more, keep everything he could of this man. He sat instead, waited. Knowing Tony would come to him, as he always did. Keeping faith that he always would.
By the quizzical expression on Strange’s face, at least the archer hadn’t managed to offend their new and very necessary ally. “Anyway,” the wizard said drily, “I was about to agree with you, Stark. The other Stones are too dangerous to be kept on Earth long-term. Infinite power poses too great a temptation for the uninitiated. From my own study of the Time Stone, I believe the gems themselves serve no inherent purpose. Destroying them would simply render their powers inaccessible to anyone upon this plane of existence. Their destruction couldn’t affect the cosmic forces to which they connect anymore than smashing your phone could take down the Internet.”
The other man was staring at Tony, taking in his hand on the door handle, the other shoe he was holding. Then he was looking away, blank. “You’re leaving?”
But the current taut silence that lay over them was kinda killing him. Steve had never actually asked why Fury had named them the Avengers, but surely even Fury had never anticipated how truly - how
Outside, their car was untouched, save for the two assassins now adorning the bonnet. “All good?” Clint drawled, eyeing them both carefully.
Chewing. No point. Nothing. Gone.
His friend just shook his head, watching him worriedly, but Rhodey didn’t understand. His list of losses couldn’t hurt him; with every name, his list of reasons for carrying on grew longer.
The barrage of flashes had seared hotspots onto Tony’s vision, even through the protection of his sunglasses. He gritted his teeth and silently cursed whichever overpaid press wrangler had forgotten to outlaw blinding as a photographic team sport. Even T’Challa was wearing a perceptible frown, the equivalent of a Code Green for anyone else. The San Francisco crew had gotten themselves a world-class support team, he’d be the first to admit it, but this would never have happened on Pepper’s watch.
And now she was dead.
, talk to me. What are you saying? What do those places mean?”
The lake is so beautiful in the morning light. He hadn’t noticed, last time. He hides the quantum stopwatch in his pocket and waits to be noticed.
He was already getting a headache. “Familiar enough to know I’m not going to like this next part.”
The serum-driven hunger was pretty much constant, but even by his standards, Steve realized, his body was ravenous. “I probably should.”
“Saying sorry doesn’t change anything about what happened,” Steve said. “About what I did. But I am sorry, Tony. I’ve been sorry for years.” He paused. “I wanted to call every day. Tell you that I was sorry. That I missed you. But I thought you might not answer. That you might need more time. So I waited. But I wrote to you, so we didn’t seem so… finished.” His expression twisted into anguish. “And then it was too late to tell you anything, because you were already gone. Because I’d left, so you had to fight alone, and then we had to fight without you, and then it was over and you were gone and we’d
“It’s done, Kool-Aid. You lose,” Tony added.

in to land. Good. It had taken a lot to convince Nebula to hang back for the initial confrontation, but she’d agreed it was necessary for someone to protect their replica Gauntlet, and who better than its appointed wielder? The android had only requested that Thanos be kept alive until she arrived, if possible. He hoped she’d be pleased at their success.
. Tony tried his best to eat but it turned out getting dumped was even worse for the appetite than getting impaled. Not to mention the one reliable constant in the universe: hospital food sucked, even in Wakanda. To distract him from the bland meal, Pepper started asking him about the other future, and so he told her everything; even the Steve parts, at her request.
A flicker of concern crossed Tony’s face, a momentary beacon of warmth beyond the blankness. Almost like Tony remembered being his friend. Almost like Tony cared.
, Tony thought.
That was a weakness that Steve could no longer permit. The truth was simple. Tony Stark was not worthy of his trust. Even if this was just the other man's revenge for Steve’s own betrayal. Even if, in some ways, Steve had provoked this retaliation. And Tony had been nothing if not clear. He’d told Steve they were no longer friends. It had been Steve’s mistake to wish they could be anything more.
. Forsaking everything familiar and safe in this endless shifting future.
“Roger that, Khaleesi,” Tony said, then winced. The silly nickname he’d used to call her was no longer appropriate for the reigning Queen of Wakanda.
He just had to persist.
, Steve-” and then he was enveloped in Steve’s arms, pinned under Steve’s weight, Steve’s tongue claiming his mouth; every part of Tony surrendered, drifting further into a bliss he’d never known he’d been missing. Just in time, one last brain cell fired in self-preservation, and he opened reluctant eyes, chattered reluctant words, “wait, wait, hang on, we’re gonna need…”
His heart could hold no mercy.“Steve, it’s okay,” he said. “You’re gonna be okay. And I’ll be right here when you wake up.”
The plan came together quickly, in the end.
He drinks the water without coughing. More good. Then they help him lie down again. Less good. Not… time.
“Yeah right,” Tony spat. “You’ve been trying to freeze me out for
“Excellent. Then proceed, dear rabbit,” Thor said, and unconsciously shifted his grip on his ax. Steve could tell the Asgardian was nervous; linking a new planet to the Bifrost had not been done since the early days of Odin’s rule, and with his home destroyed and his people scattered, Thor had a lot to figure out all on his own. At least he had Bruce with him for support. And even if the Asgardian failed to bring the secondary team from Earth, the strike team’s job remained much the same.
“Food all right?” he asked, his civility remote and impenetrable. Businesslike.
“I’m sorry about your friend,” Carol said; she sounded sincere, “but Thanos is still a threat. Fury said you have a second team guarding the Mind Stone. We need to warn them, they may be his next target.”
Bucky shot him a sharp look. “Less on you?”
“You… want to help me?” Bucky asked.
“Until you saw the videos,” Tony finished for him, unwilling to hide from the truth anymore.
Tony’s answer was that awful bitter laugh again. “Uh, you know what, that’s a great question,” the other man said, his armored hand swiping clumsily at his face.
A cold voice answered. “Just a little trip down memory lane, Captain.”
“You’re going to have to hold him back,” Tony told her, and he waited as the revelation slammed home for her too. Hard to watch, but the android rallied. Nodded. Tony took a breath, then walked towards the cliff edge.
The Soul Stone shrugged. “We will listen, then choose who to serve.”
The Soul Stone nodded, a soft orange glow blurring the lines of Peggy’s face. “Then speak your command, and it will be done.” The glow intensified, then vanished. Steve and Tony were left alone, facing each other, the Gauntlet re-materializing around their joined hands. Perhaps it had never been gone. Only hidden.
Nat nodded; of course she was already aware. “Steve retreats into the job whenever he’s uncomfortable, blocks out everything else,” she explained to Rhodey, then turned back to Tony. “But now I’m wondering, what on Vormir could have made him this uncomfortable?” When Tony didn’t answer, she sighed. “Tony, you and Steve have been inseparable for months and then you sacrificed yourself so Steve can get the Soul Stone. You have to know he loves you.”
, and maybe Thanos was right, maybe life wasn’t worth saving, better to let the end come so all of this could be
In the end, Thanos proved too strong, his powers too unpredictable to counter; luck, like hope, was inevitably finite. Four minutes in, Wong caught a flying pebble to the head and was knocked out, which by necessity drew Doctor Strange to the door of the Sanctum. The Doctor seemed to be shielded from the glove’s magic so long as he stayed inside the Sanctum, but seeing his target so close only inflamed Thanos’ aggression. With a roar, the alien sent a spiral of molten concrete to immobilize Tony, who then could do nothing but watch as Peter got kicked right across the street and through a building.
, had to claw his way free, break the surface,
“Yeah well, mission accomplished,” Tony muttered darkly; immediately regretting the dig, he brushed his hand over Steve’s cheek in apology, and the other man pressed into the contact, leaning in with just a touch of desperation. Tony had the thought that maybe there’d been enough revelations spilled for one day, was in fact about to change the subject when another realization scattered his intentions. “Hold up… in Germany, right after I told you Pepper had left me… for a minute there it looked like you were really gonna sign the Accords.”
So many ways for a heart to break; each the worst, until the next.
The billionaire wrinkled his nose at him. “Of course. Figuring out Erskine’s lost formula was one of the biggest puzzles of the twentieth century. People spent decades chasing the dream, promising they could deliver a new crop of super-soldiers, perhaps more. But honestly, at first I assumed it was a fairy tale, something for old men to talk about and young fools to waste their time on. And then later,” he gestured at Steve, “there was you.”
Tony allowed himself a grin. “Amazing. I wouldn’t have lasted ten seconds without them. If I’d had FRIDAY with me, I would’ve had him.”
Once he is alone, he writes a letter, because all things are possible.
The return of hope was a rush beyond anything Tony could have dreamed. It also made his knees buckle, and only Peter’s quick grab had kept him from hitting the floor.
,” the tycoon said, attempting a sneer. “What else?
Tony hated it.
Steve was seized by a huge, hitching breath, and it was only then that he realized his own face felt wet.

Whatever the other man heard in his voice, he instantly relaxed; next, his gaze searched Tony’s face, back and forth, up and down; what he found there Tony did not know, but by the time their eyes finally met, Steve’s expression had become soft, radiant. Beautiful. Without dropping his gaze, Steve raised their linked hands and pressed his lips to Tony’s knuckles, the only prayer Tony would ever need.
Nebula was not alone. Schmidt was behind her, hanging back to watch. He came forward now, floating above the water, the reflected stars barely rippling at his eerie passage.
Of course, seconds later the door was opening and Stark was bustling in at full throttle, firing out apologies that may even have been sincere, attributing his unavoidable delay to his efforts to secure international support for the new Asgardian settlement. Which, as excuses went, was fairly solid, Steve grudgingly supposed. Stark’s cheerful explanation washed away the worst of the room’s frustration, enough so that the briefing could get underway.
His thoughts abruptly stopped when Steve tugged his arm up and began cleaning his wounds. He could feel his face redden with shame and embarrassment, but Steve pretended not to notice.
Thor could have killed him with a blast of lightning like that, or at least have done some serious damage. The only reason why he wasn’t dead was because of that suit. The only reason why he could put up such a fight was because of that suit. He could never be like Natasha or Clint: completely trained perfectly in combat. Sure, Steve had his shield, but he was a damn good fighter, even though everything special about him had come out of a bottle.
“Mute,” Tony snapped, but it came out almost inaudibly.
Tony was cut off by looking down at where Steve was holding him, realizing that as he had began picking things up, the towel he had been clutching started riding up on his wrist. His freshly cut wrist was now entirely exposed, blood noticeably staining the towel. Everything seemed to move in slow motion and before he could make up any excuses or recoil, the towel was stripped off of him completely.
I would encourage you to speak to the others. I won’t force you to, but I don’t think you should hide any of this anymore, Tony. It’s not good for you. We’re all here to support you and be a crutch if you need one. You don’t have to tell them to the fullest extent of what you… did to yourself today, but we’re a
The soldier led them to the bathroom that was connected to the back corner of the lab. He switched on the light and Tony flipped the lid to the toilet closed, taking a seat on top of it.
Tony wanted to thank him (or maybe even just ask him to leave again), but honestly, he didn’t have the energy. He followed along and crouched down in front of the other, gathering up his supplies.
“It’s alright, Tony,” he assured him. “You don’t need to be embarrassed. You can't help it.”
“Strong, huh?” Tony chuckled humorlessly. “Thanks, Cap, but I beg to differ.”
to fuck it up just like he fucked everything else up in his life. That’s why Pepper left, that’s why Fury and Natasha were hesitant to let him be apart of the Avengers, that’s why Steve thought of him as nothing other than an arrogant prick in a tin can.
,” he muttered, running a hand through his hair and squeezing his eyes tightly shut. “What am I?”
“Yeah, actually,” the blonde answered, his confused expression fading away as he went along with the question. “We were wondering whose turn it was to cook tonight, since Bruce did yesterday. Clint kind of wants to order Chinese though. What do you th-”
“Look, I know your work is important to you,” Steve began understandingly, “but you need to take it easy. You’re always down here by yourself and you only come out when one of us practically forces you to. That can’t be healthy.”
Tony frantically looked around, switching the knife closed and sliding it under the table as quietly and inconspicuously as he could manage. He noticed an oil-stained towel that had been on the table sprawled out onto the floor in his near vicinity. Quickly, he picked it up and - as casually as possible - he draped it over his bleeding arm, hoping that it looked like he had just cleaned up some spilled oil or adhesive and not like
He could feel his heart begin to race again with his vision becoming hazy and without realizing it, he flicked open the blade and made a horizontal cut below the first one. He sucked in a deep breath, slinging his head back with his eyes aimed at the ceiling. He felt a little better. He stayed like that momentarily, closing his eyes shut and just feeling the blood drip down his arm. Why was this so morbidly relaxing to him? Maybe he should make another.
Then there was that one particular evening when things seemed to plummet again. It was around supper time when Tony, like usual, was in the lab. He was working on some new electrical arrows for Clint, while humming along to the Black Sabbath song that was playing over the speakers in the lab.
Tony nodded along as he spoke, listening quietly and staring down at him from where he was knelt in front of him.
Tony cleared his throat, pulling his arm out of his grasp. “Y-You know - uh - Clint was right. Chinese sounds pretty good for dinner. Why don’t we go - “
He could see Steve’s face shifting into a crestfallen state and he wondered what it took for his expression to break. Was it the way Tony’s leg trembled under his palm, or the way his words were barely a whisper as they escaped his lips? Or maybe it was the fact that his friend’s voice had cracked during the sentence, the loss of hope and self-hatred seeping out through the tear. But all of it made Steve’s heart ache.
Steve knelt down and helpfully began picking up the tools that Tony had flung off the table. In any other situation, that would’ve been appreciated, but not in this moment when Tony wanted anything but for Steve to stay longer in the lab than he already was.
The captain paused for a moment, just as he was about to place a saw blade back onto the table. He set the tool to the side and, inspecting the ground, he placed a single finger onto the tile beneath him. He dabbed his finger onto the surface of the floor and then brought his hand up to his face, concentrating on the sight.
“I'm just…” Tony couldn't stop his hands from shaking, though he tried to settle them at least by fidgeting with the hem of his greasy tank top. “I'm so tired of never being in control. One minute, I'm fine and then the next, I'm hyperventilating and having JARVIS help me count my breathing.”
Tony froze, feeling his entire body shutting down on him. He had never felt more naked in his life, as he watched in horror as the soldier’s face contorted up into a mix of puzzlement and dismay. It felt like an eternity had passed with nothing other than Steve staring down at his bleeding arm and Tony, for once, trying to conjure up the right words to say.
He admired his work for a moment before -
Steve paused, but retracted his hands away from Tony after his arm was completely bandaged up. He combed a hand through his hair, eyebrows knitting together as he mulled over the question.
“But what?” challenged Steve.
Steve’s eyebrows creased together, but he remained quiet, not wanting to argue anymore with the irritatingly stubborn man. Instead of walking out though, he dropped back down to his knees and gingerly began plucking Tony’s tools off of the floor and setting them gently back down on the table.
“Son of a bitch,” muttered Tony, setting down his tools on the table and inspecting his palm.
Steve’s eyes slowly lifted up and latched onto Tony’s.
If anyone were to ever ask, Tony Stark was okay. Even more than okay, actually. He was great - he was better-than-ever - and he was always equipped with a cocky smile that he would never let falter. At least, not in front of other people, anyway. He knew that he couldn’t let people find out just how much of a wreck he actually was. He was a
“What the hell are you - “
“Nothing, just a mishap,” Tony brushed it off. “I still need to work on Clint’s arrows though, so - “
But that was months ago and Tony was onto more things, such as stopping a terrorist called the Mandarin. He had successfully done that, but that really took a toll on his relationship with Pepper Potts. She didn’t feel safe anymore, especially while being around him when he acted chaotically and put not only himself, but her, in danger. She left and was staying with a family member for the time being.
“Steve?” Tony asked, his voice slightly hoarse.
“Why would you ever want to hurt yourself, Tony?” he asked, exasperated.
Steve worked in silence, trying to be as gentle yet as thorough as possible. After all, an infection would definitely make things ten times worse for Tony. Things already seemed bad enough for him, so Steve didn’t want to add onto that list.
“This is what I
As Steve fished out the medical kit from the cabinet under the sink, Tony’s thoughts grew darker. Why had he been so stupid? He could’ve easily gotten Steve out of the lab before he witnessed his arm being a bloody mess. He was so careless, so dense. He could’ve kept this a secret, along with how bad his mental and emotional state were, but
Suddenly, as he was adjusting a couple wires that connected intricately into the shaft of one of the arrows, his hand slipped and the wire sent a shock throughout his hand, leaving a tingling sensation lingering.
“Tony,” Captain’s voice was eerily calm. “What happened?”
Tony hadn’t been the same since he was recruited to be apart of S.H.I.E.L.D’s new initiative, the Avengers. The idea of having a league of superheroes that would serve to protect was created by Nick Fury and although Tony wasn’t necessarily a team player, he joined. Sounds like a fine idea, right? Well, after having to deal with a psychopathic god from another world trying to take over New York with a swarm of aliens, it wasn’t all fun and games. Not to mention being sucked into a giant wormhole and almost dying from that experience really put a damper on everything.
He shook his head slowly, unsure of what to say. “I don’t know, Tony, I really don’t. I’m sorry.”
Tears ran down his face until the t-shirt Steve was wearing was now gradually becoming damp with Tony’s tears, but he didn’t seem to mind. He even felt like crying himself, but he needed to be strong for Tony.
When Pepper had left, he had felt so lonely. He constantly worked in his shop on his suit, or his gadgets, or anything else that he could get his hands on. The distraction, he felt, was necessary. Sure, he forgot to eat sometimes and he would usually go days without sleep (or until he would pass out from exhaustion), but he wanted to keep working - he
"Sir - “ JARVIS began, right as Tony dragged the blade over his wrist.
Tony felt his fingers reaching into the back pocket of his tattered jeans, pulling out a pocket knife that he always kept with him (though he wasn’t sure why; old habit, maybe?) and dropping onto the floor beneath him. He pressed his back up against the leg to the table, facing away from the door to the lab.
“Tony, there’s no way someone gets accidental cuts in this manner by messing around with some tools,” Steve reprimanded, frustrated. “Especially when they’re horizontal like this
“Why is there blood on your floor?” asked Steve, tilting his head to the side in curiosity. He held up his hand to show that his index finger was stained with Tony’s blood.
for people like us - or for people that go through crap that we go through - to have mental health issues. Why else do you think S.H.I.E.L.D has so many psychiatrists? Hell, even Clint sees one and I'm sure Bruce does too.”
Tony nodded his head reluctantly, but remained silent. He held onto the bloody towel again as if it were a security blanket.
“Hey,” Steve spoke gently, taking Tony's hesitance as an affirmation. He slowly reached out and placed his hand on Tony’s knee, even though the billionaire half-flinched at the touch, but Steve calmly kept his palm resting there.
here for you.”
A small drop of blood began growing on the tip of his thumb and he rolled his eyes. He brought the finger up to his lips and swiftly sucked on the tiny wound. The blood flow halted and he wiped his thumb off on his ripped jeans.
Steve looked Tony up and down suspiciously and Tony tried not to crumble under his assertive gaze. Finally, he asked, “You okay, Stark?”
Tony was so lucky to be alive and it was all thanks to the red and gold, titanium alloy that he braced himself in for battle. He would be
“Hey, Cap,” spoke Tony, his voice sounding natural (
He froze for a moment, all of his senses focusing onto this crooked line of blood that was now seeping out of a sharp cut. He wasn’t sure which of the tools had given him the wound, but he was somewhat grateful for it.
now. We need to be there for each other, no matter what.”
“I don’t understand.” The other man sounded defeated, no longer frustrated with his lying. He knit his perplexed eyebrows together and ran a hand through his hair, looking deep in thought.
“You don’t have to suffer in silence anymore, Tony,” continued Steve, his tone strong and vibrant with passion. “We’re all here for you -
He heard the door to the lab swinging open from behind him. “Tony?”
, Steve,” insisted Tony. “I work, I build, I tinker, I fix things. It’s just like Banner with his science experiments and Barton with constant target practice. It’s just a hobby - wait no, it’s my
to keep working. It all kept the thoughts at bay.
Tony immediately wrapped his arms around the captain’s midsection, burying his head into the crook of his neck. He breathed in Steve’s scent and found it oddly comforting. This is what he had needed for so long, without even realizing it. He just needed someone,
, for God’s sake. He came from a line of men that were to never show weakness, whether that be physically, mentally, and especially emotionally.
“I’m nothing!” he shouted and in one swift motion, he swiped everything off of the long metal slab in front of him.
It was nice, actually. Steve and Tony were on better terms than when they had first met, even though Tony’s snarky comments often got on Steve’s nerves and Steve’s constant goody-goody attitude made Tony groan. Bruce and Tony often worked on experiments in the lab together, which was nice, considering Tony rarely came across anyone with his similar intellect. Tony had also worked on creating a training center for Clint and Natasha in the compound, which had also been a nice distraction for him. In fact, everyone’s presence in general seemed to be a well-enough distraction for him. He no longer spent days on end building, he now had people (other than JARVIS) to remind him to eat, and all-in-all things seemed to be looking up. He still experienced nightmares, along with the occasional panic attack and depressing thoughts, but things were - for once - okay.
“I’m fine, Cap,” he sighed, rolling his eyes impatiently. “I don’t need to be interrogated. Just let me get back to work please.”
The two stayed like that for what felt like forever, but neither of them cared.
He would never admit it to anyone, but his loneliness was the main reason for inviting the Avengers to stay with him at his tower (all of them except for Thor, who returned to Asgard after the “New York incident”). He had made up a lie that Fury thought it would be nice if the team could do a little “bonding” or whatever, and that by having the team all in one place, it would make it easier for all of them to be contacted for upcoming missions, and a bunch of other bullshit excuses that came to his mind. They had all bought it. After all, he was convincing (and rather persuasive).
Then he rose to his feet and skeptically looked over at Tony, who was trying with every fiber in his body to remain as calm and collected as possible.
Tony gulped, yet kept his composure. “Oh, right. I had a little accident earlier. Nothing too major, I just nicked myself while fixing up one of my suits. No biggie.”
“Mmm?” Steve hummed, sliding a bandage onto the last cut.
“Steve, you don’t need to - “ he began.
Less than a moment later, Steve stopped and suddenly grabbed at his arm.
“Did you… Did you do this to yourself?” Steve’s facial expression softened and the look in his eyes made Tony’s heart jolt.
Tony could feel his heart rate increasing as his mind began to spin. He gripped two fistfuls of his hair, tugging on it and trying to regain his composure. His breathing became ragged and he sunk his nails into his scalp, but barely felt anything.
“JARVIS, cut the music please!” he called out and instantly, the room was filled by silence.
without that. He wouldn’t have escaped the wormhole…
“Steve, don’t be ridiculous,” he pressed stubbornly, completely unwilling to admit to it.
“I just… I don’t know,” he admitted. “I would’ve never expected this. You’re just so strong. I didn’t know you were hurting so much to the point where you would…”
“Yeah, why wouldn’t I be?” the mechanic stated breezily. Before Steve had the chance to counter, he said, “Actually, I’m pretty busy though, so maybe you should - “
“I don’t care,” Tony blurted out, hands twiddling. “Either way is fine with me.”
“You think I don't know that?” Tony chuckled darkly, staring down at the floor with the captain’s hand on his leg in his peripheral vision. “I'm a
He mentally facepalmed and realized that JARVIS was likely about to tell him that someone was approaching the lab door or requesting to enter, as he often did. He probably should’ve locked it this time.
“What’s that supposed to mean?” the mechanic asked almost defensively, raising an eyebrow.
Steadily, he reached for the arrows again, trying to keep himself busy and his mind blank. Carefully, he replaced the defective wire with a more functioning one, sealing the shaft and placing it away from the ones that still needed to be modified.
The Soul Stone tilted her head in curiosity. “Speak your need, and I will consider it.”
And with a sudden desperate shock, Tony thought there could be nothing in the world he would ever love more than this man in this moment. Nothing he’d ever wanted more, than to grant his request.
Instead, they landed.
Tony had woken up furious, ready to rip Ty apart, but the tycoon had been too well prepared, his ambush too cunning.
-” His voice failed when Helen shook her head.
“Finish your pudding,” she ordered.
Tony forced himself to sound cheerful.
“He’s fine. I told him to go eat, and your friends too. They kinda looked like they needed a break.”
The whole team would meet for morning debrief over breakfast, or supper for the night shift. Then Tony would disappear off to work in the main lab with some combination of Thor, Rocket, Bruce and the Queen, plus Nebula on occasion. Steve would head to Command Ops; from there he could manage the international crises of the day with the steady assistance of FRIDAY, plus usually Rhodes and Clint on the day shift, with Nat and Okoye handling nights.
“About that,” Tony said, and then the ground was on his face and Rhodey was shouting loud words in his ear but it was too late, he was already crumbling, and he felt himself swoop one full circle and lift away into the dark place again.
He nods politely, but as he leaves to return the scepter to the Tower he is smoke and embers, his heart snagged on a new idea, a reckless and thoroughly stupid idea, because even if Steve can’t save
Once they had the more comfortable Gauntlet formation, they experimented a little more; working together, they figured out how to use the Space Stone to search through the blast wreckage and extract the remaining Stones; Time and Mind. They opted to leave the Time Stone until last, and so they tried the Mind Stone first.
Steve felt Tony tense beside him, but squeezed his hand in reassurance. This was the job. It had always been the job.
“Nothing changed,” Tony snapped, then forced his expression back to neutral. “Nothing happened.”
“Wow, what a trip,” Tony managed. “Same neighbor you mentioned?”
The kid bobbed his head violently in response. “Oh, oh of course, I just… if I may, I just wanted to say thank you, for going public. It really means a lot to the community.”
Tony winced. He knew what this was about. “Accept audio, but on low volume,” he told the AI.
He takes one moment, there beside Vision’s body, then he stands. He takes stock of the grieving around him. Romanoff. Rhodes. Banner. Okoye. The survivors bear no significant injuries that he can see. Nearby, the raccoon is weeping. The Captain reaches down, grasps a paw, pulls him to his feet. No one quits today.
Somehow it was fitting, that today he would fail at this too.
“What?” For a second the other man looked thrown, then his expression cleared. “Oh. Slept with a man?”
, dammit.
“Not enough,” Tony said. “What happened after Thanos got the full set?”
“Guh, welcome to Earth! Lousy stinkin’ joke of a planet,” the raccoon griped. They all ignored him, having long learned not to pay his grumblings much heed.
. A child, begging aloud but with nobody to hear.
He let his hand fall.
“People of Earth,” a familiar voice boomed in his ear. “Fear not, we come in peace-”
Closing his eyes against the late afternoon glare, Steve sank back against the sofa cushions, letting his contentment wash over his limbs. Melty as a sun-baked cat, Tony had once described him in this state. Steve enjoyed living down to the description.
“I just like when you talk,” Steve said, then closed his eyes. Even through his weariness, he felt the blush rise in his cheeks, a weakness he blamed on his impaired state.
After Strange asked the doctors about a billion rapid-fire questions, he’d conferred with Wong before confirming that yes, he believed he could help. Using the Time Stone, there should be a way to place Steve into a timeless state, giving Tony and the others time to recreate the serum.
Nearby, someone cleared their throat, but neither looked away. “We need to begin now, Captain Rogers.”
She stared at him, then scrubbed at her eyes. “Of course you would know that,” she muttered, and yes, those were tears threatening to spill.
he realized with a vague twist of embarrassment.
Yet that was the key, wasn’t it? If there was no other way, then this had to be the only way, but he had no directions for what that would look like, so it could look like anything. All he knew was the wizard thought his survival was vital to undoing the apocalypse. So, whatever he did next had to be a part of it, right? It sounded ridiculous even in his head, but this wasn’t some mystic notion of fate giving him comfort; no, it was faith, the same kind of faith he had in math and science, that even if he couldn’t see it or feel it, there was a predictable law governing the universe, a possible answer that was findable, knowable. Dr. Strange knew reality in a different language, that was all, and the wizard had seen a future where they could win; his actions had ensured this was the future where they would win; if their winning was therefore inevitable, then Tony couldn’t fail.
It was really no big deal. “Pencils in the bag,” Tony answered, and flopped down on the nice tickle-free blanket, happy to stay out of the way. It looked like tomorrow in the lab would need to be a long day, but he figured if he sorted his thoughts now, he could at least get his shit done as efficiently as possible. And he did spend a good chunk of time mentally reviewing his task list, but gradually, he felt his awareness slow to match the deep peace of the land around them. In return, a hazy sleepy contentment seeped throughout his body and set him floating away from all of his worries.
Tony swayed, turned. Stared.
Somehow Tony’s offer sparked an equal but opposite terror. “
“Uh, I guess?” Steve said, confused by his best friend’s apparent surprise. “So what?”
Tony closed his eyes, still floored by the unfamiliar sensation of comfort, of warm, dizzying peace. He would give anything to keep this, he realized. Risk anything, pay anything. He tried to calculate the odds that Steve could feel even halfway as strongly, but then the other man sighed, hot breath tickling his hair so that Tony felt a thrill of lust throughout his whole body. It was so distracting he forgot how to math.
And just that, just the soft sigh of Steve saying his name, was enough to stop the stars. He pressed their intertwined fingers to his lips, needing to mark the moment. “I promise,” he said. “Whatever comes. We do this together.”
Steve laughed out loud, the sound surprising even himself. “I guess we did.”
The super-soldier was staring down at the armor and frowning - no,
05:09, Tuesday 3rd July 2018
At his flinch, she shook her head, her expression softening. “No, I mean… it’s more that it doesn’t matter, you and Steve. Not for you and me. I was already done. One minute, we were in New York planning our wedding, you were talking about baby names, for Christ’s sake, and then the next you were gone, and I was alone, and you want to know the worst part? All I could think was, here we go again.”
“Only the boring part, brother,” she sniffed. The Princess had earned her disdain, in Tony’s opinion. Just as Stark Industries’ role had come second to Wakanda’s in manufacturing the satellites, Tony had found himself relegated to assisting Shuri with the overall design. Playing second fiddle to a genius teenager was a situation he was perfectly calm and happy about, despite popular expectation. Rhodey had laughed until he cried. Something about karma.
His friend hesitated. “Thor almost got him, but… Not enough. Thanos disappeared through some sort of portal, and people started just… disintegrating.”
“I have a… There’s something I wanted to ask you for years, but it was never the right time… do you think… I mean, can now be good?” His voice sounded so wistful and lonely; through the haze Steve wondered what the question might be.
“Gotcha, Brucie bear,” Tony said, and ended the call. For the second time that day he stared at the little icon on his display, this time marveling at how, despite his utmost pessimism, life could always get worse. Then he clapped his hands and stepped up to address the crowd. And, by proxy, the entire watching world.
The pulsing light under Steve’s skin had relented, and the super-soldier was back on his feet, reaching for the Power Stone.
He dismissed the armor and crouched in place at the water’s edge, a position that thankfully concealed… the situation. They’d long perfected this maneuver after so many weeks of water duty. Steve lowered the container towards the water, Tony guided it towards the clearest water he could see, watching out for mud or small creatures. Once it was full, Steve pulled it out again. Simple. Ridiculous, really. It really didn’t take two people. Steve could do this blindfolded with one hand tied-
“I wanted to, Steve,” the other man whispered. “I would have, if I-”
His arrival in the waiting room was only minimally awkward, given the circumstances. Strange had apparently returned to the Sanctum arm in arm with their new ally, Carol, which was a minor disappointment given the number of questions Tony had for her, or really any glowing woman. Yet Wilson seemed genuinely relieved to see him back on his feet, and Tony was doubly pleased to receive just the usual wary Pym civility from Hope and sunny welcome from Scott.
He wondered now if that was the victory Zemo had envisioned. The trap was so clear, in hindsight. Almost beautiful in its way. And at every step, Steve had played his part of the perfect clockwork soldier, marching bravely and correctly, straight off a goddamn cliff. Without his immediate rejection of the Accords, he would have still been an Avenger after the bombing. He could have taken Bucky into protective custody with people he trusted, kept him far beyond Zemo’s reach. And without Steve’s lack of faith, Tony would have already known about his parents and not been blindsided by the video once they got to Siberia.
During, he felt shredded as a clay pigeon in a glass tornado; after, like his mind had been scraped slowly over a ocean of sandpaper; yet their redesign
When their adversary realizes he’s defeated, he sets the device to self-destruct. Tony pushes Steve out of the way and takes the full brunt of the resulting blast.
“-so you think he may have some connection to the Soul Stone,” Doctor Strange finished, his excitement no less.
“It’d help?”
Now Tony was the one struggling not to cry. “Too late, kid.”
Yet Tony was sinking lower in his chair. “But it wasn’t,” he whispered, “Steve, it- it wasn’t hard at all… I’m a fucking coward, I know, but I just
“I wanted you to know exactly what you broke,” Tony said, and the disdain was back in his eyes, and the terror was back in Steve’s throat, because these couldn’t be Tony’s words, no, there had to be some mistake,
him and his touch felt like summer and hope, giddy warmth radiating all the way through-
, near Steve. It’d be enough just to talk to him. Have Steve talk back. Ideally, enough so Tony could understand exactly what he’d done wrong; at least this time he had a fair idea of how badly he’d misread the whole situation, but verification was required, if only so he could make sure he never, ever did it again. But at this point, awkward small talk about the Wakandan sandwiches would do.
Tony sat down without ceremony, slapping Bruce’s knee as a greeting. The scientist nodded his way but both Shuri and Okoye - it turned out the General was from a farming background - were paying rapt attention to his words. With such an audience, nothing could break Bruce’s excited babble of observations thus far on Titan’s native flora and how its alien biology was reflected in the fauna they’d so far encountered, using the lumpy plant they were peeling as an example. Tony rolled his eyes; internally, because friends. But no one should be this excited over a space potato.
Too late, Steve realized the other conversation had fallen silent. Nat squeezed his arm in subtle apology, meaning his team-mates had definitely been listening for a while. Anger flared within him but faded just as quickly, snuffed out by his awareness of the grief recently spent on his behalf. Besides, if his mistakes were affecting the team, he owed them a chance to speak.
“But that’s insane, he
, Tony learned. And Steve tasted
Alternative hypothesis: impossible as Tony was, maybe sometime in the last six months, he’d grown on the man. Possibly, if improbably, in ways that came with words connected to feelings of the L variety.
“Why do I
Steve couldn’t breathe at all.
“So you left again.” Everything about the past two years was making a new, horrible, upside-down sense. “And you never really came back.”
“Mr Stark, are you okay?”
, not the wizard.
“Okay, so if there’s no more fighting…” Steve paused, frowned. Trying to give an answer, just because Tony had asked. This man. “I just don’t know what else there is to want. I think the problem is I don’t really want anything. Not in a way that matters. Nothing but you, of course. But that wouldn’t work, would it? Making my whole life revolve around you?”
Tony kept his jaw stubbornly clamped shut. Since Steve so clearly didn’t want to think about that particular ramification, then Tony sure as hell wasn’t going to talk about it. Besides, it obviously didn’t mean what they thought it meant, what even Tony had thought it meant for one glorious, stupid second. Steve was the kind of radiant soul who would love a dog he’d just rescued from a tree. Didn’t make Tony special.
Tony smirked. “Modified EMP I’ve been working on. Kinda of a bitch to get right without the circuits catching fire.” He glanced over to where there was already smoke pouring from one of the basement vents. “Oops.”
“On it, boss,” the AI answered. Tony took the opportunity to walk over to the wide window, admiring the summer sprawl of the ivy outside, his thoughts drifting towards the evening. A discreet chime brought his attention back into the room. “Incoming call from Peter Parker,” Friday announced.
okay?” he asked.
fault-”
Yet it is. Vision stands before him, yellow life restored to his brow. Not a gem. His glow now radiates from within, steady and free. Yellow, tinged with orange. “Yes,” Vision says, mild as ever. “The Mind Stone has moved on, but has granted me life in its absence.” Wanda at his side looks equal parts teary-eyed and exultant. The android hesitates, frowns. “I have also been given a message for you, Captain Rogers. Short, but nonetheless meaningful, I hope.”
At her words, Tony took a long, sobbing breath, crumpling in against Steve’s side. Thinking quickly, Steve swung the smaller man into his arms and returned to the far couches, the others following hesitantly.
- came through; the secondary team then departed for Norway, carrying a modified tracker that stated Steve Rogers was on board. Tony watched the Quinjet take off, then turned to Steve.
“Speed, strength, healing, all physical measurements showed drastic improvement, far beyond the range of normal human activity. And to a lesser extent, there was a boost to mental acuity, memory retention, cognitive processing. His subsequent training improved the numbers even further, but by every measure I can think of, the herb made him superhuman overnight.” Shuri dismissed the displayed numbers and glanced at Steve. “Any of this sounding familiar?”
Again, Red Skull paused before replying, and the sound of the wind rang through the silence like a warning. “Complete the journey to the summit, and I will answer all of your questions.” The others looked as shocked as Tony felt. There was possibly nothing waiting for them ahead but a trap, yet the possibility of retrieving the Soul Stone was too urgent a temptation. Therefore they had nothing to discuss; after a couple of glances, they fell in beside each other and followed the faceless man along the last stretch of the trail.
“Crack the formula? Yeah, probably.” Tony spread his hands. “But then give it to who? The Army? SHIELD? Fury was already hounding me to hand over Extremis after I helped Pepper. At least DC changed his mind on that one. Imagine an army of Rumlows breathing fire. Uh, no thanks.”
Steve frowned. “Of course.”
Tony could only stare, wondering how he could ever have believed the other man looked
you’ve done justifies him hurting you-”
you.”
“No, it’s fine, I just…” He shook his head. “I definitely think you scared the shit out of him, if that was the plan.”
With every passing moment, Steve has felt the day approaching, yet when he wakes that morning, he finds he cannot breathe with the shock of it. He sits with the ache, uses every single trick he’s learned, and slowly he summons the will to rise. He makes it out of the cabin, to the spot by the large rock. By the lake.
The idea hung in the air like a rung bell, and Steve found every nerve in his body thrilling at the prospect of direct action. But a few feet away, Tony was looking crushed, and after a moment, Steve could understand why. Switching the plan now meant throwing out weeks of frantic work. Meant maybe weeks of wasted time. Which meant needless lives lost. Misery beyond measure.
Ty didn’t reply, but Tony could hear him breathing. “Party of the century,” the other man said eventually. “Yeah, right. More likely weak beer and a pig on a spit. Yet given the cause, I suppose we should at least show our faces.”
,” Steve breathed, clearly still floating down from his wonder high. Plus, hungry Steve was never the sharpest Steve.
Tony dismissed the front of his helmet but retained his sunglasses display, gesturing for everyone to calm down. “Hi Thor,” he said cheerfully, loud enough so the cameras could at least pick up his side of the conversation. “Welcome back to Earth. Been a minute.” His words sent a ripple of visible relief through the crowd.
Before he can knock, Steve opens the door, but instead of saying anything the man just raises a single damn eyebrow at him, the beard even more glorious than Tony remembers-
Tony broke off, panting for breath. He hugged his knees closer to his chest; a small, wounded gesture.
“Yes,” Tony breathed, when he pulled back, Steve looking at him wide-eyed. “Your question. From before. My answer is yes.” He waited for Steve to recall, his own heart aching at the memory; the soft longings spilled in the night.
“…huh. And can I take it that applies vice-versa?” Bucky asked.
Steve held him close, sending silent wishes to every star in the endless sky.
to know…” Tony said, then trailed off, because… maybe not?
Tony bent over, retching. He felt Steve grab his shoulders, a grip too tight for calm.
Steve looked upset at that. “I always enjoyed your company, Tony. I’m sorry if it ever felt like I didn’t. I really… I just didn’t want to get too close.”
?” Tony asked for the third time since their arrival, the words erupting despite his obvious efforts to contain them.
And then he was nothing.
“Language,” the other man admonished him without stopping what he was doing, and Tony heard himself giggle- oh, and
There is no one to feel the shattering of his heart when he somehow takes a wrong turn and glimpses him from afar through a window, warm and vibrant and
“I should never have involved him in Avengers business,” Tony said. “I’m so sorry, he’s just a kid, he shouldn’t have to deal with any of this-”
Tony turned to find himself under sharp-eyed scrutiny from Rocket, but the raccoon merely shrugged. “I guess I have some time to waste. Lead on, fancy genius.”
“It’s small but it’s quiet,” she explained. “And I thought he might prefer some privacy.”
Yet there was no pain, no chaos, no suffering this time. He just opened his eyes to find the same alien sky, but now, he and Tony were not alone. Nearby, the hulking form of Thanos loomed over a small, green-skinned girl. Steve would have assumed she was the Soul Stone’s current form except they both seemed so confused to see them.
“Fuck language,” Steve said, but the nickname had summoned its namesake’s cold judgment and so he sat up, moved away reluctantly but of his own volition, and looked around for Nebula. The android was standing a distance away, her back turned discreetly. “We need to get back to Titan-”
Steve’s smile deepened. “Alright.”
Doctor Strange coughed once. “For long, complicated reasons I don’t wish to explain, Earth will need to keep the Time Stone intact or face other, worse, annihilations,” he said. The monk, Wong, nodded confirmation. “And as far as is practicable, I must stay at my post in New York for similar reasons-”
The problems ease. Sleep, orders the Queen. The Captain lies where they put him, stares at the ceiling until they get him. More team. Thor’s not eating. The Captain speaks, and problems ease. His throat bleeds, but the serum. Problems ease. He stares, where they put him. They get him. He speaks.
“He’s… not quite himself.” Wong sounded odd. Worried?
here?” he asked, sounding more hostile than he’d intended.
He broke off at the ugly flare of rage on Tony’s face.
“I- Steve, I don’t-” He couldn’t find the words to refuse.
May crossed her arms. “You know that’s not how it works, Tony. Happy told me you were poisoned, that there was permanent damage. You shouldn’t have been drinking at all.”
Steve was reaching for him now, was frowning at Tony’s own shirt, had grabbed a handful of the fabric near the neck. “May I?” he asked; Tony nodded, neither knowing nor caring what he was agreeing to because the mannerliness of the request paired with the wild look in Steve’s eyes was giving him heart feelings mixed with dick feelings and they really did go together nicely in a wine and cheese sort of a-
“Yes,” Tony said, and how fitting that their last conversation was an argument. He raised his voice. “The price is a life, right? So I do this, Steve gets the Stone. That’s the bargain.”
Yet he had no time to waste on speculation. If he didn’t act now, Tony would leave without him and probably never think about him again-
On their way out, Steve's enhanced ears picked up Thor’s booming voice greeting Clint and Bruce. The two scavengers had returned triumphant, Clint bearing armfuls of snacks, Bruce with a full tray of coffee and sandwiches, which they set on a table a the far end of the room.
“Don’t you
He had rules.
The hospital staff were well drilled; everyone in the small canteen calmly dispersed, though not without a few confused glances in his direction. Their confusion should have mattered, but Tony couldn’t seem to feel anything. He just sat, staring at nothing, thoughts sparking wild as a damaged circuit. He was aware of May and Peter exchanging worried glances over his bowed head, but somehow that didn’t matter either.
bad at waiting.
The super-soldier had stormed forward, was arguing about trading lives and unjust bargains. Tony caught Nebula’s eye, something in his expression drawing her over to his side.
“Tony,” Steve panted in his ear, “can I ask you something-” but Tony seized Steve’s face between his hands and kissed him quiet, still. Holy and deep.
Something about him asking made Tony want to cry. Instead, he just stepped towards the other man, who gathered him close, gentle and sure.
Colors.
Behind him, Wilson called through the portal. “You ready to go, Stark?”
“Where?” Tony managed to ask.
The billionaire nodded, slower than Steve would like but he’d take it. The super-soldier let his hands drop, suddenly aware his grip had grown too strong again, would probably leave bruises. Careless.
It’s the cruelty of the god’s lie that takes his breath away all over again, that burns worse than the shame of his failure.
“Captain Rogers is in the main lab,” the AI replied, but Tony already knew. The Stones.
“Agreed,” Sam said softly.
“Yes.”
“Gone where?” he asked.
“More like a tube,” Dr Palmer explained. “The machine will breathe for you so your own lungs can rest. But it won’t hurt, you’ll be sedated first.”
This place had never felt like home.
“Although I applaud your intention, please understand, if you proceed I can guarantee neither your survival nor success,” the Soul Stone said, delicate but blunt. “Are you willing to risk everything, perhaps for nothing?”
The other man seemed subdued, but he nodded. “Yeah. You need to eat?”
hi, thanks for making it all the way through this fic!
“Not yet,” he said, and plucked the Soul Stone out of the air. It felt cool to the touch despite its glow, so he stowed it in a zipped pocket on his chest and turned to Nebula. “Take us back to Titan,” the Captain said. Instead of complying, the android looked at Stark. Allegiance. Possible interference. The Captain waited. At Stark’s nod, she opened the portal; he motioned for the two of them to proceed, so the Captain was the last to step through.
The thing was, it could always get worse, with Ty. And Tony knew that. He should have been
The crisis intervention teams were in good shape, having run several difficult missions each since the Devastation. In contrast, the lab crew were relatively sloppy after long weeks of inaction, but a further ten days of drills brought them back up to fighting speed. After Shuri began running nightly healing sessions on the whole team, Steve pushed them harder than Tony would have thought possible.
“Nice backup plan,” Steve commented, sounding amused.
His mood plummeted further when the Starkphone in his hand began to ring directly, sending his heart rate racing in horrified reaction.
“I’m so sorry,” she said. “I ran the tests myself, three times. Your immune system has been dormant since the serum was administered in the 1940s. Unfortunately, that means your current immune response is nonexistent. Your body is just not able to handle the modern era without the serum’s assistance.”
Two weeks later, he is saying goodbye by the lake, and he is still cold, still sinking. Sam is cheerful but Bucky’s eyes are soft in the morning light. He knows. Of course he knows. But Steve Rogers has one last mission to do, and that is how he steps up to the platform and leaves this cold, empty future behind.
Remarkably, Nebula did not flinch, but only raised her chin higher. “Me,” she said, hatred and satisfaction mingling in her voice. And then she reached down, twisted the ax and dragged it from his chest. Thanos howled once in outrage, then again in animal despair, but all his renowned strength, all of his foul will could not delay the inevitable rush of life from his body. They watched, silent, as the Mad Titan took one last tormented breath, then fell still.
“Alright, Azkaban,” Tony said, glaring at the faceless man. “You promised us answers, so maybe start with explaining why Thanos would send the Stone back here to you? He tapping you in on the tag team of misery?”
“Purple guy? Big chin?” Tony added.
Tony, who had been keeping his hands raised oddly in the air, now wriggled his fingers. “Double scrubbed, double gloved.”
“Is Peter okay?” was his next question, the guilt souring his stomach.
But then sure fingers were brushing against Steve’s cheek; Tony, gently wiping away his tears. Turning Steve’s face up to meet his dark, inscrutable gaze.
But in the end, he knew, they would.
For a second, Tony looked confused, then he snorted a laugh. “Oh, you mean- no, that’s May Parker. Peter’s aunt. Pretty sure she hates me, really.”
Tony closed his eyes. “Who?”
“Okay, Fri, send it off, wrap everything up,” Tony said. “Then engage bunker mode for the next twelve hours. Anything short of an apocalypse, I don’t want to hear it. Some of us have important business to attend to.”
The same fight, over and over. Tony was so tired. “It’s part of my fucking
He wasn’t empty anymore, he was-
By the time the shaking had eased to the odd tremor, he was able to hear the words Tony had been repeating quietly in his ear. “Easy, Steve, I’ve got you. Just talk to me, please. Tell me what you need.”
The other man reared back, aghast. “God, no, that’s not what I-”
“Are you afraid of him?”
Peace, Steve thought. Home, and peace.
Tony shook his head. “If there’s a body.” In his head, red planet, red suit. “No one should face that alone.” He didn’t know the words, couldn’t think through how to say it, to make Steve understand. Bad breeze. Empty echoes.
He is not prepared to see Natasha before him, alive and well and horrified at the sight of him.
“Who among you now seeks the Stone?” the faceless man asked.
They got out of the car, Steve carefully securing his shield on his back, Tony’s nerves shrieking with awareness at every step. Ty would see…
They were out of time.
Wrong-wrong-nothing-gone: “NO!”
, Steve thought sadly.
“Think of it like a screen-saver,” the Doctor said, then stood. “Lunch?”
been his idea, and, well. Hate was easier, he knew.
Confidentiality was the second issue. If they made the mission official, they would have to file reports on every step as the Accords dictated. Yet without that official support, their actions would be considered legally dubious at best, criminal at worst. The irony was not lost on Steve that Tony was asking them to break the very rules he’d once argued for. Tony neither, it seemed; he kept emphasizing that the mission was volunteer only, no hard feelings for anyone who didn’t want to participate.
The billionaire scoffed. “Joke’s on the world, then.” He raised his other hand to brush at his eyes, then turned towards Steve, attempting a smile and failing miserably. “You gonna do your koala thing now or what?”
Rhodey pinned him with a cutting stare. “Maybe there was ‘something’ that should have happened. Maybe the ‘problem’ is that it didn’t.” Airquotes. Really?
“In 3, 2, 1…”
The other man paused. “Always,” he said; then he cleared his throat, playfully tapped on a small angry scar on Tony’s shoulder, voice teasing. “Now this one, I don’t know. Do I even want to ask, or…?”
Steve pushed aside the oxygen mask and grabbed Tony’s bare hand, clutching it to his lips in a kiss that felt like a prayer.
“-did he say he’s cold?”
“If he does, he didn’t show it,” Tony said, but his thoughts were racing. “Not to me, anyway.” Which hurt, a lot, because Tony had been consistently open about his bisexuality his whole adult life, certainly the whole time he’d known Steve. After the Accords fallout, he’d actually wondered if that had maybe offended the super-soldier’s old-fashioned sensibilities, had been another of his oblivious transgressions that had kept Steve apart from him, adding yet another issue to the list of topics which deserved a direct conversation between them.
His thoughts had cooled enough to let him consider the whole situation. It really was unfair of him to ask Tony to sit with him like this. Steve remembered his own ordeal all too well; how the empty hours would stretch on and on, the inescapable fear settling into his bones. The resentment he’d felt, watching his mother sink away into her pain, her silence offering no comfort. No hope.
Without missing a beat, the kid slowed his words to something more befitting a stoned whale. “I s-a-i-d oh-my-g-o-d-To-n-yyy, d-i-d-youu…”
The super-soldier sighed, and they sat a while more.
Steve’s eyes had turned a stormy blue.
Steve had turned his head and was watching Tony think, his expression tight. Tense. Waiting for the verdict, Tony thought. He took Steve’s hand in his, raised his knuckles to his lips. Devastating. Simple. True. But fuck it. “You have me now,” he said. At the very least, they would fail together.
“Sayonara, Spiderama,” Tony said, but clearly Peter was
Steve was seething beyond sense, giddy with the eruption of long-dormant resentments. “-because I may be back to useless but I don’t need your goddamn
Steve’s heart lurched, hopeless, when Tony flinched away from his touch, had to gather his nerve before swinging back to meet Steve’s gaze. His stricken brown eyes, for once unguarded, exposed Tony as Steve had never seen him before. No masks, no humor. No protection.
The sight of Steve in the bed hit Tony like a repulsor blast to the gut. The heavy shadows under the man’s eyes were the only real hint his face allowed of the massive trauma he had suffered. It would be so easy to pretend Steve was just sleeping. But beneath the sheets and tubes his body looked… frail. Incomplete. Not
Tony snapped his hanging mouth shut. “Uh, who says you were invited?”
“How are you
The former assassin shrugged. “How about reading order? Nakia had
“You sure? Blond hair. Blue eyes. Seems exactly your type.”
“Better?” the billionaire asked softly.
The other man leaned in low, breath hot on his cheek. “Tony Stark,” he murmured, almost a growl. “May I please fuck your ass?”
Shuri rolled her eyes and brought up some rapidly scrolling data from her wrist interface. “You’ll sit until I say otherwise, Stark. That was a nasty kebab impression you had going on. Plus whose idiotic idea was it to use my nanobots as an internal bandage?”
