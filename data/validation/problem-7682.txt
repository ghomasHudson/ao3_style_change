“Wilson leave my son alone, he’s smarter at fifteen than you could ever hope to be.” Tony pulls Peter to safety away from Sam.
It’s a text from Harry:
Peter expects it to take much longer for everything involved with the adoption to start moving than it does. But he supposes when Tony Stark is involved that this is how quickly most things happen when you’re a billionaire and a superhero. It only takes a day for all of the adoption paper work to be signed and confirmed by the relevant children’s boards and the like.
“What can I say? You bagged the sweetest man on the planet.” Tony’s grin widens as Steve continues placing kisses along his jaw and down his neck.
“Hang on, they tell you that you’re a hassle to them?” Mr. Stark questions in a tone that makes Peter realise he was the one putting the Baker’s in their place earlier. “From everything we have read about you, and trust me kid we’ve read a lot, I’ve never once seen the words ‘trouble maker’ appear. Would you agree Stevie?” He looks over to Steve who nods in agreement, his brow furrowed in confusion. “I’m definitely going to be having a word with that nice social worker of yours about that couple.” Mr. Stark trails off, muttering under his breath about how the pair are supposed to be care givers and what a rotten job they are doing, Peter could not agree more.
Peter smiles at that, unable to resist Harry’s easy charm. “I was studying for a while, but then, erm, let’s just say a change of scenery was greatly needed.” Harry just nods.
Peter sees Harry waiting for him near the gate as he always does on a Monday. While Peter is at Decathlon the other boy gets tutored for Physics, which he hates but the tutoring is part of the agreement that allows him to attend Midtown.
There’s a heavy silence between them as they look at the pictures of Richard and Mary Parker.
Ned scratches the back of his neck awkwardly. “Erm, yeah. I just wanted you to be comfortable and you were covered in blood and ash from that burning building.” The news about the explosion had been all over the television with footage showing Spider-Man struggling to escape the burning wreck.
Ned shrugs slightly. “You were staring at her for like the entirety of practice.”
Harry lets out a barking laugh. “I wish I could’ve seen that.”
Peter swallows before speaking, not trusting his own voice at this moment. “A bit shaky still, but better. Thanks.” He smiles slightly at the two men trying to reassure them both.
His parents are curled up on the couch together when Peter wanders over to join them. One of the Harry Potter movies, Peter isn’t sure which, is playing on the TV and Steve is utterly engrossed.
Steeling himself for the conversation that is about to take place Peter leaves the safety of his bedroom and pads down the hallway towards the kitchen.
The competition goes way better than anyone could have expected and they beat the other team easily. After the winner is announced parents storm the stage to congratulate their kids, Peter pulls out his phone expecting to see congratulations texts from Steve and Tony as the whole thing was being broadcast on TV. There are a few from Sam, Bucky, Bruce and Natasha but nothing from his dads.
Apparently, Nick Fury had personally asked for Peter to be present. Tony and Steve were completely opposed, wishing to keep their son as far away from Avengers-related business as possible, but what Director Fury wants Director Fury gets.
“Nice to meet you, Sam Wilson.” Peter takes the outstretched hand and greets Sam in return. “I’m gonna hang around for a few days before I go back to DC is that cool?” He turns back to Steve and Tony.
Also, has anyone been watching WandaVision? I'm utterly obsessed. It's nice to have new Marvel content again after almost two years of nothing!
Harry’s breath ghosts over Peter’s face as he continues to sing along so softly that if there were other people in the room only Peter would be able to hear him. Harry smells faintly of tobacco and cologne and once again Peter finds himself captivated by the boy. Frozen and staring as Harry’s eyes slowly close and he leans in just a bit closer so that their lips are pressed together lightly.
Peter and Harry offer to do the dishes and are mid-way through when Harry’s phone rings. He signals to Peter that he’ll be a second before walking off to take the call. When he returns there’s a smile on his face that causes Peter’s breath to catch in his throat a little. “So, you know how I am the most amazing friend you have?”
Getting back into the swing of being Spider-Man takes Peter a bit longer. Not only does he still carry guilt about not being able to save Uncle Ben, there’s now the added crushing weight of thinking that if he had just decided to stay out a bit longer, to swing home and climb in through his window rather than changing and coming in through the front door, that maybe he could have saved his Aunt May.
“Peter, may we have a word?” Mr. Baker asks one night after dinner. Peter knows by now that when they ask to speak to him like this it’s usually to shout at him for something. Normally because he’s been loud when having nightmares, or because he sometimes shuts himself in the bathroom while having panic attacks, preventing others from using it. This time however the prickle on the back of Peter’s neck tells him that something is different.
Peter and Ned sit down beside Tony at the end of the large kitchen table, Clint and Nat sat directly across from them. Steve and Bucky are last to join them, both wandering into the room laughing at something unknown to everyone else. Steve claps a hand on Peter’s shoulder in greeting and takes the seat beside his husband.
As the room swims into focus Peter finally begins to feel in control again. His breathing returns to a regular pace as he focuses in on Tony’s words.
Steve nods. “Absolutely sir. Tony has been tracking it for weeks now.” Tony launches into an explanation of the tracking process and notable points of activity over the past few months. Eventually he hands over to Bruce who discusses the energy signals the tech is giving off which confirms it to be alien.
Some other questions are just strange; do you lay eggs? I don’t think so… Can you control other spiders? I’ve never even considered that. Are you going to grow extra legs? Fairly certain that would have happened already, so no.
Peter decides to head to bed not much later, he bids Tony and Steve goodnight before heading to the guest room.
“Whoa couple of smart guys then. You better watch out Tony, your kid’s gonna be giving you a run for your money in a few years.”
As the room fills with Avengers waiting for Fury to video-call into the meeting Peter’s anxiety levels slowly start to rise as he over-thinks the possibility of Nick Fury knowing his identity.
Were Bucky and Sam right?
If the confused looks on Ned’s face were wide and comical before, they are nothing compared to the way his eyes bug out of his head when Peter casually strolls into the Avengers tower.
There are a few tense minutes of silence, Michelle goes back to her book and the boys stare at nothing, patiently waiting for the other team members to arrive. Eventually the library door swings open again letting in the rest of their team and Mr. Harrington.
“How are we this afternoon Petey-pie?” Tony walks into Peter’s floor and wraps him in a one-armed hug, the other preoccupied with a tablet full of files he is reading. Peter realised quite quickly that Tony gives everyone nicknames, several of them, however Petey-pie seems to be one he’s pretty much settled on for Peter. “Tower’s about to get a whole lot busier, so I thought I would come and get you so that you can be properly introduced to the rest of the team.”
“Harry!” Squeal two girls who run full speed towards the boy and practically tackle him to the ground. The three teens fall into rapid conversation that Peter can barely keep up with, so he hangs by awkwardly trying not to look out of place.
“Kid, c’mon, we’ve been over this.” Tony points at himself. “Hello? Billionaire. I like spending money on you, that’s the whole point of having a kid, spoiling them.” Peter practically bounces over to Tony enveloping him in a tight hug. “Whoa, strong grip. You tryna strangle me?” Peter blushes and eases up having forgotten himself in his excitement.
“Or there’s a few spare rooms on Cap and I’s floor, which you’re more than welcome to. Whatever makes you feel comfortable kid.”
His mood does lift slightly when both of his adoptive parents engulf him in a hug as soon as he steps out of the elevator. They weren’t due to be home until later that night so it is a nice surprise to have them home earlier. They catch up about Peter’s day at school and how the mission was, which Peter personally thinks is far more interesting than how his English exam went.
Peter sings along loudly to the song blaring through the workshop speaker. He’s not usually the type for singing but he’s the only one currently residing in the space and he’s gotten to know some of Tony’s favourite songs quite well over the last few weeks.
His old apartment building is flashing on screen before he even really knows what is happening, flames billowing out of the top. And all of a sudden he’s back there on that night watching it happen from afar. Rushing over to find out that he’s lost his last living relative.
If you catch the reference for the band name let me know ;)
Peter is aware that he’s smart, he’s been told his whole life that he has a level intelligence way beyond that of a regular kid his age. But he’s never been one to show off about it. May and Ben always refused whenever the idea of their nephew skipping a grade or two was brought up at parent-teacher conferences, insistent that Peter should experience school the same way every other child does.
“Okay so there’s a fully stocked bar with servers, who I paid heavily to serve to minors so take advantage, and Peter you remember where the bathrooms are, right?” He nods “Great, I’ll catch up with you guys in a bit, hosting duties call!” And just like that Harry has disappeared into the crowd and from sight.
“No kiddo it’s all good. I just thought you might want to ask Ned to come over here, to build your new Millennium Falcon with you.”
Peter’s slightly shocked, he wasn’t sure if he could go as far as to invite his friend over to the tower, he had planned on meeting Ned in a nearby park to tell him. “Would that be okay?”
“In here!” He calls back, playing dumb.
Thankfully Harry’s friends from the concert, Liz and Gwen, appear at Peter’s side and pull the trio into the fold of the party. A cup containing something that is definitely not soda is pushed into his hand by Liz, but unlike his two friends Peter decides not to drink. He’s fairly certain his increased metabolism means he can’t get drunk but right now doesn’t feel like the best time to test that theory.
Harry stays still showing no signs of budging, so Peter attempts to break the tension. He steps forward with a hand extended. “Peter Parker, sir.”
Decathlon practice always passes quickly and soon they’re putting tables back and tidying away the chairs.
Peter lifts his arms above his head to stretch out all of his sore muscles and catches sight of the sport where the Green Goblin’s blade had caught him. Thankfully the cut has faded quite a bit over night and doesn’t look any worse than a bad graze at this point.
In this exact moment Peter has a lot of sympathy for Ned when he first met the Avengers. He’s truly speechless.
As his fingers grace the keys Peter can see the way the music flows out of Harry effortlessly. He’s beginning to think that there isn’t a single place on earth that Harry would look like he didn’t belong.
The song switched, now playing Placebo’s 20
Peter pushes Harry’s hand off and takes a few steps back from the railing. “What’s your problem?” The hard edge is back in the blonde boy’s voice.
Despite himself Peter allows his eyes to slip shut mirroring Harry. The blonde boy presses forward slightly increasing the pressure so there’s no denying the fact that they’re kissing.
Steve suggests that they should watch a movie together when they’ve finished tidying everything away so they head to the common floor which has the biggest screen for movie watching. They’re settled and about to start the film when Peter’s phone buzzes. It’s a text from Ned asking where he’s supposed to meet him tomorrow.
The panic he felt thinking that Steve and Tony might have known that he is Spider-Man has essentially disappeared. Nothing has been said, aside from Peter’s one slip up a few days ago, that suggests either of the pair suspect anything and he is content to keep it that way. The thought that telling Tony and Steve could actually help him had crossed Peter’s mind a few times, but in the end, he had always reached the conclusion that the pair would probably try and get him to stop being Spider-Man, which could absolutely not happen.
Peter moves first swinging out towards Natasha’s torso which she dodges easily, ducking under his fist to grab his shoulder so that she can spin him around. She aims the next hit for his face hoping to speed this process up, if she doesn’t go all in she’ll never reach any conclusions.
Peter takes a deep breath, steadying himself for a minute before he feels able to talk again. “So, you’re here to possibly adopt me because you feel guilty about what happened to my Aunt May?” There’s a feeling of anger settling deep inside Peter’s gut, not directed at Mr. Stark and Mr. Rogers, anger that he didn’t know the full story behind what happened that night. Anger knowing that all of these months he could have been looking for those people selling the weapons, trying to take them down, being able to do something that would actually avenge the death of his Aunt.
Someone, Sam, clears their throat causing the two boys to break their gaze. Peter blushes furiously realising every person in the room just watched him stare deeply into his new friend’s eyes.
Peter feels a bit misty eyed and can’t prevent a few tears escaping and rolling down his cheeks. Steve just smiles at him and gently wipes them away without a word.
“Perhaps one of the other children we care for would be a better fit for you?” Peter’s blood boils listening to Mr and Mrs Baker trying to stop something potentially good happening for him. He isn’t even sure that he wants to be adopted, but Peter reasons that it has to be better than living here for any longer.
Steve rolls his eyes at Bucky’s words. “Buck, don’t call women dames.” He rises and walks closer to his son. “He’s somewhat right though Peter, come here.” Steve takes up a stance, legs shoulder width apart and arms raised. When Peter doesn’t move he gestures to his son. “Come on.”
“Whoa, language.” Harry jokes.
in love. “we are all set; they’ll be expecting us within the next few days.”
Peter is really hoping to get to the Decathlon final without any more confrontations with friends or family members, but as per usual, he doesn’t get his way.
Harry makes the whole situation easier than Peter could have hoped for. He’s barely finished telling his friend that Richard worked at OSCORP when an invitation has already been extended to visit the company at the weekend.
When he gets to school Peter spots Ned waiting at his locker for him, and surprisingly enough Harry is with him. It was nice having someone else to talk to and sit with in the classes he doesn’t share with Ned but Peter figured Harry would have found more interesting and cooler people to spend time with.
The Green Goblin pulls out two small sliver disks and sets them spinning towards Peter. As they get closer he can see that there are four blades pointing out of the disks in all directions. The Goblin keeps firing them at a rapid pace and Peter has never been more grateful that his Spidey-sense allows him to see oncoming targets as if they were in slow motion.
Hello! I hope you enjoyed reading. Leaving some kudos or a comment would be greatly appreciated, thank you <3
When the teen finally comes to its dark outside and he can feel the hunger eating away at his insides. He asks JARVIS what the dinner situation is and is pleased to hear that no one has eaten yet, in fact Steve has just started cooking.
“Indeed it is my astute offspring.” Tony beams at him. “Perhaps not my most impressive work, but it’s the little things.”
adopted me might shock you.” At least Peter might get to see a different expression on the girl’s face when he tells her.
Once back in New York Peter sets about finding out every possible thing he can about his dad’s work. But there isn’t much information available to the public. There are a handful of articles which are cause him an intense amount of pain, describing the accident which killed his parents in frightening detail. He knows he should just skip these but information on his dad is so scarce that he’s afraid to let anything pass by unnoticed.
“Damn, I let it slip too soon. Sorry Stevie I ruined your big reveal.”
Peter is seated comfortably on the couch between Tony and Thor contentedly listening to Thor regaling the group with an impressive battle story.
“Peter!” He keeps walking despite hearing Harry clearly. “Pete, come on please stop.” They’re outside of the Tower now. “Look I’m sorry I was being a total dick.”
------
“Peter! Come on! How do you not know this song?” Harry is standing beside the record player, having just switched out The Smiths for Steve Harley and Cockney Rebel’s ‘Make Me Smile’. “I’m beginning to think Tony is right, you really do need lessons in music taste.”
They start at the Mark Twain house, which was MJ’s personal request as team captain, and then move onto the science centre. It’s all your basic generic stuff that every science centre has; a human body exhibit, the solar system, and something involving weather.
At first, he’s so focused on getting his dinner that he doesn’t notice Bucky sitting at the kitchen island but his Spidey-sense picks up on the soldier’s presence fairly quickly. Peter reminds himself to act surprised when Bucky finally breaks with silence with a “Hi.” He even jumps slightly for effect.
When Peter gets back to the tower he decides to go straight down to Tony’s workshop instead of going to his own floor.
A split second before it happens Peter’s spider sense clues him into the impending attack. He flips onto the roof behind him just as a small device collides with the fire escape sending the structure crashing to the ground.
“Debatable, but continue.”
“Yep, should be fairly easy. You know what? I’ll come find you, you’re not far away.” The boy on the other end of the phone thanks Peter profusely and hangs up.
Peter blushes, dropping Dr. Banner’s hand from the handshake which definitely lasted too long. “Well yeah… I just, um, read them for fun?” Bruce is still staring at him disbelievingly.
He’s basically just sent the message when Bucky replies.
At dinner that night Tony decides to breach the subject of Mr and Mrs Baker, asking Peter wat exactly happened during his time at the foster home to cause the couple to speak of him in such a negative way. Peter explains that he had developed a bad habit of sneaking out, and that his loud nightmares and frequent panic attacks hadn’t exactly made him popular.
Tony takes a seat on the stool beside Peter now turning to face the boy fully. “Speaking of duty kid, it looks like there’s an Avengers level issue happening across the seas. So, Steve and I are gonna have to leave you for a few days. Bucky, Bruce and Natasha are staying here, so that will foil any plans you have to throw a wild party.” Tony winks at him, humour bright in his eyes.
“Hey MJ.” Ned greets her taking a brief pause from his debate, she half smiles in response.
“Hi Peter, erm, I’m not sure honestly.” There’s a distinct tone of uncertainty in Harry’s voice. “I followed the directions but I think something went wrong.”
“Okay I need to go start getting everything ready, and you need to let everyone else know. Peter,” The boy looks up at Tony, pretending he hasn’t been listening in this whole time. “we have something exciting to talk to you about, but right now we need to go and put some things in order, so can we schedule a conversation for after dinner?”
This seems to appease Mr Osborn somewhat. He encourages Peter to help himself to the medical journals lining the walls, and despite it being exactly what he’s looking for Peter puts up a protest. “I assume you attend the same school as my son Mr Parker, and unlike him, I’m assuming you have the same knack for science that Richard did. So please be my guest. Richard was not only a colleague but a friend. He would want you to have them.” He agrees after that desperately trying not to smile in triumph. “I’ll leave you now. Harry don’t con my staff out of access to areas you don’t have clearance for ever again.” He turns on his heel and strides from the room in the same fashion he entered.
Tony rests his head on top of Peter’s, pulling him into a tighter hug. “We’re here now. You don’t have to be alone anymore.”
“What do you think Peter?”
The pair watch him go with fond expressions. “We got lucky didn’t we?” Tony says to his husband, reaching over to hold his hand.
The look on Harry’s face is priceless but he doesn’t question anything until they’re in the elevator.
(See the end of the chapter for
When they finish chatting in their family bubble Steve wraps a comforting arm around Peter’s shoulders and walks him into the main area. At that point Peter realises there are far more people here than usual. “Remember how we told you we had a surprise for you?” Peter nods in response to Steve’s question, how could he not? He’s been trying to figure out what it could be all day. “Well it got a bit out of hand and a few more people turned up than we expected.”
Once again Harry’s coolness astounds Peter who is far too awkward for his own good in every situation, even in his own home. The boys settle in against the couch to watch what JARVIS has selected for them, It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia.
A few months ago, Peter never would have believed he could have a happy family unit again. He felt like the gaping hole Aunt May left would never be filled. Yet here he is surrounded by people who love and care for him.
“Hmm. Is that so?”
Peter and MJ navigate the new developments between them. Harry is being moody. Steve and Tony win a bet.
Peter is captivated by the sight of Harry, long legs pressed up against one wall, back slouched, the sun hitting his face as he takes a drag. Breaking his gaze away he moves to sit on the floor against the bed where Harry’s English notes lie forgotten.
Peter can feel the anger bubbling up inside of him. “What is your problem? You’ve been weird with me ever since I asked MJ out on a date.”
“Hey hey hey, before you throw that,” Peter raises his hands attempting to buy himself some time by chatting with his new foe. “wanna tell me why you’re chasing me around the rooftops of Queens?”
Tony is about as helpful as Peter thought he would be, suggesting that he stroll into school the next day and find another girl to ask so that it will make MJ jealous. “Gotta treat ‘em mean to keep ‘em keen Pete.” Natasha, Steve and Bucky all take turns hitting the billionaire for that one.
“I’m really sorry I upset you both. If it’s any comfort at all, I don’t wanna drink ever again. I feel awful.”
“Well, this is me.” Harry rests a hand on Peter’s shoulder, causing the brunette’s breathing to hitch something he really hopes Harry didn’t notice. “I had a really nice time Peter, thank you for letting me into your world.” He pulls Peter into a hug that doesn’t last nearly as long as he wishes it would, and then Harry’s stepping into the rain and getting into his car to drive off.
In response to his husbands words Tony gives an impressive eye roll then stands from the couch. “My turn. I never have any problems getting it up, isn’t that right Spangles.” Peter wants the ground to open up and swallow him whole. Everyone but Steve is howling with laughter now.
------
Thankfully Steve comes to his rescue and diffuses the situation further. “Good try Peter, I guess none of us are worthy eh Thor?”
Peter smirks slightly pleased to hear that other people have the same reaction to the awful couple as he does.
She also knows pop culture references almost as well as Peter does, and his pop culture knowledge is something he takes a great deal of pride in so he considers the fact MJ could rival him very impressive indeed.
“Sup Penis? You went MIA again. Did you finally realise how pathetic you are and decide to spare us all from having to look at your miserable face for a few days?” He keeps walking despite Flash’s attempts to bring him to a stop by walking directly in his path. “Come on Dickwad what’s the matter? Ignoring your superior is pretty rude.” Flash continues to throw insults at Peter as the boy makes a beeline for his Physics class, which his aggressor thankfully does not share with him.
“Hopefully it’ll be better than the surprises I get when my dad goes away on trips. They usually come in the form of a new girlfriend who only sticks around for a few weeks.” Peter laughs awkwardly at this. He’s still unsure of how to respond to most of the comments Harry makes about his father by now he’s at least pieced together that the pair don’t see eye to eye most of the time.
“Let’s go son.” The officer leads Peter towards a cop car, waiting with open doors. He ushers the quietly sobbing teen into the back seat before getting into the front and beginning the drive to the police station.
“Huh?” Mr. Stark points to Peter’s shirt, one of the only three that he owns, which just so happens to be his favourite. Aunt May got it for him on his birthday last year. It’s a plain black t-shirt with ‘the physics is theoretical but the fun is real’ written on it. “Oh, yeah I do. A lot actually.”
Peter can hear a bell chiming midnight as he comes to land on the roof of particularly tall apartment block. Feeling safe enough to do so, Peter removes the mask from his face and sits on the edge of the building with his legs dangling off the edge. There’s a chill in the air that bites at Peter’s skin turning his nose and cheeks red. Heaving a deep breath the young boy stares up at the sky heavy with clouds. It’s eerily peaceful for a night in Queens and Peter welcomes the calm.
Peter investigates his father's work at OSCORP and goes to a concert with Harry.
POV change at the start, but not for long!
With a lightness in his chest and a smile on his face Peter lays down to go to sleep.
On Tuesday morning Peter insists that it isn’t necessary for him to be driven to school every day. He’s gotten the train his entire life and he’ll continue to do that. His parents take quite a lot of convincing but eventually they give in.
It’s Saturday so there’s no urgency to Peter’s actions, he takes his time preparing breakfast and deciding what to do with his weekend. The past week of school had flown in very quickly, busy with tests and assignments galore. As the end of the year rapidly approaches the number of projects had practically doubled and with every passing day Peter is readier for the reprieve the summer months bring from school work. However, in the meantime there is still a great deal to be done so the boy heads back down to his own floor after consuming breakfast alone to study for the upcoming English test.
“I’m… Sorry… Sorry, I’ll go. I’m leaving.” Peter stutters out through the all-consuming embarrassment, and something else lingering underneath the mortification. Anger? Guilt? No none of those make sense. He turns on his heel and rushes back into the hallway, through the groups of people in search of something to distract him, because he’s figured out what the other feeling is. Jealousy. And quite honestly Peter cannot handle that right now.
They get all the way back to the Tower and have just entered the elevator when Harry finally speaks. “Thanks.” Peter reaches across the space between them silently to squeeze Harry’s hand in a gesture he hopes is comforting.
“Come young one, we have much great food to be consumed!” Thor pulls Peter forward with a firm grip on his shoulder. “And I should like to learn more about this Decathlon team, surely you are their strongest member.”
“He’s fifteen Stevie, and we live in the 21
A deep and intense panic sets into his chest, the need to find Aunt May kicking in like instinct. Peter scans the crowd for his Aunt but can’t see her anywhere. His breathing is becoming erratic and it’s getting harder to focus when he finally spots the familiar faces of their upstairs neighbours and rushes over to them, tripping on the sidewalk in his haste. Mr. Palmer and his wife spot him approaching them, the looks they fix him with don’t fill Peter with confidence.
Although they haven’t exchanged any words Peter knows Nat is keeping a close eye on him. After last night he doesn’t really blame her, he did a really poor job at covering up his limp and did an even worse job playing the situation off when the assassin pointed it out.
In all honesty Peter hasn’t paid attention to a single word his teacher has said all year, and he’s still passed every test.
The remainder of the night is fairly uneventful, they order in dinner (Chinese, Peter’s choice) and eat at the dining table on Steve and Tony’s floor. They pass the night through small talk, mainly about Peter and school. They eventually migrate to the couch where Tony puts Netflix on a big screen, choosing something to go on in the background.
“Of course it is Sam, you know you have an open invitation to stay whenever you want.” Tony nods to show that he agrees with his husband’s words and the two share that same knowing look Peter noticed them exchanging a few days earlier.
They leave the bedroom and walk towards the kitchen area. Tony is there, tablet in hand as always, he looks up to smile at them both. “Mornin’ kid.”
“Oh, that’s nothing Bucky, just a kid at school being stupid. I actually forgot all about it.”
Peter is in the bathroom, on his hands and knees scrubbing the tiles with bleach and a toothbrush, when he hears the commotion downstairs. He pauses the ministrations to focus his listening to what is going on.
Tony sighs, already sensing where this is going. “What exactly did she say about the dance kid?”
“I don’t want her to be.”
“It’s not her fault Tony, I asked her to push me.” Peter lies with an ease that impresses Natasha.
Watching them all interact Peter realises he can always count on one thing; no matter how crazy his and his families lives are they all genuinely love and care about each other. It’s not been an easy road to get here but Peter can say confidently he feels safe and loved living here in the Tower with Steve and Tony, and of course his extended gaggle of family in the form of assassins, super soldiers, and gods.
"Don’t worry Clint it’s been a long day, no one here will judge you for not being able to get it up.” Tony snickers. Peter groans from behind his hands.
“Whoa, ultra-polite. Good to meet you kid.” Tony’s face gives away easily that he’s thinking about something. “Why is you face familiar?”
“Um, I’ll need to get back to you on that one. I’ll text you the address.” They end the call after a few goodbyes and Peter flops onto his back, staring at the ceiling.
“I know that look.” Steve is smiling knowingly at Peter from the other side of the island. “Texting a certain pretty girl by any chance?”
Peter removes the blonde’s hands from his face and grips them tightly between his own. “Something you’ll figure out pretty quickly is that I kind of attract danger, so I can’t really make any promises.”
He can’t handle going home, having to face Bucky with the knowledge of what just happened between him and Harry.
When they sneak their way up to the roof the rest of the team is already there listening to music and chatting in smaller groups.
In his alcohol daze Peter is vaguely aware of Tony settling into the armchair in the corner of his room, but he could also swear down the room is spinning so he’s not sure how much he should really be trusting his own judgement.
The pair part way with Ned at the school gates, they time their walk quite well as the train has just pulled into the station when they arrive.
“But Tony, I don’t have a Millennium Falcon.”
“My math is never wrong.” Tony winks at Peter then invites Ned to stay for dinner, an invitation which he accepts with glee.
“Alright Pete I can take a hint, old man’s cramping your style. I’m leaving don’t worry. JARVIS will call you when it’s time for dinner.” With one Peter hair ruffle Tony’s away and the boys set about tackling their newest Lego project.
He slams the door to his room shut with a satisfying thud and grabs his backpack from under his bed before opening the window and slipping out. It’s just after seven o’clock as Peter changes into the suit and begins to swing. He stays out later than he usually would, considering that nothing eventful or significant has happened in the five hours that he’s been swinging about the streets of Queens.
To say that Peter has a fraught relationship with Harry’s family company would be the understatement of the century. His most recent trip to the company’s building in Manhattan as part of a school trip ended in him being bitten by a radioactive spider. Peter’s beginning to think the world is out to get him.
“That’s extremely kind of you to say.” An unknown male voice replies. “We are actually here about one child in particular.”
Despite his tendency to keep to himself and remain as invisible as possible, Peter feels inexplicably drawn towards Harry. He agrees to show the new boy around and the pair chat away until class begins.
------
Harry looks unimpressed. “Fine.” He wraps Peter into a gentler hug than the last one. “But if your face gets injured again, I’ll be pretty mad. I don’t know if you’ve noticed, but I’m kind of fond of it.” Peter blushes furiously shying under Harry’s attention. “See, how could I resist prettiest face around?”
He certainly couldn’t deny that the very definition of a date fits perfectly with what they had been doing all afternoon. He also can’t deny that he finds MJ very pretty, and he really does like her a lot.
Black Widow waltzes over to him next, every step she takes is calculated and precise giving the impression that she’s floating and not actually walking, Peter is mesmerised. “Natasha. Nice to meet you.” She smiles at him, but Peter can tell she’s surveying him and trying to figure him out.
“Yeah.” Peter responds as he slowly pulls back the covers to check on his leg. “I meant to ask, did you undress me?”
“So, em, I was wondering. Who else lives in the tower?” Peter asks, curiosity getting the better of him. He’s heard a few names mentioned but hasn’t had anything directly confirmed yet.
Enter Steve and Tony.
“Well you don’t know anything Harry, so just keep your mouth shut.”
He’s in the process of tweaking his web formula when a wad of paper hits him on the back of the head. It lands quite perfectly beside his pencil and falls open enough that Peter can tell something has been written inside.
Harry’s pretty much always the definition of calm, cool and collected so Peter doesn’t suspect that this information will phase him. Ned on the other hand… His first encounter with Bucky was anything but smooth and Peter would really like to avoid a similar situation ever happening again.
A plate of toast, eggs and bacon alongside a giant mug of coffee are placed in front of Peter and he practically inhales the food after the smell makes him realise just how hungry he is. While he eats Peter decides to check his phone which has been buzzing since he woke up this morning.
Harry waves him off. “Don’t stress over it Peter I really don’t mind. What use is 13 years piano lessons if you can’t break them out to wow people every now and then.” He winks at Peter, a smirk gracing his features, and Peter’s heart beats just a bit faster.
Harry nods in understanding. “Cool… And your other parent?”
“Yeah yeah. Go back to talking to building your ice castle, or whatever it is you do all day.” Bucky chuckles as he saunters out of the room clearly pleased at getting a reaction out of Tony, although he does throw a ‘thanks’ over his shoulder before the door closes.
Natasha slides into the seat on his other side and places a careful hand over his fingers which had been drumming a steady beat into the table without Peter even realising.
“Are you sure? I mean, you heard what Mr. and Mrs. Baker said. I’m a hassle and a trouble maker.”
Peter makes a face of confusion, turning to look at the woman. “What did you just call me?”
“No one. They aren’t half as observant as me.” She’s moved to sit beside him now. “I won’t say anything.” Peter’s eyes shoot up to her in shock. “It’s not my secret to tell. But you really need to get better at lying kid.”
“… doesn’t have much with him, it was all destroyed in the fire…”
“Yeah, I didn’t wanna just rush in and buy stuff without you getting a say first. We can start looking for more furniture tomorrow if you want?” Peter spins around so fast he swears that he could’ve gotten whiplash.
“Tony,” Steve shakes his head disapprovingly. “not in front of Peter.”
“Huh?”
This couple seem pleased that there will be a group of them attending. “Okay kid. Harry can you give me the address?” Tony pulls out his phone and hands it to Harry. “Just make sure your home by twelve, and tell JARVIS to let us know when you’re back.”
With a heavy sigh Peter pushes away from the dining table on his floor and makes his way to Steve and Tony’s private floor after asking JARVIS where the billionaire is.
Every night for the next two weeks Peter follows the same routine, sometimes staying out longer or coming back to his room earlier depending on what New York has to offer that evening.
Eventually Peter convinces the Avengers that they have more than enough pictures and it really is time to go before he’s late to pick up MJ. They all wave him off as he climbs into the car Tony picked out, which feels much too fancy for a school dance put Peter figures there’s no point arguing with the man.
“Is that Bucky’s arm?”
There are two fire engines battling the raging fire, the flames seeming impossibly high, three or four ambulances, and numerous police cars. Peter can’t really make out the scene correctly as tears begin cloud his vision.
“Yeah, Peter and I got to talking. He was just telling me that he’s read all of my papers when you walked through the door.” Tony looks down at Peter in mild surprise, the boy continues to blush under the gaze of both men. “Says he read them ‘for fun’.”
“Phone social work and tell them you don’t want me staying here anymore if you want. I don’t care anymore. Do what the fuck you like.” Peter pushes away from the table and storms upstairs, Mr. and Mrs. Baker shouting after him about his poor manners and lack of respect.
“The game is over birds of paradise, drop the act.” Iron Man takes up his classic stance, hands raised towards the two villains.
Ned stares at him incredulously. “How’s things? Peter. You’re not seriously asking me about my life right now?” Peter shrugs. “C’mon Pete I’ve been dying. You tell me that something’s happening but then don’t tell me what it is, and after everything that has happened to you recently you can’t just leave me hanging like that.”

“Peter Parker.” Answers the voice of Mrs. Warren.
Peter manages to push Steve’s hands away but Tony is glaring now too, something murderous burns behind both of their eyes. A parental need to protect that Peter hasn’t seen since May found out that Flash sabotaged his science project three years ago. Despite all the tension and anger a warm and happy feeling settles in Peter’s chest.
Steve fusses a bit more than Tony about going away. Before leaving the blonde hero forces Peter into a seat and lists off what to do in every possible emergency situation. A lot of it is common sense and Peter can handle himself better than Tony or Steve know, nonetheless the teenager humours his adoptive father and follows every word with rapt attention.
“Peter… Peter, I’m really sorry son. I can’t imagine what you must be going through right now. But you need to go with this Police Officer here.” Peter wipes at his face, looking up at the Officer who smiles sympathetically. “There isn’t much we can do for you, I’m so sorry. I wish there was something we could do.” Mr. Palmer tells Peter sincerely.
“Promise me.” Harry takes his hands, the still burning cigarette lies forgotten on the floor. “Promise me you won’t run away this time.”
Peter runs off towards the elevator throwing a “Thank you!” Over his shoulder.
“The end of year dance is coming up soon as well.”
He walks alone for about ten minutes until he hears the distinct noise of footsteps hitting the sidewalk behind him.
“Is Tony Stark. I’m sorry I didn’t tell you sooner Harry. Sometimes I think it’s just easier to show rather than tell. That’s what I did with Ned at least.”
There isn’t a single doubt in Peter’s mind that there will be many questions from his Spider-Man obsessed friend but answering them is the least he can do considering how amazing the other boy has been.
Made me think of you :)
Harry lets out a laugh that causes Steve’s brow to furrow. “Sorry, it’s just that I’m pretty terrible at all science and math related topics. The idea of me competing alongside these two geniuses is hilarious.” Peter joins in on the laughter as the confusion around the table doubles.
Peter pushes up into sitting, sad about leaving the warmth and comfort of Harry’s embrace, but he feels he has to look at him properly for this conversation. “At the risk of sounding like some pathetic person in a cheesy Rom Com, what is this? What are we?”
This gave Peter the opportunity to neglect his studies in favour of researching his newest adversary. So far Google hadn’t been much help but eventually he had been led to an article on the Daily Bugle. Not Peter’s usual choice for news given their open disdain for Spider-Man, but when the pickings are slim you take what you can get.
Peter doesn’t even need to look, the noise that leaves Ned’s mouth is enough indication of what sight will greet him. “It didn’t look that bad last night Pete.” His right leg is swollen to twice its regular size and is an angry red colour with some purple bruising around the edges.
There's a link to a YouTube compilation of ‘Star Wars as Vines’.
“Peter’s the genius of our team actually. He’s probably the smartest kid in school.” Ned says nonchalantly in between forkfuls of his dinner. Peter glares at his best friend but it’s pointless as Ned doesn’t even notice.
“The first rule is that you shall refer to us as Mr. and Mrs. Baker, respectively, at all times. Second rule states that you shall keep your room clean and tidy at all times, and that you will clean up any mess you create throughout the house. Third rule is that noise must be kept to a minimum at all times, we must be respectful of others. Fourth rule, possibly the most important, is that we have a very strict curfew. You will be home and in bed by ten o’clock every night. If you wish to go out, or stay at a friend’s you must ask permission before doing so.”
Chapter two!
“You know ace I don’t think I did a bit of homework the entire time I was in school. I don’t know how you do it all.” Bucky breaks the silence when Peter puts his pen down for a break, stretching so that all that his back cracks in the most satisfying way. The man has taken to calling Peter ‘ace’, which he found out from Steve is an old way of describing someone that is smart, so he quite likes the new nickname.
I won't make any promises about a new chapter, but if things go my way I'll have another one up soon.
“Okay Peter, we have a proposition for you. I don’t think you’ll say no but please know that you can if you want to.” Tony’s intro doesn’t give anything away and Peter’s curiosity only grows more with each passing second. He simply nods in the hopes that his parents will get a move on and just tell him already.
The bus journey passes quickly as MJ and Mr Harrington drill the entire team on every possible question to make sure they’re ready to go for the final which is in just a few hours’ time.
Ned is where Peter left him but he isn’t alone. Tony is sitting beside his best friend chatting away. “Hey there’s the worst host ever. Didn’t anyone ever tell you that its rude to leave your guests alone?” Peter rolls his eyes.
The pair settle down in Harry’s bedroom. It’s a space that screams Harry, the walls are covered in polaroid’s and posters of old bands. Peter recognises pictures of Marc Bolan, David Bowie and Morrisey from Tony’s many music education sessions. Along one wall is a very impressive collection of records, all stored carefully in plastic sleeves.
Steve barely looks up from the paper he’s reading. “Yeah, clearly your husband is proof of your ‘killer game with the ladies’.” Peter can’t help the snort that escapes him and Steve winks at him from across the table.
He’s barely stepped out of the elevator when Steve has him engulfed in a hug. “I’m so sorry, I didn’t realise the time. I should’ve called.” Peter begins apologising but Tony cuts him off, appearing beside his husband who releases Peter from the hug.
He follows Steve and Tony into the elevator and they explain to him what all of the floors are, although Peter is fairly certain he’ll need a refresher because there are close to one hundred buttons on the panel.
“I hope you didn’t feel put out or pressured to perform for everyone tonight Harry, I’m really sorry if they made you feel you had to.” Peter knows what his extended family (for lack of a better word) are like.
The chase lasts for a while, Peter swinging away as the green-guy pursues him throwing explosives every now and then.
Satisfied with her work Natasha rolls his pant leg back down. “Now you can go to bed.” Then she gets up and leaves without saying anything else.
with you?”
Steve explains that while most of the Avengers have floors in the tower they don’t all live there full-time. “The only people that live here constantly right now are Natasha, Bruce and Bucky. Is that right Tony?”
“I don’t either. They give me a bad vibe.”
Against his better judgement Peter opens the paper and is greeted by a rather detailed drawing of a stick figure version of himself giving a blowjob to a floating phallus. At the top of the page the words ‘Penis Parker Loves Dick’ are written in bold letters.
“Then I swung my hammer and took his head clean off.” Everyone laughs and a few people applaud as Thor stands up taking his hammer in hand to demonstrate how he delivered the final blow.
Trying to make it seem as casual as possible Peter turns towards the door to see exactly what he expected. Natasha leaning against the door frame her eyes examining Peter suspiciously.
The smile remains on Peter’s face looking at his adoptive parents. They’re so openly comfortable with one another, Peter hopes he can be that relaxed and in love with someone in the future. “Harry has tickets to a concert tonight, would it be okay if I went?”
“Mr Osborn, considering you are our newest addition why don’t you take a crack at this equation?” It clicks instantly, Harry Osborn, son of Norman Osborn the owner of Oscorp.
------
GREEN GOBLIN SIGHTING – WHO WILL SAVE US? NOT THE SPIDER-MAN!
The building is nothing short of spectacular, about as tall as the Tower but vastly different in appearance. Where the tower is modern with lots of glass and reflective panels Harry’s building is art-deco in appearance giving it a distinctive character, Peter decides it suits his friend perfectly. He’s buzzed in by Harry’s cheerful voice and is told to come straight up to the penthouse.
Peter is well aware that he is openly staring at his friend, but at this point he doesn’t have the brain capacity to give it a second thought. All he sees is Harry.
------
The night of the dance Peter is subjected to more humiliation by his extended family who insist on taking thousands of pictures of him in the suit. He pretends to be annoyed but the look of joy on his adoptive parent’s faces make it a bit difficult to really feel any emotions other than love and happiness.
The blonde boy is standing to Peter’s right watching the him with a cigarette dangling from his fingertips. “Having a good time?” Harry’s voice isn’t as light and teasing as it normally is so even through the alcohol induced haze Peter can tell his friend is upset. When Peter doesn’t respond Harry slides closer so that their shoulders are touching. “I’m not.”
Since Peter stormed out of the Tower yesterday at around lunchtime Bucky had texted and called him an impressive seventy-two times in total. The last two had only come through in the last half hour.
Thankfully it’s dark when he reaches his destination and he manages to scale the building rather successfully considering he’s basically a leg down. He finds the window he needs and yanks the glass open pulling himself over the ledge and landing rather unceremoniously in a heap under the window.
Harry chuckles rubbing soothing circles into Peter’s back as he continues to cough. “Easy Pete, don’t inhale as quickly next time.” He brings the tip of the cigarette back down to Peter’s mouth where he takes a more even drag, feeling the smoke fill his lungs before letting it back out.
After taking a deep breath Peter places one hand near his ankle and another just below his knee, after a second of hesitation he twists until the bone clicks back into place. Peter bites down on the towel so hard his jaw aches almost as bad his leg.
This one is a bit shorter than my usual chapters, but there's a lot of dialogue and a heavy amount of family-bonding in this chapter which I really enjoyed writing.
Rhodey leans over Peter’s other shoulder now to get a good look at the article. “Yeah nothing useful though, he isn’t enough of a threat yet to warrant action, but as per usual defence are already keeping an eye out.” Something beeps and both men check their phones before sharing a look. “I gotta run. Peter it was great to meet you, hopefully next time I’m here it won’t be such a fleeting visit, but duty calls.” He bids Tony farewell and disappears back upstairs.
“My dad.”
Eventually they seem to remember that Peter is standing with them and Harry introduces them all. The first girl with impossibly long, pin straight blonde hair is Gwen. The other girl with darker skin and warm brown eyes introduces herself as Liz. Turns out that the trio went to middle school together before Harry started getting shipped off to various boarding schools around the world, but they all kept in touch.
“Doing what?”
Clint stands and strides over to the object. He places one hand onto the handle and pulls upwards. Nothing happens. Then again with two hands. Again, nothing.
(See the end of the chapter for
Getting back on his feet after losing Uncle Ben had been hard enough, and in the last few months Peter had finally begun to feel as though his life was on an upward slope; he was doing well in school, he loved being Spider-Man, he had an amazing best friend, and he and Aunt May had never been closer. Now after one horrific night he’s right back at square one again.
“I was wanting to ask you something…” MJ doesn’t say anything she just watches Peter expectantly, both eyebrows raised in anticipation. “Would you maybe wanna go to the dance with me? You know, if someone else hasn’t asked you yet.”
He pushes past the stinging feeling in his shoulder and releases all of his tension into the bag, Steve and Bucky observing all the while. Eventually the pair begin sparring with one another, leaving Peter to his own devices. But his Spider-sense is acutely aware that he is still being watched.
“I wanted to apologise for texting you the way that I did last week. I shouldn’t have been so rude.”
“Well, if I can’t squish you at least this building will!” The Green Goblin launches himself out of one of the still standing windows, landing on his hover board and flying off as he cackles maniacally.
Harry lets out a bitter laugh. “Why not? You’re perfect together. Perfect little genius couple.”
Peter jolts at the mention of his name. There have been several couples, families, and even single people through the house in the months that he has been here looking to adopt, but never have any of them shown any interest in him. Why would they? He’s fifteen, soon to be sixteen in August, nobody wants adopt an almost adult.
Peter’s head is spinning with thoughts as he makes his way to bed. He’s just about to turn off his light and crawl under the covers when his phone buzzes on the bedside table.
“I mean I was in mortal danger Ned; not sure you really want to be in that situation.”
“He’s not being fair to himself, you’re not that bad.” Peter takes great delight in the way Harry glances over at him, looking deep into his eyes. “You’ve been trying really hard, and you’re way better at History and English than I’ll ever be.”
“Peter, this idiot with no manners is Clint.” Tony supplies as Clint shakes Peter’s hand with a smile, apologising again for almost hitting him in the face.
A silence hangs between them as Harry flicks his finished cigarette off of the balcony and takes another out of his pocket. This one look distinctly different and Peter knows right away that it’s not tobacco wrapped expertly in the paper. Wordlessly Harry lights the end of the paper, taking a long drag before offering it to Peter to do the same. He leans forward and inhales deeply then almost instantly he’s doubled over coughing and spluttering in a way he hasn’t done since his last asthma attack, months before the spider bite.
It’s not like Peter is expecting Michelle to shout at him or to be overly mean, it’s just that this behaviour is so out of character he’s legitimately worried about her. In all the years he has known her Peter has never seen Michelle willingly engage in a one-on-one conversation with another person.
Ned replies almost instantly;
“It’s more than okay Peter. This is your home now.” A warm feeling settles nicely in Peter’s chest at Tony’s words. He promptly texts Ned telling him to meet him at an ice cream parlour nearby that they’ve been to a few times figuring that will be easier than sending Ned directions to the Avengers tower and then having to explain that.
“So Harry tell us more about yourself. Are you on the Decathlon team with Ned and Peter?” Steve swiftly falls into the ‘old man’ role that Bucky and Sam are always teasing him about.
Tony wanted to drive him to MJ’s house but Peter had managed to wear him down to letting Happy drive them. Peter really wanted to get a taxi but that idea went down like a led balloon. So Happy driving was the best compromise.
“A creative genius, yes honey I know.” Steve pecks Tony on the lips. “Now hand the knife over to our son and go set the table instead.” Tony is pouting as he storms off to lay placemats and cutlery.
Of course, the female spy was correct and Nick Fury purely wanted Peter’s first-hand account of the night. He retold the whole event from start to end, only stumbling a bit when he remembered holding hands with Harry in the crowd, how natural and easy it had felt.
He’s barely stepped out of the elevator before making a beeline towards Peter and tackling him a tight hug.
So maybe not remembering to buy a suit for his school dance was a major oversight on Peter’s part, but he’s never been to such a fancy event before so he thinks he deserves a bit of slack. Besides Tony seems to be really enjoying shopping in all the best and fanciest places so Peter is more than happy to indulge in his adoptive father’s wishes, even if the amount of money being spent is making him deeply uncomfortable.
“Did I know that my dad worked for OSCROP? Did I know that he created the spider that bit me and gave me enhanced abilities? Did I know that Harry’s dad was friends with my dad? No, Ned. I didn’t know any of that.” Thankfully there’s a bench just a few steps behind them because Peter feels as though he might faint. The pair sit down and stare up at the image of Peter’s dad in dead silence.
Peter pulls up his hood, keeps his face down, and tries to make his way to his locker as quickly as possible. He breathes a sigh of relief when he spots Ned waiting for him in front of their lockers. He’s about to greet Ned when the other boy pulls him into a bone crushing hug. Peter’s tense at first, very aware that everyone is still staring at him, but he relaxes into the hug enjoying the first real comfort he has had in over a month.
“Peter, sweetheart. Your Aunt May… She…” Mrs. Palmer breaks off looking to the ambulance closest to them. Mr. Palmer manages to catch Peter before he hits the ground, holding him up as the tears break free. At this point Peter has lost enough people in his short life to guess what Mrs. Palmer was planning to tell him.
“Well something came up that called for the best, and you’re looking at him.” Nat throws a fortune cookie at Clint’s head causing his smile to change to a pout. “Rude.”
Natasha and Clint don’t hang around for much longer, both having to leave for a meeting that sounds extremely confidential and important. Natasha says that she will be back in time for dinner, but Clint lets everyone know that he’s going back to the farm. Before he leaves Clint claps Peter on the shoulder and says it was nice to meet him. Peter decides that out of the pair Clint seems to be the most approachable, and on the other hand he thinks it might take some time before he feels even somewhat comfortable around Natasha.
A few minutes pass in casual conversation, mainly Tony and Bucky winding each other up about one thing or another while Steve looks on fondly, suddenly Peter feels a familiar prickle on the back of his neck and before he knows it his hand is shooting up to catch something that was about to hit him square in the face.
, Peter marvels at the cost of the items surrounding him. Of course, he’s aware that he could afford to shop in places like this now, Tony had handed him a credit card months ago that’s been burning a hole in his pocket ever since. He could shop here but he honestly doesn’t want to.
Peter looks helplessly at Mr. Harrington, wanting the man to tell Michelle that speaking to team members is teacher responsibility. All the adult does is smile at Peter before moving to help two pupils who have started fighting over the buzzer.
“Oh my God, Pete! Are you okay?” Harry helps him into a sitting position. “You shouldn’t have done that you idiot.”
The blonde boy comes bounding over to their table where MJ, Ned and Peter are sitting bored out of their minds.
The hit barely grazes Peter’s jaw as he leans backwards away from the punch. The younger boy’s eyes narrow slightly and Natasha has to supress a smile as he returns the next hit with a new-found determination.
The blinds on Peter’s windows slowly open to let sunshine stream into the room. “Good morning Master Parker. Mr Rogers and Mr Stark are having breakfast in the kitchen when you’re ready to join them, they insist that there is no rush.”
There’s a confusing mix of emotions swirling around inside of Peter right now, but one makes it way to the top, standing out stronger than any of the others. Anger.
Peter: In case you didn’t know, I’ve had quite a lot going on in my life recently. So forgive me if I’ve not been able to attend decathlon as much recently, but I’ve had more important shit going on.
“The luckiest.”
Ned’s mom picks him up not long after all of the dishes have been put away leaving Peter free to join the tower’s occupants in front of the TV for a few hours. Not everyone stays namely Bruce, Sam and Bucky excuse themselves for various reasons. However, if the snorts both of his guardians let out after Bucky and Sam leave together is anything to go by, no one believes the duo’s excuses.
“We’re so proud of you Peter.” Steve pulls the boy into a hug as soon as his husband releases the boy.
“I was going to say sensitive.” Tony snorts causing Steve to narrow his eyes at him again. “You said back at the foster home that you knew who we were and what we do. How much do you know exactly?”
Someone wolf whistles at them and Peter groans out loud when he comes face to face with Flash. “Aw look at this, Penis Parker finally got himself a beard! Nice work Penis, don’t worry MJ you can move onto a real man like me when Peter finally reveals his true rainbow colours.”
Steve and Tony both jump up from their seats to point accusing fingers at the pair. “WE KNEW IT!” They high-five and then Steve is pulling out his wallet and handing his husband $20.
Peter waves him off. “Don’t worry about it, I’m not really one for parties anyway. I don’t mind.” Tony gestures to the boy and fixes Steve with a look that says ‘
Harry, quite frankly, is cool. Peter and Ned, are not. This is something the two boys are well aware of and are more than happy to admit. It’s just bizarre that someone like Harry with his easy-going attitude, swoopy hair, general disregard for school and ability to seemingly charm anyone he comes into contact with, is in such stark contrast to Peter and Ned awkwardly fumbling through every social interaction.
As Harry is getting fitted for a new suit in Gucci,
Clint suggests a number of methods including a flash mob, a barbershop quartet and sky writing. All ideas are shot down immediately by the rest of the group for being impractical. Peter personally doesn’t think he would have the confidence or bravado to follow through with any of those ideas anyway.
The sight of his two guardians greets the young boy. The pair are standing with their heads bowed close together clearly in deep discussion. Peter doesn’t want to intrude and is about to head back upstairs when Steve spots him and waves him into the workshop.
Steve’s brow creases at the mention of a new name. “Who’s Harry?”
“Alright I’ll come if you stop doing that.” This only causes the shimmying to intensify until Harry’s putting his hands onto Peter’s shoulders and forcing him to join in.
“Um, yeah. It’s nice Tony. Just, it’s quite bare? Doesn’t feel like anyone lives on this floor.” He makes his way over to the large glass windows, looking out across all of New York.
Peter’s breathing becomes short and quick, his chest constricting tightly as the panic and memories of that night overtake him.
Something which Peter enjoys watching his blonde-haired friend do is charm others. He supposes that if he had been raised in the same world as Harry he would possess many of the same skills. Harry glides effortlessly through the halls of the company he will one day inherit after convincing the pretty girl at the reception to give him passes with clearance for employee only areas.
(See the end of the chapter for
Peter quickly discovered that he quite enjoyed the super-soldier’s quiet presence. Many people would have found it unnerving to have a trained assassin sit and watch you silently, and a few weeks ago Peter would have agreed wholeheartedly with that assessment. But there was something about Bucky, something calming and comforting, and Peter soon found himself appreciating the man’s presence more with each passing day.
“You were really great today MJ.”
After taking a large drink of water he turns to the other boy. “Alright, what do you want to know?” That opens a flood gate as Ned speaks at a hundred miles a minute, even tripping over his own words a few times in his desperate haste to get everything out.
“Pete why don’t you give it a go?” Tony suggests and everyone else is quick to jump in with agreement.
The fact that Iron Man and Captain America are married doesn’t throw Peter as much as it probably should. There have always been rumours about the pair but he had never really paid them any attention; Peter’s logic had always been that at the end of the day it didn’t actually matter if the two were romantically involved or not.
“Woah! Good reflexes kid.” Clint walks towards them with an impressed look on his face. Upon closer inspection Peter discovers that the offending object is a cereal bar. He notices that Steve and Natasha are watching him closely, obviously both wondering how he caught the bar so easily when it would have hit any normal person. Peter makes a mental note to try and ignore the Spidey-sense as much as possible when he’s around the Avengers, if anything is going to give him away it will most likely be that. “Sorry about that, I was aiming for Rapunzel.” Bucky glares at Clint but there’s no heat behind the look.
At some point he’s introduced to JARVIS who didn’t make his presence known until Tony formally introduced Peter to him, which he greatly appreciated as Peter isn’t sure how he would have reacted if the ceiling had started speaking to him with no warning.
“In the time before you sweetums. You know there’s no other for me now.” Tony leans over to press a kiss to Steve’s cheek.
“This is an honour, really sir.” Peter can hear Mrs. Baker laying the pleasantries on thick which must mean this is somebody hoping to adopt one of the kids in the house.
“How about we agree that this whole Spider-Man thing remains a secret between us, unless I come home really seriously injured. Because if I’m not hurt and you don’t tell Tony and Steve then you aren’t breaking any rules, right?” To Peter’s utter delight and surprise JARVIS agrees. Apparently, Tony hasn’t made JARVIS’ protocols so strict that there are no loopholes. After asking JARVIS to tell his parents that he’s gone out for a walk and not to worry, Peter shoots off a web and begins swinging through the city.
Peter has known for a while now that Natasha was suspicious of him. She hardly attempted to hide it, staring holes through him any time he was near isn’t exactly discreet. But Peter had certainly never expected the woman to all but attack him in the name of getting answers.
“Pete! Harry! Excellent timing boys, settle an argument for us.” Peter watches as Harry’s face slips back into the mask he presents to the world, joining in gladly with the debate.
Steve is likely to forget the quick reflexes Peter displayed earlier and pass it off as a coincidence, but the boy fears that Natasha will not do the same. She’s an expert assassin who has probably already started stockpiling information about Peter, from his unusually quick reflexes down to small things like that fact that he’s been fidgeting with the hem of his jumper since Tony brought him into the room.
Peter hangs about with the two men in the workshop until J.A.R.V.I.S breaks through Tony’s music to let them know that Steve has made lunch and is requesting they all come and eat together. On the way up to common floor Bruce asks Peter a bit more about his scientific interests and extends an open invitation to join him in the labs upstairs whenever he wants, Peter accepts this offer with child-like excitement.
When he finally checks his phone he lets out a sigh of relief, for once he isn’t late and will actually arrive back at the Tower when he had promised he would.
But the pain is easier to handle now because he has Tony and Steve. And Nat, Bucky, Bruce and Sam. Even Rhodey had texted him to tell him to have a good night, and not to let his Dads embarrass him in front of his date, which Peter is planning to stick to.
“… yeah, foster care. He’s, like, an orphan.”
By the time he’s left the Tower and walked about three blocks Peter has calmed down quite a bit. Perhaps shouting and storming out was a bit of an overreaction but Peter chalks it up to teenage mood swings. When his head finally clears he realises he didn’t actually have a plan or destination in mind. He just grabbed his backpack and left.
Harry lets out a laugh. “Luckily I get to avoid it for a little bit yet, my dad’s company is having some tech presentation outside of Oscorp so I have an obligation to be there.” Harry rolls his eyes and Peter feels like he has gained further insight into his new friend’s private life.
Peter shakes his hands in a sign for Tony to stop talking. “Let’s just rewind for a second. You want me to come to
Peter steps out of the car and follows his new adoptive family in a bit of a daze. There’s so much to look at and take in. There are at least twenty cars in the garage they’ve pulled into but Peter can’t see them all to count properly so there might be more. His eyes flicker about at a rapid pace and he can feel a headache coming from the sensory overload, just another perk of being bitten by a radioactive spider.
The decision to put the mask back on again is taken almost completely out of Peter’s hands one afternoon. He’s walking to the bus after school when he hears gunshots and screaming from down the street. Acting on instinct he jumps into an alley near to him and retrieves the suit from his bag, putting it on without a second thought. His need to follow instinct kicking into high gear.
The boy shakes himself out of his shock, catching the clock he realises it’s almost half past nine. He can hear Steve’s voice in his head, reminding him to get a good night of sleep so that he can be ready for school tomorrow. Despite how much he does not want to go to school Peter doesn’t want to stay in this kitchen any longer.
It takes him a while to realise that he’s been crying, only noticing when his breathing hitches. He would give anything to be able to rewind time, to go back to when his life was good and Aunt May was still alive. Tears flow freely down his face as Peter thinks about what he has lost and the sad reality of what his life has become.
Mrs. Warren arrives to pick him up, her smile soft and sombre knowing where she is driving Peter to and what he’s about to do.
So, Natasha knows! I wasn't planning on any of the Avengers finding out so soon originally but it felt unnatural given Natasha's behaviour that she wouldn't push the boundaries and try to figure it out. I hope you liked they way I included her finding out.
Peter helps prepare the dinner with Steve, although there isn’t much left to do, before long the dinner is ready and being served to just the trio. The two Avengers ask Peter about his day with Harry, he spends the whole conversation desperately hoping his face isn’t flaming bright red and giving away his inner monologue of:
Two days before Peter is due back at school the rest of the tower’s occupants return from their mission. He becomes aware that something is happening when his spider-senses pick up on a rumbling noise coming from the top of the tower. From his location on his floor Peter technically shouldn’t be able to hear, what he assumes to be, the aircraft however thanks once again to heightened senses, he can hear the sound of wheels touching down onto the landing pad.
Suddenly the figure rises, dropping the blanket to reveal the Green Goblin. “Aw look who’s here to save me, ickle-spideykins to the rescue!” Peter manages to backflip out of the way just as Goblin strikes forward with a blade. “Nice moves itsy-bitsy but I doubt you’ll be able to dodge these.”
Driving away from the foster home Peter has lived at for the past five months has got to be one of the happiest moments of his life. The drive into Manhattan is nice, Steve and Tony chat to him about living in the tower and all of the other people who live there.
Peter doesn’t want to disturb so he just joins their comfortable silence. The thing is, Peter is a fidgetier, ever since he was a child whenever something is bothering him he fidgets. So, he makes it all of twenty minutes into the movie before Tony pulls away from his husband, who isn’t breaking concentration from this movie for anything less than a world-ending event, to gesture to Peter to join him in the kitchen.
“There are clean pyjamas in the drawer beside your bed Master Parker.”
“In the William Shakespeare work A Midsummer’s Night Dream there is only one non-human relationship, which pair form this romance?”
“Please, if you can, let us know where you end up. Just so we know that you’re okay.” Mrs. Palmer pulls Peter into a hug, rubbing comforting circles into his back before Peter turns his attention to the awaiting Policeman.
Harry moves away from the railing now too, closer to Peter again.  “Oh yeah, what about you? Where’s your little girlfriend run off to Peter?”
Overwhelmed with emotion at hearing the exact thing he desperately needed to, even if he hadn’t realised it, Peter closes the gap to hug Harry tightly. “Thank you.”
Bucky however does not seem satisfied and is watching Peter with a calculating look, as if he’s trying to crack some sort of code. Peter tries his best to ignore the other man’s gaze boring into the side of his head, chalking it up to nothing more than Bucky’s strange assassin tendencies.
Lunch begins with Harry expressing his delight that all science classes are over for the day. Peter thinks that it’s probably for the best that his new friend doesn’t like science considering how utterly terrible he is at all of them. Although he does find it amusing that the son of one of the greatest scientists currently alive doesn’t have any talent in that area whatsoever.
The crowd of people are running in all directions now, dodging bombs and debris alike. If Peter doesn’t make a move now this could end badly for many people involved.
After a few upbeat songs, the tempo drops dramatically to a slow and pleasant melody backing soft lyrics about first love and life changing events. As the second softer song begins Harry’s fingers brush subtly across the back of Peter’s hand, so carefully that he might not even know they were there if he didn’t have super-senses. He slowly turns his hand over so that his palm is facing towards Harry.
“That’s certainly the intention dear.”
“Aw look at the baby in his blazer.” He brings his hands up and puts one on each of Peter’s cheeks pushing his lips together in an uncomfortable way. “Don’t you look so dapper. Do you have your juice boxes with you?”
She understands keeping secrets, better than most, but there’s something about Peter’s secret keeping that is leading the assassin to believe he isn’t just some overly clumsy fifteen-year-old.
I am open to prompts and suggestions so let me know if you have any ideas!
Not taking anything for granted Peter gets out of there as quickly as he can, heading back to where he stashed his backpack so that he can change.
Peter greets his other guardian and takes a seat at the table where a breakfast of toast, bacon and eggs awaits him. Truth be told he doesn’t really feel like eating but he doesn’t want to be rude, so he forces down two pieces of toast, some bacon and a forkful of eggs.
After pressing send Peter turns his phone off deciding that he really can’t be bothered with whatever response Michelle would send.
“You know, nothing makes me feel better after I’ve had a bad day than punching the crap out of something.” Bucky smiles at Peter and pulls a punching bag into the centre of the room. “Fancy a go?”
Peter certainly isn’t prepared for when Bucky pulls a familiar looking bit of paper out of his pocket. “I was wanting to ask you about his Pete. I spotted it when Sam and I were down here with you last week but I didn’t want to bring it up when your parents were around, I’m assuming there’s a reason you didn’t tell them about it.” Bucky unfolds the paper to reveal that awful drawing Flash did a few weeks ago. The crude picture had slipped Peter’s mind entirely, and Flash has done worse since then .
“Well, I just got off the phone with two friends who have tickets to this amazing concert tonight in an old warehouse. Very underground. It’s gonna be amazing, and you and I are going.” Harry shimmies his shoulders while waggling his eyebrows at Peter in a way that is completely ridiculous and causes him to laugh.
Peter asks Ned to grab a towel from the bathroom, so that he has something to bite down on, and then asks the other boy just to stand by to make sure Peter actually goes through with it.
“What Captain Dad is trying to say is that we’ve accidently thrown a party.” Peter laughs at the glare Steve sends Tony.
The boy smirks at him. “Avoiding someone?”
Possibly the last thing that could help Peter avoid Ned freaking out again greets them when the dining table comes into view. The usual’s are present; Steve, Tony, Bucky, Nat, and Bruce. But so are Sam and Clint.
With a sigh Peter realises that Ned is right, he hasn’t been very fair to his best friend recently, especially considering that he has been pretty much the only person who has been there for him. “You’re right. I’m sorry, I really am. There’s just been a really major change in my life, again, and I needed time to process it before I told you.” Ned inclines his head awaiting the rest of Peter’s explanation. “If I’m completely honest I still haven’t fully processed it. But you’re right, I owe you an explanation. There’s a lot for me to explain here, and I need you to promise me that you won’t freak-out.”
“You know you can just go talk to MJ right?” Ned says breaking Peter’s attention away from the phone as it continues to ping with messages.
The three Avengers begin dispersing the crowd once they are satisfied that all signs of danger have been avoided. Harry makes sure Peter is okay and heads off to find the girls with a promise to return once he has checked on them. The crowd has almost completely depleted when Natasha wanders over to Peter’s spot in the corner of the room.
“Um, you could say that…” Peter scratches the back of his neck awkwardly. “Not really someone as much as the entire student body.” The new boy laughs, the sound is warm and positive, it eases just a little bit of the tension Peter is carrying.
The train ride is just like every other one they have shared over the last few weeks. Harry asks about Tony and Steve and Peter tells him they’ll be home tonight. He spoke to them this morning and they said they were bringing a surprise with them.
“Peter, it doesn’t have to mean anything.” That was probably the last thing he expected to hear. “You’re still you. Still the same geeky, dorky, awkward, adorable mess that you were twenty-four hours ago when you were still pretending not to be blinded by my rugged good looks.” Harry flips his hair jokingly causing Peter to laugh. “Labels are overrated, they only need to mean something if you want them to. I’ve practically known I was gay since the day I could walk, but it isn’t something I feel the need to tell people, unless it comes up. For now, you can just worry about being you. Don’t force yourself into finding a label because you think you have to.”
Ned looks up sheepishly from the doorway. “Sorry…” All around his feet are the broken remains of a plate. “I thought I’d bring you some breakfast, clearly it was a terrible idea.” He crosses the room to the bed where Peter has laid back down, an arm covering his eyes to block out the light. “So, you’re Spider-Man?”
------
Peter holds him off with an outstretched hand that stops Harry dead in his tracks. “I’m fine.” He grits out, he’s had worse before but Peter’s brain is feeling particularly fuzzy in this moment and he doesn’t think that’s just a result of banging his head on the bed.
“Hey Pete isn’t that your-?”
Peter laughs uncomfortably. “Oh well, yeah. I, um, I hope that happens for you?” Peter is sure he imagines it but MJ seems to huff slightly before she stands up.
“Hey! These are the hands of-”
“It’s, um. It’s really no problem Mr. Rogers.” Peter says stuttering under the gaze of Captain America, still in complete shock that this is even happening.
“Okay, I’m leaving now.” His parents continue to laugh as Peter blushes furiously and scurries away to get in the elevator.
Peter manoeuvres about the kitchen, grabbing a snack and a drink of water, all the time aware that Natasha hasn’t let up on the staring.
Steve finds them like this standing by the sink laughing hysterically and shimmying back and forth. “Doing a great job of washing the dishes boys.” He leans against the counter and smiles over at them. The ridiculous shaking slowly comes to a halt and the pair glance over at Steve with guilty looks. “Don’t stop on my account. It’s nice to see you having fun.”
“People of New York!” The rushing comes to an abrupt halt as one of the figures speaks and everyone turns towards the sound. “We have one request, bring us the Spider-Man.” Peter doesn’t recognise this first voice, but the second is all too familiar.
Harry sits down on the bench and lifts the lid carefully. Everyone else situates themselves in various areas, between the couches and the bar stools nearby. Peter moves to stand beside Bucky and Sam near the window.
This chapter should hopefully make up for the last one, I'm much happier with this one over all and its the length I usually aim for.
Peter ends up being directly involved in the Avengers debriefing that night when he makes it back to the Tower. It’s a strange experience because he’s never been involved in anything so formal in his life, and he gets to meet Nick Fury.
Rhodey, Sam and Clint split their time between the tower and elsewhere due to work and family commitments but Sam is apparently around a lot more often than the others. Steve and Tony share a knowing look while explaining this, peaking Peter’s curiosity, but he figures it isn’t his place to pry.
Peter shrugs. “Hey, it’s not your fault two crazy flying guys showed up to terrorize everyone.”
He’s ushering Michelle off of the roof when another blast sounds, landing in front of them and taking out the exit. Peter acts quickly, picking Michelle up without a second thought and swinging onto the next rooftop. He drops Michelle, rather ungracefully, onto the roof and continues swinging, desperate to get the green-guy away from any possible casualties.
Peter sighs, just when he thought he was going to get away with this, why did he ever think he could keep his identity hidden from Iron Man and Captain America? Just when it seems hopeless an idea dawns on him. “Hey JARVIS. Can we make a deal?”
They make their way to the couch, Harry sitting down casually and making himself at home as he always does, Peter hesitates not really sure if he should sit near Harry or not. He’s never been in this situation before.
They’re both standing now, and Bucky takes a few steps back, giving Peter more space. “Alright ace, I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have brought it up.”
Tony clears his throat. “I don’t have a good relationship with alcohol Peter. That much is well documented in the press, and my issues started when I was your age.” Steve rests a supportive hand on his husband's shoulder. “I’m not saying you’ll end up like me but I’m sure as hell going to do everything I can to make sure you don’t.”
On the 14th of April Peter is being picked up by Steve and Tony (who insisted Peter stops calling him Mr. Stark) to be taken to his new home. They come to pick him up in a flashy car that Tony is driving himself. Both men look at him with sadness when they realise he only has his backpack and a few items of clothing to his name. Tony makes a comment about taking him shopping as soon as possible.
Peter fears he is beginning to resemble a dashboard dog with the amount of nodding he has been doing in the past few minutes, but he’s unsure of how else to respond. The conversation switched from pleasantries to quite intimidating extremely quickly.
The look on Bucky’s face switches to sympathetic. “I hear that kid.” The silence falls around them again, much more comfortable this time. It feels safe and trusting.
Peter is desperate for a nap by the time he gets into the Tower’s elevator. “Good afternoon Peter, Mr. Stark is in his office and Mr. Rogers is training with Sgt. Barnes. I will alert them that you have returned.”
Their gaze locks again and this time there’s only hope in Harry’s expression. “Don’t do this if you aren’t sure.” It’s Peter’s turn to look confused now. “I can’t handle it again, if you pretend nothing happened, like… like the last time. After that day when we studied… That day when I kissed you.” There it is. The first time the kiss has been acknowledge out loud between the two of them. “I can’t go through that again Peter.”
Important conversations over the boy settle back into each other’s company for a few hours. Peter tries to broach the subject of Norman once but is met instantly with Harry shutting down, so he decides to leave it. They briefly talk about telling other people and agree that it would be best not to tell anyone at first.
The suit has a few holes in it from where bombs had caught him, and it's not until Peter is lifting his arm to put his t-shirt on that he feels the searing pain in his shoulder. Carefully he examines the area only to find a sizeable burn on his right shoulder.
“Excellent timing Pete, come help Tony chop the tomatoes before he chops off one of his fingers. I can’t handle the whining if he damages his precious hands.”
“Okay…” Peter begins slowly. “Before I say anything I want you to know that I love living here and I love being your son and I don’t want anything to change and I really, really, don’t want to upset or offend you in anyway.” Tony just nods and motions for Peter to continue. “You can say no to this, of course, I’d never want you to abuse any influence that you have for my benefit and-”
Seeing this Peter takes pity and forgets his own misery for a second. “No, I’m fine Harry honestly, I think I should just go home.”
He also has another encounter, one that is not friendly in the slightest...
“Except for… me…” Their eyes meet for a second and then they both become very interested in the floor as the elevator speeds upwards.
“You’re certain they were using the alien tech?” Fury questions.
He can hear Steve laughing as the elevator doors slide open on the communal floor. Steve’s laugh is loud and warm, and is quickly becoming one of Peter’s favourite sounds, it’s something he’s starting to associate with comfort and safety both of which he never takes for granted.
When the elevator doors open Harry is there waiting on the other side with a huge grin on his face. “You got here quick!”
“Of course you’re Osborn’s kid, you look just like him.” Peter notices the way Harry’s shoulders tense slightly at the mention of his dad and sets about rescuing the boy from his adoptive father’s clutches.
Peter decides to stay in the guest room on Steve and Tony’s floor tonight, with Tony promising that first thing tomorrow they’ll start shopping for furniture and things that he can use to decorate the floor and make it his own.
“Heard it all before kid, forget the excuses. Are you okay?” Peter reassures the pair that he’s fine, all that happened was that he and Ned had lost track of time and he forgot to check his phone until he was nearly home, which technically isn’t a lie.
“Yeah, you were.”
After visiting several designer stores they finally settle on a simple and classic black suit, Tony had been pushing for a dark green suit but thankfully Steve stepped in to help his son choose the more simple and understated option.
Feeling a bit happier Peter ignores the messages coming into his phone from Natasha and follows the direction to Harry’s house.
“Yes?”
The last board causes Peter to pause when he spots a familiar picture.
Harry’s confidence wavers slightly, just as Peter noticed it always does when his enrolment at a school that is so far beyond his skill set is brought up. “That is a long story I won’t bore you to death with. Essentially my dad has a lot of pull on the board and convinced them to let me in, despite me being a complete hopeless case at equations and chemistry.”
Nothing. Not even when he got back to his room that night, when he was alone in the dark and the silence. Nothing.
Harry smiles in that way Peter likes just a bit too much. “So, I was thinking, especially after how much of a train wreck tonight was, of throwing a party after the dance next week. Thoughts?” They’ve started walking away from the warehouse now.
“I have already informed them of yours and Mr Leeds’ immanent arrival Peter.”
“Actually, on that note. Just a forewarning Peter.” He turns his attention to Steve now who shifts on the couch so that he can face Peter fully. “Bucky can be a bit…”
“Well it doesn’t make me feel better. Let’s get some food in you Pete, you won't feel as sick after that.” Steve drops a kiss onto Peter’s hair as he walks past, Tony does the same on the way to the fridge leaving the boy blushing on his barstool.
‘Flash makes my life hell in any way that he can, last night I saved Michelle from a potentially serious situation but she doesn’t know I’m Spider-Man, I’m terrified that people at school will somehow find out that I have been adopted by two of the most famous people on the planet or equally that they will find out I’m Spider-Man, so now I have two big secrets to hide from them, and just all around my anxiety is probably at a ten right now…’
“I have informed Mr Rogers and Mr Stark that you are home Peter, they have been extremely worried.” JARVIS’ voice informs him as soon as he has stepped into the elevator. Despite the fact that Peter has pressed the button for his own floor they zip straight past it and instead the doors open on the communal level.
Natasha confronts Peter with her suspicions. The Decathlon team compete in the final and Peter learns new information that changes his world again.
Just before dinner Steve and Tony appear to introduce themselves and to invite MJ to stay, as they do with each one of Peter’s guests. The girl politely declines and states that she should really be getting home anyway.
Everything appears to be relatively quiet and then Peter hears an explosion followed by screaming, never a good sign.
Coming back to his senses Peter lurches back from the other boy’s lips, banging his head quite hard off of the wooden bedframe in the process.
Speaking of his adoptive parents, Peter’s super hearing picks up on their voices in his kitchen area. They’re laughing and he can hear Steve singing along to a song on the radio despite Tony’s pleas to stop. Peter is desperately hoping the cheerful mood the pair are in might mean he escapes any punishment or serious chat about underage drinking, but that isn’t how his luck works so he isn’t holding out hope.
“Relax паучок, you’re just a convenient first-hand account of what happened, nothing else.” Natasha whispers quietly enough that only he can hear her.
“So, Peter and Ned, what have you been up to for the past few hours?” Clint startles Peter slightly by addressing him so directly. He hasn’t had many interactions with Clint however the man has never been anything but nice and welcoming so maybe Peter shouldn’t be so shocked. He does have his own kids after all, it’s not like he’s unfamiliar with interacting with people under the age of eighteen.
When Peter has finally had enough he swings around a pillar allowing his feet to collide with the green-guy’s chest, knocking him off course and sending him spiralling through the air.
After finishing the work he settles back to watch some TV while waiting to be called for dinner, not really in the mood to be surrounded by Avengers. Especially given the pain in his shoulder, which he is desperately trying to ignore, he doesn’t fancy being around Natasha right now. He knows it’s a product of her line of work but the woman is too observant for his liking.
This one Peter decides to ignore, opening the message so that the notification disappears but leaving it at that.
“Only if you want to.” Steve reiterates. “You’re on summer vacation from school now, I know it isn’t the standard holiday destination, but we thought you might enjoy it.”
Peter's friendship with Harry develops, he has another run in with his new mysterious foe and Bucky helps Peter cope after a rough night.
When Harry said the concert was going to be in a warehouse Peter had expected to show up to a run-down old structure with rusting beams and a steel door. He did not expect everything to look so put together and not like a warehouse at all. There’s a large stage towards the back of the room where the band are setting up, a curtain of black hangs behind them highlighted by purple stage lights, wrapped around the steel beams at the edges of the room are hundreds of strings of fairy lights which somehow make the massive space feel smaller and more intimate.
In the distance he spots a strange green figure fast approaching his vantage point. As the figure gets closer Peter is able to distinguish the shape of a man standing on top of, what appears to be a hover board, clad in all green.
The attacker tilts his head to the side. “Why, it’s simple, isn’t it? I want you dead.” He speeds towards Peter again, throwing three explosives all at once.
“Yeah he went to find his friends to make sure they were okay. I should probably go find him actually, can you tell my dad’s that I’ll see them back at the Tower?”
Carefully Natasha rises, rounding the kitchen counter to stand closer to the boy. “Just… observing.” She looks him up and down, Peter doesn’t know why but he feels as though she knows all of his secrets without him ever having said a word. “Might want to get that limp looked at.” The boy blanks, his eyes going wide. “I won’t say anything.” With that the female assassin glides off to the elevator, heading away with not another word spoken.
“Oh yeah, sorry, I was, um, out on a walk.” Harry begins to lead them down a long hallway with high ceilings.
“Oh, yeah I suppose it is.” Peter continues to sip his coffee, he had forgotten the dance was coming up. Last year during the dance Ned had stayed over at Peter’s watching horror movies all night. That would be fun to do again he thinks, and this year they could invite Harry to come along. “Are you going?”
MJ just rolls her eyes and ignores the other boy until Flash gets bored and moves away to bother someone else. As the bus pulls out of the parking lot MJ reaches over to hold Peter’s hand on the seat in the space between them. Peter’s really glad Flash left because he’s certain he resembles a tomato right now.
“Kid, just how smart are you?” Peter shrugs, embarrassed by all of the attention, something Tony senses. “That is an untapped well of potential, for another time. In the meantime, Bruce, I have an equation I need you to look at…”
Once back at the tower they settle at Peter’s dining table quickly covering the surface in textbooks and notes from various classes.
Bucky stares at the pair in disbelief. “You bet on us?”
Tony crosses the room to stand beside Peter, laying an arm around his shoulders. “I see you’ve met my son.”
“Oh, come on Pete, tell me. Cause I’m oh so invested. Why haven’t you asked Michelle to be your girlfriend yet?”
The first song Peter is singing in this chapter is Black Dog by Led Zeppelin, incase anyone was wondering.
I watched an old 1940s dating etiquette video while writing this chapter, which was really weird and mysogynistic, but in that it said it was 'proper' to dress well and ask the young lady's parents for permission to take her to the dance. And I think Steve would be the type to still like the idea of being a gentleman.
I want to say a big thank you to the ongoing support I have received on this fic despite how terrible I've been at updating. It means a lot!
He takes off to start running back to the tower but as soon as his left foot collides with the sidewalk he cries out in agony. “Yup, that’s definitely sprained.” He muses aloud to himself. “How did I not notice that?”
Peter tries to talk to Harry but the boy seems to have all but shut down so he sets about collecting all of the journals that deal with anything remotely related to arachnids, gene editing or radioactive experimentations. He stuffs them into his backpack before ushering Harry out of the door.
Bucky picks his arm up and reattaches it with ease. “Don’t be jealous just because she thought of at least ten improvements you didn’t.”
Before long he’s being put into another car, the passenger seat this time, and Peter’s beginning to question whether or not any of this is actually happening. It all feels like some sort of fever dream and he doesn’t think he’s been fully tapped into reality since he first heard the explosion so many hours ago.
Peter joins in with the laughter. “Actually Harry your talents haven’t failed you today, you’re in the right place. Follow me.” Without waiting for a reaction Peter strolls back through the doors of the Tower.
“Creepy?” Steve picks up the nearest couch cushion and throws it at Tony, hitting him square in the face.
“Oh my God Peter.” Harry pulls back and cups Peter’s face in his hands. “Look at your face.” Peter’s head is forcibly turned from side to side as Harry thoroughly inspects the bruise. “Don’t ever do anything like that ever again.”
Another hour or so passes and eventually Natasha returns, this time in regular clothing that looks much more comfortable than the tight black outfit she wears for missions. The group are discussing what to get for dinner while Sam and Steve argue about what movie to watch when Peter’s phone vibrates. He pulls out the device to see a text from an unknown number on the screen.
Harry Potter has been the Captain’s most recent series to catch up on and he’s been quickly making his way through the books, watching the corresponding movie after he finishes each one. It’s been more than a little amusing for the other Tower inhabitants to see the Super Soldier’s reactions to some of the biggest moments from the series.
“Peter! You’re back much sooner than I expected. And this must be the famous Ned. Peter’s told us all about you.” Peter sniggers as Steve shakes the hand of an all but frozen Ned. The boy’s mouth is hanging open and Peter can hear Aunt May’s voice in his head saying something about catching flies.
“It has come to our attention that you have not been respecting the rules of our household.” Peter masks his face in a neutral expression, aiming to play dumb. “Peter, we know you’ve you been sneaking out of the house at night.” Mrs. Baker narrows her eyes at him, facing him with a scowl.
The news headline flashing on screen proclaims a new foe has been spotted battling Spider-Man in front of the Oscorp building. Shaky cell phone footage shows the fight from different angles and Peter watches himself rescue civilians over and over again.
Peter realises quite quickly that he already feels very comfortable around Steve and Tony. His initial instincts were correct again, he was right to trust them. He has hope for the future again thanks to this bizarre change of fate.
Just as Peter is about to ask what subjects Harry is actually interested in Ned joins them, sitting on the other side of the lunch table. Peter feels bad that he had basically forgotten about his best friend until this point, but at the same time he realises just how little he has been panicking and worrying all day thanks to Harry’s presence. Peter’s new friend has an infectious positivity and light heartedness about him which is exactly what he needs right now. Maybe the world isn’t out to get him after all.
It’s very obvious to the woman that the teen’s movements aren’t natural. He doesn’t look awkward or clumsy as she would expect someone with zero fighting skills to look, on the contrary, Peter is very obviously pulling his punches.
“I was gonna go meet up with Ned, if that’s okay.” He notices that he’s been pulling on his sweater sleeves again and makes a mental note to stop doing that. It’s always been a nervous tick for Peter, Aunt May always knew when he was lying because he would pick at his sleeves until they were frayed. Before it was small lies, in his new living situation the lies could really get him into trouble. If any of the people he now lives with figure out his secret they will probably take away the last piece of normality in his life, the only thing left that makes him truly happy, and that can’t happen.
Peter doesn’t even realise he’s walking towards the girl at first and then all of a sudden, he’s standing beside her asking MJ if she wants to come over to his for extra Decathlon practice on Wednesday night.
“Captain America? Yep.”
Peter makes his way over to the desk where he finds a few open documents lying on the top. Towards the corner of the desk underneath a lamp are two framed pictures, one of a couple on their wedding day and another of the same couple holding a laughing baby.
Peter nods. “Erm, yeah. I’m actually planning to ask MJ to go with me.”
Captain America and Black Widow come storming through the crowd to stand beside Iron Man who has safely returned the terrified band member to the ground.
“Alright squirmy Simon what’s wrong?”
Dinner is just being served by Steve and Bucky to the group of Super Heroes who appear to be debating something loudly.
By the next morning the Tower is strikingly quiet, Peter notices it particularly when he decides to have breakfast on the main floor and isn’t greeted by the now familiar sight of Steve whistling and cooking whatever his husband has convinced him to make that morning, usually some form of baked good.
Taking a deep breath Peter musters up all of the courage he has and finally decides to stop running away from this. “There’s someone else. You know there’s someone else.” Harry’s expression shifts, as if he wasn’t expecting Peter to say that. “I think you knew before I even did.”
Peter laughs a bit at the face Tony pulls when Rhodey says ‘long-suffering’. “Nice to meet you too, sorry you had to hear my terrible singing. Not a great first introduction I guess.”
Steve comes up with admittedly the most romantic idea, but it’s really old fashioned which then descends into Bucky and Sam teasing him.
He steadies himself and carefully places the item back where he found it. “Noted. Thanks for the tip.”
It’s just the two of them now and Natasha plans to get some answers one way or another. No words are exchanged as they both adopt a similar stance in anticipation of the other person throwing the first punch.
Cursing slightly Peter retrieves a bandage and some antiseptic from his backpack. He cleans the wound carefully, wincing as it stings when the antiseptic is applied. When Peter is confident the burn is clean he wraps his shoulder in the bandage and then struggles into his t-shirt, trying not to jostle the affected area too much.
Peter doesn’t go home. He walks for half an hour until he finds a nice alleyway where he changes into the suit, always stored in his backpack, and scales the nearest building to sit on the roof.
“It would be my pleasure sir.”
He starts by swinging in and catching as many falling pieces of building as he can before they squish the people below. A few times he glides in picking up people and swinging them away to the nearest safe spot.
Peter doesn’t have time to reply as the doors of the elevator open to the floor currently occupied by the two men in question. Steve spots them first jumping up off the couch to come and greet the pair.
The boy has some strange hold on Peter and he keeps finding himself wanting to spill his soul to his new friend, which could get dangerous very quickly when you’ve got as many secrets as Peter Parker does.
They have just enough time to unpack and relax for half an hour or so when they reach the hotel. Peter and Ned make themselves comfortable quickly, lounging out on their beds in companionable silence.
“Sorry dad it was kind of a last-minute decision.” Harry’s posture has changed dramatically since Norman entered the room. He’s standing straighter, almost rigid, and his hands are balled in fists by his side.
When Peter stands up on Monday morning he finds that there is virtually no pain in his leg, a pleasant surprise to say the least. He decides to keep it wrapped in Natasha’s expertly applied bandages just to be safe.
“Oh shit! Pete, are you okay?” The concern is clear on Harry’s face as he moves towards Peter.
Bruce’s eyes widen. “All of it?” Peter nods. “Aren’t you in high school?”
All of a sudden, it’s way too hot and Peter is overcome with the need for fresh air because right now his head feels really foggy. Eventually he stumbles out onto the balcony which is blissfully quiet, the change from the pounding thrum of music inside to the sound of New York at night time is more than a little disorientating. He makes his way over to the railing and takes deep breaths while looking out at the skyline.
“Promised I wouldn’t let you get hurt again didn’t I?” He smiles slightly trying to reassure Harry that everything is okay. He’s had worse, but obviously he can’t tell the other boy that.
Mr Osborn shakes Peter’s hand as he slowly draws the disapproving glare away from his son. “Richard and Mary’s boy?” Peter nods wilting slightly under Norman’s imposing gaze. “That certainly explains why you entered one of the secure areas. No doubt it was my son’s idea.” The sneer moves back to Harry’s direction now.
“Well you might not be blood related Tones but he definitely sings as badly as you do.”
Steve shakes his head exasperatedly. “Yes, this is Peter.”
He’s late for the Decathlon bus, and it’s all Sam’s fault.
MJ looks just about as uncomfortable as Peter did when her parents force the pair of them into another round of pictures before finally releasing them to get back in the car. “Tony and Steve did the same to me.” He tells the girl as they settle into the car, she cracks a smile at that and some of the tension slips away.
His best friend is nowhere to be seen but Peter can hear him moving about in the next room. He feels a surge of gratefulness for Ned, the boy that has stood by him through thick and thin, and now the boy that took care of him when he came crashing through his bedroom window on a Saturday night bloody and dressed as Spider-Man.
The blonde boy turns around smiling broadly and Peter swears his breath catches a little. “Peter, hey. I’m so sorry about this, usually I’m great with directions. No idea how I ended up here of all places.”
He leaves a few minutes later after Natasha expresses that while she won’t tell anyone she also won’t cover for him. He can work with that, but Nat is right he really does need to get better at lying.
“Very good sir, I have informed your parents.” Peter nods distractedly barely making it to his couch before passing out and falling into a deep sleep.
The next night Peter waits until he knows the Bakers are asleep, he can hear them through the wall, before dawning the suit and carefully unlatching his window to slide out. He spends the evening swinging about the city until the early hours of the morning. Spider-Man manages to stop a few robberies, a mugging and even helps a girl that is far too drunk to make it home safely. All-in-all Peter is extremely satisfied when he slides back through his window at four o’clock, he even manages to sleep soundly for a few hours before his alarm for school goes off.
Just as Peter is about to join Ned on the couch his phone rings, Harry’s name flashing on screen. “Hey Harry, everything okay?” He answers, confused as to why Harry is calling. Had Peter’s directions not been clear enough?
Harry scoffs and rolls his eyes. “Please Peter, it’s so obvious you don’t actually like her. You could do so much better.”
“We really wanted to take you on a proper vacation this year, but unfortunately some things have come up that we have to go and handle. Nothing bad or dangerous, but important nonetheless.” Steve takes over from Tony. “The place we’re going isn’t your typical holiday destination, but we figured you might like to come regardless of that.”
Sometimes Peter wonders if he will ever catch a break.
Steve ruffles Peter’s hair in greeting when they’re all sat down at the dining table, the lunch Steve prepared laid out in front of them. Conversations are light, mainly everyone present (Tony, Steve, Nat, Bucky and Sam) catching up with Bruce.
Mrs. Warren appears at the top of the stairs just as Peter dashes back into the bathroom to pretend to be cleaning, as the Bakers would expect him to be doing. “Peter?”
Harry leaves just before dinner time. Peter walks him down to the lobby and watches the fancy black car until it is out of sight. When he gets back in the elevator he lets JARVIS take him straight to his parent’s floor.
Harry seems a bit embarrassed by the question and Peter is about to intercept when Harry awkwardly responds. “You actually know my dad. Norman Osborn.”
Once he’s back in his jeans and sweater Peter checks his phone groaning audibly when he realises it’s just gone eight o’clock. He has three messages from Steve and two missed calls from Tony.
Tony walks out of the elevator a few hours after the questions have almost all but ceased and the pair are watching Star Wars. Ned is invited to stay for dinner but he had promised his mom he would be home to eat with his family. Peter walks Ned out and promises to call him that night so that he can attempt to answer even more of Ned’s questions which he is sure the boy will come up with in their time apart.
Truthfully, he can’t stop thinking about Harry and he’s spent many restless nights recently ruminating on what Sam and Bucky said.
Peter realises that this Bucky must have taken a lot of work to get back to, the one that Steve grew up with, not the super assassin. He imagines that being in Steve’s shoes can’t have been easy since he came out of the ice, and it makes Peter admire him all the more when reflecting upon all he has come through to still be stable and to want normal things like a family. With every day that passes Peter becomes more convinced that he made the right decision in allowing Steve and Tony to adopt him.
Thank you so much for reading <3
The two superheroes show Peter various different levels in the tower including their own floor, Tony’s lab, they skip over the personal floors of the other tower occupants only pausing briefly to show Peter which floor each is on. Peter thinks they must be about finished when the elevator stops one last time, opening up onto the floor below Tony and Steve’s.
Hi everyone! This started off as a one-shot that grew arms and legs so I decided to split it into a few chapters (probably three).
What does this mean for himself? What label does he use? Gay, or bisexual, or pansexual? It seems like there are too many words and Peter’s mind is slowly getting overwhelmed. He has put off thinking about this for a few months, since Harry came into his life really, and now it’s coming crashing down at once.
Ned’s eyebrows draw together as he pulls a face. “Oh please Peter, I’m sure your new life update isn’t that incredible.”
Although this was probably the wrong thing to say and Peter can see the moment Steve realises Tony’s poor choice of words as the Green Goblin says. “Okay.” And sends the second band member plummeting towards the ground.
“Hey, welcome to your new home kid.” Peter turns around at the sound of Tony’s voice, looking up to see the Avengers Tower in all its glory.
Tony leads them back over to the couch where Peter curls up in between both of his parents, head resting on Steve’s shoulder and feet placed on Tony’s lap, to watch Harry fight off Voldemort in a graveyard.
Peter stays on the platform until the train has disappeared and then slowly makes his way back to the Tower. In his pocket he can feel his phone buzzing with questions from Ned about how it went with MJ, but he decides that can wait. Right now, he has two eagerly awaiting dads to deal with.
Peter had stored away the small bit of information Tony had given him about the weapons that caused the explosion, planning to do some research of his own so that he can start trying to take down the guys making and selling the weapons. If Steve or Tony found out that he was Spider-Man and that this is what he was planning to do, there is no doubt in Peter’s mind that they would try and stop him.
Peter considers this for a moment while looking deep into Harry’s eyes where his emotions are laid bare. He reaches out to take the other boy’s hands. “Sometimes. But just because they’re gone doesn’t mean they’re not with us. The one’s that love us never really leave us.”
“Are we the first one’s here?” Ned questions while putting his bag down opposite Michelle.
Despite the cleanliness of the room throwing Peter off slightly, he is actually thankful to be in such a quiet atmosphere. The police station was loud and chaotic, which did not help with the significant amount of stress that Peter was already experiencing. In the quiet of the room Peter is able to focus on his breathing and calm his senses that have been haywire all evening. Eventually he begins to feel like he is finally back in his body, back in touch with reality. As much as this pleases Peter, it also means that all of this has been real and not a terrible nightmare like the young boy had been hoping. Before he can start over thinking and panicking again Peter decides to focus his hearing to try and pick up on what Mrs. Warren and the Bakers are discussing.
“Oh, um, Peter. I’m Peter Parker.”
Peter can feel eyes on him and he briefly meets the gaze of Natasha Romanoff who is staring him down from where she is sitting in the kitchen. He flicks his eyes away from the steely gaze as quickly as he had met it, from that brief moment alone he can tell that Natasha doesn’t believe a word he has just said.
On the walk up towards the house Peter remembers something he heard Mrs Warren say back at the police station, this must be the foster home she had been talking about. The large oak door opens after two knocks to reveal a very put-together looking couple. The woman is tall and thin with blonde hair pulled back in a bun, the man is also tall and thin with dark hair and a very severe looking face. Mrs. Warren greets them and introduces Peter.
Although she looks a bit perplexed by the invite at first MJ accepts then turns in the opposite direction from Peter and begins her walk home.
He’s just finished getting dressed when there’s a knock at his door, Peter calls to come in and Steve steps into the room. “Good morning, Tony and I made you breakfast down here.” Peter thanks him looking to leave the room, but Steve hovers making the boy think he has more to say. “I, um- I mean, we thought it would probably be best to eat breakfast with just the three of us this morning.” The look in Steve’s eyes coveys a sense of knowing as to how frayed Peter’s nerves are at the thought of returning to school.
“Yes, Master Obsorn?”
Thanks again for the continued support, I'm really enjoying writing this fic for you all :)
“You better not be flirting with my husband Barnes, not a good first impression to make on our son, he’d be desperately upset if you took Stevie away from us.” Peter blushes slightly at Tony’s words. He hasn’t heard Tony or Steve introduce him to someone as their son before, it’s a strange feeling but one Peter thinks he would like to get used to. Coming face to face with the Winter Soldier on the other hand Peter is not so sure about.
It’s almost seven and Peter is just beginning to head back to the tower when he hears a strange noise. It sounds like a plane but it’s too close to the ground. He scales the closest building and perches on a fire escape, assessing his surroundings, looking for the source of the strange noise.
Ned waves shyly and takes a seat beside Peter and Steve who quickly engages the boy in a conversation.
The text message from MJ is glaring up at him from his phone;
Tony finds the pair in the middle of a deep discussion about the German occupation of France when he exits the elevator.
Peter pulls his mask off as his friend’s confused and terrified face swims into view, he manages to croak out, “Ned. Help.” Before the world goes black.
Mrs. Warren takes her leave about twenty minutes later, after explaining to Peter that she will be back tomorrow to discuss more about the foster care system, adoption and everything else with him. The Bakers are nice enough, if not a bit too stern, they show Peter to his room where there is a clean pair of pyjamas and a toothbrush waiting for him. As the Bakers leave Peter gets acquainted with his new surroundings and sends a thanks to whatever God might be out there that he doesn’t have to share his room.
