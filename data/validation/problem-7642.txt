"Not at all, Captain Rogers. I rather think that you will be very pleased as to Sir's plans. Thus the shower and change of clothes. Miss Primrose may come along if you wish, or I could have Master Clint come to take her on her usual walk."
"I'm Winter," was the casual answer, sass thankfully absent. Winter's focus was entirely on Bucky, who was staring back at him with wide eyes as the color slowly drained from his cheeks. "Captain Marvel asked me to stop by. What are you wearing?" He added with a frown at his counterpart. "Steve told me you were done running. You look like a hobo."
"Thanks starry skies." He paused, taking a moment to wish all the interlopers would leave and give him a second with his daughter. "Thanks for taking them through the portal." She only sniffed and curled closer to Winter, who covered her with one large hand. It wasn't the time to try and talk it out, so he let her be and ambled to the kitchen table. "I still don't get why you all are here when you should be, you know, keeping your own planet safe."
Tony rolled over and eyes his omega, he had been up way too long.  Long gone were the days of 72-hour invent-a-tons, now he was beat after your standard workday and chasing around two little ones. Today had been a nice reprieve, he only had one SI meeting to attend then took Steve out to dinner at a nice fusion restaurant. A really classy sort of joint that you have to reserve a month in advance. All in all, it had been a good night. “Steve, if there’s a point to this I’d love to hear it babe. In 10 words or less if you can manage.”
“To most no,” Kurt said stirring his own tea. “But to those with children like Wade...They would not mind. This I sometimes think is a good and bad thing. On the one hand without the lax restrictions, I would not have my family, on the other...”He paused looking sad.“I know that not all of the children who leave those places go to loving homes.”
It hadn't been an 'I love you' or an 'atta boy' but it was enough. He still has that letter, stuffed in a shoe box in the back of the closet, with all the other things it hurt too much to remember, but also too much to forget.
“Tony!”
“Your grandmother is waiting and Jar can let himself out if he so desires. Come now finish putting on your armor and let’s go.”
It smelled like Cedar with a gentle hint of something spicy beneath. Tossing the ball into the quick filling bath, he looked on amused as the water erupted in green and sparkled with gold. “How absolutely ridiculous...I love it.”
Loki was torn, part of him wanted to stay and comfort the now panic-stricken pups and distressed omega. He fought his own emotions and the tug of his bond just to stand up straight. Steve was fairing far worse it seemed which meant Stark wasn't fairing as well as his James. Loki felt guilty for the sigh of relief at that thought. He did his best to help Pepper gather the children away while Bruce saw to his packs lead omega. This was not easy as little Peter and Wendy wanted nothing to do with being away from their barer at the moment.
Steve was loosing his mind. His fingers lacing back through the billionaire’s dark hair griping it to the root. He pinched his eyes closed when Tony finally swallowed him down.  “Fuck…” he breathed and couldn’t take it anymore, Tony knew exactly every button to press. That bastard.
The fight was starting to drain out of the Captain, this was just Steve from Brooklyn with shining eyes trying to hard to be strong.
“Jerk”  Steve laughed, a hand unconsciously settling on his swollen abdomen. “I’m glad to see you doing so well, really glad Buck.”
No one hated Tony more...than Tony .
So a few days after the press conference, just after sundown; every house, apartment, trailer, and so on; from the most modest dwelling to the most lavish - placed two white candles on their window ledges and turned out all the lights for one hour.
manage to go to sleep, he'd only wake up screaming from nightmares about how things could have gone wrong. He'd learned after his first 'real' Avengers fight that he needed to give his conscious mind some time to process before he let his unconscious mind take over. "If I have trouble sleeping tomorrow night I'll talk ta someone about it," he added, sensing Peter's concern. "That's the deal I made with Uncle Rhodey. He or aunt Carol will probably find you tomorrow to talk about coping and shit. More than they already have I mean."
Even trying would make him an ass. Tony might not be interested in touching him, but if he was asked Steve knew the man would feel obligated. He didn't want that. He didn't want to make Tony uncomfortable.
"Are you gonna sleep?" Harley weighed the answers he could give, then shrugged a shoulder.
"We're not going
"Tony? Think ya could maybe tell me what you're actually talking about?" As much as he loved hearing Tony ramble, he really, really wanted to know what the present was. Besides, his fella would probably be happier if he saved the really long rambles for when he was going over the features of... whatever it was.
Comments warm my soul greatly even though lately I've been crap at responding to them. Thanks so much for reading! :D
"If I ever decided to disembowel you, Natasha wouldn't know to come to me for tips. No one would suspect me of anything." The sugary-sweet tone of her voice made him shudder, and he gulped in fear that wasn’t entirely pretend. Eyes dancing and lips curved up in a wicked smile, she leaned in to whisper in his ear. "And nobody would ever find the body."
"Yeah. I never.... Christ, you know me so well."
Video game turns were serious business at Avengers Tower, and there Tony was offering to hand his over. That prompted more blushing until it felt like his whole face and the back of his neck were on fire. "That's okay," he said quietly, knowing that his smile was too shy to be normal.
"He knows I'm talking about him. And he's keen to get home - he loves hanging out with Spider-Gwen just as much as I do. If we accidentally miss that family date because we leave here too late he's going to be pissed." Suddenly he was being hugged by himself, which was just... really fucking weird. Great, because he was an awesome hugger, but still. Didn't stop him from hugging back tightly, feeling a little bit forlorn. He
Harley was angling for a golden apple from Thor, since his Captain Marvel looked to be pretty much immortal. Tony was pretty sure that he'd get it.
"If I didn't love ya so goddamn much I would throttle ya," Steve hissed before stalking over to Pepper. The red-headed traitor patted Steve's shoulder in sympathy while glaring at him which was fucking unfair, but whatever. She hadn't been there to see how fiercely Rogers had defended Bucky, hadn't seen the way grief twisted Steve's face whenever he brought the guy up. She'd learn soon enough and he could say 'I told you so' with a clear conscience.
"Maybe. But I don't have a super soldier metabolism to worry about."
"But?"
"Ya did. Now ya know better."
Two things that are different from canon!!
would never do something like that. I'm going to be very responsible with these babies. But you never know - I might lose some. If that were to, hypothetically speaking, happen and someone used those misplaced arrows for evil... well. I bet Hill would be pissed enough that they'd start searching the vents for me on the wrong assumption that I did it. It would be a great opportunity for someone - some arrow stealing, very naughty someone who is definitely not going to be me - to sneak into Fury's office through means other than the vents."
"You would never sent them without you unless things were dire," Lokes interjected when Shellhead couldn't seem to make himself continue. "We thought we might arrive to find you dead."
"Just shut up and help me."
Sometimes it seemed like all he did anymore was try and shut brains and bellies up.
Maybe they would have said more, kept teasing and playing, but the sound of an approaching aircraft cut their fun short. And he
"I have analyzed the vessels, Colonel, but their exterior is uniform. The only weak point appears to be the door."
"Grabbing at people without permission is not acceptable. The music was bad and I do not like dancing, so I gave myself a mission."
Dum-E returned and began nudging at his hand with that silly ball, and Steve felt his smile go soft. "And this one - he wants so bad to help out. He loves findin' all my pencils and makin' sure I get 'em back. Counts 'em, you know. If I try to start a sketch before he gets all seventeen back, my buddy here gets all kinds of upset, like he thinks he failed somehow. Once he couldn't find two of them, which was fine... but he wouldn't play fetch that day." He ran his hand down Dum-E's main strut, then gave his claw a few pats. "Wouldn't let me throw the ball even once until he found those last two." The 'bot whistled to acknowledge the affection but was quick to nudge his hand again. Steve relented and threw the ball again, then watched Dum-E chase after it before shrugging.
“‘Cause Clint planted those damn gunk bombs all over the trainin’ room! JARVIS said he was headed this way and I came ta give him a piece of my mind. Then I ran into all this other shit--”
was important, and that he had to go meet him. Tony was being stubborn about... something, and their oldest girl was pretty much refusing to give him the full story out of fear that he'd get stubborn too. It was all very close to being too much, and dammit he needed to try and take this seriously.
And anyway at least STAR hadn't abandoned him. She'd hopped off Steve's shoulder and was now settling on his, one tiny hand pressed reassuringly against his pulse point. "I won't let him hurt you," she whispered, easing the knot of tension lodged in his chest where Roger's shield had hit. "None of them will get close. And if that witch is here... Dr. Strange taught me some things and you have the amulet he sent for you. It's going to be okay Tony. I promise."
He’d been in medical for almost four days, during which he had suffered through a teary visit from Pepper and a pretty intense facetime session with Rhodey. His best friend was stuck in the desert for another week before he could get any leave time, but he’d be showing up as soon as he could.
He couldn't help but sigh as he looked over at the reason she'd asked the question. Tony - it was always Tony - and Clint were playing some video game that involved shooting at each other. Steve wasn't sure which one it was, because they all looked the same to him. He liked the more stylized stuff, like Mario and Spyro; he always knew what he was playing. His teammates were happy with the ones that were supposed to be all 'realistic' though, and Tony and Clint seemed to be having a good time. A really good time, one that involved leaning heavily against each other while they trash talked. Sometimes they'd throw elbows or sling an arm around each other's shoulders. Every time he won a round. Clint would press a smacking kiss to Tony's cheek and Steve knew Tony was only pretending to hate it. They were close and comfortable with each other, seemed to be constantly touching, and if he didn't know better he would absolutely think they were going steady.
"Um."
A few months ago only Rhodey or Pep would have known how to do that.
"Listen here, you Star Spangled Sneak--"
He could
"Or maybe ya just don't wanna see the truth, just like ya don't with Tony. I didn't steal him, and I didn't ruin your... relationship with him neither." God, he didn't like the way that sounded. Like maybe Rogers thought he wanted to be more than Tony's friend or something. That was just... no. "It was your choices that drove him away. That had nothin' ta do with me. And Tony lovin' me is a damn miracle that doesn't have nothin' ta do with
"Sorry Legolas. I don't drink to get drunk anymore, and if you slip anything in my drink I'm kicking you out on your ass."
(See the end of the chapter for
“Nope.” Despite knowing it was a bad idea, Tony let himself lean harder against his friend. “I was kind of thinking Italian though, so maybe I’ll get some pasta.”
Everyone was having fun and that was more important than any bruised pride Steve would be incurring if he gave a shit about being good at the game. As it was, he found it as funny as the rest of them and he couldn't wait for Pepper and Alicia to get so fed up with it all that they combined forces to do a routine that brought the house down and shattered all previous records. They were as good as Steve was terrible and it was always fun to watch.
As Bruce was mulling the invitation over, Captain America wandered into the common kitchen. He was clearly fresh from the gym - so fresh he hadn't even showered yet, which shouldn't have been as attractive as it was. Tony thought a lot of that came from the way Cap was much more loose-limbed than usual. He looked almost happy, or at least his face wasn't as tight as it usually was. It was a good look on him, and the way he liked his shirts at least two sizes too small certainly didn't hurt.
is what he meant. He was pretty sure the man had caught that less than subtle probe because he brought Tony's fingertips to his mouth and gave them a light kiss.
. She was... upset. I had learned I would be a monster. Like Red Skull."
"She grieves for him," he agreed with another sigh. "And he is too stubborn to accept her aid the way he ought."
Before he'd finished saying her name she had the stand lit up. Like Rescue, the suit it held was brand-spanking new and gleamed softly. Gone was all the red, white and blue and not just because it made him remember a shield coming down on his chest. Steve and he had talked a little about what he wanted and what he didn't. One thing he'd been adamant about was not 'stealing' Captain America.
dad."
"That will be all, Mr. Stark."
"Alright son, that's enough--"
Steve liked that even if they weren't going steady he would never be alone as long as Tony was his friend.
I have it on extremely good authority that there were hostile alien visitors well before New York. They were simply far more subtle and for good reason. Before now Earth has been protected by two things. One of those was the forces of Asgard. I think it's quite obvious why we can no longer rely on that.
He thought about Peter, who sounded like he really, really needed to believe that coping got easier.
"You're damn lucky he doesn't exploit the hell out of that." Rhodey took his beer with a nod of thanks then let out a heavy sigh. "So. Welcome to the club." He knocked his bottle against Steve's and they both took a long swig. Being so goddamn worried about Tony all the time wasn't fun, but he was grateful for the reminder that he wasn't alone doing it. Even apart from the Avengers, Tony had people who cared about him, who would probably do just about anything for him.
They both fell silent, Steve allowing himself to smile at the memory. Bucky had been like a cat with its back up, so damned offended that it had almost been enough to break though his shell on its own. The night as a whole wasn't a great memory. It was too filled with hurt and anger, too rife with the knowledge of where it had all led. Still. There had been comfort in a shared cigarette, and they had found a small bit of peace it the quiet night.
I know, Little Mechanic. You know me but you do not remember. You were even more of a child when I touched your life and made you mine.
"Harley Keener, watch your mouth!"
He was one of mine, little Mechanic, just as he was yours. And he chose to give that up, chose to give his life in service of you and your world to keep Mind from spreading the taint Thanos had cast upon it. Because of who he was, who you are to both of us... I chose to accept his sacrifice. It follows the spirit of the rules, if not the letter of them. I am Soul, and I decide when such spirit should be honored. I hold him close to me, little Mechanic, and treasure him the way you did.
," Peter complained while they all headed down the hall to the elevator. "He isn't there now, so how could your weird GPS thingy have any idea where he 'should' be in that universe?"
“So you said.” It was hard to put amusement in his voice and even harder not to shove her away in a show of disgust. She smelled like alcohol and cigarettes with a hint of cloying floral perfume to complete the mix. At his other side was her male companion, the one who had stared hungrily at Steve but shifted his attention easily enough once she had.
"Anyway, I scrapped it and started over a couple of times because it wasn't right and maybe this one isn't quite there either, but J pointed out I could keep tweaking it forever and not be happy with it so it was better to just rip off the band-aid. I got a lot of original parts and repurposed them and I hope it doesn't bring up bad memories - fuck maybe I shouldn't have... if you hate it that's fine. I can come up with a better design. I mean, I also sort of centered your new suit around this one but I could make it work with something else. Anyway--"
“That’s not what I mean and ya know it. Wait. That’s not the point here.”
As he got older, he got even more excited when he realized that Howard - the one who had belittled his little robot dog before crushing it under his heel, then roared at Tony for crying over the loss - might get better once he had located his lost friend. Once Captain America came back, everything would be alright. And sure, Cap wouldn't like Tony much - he was too sensitive, too irritating,
The New Avengers are rumored to be courting superheroes from international locations, but for now the details are scarce. It is assumed that recruitment will remain active, as there are always new individuals developing or being discovered as having abilities that are 'super'.
"I don't need a translator, dust mop. And yes, we're going and yes, you need coats. Last time you two were 'only going to be in the mansion' you came home covered in mud and telling me all about your adventures. You're both lucky I'm not making you wear... what the hell does Rhodey call them? Wading boots or something. FRIDAY--"
Tony woke to the smell of sausage cooking, the sound of the shower, and a slightly warm indent where Steve had previously been laying. He smiled at his thoughtful
So! Next chapter will involve a time skip element, and I'd kind of like to show that with some vignettes in a style I don't usually do. I'm gonna have some kind of 'press release' that'll detail all of the New Avengers and reveal Steve's new superhero name.
When the petal was nothing but flames, twisted metal and dead monsters, he and Rhodey moved on. Several of the remaining demon-dogs tried to leap high enough to drag them down to earth, but their crazed attacks were easy to evade. Captain Marvel was leading a charge into their ranks, only a token defense left around the Tesseract as the battle had turned in their favor. It distracted a good portion of the demon-dogs and left him and Rhodey to do their work mostly uninterrupted.
But his warm, calloused hand was still on Steve's bare arm, so. It was absolutely a mark in the 'Win' column.
"He's going to be furious if you try to make him the leader."
"Stuff just like this got me through the European countryside, you know. Good to have in a pinch. Maybe I oughta start carrying some with me again just in case. You wouldn't have had to wait so long that way. Ah, there we go. Now I have your interest, don't I sweetheart? Don't worry, this is for you. Not all at once though or you'd probably get sick. Doesn't look like you've been eating much."
Fuck.
“Yeah, well. Anybody touches you like that again and I’m gonna have ta leave to get my shield. So you maybe wanna…” More blushing, and Tony hid another smile in Steve’s shoulder. If he took a good whiff of the way the guy smelled at the same time that was his own damn business. It wasn’t his fault the cologne the man wore mingled perfectly with his preferred detergent and the layer of just plain Steve that underlied it. Sometimes he wanted to just roll around in that scent like a cat enjoying catnip.
Tony lost hold of the large drill bit he had been using as a microphone. It clattered to the ground along with the shreds of his dignity. Damn thing landed on his foot too, because of course it did. He couldn't bite back the urge to cuss quick enough, and so the show continued with him swearing and hopping up and down on one leg because it had hurt like a
"You alright big guy?"
. Either way, she didn't advance when Sam took a step forward, though Tony was pretty sure she'd be ready to throw down if needs be. He was ready for things to get even messier even if she'd relaxed, but to his surprise Steve wasn't quite as lost in fury as his actions suggested. Once Sam was almost in punching range himself, Steve got off Rogers in one fluid motion, and he didn't look back once while stalking back to Tony's side.
Besides... he was never leaving Tony again. This was his world now, and he was going to learn everything he needed to in order to be a part of it.
, but I understand and I won't fight ya over it. If what he needs is for me ta stay away, then that's what I'll do." He'd seen the aftermath of what happened when Rogers' priorities had narrowed down to a field of one person. From what he could see, his other self hadn't even much cared what the other Bucky wanted. Rogers had just chased after his friend, determined to reclaim the past no matter the cost.
So there was a little explanation/rant for anyone who wanted it or was interested in my justifications. XD
"Not tonight. Sometimes after a big fight I... don't." He was exhausted physically, but his brain was still running in overdrive, still demanding he try and figure out how to be better next time. If he

"Look, it's... I mean. Da's from here, and I think maybe he always wanted to kidnap you and bring you here. Especially after what happened with
"I... I guess we could do that. But I'm not staying there even if you change your minds!"
"In a couple of weeks. I told her. We'll be ready for her teeth then. I hope so anyway, because even if we definitely just saved half the universe she isn't going to hold back. She's got questions about why the shields over Shenzhen failed so quickly, and she's also curious about why we don't regularly ask your friends from the Defenders to help during more challenging fights if it might save the lives of citizens."
"FRIDAY was right - you do sound like him. Not the accent or anything 'cause he doesn't have one, but the rest of it. You sound just like Cap. I mean, I didn't talk to him long because, you know, we were on opposite sides, but still. Are you sure you aren't him?"
~.~.~
"Moron." He made a noncommittal noise that earned a snort from Winter before the man slung an arm around his shoulders. The feeling was one that was finally familiar again, but not so much so that he didn't still revel in it. Leaning hard against his friend, he sighed quietly.
of all people and in his kitchen of all places. It was just too much to handle at... 1:30 in the afternoon.
He didn't even use anyone's real name when he did it, which had Steve gnashing his teeth in righteous anger long before Loki's staff had come into play. It was easy to reject every bit of good he could see in Tony - and Christ, there was so much of it if you knew how to look - and focus on that instead. He told himself that Tony was everything he hated about the future combined with everything he'd hated about his past, and Steve had tried so, so hard to hate him too.
Steve's heart had stuttered for a beautiful, painful moment when Tony said 'I love you'. Sure it had been implied and all, but actually hearing it was... Christ, it was everything. He felt a little breathless, head spinning a little because this was sort of every dream come true.
a little bummed when the seemingly abandoned glaive and spear followed after them like faithful dogs. He'd really wanted to deconstruct and study them - it was a loss he'd totally take now that the enemy was down two heavy hitters.
The door didn't slam open, exactly, but it was certainly pushed inward with a good amount of force. If it hadn't been for Fri's warning he would have gone into protective mode immediately, but mostly he was just curious. A little worried, sure... but curious. That only intensified when he realized that the 'man' standing in the door was actually a teenage boy, hair a wild mess of shaggy strands once he pulled off a baseball cap and hurled it dramatically to the ground.
She wouldn't get into it today, he knew that much. That wasn't how Pepper worked unless she was in an emergency situation - that was when she went in guns blazing. Otherwise she liked a series of steady and organized steps. Still, she did let go of his hand and took a few steps forward. Her fingers ghosted over Rescue's mask, then trailed down the suit's throat and shoulder. Then, like he knew it would, her hand fell to that light shining out of the suit's chest.
Dum-E zoomed after the ball, making all kinds of noises that told Steve just how happy he was. He missed the ball on the first bounce - almost definitely on purpose - then got to chase after it again when it hit the leg of a table and headed a different way. A warm smile on his lips, he turned away to start drawing, because Dum-E always took a while to get bored enough to have someone throw the ball again. When he did though, it was to find Tony standing way closer than he had been, an unreadable expression on his face.
"It rips me up inside, what he did," Steve told me about the Captain America of our world. "I love Tony more than anything, and to have anyone hurt him is... but it wasn't just anyone. Steve Grant was part of Tony's team, someone he trusted. Someone that looked like me. I didn't... after I found out I didn't want to be Captain America anymore, to be honest with you. That's another reason I like being Maverick better."
"Wise decision." She pressed a kiss to his cheek before ruffling his hair, then left the workshop with the steady sound of her heels hitting the floor a familiar comfort to his ears. Tony couldn't ever properly say how much he loved her, just like his feelings for Rhodey, JARVIS and his boys would be impossible to articulate. Maybe someday he'd be able to say the same for Bruce, Nat, Clint and Thor.
Instead he was answering the damn door in his Iron Man pajamas that he really hadn't wanted anyone but Thor to know he owned. The God of Thunder had been the one to buy them for him as a present, which was the only reason he had been allowed to live with the knowledge.
"Earth to Tony? You've got that gross look on your face again, the one that means you're thinking about Steve. You're
"More threats?"
There was a pressure building in his left temple, one that didn't make sense with the small injuries he'd taken. Tony did his best to ignore it, shake it off, but it was
"I had some questions. 'Bout the world and stuff. About the Avengers."
"There ya go. That's better already. I'll meet ya at home soon, okay? Gotta be here ta back Rhodey a bit longer'n then I'll come runnin'. Take care-a your pops now."
"Tony!" He hoped the laughter in his voice would soften the interruption; sure enough Tony was grinning when he looked up. "Can it and let me talk a minute, will ya? I know she needs a name and I've been thinking of which one to give her. Just... I wanted to wait for you. Thought you might like a say in it."
“You sit here, okay? He’s gonna… look. Just because a guy takes a few precautions--”
What?
to get this right. "The stakes are always high when the Avengers are called in. That's just the deal. There's always the chance you're gonna get hurt, that maybe you won't make it, and that's always a little scary for me and prob'ly most of the others. I
It meant he'd be sitting next to Tony, who was looking over at him again while the archer gleefully shot Tony's character full of holes. This time the smile he offered was genuine - the genius' answering smile lit up his whole face. It was enough to make a guy blush, and it wasn't the first time he'd cursed his fair skin when Tony was around. He ducked his head to try to hide it but couldn't banish the grin from his face. Even though he was tempted to sit close enough that he and Tony would be pressed together from shoulder to knee, he collapsed onto the couch closer to the arm rest.
Everything in Steve turned cold at those words, as cold as the ice that had claimed him for so long. Tony had come so close to... Christ, watching him fall had been torture, and then there'd been that horrible moment of not knowing before JARVIS confirmed that his creator was alive. Barely, the AI had said, sounding so lost and scared that Steve had almost fucking panicked. He had almost lost Tony, might have lost Tony if Thor hadn't swooped in to carry him to medical. He could have lost Tony without the man ever knowing how he felt, and... and…
Before he could get any further the man yanked his hand away and moved to put the bed between them. It was purely defensive, he got that, but it still hurt. His lover couldn't even look at him, and was instead staring up at the ceiling while rubbing his chest where the arc reactor had once been. Where, more recently, Captain America had put the shield through his chest, and Mother of
"Go to sleep Stevie. Me'n rest will see you in the morning."
Thor in particular seemed charmed. He'd also been ready to go on quest of blood vengeance against her former owner, whoever that was. It had taken a lot of talking to convince him to let it go and focus on giving her a good home in the moment. Besides, he knew that Nat and Clint were making quiet inquiries of their own. Whatever they did to whoever it was would be a lot nastier than anything Thor could come up with. It'd have a nice, vicious twist of poetic justice too, which he sort of approved of but also never wanted to know about.
"Okay, so now that I have your approval, Peppy Princess--"
"Whatever she said, it still don't mean ya gotta do this. Rogers isn't gonna like it, so he's gonna be an ass."
and smile. Steve returned it, then brought their hands up to brush a gentle kiss over his knuckles. "I got this, sweetheart, unless ya wanna keep yellin'."

That was probably from fury and humiliation as much as from lack of oxygen. It was fucking beautiful.
The near-silence was heavy, almost uncomfortable and kept from smothering him only by the presence of his siblings. Moments from the battle kept flashing through his mind, all the little things that had gone wrong and could have gone so much worse. He couldn't help but play them over and over, trying to figure out what he could have done differently, done better. And while he tried not to give in to all the gruesome imaginings of the worst case scenarios, he couldn't keep them all at bay. There'd been a moment while fighting the cave troll that he'd been
"Boy, have they done a number on you. Did they tell you that? Did they tell you that you couldn't be Bucky? I know that Hydra used you to do terrible things," Rogers was almost impressively earnest as he stepped towards Winter, and Steve almost felt bad for him. If he hadn't been ignoring every red flag Winter was throwing up, he would have really been feeling for the guy. "But it wasn't

"I have to talk to your mom."
I'm sure. However, I suspect that if you look them over you will find that most if not all of them involve questioning the motives or actions of Mr. Stark. I have given you those answers already, and if you require more than I suggest you meet with Mr. Stark himself. Do you have any remaining questions about SI's role in the current endeavor? Substantive questions, if you please. This has been enough of a waste of my time, so I don't wish to prolong it dealing with petty minutiae that could be dealt with via written questions and answers.
To win the battle, little Mechanic. To stop the abuse of Thanos before it goes too far.
I suggest you think long and hard about what you are hoping to accomplish here. If you aren't looking to discredit or disgrace Mr. Stark, if you have genuine concerns not motivated by personal or political gain, stop looking to Mrs. Weatherby for answers. Her dislike of Mr. Stark is well known, and her inability to set those feelings aside to work with him in her role as a member of the Committee does not speak well of her character. I am willing to offer you the benefit of the doubt here, Mr. Poppleton, and I hope that our next meeting will be more satisfactory for the both of us.

"You're ridiculous'n I love ya. Now. All we had for dinner was movie snacks. Do ya want me ta make somethin' more fillin'?"
“J, scan the police ban and cross reference with CCTV and current warrants by facial recognition. Violent crimes.”
Fury tuned his back on the solider, coat furling behind him. “I won the war Captain Rogers.”
Coulson smiled and walked down the hallway, idly flipping the hinged top on the lighter open and closed. “Gentleman.”
There was one thing that Amora had neglected to consider in her great plan, she may have found the wonder of the see in the baby boy’s eyes…but she did look at his hair.
That usually how these things went, even when he was the infamous Winter Soldier. Then again, maybe he still was- just with out the cold eyes behind his trigger finger. This time he'd remember it all because SHIELD was just ‘humane’ like that.
Of course, it didn’t take long for his former teammates to come banging on his door asking what he was thinking.
Bruce nodded running his hand over the ancient looking tomes Thor had delivered from Asgard. “A little bit. Think I could give you hand today?”
When they arrived, Steve held open the door as any gentlemen would, so set in his ways,  but it made Loki smile just a little as it reminded him of James. His alpha always pulled out his chair and held the door, something he'd come to understand was not customary in these days as it had been before.
AN: ....i have no excuse for myself right now
Looking back now as Steve sits with his sketchbook in the gym, watching Bucky and Tony play basketball. Tony maneuvering the chair on his own these days. Doctors saying he may be out of it this time next year, though chances were Tony would always have issues walking. Still, just watching the two men he cared most about horsing around laughing filled his heart. The way Bucky would stop and bend down placing a kiss between Tony's eyes. They way they both would look over and shout for him to 'quit being an art geek'.
It could have happened. Even if it was just a nightmare, Loki knew that story could be similar to any of the lives lost that day. Lives he could never give back to those that loved them. So maybe this was his true punishment. What was it the mortals said, an eye for an eye?
The omega summed the strength to pull away howerver. “Oh I'm sure you could sweetheart, but I'd rather safe all that.” Steve side steped with a smirk over his shoulder “After all, I was always taught to save my desert until after dinner. Good manners ya know?”
A raven brow lifts in interest at the phrase. “Oh is that so, and are you my love...Starving?”
James Barnes might not have been an Alpha, but when it came to Steve, he could certainly act like one. Reaching out to cup the slender Youngman’s face, he smiled. “I promise I’ll come back and ya know what? The Military said that betas with service records will be able to legally mate with omegas after the war so…so…” He fumbled over his words.
Tony nodded and set his own cup down, “Yeah well can’t say I’m a picture of such macho perfection cause I cried at the end of Fast and Furious 7.” By the confused look on the others, face Stark waved off the reference. “Point is, I watched him hold that in and when it came out. It was hard to see, harder to deal with but I somehow pulled my shit together and did it. We made it through all that ugly painful crap and came out the other side. The is an other side to it.”
Steve watched as the mer's glittering eyes rolled back and the red finned male began to sink. He tenderly lifted the siren into his arms and began to make for the surface. “I have the target.”
"I'd kill myself before takin' advantage-a him that way," Steve told him, doing his best to stay calm and in control. If they both lost their cool it would only end in blood.
It was going to be okay.
"You're terrible at this, Tiny Adorable Steve."
Steve's mind stumbled over the question - Russian was harder than he had thought when he'd asked Nat to teach him. He still loved it though, even when she spent hours refusing to speak English to him. The language was completely new, with no real associations to anything in his past. Sure he'd heard it a few times at the front, but not often. Hearing it from Nat's lips never sent him back, never had his brain making connections that threw his thoughts into a downward spiral.
"Even before we were in the room with the staff I was acting like a jerk, Tony. I just..." Tony was kind of fascinated by how easily Steve seemed to blush. Maybe when you were pale like that it didn't even mean anything and he shouldn't read into it, but... it was really something to watch happen. "Things were sideways in my head, and I didn't... I didn't even really wanna be... and you're so much, Tony - in a good way, honest, but I wasn't ready for anything good. That's no excuse and my ma would tan my hide for being so rude and never apologizin' proper. None of that was really about you, Tony. I was being an ass and then I didn't know how..."
Briefly the thought of a teen already carrying the title of hero niggled at his mind, but he quickly brushed that away. He'd gotten Underoos hurt, dragged him into a battle he'd never needed to be part of. Peter Parker had been better off without him and he didn't need Tony to keep poking his nose into his life. It was... it was better this way.
it took him a moment to finally turn his head and look at Winter.
Tony's mouth parted in a surprised gasp under his own, and he had less than a heartbeat to worry that maybe-- But then the genius surged against him, his arms going around Steve's neck. The kiss was clumsy, full of more desperation than he might have liked... but it was also perfect. It was him and Tony, both of them breathless and soon smiling too wide to keep going. Now he knew that Tony's lips were much softer than he would have expected and knew what that ridiculous goatee felt like tickling his skin. He knew how it felt to have Tony pressed tight against him; he knew what the genius' laugh tasted like.
"So I'm just supposed to--"
Eventually his princess had enough of that and climbed to her feet before making her way over to the genius. He watched as Tony tensed up more and more with every step she took... but he also didn't run away. He just watched her with that same guarded hope, and it was just about enough to break Steve's heart. He wondered if young Tony hadn't tried to bring home a stray or two only to have it taken away because pets weren't allowed at the Stark household. He wondered again what had happened to the metal substitutes Rhodey had mentioned, and he knew that Tony hadn't been avoiding her because he didn't want a dog or because he didn't care about her.
been having fun. The Rogue Avengers were on their way -
“There there. C’mon Steve - he was just having a little fun.”
~.~.~
We were never meant for mortal hands. He thinks he is so clever, hiding his away and using the gauntlet instead, but it will not be enough to save him.
super-kid if we have to. So she isn't lonely."
Tony had said there were too many variables for him to risk coming, even to support Winter. Steve knew that his fella just wasn't ready to face his mother's killer and hadn't questioned the decision. In a rare show of tact, Winter hadn't pushed either. Hell, the former assassin had just ruffled Tony's hair on the way out the door, his cold eyes thawing a few degrees in a show of kindness and understanding.
She sighed and sat down next to her employer and friend, placing a hand on his knee. “The fact that you feel that way says a lot Tony. Nevertheless, you’re still wrong. This isn’t just your choice, if you care about Steve, you will let him decide what’s right for him. I know that’s hard for you but you have to realize that Steve isn’t  that glowing idol of perfection that your Father said he was. Captain America is an idea, we are talking about Steve Rogers. He’s still that 25 year old kid he was 70 years ago and right now he thinks that you don’t want him.”
“Don’t be silly sugar buns, of course I didn’t that would be silly. I did put a fantastic shower in it though. Five rainfall heads and three massage jets. It’s really great you’re gonna love it.”
Tony was doing a quick fly over looking for any stray bots, he found their design laughable. The wiring and construction had been ‘post-modern erector set’ in his words. Still it was a good work-out, he had been bored doing the Stark phone updates all morning anyway. It was also an excuse to try out a few new upgrades to the suit by using the failing androids for target practice.
Fishing out the device, he frowned at the caller ID, not Loki. Not anyone who would normally bother calling him up just to shoot the shit as it were.
“It already has...” The words where choked and harsh, they sounded nothing like the ravens elegant tongue. Loki walked away silently, not even bothering to tell Kurt to stop following him. They ended up entering a small meeting room near the library. It was a quiet out of the way spot, one that Loki had frequently sought as a place of solace between classes or after a long day in which had no wish to return to an empty home. He sat facing one of the long windows with its view of the forest and grounds. “Have you and your mate ever discussed children.”
He does look, but looking doesn't make him feel better. This Tony seems younger, brighter, and sturdier. This man in front of him looks like the smiling photos in the dossier from SHIELD years ago. He wants to pull away because isn't this proof enough that he must be crazy? He doesn't want to though, he wants to sit in those chocolate eyes and feel these hands on his. “Tony...what happened. How are you here?”
Captain America could make everything better. Tony could live with his hero sneering at him and making the same cruel remarks as his dad if it meant that Howard himself would be happier. He had still loved the man then, loved him with the uncomplicated fierceness of a child. All he had wanted was for his dad to be happy, because if Howard was happy... maybe someday Tony would show him a design and Howard would smile at him like he did in those old pictures.
"Jerk."
, between his two lives. He'd do it all without complaint, and he would do his best to hide how fucking sad it made him. Steve would try to get the boys to be just as understanding. He would try to stop any pranks and would be fierce in his defense if anyone else tried to make an issue of the whole thing.
"You drive a hard bargain kid."
"We don't."
and he would never not be grateful for that.
"Pffft. More like he and Ned are building Lego stuff. He just doesn't wanna be here because this is--"
(See the end of the chapter for
"How noble."
"I ain't killing trees just because it's easier," Steve argued back. He was still at my feet cleaning up, so I could see the way the back of his neck went pink. I have to tell you that Maverick is in possession of a thick, wonderful Brooklyn accent. It was enough to make me swoon, especially with the way he was kneeling in front of me. Tony was watching me like he knew what I was thinking, and it was my turn to blush when he winked again.
"Mary Mother-a.... sweetheart, I'm not-- no. Later. You'll see and we'll talk later. I sent the Defenders that came up ta the Penthouse - thought ya might not want 'em on our floor and Pep said she don't mind. Alicia took the kids--"
"... Tony, I want to spend some workshop time with you."
Peter instead-a leavin' him behind. He thinks ya hate him, Tony."
"You're a dork, cookie crumble." It was impossible not to blush whenever he heard that stupid nickname so he didn't even try. He tried to ignore the way Tony chuckled, the sound shivering pleasantly along his spine. "So... we have a dog. If you come home with a baby next time we are going to have words."
"I want that too," Tony breathed before pulling back just enough to look up into his eyes again. "Jesus fuck I want that too. But even after... shit. Why the hell do you want it with me? I've been so fucking blind and then I've been so damn weird lately because all I wanted to do was tell you that I... felt the same way--"
Dum-E, who was wary of Clint since what had been dubbed the Extinguishing Arrow Incident, pouted over in one corner. Eventually he would decide to join the fun, just probably not before Steve stormed in.
"We are Steven's closest friends," Lokes said with a shrug. "Of course we will stay at his side until the threat is over."
He also wasn’t thinking about how Captain America managed to look both adorable and sexy in his grandpa-style clothes... but that was mostly because he worried it would read on his face. Captain America wouldn't like having another man think of him like that, no sirree. So in case of sudden mind-reading spells, abilities, aliens or monsters or some shit, Tony only thought about that kind of thing when he was alone in the penthouse.
~.~.~
"STAR? My brain's never concocted her before. I think it might be time to worry. Soon as you vanish I'll have to call Pep. Or, well, Vision'll probably be here soon. He usually visits early in the day before he goes to help Rhodey with whatever the fuck is going on with what's left of the Avengers."
"Make me." That, of course, inspired another round of kisses just the way he had hoped it would. This time the mood changed from sweet into something much more passionate and heated. Things might have gone even farther - farther than he was ready for just yet but God if he wasn't enjoying the feel of the other man too damn much to want to stop it either - if U hadn't interfered. Just as Tony slid his hand into Steve's back pockets and squeezed, the 'bot gave a quiet beep to call their attention to him.
"Fuck no. I'm not a monster. Didn't let him keep the furry bastards either though. Tony set up a shelter for them."
"Has Brucie been forcing you to experiment with tea too? Because just as a warning he tried to kill me last Saturday."
"I been lookin' forward ta this," Steve drawled as he stepped around first Tony and Pepper and then the bar. As he moved past STAR dropped to his shoulder, orbs of arc reactor blue already flickering to life around her fists. "I saw what ya did ta him in Siberia, Rogers. Saw how ya left him there ta
"She tied Clinton down," Winter added helpfully from his spot on the couch where he was reading, STAR tucked against the side of his neck. "And she stole Strange's cloak to keep him from visiting his counterpart." The cloak itself turned to Winter and saluted, making the ex-assassin chuckle quietly. "Everyone else has been behaving, right
Steve acknowledged him with a gentle squeeze, but his expression was still stone and his eyes still shooting death-beams Maybe-Debbie’s way.
So I realized that in my last set of notes I didn't say that I wouldn't be able to post this last Sunday. :o I knew that with everything going on I wouldn't be able to get everything all set until today... which is why Wednesday is my other day that I'll post if I get a chapter done soon enough. XD
It was a nice, normal rhythm... but he knew it couldn't last forever. Tony was getting better, and soon some doctor named Helen Cho was going to use something called the Cradle. He wasn't real clear on the details, just knew it was supposed to help an awful lot. His fella wouldn't be bed-bound and could start going to the lab again. Once he'd given Rhodey a new pair of legs, he was sure that the genius' attention would turn back to the 'New Avengers' Rhodey was putting together. Soon Iron Man would rise again, and Steve would be right there with him.
"Maybe not, but ya did! Can't change that now, can ya? Get that through that thick skull-a yours and get the fuck over it. Ya made a mistake - we all make mistakes. It's time ta forgive yourself for this one and move on sweetheart. For Peter if ya can't do it for yourself."
Well, he could sip a few drinks. Steve was great about keeping a scotch in his hand, though the mother hen also forced him to drink water and eat any available finger foods. He didn’t have the heart to point out that he and his liver had been doing this dance since he was fifteen. When it came to drinking he could take care of his own damn self, but… managing that gave Steve something to focus on.
Steve didn't begrudge him that, but seeing the way they were on now... it was just a reminder of how things had been between them. Of the strained silences and the way he'd been denied entry so often, of all the times he'd come down to find the dimmers on and heard JARVIS' gentle 'Sir is busy' to turn him away.
"We live in Tony Stark's tower - whatta ya think?"
though. It had been great before because it had been him and Steve, but wow. Just... wow. The serum had made his
His Tiny Adorable Steve was still there, worried but beautiful blue eyes locked on his own. The sob that was stuck in his throat hurt but it was a pain he would happily bear. Steve was there, Steve was real, and he had promised not to leave him behind again. Maybe everything in his life had gone to shit in the past few months, but suddenly it didn’t seem all that bad. His life no longer felt irredeemably fucked. He had Steve and that… that was enough to make it all seem bearable again.
Maybe his surprise wasn’t… well. He didn’t want to know what Steve thought about it until it was finished. His secret needed to be protected!
"It's just... we barely got him ta accept I ain't a clone or somethin' like that. Still seems ta think I'm somehow trickin' Tony inta lovin' me--"
"Do you like her?"
"I... cannot believe this."
"Dude."
There are a few other members who are considered an auxiliary to the team instead of being fully active members. While they will train with the New Avengers and be called up on if their specific skill sets will be helpful, they are not expected to join every battle. So far the list of these individuals includes:
"Bucky?"
"Doesn't have one yet. I was--"
"I hate you."
Viz was still at the compound and there were a couple extra crazies that he couldn't claim as his, but that didn't matter too much. Almost all of his most important people were surrounding him, and it was just so... so nice. Safe. It was everything he'd never had with the team that he'd wanted to make a family, everything he'd been afraid to ask for. Now he didn't even have to ask and it was all there, without question or hesitation.
"Ya love me."
"Still refusing to use paper towels,
"I sure as fuck am not waiting ten more years before I put a ring on it. I'm thinking six."
Thanks again for reading. <3
Tony absolutely didn't break down into proud-parent tears, and anyone who said so later was a dirty rotten liar.
When the wait had finally been over, Harley and Winter had been the ones to pick the pair up and carry them to the infirmary. He had been busy trying to hold the rest of them together, because even Rogers had looked wrecked as he watched Tony from afar. Only Wanda appeared mostly unaffected, though she did seem genuine in her attempts to console Vision.
Thanks so much for reading!!
Miracle of miracles, that was just what happened. Oh sure it was Sam and Nat urging Rogers towards the elevator, and she definitely had to give him a firm elbow to the small of his back to get him inside of it, but still. It happened. All he had to put up with was one last painfully sincere look before the doors closed... and then all the air rushed back into the room.
"Yes!" Jan's little fist pump was adorable, and he couldn't help but 'awww' when each of his human boys got both a fist bump and a ruffle to their hair. She was definitely the favorite aunt - Pep was going to be so peeved.
"Don't answer him, sis," Harley told her, which was playing dirty. Fri almost always did what she was asked when he called her that. Thankfully she had yet to go against any of her core protocols, but he suspected it was only a matter of time. "We're gonna be late if we don't get a move on."
"I think you're just mad that you suck."
. I can't help Pep with the company if my brain is playing that kind of trick on me."
"Steve decided he didn't like what he was wearing," Tony informed me, a broad grin on his face. "He's going to be so mad at himself for not being here when you came in. He'll be pissed at me if I don't offer you something to drink." It was the first time I heard Maverick's name, and he'd dropped it in as casually as he might mention the weather.
? He's declared war on our wasteful ways," Tony added to me with a wink.
"Sure do, pops."
Ms. Potts. I'm not here to--
"Of course, FRIDAY. Steve, would you like to defect as well?"
"Are you fucking
"Hey, Pep, do you maybe not wanna reveal
for them. He couldn't wait for his dad - it had still been dad then - to find Captain America and bring him home. Tony couldn't wait to meet his hero.
In any case they would be back in the thick of it, but he didn't know the lay of this land. He'd never gotten to learn everything about this time in this world, and he was sure there was even more to learn now that he'd been gone almost two years. Steve especially wanted a better look at the Avengers and just what exactly had gone wrong. He fully planned to be part of the team as long as Tony was, so the internal politics of it all were important. If he knew how they had failed he could help his fella and Rhodey make it better.
Doctor Strange was standing alone, cloak flared behind him despite the lack of wind. The rigidness was born from the cloak's displeasure, he knew. Neither the Sorcerer Supreme nor his sentient clothing had been amused to learn about Wanda and her various antics. Strange planned to whisk her off right away, to a room where he could test her control and power safely.
Suddenly a corner of the workshop Steve hadn't seen in a while lit up and his jaw promptly dropped. There in front of him was a beautiful motorcycle that Tony had clearly poured his heart and soul into. It was sleek, painted a navy blue that almost seemed to ripple in the light shining down on it. When he got closer, he could see that there was a subtle, desaturated portion of the stars and stripes painted on both sides that you could only see in the right light. Not only was it a gorgeous machine, that beautifully understated paint job felt far more fitting than the more cartoonish color pallet SHIELD was always trying to force him into.
. It's a valid management style, Steve, and you should be more respectful of it."
"Big mood, daaaa... Mister Stark. Tony." Peter bounded over with absolutely zero grace, practically falling against Harley when the other teen didn't move out of the doorway. "I definitely feel you on that one. But hey! My 'stuff' isn't bad. You both just have awful music taste. I'm only trying to help."
"So I need to talk to your mom first of all. If she says no, that's it. She has absolute veto power here, okay? So if she nixes the idea then we're done. That's the first thing."
"Is something wrong?"
"I probably won't be coming back for a while," Peggy informed him with a sad twist to her lips. "Natalia and I are running point on helping Winter and she'll probably want to be the one to visit next. One of us has to be there, so--"
He figured that maybe in five years he'd be on solid ground to start the ten year plan that would include marriage. The ten year plan was the one that involved sweet-talking Thor into stealing a few apples.
bottle of scotch - that had a place of pride in their living room - but it was the same brand. He knew that Tony was about to pour himself a glass that he wouldn't drink, that he'd just stare into for hours if he was allowed to do it.
"Yeah? I don't mean... I'm not tryin' ta hurt ya, Tony, but... look. He's a good kid, and now he's hurtin'. The man I love wouldn't just walk away from that, not when he could help make it better. Would he?"
"No! No. That's not... fucking hell. Look. That was just a fucked up situation and... Howard. He used to... say things. So I thought... I thought someone like you couldn't ever... feel... anything for me. Shit, I never thought you even would want to be my friend." It hurt to hear, and by God did some part of him want Tony to build a time machine just so he could go back and kick Howard Stark's ass. He hugged the man a little tighter, one hand rubbing up and down the length of his spine. "I was so fucking glad that you wanted to be my anything that I... Rhodey said I was being an idiot."
From the apoplectic look on Rogers' face, he hated it.
"... I'll try. Harley?"
. STAR was holding onto his ear so hard it hurt, and soon that tiny pinprick of pain was the only thing he could feel apart from his pounding heart.
"That's just like my Tiny Adorable Steve. Tells us we need to talk to each other, then tries to interupt."
When Pep stopped putting it off and raised her eyes to her new suit, Tony was gratified by the look of awe that entered her eyes as her mouth dropped open. He'd worked hard on the design, scrapping more concepts than he'd kept in the end. For her, he had kept things simple and understated - it was what she liked best. The flashiest part was his choice for the main color. He'd eventually decided on a deep, rich purple with silver accents. After some debate, he'd indulged himself just a little by letting the light in her chest piece shine arc reactor blue instead of tinting it another color. In a show of both truth and a reference he knew she'd understand, he had also shaped that opening to look like a heart.
The room was quiet and warm, everything it should be between two hearts. Steve sighed pleasantly into the pillows as his alphas skilled hands kneaded at his back and shoulders. Coming down from a heat was easier this time around, he felt good and secure, nothing like he'd always feared growing up. Tony had been so good, so attentive, it was nice to have someone take care of you for a change. It had taken Steve a while to learn he could lower his walls and let himself be vulnerable. There was a special kind of bliss in letting the tension leak from his limbs and just be. No shield no strength just feeling. Tony always took such good care of him, he was never condescending or crass, if anything – his alpha was almost worshipful with the constant stream of praise pouring from the mans lips.
Oh yeah Tony had watched alright. Loki in the training room was something like music and magic. He learned from the best and he took it all and made it his own. Tony watched and felt his shirt collar dampen and his  tie suddenly feel like it was damn near strangling him. "Get out Loki."
So the strange little pack was gathering around the dinner table together for the first time in months. Steve had pulled Tony aside privately and explained he felt he would just announce it. Stark just smirked and made a comment that Steve should just say  ‘pass the gravy oh by the way I have a birth canal if anyone was wondering. These are good biscuits.’  Steve was not impressed.
Melinda shrugged and departed from him so the man could tend to his paper work. He knew she was merely trying to look out for him and honestly he did appreciate it. It had taken both himself and Clint a while to look at the former alien wannabe over lord and get over any lingering fear of anger regarding Loki.
She laughed pulling herself up onto her palms, the peppering of scaled over her belly and forearms shone in the moonlight. Her bare chest only covered with long tendrils of wet golden hair.
Rhodes followed his longtime friend laying a gentle hand on Tony’s shoulder, only to have the content jerked away. “Tony just…”
The omega was standing awkwardly in the bedroom with his back pressed to the wall. Steve’s blue eyes seemed too wide, his lips parted as quick little puffs of air escaped. Each hurried breath accompanied by the rapid rise and fall of the soldier’s chest.
AN: I am not perfect and I publish this work because the writing is therapeutic for me, not because I see myself as a professional author. I have no delusions about my obvious lack of talent, that said, I still hope those of you who read this work enjoy it, for those of you that do not -please be kind. I do not want to give up writing. However, negativity is pushing me to believe I should. I struggle daily and this is how I find a little bit of happiness. I do not want to lose that.
Being behind a stove again had it's undeniable charms, Loki had always liked cooking as it reminded him much of alchemy and potion making. Two things he'd explored heavily in his youth, most would never know it but the god of chaos had quite the brilliant green thumb. Despite the aforementioned thumb being occasionally blue. Keeping a garden of herbs and vegetables had been therapeutic in the early days of their relocation. Somewhere along the way Loki had found himself too busy and then...then he just felt like he was worthy of simple pleasures.
“I can handle myself you know,” he felt compelled to point out. Didn’t matter that he could feel his heart swelling, or that he was already tucking himself even tighter under Steve’s protective arm. “I’m a big boy.”
"They're awful. Did I teach you nothing?"
"You didn't ruin anything." A firm but tender kiss sealed the insistent words, but he still wasn't sure he believed them. "And no you don't to hear it. It was awful and I would have been so nervous that I would have sidetracked myself with tangents on tangents I'd already taken. This is... fuck, Steve." When Tony pressed his face against Steve's neck it was instinct to cradle him closer, sliding the hand in Tony's hair down to the nape of his neck while his other arm wrapped tightly around the genius' waist. "I'm sorry for making you wait so damn long. I didn't... I didn't think you could ever feel... not for me. You're so--"
A more controversial element is the inclusion of 'Junior Members'. Several teens have joined the superhero team, though Lt. Col. Rhodes has assured us that they will not be part of any major fight. These Junior Members will train with the New Avengers and may be called on to assist with minor altercations or be allowed to observe situations where no true threat is expected. To protect these assumed minors, their true names will not be made public, and they will only be known as their aliases. Those Junior Members are:
. Spear chick's path to Maverick faltered as she tried to bat them away, and Tony saw his
"Peter has super powers."
"Team solidarity."
"Me and
That would be enough to send the three of them back to work. Then it was Dum-E's turn, and he was the only one allowed to get away with shirking his real responsibilities. He was the one who would track down every pencil and bring them, one by one, back to Steve. The happy beeps he made whenever he was thanked were pretty damned adorable, and he seemed to thoroughly enjoy doing such an important job. Tony would flash the 'bot an affectionate, indulgent look whenever he thought nobody else could see him; all the 'bots received gentle pats no matter how badly Tony was scolding them at any given moment.
"I think he'd like that," Tony whispered, grief etched onto his face. The moments when it was visible were fewer and farther between, but the loss of his oldest son was still something he felt keenly. Some days were worse than others, and Steve worried that maybe this conversation would turn this into a bad day. "Nobody else--" he stopped himself to clear his throat, then swiped carelessly at his eyes. "Only me, Steve and the other kids have left something. Pep and Rhodey talked about maybe... but they're busy. And they never--"
"It means that because your dumb butt was too busy wallowing and getting a new boyfriend to call, I had to take drastic action."
Opening his eyes was probably the scariest thing he’d done in a long, long time. If Steve… if Steve wasn’t really there he was going to fall apart. Getting drunk would only be the beginning and it would probably be the start of the downward spiral that finally did him in. But it felt so damn real, and their interaction had lasted so much longer than usual. Tony felt awake and Steve was still there, so maybe… maybe it was really him. Maybe it was safe.
It was sort of a weird relationship to watch, but only because they had known Carol as Captain Marvel first. Their lives were rife with little things like that though, so they mostly shrugged and went with the flow. The relationship the Loki from his universe had struck up with both Winter and Peggy was
"Tryin'." The word was a grunt - when he looked, Maverick was holding on to the wicked looking weapon and slamming his shield into glaive guy's face. "That lady keeps-- shit."
"Uh... yeah. Definitely. Absolutely. You make the best plans, you strategist you. We will always go with your plans unless I come up with better ones. In this scenario though your idea blows mine out of the water. So... Fri?"
