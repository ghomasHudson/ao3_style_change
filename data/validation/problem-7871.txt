Tony cocked a brow at him, as if trying to read his thoughts, but then he just leaned in and pressed a kiss against Steve’s cheek.
Well, this was going to be fun, Tony decided. All in all, he and Steve hadn’t had a real argument with each other since their wedding and this was probably long overdue.
When freed, Bucky only stared at him.
Steve had been annoyed at first. By the end of it, he’d gotten cramps in his stomach from laughing too hard.
Bucky blinked. “So the government isn’t coming after me?”
Thanks to the serum, Steve had excellent night vision, and despite the dimness, he could see—not perfectly, but probably better than Tony. He turned to look at him from where he was perched against the wall, still catching his breath. The collapse had been unexpected, and he was worried about Tony.
Steve watched as Bucky opened his mouth to say something, but he was interrupted by a sudden sound in the back of the hall.
It was that glance from Tony that had Steve cringe and lower his gaze, embarrassment making his flush flare up a notch. He wished he could dismiss it and pretend everything was fine, but not only was he not accustomed to lying, he knew Tony would see right through it anyway.
"Three hours, enough air, candle light and radio silence? How's that for a date?" He murmured, lips brushing over Tony's smooth skin.
That, of course, was when a detonation hit the glass front of the room. Steve had a split-second to realize what was happening, and on the next beat, Natasha had already thrown him down on the floor, his own hold on Tony taking him down as well.
Could she sound any more pleased? Nah, not possible, but it was good news. At least, Tony hoped it was.
“Why didn’t you go with him?” he asked suddenly. “There’s nothing holding you here.”
Tony smiled. “Yes. Arc reactor. It’s not easy to find people who are willing to participate in a project that is highly experimental at best. Bruce Banner showed an interest when I talked to him, that’s why I’ll have to take that next step now. Obi isn’t thrilled about the whole thing—and that’s definitely a euphemism—but he said if I wanted to find investors, I had to do the presentations myself, and he’s right about it. No one else can do it. It’ll take a while, talking to everyone. Two weeks, maybe more.”
“You look like you’re gonna faint,” someone said, and Steve startled. He turned around and saw Tony leaning against the doorframe.
“My mind must be a mess for thinking up someone like you,” Steve said, staring down at Tony. He was so close now, he could freely touch his perfect, fine-looking dress shirt. Somehow, he had the urge to rough him up a little. “But I can’t say my life has been easy lately, so this is a… welcoming distraction.”
No, it wasn’t the destruction of the city that disturbed him. He had seen too many horrible things to be shaken by broken buildings. No, it was the hoarse, strangled cries erupting from the streets. There were screams of anguish everywhere, almost animalistic sounds of pain and desperation. He supposed everyone had lost someone today, and New York… New York was in deep mourning.
Steve nodded harshly, his racing mind determined to keep up with every sensation. He was nervous and split apart with pleasure, focused on the wet slide of his erection inside Tony and, at the same time, the look on his face.
trust him.”
Steve supposed his new strength wasn’t easily explained. Colonel Phillips had the notion in his head that a single man couldn’t possibly cause any change—and moreover, that Steve was a failed experiment and nothing more.
He pulled back just as quickly, though, and shoved Tony’s glasses back on his nose. “Now, you watch.”
Tony’s hand was
Tony groaned as he leaned against Rhodey, letting him take some of his weight as they made their way across the smaller alleys. He should’ve stopped drinking at some point, he mused. The taste in his mouth was a mixture of tequila, cheap beer and something… else…
Bucky and Natasha had taken up the other side of the couch, and while they weren’t fully cuddling or anything, they were definitely sitting very closely. Bucky’s voice was airy but he was looking straight at him now, and there was something in his eyes. It wasn’t sad or reproachful—it wasn’t even too serious—and it made Steve ache. It made him feel—Home.
Steve cleared his throat. “Now, press your foot on the brake before you shift into Drive.”
“It’s a life-changer.”

The scent of hot chocolate warmed the air. “You know… you gotta sleep sometime,” Clint said when he sat down across from him, placing a mug in front of Steve’s hands. “Cause if you don’t sleep, Tony won’t either. I’m pretty sure the guy will play a pivotal role when we locate Ultron, and I swear to God I will kill you both if I die because the two of you didn’t get your shit together. You haven’t slept in, what, two days?”
—least of all him. “Mister Stark…” he started.

Steve scowled at him without heat. “How about you let me do this on my own pace, yeah? Three days ago, I was pretty sure I was exclusively into girls, and now I’m debating whether or not to blow you before doing the whole…prep thing… so kindly stop the teasing? I’m strategizing.”
, so shocked and lost. Hard to believe it was already two days ago since he’d last seen him in the living room. Ever since he’d had that… flashback, hallucination, or vision, or whatever, he’d holed himself up in the gym or his own floor, not even coming down for dinner anymore.
Tony laughed, still a little disbelieving. “Guess I was stupid. Stupid and insecure. I just thought I might be too old for you now, or that you were still mad. I was… I was a coward. I wanted to come here so often, I was going mad. When they found you, I was… shell-shocked. I mean, I had always hoped, but… Sixteen years is a long time.” Tony’s eyes searched him. “You… You really want this? I wasn’t kidding, Steve, I’m… kind of a mess. I’m not an easy man to deal with.”
"I just told you, I do trust you," Steve said quietly, then watched Tony retrieve the bottles. He sprang into action, helping Tony get soaped up as well. Just because Tony wanted to take his time in bed didn't mean they had to take their time in the shower as well. They'd already spent so much time skirting around the issue, anyway.
"Did you know," he said then, casually. "That Pratt’s hiring?" The grin he had plastered on his face was telling. Even though he was only at the interview stage, he'd had a good feeling about it when he met the director and some of the staff. Odds were in his favor, he felt.
“But I don’t wanna dream of someone else,” Tony replied with an easy shrug. “I like to have you here, with me.”
“I love your grey hairs and I love your wrinkles,” Steve teased and leaned in to kiss Tony’s forehead and then the laughter lines next to his eyes. “You age well and you know it.”
That made Steve laugh. “You? Never. Let’s go home, we’ll tuck him in together. He could use a bath today anyway.”
“Yeah? Really?” Tony asked, huffing. “It’s all so fucking easy for you, is it? You don’t give a shit that it would break Steve’s heart if they put you in prison after everything—”
Steve raised a brow at him. Did he truly not see it? “This is our room.”
,” Tony whined. “We’ve been talking about this moment for over ten goddamn years! I mean, if it were just Carol, I might… I don’t know, I’d still not like it, but I’d understand. But Steve and the whole gang?
Tony smiled, and even with the black eyes, he somehow managed to look immensely smug. “Remember the ‘ally’ Nick talked about? The guy protecting the nuclear codes? The one who revoked Bucky’s house arrest?” He grinned proudly. “I found him.”
“Are you
His words, however, clearly surprised Tony. He blinked, then stared at Steve as if he only now saw him. His eyes burned while sizing him up—and good Lord, if this was a dream it sure all felt very real.
Tony grinned widely. “Yeah, I’m kind of aware.”
The tension in Steve’s groin tightened without warning, as Tony turned his hands to his own trousers the next moment.
“I could really use some advice, Pegs.”
Tony thought on that for a moment. “No, I guess not.”
Steve nodded. “Yeah.”
There was silence settling in the room, and Steve put his forehead on the table in front of him, sighing deeply. “I should follow, right?” he asked quietly.
Tony couldn’t settle down, couldn’t stop the buzzing that was racing through his bloodstream. A good hour had passed since Ross had announced his arrival and he still hadn’t shown his stupid face. And Tony still stood in the bathroom nearby. He’d spent endless minutes trying to figure out a way how to help Steve without helping him, how to keep him safe without turning everyone else against him, but so far, he’d come up empty.
“How can you be so sure about that?” He
Tony gripped his forearms and felt them flex as Steve’s hands did their magic. “
“You’re around,” Steve told him after another long beat. “Just not with us. You took a timeout from superheroing.”
Chat server started on port 9007
Vision’s expression slightly fell, looking lost. “I wouldn’t know what to say to her, besides that I’m… that I’m sorry.”
His fussiness would’ve been manageable if Tony didn’t have a shitload of work every day. Most hours were spent with Pepper and Maria in his SI office, and whatever break he took he used to debate the Accords with people from the UN. More often than not, Ross asked him to meet with some random lawyer-douchebag for so-called ‘draft discussions’ at the UN headquarter, going over each and every paragraph to see what kind of changes still had to be made before the Accords could become law.
“What if something happens to you?” Tony asked, irritated. “What if you die? Our Steve won’t ever be able to get back here.”
—we learned to actually make an effort to talk things through.”
Tony nodded faintly. “Mmm… yeah, I remember booze.”
“You’ll be registered under our jurisdiction, that’s all.”
Tony’s nestled his head in the hollow between Steve’s neck and shoulder as they each tightened their hold on the other. “I probably would’ve yelled at you a lot. And then… I like to tell myself I would’ve done this…” He raised himself up and caught Steve’s mouth with his, sucking on his bottom lip, opening up for his tongue, losing himself in this kiss until he no longer knew where he ended and Steve began. “And that,” he said between gasps as they broke apart, nibbling at Steve’s neck.
,” Steve scolded, gripping his hips a little tighter to make him stop.
Bruce cleared his throat. “Some of you aren’t going to like it,” he warned. “Okay, all of you aren’t going to like it.”
Fury held out his hand to take the letter. His eyes scanned the lines in silence first, then he sighed and read out loud:
Steve was about to say something when Bucky continued talking. "You… got a bathroom somewhere around here?" he asked, tone brisk and just a little too tight.
When he looked up, things got… a little strange. After he’d run into Strucker, Steve had stood right behind the building’s entrance, and now, he was lying at the bottom of a stairwell. Focusing on the matter at hand, Steve shook off his confusion and instead ran back up the stairs. Once he stepped through the door, he spotted the girl again and, raising his shield to her head, he ordered, “Stand down
“Or hot cocoa,” Tony amended with a crooked grin. “I would accept that, but only if you’ve got marshmallows.”

Tony sighed. “Are you afraid of me?”
“Is what?”
“Yes.”
that he'd remember before it was too late. I know what it must've looked like, and I'm sorry that you had to go through that, I really am, but the serum can take a lot. A lot more than some flesh wounds, and I needed to take that chance.”
Tony stepped even closer to Steve. And from the heavy lidded look in his eyes, Steve received the distinct warning that he knew exactly what sort of drunk Tony was.
“I’ll miss you.”
“I could never hate you,” Tony said and it sounded so broken that Steve wanted to curl around him and never let go again. “And I won’t hate you when we’re done.” He made another feeble try to reach for Steve, but he batted his hand away.
“Hey, Stevie,” he said with a smile. “Is Nat ready?”
He put a hand on Tony’s shoulder. “It’s you. It’ll work.”
This was… this was everything he’d ever hoped to get from a kiss. Butterflies in his stomach, a need for more that made itself home in every part of his body. The sheer
Tony leaned further into Steve’s side and clapped a hand on his shoulder. “Come on, we could really use someone who isn’t on SHIELD’s top priority list right now. Someone Pierce doesn’t expect. Besides, you always say we need more flight power anyways.”
, anyway.
“No, it doesn’t.” He reached for Tony’s hand and squeezed it. Another puzzle piece fell into place. Tony might not believe in fate, but it was harder to dismiss it by the second.
Tony glanced back at him. “Usually I’d say you need to buy me dinner first, but technically speaking, you’ve constantly fed me for the past weeks, so…”
Tony snorted, smiling down at Bruce and patting his shoulder. “It’s okay. I know you love me.”
There was no way any other person would ever get what he had now.
“We tried to keep it low-key. They’d been kind of a prototype that—strictly speaking—hadn’t made it into production.”
“No, still at home,” Natasha replied. “Thor’s still in Asgard, no word from him. I alerted Bruce, Sam, Vision, Wanda and Pietro.”
As he talked, Wanda’s hands were moving again, blasting red wafts of magic at Tony and he closed his eyes, letting the current course through him. It didn’t hurt exactly, but for some reason, Tony felt exposed, like the magic was slowly peeling layers off of him.
Steve all but shook with laughter by now and the disgruntled look on Tony’s face didn’t make it any better. He pulled him near, grinning widely. “If you walk a
He caressed Tony’s cheek as gently as he could. “What’s going on?” he asked. Clearly, Tony was still linked to Extremis, and that meant Ultron could get to him whenever he wanted, right?
“He still talks about you every day,” Tony said at one point, his voice quiet, one hand settling on Ian’s head. “In case you wondered.”
, mostly you, I thought I was done with it all. Committing to something, especially people. And I was fine with that, and it
“The team. I want the team to have a chance.” Swallowing, Steve forced himself to go on—to finally say the words that had resonated in his mind for so long. “The Avengers are important. Back with the Accords, I shouldn’t have given up on us so easily. You tried hard to find a way and I just… I dug my heels in. I still think I was right—about not signing the Accords right away. Hell, they barely gave us the time to read the damn thing, but… I see now that I sacrificed everything else on the way. And I understand that I’ve lost my right to make any demands. I’m willing to play by your rules now.”
How many times had Tony dreamed of this sight? He wiped Steve’s cheek with his good hand, and it came away wet. Steve was crying for him. And dammit, the sight was too much to bear.
“Please, Captain,” Zemo said with a thick accent. “The Soviets built this chamber to withstand the launch blast of a hundred rockets.”
“Sorry, that was out of the blue,” Tony said, sighing.

But no. He wasn’t. He remembered what it had felt like to be drowning in ice. It hadn’t felt like this.
He nodded at the deep broken lash in Ultron’s body, at the cables falling out. “You’re stuck in this outdated metal casing. The big Ultron isn’t quite as memorable as he’d like to be… You’re just an enormous egomaniac with an inferiority complex that’s almost as funny as your sense of entitlement to everything this world has to offer.”
“Fuck,” Tony grunted as their cocks made first contact. “You have no idea how much I missed you.”
Steve nuzzled his hair. “Thought kissing was all right now.”
Tony huffed, groaning as he cast a hand across his forehead. “Yeah, thanks. That’s not making it awkward at all.”
Still nothing.
With Sam and Bucky at his side, they headed up a last set of stairs, and when Steve rounded up the corner that led to the elevators, the two stayed on his heels, their presences steadying. They kept following him through the hallway, to the elevator on the left, and slipped inside.
He put a smile on his face, pointing his fork towards the plate. "This is really good, I... didn't get to eat home cooked food in a while. It tastes great."
Tony stroked his cheek. “You won’t.” He kissed him again. Ground into him and bit his lip to show he meant business. He felt Steve harden, and smiled.
There was no arguing with that. “Getting better all the time.”
He closed the door as quietly as he could when he left.
When Tony came out of the shower, Steve couldn't help but enjoy the sight of him, dressed casually, scrubbed clean, refreshed after a good night's sleep. They stood there smiling at one another for a long moment, before Steve turned and they went to the common room together.
“You… have,” Tony managed to say, frowning when it came out as more of a question.
“Yeah, no,” Rhodes replied and put a hand on Steve’s chest to stop him. The expression on his face allowed no discussion. “I’ll go bring him back and
“I never told you my name.”
“No. I was just thinking.”
“Yeah, you won’t. I know. I’m just saying: Don’t expect too much too soon, alright?”
Something inside Steve’s desperate gaze shifted then. The despair slowly leaked out of his eyes, and was replaced with something that warmed Tony from the inside.
Tony opened his mouth, but Steve yelled over him, “What in
“Wake up, today’s the big day.”
“It’s what we do,” Clint answered. “Laura made her peace with that long ago. And Tony will understand what you did once he finds out about Siberia. This is why we became a team in the first place, it’s our job to do what others can't. No matter the cost.”
So, he’d agreed to leave it be. Let SHIELD handle whatever it was they were hiding. It wasn’t what he wanted, but he understood the wisdom behind caution. The last thing he wanted was to jeopardize their alliance with SHIELD because he didn’t trust Fury. So he agreed to let Fury research and come to the necessary conclusions himself. And he agreed to wait because it made everyone breathe easier to think he wouldn’t fly off the handle.
“What do you mean, ‘we’? That’s all on Wilson and Barnes. The two together are a certified disaster whenever they’re up here.”
Before turning the key in the ignition, Steve turned to look at Tony. “Not a word on my driving.”
He tried to see through the eyes of his other self, that version he’d left behind in the other year 2018, wondering what the other Tony would think of him. Probably something like, “Why the hell are you even still thinking about me?” to start with.
—well, he wasn’t making it any easier. For the last couple of weeks, he had always been so close to Tony and it was really setting him off his game.
already different.
Tony nodded, then pressed a firm kiss against Steve’s temple. “Come on, let’s get inside. Sam is making breakfast and I need you to eat something before Thor inhales all the food. We’ll figure this out together, I promise.”
There was no Tony. Only coldness.
“Well.” Tony’s voice came out heavier than he’d have liked, so he swallowed. “Imagine that.”
The sight was… unlike anything Steve had ever encountered, and he felt himself stiffen once more. Once Tony cried out and added to the already cooling come on Steve’s chest, a surprised groan tore through Steve’s throat. He fisted both hands into the bedsheets, bucking up. There was the sound of cloth tearing, and he gasped and twitched and couldn’t believe himself as he came a second time.
“Tony Stark?”
“I know… I heard you.”
"So you're DUM-E, huh?" Steve asked the device, feeling a little silly to be talking to a… well, 'inanimate thing' didn't feel like the right term to use for it. "That's not a very nice name, huh?" he asked, side-eyeing Tony for a moment before turning back to the mechanical arm. It could hear him, so he figured it was only polite to introduce himself. "I'm Steve Rogers," he said, offering his hand to shake the thing's claw.
Most just wanted to talk to Tony about his project, pointedly ignoring Steve. Some, however, only wanted to talk about Stark Industries’ weapon’s production—and Steve noticed that each time this happened, Tony’s hands tightened to fists at his side.
Now, though, their kiss was melted savagery with yearning, pure desire and anger, and tenderness mixed with cruelty. And in this moment, Tony loved him—loved him and hated him in equal measures.
“It’s not,” Steve snapped.
Tony’s eyes were large, imploring Steve’s but similarly unable to hold his gaze for longer than a few seconds at a time. “No, darling, you don’t.”
One of Wanda’s blasts broke through Vision’s defenses, sending him flying towards where Bucky and Natasha were currently fighting on the training mat. Bucky had Natasha in a stranglehold, but she managed to kick him in time to free herself and cast him a nasty grin before throwing herself at him. In that moment, however, Vision plummeted to the ground. The two cried out, breaking off and scrambling to get out of the way. “Watch it!” Natasha shouted. “This isn’t battleground!”
Steve had seen most of the video material before—most of it was propaganda. And yet, he couldn’t believe what he was seeing and remained cemented firmly in his position as the images unfolded beat by beat on screen.
“I’ll go and look for Tony,” Steve told Rhodey, not waiting for a reply.
Together, all three of them walked down into the cellar. The room where the Eye of Agamotto had once been was now empty, aside from a single chair standing in the middle of it.
“Didn’t he say we should talk to Coulson?” Sam asked. “One of his agents was one of the new enhanced, right?”
“Not in the long run, I don’t think so. He sees what needs to be done now, everything else is secondary.” He sighed, glancing up at Bruce. “If SHIELD drops, we can’t be acting as disaster response any longer. We need to step up, take charge of things, bring together what’s left of SHIELD… and take responsibility for what happens today. Government will ask for a handler, someone they can shove the blame at so they don’t lose face.”
Motion ceased entirely at some point, and Steve's breathing evened out soon after. He lay limp and sated under Tony, staring into mid-distance. This had been an experience so much more intense than he'd expected it would be. "... wow."
“You’re Cap’n America,” Tony said, as if that meant anything. “You don’t leave.”
He’d almost lost him today. After he’d just found him. And he could only imagine what he’d gone through.
[New Client2] [chat_server:46956]
“Hey,” Clint called, momentarily leaning closer to Steve’s ear. “Fuck you very much, Tony.”
With that, he yanked her pants and underwear over her hips. She gasped and leaned her forehead against the wall, biting her lip. He spun her around again, pressing her back against the wall and himself against her. She glared at him and one corner of his mouth lifted into a proud smile, his free hand dancing across her middle. “You’re the most gorgeous woman I’ve ever met,” he said softly as his fingers slipped between her legs.
Tony knew love didn’t always triumph. He wasn’t stupid. Love, when tested, most times failed to beat the odds. But it didn’t make what they’d had any less true.
“How it must
“Yeah, didn’t know the CIA was rolling in this kind of money,” Tony eventually answered. He grabbed a glass of champagne and a soda from a circulating waitress and handed the champagne to Steve. “Did I tell you how ravishing you look tonight?” he asked before Steve could do something like tell him how he would’ve been okay with a soda as well. He really wasn’t in the mood to be reminded of his alcohol abstinence. He just wanted this evening to be as normal and uneventful as possible.
He also didn’t even realize that he had moved closer to Steve until his answering, “You… are?”
Tony took a low breath. There was a reason he’d never wanted kids.
“Yes, that’s papa’s nose,” Steve confirmed with a proud smile. “Don’t kids usually walk before they talk?”
responded once. Wanting to try the manual approach, Tony opened the chat panel, when Steve suddenly dropped into the chair next to him. He reached for Tony’s phone, pointedly putting it down on the table before slumping forward, his head now pillowed on Tony’s left shoulder.
“What?” Natasha frowned, first staring at Vision, then at Steve. Tony could see the panic and fear inside her eyes, and that wasn’t exactly calming his mind. “Dammit,
His ears strained through the silence, barely catching the faint sounds of their movements. And for the first time in days, something akin to curiosity welled up in his mind. There was an itch to see, but before he could reach a decision, Stark was talking again.
Steve’s face sort of… fell, and Tony hurried to add, even while tears welled up in his eyes, “No pain. None at all. It’s just a… vacuum. I’m sure it’ll pass.”
Opening the door, Steve’s eyes moved towards the forbidden stretch of hallway, which led to the west wing. The only place in Stark Mansion he had yet to explore.
Tony was an enigma. Steve had seen flashes of selflessness, compassion and devotion in him before, and knew that deep down, Tony was a man who needed to be loved and accepted. He constantly second-guessed himself, his actions, as if he were always preparing himself for rejection.
“Very,” Tony answered.
Steve shook his head. “Already called him. I’m right where I want to be.” He did kiss him then, tender and tentative.
By the time they got into the safe house’s basement, Tony was struggling not to pass out, despite the pain. The bleeding had mostly stopped oozing out, but he knew there was some serious mess inside, and someone was going to have to get the damned blade out before it wreaked too much havoc for Extremis to fix. He wasn’t one hundred percent sure what would happen if they didn’t get it out in time, and he didn’t exactly want to find out. Extremis was running on high alert, but as long as the blade was still stuck in his body, it remained inactive—only supplying information on how critical his condition actually was.
. You’re too fucking much. It’s like… all my fantasies coming true, only that you aren’t wearing half your football dress.” With that, he finished kicking off his sweatpants in a hurry and then spread his knees wider. “Come on.”
It didn’t take long—Tony was already so close when they started.
,” Tony shot back, then stopped.
“What about the Gauntlet?” Natasha asked as she stepped up next to them. She nodded down at Thanos’ body. The Gauntlet was still on his left hand, glowing slightly. “If we destroy it—”
Steve ignored their argument and only stared down at Tony, and his gaze was suddenly all urgency. “This is all just speculation, right?”
then you know that she likes to overdramatize from time to time.”
“We won’t
“You didn’t hurt me,” Steve said softly, as he stepped closer. All of this, each and every word Tony said, didn’t make the slightest lick of sense to him. He’d been there for Tony? What was that supposed to mean? But he knew he wouldn’t be getting any answers. It didn’t work like that with Tony, he never explained himself.
“We worked on getting JARVIS back online,” Tony explained beneath the towel. “I needed Extremis for that. It came back online just after we left the farm, and… Ultron’s all over the network. So when I noticed him fighting you, I tried to attack him, or distract him, at the very least, and it worked. Kicked his ass nine ways from Sunday. Did you notice?”
“Come on, everyone:
“We’re still wait-ing,” Clint sing-songed.
the point. It’s the
“Talk to me, Tony,” Steve prompted as he stepped up next to the couch, kneeling down. He had half a mind to simply rip the towel off of Tony’s face, but ultimately decided against it. “What happened here?”
sometimes.
Steve looked up at that, staring down in her unfocused blue eyes. He could pinpoint the exact moment when he lost her again. One moment she was here, and then she was gone.
“Happy’s not the right word,” Tony decided a minute later. “More like… ecstatic.”
,” Tony exhaled, truly baffled. “I would’ve
Bucky hummed and leaned forward. “Yeah… looked like it. You know, from where Stark’s tongue were busy licking your whole face.”
“I’ve never felt this way,” Steve admitted.
Tony’s eyes locked on him, then, and Steve knew what would happen even before it did. His browns had become blank orbs when they were usually bright and lively, and God help him, but the blankness swallowed Steve whole. Tony had such gorgeous eyes. Those eyes had distracted him on his mission, the first time he’d seen them up close—the night of the gala, all those years ago. His eyes had been distanced, their gaze polite at best, but even then, even when Steve had been sure to despise
When Steve stopped, even though he didn’t turn around, Tony let go again. Skin contact probably wouldn’t do any good right now. His expression seemed pained, from what Tony was seeing of his face, and he would be offering him a couple of Advils or something, but it wouldn’t do Steve and his super-metabolism any good, anyway.
Tony raised an eyebrow, fingers lacing through Steve’s. “I’m just gonna assume that by ‘live with us’ you mean join our merry team in the regular non-polyamory living conditions a few floors below ours. And in that case, uh—still no. I think he’s gonna be ready soon, but I don’t think he’s quite there yet.”
It wasn’t that he’d never thought about it. What he would do if he could turn back time. If there was a way to prevent what had happened during the Sokovia Accords fiasco. But deep in his heart, he knew that Steve would never listen to him.
“I came to say goodbye”, Steve blurted. “The air in Monte Carlo no longer agrees with Mister Hammer. We are going to leave this morning. I have to… say goodbye.”
Once in the woods, Steve followed the river down south for a few miles before turning back. But no matter where he went, there were only ever trees and soil and an endless yellow sky. As much as the solitude did him good, there was nothing to find outside their small meadow, so after an hour or two, he started jogging back to the clearing.
In the matter of a second, Tony stood in front of Bucky, the gauntlet smashing into his face once, twice, before its palm was directed straight at his head—the repulsor gleaming deadly. And Bucky—Bucky just looked up at Tony from where he was heavily leaning against the wall, and he didn’t even raise his arms in defense.
As Steve watched Tony walk down the steps to sign the Accords with Natasha and members of the UN, he was wrapped up in doubts he wasn’t quite prepared to share with anyone, though it was proving harder and harder.
Tony had sat up again, his head thrown back, lips open, his back in a beautiful, perfect arch. His hips were still moving, gliding so sensually over Steve’s middle as his right hand moved over their cocks.
Natasha had been quiet the whole way home. They were both wrapped up in their own thoughts, neither one of them willing to share at the moment. Steve had a feeling he knew what was going through her head—it wasn’t the first time she’d had to decide between her loyalty to the Avengers and SHIELD—but he hadn’t really wanted to revive the discussion anywhere but inside the safety of their home in New York.
“Fuck,” Tony said wondrously. His eyes widened as he looked down at Steve with pure wonder. “But football. You love football.”
It was a miracle that Tony could navigate himself anywhere under these circumstances; much less to the safe house’s observation room where they’d be supervising the fight from afar.
It barely took him half an hour to decide on that.
“You know he could be a real dick about this, right? Obi’s… not a bad guy. He’s just, I don’t know, conservative as fuck, a real hardliner. He doesn’t really know I’m into guys, so don’t take it personally when he’s throwing a fit. He’ll get over it.”
,” Steve warned with a firm voice. “I understand you are upset, but—”
dreams. The thought floated in his mind for a moment before he pulled himself out of bed and padded over to the bathroom. He didn't need much time to get ready, and the institute he was teaching at was only a short walking distance from his flat.
“Tony thought he might show up,” Rhodey replied.
Bucky concentrated on her hand and the strong beating heart pressed against his back and mimicked Steve’s breathing. Vaguely, he remembered how often they had done this in the army, calming each other after the worst kinds of nightmares, and upon remembering how easy it had been to let Steve do this for him, he felt himself ease into it.
surprise.
, he had understood that there was a deep well behind those eyes—a well of warmth, of generosity, of empathy, of true greatness.
Tony nodded, then leaned down and kissed Steve, his arms curled around his shoulders. As they kissed, Tony started to move above him, gently rolling his hips back and forth. He slipped a hand between their heaving bellies and combed through Steve’s pubic hair, lightly tugging on his cock.
“I’m being dramatic again,” Steve told her softly.
“If he’s getting Stark to drop the entire weapon department, then I’d say the boy is—”
you,” Tony replied. “You wouldn’t even have given the idea so much as a second of consideration!”
Steve released a deep breath, and forced a nod.
Casting that specific train of thoughts aside right then and there, Tony walked up to Steve and instantly grabbed for the straps of his upper uniform, unclasping them. “I have to admit I might have fantasized about peeling that thing off of you before,” he told Steve, his voice gentle.
They settled themselves in position, facing each other, hands held already. For a moment, Tony was unsure whether to settle his other hand on Steve’s shoulder or on his waist, but Steve made that decision for him by placing his own hand on Tony’s waist.
. He only got a glimpse of Steve’s chest before his own shirt was dragged off him. Without pause, though, his eyes snapped back to all of that bare… skin… as soon as he could.
“I’d be an old man before we even meet. This… there’s no hope, don’t you see?”
Only much later, when they were both lying on the workshop couch, grinning from ear to ear and pressed together from head to toe, Steve took a moment to reflect back on what had happened.
“IFID,” Tony said, and at Steve’s confused stare, he added, “Institute for Infectious Diseases.”

serious.” He pointed to some back-lights ahead of them. “That one. Here, let me take the wheel and better drop your pants, Stark.”
“We need to stop this guy from freeing the other Winter Soldiers,” he said eventually, coming up empty for now. “That’s our primary mission. Everything else has to be secondary.”
Tony was just entering the entrance hall, with Rhodey and Pepper following him. Their expressions were tense, and their voices easily carried over the music in the other room.
Following a sudden urge to get some space, he stood up and walked over to the balcony’s railing, pressing both hands down on it. He shook his head as if to clear it, then just looked into the distance.
It probably shouldn’t be a surprise how vocal Tony was when it came to this, but the constant stream of ‘Yeah, just like that’, and ‘Deeper, deeper please’, and more often than not ‘Steve, Steve, Steve’—Steve simply hadn’t been prepared for
Steve’s wobbling legs were fighting to maintain balance. “What are you talking about?” he asked. “You keep mentioning…
It certainly beat sitting around in that damned UN office and waiting for Ian to tire himself out.
didn’t spend millions of dollars to find you, unlike… other people.”
“I love you, too,” Tony said, and forced a very small smile on his bruised lips.
Bucky’s forehead wrinkled slightly as he struggled to find an answer. “I guess I came to… apologize for hitting you the other day.” There was a false note in his voice. Steve realized that while he might be sorry, that wasn’t the reason he was here.
“And you think if we work together,” Sam said, “if we
“I’ll go with you,” Steve said and in some way, it sounded more like a declaration than any of those sappy words waiting on Tony’s tongue.
Steve was standing in his cabin on the Helicarrier, unpacking a few things. Coulson had told him he didn’t know how long the mission would last and how much time they’d need to find that…
him. “I’ve wanted to do that all day.”
The air could not have been heavier. Silence stretched between them. Bucky made no move to even acknowledge that he had heard Bruce speak.
For a few seconds, all he could hear was the sound of his own ragged breathing. He looked up slowly, wincing when he saw Tony walking towards him with heavy eyes. Steve considered hiding his hand from him, but he knew it was useless. Tony was too clever not to notice and keeping it behind his back or tucked into his jacket would just be an insult to them both.
Steve curled his hands into fists, raising his shield.
,” Natasha corrected, casting Steve a sympathetic smile. “Sorry. News travel fast, it seems.”
Dummy trotted around them with a notable lack of confidence, turning every few yards to make sure he hadn’t done anything wrong. And despite the fact that the robot very clearly did not belong to Steve, he found himself easily won over by his cheerful bounce and low whirring. He was a happy unique thing; oblivious to the tension that dripped from every corner of the Stark property. And Steve envied his unawareness.
And then he felt the soft touch of Steve’s lips whispering against his throat, his nails ever-so-gently etching a path along Tony’s erection. Steve wasn’t coy. He didn’t tease. His fingers simply wrapped around Tony’s length with a firm grasp that set his body aflame.
Steve was asleep in his arms.
?” Tony hissed at him, his hands shaking at his sides. “You
TS 2:11 P.M.>Too crude?
“Among other things, yes,” Tony agreed. “The day he arrives—beautiful, sunny day in April—we aren’t exactly in good shape, and we lose control over the situation. Where—where I come from, we were still fighting but you don’t have to be a futurist to know where we were heading. So I travelled to Nepal. There’s this—there’s this cabal of sorcerers, because of-fucking-course there’s sorcerers these days, too. They have the Time Stone, it was the last gem the warlord was still missing, so that’s where I thought I was needed most. Turns out the Sorcerer Supreme got another idea.”
“We won’t last much longer,” Tony yelled at Steve, who stood next to him, staring into the sky. The good few dozen spaceships above the city where a sight to behold, but the more worrying matter was the storm of raw energy crackling through the air.
Outside, he stood rooted to the floor, unable to move. For a few minutes, all he could hear was the sound of his own ragged breathing. His eyes were tightly screwed shut, his lips parted, his muscles clenched. He couldn’t move; he couldn’t even
Wanda’s lip curled up in a disgusted sneer. With her magic, she suddenly hauled Tony off his feet, pinning him against the ceiling, which—
Tony curled in Steve's arms, drifting off and sleepily murmuring that he loved him, and fell asleep to the gentle strokes of his hands. That thought resided just beyond morning.
Tony hummed. Then, he released a soft breath. “I’m so sorry. That you have to go through all this.”
He nodded, more to himself, as he made to sit up. "I know I was a bit of an asshole yesterday, but you surprised me, with the whole, well, dramatic scene and all. And I didn’t mean to insult your friend,” he added, needing to explain, even though it didn’t seem to matter anymore.
kill your parents,” he said and watched Tony’s expression darkening for a brief moment. Then, the guy squared his shoulders, and turned sideways, so he looked straight at Bucky.
Tony smiled—a huge, lovestruck smile that he would probably deny until his dying day. “True.”
Looking up, Tony assessed Vision with wide eyes. “You’ll have my back, right?”
“Well, we’ve got to go,” Nat exclaimed, then stepped up to Tony. To Steve’s wonder, she caught his face in her hands and pecked him on the corner of his mouth, being careful to curve her body so that she didn’t touch him anywhere else where the slime might have landed.
Tony’s eyes immediately brightened.
He really wished he could make this easier for her, could sweep what had happened in Lagos under some giant carpet, but it wouldn’t do anyone good. Sokovia—each and every death—it was on him, and it was time they’d face the consequences of their actions.
“Maybe?”
“No point. Just… two, huh?” His face clouded over, and there was something in his voice he couldn’t quite make out. “All girls?”
“Who fired it?”
Because Steve was right, dammit—they were
The thought seemed unthinkable.
“Oh, he’ll be alright. Tony will—” Steve stopped, glancing at Tony briefly, then broke off. “I mean… I’m sure the team will treat him well,” he amended lamely.
“Tell me you got lube,” Tony gasped when Steve tugged on his belt again, opening it this time.
If there was any chance in hell that Tony could look at him after tonight.
* * *
“Well,” Steve declared into the air. “We sure haven’t done that in a while.”
In any case, there was no way to fix this, Tony realized that now. And it was time to take him down. There was the sound of air, and the next moment, Vision landed in the middle of the church. He stared at Tony with knowing eyes.
“Don’t do that,” Steve interjected before Tony could say more. “Just because I messed up today, you don’t have to keep your troubles to yourself. We’ve been over that: You’re
“Yes,” Tony whispered and kissed him fully then, even using his tongue. His hands pulled at Steve’s shirt, dragging it up and over his head. They had to break apart briefly, and it was part embarrassment and part need that had Steve press himself immediately against him once he was bare.
“Because you did nothing to stop it!” Steve yelled, before reigning himself in again. His hand was curled into a tight fist and the strain only loosened up after Tony put a hand on his shoulder, kneading the muscle there. “All this information in the hands of
Steve gasped when cool air fell on his overheated flesh. Glancing down, he had to bite his lip at the sight and the feel of Tony's hand teasing his cock just right. It took considerable effort to tear his gaze away, but when he met Tony's eyes, he felt he might get weak in the knees. When Tony asked for him to stay dressed, his words went directly to Steve's groin, making him twitch in Tony's grasp.
, this will ruin
Tony was right. Maybe he just needed to let himself had this. He might be confused, but he still knew what he wanted. And this was a stolen hour. A few blissful moments before the frightening reality of this new part of their lives set in.
Steve hadn’t even unpacked his few belongings yet and he’d already decided he wouldn’t. With all of these feelings raging inside him, he knew that being so close to Tony and not close at all would be something he couldn’t endure for long.
Steve offered a smile. “They did?”
The woman was still after him, but he was too fast.
But it wasn’t that. Not
“It involves me being used as leverage.”
“Can’t share what I don’t have,” Tony quipped and pressed a kiss on Ian’s forehead. “Your father goes where he goes, and he never tells me, isn’t that right, darling?”
“That was a joke, Steve, come on.” Tony pulled back just enough to catch Steve’s eyes before he ripped his own dress shirt down the middle, buttons flying in every direction. “There you go.”
unfair. Steve didn’t get to cry over that lost chance, the what-if they’d never gotten to try. “It killed me. It made me… I don’t even know what it made me, and I didn’t realize how much you had changed my life until it was changed. Until…” Steve stifled a shaky breath, wiping his eyes irritably with one hand. “Until you stood on the other side of this… this
“You knew we were coming,” Tony concluded, and he lowered his hands, but kept the repulsors attack-ready.
"That chart is based on
“Well, if you had she would’ve told you that I’m… that I have this tendency, about pushing people away when I—when I want the opposite. That I tend to overanalyze things until it can’t possibly be a good thing anymore. I tend to—Fuck, Steve, when it comes to people I tend to run away from my problems. Even you should know me well enough by now to know that.”
Tony smiled, nodding. “Damn straight.”
“Guys. We’ve got more important things to do right now,” Bruce said, clasping a hand on Clint’s shoulder.
It wasn’t over. How could it? He would see Steve again. It was only time. Time until they would get it all back—everything the world had taken away from them.
“It has to be you,” Strange told Tony. “Or the Captain. But as we both know, we can’t be sure he’s even still alive.”
“Yeah,” Steve replied.
Later.
What kind of institution had the woman said they were working for? Something about
Their ability to be alone had taken a serious hit over the last few weeks. While Steve wouldn’t give up Ian for the world, it took some readjustment. Suddenly, there was a very demanding third person in their lives, and between their jobs and caring for their baby, there wasn’t a lot of time just for the two of them.
A smile and a nod for agreement. “Sounds like a plan.”
Steve was sitting on the floor next to the bathroom door, his back pressed against the wall, while his forehead rested on his knees. He was shaking a little, and the whole situation had Tony so profoundly confused that he didn’t even know what to say.
He detected a hint of jealousy in his tone, and Steve smiled. “Willing, maybe,” he conceded. “But most of these people are about as interesting as watching paint dry.”
Steve drew a deep breath. “Look, I planned to leave tomorrow. I’ve meant to tell you.”
“Wouldn’t know
“That’s why I didn't tell you.”
One, there had been a bomb.
Steve turned in the other direction when he heard a noise, and saw Bruce standing in the kitchen, punching numbers on the phone. As he hit the final number, he turned and saw them. Before he could speak, the cell phone in Tony’s jacket began to ring loudly.
did a scan of your arm just now and there’s only a small glitch with the motion sensor that made it shut down. I can fix that in a minute or two. However…” He paused for a moment, gauging his words very carefully. “There’s a few things I could improve. I mean, don’t get me wrong, the arm is amazing as it is, the responsiveness is state-of-the art, and the way they integrated the settings with your nervous system is giving me a headache, but… if you’d let me work on it for a few hours, I think I could make it move a bit smoother, I know some mechanisms are still giving you a bit of a hard time.”
“But… he
They took up their usual seats in the cockpit, with Tony flying the jet and Steve directing him.
“Please be okay,” Tony breathed, the worry spreading through his body like fire, and
Steve smiled. “I promise you we’re not lost.”
As Steve opened his eyes a few days later, the sun was already high in the sky, and there were voices and footsteps and sounds everywhere, as if the walls and the floors were always buzzing with life.
“You’re trembling.”
“As is Strucker,” Steve supplied.
Ever since that kiss… he was so aware of Tony that if he closed his eyes even for a second, he would find himself remembering the taste of his mouth, the feeling of his lips, his beard scratching lightly against his skin… And that was bad.
“What were you thinking, Rogers,” he murmured, running a finger over the tiny display.
, and maybe—
Steve smiled faintly. “’course I do. Having you at my six is great. Like in the old times.”
Tony sighed, brushing hair out of Steve’s face with his free hand, his lips unable to keep from stealing a kiss off his brow. He loved Steve like this. He loved him always, of course, but he especially loved him like this. Cuddled against him, peaceful, at rest, and so trusting of him. So incredibly trusting. Just allowing Tony to hold him like this placed more trust in his arms than anything he could have imagined.
Tony tried to ignore how hard his heart was hammering inside the suit, but it was no use. Everything had happened so fast, too goddamn fast, and the adrenaline of the battle was still steadfastly pumping through his veins.
They made a beeline for the bar soon after. Steve ordered a whiskey and drank it down with a firm, unhappy grimace. He hated alcohol, but he needed something to help him not think about… certain…
TS 1:12 P.M.>Shit. Need 2 be in Tokyo 2nte. SI stuff. How about 2mor?
been sixteen years since Tony had told him he loved him, after all. “I’m sorry,” he said quietly. “Sorry for dying on you. Sorry you had to look for me so long.”
her, and—”
Bracing himself, Steve turned his hand in Tony’s own, pushing Tony’s fingers open until their palms pressed together.
“Yeah, he did,” Steve said, his voice hesitant.
“And what did you research there?”
Tony shuddered in effect, his eyes rolling closed, wondering how he hadn’t even heard Steve enter the barn. That probably was a testament to how irrevocably lost he felt. “Laura asked me to look at the tractor,” he explained. “Figured it was a good way as any to get my mind off of things for a bit.”
“Did you hear what I said?” Steve asked. Not that he’d expected cheering and tears of joy but… alright, maybe he’d expected some of that. “I just told you that I want to have this kid with you.”
Steve glanced after Tony, before turning to collect the empty plates, carrying them over to the counter.
“Tony…”
“Tony, too. Just because it took him a while to come around to it…”
“You are my mission,” Bucky screamed, his fist hovering above Steve, and there was nothing that would make him look more superior in that instant. “YOU… ARE… MY… MISSION!”
—told him was the experience of a lifetime.
When they made their way back to the camp, it was already dark. The sky was rolling with wavering, quivering clouds, and in the distance, a thunderstorm was roaring.
For a moment, Tony didn’t move, and Steve’s heart missed a beat, thinking he might have truly lost Tony’s love over this. But then, he caved in. Tony’s lips pressed firmly against Steve’s and there was a hot breath against his skin as he put both of his hands on top of Steve’s, pulling him in. Tony leaped into the kiss with everything he had, exploring his mouth with liberation. Their hands were clasped together as much as possible, until one of Tony’s arms wrapped around Steve’s waist to pull him closer.
“Steve’s been wanting to talk to you,” Stark said after a moment. The words were soft—and so incredibly humble it didn’t seem possible they had come out of Stark’s mouth.
Steve had absolutely no idea whatsoever how their conversation could’ve gone south so fast. He just stood there, unable to find words.
“Don’t you think Sam would prefer you as a bunk partner? I could get handsy, you know,” Tony snapped with a vicious undertone.
He shook his head. Of course nothing like that was happening. The Avengers would've contacted him if there was any sort of trouble. He shoved his hands in his pockets and shook his head again. This was ridiculous. Tony would be here any minute and Steve's head was all twisted out of shape. He had no idea how to broach the subject. Silly, because Steve knew Tony loved him, and he loved Tony. Steve rested his fists on the counter and sighed. It should be easy enough to just… ask.
They had grown even closer over those last weeks, and even though Natasha didn’t show it, Tony knew how much she missed Barnes. She could’ve followed them to wherever T’Challa’s hide-out was, but instead had decided to help Tony keep the boat afloat.
Something raw and animalistic left Gamora’s throat then, and she sunk against Peter’s chest, shaking.
“I didn’t
Steve laughed when Bucky pressed a spoon in his hand, before he opened the lid. He knew that JARVIS was thoughtful enough to always stock the fridge full of every possible type of food that anyone could ever want, but ever since Bucky had joined their group about two months ago, there was a new assortment of chocolate that led Steve to believe the AI had caught on to Bucky’s sweet tooth.
What had happened back home?
you stop looking a second away from a giant meltdown. You won’t do her any good like this.”
It didn’t take much longer for Tony to finish his work on Rhodey’s suit. He quickly explained the new upgrades, then watched as Rhodey did a quick test flight outside.
“They won’t put us in jail,” Sam said, and Steve knew it was meant as a joke, but the quick look Natasha cast Tony spoke volumes.
Steve blinked, realizing it wasn’t either of his friends, but Dr. Bruce Banner, Tony’s therapist. He knew the two had become close friends over the years—that Bruce had helped Tony dealing with lots of traumatic issues, most of them concerning Tony’s own family.
And while Steve no longer felt the walls of Stark Mansion were suffocating him, he sometimes still wondered about Mister Hammer’s words. That Tony would eventually tire of him. It might be the truth, and yet Steve couldn’t summon enough regret to wish himself away from Tony’s side. He’d known, from the start, that Tony’s heart belonged to his dead wife—had known that his own love would have to be enough for both of them.
Steve opened his mouth, then closed it again. He knew he had to say
So when we said there's only the epilogue left we actually meant there's 2 more chaps + the epilogue. DUH.
Next to them, Rhodes took Carol into a hug, released her, then grabbed Tony before he could object. There was, in fact, not one person on the road that did not get an eclipse-hug from Rhodes that day. It was hilarious. The people were still awestruck from what had happened and merely stood around and took turns shaking each other’s hands when they were approached.
Tony yelped, and immediately set out to return the attack. “You’re going
At the end, it only took them sixteen and a half minutes before the thin trail gave way to a clearing. Just a few meters away from them, a small log cabin stood in front of thick pine trees.
Before Steve could stop himself, his feet carried him forward. While he walked, the only thing he was aware was his own thundering heartbeat.
, if there’s one single thing makes me doubt you’re the man for me, it’s your taste in music.”
It still hurt to think about Jarvis. He would probably always mourn him. But Tony thought—that was probably what it meant to love someone. What it meant to grieve someone. It was a little bit like the black hole in the sky.
“Are you—” Tony echoed, adorably flustered. “Certainly n-not!”
Which didn’t really explain why he was in the workshop in the first place, Tony thought with an inward sigh. He knew Obi came down here often, looking at whatever project he was working on, whether or not Tony had given him permission. It was annoying as hell, to say the least, but Tony wasn’t stupid. Whatever Obi got into his hands here wasn’t exactly the interesting stuff.
“And you think that… this future… is ours?” Tony asked.
Tony nodded. “Yeah… looks worse than it is. This is a good thing.”
This was better, familiar in a strange way. He hadn't had much of a chance to be physically close to Tony outside of their insatiable sex sessions, and still every intimate gesture felt… natural.
“I didn’t even—”
Sitting down on the end of their bed, he helped Ian into his panties, then dropped the rest over his head and buttoned it up in the back. “There now,” he said, patting the boy’s little bottom, “all set for bed.”
“That you
A part of him agreed with that assessment, but the other… the larger part… thought about Charles Spencer, and that guy’s daughter, and knew the alternative was something he couldn’t live with any longer.
The initial idea had been to drink until he didn't care, and then go home. Tony came over before he managed to achieve either feat, but maybe alcohol wouldn't have solved the problem for him in the first place. Something to think about when he was sober, he thought, a slightly goofy smile flitting on his face before he reined it into a more serious expression.
“Right,” Tony said, grimacing.
“Means to an end,” Tony explained, drumming his fingers on the table a few times before he looked back up to meet Pepper’s stare. “Banner agreed to work on the arc reactor with me. Now we need partners. Partners who know what they’re doing in their respective fields. And we need them fast if I want to do this while I still have investors.”
Clint nodded. “And fuck this one.”
“Hey, no,” Tony said, reaching out for him. “Don’t do that.”
“Maybe,” Steve replied on a wink and leaned down to press another lingering kiss against Tony’s lips. “We should get inside. The others are probably already up. I’ll make you breakfast if you wanna shower.”
“Sometime, yes,” Tony agreed softly, and leaned in to kiss Steve’s lips once more. When they broke apart, he twirled the sunglasses in his hand, looking down at it. “I thought I’d call it Binarily Augmented Retro Framing.”
So much for ‘let’s introduce you to my godfather. It’ll be great’.
?” Tony echoed, huffing. “You speaking ‘21st century’ is still all kinds of disturbing.”
he thought, but couldn’t bring himself to actually say it. Because if he and Tony didn’t happen—he’d also destroy this future of theirs, and he knew that was about the last thing Tony needed to hear right now.
“No,” he stammered with a voice that wasn’t remotely his own and lashed out again. “No, no, no, no, no…”
“So we’ve got everything we ever wanted,” he told Bucky firmly, because now that his best friend was back at his side, safe and as well as could be expected under these circumstances, it was finally true.
“Touch…” Tony pleaded, “please touch me.”
“Oh, he’s gracing us with his attention,” Stark announced with a hand over his heart. He made a few steps towards the cot, considering him. “I’m Tony Stark, this is Bruce Banner. Do you know where you are? Can you say anything? Hearing myself talk is getting a bit boring.”
“Never said otherwise. I just… I was looking for a solution. I was
There was some electric buzzing, and then the suit went limp.
The black disc of the sun was outlined by a fine line of shimmering light. The sudden descending darkness was eerie. The air went completely still. The disoriented birds flying everywhere nowhere. A million eyes raised to the sky. It was as if to complement the deep uncanny silence, the crowd suddenly roared in amazement.
“TMI,” Clint immediately said, then there were a few second of absolute silence, before Steve’s hesitant voice resounded inside the helmet. “I’m one minute out.”
“Stay back!” Steve yelled. “JARVIS. Stay back! That’s an order!”
“Fair enough,” Tony said, having half a mind to just tear off his own clothes, rendering all of them useless so Steve had to follow through with his little dare, but he was too busy
It had begun a few days ago: the changes. Changes in Barnes’ behavior that had been small enough that they first escaped Bruce’s notice before slowly compiling in severity. He was talking more, mostly to Natasha, but even so: He was talking. He ate regularly, accepted new clothes, and the panic attacks came less frequently. The baby steps were over, obviously, and Tony figured that Barnes finally returned to something close to whoever he’d been before.
Steve ran. He ran until his legs collapsed at the foot of the staircase leading to Tony’s workshop, and waited for the world to stop spinning.
“It’s fine, Tony,” Steve interrupted, and looked back at her. “You don’t have to agree with us. We don’t need your consent to keep him here.” He shot the rest of them—Coulson in particular—a look that warned them not to argue with him.
“… Hey, Steve.”
Christ…”
He takes the Iron Man helmet and crams it over his head. “Talk to me, J. Please.”
“No.”
“… I don’t care.”
Steve drops his hand to Tony’s waist, and squeezes. His knee buckles and collides painfully with the stupid drawer of the desk. He turns around and leans his butt against the wood, and stares at Steve eyeball to eyeball. Daring. A sly smirk is plastered over Steve’s face, but it’s not unkind. He figures how his own mug looks like – given current circumstances – and it probably shows, because Steve’s grubby paws hesitate over the front of his zipper.
He gets it, all right? Their lives have flashed before their eyes several times. They’re all a bit tired, a bit agitated

And Tony reaches

He fears for his life, yet he allows Steve to inevitably strips him off his clothes, and superficial dignity, and edges him to a giddy climax.
And there’s a
Rolling once more to his side, he bounds up the stairs and bursts into the generator room, leaving the chaos that is decimating his mansion behind him.
“The processors aren’t built for wrecking firewalls. You know what? Give me that. I remember he looks like this intern we had over the summer five or six years ago. Andrew Ilnyckyj… see if I can stalk his Facebook, or LinkedIn – he’s at Buzzfeed now?”
“See you on the other side!”
“They were coming for you! I didn’t –” Steve’s finger freezes over a ribcage, and Tony takes a deep breath. “Didn’t think. It just happened.” He clears his throat. “Avengers look after each other, right?”
It’s a talking tablet, of course it is, it’s Tony’s. Every hunk of metal is near-sentient with the guy. How does he interact with it?
What a terrible way to die.
“No, Sir,” Gary replies. “Never seen him.”
“Mr Stark?”
“Sir, we have satellite footage of an airstrike launched on the Ali Al Salem Air Base forty hours ago.”
And slams his mouth over Steve’s, quelling streams of protests and polite cusses with tongues. Somewhere in front of them, they hear mutterings of “Jesus Christ” and furniture being jostled. Maybe Gary just passes out. Tony’s hand sneaks up the curve of Steve’s buttocks to grope him thoroughly through the yoga pants.
Thirty minutes before their private affair broke out in a circus – roughly speaking, after three more orgasms on Steve’s part before he let Tony have his – Steve did the nice thing and left Tony to collect himself on the soiled bed. Tony didn’t dare to deploy the Extremis to its fullest capacity
“You’re OK, Tony. I got you.”
“Mind if I borrow your car for a bit?”
“Only one way to find out.”
The third screen blinks red. Tony tries some of the passwords his keygen generated, but the section remains adamantly locked. “I’m blocked, J. Why am I blocked?”
And Gary looks like he’s about to have a stroke. “Yeah, OK. Got it.”
“Come on in! No one’s around!”
“… Right.”
“I know that car.” Tony rushes forward to the monitor. By then the images switch again, and he’s staring at the black-and-white portraits of his

But first, work. The kind of nonsense that Fury can’t wait until Monday to lay on him. “‘Letting the Avengers loose’? No, Nick. We’re not criminals. We answer to the WSC when we need to, but until then, we’re free to live our lives as we see fit. They want us locked down, they have to answer to the ruling institution of this country.”
“SHIELD thinks the hijacking was a cover for the acquisition and sale of classified intelligence. The sale went sour, and that led to Nick’s death.”
“Shit –”
“Steve, look. I’m sorry, alright? I got ahead of myself, I’m not considering your… feelings. This must be hard for you.”
She smiles a little, but there’s still lingering grief in her eyes. “Can we patent that?”
“Thank you. Oh… dammit.” Count on work to be the most effective boner killer. If only he could say they-don’t-pay-him-enough-for-this-shit, but they do. Have at that. “One minute, Steve. I’m so sorry about this.”
Another low moan breaks the silence. What it means is unmistakable – what Tony is doing in the confinement of his own goddam room, door open and inviting – and Steve retreats, a step at a time, until he’s all the way back in the elevator going back to the forty-fifth floor, wondering if
“I won’t. Do it now, Steve.” Before darkness consumes him. “Do it.”
“You mention a debriefing?” Tony holds out his tablet for Steve to take. In the generous span of five hours, JARVIS has uploaded whatever he can get his digital fingers on the Mandarin. More will come, but this will have to do for the moment. He’s counting on the government’s competency for the gory details.
in him – on him. He’s afraid he might combust. Morbid hallucinations… not helping! Imagine that, his own bodily fluids boiling and evaporating – how is he still alive…
“So, Mr Stark.” Another pump on his cock, and precum eventually slides along the length. “How do you want this? My hand, or my mouth?”
“Steve!”
intervention. The rescue mission is going down swimmingly, save for the sudden revelation of a
And then, a holographic Iron Man comes swooping down from a corner, and it zips past the portrait without so much as a second glance. Tony turns on his heels and makes for the exit. “Bold, huh? Exactly what we need in the Tower. Me and my Dad comparing dick sizes.”
The real reason he’s unpacking his suitcase after having checked into a Pendry suite is because cash is king, even in this business. The God-honest truth is, it’s not cheap to run a pharmaceutical firm, and it’s not cheap to operate the labs. Labour alone takes a huge chunk of the fund, and that’s where Tony comes in. He’s meant to expand that cash pool so the folks on Cetta’s payroll keep their asses in their respective seats and make this all work somehow.
Steve nods once, and grips the tablet tighter. “Thank you.”
. The crazy pyro show at dawn earlier still is vivid in Steve’s mind, and Tony chases them with insistent pecks on his upper lip. Each follow up more hesitant than before when Steve adamantly stoops frozen over Tony.
It’s over. It’s over for them, and it’s all his fault. His own. But, he won’t rob Tony of the Avengers.
“Come on, Milos,” Tony encourages breathlessly, one knee nudging Milos’ thigh. “What’s your next move?”
weird.
“Steve…” He chokes, air too precious a commodity. His lungs are boiling, and it…
Fuck the Lion King.
From the tail of his eye, Steve observes Tony chow down scavenged food like it’s the best thing since cronut. He most likely hasn’t eaten in a day. Something twinges in Steve’s chest. There is just so much he wanted to say to Tony. So much to ask. He almost lost that chance. This job, every day may be their last. Doesn’t mean it doesn’t hurt when it happens.
“Tony, calm down.”
Something doesn’t feel right with Steve’s car. He sees undulating shadows in the driver’s seat. The car itself is swaying.
“OK,” she says. And Tony almost falls off his chair.
“Anthony Edward Stark!”
“That… won’t be necessary, thanks. I’ll come back tomorrow.”
have the right to information. And information is what Steve has. What Tony has. So,
“Small talk. About time we get to know each other, no? I know you like wearing undershirts two sizes smaller, but I can’t figure out if you prefer red to blue. I don’t consider white a colour…”
“He did that on purpose. Chose the most uncomfortable position to do his paperwork in so he wouldn’t fall asleep. Didn’t work, obviously.”
“My work on Howardium.” Pepper looks up questioningly, and he taps at his chest. “The new element. Near infinite-power source. With a little tweaking, it’s easy to weaponise. Iron Man’s a great example. Now that they have the guns, how are they going to track down targets they intend to vaporise?” His finger taps on the fifth item on the list. “The enhanced surveillance system for the Tower and Expo.”
“Sir, we are
nervous
The whirring of his suits and servers are like symphony to his ears. Three hours is cutting it close – SHIELD is bound to realise something is amiss. Anytime now a STRIKE team might just come busting through the front door.
the general safety of the universe. No amount of tinkering is worth that. When the disco lights subside, Steve waits for up to an hour for Tony to voluntarily ooze out of the workshop.
“It’s yours, too.”
“Yeah, but not on a national scale. For a split second, I did wonder if you planted that idea in my head on the pretext of beefing up security, so I would develop this on SHIELD’s behalf –”
“I want to tell you – personally – that I’ll be leaving tomorrow. I think I owe you this much.”
Something heavy is being dragged up the stairs. His bracelet is dead. Not blinking. Since when?
But, God… it’s hell, it’s fire and brimstone and he’s melting again, like before, right after the injection –
hard, and each thrust of his hip chips away at Tony’s resolve. “
Fair enough. “We can do this in the other study.” Steve doesn’t want to call it his study, because it’s not his, not really, not when the man paying for it is staring holes into his face. “It’s just as quiet.”
. Brand new! Prying the hood up with a crowbar he found next to the cables is no biggie either, so is clamping the terminals of the car batteries to the helmet.
“Yes.” Steve’s laughter is as light as sunshine, Tony’s first in hearing Steve speak so carefreely. “Four fifteen it is. I’ll see you, Mr Stark.”
“Catch up, Dr Zola. My family tree is all over the Internet, I’m sure.”
right.
“Say stop, and I will,” Steve promises again in a whisper as he leans in… and Tony promptly cocks his chin sideway. That’s all on the brainstem. Reflex. Steve gets the hint and backs up somewhat, but something inside Tony shrivel up a little. He’s still rock hard – guy downstairs probably does a cheer of its own when Steve cups him in a palm – and he thrusts into it. He welcomes the heat, the friction, and he can’t stop –
, gone! Hell, he sent the note to SHIELD Forensics, and triple watched every surveillance recording within the Tower.”
Something whizzes past – all sixteen pieces, to be exact – and wallops into the back of his skulls. Blood splatters across the wall – on Tony – he shudders at the warmth and stickiness. Despite the lethal forces, the man
“Oh. Sounds like genocide is back on the menu.”
“Mr Stark? Get the medic!”
It suddenly becomes clear why SHIELD has taken nil interest in the Mandarin so far, despite their – dare he say – exaggerated coverage on national airwaves. So much hype, yet so little action… because SHIELD –
Tony collects himself in record time and he turns around, still on his knees, on four, and he crawls up into Steve’s lap. Chin tilting upward, he coos, “I’m a generous lover. Let me,” and his fingers dance suggestively over the waistband of Steve’s yoga pants.
He tears away from the showcase and runs to his car. The mansion is… Tony has no personal attachment to it. But what’s underneath – his personal workshop, his collection of suits, his private servers and data storages – there’s no way Tony wouldn’t come forth for them.
“… I’m already dying, Steve. I’m not like you. I can’t live for a hundred years.”
“Same difference!”
“The drive was a backup from the computers on Lemurian Star.”
“… Whatever you say.” Tony only concedes because of that volume of unspoken fear splashed across Steve’s face. They don’t know what’s wrong with him yet. What gives him the power to control fire, to heal. And this isn’t the time to conduct impromptu physicals. A trio of killer machines are about to be launched. Millions of lives as collaterals.
As fleetingly as the tap of Steve’s heel on the tiled floor, Steve stands suddenly close to Tony. He cocks his chin at an angle, and the scent of cheap shampoo grows stronger. There is a kiss, Tony thinks, as light as the fall of sunlight on his blonde hair on a good summer’s day. It’s over before it begins, and Steve backs away, preferring to rummage through the closet for a fresh change of clothes instead.
“Status, Stark,” Steve commands after the first uneventful minute.
“That’s why we have them fixed three hours ago.”
the cure is beyond horrifying. They might be up against an enemy with no compunction for sociopathic approaches if that means getting the job done. An enemy who has no fear, who is not held back by standards – nigh unstoppable.
“… How thoughtful.” Tony gives Milos an experimental prod. “All lubed up.”
Yet another SHIELD agent – says so on her Kevlar vest – who beckons them to hurry. Steve breaks into a run. Tony catches up easily, and they all pile into the back of the truck, upon which the driver accelerates away into freedom. They both sit opposite her, Steve completely at ease while Tony teetering on the edge of his seat.
That’s easy – the same pool that Insight drags for information. “The World Wide Web.”
And the fireball Tony has been nurturing with his right palm is thrown towards a Harley Davidson. Charred metal bits leapt magnificently into the sky in a burst of fireworks, and with it comes their strategic respite, however momentary.
“Killing him won’t bring them back, Tony.”
“Yes, Sir.”
He wants to know where the Mandarin was last seen at. He wants to know how many are loyal to his mission, his weaponry of choice, what he had for breakfast yesterday. The row of spotlights dim as the projector turns on. He squints at lines and lines of information before they’re properly formed, hunting for keywords, and nada. What JARVIS
After that, Steve asks Tony to drop him off at his apartment, and Tony obliges. He hasn’t explicitly offered Steve to stay with him, but that goes without saying, right? Eventually, it occurs to him that he
“Come on, come on, come on.”
“Dick.”
The elevator only goes one way: down. The basement too has running electricity. There’s light and heating and a steady hum of machineries. Sounds lively, like Tony’s personal workshop in Malibu – when he still had one.
“What the hell…”
“… No.”
“You didn’t know what they were for?”
“Can you move to a less visible spot? Stay there until the upload is completed?”
“… What do you mean?”
Tony reclaims his plastic chair beside Steve’s bed and helps himself to Steve’s jello. It tastes more like spoonful of refined sugar than anything else, but whatever it takes to take his mind off Ross and the sack of crap that comes with it, until Steve’s gaze positively bore between his eyes that he replaces the half-eaten desserts-for-paupers on the nightstand with a curt tap. “What?”
Steve feels a glow of pride swelling in his chest that warms up his small smile. “Tony Stark.”
“Blow me, Stark.”
exit wound in his stomach – but finds the skin and flesh pristine. “Should I slap myself just to make sure?”
As the door to the foyer’s main entrance swings shut behind them, the pandemonium ebbs. They make a beeline for the elevator – the one that serves only the Avengers base, and they go upmost to Tony’s suite. This ride would’ve been ten times more awkward if not for the Muzak, a recent addition to all the Tower’s elevators because Steve made an off-hand comment about how there used to be music playing in their elevators. It used to be Bach? Beethoven maybe? Certainly not Black Sabbath in jazz.
“Yes,” he said eventually. “It capsized and sank.”
A wrangled gasp tore at Steve’s throat when he felt Tony’s hand encircling his wrist, pulling his fingers free. His other hand fumbled with his own pants once more and produced a row of condoms, ripping one of them open. He leaned up a bit to get a better look, then slid the condom on Steve’s cock with somewhat trembling fingers.
, Tony’s mind supplied weakly.
“Yes,” Steve admitted. “Of course I am. But—”
“That’s just it, though. The world is going to end anyway, unless we can find a way to stock up our defenses. I might not be able to undo my failure with Ultron, but I know our only hope is in creating something powerful enough to oppose him.”
“I love you,” Steve whispered against Tony’s ear, because that was the one thing that was undoubtedly still true. Then, he closed his eyes.
--deep down, that this can’t possibly be true. I was never the kind of guy for a passing infatuation.”
“A ball.” Pepper’s eyebrows were raised up so high that her bangs covered them completely. “You want to throw a ball.”
, it was every teenager fantasy coming true in one glorious moment. “Keep that on, would you?”
“If anything goes wrong, inform the others,” he told the room in general and heard JARVIS agree with a fair amount of disapproval in his voice.
Steve frowned. “Very funny.”
They stepped into the elevator, pressing the button for the garage.
to be patient. “Well, Nat’s a big tattletale.”
“There are no guarantees in this life, my friend. Sometimes, we need to believe,” Thor replied and nodded his head in Tony’s direction. “I think you know that.”
.” He rolled his eyes at Steve, while he was brushing a hand over his chin and cheeks. He sighed. “The things I would do for a razor.”
As soon as he stepped into the hallway, slow footsteps sounded, then the door creaked open. Natasha was staring intently at her phone, not even looking up.
“Yeah, whatever,” Tony said on an annoyed breath. Russian wasn’t exactly his forte, and he only caught on a few words. Still, he was almost relieved that Barnes was talking to him at all—and in full sentences.
Sex with Tony still was breathtakingly, toe-curlingly, mind-blowingly perfect. They were completely in synch with each other, and after years of being together, they had memorized each and every one of their buttons and how exactly to press—or not to press them.
“I’ll go,” Steve said into the phone and already started the car’s motor.
like fainting, too.
Steve didn't wait for a response and hurried for the stairs.
He felt like laughing then, and a little bit like crying, too, but the only sound leaving his mouth was a dry huff.
“Did you get me a boy toy for the weekdays? Have someone fulfill my needs while you’re in DC? That’s so considerate.”
Was Tony avoiding him? Because he wasn’t ‘his’ Steve?
“I’m not picky. Whatever you’ll make sounds great,” he said, while he grabbed for a mug, still waiting for his coffee to brew. He cast Steve a carefree smile. “I can help you, but fair warning, I tend to set things on fire a lot. There might even have been an explosion involved in Malibu, once, but that was completely JARVIS’ fault for not warning me in time.”
[TStark] [chat_server:46953]
His sight whitened out briefly, and all Steve could do was press his eyes closed to gather himself.
Steve smiled and cupped Tony's cheek, drawing his eyes upwards. “I love you.”
Sorry for the long wait. This chap does contain a bit of original TWS dialogue, I hope you don't mind, it's definitely not gonna happen often. Thanks to
Tony braced himself against the wall, listening to the quiet sounds of Steve whispering under his breath, while his body stretched to accommodate him. One of Steve's hands rested over Tony's belly, holding him flush against Steve's warm chest. Tony groaned with pleasure when Steve was completely seated inside of him, and he turned his head aside, trying to catch his eyes.
Tony hummed in agreement, swallowing down the food, then clearing his throat. “That’s one delicious sandwich, Rogers,” he said and took another bite for emphasis, before putting the plate down on the small work table behind him.
Tony bit his lower lip. “Yeah. All these people just waiting to jump your bones. Sounds horrible.”
This was going to be good, he thought, smiling at the blueprint. Too expensive for mass production, but that was something he could work on later. For now, the functionality was all that mattered, and this… would be
Steve released a long breath and settled into Bucky’s embrace. “Thanks.”
As soon as the rain had stopped, they’d gone hunting together, and Tony had even helped him with gutting and cleaning the animals after. They’d eaten as much as their stomachs allowed, and afterwards, Tony immediately set out to repair and improve their shelter.
“I told you, I’ve been here before. I know the way,” Steve told him, smile becoming positively smug when Tony stopped fighting him, his gaze fixating on Steve’s lips instead. He stole a kiss from him, lingering momentarily, then continued on his way. “Besides,” he called over his shoulder. “I thought you
“FRIDAY, ask Happy to go to our pediatrician, get some homeopathic pain relievers for teething. Make a list of things that help, and order some teething toys while you’re at it.”
“Not you, too,” Sam mumbled, as he walked past them.
“And one or two blades won’t cut it,” Maria said, leaning forward.
Steve hummed noncommittally, firmly fighting down the heat rising to his cheeks. “Are you still in the meeting?”
Fumbling out the chip, he pushed it forward and—there was another shot, piercing through Steve’s other arm. He groaned mutely, exhaustion almost blocking the pain, and watched as Bucky came rushing towards him. The second Iron Legion suit blocked his path though, taking up the fight for now.
“You could come with me, take Ian and…”
—shrugged, as he sat up a bit to unbutton and slide off his suit jacket. He loosened his tie somewhat before settling down again. “It’s my dream,” he retorted. “I have a habit of turning up in my dreams.”
Tony sighed, sounding tormented. “That’s how this will work from here on out, huh?”
“What?”
kissed each other. Steve let his fingertips brush beneath Tony’s shirt, across his heart, trying to pull out the hurt.
Flat on his back against the paving stones, her slim body was straddling his waist and a knife pressed into his chest. All this time, he had thought that if—one day—he would reach this position, he would not fight it. He would look death square in the face; he would meet it without fear. And there was no fear. Yet the acceptance of death had left him. It was the thrill of the battle that did it. In the flush of the fight, he had found something to give meaning to his existence, and he didn’t want to surrender that meaning just yet.
Tony snorted. That had been so long ago. “That was movie night, you jackass. And the pants were a gift from Clint.”
There was a flash of red in his eyes, before he squeezed them shut in a pleasure that bordered on pain and his lips parted on a groan that rasped harshly from his throat.
Tony wiped his mouth with his fingers, before licking his thumb clean. His cheeks were beautifully flushed and his eyes blown wide with—
Directly opposite the main doors, there was a stage where the band was playing.
Soon after, dinner was served, and just before the fireworks started, Tony pulled Steve to the dance area. He led him through the throngs of people and out on the open marble floor, ablaze with the light of several huge chandeliers. The back wall to the right was full of windows, along with several sets of open French doors, letting in the cool night air. Beyond that, Tony could barely make out the outlines of the huge Stark Expo premises.
Slowly, Tony opened his eyes, and his trademark-smirk appeared on his face. “Hate to break it to you, but you’re not in,” he said without malice. “I’m fine, go on.”
And somehow, this Tony still had decided that uniting his life with Steve’s was a really good idea.
“You can’t know that.”
When Steve looked up, he realized they were mostly alone now, with only Natasha, Clint, Sam and Bucky lingering near him and Strange packing books and ingredients he’d probably used to open the portal at the far end of the room.
He didn’t even want to think about all those thoughts running through Obi’s mind right now. Pepper was right, Obi didn’t fight wars he couldn’t win, but he was a sore loser all the same. And payback might be a long time coming, but Tony wouldn’t be deluding himself into thinking that this was the end of that particular story.
, Steve realized they were the best friends of the man he wanted to have at his side in any way said man wanted to be. And there was every chance that they would never accept him. They would never accept him at all.
“JARVIS,” Tony called, heaving the thing into his arms. “Complete lockdown, and prepare the contamination chamber.”
Natasha hummed, and fell quiet for a long moment. Then, she cleared her throat. “Well, Bruce didn’t come upstairs, either,” she settled on diplomatically. What she didn’t say was ‘How is any of that unusual, exactly?’ but Steve heard it either way. And she was right, of course. “You know how they get, and JARVIS makes them eat power bars and drink juices. It’s gonna be fine.”
“I’m a Stark,” Tony answered easily, like that was the answer to everything. Well, in some ways, Steve guessed it really was.
“There’s no way to reach him now,” Strange interrupted. “And even if there was… The sudden rush of omnipotence is too much for even the finest mind. Thanos likely didn’t care about the consequences, but if you try to wield the Stones’ powers all by yourself, it
When Tony walked up to him, Steve raised a questioning brow, and smiled, when Tony gave a tiny nod in return. He tugged him down beside him, carefully repositioning so he wouldn’t wake Ian. Tony curled into his embrace before resting his head on Steve’s shoulder.
didn’t listen.”
Steve hummed in agreement and kissed Tony soundly on the lips. “Happy birthday, sweetheart.”
“Okay, I don’t get it,” Rhodes said, eventually. He leaned forward to look through the windshield. “I thought you guys made up, finally. What’s gotten into him?”
She startled somewhat, and glanced up at him. Her eyes briefly flickered back to the van, but eventually, she shook her head with a smile. “Nothing,” she said. “Just a weird train of thought.”
Rhodey was about to protest, Tony could see it, so he just turned around and—very gracefully—walked down the way towards the lab.
Tony nodded in agreement, and Steve sat down next to him at the table, reaching for his hand and feeling relief course through him when Tony squeezed his fingers. He looked around at the fine porcelain—and the many candles. It was all so very overwhelming. Steve now lived in a world where his meals would be served on a candlelit table every single day.
SR 3:51 P.M.>Yes
Tony arched a brow and leaned back. The cold wall against his shoulder was suddenly comforting in a bizarre way. This was getting a bit out of hand, wasn’t it? But Steve was
“And you want to go… camping,” Steve said, looking at the offered hand. “With me.”
Steve let go of the swab, one side soaked with blood, and inspected Tony’s face for a moment, before he turned around. “You’re gonna be okay. I need to talk to Maria. Buck, would you…” He trailed off, and without another look in Tony’s direction, left the room.
The following days were a complete blur—and surely the best of Steve’s entire life.
Suddenly, Tony had Steve’s face captured between his hands, and pressed his mouth to his. “We do,” he agreed heatedly.
wanting to discuss his handicap any further.
Tony snorted. He wasn’t sorry.
“No fucking,” Steve scolded softly and all-too-chastely kissed his cheek. “I’m not gonna ‘fuck’ you, Tony. It’s—”
come to terms with the fact that I’m the Antichrist?” Tony said, mocking him. “Yeah, I don’t think that’s how it works.”
Tony’s eyes found a spot on the wall and focused. There was nothing about this that made any sense. His life was getting wonkier by the minute, and it was entirely Steve’s fault. “What did he write?” he asked.
“I did,” Steve said. “I’d almost forgotten what it’s like to eat a meal without providing one at the same time.”
“Show it to me again,” Steve demanded. “Your other face… the mask.”
Rhodey snorted, though Tony was not finding anything about this funny. “You never even told me what happened between the two of you. You guys were inseparable; you even helped him with his physics project all the time. And seriously, Tony, Steve’s one of the nicest guys in school, what could he have possibly done to make you so angry?”
Steve nodded slowly and took a deep breath, then he prodded Tony’s opening.
He was being casual, never outright asking, only hinting that his opinion on the matter might have—hypothetically—changed. He hadn’t imagined Steve would say yes right away… the guy liked to weigh the pros and cons of pretty much everything, so with a big decision like this it would take him a moment to find out how he wanted to do this.
, he thought, letting himself dwell in this very moment.
"You're staying the night, yeah?" he mumbled.
“God help me, but you’re magnificent,” Tony said with a raspy voice, before leaning down and
“Tell me what?” Tony asked.
Bucky threw up his hands. “Really? How much more proof do you need? He
“Yeah, me too.”
!” Tony hissed. “This was my room, and my privacy and you had no right—” He clenched both hands to fists and took a deep, trembling breath to calm himself. “You know, just… stop it. I don’t want to fucking talk about it.”
He stopped in the doorway of the boathouse and the scene in front of him all but broke his heart. Tony looked hollow from where he sat on the floor next to one of the sailboats. As if he was slipping away from this world completely. It took a few agonizingly long seconds before he raised his gaze to Steve.
Sam and Clint had taken control over the cockpit, while Bucky was sitting next to Steve, holding a compress bandage against the wound on his cheek, where Ultron had burned him.
Steve arched a brow. “Yeah, because you never brag.”
“What does it change?” he asked with a defeated breath. “Bucky’s dead… I will be dead soon.”
Natasha ducked her head, smiling. “Sweet,” she commented. “You realize Tony’s doing it all the time?”
It was instinct that took over and made Steve move, despite his unease, and simply do as Bucky ordered.
Steve frowned. That was… hard to believe. He had only ever done his duty.
isn’t working!”
And when he met Steve’s gaze again, Tony also made sure he saw the inferno in his eyes. The inferno that spanned over miles across a black sea. There was no light in the devil’s eyes, no sun, just a blanket of smoke and fire.
Tony smiled at the look of collected coolness on Steve’s face as he walked up to the bed and sat down on top of him. Steve was very good with keeping his emotions in check, but Tony knew he had to be at least a little nervous. And while he could understand why Steve didn’t want to let it show too much, he still preferred to be too cautious than do something Steve wouldn’t like.
“I believe I’m looking at him.”
“Nat’s downstairs,” Tony said. “Instant baby-sitter.”
,” Pepper specified, as though the concept was entirely foreign to her. “Are you
“—that James decided to join the party,” Natasha continued, sending Steve a sweet smile, and Tony found himself sighing in relief. There were moments when he really,
"Anything else?" Steve asked just as he reached one of the less mobile vines. It looked like the creature's activity had changed somehow. It had drawn all its vines back, wrapping them around its base. Steve sent a glance up to where Tony and Thor were hovering up above.
“Remember how I said nothing could go wrong with a little walk? Forget that. Seriously forget it. And forget about dates, too, we’re fucking horrible at it.”
Steve stopped, frowning.
“Yes,” Tony said without hesitation, and looked Steve square in the eyes. “JARVIS has been beating him from inside without even knowing it, and I know his matrix can beat Ultron’s. Just without the homicidal glitches. Hopefully.”
"I love you," Steve whispered next to Tony's ear, obliging him anything because he couldn't really refuse him. The hand not pressing at Tony's belly reached up to anchor itself at Tony's shoulder and he nipped hotly on Tony's skin. "So much. I love you so much…"
The idea was almost too much to really register in his brain.
His death would be dreamless, but he wondered if Tony still dreamt himself into the room. If he thought about Steve at all while he was there, or if he was grateful Steve had finally made his exit.
Steve thought for a moment. “As far as I can remember… I never thought you’d want that,” he confessed. “A friendship with me, I mean. I always believed you tolerated me at best, but… I wasn’t sure you actually enjoyed having me around.”
A woman stepped forward. “He had fifteen bleeding incidents as a result of dislocation of the Controller Implant after attachment, but has survived them all,” she said with a flat voice. “His cerebral cortex seems to be adapting well to the controller. We expect him to progress to phase four soon, to begin cognitive testing.”
“Don’t have to,” Steve whispered. “Already living it.”
FRIDAY informed him of Vision now watching him from the Quinjet’s side, but Tony ignored it. With everything else happening right now, he couldn’t afford to think about any of this. He needed to stay focused, and if he agonized about the fact that JARVIS was no more, there was every chance he’d lose his mind.
Tony grabbed his hand and pulled it away. “There’s nothing to tell!”
Somehow, the tone of Tony’s voice had made him shiver. “Changed?”
Tony shrugged. “Stuff happens.” He paused, appraising the man with a pensive eye. “Is that why you still cut him out?”
Bucky just stared at him like Steve must be stupid. "So? Was she hot?"
Tony swallowed. He had no idea why Barnes was entrusting him with any of this highly private information, but…
“Steve—”
“Aw, come on.” Clint grinned cheekily at him, tossing shaggy blond hair out of his eyes. “I’ve survived worse. Do you really think I could just sit at home and let you have all the fun? There wouldn’t be much point in reflooring our sunroom if the world ends before I get it done.”
[New Client2] [chat_server:46956]
After a few endless rings, there was a click, and then silence.
“I’ll be back home doing my nails before you’ll know.”
to be.”
“I thought you’d come,” Tony said without looking up. “You’re too damn stubborn to let it go.”
Pepper scoffed fondly. “You’re not as charming as you think you are.”
The next punches Bucky dished out on him were more forceful and when he grabbed for just another knife, slashing down at him, Steve couldn’t put enough counter pressure on the metal arm before the blade embedded itself right into his upper chest.
—Green?”
“Let me see,” Steve offered, reaching for the zipper at Tony’s back.
Anyways... it's been one hell of a ride for me, writing this story, and I can't emphazise enough how much every comment meant to me. You've all been so supportive and I don't think I could've get this done without your encouragment here and on tumblr, so THANK YOU.
He could almost envision Indries simply standing behind the next corner, waiting for him with a confident smile and a perfectly elegant dress.
How strange it was, thinking that only about one year ago, this would’ve been impossible, and now… there were all these possibilities in their future, and Tony couldn’t wait to reach for every single one of them.
Tony swallowed, trying not to do a happy dance right then and there, because Oh. My. God. That was—he’d never thought there would ever be the chance to get what he wanted. Sure, yes, it was just a theoretical chance, but a chance all the same. Months—
Perhaps it was the thrill of the forbidden. Kissing a straight guy and all. Perhaps it was knowing exactly how wrong it was.
“Don’t wanna be too rough on you.”
With that, he stood up, stumbling a bit as he tried to walk out the room. He could hear Steve follow a second later, and before he reached the door, there were hands gripping his upper arms to the point of pain.
“Uh...”
Tony sighed, and didn’t say anything. What was he supposed to say to that? What Steve was calling 'flesh wounds' had been four broken ribs, one fractured cheekbone, two stab wounds, one graze and two gunshot wounds, as well as a head trauma and severe blood loss, but it wouldn't be of any use to rub that in, now.
He walked to the far end of the diner, sat down at a secluded table and stared at the menu for a while. He hadn’t really decided what to get yet when the waitress came to take his order.
Tony drew in a deep breath and caressed his brow. “Goodnight,” he said, and then, with a much more quiet voice, “And, uh... thank you. Really.”
Tony shook his head. “The kind of man I am today… There’s a darkness in me, and it will never go away again.”
me, Nick, and you have my word—this was the last damn time I was building something for you, SHIELD, or
“A minor one,” Tony reminded him gently. “It’s only a bruise. Don’t worry about it.”
“‘m good,” Tony mumbled at one point, getting a bit impatient as he tugged Steve close.
Which, to be honest, he kind of was.
sign it, he would do everything in his power to keep their family intact.
. What a lovely word for what was happening here.
“Game Over my ass,” he muttered.
An eternity later, Tony’s thumbs were still caressing weightless circles into Steve's damp skin as his lips found his temple. “If I could move my hand I would high-five you,” he murmured, kissing the other side as well. He trailed his mouth across Steve’s face, pressing kisses on his closed eyes, his nose, and his lips.
… He'd recognize the man currently standing at his doorstep from miles away, even though he hadn't seen him in years.
This wasn’t right. He wasn’t supposed to be here.
Familiar pinpricks stung his eyes at the thought. With a heavy sigh, he turned to look down at her sleeping form once more. The gentle cadence of her soft breaths reverberated through the walls with a soft air of peace he envied.
Rhodey’s face broke out into a wide happy smile and he pulled Tony into one of his giant bear-hugs that were secretly Tony’s favorite thing in the world.
“But it’s not about genuine friendship, is it?”
They didn’t get far. Steve made it just around the corner of their bedroom, before he pressed Tony against the next wall. With his foot he made to kick the door to the baby room shut, and Tony only just remembered to close it quietly with an intervening hand.
This might just be the most polite battle in history. Safe only for the Hulk, who really lived up to his ‘Green Rage Monster’ nickname for once with the way he kept the marines busy.
His body was still sweating from the antivirus and his hair was sticking to his forehead. His limbs felt thick and his mind thicker, but he pushed through the veil of exhaustion to do what he had to do.
at some point.”
“Like what?”
thought flew out of the window like a rocket when Steve leaned in even further, a hand settling on Tony’s hip to keep him steady. And then his lips were pressed against Tony’s mouth and that was just…
you’re alright?” Rhodes asked, now looking at Steve as well, though his gaze was much more piercing. The unspoken question of whether or not Steve had done anything to hurt Tony hung in the air, but of course it wouldn’t be voiced while he was still around.
“Do you want something to drink?” Vision asked.
“What’s yours?”
“Steve told us you were an Air Force pilot?” Bruce prompted after a moment. He’d just finished wrapping a bandage around Tony’s shoulder and upper torso and now gave Sam a thankful smile as he cradled the cup of tea between both hands.
Bruce was right. They were worth it.
Tony had been so
“Oh, God. Tony…”
Tony laughed. “Believe me,
"Look at you... " Steve breathed, reaching over to run his fingers along Tony's arms and down his chest. He thumbed the faded scars, his eyes mesmerized by the intricate design of it, chaotic, but somehow still meaningful.
He knew there was no other choice, though. Tony would need to visit the internet hub, find out who their anonymous ally was, and Steve had to stop Ultron from building himself a body with the vibranium he’d stolen from Wakanda. They’d just have to trust that they’d both come out on the other side unhurt.
Rhodes nodded quietly and took the next exit.
With that, Steve headed for the elevators and was not surprised when his move did not inspire an objection. The distance between them at that moment seemed too magnanimous for any further discussions.
Tony’s eyes met Steve’s briefly, and they were red and swollen, his eyelashes wet and his cheeks streaked with blood. He looked as lost as Steve felt—and Steve yearned to hold him, to comfort him the way Tony had once allowed him to do. He would have done anything—
what it was, but it
“But why don’t you just use the Sequencer on me? Send
—at Steve, barely missing by an inch.
“You’ve said that like fifty times. Have I moved?”
“It’s your
They walked towards the bar, saying a few hellos here and there, and Tony spotted Thaddeus Ross and a few senators at a high table, whispering to each other as they passed them.
At least, his angel wings seemed to stay hidden for now.
When Tony didn’t say anything else, Steve cleared his throat. “So, you said something about surprises?”
“I was waiting for the right moment,” Stane replied with a smile.
“Shhh,” Rhodey said. “She just woke up. But…” He grinned a little. “Thanks.”
Three days had gone by, and he still felt it with every fiber of his being. The way his hand had been combing through Steve’s bloodied hair with desperate tenderness. The way Steve’s voice had cracked when he’d asked why Tony hadn’t done more to save them.
Steve sat down beside Bucky and firmly pulled his hands away from his face. “Bucky.” His voice made a point of staying very controlled. “Not. Your. Fault. We’ve been over this. It happened before, it will probably happen again. You’re in safe hands, we have it under control.”
“And how did that work out for you so far?”
“I had strings, but now I’m free… There are no strings on me, no strings on
She laughed without humor. “Not like mine, Steve. I don’t even remember what I thought I’d achieve. What we had…
Steve stumbled a bit as he was pressed against the wall next to the door, but he couldn’t care less now that Tony’s mouth was on his own again.
“I know,” Steve said. “Just hope losing Extremis won’t weigh too heavily on him.”
“I’m old,” Tony replied, but the sorrow was gone from his voice. There was still a note of uncertainty, but Steve was determined to make him forget about their age difference as soon as possible. It didn’t matter to him, not in the slightest, and he’d do everything in his power to make Tony understand.
“The observation of a total eclipse helped Arthur Eddington to do the very first empirical test on—what?”
Something bigger than the death of Indries Stark.
for test-reading this chapter. Your thoughts helped a ton and calmed my nervous mind a little.
. Shouldn’t the man know that flirting like this could get them into real trouble really fast?
“Of losing you,” she said, scoffing as if that was the dumbest question she’d ever heard. “That’s what scared him the most.”
“I’ll bring you to the edge so many times,” Tony went on, “you’ll be crying for more.”
It was incredible, and too hot to bear for too long. Steve could already see the sheen of sweat forming on Tony's back, and the sounds he was making were downright filthy.
“Then you have to stop doing this to him!” Pepper yelled, throwing both hands up in despair. “Steve will never be like Indries! Can’t you accept that? All he wants is to be with you! How can this be so hard?”
“But why now? He didn’t really make a big thing out of Thanksgiving last year. What if he’s fed up with the situation, and thought this was the polite way to go about it.”
Tony nodded with a grateful smile. “Okay. Thanks.”
“You came back to change what happened,” Steve whispered. “And you did. You saved us all. Now you should stop thinking all of it is your responsibility. People mess up. We’ll mess up, too, I’m sure. But we’ll work it out together.”
"That bad, huh…" Bucky seemed to consider for a moment, then sighed. "Alright, sit down, let's talk."
Only more pain.
More happy, for starters.
Tony stared up at him, suddenly curious. “What do you
Steve’s gaze lingered, and he might or might not have squeezed Tony’s gauntlet before raising himself to his feet. “Ready. Tony—”
“For the record, I didn’t want you to come,” Tony replied.
“Steve,” Tony said, loud and firm, and then he was jostling his shoulder.
"So what did I miss?" Steve asked Sam at some point as they were ascending the stairs. He wasn't even sure how long he'd been gone, and now he was feeling a little self conscious about it. Did Nat tell everyone already? Couldn't have, Sam obviously hadn’t known when he came down here, and he wouldn't have bothered to keep it a secret.
Steve quickly dodged him, but he soon realized that the confining hallway would only make things more difficult, so he ran to the kitchen. Bucky didn’t run after him though.
A pause.
Steve gave him a deadpan look. “Let me guess, 6-9-W?”
Tony’s lips twisted into a smile. At least that answered the question of whether or not DUM-E had managed to deliver his message. Good for the bot… probably
“I know,” Tony said—he almost cooed. “I’m gonna suck you again, alright?” He took Steve’s hand in his and with a pointed look, he led him to the large bed.
“Hi,” Tony said softly.
A few days ago, Tony had even ordered him a new tuxedo. And as Steve soon learned, a seamstress with two assistants and unlimited use of the Stark funds could achieve amazing things in just a few hours.
An answer was forming on his lips, taking Steve by surprise. He swallowed it down, and chose the second one that came to mind.
It was noon, and everyone but Bucky and Steve had already assembled in front of Stark Mansion.
Decision making from that point was fast paced. Steve spared himself little room for thinking about anything beyond fighting his way across the Lemurian. He rushed up to the top deck, swinging his shield and simultaneously bringing three men down. The place crawled with all sorts of personnel, most of them were Batroc’s men, but a few were obviously just in it for the money. There wasn’t enough time to make ample selection, though, and Steve figured, in the grand scheme of things, they all deserved at least some headache in the morning. They all, while not fully behind Batroc’s cause, were loyal to the innate chaos the Lemurian Star represented.
Tony raised a brow, and Steve felt a jolt of satisfaction rush through him that he could surprise a man like him. “You’re really something, mystery-man,” Tony said with a far more genuine smile. His eyes raked over Steve’s face, over his hair, down to his shirt. “A bit old-fashioned maybe, but definitely something.”
A wave of childhood nostalgia washed through him as he remembered sunny afternoons spent with his mother in a Brooklyn playground, back in the days. Back when they were happy, when his father had only drank a beer every other week and his mother never coughed. Back when he and Bucky had been everything each of them had. Back when the future was his alone to decide.
Steve’s hands closed around Tony’s upper arms and yanked him forward. The shield clamored to the ground, and the next second, his mouth attacked Tony’s, pouring his confused lust and endless need into him.
here. His eyes were constantly flickering with Extremis’ blackness, his hands twitching at his sides as if he was reaching towards another presence that paced alongside him.
“I love making you incoherent,” Steve said, flashing Tony a quick grin. “You’re always so good with your words, and I’ve… missed this.” He released him completely without warning, his hands finding Tony’s wrists as he turned them around and pressed Tony on the bed so he could look at him.
. He had absolutely no idea what to do now.
They took off as soon as they reached the bridge. Pausing briefly to catch the truck driving in their direction on the street below, Steve readied himself for jumping.
things weren’t that bad after all.
They walked to a clear area of the meadow. Tony rolled up his sleeves, while Steve dropped his jacket to the ground. “We should start off slow,” he called over. “You haven’t done this in a while and you’re still recovering. I’m gonna try to hit you. You block.”
…he’d been an idiot for far too long. He finally needed to take that step, laying himself open and daring to face the consequences, because what Tony had said in 2022 was true.
Tony bristled, staring down on his shoes. “Whatever, man, stop deflecting. I refuse to take Captain Quarterback on our road trip. I call veto. That’s the end of it.”
He couldn’t help himself, really, laughing a bit with how completely and utterly unable he was to regain control over his body. His limbs were numb, and a deep exhaustion had settled over his muscles. He was also pretty sure he was dripping Steve’s spunk on the floor, but some things just couldn’t be helped. “I think you broke me,” he admitted with another chuckle. “I never managed to come without…” He waved a hand at his lower region. “You know.”
“He… tried to attack me. I shut it down before anything too serious could happen. I’ll reboot in offline mode later.”
“He… he hasn’t forgiven me,” he said. “About lying to him. About leaving him. I’m not sure he ever will.”
Tony grinned and even though two of the staff members were walking in and out of the room to prepare the meal, he raised Steve’s hands to his lips and kissed the skin there. “Pepper’s an unusual woman. So it fits her well.”
me, were the world a more just place.”
“Why?”
“Steve, I—”
For an excruciatingly long moment, Natasha stared at him without moving, stared at him with uncertainty plain on her face. Then, she slowly licked her lips and smiled at him. She pressed against him once more, curled in his embrace.
. This was something he wouldn’t be telling anybody.
Steve finished his glass of water quickly before setting it aside too.
Sam blinked, only then realizing what Tony was saying. “Well that’s true, in Riley’s case, mine though… okay, wait. Are you saying
Steve nodded, his whole body shaking. “I know. I… I know.”
The consequences would be the same.
* * *
, believe me, I will stop playing nice with you. Tony was the one who convinced us you were worth talking to. I don’t have any problem taking you out—right now.”
Steve breathed in, deep. “We are…” His eyes drifted past him, as if searching for the right words. Then they locked back onto him. “Tony I… I really don’t want to mess anything up.”
Clint was the first to find his voice, “I can’t believe this.”
Can’t really predict yet when I will be able to post the first CW chapter, but I hope it won’t be too long. Thank you all SO MUCH for reading and commenting and talking to me about the series on Tumblr. <3
“You were a bit of an asshole,” Tony confirmed with a crooked grin. “Will your childhood hero ever forgive you?”
“Still,” Hammer said. “You are making a terrible mistake. A mistake that you will bitterly regret. He will never love you.”
Behind them, Strange made a sound of vague amusement, and Tony would’ve loved to give him a piece of his mind, but Steve’s eyes were big and blue and right in front of him.
Steve frowned. “I’m not sure that’s something to be proud of.”
After a moment’s hesitation, Bucky’s hand wandered to his shoulder, and he moved towards him, pulling Steve into a firm hug. They stood like that for a long, silent moment.
Once asleep, there was usually very little that stirred Steve to consciousness. He had always been a heavy sleeper, and therefore, he found it rather surprising when the sound of a door opening and closing had him instantly alert.
TS 3:08 A.M.>Did u pretend u were fucking me?
His finger was scrolling through the phone’s menu and before he knew what was happening, Tony had already opened its contacts. There was only one number in there, and Tony rolled his eyes when he saw the name.
, a small part of Tony’s mind screamed in protest. That part of him that was still kicking and pounding invisible fists against the walls of his will. No!
Tony needed to figure out into what time period the Eye had dropped him. Maybe he should’ve thought of a specific date when he’d put the necklace on?
Steve’s eyes became soft with tenderness. “Well, who’s the sap now?” he murmured, wrapping his arms around Tony’s neck.
“Oh my God,” Steve breathed, looking back at Tony. “Are you serious?”
When would he finally learn not to keep things to himself?
…” He exhaled, his shoulders rolling back. “I didn’t realize you were
“A week,” Tony corrected himself. “I could stay here for a week.”
The phone was a reminder, an option, a chance, plain and simple. And three months in, Steve’s phone had vibrated in his back pocket. What followed were tensed words, harsh breaths and pointed silence. But eventually, they found a routine. They talked, lightly at first, and it made Steve stare at the ceiling as he took the time to think about the severity of his current situation and bask a little in easy conversation.
Steve shrugged. There was a light stubble on his cheeks by now, and he looked as tired as Steve was able to. “Better, I think. Moving around a bit more. No new panic attacks.”
“I don’t wanna see you hurt,” Tony said softly. “Don’t get me wrong, I’d do anything to get Steve and the others out, but if you attack Ross’ men, I—”
Was this another universe, then? One of the multiverses Strange had talked about so much?
If he ever got the chance.
Watching him go, Tony let himself drop back on the bed. Here he was—back in 2015. And if this didn’t work out, the whole changing-your-future thing, he at least had a few more months before he had to fight against Steve all over again.
“You’ve both been weird since you got back from the mission,” Barnes clarified. “Tomorrow, Steve will come back and… just want to make sure there’s not going to be a problem.”
Steve sighed. He wasn’t exactly ashamed, but it still felt odd to simply put it out there like that. He’d kept it a secret for so long, had never told anyone—not even Bucky—about Tony. And yet, maybe it was time to take that step now.
“So… tomorrow’s the day, huh?” Steve asked after a moment of quiet.
There was a heavy moment of silence between them, only lightened up by Ian’s joyful babbling.
"He's Tony Stark, Steve,” Bruce said, and the sideways glance he gave Steve wasn't very encouraging. “A kid like him wouldn't be normal even if he tried, and you can tell he isn't trying very hard."
“You’re always welcome,” Tony said casually.
Steve huffed a laugh. “Mine, right. Your fault for not getting us undressed first.”
“You think?”
Bucky, obviously not at all impressed with their new bystanders, grabbed for the data chip and rushed past him. Steve barely managed to get Bucky’s human arm into a stranglehold, shaking him back and forth. “Drop it,” he told him, panting, hurting in more ways than one. He yelled again, “Drop it!”
He gave him about ten minutes, then got up himself.
Still. Why was he meddling in things that weren't his business? Because he was worried, sure, but also because he couldn't in clean conscience let Tony go through with his plan without at least trying to stop him. Bruce would never forgive him if something happened, and Steve wasn't keen on getting on the good doctor's bad side.
Tony sighed. “Pep, sweetheart—”
Tony was not impressed. “Really, Steve?”
“I will try to keep my hot temper at bay, sir,” JARVIS supplied.
The memories were so vivid; Steve could feel the vibration under his feet and the crack of Wanda’s magic as it surged towards the building.
“Seriously, Stevie,” Bucky said while he leaned over him. “I know I’m repeating myself, but why do you bother with that madman, again?”
Nebula and Gamora, right. Thanos’
Eventually, they arrived at the first camping sight, and everyone seemed to realize how tired they truly were. Which led to yet another argument about sleeping arrangements.
“This is just getting better, isn’t it?” he asked, chuckling a bit as he slumped against Steve’s chest, trusting him to take his weight for now; letting Steve hold him, because it felt too comfortable resting in his arms not to stay here. His gentle touch was now a safe haven in the aftermath.
“Yeah, sure. Easy’s the word. I train five times a week and the rest of it, I spend in the gym.” He smirked. “And I have to put up with being ogled all the time.”
“If he blows himself up in here, it’ll unleash a mix of deadly fumes upon the city,” Tony reminded them.
Steve cleared his throat. “I said I have to—”
Tony rolled his eyes as his blush deepened. “Get bent.”
* * *
“Yeah? Seems to me half the people I know have turned out to be cunning bastards and we don’t know where anyone stands right now.”
Steve sighed again, clearly trying to reign himself in. “This is a mission. I want you to be as safe as you can, because no matter what you think—you are important to me.”
The look on Steve’s face was indescribable. Anger, guilt, fear and a hundred other things played across his features. “You sure you can do that?” he asked, clearly trying not to sound like he was doubting Bruce’s capability, and failing epically. “I mean… you aren’t a real doctor. You said so yourself. And Tony…”
“The who?”
“Tony?”
Steve huffs indignantly, and points at the ceiling. “Does anyone else find Tony’s sudden absence disquieting?” He shakes his head. “No, there’s something more to this, and I need answers. Are you helping me locate Tony or not?”
– the view of those jeans-clad legs spread apart before him has never been so inviting. Steve quickly pulls his sandal free from his right foot, and pads along the inner areas of Tony’s leg –  the chiselled bumps of his calf, the firm expanse of his thigh. A shiver courses the length of the limb as Steve creeps higher and higher.
“Let me go,” Tony gasps. “Need both hands.”
After the war, SHIELD was founded, and I was recruited. The new HYDRA grew.
He clears half the foyer without event. He ducks low behind an oaken display shelf, and checks the main entrance behind him. No signs of overt break-ins – no broken windows, doors still attached to their hinges. Things are still where he last left them. The blackout in the garage is more extensive than anticipated. Clearly it affects a significant area of the mansion – he can’t see clearly past the archway that connects this foyer to the sitting room. But, there’s still light streaming in from the gardens. Small mercies. He strains his ears for signs of the intruder, and counts to five.
And right on cue, they hear shouting from the compound outside. The words are somewhat garbled, but they’re uttered angrily, impatiently. Someone’s determined to get what they want, and they don’t care about playing nice.
They sit like that in amicable silence for what feels like half an hour. A great feat, since Tony handles the agony that is bleach-on-open-wounds like a champ. Not even a squeak! Steve secures a cotton pad with some tapes and expertly moves on to the next gash.
And he watches Steve be led away by his men. He lingers, but they don’t bother him. They were more cordial with him than before, humouring his questions and accusations with a faint, understanding smile. Nodding at all the right points as he futilely argues for Steve’s exoneration. “We’re not arresting him, we just want to have a word with Captain Rogers.”
But, somebody’s got to deal with the shitstorm.
Just let him be, send an ambulance down his way and he’ll be right as rain. The medic will deal with this… this jet of blood he just projectile vomited when he coughs. The stabbing in his lungs won’t subside.
Too late. The handle slips from his clumsy grip and the blade nicks his index finger in its side. The cut is rather deep, and he chuckles at Steve fumbles for his beeper. “I told you to watch it.”
“I said no, Tony. It doesn’t work this way anymore. You can’t barge in two p.m. on a Wednesday and demand a cease-and-desist
“Or maybe you just want a change in environment?”
the iron into malleable goo. “
a nice elevator,” Tony quips lowly.
The man nods furiously, obviously glad that he’s allowed to leave the circus. One hand clasping his chin, he sprints out of the gym. And both men continue to stare daggers at each other, not moving, not speaking – one half-lying on the floor, the other drawn to full height, until the door slams to a shut.
“Seriously.” Tony nudges Steve by his ankle. “Look at me,” and promptly gives him the largest eyeroll he can manage without permanently having the whites of his eyes stuck on his face. “What do you think this tablet is? The most sophisticated multitouch technology in the world, and you just put it on the floor that smells of burnt faeces.”
“… You have a wild imagination. I’m not under duress, and he’s certainly not holding a gun to my head from his pocket or anything. No, seriously. Steve, come here.”
Tony is lost as Steve engulfs him whole in his mouth. His hand flies to clutch at the top of Steve’s head instinctively, stray strands of hair peeking between his white-knuckled fingers. His back arches into the warmness and slickness of what he thought as forbidden. He can’t stop. He’s gone off the deep end and he doesn’t care if this becomes one of
Some folks at a tech conference many, many years ago speculated if there’s such a thing as an afterlife, and if there is, how does it look like? Is heaven (or hell) a communal compound where all souls hang out together? So… like planet Earth? Boring. Or, do souls own their private cloud that manifests to their whims and fancies? Tony drained his champagne and seeped away because hypothetical situations are one thing, unsubstantiated beliefs are another, and he has no patience for the latter.
“Figures. Breaking into SHIELD’s database is a felony.”
It’s a four hours’ drive back to New York. Four hours trapped. Four hours for Tony to learn who gets to call the shot.
“I saw his face, Tony.” Steve lets Tony go, and goes to sit on the foot of his bed. “It’s him. But, it can’t be. He’s dead. He fell.
“Captain Rogers,” JARVIS begins, “there are two kilograms of C-4 stacked in clusters against a load-bearing wall. Preliminary calculations highly suggest demolition of the western half of the building upon detonation.”
He’s here on a mission. He’s here to work. He thinks what transpired previously is his wake-up call to the possibilities of achieving so much more. He has to
Tony sets his glass on the coffee table and yawns. Money is what makes the world go round. Money is probably the only reason girls keep throwing themselves at him. They never thanked him for his magnificent lovemaking skills, only the wad of cash he stuffs in their bras and panties. Hell, money gave him the best wanking he ever had.
“… I don’t have a Facebook account. Pass me the forks, please? Thanks.”
“We need to get off the road.”
wearing that stupid grin.
“I’m tracking the signal. I need…” Tony’s eyes flicker to the screen, “Three more minutes. Kiss me.”
? That is an option all along?” Steve almost breaks off the turn signal lever as he flicks it up. “Let’s open with that next time.” Not wanting to risk crashing into obstacles, he pulls over by the curb, and thank God for the foresight, because his heart
Tony’s eyes snap back on Steve like a taut rubber band released. The banging on the door increases in force and tempo. It’s just a board of PVC ratting in a stainless-steel frame. Won’t take a Hulk to bust through it. The cubicle walls are built too high up towards the ceiling, so no way Steve could climb and sneak into the adjacent stalls. No way he could walk out the door with a straight face, high-five Clint like a macho motherfucker and let bygone be bygone.
Steve takes the relatively clean spot next to Tony and huddles against the wall. “SHIELD detained all Lemurian Star’s pirates on their premise. Their leader, Georges Batroc said he was contacted by anonymously e-mail and paid by wire transfer. The money was run through seventeen fictitious accounts, the last one going to a holding company registered to one Jacob Veech.”
“Let me touch it up a bit. Fuller lips, a tilt to the eyes…” And Tony flips the tablet so it faces Steve. He swears his insides turn to ice.
“There’s a fucking staple sticking out...”
The top of Tony’s tussled head peeks into view. “Steve?” he whispers, peering into the dark.
“Yeah. The armour techs are guarded by biometrics, so they only respond to me.”
Tony nodded. “Her shadow has been between us all the time. Since the moment we arrived here. And even now… even in death she’s one step ahead of me.”
Steve sighed softly. “Thank you,” he said.
“Какого чёрта?” Barnes shouted.
Steve laughed nervously—
The others were either asleep or actually watching the movie, most of them tangled into another, even Wanda and Vision, who shared a blanket on the far end of the couch, but Steve’s eyes were drawn towards the door. Bucky and Tony stepped into the room—Bucky with a new arm, Tony with a small smile on his face. Immediately, Steve felt a weight lifting from his shoulders, the worry that had been gnawing on his mind for the last half hour dissipating.
Tony pointedly didn’t rush at Steve, and Steve didn’t try to fight him either. Which was good. As long as Ross had his team watching his every move, there was no way to talk to him.
“She didn’t,” Rhodey agreed, then shook his head in confusion. “Don’t even know man, there was beer pong, and then nothing.”
Tony nodded, hating that there’d be radio silence from here on out, but with Ultron controlling basically everything, there was no way around it. He felt Extremis steadily restoring itself, and it was more powerful than ever, but using it would be too much of a risk at this point. He'd have to wait until it was stable enough. “I’ll join you as soon as I can,” he said.
Trace of a smile curling her lips, Natasha petted his head affectionately. “You sure are, sweetie. Just ride it out.”
“Have breakfast with me,” Tony repeated and suddenly grabbed Steve’s hand. And like every time when he touched his skin, warmth flooded Steve’s veins.
Steve let loose a long and exasperated sigh. Tony frowned at him, realizing that Steve was pulling off his jacket and shirt.
, and nothing in the world mattered except for the long awaited feel of Steve’s tongue delving into his mouth.
This was
“Mmm,” Tony hummed. That would explain the bad mood he was in. Talking with Pierce would do that to you.
, he missed those cuddles almost more than everything else.
"I'm glad you like it," he said, smiling back, before tentatively reaching over to touch Tony's hand. "You alright?"
“Must be your irresistible charm and good looks,” Steve deadpanned. He put the blanket around Tony’s body, tucking him in. He kept a hand on Tony’s shoulder for a moment, and couldn’t find the strength to stop himself from rubbing the tense muscles.
“Really? I couldn’t tell. Come on, let’s just get this over with.”
Steve blinked. It was weird to hear Bucky defending Tony, but he was glad he did. And he was right, too. They couldn’t know what was happening in New York right now.
Steve nodded curtly, and took a step further into the room, silently moving in further.
“I really hate aliens,” Tony exclaimed with a groan as he pulled the helmet off and promptly stepped out of the suit. Once he’d done that, it folded in itself, until it wasn’t much larger than a cube. “Jo, be a darling and run Decon-Protocol.”
“Inform me?” Steve asked inelegantly, then looked around once more. “I… Uh, have you seen Mister Stark?”
“What?” Bruce asked with an incredulous tone. For a long second, he stared down at Tony’s abdomen, before glancing back at him with a distinctively more worried expression. “Just try to stay conscious, I’ll get it out.”
“For what it’s worth, I’m glad you’re back,” he said, smiling a very flimsy smile, before he walked around the corner and out of Steve’s sight.
“I’m sorry.” He looked to the hole in the wall next to him. “We need to repay Sam for the damage,” he murmured guiltily.
mother—with his
Ultron’s existence might have been only a few days old, but he had a frighteningly detailed understanding of the order of the universe. He’d analyzed the whole of humankind. He’d dissected how societies had been built as others had fallen. He’d memorized every great catastrophe—and deep within him, in his very core, Tony found the pure need to be feared and worshipped by creatures he deemed of lower status.
Tony stared over his shoulder, annoyed for a moment that he couldn’t even get a minute of quiet. Then, however, he spotted Vision’s red form and realized he hadn’t seen him in days.
It all happened too fast. Rumlow didn’t wait to give Steve a last piece of mind. He activated the bomb and Steve watched with pure horror as it exploded, taking Rumlow with it. The man holding him all but evaporated and there was heat seeping into Steve’s uniform. It burned before it touched him, and he had a nanosecond to think of Ian and of Tony and then—
And that was verbal diarrhoea right there. Great.
Suddenly, Steve leaned in, the hand that still rested on Tony’s shoulder moving forward, encasing Tony’s neck in a warm grip.
Bucky smiled and tightened his arm around her waist. “You sure didn’t use to,” he agreed when the ache subsided. He traced a human finger along her decidedly rosy cheeks.
Tony told Steve softly.
With a deep frown, Steve glanced down at the card. “What is this?” he asked, squinting at the code Tony had written down there.
He knew Tony had taken the brunt force of SHIELD’s downfall, and Steve… Steve had let him. He’d been in a bubble, isolated from the outside world. For weeks, nothing other than Bucky had mattered, and now that he could finally take a breath without the worry bearing down on him, he realized how much he had truly neglected Tony.
Slowly, Tony approached the bed. He sat Steve’s shield down on the floor next to it, cautiously leaning it against the wall, and let his fingers brush over the smooth surface for a moment. It had taken JARVIS about two minutes to track the shield, and even less to retrieve it. It was the fact that fishing the damn shield out of the damn Potomac river was necessary that didn't sit well with Tony. With another long sigh, he sat down and took one of Steve’s hands in his. His skin felt cold, but there was also a healthy pulse beating underneath.
“I don’t understand,” Steve said, because it was the truth. He couldn’t grasp all this. “But you wanted her back, you
When he opened his eyes again, his gaze found Agent Romanoff’s green eyes.
notResponding = 'Not Responding'
Steve saw Tony wincing as he pulled the shirt over his head, no matter how much he tried to hide it. Two days had passed before the doctors had decided to let him go home, with a firm warning against any kind of strenuous activity. And Steve knew what Tony hated most—other than having to spend several nights in the hospital—was that the doctors were right. With Extremis gone, he wasn’t healing faster than the average person anymore, and they both knew it would take a while to get used to that again.
Steve looked at him dumbly and something strong took a hold of his throat.
There was a ‘Big Green’ Hulk-diaper bag hanging over the handle—a gift from Clint—, stuffed with all the paraphernalia necessary for a day out with a two-weeks old baby. Diapers, wipes and various glasses of baby food that FRIDAY had deemed acceptable were laid safely away, along with a few blankies and stuffed toys.
As on instinct, Tony flinched and raised his hands in defense. Except—this wasn’t the Steve from Siberia, the one with blood on his face, his shield raised high, and widened, hurt eyes. This Steve was only sporting pajamas and a very worried expression.
Natasha was watching him with that calm understanding in her eyes that he did not deserve. She sat on the chair next to his bed, her naked feet both deposited on his bed frame.
The sun had narrowed down to an invisible line and almost abruptly, it went completely dark. There was no color. The earth seemed dead.
“Right,” Tony said, his mood immediately brightening. They both plopped down on the bar stools at the kitchen counter, and Steve bounced Ian on his knee. “Well, for one, I’m going to cook you the world’s most amazing Thanksgiving menu. Pepper taught me, and I practiced, and no, you don’t get a say in it. And second, well…” He looked at Ian, pressing a quick kiss on his rosy cheek as he took him out of Steve’s arms. “You wanna show papa?”
What the hell were these things? Why Rome? Why
What the hell was he trying to do?
Tony loved him… he… he truly loved him.
,” he groaned when he felt Tony tighten around him even further. Soon enough, they were straining against each other, mouths open and panting desperately for breath, driving each other relentlessly higher and higher. It went on and on and on until Steve thought he might die.
“We need evac!” Bucky ground into the comm. “Barton—”
Steve frowned. “O-kay?”
“And you really expected me to make the first move just because you wrote me a few sentimental lines?”
“Why did you come here?” he asked when Steve didn’t say anything further.
“And what are you guys planning? Adoption? A surrogate mother?”
When Tony stood up, stretching his arms and kneading the muscles in his neck, he jumped a mile when the room’s speakers suddenly gave off a low beep.
Natasha looked so tired, and she didn’t seem to realize it. Where she got her energy from, he’d never know.
“It might be a chance to talk about… well… the ‘light bulb’.”
“I don’t think—”
He rushed into the bathroom for a few moments, then came back with his ridiculous red and gold Iron Man sweatpants—some gag-gift by Clint, if Tony remembered correctly. He dragged them up over his gorgeous ass and jogged to the elevator.
It wasn’t that he was intentionally avoiding Tony, just… being in the same room with him felt a lot like someone choking him with both hands. He
“How’re you feeling?” Steve asked.
, there wasn’t… he had no idea who I was. He didn’t know me.”
“No kid,” he murmured sleepily, with an unsuccessful attempt to muffle a yawn.
At the end of the day, however, Steve mostly thanked the heavens that Bucky hadn’t been thrown back into his own nightmare… That would’ve been disastrous on top of everything else.
Steve wasn't even looking at Tony, turning to shovel food into his mouth so that he wouldn't spew anything more embarrassing. By the time he swallowed, he'd come up with something a little more refined to add to that. "But just so we're clear, I'm not a big fan of stuffed animals."
Tony snorted, perfectly aware that she was making fun of him and his drug-addled brain. Finishing with the gel, she pulled a pad of white fabric from her med kit and started taping it over his wound. “Bruce did a very good job with pulling the blade out,” she said as she worked. “You’re very lucky he was around.”
Tony’s gaze flickered down, eyes becoming completely black. He sighed, reaching out to Extremis. Now that he was looking for it, he could track four bugs strewn around Steve’s apartment easily enough. He ordered JARVIS to destroy the recordings, then activated the jammer in his phone to block them.
“This coming from the punch line of all your kind? A lecture about ‘accomplishment’? You think you’re extraordinary for letting someone dose you with a chemical mixture? Please. There is a reason you and Stark cling to each other—you’re… the world’s… biggest… JOKES!”
… trusted anymore than I trust you. You’re… selfless, loyal, clever and Peter
Steve still couldn’t believe it was over, and he figured it was better to keep busy for now. If he stopped and allowed the events of the past three days to sink in, he was sure every last bit of rational thought would leave him. If he stopped, he would relive Tony’s agonized cry after he’d recited the Mayday switch over and over again, and that was something he couldn’t do if he didn’t want to break down in front of everyone.
A good couple of hours later, Steve leaned against the wall of the Stark Industries’ Medical waiting room when Pepper came running through the doors, her high heels clicking loudly on the tiles. “Steve!”
“Look, you can’t deny that I was best qualified to do a quick scan of the perimeter. It would’ve taken you
“Don’t you think I know this?” Tony asked, his voice a little louder than he had planned. He rubbed his forehead and sighed. “Sorry. I’m—we’re very grateful. We’ll be on our best behavior, and I’ll tell you how it went, afterwards.”
“It was my fault,” Steve mumbled without even looking up. “I convinced him to come up here. Wanted too much too soon.”
“Right,” the guy said, looking at them. “Sorry!” With that, he left.
“He’s upstairs,” Natasha explained. “Strategizing.”
“For what?” Tony whispered.
“I just… don’t want to be your roadblock. I don’t want to watch you fight something you believe in.”
He just seemed so… above all things, not in an unpleasant way, just… otherworldly, somehow.
“How long have you known about this?” he asked slowly. Careful. Tempering his pace as to not over-exert himself just to make a point.
He only made it three steps before the door to the cellar burst open with such force that it tore from its hinges. A figure jumped out and charged for Steve but it moved too fast for him to see who it was.
Steve sighed, turned around and glanced at the room. “I can leave. But you shouldn’t be here, either. Let me take you home.”
Maria huffed, rolling her eyes at Steve. “Oh, well,” she said. “Let’s just invite all the evils of this world over to watch movies. Anyone got Loki’s telephone number? I hear he’s not much of a talker, these days, but—”
With that thought in mind, Tony surged into the sky.
They’d gone their separate ways again, just like before. For Tony, this wouldn’t make a difference.
Tony took a deep breath, held it, and exhaled. Of course Steve would want to go in alone—the reason was pretty fucking obvious. And the South carrier was closest to the Triskelion, which also meant he’d face the worst opposition. “I don’t mean to put a damper on anything,” Tony said slowly, glancing up at Steve. “But are you aware that everyone aboard those carriers could be HYDRA?”
“What?”
Steve read on top of the screen, and it didn’t take long for him to put two and two together. He knew that date, and during his SHIELD training, he’d read all the reports about Howard’s death. And Maria’s.
“You said we did a lot of damage in your time,” Bruce said. “And I see why we would need to work on that. If we can offer the UN some kind of safety net, I assume they might not push for a lawsuit at all.”
"I did
“This is how you end, Tony,” Ultron said, his voice cruel. “This is peace in my time.”
“I just can’t,” Tony concluded.
Then he spotted a case of sharp metal instruments on a tray beside the operating table; the blade of a scalpel gleaming in the low light.
Tony’s mouth was a thin line, but eventually, he shrugged out of the undersuit, rolling it down to his hips. He sighed, or tried to, what with all the shaking, as he pushed it further down, until he was only sitting there in his boxer briefs.
“And you want to do that by throwing a ball.”
Steve chuckled, and turned his head sideways to look at Tony. “I can’t afford to punch you. Your dad could sue me for my whole college fund.”
Steve must’ve looked as confused as he felt, because instead of maintaining her neutral expression, there was now an amused smile playing with Natasha’s lips.
Steve swallowed—then nodded. “I know it sounds stupid. You married me, after all. Just… you said it yourself… what if this changed how things will play out? What if you—your past ‘you’—reject me?”
Ian gurgled unhappily.
it,” Steve said firmly. “I have a pretty good idea where this is going. That’s why I need to make sure Fury’s on our side. SHIELD might not be what it once was, but I’m sure he can pull some strings in the background.”
“And after you saw me? What then?”
"So you wrote an A.I. all by yourself," he finally said. It was true—he didn't have enough knowledge in technology to be called anything more than average, but he did know that Artificial Intelligence was a seriously advanced field. "That's, uh, impressive."
Tony had been reaching for a bottled water, but his hand dropped when Peter said that. “I’m sorry I pulled you into this. I wouldn’t have done that if I’d had another choice—”
had become, after Siberia… after he’d watched his mom die. After Steve had left. After all of it.
Aside from the one time Steve had mentioned Barnes in a side comment, which had resulted in harsh words and a week of Tony not even looking at the phone, they had managed not to set the minefield ablaze too often.
“You’re…
Another beat moved between them and the electricity in the air was more than palpable. And suddenly, Steve’s hands itched with the urge to touch him, because—oh
Because Tony deserved to know how much he affected Steve, how much love Steve had for him and how happy he was that they'd managed to find each other despite the fumbling beginning.
Bruce nodded. “No progress?”
“I’m… I’m good,” Tony murmured soon after.
me,” Tony said, pointing an accusing finger at the claw, then stepping up next to Steve again.
Steve looked around, to the large SHIELD symbol on the wall, before his eyes landed on Tony once more. His eyes were brown now, brows furrowed as he stared at the monitor. Steve was sure Tony was thinking the same thing he did, and dreading the answer just as much.
All of a sudden, Steve grabbed his wrist and dragged him back. He waited until the group had retreated either upstairs or to one of the outer rooms before flashing a pert smile right in front of the mirror. “Wanna pose?”
Tony crossed his arms sullenly. “He so does.”
Tony shrugged. “If it’s important to you, it’s important to me.”
“Did you get a hold on Bruce and Thor?” Steve asked, leaning forward to where Clint and Natasha were sitting.
Falling for Steve had changed everything. Things he wanted changed. Things he feared changing. The ground beneath his feet was still there, but everything else seemed to be afloat. And sure, they could go on like this, meet occasionally, and maybe they’d even manage to develop this into something more serious, but Tony knew it wouldn’t be the same. It wouldn’t be what he wanted, not when their worlds were so far apart.
Steve took a theatrically deep breath and gazed at Tony with a faux-worried expression. “You know… that bug up your ass must be suffocating. Why don’t you kill it and put it out of its misery?”
“That’s it,” Tony whispered again when they started moving together. The wet suctioning sound that filled the air between them should have made his nose wrinkle in distaste, but it only made the heat in his skin burn hotter. “Go as slow as you need.”
“I could’ve returned the favor,” Steve mumbled, kissing Tony’s lips.
Tony nodded, raising himself to a sitting position. “And?”
“But it’s nice here,” Bucky went on, his voice conversational. “Quiet… peaceful…”
Where they were going to go was a different matter altogether.
— Pablo Picasso
They had, apparently, made it back just in time before the gates opened at last and rain began pouring down on them. And Steve had a feeling that it’d take a whole long time before it’d stop again.
years. Don’t you think we should talk about that? About what that means for us?”
Tony said nothing. His arms tightened around him, but he said nothing.
Suddenly, the sound of footsteps filtered through, followed by arms wrapping around his waist. Steve’s scent enveloped him, and he pulled Tony to his chest as though he was his lifeline, his hands drawing artless patterns of warm affection across his arms.
They talked about both of their lives, about Steve’s mother, and Bucky, and the war. Tony had told him he was some kind of engineer, though Steve had a feeling he was downplaying this a whole lot. He’d also told him that he’d recently lost a family member named Jarvis, but apart from that, he didn’t give much of anything personal away.
For now, though, for a few hours, Tony needed the comfort of sleep. The fight wasn’t over. They still had an enemy to face. But not now.
Barnes snorted. “I know what an AI is,” he interjected and had the audacity to roll his eyes at Tony.
“It’s a lot of fun,” Pepper admitted begrudgingly. “And Stark Mansion was certainly known for them.”
But that wasn’t the real reason. At the end of the day, Tony was a scientist, an inventor.
SR 11:53 P.M.>Just did
And that was the last thing he said, before—out of the blue—zombies and ghosts and horror brides and every goddamn monster out of a horror flick suddenly walked through the hallway.
Slowly, realization began to dawn on him and he confirmed his suspicion when he looked down at his hands. The skin around his fingers was burned, raw and scalded red. And once Tony raised a hand to his own head, there was no single strand of brown hair any more, only more burned skin that surely looked as hideous as it felt.
“Kiss me,” Tony said, tunneling his fingers into his hair, looking almost drunk and beautiful and on the verge of coming.
As he walked down the stairs to the foyer, he was somehow surprised when he first saw Virginia Hogan. She had beautiful red hair and was dressed in fine clothing—but what got to him was her composure. She looked confident and exuded a certain sense of authority. Next to her stood a burly, large man and one that was a little leaner, with dark skin and very kind eyes.
* * *
“God, you have a really nice dick, anyone ever told you that?” Tony asked absentmindedly as he let his fingers trail along the hard length. In times like these, he really wished they could go bareback. Feeling all of that inside him with no barrier whatsoever would surely be an experience in itself.
Before they left the tent, however, Tony yanked him back to kiss his breath away one more time. Steve didn’t find it in him to complain. His soft mouth touched his lips, and Steve closed his eyes and allowed himself to get lost in Tony for a little while longer.
And not something he really wanted himself.
Natasha looked like she was bracing herself for a punch. “Yes.”
“Shhh…” Tony cooed. “You know it’s not possible.”
She cast Rhodey a regretful glance. “And I’m afraid it’s not only a matter of the boat.” There was a significant pause. “We have to follow every lead from here on.”
“You’re more important than Extremis. I keep telling you that. And besides, it’s a failsafe, might not even need it.” He grinned a little. “It’s easy to memorize: I-20-8-Y-4-7-H-6-9-W… I-20-8-YOURS, our wedding date mixed with the song we danced to at the reception, 4-7-HARLEY, your birthday and that terrible obsession with those bikes, and…”
“I know,” Vision agreed, tapping his head. Sure, the lucky guy was still linked to all systems. Damn it, sometimes, he really missed Extremis. “And if you want my opinion, I think they’re sending four because they’re
“Oh baby,” Tony said softly, leaning back a tiny fraction so he could look Steve in the eyes.
Tony felt himself tensing a little as Steve walked closer, but he tried not to let it show. “We all are, as much as we can be. But I… Tony I never wanted it to go this far. I wish we’d had more time to discuss the paper. Everything went so fast. All I could do was react to things that were already happening. There wasn’t a moment to actually think things through, or I would’ve handled it differently.”
Thanks for all the lovely feedback so far <3
He hoped that would be explanation enough as he came to a stop at the stairs. "Now, floor and room number, please, or I'll start knocking on every door."
Tony shook his head. “Probably not, no.”
The fact that Steve had unconsciously been rubbing his dick against him for almost half an hour didn’t exactly make it easier to lie still, but Tony had made the decision to drag this out as long as he could.
“Uh God, you are the worst,” Tony replied. God, he loved that man. It was terrible.
“Complicated,” Steve broke in softly. “I know. We don’t expect miracles… Just keep trying.”
“What,” Steve asked as he leaned against the kitchen counter, mimicking Bucky’s smile instinctively when he saw the amusement on his face.
Thor and his goddamn talk of past lives. He sounded so sure about it, like there was no doubt in this world or the next that reincarnations were real. That what he and Steve had back then, was real…
Their gazes held for a minute longer before Tony turned over on his back, stretching luxuriously. Almost instantly, Steve’s eyes travelled to the skin of Tony’s abdomen where a light patch of hair travelled down into Tony’s jeans.
