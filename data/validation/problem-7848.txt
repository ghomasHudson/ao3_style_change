It closed with a heavy thud, but Tony didn't think about who might have heard or the consequences.
"What. Surely you've been kissed before?"
The new year had come and gone, but the city was held frozen in place. Charlotte waited amidst the small crowd gathered outside of city hall, safely ensconced in the back of her father's Mercedes. The crowds had been gathering every morning since Stefen's arrest, waiting for news and demanding answers from an increasingly anxious police force. No official sentence had been made, but it would have to come soon. The threat of violence was heavy in the air. The city bubbling like a pot of grease which the smallest spark would ignite.
“Well, you’re not wrong. But it wasn’t the parcel I went for.” Stefen pushed away from the door and reached into his jacket without further ado and Tony blinked in surprise.
Received date October 30
~*~~*~
“You’re being a colossal idiot Péter. But if you’re going then I’m going with you.” She declared, sounding too close to resolve for his liking.
“What do you think you're doing?! Do you realize what I-” catching himself Steve bit off the words, and unable to finish the sentence he whirled away from the infuriating monk. His gaze settled on Frau Hogan.
Breathe. Just Breathe.
Had he reopened a wound? Steve wondered, his gut clenching. The cut on his scalp had bled a lot, but then again, all head wounds did at first.
"Yes Sir." Péter snapped back, louder, blinking back frustrated tears.
They dragged him over to the small pen and tied him by the cuff around his wrists, low so the blood wouldn't drain from his appendages while he was unconscious. When they’d finished Magda stepped back and took him in, breathing heavily. When she’d caught her breath back, she knelt down and brushed some of the dirt away from his pale face. She tried hard to be gentle, but even with such a light touch she could feel the swelling and contusions under his skin. He was certainly a poor sight, all bloodied and blue.
“Franz!” Magda let out a sharp guttural exclamation, clamping one hand over her mouth.
“Look after each other.” he finished gruffly, and then he looked over at Tony once more and said, “look after the familia. Ashen Devlesa, Romale.” The quiet words were still landing in Tony’s ears when Bucky broke away from the children and turned to go.
“Stop trying to weasel out of things” Péter egged.
Steve had received similar letters over the past year, but before, it had been simple enough to keep the children behind their peers.
It was Anya Maximoff.
She held out her hands and Steve unclenched his fingers with a whimper, the shotgun falling into her outstretched hands. His legs gave up holding him and he slid to the ground, his teeth chattering despite the buzzing of his nerves.
Steve watched her hesitate before she nodded again, shoving another piece of soggy bread into her mouth.
Herr Shlutz cleared his throat and Steve came back to the conversation.
Accepting his inevitable decent into madness, Tony stood up strait with a quiet groan. He’d banged himself rather good on one of his tumbles, and the steady pain he’d felt in his chest ever since spoke of bruised ribs. Relenting to the inevitable he gestured for Natacha to come help. Her face washed with relief she slid under his arm, careful where she held him as she helped him walk to the door.
“I’ve heard that,” he replied with a sigh of his own. “That’s why I wanted to have a look. Subscription only you say. Is it really as fancy as all that?”
“Oh? How did you meet him then?” She asked innocently, attention on her lunch.
“They’ve already accepted him.” Tony interjected with an air of finality that kicked the legs right out from under Steve. “I sent them an essay he wrote and they’ve offered him a place. He’ll still need to take the exam for the state before he goes, but he’s been accepted. You can’t avoid this.”
It wasn’t a fancy place by any means, and the sailors and seamen who made up the bulk of their clientele could be a rough sort, but Etta and Henrick kept the place neat and didn’t put up with nonsense. The cellar was always warm, well lit, and the smell coming from Etta’s ovens inviting.
What had he missed? His frantic mind tried to piece it together, tried to figure out why Tony was so terrible upset and how to make it better, but he couldn’t think past the loud buzz of panic in his brain and the taunting memory of that old man’s cries and the sight of his bloodied face.
Professor Sieger was pacing around the small apartment, hands clenching fitfully.
Sitting up on the lounge he asked, “You got something on your mind Péter?”
about it.
But he hadn’t done that. Couldn’t, Steve thought, his chest burning, because he’d failed Tony and the children and they’d all been busy fighting for their lives.
There was a long tense moment of silence while Bucky stared into the fire, jaw clenched tight, but finally he turned, his expression resolved.
But Stefen stopped, concerned by the sudden sound of choking coming from Péter who had turned red in the face and was coughing harshly into his hands, Natacha frowning at him as she patted his back to try and knock loose the food that had gotten lodged in his throat.
The guard began to unlock the short chain that was bolted into the wall, sparing him a contemptuous look as he did so.
Dvořák’s lip curled as a swell of dislike shot through him. The goulash rat’s literacy was still positively insulting as far as he was concerned. Golden example of Aryan supremacy indeed. Oh, he could lead a platoon or two, could charge his pretty ass into battle with the boldness of a lion. And perhaps that was the most duplicitous thing about Rogers. Because Dvořák was certain he was a lesser breed entirely.
“Major Rogers, I’d like you to meet Chief Researcher of the Ahnenerbe, Herr Dr. Anton Vonkov,” Göring had crowed, gesturing to the tall mustached man at his side whose physic belonged more to a wrestler in Steve’s opinion than to a researcher.
"How do you know that?” Tony asked and Péter’s eyebrows crawled up incredulously as if to ask if Tony had ever met his father. "Your father wants this day to be very special for you. If you don’t ask him for what you want, then it seems to me you’re only doing both of you a disservice."
So let Captain Rogers have a problem with it if he was going to. Tony had a thing or two to say to him about leaving his children alone at night in a house this big with no one to care for them. He’d wonder what kind of heartless ogre could ignore the fear on their faces, but he doubted Rogers had ever stuck around long enough after supper to witness them.
“No. Nothing like that. We don’t need to discuss this now. There’s plenty of time to think it over.” She chirped, as if everything were happy and gay between them and they’d merely had a disagreement over whether or not the weather would improve.
Steve couldn't keep slipping like this, and it seemed to be happening more and more often. What the hell had he been thinking? But of course he hadn't been. Bucky could just get under his skin sometimes, he'd strangle the bastard if he could imagine life without him. Snickering at him Bucky punched his shoulder, playfully this time, and slung his arm around Steve.
Tony answered, Stefen nodding in that distracted way that told him Stefen was already three steps into a plan and hardly hearing him.
He ran into Hammer not far from the attic steps on his way down to breakfast and felt unease about it most of the morning. Had the Butler just been passing by or lurking about? Pepper had the only key, which she’d given to Tony, so he wasn’t worried Hammer would venture up there while he was away, but he wouldn’t put it past Hammer to listen at keyholes.
“Then help the children,” Virgina insisted and Charlotte held back a flinch. “If the Schrader's offer to take them, promise that the whole family will publicly support Stefen’s execution, they will accept it. I know they will.”
“Did I? Well they are also half their mother, but if I’ve got that story right she was a polished lady who became a war nurse while all her friends were at home clutching their pearls. The kind of woman who has the audacity to find the grubbiest, most ill-bred, of noble fools in His Majesties army and then marry the man against her families wishes, doesn’t sound likely to put up with towers either.” Tony glanced sideways at Stefen, still unsure about bringing up his late wife but other than a minor tensing of his shoulders the captain did not react. His lips did turn upward in a small hint of a smile, though it seemed sad to Tony.
When he looked up at his father there was something close to awe in Péter’s eyes as he asked, “How did you know I wanted one?”
It snowed Thursday, but Friday dawned cold and clear. One of those beautiful winter days full of deceptive that made one hunger for the true warmth of spring; but with the shortest month of the year not quite finished, Tony didn’t think they’d be putting away their winter wardrobes anytime soon.
"Brother Simone says you're to follow me," the freckled face novice who had been sent to wake them said in a low urgent tone, obviously trying to avoid waking or drawing the attention of any of the other bodies lying scattered about the barn. Tony had sat up, meeting Bruce's eyes and taking in the grim expression on the other man’s face before he'd shoved aside the thick wool blankets that had protected them from the damp interior of the barn and gotten up stiffly from the floor, to follow his nameless guide out to the paddock where the sheep were kept. A lonely Brother with a cheerful round face was the only one set to watch them, and he looked thrilled enough at the idea of heading back indoors that he barely glanced at Tony when the novice relieved him of his duties for the morning per the Sub-Prior's orders.
! Charlotte knew the risks. If she wants to hedge her bets playing nice with the Reich, she’s welcome to it, but you and I aint so lucky
“Captain Rogers!” He greeted with a wide grin and the smile that Stefen returned was warm and sincere.
Tony had a million things stored up that he could say to Captain Rogers, but he’d been so angry after their fight that he found himself avoiding Stefen; just to prevent having to yell at him if they happened to make eye contact.
To Tony’s delight, Bucky leapt into a lively rendition of ‘Wien bleibt Wien’.
“Prudentia is often depicted holding a mirror and a snake, because she reflects the best and the worst of what it means to be shrewd. Prudence is the principle of ethical duality within our nature. She has an unbreakable bond with justice, who is blind. They are paired because justice does not aim true without prudence and prudence must always be grounded by the desire for justice. I truly believe that no matter what darkness you encounter in this world Natacha, or within yourself, that your heart will always be called to the side of justice.”
“There are pictures in town.” She stuttered over her words, as if the faster she managed to get them out the less true they might become. “Franz told me that in the city they have pictures of you in the paper even. They call you Enemy Number One.” She swallowed and collected herself. When she spoke again it was slow, finally taking her time with her words. “You don’t look like you used to.”
Tony pinched his chin and stepped out of the moment to face the photographers and wave to them. Steve turned back to them too, wearing a happier smile than he had been before their kiss.
Before he could consider what to say or do to pacify Tony, a loud bang rang through the park. The cameraman twitched and fell into Steve, his camera fell from his grasp and shattered on the ground. It only took Steve a matter of moments to realize the man was missing half of his head.
“Is this him?” Bruce asked, coming around the corner. He peered at Peter curiously.
She dropped her head and heaved shallowly. The world was spinning around her and her heart was becoming heavier with every beat.
Steve wrapped his arms around Tony’s head, lightly shushing him as he rocked.
“I think the honeymoon is the transitioning point,” Tony murmured dryly. “We would have let it sink in several times and in several positions.”
Peter returned the embrace and replied, “The feelings mutual. You're stuck with me, my prince."
The robot nodded and murmured, “I am going to do a fly around. Maybe I’ll come across the Red Skull.”
’ aren't possible…I-I like this feeling…”
“Natalia,” he sighed into her mouth and she caught his breath as she kissed him again.
“Thank you, beloved.”
Yeah, Tony would freak out if anyone so much as whimpers at this point...as it was his anxiety was burning through his blood like acid. The only thing preventing him from having a panic attack was all the adrenaline coursing through him at that moment.
it even if he couldn’t have children with a woman. Captain America was freaking gay. He didn’t know about the Gay Rights Movement, he didn’t know it was no longer illegal, hell, he didn’t know he could adopt kids either!
Against his flesh, Tony murmured, “I know. I will guide you through it.” Tony kissed the side of his jaw then continued to kiss him along the jaw until he reached Steve’s lips. He planted one, sweet kiss upon his lips then looked up to Steve’s eyes. He slowly began to rock his body against Steve’s and promised with a heated voice, “I’m going to make this amazing for you.”
,” Steve groaned his best friend's name like it was a curse.
They both slept uneasy that night.
“You took be by surprise before, that won’t happen again,” Steve growled.
“He is currently helping the 12
“I’m fine, but what about you?” Steve implored. “The last I saw you, you were shot and were not moving.”
“No prob, Cap,” Tony replied with a shrug, not meeting his eyes. He continued, “Look, I am sorry if my hug or warming your hands was awkward. I did not mean anything by it. I know it upset you…”
“The main Jarvis connection to the Mark 42 has been lost…The suit has an emergency beta Jarvis uplink that will take over if Sir becomes comatose,” Jarvis informed them.
Steve smiled sweetly at him, making Tony’s heart ache. It’d been days since he last saw it.
Steve only knew he was sleeping around because Tony would arrive in the dreamscape naked sometimes and apologetically laugh as he imagined up some clothes for himself. Those were the nights Steve knew Tony had fallen asleep with a lover in his bed. Neither of them brought up the subject of Tony’s love life anymore or the near stolen kisses they had almost shared prior to the deaths of Tony’s parents. But it was there, hanging between them and Steve would feel its weight whenever Tony added another notch to his bedpost.
“The temptation to pinch your butt will be so strong,” Wade groaned comically.
She opened the door to James’ cell and wasn’t surprised to see him sitting up and waiting for her. His chains were looser so he could sleep more comfortably but that also meant he was more mobile and likely to attack her.
The Iron Man suit flew into the room and opened up for the older man. Peter recognized it as the more compact model that turned into a suitcase. His Dad’s usual armor was probably too damaged to use from his fight with the Goblin.
Fury tilted his head to the side as he looked them over and then he stated, “Either the two of you got some hair dye and Botox and found a way to teleport here in time to save Spidey or I am dealing with more damn clones? You two are supposed to be on the other side of the solar system right now.
!” The helicopter was falling right on him.
“I thought you weren’t a virgin,” Wade breathlessly teased and pressed the lube into Peter’s hold.
They’ve reached a stalemate and Thor diplomatically let them retain custody of Loki…for now.
"You're with the mechanics' division, Mr...?" Peggy inquired fluidly taking a seat on Steve's other side. Howard went to the other side of the table and sat across from her.
With a serious expression, Tony reached up to cup Steve’s face and he promised, “I’m going to be good to you.”
Steve could not sleep the night before the trial. He lay in his bed as stiff as a board and his eyes wide open and staring at the ceiling. Even with Tony curled into his side, he could not relax. Nerves got the better of him and all the he could think about was all the horrible things that could go wrong.
Steve must have been awakened by his movement because he suddenly ran his fingers through Tony’s hair and sleepily murmured, “Can’t sleep?”
Or was the dreaded darkness of Tony’s waking hours going to be his eternal fate?
The women had regarded them with shock until that moment. The one holding the badges twitched away from Steve when he took his and the other glared at him as if it were his fault. They regarded Steve with suspicion and Steve’s easygoing smile slipped off his face and was replaced by melancholy.
“What is that glow?” Howard asked breathlessly, staring at the arc reactor. The reactor was barely discernible thanks to the stealth flaps around it being partially closed.
With a mock gasp, Wade hissed, “What will it be a soliloquy? Or shall I compose a song about how great you look in this suit?”
slower.
Upon entering the lab, Tony slipped from Steve and fretfully fluttered about. He shooed away Dummy, cleared off the couch, and commanded Jarvis to play some music.
“You clearly don’t,” Peter stated. He put his hand on the doorknob and then jerked it open. The door hit Wade in the back as it opened and Peter shouldered him aside as he went outside.
A man walked through the smoke in a green body suit, with a purple cape, and a…fish bowl on his head?
one that can help you right now.”
The road up to the house was completely uphill and had no sidewalk but he ran on the bike lane instead. No one paid particular attention to him so running there must had been okay.
Steve had been quiet at first, but Tony drew sounds out of the man that made Tony’s own desires curl and his heart quicken.
Steve hesitated and he felt as if Hulk had ripped his heart out as he considered letting go of Tony to save the very woman who had maliciously attacked him.
With his resolve set in, Steve got up and left the tent before he could change his mind.
He closed his eyes and thought back to that night, the heat of Tony’s touch, the weight of his body against his, and the soft press of his lips. Steve bit down on his lips as his cock throbbed for attention whilst he reminisced.
“Shut up,” Peter said, elbowing him embarrassedly. “My dad wants me back by midnight, I have to go back to the Tower soon…”
Pepper sighed heavily and sat beside him on the bench. She whispered fiercely, “Tony you can love. You have the biggest heart I know.” She lightly placed her hand on Tony’s chest, just above where his arc reactor was hidden beneath his dirty shirt, and whispered, “You love him. I can see it in your eyes whenever you look at him and I can see it in your eyes now… You desperately miss him.” She pressed her hand harder into his chest and she stated, “If you keep Steve at arm’s length, he’s going to eventually step back. He’s going to leave you. Do you want that?”
“I’m okay,” Peter whispered, not looking up so he would not have to meet either of their gazes.
No one else was going to attack Venom. Peter was not going to remove it.
May opened the back door and glowered at him as he approached.
machine.
Steve did not seem excited by the photos. In fact, as soon as Tony mentioned them his expression went blank and his hold on Tony lax. Steve’s smile slowly slid off his face and Tony’s grin mirrored the action and disappeared.
“I got it,” Bruce murmured and grabbed the nurse’s cart from the corner of the room. He dragged it over to Tony’s bedside and grabbed the intravenous needle from where it was hanging uselessly and dripping its precious contents onto the floor. As he searched the cart for a cleaning solution, Peter peeked from behind Tony’s torso and watched Bruce work.
Steve sighed heavily and shook his head.
Coulson returned the embrace and murmured, “Sorry, Cap.”
The scientist and cyborg left Tony’s lab as Bruce began to tell her about the chemical make-up he found in the samples.
Tony did not look at him as he stated, “But you kissed him
“You promised to
“Great…” Peter groaned, sinking into one of the seats at the counter.
So, of course, Wade crushed and he crushed
The answer came to him almost immediately.
Tony smirked at his best friend, a man from another century who had healed him in ways he could have never imagined and he could have never envisioned falling in love with. Tony stated, “I think I’ll keep you forever.”
One more chapter to go! I'm excited to write it! :D
Tony turned back around before he could see the answering emotion on the android’s face.
They chuckled under their breaths and Tony picked the towel off the ground and slowly dragged it up Steve's side. Steve stood still as Tony took his time wiping up the moisture from Steve's skin. Tony somehow made drying off alluring with his heated glances and teasing touches. Steve became aroused and Tony, of course, left his cock to dried off last.
Steve are you?”
Tony gave Pepper his best “personally affronted” look and gasped, “What do you mean??”
Steve ripped the syringe from Bucky’s grasp and stabbed it into Bucky’s neck. He pressed down on the stopper and the blue liquid disappeared into Bucky’s throat. Steve frantically prayed he didn’t just kill his best friend as the syringe emptied.
She didn’t care about the danger at that point or the fact that James was referring to their love in the past-tense. She fell to her knees and drew her soulmate into her embrace. He pressed his face into the crook of her neck and did not make a noise and barely shook as he cried onto her shoulder.
May sighed heavily and then put her hand over Wade’s. She murmured, “I don’t know what that man is so upset about. Every time, Peter looks at you he lights up. You clearly are a good influence on him.”
Tony would be dead before Jarvis would be operational again.
Steve licked his lips and reevaluated everything he knew about the man before him. He asked, “Why so long?”
“You amazing genius!!” Steve gasped then kissed him. Tony laughed excitedly and returned the kiss wholeheartedly.
Pepper was in charge of protecting Tony, Steve, and now Peter’s public images. In other words, she was supposed to know anything vital that may draw public attention.
Steve clenched his fists. He wasn’t going to get any answers here and, by the looks of the room, they tried to fool him. These people were not likely going to want to let him go…so he was going to have to let himself out.
Tony led them back into the living room and Peter watched his every movement. He was built like Peter, his body small and sleek but contained well-defined muscles. His hair was dark, like Peter’s, but contained a few grey streaks. He shuffled his feet as he walked with a slight hunch to his back. He stole a fugitive glance at Peter and their eyes met for the briefest of seconds.
Somewhere in the background Steve registers the sound of footsteps. Someone gasps. Multiple someones titter. The footsteps rapidly retreat the way they’d come.
The girl practically swoons.
“She was a spitfire,” Steve adds unnecessarily, and then abruptly doesn’t know where to go from there, has too many different directions.
Steve is the last to leave the conference room, wanting a few minutes of breathing room before he has to face the horde of reporters outside. He’s just pulled himself together when Tony saunters back into the room. He’s looking a little tense around the eyes, has been for the past three days, but still manages to look the perfect blend of put together and artfully disheveled Steve has always envied, just a little. Howard and Bucky had both been the same. It’s not the first time Tony has reminded him of both his father and Bucky, but the comparison still makes Steve’s chest ache.
There’s a pause, then, “Married, sir?”
“Would it make a difference if I said no?”
Tony manages not to bury his face in his hands, realizes only Jarvis can see, and gives in to the urge. “This is a bad idea,” he tells his palms.
Spending more time with Tony at home – and it
“Of course, Ms. Potts, it would be my pleasure,” Jarvis says sincerely.
Steve’s nostrils flare, but all he says is, “I’ll wear one of the suits from the last few weeks, then. I only wore that blue one once.”
“Let’s move,” Ms. Potts suggests, though it sounds more like an order. She suits action to words, and steps smartly around the pair of them, walking purposefully up the carpet towards the entrance.
“I hadn’t planned to upset her. Will the current circumstances… distress her, do you think?”
date. Even if it is with Captain America. Tony rolls his eyes at his internal angsting teenager and gives himself a firm mental shake as he pulls up outside the restaurant. He tosses the keys to the waiting valet, every inch the public face of Tony Stark, and saunters inside like he owns the place.
Pepper holds his gaze for a long moment, then nods decisively. “Tell me if it’s a problem, and I will deal with it.”
“Fuck it,” Tony says again, and makes a beeline for his bedroom.
“Captain Rogers,” Pepper’s still smiling, but it’s not quite as warm as it was for Coulson. Tony maybe shouldn’t still be categorizing her smiles, but he’s never been good at breaking bad habits.
“Jarvis?” Steve asks, only a little hesitant, as the doors slide closed. “Where is – where is everyone? Are they all back?”
“Sorry,” Tony casually silences the alert and pushes back from the table. “It’s just an Avengers thing, carry on. You’ll let me copy your notes later, right, Ms. Potts?”
, then you damn well better show us the same courtesy and trust us with yours.”
“Jarvis?” Steve asks as he steps out of his room again once he’s dressed. “Is Tony in his workshop?” He probably should have said something before – a greeting, if nothing else – but he’s still not entirely used to the AI, and he gets the impression Jarvis isn’t overly fond of him, anyway.
Steve bites back his instinctual response about shirking, about Tony skipping out and leaving everyone else to clean up the mess. He realizes, if he thinks back at all, that for all his studied carelessness, Tony
“Ask Cap?” he suggests. “I don’t know that he’s made all that many friends in the here and now. Guy doesn’t get out much, unless he’s hitting things. He might like it if you, you know, stood up with him.”
Natasha puts her water bottle down with a pointed
Pepper eyes him for a moment, lips pursed, but nods. It’s true enough, at least for a certain value of true. Something else will catch the public eye, something more recent, and in a week, everyone will be fussing over that. Trent can crawl back to whatever hellhole he’d crawled out of sixteen years ago, and Tony can go back to pretending Trent McPherson never existed.
“Why can’t he wear khaki or plaid? Or why do you have to tell him?”
Tony huffs out a breath that might be a laugh, and Steve feels his lips quirk a little in response. “Understatement of the year,” Tony points out, and Steve chuckles, can’t quite help it.
There’s another pause. “I don’t understand,” Jarvis says. “I was given to believe your regard for the Captain was genuine.”
“That’s what they all say,” Tony jokes, but he seems at ease in a way he hasn’t for their other interviews.
Ms. Potts hums. “He should be. I left him with several contracts I need his opinions on, and a few others he doesn’t get an opinion on, but has to sign anyway.” Her smile now is sharp, and Steve is reminded that this is the woman who has kept Tony Stark in line for over a decade, and has won the not-even-grudging respect of both Nicholas Fury and Phil Coulson. “Did your gear need work? Or did you just need to fill Tony in?”
“I say as I find, sir,” Jarvis responds with dignity.
“Pretty sure I was calling him an ass, just last night, after he –”
Steve gives himself a bit of a mental shake, and nods. “Think we can get away with it?” he asks. It sounds so tempting to not have to go sit in a restaurant somewhere and pretend they want to be playing footsie under the table, but he knows their timeline, and he doesn’t think he has the energy right now to sit through being chewed out for messing anything up.
Tony drags his hand out from under Steve’s jacket – where it has somehow wound up at nearly every event they’ve been to – catching briefly at the waist of his pants, and grabs his hand, carefully linking their fingers together. “If you’d excuse us just a moment?” Tony says blithely to the various people clustered around them, and then he’s clearing a path towards the entrance to the hall they’ve all gathered in, towing Steve behind him.
“If they’re calling you out for bank heists, I will personally have words with Director Fury,” Pepper is full-on frowning, now. “The police can handle it, they don’t even need SHIELD, let alone you and the rest of the Bod Squad.”
“Tell me you’re okay with this,” he says, voice soft, and Tony’s embarrassingly grateful that Rhodey’s eyes are on his work as he loops the bow tie around Tony’s neck and carefully knots it.
“We debriefed after you left. I can add your report to the others when you’re done with it.”
“I haven’t really talked to him since the wedding,” Tony mumbles, starts fiddling with the bit of metal again.
“Like a picture,” Natasha says firmly, and Tony’s pretty sure she’s rolling her eyes at Barton as hard as he is. “You blow up a picture to make it bigger. Someone blew up these rats to make them bigger. Expanded them.”
), but Steve does like a challenge.
Steve sets the empty kettle on the back of the stove to cool and turns to look at Tony. He’s getting the feeling there’s something else Tony’s really asking, but he’s still too fuzzy to work it out. “Sometimes,” he says, eventually, carefully. “I guess I haven’t really thought of it like that. Mostly they just make me sad, after, if I can forget the rest of it long enough to think about them.
does.”
“What –” he starts, but Pepper stops him.
“We just wanted to congratulate you both,” one of the women practically purrs, sidling right up into their collective space.
“Oh, no. One of the agents suggested a place to eat. I was going to suggest we go out for dinner.”
“Steve,” Tony starts, stops, tries to remember why he’s here, while Steve’s expression shifts slowly into a scowl at the interruption. Not a great beginning. “There are clothes for you for the interview tomorrow,” he says at last, when no better opening presents itself.
“Who says I didn’t have it planned?” Tony wants to know, smooth like he has a script, then shrugs, as if there was a cue somewhere. “Steve’s not really an ‘excessive plans’ kinda guy. He likes things simple.” Tony squeezes Steve’s knee again, which makes the heat rush back into Steve’s cheeks.
Tony does not seem to have the same trouble figuring out what to do. He steps right up into Steve’s space and brushes a kiss to his cheek before pulling out his own chair and sinking into it, smile firmly in place.
By the time Rhodey takes off after dinner on Thursday, his suit has been completely overhauled, and he’s got the body armor prototypes Tony had gone over with Pepper and Coulson before the wedding. They’ve been tweaked and SHIELD-approved, but the military wants to try them out themselves before they get put into production.
doesn’t mean he hasn’t thought about what he’d do in a relationship with anyone else. He just needs to do with Tony what he would have wanted to do with someone of his own choosing. And it’s been, well, nice, sometimes, to have Tony pressed up against him, his warmth close and comforting. And the times Tony has kissed him have been more than nice.
anything, and Steve’s somehow all up in arms about it. It has been a while – which in and of itself is pretty amazing, especially given how much time they’ve been spending together lately – so maybe they’re due. Maybe it’s just built up pressure. But Tony finally tunes in to Steve snarling something about showing off again, and his own irritation with everything starts to boil.
“Aren’t you used to the press?” there’s a hint of a confused frown in Ms. Potts’s voice, but Steve can’t quite see her face from this angle, and he doesn’t want to look away from Tony, doesn’t want to break that focus that keeps the flashes and yelling faces firmly in his peripheral vision.
. “It’s really. It was good of you. Thank you.”
There are five bright points of heat where Steve’s fingertips are still pressed to skin, just below the rolled up sleeve of Tony’s shirt, and Tony
A server appears almost before Steve is fully in his chair, two bottles of wine in hand. “Red or white to start this evening, Mr. Stark?”
Tony frowns, rolls his water bottle between his palms. “So that’s why he came to babble some unnecessary apology at me for yelling in public again? He thinks I’m about to keel over at the first big hit?”
“Don’t,” he cuts her off before she can say anything. “Top of my list of things I don’t need you telling me about is Steve
After several minutes of basking, Steve feels significantly less destructive. He dresses quickly and heads out for a run, following the already familiar route up to Central Park. The steady rhythm of the run helps as much as the sunshine and the view of the city, and by the time he returns to the penthouse, armed with breakfast, he feels much better, and ready to deal with whatever the day plans on throwing at him.
Pepper sighs. “I know it’s not romantic now, and the marriage is only going to be real in the legal sense, but for all intents and purposes you two will be dating for the foreseeable future. At the very least, you will have to learn to get along when you’re not actively fighting a common enemy. Who knows where else things might go?”
And Tony. He doesn’t know how to answer that.
“So what’s this?” Steve asks. The papers don’t make much sense.
“Is that it?” Rhodes sounds surprised.
For a long moment, Tony stares after him, then pours himself a cup of coffee and stares at that. He’s not entirely sure he knows what just happened.
. I’ve already wasted enough time hunting your Americano-drinking ass down.” He gives Steve another significant sort of look, turns away, then back again. “Oh, and Cap?”
“Natasha was supposed to explain this to me?”
Maybe then he should take his own advice and share his own secrets, some snide little voice in the back of his mind chided and Tony pushed that too away.
“You’re only sayen it. You don’t really know.” Clint grumbled. He pulled up his robe as if he were going to stuff the gun down his drawers and Tony waylaid him with a firm hand against his chest and a shake of his head.
It was a parade like none he’d ever seen. So many important people had come down to see the men off - the minister of propaganda himself, accompanied by the newly appointed Admirals and the Commander of the Wehrmacht.
“Yes, I caught that. You don’t want to miss anybody. I don’t either, so we just won’t.”
"What is this?"  he asked Bruce, who was standing over the bucket, and consequently over him, with an all too familiar sort of expression that Tony's twenty years at St. Péter's had taught him precluded some sort of chore.
With love,
Natacha jerked. She’d been so enraptured in what was going on below that she hadn’t even realized the nursery door had opened and her younger sisters were standing not far behind her. The shouting must have woken them up. No doubt the boys were awake too, huddled in their beds while they pretended none of it was happening.
The mission. Steve straightened his spine and dragged his head up to count the sleeping bodies within the room. Five. Tony, the only one who might have good reason to be up and wandering about this early was still sleeping to his right, his face a hands width from Steve’s thigh. Natacha was the one missing he realized after accounting for James alone in the bed.
“Can’t, or won’t?” Tony asked. Her eyes narrowed and her grip tightened on his arm.
Tree bark would give them essential vitamins, Tony mused, setting the glass jar of sauerkraut back on the shelf. Artur wasn’t going to be happy, but all of the children would have to start drinking a few cups each morning. As for the rest, it was getting warmer each day now that spring was on the doorstep. Soon the snows would start to melt, and they could forage for other things and set up traps for small game.
Charlotte chuckled, a sound more genuine than any he’d heard come from her all day while they’d been in the public. It made him smile.
It was designed like the tower buildings Tony had only heard about in America. Bruce thought the idea of them was gaudy and strange, but Tony understood the appeal and the potential of such a design.
“The children… are sleeping?” he repeated slowly as if he couldn’t believe he’d heard the words right. “Well ain’t that just the sweetest thing I’ve ever heard.”
“No Tacha-”
“I just want to help.” Steve flinched away from her.
"They’ve been retching all morning. They’re likely contagious if they both fell ill so quickly. No one must go near them, clearly, but still somebody must. Virginia can’t afford to be down anymore staff. So I suppose that leaves playing nurse to me." she answered, sounding very proper and grown up.  It startled him, how much like Peggy she’d just sounded. It was like he'd just walked into the kitchen three years in the past, to find his wife sipping her morning tea and taking the rare moment to rest her feet while she chatted with the cook.
“Of course. I'll wake you for dinner, Captain.”
"So stop wallowing." She admonished, her eyes flicking back to him and holding until the tension slowly unwound in Péter's chest. "We need to prepare for what's coming." She was right, and more astoundingly she wasn't blaming him either.
Natacha was in the kitchen with Maria and Artur when they entered, their faces still carrying hints of the fear that sprang up anytime someone approached the cabin, even when Tony was out and expected to come back. Artur was sat on the table next to the window, obviously playing lookout while Maria helped Natacha mix the wood ash with the animal fat in the bucket, attempting to make their first batch of much needed soap. It looked a mess and smelled worse, but Tony gave her an encouraging smile. It only took a glance across the room to confirm that James was on the bed sitting with Sara and the radio.
"Captain Adventure looks familiar," Bucky replied picking up one of the drawings to examine closer. Steve furrowed his brow, considering the artwork once more with new perspective. It took him a moment to realize, and when he did he felt a strange tingle of embarrassment. Even though there was nothing to be embarrassed for.
Tony was smart. He wouldn’t have stood still when the riots started. The Hall was large, lots of exits. Where would he go? What was behind the Behringer?? Steve searched his memory. There where shops just behind. A few Jewish businesses still remained. They’d have been targeted too. Tony would avoid them. There was some sort of public park… No, too open they’d be sitting ducks. Then where damn it!
“Your letters. You kept mentioning your friend’s pictures. I thought this way you might have some of your own.”
“No. I’m deciding what to do and it’s...making me sad.” He sighed.
Now what the hell was he going to say to them?! Bucky felt something startlingly close to panic build within him until a voice shattered the silence.
The soldier had been coming up behind Bucky whose back had been turned. Steve barely remembered pulling the trigger but he remembered the soldier tipping over the edge of the mountain, splitting open on the ground below.
"So you're German? Uncle Bucky said-"
“Hey Ginger, wait a moment.” She heard Bucky call after her and halted, turning to see him leaning against her father’s automobile. He was regarding her with a strange intensity, something grim and dark behind his eyes that made her think wildly that he must know. He must have guessed somehow what she was thinking about doing to Tony.
“She’s doing her rounds, but if you can pay for the time, I’ll send her out when she’s done with the rooms on the west floor.”
“Yes, yes. All these years Antony, all these years I have prayed and today God has answered my prayers.” She cried into his ear and Tony felt moisture slide down his cheeks. “That man, that wicked man told us you had gone away and wanted nothing to do with us. He is a devil. He would not even let me stand at my baby’s grave.”
Tony nearly jumped out of his skin. He stifled a curse as the jerking of his hands jammed the needle, effectively ruining the seam he’d been working on.
“No, Beams has gotten the closest I’ve heard of, but you can bet there are plenty of other scientists who are trying.”
Despite the dark blood covering the figure and his agonized groan of pain, the soldiers were brusque as they unceremoniously dumped him upon the nearest available bed. As the remaining doctors rushed to his bedside like flies the soldiers barked frantic orders for Wolfe to follow them. There was a prisoner revolt breaking out in the yard.
“I’ve a letter for you from an old friend. May I?”
Bucky was certain Steve barely remembered last night. He supposed that was worse in a way.
James still watched her expectantly when he thought no one was looking, whenever there was music.
“Can you come?” he asked, almost meekly, blinking up at Tony with hopeful blue eyes, and Tony squirmed, sudden heat twisting uncomfortably in his stomach.
Don’t fall. You’ll never get back up again.
"Frauline Werner could not find an envelope this afternoon and was forced to fetch one from your drawers. She was certain you would not mind."
“Before you even say it, you can’t lock him up.” Tony drawled and Steve glared at him. Tony continued, “He’s nearly fifteen Stefen. Older than you were when you went to war. Did anyone ordering you not to go stop you?”
It was a shame, he thought, reaching for the washroom cloth and wiping away at the mess of sweat and cum on his skin.
The rest of the house wasn't quite so cheerful. Da was still upset from the fight he'd had with Uncle Bucky, and Tony was tense and worried even though he smiled at them and told them he was sure everything would be fine. He was lying for their sake, and Ian knew better but he pretended like he believed him anyway because his younger siblings needed it.
“Clinton is resourceful and far more practiced at this sort of thing than you Tony. The boy has led a harder life than you know.” Farkas insisted quietly, and Tony heard what he didn’t outright say. Clint was a child of the street who had learned to fight in order to survive. Not a pampered idealist playing at heroism like Tony.
"Right, alright, right." He rubbed his free hand over his mouth. His eyes were stinging, and probably too wide. He knew he looked and sounded like a crazy man right now, but this was big.
Stefen looked like he couldn't decide whether to be concerned or perplexed by this and Tony chuckled. He tucked Sara's toes under the hem of her night gown and leaned down to kiss the head of her bear.
The sled turned, and then tilted sliding at an angle in a spray of white before turning over completely and dumping Ian over the side. He’d tumbled a few more feet, rolling and sliding down down down, until he finally stopped. Right at the edge of the ridge.
“Sir, I have express orders to take you straight to the general, Sir.” The corporal answered nervously.
Péter shot toward him and they collided like waves, Tony rocking as his shaking legs threatened to buckle under him, but he held on. Péter clutched to him with stifling force, his camera digging into Tony’s back as he pressed his face against Tony’s chest, body shuddering. He was crying, Tony noticed through his own tear-filled eyes. Silent tears clung to Péter’s dark lashes and leaked out of the corner of his eyes, smudging his cheeks.
“Right, because you can do anything, all on your own. Even stop a war.”
Bucky didn’t know how the hell she could know that since she’d been with them all evening and even he had lost track of Stefen’s movements, but he didn’t doubt her. But just what the hell was Stefen doing in the damned garden, when they had a rebellion to organize anyway?
There was a sound behind him, like the creak and swish of doors opening and Ian turned. Uncle Bucky nodded at him from where he’d appeared on the veranda, hands shoved into his pockets and shoulders hunched. Father was there too, trotting down the steps at a pace that while not charging was definitely the sort that meant they should go to him right away. Not that any of them needed much encouragement for that.
“They believe so. The rebels were pursued. Both parties crashed, and there are no known survivors.” Khalmmer recounted slowly and the bottom fell out of Steve’s stomach. “Frankly the fires from the crash ran so hot they can’t confirm whether which of the bodies they found belong to the traitors and which belong to our men. It’s an unpleasant situation….” Khalmmer trailed off, concern flickering over his face as he took in the way blood had drained from Steve’s face and the tight grip he had on his glass.
“Can I see it?” Stefen asked, and Coulson rose from his chair, crossing the distance between it and the bed in a few short strides.
Had he been attacked by someone? Had he been walking like this for days with his wrists shackled?
“Herr Stark, a word please!”
Tony kept a watchful eye on them while the captain and Bakhuizen went to gather more wood to get them through the night. By some miracle clothes were folded and set aside for morning, teeth were cleaned, and seven bodies secured under sleeping rolls by the time that Stefen and Bakhuizen returned to feed the fire.
Steve opened his eyes, cold creeping into his lungs. Not the bucket then. So be it.
Margrit Rogers, the one and only. The only person according to...well everyone, that Captain Rogers had ever loved.  And yet, there was no trace of her anywhere save a few trinkets and a pistol because Stefen couldn’t even bear to think of her, let alone say her name.
“The sun is rising,” Stefen disputed not looking up from his work and Bucky glanced out over the lake taking in the pink and gold splash on the water and sighing.
“So your father was the best, but I thought you were a monk… so how do you know you are?” James countered and normally Tony would take all sorts of offense to that (and his smile did go a bit brittle around the edges he had to admit) but he couldn’t deny the open curiosity in James voice, and he didn’t want to ruin what progress he’d made by snapping at the boy and taking out all his issues on him.
“Struck down by fever barely six months after she’d had Sara. We were devastated.”
And there it was, the very reason that Tony had stepped into this Nazi officer’s home in the first place. Steve’s desire to send his children abroad was Tony’s ticket to freedom, and yet the captain’s foreboding silence on the subject did not inspire the fear it should have; at least not for himself.
Dvorak's own stomach gave a small empathetic lurch at the sound of retching and he clamped his hands behind his back, gritting his teeth as he waited patiently for the episode to end.
Pop survey:
“You drew all this up from memory?” Stefen asked slowly, astounded. Tony had taken a single look at a file and been able to recall all of
The hall was destroyed, just as he’d feared. Windows busted and pouring out thick black smoke, devoid of any signs of life. Splintered furniture and broken instruments lay strewn about. Glass from the windows covered the ground like a bed of snow.
Natacha felt the returning itch of tears and closed her eyes. She leaned against him and let him hug her again, finally allowing herself to sink into the warmth he radiated without reservation.
“You’re what?!” Bucky gaped at the man. “Does Stefen know?”
Tony watched as the two traded places, and Péter began untangling the coils of rope they'd brought with them. Péter looked tired, and Tony was glad that he seemed to know his own limits and wasn’t letting a thing like pride keep him from taking a break when he needed it. Péter was filling out more, but his body wasn't used to manual labor. Ian on the other hand had spent more time building up his physic, what with all those morning drills.
Too soon, the hour approached when it was time for the infamous Rogers Family Singers to take to the stage and finish out the evening’s entertainment, and Tony went around the room, rounding them up. He’d found them all except Péter who had disappeared entirely from the ballroom. The hair on the back of Tony’s neck raised in alarm but he fought down the urge to panic. It was a large house and Péter could have slipped off to any number of places for a moment of privacy. Best not to sound the alarm until he’d searched the most likely options.
And they were taking it from the Jews.
Not for the first time, he cursed the size of the house and the thickness of the walls that prevented him from hearing the sound of approaching vehicles. If Bucky were there it would have been better. One of them could keep watch outside while the other defended the interior. Not having Bucky at a time like this was like missing a limb.
“I can go to the parade with you. If you want.” Peter looked up from his work, brown eyes soft with sorrow and heavy with guilt. He was talking about more than the parade.
) and hand her over to Ian so he could shove at it with his shoulder.
Down below him the work-band began its warbled morning tune. Rising high in the air and bouncing off of the stone walls, it was no less beautiful for how weary it sounded. Even with Fiedor’s endless stare pinning him to his rack it was that sound, that tune, that raised the hair on the back of Steve’s neck. Steve shifted on his rack, his restraint rubbing against raw skin as he rolled onto his side. He sucked in a pain filled breath as the stitches from the incisions pulled at his side.
Ian wasn't sure what had set him off this morning. Tony had only told him once more that he had to get ready for the parade.
Enough was enough.
“Johann picks on him.” Ian announced into the silence, deliberately ignoring the hot warning glare Natacha shot him. “If something happened, I think he would be too embarrassed to admit it.”
"You've been through so much, the last few months. I'm sorry I didn’t shield you the way I should have... and that I've not been a better father to you." Steve looked at his children, forcing himself to look each one in the eye. He had been to war, seen death, even faced the prospect of losing his best friend and his lover on the same day, but this still felt like the most difficult thing he'd ever done.
“Come on. Hurry.”
Get them out.
Gritting his teeth, Steve got up and stumbled toward the toilet stepping over the sleeping forms of his comrades. The water closet was barely big enough to fit him. Ducking his head through the narrow door he was already bumping elbows with the wall. The tight space didn’t stop him from nearly ripping open his trousers and taking himself in hand.
"But until then, I've got a project for us." Tony decided. James, who had been leaning against his shoulder, lost his balance and fell to the bed when Tony stood suddenly and he didn't look very happy about it. His tone was petulant enough to curdle milk as he grumbled, "But what about the news?"
Artur snorted loudly and then coughed as he choked on a mouthful of ice-cream. The others couldn’t help but laugh at the sound, but Tony became concerned when Artur continued to cough, his face screwing up with discomfort. Tony reached for him to begin patting his back, anxious that perhaps a piece of his cone had become lodged in his throat.
He and the little one, Maria.
And so it seemed that despite everything, the vaunted Captain Rogers invited the Hitler Youth into his home, as eager to indoctrinate his children into the German war machine as any other loyal fascist.  It made Tony sick to think about, which even he could admit was ironic given his first impressions of the children when he’d met them. They’d marched like mini gestapo he recalled again with a wince, but that had been uncharitable. They were only children: bright ones at that, with good hearts despite growing up in a world that was telling them that cruelty was their right.
Tony looks as baffled as he always does when Steve asks questions about his work, but answers gamely enough. “No, nothing new, just some specs for the new phone SI wants to release in a couple months. R&D was having some trouble with the new battery integration, so I said I’d check it out.”
his mother had called them.
The look on Rhodes’s face is a little odd, and Steve doesn’t know him well enough to hazard a guess at what it might mean. “This is about par for the course with people he likes,” he says eventually. “You just need to remember he usually does things for a reason.”
As it turns out, the things he would rather pack himself don’t even fill a duffle bag. He zips the bag closed anyway. No point in weighing it down with other things.
would support the denial of anyone’s basic rights makes him nauseous. He’d been so thrilled earlier, watching videos from Chicago, and even while he’d been doing that, people had been claiming he was morally opposed to the very thing those videos had been celebrating.
Steve could feel someone watching him before he even opened his eyes. He kept motionless, every nerve alert and ready to defend himself. Ready for pain. Eyes watching, always watching. Eyes from the tower surrounded in barbed wire rifles at the ready. Eyes reporting. Dissecting. He was always watched.
“Sir.” The lieutenant amended.
Steve didn’t think he’d ever be ready to.
“I...what?” Péter stuttered, almost falling off his perch on the step. “When?”
“What the hell-” he began, but Tony cut him off, as he and the others more ran than walked through the opening gates as soon as there was space for them to do so.
That won a small smile from her, but she did not speak for a long time. Tony didn’t mind the quiet because he could tell she was considering all that he’d said. He gave her arm a comforting squeeze, quietly adding, “Don’t give up hope, Bambina. Bucky may find his way back to us yet.”
Tony had never forgiven him for that. Not the preventing him from throwing away his life on a forgotten battlefield thing. Tony would never forgive Hughard for taking away his home.
Tony tensed as she reached out to grasp Natacha by the chin, the grip appearing gentle but no less firm for it.
Steve watches for a moment, then gives himself a firm mental shake and goes to collect the things he doesn’t want random SHIELD agents prodding through.
“People aren’t usually this interested in me,” Steve tries to explain, and it’s true, most of the Avengers fade into the background when the press comes calling. Tony’s always the one front and center, even if they’re all attending an event like this. Steve is just starting to get a taste of what it’s really like, and it’s already making his head spin. He should maybe be a bit less quick to jump on Tony for slacking when he shows up late to clean up or debrief because he’s been handling the reporters.
“I know all of this,” Tony reminds him. “I’m pretty sure I’ve said all of this to you.”
Gently, Steve twists his wrist in Tony’s grip until they’re holding hands.
The way Natasha has been looking secretly pleased every time Steve tosses an arm around Tony’s shoulders on the couch when they’re watching movies, or when she sees Steve following Tony down to the workshop, makes Tony a little uneasy, and the speculative looks he’s gotten from Coulson and Barton have him wondering if there’s some kind of SHIELD betting pool that Steve’s in on, but no one bothered to mention to Tony. He’s not exactly sure what they’d be betting
She rolls her eyes, and elbows him off.
“What are you doing?” he asks as softly as he can, twitching again as Tony’s palm curves over his hip. There are people everywhere, and he’s pretty sure they can all see where Tony’s hand is.
Startled, Tony stiffens, then lets himself relax into it. There’s definitely something different about Steve, and just because Tony can’t put his finger on what it is, exactly, doesn’t mean he can’t enjoy it. Even if it
War Machine drops Clint into a tree, which seems as good a perch as any. Banner vanishes somewhere, possibly to try herding fleeing locals to safety until SHIELD can muster out. The two armors take to circling, using repulsor beams to take the giant birds out, or at least keep them contained. The jet remains aloft, and Natasha joins the effort to keep the birds in the park.
“Leave it, Cap,” Natasha says, quick like she’s cutting Steve off before he can speak.
“Just do what I usually do, then?” Tony asks.
“Fucking
. Tony should be breaking out in hives right now. He refuses to examine why he’s not.
Steve opens his mouth, ready to tell Tony he’ll thank him when he’s done something to be thanked for, not when he could have let untold numbers of giant, raging birds loose on New York because he had to come showboat all over the place when Steve was
,” Tony says shortly. He turns away, goes to sort through the cufflink options Pepper left out for him. “I was nineteen, and you promised never to bring it up again.”
“No,” she hands another pen to Steve. “The places you need to sign are all marked,” she tells him. “Do you need us to go over anything?”
“You enjoyed yourselves?” Mr. Cooper asks, and he’s grinning, raises an eyebrow in Steve’s direction, and Steve realizes how hot his face is.
If Tony had been worried about Nebula getting along with the Survivors – which he hadn’t been, but if he had – he wouldn’t have needed to. The raccoon – Thor calls him Rabbit? – makes a few snide remarks, but that seems to be his default. Everyone else is more than ready to welcome anyone still alive with open arms, and Thor, in particular, seems to put her at ease. They wander off together at some point to talk. Something about Nebula’s sister, and crazy homicidal family members. Tony’s not sure. Next to Thanos and Hela, Tony’s family looks positively ideal. He’d throw Loki in with the crazies, but it sounds like the jury’s out on him. He’s missed a lot.
About half an hour in, they pause for a water break.
Steve shrugs, looks away again. “I wasn’t always good for much, either.”
Natasha snorts, but doesn’t dispute it.
Steve gives her a wry smile. “Ma’am.” He nods at the other agents as they stand. “Thank you for waiting.” Most of them are trying to suppress grins, and Steve appreciates that they did wait, instead of just waltzing into his apartment without him. He holds no delusions that his otherwise-secure home is locked to SHIELD.
“I don’t see how this is new,” Clint remarks. “Stark and Cap have been butting heads for the last year, and it hasn’t made any difference when it comes time to get the job done. Why does anyone care now?”
, even if he doesn’t always respond in the moment. Like with the charcoal.
It’s more and less than Tony thought Steve would know, at this point. It’s not like he ever talks about Obie or Trent if he can help it, but with Obie, at least, he thought Steve would have had a more thorough briefing from SHIELD. “As per usual,” Tony tells him as coldly as he can manage, “you’ve latched on to information you think is complete, and run with it. That may have been the way to do things in ye olden days, but we like to use our brains, now.”
“Yeah, well, it’s a nice couch,” Steve says, and feels that warmth again when Tony’s lips quirk into a grin. He untangles their feet and pushes up to stand. “I’m going to take advantage and try to get some sleep,” he says. “You should maybe think about doing the same?”
“Don’t I?” it’s not really a question. “I may not know everything – heaven forbid
Tony shrugs. “J?”
If Ms. Potts and Tony
Ms. Potts takes the folder, but doesn’t open it. “Given Tony’s track record and Captain Rogers’s reputation – sorry, Captain – it would seem like a good idea to keep things private, even after an engagement. It would make sense not to publicize it and have it destroyed by the media.” She looks at Tony, who shrugs, and she goes on, though her voice tightens. “Trent McPherson is a perfect example of why relationships don’t need to be flaunted about, not only while he was actively in Tony’s life, but immediately following, and everything that’s been going on lately.”
He pulls around the side of the building to park his bike, throws the kickstand, and heads back out to the sidewalk, taking a deep breath and letting it out again slowly before rounding the corner.
Coulson’s pause is as full of judgment as Jarvis’s. “As soon as possible, Captain,” he says, voice extra bland.
Steve can’t miss the threat in her words, and he’s not sure what exactly she thinks he’s going to do – or what he even
It’s the work of only a few minutes to find a niche that’s only partially blocked from view. It should be awkward, Steve thinks, but Tony pulls him in close, and one moment they’re standing there, frozen, Tony watching something over Steve’s shoulder, and then he’s breathing out, “Vultures are like clockwork,” and the next moment they’re kissing. Really kissing. Steve had thought they’d been kissing for the cameras for months now, but this. He’s never kissed someone like this outside of a bedroom, before. This is teeth and tongue and ruined hair and scant inches from public indecency.
The sound of a door slamming down the hall coincides with the loud gurgle of the coffee machine turning itself on. Clint jerks away from it, curling almost protectively around the remainder of his breakfast.
Pepper touches his arm lightly. Tony’s pretty sure that’s cheating.
Steve blinks, already caught in staring around. “Thank you,” he says automatically, and steps out into what appears to be the living room.
Mr. Cooper grins. “What did you do for Valentine’s?” he asks.
“On whatever happened on your mission.” Ms. Potts makes a face as she says it. Steve tries not to smile.
Steve plays with the patchwork quilt spread under him, tracing shapes with just the tips of his fingers. It’s distracting, the way his fingers move across the fabric. Tony can see the threads catching at his skin, wonders if the roughness is just from calluses or something else, wants to reach out and touch, find out for himself.
“You’re dangerous,” Tony tells him, can’t quite keep the admiration out of his tone.
There’s a noise from the doorway – a throat being cleared – and both men turn to see Pepper standing just inside the room. “Much as I hate to break up this touching display of manly affection,” she says, dry as dust, “it’s time to go.”
“Yes, of course,” Steve nods, sees the out for what it is, notes how naturally Tony pulled it off, wonders what he would have done if Steve had done more than just tense up. “Scotch on the rocks?”
Tony shakes his head at both of them. “I’m glad you’re not evil, Pepper-pot,” he tells her. “We’d all be doomed.”
with this deal.”
“With Captain Rogers, sir?”
“End of the week, I’d say.”
Steve has no recollection of any particular woman, just the usual blurred parade of flashy dresses, sparkling gems, and too much skin. Nothing like the women he knew, even the USO showgirls. He can’t even place any blondes from the evening, has mostly steered clear of them since Peggy tried to shoot him over Private Lorraine, which might not be fair, but still. “I prefer brunettes,” is what he says, like that has any relevance outside of his own head, but then Tony’s cocking his head at him, eyes narrowed like he’s trying to figure something out.
“And if I ask Captain Rogers?”
Tony can’t help but grin as Natasha half sings back, “Widow clear.”
Tony can’t help an incredulous snort, and Pepper’s nostrils flare like she’s ready to yell, but she takes a deep breath and when she speaks, it’s clearly not him she’s angry with.
to Steve.
“Stay,” Bruce says, leaning around Barton’s chair. “Watch the rest of the movie.”
“You said something about going to get the marriage license?” Steve asks. Out of the corner of his eye, he sees Tony twitch.
“No,” Tony shakes his head. “Well, yes, maybe, with the swell bit, but I am dead serious about that NDA. If someone leaks this, everything will be for nothing, and we’ll be in the shit on top of what it was before.”
“Ivanhoe?” Natasha guessed, removing her hand from his arm but still leaning into him.
“…His location is unknown,” Friday stated.
“Master Hogan drove Sir to his private jet this morning. He will arrive in California within the hour. Shall I inform him of you inquiry? There is a Jarvis uplink in both the plane and Sir’s phone.”
“What’s up,” Tony asked, trading an equally perplexed look with his soulmate.
After the scanner passed his chest, Tony stepped under the scanner and out of the machine.
Tony sighed heavily and also leaned back. He murmured in a promise, “I’ll think of something…” He smirked and asked, “So back to dating? Have any embarrassing birthmarks in inappropriate places I should know about?”
“Fuck no,” his uncle growled, making Peter still. His uncle never cursed unless he was really upset. Now that he was in his uncle’s hold, he could feel the older man’s entire body was trembling, not just his arm and his pulse was racing under Peter’s ear.
Steve was amazing. He was sweet, caring, loving, and…and was just a bundle of perfection. He was a great person who did not deserve the fate history had written out for him.
“Children before marriage is perfectly acceptable in the 21
“What the hell was he doing here?!” Clint repeated.
But there were hundreds and the list kept growing. Soon it’d be thousands.
The officer sighed and stated, “Look, North of the park, there are a lot of churches that feed yous guys. If you leave now, you’ll probably be able to grab a bite.”
“Hey,” Tony shushed him and also cupped Steve’s cheek. “I survived it, Steve…”
Bucky nodded to him one more time and then turned away.
The notes revealed only the final design to the shield but nothing on how his father attained such valuable metal and
He carefully positioned himself on the bed next to Tony and embraced him the best he could without breaking their mouths. Tony readily moved aside and wrapped one of his arms around Steve’s torso while keeping the other hand threaded in his hair. They put their all into it, pouring their very souls into every touch.
“Huh,” Tony murmured as his door opened with a slight creak.
Tony groaned and Steve gasped, “Are you alright??”
Steve knew the exact moment Ben had met Mary. Not because he was a good guesser or he had calculated and measured his steps…but because his husband was one of the smartest people on the planet and hacking into all the cameras in the city just the watch Ben’s progression was an easy thing for him to do.
Tony grinned as he imagined all the things he could do to mess with Coulson. Coulson took the smile as acceptance and nodded them inside.
“Yes…No…I’m – I’m okay. I just lost my fiancé not too long ago and you – you remind me
The fight went as he remembered it.
Peter elbowed Wade in the gut and Wade fell back with a mock groan, clutching his stomach. Peter replied, “It’s my new suit. I made it, it’s a biological…well, it’s like a living suit. Wade, for some reason, thinks it looks like an eighties movie monster.”
“Use it only if you have to,” Bucky commanded. Stepan slipped from Natasha’s side and ran to his father. Bucky knelt and caught his son.
Wade sighed, dropping my head, and murmured, “You’ve saw me in Chapter Three, Pete. I ain’t pretty.” He pointed at his mask and declared, “This mask…it’s gorgeous, a work of art, but the face beneath looks like the remains of Picasso’s paint palette.”
Cap came up behind him and asked, “…You really don't know how to make the lather?”
They returned to the house and Bucky elected to give Natasha the tour. Tony watched them disappear upstairs with a smirk. He was glad to see Bucky so enamored.
“TONY?!?!!!!!”
Tony began to rhythmically hump Steve. The friction of his cock sent indescribable waves of pleasure throughout Steve’s body.
Venom, nevertheless, was doing no such thing.
“Is it so hard to believe?” Tony asked sarcastically.
“I know…and that scares me,” Steve replied, burying his face into Tony’s shoulder. Tony’s brows shot together and Steve continued, “I don’t want to tie you down…”
(See the end of the chapter for
“That’s what I just said,” Eddie retorted dryly.
“I can’t wait for your birthday,” Wade weakly whispered, lightly running his fingers through Peter’s hair.
The Soldier listened to the steady stream of names with a small smile. They meant nothing to him but the fact that Natasha was trying to –.
Steve lay naked in the middle of a frosted room. He was curled in a ball and his breath came out in shuddering, cloudy puffs.
“This is a small island. All us scientists knew each other, especially those of us who were going to make a difference…” Tony sighed then peered at Peter. To his son, Tony murmured, “Hey munchkin, your mom was kick-ass.”
Confused and alarmed, Steve asked, “Why?”
Wade whimpered and seemed to fall deeper into Peter’s arms at the sound.
And behind all of them was Wade...
“Sir, Director Fury is calling your direct line,” Jarvis stated. “Shall I take a message?”
The dreamscape materialized and the horizon was dark. Instead of Tony standing before him, it was the mansion that Steve recognized as Tony’s home. He’d seen it many times, but it was usually well lit and filled with the smell of fresh baked cookies made by Tony’s butler, Jarvis.
“It was just this one night,” Tony whispered into the white tile. “It won’t happen again…not for…” He paused, how much was he willing to say. Should he lie again? Could he lie again?
He remembered that he and Natasha gotten atrociously drunk off the Asgardian liquor before both Tony and Clint finally found them. Both of their partners had also drank but were still of sound mind to collectively decide it was time to leave and led them out the back where Happy had picked them up.
The footage seemed to come from a security camera and in the corner of the screen he saw movement down the alley across the street. He recognized it as a mugging but out of nowhere a new figure joined the fray and moved with a fighting style he had only seen in Natasha and –.
“Yes…” And there goes his heart rate. Right back to super speed. Tony cleared his throat and grasped Steve’s hands. He murmured, “I wanted to celebrate our 5 year, 3-month anniversary.”
“No…you were only trying to help. We appreciate the effort. Thank you for bringing him back to us.”
“…Can’t we?”
“Stark-,” Coulson began, dropping “Mr.” which showed he was losing patience.
All the blood drained from Steve’s face and he hissed, “
Tony pathetically grasped at Steve’s chest. He couldn't be gone. He couldn't have killed him. He was Captain America, a super soldier, it was Steve! He was indestructible!
Just thinking of it made his stomach turn over.
“Tony doesn’t know I left. Can you go to him and let him know…and just be there with him. He’s in a fragile state right now and will need someone and his Aunt Peggy will probably be the best person for the job.”
“Holy shit,” Tony cursed. He looked at Steve with shocked eyes but Steve did not understand his reaction so Tony gasped, “That –
“Fine,” Steve said and Tony grinned. Steve’s heart instantly swooned at the sight. How could he already be pinning for his smile? Steve bit his lip and added, “Tony?”
Over the years, Hydra grew and, like a tree root, it found its way into governments or other powerful organizations by meandering its way into cracks.
The Soldier would not let her sway him.
He was far from fine but he did not want to worry his aunt any more than she already was. She nodded and then murmured, “I’m going to try to get the reporters off the front lawn and then I’m going to make breakfast, okay?”
He couldn't even save his childhood superhero’s life…
“Sorry I was gone so long…” Peter murmured, awkwardly scratching the back of his head.
“I didn’t want to hurt you…” Steve whispered.
“I love you so mu-
AC/DC started playing and Tony grinned cheekily at Steve. Steve flushed and stood ridged in Tony’s hold. A flush crept up his cheeks and he stammered, “W-We can’t dance to this!”
him! Tony made him a better man, he made Steve be true to himself, he made him feel things he never thought he could feel, he was one of the best things to happen to Steve since he woke from the ice!
He cleared his throat again and Steve leaned back to better peer curiously at Tony.
want to do, Peter?” Steve asked, taking his silence for apprehension.
Tony was standing as still as a statue but his eyes were wildly jumping to Steve to Bucky to the hand that held the syringe. His throat bobbed as he gulped and the syringe shifted deeper into his neck, making Tony hiss. He said nothing, probably fearing what speaking may do to the syringe.
“Everything is achievable through technology,” Howard stated confidently.
Both men shook their heads and Steve sighed again.
“The blood sample of Mary Parker has finished processing. Sir’s original test verified the blood sample was a relation to Master Parker. The blood sample still showed being a relation of Master Parker because the sample
– right now, here, before the end of our dreams come be it tonight or decades from now.”
Steve let himself be led into a massive limo and he, Coulson, and Tony slid inside while Thor shot into the air. The agents scattered to clear traffic. As soon as the door sealed, Tony’s armor folded itself off his body and into a suitcase at his feet. Once he was free of the armor, Tony launched himself at Steve.
Tony laughed and crossed the room to place himself in front of Steve. Just being near the man made Tony’s blood pump with desire.
I could to fix it in this era! Howard can’t do anything more!”
“I'm okay, Aunt May,” he assured her, squeezing her arms.
Steve let go of Tony's hand and shoved his left hand into the Iron Man gauntlet he had taken off Tony. He took a steadying breath and then whispered, “Whether it be 1940, 2009, today…or to infinity, wherever you go, I go.”
The four twitched but did not break apart.
era but…what about yours? How much has the future changed for…for guys like me? For ‘gay’ guys?”
“Positive,” Steve said, lightly touching Peter’s back.
“So, how was your day?”
Wade shrugged and murmured, “Nothing much, helped out the X-Men a few days ago…”
“Be simple,” Natasha suggested, her entire body tense as if she suspected an attack at any moment. Bruce and Thor watched the exchange with equal expressions of horror
And there no way he wanted his dad to see him and Wade naked…
,” Tony retorted over his shoulder.
Tony opened his eyes, his gaze looked a little fevered, but he groaned heartily when he saw who had joined him.
“It’s reaching out to me,” Peter replied and more tendrils reached out to touch him from all directions within the cocoon. The tendrils poked at him, exploring the new territory and Peter laughed. He gasped, “It’s curious! I think its sentient!”
In seconds, Venom encased Peter's entire body in the new Spidey suit and shot out tendrils to wrap around Natasha’s leg and stop her from touching Peter.
Peter’s eyes widened and Steve could see a thousand questions blossom behind his sky blue eyes. He knelt and kept his hands on his son as he waited for the first question.
He embraced Wade tightly as tears pricked at his eyes and Wade returned the embrace with a soft, reassuring murmur. Peter looked over to Natasha. She was still unconscious and hung limply in Bucky’s arms. Bucky looked like he’d been about to move her but must have stopped when Peter attacked Wade.
Steve stroked his arm and Tony stuttered to a stop.
so check it out! :)
Steve bit down on his lip as he considered.
“Look at me, Tony,” Steve commanded.
“Mostly,” Tony shrugged and then carefully inserted another tiny shield panel to the arm’s exoskeleton. Nodding to the box, he asked, “What’s that?”
Steve ran his fingers through Tony’s hair and murmured, “Probably because I hadn’t fallen asleep yet.”
“Thanks for that,” Steve grumbled, turning back to him. He crossed the few steps that separated them and then wrapped his arms around his chest as he stared at Tony.
But he couldn’t curse him with such a future. The ghost of his father was right, it was a fate worse than death.
Bruce was the foremost expert in gamma-radiation and the only other person alive other than Peter to survive the exposure to it. Bruce had been Peter’s doctor ever since SHIELD found him. Steve would not trust Peter to anyone else but his friend’s capable hands.
Peter’s smile lessened a fraction. Wade was wearing jeans, a zip-up hoodie, and…his mask?
Bruce peered down at his nephew sadly. Peter shared with him a fate he would have never wished on anyone. Before he attained a measure of control on the Hulk, his other half had killed hundreds of innocents and had even eaten a few of them.
Steve buried his face in the crook of Tony’s neck and just held him. He reveled in the fact that they were both safe, alive, and in love, and wished to extend the moment forever.
“Coulson?” Tony stated with renewed interest. Coulson was the one man in SHIELD whom Tony had a direct link to. “Hmm, Jarvis, punch me through to the agent.”
Steve saw red and surged across the table and picked Norman up by his suit lapels. He lifted him out of his chair and half dragged him across the desk.
Over five years later, Richard and Mary Parker died in a plane accident and their department was bought out by their partner company, Oscorp Industries. Stark Industries did not even try to attempt buy back their old biologic department. The article stated that Stark Industries was no longer interested biological sciences and, at the time, was the only interested in expanding their industrial weapons sector.
Steve bought a vanilla cone for himself, in case Peter did not like the strawberry flavor, but he absolutely loved it. Bruce also got a chocolate cone for himself. The three of them sat on a secluded bench overlooking the walking path and watched the people go by as they enjoyed their dessert.
His phone began to ring. He sighed in relief when he saw it was Tony calling him.
“You said our kid is in trouble?” Tony demanded, turning back to the man in red.
The Soldier placed his firearm back onto the side table but he circled the room and tried to pinpoint what had woken him. He found nothing and decided to check outside. He picked up his gun and holstered it. He crossed the room and put his right hand on the doorknob but froze upon seeing his soul implant.
Clint was never going to let him live it down.
But, Tony loved the boy since the day Steve had called him to the hospital to meet him.
The bang of the gun made Steve flinch but when he felt no pain he cautiously opened his eyes. General Ross was on the ground, blood was beginning to blossom from the center of his back.
, Uncle Phil.”
Steve bit down on his lip and whispered, “Bucky died before the crash and Peggy…Peggy doesn’t remember me…she has Alzheimer’s.”
Steve imitated Tony as he rolled his eyes and he said to Peter, “Peter this is Tony Stark, he is my best friend but he is also the most immoral man you will ever meet.”
“Sorry about spoiling our island getaway,” Tony suddenly murmured. “I was expecting to celebrate your mistrial very differently…”
“Boss, they’re going out into the field,” Friday eventually said, drawing them apart.
Bucky knew the whole story and his eyes widened as he gasped, “You’re shitting me!”
Cap held the lathering brush out to him and Tony accepted it with a grimace. He hadn't been clean shaven since college!
“I may not feel good but that doesn’t mean my ears stopped working…” Tony dryly stated and then nuzzled his face into Steve’s shoulder.
Tony grinned and hopped out of the jeep while it was still rolling.
He made a noise that was a combination of a startled gasp and a stifled scream. Unsurprisingly, the clip slipped out of his grasp and he crashed down to the level below.
“Want me to do what?” Tony murmured with a light groan as he continued to rub himself against Steve. Steve could not think clearly with all the blood rushing from his head. He was not in total control right now which could mean danger to Tony if Steve did not keep his strength in check. If Steve topped, he might literally rip his boyfriend in two and that was something he would very much like to prevent... So, in the end, it was easy for him to decide how to lose his virginity.
“He has reached his final form!” Dr. Calvin gasped.
Steve embraced Bucky tightly and pressed his face into Bucky's chest. He did not let go because, as soon as he did, he knew it'd be the beginning of the end.
Tony would die for him.
Steve chuckled and murmured, “Don’t sound too excited…”
Tony wanted to build something real with Steve.
“No, but…
The plane landed in the meantime and several bodies jumped and flew out of the plane. One in particular, walked toward them with a heavy tread.
Bucky let her turn over his hand as she inspected it for cuts. He watched her with unabashed confusion.
“Peter did,” Steve whispered, his voice and hope breaking.
Steve winced and squeezed his hand sympathetically as he whispered, “Sorry.”
?? Why wasn’t I informed??” Thor gasped, gripping his hammer tightly. “I told you to keep an eye on Midgard and summon me if they ever needed me!”
“Miss, I don’t know if you’re a reporter or a wannabe detective but you are not the one barking out the orders,” the officer retorted.
“Okay…” Sam replied slowly,  “Can you take him to the cafeteria to see if they have any soft foods or formula he can eat? He’s probably hungry…and I’ll go find the social worker.”
Howard arrived first and wasn’t prepared for the entire team of the Howling Commandos jumping out of the Jeep, but he was more unprepared for the fragile looking version of his future son. He deteriorated much more in the days since he left. He barely recognized him. He didn’t even wake as Dum Dum helped Jim move the stretcher with him on it out of the back of the Jeep.
“Which hospital is it?” She asked.
Tony had done that to them. He had hurt the two people he loved most in the world.
(See the end of the chapter for
“You’re as talkative making love as you are in everyday life,” Steve observed with a smile and Tony grabbed onto Steve’s arms tightly as Steve’s fingers moved over the head of his cock. He pressed his own dick to Tony’s and began to rub them together. Tony gasped, “Yes, and you are clearly more of a
more serious, right?” Wade asked, glancing at Peter hopefully.
This was the first time he’d seen what Wade was wearing and the man needed to stay in bed because he was in nothing but tight, white
Eddie stood up sharply, making Peter jump.
“Try me,” Pepper retorted defiantly.
The man’s brows pinched together and he asked with some confusion, “Me?”
"I'll...I'll try," Bucky murmured, dropping his head.
As Jarvis made the changes, Tony glanced over his shoulder, but Jarvis beat him to it and stated, “I have yet to find any additional information on the man who entered the property.”
Steve kept his gaze outside, watching the rain, and whispered, “…I didn’t realize I was so readable…”
“So, Steve tells me you're gonna try to ‘woo’ him,” Bucky murmured into his spoonful before sipping it down.
He carefully placed the toy on top of it all and sealed his bag with a quick tug on the zipper before throwing it over his shoulder, bouncing lightly off his shield.
“But, I’d like everyone to be there: the Avengers, you guys, my friends…” Peter stated, “I want my life to be as whole as it can be on my birthday…minus the fireworks.”
Behind him, the Captain was put onto a stretcher and they wheeled him out. Fury got to his feet and stated, “Had you not attacked us. Both of you would have been detained for questioning. We could have examined the Captain’s mind and determined his mental state this being AWOL was only our excuse to legally get a hold of him. We have to make sure he is not a danger toward the public.”
“A national tragedy…” Wade sighed.
Whereas Tony had Steve to cling to for support, Wade's hands had nothing…He supported himself by leaning into the wall and his eyes clung to the screens before him like they were his only chance at human comfort. Even when Steve went to his side and tried to physically comfort him himself, Wade still only looked to the screens. Tony innately knew Wade looked this way because of Peter. If Tony were in his shoes and it was Steve in that room, he'd probably look the same as him.
It was finally happening.
“You and every eligible lady in the city,” Solo grumbled with a roll of his eyes.
“Yessss,” Venom hissed.
They all surrounded him with their weapons drawn and Cable found himself rolling his eyes for the umpteenth time that night. Wanting to leave this timeline already, he demanded, “Who’s in command?”
“No,” Tony gasped, the single word sounded like it tore its way out of Tony’s throat and Steve winced again. Tony grabbed his arm and whispered fiercely, “It was you and me. It was
“Which is why I never did that,” Peter countered. He hit enter and waited for the light to turn green.
Wade continued to sleep and breathe evenly, completely unaware that Peter was being strangled right next to him.
When the Sinister Six appeared, Steve unconsciously gripped Tony tighter. Tony made no comment on the added pressure and leaned into Steve and pulled him into a half hug.
In his mind, Coulson compared it to the great discovery of King Tut and felt as excited as the early explorers must have felt.
“Me too,” Steve whispered and dropped his gaze so he wouldn’t have to see the open emotion in Tony’s eyes. He was wrong to assume Tony had so easily moved on…He was hurting just as much as Steve was…
Steve was sitting on the ground, hyperventilating deeply. His head was bowed to his knees and clutched between his hands but it shot up upon Tony’s arrival. Steve was wearing his jogging outfit and the right arm of his shirt was torn and his hair was disheveled. It was not hard for Tony to guess what had happened.
Steve groaned, “
Peter flushed and murmured embarrassedly, “Thanks guys.”
Peter’s eyes sparkled and replied with as much conviction, “Me too…” He looked back down at his phone and murmured, “What should I write?”
“I know…” Howard sighed, running his fingers through Tony’s hair. Tony hummed under his touch and pressed his face deeper into Maria’s side. Staring at their son, Howard stated, “We need to protect him.”
Peter looked a little confused by the move, even one of Wade’s voices was whining about wanting to get to third base.
Steve's heart ached.
“There are very few solutions with what to do with you,” the man continued and Eddie perked up. Wait…they had multiple ideas already? Venom moved uneasily underneath his skin.
are my home, Steve…I can’t imagine a future without yo –.”
was busily regrouping, collecting what information they could from this Hydra site, and preparing to leave it all at once. They had a few more days there before moving onto the next possible Hydra compound. Tony was wary and excited about going with the Commandos. Excited because, hello, it was the Commandos. Who wouldn’t be excited? And Steve would be going so, of course Tony would follow.
“Get your shield now!” Tony exclaimed and he ran to the closet where he had a panel with an emergency suit.
Steve cupped the side of his face and promised, “We’ll help you however we can. With your dad, Bruce, Scott, and Vision – we’ve got some of the smartest men on planet here, all able to help. We'll figure something out.”
When he crashed the plane, he thought he was the unluckiest person on the planet to have lost so much but now…now he felt like the luckiest.
“Hello, my beloved,” Tony replied, sitting up and smiling dopily at Steve.
“I’m here, Tony,” Steve whispered. “I will always be here. Why else would I be here other than to stay with you? You’re my soulmate. I am not going to leave you.”
James smiled.
A few tears dropped from his eyes and Steve forgot how to breathe again but he smiled at his husband, never before feeling so grateful as he did in that moment.
“I love you too, Pops,” Tony retorted with a sly smile. He grasped Steve’s bicep and said, “Let’s go back to the party and open that present!”
Cue sappy music!
The Goblin turned the reactor in his claws and whispered menacingly, “But if you are dead then all my problems will go away. Your son will never become Spider Man. The Avengers will never form. Your company will flounder while mine will flourish. No…I don’t think I will return the reactor. I think I might just crush it.”
“Papa?”
Tony could figuratively feel the ugly festering and clogging up his throat. He didn’t want to fight with Steve. He loved this man with his
He technically was not in Los Angeles but on the outskirts in Malibu, right on the coast. The booklet itself was a little too expensive for him if he wanted to get the shoes too. He solved the problem by saving it all to memory and then returned it to the stand. He went to the counter to pay for the shoes but paused by the clothing and grabbed a cheap shirt to replace the plaid one he was wearing. It was much warmer outside in LA than in had been in Colorado and Hydra was looking for a man fitting his description in this shirt.
“What are you doing here? Where have you been??” Steve grabbed his arm and gasped, “I looked everywhere for you!”
"...Bucky, Bruce already tried to bring her back," Steve said, grasping Bucky's bicep. "It can't be done."
He let himself get lost in his passion and forgot all about why he and Tony were kissing. He let himself believe that it was all about them, that when Tony told him his body was excited to touch him it was because he not only wanted Steve…but he wanted
having sex.”
Happy started to drive without a word and Peter sighed, relaxing his hold on his shirt.
Steve shook his head and whispered, “He may be physically gone but…he is not gone from my heart.”
Steve gave Tony a squeeze and earnestly replied to Pepper, “It is nice to finally meet you too.”
Steve opened his eyes and he was so shocked by the fact that he actually opened his physical eyes that he just stared blankly at the ceiling for several long moments.
“It’s good to hear your voice, Cap.”
Bucky looked at her hand and then her face, and now looked at her as if she were the insane one and not Tony. Oh, Tony was going to have a great time with these two.
Peter’s flush evolved into an all-encompassing blush.
The curtains snapped loudly when the silence descended on them again.
He pulled Tony into a rough embrace and, after years of repressing his fears and sorrows, it all became just too much. He finally let himself weep.
Wade sat up and helped him out. He asked, “How are you feeling?”
Steve stepped forward and Tony fell into step beside him. He was instantly reminded of all of the late night walks they took together at the Hydra base. Tony must have remembered too because they both were silent as they strolled away from eavesdropping ears.
He was still smiling when they came up to the table and said, "Hey, everyone, this is Tony."
Peter was back but the pain lingered even though it was years later. Whenever he had to go to space again, he’d do so with the memory of once losing his son and the knowledge that this could be it, this could be the mission the Sinister Six murder his son.
He entered the room and his eyes were drawn to his sketchbook. He quickly went to it first and drew out the page he had sketched of Howard. The image of a young Howard Stark would hopefully provide further evidence.
“I know…” Steve whispered back. “I’m sorry.”
says you two are already married and Tony is pregnant with Steve’s super baby,” Bruce stated with a small smile. Tony laughed falling into Steve’s side.
Tony’s mind raced. Palladium was hard to get in the future. He knew for a fact that something as bountiful as aluminum was rationed in World War II so palladium would probably be totally impossible to get in this era.
Steve winced at the curse word but smirked and agreed, “Yes, it’s been a year.”
“…What?”
They took the stairs to the lobby. Tony was huffing slightly by the top step but Steve was unaffected as always. Steve caught his eye and smiled knowingly at Tony as if he had read his mind at that moment.
“Thanks,” Peter murmured, “You’re awesome.”
“Nope!” Natasha replied and the doors sealed behind them, leaving Steve alone with Tony.
Tony rounded the front of the car and hopped into the driver’s seat. Steve went to the backdoor, where Peter’s car seat was. He tore open the door and shoved Peter inside. Tony reached into the back and was buckling Peter in just as Steve closed the door. He felt immensely better having the barrier of the car door between Peter and the reporters.
“Is that – Stark, as in Anthony Stark?” Steve gasped.
“I never received orders to monitor for Master Rogers,” Jarvis replied and Tony inhaled sharply. No, Jarvis was doing just as he was programed to do…
with Tony.
in the press I may not be too happy with you…” Peter added as an afterthought, pressing the back of his head into Wade's chest. He may continue to date Wade but it didn’t mean he had to be totally okay with him breaking the big laws. He was human after all.
“They’ll find out anyways,” he replied with a small shrug. “I just wanted everyone to know all the great you did too.”
Peter's hand tightened on Wade's and the clock on his phone changed to twelve...
Steve was not as good at subtle flirting or roundabout conversation as Tony was doing right now. He was more straight to the point and direct so he replied, “Only if you’ll have me.”
Tony doesn’t say anything, for once, just nods encouragingly. He also doesn’t let go of Steve’s hand, but, oddly enough, Steve doesn’t really mind.
“Nuh-uh,” Tony reaches out, catches Steve by the wrist, and Steve realizes he’s automatically reached up to fix his hair. “Don’t ruin all my hard work.” Tony’s smirking again, and Steve feels himself start to grin back.
“Is Tony awake, yet?” Steve asks while he dresses, thinks maybe he could grab some bagels for them on his way back. He didn’t see much in the way of breakfast foods when he explored the kitchen the evening before.
this deal, you
“Well, what kind of husband would I be if I didn’t look after my spouse’s affairs?” Tony shakes his head at himself. “Tell her that her opinion has been noted, and thank you.”
Tony swears, and rubs a hand over his face. “Fuck it,” he says, and puts the coffee back on the counter. “Lock it all down, J. I’m going to bed.”
“Don’t do that,” he tells her. “That thing, with your face. It makes me feel like there’s someone killing puppies, and nobody likes a puppy-killer, but I don’t know how to save the puppies.”
“If there is an after,” Tony can’t help but remind him.
Tony shakes his head. “Nothing,” he says quickly. “I didn’t – it was nothing.”
“Not sure anyone else wants those details,” he says, gives a very obvious wink, and Steve is abruptly aware that Tony’s hand is still on his thigh, warm through the thin material of his slacks. It gives him a very intense sense memory of the way Tony had kissed him before dinner, palm cupped around the back of his neck to draw him down, and again afterwards, when they had to run the gauntlet of press outside the restaurant.
The kitchen is empty when he gets there, but he’s left bagels on the counter the last two mornings, and they’ve vanished by lunchtime, so he figures someone has to be eating them. Probably several someones.
Tony’s looking up at him now, maybe not quite following, but with the beginnings of interest.
Tony grins. “Thanks, J, you’re a peach.”
“Our foes have forfeited,” Thor announces. The lightning has vanished from the sky entirely, but Steve thinks Thor is probably still somewhere out on the edge of the park.
more than a crush, but I don’t. I don’t really know him, do I? I think we’ve proven that quite often enough with the way we butt heads. I built him up in my head to be this… I don’t know. My father always.” Tony stops. Swallows. Changes tack. “Every time I think I know what he’s going to do, or how he’s going to react, he does something different. He’s human as they come, and sometimes that’s so disappointing I just want to break something, because he was the one thing I had –” Tony stops again. Takes another deep breath. “Sometimes it’s disappointing, but sometimes it just makes him real in a way I never could have imagined, and I don’t know what to do with that. I can’t figure him out. Maybe this will give me the chance to, and he’ll lose some of his sheen. Or maybe it’ll just desensitize me to his existence.”
Steve gives himself a mental shake. “No, I did,” he replies carefully.
Steve sits and starts in on his bagel.
“I wouldn’t put anything past them,” Ms. Potts tells him frankly. “Phil’s been better about it than I’d expected, but he’s been a bit more of a family man than a company man since the invasion. And there’s only so much he would be able to do to head them off, in any case.”
– just the way you’re a goddamned hypocrite every time you get your righteous panties in a bunch when you don’t get a daily memo detailing everyone’s every thought.”
“Great. The GranCabrio was ready, you said? Let’s build an engine.” Tony leaves his unfinished drink on the bar and heads for the elevator. He figures he can get in at least a couple solid hours in the workshop before he has to go hold hands and play nice for the cameras. Thinking about something that is not Steve Rogers sounds like a fantastic idea right now.
“If I’m going to sleep with someone,” Steve repeats.
“Of course, sir,” Jarvis replies smoothly, and video starts scrolling at the edge of the HUD.
“Attack pigeons?” Steve asks, not entirely sure he got that right.
There might be something to it all, Steve thinks as he slides under his sheets, more than just the fact that he hadn’t so much as kissed anyone for months before that first for-the-cameras kiss with Tony. He’s pretty sure he’d have to be blind not to realize how attractive Tony is, and now he’s got more of a handle on what Tony’s like behind all the flash, it seems almost logical that he’d develop some kind of an interest. And Tony’s seemed not
“Right.” Steve thanks Jarvis again as he steps off the elevator, and follows the low murmur of voices down the hall into the penthouse kitchen.
Clint shrugged. “What can you do? One foot in front of the other. It doesn’t go away, not really, but you let it be a part of you instead of all of you. And that’s good. You don’t want to forget, but you need to let yourself move on, if you can.”
-ness is going to rub off on me?”
“It’s not a bank heist,” Tony repeats, comes to a stop in front of the row of elevators. “They
Rhodey claps him on the shoulder, joviality a little forced, but not as much as it had been earlier. “Then let’s get you hitched.”
There’s a thundering in Tony’s ears, and the tiny voice in his brain that’s still functioning logically is saying it’s his heartbeat, but the rest of him is just trying to breathe. His vision tunnels, and everything goes grey.
By the time Steve comes back and crawls into the bed, tugging the sheets up over both of them, Tony’s mostly out. “You’re warm,” he mutters, curls into Steve’s chest, feels the arm Steve drapes around him.
“Here, Nat can make room,” he says, pushing at Natasha’s ankles until she moves her feet.
“Dr. Banner is in the monitor room – Captain Rogers has agreed that, as with the situation with the rats, it would be best to keep him above ground, except as a last resort. The Captain himself is in his room in the penthouse, changing into his uniform. Agents Barton and Romanoff are at SHIELD headquarters, and will meet you on site.”
Artur beamed and scrambled off of Steve's lap.
“What’s a woman like that want with an old dog like you anyway Bakhuizen?”
It was after sundown by the time they returned to the house, the sun having just dipped below the horizon left the deep golds, purples, and reds of dusk behind it. The back of Steve’s neck prickled when he saw the boys waiting outside the garden gate, their fear palpable in the air as he and Tony approached. They were in the coats Frau Carboni had brought home with her, donated at the synagogue, and their boots were scuffed with mud. They must have been out all day, Steve summarized, tension crawling up his spine. He’d given into Tony’s persuasion that the children could not be cooped up indoors all day, but they’d been instructed to stay nearby and never to separate.
“Your sister. Where did she tell them that she went?”
“We don’t know that for sure.” Stefen insisted, but Tony could see it on his face. He’d already thought the same thing. Hammer’s name hovered on the edge of Tony’s tongue but he hesitated. What proof did he have, besides a bad feeling? Hammer might be an oily weasel but he’d been with the Rogers family for a lot longer than Tony had.
Stanislov chuckled again, the sound lacking any warmth to it.
God. The thought of striking Tony’s flesh that way, feeling it give beneath his hands flipped his stomach. He could be sick.
"You can. Anything that doesn't involve you risking infection."
Because he was dangerous, a small voice whispered in Natacha's mind. He was an enemy. He had secrets.
Péter was a child, he kept reminding himself, and like all children his understanding of the world was narrow and self-focused. Licking dry lips Bucky took a deep calming breath and gestured for Péter to come to him. The boy wisely complied without complaint, shoulders hunched and eyes downcast.
A ripple went through Tony’s glassy gaze and he looked back at Steve, quiet, eyes wide, terror rippling off him in waves. “I… I - we can’t go out there.”
Behind him Artur was shrieking for James to go faster and just like that it was a race with Péter rushing out in front of them followed closely by Ian and Natacha. James followed red faced but determined.
When the door had clicked shut behind him Tony sighed and sank down onto the floor beside James, sure that it was going to be a minute or two before he was ready to get up. For a time the two just sat in silence, Tony stroking the boy’s damp hair back from his eyes as James’ sobs quieted to wet sniffles. Tony wasn’t sure how much time had passed when James rolled closer to Tony’s side so that his head was resting against the older man’s thigh and finally looked up at him with watery blue eyes. He didn’t say anything, but Tony could see the misery writ there and hear his unspoken question.
Tony was right though.
“Alright, little potatoes gather round.” Tony clambered to his feet with a clap of his hands. The children gathered obediently (Natacha begrudgingly). “Let us get this lesson started shall we? It will distract certain bottomless pits we know from thinking about their stomachs.”
"It's not proper for young women to take to the stage." Natacha chastised gently and Tony's frown deepened as her eyes met his, their blue cool and sharp . "Your true work lies at home."
It hurt, more than he would have ever imagined, to hear the truth said like that. To know that his son had put his life in danger and it was because he didn’t think his father was proud of him. The words slashed like a knife, deflating the air from his chest and leaving him with an alarming sensation of falling. He gnashed his teeth together, struggling for balance, his knuckles white from the pressure of fisting them. The urge to take a swing was so strong – beat those words back behind his teeth – but it wouldn’t help. Wouldn’t change the truth.
“Steve!” he called his name like someone who’d been calling it for awhile.
Patroche the goat. The woman wanted him to stop scaring her goat.
“It’s not your fault Tony,” Stefen read his mind and Tony looked up at him, startled to realize how tightly he was holding Artur. “His bouts are usually pretty minor. He’s had a big day.”
The farmer, Otto Hofeiter lived with his wife and children on a small farm, about two or three miles outside of the town center. Bucky had to be careful as the area was still crawling with soldiers, but he managed to glean from the local gossip that the SS had not caught the man they were looking for. The farmer’s daughter had gone missing before their arrival and the SS had been waiting for her upon her return. She’d been taken away and had not returned.
Lt. Steven's had been as confused as the rest, directionless, but not so bitter that he'd let it consume everything else. His motto had always been to work hard and to obey the law. A man could always expect to be fed and not to be surprised by very much, if he just did the work and respected the law. His brother Linus said it was a simple way to look at the world, and perhaps that was true. Dieter had always preferred to keep things simple.
Steve let the jacket fall around his arms, breath constricting in his chest as he watched Tony reach for his tie and slowly begin untying the knot. Once he’d managed to free him of that it was only moments before he had the silk shirt open and was pressing kisses against the flushed skin above the undershirt.
“More fun that way. ‘Sides. I used to sneak into Tony’s workshop all the time. He’d hardly know it was me if I came through the front door.”
They stood in uncomfortable silence for what felt like eons, and it was only his training that kept Dvorak from fidgeting like the doctor.
That feeling of unease blossomed again in Dvorak's stomach, winding up his nerves like a mechanical toy. Dr. Fischer stepped toward the bed, his briefcase in hand and took control of the room with the firm measured bedside manner of a good physician.
That alone was strange but could perhaps be reasoned away by… well
"I have to run, but you mustn't worry for me Captain. I am hardier than I look. I will see you all again soon."
“It won't be that long.” Steve leaned forward but directed his answer to Artur who was pouting into his plate. “A week at most.”
She looked toward Stefen and the owner and Tony hastily shook his head.
He’d remember the coldness and how trying to pay attention to the conversation was like trying to hear while underwater. He wouldn’t remember stopping Bucky – who was all for going ahead with the plan anyways, even without the expected back up – or how his voice cracked when he’d commanded him, physically and loudly, to stand the hell down. It was still a mercy really that he couldn’t remember the look of betrayal on Bucky’s face as the hopelessness had set in.
“Péter’s gone!” Steve rode over his objection, balling his fists as he took a looming step toward the smaller man. “He’s been gone all day!”
“Take this. Your mother, God rest her soul, would roll in her grave if she knew I let you get into this state.” She waved a plate of seabass with olives and lemon and flat bread with fig jam under his nose until he took it from her.
Seeing you soon,
He’d been looser, that night they’d drank together, but not at ease. There had still been something tense coiled tightly within him, some specter behind his eyes that only he seemed party to. Not the way he’d been when Tony had come to his study to warn him about Werner’s snooping.
“Yes. He said my name. He recognized me.”
“Stefen?” Tony managed to rasp in wonder, slowly lowering the pipe just before the most precious sound he’d ever heard came from the darkness. From the back of the cellar James came running like a bat out of the dark.
“That’s why they have you doing this.” Tony summarized.
To distract himself he turned to Ian and asked, “And you?”
Two days was not enough time. He’d thought it would be enough, that he could be content with whatever the future would bring so long as he could touch him just once, but that brief taste had just left him aching for more. He didn’t even mean the sex, Steve would trade it for just more of Tony. He’d be happy just to sit and listen to his endless chatter or watch him tinker on some machine if it meant just a little more time. God, he wanted more time.
mess. He should be in the streets with those fucking little
Rogers sighed and looked down, his brow furrowed deeply in thought muttering a quiet, “Damn.”
Steve nodded slowly and shrugged free of Tony’s grip on him. He couldn’t stomach the pity he’d see in Tony’s eyes so he didn’t meet them.
"She has already promised this sentimental old fool a dance," Tony interrupted smoothly and both turned toward them, the young man looked him up and down with a scowl as Tony flashed him with a friendly smile and a showy bow. He extended his hand for Natacha's and prompted, "Frauline?"
“Let go of me! Let go of me, you’re not my father!” James screamed and kicked as Tony dragged him out the front door of the cabin by the back of his shirt. Tony tossed him unceremoniously into the snow outside the door, and James shrieked loud enough to cause an avalanche. So much for laying low Tony thought grimly, bracing his hands on his hips as he glowered down at the boy. James sat up, his face still slack with shock, looking around him stupidly as if he’d never seen snow before. More likely he’d never been tossed out on his ass in it before, Tony thought with no small amount of satisfaction.
"Daniel! I couldn’t find you - " Cameron fought to get out, but it was hard to speak with how tightly he and Daniel still held one another. Sniffing wetly Daniel pulled back, his eyes still blotchy with tears.
“I see it every day.” He insisted with a soft smile. “Your father, he couldn’t be more a sentinel of justice if he sprang from a stone statue. Right?  Mind you, he’s just as inflexible.  It’s why you’re better with him than I am. He wisely married a very prudent woman, and fate was kind enough to gift him with a very prudent daughter. And you are a gift. Let’s face it, he’d be dead if not for you.”
“Nothing worth remembering.”
Because he did know. He hadn’t forgotten, not even when he’d shut Bucky out. Not really. He’d just been in so much pain, and so selfish with it. He didn’t know how to make up for a slight of that magnitude. There weren’t enough words.
~*~~*~
The doctors observed keenly, their pens scratching as they took frantic notes, until a man came to remind them that the general wasn’t a patient man.  They had the body dragged out, but their spirits were high. One subject lost but such promising results.
The summer ends for Tony and the Rogers family. Winter is just around the corner and with it comes the ending of an era.
Steve's heart began to pound as he considered his next move and the consequences that might follow.
“Shh Stefen, it’s alright.” The man’s low voice managed to break through his panicked thoughts and suddenly it all came rushing back. He wasn’t a boy anymore and he wasn’t home with his caravan. He was in Salzburg, in the house he’d built for Peggy and the person leaning over him was –
It was hard for Steve to let Péter go off with them when he asked, every instinct he had telling him to snatch his son by the hand and lead him as far away from those cadets as possible. But he had no reason to refuse and knew it would only cause Péter embarrassment if he tried to tie him up with apron strings. Still he did not relax until Tony placed a hand on his back and nodded toward the other children who were quickly becoming in danger of getting lost in the crowd.
He took a steadying breath and turned to follow the hallway to the children's rooms, murmuring a quiet command to Frau Hogan to check the boys, when the monk spoke again.
“Wasn’t Poland then,” Bucky muttered, tightening the strings on the violin and saying nothing more. Stark was too nosey. “And Baka is what we used to call your grandmother James. You were very little when she came to live here. You might not remember her but she was a special lady. She loved to dance, didn’t she Tacha? Taught Péter and Tacha the Kolo, the Krakowiak, and all sorts of things.”
“We ought to go hiking again soon.” She said slowly. “The little ones need to get used to the outdoors.”
“Tony, where’s Vati?” she asked, her pink lips forming a dreadful pout and Tony’s heartstrings twisted.
Steve jerked, his body caught between flight of fight. It was Captain Khalmmer stood in the doorway. Of course. Damn, but Steve couldn't seem to be rid of the man. His throat closed, the dark thought crossing his mind that he wasn’t going to be able to escape any of them, outside of death.
“Bhut wat bout wat e’ ded!” Hammer wheezed through his bloody hands, and what was hopefully a broken nose with any luck. Tony didn’t stay to hear the lieutenant's answer.
Father had to be just as sick as Charlotte had claimed he was. Too sick to get out of bed, too sick to allow any visit but a doctor. The trouble was, Natacha knew of only one other way to make someone physically sick when you needed them to be besides the spread of germs, and that would take too long. And what if she accidently gave him something he couldn't recover from like the fever that had killed her mother?
They sang of longing and hope, and strength in the ideals they had learned in their youth.
Dagmar gestured impatiently at his own front as he explained, and Ian’s cheeks flushed red with mortification as he realized what the man wanted him to do. He looked to the wife for help, but Karlina just clicked her tongue and murmured lowly that Ian had better do what he said.
Maria thought Tony hadn’t seen the novel she’d tucked inside her lesson book (something pastel with French in the title) her focus on it intent as she slowly mouthed the words to herself. The child couldn’t even speak French! Let alone read it.
She seemed, on the surface, to be dealing with everything as best she could. But looking at her now, Tony began to rethink. Perhaps not.
That first night in the cabin with the children had not been the worst, the way Tony had expected it to be. There had been some tears and fussing after Bucky had left of course, but once Tony had gotten them out of their wet clothes and wrapped up in wool blankets – thank god there were an ample amount of them in the trunk by the bed – the children had been so exhausted and worn from the day’s ordeal that they’d fallen asleep within minutes. The following nights had proceeded along the same lines, with less wet clothing involved and a harder time for each of them drifting off when there was little to wear them out during the day.
“Well then you don’t know what you’ve got. Do your children play? There’s seven of them I assume one of them plays, you could have your own merry band of Rogers’ players. Do they sing too? All hours of the night I’m sure. It won’t be a problem, well not for me, monk and all. Up all hours anyway, midnight vespers is great preparation for overzealous opera singers,” Tony babbled and the Captain's face twitched, something unidentifiable fluttering over his blank mask. In the face of his silence it seemed that Tony’s brain to mouth filter remained as unreliable as it had ever been.
“You head back.” He instructed Grig, already walking away. There was one place Tony might go if he were in trouble and unable to go back to the house for some reason.
Susann nodded, tucking the envelope into the pocket of her apron and glanced at the remaining one curiously, but she did not press.
She turned away from him, to end the conversation but Péter couldn't let it go without trying.
"Wicked man." The apple cheeked woman on the stool to his left sniffed into her afternoon coffee with disdain. "I've always said so. I never forgot how sympathetic he was to the socialists. He was too lenient on the Schutzbund and we were fools to ignore it."
Tony stood, so fast he toppled the chair he’d been sitting in. It was a small amount over a short period of time, which meant his symptoms had manifested due to chronic exposure. That was – fuck that was still critical, but there had been successful treatments. Case studies with survivors. Too few, but they existed!
The driver went down with a couple of slugs to the chest. The soldier in the front seat was already out of the car, using the door for a shield and taking aim. Bucky ignored him.
The quiet proclamation startled a laugh out of Tony and Bruce’s smile spread wider.
“Stefen please.” Charlotte implored, drawing his attention to the hand she had on her chest and then to her softly pleading gaze. “This is not your fault. And I know how much you want to be out there, searching for him but you know you can’t be.”
The small alpine town of Siegsdorf was about an hours drive from Salzburg.  He took the same old familiar route he’d taken so many times during the early days – just after the Great War had ended. It was driving through these mountains that had made him so certain he wanted to build his home in the country in the first place.
"Have you heard from him? Recently. In the last week?!"
~*~*~
She must never know. Nobody could.
“You’re not master of anything, least of all this house.” Tony snapped in reply; his jaw clenched painfully. It was everything he could do not to jump up and stab the smug little cretin with his spoon. “I’d say you were too dumb to know it, only that jug in your hand speaks volumes.”
Stefen’s eyes followed the movement of his tongue for one drawn out moment before he raised his eyes again to look into his; and Tony only had time to shiver at the intent he saw in their depths before Stefen had a hold of his wrists and was pulling Tony’s hands away from their explorations. Stefen pushed them down into the mattress on either side of his head and Tony’s breath shuddered in his chest. He held still even when Stefen released his wrists, obeying the unspoken command for stillness as Stefen dragged a hand down Tony’s side and over his belly in slow exploration.
The need to latch onto it, to hold Ian as tightly as he could, was as fierce as it was unexpected. Under the water his fingers skimmed over the knobs of the boy’s spine, propping him up in the water.
"You must think me the worst sort of hussy."
It was like running through water, everything heavy and swamp like, distorted.
He held her as she cried and she clutched to him tightly, curling up against his chest like she had when she was Maria’s age, wishing desperately for once that it was true.
He needed to get a handle on himself, and quickly at that.
Except it wasn’t just that. It wasn’t just Tony’s genius. It was also the blood of hundreds of thousands of people. Men who would set sail on floating death traps, who would be torn apart and buried at the bottom of the ocean. Men who would take off in planes only to paint the sky with their remains. Men on the ground, bombs falling down on them like rain. Women and children too. All because one man’s mind made it possible, and another’s said the trade – all of their lives for seven – was acceptable.
“Brother Banner?” Tony tried to interject a question into his voice for appearances sake, but when Bruce looked up his worried eyes lightened with a smile. Tony smiled back.
“Dobas? He's an idiot, Steve. Who else blows a fucking hole in their side and is proud of it?”
The thing was… Stefen had risked saying such a thing in front of him. He’d known the consequences. Which meant he either had decided he did not care… or he had consciously decided to trust that Tony would not tell. And he knew he shouldn’t put his faith in such naïve hopes (no doubt brought on by his treacherously fluttering heart) but he could not forget a moment not unlike this one, when Stefen had been equally vulnerable and still willing to accept Tony’s forgiveness. Stefen had trusted him then and he was trusting him now.
“Cate Becci. Not the best student, but she’s got eyes like an eagle. She can flick a paper wad and hit a target from any seat in the room.” Tony answered with a grin, ignoring the peevish look Stefen shot him in response. “She’s a local if that makes you feel better.”
"Li' ha' eer!" Bucky's shout knocked through her thoughts like a slammed door - the door to her father's room bouncing on its hinges and coming to rest with a thud, almost not even registering - as she looked up from her knees and met his wild eyes with her own.
Bucky spit into the snow. He watched the warm saliva disappear into the mound and looked back up at the old farmhouse standing atop the hill. It already seemed to have a desolate air about it, as if the house had been changed by all that it had witnessed.
“Mio Dio.” Tony barely recognized the strangled voice in his ears as his own. His knees felt like jelly and he took a staggering step forward, bracing himself on the rail at the foot of the bed.
It was a beautiful afternoon in fall. The kind of afternoon that still felt of summer without harshness. The sky was clear and the sun was kind. A perfect sort of afternoon that even Herr Hammer’s typically prickly temperament couldn’t ruin. The state examiner had been around that morning and to no surprise at all, Péter had tested exceptionally well. A copy of his scores had been notarized and was even now on its way to the school in Geneva but as the month closed and September loomed, given how slow the post could be it was likely that the boy himself would arrive at the gates before his official documents ever did.
Steve sucked in sharply, his chest seizing.
. Tony had sent them to England because it was supposed to be safe!
“Have you ever tried?”
As he’d hoped, words that would have had Father Niklas glowering and accusing Tony of all sorts of vanity and arrogance had James grinning with a wicked sort of delight and a chorus of hesitant snickers and giggles coming from the others. Natacha was the only one who remained silent. The girl watched him with the blankest of expressions.
“Both.” Tony admitted with a pained smile. “If it makes you feel any better, I need it to be true as much as you do. My parents sent me away too when a war broke out.”
“Yes, exactly, and perhaps to the park and the opera later in the week if…”
Whether he meant to or not Cafe Mozart’s head host straightened his back with near military precision. Though Steve was sure he would have achieved full attention if his old injury would have let him.
At a much more relaxed pace Tony and the children biked along the country roads, their spirits lifted and for a time Tony thought that they were over the worst of it and had neatly avoided calamity.
Churches could be great friends to exiled kings and other men grasping for political power. Their walls kept public eyes out and whispers in.
Normally, flowers like that would snag his attention on principle but he was anxious to look for Natacha, so Tony was not paying them close attention at all. It was only the familiar dark plum coat that one of them wore that stopped him in his tracks, triggering something in his mind. He froze just beyond the door, quickly turning back around and exiting again.
”, it was easy to believe.
The table was too still and too full of glum faces. Artur was not chattering the way he usually did. Ian was staring listlessly into his bowl of oats while James leaned against his side; neither boy seeming to notice nor to care about their close proximity. Natacha was silently trying to spoon the hot oats into Sara's mouth, but the little girl kept shaking her head stubbornly until her sister gave up - no energy to fight. Maria sat beside her silent and glassy eyed, holding her spoon but not making any effort at eating. Tony's heart twisted painfully in his chest, taking in their state.
“Because she was being an ass and a girl of fourteen is perfectly capable of sitting by herself.”
If they made war with the Czechs there would be fighting in the mountains and Stefen’s men would be some of the first called out.
Tony could see two other officers coming to assist from opposite ends of the station and he clutched the papers that declared him Antony Stark, not a Jew, and tried not to get trampled in the wave of bodies moving away from the window and those quickly moving to replace them.
"And yet I was studying."
“What?”
Stark cared about them and leveled with them in a way that others didn’t. They were drawn to that, like plants to sunlight.
“She adores it.” Tony promised, taking her hand and pulling her away with him into the swirl of dancers.
Steve swiveled his glass and watched the ice swirl within. He felt the dizziness returning and shivered.  Maybe… Slowly he raised the cup to his mouth once more and sipped until a melting chip pressed against his dry lips and he parted them until it slipped inside. Khalmmer watched him intently, gaze too knowing for comfort.
Shit! He jerked back to avoid getting shot and glared over at her, communicating with his eyes that if she valued living, she’d get the hell out of there while she still could. It was her choice. The team knew that their job was to engage the enemy as long as possible, by whatever means possible. The rest was up to Bucky and he didn’t have time to babysit.
Bucky's eyes snapped to Stefen with desperate longing, his gaze piercing as if he could will Stefen to open his eyes again with his gaze alone.
The night wore on. Steve found himself drifting after a time, his hand finding his pocket where the pouch full of beads rested.
He could hear the low drum of chatter from the other occupants of the room getting increasingly louder and louder in his ear drums and his eyes frantically scanned the large room for an escape – there! A door cracked open door to a small study. He made a b-line for an empty room.
“And how did Frau Rogers feel about that?” Tony asked, softening the question with a teasing smile to let Stefen know he wasn’t judging. The gypsy way didn’t sound that far off from what any so-called civilized society thought about women and their place. Stefen chuckled, and Tony took it as a win that for once the light in his eyes did not dim when he spoke about his wife. “She said it was ballocks, and I agreed with her. If anything, my soul was the one lost. Until I found her.”
-Dachau-
When he’d returned it was with a pair of pistols, one of which he tossed to a startled Péter and the other to Tony.
Tony strolled into the music room five minutes past their usual start time after noon break, unsurprised to find his charges lined from oldest to youngest patiently in wait. As requested they were all changed from their school uniforms into their play clothes, all except for Natacha.
Nothing, as it turned out. Though Tony was sure that Stefen meant to have words with his old friend if the sudden decision to pick the clothes up himself in the morning was anything to go by.
Bucky adjusted his scope one last time and recounted his ammunition. Even if they were lucky enough to take out everyone in the first truck with the crash, the men on the ground were heavily outnumbered. They were relying on Bucky and the other snipers to pick off as many as they could from the relative safety of the trees. It was familiar territory, and though his heart sounded heavy in his eardrums it was calm, and Bucky’s hands were as steady as they’d ever been.
The hall was silent as a tomb, so it echoed like a scream when he grasped the fabric in both hands and tore it savagely in two, leaving the pieces to pool at his feet.
His traveling companion, Herr Doctor Fischer, twisted to look at him with brows arched in question. Fischer was one of those men built like trees, legs that went on for years, thick rope like fingers, strong clear-cut features set in an eerily blank face, and blessed with an natural stillness that bordered on unsettling.
Steve curled in a ball and moaned.
She couldn’t forgive him his behavior at the Berghof or his refusal to answer his summons. He’d jeopardized the entire family. They’d all pay the price soon if he could not bring himself back to reason, and this was not the Stefen Rogers she’d agreed to marry. This was madness. They all knew it. They were just too afraid to say it.
"Tony taught us a song to sing whenever we're feeling bad" said the youngest boy. Archer? Deiter didn't know what to say to that so he just hummed, hoping it didn't sound too skeptical.
She didn’t know what she was doing. Unspeakable things happened in wartime. He’d seen it up close. He’d stopped what he could and buried the memories of all that he couldn’t. She didn’t know. He’d hoped she’d never know. Control had slipped through his hands, that brutal enlightenment was coming toward them like a locomotive; but Steve would stand between her and it until he died.
“I’m not a little boy! I can help.” Ian yelled, kicking and pushing at Tony with surprising strength. The words stung, like acid thrown against the skin. Péter had said those very words. Péter who was gone. Who had been outside in that horror (because of Tony). Who could even now be crushed into the back of a cattle car on his way to anywhere, or lying in a bed of glass beneath some window.
Tony’s hand strokes down his side, and it feels so damn good Steve could groan. He does, and it earns him a little chuckle from Tony who turns his head and kisses the side of Steve’s face. Steve presses into it and lets Tony do as he pleases, enjoying the soft freedom of it all.
is no longer illegal.” Magda countered the man in a fierce tone. “Don’t be a fool!” he snapped in reply, and Steve’s heart jolted at a sudden clanging sound, his heart pounding in his chest.
“We heard the maid Bergita saying that it’s good we’re all going to Vienna because Father’s always working, and she’s right Tony. I helped Maria squeeze her teddy in his suitcase and there was nothing fun in there.” Arturbabbled, only pausing briefly to bend over when a brightly painted block fell from his arms and clattered to the floor. “Do you think he likes blocks?”
