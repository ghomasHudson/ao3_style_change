Steve sighed, gently reaching out to put a hand on the crying man's knee, as they sat cross legged facing each other.
Steve continued to watch Tony, occasionally asking questions about what he was doing, which Tony eagerly answered, giving Steve warm smiles, as he started developing a new blueprint for his redesign of the arm that would have more flexibility, be lighter, and maybe even had a computer built in that he could use to call for help if he needed it. It would be strong too because there was no doubt in his mind that having a strong metal arm would be amazing. He asked Bucky if he wanted extra features and Bucky just seemed to smile and shake his, saying something about how he just liked watching him and Steve work together. Steve had interrupted that to mention that maybe Bucky needed blasters in his hand, and Tony had quickly picked up on that until Pepper made it very clear that there were to be no hand-blasters, so he had instead decided on making it so the arm would be controlled by his brain waves. Steve seemed very interested in that, and after a long technical explanation that left him looking more confused than anything, he settled on just saying it would do what Bucky wanted like a normal arm.
The two, intertwined and close, fell asleep, and when Tony awoke a few hours later, Steve was still there, and he felt more whole than he had in awhile.
Tony had only gotten more desperate, the new order of lube and the implications it brought along with it sending him to his room to desperately hump his pillow, wishing he was fucking the other man instead of his pillow, coming shouting Steve’s name into the air, his breathing heavy as he came down from his high.
It was one of such nights, when in his turned on state, had discovered dildos, and in particular, had found a website selling avengers ones. So, mind muddled by arousal, he had bought one, in particular the iron man one, and a bottle of lube. He wasn’t sure whether he was regretful or excited by his purchase when he remembered the next morning, thankful that the package was described as nondescript. He would rather die than have his teammates know what he was up to.
As he started moving, he moved his lips to Tony’s collarbone and began biting and sucking at the skin, leaving purple and red marks that would be obvious to anyone who looked even slightly at Tony, but he didn’t care. He wanted to show the world that the smaller man was his, and nobody else could have him.
As they came down from the high, Steve pulled out and found a cloth and cleaned them both off, taking care to be gentle to Tony’s oversensitive body.
Almost everyone knew about what he had gone through a year ago, but nobody really understood. Pepper, for the most part, understood the most, but even then. Nobody had been kidnapped and tortured for three months because of their father’s wealth. Nobody had their Father sacrifice his only son because he didn’t feel like paying the ransom. In any case, they underestimated how smart he was. He had escaped, but it had taken long enough that he was permanently traumatized. Well, that was what his school-assigned therapist had said. His dad had essentially told him to suck it up.
As he walked in, he was greeted by the sight of a completely wrecked captain america, with a red and gold dildo in his ass, completely naked and covered in sweat as he lie back on his couch, eyes shut as he thrust  it in and out of him, moans and whimpers filling the air and Tony’s dick, which was already hard as he had come to Steve’s floor in hopeful anticipation, was now rock solid, a bulge appearing at the front of his pants as he raked his eyes over Steve’s beautiful form.
“So first I’m going to inject some anesthetic into your arm and neck so you won’t feel it when I insert things, and then I’m going to insert this little monitor into the top of your neck, which will monitor requests from your brain for your arm to move. Then I’m going to stitch that up, and then I’ll pull out this arm and insert the new one, and stitch that up and make sure everything is set to heal in place, okay?” Tony was happy to get off the topic and start on the surgery.
“Oh Tony, Tony, what happened dear?” Her voice was pure compassion as she sat down on the ground and pulled him into an embrace, closing the laptop and pulling the man into her lap, holding him and playing with his hair.
They left the restaurant, and when they arrived at his dorm she made sure he was in bed before she left, taking the bag of caffeine with her. He actually slept, too weak to resist the lure of finally resting, and for once the nightmares left him be.
“First let’s get you showered, okay? You go shower, and I’ll start cleaning up your room, and I’ll get you some water and food. If you take more than ten minutes I’m coming in though.” She said, stern yet lovingly as she helped him stand up and walk to the showers, grabbing his towel from his closet.
That night the others came home to find Tony sat with a sleeping Steve Rogers in his lap, head resting on his crossed legs, and Tony’s blanket across his body. Tony looked up from his work on a tablet to hold up a finger to his smiling lips, and to quietly shush the others, and they prepared dinner as Tony gently awoke the sleeping man.
It was a bad day, a day when Steve felt the mourning longing more than usual, when he, in turn, opened up to the smaller man. He quietly put down his sketchbook, and stretched out on the couch, breathing a deep breath as he tried to hold back the waterfall of emotions, and lost the battle.
“That is so cool!” Tony spoke, then remembering the comment, mentioned “Sorry” quietly, before continuing into “How does it work? Is it robotics? That’s some cool tech”
He had found himself attracted to Steve from the beginning, but ever since Steve had come to him questioning what porn was, he had been unable to ignore the images in his mind of him with his hand around his dick, and how beautiful the man would look like that. So Tony had found himself coming multiple times to that idea, hoping that nobody would ever figure out about his secret desire for his teammate.
There were still bad days, days when his mind replayed the image of Bucky disintegrating over and over again. Days when Tony wouldn’t come out of his room. Days when both of them were so overwhelmed by darkness that being next to each other felt like drowning in a sea of pain. Those days were when Rhodey took care of them both, although he was still hurting it was less so than the two of them, and he had found comfort earlier, through his work with the army. As well, seeing Tony become a bit more himself had made the darkness in him shrink slightly.
Tony collapsed on top of Steve, lips crashing together as Tony slid his hands across Steve’s chest, and he began to grind against him, dicks rubbing together as they made out passionately, tongues wrapped against each other as Steve, using one hand to continue to fuck himself on the dildo, moaned into Tony’s mouth.
The flashbacks got worse the more he thought about things, and the more flashbacks he had, the more he thought. He no longer had any alcohol and so he was essentially doomed, Stuck in an endless loop with no way of getting out.
When he got back his room was surprisingly clean, considering Pepper had only had a little bit of time to clean it, and he had created quite the disaster.
They knew he was brilliant, everyone did, Admitted to MIT at 15, of course he was. They didn’t know how stubborn he was, though. So each time he refused, each time he lashed out, each time he fought back, the pain came back. Sometimes it was water, sometimes it was knives, sometimes it was strange, experimental drugs injected into his veins, that left him screaming. After the first day, it was never loud screams. Some days there was no sound, his body worn out and giving up. Most days it was horse whispers, as he wished, hoped, even prayed to be let free of his own personal hell. It never came.
“Tash and I are going to go get breakfast, I hope you feel better Tony” With that, he heard the door open and close, and he groaned out loud.
“Well I can, in fact, be pretty cool, also I love that sort of thing so I’d be lucky to make you a new one!” He said, then thinking to the few days left of break, he spoke trying to sound neutral, although his hopes were high “Maybe we could go to the lab now if you’re not busy? So I could figure some things out and start on a prototype?”
“If you’re cool with that? I got the station all set up and got some medical stuff to make sure I don’t hurt you or damage you or anything, and I researched, even talked to my friend Bruce who’s really good with body stuff, so I think I’m good to go if you are?” He was rambling a bit, the nervousness peeking through the edges of his voice, terrified that something would go wrong.
“Yeah, he’s been acting a little weird recently though, do you know what’s up with him? Said he couldn’t come down here today, too busy with an art project, but it was odd.”
Natasha just watches, watches Rhodey try to bring him out, watches the usually sarcastic and spirited man wander aimlessly through the halls. They still hadn’t heard from Clint, and left to assume the worst of her closest teammate’s state, she was in a similar state. A trained assassin, however, built to endure the worst and keep on going, she does just that. Keep going about her life, hiding the nights she spends crying for those that are lost, and holding on to the little sanity she can. Her only comfort turns out to be Bruce.
It was an odd development, when Tony first came out of his room into the living space. The others looked surprised, but soon adjusted to his presence. He didn’t say anything at first, would just occasionally sit on the couch. In the beginning he sat as far away from Steve as he could. Tony would flinch at any movement from the older man, and although it sent a pang of regret deep into Steve’s heart, he understood. He understood that there was still time for the tension to unwind. That he was trying his best.
“Uh… thanks. For letting me hold your hand. That was really nice of you.” He says, anxiously scratching at his arm, and staring at the ground.
“Fuck.” He said, softly, as Clint snapped a photo of the two, a shit-eating grin on his face as he did so.
It was a Friday night about two weeks into the semester, and Pepper had been invited to a party thrown by someone who was apparently named Thor. An odd name, but he didn’t judge. This meant that all of them we’re going, naturally. Tony knew he shouldn’t go. He knew being surrounded by alcohol was never a good thing, and that if he fell into his old patterns he didn’t know how he’d get out this time. Pepper was getting tired, she had been so proud recently with his progress. Enough so that she was letting him come to this.
“I’m gonna… oh! I’m gonna come!” He moans out, bouncing faster and harder on Tony’s dick, each time hitting his sweet spot and sending waves of pleasure coursing through his body.
“Alright, Steve” Bucky chuckled, before returning to his conversation with Pepper, discussing a book they had both read and hated.
They get their food after a small wait, Tony eating slowly, in small bites, his body re-adjusting to eating food, and as they sat waiting for the receipt to come, Pepper pulled out her phone.
“Wha?” He said, sitting up far too fast and clutching his head, before looking over to the bed which was no longer empty and now contained two girls, one of which was definitely Pepper, and the other who was probably Natasha, judging by how the two had fallen asleep on top of each other.
“Fiiiiine,” He said, smiling fully now as he sat cross-legged, letting the warmth of her motherly-love wash over his cold, cold body.
“So good, almost there, doing so well for me” Steve moaned out, the praise sending joy throughout Tony, as his heavy breathing sent shivers down Steve’s spine and he pushed all the way in, bottoming out.
“Thank you, Tony. I’ll be there at 2:45 pm to bring you to the 3:00 pm meeting okay? I’ll take you there, so you don’t have to walk alone.” She reached out across the table and held his hands in hers, drawing her thumb across his palm, back and forth.
Steve’s eyes roamed to the pink dick sitting on Tony’s bed, and then back to the flushed, awkward man in front of him, and it clicked in his brain and his cheeks filled with pink.
“You noticed that I was drawing?” He said, blushing as he brushed the back of his neck, his smile turning slightly nervous.
Rhodey tries with no success to reach out to him, to connect to an empty shell that used to contain the spirit of his best friend, left reeling and more alone than ever because he’s lost Tony too, even if he didn’t die. That almost makes it worse.
Tony was also a curious man, but more in nosy way. He liked to know things, know what was going on around him, be aware of his surroundings. From this came him vetting everything that was delivered to the tower. Any package that was ordered by anyone on his team, he got a notification that it had been ordered. Even food deliveries, he liked to know. Almost every time he ignored the notifications, save the few times he had questioned Natasha about her knife purchases, more offended she would buy other knives outside of his own. He had been confused by a few purchases in the past, but generally didn’t pay too much attention.
“Yeah! I’d need to get Steve- He’s my roommate and best friend- first though? I kinda have this thing about going to places with new people” Bucky shrugged, but Tony could see the anxiety behind it.
“Do I have to?” He whispered, his shaking hands held together as he nervously eyed the slightly open door, covered in posters for various groups and counseling services.
“Oh, that’s cool. I’m Bucky” Bucky said, quickly trying to rectify the situation as he noticed the discomfort obvious in Tony’s body language.
Tony reached out and hugged him, a gesture they hadn’t let happen yet but one that Tony, still the overly touch striving one, knew in his heart was right. So they sat there, Steve turned to his side hugging Tony, his face in his shoulder, and Tony leaning forward, clutching on to the man, trying to send all the good feelings he could through the touch to the quietly crying man.
“We know, we’ve seen the headlines.” Interrupted someone across the room, voice dripping with cruelty and mockery.
Bucky nodded, and they began, Tony working away at replacing things and being as delicate and careful as he could, and focusing on the task at hand, glad that things with him and Bucky were okay.
“Can’t you afford something better than this? Stupid rich boy.” The voice was back, and Tony was sick of it.
Steve used his other hand to begin trying to pull Tony’s shirt off, and seeing his struggle, Tony stood up and stripped, and after frowning at the loss of the kiss, Steve quickly smiled again as he looked over the other man.
“Hi Pepper” He mumbled as she stepped in, not looking up from where he was frantically typing, his eyes bloodshot and his entire body shaking. He looked frail and weak, ¾’s of the way to passing out, and she silently thanked whatever higher power existed that she had gotten to him in time.
“Oh.” Steve paused, and continued to just stare at the man in front of him, suddenly realizing what he had just asked, before deciding to cut his losses and leave. “Alright, bye Tony!” He quickly turned around and started towards the door.
“Tony! Why are you drinking, we’ve been over this. I thought everything was going well?” She said, voice a mix of vague anger and concern.
Soon Steve was quickly thrusting into Tony, air filled with moans and expletives  as they moved together, lips crashing against each other as Tony gripped Steve’s hips hard enough to leave bruises, but neither of them cared as they were filled with pleasure. As Steve’s thrusts became erratic and even faster, pounding into Tony, he spoke.
Steve and Tony still held their special moments, as did Natasha and Bruce, and almost always the two couples made sure Rhodey was included. They would have movie nights, and they all would laugh and cry together at the movies that were almost always chosen by Tony, because although the events had taken him down a notch, he was still Tony Stark.
“Yeah, of course!” Steve said, a little too enthusiastically, as he watched Tony type away at the computer with adoring eyes that nobody could deny.
He noticed how Steve tended to disappear between team activities and missions, how he would occasionally walk sort of funny when he came from his room, and began to mentally take note of this.
He was doing just that when he found term in an article he was reading that he had no idea what meant. Instead of looking it up, however, which even he knew he could do, he had gone to Tony. Much to his later embarrassment.
“It got bad again Pep, it got bad” He whispered, tears biting at his eyes and trailing down his cheeks, following the path of many that had been there previously.
He quickly changed, not caring that he was in the same room as Pepper, who was too busy tidying up to notice. He sat down on his freshly made bed and noticed she had all of his energy-supplying instant coffee packs in a garbage bag.
“Oh good! You’re back!” She said, smiling a gentle smile at him as she picked up folded clothes off of his bed, “Here you go, so you don’t have to get back into those dirty clothes.”
“I love you too tones. You’re my strongest defender.” Came the reply, shaky through the remnants of tears.
Tony found the whole thing rather uneventful, but it wasn’t… bad. He actually found himself enjoying the comfort he found in the mixed group, with other people who had experienced similar things, flashbacks, avoidance, anxiety. The whole shebang. He found out Bucky’s story, he had been taken from an orphanage and used to experiment tech on and had lost his arm when he tried to escape, so they replaced it with the one he had now (he felt a little guilty about asking about his arm now.) Tony decided that he was going to ask about how he felt about having an arm that was given to him by someone who had been very cruel and unkind to him and whether he’d like a new one or not. The worst part of the session was one conversation that had happened when he introduced himself.
He closed the blinds, wondering why they hadn’t been closed in the first place and sat down on his floor after grabbing an aspirin and a mug of coffee, quietly waiting for the two to wake up. Then memories from last night started to come back, and suddenly he was in emotional pain as well as the physical pain from his hangover.
He went to work that night, sitting in the cafe and serving people their drinks, cashing people through, ignoring everything on his mind. Ignoring the pang that echoed through his body as he realized, while closing, that Steve hadn’t come in even when he usually did. Steve, he thought, had figured out his schedule after they became friends because he always came in when Tony was in, and his coworkers had noticed too. He figured it was just him being friendly, and feeling comfortable with someone he knew. This was the first time he hadn’t seen him during his shift, and his heart ached and his stomach tossed, both of which he desperately tried to ignore.
Steve took this opportunity to bring their lips together, tongues crashing together as the two men kissed passionately. It was intense, full of lust and arousal, as their tongues intertwined and Tony moaned into Steve’s mouth. Steve held onto the smaller man and shoved them both down onto the bed, so they were lying down, Steve on top, as they kissed and began to grind into each other.
“Goodbye Sir, nice to meet you!” The British AI returned, and Tony grinned from ear to ear as he shut his laptop.
He watched as Tony flipped through the channels, landing on a new comedy movie, in light of the tragedy that occurred many had come out, an ache for humour from those left behind. The other man placed the remote down, and sat quietly to watch the movie.
Steve and Tony had started being more functional as they sat and watched the movies. Steve would sit with a sketchbook, propped against Tony’s legs which sat across his lap, and draw piece after piece. Tony would sit and tinker with various parts, occasionally Bruce would bring him some diagrams or a problem on a tablet screen to work out, and they he would sit with his back propped up by a pillow and work. They rewatched movies, rarely paying attention to them other than to make a silly joke. As Tony began to perk up, his humour would reappear from time to time, with quiet pokes of “That’s you” to Steve when a character would do something that reminded him of the man, or even just when a character did something silly. Steve would chuckle gently, and reply “Okay Tony” With a fond smile on his face.
“Hey, hey, sweetheart, what’s wrong?” She said, pulling his face back to look at her, and he reluctantly met her eyes. “Flashbacks again?”
As the elevator door opened, he could immediately hear Steve’s moans, and his victorious pride was immediately overshadowed by the overwhelming arousal that washed over him at the noises, and as he almost turned around, he heard his name called, moaned in fact, and he knew he had to go in otherwise his dick would be screaming at him for forever.
Steve had prided himself in being strong, emotionally as well as physically, but the culling had brought that wall down, and inside a river of pain had broken through the dam he had built. However, externally, he kept a brave face although his depression habits revealed his broken state. Even with his bold face though, he couldn’t help but smile when he heard a tiny chuckle from Tony when a character in the movie fell on their face. He watched Tony more than he watched the movie, each small smile bringing him back to himself, reuniting the broken Steve Rogers with his old self.
Steve tried to ignore how it made him sad once he had a decent grasp on things, because it meant seeing Tony less. So he found things he didn’t understand, purposely explored as much as he could, so that he could talk to Tony.
“Hey Bucky, come on in,” He said, trying to keep the worry out of his voice and mind that this would be a confrontation, and instead hope this meant that things between him and Bucky were all good.
After a while, he sat up, wiping his tears away with his sleeves and looked down at his lap, feeling ashamed of his crying, raised in a generation where men weren’t allowed to be weak. Tony could sense it, and having been raised the same way and had to learn otherwise, he knew the struggle.
“Oh, yeah! That class was great.” He returned, smiling at the common interest, and they walked into the building together, continuing to chat about various classes.
He woke up with a headache that felt like it was splitting his brain in half, and suddenly the light drifting in from his window was too bright. The dull snoring of a person- two people? In the empty bed across from him was too loud, and then after a second of thinking about this, he realized that there were other people in his room.
When school started they had less time to hang out, but they still did. The group of four would work on school work together in the lab, Tony had even invested in making a sort of living area in the center, with a sofa and a table and everything. Everything was going fine, of course, ignoring his crush.
“Don’t worry, this won’t hurt. Jarvis, scan?” He said, looking up at the ceiling, which earned a grin from Steve.
So he got up, cleaned himself up, and still achingly hard from his previous activities, got into the iron man suit and set off to go fight.
He let himself be pulled towards her, too frail and weak to do anything else, both physically and emotionally.
“Tony? I’m coming in, if you’re indecent I don’t care I’ve seen most of you at this point.” Came the female voice, and Tony looked up to see Pepper enter the room.
“Hey, Tony! How goes the arm?” He said, walking in casually, relief flooding Tony’s body as he came to the conclusion this was just a normal visit.
“You know it’s not nice to stare,” The metal-armed guy said, self-consciously tucking his arm into his other, and watching as Tony’s eyes widened as it moved.
Steve, very enthusiastically, began taking strides from where he was standing to the bed, starting to undo his pants as he approached him, impatient due to his achingly hard dick. As he reached the bed, Tony reached out, still riding the dildo, to pull down Steve’s pants. As he pulled them down over the other man’s erection, it sprung out, still constrained by his boxers, but the hardness even more apparent now. He slid the boxers down to join his pants on the ground, and smiled as he saw the large dick for the first time, very happy with Steve’s size.
He began by sliding his tongue across the tip, lapping up the precome that had created a wet spot previously in the discarded boxers, and swirling his tongue around the tip, eliciting soft noises from the man above him, skillfully sending pleasure all throughout Steve’s body. Steve took the hair at the back of Tony’s head into his hand as Tony surrounded his dick in his mouth, one hand pumping back and forth at the base, and the other around his own dick, as he moved his mouth up and down on Steve’s dick, tongue moving around it inside his mouth.
“Holy shit steve-” Tony started, not sure where he was going, as he immediately drew his hand away from his crotch and instead tried to pull his t-shirt down to cover it, as if that would fix the situation.
He couldn’t help but smile as he looked at the pile of code he had created, and realized he had essentially created life. He looked at the time, and saw that it was nearing the time Pepper would show up, and noticed he still needed to get dressed.
So they arrived, and after about an hour Pepper had found a girl named Natasha who she was currently making out with, Steve and Bucky had found somewhere to sit and draw and read, respectively, and Tony, well, Tony had found the alcohol. Which really hadn’t been hard, it was everywhere to be fair, and he was the son of an alcoholic. So he sat, and he drank, and he drank, and he drank.
Tony, who had been very close to coming, had heard the alert and nearly fallen off the bed out of sheer panic, and when he realized what it was,had sighed and got up. It wasn’t necessarily that he wanted to stop, in fact if it weren’t for previous incidents where Agent Coulson had walked into his workshop to find him lying on his back, covered in sweat, furiously pumping his dick with his hand, he probably would have continued. However, he did not want a repeat of that incident.
The shower wasn’t fun. After being waterboarded while in captivity, showering had sort of lost its appeal. Yet he made it through it, made sure the water was warm before he even stepped into the stream of droplets. When he did, he focused on Pepper waiting for him, focused on his caring embrace and not the memories that fought for control of his mind, that fought to be the primary image in his broken brain. He thought that even if he did collapse, if something happened, Pepper would come to get him and it would be okay. He would be okay. Pepper was here now and he would be okay.
Tony, fuelled immensely by the praise, moved himself so the dildo sat on his bed, and began riding it as he had been before, sinking down quickly, and rising up again just as fast.
“Oh Tony, did you confess your feelings to Steve?” She said the sympathetic tone he knew so well appearing in her voice, as she sat beside Natasha to face him.
“Yeah! Sorry about calling you the art guy, I just always see you drawing and I didn’t know your name.” He smiled back as he fidgeted with his hands nervously, as they entered the room.
“Yeah. Thanks Steve.” He said quietly, wiping the tears from his eyes with the blanket he was wrapped in, and pressing play on the movie as he turned back. It was a slight movement, one that was pressed forward by the post emotional breakdown high, as he leaned his head against Steve’s shoulder, but an important one nonetheless.
Steve lined himself up with Tony’s hole, and began to push inside, Tony moaning at Steve’s size as he was filled up fully.
“Oh uh, thanks” Steve was now blushing and simultaneously grinning like an idiot, and Tony had to say, it was the best thing he’d seen in a while.
Rhodey brought home a girl named Carol, and they all clapped for him because they were so proud of him finally letting himself be more than just their caretaker.
After a few minutes of this, he pulled his fingers out, and picked up the already lubed dildo, and starting with the tip, began to push it into himself. He could feel the burn as it stretched him out, loving the feeling of being full as it slid into him, and he couldn’t help the small gasps and moans. As soon as he pushed it into himself fully, he began thrusting it into himself quickly, finding the right angle quickly, from experience, his noises resounding around the room.
That night he sat in his room, finished all of his work, and daydreamed of the art guy, which he had begun to refer to him in his head as. Of course, he also had a bottle in his hand, because otherwise, the thoughts would catch up to him. Technically he was supposed to be at home right now, as today was the end of their first semester of the year, but he liked to stay in his dorm over the short break. His home was too rough, and he could just as well visit tomorrow. He knew that he probably wouldn’t, but in his mind, he made the resolution to at least call his mother. As he programmed his newest project on his floor, he heard a knock at his door.
“Most all ribs broken, nose broken, a vertebra cracked, knee popped, some internal damage…but as you can see his healing is progressing wonderfully. The doctors are telling me they want to keep him in this coma at least until tomorrow. Just to give his body the fair shot of recuperation.” Pepper nodded to herself as she read over the notes. “But given the advancement and safety of the Tower we’ve been given permission to bring him home tonight. We'll just reduce the intake of necessary medicines tonight and he should be waking up tomorrow evening. The doctors are all supremely optimistic that his physical injuries will have little to no appearance or lasting affects in just a matter of weeks.”
, if that makes it any better. I still think an idiot considering a lot of your choices. Of course,” his fingers dipped into the hem of Steve’s pants and he laughed softly when the man’s stomach twitched and Steve gave a little noise of surprise, “I am an idiot myself.”
“You don’t want to have sex.” Tony said as if it were the most ridiculous and surprising thing he had ever heard.
“Hmph.” Tony clung tightly to the man and gave a pitiful glare to the red-head. “I wanted you to keep Steve company--”
“I see…” He looked towards his adopted son, staring with mixed longing and loathing at the image before him. Of the beautiful man turning from him to choose another. “Your bride does not seem pleased with the situation.”
Steve tilted a brow, chuckling to himself, as he finally took a sip of his drink. “If you can beat him,” Steve motioned to Thor, “maybe eventually you can take Natasha on. Might be a good training. Protect your food.”
This is heavily inspired by the wonderful You_Light_The_Sky, michi_thekiller, and angelblack3, all of who are part of
“You’re far too light. I just want to make sure you don’t faint from getting your first taste of food.”
Tony cornered him against the wall, pressing Steve close, kissing the life out of the gorgeous younger man.
“People who look like they should top but really need a collar on in bed.” She shrugged. “We like to control and dominate. It makes it even better when the person is hot but does cute things.”
“Meh. You’re a big boy. You can handle the bite. Two,” she held up two fingers, “we always find a way to out weird ourselves. Don’t think this is it, this is insanity, because something will happen to make you eat those words. We were all surprised for about five minutes when Tony said he had you; the supposed dead original super-hero, alive, pristine at the age of twenty-six, after being frozen in ice for seventy-years thanks to a blue glowing rock that Nazis wanted. We blinked and it passed cause something else is going to come along.”
It has been a long time coming for an update but here it is! I needed something in my life after Endgame because no. Just no. Did I mention no? Because no. All the no to that no.
Something still did not seem quite right in the formation. It was like there was still something missing to the house. Some corner still under the shadows.
“Apparently we’re their,” he held up his fingers to quote, “ultimate ship. They’re going to interfere as much as they want.”
His eyes took a small glance over to the right side, almost empty save for the small circular pattern in rich gold, nestled under his hip-bone where the socket was. Under that were two dates he swore to never forget.
Steve gulped and something started to coil around his heart. Fear, he realized, was making his instincts itch. Something was wrong. Very…very wrong.
Steve looked thoughtful and then nodded. It sounded fair. He certainly did not want his first excursions out into the new, modern world faced with constant interruptions and forced to meet people. Steve liked people just fine…on his own terms and when he’d be able to go hide in a corner and draw afterwards. Too many people gave him a headache.
Steve tilted a brow with an impish grin, “Really? Oh sorry about that. I was going to offer to help with the problem that is pressing against me, but since you’re just being supportive and not starting something, I’ll get going.”
“It is when a family like that was in it.” Sam no longer appeared comfortable over the topic and Steve decided to change it, heeding the warning of sharing kindness to earn it.
Tony bounced on the balls of his feet. His stomach was in knots and he was nauseated. He was frantically counting the time without meaning to and had checked his watch more times than necessary. It had been approximately 251 seconds since they landed on the off-site medical bay of what formerly belonged to the old-S.H.I.E.L.D. Instantly, after touch-down, they were ushered into an elevator and were presently dropping down seven floors to the private ward where his prize awaited him.
Bruce groaned in misery. “Seriously, I could be watching videos of pandas versus nannies. Why am I here if just to be tortured?”
“Thank you.” Tony smiled and he gave a kiss to Steve’s brow. “I’ll tell you about it soon. Tonight, where it’s…easier.”
Steve tried not to whimper and ran a hand through his blond hair. It stuck up adorably afterwards.  “Why do you do that?”
Most just wanted to pretend it was all goodness and heroics and hope that merciless intensity, the infamous wrath, did not set its sights upon them.
“Mine, mine,” Tony said in a mantra. His fingers digging deep into Steve’s hips as their skin slapped against one another. It made such a memorable sound in their bedroom as the bed squeaked in retaliation of the brutal pace Tony had set. “Mine.”
do that to him.” Tony sounded insulted. He sounded angry. He sounded like the bringer of destruction.
With a growl, he stood straight, ready for an attack from the shadows. “I am not too interested in games with a figment of my imagination.”
That certainly was a pleasant thing to see. Josh hoped he could soon put far more happy ink on the Captain’s skin soon.
Closing his eyes, he sighed. ‘No, don’t. A right sulk will not do me any good. We know what to expect and that’s enough to survive. I’ve survived through mama’s death. I’ve survived Brock. I’ve survived Pierce. I can survive this. But I won’t if I do this. So, stop it.’
It was dark and powerful and rolled around Steve like thick, drowning honey. He felt suffocated and his heart squeezed.
Steve nodded slowly and sighed when Tony’s hand found its way around his waist again. Part of Steve really wanted to pull away but there was still something he really liked about being touched. It felt nice to know there was someone there and he was not lost in his head again. He also felt unsure about shrinking away from Tony. It felt rude after all he had done and, Steve couldn’t quite put his finger on what or why, dangerous.
“This gentleman is, unfortunately, low on the bar. He doesn’t know much but some rumors about his clients--”
“We’ll need to go over it in some more detail but…yes, I…I want to dominate you.” Tony continued, pushing himself closer to Steve. “I want…god, Steve…”
Wanda pulled back and brought her book back up as if to make a wall. “There was talk since over a hundred years ago that a woman in Pennsylvania gave birth to her thirteenth child and it was a devil. Perhaps we have our own devil here.”
Steve nodded and swallowed thickly. He wanted so desperately to know where here was but he could not get his mouth to keep up with his head.
Steve looked around some more and despite the limited vision he found there was simply too much to see. The proof was all around him and it made him see spots.
Wanda’s eyes brightened, “Clever code. Yes. I think it’s fair not to too. Names are powerful tools for those in the other realm. It’s why you never hand your own out freely in all the stories. Its name has apparently been said before and unusual and unsettling things happen. So far, nothing deadly, but enough to keep everyone unsettled.”
Nodding to himself, Steve walked around the penthouse as the idea took over his head. Acting as a bodyguard would be the perfect way to express his gratitude and provide something for Tony back.
“Often. Especially when I was a kid.” Steve reached up to do the same with Tony’s face, his gaze of pure adoration. “I had a lot of ailments. And I was a piss-poor patient. I drove ma crazy.”
“Like I want anything from your employers’ pathetic stash. None of them have any sort of taste. And,” he spun Steve towards him, pressing the smaller man against his side as he wrapped an arm around the small waist. “You’re
.” He begged, truly worried if he did not rest he could pass out the next day. “There is so much work tomorrow. I don’t want to feel all of this any more.” The aches and empty belly felt like they were gloating over how they were stealing away his only time to rest. “Please, just let me sleep.”
Steve shuddered. That had been a very different nightmare. He could’ve sworn he had been fully awake at the time. Swore he could feel the lips and words up against his skin. Something grainy in feel, like the texture of a beard, had grazed against Steve.
“God fucking dammit Steve!” Tony snarled and maneuvered himself around to get Steve facing him. “This isn’t about some heroic deed that’s part of my role as Iron Man. This is about my feelings for you, your feelings for me, and my continuous effort to keep you at arms’ length away despite you clearly making multiple attempts, in your own adorably awkward way, to get close.”
“Well, ta-da.” He motioned, hiding the fact that he was fighting a painful hard-on and desperate need to push Steve against something and bring them to an amazing, painful climax.
His breathing started to ease as he blinked, blearily, around his dimly lit room. Everything within it was still and relatively empty. Untouched.
Steve floated in front of him, grinning in mischief. "When are you coming back to see those activities begin?"
Howard caught him and, for a brief moment, Tony thought the anger would finally unleash and he’d finally hit him. But it passed and then something sad took its place. “You’re not allowed in here.”
The final one he saw was Steve starring straight at the camera, brow tilted, and an amused smile on his face. Tony had found himself already obsessed with that smile. “Really?”
Tony's lips trembled with another smile. Laughter and acting out looked good on Steve. He rarely let his guard down so much with Tony. He felt there was something more than an instinctual fear, which Tony could not fault Steve for, but it still stung at Tony’s core to see Steve smile so freely with another.
Steve just watched her pull out the Tupperware and began to consume the left overs he made without any care or permission. She found the sodas and then hopped on the counter with the meal in her lap and looked at him.
“Because I like it…you feel perfect under me.” And then he moved in such a sinful way that made Steve gasp, starring at him with wide eyes. “Oh…yes, I like that a lot.”
Steve flushed and then laughed when Morgan started to pull at his pant leg, wanting attention. Big brown eyes looking to get an ice-pop for her breakfast fruit rather than the freshly cut melons prepared on the counter.
“That’s no black eye! That is a mess of green and agony!” Clint gaped, still trying to catch his breath and his throat to work properly again. “What the hell?! What the fucking hell?!”
“You ever go to bars and start a competition you know you can win?” By the glint in Steve’s eye it was clear he had done exactly that. Both Natasha and Tony looked at him with some open awe. “I only did it once. And it was a quick undercover op. I swindled Nazis.”
“Tony,” Steve whined, arching against him. He grabbed Tony’s face and kissed him hungrily, somehow knowing exactly what to do and say, “Put one in me, please.”
The doors were opened for him by more of his father’s, now his, loyal subjects and he sauntered in like he owned the place. And well, he did. He owned all of it.
I hope I won't be long for the next update--be it this story or another!! Thanks to everyone sticking around!
Steve could not help but hug the sketchbook to his chest. He wasn’t aware that he was rocking back and forth. It broke Tony’s heart. One he could have sworn had withered to a burnt core before he was twenty.
“Now, don’t reject a compliment, dear heart. And do not pull away from me.” Tony’s grip tightened slightly, a warning, and smiled pleasantly when Steve stilled. “Good boy. You follow directions well.”
Tony held up his hands “Apologies. I do appreciate your consideration and need to defend my honor. Truly. It just came as a surprise that one of your kind, and one of your stature, felt the need to protect me.”
“You will need to teach your bride better. Had he learned to not fear his own wants he might have handled his first selfish encounter better.” He gave Tony another pat, “Sometimes being too good has its drawbacks. Your bride meant you no harm, heir, he was just blinded by what he had been told was good. He was crushed by it.”
“The fuck you doing with a salad?” Tony came over and looked at the open carton of food and huffed. “And from Applebee’s? Really? You have a couple of million in your bank account and I can’t drag you away from mediocre chains to save my life.” Tony still took a generous bite of the chicken salad, picked at it for a bit, and then took another bite. He wished he could’ve had more time to wake up and enjoy Steve’s breakfast but stealing food from Clint would have to do.
All around him buildings towered over like giants. It was early evening so there was a bright glow to the buildings. They actually glistened. Even though they were so high up he was still surrounded by noise of cars and people.
“Isn’t that sweet.” Tony made another grab, gaining victory in yanking Steve’s hips and thighs back to him. “And Nat, keep the jabs to a minimum. I’m sure you’re eager to see Mean Green in all his glory but I’d like to keep this floor looking like I paid nearly two-hundred-thousand for it.”
“I knew you were better.” Tony said, surprising himself when he sounded a little panicked. “Just that you were still…normal.”
He grunted and went in for another kiss but felt his body buck a bit and heard his name echoing in the back of his head and he groggily reopened his eyes, finding him in his bedroom at New York, not in California, and he was sprawled on something not a mattress but was very, pleasantly warm.
“Most leaders have to suffer some political headaches, my friend.” Thor chortled. “You were most fair even when you could’ve used force. A strong start to what I hope is an everlasting reign. Be proud of your accomplishment and how easily you vanquished your foes!”
Perhaps he should find something creepy about the attic right at his feet…but he’d rather have it than a basement. There was one of those too, but it was much smaller than the house and the access to it was boarded up. Pierce figured it was a wine cellar of sorts and was eager to find a way in but agreed bedroom fixings came first.
“Well, that may be a place to start.” He muttered. It would be best to make sure the roof wasn’t about to collapse on them during the night.
Bucky just glared at Steve who was providing him a very smug and pleased smile. Life certainly was easier when he was Black Widow's favorite person. "I don't like being my girlfriend's second favorite."
It came as a surprise to Steve since it had been Tony’s goal to become a couple from, apparently, the beginning. He hadn’t expected any sort of breakfast-in-bed-treatment, that would’ve been far too much fluff for him to handle anyway, but Steve had expected and wanted
“Then you look after me. But I’ve had people look after me, I didn’t handle them well, but I’ve had people…I’ve been asked after, checked in on…I had parents, friends…yes, I’ve dealt with miserable, selfish assholes but there have been others.” His hand stroked over the shape of Steve’s face. “When was the last time someone asked you how you were doing, how you were really doing?”
“But not of a human father.” Tony finished. “But not quite half…mother did make a deal so there was already magic before my conception. Then my true father gave me a name. As you know, words are powerful in my kind.”
“Of course! Power and immortality comes at a price and my folk are bound by unfortunate circumstances that make it difficult to just live outside of glamour without invitation.” He sulked. “A mind like mine needs a little more sustenance than endless parties and repetitive riddles that take place in-between the shadows. Your kind can be so entertaining…so many puzzles and theories on just how far you’ll go to get something like wealth or a lover. It’s amusing.”
“What?” Bruce pressed, unsure he really wanted to hear any more. Nothing that came out of the man’s mouth was right. It was no longer their Tony Stark in that body.
“Then don’t.” Sam truly hoped his stupidity was not about to earn some terrible punishment. “Include him on some more things and I think you’ll both be rewarded.”
“I can’t help that you’re so cute when you get flustered.” Tony purred. “A compliment gets you all squirming. How do I resist?”
“Here” Tony came back and handed over sketchbook and charcoal. “I’ve got good resources that tell me you like to draw.”
“Good luck in getting him to be as bad as you.” Clint huffed, now stacking the cookies into a Tower, looking tempted in stuffing them in his mouth. “And if you dip that in your coffee I’ll gag.”
Steve grinned back as his heart flipped. He could handle a week. It would be rough but he handled tougher points in his life with far less cushion.  He shook Tony’s hand eagerly. “Deal.”
The honesty was appreciated though it made him cold. It was a concern that he would never get better. That there was a wrong future looming before him and he’d always mess it up. How was he supposed to do it right? He was a young man born in poverty and illness. He grew up in war and with death and hunger as constant companions. He was missing over seventy-years of history and culture. How was he supposed to live honorably with wealth, peace, and ignorance?
“Ok. You’re right. I hate to admit it but you’re right.” He stuffed his hands into his pockets. “Steve shouldn’t have to suffer because the world has changed. I’ll talk to him about things. Sound good?”
Taking a break from eating, Pierce’s hand lounged against his cane, stroking it gently. “What else?”
His head was swimming…it was true he hadn’t slept, really at all, in the past two weeks and serum or not, that was not do-able. But before that, year prior, he began to lose sleep when Peggy was buried and the Accords sprung up and Bucky returned and Siberia…
“Would never.” Tony raised his arms in surrender. “But yeah, he does look rather sad…damn, I had hoped he was like me and got sexy angry with jealousy. But of course not, he has to break my heart looking like that.”
“I-I don’t know! I mean, I think you do b-but if you have been…I-I don’t know abused or-or cruelly treated or--”
“Oh.” Steve repeated again and touched his own lips in confusion. They tingled and burned. He worried he smelled of garlic and sauce, that he had just stood there dumbly and appeared like a slow-witted fool. What would Tony think of him when he couldn't even respond to a kiss properly?
Steve held out his arms to keep balance after he found one that was solid. It was almost like walking on a tightrope and he had to laugh a little. Many days he imagined himself bigger, healthier, who could do many fantastic things with his body that he could star in a circus. Hidden away with others who did not quite fit in and he would be able to pretend he could fly.
Tony sighed, instantly knowing what the idiot was focusing on. “Love, seriously? I’ve been trying to keep my fingers from going down the backside of your pants since we’ve first met. I’ve just spent the better part of fifteen minutes chewing you out because I hate how you allow yourself to suffer. I’m here lecturing you because of romantic feelings. I bit you just a few moments ago, holding myself back from doing worse. What?” He deadpanned, “Did you think that was a friendship bite?”
“Steve,” Tony’s tone was sharp, though his eyes were still soft as he gazed over Steve with open adoration. “Behave. You say
“I am a, a servant for the new family that moved into the manor up the road.” He paused to notice any reaction. The woman’s eyebrows rose in interest while her lips eased in their frown. Nothing too terrible then. “I believe I’ll be the one doing most of the repair work. Do you happen to know if there are any blueprints that I could study today and in the near future?”
The tone did something to Steve’s stomach and he swore even his thighs jumped at the vibrations. There was such a tingling sensation ripping through his skin and he found he couldn’t use his own voice for a few moments.
Tony took them down to another level of what Steve had come to realize was a massive tower. Tony owned all of it too. The particular level was where he took care of some business, he had explained. It was where his “public” office was. Well, one of them. Apparently he had about three offices in the tower, one private up in his quarters, one semi-private where he met with only special clientele, and one public where he carried standard meetings. It was a lot of offices to have in one building and Steve could not help but wonder what special clientele meant but didn’t question it.
Shaking his head, he eased back against the counter, and sighed. ‘Not even a week and I’m already going insane? Seems a tad unfair.’ He shook his head again, maneuvering his shoulders too, to try and shake off the sense of discomfort.
“I want to decide what you do, where you go, what you eat, who you talk to…I want to control all of it.”
“You are correct that training you as I did my daughters would not be right. This age is ideal given your experience.”
“And I love that you are such an adventurous slut.” He grinned, laughing when Steve pinched his side in good humor. “Sorry, sorry…but things like that, you know? I still feel bad I brought some dirty talk in before bringing it up with you.”
Steve huffed, doing his best to ignore the jab at his height, “Anyone can need, and deserves, protection.”
“Don’t get eager to bite at the bait, Steve.” She said, using his name in such a personal manner. “There is a lot going on with this town and your home. Starve your curiosity and focus on bettering your life.”
“Hmm?” Tony groaned against the back of Steve’s shoulder. He was not ready to wake up from a dream that soft and nice.
Steve threw him a false annoyed look, his lips twitching as he rolled up his blue sleeves and approached the dormant Mjolnir. Everyone quieted down when the hammer briefly moved before Steve stepped back, holding up his hands in surrender. Thor laughed and Steve and Tony clinked their beers in a mock toast over their failure.
He’d need to make the room Steve awoke in dark but not too dark, an unassuming dim to not hurt his eyes and not make him believe he was trapped. The room should not have anything too scarily obvious in advancement but they did not want Tony to hide things from Steve either. The room should be slightly warmer since it was likely his mind may wake up believing he was still in the submerging aircraft. Tony would need to speak softly and slowly and with a lot of patience. But don’t treat him like a slow-witted fool, they had warned him.
Keep on the look out for more updates and more Stony stories! I have another Dark!Tony one in mind I hope to get done!
Steve didn’t mind the old bedroom he was given, in fact, it was not as dreadful as he imagined it would be. In truth, the whole room was nothing too terrible. It had been grand once and was hidden away on the third floor rather than with the rest on the second. Although not as large or traditionally shaped as the other bedrooms it was private and personal. Right across his entry-door was the eye-window, so when he stepped out each day it was the first sight in view, and the room had a personal window that looked out into the woods.
Groaning, he scrubbed his hands over his face and tried not to let out a too loud displeased noise. It still sounded empty in the house, but with one so large it was impossible to know for sure, but the chances of any other resident up before official dawn was rare, if next to impossible unless there was business afoot. And given that Pierce would not look to start up a new trade system until perfectly settled in…there was very little chance Steve was late to start his chores.
"Tony, seriously." Steve rubbed his face. "Burgers again? You need to think about your health more."
“Is that jealousy I hear, you harlot?” He grinned, clearly trying to shrug off the emotions overwhelming him.
“Jesus.” Steve groaned, covering his face with his free hand, still carrying the drink, as Natasha sat him back down. He then looked her over up and down. “You strength is impressive.”
“Ok, so that’s noted…come on and show me your blueprints,” he pointed to their whiteboard they liked to word and number vomit their ideas on. “I get the feeling you already have an idea on these monster rats. Show me the crazy.”
“Will do, Brucie-bear.” Tony said. “Leave them by the door and keep in the back. I won’t check in again till their silent for you.”
“Not…not always.” Tony seethed, his body hot. His anger was overwhelming as a new memory came up. Steve limping and bloody as he turned away from Tony’s fallen form to go pick up Bucky. Terrile loathing consumed him and he snarled at the image and the brunette. Something spiked within him and more pain shuddered through his body.
Tony went back to hungrily kissing him, his fingers dancing over the button of Steve’s jeans when Steve pulled back. “If you actually have a way to produce lube from that thing I’m leaving.”
"Right? Man, this piece of sparkly shit has been haunting my dreams ever since I got your ass in my chair. What could I make for the Avengers? The saviors of the world? The sexy of sexiness? It needed to be simple...but epic...include everyone but not be overwhelming. Something with some..." he acted like he was sprinkling salt, "BAM."
“You’ve just lost a lot of things, Steve. Things even with all my smarts and knowledge I just can’t get back for you. And I am sorry about that.” His tone and expression, how heavy and hurt it looked, made Steve believe he truly was sorry for this fact. “But at least I can provide you some things you love. You’ll have plenty more than that to look forward to.”
Tony reached up and kissed Steve’s mouth tenderly. “No beatings. Plenty of insults that he’d argue were to make me stronger. Did a number on my insecurities there for a while, but hate to admit it,” he shrugged, “I am where I’m at today because of it. I’m not grateful for it, not saying that, but at least I got something.”
“Yeah, money can do that.” Tony smirked. “So, let’s get started. We all at least want this Avenger tattoo on us today. I’ll talk with dollface here and get him set-up for another appointment once we decide what he’ll get.”
“Yeah,” Steve leaned back into Tony’s hold, his back pressed against Tony's firm chest. “I can tell. Thank you for showing it to me.”
“My inventions. Things my head just can’t stop producing. Many things came from after,” he tapped his chest where the arc was, “and I felt this overwhelming need to create things that protects.”
“I was attacked. I’ll fill you in on details another day. But I had shrapnel penetrate my chest. I need this,” he tapped the item gently. “To live. Amazing, huh?”
“As you already know, you’ve been hired by myself but I still want you to properly meet my Steve before we proceed with anything else.”
After a few seconds of walking, Steve found himself in a new location. Although he had been in the tower for a few days, except for the gym and kitchen, Steve had yet to really look around his new home. It was a hallway to the stairs heading to the other levels. So far, Tony had kept him using the elevator as a precaution but Steve had known there were stairs available. It was exciting to see another layer to this palace.
“Call it one of my good hunches. Besides, I am a genius but even I'm not qualified for Steve's recovery." It burned his tongue to admit it. "I needed someone close to Steve instantly for healing. I was desperate. I’m not desperate to see him outside these walls just yet.”
Tony’s face melted into a love-sick grin. “Then I need to prepare! Give me just a sec sweetcheeks,” he gave Steve a spank as he walked past him. “I’m going to make a few calls and decide on food. You have suggestions, darling?”
“He didn’t see anything at first. But he did not like it.” Her smile fell. “He is a trickster but he does
Tony eagerly followed after, not able to be far away from the perfect man for a few seconds. “Well I created them, love. I can do that…you know you are sleeping with a genius.”
“Almost…not done. You have to know…” He could not hold on much longer. Steve was so tempting…but he had to hear the agreement. He had to know what he was feeling was ok. And the one that weighed over him with the most discomfort needed to be shared…Steve needed to know this side of him.
Tony groaned inwardly when Steve walked in those jeans and tank. This man was going to be the death of him. “Hey there Cap.” He said, getting back to what he was doing
"Good" he breathed, sucking and biting his way down until he was parting Tony's cheeks, a dry thumb slipping over his hole. Tony reacted to each bite and touch, pressing back against Steve’s thumb to get closer. "So gorgeous" he bent to lick a wide swath over Tony, moaning.
“S-shit” Tony murmured with another moan, arching and grinding back harder after feeling that Steve was obviously hard. Steve couldn’t help himself, pinning Tony's shoulders down lightly as he rocked his hips down, grinding his hard cock between Tony's ass cheeks as much as he could with pants in the way
“Mhm” tony hummed, licking his lips and still fighting his body’s urges, he was not about to get hard with Captain America straddling him.
Steve was instantly at his side, looking over the damage while Clint chased down the cyclist that had clipped Tony. "Shit, Tony." He cursed softly, wincing. "That looks dislocated."
"Yes, chick, mother hen will let you work again" Steve snarked playfully, a grin on his face. Tony grinned happily, stretching his arm and shoulder properly. "Go slow for today, though, ok?"
"No. No. No." tony mumbled "It hit you too? Are you okay? I thought I'd saved you." He asked worriedly.
“You are welcome, sir.” The AI replied “Sir. There is food in the common area kitchen.” He informed tony helpfully, leaving out the fact that Steve had cooked it.
Tony screamed out with each thrust, tumbling over the edge, coming with a cry of “Steve!” Clenching down hard around the super soldier.
"Sure. It’ll keep as well, if you end up not wanting any tonight" he assured the genius. Tony sat and talked to Steve for another hour or two before they went their separate ways for the night.
Steve put bites and sucking kisses all the way up Tony's chest and neck to his ear. "I'll make you forget everything but my name."
"Hey Tony" Steve smiled, heading over. "So, where you want me" Tony’s brain went over a thousand places he’d like to have sex with Steve in his workshop. Most were not very safe places for those type of things. Tony just cleared his throat and pointed to the couch in the corner, fighting his blush down.
"Then obviously you've not had a proper fucking" Steve grinned, eyes darkened even as he forced himself 'down'
Tony blushed even more. He wasn't used to someone just being this out right affectionate with him. "Promise." He said with a small smile.
Tony had gone up and taken a shower and gotten redressed, this Time in just pajamas and a tank top. He then came down for his coffee. "Morning Cap." He said with a friendly grin as he started the coffee pot. Steve grunted, still upset that he was apparently just another notch on Tony's belt. He did, however, still cook for the genius, sliding the plate in front of him. Tony said his thanks, nibbling a little at his food before heading back down to the lab. Once in the elevator, he let himself fall back against the wall of it with a sigh. Did Steve regret it? Is that why he seems so upset? Tony shook his head, exiting the elevator and beginning to work again.
Tony sighed, leaning into the touch. "I couldn't let you re-live going into the ice, or losing Bucky." He said quietly. "I could handle Howard one more time."
"Tony!" Steve cursed, bolting after him. He barely managed to squeeze past the doors to the lab before they closed.
slowly, emphasizing what he really meant to Steve and just confusing Tony. “I can do it,” Tony said forcefully.
Steve quickly walked into his room, closing the door with his foot. "Like a little handling, babydoll? "
"Maybe, but I did it anyway" he smirked, quickly grabbing Tony's favorite mug, making his cup the way he preferred before setting it in front of the lump that Tony was imitating.
Tony drug himself into the common area, yawning and half awake, searching for coffee as usual." Morning Cap." He greeted sleepily.
"Sure. I'll help you with the heavy stuff." Steve smiled, standing to stretch before quickly changing into a pair of almost ratty jeans and a tank. Clothes he wouldn’t care if they got covered in grease and oil.
"C’mon" Steve nodded, smiling. "Let's head to the training rooms,” he said, leading the way. Tony let out a shaky breath and nodded, following Steve to the training room
Steve smiled; his voice soft. "Just like that. You don’t have to worry about the head, I just didn’t want you hurt."
"Bullshit" he snorted. "What can I do to help you here? I know if I leave, you're going to hide for days and I won’t have you back to those self-destructive eating and sleeping habits
"I dont. I was very hurt when I woke up to you gone. Especially when you acted like nothing had happened" Steve explained.
Steve stayed on the couch for the rest of the day. It wasn’t until dinner that he stood, going up to Tony "c'mon Tony, let's get some food in you"
Steve tossed his head back to laugh. "Think I could pull off the frilly apron?" He grinned as he turned back to the waffle machine, absently checking the strawberry compote he was making as well as the bacon.
"I don’t want you hurt! You don’t even know how to throw a proper punch, how to hell do you and Fury expect you to stay alive out there!?" His voice took an almost panicked edge.
Steve laughed. "Sleep well, chick" Tony half ass saluted as he reached the elevator and headed for his floor. Steve let out a slow breath Relaxing.
“Because I’m tired of listening to you two arguing. And I am doing it. You can’t stop me.” Tony said with determination.
"Tony, what the hell, you lived through all that but you couldn't let it hit me?" Steve was bewildered, hugging Tony tightly.
Steve slicked up his fingers, forcing Tony's legs into a wider spread. "Fuck babydoll, look how pretty you are all spread out for me"
Tony swallowed hard “I didn’t think you would.” He lied easily with a shrug. “Could you just teach me a few basics?” He asked hopefully, trying to veer the conversation away from the way he’d reacted.
"I'm too tired to yell" he admitted. He hadn't been sleeping well. "I just...I don't want to be a one night stand "
Tony dozed, but Tony being Tony he couldn’t sleep. The genius slipped out of Steve’s hold and grabbing his clothes and throwing them on haphazardly before heading down to his lab to tinker with his latest project
Tony let out a soft moan, shivering at the feeling of Steve’s breath on his ear “Id like that” he murmured without even thinking.
Tony ate good, leaning back in his seat with a groan “I’m stuffed, that was great Steve, thank you.”
"Mmm, I won't for now," Steve said. Tony made a happy noise, shifting a little to get more comfortable and Steve kept up his motions, rocking into each rub as he found another knot.
Tony blushed at the show of affection, detangling himself from Steve "Stop." He whispered, blushing more.
Steve moved, guiding Tony's arm to stretch out. "Keep your stance solid, one foot behind the other just a bit. Arm level with your shoulder, just like this, turn your shoulders into the punch for extra force." He carefully and slowly guided Tony into what would be a hard, firm punch, a smile on his face. "Keep your other fist decently close to your head so you can block anything they throw"
"You did. I'm okay. But when I had touched you I got sucked in too. I saw you watching your memories."
"Copy". He said quietly, placing the last one of his devices. The genius then looked up and his breath caught, Steve was turned, back to the alien, fighting off one of its minions. It was like it happened in slow motion "Steve!" He yelled the monster was already revving up to hit him with that damn ray. His outburst startled the monster along with Steve, causing the thing to turn quickly to find the voice, shooting and hitting tony with the ray. With a yell, he collapsed to the ground.
“Fine Fine.” He said placatingly “You’re welcome to watch me work,” he said with a shrug, getting up and walking towards the elevator. He usually didn’t want people in his lab. They usually worked in Bruce’s lab when they collaborated, but he has a feeling Steve being there wouldn’t bother him.
"Arch your back for me, doll, lift that delicious ass, show off." Tony did as he was told instantly, arching his back and spreading his legs a little more
There was something warming about that. Tony apparently really looked after the people he cared for.
The first time, Tony hated how easy it had been to just strike the insubordinate down. He had vomited after the fact, in the privacy of his own room, but he could never figure out if it was due to the killing itself or how he had found he didn't hesitate. Steve would've hesitated. Steve wouldn't have done it to begin with.
“Yes.” Tony reached over and gently took Steve’s hand. “But I’ll need you to listen to me out there. It may be really overwhelming.”
All of this felt obvious but Tony made sure to have everything written down and prepared for Steve’s awakening.
“Eventually, we’ll adopt…and before, and after, we sign the papers, I will need to bury myself in you, rut into you like an animal, because I’ll be fulfilling something primal and desperate in me,” he hungrily licked his lips, sweat beading at his neck, “and I’ll be able to blissfully imagine that I put that child in you.”
“Please take a seat, Mr. Wilson.” Tony leaned back in his chair and gave Sam an unimpressed stare. It brought the temperature of the whole room down.
“That’s impossible. I’ve hacked into all the government’s databases and didn’t find anything that would possibly allude to Hyrda still kicking.”
“I could get used to ruining you, babe.” Tony kissed him, laughing when Steve pulled back. “It’s fine, doll. There is something attractive about going after your mouth knowing what you just swallowed.”
This man, Howard’s son, apparently wanted to woo him. Perhaps. He still was not sure of the extent of this liking. Steve wasn’t sure if he was ready to hear about it either.
“Afternoon boys,” Natasha greeted as she sauntered in with her sports bra and tight leggings that did wonder for her form. “I’m in a good mood so I’ll allow you all to look at the ass for twenty seconds. Bruce, you get a solid minute.”
“You don’t seem like the type to lie about something like this. There is no reason to anyway. Howard is gone and I’m out of my time. There is nothing for you to gain. Howard, the one I left behind, is my friend and I’d defend him…but not your dad. That…that is so upsetting, Tony.”
Chapter Warnings: Some horror elements, some uncomfortable sexual advances, and Tony being a creepy little bastard
Tony could blame no one else for her sweet tooth except himself. He still had a bad tendency of sneaking out to get himself, and his princess, donuts when Steve wasn’t looking. “Veggies are good for you.”
"Have you seen enough?" Steve pulled back, his face pale, as he reached for his shirt to pull it back on. He couldn't do this...this...whatever it was. He wanted to for Tony but this...no, it was too much and he couldn't...
“I can’t go into detail, but he is a bit confused about you.” He thought it best not to say clingy and carried the burden of a crush that was really hurting Steve’s heart. “Which, you have to admit, is fair.”
“It was supposed to be my daughter. I had seen her on the throne, ruling over the new universe I built, and ensuring its safety and progress. She rejected it and…” he trailed off a moment and an expression of sadness crossed his face. “Her sacrifice was necessary for the greater good.”
“T-That doesn’t mean anything.” He knew that was a lie and he knew things were becoming very bad. He could hear his mother, from an early memory, pleading with him to be careful, to not let anyone truly see him.
“Y-Yes sir.” Steve gulped and did as told. Shirts should never be wasted and he knew Tony was serious in that threat.
Instantly, Steve shook his head in denial. “You could never be blamed for your own abuse. What he did was his doing and not yours. You don’t deserve that. I just…” A shadow of doubt passed over his eyes. “I just didn’t see that. I never thought he’d be a fantastic father, he was so self-centered, but not…not cruel.”
‘That’ll come later.’ He warned himself and went so far to glare down at the bulge in his pants. ‘Stop that.’ It was clear from the list of mental and physical injuries his Steve would not be ready for bedroom activities for a while. ‘It doesn’t matter. It’ll come eventually.’ His heart soared and he felt his nose growing wet. ‘Because he’s mine now. Oh god, yes. My Steve.
“Tony…” Bruce, finally speaking, gave him such a pitiful look that earned a sneer from the man. Carol stepped up behind the scientist, glaring a threat if he made a move on any of them.
Tony was nine, about three months later, and his father gave him the best birthday present by taking him into his studio and began to play old videos from his time in the army and during Project Rebirth. Most all of the videos were of Steve.
Was it wrong of him to want happiness and easiness and some genteelness in his life? Was it wrong for Tony to just be happy?
Thor blinked, “I have not done anything towards your Steven. I only got to see him again after a few years apart just recently.”
"Shh, shh, daddy's here." She felt so wonderful in his arms, a little lump of rolls and softness. Her onesie had a hood with bunny ears on it which he eagerly flipped up and over her head. She was so cute with her chubby cheeks and bleary blue eyes and that ridiculous hood.
Tony woke deep inside hot warmth of Steve. The younger man was limp in his hold, sleeping soundly in Tony’s arms. His soft skin glowed and his face was so tender and warm. For a brief moment, Tony had to bury his face into Steve’s golden hair and let out a shaky breath. He felt emotionally weak and heavy with victory and adoration.
Tony coughed and looked him up and down as if seeing him for the first time. "Hundreds of components. You have…that many?
Tony returned the hungry grin. “As I enjoy his. Do give him my thanks for his advice on the energy shields Stark Industries were struggling with. The contribution is amazing and has been a fantastic success.” His best customers and alliance were an “alien” society of bloodthirsty warrior gods. Who’d ever expected that? “Now, will the end of the week be an acceptable deadline?”
Funny how it would be the desperation of skin that made him lose it and not everything else in his crazy life.
Tony, who always found himself hot and bothered when Steve got snarky, shared a few kisses that started off soft but could feel heat begin to simmer as their tongues got involved and Steve gave a tempting tug to his hair.
“You wish to make sure he avoids news feeds. He is not to see any outside source about you until he trusts you.”
Something exploded out of him, the ship shuddering and briefly going dark, before the air was silent save for some crackling in the air.
"I could probably write a book so thick it would make Victor Hugo weep about self-hate. This," Tony continued to touch and trail around the ink, stroking the skin with tenderness that made Steve want to recoil and hide from. "Is self-hate at its finest."
Finally found some plot in the dark fluff! Steve is a bit of a difficult character at times. I picture him here a bit more like how he was in First Avenger and Tony healing him despite his manipulative ways. He'll still show his attitude soon enough. I was tempted to not have any romance start yet but, dang it, it just was taking too long and I needed it.
It’s been one of the few times the two had been left alone in the same room. Tony had a tendency to maneuver Steve away if the blond got too close. The closing of the door surprised the soldier and he looked at Tony with cautious hope.
Walking over to his nightstand, Steve messed around the drawers, finding his few possessions still safe inside. The three books of his mothers, including the monster book, his mother’s stone pendant necklace (one of her last pieces of Ireland), two journals one filled with his secret sketches and other the diary of his mother, a small white bone of his pet rabbit (morbid, he had feared but his mother said anything can be a beautiful treasure if enough love is poured in and he wanted memory of something so soft and his), the last remaining patch of fabric from his first and only stuffed animal, and the slender box of brushes…his mother’s final, and most expensive, gift before she died.
Trying the hero path, like Steve, wasn’t for him. He was impatient and angry and had a sense of apathy for most. He found that he wasn’t just ready to kill but eager. He liked killing. He liked the power. He liked the screams. He liked the sight of the people who got in his way begging for mercy.
“Tony, please stop glaring at him.” Steve sighed, tugging at their interlocked hands. “You’re here to hire him…not give him nightmares.”
The mail center was connected to city hall and was a single room with one woman working, who was usually found reading as mail came possible once every two weeks. There was a school, a rarity for a town so small, but it only housed about fifteen students every year. But it was apparently enough to get three a year to leave for a university.
“I’m going to make sure you bleed and bruise and cry.” Tony pressed himself close up to the man, their cocks rubbing smoothly against each other, and he gripped those delicious hips harder to keep his Captain standing. “You deserve gentleness, baby…you’re not fucking getting it tonight.”
The holographic screen brought up the face of the marksman who munched on what appeared to be a burrito. “Yo.”
"Hip bone." Josh warned again as he picked up the machine and pressed the tip against the skin and bone.
'Hope you're smiling at me.' He looked up at the foggy sky. 'If there ever was a heaven I know you'd be there. Wish I could've given this to you...' His head lulled back and he snapped back into attention before he fell. 'And that is enough melancholy dramatics. Hell, I nearly fell down the stairs. Yeesh, what a statement that'd make.'
“You’re going to feel me in you for days. If I see your serum healing you I will happily bruise you again and again,” he started to thrust against the man, “and again.”
“You’re grinning. That’s scary.” Clint pointed out and tossed a small tomato at Natasha who grabbed it in her mouth. Clint’s hands shot up to show touchdown.
“Ma,” Steve cleared his throat a bit and sniffed. It had been so long since he spoke of her.  “Was a bit like yours, I think. Wild-child. Had me out of wedlock. Hugh Rogers, the man she married, was not even my father.”
“Are you sure you want to talk? You seem quite eager for something else.” Tony purred and started to gentle tug at Steve’s pants. He tilted a brow when Steve made another move to get him off. “Oh, darling, surely you’re not saving your purity for marriage?”
Steve liked to hum. He wasn’t aware of it, of course, as he would stop once someone made note. It was a nice sound and always felt strangely gentle from someone of his physique.
“It was their own fault, dear heart. They failed to read the fine print. They always do. Calling me starts the contract…it allows me to step in and begin the process but it’s not the ending, so to speak. A contract needs signed.”
“I wouldn’t want to be drunk right now.” It was a startling truth. There was not one ounce of him that was desperate for a drink. He wanted to experience this moment with a clear head so he could keep the memories for the rest of his life.
"Third one?" Steve pressed, picking himself away from his thoughts, surprised it sounded like they were ending so soon. They always did at least three dates per session. He thought Josh would want to do another as it was another step to being done.
A full body shudder took over Tony, “Fuck yes. Give me just a few minutes and I’ll be ready to make another attempt at getting a baby in you.”
For the first time in a long time Steve felt tears prickle at his eyes, dripping over and trailing down his face.
“Not exactly. He did when they first got him due to a shock to his system but it broke within a few hours and now it looks like it’s just his normal temperature." She typed something and nodded in confirmation. "Steve seems to be naturally several degrees warmer than natural.”
The man’s face melted at the plea, he nodded and brought them outside. Instantly, Steve was knocked back by the change in temperature and air pressure. Noise overwhelmed his ears and the smell was so different.
“I want to ruin you. I want to make sure you could never even dream of going to another lover…” He snarled. “I want to fuck the idea of that out of you. You’re mine.  I want you branded with my name.”
“Mine, mine, mine,” Tony snarled as he changed his angle to pump in and out with no mercy. He watched with open awe as the beautiful man tossed his head around, lost in a haze of overwhelming pleasure. Growling, he pinned his teeth into his shoulders, keeping Steve in place, as he slapped their hips together.
“Now, what makes you think I’m trying to start something? You pervert. I’m just here being a supportive boyfriend.”
“Just a little on me,” Tony hissed as he pulled his jeans down a little to free himself. “I want it to hurt a bit.”
Something in the back of his head tried to pull back, his instincts still uncomfortable, but Steve hushed them down. He could not let this time-jump keep him shackled down and fearful. He was a soldier and it was about time he acted like one and adapted better.
It was difficult to keep his shoulders straight. Although he fought the temptation most times, some days Steve found himself opening up to Zemo in hopes of some form of a friend and support, to have his voice heard rather than echo emptily about. Most days, he found himself able to handle the loneliness and how his existences was built simply around work or venting, but some days he just wanted a bit more human contact. It always ended up burning him in the end.
“Hmm, robot rats that eat humans? You’re going down 1950s comic book territory with that.” Bruce said with a laugh.
“Yeah, got that.” He winced and tried to get frantic creatures to calm down. “I’m fine. Just a little woozy. Sorry to worry you, uh…who are you?”
No matter the weather, Steve would need to head into town in the morning for supplies and food. Perhaps he could see how much Sam and his coach cost to make the trip easier. He had mentioned favors were as good as coin in the town, perhaps Steve could stretch his hours and get his work done for the Pierces and for Sam’s assistance.
“He wishes to make a challenge video, Stark.” Thor said with a cheer in his tone. “He has also informed me that if he eats them all at once the body believes it to be just one cookie.”
“Sorry, I…do you know what I’m talking about? I tend to just rant about science and things and I just…” he gave him a sheepish smile. “Don’t always consider what people do or don’t understand about situations. I tend to lose control over my tongue.”
“Good. Don’t even dare think of pulling out.” Steve gave him such a sultry look, “I want you to stay in me as long as possible.”
“I cannot say much, I was not there, but this man of yours does not appear to be doing his actions with a willing heart.”
“You truly believe it.” Tony whispered, unwilling to let their gaze break. His brows narrowed before he blinked, catching something, and a soft sound escaped his chest and his eyes widen somewhat; seeing it. “Oh…oh, dear heart…
Natasha was wonderful. Despite a self-challenge to make him squirm and blush any chance she got, she was an amazing person. Full of hysterical wit that left Steve freely able to laugh and, if for a few moments, to forget there was something not quite right.
Those brown eyes were now almost black and his trembling stopped as he gave Steve a look that nearly made his own blue eyes roll back in ecstasy. It promised nothing but pleasure and agony and Steve wanted it.
“Ah, I better not.” Steve’s fingers curled away and he felt his ears grow red. “I can be a bit too strong for my own good and I’d rather not break something as important as your heart.”
"Bitchy, bitchy, bitchy." Clint started to thumb through the paperwork. His nose scrunched up in disgust at all the political jargon used throughout. "This thing could put a guy to sleep. And you had to sit and listen as it was read aloud?"
“Ok,” he licked his lips and stiffly brought his legs to hang off the edge of the bed. Another bout of nausea washed through him and he stopped a moment to collect his bearings. His lack of eating and sleep hitting something fierce. He wouldn’t be surprised if he managed to lose another three to four pounds in the past few hours alone.
Still blushing, Steve gave her his own playful grin, “I’m afraid I would get in a lot of trouble if I got down on my knee to ask for it…but you,” he looked her over again and smirked, “you could kick my ass.”
“Oh, oh, wait. Better question.” He leaned forward, looking serious. “Did you cry when you met him?”
No one had ever touched him there in such a way before. Just open sweetness, no judgment, and not trying to get any pleasurable or financial favors out of it (as some lovers in the past had done). Just Steve, his darling Steve, being giving and worried and caring.
“Easy,” Pepper soothed, noticing the change in Tony’s posture and eyes. “Easy. Don’t let him see this yet.”
Tony’s teeth ground tight together, trying to hold back a slew of curses and threats. “He’ll want to fight.”
Scowling, Steve tied the curtains back to let his room have some sunlight during the day and went to put himself together.
“I’m not pissed off about you lying anymore. I got over that quickly enough. I’ve lied to you numerous times. I’m still pissed off that you thought you had to…that you still don’t understand why that pisses me off.” Tony growled.
“What the hell was tha…” He trailed off and gripped his throat. “What…” his hand trailed up to his face where he did not find his famous goatee but a smooth face. “What did you do to me?”
“You and our babies,” his hand went to Steve’s stomach again, “will be taken care of. I’m the ruler of this place now…ah, yes,” he laughed again and kissed Steve’s abs. “Father gave me a gift…these stones,” he held up his hand and snapped and like some sort of demonic halo the stones appeared around Tony’s right wrist. They circled around, the colors glowing brightly, eager to be used.
Still, he could not help but feel disappointed with the lackluster, simple greeting. Steve was looking forward to the famous honeymoon stage of the relationship. Bucky always said the early point was all fire, giggles, and excited touches in a corner. This was before it became serious and mature, where feelings needed discussed and arguments could start, and was a great way to feel distracted.
Thor sighed and shook his head, disappointed, “Pathetic. Some of you humans are such disappointing creatures. Failure in battle and defeat. It may be best to lay waste to them now with your own hand.”
“Tony…” Steve gaped, his eyes wide. He hadn’t even seen the man move. And that voice…his expression. This was not…this wasn’t his Tony. Steve gently reached out for him, grabbing his wrist, “What…how…”
‘Fuck, he looks like a mafia boss.’ Which, Sam supposed, he sort of was. “A date. Pick a restaurant and a movie then take him around Central Park. You don’t have to show him everything but he’d really appreciate some freedom.”
"Ok, and second one is..." he stuck his tongue out, made a few more scratches and pulled back, "done."
“You’re too sweet.” Tony gave a kiss to the back of Steve’s hand. “Can’t believe I am about to share you.”
“So there is nothing more to worry about. He’s alive, he’s healing, and he’s yours.” She walked over to the wall where an advanced intercom system lay. “Now, why don’t we talk to the doctors about his condition? You ready for that?”
"Of course, you are good, love." He noted as he walked, smiling when he saw the man at his side, looking at him with a shy smile.
“My name. I could provide for you…remove you from your pain. You know so much so you know what I could do if you just asked me. Why not?”
"Look, Cap, let me stop you right there." Tony had that tense tone, his voice rough and sarcastic. Full of hurt and anger. "You're the one who approached me about this; wanting to try and be all team-friendly again. And hey, look at me, I’m allowing it. I can forgive well enough," which sounded like a lie with how harsh his words were thrown out, "but not forget. I am now very aware you can be a hypocrite, you can be a liar, and you don't always do what you say. I am not just letting you in, trying to open me up to something, before I get something in return."
One of the automatic doors opened up and they heard Tony come back in after getting all the invites out to those who matter.
Tony did a quick movement with his wrist and touched his arc in a specific way Steve had not seen before and then…Steve stepped back in shock, air escaping his throat, as ripples of metal appeared out of no where and covered the body Steve had become so familiar with. Looking at this person, this thing, Steve could understand the terms Tony used of clunky and old because this…this was stunning.
“T-Ton…” He gagged. He didn’t want to fall back but he couldn’t find a way up. He couldn’t breathe. He couldn’t breathe.
“What? My art too deep for your shallow, dry Russian soul?” Tony huffed as he unnecessarily smoothed out his goatee. “Rude.”
“Loads of sex.” She took another gulp of her beer. “Very hot and heavy stuff happening. Honeymoon stage and all that. Going at it like teenagers.”
Tony laughed breathlessly and grabbed Steve to pull him up so they were back face to face, “Baby, I really don’t think that needs an apology. Holy shit.”
Howard gave him a firm glare. “Steve Rogers was the most important human being at the time. He was…he was…”
“Yes.” Steve bit his lip, trying to keep his stare on the man who continued to observe the blond as if he were an experiment. Tony was speaking to him. He was looking at Steve.
“You’re allowed to have someone hold you up. Just because you’re older than me doesn’t mean you have to shoulder everything.”
"STOP IT!" He snarled and the vision quaked, stopping all together as he gave a murderous look to an interested Thanos. "That is not for you to see, you fucker."
“Don’t know what you expect from me, you piece of shit.” He hissed, sweat pouring down his body. “I’m fifty and I fight with a suit.”
“Knew that would get you. Of course, it’s only fair. He tends to make everyone worry.” He shook his head as he spun the blade around. “Silly, pretty boy.”
“Just for a short while.” Steve said in a firm but comforting tone. “I’d rather not cook much until I can ensure there is nothing blocking the stove…and to get it a bit cleaner.” He looked over at the stove and oven, which were a bit worse than wear in the house. “It worked well enough last night so it should do us good, no need for replacement, but I’d rather not risk anything.”
“Start a new program to assist with this issue to find trigger words and forget about it until Ms. Romanov can provide you with further information. You already have Mr. Rogers to tend to along with all the other necessities that comes with this power implantation.”
“It’s something that anyone can get. Especially after a traumatic event. Well, one of many options.” Sam kneeled down to look him in the eyes better. “You’ve had an intense shock to your psyche and went through something terrible alone. You’re using touch as a way of balance and familiarity. But you're a proud person and filled with guilt so the comfort it brings also sort of burns you. It's a painful tug-o-war." Sam smiled. "But you're not even a week into this. Give yourself a break."
“Oh, oh darling. I am so sorry you had to see that.” He picked up Steve’s hand and started to kiss over it. “These fools can’t do anything right. I’ve been trying to train them for you but,” he sighed dramatically, “some idiots are just destined to remain that.”
“Could you imagine what they would say if they heard you call me daddy? There are some memes out there that I hope you unintentionally do…what a mess that would cause.” Tony made a noise at Steve’s movement. “Babe, give a man a few moments to breathe…I’m only mortal.”
Instantly, Tony’s hands greedily rubbed over the exposed skin. He let out a noise that was slick sin once he made contact. “Pants. Now.”
“Just,” his tablet rang with a message and something started to flash on his screen. “Just get back to work. I’ll fill you in later. And you better not have rice over the expensive merchandize.”
“Coffee. The drink of the gods, in my opinion.” He looked Steve over and snorted. “I can see you be more of a tea drinker. Well, I won’t hold it against you if you are.”
“Wind. Yes. That was wind. Stop it, Rogers.” He growled and stormed over to the window and pushed it back open properly wide. “Still, still…if…” Lord, he was ridiculous, “if someone wishes it closed…you can.” Yes, very ridiculous. “But I’d like it open since…the dust.” He coughed in awkwardness and to prove a point. “Right, let’s not let anyone else hear me talk to my imagination again, yes?”
The town near their new manor was small but growing. It used to be nothing but woods, turned to farmlands, turned to simple family life. The train-station was a few miles away from the center of town and roughly four and a half from their new home. Although the town was nicely clumped together, farms and the sparse remains of wealth were typically scattered about for privacy and quiet.
It was far less than half of the family’s original belongings, some clothes, books, and heirlooms they were not ready to part with, but it still took nearly thirty minutes of wasting daylight to put everything in sturdy tight. Before the fire and the suit, the Pierce family had more than any on their old neighborhood and now most everything could fit upon a single wagon.
“Just cause you assigned yourself role as Vodka Aunt doesn’t mean everyone else can too.” Tony then tapped his chin. “Maybe he should come study with Steve. I’m sure they’d both love that. Certainly keep the two from bouncing off the walls for a short time.”
“If this is bad, please just let me know so we can talk about it because you are making me a bit nauseas.” Steve confessed. “Is it…bad?”
‘Perhaps going out is something I can at least consider.’ He thought with a wince. The thought was shaky. If this rumor was true then wouldn’t he put Steve in the spotlight if he took him out? In danger? ‘People would only assume he looks familiar to Captain America. Most everyone will think he’s just a gorgeous blond with a big rack. My type.’
Steve reached up his other hand to cradle the familiar but unfamiliar face, looking over him in awe, confusion, and so much agony.
‘There is no reason to worry about him.’ Steve smiled. ‘I’m really ridiculous. Look at what he does. There is no reason to think anything suspect.’
“Yep. I don’t want anyone sleeping with Natasha.” Steve said with his own smirk. “She can’t be distracted if we’re going to become sparring buddies. Bruce being the exception of course.”
Tony started to scissor his fingers, spreading wide and shoved them in and out full spread. “Fitting in you will be a delicious challenge.”
“So do I. Along with asthma. Along with a list of so many other problems.” Steve said, rolling up his sleeves. He pinched them tight and stepped towards the door. “Zemo…did you hear anything about the house being haunted?”
“Or something.” Sam shrugged then sighed. “Look, you’ll find all of us in town are pretty friendly folk. Be kind to us and we usually return the favor.”
“Doesn’t hurt you are a bit of a sadist.” Steve murmured, closing his eyes and enjoying the rewarding sensation of Tony filling him up completely. “We do fit well together.”
“And I take it you do not want to bring Steve in?” He held up his hands at Tony’s hot glare. “It was just a suggestion. If this is some old code from the war he might be familiar with it. He also might appreciate being involved.”
“Tony.” She stopped him. “Always. He always wins” She hopped off the counter to level him with a serious look. “
Steve frowned and looked thoughtful, crossing his arms over his chest, “How about…it will be fine. You,” he looked at the camera, right at Tony, “will be fine. Someone, somewhere, out there is doing something good. Even when things are dark and bad and you feel lonely, there is good out there and it will find you.” He gave a sheepish grin, “And, hey, if not, then I will. If you need someone to help you find that good, this stupid punk from Brooklyn will drag that happiness to you.”
“Here,” Sam pointed to the store across the street, “This is the local shop. You can find plenty of groceries here but perhaps not as much as you’d be use to from your city.”
“That…” Steve had to take a moment to take a few breaths. His heart was in his throat and he had a sheen of sweat over him. “Was
Steve could not help but smile a bit. This Tony…was something else. He couldn’t get a proper read of him, and he had no respect for personal space, but he seemed like a kind man.
“Don’t bother explaining yourself, lad.” Pierce noted as he wiped his mouth. “He’s not going to understand. To answer your question, Steven, there are actually some plans to head past town this weekend. I have to meet up with an acquaintance. Should give you plenty of time to get the rooms done.”
“It shouldn’t be.” Tony pushed some hair from Steve’s forehead. It was slick with cold sweat. “But we believe being in such close proximity to the Tesseract, along with your serum, and the quick freeze just came together in an improbable, perfect equation. And here you are.”
One picture was a group with Tony in the middle. There was the kind woman Steve had only briefly met, Pepper Potts, and Happy Hogan, looking far friendly than he did in the office a few days prior, a cute little robot on the end, and a selection of men and women Steve had yet to meet but figured he would eventually as he got the hint these were the people who lived within the home.
Well then, probably not his imagination. Steve had enough arrogance in his life to conjure up more. Though it could not be denied the man wore the arrogance unfairly well.
He was sixteen, three days after the death of his parents, when he realized he was in love with the dead man.
. No more us being…us. Ahem,” he cleared his throat and ignored how his friends grinned. They were trying to mess him up and it was so hard to not grin back and start giggling. He could not do that now. There was far too much to do before relaxation. His mind provided a tornado of needs and plots that had a timeline of less than a month. The last few nations to threaten, the bribes of research, the act of kindness with vaccines, the rumors of a mole, and so much more. It made his head pound and all he wanted was the strongest whiskey in his cabinet. It was difficult to resist the temptation of starting the festivities early but he wanted to enjoy partying without any distractions. Sadly, that meant work.
“Whoa, whoa.” Steve held up his own hands to slow the man down. “I don’t need anything like that, Tony. I’m a bit more of a simple man.”
“That will need to wait, Thor.” Steve greeted as he now entered in, “Nat kicked my ass. I need a break.”
“Like I could ever be embarrassed.” Tony scoffed, his cheeks warm in a clearly embarrassed flush. “I’m not ashamed of them either. I just…you know me. I don’t like letting things out that show depth.”
What a horror that had been…coming in to find Steve burning from a fever, delirious with nightmares, calling out for him…if his temper hadn’t been so controlled as it was he might have actually beheaded Natasha for letting it get this far.
“Oh,” Steve took the items carefully and looked them over. They looked like fantastic quality. His fingers ran over the cream-colored pages. There were hundreds of them bounded so well. “You didn’t have to do that.”
“Fury said you did that to a lot of people.” Steve muttered, his ears burning. “I thought you were just…testing me to see if I was worth being your leader. You were flirting with Bruce.”
“It’s just…you know, this is crazy…what I create…” He moved his hands and fingers around, trying to describe in words what he can do. “It is…I make things! I make impossible things--”
Tony rewarded Steve by running his fingers up and down his spine for a moment. “What has you so red faced, I mean, besides the obvious.” Tony promptly grabbed a handful of Steve’s backside and squeezed. Steve rewarded him back with a glare.
Tony was starting to get that feral look back in his eyes as he grabbed Steve’s hips, meeting his stare in a challenge, “You have three minutes then I am back to trying to pound you into the mattress.”
That madness was still there. That darkness that people whispered about but no one had the ability to point out. It was an open secret that the man who had brought peace to most all the world with weapons and words had something off about him. Suppose one would have to be mad to take on such an agenda. Most saw him as a victim of terror and suffering who used extreme measures to fix a broken world; a hero meant for a fantasy film. The sanity, or shaky lack of, was not an issue since Tony Stark had done such good with his power.
“You,” Tony point the butt of the blade at the god, “Still too good looking. Even with your hair…ugh, maybe even better with this cut. You been keeping away from my Steve, right? He likes the idea of someone that can pin him down and control him.”
But it was. He trusted Tony. He did. He had no reason not to. There was nothing wrong with Tony and nothing wrong with Steve’s new life. But wasn’t there still plenty wrong? God, why would he ever think anything ill towards the man who had given him everything?
“Then what the hell is so important that we have this conversation now? You made me think it was something serious.”
Tony had no reservation or pause button as he pulled back and tore through his jacket, vest, and shirt. He did it so easily, a smooth as a dance move, and discarded it to the side. Steve watched in some awe as he made removing his shoes and pants as attractive as everything else. Steve always managed to get his legs or head stuck when fumbling just to get ready for bed…he had no idea how to be smooth and graceful…attractive. What was he to do in this situation?
“Yes, he is. And he’s mine.” Tony sulked, not happy his make-out session was interrupted. “So, go jump out a window, Clint.”
There were others within it, maybe fifteen people in total in the picture, and all just looked necessary. Like they were supposed to be in the picture and around Tony. Steve got the impression that this was Tony’s family and the concept of meeting them brewed up so many insecurities and doubts Steve did not wish to begin facing. Maybe after lunch he’ll feel prepared to be an adult and figure things out.
“Relax.” Tony commanded. Despite Steve’s flinch to follow orders he could not relax, but he did not move. He allowed the fingers to trail up and down the black markings. “It’s ok…it’s ok…I have you.”
Clits eyebrows rose over his glasses. “Really? This breaks a massive part of the treaty. You have ever right to go to the oval office and demand him and every other official to step down and you fill it up with your own. You were practically waiting for a moment like this.”
The screen came back to life once more, filled with his father's papers about Steve. Obsessive words filled the screen along with memorieis of old photos and video.
"Nope." And with a huff and pushing weight back in his heels, he pushed Steve back and off of him. He probably would've made a tackle if Natasha hadn't thrown some discarded Foot Loops from Clint's choking fit at the brunette's face. "You're no fun."
A shy smile passed over his features as he made his way to the end of the massive space. Spinning around, he looked over the distant he made and frowned.
“I think I like your talent in sexual relations to much to ever want to kill you.” His hands seductively trailed over Tony’s muscular back. “You have ruined me for anyone else.”
“God, Barton, you’re so weak.” Natasha smirked, leaning against Steve. “Can’t even carry a god? I think even Tony without his suit can.”
It was like a radio in his head, like the one they used out in the barren French countryside; everything static and cutting out. Nothing really to make sense of but enough to grasp some sort of nightmare. There was something bad happening. Now, around him, while he was floating and sinking and dying and…
“You don’t know that. Probably orphaned plenty of big-assed-nosed bears just to say ‘we love Stark’ in, what, fifteen copies of a five hundred page document.”
“Right…right, thank you. I’ll be right back.” He gripped his chest and hurried outside, nearly tripping over the broken steps. The air was frigid but it was open and bright and the realness he was used to. Gasping, he tried to get his lungs and panic under control.
Damn my need for Dark!Tony with Sweet!Steve…and how there are simply not enough out there so I have to make my own. Ugh…not fair. And the stupid plot-bunnies need to stay away so I can get something complete!
Josh was just tallying up the pay-day he was about to receive as he listened to Hawkeye jump from one idea to another, all big in size with a lot of detail…well, he tried to. It was hard to concentrate when terrifying billionaire Iron Man was glaring at him as if he were some foe who needed a smiting.
“Found a slight hiccup.” Natasha answered. There were whimpers in the background followed by a grunt. “Apologies, my guest doesn’t know to be quiet when I’m on the phone. Rude.”
“I am. It’s terrible but it was war. Something you’ve now put a stop to. He’s going to be ok, Tony.” Pepper comforted with a smile. “He’s yours now. You’re going to keep him safe.”
“I see you have had some fun, Breaking Point.” Ah, now that was a relief. Tony worried he had forgotten about his clever wits and nicknames.
“An update.” Clint hiccupped and wiped his mouth. “Things are progressing smoothly but we’ve had two attacks already. The people are well trained but are just paid mercenaries with no obvious direct ties to anyone in particular. We’ve captured a few who have been willing to talk. So far, no one supremely loyal to this cause is in the groups. But they are for sure mercs hired by some governments.”
“Aw, you are very polite, little one, not rude at all.” The man refused to remove his hand on Steve’s face. “Tony. That’s my preference. I think you deserve to call me that since you are so sweet.” His thumb rubbed circles against Steve’s cheek. “I’ve overheard your
Swallowing, he turned back to look around the room just incase the wind wasn’t a cause of the window but found no movement around.
“Hey, hey—let me see it again!” Clint demanded and tried to grab at Steve’s wrist. “This is just unbelievable…of all people…hey! Stark! Good timing! Get a load of this!”
“It’s fine. Don’t feel upset.” Steve turned around and held Tony’s hand, feeling a bit braver after sharing such intimate parts of themselves. “Jarvis mentioned you’d be late?”
Steve tried to look away but Tony held firm. “Nu-huh, you’re listening to this. I can’t understand why you would think you deserve to suffer. Wilson mentioned something about survivor’s guilt but damn-it, basically your whole team lived into their eighties because of you. Peggy is about to reach a hundred. Most all of them had families and left the war or provided great advances because you kept them alive. You did, Steve.”
, get with the times, old man. But fine,” Clint shrugged and then stabbed his blade into another piece of chicken. “More time for munchies.”
“He chose wrong.” Thaons said in a tone of agreement. “Mistakes happen, my heir. Your bride was in a position very few face. He was trying to be loyal to you both…tell me, is this man selfish?”
“Sir,” Jarvis interrupted, thankfully. “Mr. Wilson has arrived. He has been sent up on the elevator with Happy and will arrive on the designated floor in roughly thirty seconds.”
“Well, like people seeing a figure in the window—the big one upstairs. Or when a name is misused odd happenings take place. Supposedly, the original family disappeared under very mysterious, and some claim supernatural, circumstances. There is also a history of insanity taking over residents.”
“Yes,” Tony smiled but it did not reach his eyes. He felt sick at the sight of those tears desperately clinging to the pretty blues. “I hope to help reduce the need of trees and coal within the next three years because of this thing. Also reduce the carbon gas and smog. I made some pretty spot on calculations and I think from what I learned, within the next twenty years, I can have almost the whole world off fossil fuel. At least for households.”
Steve finally pulled away with a soft laugh as he took the aggressiveness for something else, “I really need to get up.”
"It was a necessary discomfort. But I do see how this has affected you. I apologize for that, son." Thanos turned and looked back at the screen. "That man...he held me back with his hands alone. He glared at me and without any power, kept me in place. He was magnificent."
“You’re studying it?” Steve pulled back, horrified. “That…that thing should be lost to the bottom of the ocean.”
Tony’s fingers pressed deep into Steve’s skin. “You tried to be an adult for me, for the thousandth time.”
Steve couldn’t help but smile. It was tired and small but it looks like the mysterious man already got his way. “You’re doing a lot for me.”
“Then come after me. I’m right here, wanting you too. Just be with me. Just try it out. In all the stories about you, you'd dive into things without always thinking. Can’t you do the same with this?”
“Talking about it beforehand is still better. If you hadn’t liked it that moment would’ve been ruined and we, well I, would’ve had a lot of emotional cleanup to do. I’d rather do the awkward talking before a romp rather than after, especially if it went bad.”
“I got that, Tony. I mean you and Nat and apparently the fucking literal god of thunder are your friends.”
How could he tell his sweetheart no to Barnes when he probably still didn’t understand what that man did? For all Tony knew, Steve was still broken because of that damned soldier. He shouldn’t have let his jealousy get him in messes like this.
Tony had clung to those words that night and again six months later when he found his world splintering into broken little pieces. He went over them obsessively when he was beaten in that cave, his mind swirling that Obadiah Stane, someone who claimed to care for Tony, was responsible. It was also the first time he cursed the hero, hating him for giving him hope, for promising to come for him when things were bad.
Steve scowled, “Apparently that is a standard in the story around this place…and yourself. Don’t get testy at me for being prepared for something I was warned about.”
Tony did not move for a moment. He seemed to be struggling with an internal battle and his fingers pressed hard into Steve's arm and hand.
“Fine, whatever. Just get going on it.” He slid into his seat and began his own search. “Natasha, I want this kept in the dark. The less people who know the better. We can fill the rest in once everyone is back for the monthly meet-up. Until then just concentrate on your goal. Your TV-debut is tomorrow so we’ll get that taken care of first.”
“Ah, so you agree talking is out is best. Hmm…look who was right again. Ow!” He gave a mock glare when Steve slapped his backside. “So different from a few moments ago…you were
“You’re a charmer.” Steve laughed, leaning against the wall of the elevator and allowed Tony to crowd him. “And, as said, a perverted bastard.”
Sam shrugged, “Apparently Hammer was intelligent but not very bright. But, regardless, his ownership and search did not last long. After the first week he started showing signs of madness. Swore up and down he found him, the son. Said it all made sense. Three months after that, Hammer said he could find a way to get everything he deserved—even uh, the son.”
“I mean,” Steve fumbled, afraid he had gotten ahead of himself. But he could not help it if Tony was acting on some sort of script he thought he had to do. He wanted to elaborate so that the Fae did not take insult. “You’re not a thing. You’re not something to be owned and used. You’re worth more than that…better treatment and…uhm…”
He stormed out of the elevator once he was on his lab-floor and rushed to his computer. “Jarvis, start with the most blunt of files. I want anything that has words that remotely look like Hydra up in twenty-seconds.”
“Yeah, I feel it.” He popped his back again and went to the elevator to greet his boyfriend. Like many times during the day, his heart did cliché flip-flops at the idea that he was waiting for a loved-one to return.
“Suppose so,” Tony noticed that Steve’s cup looked low and snapped his fingers and more hot, dark liquid filled it. He felt quite pleased when Steve looked at it in open awe. So sweet. “Why not say it?”
Taking a peek in through the window, he saw there was a woman with dark hair skimming through a book. He figured he was in the right place for the library because she had two more stacked on her desk.
Steve gave him such a look, “You’re the one who is literally putting your hand down my pants,” Steve reached round and grabbed Tony’s wrist, preventing his fingers from going lower on Steve’s backside, getting close to grabbing a cheek. “You’re still being perverted.”
, knew what Hammer did and tried the same thing, for some reason. Anyone else who supposedly did it was also branded and then would either die or disappear. After the fifth person, the town set up a warning about the name and made sure no one talked about what Hammer did exactly.”
He grinned back, happy though surprised Natasha wanted one first. "I'll call up the place and get you in to see him tomorrow."
“And you’ll stay here. The only way you’re leaving is if we’re going to bed.” Tony grumped, kissing at the corner of Steve’s lips. “The whole point of this is to meet everyone.”
It was fire and ice and light and darkness and burning, burning, burning. It was like he was aware of every single cell in himself and could feel something latch on to them. They boiled and shuddered, coiling and spiking, as every part of him trembled under whatever was being pumped into his system.
“And you’ll stay close until I say you can come. ” He stopped his ministrations, watching as Steve looked close to tears in his desperation, “not before.”
Tony casually dressed himself, a smirk on his face that he could not tamper down. He could see Steve in the mirror, resting peacefully against the silken sheets and large pillows…no one could tell this was a man unnatural powers who had saved the world and possibly knocked a tank unconscious with his bare fists.
“Well, that’s terrifying. Given, you know…are still squishing me.” Steve tried to move and glared when Tony held him in place. “You planning on letting me go anytime soon?”
“Twenty-three copies and four hundred and seventy two pages.” Bruce corrected as he cleaned his readers.
It was near five once he had everything indoors and the perishables put in proper spots. Sadly, he was unsure if he could make the 6pm dinnertime but he did his best.
His father tilted a brow, a movement he did when Tony did something foolish. “He was Captain America.”
Tony went back to Steve’s lips, his attention rough and desperate but with absolute control. His hands held Steve’s head, keeping him still, but with such powerful tenderness Steve nearly, for some reason, wanted to start crying. It felt perfect. It was…necessary. Complete. Giving Tony this power and dominance was something Steve never knew he needed.
He wanted to rub himself all over Steve’s long body but resisted and settled for trailing his fingertips over the outline of the man’s cheek and jaw. Those golden eyelashes resting against the cheeks were truly works of art. “Any injuries?”
“Don’t stop.” Steve begged, stopping his fumbling to grab Tony’s face and pull him back for more of that addicting kiss. “Oh, god, Tony.” He whimpered and pulled back. He was happy, he was quite possibly high on the happiness, but he didn’t care. Steve’s mind had been in overdrive for the past few days and he was tired of it. He wanted it off and he wanted Tony. And damn it, he was going to have it.
“I fell asleep in you again? Sorry, babe.” Tony kissed Steve’s neck as he sluggishly pulled himself out of his lover. They both shared a groan but Tony just flopped back down on Steve’s back, getting comfortable.
“There you are.” Zemo huffed when Steve turned the corner as he made his way to the front door, “You were up there for two hours…father was growing  impatient.”
“Yep. But I wanted this.” She scraped the bottom of the bowl of the last bite and tossed the item into the sink. “So I ate it.”
Still, he did not want to waste time looking over his shoulders before someone showed up to actually look over his shoulder. He made himself comfortable on one of the few small study-tables and got to work. The papers smelled musty and sharp. There was also the stench of old leather and cloth. It was a scent only a library could carry and fed into Steve’s eagerness of the mood.
Steve growled, yanking his wrists from Tony’s grasp, reached up and grabbed at the bigger man’s cheeks and pulled, hard. “Fae, demon, whatever….You’re going to stop being a pervert, get off, and give me this supposed amazing coffee or I will rip out your hair, consequences be damned.”
"My son," Thanos' hand fell heavy on his shoulder, pulling him back into reality. Into real. The world. Everything. "Your mind appears to be troubled."
Steve couldn't help but laugh again. He did feel sympathy for the tattooer who was always careful to provide the least amount of pain and damage to his clients as possible. Steve and his healing was a nightmare. Each session took an hour and they only managed a few dates in because Josh had to go in and reapply the ink numerous, fifteen was the norm, times to ensure that it stayed put and acted like a normal tattoo.
“Well, he sort of is.” Tony grinned, happy at the admission. There were only two people who could boss the hidden ruler of the world around and the other was in his arms throwing a pout. “You can have one after dinner. You need to save room. I’m sure papa is making something really good.”
“It,” Steve nodded slowly and looked back over his shoulder and to the breathtaking skyline. “It really is.” He groaned and placed his head in his hands. “I don’t…I don’t understand this. How did this happen? It doesn’t seem possible.”
Inhaling was stranger still as it smelled only slightly musty. Truthfully, there was something nice in the scent. He couldn’t quite place it all of it, some were familiar that he could name (like coffee and earth), some were familiar but he couldn’t quite place (perhaps a some type of metal), and other things that mixed it he had no guess…but it was soothing. With the scent and the soft bed, Steve could almost imagine he was in a tender hold.
Josh cleared his throat as he pulled out a sheet of paper, "Daaaa, ta-da-tada-da, da DAAAAAAAA." He unfolded it and presented the final piece to the blond.
Steve had been called dense a few times in his life. Bucky would have to smack him upside the head when Steve missed the picture of something obvious to everyone else. But Steve was not, by any means, stupid.
“You’ll start with the Avengers one. I’d like to say on my chest, but we’ll do wrist to match my baby.” He grabbed Steve’s wrist to show what he meant. “You’ll also do a blue star on me, like he has the arc…still deciding where to put that. I may not match because while Steve is shy, I am not. I am more than happy to show he’s mine and I’m his.”
“Your morning person energy is disgusting.” Tony grumbled rolling off of Steve but still kept his arms around him. He still smiled as Steve turned over so they could face each other. He would never get tired of that sweet face with those gentle blue eyes staring at him every morning. “Were you always like this?”
‘Ghosts, Changelings, and a demon who makes deals? That is certainly a lot for one house to hold.’ It almost seemed too good to be true. Too much excitement read as more paranoia than anything else.
Tony loved to imagine driving these blades into every centimeter of Thanos, make him suffer and for Tony to sit back and enjoy it all.
“Ah yes, your destiny in killing billions upon billions.” Tony seethed, remembering the kid, his kid, slowly disntergrate from his fingers.
“Who knows?” Steve teased, moving his hips and hissed when Tony hit a perfect spot. “You’re the scientist. Make a theory and start testing.”
“A guy like that is not going to just be done with it, you know.” He noted. “He is going to need to do something. A goal or job or something. He thinks too much and has far too much energy and is very used to fighting and earning everything he gets. I don’t think he, or even you, can turn that off.”
He shook his head at the insane thought and squashed the feeling of comfort. The idea of it itched something fierce and started to make him think of things he could no longer change.
“He was rough…broke me a bit, but it was for the better. I am better for it.” He crawled over Steve, pinning him down. His grin was sharp. “I can protect you now. Keep you away from those who want to hurt you.”
“It’s just…I sort of…want to explore…” He motioned around for the right words but realized he was going down the same spiral as earlier and sighed again, approaching it from the blunt perspective as Steve urged him to. “You know kinks, right?”
“Oh, get up before ten for one god damn day, Stark.” Clint groaned. “I want this over with and vacation time started. My niece has a birthday party next Saturday! I ain’t missing it like I did Easter.” He crossed his arms and sulked. “All I got to see were pictures of all the rugrats in cake-topper suits and dresses. Do you realize how much it sucks to miss a ten-month old waddle around a fluff of a purple dress? She waddled, Stark, waddled!”
"Ha." Steve smirked and handed over his wrist to Natasha who waiting for it. "You still breathing there, Clint?"
Wiping both of their mouths, he checked Steve’s skin, sighing in relief to feel it at a relatively normal temperature and not the fire that he was dying from when Tony first arrived.
Howard huffed, “I told you that those comics were moronic and false. That was not Steve. They made him look like that to brainwash gullible kids like you. This,” his finger pointed over the blond, the touch tender, “is the real Captain America.”
Thanos smirked, “And as my heir I expect you to have the ability to kill me. Surpass me. You win the position from me and you take the stones. You can do whatever you want with them.”
He quickly made use of the hot water, shaved what little his twenty-odd face still refused to produce, and dressed in his uniform. Black pants that he had owned since he was fifteen, luckily no longer required the use of suspenders but were a little too short above the ankles, a once white, now a bit yellowed, long sleeve shirt, and a brown vest that was a hand-me-down of Zemo’s and did not quite match the pants nor fit right. His only pair of shoes was towards the end of their days and Steve hoped Pierce would let him get another pair before the New Year.
“Hmm," Tony stroked his chin, "I like the sound of it. I'll need to see your work but if you're good that'll be perfect. He needs my face somewhere on him.”
“This…that, all of it. You constantly touch me, give me names, you’re letting me stay in your home, you’ve paid for all my medical bills…just, this is a whole lot. Too much. I don't know how to repay you...I mean, I don't think I could. And I appreciate it, so much." He quickly explained, afraid he sounded ungrateful. "But, why do you do it?”
Steve, who was lost as to what exactly they were talking about, turned to look at the woman, “Hey, Natasha?”
“It doesn’t matter much to me. Mom took it hard from what I hear. She handled my birth eight years later fine and was the best mother. Howard,” Tony scowled. “He didn’t handle losing you for a second time.”
“Good.” Tony said clapping his hands “We will leave at 7.” He announced, patting on Steve’s back as he passed, heading to change. Steve Leaned into the touch, grinning. He went to change clothes himself.
Steve smiled nodding. "I'll teach you as much as I can. Do you want to now? Or after you're healed? "
Tony laughed “Alright Alright.” He gave up, popping his back with a groan and slumping towards the elevator. Steve followed, keeping Tony steady when he stumbled.
Tony tried to suppress a shiver “I’m great.” He mumbled with a sigh and attempted to push off Steve but stumbled slightly.
Steve sighed softly, shoulders slumping as he walked out. He paused outside the labs, absently looking up. "Make sure he eats, please Jarvis?"
“A-ah! St-Steve” he moaned pleadingly, trying to rock back towards Steve’s tongue. Steve gripped his ass tighter, the intent of driving Tony insane as he licked and nipped. “Please, Steve!” Tony whined, still trying to rock back to get more. “P-please just fuck me.” He whimpered. Steve pulled away, dragging his nails over his skin carefully as he reached for the lube and a condom. Tony sighed, thanking whatever god was up there that Steve was moving this along.
Tony flushed, clearing his throat and walking back around the counter, grabbing the tablet that was laying on the other end before sitting down. Steve raised an eyebrow "No working."
Tony panted, shivering at the feeling of Steve’s breath on his ear “N-no condom” he decided “P-please fill me up.” He begged.
Tony rubbed the back of his neck sheepishly “I have no idea what I’m doing” he admitted, taking off his business jacket and unbuttoning his dress shirt and shucking it so he was standing in his white tank and dress pants.
When Steve woke he could see Tony standing before what almost looked like a projector screen. A screen that had Howard yelling at a tiny Tony Stark. Oh, God.
Tony downed the rest of his cup of coffee before getting up “I eat them either way.” He said with a shrug, grabbing plates and everything else Steve mentioned
"I'm not a one night stand!" He finally just blurted out, the hurt of the last couple of weeks plastered all over his face.
"What about that Korean barbecue place?" Steve offered, getting Clint on his side as the archer just wanted Asian.
"No. Talk to me, Tony." He huffed. "Why did you say you would do it? Why go stomping off like that?" Steve asked, concerned
Steve rubbed at his face, sighing softly. "Tony...DO you want more than a one night stand? I thought we were on the same pace but apparently, we werent." Tony opened his mouth respond but didn't get a chance because fury busted through the doors.
"You're welcome. And this is too heavy for that arm today" Tony mocked his words childishly, rolling his eyes fondly.
Tony drank the entire glass in two drinks “Thanks” He said with a sigh. “That’s a lot of food for one person.” He said, raising an eyebrow in amusement. Steve was obviously cooking for him and roped Jarvis in to get him down here.
Tony took a deep, silent breath as the scene changed yet again, Tony's eyes widened more, he knew this one too. Tony, roughly 16, had just been caught kissing a boy. Howard, fuming, sent the other boy away before berating tony about how much of an embarrassment he was. Tony made the mistake of speaking up "But, dad, there were rumors that Captain America was gay." He tried to argue, his cheek stung where Howard had promptly slapped him with a hard smack. "Don't you DARE!" He spat, "Steve was not a filthy queer like you!" He continued. "He would be just as disgusted with you as I am!" Tony felt his tears start to fall.
Tony shot straight up, gasping for air, tears steaming down his face, calming a bit when he recognized where he was, Shield medical bay, looking over to see Steve coming to as well. Steve bolted up, gasping and looking around before he scrambled for Tony, pulling him into a tight hug. "I am not disgusted. " he whispered
"Not unless you want to set the table. Need plates, cutlery, butter, syrups, and the like." Steve hummed in thought. "Also, fried or scrambled eggs?"
Steve looked up from his sketch, heading to open the door, his chin dropping. "Tony? Oh, my Lord above, what happened?" He tugged Tony carefully inside, looking him over.
Tony nodded, not arguing with more coffee. Breakfast came and went; Tony ate too much again and was miserable, but he got to spend time with Steve. Now tony was sitting in a chair, head lolled back over the back of it. The rest of the occupants were arguing over where to eat. Well, Nat and Clint were arguing, tony was sure a few knives or guns were going to be out any second. Thor was listing off places he knew, which were few. Steve was playing ref between the assassins and Bruce was staying out of it.
"There we go. This one is much tighter than the rest, had this one long?" He asked, leaning into the massage.
Tony rose up to meet him instinctively “Tsk tsk,” Tony said breathlessly “That kind of language from America’s sweetheart” he scolded playfully.
Tony blushed, stopping a moment to catch his breath, already breaking a sweat. Steve licked his lips, mentally saving the image of Tony panting and sweaty, cheeks flushed and hair sticking to his forehead. "C’mon, let's practice throwing off attackers" he murmured, moving to the mat. "I'll be careful, and I won’t hurt you"
Steve sighed, pinching the bridge of his nose. "No Thai, Clint, you know what happened last time Bruce ate something that spicy."
It was the next night when Tony decided he was going to walk back from his late meeting, and that was just a bad idea altogether. Once tony got back to the tower he went straight up to Steve’s floor and stood at the door to his room, deciding what exactly he was going to do. He finally sighed and knocked lightly.
"Nope I taught you high blows" Steve winked, laughing as he put a plate of food in front of Tony who rolled his eyes fondly and began to eat slowly
Steve let out a careful breath, leaning down to whisper in Tony's ear as he dug at the knot "I'll do this every day if it'll help"
"No," Steve said firmly. Tony just shrugged and continued working, ignoring Steve completely. Steve sighed, flopping on 'his' couch. He watched Tony silently, taking him in for well over two hours before standing. He let out another sigh, going to rest a hand on Tony's shoulder. "C'mon." He murmured. "Come with me"
Tony perked up “You’re going to make someone a good housewife one day, Spangles.”  Tony said moaning when the hot liquid touched his tongue.
Steve's eyes welled with tears, finally seeing why Tony had been terrified when Steve offered to help. He longed to reach out and hug Tony. Bit he couldnt, his muscles wouldn't move, his voice wouldnt work.
“Uhh..” his brain wasn’t functioning correctly with Steve so close “I don’t think so.” He finally said, tracking Steve’s tongue with his eyes before letting them flicker back up to the man’s eyes
Tony was a babbling mess at this point, Steve was hitting his prostate multiple times. “Close” he managed.
"Take off your shirt and lay on your stomach on the chaise. That way I get to both sides," he instructed. Tony nodded, stripping his shirt as he was told, laying down. Steve grabbed some lotion before patting Tony's shoulder, slowly starting to rub his arms. Tony groaned at the feeling of Steve’s hands on him, unable to keep himself from arching into the touch. "Mmm, they're bunching for sure" Steve murmured, finishing Tony's arms before moving to his calves. Tony let out a soft whine, his leg muscles were hurting but he knew they’d feel better when Steve was done.
"I think I have something to trap them. But, no offense, I don't trust anyone with this tech so I'm definitely going." He said sternly.
Steve about melted at that grin, his own lips curling into a smile. He slid on the gloves, crouching a bit to plant himself. "Okay, punch the center of the pad." Tony nodded and did as he was told, punching the middle of the pad as hard as he could. "Good!" Steve grinned. "Again, use your other hand this time"
Tony got up slowly, stretching and groaning when his back popped "I think I might need another massage" he said, as innocently as possible, walking from the room
Steve managed to get the aliens in the traps before bolting for Tony. "Fuuuuck. Cmon Tones, wake up!" Steve reached to gently cup Tony's cheek, gasping softly as a static shock ran up his arm and causing him to fall unconscious.
"Get you some more coffee, foods almost done. " he smiled, bringing the food to the table before going back for the eggs.
hit him with some kind of ray and he promptly passed out." He said with a sigh "Physically he seems fine" he added, "We will just have to wait for him to wake up." Tony nodded.
"Don't be" he murmured "I'm no saint" Steve assured him. Tony bit his lip and rolled his hips again, letting out a quiet moan
Dinner went great, they all had fun, laughing and talking and just spending time together. They were all walking back to Avenger tower because it was a pretty night. Steve smiled at his friends, ambling along closer to the back.
"I need you to assemble." He said immediately "All of you." He said, looking between Steve and tony meaningfully. Steve's face showed hi sc fear for Tony, not thinking as he pulled the other close.
Tony groaned, standing up. “Put it back where it goes then, Cap.” He snarked through gritted teeth, looking up at Steve with pain flickering through his eyes.
Steve frowned, completely ignoring fury to stomp after Tony. "Tony what the fuck?!" Tony just ignored him and kept walking. "Tony!" He reached out, catching Tony's arm
Tony frowned "I went to the lab. I-I didn't want to wake you." He said in a soft voice "And as far as the other part, I figured you didn't want your business out in the open."He said, another shrug "I'm sorry, steve" he finished in a tiny voice.
Tony had been walking beside Steve and he stopped to tie his shoe. Before he even got the strings in his hands good something came out of nowhere hitting him in the arm, causing him to fall to the ground, clutching his shoulder and letting out a string of curses.
" 'M not hungry this morning, will eat lunch." He said, fixing his cup of coffee. "Promise." He added, walking back towards the elevator.
“Steve” Tony whined again, loving the feeling of being pinned down. “Please” he whimpered, not even sure what he was asking for, he just wanted more of whatever the hell this was.
Tony nodded "We will meet you at Shield." He said, turning to heat to his lab and Steve followed him down.
” he grunted, rolling his eyes and almost pouting. “They wanted money. They got money and apparently had to give me a black eye and some bruises on the process” he complained.
Tony sighed “Steve, I’m sure you have a life, that doesn’t revolve around you cooking my meals.” He said with a laugh “I’ll see you tomorrow at dinner.”
Tony sighed contently “not so bad yourself spangles” he teased with a tired laugh. Steve let out his own tired laugh, burying his nose into Tony's hair, content
"Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but most of that is because someone decided to use you as a punching bag" Steve teased.
"Wrap your legs around my waist" he panted, lifting Tony up with the grip on his ass. "Going to my room" he offered in explanation.
Tony chewed on his lip a moment before running a hand through his damp hair “Okay.” He finally said, following Steve
Steve smiled, "Okay, now, try to grab me from behind, I'll go slow so you can hopefully see how I do it, bit you'll be going over my shoulder, ok?"
Tony had never really seen this side of Steve, felt like the blonde was flirting with him. He really liked it. “Less talking, more massaging.” He pouted. Steve chuckled, grinding his thumbs into another knot. “Steve” Tony whimpered our breathlessly, blushing when he realized what he’d sounded like
“Good thing you’re not as saintly as people seem to think,” he said, biting his lip. Tony was feeling oddly confident.
Steve hugged him a moment. "I've got you" and Tony just sagged back against him, he was too tired to care. Steve rubbed his chest. "You okay?" He whispered into Tony's ear.
“Apparently” Tony breathed out, shivering at the name before latching his lips onto Steve’s neck. Steve groaned, letting Tony continue on the short walk to his bed before he all but dumped Tony into the sheets. Tony flopped back, looking up at Steve with a lustful gaze, licking his lips in anticipation
"You don’t have to keep from working, but don’t dive immediately back in, especially the heavy lifting"
“S-Steve.” He whined softly, rolling his hips again, gripping the material under his fingers lightly.
Steve smiled. "You're welcome. That arm is out of commission for a week or two, got it? " he asked to which Tony nodded.
“I told you I needed time alone. And I got it. I’m fine” he responded with a shrug. Steve smiled, relaxing a bit. “And I’m drinking this coffee then going to bed, mother hen,” He said, rolling his eyes and patting Steve’s head on the way by.
Tony’s heart stopped for a moment he froze before whirling around and snatching his arm out of Steve’s grip, stumbling back a bit. “Don’t do that!” He said with a frown.
“Damnit. Just give me some time to cool off!” He said, tossing the wrench down and leaning against the work table.
Tony squeaked, doing as he was told “Fuck, that was hot” he groaned, diving back in for another kiss, letting Steve just throw him around like he’s nothing.
Over the next weeks, Tony spent a lot of time with Steve. The blonde making sure he ate and slept somewhat normally and keeping him company in the lab. Right now, though, they were in a conference room that Steve had all but dragged him and Fury into. Tony had his elbows in his hands. Watching the two arguing like a ping pong match.
Tony’s stomach flipped “O-okay” He managed, scrambling to his feet and planting them firmly, waiting on Steve. Steve waited until Tony was planted before going after him. Tony took a deep breath and tried again, failing miserably and ending up stumbling back against Steve’s chest with a grunt.
“I don’t think I can eat anything else right now, maybe in a bit?” He said, getting up to put his dishes and Steve’s into the sink.
"Fuck, baby" he groaned, scrambling up, only to pull Tony up with him and into a hard kiss. Tony melted against Steve’s lips, shit, it was just as hot as he thought it’d be. He allowed Steve to take control, scrambling for purchase as he hands twisted in Steve’s shirt with a whine. Steve kissed him hungrily, hands slipping to Tony's ass, palming and rubbing.
“S-shit” Tony moaned loudly when Steve’s fingers hit just the right spot, arching his back in response.
Tony groaned again. “No, you said you wouldn’t hurt me.” He said, taking the meds and downing a half cup of coffee. “News flash, I hurt.” He said, letting his head fall again
“I will do my best Captain Rogers” Jarvis replied before the door closed behind him. Tony ordered blackout again before going to flop down onto the couch before grabbing a pillow and hugging it to his chest before pulling his legs up and sighing as he let his eyes close.
"Go on and yell. You probably want to." Tony said with a shrug and a chuckle, gathering everything they needed.
"Mmm, want me stretching open? Filling you up?" He lined up, teasing Tony's hole with the slick head of his cock.
Steve clenched his eyes shut at the mental image of Tony bent over that workbenches. "I can see why then"
“No. I’m good.” He said absently, concentrating on perfecting his trap, and shrugging Steve’s hand off automatically.
“Careful. You're going to be sore, especially after being jumped. C’mon I'll help you to your room. I recommend a hot bath with Epsom salts and some anti-inflammatory meds."
Tony groaned “that feels amazing” he moaned out, arching slightly. Steve bit his lip, trying to tamp down the surge of arousal that curled up his spine as he worked out the knots, scooting up a bit more as he trailed hands up Tony's back. Tony let his face fall into the sheets “Jesus Steve.” He groaned “Your hands are magic”. Steve's mouth was parted as he moved, fingers kneading firmly as he memorized each noise Tony let slip. Tony let out a soft whimper when Steve his a particularly sensitive area. “You’re too good at this” he groaned appreciatively. Steve swallowed hard, moving a bit so he was straddling Tony's lower back. Tony bit his lip to keep any more obscene sounds from coming out as he arched shamelessly into Steve’s hands
Steve gave him a tiny smile. "You had your reasons for saying no. I don’t know what they are, and I don’t want to pry because you paling that day freaked me out. But you know I wouldn’t hurt you"
Steve's smile grew into a beaming grin. He really did love it when people ate his food and when he was able to take care of them. "You're welcome. Do you want waffles or crepes for breakfast?"
Tony let himself dramatically fall to the mat with a huff “Us tiny humans are exhausted“ he complained.
"Well, we have to stop for food breaks" he teased, digging his thumbs into a large knot between his shoulder blades.
"I've got you" he whispered, slowly moving up to his thighs. Tony sucked in a breath, biting his lip and forcing his body not to react to Steve’s hands. Steve moved slowly, moving to straddle Tony's thighs, working on kinks on his lower back.
Steve paced the commons, pausing every now and then to pinch the bridge of his nose to try and stave off the headache
Steve grinned, looking Tony up and down the blush on the mechanics face just causing him to want to splay Tony out on that couch he pointed to. And see just how many licks it took to make him fall apart. Instead, Steve nodded, his grin having a hint of mischief to it as he turned to flop across the couch. Tony turned back around, immersing himself in his work like usual, forgetting that he had an audience.
"Choose one" Steve growled, leaning over him to murmur in his ear. "Want me in you, you're going to have to pick"
Tony’s eyes widened slightly, mind racing at the thought that Steve COULD throw him over his shoulder. It took him a moment to get his body under control enough to speak. “O-okay” He agreed, running at Steve to try to grab him Steve moved slowly once he felt Tony's arms around him, flipping Tony up and over his shoulder, absently cradling Tony's head so he didn’t smack it when he landed on his back, using the momentum to swing a leg over Tony, straddling his waist with his forearm over Tony's throat, not even his forearm touching skin.
Tony blushed and finished a decent amount of his food. “I can’t eat anymore.” He said with a content sigh. “Where do you want me?” He asked, getting off the stool with a groan, fighting the blush down, he really needed to word things better.
Steve's eyes darkened, his grin turning just a bit darker. "C’mon, Tones, one more. You can take it"
"Jarvis?" Steve asked, flicking his eyes up to the ceiling. "What's the average amount of time between meals for Tony?"
“Should I get used to handsome blonde men cooking for me?” Tony asked, without even thinking about what was coming out of his mouth.
Steve smiled. “Did you sleep well, Tony?" He asked softly, passing him a glass of water. "Food is almost done. Chicken parmesan, salad, and garlic bread"
Tony frowned at Steve’s words, they stung. It felt like Steve was saying he’d be useless in the field. He stood abruptly, almost knocking the chair over. “I’ll do it.” He said to Fury before storming out of the room and slamming the door.
“Don’t treat your elders like that.” Sam pushed right back and chuckled. “Ok. So, yeah, you haven’t broken a sweat. Again. How about a few laps around the gym? Maybe like, ninety for your old age.”
“Tomorrow. We only have some supplies and food to get us through the night but I’ll need to come in and start filling up the kitchen and patching holes. It’ll be nice if I could have a ride to bring all the items back up. Given the distance.”
And had it been anyone other than Black Widow he would’ve exercised his authoritative right as the leader of their little “gang” and punished his friend accordingly for announcing something so monumental and dangerous to his Steve.
“Kinks…oh, yes,” Steve nodded. “Had multiple people decide to tell me about those. You have some…” he guessed, “and you want to bring them in here.” He motioned to their bedroom.
“Of course not.” Steve, at times, had difficulty reading the young man. While kinder than the other two, he had sharp edges and had a tendency of lying to save his own skin. “Just a hard few days.”
“Then hopefully this guy misheard or is lying. But the moment he let that little word slip I knew I had to call you.”
“Ye-ep.” She smirked at whatever she was looking at. “Apparently he wants to have a few words with you. First you’re blonde, then you got gorgeous arms, and now you’re my favorite. He liked to think he was the best in those categories, despite knowing Thor.”
And there he goes again. Tony just apparently said whatever came into his head with no filter. Steve appreciated it. Sort of.
“Not just your father,” Steve tried to comfort. “I was surrounded by scientist a lot. When I wasn’t surrounded by soldiers that is. They all talked like that.” He gave a breathy chuckle. “I’d be forced to listen about neurology and chemical effects often. I picked up a few things but mainly I just learned how to appear like I was listening when really I was sort of sketching things out in my head.”
“Kneel,” Tony pulled at Steve’s hair, his pupils blow wide as his hungry grin grew sharper as Steve instantly did as told. “We’ll take this to the bed soon, love but for now,” he licked his lips and guided Steve towards him, “let me bruise that mouth of yours.”
“He can be sentimental. That wall of his,” she stuffed some more food in her mouth. “He doesn’t show that off to most. You are really special to him.”
“That you apparently have dealt with people who just…” Steve motioned to Tony. “I mean, you are handsome and I guess power is attractive…but just…hello, want to skip off to bed, no need to share names—you’re nice looking enough?”
He really needed to get back on top of people fearing him. Well, maybe it was time to make another public move to ensure the world did not forget that the name Anthony Stark was something to be respected.
Steve just gave him a playful, challenging grin. “If you’re going to push my boundaries we’re going to do the same for you. I’m not going to try to take your position of power away, since of course you are clearly a tyrant--”
“Yeah, that’s diet denial right there.” Tony went over to the counter to pour in some more coffee in his mug. He hated that he agreed with Rhodes and Pepper to not have a coffee machine in his lab so it forced him to move and get away from time to time. “I take it Jarvis is filming?”
Tony gave him another grin, it was sharp and hungry and it struck fear, with a soft sense of excitement, deep inside Steve. “We play, dear heart.”
Tony took a moment to stare…ok; even he could admit a talking raccoon in a space outfit apparently fawning over Thor was a new one. “I suppose you’re talking about me?”
“Perfect!” Tony slapped his hands together. “Natasha will have the names of everyone in the group by then. Our distribution should be finished at the time as well. We’ll make a move let’s say, oh…Jarvis, what’s the schedule looking like this month?”
"I...but..." Steve looked at him, open and confused. "W-What do you want?" At this moment he was willing to give Tony anything,
"I've wanted one for the Avengers for some time now." He pulled his hand back to smile at the design. "Just seems after everything it felt fitting to finally get it."
“Hmm, anything…?” He lapped at Steve’s jaw. “You sure you want to promise me that?” To be cruel, his finger traced the hole and dipped in and Steve was a mess.
“Good.” He bit at Tony’s ear and seductively blew at it, “How rough,” Steve now nipped at Tony’s lips, smirking to himself when he felt Tony begin to harden inside of him again, “do you want to experiment?”
.’ Steve thought before the stars took over his vision and he tilted his head back to let Tony do whatever he wanted with him. He’d never been kissed like this before. He always thought his first intense one would be clumsy and awkward but Tony apparently did not know how to be either with his mouth.
“Tony,” he repeated with a broken moan. He wasn’t sure he was saying the proper thing for the moment but it felt so
"Uuuhm, excuse you? Second? No. You're third." Clint continued and used his thumb to motion between himself and the scary redhead. "Love-child-chicken. You and your sexy greasy Cobain hair can't beat that. I have a son named after her. What do you have? Thighs. That's what you have. No love-child-chicken."
It was a black and white photo in Howard’s office, on the desk, at a close distance where he could grab whenever his mind drifted from work. Tony had caught his father looking at it often, with an expression he could never quite place, and finally the child’s frantic, curious mind needed to know what was in the frame and why it was so special.
“They were able to hide it well enough.” Steve laughed a little. “Hugh was gay. They married so she could keep some respect and he could keep his secret.”
“So…” Tony began, for the hundredth time, but stopped. He returned to pacing, muttering lowly, as he started to feel a familiar sense of panic crawling up his spine. Talking things out was not always his strong suit.
“Well, has everyone calmed down?” He said, sounding much like his old self. He plopped himself comfortably in one of the chair, placing his feet on the table, bringing out his knife once more to play with. “Oh, what scary faces…why so solemn in my grand return? Surely you all had been looking for me?”
“Uhm, a new father?” Steve wasn’t sure if he should stop Tony or not. “I’m sorry but I don’t follow.”
“Excuse me?” He gave a shy smile to the woman. “Sorry to interrupt your reading, but I wanted to ask for some information?”
“The area around here is good for retired life, or at least one of quiet. You’ll find well-worn travelers, scholars, and soldiers within fifty miles here so they will share teachings to the few children.” Sam continued on to fill Steve in on the ways and rituals of the town. Besides the attractions of kind intellects and a strange supernatural shadow, everything else about it was very normal.
"Don't make me sound like a racist." Tony grumped. "And that doesn't answer anything. What. Are. You. Doing. To. Me?"
“By no thanks to your employers.” Tony’s voice was like sharp steel. It was the same angry tone from before.
“T-Tony…” He tried to speak but the pressure was back on his mouth, something flickering against his tongue. Someone was cupping his face, so gently it was painful, and his oxygen was leaving him again before the pressure was gone and those eyes were back.
“Oh, would you look at that…I am so ready for another round of sex. Not exhausted due to my age at all.”
“Certainly seems fair given his former playboy-ways.” Steve wondered if it was fine they were still talking about Bucky. Though, truth be told, Tony did not seem to really hold anything against Bucky—Steve had found the two of them chatting pleasantly on multiple occasions, which just crushed his heart to little bits. Because it was only Steve still had an issue with.
It was loud with delicious food, plenty of drinks, and beautiful people for all of his loyal followers. There was not a single soul Tony saw that was bored. Even uptight Bruce was laughing over his rum and coke with Rhodey as they shared some boring story about how great they were. Natasha and Clint were in an epic stalemate with darts while the crowd surrounding them kept swelling their egos by rooting and hollering. Clint was starting to sway though so Tony made a mental note to not tread too close lest he earned a dart to his fine ass. Thor was leading his third drinking game of the night. Already four patrons were passed out over a couch or a bar because of him. Tony knew there would be vomit found in some plant the next morning. Hopefully no one died because...yep, Thor was urging for a fourth round. He'd better get that stopped sooner than later for the safety of the public.
He laughed and slowly the head of the armor disappeared and his Tony appeared. “That is one way to say it.”
He worked, too, went back to work when he was supposed to and each day he’d see Steve, and they’d smile across the room at each other, and that was that. The moments in each day where a glimmer of hope appeared, and although he told himself it was just friendship, he couldn’t help but hope it meant something more.
It becomes common, an unspoken trust between two aching souls to help one another, simply through company. Soothing silence becomes small touches and short words, evolves into tearful hugs, which in turn evolves into soft kisses and small gestures. They don’t label themself anything, what they have seeming so fragile that even mentioning it might break it, although the others notice. They leave it be, a quiet understanding between the five.
“I loved him, you know?” He finally said after what seemed like forever. He sighed, and placed his head into his hands. “Bucky. I loved him.”
“No not at all” Tony spoke with a smirk, before moving to his bed and the dildo, picking up a bottle of lube from a table, his confidence surging at the other man’s interest.
“I got drunk and made bad decisions, and then passed out, what else is new.” He spoke, pushing past Pepper to sit on the side of his bed, glancing briefly at the awkward looking red-haired girl half sitting up on his spare bed.
They stay like that for a time, moans echoing through the room and cries of expletives and each others names, before Steve begins to feel the pleasure build up.
“I don't mind at all, you may continue.” He spoke, his voice lower than usual and full of authority.
“Hey Tony?” He he had started, walking into the workshop where Tony was fiddling with some wires, “What’s porn?”
They became stronger, eventually Steve started working out again, and Tony ventured into his abandoned workshop, and all of them, Bruce, Natasha, Rhodey, Tony, and Steve, they all fell into a rhythm again. Bruce and Tony worked together, building and inventing together like everything was okay, because for once, it kind of was. Natasha helped Rhodey out at the military, found a place in their ranks. Tony built Steve an art studio, just next to his workshop, and Steve found himself sometimes working with Natasha and Rhodey, and sometimes working on his art. They found peace.
The avengers started having dinner together, and although often it was quiet, only the sound of the radio in the background, it meant a lot to each of them. Rhodey or Steve would cook, and some days, on the good days, Tony would help, and they would sit down to eat together. Natasha sat next to Bruce, her legs often across his lap, Steve sat beside Tony, who came to the table some days wrapped in a blanket, and Rhodey, who sat at the head of the table, a pained smile as he watched the others quietly interact. He was felt like a father to them, to the 100 year old super soldier, his genius mentally ill best friend, a soft assassin and her quiet science boyfriend. They were a broken family, but they were a family.
“Me too, fuck” Tony stammered, the pleasure of being fucked and also Steve’s hand on his dick overwhelming.
The only thing that rivaled how bad that whole experience had been was that everyone knew. He hated it. He hated the sympathetic glances or the weird stares, the way everyone treated awkwardly when he went back to school. The way when he broke down in class and left nobody said anything, just stared. He had been disconnected from the world around him.
So that night, in the privacy of his own floor, in his bedroom with he door locked, he had discovered the wide expanses of his new discovery. He had stayed up far too late, watching video after video, enthralled and aroused to all new levels. Although he wouldn’t have admitted it to anyone, including himself, the fact that Tony knew he was doing this spurred his arousal quite a bit.
Surprisingly, he managed to make it through the rest of the interaction without incident, even staying to help clean up against the will of his dick. However, after two hours, far too long for him to still even have any amount of his previous erection left, he still could not get his mind off of the erotic imagery playing through his head. So half way through debriefing he excused himself, some sarcastic excuse that was half hearted and spoken while exiting the room, and left to his workshop.
“Outside is scary. We should stay here, not leave.” He said, his body tensing up at the mention of leaving his safe space.
There he sat, Pepper, holding him tightly and thinking through options, Tony gently crying into her sweater, curled up against her. After Tony had stopped crying, Pepper sat him up and looked into his eyes.
“Wha- No?” He spoke, suddenly being shaken out of the pleasant haze he had fallen into as they ate, and taking in the far too brightly coloured poster that Pepper had brought up on her phone, “I know I said I needed actual therapy, but that was a joke. I don’t need to go sit in a circle and listen to sob stories for two hours.”
“Generally, the materials, the makeup, the tech inside it. I made it a while ago so I didn’t have to take things completely apart when I wanted to figure them out. It’s like a fancy x-ray.” He said offhandedly, already focusing in on his computer and moving around the image, “I might still need to fiddle around with it a bit because I’m still working out the kinks of this whole thing, but yeah! If you wanna leave you can” He finished with, and even though he was staring at the computer the sadness at the concept of the two leaving was obvious in his voice.
“Can you please pass the remote?” Came a whisper, and Steve turned to see the man, tears in his eyes, wrapped in a blanket, holding his shaking hand out.
“So you know all you need to about my arm now?” Bucky said as he took his arm back, looking rather suspicious.
Steve had disappeared, and Tony decided that now was a good time to go talk to him. He did genuinely have something to talk to him about, he had been working on Steve’s equipment, and needed his input, and if he happened to “accidentally” walk in on him with a dildo in his ass, who was to blame him?
A smaller, remaining Hydra operation had in desperation, began a public attack, using stolen technology they had turned into attack robots, and currently were causing quite the commotion.
“Scanning” Came the voice, which even itself seemed amused, and after a few seconds the voice returned with “Scan complete, uploaded to your desktop.”
The next morning he awoke around 12, and groggily dragged himself out of bed, sighing as he remembered his obligation for the day, and turned his computer on. Although the thoughts were lesser now that the endless cycle had finally been broken, he still couldn’t bear to do anything other than code in his free time, no other coping mechanisms have ever worked for him as he drifted through the world post-kidnapping. He was still working on the same AI, and as he approached finality, he finally tested it out.
“Ye-ah! All good, just having a good time and got carried away. Did Steve tell you that?” Tony replied, almost dropping the tray as he abruptly remembered what he had been aggressively ignoring.
That was a separate issue, however. His current issue was the beautiful tall probably-art-major sitting across the room from him, who really needed to stop looking so damn good. It wasn’t only at the cafe that Tony saw him, he also happened to be in the same dorm hall as him, only a few rooms down. They rarely ran into each other, though. Their schedules seemed to be complete opposites from one another. So here Tony was, standing at the counter, watching him draw away the early morning, his heart aching and his soul wishing for more. As he tended to other customers, he kept an eye on the man until he left, and he felt his heart pull as he exited, but quietly went back to his work.
He can’t handle not being inside him anymore, and pulls the dildo out of the other man’s ass, causing Steve to break off the kiss and sit up, looking down in confusion until Tony lines his dick up and pushes into him, and Steve takes it from there to begin riding him, bouncing up and down as he is already ready and prepped, and Tony, overwhelmed by the sensation, grips his hips and helps him move.
Half an hour later he was standing outside the door to the help group, next to Pepper, and very distinctly not smiling.
Bruce is a lost soul, sometimes found sitting by himself staring into space, but most often found working away in the workshop. He never gets angry anymore, he can barely hold on to the small bit of his spirit that is left, because even the Hulk inside him feels the loss and has retreated to a far corner of his mind. He works into the late hours of the night, not quite sure what his goal is, just researching and working on whatever he can, rarely stopping. He’s shy and quiet around the others, at first trying to sit with Tony, but finding the darkness emanating from the broken soul of his friend suffocating, and the silence as he quietly brings up scientific topics too loud. He is alone, that is until one night when Natasha walks into the workshop and sits next to him, tear stained cheeks and broken eyes, and tells him if he ever brings this up again she’ll kill her.
“C’mon Tony, you can’t stay here forever. We’re going to get you out in the world so you can see it isn’t so bad. Exposure therapy and all?”
“Come for me, so pretty Steve, come on my dick” Tony lets out, reaching between them to grasp his dick, grasping his hips hard enough to leave bruises as he pounds into him. It’s only moments before Steve is clenching around Tony’s dick, coming in spurts that land across the man underneath him’s chest, and the feeling of Steve coming around him sends Tony over the edge, and he orgasms into Steve, and they both stay there for a few moments, high on pleasure and overwhelming sensations.
So there he lay, staring at the ceiling, waiting for the floor to open up and swallow him whole, and put him out of his misery. He knew he was sulking, he did it far too often to be fair, but he didn’t want to function. However, thinking back to his group sessions, to all he had been taught, he sighed and got out of bed. Key point number 2: don’t wallow in your sadness. Get up and do something. So he did, he got up, went down to the lab, and continued working on Bucky’s arm. He was almost done, which meant the work was all very finishing details, which meant the difficult parts. The parts he would have loved to have Steve there for. He didn’t want to think about that, however, so he put all his thought into the finishing touches of the arm. Working on the parts that would be inserted into his shoulder, where the previous arm had been worked into Bucky’s body. He hoped, deep down, that what had happened the previous night wouldn’t affect him and Bucky, because he really enjoyed having someone who understood. It made him feel better about his experiences.
“Yeah you work at the cafe I always go to, I see you there all the time.” He smiled warmly, and Tony almost melted on the spot.
That had caused Tony to fumble, electrocuting himself, and look up as a blush formed across his cheeks.
That was how he had found himself sitting at his chair, thinking about hs teammate fucking himself down on the Iron Man dildo he had bought, and coming into his hand. As he cleaned himself up, he quickly made sure that when it was delivered he would be notified. He was still confused, he had looked at the site, and had found they had quite a selection, and wondered why Steve had gotten the Iron Man themed one. He wanted to believe it was for a reason, his fantasies about Steve severely influencing his hopes.
He didn’t spend long in the shower, quickly washed his hair, rinsed himself off, and turned it off. He felt faint as he dried his body with his towel, before wrapping himself in it and quickly walking back to his room.
“Yeah I have no idea, maybe he’s just stressed?” Tony replied, ignoring the look Bucky gave him like he knew he was lying.
As they begin to come down Tony pulls out, and they both collapse together, a mess of heavy breathing. Tony uses a blanket to wipe the come off their bodies, before throwing it away and falling asleep underneath the super soldier, and their soft snores echo through the room.
As the scene ended he was back in his dorm room, sitting in front of his computer. His hands shook, and sweat dripped down his face. There were tears in his eyes as he quietly crawled into his bed, curling up under the covers and closing his eyes as he shook. He didn’t sleep, simply lay there, unable to move, for hours on end. When he finally found himself again, when the lead that filled his soul lightened and he could finally get up, leave his bed, stand and stretch his aching limbs. He looked outside, seeing the sun had risen, and realized that an entire day had passed since he’d been at work. Luckily enough for him, he didn’t work today. So he found his stash of energy drinks, chugged two, and went back to work at his computer, focusing as hard as he could so to avoid the memories that tugged at the edges of his mind.
This caused her to laugh, which woke up Natasha who, in a sleep filled haze, shoved Pepper off of her on to the ground. Pepper, instinctually, latched onto Natasha as she fell, which meant that both of them fell off the bed and started laughing, as Tony watched from his domain of sadness.
It was an hour later when he found Steve. Hiccuping and stumbling across the party, he had spotted him drawing, and with his intoxicated brain denying all logic, the possibilities of this interaction going sideways, and he had drunkenly half fallen across the room into Steve’s lap. This, in addition to his shirtlessness due to a forgotten game of strip-poker, was enough to startle Steve immensely.
“Hey Stark, you good?” He heard over the comm line, as he flew off to go take on enemies elsewhere, ignoring the way his eyes traced over Captain Rogers body, and he felt a rush of blood to his semi-hard dick.
“We’re going to go get some food now, okay? Where do you want to go?” She walked over and sat beside him, smiling as he rested his head on her shoulder.
“I’m going back to bed,” Tony said, and stood up and started to cross the room before Pepper stopped him.
“You’re prettyy” Tony said, finally sitting cross-legged in front of Steve, who was sitting against the wall.
They still had bad days, but they were together now. They were a family, and that meant they took care of each other. Through thick or thin, through bad days and good.
This of course, was when Tony opened his eyes, and looked around at the group gathered above him, and then at the naked man sleeping on top of his also naked body.
“Oh Steve, I know you did. I know he was so much greater than what I saw of him because I could see that you saw more. I wish you still had him because all I want is for you to be happy.”
“Right yeah, uh, normal human stuff. No. I just think prosthetics are cool and this is the coolest one I’ve ever seen.” Tony commented, as he curled back up into the bean bag and subsequently went back into his shell.
“Tony I promise you it’s not your fault, I promise you. We all messed up, but I’ll be damned if any of that was your fault, any of what happened. We were fighting against the most powerful evil in the universe and we lost but now we have to live with that, okay?” He knew he sounded kind of harsh, but he needed Tony back. He couldn’t lose him again.
Steve saw Tony as a representation of the 21st century. Fame, power, money, technology, and sexuality. It intimidated him quite a bit to see someone who was so deeply comfortable in everything he was still a bit scared and confused by. He couldn’t see the part of Tony that absolutely hated quite a bit of that, but that was another story.
