“Well, I’m not one to defend another alpha’s omega. I’m not even sure I really like him all that much, but you need him on your side for this coming Council meeting.”
“Sure. Sure it will.” Tony’s staring at his mouth. “But we could find so many other ways it would be useful, interesting.”
Steve nearly skips out of the workshop and Tony stares after him, lost in the look of the man as he disappears from view. He stands there, frozen by the hope and promise of something more. When he comes to himself, he blows out his held breath and wonders if there’s anything more impossible. The idea of Steve Rogers as a promise, a hope fulfilled still astounds him. It’s only been a few weeks, yet it keeps him off balance. Maybe that’s the reason he sees ghosts trying to upset the possibilities in every shadow. But there are odd instances that he cannot parse, cannot figure out.
“I’m here to look over the warrior blocks for a suitable Omega Warrior.” He frowns at her and she only smiles. At least he can placate her; there are others in his Family who are not so easily pacified or pleased with him.
If both Pepper and Rhodey think Steve is a liability for Tony, then it must be true. He would trust them with his life. Yet his circle of people he trusts constricts and narrows. He thinks about the kiss he shared with Steve under the stars. He hadn’t led Steve on – in fact, Tony had decided after things didn’t really work out with Pepper that he wouldn’t seek a relationship. Relationships are too hard for someone in his position. A rich, blind man he’s just asking for someone to scam him. The idea that Steve had scammed him haunts the memory, though. He specifically recalls saying to Steve that he hadn’t been flirty or tried anything – yet there they were, kissing on the hilltop under the stars. All of it had been a scam, but for what end?
It didn’t work. When he opened his eyes again, Steve glanced around, and he sat in the bed in the tenement’s bedroom. His chest was bare, and he hated to think about what he might be wearing – or not wearing- under the thin sheet laying over his legs. Tony stood to the side of the bed, thankfully donned sleeping pants but not much else. Steve glimpsed the arc reactor scar on his chest which wove into the brand from the soul mark. The scar became the focal point like the sun radiating out within the brand. Like Steve’s the brand covered his whole chest and down his torso.
Tony scoffs at him. “Just minutes ago, Obie, you wanted me to declare myself the King. What the fuck? Get your motivations on track.” He narrows his eyes at Obie. “And don’t fucking touch me again.”
Tony only grumbles and bends forward. The gaunt look of his face from before would be welcome now, because death looks as if it has taken hold. The tiny door to the device swings open on his chest. Drools streams out of his mouth and he makes tiny whimpering noises.
“You told Natasha? What did you say? What did you – did you tell her what I told you? Does she know?” Steve’s nearly frantic now.
The next chapter we'll be stepping a little further away from the Pretty Woman plot line as we get into the nitty gritty of the war. Steve and Tony will share a sweet moment and then - well, all hell will break loose!
Furrowing his brows, Tony points to the cylinder. “Do you think you could wire this? Thread it through? I’m a little shaky.”
“Right off,” Steve mumbles and it hurts to talk. She looks at him with a pity in her eyes that stabs straight to his heart. “Will they heal?”
Tony, whose back is to the wide elevators, turns around and invites Steve. “No, come in. You’ve met Pepper, but not Rhodey. He’s here for the weekend with his fiancé Carol Danvers.”
“I think it is,” Sam said. “If Stark can really pull off what he did in the church, then we have a leader whose suffering. I’m not one to leave that fact hanging like a thread.”
“You need a moment to heal, to adjust, to figure out-.” He stops because he can’t say anymore and Steve doesn’t quiz him on what more he wanted to say. “Do they know where you live?”
“Bruce, I-.” Steve started and stopped when he saw the red of Bruce’s eyes. He looked as if he mourned yet another choice taken away from him.  Steve’s throat felt dry. “I’m sorry.”
Steve deals with the aftermath of finding the rest of their soul pack. Things don't go as planned...
It starts easy and soft. Tony uses his hands, his fingers to read Steve’s face. He feels the muscles high on his cheeks showing that Steve’s smiling and when he moves to brush a hand near his eyes he encounters the tiniest stain of a tear. He bends down and kisses the tear away, murmuring that it’s all right, they have all night and more. His lips find Steve’s and there’s chaste kissing at first, but then Tony begs entrance and Steve parts his lips. As Tony explores, Steve makes the most delicious moan into his mouth that sends shivers down his spine and spikes his desire.
“Yeah, ask old Capsicle if he wants to hang out. See how the other half lives. How life can be great without all that,” Tony said and cringed inside. How much was he trying to convince her and how much was he trying to sway himself?
“Living like you are now you’re asking for a stroke or worse,” Strange says. “We don’t even have to do brain surgery. We could deliver it through the spinal cord if we still have the implant as a homing device. After we can remove the implant and you’ll be free of the headaches.”
Letting even the other team members know this bit of information teetered on breach of contract. Tony had talked it over with Steve the night before as he sat on the bed and Steve held himself still and quiet.
Of course, Tony can’t have that. He won’t allow the guy to just walk out, not when it isn’t his choice. “Wait. Wait. Come sit down. You don’t know how to fight for yourself, do you?”
He wishes he had water or something to drink. The electrical shock left him parched and shaken. No pack, no water. He hopes Tony still has his pack, but who knows what happened. Maybe Ultron wants to watch his rat in a maze with no reward at the end. That rankles him and he ends up turned around and angry with himself that he ended up lost in thought. He needs to pay attention in order to map out the twists and turns of the maze which so far consists of dull gray rock walls with a stony path. Water puddles on the path making the idea of touching the wall even less appealing.
Steve hasn’t heard a lot about the Secretary of Prime Station; he knows that Secretary Pierce’s father played a role in the first incursions decades ago. The Secretary spent much of his life playing the bureaucrat throughout the governments of the Conclave, serving for one faction or another over the years. The independence of the station lured the Secretary to service on Prime. He’s been the head of the station for over a decade. Steve’s never met him and had really hoped never to meet him.
Before the woman answers, she sizes them up. Her breathing huffs and her footsteps are heavy on the broken hard wood floors. “Look like you ran away from a wedding. He the groom?”
“Please, Steve. Just wear it and think of this as a mission. Clint and Scott want to see their families again,” Tony says and there’s a desperate glint in his eyes. Steve put it there – that pleading look- Steve’s responsible for so much.
His sight catches the workbench, the armor he’s built waiting to be assembled. Maybe it is time. Maybe mystery woman is right. “Steve? Steve, can you hear me?”
Clint smirked and, as the doors to the elevator opened, he replied, “That’s putting it mildly. Luckily though, Nat had an ace up her sleeve.”
“I think I said something in the past, but mainly to pay the bills. I couldn’t get a showing to save my life with fine arts. Step up on a rock about 3 inches.” Steve waits as Tony follows. “Present position excepted; I don’t really love technical drawing. That was out. I love stories. And I’m working on the one now.”
Steve eyes Wanda and Vision and then clears his throat. “Tony needs someone to watch over him during the upgrade. He’s going to get some sleep and we want to make sure he doesn’t have any issues-.”
Ultron knows the details of the inside of the Quin Jet down to the last button. The crash mangled most of the jet, yet the minutiae from reality is still visible. He drops his pack and goes to the cockpit. Checking the readouts and trying to get the engines to turn over proves futile. It’ll be shelter but not much more.  The first rule of survival shelter, food, water. That’s all they need. Shelter the most important because of the weather.
Tony chews back his words, lets the burning sensation in his mouth cause his eyes to fill with tears again. “You don’t know that.” His voice sounds ruined and he doesn’t know if it’s from the hot coffee or the pain of revelation. “You don’t.” He pushes away from her and goes to sit in a single chair that is massively uncomfortable.
In the end, they all cowed to Bruce’s words. They decided on a visiting schedule, but Sam insisted on being first to sit with Steve. Tony resented it, but it would give him time to work on the Mantra as well as figure out what the hell he wanted out of this soul pack thing. He spent days, months, hell, years hating the idea that he’d been left out but now, he skittered away.  He needed time to adjust. That’s what he told himself. He agreed, but before he left the room he asked, “Can I have a minute?”
“You’re not isolated. You have a home. You do know that, right?” Tony said and his hand reached out, touched Steve’s which laid on his crossed legs. It stayed there – laying on his, skin warmed by the fire.
He goes over and over this idea in his head as he tips his hat to passersby, as he practices what he’s going to tell Bucky. Of course, he knows it’s all a lie. He can’t say no, not to those eyes, not to that cavalier gaze and slightly sardonic smile. He wouldn’t say no in a thousand years.
“Off the living room,” Tony says and nods toward what he hopes is the general direction of the open living room, dining room area.
When he searched his memory to figure out how he got on the Helicarrier, how he escaped the cell, Steve found nothing. How had he gotten away from Pierce and Ross? His brain pounded with an insistent ache. His memories fogged, and he slipped into an uneasy sleep. The turmoil growing inside of him seemed to take on a form, like a beast inside. He fought it through his dreams and nightmares. When he woke some hours later as evidenced by the light from the windows, Steve blinked to discover Tony sitting next to the bed. Steve sat up, though the room looped, and he swallowed down the nauseating bile.
Steve put his hands up in surrender. “You don’t have to do this, Sam. It won’t change the way we work with you or think about you. Well, it makes it easier to work an op together. We always know where we are and the hazards instinctively.”
“No, I’m supporting myself,” Tony had said as they worked out how he would deal with the interface. Rhodey had been one of his first collaborators.
“Out of line for calling me a pervert? Or for being the regular ass that you are?” Tony shot back. He could try harder, he admitted to himself but the fact was when Tony was cornered he snarled and bit back.
She eyed him, the drink in his hand, the way he tried to lean casually. The profiler was out and was merciless. “Well, SHIELD wasn’t all that thrilled that you didn’t call us in, or at least ask for the Avengers to help,” Natasha said. It irked him that she acted more at ease in his home than he felt.
“Always a pleasure to see you, Captain,” Tony says and his eyes twinkle as if he’s playing a game. He’s the cat and Steve’s the mouse.
Tony was his everything, though even today after six years together Steve knew that he worried about their relationship. So many times, Tony asked about consent and whether or not Steve ever regretted what happened.
He jars himself out of the moment, and sits back. “I’m sure I do not, sir.” He moves his eyes around the room and cannot believe how close he came, how far he moved into the realm he promised not to tread.
“You have what you need. It’s all in your brain. Right now, in this outer area, let’s call it the sanctum you can make anything in your head and make it real. Once we get into his programming, we have to have what we need. He’ll shut us down. We won’t be able to take anything else with us.”
The meeting dissipated and Tony whispered his release word. Steve slowly stood up, held Tony in his big strong arms. His words were faint, heavy, groggy. “That went better than expected.”
He places his forehead against Steve’s chest as he inhales the rich scent of their musk. “I need to tell you something.”
Within him, in his own mind there’s a voice yelling out, denying these truths, telling him he’s not that at all. Steve refuses to hear, knowing that Ultron would do anything to twist his thoughts, to poison him against Tony. He latches on harder to his internal monologue of truth, shunning the pleading in his brain. Just as he does his hold shatters and shreds, everything disintegrates around him and he loses his hold of Tony. He grapples, falling, searching in a world of digital streams of data. He finds nothing to hold onto, nothing to break his fall, no sign of Tony anywhere.
She muttered in Russian and then shifted her attention to Steve only. “I’m sorry. He was your friend, I know. There was nothing I could do. They got to him before we arrived. I don’t think Shuri can save him.”
Tony jerks a few more time and then lays his head on Steve’s back. He’s spent and tired, Steve feels the same way. His legs wobble but as Tony’s cock slips out of him, Steve turns around and lightly kisses him.
“Right now?” Tony grimaces but those fire stained eyes darken with longing. “We’re souls stripped apart from one another, circling and revolving. I don’t think there’s any other way.”
As he veers through the atmosphere he determines that she’s right, Pepper is always right. He needs to straighten up and analyze what Stane has been doing, stop allowing the press and the pundits their day about his company, and transform his life. This is what he’s here for, not this endless search, not this hopelessness grown from nightmares.
Chaos.  The room is the very definition of chaos. The inner parts of computers, AI, and consoles are strewn all over the floor and on every level tabletop and flat surface. Wires tangle the pathway across the floor and in the midst of it all, the prince stands with his back to Steve, speaking animatedly to a projection.
“He is not having heart attack and this is not nitroglycerine.” She snaps but Clint has already stopped seizing and she only holds the bottle up to the light to check the number of pills. She curses.
“I want you to know, this week has been a wonder to me,” Tony says. His focus drops and he traces the checkboard pattern on the blanket. “I know our time is almost up.” His voice cracks. “I know I’ll miss you. You see-.”
“A lot of the old world was plagued with falsehoods and exaggerations. You should know better,” Tony says and he tires of the ridiculous conversations. “On your knees, Omega.”
“I think we should get Wong over here for a meeting,” Steve added. It wasn’t just an idea but a declaration, a pronouncement.
Hulk opens his mouth wide in an angry roar. In a fit of inspiration and desperation, Steve dives his hand in and seizes the monster’s tongue. He yanks with all his might and the Hulk goes wild. Before he can bite down on Steve, he jerks away his hand and punches the Hulk directly in the throat. It won’t down the beast but it’s enough to free Steve. He rolls away from the Hulk as the monster gurgles from the fist to his trachea.
“It doesn’t matter,” Natasha said.  Her eyes and voice were as cold as the Russian winters. “To them, we’re all a moment’s notice from what they did to your friend.”
“Even the best of us fall, Captain. Even the best,” Ross said and slid his finger out. This time he didn’t just let it drip on the floor. This time he held his finger out for Steve to see the crimson stains. He waited only a few seconds before he brought it to his lips and slipped the whole of his finger in his mouth, sucking the blood off. When he finished he dropped his hand and said, “No difference, no difference at all. You’re just the same nobody you’ve always been.”
“This doesn’t have to be a funeral, you know, Stark. This isn’t the end. It could be the beginning.”
“Like particles entangled. That means-.” Tony starts but Natasha finishes, “You’ll be able to find him in the Keep.”
“Great,” Tony says. “Here we go.” Tony slips the glasses on, touches a pressure point on the back of his neck, and then the side of the glass frame. “Holy shit.”
“You don’t know the half of it. I almost couldn’t leave work. In fact, I can’t stay. There’s a meeting with the Secretary of Human Security. He’s coming down to the V-Corps to address the rank and file and then I have a meeting one on one with him.”  He wrapped an arm around Tony. Something cold ran down his spine as he laid there embraced by warmth.
It’s not to be, because as soon as Steve steps away Tony slides off the horse again. Steve’s quick enough to catch him.
If he needs to tear away the wall with his bare hands he will. “What does that mean; not really?” He picks up his shirt and shoves it into Blu- no Steve – as in Steve Rogers’ hands. “Put this one, at least.” When Steve tries to struggle into the shirt, Tony stops him. “Down below, unless you want your dick to get sunburnt.”
The vendor walks up to them and places a tray with steaming containers of soup and a plate with breads, cheese, and butters. A thermos is also set on the blanket with mugs. The vendor nods to the prince and then whistles as he leaves. Steve cranes his neck to watch the man leave.
Steve blinks a few times to get the disorientation to dissipate. It only works minimally, but enough that he can, at least, feel the floor and know it from the ceiling of the cave. “Sorry, sorry, what’d I say?”
“I’m leaving. I’ll talk to Nat about providing you a replacement. I don’t expect anything from you, don’t worry about that.”
That jolted Tony back to the present and out of the weavings of the soul bond. “What?” Tony asked as Clint and Sam along with Bruce headed toward the elevators with their luggage as well.
“Okay, I give up. What’s this about the Shire? Has Thor’s brother done something to the Penthouse? Are you walking through different dimension? What’s going on?”
“Well, isn’t that nice.” Not even an itch of surprise. Fury cocked the brow over his eye patch and templed his fingers.  “Tell no one else.”
“Yes. As soon as I was able, once my parents died, I found Ana and brought her back. Pepper and Happy helped me nurse her back to health. She doesn’t talk about Jarvis. I don’t ask, but I think she likes to talk to AI JARVIS because he sounds like her Jarvis.” He closes his eyes and quiets. Steve holds him and swishes the water around them.
“No one is going to control me,” Steve said. No one could ever control Steve, not Bucky, not Peggy, and especially not the US Army. SHIELD was nothing in comparison. “I’m going. I need the job.”
Steve gritted his teeth and closed his eyes. He tried the Mantra to quell the seeping of his feelings through the bond, but doing it felt disingenuous. He hung his head. “Sorry, Buck. I can’t. I’m so sorry.” It wasn’t Bucky’s responsibility to take care of Steve – not anymore. “It’s not your responsibility. We’re not kids anymore. You need -.”
A quick nap on the train to New York would do him good. They paid for their tickets and loaded up in the quiet car. Clint waited for Steve to pick a seat. Steve took the window seat, ready to cozy up against the side of the train car and doze for the ride. Clint scanned the compartment and when satisfied, sat down. He didn’t pull out his phone or a book or anything. He just stayed focused.
“You don’t have a television.” Tony lounges on the bed, spent and naked, but curiously happy. He feels like he’s in a domestic scene and that makes no sense at all.
As quickly as the apparition appeared, it disappears. Only a cold chill down Tony’s spine tells him anything at all happened.
“Fury is not about to help us,” Steve says and swings his feet over the side of the cot. He sways a little, but rights himself. “He’s too busy making nice, nice with the governor.”
Tony smirks and grabs Steve’s hand, leading him quietly past the nursery and toward their master bedroom at the end of the hall. They live in a large log cabin in the woods, but everything is updated and beautiful. Steve has a touch that makes it both homey and modern. Tony closes the door behind them and Steve kisses him with a gentle touch before Tony backs away and flops on the bed.
Cho places a soft hand on his shoulder, close to where his gland should sit. “We’re going to try our best. We’ll get him ready to be placed in the cradle.”
“If I do that,” Steve whispers. “Then I’ll lose you as well. I’m going to lose you anyhow, but then you’ll be in danger.” He bows his head. “Just bring me home. I need to get everyone together.”
“We can sit and look at the stars for a while. We don’t have to go back to the house right away,” Steve says almost in a whisper.  It’s cold out, but Steve doesn’t care. He wants to cherish this moment.
If Bruce stuck around, then the obvious choice for this venture would have been the good doctor. Two massive brains are better than one. What good does he have to offer Tony in the middle of journey through an artificial brain.
“The soul pack is Steven’s center. Without us, he drifts on waters as if he’s sent to Valhalla,” Thor said in a whisper. “We must pull him back from the edge of the cascades before he falls over and is lost to us forever.”
Tony nods, accepting Steve’s word without further explanation. Steve appreciates it and he gestures for Tony to join him. They walk toward the Inn; in the time Steve rested, the town’s come to life. Several of the citizens tip their hats to Steve and he stops multiple times to discuss any concerns or worries. He spends some time at the General Store going over a probable burglary with the proprietor, Phil Coulson.
“Ah! You almost sound modern,” Tony said and there was a twinkle in his eyes that somehow made Steve blush far too much. Tony snickered in response and that just made Steve want to punch him. Thankfully, the object of his ire proceeded without any knowledge of Steve’s annoyance. “So, how did it happen with Bruce?”
“Steve? What is it? Why the visuals? I’m a mess and I have to get ready for the Synthezoid representative.” She yawns. “Yesterday was crazy. What’s going on?” Her accent tilts her tone.
“Yeah,” Steve said as he went to the door to scoop up some snow with the kettle. “Me too. Been having very vivid dreams.” He hadn’t meant to admit that part, but it felt good to finally say it out loud to Tony. He opened the cabin door and peered around, trying to get his bearings, but the forest speckled with snow and ice isolated them from everything and everyone else. He used the kettle to shove the snow directly into it. He shut the door with Tony hovering close behind him.
Steve serves a plate filled with bacon. He invites Tony to join him. “Well, I’m glad you’re awake. It was kind of lonely last night. I started a fire. It was a little chilly this morning even with the furnace on.”
“To free ourselves we need to take down the Soul Keeper.” Steve doesn’t expect an answer. He knows the truth – that he died an old man after long years spent in another timeline only to be reborn to fight again. To set things right in the afterlife.
Steve recalls that’s when the Hero of the Conclave ended up replacing his own heart with an artificial one. He’s still not sure how that works or what kinds of scars the prince actually has since Tony hasn’t taken off his shirt in front of Steve yet.
“I know, big guy. I’ll miss you, too. But I can’t stay here any longer. This is almost done. A few more connections and I’ll be able to test it out.” It’s been too long already. Tony’s ribs are nearly healed. His arm and wrist feel better. Time is marching onward and he’s playing Tarzan. Pushing on him with his head, Blu rubs and ducks his head under Tony’s hand. “It’s better this way.”
“Yeah, it is,” Steve said. “I’m grateful, Tony. To the whole team, the whole pack for coming with me. I can’t imagine going through Peggy’s funeral with no one, or even just one of you.  Everyone here means so much.”
“You liked the travel, that’s good. This position might involve some travel. Do you think you could handle that – your family okay with you traveling?” Tony waits, reading the way Steve moves in his seat, the sweat on his brow.
“Take whatever time you need,” she says and she rights the chair and settles down. “Once he wakes up, I’ll get him to eat.”
“Damn fool, is what he is,” Bucky says as he leans against the doorframe of their one room flat. “If he’d a let me come with-.”
“Good luck, Captain,” Rhodes says and the connection ends. In just a few minutes Steve receives the code and instructions to input it into the computer. He’s not going to do it, not any time soon, but he’ll keep it in his back pocket literally, just in case.
That is the height of vulgarity. Everyone knows the Soul Companion isn't named, can't be named until the moment of pairing. Pairing can happen at any time with anyone.  But he knows the possibility of pairing is slim to none for his Soul. It's broken, unhealthy, and unwanted. He accepted that years ago.
She eases away and he locks the reactor in place. He should think about a personalized mechanism so no one can just yank the thing out. It will be on the next upgrade.
The shock of the last hour hit Tony, and he stumbled to land next to Steve. Natasha took that as a sign and moved away. Not knowing what to do, Tony only gathered Steve to his chest and embraced him. His cold skin felt so wrong, so horribly strange. He cupped Steve’s face and searched his bleary gaze. “Don’t leave me.”
Natasha bit back her words by chewing her bottom lip. She relented. “Do as you want but know this: if he shows even an inkling of betraying us for his own kind-.”
“And I trust-.” Steve stops. His own nature worked against him in his Realm. “Tell me, tell me everything.”
He rubbed his hand up and down Tony’s back, trying to help but feeling the same hopelessness. “He’s a good man. I know you don’t want to hear that, but Hydra is responsible. Bucky – even when I had nothing, I had Bucky.” He continued talking even though he knew that Tony didn’t want to hear it. He rushed through the words. “That tenement apartment. I lost it. I think I told you that. I couldn’t afford the rent. I couldn’t afford my food, or medicines. Nothing. Bucky, he took me in. He wanted to help. Even when he went away to the war, he still cared. I stayed in his apartment and he paid the rent.”
Yinsen smiles ruefully. “I doubt that is true.” He chews on a piece of meat and then shrugs. “He came back a few hours ago. He had blood on him.”
“I can support him and say it until I’m blue in the face, but he has to be willing to -.” Tony stopped. He wasn’t sure what he was looking for from Steve. He recalled those erotic dreams, the shared one in London.  Yet, he wanted something more.
When Jarvis is out of earshot, Tony frowns. “He’s lying. He always lies to me. Ana is sick and he hasn’t told me yet.”
“But it did enough because you went into heat during your time in Wakanda.” It’s a statement of fact not a question. Steve remains silent. “God, it’s true. It’s all true. You went into presentation with someone else. Was it Nat or T’Challa?”
When their lips touch, the newness and the trepidation falls away while their desire and eagerness blossoms and grows. In his day, Tony’s kissed so many people, but it’s never been quite like this, never felt like he wanted it to last beyond the physical sensation, that he wanted it to develop into something deep and abiding. He thought he loved Pepper, but it was never like this, never so profoundly intense. He never knew this before in his life. The touch of Steve’s lips, the exploration and taste of his tongue sets Tony on fire not only in his body, but in his soul and his mind. His entire self yearns and wants.  He grasps hold of Steve’s shirt and holds on but knows he needs to let go; he needs to ensure they take this slow. He wants it to last, to endure.
His path zooms south as JARVIS scans the road for recent activity. Most of what they find is local traffic, farmers crisscrossing the countryside with their everyday workload. It’s getting late and the sun starts to set. Tony notices most of the old trucks and a few cars on the roadway stop for evening prayers. Men climb out of the vehicles, lay down their prayer rug facing Mecca, and take to their evening devotions. He ensures that he’s as quiet as possible when passing over them. It’s this small fact that sets the large SUV apart from the other travelers on the road.
“The implant has been giving me trouble. A lot of trouble actually.” Tony puts his hands in his pockets. Maybe it is a subconscious thing or maybe he does it willingly, but it sure does symbolize how very frustrated he’s been with his inability to remedy the issue. If he could change it, if he could take away some of the side effects then he could change the world for himself and for other visually impaired people. “My neurosurgeon was none too happy when I asked him to place the implant. It’s a prototype and needs a lot of work.”
“It’s important we have you on our side, Captain. Many in the Corps are starting to question policy, regulations, and procedures because of you. The Corps looks up to you. The vast majority will follow your lead.”  Pierce opened his hands as if in invitation. “This initiative will change the shape of things. It will forge a stronger future. It will take the inequity out of the equation.”
“Sure, sure!” Tony waves him off and focuses on cleaning the dishes. He doesn’t think about what ‘work’ means to Steve, or at least he tries not to think about what work means. His mind is an endless wheel, chugging over and over with a cascade of thoughts to feed it.
“I had a friend as a kid. We would fool around when we were teens. Arnie knew he was homosexual. I was just – you know – experimenting. We never did anything more than touching and kissing a little. But it scared the shit out of me, so I stopped. Arnie.” Steve stops. “Well, he knew.” He doesn’t elaborate on Arnie’s fate, but Tony sees that it upsets him, feels it through the tension in his muscles.
“Please sit. We’ll go over the choices here,” she says and settles back in her chair. Steve sits down too, but on the edge of the cushion.
“We’re all here for you, Steve,” Tony said. He touched Steve’s arm and then slowly got him to release. Tony grasped Steve’s hand. “You are not alone. Remember that.”
But Tony cocks his eyebrow and smirks. “Protected me from the truth, that’s an interesting way to look at it.” He clasps his hands together, as if in prayer and Steve can see the fragile foundation already cracking. “You see, I could protect you from the truth right now. But instead I’m going to do the right thing. I’m going to tell you something and you’re not going to like it, but you’re going to have to deal with it. Are you ready?”
Tony laughs and releases Steve’s hand. “You just keep digging that hole, Steve.” His face turns red with his joy at his expense – which Steve knows he owes Tony.
“Yeah,” Tony said and invited himself to touch Steve.  Just thinking that the act of touch, the simple act of brushing his hand down Steve’s chest to the small of his waist could be so beautiful, send such thrilling sensations through him awed Tony. He wanted to leap on Steve, to kiss him everywhere, but he held back and let Steve guide them.
When the darkness of loneliness hits he denies it, because that's what Tony does the best, he finds ways to hide, to burrow down into his brain until there's no way out but up. Only then he will find relief, only then he will be free from the shadows of loneliness. He leaves alcohol behind this time, because it dims the brain, and he needs his brain. He needs to set it ablaze, a conflagration of flames, of ideas, of knowing more.
“Then let me hear about you, tell me something. Maybe about your mother?” That sounds like a safe subject.
Red popsicle plus Tony’s lips stretched over it sucking as he enjoys it, then sliding it out with an audible pop goes straight to Steve’s groin. This isn’t fair at all. Steve thinks about tossing his popsicle. Instead, he violently tears the wrapper off and sticks it in his mouth forcing it in and out of his mouth and glaring at Tony. The prince’s response is only to lick at his phallic popsicle and snicker at Steve.
Tony grasps Steve’s hand in both of his. “I know that feeling. I should have taken the keys from my dad. He was flat out too drunk to drive. But I let him. And look what happened. It’s my fault.”
Tony watched Steve’s hand, his long strong fingers as he painted the air. He imagined starlight at Steve’s fingertips, and he smiled into his chest. He could get used to it; he could fall in love with Steve. He forced himself to take a step back, knowing all too well that vulnerability was the last thing he needed.
“Comic books. I understand you’re a pretty good artist. I’ve seen some of your work. Why comic books?”
Steve sinks down onto the floor. His mind a whirlwind of images. Touching himself has been out of the question. Every time he’s tried just to relieve tension, it’s been a disaster. He watched his hand grasp his erection and it would be Peggy, over him, her hand stroking him. He would lose it then, end up a wreck. Not from a satisfying climax but a horrifying moment of pure self-hatred and guilt. But then there was this afternoon, when he ached to touch himself and think about Tony’s dusky hand against his pale skin, grasping him, holding him until he jerked to completion. Even now when he thought of it, his cock twitched and throbbed in his jeans. He closes his eyes, thinking of it. Remembering the images, he just saw.
He jerks and opens his eyes. “Pepper! I didn’t hear you come in.” She usually wears heels and that clickety clack gives her away every time. But today she is in tennis shoes and is actually wearing an outfit that matches. “Tennis?”
“And we are more careful with how we handle them,” Natasha said. “Listen, Tony, I don’t want you to be hurt. And I surely don’t want the coven to be harmed because he finds he needs to side with his own kind. It happens all the time. New vampires are always blindsided.”
“He was my father, yeah, and it isn’t New York anymore. When my father died, I moved the whole estate to California. It’s more my style.”
Why isn’t it flight, fight, or freeze? That’s what it should be, because right now he can’t move. Paralysis overtakes him.
Rumlow hits him again, this time at the small of the back. Steve cries out and tries to trip his opponent. It doesn’t work. Somehow, Rumlow gets his pants up and is screaming for help.
“Having someone, Steven, someone dear to you it’s important. Someone you can count on,” she said to him more than once.
Upon the thought of water, Steve hears the gentle rhythm of waves and wonders if he’s falling into the ocean again. He remembers doing that once, when he tried to reach Bucky and failed. “Bucky?”
“This might take a while. Have Pep get my urgency cabin on the Avenger ready. Just in case you’re right about my cycle.” He examines the food as he talks. There’s a few meat dishes, a meat pie which is an interesting choice, a platter of steamed vegetables. Some rolls and on the bottom shelf an assortment of wines. There’s also a small pitcher of water. That had to cost a pretty coin or two. In the drawer of the cart is the stunner. It’s small, will fit into the palm of his hand, slips on to his middle finger and clamps around his wrist. He puts it on his left hand. Insurance policy.
The cross was a Saint Andrew’s cross but so much more. It had a special chastity belt attached to it, so that the wearer had no leverage at all. The belt really held Steven’s cock in its erect position but with a tight binding at the root. The binding on the cross itself, the cuffs were comfortable enough, but the cross itself lent no soft spot to lean against. It was metal and rough. When Tony took Steven on the cross, he cried out and squeezed his eyes closed. When Tony pushed his fingers in alongside his knot, Steven sagged against the cross, moaning and begging. He wasn’t begging for reprieve but for more, for release, for Tony.
Steve shakes his head, but even that seems to throw him. He scratches at his face and then rubs his eyes, leaving his knuckles pressed into his eyes. “I don’t know. Nothing feels right. The clothes scratch, the food smells burnt, even the way I shake my head is wrong.”
Steve drops his arms. “I never forgot. Not in all the days I stayed alone on the Garden. I didn’t want to go with Carol when she brought me back. But I did because it was the right thing to do, I suppose.” He thinks about Sam and Bucky. All the people he disappointed. “You know it took them a helluva long time to find me.”
Once Tony is halfway up the rise, Steve gathers the cable that Tony let loose from his gauntlet and begins. He has a rope in his backpack, but urgency stops him from digging it out. He watches Tony’s footing, confirming his stable ascent.  He doesn’t want to disturb Tony’s progress, so he waits every few feet. The storm makes it impossible for them to speak for which Steve is thankful. Right now, he doesn’t want to hear the impossibility of their mission from Tony. Sometimes Tony knows too much.
“Activate it,” Estane commands once again and Steven falls when another shock crackles over his skin. Tony can smell the burnt flesh.
This does not dissuade Ross. “According to my sources, you did not spend your time with your bonded Alpha. As I mentioned this does lead to some ambiguity about your status.”
He laughs. It’s soft and dies quickly – joy withering on the vine. “Wonky is that the technical term?”
“Nanites?” Steve murmurs and then shakes his head. “No, no. That’s what happened before. That’s what you did before. That’s-.”
“It’s wonderful, Tony. Thank you so much. How’d you know I’d need it?” Steve carefully places the shield back on the clip and then presses the disc; the nanobots collect and then stow in the center of the disc.
Tony shook out his shoulders and then his arms. “I think we relax a little, get comfy, and then close our eyes.”
His body violently convulsed and he screamed through it. No sound escaped him. He juddered and arched. The scientists scattered as he rolled and pitched about the room. His body wasn’t his own, some supernatural force possessed it – the thing that made him a vampire in the first place. It seeded deep within his chest. It pulsed into the hollow of his ribcage and grasped what was left of his stone heart, worming its way into his core. He tore at his own chest, clawing at it as the agents whipped out their guns.
Clint picks up his bow. “We’re just doing some target practice. Wanna join in?”  Lila comes up with her own bow and quiver full of arrows.
“No.” Tony denies – but he doesn’t understand, not truly. Most of what Steve says makes no sense at all.
Tony laughs and then curls around the pain. “I’m sorry I couldn’t help you. It’s not going to get done, but the plans are on the table.”
“Thought the doctors weren’t allowing you out of the med floor,” Tony says and goes to the fridge. He opens it just to stare in it. The timer in his head tells him he has 4 more hours before the nanites are ready – all the validation testing will be completed.
Steve fumbles and the chains clank and shiver as the wings – the ragged wings – on his back move with him. They are fucking attached to his back, his bare back that’s been beaten, and scored with cattle prods. The torture didn’t end there – it’s so clearly obvious that Tony swallows back his fear, his astonishment. The wings have been gouged and burnt, they’ve been torn, and broken. The bones – he can see bones and he hisses in a strange kind of revulsion as a response – are fragmented and broken.
“Time to face the music.” He climbs the stairs and crosses over to Steve’s room. Knocking, he calls, “Steve? Steve, can I come in?”
“Like when we first entered, the construct of Clint kept having to be rebooted. It glitched a lot then. It hasn’t in a while, though some of the same dangers and challenges have been big on his list.” Steve closes his eyes. His head aches, the digital input information and how the serum enhances his senses tries his patience and his ability to stop the nausea and dizziness. Without opening his eyes, Steve comments, “Ultron has a limited repertoire.”
Clint toggles the steering column back and the whole ship rebels. The explosions rock and lurch the ship with such force that neither Bucky nor Sam can make it back to their feet. The hull whines in protest. The electronics spark and screech.
Leaving the elevator, he strides down the hallway toward his living quarters. He climbs a few stairs that are more for decoration that anything else. He slots his thumb into the reader and the door clicks open. Once he passes through the threshold, he exhales and slumps down in a seat not far from the entranceway. Sitting in the dark, he tries not to let the frozen silence penetrate into his senses, but with each day it becomes more of a battle.
“Drink the elixir. It will help you through the meeting,” Steven says and his words are tender, even inviting.
“Oh, nice to meet you.” Steve shakes hands with both Rhodey (who he learns is James) and Carol (who he learns is also in the Air Force). He eyes Tony, noticing that he’s not wearing his glasses.
“Sure, boss. The weather for your location shows a significant weather pattern and blizzard hanging around for another 36 hours at least. Wind gusts up to 80 miles per hour with sustain winds of 40 miles per hour expected. Roads are hazardous and local officials are banning any non-emergency travel.”
He might be able to get a cup over at Natasha’s saloon, if she’s open. But he should stop in and check on Darcy. He doesn’t though because he heard the place was rolling with parties and rowdy with Stark and his friends having a bit too much fun.  Even Bucky ended up at the party.
“It’s not really all that interesting,” Steve said, trying to brush it off. Natasha’s soul focused on information, curious and inquisitive. He’d learned that much about her – and more. Not only was she the soul pack’s Confidant, he had become hers in many ways. He was under no delusion that she revealed all her secrets. That just wasn’t like her. Steve often wondered if she had with Bruce, but that was none of his business.
He curses and puts the car in gear. On the way home, he tells himself he’s a fool. He needs to figure out what’s up and soon. Obi called him and told him the Board of Directors are looking for a big splash – they want the Jericho field tested in Afghanistan. Tony’s not getting out of that one. He’s going to have to go overseas and leave Steve alone.
He needed time to process. “I just need some time to process.” A deep ache filled him and he pressed the heels of his hands into his eyes. “Take care of him, okay?” Tony said as he dropped his hand. “I need to go.”
Jarvis peered into the box with the comic books and other cast offs from a childhood stolen. “I see you’re putting these away. Maybe someday your children will love them as much as you did.”
“It’s really no problem. I find it relaxing. Just drink your coffee. I know you’re not human until you get a gallon in you.”
The solid chains securing him to the ceiling and the floor shifted. Steve looked up but the single bulb blinded him from seeing what the nanotech was doing. The nanite bonds began to move, splaying out his arms and legs.
He hasn’t placed in the upgrade to JARVIS for monitoring of human data yet, so he turns to Steve and his heart sinks. Eyes closed, Steve lies boneless in his seat with blood dripping from his nose.
Steve wants to interrogate it on what that means but Tony plows ahead. “Go on, give us your best shot.”
Before he could recapture the words, before he could explain them, Steve gazed at Tony and his whole image in the dreamscape flickered then pixelated until it vanished into the red ocean around them. Steve dissipated – his soul gone.
“The day,” Tony begins. He clears his throat and tries again. “The day was a good day. Wouldn’t you say?”
“Captain Rogers, come over here,” Tony directed but he stayed firmly in place, close to Rumlow. Maybe he couldn’t tell exactly where Tony was considering the fucking metal alloy mask over his face. “Can you get that thing off of him?”
“Here.” Frigga stands outside the archway. “This place is only for the two of you. No one will see you here. Here you must decide how entangled you may be. How your lives revolve around one another. How your deaths revolve around one another. How the passage beyond this realm will change and mold to your entanglement.”
The one that Tony assumes in the local leader inches out of his doorway. He’s wearing a scarf on his head and long robes, but Tony can spot military boots under the hem of his robe. The man’s eyes are squinting, and wrinkles mark his face, though Tony thinks he’s younger than he looks, probably around Tony’s age or a little older. He’s had a hard life.
Some of the agents looked everywhere but at the tormented figure hanging in the center of the room. Others gazed at Steve as if they were bored with the whole proceeding. Ross studied him, checking, as if to mark off the wounds to ensure they were deep enough, bad enough, painful enough. “Dear doctors, I love that you’ve essentially mimicked lightning strikes. Look at the patterns.”
“So, it’s a virus? Isn’t that dangerous?” Steve can’t help himself. He needs to understand, part of his job is to be there for Tony, support him and his work.
Tony stood in front of him, just inches away. “Let me show you. Let me just hold you for a second. For a breath.” Tony shook, quaked as he waited for Steve to answer. His fear struck the room into another silence.
“So each one of you and your missing members have an assignment, a designation as it were,” Strange said. “That designation not only works for the interaction with the leader of the pack but also with others. Except of course for the Beloved. That designation seals completely around the leader.”
“It is generally believed that the 44th president and his wife were Beloved.  From evidence, it is clear that the FLOTUS was the leader and the president the Beloved. The pack members also included the vice president at the time, a well-known talk show host, and an actress. Other members are not known.”
“I’m not discussing this with you,” Tony says. “You wouldn’t understand it.” He gets up and heads toward the Conference building. He doesn’t want to see the look on her face anymore.
It isn’t Steve who answers – he can’t supply an answer anyhow. But Tony steps back into the room and says, “I might have the answer to that one. It’s a Collapsing Event, do you know what that means?”
“There are times I need my Submissive to be at my beck and call even out of a scene. Are you prepared for that; I wonder?” Tony leaned over and kissed Steve’s cheek, his eyelids and then he nudged a little at his mouth. “I wonder if you really want to be my Submissive. How much would you give over to me.” His words were a breathy whisper. “How much would you surrender?”
Steve sticks on the word ‘over’ in his head. Before he knows what he’s doing, he runs off at the mouth, “If this works is my job over? Like am I out of a job?” He can make it on what Tony’s paid him for probably nearly a year if he’s prudent. He can get more work, maybe sell the Iron Man comic to Thor and Jane. It’s possible.
Steve stays next to the buffet table but then a clutch of busy bodies arrive and swarm around him, asking probing questions until one finally asks, “Are you the newest flavor of the month?” He barely shakes his head when another one chimes in to comment, “Prince Anthony is the most eligible bachelor, everyone is trying to land him.”
“Just keep touching,” Steve says and he’s drifting on the pleasure of Tony’s hands against his feathers, his flight feathers. It’s a thrill that drives him, increases his sense of Tony.
“No, what you said in the recording? How I don’t see you and you want me to see you?” Tony asks. He plays with his cloth napkin. Maybe he doesn’t want to broach the subject so intimately, so he steers it in another direction. “Is it the way rich people treat all servants? Is that how I act?”
Raza glares at Tony. He speaks a long dialogue that Tony only shakes his head and looks at Steve who still seems out of it – as if he was actually somewhere else and not sleeping. He struggles to wake, to rise to awareness. Raza hits Steve in the head, repeats what he said and then waits for Steve to interpret.
“Tell me you didn’t have fun?” Steve laughs as he tugs off his helmet. His hair is in disarray and there’s sweat along his brow. He yanks off his jacket, and Tony sees the sweat running down his back as he places it on the bike’s seat.
Clint licks at his lips and the ship jitters. There’s not much of the ship that will withstand more of the attack. If they want to get out of here, they have to save the ship. “Okay, okay. Get back there, I’m coming in low and hot. I’m dropping you and you better hope the Force is with you because you’re gonna need it.”
“Alpha? You need an alpha?” Fury squinted at him as if trying to focus on some obscure detail. “Captain America is an omega?” That’s when Steve thought his functional eye would pop out of his head.
He hated Howard then, but he clung to hope. Now, as he looks at the lion chained in the corner, all hope withers away. Tony shivers because even in the desert it’s cold, especially in a prison. His doctor, Yinsen, who saved his life is puttering around in what Tony can only call a makeshift kitchen. He’s boiling something their captors gave him. That’s the order of the day. Boiled whatever. Maybe it’s boiled shoe leather. He remembers that sometimes during the Great Depression people were desperate for food. Were they that desperate? He’s not desperate. He has no appetite.
“Why do you follow me? Why? You’re doing it because of your damned nature. Because that gland forces you. You are linked to me because of biology, not because of anything else.” Tony fists his hands as the rising tide of his alpha fury rears up, crashing into him, battering him. “You’re nothing else but your biology and you question my superiority, my rightful place.”
“Some, not a lot. We carry an eclectic line of books, stuff not found in the popular stores or websites,” Steve answers. “Can I get you anything else?” He glances around looking for an escape. He shouldn’t flirt with the customers, Natasha will brain him if he does.
“What about me?” Tony wanted to ignore the question and ask Bruce about Sam, but he tried to cool his jets, forced the panic down.
“Well, it’s good those German classes didn’t go to waste. But here,” he said and flipped the pages. “Here is his own code or something. I can’t make heads or tails of it. Something about integration. I have no idea what it means.”
Tony feigns Steve mouthing at him but dutifully eats his sub with gusto and drinks the water. After Steve finishes eating, he cleans up the kitchen and Tony devours the blueberries. He dusts his hands off and says, “I didn’t know I was that hungry, but now can we go?”
“Jesus,” Tony said and clutched Steve’s hand. “Do you need me to carry you?” He wiped the blood tears away, smearing them across his cheeks.
Against the motion of the crazed train, Steve forced his way over to Clint who lie in the middle of the aisle. Steve touched his neck, finding a strong pulse, but he was out. People throughout the car started to try and stand, to find out what was happening. Steve managed to stand up and in his best Captain America voice said, “Sit, strap in, and stay safe!” The train pitched again, throwing him across the car. He smacked up against the window, hitting his head against the opposite chair. The whole of the train trembled, shaking as if undergoing a seizure, and then stopped dead. It took all of thirty seconds for the train derailment to occur.
He spent a few days sitting wretchedly in his attic apartment, hoping that Tony would call. But all he received was a text message warning him not to go against the NDA. With that text, it closed the door. Steve spent the next day laying on the fire escape staring into the sky waiting for – what he didn’t know. His life circled down the drain and he could have allowed it. He could have mourned the loss of all his comic sketches and his work, but he resolved to redefine himself. He gave up his lease and packed away his stuff. The moving truck would come and take everything to his storage unit. After he stored it all away – Steve intended to ride. Ride away. Who knew where? He didn’t care anymore. He had enough in his bank account, thanks to Tony, to just live for a while free of every encumberment.
“Shit!” Tony hears and then realizes it’s him. He rushes over to Steve with both Bruce and Logan on his tail. The pad and pen are forgotten on the floor and Steve is panting in anguished breaths. He’s dripping with sweat but when Tony touches him, he feels cold, clammy. “Steve. Steve! You’re here. You’re with us.”
in the distance. It shouldn’t have been a debilitating stab wound, but the blood leaked out like water – so thin and red. He crumpled to the pavement and his vision funneled to black as he lost consciousness…
Before Tony can say anything else, Steve falls off into a fitful sleep. Tony moves off and sits as the workbench, trying to rectify what he saw. But it doesn’t collide together right, it only smashes up all his ideas of reality. At one point, when he glances over at Steve he hears him talking.
It isn’t as if Bucky judged Steve, but he has always wanted to protect him. The West permits certain behaviors. The trail is long and hard for cowboys and steering cattle to their ultimate destination happens to be lonely work that lasts long weeks. Never surprises anyone when a friend lends a hand out in the open country of the range. But get close in toward civilization and the conventions of the society creep back into life.
He glared at Natasha, but she never flinched. She might look like a twenty something, but word was she aged well and might have been a Russian spy during World War ll. He’d have to ask around about that someday. He heaved his ass off the couch and rubbed at his eyes again. Shuffling over to the fridge he pulled open the door to stare at the pints of blood. How much he wished it was human blood. He peered at Natasha for a long minute. He bet she never lowered herself to animal blood. How many human mates had she had in her day? He knew her current mate. The fact that her mate and his mate happened to be work partners was a happy coincidence – he thought.
Tony spends the rest of the day working on the armor, especially the HUD. By mid-day the heat and the pounding sun gives him a headache and he’s getting more desperate for some water. He surveys the rocky hills to his left. Going up there and hiding the armor seems like the best bet. If he does that, then he can spend some time searching for a water source. Once he finds it, he can circle back, get the armor and camp closer to the water. Seems like a good plan to him, but the truth is – Tony’s not a survivalist. He has no idea what the hell he’s doing.
“I could punish you for that,” Tony mutters, but he’s not looking at Steven. These words are part of his internal dialog, spoken out and revealed.
“Your souls,” Natasha said and slung the backpack on her shoulders. “Hurry up. You’re burning daylight.”
Rushing to him, Tony bent over Steve and cradled him in his arms. “Don’t do this to me Steve. Don’t leave me.” Steve’s eyes opened, and he smiled. He tried to lift his hand to touch Tony, but his strength failed him. Tony searched his battered face, his broken body. “No, no. You can’t leave me. Not now.” As he looked over Steve, Tony’s new vision saw everything, all the pain and agony bestowed upon Steve by these madmen. What good did it do to
Bucky starts back down the hall, the prisoners in the cells hoot and scream at him. Redwing flies in front and swoops back and forth. The bird keeps an eye out for any threats. As soon as Bucky gets to the corner with his precious bundle the bird sweeps back in and whistles. Bucky’s heard the whistles, chirps, and caws a thousand times and can interpret them – maybe not as well or as fast as Sam can – but still he knows what the basic communication is. With Steve in a bridal carry, Bucky marches forward and tries to hurry his steps. They are on the lowest level and he’s certain he saw a garbage shoot and a sewer outlet to the outside of the fortress not far from the prison block in the schematics. Redwing keeps crisscrossing and flying back and forth to scan the area for risks and threats. They make it a few meters, stop and wait as Redwing checks again. His bundle stays silent in his arms and Bucky wonders how very weak Steve is. How will he ever recover?
“Yeah, he was here,” Tony says and his eyes go distant. “They put a bullet in his head because I wouldn’t build them the bombs they wanted. I suppose they’re going to do the same to you if I don’t do what they want.”
No. He wants to say no, he wants to pledge that. He wants the High Alpha Chair to change things, but still he’s wrapped up in the caste living, in his biology even now. He’s fallen back into what he was taught to do. He keeps thinking that the basics of it is right. Biology tells him that as alpha he is superior. He’s taken on the ways of the alpha, on the culture. It’s been years since he lived free of it. He can’t say he doesn’t like the benefits of being an alpha with a family name and a Prime at that. Even his status of dom puts him a step ahead of everyone. The power, the potential – it’s heady like a drug. He needs that – his body is addicted to the hit. It gives him the sense of freedom and power that taking a hit did, or a drink, or a good fuck. But he wants to do good with it. And then he looks at the drop of blood on his fingertip.
After Sam not all the clients live up to his level of caring or even interaction. Some walk in the door and get him to his knees and a dick in his mouth before he can even offer a greeting. Others talk far too much and fuck him like he’s a dog in heat. Still others never get it up and just hold Steve and play with his cock until he’s coming, and they watch in some fascination.
Again the tie-fighters target him and he only just clears another bolt as he gets up the ladder. Finally, the ladder starts to automatically retract, dragging him into the ship and to safety. Above him he sees Sam kneeling at the hatch and he hauls Bucky clear before slamming his palm on the switch to close it. Sam yells, “Get us out of here!”
He covers Bucky with the quilt and stays by his side for moments longer to ensure that he will not wake. When he's convinced that his friend is truly asleep, he leaves the room to go down to the main office of the jailhouse. Everyone is there, milling about, but Tony and his friend Happy. Steve doesn't spot Tony anywhere.
She smiled, a weak and painful cut of her lips. “I think I understand a little about uncontrolled power.” She lifted her hands and brought them to Bruce’s temples. “Relax.”
“Yes. Thank you,” Steve says and opens his eyes. There’s a smile creeping on his face. “And thank you for what you did back there. I always hated hospitals. When I was a boy it was always because it meant I was sick. Now it means that I’m a specimen. Half of me wants to be a lion again, so they ignore me.”
Purposefully, Steve kept his focus on Wong and Strange. He didn’t want to see the dark shadows over Tony’s features. “And the twins have a similar situation?”
Fighting enemies is one thing, fighting friends – impossible. The image of Clint going down, his head rolling free of his body replays in Steve’s head. He shoves the pain away, accepts the guilt, and yells to Tony, “Let me go.”
“Tony, what now? What’s wrong?” A stricken expression etches her face, furrowing her brow and pinching her nose.
Tony bites the sandwich roll, chews, and then says, “It’s a beautiful day. Thank you, Steve, for making me see that.”
“It’s going to take a few hours to get the download to the implant updated over wireless so I do it while I sleep.”
He rubs a hand down his face. Of course, he left his suitcase downstairs. He deflates onto the queen sized bed and slumps there. He doesn’t search around, look at what’s offered in the room. He doesn’t give a shit. This is all Natasha’s fault.
Sam blinked a few times and surveyed the strange medical bay again. Steve sympathized with his confusion. When he woke up in Wakanda he’d thought he somehow ended up in the distant future – again.
“Why don’t you go back to the ship? I’ll contact you soon,” Tony says. He leaves, not giving her a chance to refuse him. He doesn’t want her to follow. He doesn’t need her to follow. He wants to settle back into his rightful nature. Something he regularly denies. It will be a release to allow himself to be – to be a prime, to be a dom, to be an alpha. He hits the lift touchpad and the elevator car appears. With a short wave to Pep, he gets in and the elevator descends at his command.
Tony watched Thor leave, the lightheartedness of his story lost to distance. His mind juddered like a boat without mooring, hitting the dock and then being lost to the ocean. He knew he should query about Steve again, find out what was happening, but his mind failed him. He couldn’t anchor, no matter what he did. Clint stepped closer as Natasha reached out to Tony.
“Well, he did. But the fact remains that most of the physicians and nurses on call wouldn’t have a lot to do most of the time, so he employs only physician scientists and research nurses. That way they do a ton of research interrupted by actual medical duties when needed,” she said. They walked past multiple laboratories. Steve couldn’t identify half of the equipment in the rooms or on the lab benches. Along the way she pointed out state of the art medical instruments from heart monitors to MRI. “An open MRI – much easier to stand.”
As much as Steve needed to evaluate where these men stood, they were doing the same to him. He had to choose his words carefully. “Well, sirs, it might sound old fashion, but I like to be able to judge people on their own merits and not on rumor and innuendo.”
“Do you need funding or something?” Tony asked. Going to a lunch or dinner to find out the new Avengers team needed a benefactor – no, he refused to do it.
“Are you sure about that?” Steve narrows his eyes and tilts his head as if he teasing apart a puzzle. “What about if I’m about to fall into some subversive culture. What if I’m about to eat up all those conspiracy theories out there?”
The urge to leave, to roam, to go and find something  - someone heightened with every passing day. “New York. I need to touch base with the pack. Then I have to find out where I’m going to land.”
“Hmm,” Steve says. He’s not sure how to add up all the information. “So who put me on suicide watch?”
When he speaks, Steve realizes he’s still conversing through his implant. “We have a problem with the pod. If we don’t give it enough juice, then the catalyst isn’t going to work. Tell the good doctor he shouldn’t try it on the subject. Okay? Yes. I’ll talk to Obie a bit later. Thanks. Yes?” Tony nods a thanks to Steve as he offers him the mug of coffee. “No everything is fine. Yes. He’s right here with me. All good. Still Pep I want to see Rumlow pay. He doesn’t do that to one of my crew-.” He stops and grimaces. “Yes, my dear Duchess, I realize that. Okay. Talk to you at the meeting.”
“That’s just it. Since we went on that ride and he nearly slipped off the dock, he’s not stopped,” Steve says. It hasn’t been that long, perhaps Steve is over reacting.
“Maybe after the Council meeting, we could come back here. Forget about everything else, everyone else. Just us,” Steve said. His large hand never left Tony’s cheek as he gazed into Tony’s eyes, not shying away from his alienness. “I want to be with you, Tony.”
Jogging through the underbrush, they make it to the ridge line in no time. The rocky slope to the base should be easy enough to traverse except it's exposed. Bucky looks to Sam.
“Tell me what this means?” Tony finally said as they both hunched over the table in the booth. The red and orange colors of the café irritated his already fried brain. Lamps that looked like rejects from the 1970s hung over each table. Fake red leather cushions lined the benches of the booth. He gagged a little at the bright orange color of the Formica table top. He had an orange Audi that didn’t puke the color as badly.
“Bucky, let them help you with the pain,” Steve says but his friend clenches as his collar with a severe expression.
Steve does not let them stop to find out. At first he directs them to his motorcycle, but Tony stops him and forces him toward the Audi. He scrambles toward it, but as Tony jiggles the keys trying to get the locks open with the fob, Steve whips around as if he might go back into the factory.
Tony presses a finger on his lips. “It’s just a little thing.” Steve rolls his eyes. He tries to change the subject. “She loves the new book, you know. Best seller. The kids are going wild over it.”
“Heaven forbid, I do not.” He smiles and that’s the best part of the day. Tony always smiles at Steve in the morning. Always. Even if they’ve fought the night before – he smiles at Steve. Once a while ago, Steve had asked why and Tony simply said that as a scientist he understood what the north magnetic pole was, but when he hears Steve’s voice in the morning, he knows what true north really is. “You’re still thinking too loud.”
“You should always wear mock turtlenecks. You look like a professor or an artist. I’d say an artist. Very Bohemian.”
That was an awful lot of information and Tony’s sure if his brain was firing on all cylinders that he would be able to process it. As it is now, he’s barely able to figure out his own last name, or where exactly the voice is coming from. He zeroes in on the voice, lifting his eyes to find the figure kneeling next to the bed. The bleary face said something about water. “Water?”
“I don’t know. You should?” Tony shrugs. “We’re not changing your brain. We’re only going to cut you off from him so the seizures and infiltrating shared lives will be stopped.”
A large man with a thick beard, balding head, and a paunch for a belly turns to Tony and opens his arms wide. “My boy!” He grasps Tony in a familial hug, then releases him. “I could never leave when we are on the precipice. This is going to be a historic conference on the war. I’m telling you, my prince, you are set for great things!”
“Yeah, sandwiches are fine,” Steve said, and Clint agreed. Steve busied himself with helping Sam, though he figured he was more of a hindrance. Clint drifted toward the living room. The television blared updates about Captain America and the sin of mating a vampire. Steve cringed the news. “It wasn’t supposed to be like this, you know.”
At that point, something broke inside of Tony and he accepted what would happen. Tony let go of Bucky completely. The lights of the city glittered in the darkness and the world tilted upside down from his vantage point. But he had no choice, no way out. Somehow Tony found a sharp, lose shard of glass. Managing to grab the glass dagger Tony screamed and, with a strength he didn't know he had, cracked it off and drove it into Bucky's chest right below his right collar bone. Bucky had gasped and staggered back, immediately releasing Tony.
“Okay, I get it, I get it,” Tony said but his expression looked glorious and his smile beamed in the moonlight. “I hope you know you’re, you’re important to me outside of this whole soul pack thing. I mean, it might have taken longer to get here but I have to believe.”
Tony had settled on the large chaise lounge as Steven sat at his feet. It was a large enough chair for the both of them and after Steven finished pouring the wine and placing in on a table next to the lounge chair, Tony asked, “Do you mind lying beside me?”
“Get him out and hide him,” Tony mutters and suddenly, everything clarifies. He knows exactly what he needs to do. He crosses the small divide between them and cradles Steve in his arms. He gently tugs Steve’s arms into position and then, with the repulsor, fires at the chains and frees him. He does the same for his ankles.
Tony bops his head as he picks through the salad. “Kind of. Dad had a palace on York-1, but I never liked it there. It was high up on the hill, no one else actually lived on the planet. It was like his little playground. Yet it had no one else around. My mother was terribly lonely there. She eventually had a new place built – this one – on Carbonelli. That’s the name of the planet. Also happened to be in her family’s name. I liked it here. More people around, less drunks.”
Happy is not the word Steve would use when Tony decides the best plan of action is just to march down to the farm and say hello. As Steve warned him, this isn’t like playing house. Ultron is using the information on Barton – however he found it – to lure them in for some specific purpose.
“That’s what sighted people say when they don’t have anything else to offer,” Tony responds and then adds, “Do you know where Steve is? My personal assistant? Pepper said he left.”
Glancing over his shoulder, Tony sees Steve hanging on the doorframe. He quakes and looks like he’s about to topple over onto the disgustingly dirty floor that Tony just has his cheek pressed to. “I’m trying to get the deaf guy to answer the door. How do you get him-.”
“That’s not the point,” Natasha said and Tony swore to hell and back he saw red vibrate around her like a halo. That on top of the other noise in his head rammed the headache starting at the base of his skull to full intensity.
“Well, let me clean up,” Steve says. As he starts to close up their nearly untouched lunch, he adds, “I will leave if you want me to Tony. You don’t have to-.”
Tony turned his focus to the large picturesque windows where he could see the city and how it seemed to go on forever. “Yeah. I hoped it was just that stupid boyhood crush, but it isn’t. There’s a genuineness about Steve that it’s hard to find these days. We might not have shared life experiences, but we do- we do. In some convoluted way we do.”
“Well, this is the last shot you have,” Pep says and they walk through the double doors to the main corridor.  His guards are not permitted entrance into the main complex of the building for security reasons. He thinks it is a load of shit, but he’s not running the land of Nod– it’s the law.
“I called you Steve, because that’s your name.” The Red Knight yanks off his helmet. A face so familiar greets the Silver Knight. “It’s a shock, I know.”
He wipes his hands on his pants and then grabs the door knob. Going in feels more monumental than getting into the pods for Project Rebirth. Summoning his courage he goes through and follows her down a hallway that’s nicely appointed with paintings that are anything but erotic. She shows him to a room with a stain glass window with a light behind it that shows off the mosaic colors. It has two cushioned wing chairs with a table between them.
Well, that is actually more information then Steve actually needs, but still he says, “Thanks, Friday.” He checks his watch and agrees with the lady in the ceiling. He needs to hustle to get changed and ready for the appointment.
Tony launches himself at Blu. With those broad shoulders and strong arms, the man catches him, lifts him easily off his feet, and spins him around. If there was ever a time, Tony felt like a Disney Princess it is now. He nestles his head against Blu’s neck they stand in embrace.
He won’t force Pep to do something that’s foreign to her nature. It is his requirement as the Lord, as the leader of his Family and Clan. It is his responsibility to go to the Council with a powerful omega at his side to defend his name and his claim. They interview another candidate but unfortunately the man is not a sub-omega and since Tony is not interested in taming a dom- Omega in the short amount of time he has left before the Council, he needs to take that into consideration as well.
Steve laid next to him on the couch. They’d snuggled after eating pizza and drinking too much beer. Steve somehow managed to get his body notched into the back of the couch, Tony rested on top of him. He listened to Steve’s heart. They hadn’t been physical but somehow this felt more intimate to Tony than anything he’d ever done before with anyone else.
There’s no words he can say to convince Tony otherwise. He climbs up and holds Tony in his arms and whispers in his ears, “I believe in you, Tony. I’m here for you. Let’s promise to believe one another.”
“It’s too bad the rest of the team couldn’t make it,” Tony remarks, not wanting to fall into the dreaded awkward silence.
Waking, arms encompass him, and his face is planted against a strong chest; he’s listening to a steady heartbeat. He snuggles close, thinking for a moment of Blu but that fades, and he realizes he’s in Steve’s arms. Tony gently moves away, lifting Steve’s arm to free himself, but he manages to wake him.
“Seventeen minutes less than yesterday. It’s getting worse.” He doesn’t want to face reality of what’s happening, what has been happening since that fateful day his drunk father got in a head on collusion with his mother and himself in the car. He should have taken the keys away from him, he should have yanked his mother out of the car and not gone with his father. He should have called a cab. But he didn’t and here he is facing the consequences every damned day.
“I think that’s already apparent,” Tony says and his hand stretches out to run fingers through the tips of Steve’s wing feathers. Steve inhales in sharp pants and his mind blanks at the touch. Tony stops when he witnesses the effect the action has on Steve. “Tell me, what consequences.”
“That you weren’t entirely human,” she said and then winked at him. She squeezed his hands. “I’m Shuri, by the way. And you’re Captain America. Glad to have you here. Glad I could help.”
At that moment, he loved Tony. Loved him to a distraction. Every fiber of his being ached for Tony, wanted him. They’d learned early on that they had to pace themselves. They couldn’t be like new human couples. “Fornication is not validation,” Clint had joked to them.
Grabbing the plate, Steve watches, fascinated by the dexterity and confidence Tony shows as he works to help clean up the kitchen and breakfast dishes. “Well, you do a good job even without the glasses. I’m not surprised you could fool someone.”
“You need to call for a truce. You need to offer him a token to show you mean it. Once he accepts the token, then you can negotiate a peace. With that, you can assure everyone that has been enlightened can leave the Soul Realm to go on to the next step – whatever that is.” Steve’s leaning against the side of the hearth. He portrays a casual stance as if what he’s talking about isn’t pure hell.
It promised and offered. When Tony shifted to move away, Steve grasped Tony to him, not letting him go, prolonging the kiss so that he could taste this new thing, the transformation of who they were together. Each of them had changed in their individual way, and their pairing evolved as well. The very energy streaming between them became a thing itself – an entity of life pulsing between them. Just moments ago, Steve had given up hope, had dissolved the relationship in his head. He’d almost toppled and fell, crushed by the profundity of their potential, what they could be, what they had become. Love did that – scared and terrified. It wasn’t a happily ever after. Happiness and love weren’t romantic comedies or fairy tales. Instead it was this thing – an almost a living being that had the weight life. It lived between them and in them.
“Well, join the club,” Clint says. “Can you get to the plateau above the river bank? I can’t set down but I could throw you a line.”
Steve’s question brought Tony out of his reverie. He turned from the mirror and smiled, it felt crooked as if it bent under so much pressure. “Aren’t you?” He pulled the tie from his neck. “I still think it’s too soon. We can’t do this. There aren’t enough of us.”
Steve figures there’s nothing to lose so he pulls a chair over and sits down. “It’s nice to meet you, Tony and Morgan.”
“What’s that?” Pepper asks and she leans over the desk to reach the document. Steve slides it over to her and points out the issue with the pen tip. She reads and then glances Tony’s way. “Hmm. I think it would be your family. Mister Stark doesn’t have immediate family anymore.”
“Bucky, don’t be crude,” Steve says and yanks his arm away. Generally, he puts up with a lot from Bucky, and not because of his disability.
“In an old Soviet missile silo as far as I can tell,” Tony says. “Once I got you out of the maze and into the Passage, then we dropped out in the middle of more fucking snow. I found this place and hacked my way in.”
He repeated the phrase in his head several times as he purposefully breathed in through his nose and out through his mouth in slow, easy breaths. He’d come to love the Mantra because it not only worked to ease the tension of so many minds and feelings barraging him daily, but it calmed the hell of being so displaced, so isolated from home.
"Sure," Steve replies but he doesn't sound so convinced. He finds some voice, but he struggles to form the words, the thoughts. "I thought, I thought we were just, meeting for a drink. In the saloon."
“I’m only with you, Tony. Only you.” Steve takes his mouth again and consumes it, plunging into the kiss, hoping that the action will speak clearer and louder than his pathetic words.
zings through his brain like an electric shock. He squeezes his eyes closed and tells himself to remember this feeling. He needs to translate stuff like this into his comic book. He’s great at art, but not so much at writing.
“My mother called me Steven. My friends called me Stevie. I was called by some as Rogers. But mostly I was known as Captain America.”
“This is a hospital room. Take your testosterone laden fight outside.” Bruce shook his head. “This man needs rest. The serum won’t work well if he doesn’t get it.”
“Really?” Any minute now he’s going to say golly gee and Tony’s going to go all soft and gooey inside.
A reverberation from Thor answered the call. “The Legion awaits near the outer meadow. Several have approached the water’s edge.”
“And it has to be you,” Tony said with resignation. He understood where Steve was coming from even if he couldn’t find his way over to common ground. “We could look for a neutral party. Someone who could help? Maybe even Bruce would be amenable to helping too, since he’s Healer.”
Fury cut in before Strange could ask, “It seems that Captain Rogers added another person to his pack today. Agent Romanoff will be taking the training as well.” His one eye stayed fixed on them, the glower speaking volumes. “We will be focusing on Rogers and Romanoff right now. We has another member of the pack in New York-.”
This is a story I started that I really want to expand on. I thought of how it would be if Steve had been found much earlier and if Hydra had essentially taken over SHIELD, etc. Howard being part of the shady dealings. It is very dark. Here the story shows Tony 'inheriting' his father's life work. This was going to be a story of Steve's recovery and also a slow burn to Steve/Tony. Since I am stepping away from the Stony fandom I thought I would post it here for you to enjoy. It isn't beta edited or fixed - very much in draft form.
“I know, I know, we’ll find Thor’s brother, don’t worry,” Tony says as his fingers probe the joint. He’s not taking Steve’s shirt or coat off. He slips his hand under the coat and gets a feeling for how the joint is separated. “Once we find Loki – it’s only a matter of time to get your friend better.”
Steve frowns. It’s probably a way for Ultron to distract them from the rim. Ultron leading them to the Hub sounds dubious at best, and malevolent at worst.
“Can you two leave us for a minute?” Natasha asks. Both Sam and Cho share looks and then silently decide to follow her request.
She only rolls her eyes as she pushes forward, the low bodice of her dress presses against his chest.  When he dragged himself into the saloon after his showdown with Schmidt, he'd interrupted the mid-afternoon gaiety hosted by the saloon owner, the one and only Natasha Romanoff.  Much to her credit, Natasha spotted him and halted the party, rushing to seize him, calling to Clint, and helping Steve before he collapsed from the blood loss.  This isn’t the first time Steve’s come to Natasha for help after a run in with the town bully, Johann Schmidt. It probably won’t be the last – in fact, Steve knows it won’t be the last. They’ve only just begun the showdown and he doesn’t intend for someone like Schmidt to take control of the town’s resources without a fight.
The air catches in his throat. He places his gauntleted hand on his chest. “Really? Blu? You’re Blu? You’re my Blu?”
“Let’s get back. You can make some of your famous hot chocolate!” Tony declares and climbs to his feet. His foot catches on the edge of the deck and twists. In seconds, he teeters and slips toward the water. A hand catches him and hauls him up and away from oblivion and the frigid waters of the Labrador Sea. Steve wraps his arms around Tony, steadying him on the dock. The length of his body presses up against Steve, chest, abdomen, pelvis, legs.
Blu sits a distance off, licking himself dry as Tony prepares the fish and then starts a fire with the branches that he finds around their little camp. There’s not nearly enough fish for both of them, but Tony splits the fish into two portions and gives the larger one to the lion. He eats it happily and, with his large tongue, licks his lips. He paws Tony, being careful to keep his claws retracted.
“So,” Steve began again. He played with the tea bag, watching it bob up and down in the mug. “So, I- I often dream of the war. Both then and now. It is, or was impossible to escape. Only been awake for a little while. But I dream of it-.”
Tony tugs off his t-shirt and tosses it on the chair. He knows his way around his suite of rooms without Steve’s help. Steve shies away from looking at Tony, from studying the contours of his muscular though lithe figure. He shouldn’t have the thoughts popping into his brain about his boss. He shouldn’t allow himself to fantasize about touching his biceps, his pectorals, down to the hint of hair below his belly button.
“And it hardened you against the equality of the castes?” Steven says and for a moment Tony thinks he’s not truly asking – he’s stating facts.
“I think she did. She told me and I quote, ‘this one isn’t going to hold back telling you what he thinks. He’s got a mouth on him and I’m not talking about a good blow.’”
Bucky blinked rapidly and then pursed his lips. “Yeah. Me too.” He left Tony then, his demeanor diminished, and Tony couldn’t help but see how he attempted to remake himself even with only one arm. The man simply wanted to be small like Steve had been – non-threatening and hidden away from prying eyes. The heat of shame warmed Tony and he almost went after him but Strange called him back.
Steve put his hand up. “I’m sorry, Doctor Strange.” He paused to glance at Tony who wasn’t pleased at Steve’s handling of the sorcerer. “But it is important for us to figure out why these twins were named to be part of our pack.”
“But you will judge.” They’ve been friends for too long for Jamison to just leave it at that – they’ve known each other since before Tony’s wild days.
“Hey big guy, we did it. The job’s finished. Now I need you to turn this bird around, okay? We can’t track you in stealth mode. So help me out, I need you-.”
In the back of his perceptions, he hears a creak like the door’s closing and then the click of the lock being drawn in place. He stumbles to a stop, and Tony searches his face, shakes his head, his lips are bruised and swollen. “No, you don’t.” Tony warns him and drags him closer again.
She listens and fevered memories of Steve working on his chest, trying to implant the arc reactor for the first time come unbidden to him. He starts to wonder if everything about Steve had been a twisted memory.
Steve clears his throat and turns back to the bacon. “I think you should consider that a relationship shouldn’t be about changing who you are.”
“Feels rough like it hasn’t been used in a long time,” Tony says. “You must have just taken it out of storage or something.”
Often, a faraway look crossed over Steve’s features and seconds later he would excuse himself and disappear. Later Tony would find him staring blankly out into the middle distance. None of it made sense until now. Logan had said Steve was suffering from seizures. Tony missed it. How the fuck did he miss it?
“Well, it’s good to have another soul on board to help out.” Obie grabs his hand and tries to crush it, but Steve refuses to back down and tightens his hands. He lived in the Beyonds for fuck’s sake. He worked brutal hours and in severe conditions. “Oh, you have a live one here.” Obie smiles at Tony. “You better eat him up before I do, my boy.” The large man winks at Tony. “Now how about I steal Tony away and introduce him to Vision. You know he’s very supportive of your cause.”
“It’s all good, Tony.” Pepper smiles. “The Board is flying high because the stock is soaring. Your recent advance in digitalized interface compliance for medical imaging is showing real promise.”
After a long pause, Steve adds, “Don’t have any family, but I thought I wanted to protect people, take care of people. It seemed like the right thing to do.”
“Don’t tell Wanda, but I hate pink lemonade. It’s like battery acid only worse because it’s supposed to be tasty.” He gags a little but sips at the glass anyhow. It does taste terrible.
“You don’t, you don’t have to,” Steve whispers. His voice sounds edged, like he teeters on a precipice of want, desire, hope, and something else, something wanting and hungry.
“SHIELD has been studying the vital statistics of it for a while. SHIELD scientists started to investigate the existence outside of the myths and theories. Soul packs are even rarer than simple soul bonds,” Fury said.
“Tony,” Steve said – his tone more like Captain America than he intended.  He wasn’t going to hesitate. He plunged right to the point. “Are you having dreams about me in a 1940s setting?”
For a long time after Steve left Tony laid on the bed and stared at the cracks in the planks. The sun and the day leaked inside. It hurt his retinas and it ate away at his strength to be in the light. It didn’t set him on fire, not like the Blight. Hours exposure to the sun could flay and melt the skin from him, the weaker his biology, the less his flesh stayed together. As undead his ‘life’ depended on certain sacrifices. His flesh was too fragile to take the light of the sun. These small dribbles of sun light were a cruel reminder of what he couldn’t have anymore. Though the night through his preternatural eyes and ears transformed into what could only be described as a fairy tale land where everything glowed and shined with a life force.
She said that to taunt him, Tony was sure.  Too could play at her game and he cast his play. “Carter?” Tony guffawed. “She’s got to be a hundred.”
“What can I say other than I have no idea. Please we’re going to be late and the cab is waiting.” Strange taps on his wrist where a watch would be if he wore one.
Steve nearly gasps but muffles his reaction. He’s an outside observer, he’s not allowed to have a vote. Tony, though, he stops his reaction, he stops breathing. He sits still and unmoving.
Steve lets Tony’s erection slide from his mouth and feels the heat of embarrassment touch his cheeks. “No, not this.”
“I talked with Helen Cho. I think I can modify the cradle to allow an interface. We should be able to do it. Small neural implant should work. We can do it with one, possibly, two participants. Plant a virus, a worm and destroy him from within.” Tony tapped the counter when they all stayed stone faced. “Come on, you know this is the way to do it. We can’t chance Ultron going dormant again. There’s no way to scrub every corner of the internet and intranets all over the world to erase the program.”
Tony went to make the coffee in one of those single cup makers. Steve thought they were extremely wasteful. Tony popped in a cup and started it.  He turned and folded his arms as he leaned against the counter.
They eat in silence, that Tony cannot say is companionable, but at least it’s not adversarial. After he finishes the broth, Tony puts the bowl aside and picks the bread apart, eating it. “Tell me, the story of Captain Steve Rogers.”
“She’s currently scanning your database, feeding your omega with all of the requested information on your family history. Including your mother’s legal fight regarding the Carbonelli inheritance and their Ownership planets.”
Steve rubbed at his neck and coughed. The rest of the team came to order and, when Steve signed for them to stand down, they did. Bruce curled in on himself and, as Steve approached, shied away even more. Steve tried to offer some kind of comfort with his words, but what could he say? He understood so little of the new world around him – so much less than he originally thought.
“Hope Clint got that old bucket away or we’re not getting out of here,” Sam says and yanks out his blaster rifle. “You ready?”
Instead of making Steve feel entirely embarrassed, Tony sits up and pulls Steve up with him. He kisses him, lovingly tasting the musk on Steve’s lips. “We need some lube, but I really didn’t travel with any. So we’ll have to skip that part for now. You can blow me. Do you want me to blow you?”
“Something else.” He sits onto one of the stools, staring at the messy kitchen. He should clean it. But the cold captures him, keeps him its prisoner.
Tony tried not to laugh, and he mostly managed to hold it back. When he did let a little out Steve nearly growled at him. He held up his hands and said, “You’re just so damned cute. Don’t blame me. Can I give you a little show?”
Tony quirks a brow at him. There’s a lot of uncertainty in his voice. Tony wonders if Army boy is some kind of spy boy, really – a really bad one, too.  “If you say so.”
He realizes the truth of it. It sings through him. The bond – so long frayed – has been severed. Nothing remains. His stomach rebels and he stumbles to the toilet, vomiting up nothing but bile and blood. It’s vile and agony. The misery runs through him like a pelting sleet wrecking every part of him.
Tony abruptly stops and drops his hands. The glass door in front of Steve clicks to unlock and then automatically swings open. He tears off the goggles. “What the hell, Steve. I told you I would see you at ten. It isn’t ten yet. What’s the problem? What do you need?”
“I’m not certain of that at all,” Steve said. “Strange is right. We need to focus more. We need to be a team even without the whole soul pack.”
“Well, we are. Too close.” Clint frowned and then eyed Steve. “You see, Steve, I wasn’t a free man when Natasha and I – when the glamour happened.”
I am a little behind in revising and I also have to write my Cap-IM RBB, so I might be a little late posting for the upcoming chapters as I try and get more completed on my RBB. All is well though with this story it's over 100k completed. So I do hope you enjoy it!! <3
“He noticed when he was holding you after the big snap, that your wounds were clearing, that the skin was healing. So, he picked you up and brought you to a shelter and then insisted on giving you blood.” He shrugs. It’s a massive movement. “We transported you to Wakanda. Did the science. Listened to him. Apparently, he’s a universal donor or something. The serum allows him to give blood to anyone regardless of what his blood type is.”
He knows nothing about computers or about artificial intelligence. Tony asks for the impossible. Yet, Steve had never been one to back down from a fight, even one he knew he had no business in and no hope of winning. He starts to ask Tony for advice, but the mirror blurs out like the fog of a steaming shower over the surface. Behind him, he hears the door to his room open.
Tony turned around and glared at him. “I don’t know, you tell me. This whole thing is getting weird. I mean, this afternoon I’m sitting in church and I got my fingers in everyone’s astral projections or souls. And now, I’m – fuck – where am I?”
"The SSR did not disappear. It evolved and there were people within it with their agendas. Howard, Hank they all had their agendas but then it changes. Doesn't it? They wanted him. And they -."  She stops
“We need rest, and we need to eat. Whatever this place is, it plays with our biological clocks. We need to fight it and keep our strength up.” Steve goes back to their little camp site and sits. He pats the space next to him.
“So am I,” Steve whispered. “For so long, I’ve been trying to do the right thing. I told Peggy that once. She said I was dramatic. But it’s true. I’ve been trying to do the right thing, and I still want to, but you have to understand I want to save him. I have to save him.”
“Yes,” Strange replied. “His soul resides in pieces, more so than any of yours does. His soul is splintered into each and every one of yours. Because of this the larger the pack gets the more dangerous it is for him. When there are issues amongst the pack, he feels them greatly, more than any of you do. When the pack doesn’t unify, he is the one who suffers. He’s not only the pack leader but he’s the one who gave his soul to each of you.”
“This little helper of yours is a Kree spy,” Obie declares. He rips the bracelet off Steve’s wrist. “Look at the craftsmanship. That’s not standard Fleet tech. That’s something else.”
“How do you know I like the rain?” Steve asked. Tony and Steve had never spoken about likes and dislikes. They’d only gone for each other’s throats. When he thought of that fact, it only served to sadden him. The chances they’d missed.
“No, we weren’t. Pepper was a great support. That’s all. We should only have ever been friends. Ever have anyone in your life like that?” He doesn’t expect an answer and forges ahead. “Anyway, we ended it. Pepper left and now I’m free to be who I want to be.”
Tony smiles. “Of course, we. As long as we can get our shit together and stop hiding crap from one another. I think we can do pretty good together.”
“I will never surrender,” he says. His heart thumps a beat as if he’s still running, still racing away. He pulls off his helmet and throws it aside. “I am ready to fight for my freedom.”
“Sooner or later we will deal with it. We’re a pack. He’s part of it. We’ll figure it out,” Natasha said. The bond shook, tremulous and bright, but it remained.
After a first round on the road to the docks and then back to the house, Steve heads the bike toward rougher terrain. He hits the meadows and it’s rocky and bumpy, but he controls the handlebars and wheels as if he’s part of the bike. It isn’t like dirt bike riding because those bikes are made for off road. This is raw and coarse, yet Tony finds a certain freedom even in it. Eventually, Steve turns back to the road and brings them down to the dock again. Tony’s limbs shake as he gets off the bike once Steve parks. His whole body’s on fire. His nerves scream at him and his muscles ache with adrenaline.
Steve gulped down his fear as his image in the recording focused on the camera. “I wish. I wish that Tony Stark – the brilliant, beautiful, arrogant, sad man ever saw me as anything but his Personal Assistant. But that’s what I am Chris-Christern, Christy Evermore Everly. Or whatever. But no. No, Tony, Tony, Tony. He doesn’t. You see? He -” He stumbled a little as he spoke. “He doesn’t see me. He can’t see me. He just works and works. He’s changing the world and he never sees me.”
“You liked having Mic and Fritz together, didn’t you? Liked getting choked by their dicks together, Liked watching that, liked seeing their cocks all stuffed in your goddamned mouth,” Rumlow says and throws his head back. “Sweet Jesus, sweet Jesus, I could fucking do you all day.” He grunts something bestial and then jerks, freezing as he orgasms.  Steve squeezes his eyes closed and cringes.
She giggles. “God, Steve, calm down. You’re not going to war. If you don’t want to do this, I can get you off the station-.”
The alpha says, “If I stepped over your limits. I apologize. I thought you were a sub omega and wanted to be controlled. You preferred orgasm control, humiliation, and no safe word. Is that correct?”
“I don’t have a choice,” Steve answers. “I need to go now.” He lets go of her hand and starts away when she calls to him.
Pepper’s nails dug into his arm. He turned to see what upset her to see the shadow next to the bench move.
Tony drops his hands in defeat. “No. Not this time, JARVIS. I’m afraid my head’s just not right.” The idea of loving, wanting at one time seemed so foreign and hostile to him. All he ever saw had been his parents’ marriage, a charade put on for the media. Closed doors told a different story. One that caused him to cuddle up with his little toy lion and huddle under the blankets waiting for the screaming to stop.
The hesitation isn’t slight’ it’s downright behemoth. The pause becomes so uncomfortable that Sam jerks a little to the side and Steve’s eyesight blurs again. He claps a hand over his eyes. The haziness of his vision is enough to cause his stomach to rebel.
“I’ll get you hot chocolate and a big breakfast, but Cho wants you awake, so you have to get up,” Tony responds and this time his voice sounds a little frantic.
A knock on the door and then a woman enters. She’s slender and her dark tightly coiled hair is chopped short. She wears large hooped gold earrings and an elaborately printed dress. He stands when she enters.
Her words had been more confusing and confounding than she probably thought they would be for him. Thor thought of himself as a simple warrior. Maybe that was why the mantle of king always ill fit him. When he joined the Avengers, Thor found himself in a spot that gave him comfort. He didn’t have to figure things out, he didn’t have to dig deep. There was a foe, he stood his ground, he fought for right and good. And then he rested, slept, and ate. It seemed a good life.
“As much as he can be, yes.” Tony pushed forward without explaining his comment about Bruce. Steve never spent a great deal of time with Bruce, but from the few times he had, he accepted that Bruce had his reservations and issues. “Bruce has a history with understanding what it means to be a vampire. Not sure he gets whatever the hell I am right now, but he will. He’s a smart guy.”
“Steve?” Sam asked. The seriousness of the situation settled over them like the cloak of night. “We’re in trouble, aren’t we? All the vampires, the mates, the sympathizers. With the US going full hog crazy, we’re all in a world of trouble, aren’t we?”
It was only a dream. He told himself these lies. Tony wasn’t breaking any rules. He met Steve’s gaze and it captured him. He could no more rebuff Steve than he could walk away from his identity as Iron Man. Part of him, an empty, vacuous place, filled and he kissed Steve, bringing him down to the bed, laying Steve on top. Steve explored, tentatively and hesitantly as if their time together here in the dream state was their first. Tony knew it wasn’t. So did Steve. But it seemed to Tony that the dream state felt more real, more actual than it had ever felt. Even the fact that they both acknowledged it as a dream state – could it be shared? – was new. The dreamscape became a kind of soul reality to him, and he saw the same reflected back in Steve’s expression, in his desire, and in his yearning for it to be true.
Steve presses his lips together and catches a glimpse of Bucky, riddled with pain and thrown back into the depths of nightmares. Steve knows, he’s been there himself – too many times. “I don’t think that’s wise.”
She walks a feet meters away from him and then turns around. “You have to understand, Ultron was essentially downloaded into Tony’s brain. The information –well, from what I can glean – some of the information stayed with Tony, especially parts of it that he could link to, understand, have some context for.”
“It isn’t pleasant.” There’s no vomit smell in the helmet – but the bleach stench overpowers everything. It stings his eyes. “How long ago did he wash this thing out?”
“I’ll stay for the procedure, but I’m not sticking around. I want to make sure you’re all right, kid. But that’s all. I gotta go. There are – things I need to do.”
“Go there and your strength will be purged. Go there and your soul tarnished. You will no longer be the champion of the Realm. You will be tainted,” the Soul Keeper had said to him. “There the tortured souls of the Realm reside – they have been turned by the Red Knight himself. You know this. Do not go there.”
“You don’t know.” He covered his face with his hands. “You don’t know what I did.” He didn’t deserve to have a new life – not after what had happened.
“Nice?” Tony huffs at him. “It’s spectacular. The high tech imagery and effects are outstanding. State of the art really. Of course, the art is kind of old considering-.”
Tony beams. He reaches out, finds Steve’s arm, and then grasps his hand. “I couldn’t have done this without you. Not a minute of it. And the dock? That was as much me as you. I shouldn’t have been so careless.” He makes grabby hands. “My glasses. Give me my glasses.”
Steve jumped up from the stool and raked his hands through his hair. “No, no. I’m not worried about Peggy. She’s – I know she’ll be okay. A lot of people are there to care for her including her children. But – no. This – this will not end well.”
For a drawn out space of time, Steve understands that, in fact, Tony was, is in danger. The peril he seeks to avoid he’s welcome to his bed. The horror of it turns over in his belly and Steve bites at his tongue not to gag. In one fleeting moment, Tony shares a harried look with Steve and then turns back to his intended and pecks him on the cheek.
They made the bank of elevators without encountering anymore resistance. Natasha whispered, “Keep alert. They’re close.”
“What? You gonna tell me you were voluntold?” Bucky hisses. “Not only does it mean this whole shebang is going to start all over again with Stark and him mooning like a babyfaced school kid, but it also means he won’t be free of his duties on time for the Rails.”
In the year 1969, the United States of America landed Apollo 11 on the moon. The astronauts, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin took the first steps of any human on a celestial body other than Earth. During their time on the lunar surface an unknown radiation wave was detected but not reported to the whole of humanity. It could not be explained and therefore was not widely disseminated. The American government theorized it was the USSR. The Soviets had indeed beat the Americans to the moon. After careful inspection of the data, scientists on Earth headed by the prominent billionaire, Howard Stark, showed that the radiation source originated from the dark side of the moon. The astronauts were instructed to retrieve the radiation source.
The Enforcer took up residence right next to Clint. Ross gestured to Clint. “You are on duty, Agent Barton. You know what he did to Agent Rumlow.”
“What the hell is happening to him?” Pierce asked. Though his voice was quiet, his tone gave his anxiety and fear away.
He glances at his own Companion. Sweet and lovely, but his soul animal is small, thin, but ferocious. She's wiry and, as his mother has said, all spit and vinegar. What she doesn't have in size and health she has in attitude. She's a brindled blue and gray and black. The gray mimics the silver in the boy's Soul Companion.
Steve shouldn’t tell anyone, he should keep it to himself. But he needs help and Tony risked everything to save him. “It’s when the worlds break down.”
A shadow comes into the light and Tony quakes with rage. “Estane.” Estane’s forces undermined the estate. The security must have been compromised, and that could mean only one thing. The security systems didn’t recognize Estane and his forces as intruders.  Tony thought he covered all of the backdoor access points that Estane might have rooted into the system when he’d been in charge.
Steve pulls out his supplies from the inner pocket of his robe, lays a towel onto the floor and settles down to slowly work himself open so that he can fit a thick plug in his ass. It takes some time because he’s always tight – a thing his client truly love about him. He blushes a little just thinking about it. He hopes the prince will be impressed with him. He knows he’s not a brawny kind of fella and that other sex workers are more attractive.
“What the-?” Tony looks from the piles of branches to the lion and then back again. “Shit. How did you know? How did you get that?”
Bruce chewed at his lip and shook his head. His hands and temples were a shade of green that warned and terrified at the same time. “Back then, way back then when I was working with Ross and his daughter, he wanted to figure out the secret to the vampire immortality more than anything.”
Tony slides in and hits that sweet spot again; Steve goes mad with desire and shouts out. He begs Tony for more. There’s sweat over his chest and his abdomen. Come spills over his chest and Tony leans down, licking it up. Steve jerks and throbs beneath him.
“I have a warm compress.” Steve’s voice startles him. “I’m sorry I should have announced I was here. I’ll be more careful about that in the future.” He comes closer; Tony can smell the scent of his shampoo and soap. It’s mild and relaxing. It reminds Tony of summer. “I’m going to put this on your eyes and forehead.”
Tony grabs the bag off his shoulder and instead of heading toward Steve’s quarters says, “Stay with me.” He doesn’t wait for a reply but walks straight to his quarters.
Steve grumbles and focuses on getting to his feet. The pain swoons his senses and for a second the all too perfect world blacks out, but he’s able to fight through it and stay on his feet. They have to do some recon to figure out what Ultron has up his metal sleeve for this rim. The glitches have been far less – that means Ultron’s learning, but it also means his learning capacity has shifted. Ultron’s decided to go with what he knows instead of rebooting characters and the game to add more information. He’s locked his resources so to speak.
