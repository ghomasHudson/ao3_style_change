He prayed through the Rosary, imagining the smooth, cool beads slipping through his fingers and making gentle clicking sounds as they gathered in his palm. Hours could have passed while Steve was devoted to his meditation, so he jumped, startled, when a nurse laid a hand on Steve’s shoulder.
Steve…” Tony panted, and Steve was pushing his sweater over his head, messy, fervent, illicit. They recklessly risked being heard or seen, risked never seeing each other again if caught, but they were starving for each other and weak against the pull of hunger. Tony dragged Steve backwards, until he bumped into the dusty dining table, still scattered with yellowed, abandoned papers. Steve pressed against him until Tony wrapped his legs around Steve’s hips. Tony hungered, crying out softly when Steve’s grip was too hard.
“Christ Almighty!” Steve shouted, nearly flinging his laptop across the room in his haste to shut the lid.
“Touché, Mon Capitan. However, I don’t work furiously for two solid hours, then pretend I’ve done nothing.”
They fooled around with the idea for a long while, starting slow with Steve holding Tony down a little more firmly than usual, Tony urging him to use a bit more of his strength to pin him in bed. Steve took to the rough talk so easily that Tony could have melted into the sheets, almost in disbelief that his charming, sweet-talking husband could spit such delightfully venomous filth. They got rough with each other, and every time they tried it, it was better than the last, until Tony said one night that he wanted to do it for real. Plan it out and everything. Steve just looked at him, drinking him in like he somehow thought he was the lucky one in this relationship, and sighed a breathless “yes, god please, Tony.”
Tony opened the door, stumbling out of the car in enough haste that he left his phone on the dash. He headed upstairs, finding himself pressed in the corner of the elevator as he slipped into the right frame of mind, his fingers trembling a bit from the spike of adrenaline. When the door opened, he paced about the living room for a bit, growing antsy when a minute passed, then five, then ten. As he built up the fantasy, the scene in his mind, his body followed, and the adrenaline began to feel like a knot of anxiety in his stomach, and he ended up perched stiffly on the edge of the couch when the elevator opened and Steve strode in, all authority and thunderous expression.
“You-“ Steve started, his complete inability to talk to guys (or girls for that matter) getting the best of him. “Uh, thanks.” He picked up the drink and sipped, and couldn’t stop himself from an inappropriate moan.
He started their game early, murmuring filth in Tony’s ear all night. He kept a tight, possessive hand on Tony at all times, and cut in whenever Tony was dancing with someone else. Once he slipped up behind Tony out of sight while Tony was coming back from the bathroom, pinning him to the wall with a strong hand to the back of the neck, and rubbed himself on Tony’s ass for a moment.
“Mm, I’m starting to realize that,” Steve said, tapping his fingers idly on the cushion between them. He would be okay with Tony taking his hand. But he didn’t want to seem to eager. Tony looked at him with that perceptive gaze over the rim of his coffee cup, then rested it on his knee.
“You don’t know shit. You all didn’t even suspect until you saw them kiss,” he said right back, and Natasha and Rhodey just beamed like they’d always wanted them to get together, and their wish was finally coming true.
“Sorry,” he said. Tony ignored his apology and leaned forward, pushing the decadent drink an inch towards Steve with just his index finger.
“You know I’m not showing up here every day to- to- prostitute myself out for free drinks and- and-“
The others stared, and Steve knew they probably thought he was strategizing on the fly, making sure to find a way to get the details of Tony’s condition. And they
The others waited for him in the ICU waiting area, empty coffee cups littering the side tables around them. How long had Steve been in there? Natasha moved over so Steve could sit, and he did, silently.
Tonya rolled her eyes and turned back to Steve. “Cosplay me… in the bedroom?” he asked in a look that spoke that he was both concerned and flattered at the same time.
“Chris Evans? Cosplay?” He asked confused. It was then that Tonya realized that his outfit was still the same as when she died. It was dirty, war-torn, and Mjornr was still in his other hand… “What… I was just on the battlefield watching my best friend… Hell,
It was a strange sensation… Giving up her life to save Millions even Billions of people. Something no one, including him...herself thought was possible. After which was the start of a brand new journey… he woke up in a strange place. Some kind of weird afterlife. Natasha was there poking at him like she’s seen a ghost.
They were both ambitious and determined to make their parents proud. Lori was less of a dick that he was in the last life, but she was still mischievous. While they were not actually
She regretted her reply when Lori came back onto the device. “Oh, so I guess I no longer have to cosplay him in the bedroom.”
AN: Since Lori/Loki still has the shape-shifting ability, I will use the pronouns connected to the form that she holds at the time. If she is Lori I will use “she/her” if she is Loki or any other male persona I will use “he/him.”
“I’m… Tonya Kelvin… And you came out of a portal in my forge… What did you mean more than friends?” She asked confusing the poor man even more. She was so much in shock that she couldn’t really focus on the fact that she was
” he mutters, then covers his mouth with an hand. “Don’t tell mom!” he begs, and Morgan puts a finger in front of her mouth too, shushing like it’s a secret within them.
Tony pouted and crossed his arms “You’re making fun of me! Why don’t you find another teacher then?!”
The man indeed beams, and his eyes immediately fall on Tony. Tony smiles back. Once again, grateful for the fact that his daughter seems to like Steve as much as he does.
Her words warm Tony’s chest and he smiles even though she cannot see him. “I’m happy too” he confesses.
Steve grabbed both of his hands, forcing him to step closer, then placed one hand on his back and quietly rested his head on the socket between Tony’s neck and shoulder.
The first night he had stared at the wall for hours and hours straight, not managing to find the peace he was so sure he would finally pursue once the reactor would be gone. He really thought the problem with his anxiety was the presence of the shining thing on his heart, that perhaps knowing everything was fine once again, perhaps seeing his chest cured again, would finally quieten him.
“Mine broke” Morgan complains as she hands out her kite, the string knotted and impossible to make it fly.
He spots Tony laying on his belly like the day before, his tanned muscles stretching, the curve of his back quite inviting as it leads to his toned ass. Steve turns away his gaze.
Steve shrugs with nonchalance, emptying his drink with just one gulp. “When you’re in the army, you learn to do a lot of things” he flashes Tony a smirk, and Tony chuckles loudly.
Tony chuckles along with them, takes them both in his arms, and makes them flop in the water with more splashes.
Steve wets his lips with amusement, subtly intrigued by the change of path the afternoon is taking. He suddenly wishes for the girls to have remained on the beach, maybe he and Tony would have finally come up with something.
During those afternoons in his lab, at some point he had started talking with Steve, at first just little sentences, thoughts about the weather, or senseless informations. Then, out of nowhere, he had actually asked him how his day was going, and he had felt so dumb.
Steve knows, but it’s kinda close, and it’s just something Steve wants to keep to himself to always remember these nice days they spent together.
Steve strokes his hand once more, then catches his mouth for a brief kiss, all smiles and a little joyful giggle, then confesses “I did too.”
At the nickname Steve laughs loudly, and the sound makes Tony’s stomach do a flip-back, and he cheers in his mind for such an accomplishment.
He asked himself what was the reason of that unexpected kindness of Tony, he even questioned the possibility that he was making fun of him and that sooner or later he would have made a joke or something, and popped that soft and reassuring bubble that had been created around them.
“Uh?” Tony had tried to look quite disinterested, even though the thought of Steve being upset would make him feel a piercing ache in his chest.
And for so much time he had felt so vulnerable whenever someone had aimed at touching the reactor, or just only looked at it; like they wanted to take away from him the only thing that could actually help him through the fog of his own thoughts. But the reactor was making him so exposed that he knew he had to undergo that operation, and it’s not like he is somehow regretting it, it’s just that it was his own anchor, a reminder, a physical post-it that would tell him
Tony shudders. Sharp and precise trembles make him quiver like he’s going to burst, like he will shatter and fall on the ground.
He sees Morgan a lot, he really does. And Pepper is a sweetheart, and they never disagreed on any terms about their divorce, but Morgan inevitably spends most of her time with her mother, and there are weeks when he and Pepper are both overwhelmed with work and cannot really give much attention to their daughter. The only difference is that once she’s home, Pepper gets to see her, while Tony doesn’t.
Steve keeps on shushing him, caressing his cheeks and wiping out his tears and quietly, slowly and silently the world starts regaining its original liveliness: his sight focuses again and his mind manages to grasp the event that is taking place in his bedroom, in front of him.
“Steve, are you awake?” he whispered from outside the room, by leaning to the door knowing it was quite impossible to hear his soft voice from there. But apparently Steve was really awake, and could hear him quite and well thanks to his super-hearing.
Tony knows the feeling. Actually, in a slightly different way, but he often wonders how things would be if he and Pepper worked it out. He thinks Morgan understands what happened, she realises that something went wrong between her parents, but she never once made it look like that made her uncomfortable.
The inside of the pub is indeed not too crowded. They find a table in the corner of the place, and sit down waiting for the waiter. When he approaches them, Tony orders for them both, just to remind Steve that he’s his host. Steve doesn’t complain at Tony’s order, he even seems to enjoy the wooing.
“Cold! Cold! Cold!” Mary chants back, but they keep on swimming anyway, refreshed by the cold water.
His laughter makes the girls turn around. “Hey! Why are you laughing behind our backs?” Mary asks with a frown, and that makes him and Steve laugh even more.
They stop, since the two little girls prefer to swim where they are able to still touch the ground with their feet.
It had never occurred to Tony he should state how much he loved Steve, to highlight feelings he was experiencing just to make him understand his affection toward him.
Steve brings an hand to his forehead, combs away one of Tony’s curls. “Better late than never” he states leaving a quick peck on Tony’s lips. He reaches down with his hands now, resting them in the middle of Tony’s back, drawing him even closer.
“Hi”, she murmured and as soon as Steve recognised Tony’s brown eyes in her, he smiled softly to hearten her.
if it’s still inside his bones- he can’t know, because there is no blue light shining through his pale skin, there is just skin, red and white skin, stitches and scabs and veins that seem about to explode in any time.
Mary opens her mouth with understanding. “Oh, you mean Morgan? Yeah, later I’ll ask her” she replies, before turning her focus back on her words game.
“I’ve had these kind of episodes for some time now: I know they won’t magically go away. I can only try and make it through it”, Tony swallows: being so open about his mental illness makes him feel overly exposed, but he knows he can trust Steve, and as he talks about it, he can feel himself growing more confident.
Tony ruffles her hair once again. “I know that, why would I choose you for my team, otherwise?” he winks.
“Somewhere up in the sky, among those dark clouds, there is a place where you have placed all those stars you brought away, am I right, baby?”, he bawled, “please, oh please tell me I’m right!”
He straights up his back and cocks his head, and almost loses a beat when he rests his eyes on a slim and blonde little girl sat legs crossed too near his Morgan, studying the sand building with the same intensity he dedicates to math equations.
Steve rolled his eyes once again, this time with a sense of frustration “Why do you always have to act like this, Stark?!”
Then, when Steve seems wandering with his mind on something else he kisses him quickly. “Hey” he calls. “You can stay here, tonight. The girls are away all the same, there is no need for you to go.”
Tony closes his eyes, his eyelashes flutter and his lips part. The act makes Steve’s chest clench, and he brushes his thumb over Tony’s lips, just to feel the softness of it. Tony shivers quietly, even though it’s hot as hell, and he lets out a tiny whimper that sends sparks along Steve’s spine.
The rush of the previous attack has left him quite worn out, and even though he has now come back to all his senses, he still feels tired and kind of sleepy. He’s starting to feel a hint of anxiety pooling in his stomach again at the thought that he’s about to spend another sleepless night.
Tony can almost see a light, a tiny flame trembling like his heart; his hands quieten, they are no longer strained with terror, they now feel like limbs again, and softly fall on his lap. His teeth loosen a little, but his lips are still parted and swollen with tears.
They arrive in front of the hotel, and there is an instant in which Tony wonders if something is going to happen. But then Steve pushes his hands in his pockets, distancing himself a little.
At first he really thought it was normal: he was so used to the light shining in the middle of his chest that when darkness would swallow him during night time, he couldn't be able to not even close his eyes without panicking in the empty and all black room.
He cheers in his mind, and goes on drawing, contently looking at the piece as it starts taking life under his pencil. Tony has such a perfect bone structure that it’s truly a pleasure to Steve to impress it on paper, and he’s not a little bit annoyed by the fact that he has to look more minutely at Tony’s features to get them right.
“What are you listening to?” Steve looked at the bright display of Tony’s mp3, and read the title’s song out loud. “Tchaikovsky?” he made a confused look.
Shrugging, Tony shushes his apologies away. “Don’t worry” he scoffs. “I know what it means to have a smartass kid” he assures.
“What about you, Steve?” he asks, his voice leaking a flirty tone, and he smiles with amusement when he notices Steve’s cheeks getting colored.
Then Steve finally breaks the silence. “Did you?” he quietly asks, and at first Tony looks confused.
Steve tightens his lips, and he fidgets uncomfortably on his beach chair. “Yeah, but-“ he tries again. “It’s very hot, and the water is so clear and refreshing- why don’t you ask her now?” he insists.
“What’s this?” Steve asks all of a sudden, holding in one hand a cd rom and making it swing. He intensely looks at its surface with a furrowed expression. “Luigi Tenco” he mumbles, trying to spell the name right even though it comes out with a K rather than a C.
He spent the whole time doodling on his papers failing to answer properly whenever someone asked his opinion on the topic. Furthermore he couldn’t quite pay attention to the talking and even if he so desperately did not want to admit who was the main reason of his inattention, he knew it had blonde hair and blue eyes.
He would have never thought he could miss a person to this point, and he knows Steve has just been  away for a few days, but lately he has felt so lonely that he can’t help but long for seeing his beloved.
He looked in the distance, his smile slowly dying: upon the ocean dark clouds seemed to approach. It was going to rain that afternoon.
Tony’s hand is still holding his, and Tony strokes it with affection. “Whenever you’re ready” he reassures him with another smile, and Steve thinks this is what love sounds like.
Meetings are more interesting when he can spot the blonde man on the other side of the table: he likes to discuss in front of him, to explain his reasons and to even argue with him knowing that they will make up a little after. And the whole subject of that evening has been so boring that Tony had found himself not paying attention not even for a minute. He just kept reminding that Steve was going to return and he couldn’t wait to see him again, to hug him and kiss him ‘till falling asleep.
When Steve arrives, he’s wearing a light blue shirt that matches his eyes. Tony looks at him with a pleasant smile, which only intensifies when he notices the shirt is button down. He can trace the line of Steve’s lean neck, his skin slightly flushed because of the morning sun.
After some time he started feeling hot and so he removed all his clothes. His body was becoming loose and pliant, getting ready for a thorough pounding. But now Tony was genuinely concerned. What if Steve really refused to touch him.
But Tony didn’t know how to explain that to Pepper. He also didn't know how to verbalise that without Steve he couldn’t breathe properly. He couldn’t sleep. He couldn’t live. He didn’t want Steve. He needed him.
Suddenly the Avengers alarm rings and JARVIS warns then of an imminent attack from Doombots. Fuck Dr. Doom.
“Now what would a pretty omega like you be here at this time of the night?” Great, five minutes of being stuck in the past and he was getting the delicate omega stereotype. Just great.
He would do anything to get the man back in his life. He just wanted a chance. One chance. But he didn’t know how to look into the face he loved after calling the man clingy.
“Didn’t faze you before, you got used to it pretty soon.” Tony is tired of this fight, he just wants to lie down and go to sleep for a thousand years.
Steve didn’t think like this. He was taught differently. He believed in equal omega rights. He isn't like this but these days there is something in the air that makes him want to be like that.
“I am not leaving, never again. I can’t live without you, Tony. I don’t know why I was stupid enough to stay away. And I don’t know how I didn’t spend every waking minute making you feel as loved as you deserve. I love you.”
Tony was pliant and lost to the pleasures of his body. Orgasms left omegas in a state of utter bliss, as a biological quirk to make sure that their alphas do not abandon them during such a time and as a way to make breeding easier. He softly kissed his mate, rubbing his hands on Tony's belly. A child. Their child.
Immediately Steve begins to protest it. “Tony baby no, please. I don’t like living without you. Waking up in the morning and not seeing you there feels like torture. Please. I’ll sleep in a different room but please let me come home.”
“You can’t move back in just now.” Tony knew this one would hurt, but he didn’t trust Steve completely and the past months had set them back years.
Steve, on the other hand, had nothing to offer Tony. It wouldn’t be a fight at all. Even now, he could feel the man pull away from him a little.
“Oh really, then why did you come running today? I could have been getting fucked by someone.” Steve was always the possessive kind. Let him think that Tony had moved on and was fucking every alpha in sight. Even though Tony knows he hasn’t touched anyone, unable to stomach the idea of others.
He was in the arms of the Ton’s most eligible bachelor and he wished to be anywhere else in the world.
He turned and looked at Steve. He didn’t know what to do. In some part of his brain, what Steve did made some sense. But his heart was so sore and he didn’t want to feel like this ever again. Once burnt twice shy or whatever.
After months of thinking and discussions, Tony and Steve had finally decided that they were ready to start a family. They had been dating for over two years and Tony wasn’t getting any younger. But the decision to stop taking the daily suppressants had many unforeseen side-effects on Tony's body. For one, his skin had become oversensitive to everything. And after the incident in the kitchen with Thor and Clint Steve didn’t really want other people to see Tony naked, so he had to wear clothes. But Tony absolutely refused to do that when sleeping so he had started sleeping naked.
“It’s not good, but he’ll recover with some time and physical therapy,” Dr. Cho said, flipping to a page in Tony’s chart. “The lower bullet punctured his lung, and he developed pneumothorax- air in the chest cavity,” she amended when Steve looked at her for an explanation. “The oxygen is just to help him along until he can take a good lungful of air. The second bullet lodged in his shoulder and damaged some muscles in his rotator cuff. I don’t think he’ll need further surgery to correct it, but definitely extensive physical therapy.”
“Green,” he mumbled. “Thought you were gonna give me some dick? Haven’t had any good enough to write home about yet.” Tony’s slurred words were cut off with another sharp slap to his cheek, and then abruptly he couldn’t see, as Steve tied the necktie over Tony’s eyes. Then Steve was bodily flipping him, so that Tony’s arms were twisted up and he was on his knees, bent in a somewhat painful position, and then his pants were being yanked to his knees and then off his body entirely, leaving him fully nude and vulnerable. Steve must have hidden some things down here in advance, because when he slammed his cock into Tony, it was fully lubed. However, that didn’t take away the burning stretch, ripping another scream from Tony’s raw throat, which echoed around the room like a dozen Tonies crumbling in concert.
“Gotta do something. Looks like my laptop is going to be a brick for the foreseeable future. I’m just trying to write down as much as I remember of what I already wrote, just in case I do end up losing it,” he said, sighing with frustration. Tony frowned at him for several long seconds.
The finality of Steve’s words and tone had Tony gasping a shaky, uneven breath, tears starting to pool on his lashes.
“See? It has a new HD display that is better than anything on the market. It has a liquid-state hard drive that I have a half dozen patents on, and more terabytes than even NASA could use. Every media port you could possibly need is here, and it has retrofit capabilities so I can add more as they’re invented. I can’t wait for you to try the writing software, it’s so good it even makes
Tony immediately gagged when Steve’s cock stretched brutally into his throat, his body trying to double over, but Steve held him fast. He held Tony down, keeping his throat full as Tony’s throat spasmed, until Tony was scrabbling against Steve’s thighs for air, clawing at his hips in earnest as he tried to get his feet under him enough to kick. As soon as he did, Steve released him, throwing Tony away from him, and Tony fell hard to the ground, sucking in air and coughing and gagging. Spots bursting before his eyes from lack of oxygen, he unsteadily tried to crawl away from Steve toward the kitchen, as though to hide behind the kitchen island.
There was a quiet moment where they just enjoyed looking at each other before Tony jerked his chin towards the corner of Steve’s notebook.
Steve flushed, but nodded, running his fingertip absently over the spiral edge of the notebook, making a zipping sound as he did so.
He took comfort in the words, his lips moving silently as he recited the Hail Mary, pleading for her intercession on Tony’s behalf.
Steve must have been riding the edge the whole time, because his rhythm was already stuttering, and Tony’s defeated sobs mingled with Steve’s moan as he came so hard that Tony could feel the spurts filling him. Steve’s rhythm slowed, but he didn’t pull out. Tony could feel warmth leaking down his inner thighs, but couldn’t even look at Steve with the blindfold on. He tugged at his wrists, trying to get himself into a more stable position, but all it did was strain his shoulders.
Steve launched out of his chair, knocking it over in the process, and ran towards the counter, going the long way around, since he was neither tall nor graceful enough to hop it like Tony did. He ran right up behind Tony and pulled him around by the arm. Tony looked at him in surprise, and maybe a little fear, as though he’d ruined things.
Steve nods. “Since I was a kid,” he explains. “I would come here with my mom, spent a lot of time looking for shells” he looks in the distance, where the sea stretches. “She would pierce them and make jewels out of them. I may still have a necklace or something” Steve smiles at his own memory, and Tony joins him, feeling warm at the sweet way Steve is remembering the moment.
But he was lying down before, and the surgeons hid his chest then, so he did not really notice the lack of a light under his chin.
It wasn’t because he didn’t care, not ever. It was because he didn’t think he could even do it, to allow himself this possibility, not to even dare saying out loud how happy he was of not being alone.
“Tony”, Steve called, looking at the headstone once again, “you promised you would never leave, were are you now?”
He was looking downward as if he was trying to balance a great weight on his shoulders or as if he was just afraid he was going to trip at any moment due to his bad reflexes.
Morgan turns to look at her friend, still smiling. “She’s Mary!” she replies loudly. “Mary, this is my daddy.”
“Yeah, I tell that to myself too” he admits. “But you know, when you notice your daughter is growing and you’re missing most of it- that’s kinda sad.”
“It is indeed!” Tony claps back. “I don’t have a lot of free time. This, for example, is the only free week I conceded myself to relax and finally spend some time with my daughter.”
when Tony couldn’t stop teasing him to the point that Steve had actually started questioning if he was flirting with him.
When he was talking and talking and talking; when he kept on cracking up puns and jokes even in the most critic moments; when he bursted out laughing when they were discussing something important. And when Steve was all serious, stiff in his Captain America suit, and Tony just showed up wearing a printed shirt of some band and with that haughty attitude of his.
Every time they were about to take an important decision Steve felt like Tony proposed something opposite only to get on his nerves, just to test him, wanting to actually make him snap at him just for the purpose of it.
Steve’s head was now resting peacefully next to the heart of his beloved, his fingers still in the act of tracing those painful words:
“You wanna put it on?” Tony asks, subtly looking at the blond man still focused on the object between his hands.
His words came out clear in the silence of the moment, broken only by the swift waves that crushed on the water edge.
The hurt look on Steve’s face made him finally weep, and he felt such a kid, and once again he tried to look away, but Steve’s fingers were on him again, now gently stroking his hair and back, and holding him tight in his arms.
Mary has been doing crossed words the whole morning. She’s sitting under the umbrella, her bright eyes focused on the paper between her small hands.
“You’re a watcher too, apparently” he teases, and then he stretches again, just to see Tony’s reaction, and he’s pleasantly rewarded by a choked low groan from him.
So he’s still thinking about Steve, about those big blue eyes of his, about his shy smile and ruffled hair in the morning when they wake up next to each other and how it still feels like a dream, even after so much time, to be able to spend the whole night between his arms.
. It still wasn’t enough to Tony, he still needed to feel the raw contact with burning and living flesh, and he did not want it to be anyone’s contact, he wanted it to be Steve’s. He made his hand slide into Steve’s briefs, moaning himself, mouth wide open, because he wanted to let it all out, he really wanted to feel alive. And Steve reacted with the same enthusiasm, and undressed him too, and touched Tony where his skin was sensitive the most, making him shiver and moan again.
“I cannot believe you don’t know it!”, Tony was marvelling “This is something you learn in first grade!”
Steve smiles sheepishly. “Well, I’m glad you like it” he says. “You know- I’ve been thinking about you a lot. I mean, we’re together basically every moment of the day, but I mean thinking in a different way. Not like thinking you in some way could be less nice than any another way, but-“
They get in position, and Tony and Mary watch as Steve makes the first move. He throws the ball with precision, making most of the skittles fall down.
And freezing tears stream down his pale face: he’s paralysed, shocked by dread of reality itself, of events quite impossible to take place, of moments that have already happened but still make him fear they can repeat themselves.
“Yeah, yeah of course!” he exclaims, and once he has shaken untold thoughts away from his mind, he manages to turn on the music, then proceeds playing the song the other man was talking about.
Steve chuckles lightly. “I do too” he says, then he leans forward and kisses his cheek, leaving Tony kinda dazed. “Good night, Tony” he wishes, before turning away with Mary by his side.
Steve swallows at the joy on his face, suddenly feeling content too. “I’m sorry to bother you” he apologises. “Mary wanted Morgan to go swimming with her.”
The girls are impatient, they keep running around with loud screams, still enthusiast because of the fun of the day.
Tony opens his eyes again, “Would you mind placing your hand on my chest?”, he asks, voice like a whisper.
“Steve…?”, he uncertainly calls, and Steve does answer fixing the cloth on his still shaking shoulders, trying to smooth it while keeping on mumbling some dirge of comfort in the hope of calming Tony down.
The steadiness of that firm and unyielding pale rock was so in contrast with the personality of the man commemorated by it, and to think that Tony, the
He’s afraid: an extreme fear is devouring his soul, he’s not able to think anything because that terror has seized him, has swallowed him in just one bite.
“The sky seems darker now, Tony”, he wailed “perhaps it’s true, isn’t it?” He asked tearing up, “perhaps you really carried all the stars in your eyes, and now, Tony, you have taken them away with you”.
“And right now that I’d actually have thousand of things to do, I can feel my dreams shattering but I can’t think about anything but you.”
“Yes, yes he did!” Steve confirmed “He’s a hero, Morgan. Your dad is a hero”, then hugged the little girl while mumbling again “Tony is a hero”, perhaps mostly to himself.
Steve shrugs but complies. He stretches his arms up in the air, relaxes his neck to prepare for a jump, then he falls in the sea with a swift precise movement. He laps for a moment, before grabbing the small stairs on the back of the boat and lifting himself up.
He was waiting for Tony to make fun of him, to tell a joke, or just poke him because a man of his size was whining like a little boy. But apparently he did not really know Tony, because the way he started speaking left him quite speechless, even though he continued his workout acting casually.
They’re pushing a paddle boat they have rented for the afternoon in the water. It has a slide and the girls can’t wait to get on it.
He certainly had tried to move backward, his heart in his gut, dread pooling in his lungs at the sight of surgeons all ready to put their hands on him. And the mere thought was kind of frightening, especially when it was ages since a stranger had touched him.
It was a late evening when it happened. He was standing on the rooftop of the Avengers’ tower, looking at the night sky and the few stars that were slightly shining in the darkness. He had heard someone approaching him, and when he had turned around he had found Tony standing beside him.
“Then what, ‘Cap?! What?! What is it?” Tony approached him even more, as he kept pointing at him with a kind of rage in his voice “Huh? Wanna tell me what it is? Or am I making you uncomfortable?!”
The blond man’s smile dies on the spot and his face grimaces. His jaw twitches as he says “Yeah, she was a very smart woman.” His voice is full of fondness, and Tony feels like a moron.
His words actually comfort the girl, and she stands up on the spot, reaching out with her hand to grab Morgan’s one. She shakes it. “Nice play” Mary says resolutely. “Congratulations for your victory.”
Tony melts in the embrace, his eyes flutter close while he subtly clears his throat, “Would you mind-”. He stops, squinting his eyes trying to work out the courage.
His heart was racing and his eyes slowly filling with tears once again: he sat on the ground and cried.
At first Tony startled but once Steve opened his mouth to deepen the kiss, the man just let it go and surrendered to the blonde’s tongue.
Steve clears his throat. He tries to come up with something to say, something completely unrelated, like ‘we should go look for the girls’, or ‘wanna go for a dip?’ or even ‘I have to go to the toilet’. But nothing comes out of his mouth, Tony’s eyes way too piercing. He makes a wrenched face, and Tony smiles sweetly at that.
When you enter the room, we have to cut off every fun we were having and just pretend to be all serious and focused on whatever the hell of a mission we are doing because
The next one to play is Morgan, and she manages to take down a couple of skittles. Steve high fives her with a cheer, and the girl giggles with joy.
“It’s just that-“, he begins, then he squints his eyes with his own fingers, lowering his gaze, “I saw something that reminded me of you, while I was away, so I- God, I’m so stupid, Tony, I’m so sorry.”
Steve nods, but they both know they have something else in their minds rather than keeping an eye on the kids.
Tony’s jaw twitches as he looks back at Steve and quietly nods. He would like to add something, but he’s at a loss of words, Steve already said everything.
At last Steve pretends to succumb to their strength, and falls into the water with his whole body, splashing around and mocking a drowning.
They were sitting on the same rooftop spot were they had kissed for the first time, Tony quietly resting on Steve’s chest, a multitude of stars sparkling upon their head.
They’ve been together for a few weeks now, kissing each other around, making it to the bedroom way too often. But still none of them has actually professed a deeper feeling than an affectionate one.
But Steve, Steve always showed up. And they talked and talked and talked, about anything which would cross their minds. And they laughed and looked at each other way too often to be subtle.
“No, no! You don’t understand” Tony laughs. “I’m really dumb, you just have to get to know me” he jokes.
Steve gently pushed him on the bed, then laid on it too, supporting himself on his arms while still kissing Tony passionately. But soon it wasn’t enough again, and Tony had to feel more, because he was feeling alive after a long time, and he wanted to have it all. So he pushed away Steve’s shirt, and caressed his chest in a desperate way, longing for skin contact, and by being pleased by Steve at the same time. Steve pulled away his shirt too, and there he was, touching his muscles with his gentle fingers, lighted up by the blue shine of the arc reactor.
“When my wife passed away,” Steve prompts after a while. “Mary was stil very young. Sometimes it pains me more to know she won’t have any real memory of her, more than what
And right now, seeing his own reflection without that light sparkling in the middle of his chest, without his heart shining to remind him that it is there, and it is functioning, and it is beating and living, that makes him shiver and wanting to cry out loud, and actually dig his own nails in his skin, hoping to find that hidden heart, hoping to find the missing light, the bright shine that would at first keep him awake at night but that was reassuring in its own creepy way.
He arrived at the end of the path, right where the grass and the flowers were now replaced by the sand of a hidden shore that directly led to the ocean. He stopped from proceeding further and with some difficulty he sat down on the sand.
Mary’s shoulders slump. “I’m sorry pop” she whines. “I just wanted to play with Morgan” she holds the other girl’s hand to make her dad see her, and the man’s frown softens.
“Why you standing there just smiling and looking at me like I’m some kind of a baby?!” Tony pouted, faking grudge “act like a man and kiss me again, damn!”
“Mary! I’ve told you not to run away without saying anything” the stranger scolds, his perfectly pinched eyebrows narrowed with reproach. “You made me worry.”
He’s always been cold, he always felt an aching freeze living in his chest but now, now it feels like he’s drowning in ice, like the sun itself stopped shining, like not a single light is still lit in the entire universe.
?!” Tony chuckled “I was joking! You know, two friends kidding around. Nothing sexual, buddy.” He looked really satisfied with his reply, and he grinned naively when Steve flushed once again.
Steve seemed astonished too by his own initiative, considering that until the very last moment he wanted to just straight up hit the man in his face, and now, while he was tasting Tony’s mouth and holding his back with his hands, he quite thanked himself to have sticked to a more peaceful way to assert himself.
The man in front of him grabs his open shirt and quietly strips it away, before picking up a sweater and dressing him up again thus hiding the total lack of light from Tony’s chest.
Morgan frowns. “You’re lying!” she points out, but before Tony can find an excuse to that, she chuckles with her friend.
Tony nodded repetitively, classical music still playing in one ear, so loud that it could damage his own hearing, but not enough to make him feel something beside a grieving emptiness.
Steve briefly laughed. “At three in the morning?” He was standing in front of the window, still dressed with his day clothes.
“Mary!” he reproaches, turning to look at Tony to apologise for his daughter’s manners, but Tony doesn’t seem to mind. He’s laughing too, picking up the little girl out of the water, while she screams and moves her feet in the air.
Tony keeps on shaking his head, still laughing and waving his hand dismissively. “You’d be surprised” he claps back. That gets him a bright and wide smile from Steve, his cheeks lovely flushed. Tony has to drink with more rush this time, his stomach doing funny things not only for the alcol. He really likes this guy.
Steve cackled and looked him in the eyes once again glad that he could deal with such a touchy man. He kissed Tony softly, then changed his look into a more resolute one.
“Thank you”, he says. He would like to express the gratitude he feels it’s exploding in his lungs, to communicate the extreme thankfulness of being taken seriously, the relief he feels pooling in his heart at the thought that he’s not alone anymore, that his problems matter, that he’s not overreacting, that someone’s going to take care of him, and he’s going to get better.
He lays his eyes on his long figure, his slim waist and narrow hips. Tony’s wearing yellow swim-trunks, that day. Steve has discovered Tony has kind of an obsession with it. He’s got swim-trunks in all possible colors, and the shades are so bright that they almost seem to glow against his tanned skin. He’s beautiful all over.
Tony lifts up from the mattress on which he was already laying down and makes himself closer to Steve trying to reach for his worried face with his fingers.
Steve imitates him, and grabs Tony’s hand, holding it as they stroll. Having their fingers enlaced makes Tony smile widely, and Steve replies to his smile with another one.
For a moment he remained on the bench almost as if he wanted to add something, then he stood up and quietly left the training room. Steve was still with his fists up in front of his face, his back turned to where Tony was some instants before.
Steve looks around with a smile. “Yeah, it’s very peaceful” he states. They stop pedaling once they’re far off to sea, and Morgan and Mary hold hands while they jump in the water.
There is a brief silence, very few instants that actually hold too many unspoken promises. Tony nods at him; his cheeks are starting to get to a normal complexion again, and his heart is now beating calmly in his chest.
But Tony wanted more, he wanted more and more and more. And he pulled Steve’s face on his own, his mouth crashing on the blond’s one, this time a little more rushed, and Tony parted his lips and nipped Steve’s ones because he
Tony ponders his words, and realises Steve is probably talking about a time in which Mary’s mother was still with them.
He still remembers lying on the cold bed of the hospital, knowing he was going to lose the thing that meant the most to him, a concrete reminder that he was alive and he had been able to survive even when he was so sure he would have died.
Tony puts his hands up. “I’m always honest, and some things need to be said” he affirms firmly. “You’d be too sexy to even look at” he jokes, but he’s actually just stating a very true thought going around his head.
But now, without even realising it, he’s looking at himself, and even though he would like to turn his look away, he kind of feel hypnotised by the image. He’s immediately struck by the sight of his bare chest: pale skin that tightens and stretches in the shape of a circle, a ghost stitch that reminds him of the arc reactor.
Silence once again, but this time Steve stopped himself from punching the sack, and he just remained still, his fists up in the air, and his look fixated on the ground.
Tony nods smiling too, contentment filling his chest, as he leads the way to Steve. They walk side by side, and Steve seems to be nervous too.
“You won’t” he murmured. “I’m here.” He leaned forward and gently put his arms above Tony’s shoulders, then hugged him tightly, stroking his hand on his back.
“What you’re gonna do when all of this is over?” Steve asked at some point, leaning a little further on his seat, still far enough from the other man not to make him questioning his feelings.
“What?” Tony asked innocently trying to force Steve into explaining himself further “what is that you do
The sky is clear, not even a cloud in sight, and Steve spots Tony looking up, probably thinking the same. When Tony looks back, he stares at him too. “I love this” he comments. “I never took one of these.”
Everything in that mansion seemed to be endowed by Tony’s person: the chimney reminded Steve how the man used to spend most of his nights around the fireplace in the Avengers’ Tower when he couldn’t manage to fall asleep because of some nightmare; the several books and scientific magazines piled beside the couch made him remember how Tony could fit in every situation a quote or a maxim he had learnt by reading those dossiers.
Steve looks impressed, and Tony is feeling kinda silly, when he passes by him and leaves a smack on Steve’s ass with the back of his hand. “Try to top that, sweetheart” he teases.
“I just don’t want to think about losing you” he confessed with a huge urge to cry in his chest, and Steve remained still, his mouth slightly parted.
But there were also times in which Tony was actually a really good speaker; like that time when Steve was feeling really down, just boxing all day trying to find motivation in doing anything at all. He had not told anybody about his sense of despair, because he knew he had to stay strong for the team, and furthermore he didn’t want to bother anyone.
Tony had noticed him after a while, of course. He had waited for the blond man to show himself, but Steve seemed not to have any intention in doing so, so Tony had been quiet, not wanting to spoil the moment. He had enjoyed the gentle touch of Steve’s pencil on the rough paper, and that mere sound had made him feel less lonely.
The music was playing softly in the background, and Tony almost thought that his heartbeat could overcome the sound. He found out he was holding his breath, and relaxed a little trying to enjoy the moment, but he was feeling like a fragile object in Steve’s arms, and he really feared that if the blond man was ever going to let him go he would fall on the ground shattering into pieces.
And then the day they argued in a very excited way Steve had been so impressed at how fast Tony had replied to his provocation with that “genius billionaire playboy philanthropist”. He had felt so angry and kind of humiliated but at the same time he had pretended not to be very turned on by his arrogance.
“Steve” Morgan says after a while, probably in response to Pepper’s question. Tony looks at her frowning, and bends an ear to hear what she’s talking about.
Steve holds him like he’s all he ever wanted, touches him so delicately that Tony breaks at every touch, too eager for it, kissing Steve like he’s drowning and he’s desperately looking for air.
He had deliberately not addressed the battle against Thanos, thinking that it was Pepper’s duty to inform the little girl about it, but one day, once Morgan had asked about Tony’s last fight, the redhead woman had just nodded smiling sadly. “Tell her”, she had allowed him “I want it to be you”.
But he knows he doesn’t have to; he can say “thank you”, two simple words, and meaning a total rainbow of emotions with it.
“Or maybe we could rotate this tower right here, in this way it would be proportioned” the other small voice talks again. “We would just have to make that fort a little wider.”
“I wanted to give you this-“ he speaks again turning to meet his look with Tony’s, now holding something with his fingers, “you know what- forget it”, he scoffs once more and briefly starts once he feels Tony’s soft touch on his skin, gently trying to open his hand.
They’re still sitting one in front of the other, each of them on his own chair, their knees brushing against each other.
When his wife had passed away, he thought that was the end of it. That he was never going to be able to feel his heart beating for someone anymore. And he didn’t even want that. He wouldn’t let himself lay his eyes on anyone, not interested even in the slightest bit to knowing someone new, to take the risk to get affectioned to yet another person and then have his heart broken so painfully.
was that person: Steve would smile at him so gently that Tony could feel every wall and barrier he had built throughout his whole life just fall down, and he would find himself so defenceless but at the same time so protected that he knew he was not going to be able to look in Steve’s eyes anymore without knowing that he could not be more beautiful in any mirror he could possibly look into.
They approach the shore, the two girls jumping with joy and chasing each other, while he and Tony walks slowly side by side. “It’s a very nice day” Steve comments, mostly because he has no idea what to say.
“So daddy saved the world?”, Morgan had questioned melancholic, her eyes watery but filled with hope.
“I mean- you can seek for help. There is nothing wrong in doing so. I’m sure there is someone who could tell you what to do to get better”, Steve smiles at him, so kindly, his look slightly lifting to entwine his eyes with Tony’s ones, “I’d really like to be that person, love, but I know I would not be enough, and it’s right for you to get the best support you can find”.
Tony was stuck for the eternity to just lay there made him feel an agonising ache in his heart and he found himself crying without even realising when it had started.
In the beginning it was rough, waking up in the morning felt like a knife stab in his chest, every little task was wearying, and when the sun was setting he always felt a kind of relief knowing that another day had passed, that he had made it through another day without him, without Tony.
He had learnt to understand Tony, the reason why he always had to laugh everything off with a joke just to prevent himself from getting hurt; the way his look darkened whenever someone hyped up the accomplishments of his father; how he was able to deliver motivational speeches when things seemed to be hopeless. He actually enjoyed finding out little details of Tony’s personality that no one else seemed to notice.
“What-?! No!” Steve yelled “That is not true!” He felt quite hopeless, almost shaking with his face burning.
She picks up a ball with both her hands, probably because of the weight of it, and she throws it like Tony suggested. The ball slides for a couple of seconds before falling in the gutters beside the lane.
Tony is not someone to complain. And without even noticing it, he has been so used to this new routine by now, that when he catches his own reflection for basically the first time since the surgery, he doesn't even know how he should react to the sight.
He’d like to suppress his sorrow, but no, he can’t lie. Not to who is knelt before him looking like he’s feeling his same aching pain.
“It’s different like this” Tony blurts out, helping Steve to take off his own shirt too. When his chest is bare too, Steve looks at him with awe in his eyes.
“I’m sorry!” he raises his hands as a sign of surrender, then he turns to look at the stranger again. “See? Can be a pain in the
“I’m really sorry she bothered you. She can sound as a showoff, but I promise she means no harm” he says with a rueful expression.
He looks down at his own shoes while he walks, mostly to avoid Steve’s eyes. Morgan has always been a sensitive issue to him. He loves her with his entire heart, and would literally do anything in his capacity to make her happy. But there are things that he simply cannot change.
“Were you friends with daddy?”, she asked curiously. Steve nodded, so she added “Do you wanna be friends with me too?”
And Steve cupped his face with a delicate grip, then leaned on him and softly kissed Tony, a gentle kiss, a kind one. Just the brief touch of lips holding promises he wanted to say out loud but couldn’t properly spell.
Mary gives him a sheepishly smile, but her eyes are bright, and Tony suddenly feels uncomfortable. “You’ve met her today?” he asks to his daughter. Sounds weird that the beach of Palm Springs hosts two little geniuses at the same time, but yeah, life is full of coincidences, so.
Still, Tony guilts himself. But he and Pepper just had a very deep affection towards each other, and sometimes it’s enough, sometimes it’s not. They both deserved to fall in love.
The whole sky was now covered with clouds, perhaps in the middle of the ocean it was already raining; but there on the shore there were still little glimpses of sunshine, a late goodbye before the storm.
. He had tried so hard, so so hard to believe in love, to believe in something good, but he he would really always end up with being let down by everyone, and for a moment there, he thought he was going to be all alone for his whole life.
Steve indulged a moment while Tony put on his apron with his back towards Steve. Tony’s shoulders were broad, and would dwarf Steve’s delicate frame. But Tony’s waist was narrow, his lower back dipping just right so that his round ass looked like a heavenly pillow that Steve would kill to bury his face in. He missed Tony’s glance, because he was already back at his typing, unashamed to be using their own names. He always went back and changed them in the edit, anyway.
But falling helplessly, hopelessly, head-over-heels in love for Tony was something entirely different.
Whatcha writing?” Tony asked, flopping next to him on the couch with his usual broad grin, and Steve stuffed the notebook between his thigh and the arm of his couch.
“Could say the same about you,” he said, arching a brow and nodding his head toward the unmanned, empty counter. Tony snorted.
“Help! Someone- some- Steve, don’t fucking do this! You’re out of control, you don’t- this isn’t you!” Tony shouted, his heart racing in earnest as pain started to bloom from his knees and shoulder where he’d hit the ground. He pushed backwards across the floor, away from Steve, who fucking stalked him like a lion playing with its food.
“I don’t know…” Steve said quietly, then became the immediate victim of the most pathetic set of puppy dog eyes he’d ever had cause to witness.
“Nothing,” Steve replied, his grin just as broad. Tony’s bright smile seemed to erase all the frustration of the last three days.
Steve’s hand came up to cup the nape of Tony’s neck, pulling him immovably closer, and he pressed his lips to Tony’s ear, his breath warm and voice smoky.
“Nat! What the fuck did you do, follow us? Oh my god. I want to die. It’s not- would you stop and listen to me? It’s not what it looks like-“
“He isn’t- he’s not… paralyzed, is he?” Steve breathed, immediately in fear that the bullet had gone through Tony’s spine, severing the nerves. He was already reeling, his breath quickening. Tony’s spirit would be
“I-I’m sorry, Steve,” Tony said, his brow furrowing, easily and eagerly diving into the scene that Steve had set. “I didn’t-“
“Jesus Christ, Tony, god I’m so sorry it took so long to find you,” came a soft, female voice along with the touch of cool, soft hands on his skin. Tony abruptly stiffened, the pretense of the game falling away and the fear suddenly very real as he tried to straighten and kick away from the touch.
Steve stumbled into the shitty abandoned apartment, dropping his bag and nearly crashing into Tony in his hurry to kiss him, to hold Tony’s face with both hands hard enough to leave reddened fingerprints on his cheeks. Tony pulled him in almost frantically. Fuck, they could have died so many different ways getting here.
“I’m here, sweetheart. It’s gonna be all right. You’re gonna be fine. You just take your time and rest, and I’ll be right here when you wake up,” Steve murmured just for Tony. “I love you so much, darling. You’re gonna be all right.” Steve pressed a gentle, lingering kiss to Tony’s forehead, cupping his cheek, completely indifferent to their friends who surely watched them with appraising eyes from the med bay window.
“Green, yellow, red, finger snaps if my mouth is full,” Tony said, licking his lower lip, then smirking at the way Steve’s gaze dropped to his lips.
Tony whimpered, struggling, until Steve started yanking at his tie, and it suddenly dawned on Tony why Steve opted to wear the long tie tonight and not the bow tie that Tony had laid out for him. Within seconds, Steve had Tony’s arms pinned behind his back and tied tightly with the necktie, enough so that Tony couldn’t get out of them if he tried. As Steve’s hands left him, Tony took the opportunity to try to slip away, but Steve tripped him and Tony fell hard, really hard, painfully hard, on the stone floor. He cried out sharply.
He laughed softly at the ridiculous gag order that the justice of the peace had to sign before he could marry them, to keep it out of the public eye. He talked about the vacation they had coming up in the Alps in a few months, and promised Tony he would be all better by then and could at least go sledding, if not skiing. He promised he’d even let Tony sled in his shield, if only to get a little ghost of a smile on Tony’s lips.
Steve shifted above him and Tony couldn’t see, and then fire burned through him and his whole body arced as though electrocuted, as Steve plunged his cock fully into him, after hardly any prep and with only a bit of spit. Tony absolutely howled, his voice beginning to break. Jesus fuck, it was- this was
“Tony! God, wake up! C’mon, you gotta- gotta-“ Steve shouted, trying to check Tony’s pulse, until he was dragged away forcibly by several paramedics who obviously struggled against Steve’s strength and stubborn determination not to leave Tony’s side.
“No, this is your computer. I built it. From scratch. For you. Because I wanted to, okay? You don’t owe me anything and since I built it, I couldn’t even tell you the price. C’mon, look! Look at it!” Tony took the laptop and set it on the table, opening it up to show off the features. Steve just stood there in shock.
“I want you to feel every inch of my cock, but I won’t hesitate to knock you out and fuck you unconscious if you don’t stop it,” Steve said, and Tony kicked, his toes just barely touching the ground. Steve spit in his face the way Tony had done, dropped him, and grabbed his ankle again, and dragged him to the elevator as Tony thrashed and shouted for help. On the short ride down, Steve filled Tony’s throat with cock, holding him there once again until the doors opened, and dragged him out by the hair and a subtle helping hand under the arm since Tony was light-headed and unsteady as he sucked in air.
“I’m going to fucking kill him. Tony, I knew something was up, I fucking knew it, but I never thought he was like
“And you’re still ok with physical stuff? Slapping? Shoving? You can say no,” Steve said, and Tony shook his head.
Before they left, Steve had Tony pinned, hidden behind an artfully draped curtain and a few large potted plants, slammed against the wall with one hand around Tony’s throat and the other over his mouth to keep him from moaning, as Steve scolded him in a dangerous hiss about how embarrassed he was by Tony’s constant flirting with everyone, and how he needed to get his ass to the car now because Steve was tired of his shit. Tony gripped Steve’s wrist with both hands and could have cum right there in his tux pants, his eyes fluttering and face heating at the thrilling risk of being caught or heard, but they were far enough away from the crowd that they could have their play. Either way, Tony couldn’t mumble his red-faced apologies to their friends fast enough, making a hasty exit with Steve on his heels, the two of them laughing in high, thready, adrenaline-laced tones as they dragged each other in turns to the car.
As soon as Tony was settled, the nurse let their friends in, and they spilled into the room in a jumble of flower arrangements and balloons.
“Nothing,” Steve said hastily, but with a happy grin, stuffing his notebook into his worn backpack as Tony flopped down on the couch very close beside him, putting his arm around Steve’s shoulder, then looking into the distance in front of them and gesturing his hand as though painting a vista with words.
“Captain, you can come back in,” the nurse said, poking his head into the waiting area. Steve Stood so fast he almost knocked Sam on his ass, and muttered an apology as he rushed back into the ICU, the others trailing behind him to watch from the window. Steve nearly bowled over a nurse and at least two equipment carts to make it to Tony’s side, only to find him unchanged. He bent and kissed his forehead again.
Tony chuckles. “I would never. Last time I seduced someone, she put me in my place” he teases back, and grins when he hears Pepper laughing too.
And to feel Steve’s coarse tongue on himself made Tony quiver, made him understand that this was the touch he had been yearning for for so long, this was how much he needed someone to take care of him but again- not just someone, but
“I love you”, Steve words out Tony’s thoughts too, before offering his own hand to him, so that Tony can tie the bracelet on his wrist.
He moans without any care when their hips crush against each other, and another whimper leaves his mouth when Steve grabs his ass.
Ruffling her hair one last time, Tony gets up and finishes dressing up. He chose a white shirt, not wanting to push things too much. He’s already feeling kinda nervous. This is finally a proper date, and he knows it’s going to define things between him and Steve. He really doesn’t want to fuck things up.
The flirty tone seems to have quite an effect on Steve, since his neck and ears flush with it, and his eyes widen. Tony is already wondering if he might apology for his boldness, when Steve goes to pick up a ball too, and subtly leans into Tony’s ear. “I’d rather top
understand what is that I’m doing!”, this time Tony raised his voice, getting closer to Steve and actually looking like he couldn’t get what he was getting wrong.
“Cap’?! Hey! You listenin’?” Steve came back to his senses and tried to shake off the expression of amusement he must have had on his face.
Steve chuckles back, then smiles widely. “I highly appreciate the compliment” he replies. “But I have the feeling you’ve drunk a little too much, maybe we should go.”
Steve nods firmly. “Yes, you’re right” he repeats. “It’s going to happen, maybe, and I’m glad you’re okay with it” he confesses. She’s always going to come before anyone else.
“I would love to see these jewels, one day” Tony says, and it strikes his own self that he’s already talking about some future day with a man he met that very day.
Steve turns to look at himself in the mirror. It’s been two minutes and he still hasn’t decided if the shirt should be buttoned up or down. The button up would look too formal, but the button down is maybe too much. After all, this Tony Stark offered to buy him a drink, maybe he just wants to be friends, that’s not necessarily a date.
Steve bursts out laughing, shaking his head at Tony’s praise. “I can’t believe you” he reproaches fondly.
And still, it’s not like this kinda friendly date is so important, but it’s the first time Steve is going out since his wife passed away, and Mary is well aware of that.
“Just a second, sweetheart” Steve warns, leaving a kiss on the top of Tony’s head. Then he reaches for his back pocket and pulls out a folded paper.
“What I’m trying to say is that- it’s okay if it seems too much sometimes. If you can’t handle the whole situation, and if you just feel like giving up and -uh- crying.”
Hearing it loud and clear suddenly frees his chest from a very heavy weight, and Steve lets out an exhale, smiling too. “Thank you” he murmurs.
Then it happens quietly, slowly, a soft touch on his shivering hands that tries to still them; a repetitive dirge that is aiming at calming him down.
“Tony!” Mary screams circling the man’s back with her arms and legs, like a little monkey. The fact that his own daughter is comfortable with messing around with Tony makes Steve’s chest clench with another wave of happiness.
And because of this he had done the only thing he thought he was able to do: he had got up from bed and gone downstairs in his workshop, thinking that only by tiring himself out he would be able to sleep, but that didn't work. He had stayed up the whole night, fixing and working on some engines and tubes that didn't need a maintenance in the slightest way. And just when he the sun was starting to set once again, and light rays of sunshine made their appearance in the darkness of the workshop, Tony had finally been able to rest and fall asleep in the total brightness of the room.
Sun was shining in a hurtful way that morning, as the old and slightly limping man was pacing his way along the flowering avenue.
“What is it?” Steve asks curiously. He looks at him with a smirk, already joining Tony’s laughter even though he doesn’t know what Tony is thinking about.
“It’s my fault”, he pledged, tears streaming down his cheeks, his voice cracking not just because of his age but because of the guilt which had weighed on his shoulders for so many years.
“She’s a very smart kid, she’ll never doubt her mother loved her” Tony reassures, and he reaches for Steve’s hand on the table. Steve accepts the touch with relief.
Perhaps his heart starts to beat at a normal pace again, but he’s not so sure, because at the moment he doesn’t even know if there actually
Every morning waking up seemed the hardest task he had ever undergone: he would have gladly fought alien invasions again and again if it meant he could get up in the morning without feeling paralysed by sorrow.
The little girl sticks her tongue out and Steve rolls his eyes. He doesn’t want to give her something to complain about. This is a vacation for the two of them only, and the last thing he wants is for Mary to think he’s ignoring her. But he cannot deny the man he met a couple of hours before is still floating in his thoughts.
his heart aching in his chest with love for Steve. A deep, honest and pure love that consumes him at every moment of the day: that makes him longing for Steve when they are not together, and makes him really think it can rip off his lungs with his beats when they are kissing or even just holding hands.
Those words kept echoing in his head while he was trying to process the brutality of the reality, the
fight me on this, you will lose,” he said with careful threat, and glared the paramedic down as he slowly removed the man’s hand from his chest, pushing him to the side as if daring him to argue. Steve had no shame about playing the Captain America card, if it meant staying by Tony’s side, and he settled himself like an immovable boulder on the narrow bench beside Tony’s gurney, tightly holding his distressingly cool hand.
“Imagine this. An ordinary Thursday. You’ve given me your computer to fix, and as you take your seat at the table where your paintings hang on the wall, I put your perfectly functioning laptop in front of you with a sugar bomb espresso. You are now free to write your Great American Novel and not ever let me read a word of it,” Tony said, his tone almost breathless as though he could imagine such a scene into existence. Steve leaned into him, laughing and breathing in the scent of coffee and aftershave, and enjoying the warmth and weight of Tony’s arms around his shoulders.
“All right. But just- just promise me you won’t go snooping around,” Steve said vaguely, looking up at Tony with big, blue puppy dog eyes of his own, and the tiniest smirk played on the corner of his lips when Tony looked like he fell right off the edge of a cliff and into Steve’s eyes.
Tony. His life would be over without Tony. He wasn’t just playing up the husbands thing. And how could he tell his friends now, when he and Tony had hidden it for so long? He wilted further in on himself, letting out a soft, pathetic noise.
“Uh-huh,” Tony said clearly amused, then tapped Steve’s horrible excuse of a laptop with a revolted expression. “Jesus fucking Christ, is that your computer? That you actually type on? Oh my god, just looking at it is giving me chest pains.”
“While I’m out of town this week. Don’t touch yourself,” Steve repeated, stepping closer so that Tony could feel the heat of his body, even through the gabardine wool of their fine suits. “I want you all to myself. All of you,” he whispered, and something in Tony shivered and bloomed.
The door swung closed, and Steve stood weakly in the ER waiting area, just staring at the door with a hand-shaped blood print on his shirt and Tony’s blood covering his hands, until someone touched his shoulder gently turned him.
“Right. Um. You just, uh… bring it by tomorrow and I’ll get it fixed right up,” Tony said, his tone a little dazed. This time, Steve turned his hand under Tony’s so he could hold hands with him, however hesitantly. Tony stared at their hands, while Steve stared at Tony.
After a dazed moment, he opened his screen again, but this time, he typed furiously, the ideas coming to him like an avalanche. And every time he stole a glance at Tony, Tony just happened to be looking at him, and grinned at him every time.
he shouted, and gave Tony a mighty backhand across the face, sending him sprawling. Oh god. Oh fuck, that hurt good. Tony laid there a moment, dazed, even though in reality Steve really hadn’t used his true strength on Tony. That didn’t fool his body though. Tony tried to stand in earnest, and got about two steps away when Steve had him pinned against the window, and Tony could see his reflection in the glass, and see that his nose was bleeding. Steve had his arm around Tony’s throat, pressing on his windpipe.
“You’re a little fireball. I like it. I bet you get in alley fights all the time, with that attitude. So really, what are you writing?” Tony said, turning the seat across from Steve and straddling it, setting another frothy drink in front of Steve.
“Luuh- I lo-oove you, too,” Tony slurred, obviously struggling to stay focused between the sedatives and the concussion. He smiled so slightly, and Steve beamed at him, damning tears streaming again. He bent and kissed Tony fully on the mouth, his cheeks red and heart soaring when Tony kissed him back, however weakly, raising his hand shakily to touch Steve’s cheek.
“Thanks a lot, Tone. Now quit sitting around on your ass and do your damned job,” he said with a smirk, making Tony bark a laugh.
Steve glanced up sideways, hoping to spend a few moments staring at the unfairly gorgeous barista who made him his black coffee every day, and made fun of him good-naturedly when Steve loaded it with as much cream and sugar as the cup would hold.
“All right, all right, I can take a hint. You do your thing, pal. Just let me know if you want another drink. On the house,” he said with a winning grin. Steve smiled a dopey little grin completely not on purpose, that left him wondering for a split second why Tony chuckled to himself as he walked away. Steve could have slapped himself when he caught his reflection in his computer screen when he opened his laptop back up.
“Shut up, I love you too,” he mumbled, and when they parted, Steve’s eyes were dark, his expression growing darker. He was slipping into the role as easily as he slipped into being Captain America, and the power and threat that rolled off him stole a few of Tony’s heartbeats.
Sam waited patiently as Steve cleaned the blood off, rinsed his mouth, and washed his face. And when he returned to see that Rhodey had joined them, he was grateful that the others didn’t comment on his red eyes. Instead, his friends lingered comfortingly close to him, all of them fretting in their own ways. Steve sat rigid in the chair with his face in his hands, while they waited for Tony to come out of surgery.
“Forgive my sins, for I have come undone…” Steve growled in the most salacious tone Tony had ever heard, and Tony’s reply was lost to a soft moan that was swallowed up by Steve’s kisses.
Of course, it wasn’t like he’d hung a lifetime of imagination on anything like a rape fantasy. And he sure as hell never expected Steve to go for it. But one night they were watching porn together and getting a little frisky, and a consensual rape fantasy came on, and Steve went very still as he watched, his eyes wide as he licked his lower lip. Tony realized as he listened to the helpless cries of the “victim” and watched Steve’s unexpectedly visceral and enthusiastic reaction, that wow, okay, maybe that got him a little (a lot) hot, too.
Tony drifted in and out of sleep the whole time, never speaking, but squeezing Steve’s hand when he was coherent enough to do so. Steve glanced up now and then, and there was always at least one of their friends watching through the window, concerned, but quick to flash a thumbs up and a smile when Steve caught their eye.
Steve was so proud of Tony (always so proud), and sat in the front row smiling up at him, while the press around him hung on Tony’s every word and laughed at his flirtatious banter. Tony was at ease in his bespoke suit of dove gabardine, casually leaning one elbow against the podium as he explained how the corps of engineers would be able to implement clean energy in disadvantaged areas so people could have continual water filtration and emissions-free heat, while sustainably rebuilding their communities. It really was a brilliant system, and could change the world as they knew it for the better.
“I promise I’ll make it up to you, my love,” Steve whispered, then released Tony and stepped back. Tony blinked, his eyes refocusing, his bones liquid and unsteady, his skin electric. It was a fervent promise and a delightsome threat, and Steve’s steady gaze only ignited him further.
“As you wish, Mon Capitan,” he said cheerfully, heading back to the counter without taking Steve’s 73 cents.
“It was just a nosebleed. I told him I wanted to be slapped around. He didn’t even use his real strength.
Tony always had more than one kind of armor. One was a gold-titanium suit, and the other was a bespoke gabardine three-piece with sunglasses that matched the tint of his tie, and a dazzling smile that enchanted reporters so much that they never quite noticed that it didn’t meet his eyes. But at their wedding, Tony had stripped away all his armor for Steve.
think that, since neither Steve nor Tony had given the slightest public indication that they were anything more than close friends and teammates. Dr. Cho looked at him skeptically, and Steve leaned in to say a few words that were inaudible to the others, and she finally dropped her hands.
“Steve? We came as soon as we heard, I-“ Natasha paused, taking in the blood all over him and his shell-shocked expression.” Jesus, Steve… Have you heard anything yet?” she said, her face pinched and worried. Steve looked at her blankly for a moment, then shook his head.
“Please,” Steve whispered again, a sugared plea that almost finished them. But Tony didn’t relent; they had minutes, hours, eons, eternity, to finish. To dance with the end was to be immortal, and in this moment, they were like the stars, without end.
“I thought we were staying in the penthouse?” Tony asked, his voice still gravelly and rough. Steve smiled at him.
“Whatcha writing?” Tony asked, grazing his hand down Steve’s arm as he came around the table. Steve shut the beautiful, streamlined laptop and beamed up at Tony.
“Shut up,” Steve said, and started fumbling with Tony’s tux pants, pulling them down over his ass just enough to get a hand down the back, pressing his dry fingers between Tony’s cheeks. “You fucking piece of shit, you’re not even prepped like a good whore. Can’t even take a dick right, can you?”
“So how come last time I got hit on an op, you didn’t pretend to be my husband and hold hands with me and kiss me tenderly and tell me everything would be all right while you cried into your Cheerios?” Sam asked mildly. Natasha slapped him on the arm. Tony squeezed Steve’s hand and Steve jutted his chin defiantly.
“We really gonna do this? You’ve been teasing me for weeks, don’t go letting me down now, Rogers,” Tony said, and Steve squeezed his hand, laughing softly.
“It’s bad, he- he got really hurt, but. Helen says he’ll recover, he’ll- he’ll be fine,” Steve whispered, staring down at Sam’s hand on his forearm. He could feel the collective release of breath, the sagging of relief from his friends, all of them worried about Tony.
“It really doesn’t occur to you that someone might just want to get to know you better, does it?” Tony asked, amused. He got up, finishing his coffee in a gulp. He grinned at Steve. “Don’t you ever just want to spend time with someone you like?”
Steve’s laptop made an abrupt and alarming buzzing sound, then with a horrible, mechanical crunch, and the screen went dark.
“My darling,” Tony said softly. “It seems like the gig is up.” Steve chuckled and went to the bag, bringing the blanket to Tony to wrap him up, then pulled him into his lap.
“We didn’t want to be public yet. Didn’t want to affect the team dynamic. Didn’t want to damage the public perception of the Avengers. We, um-“
“Color?” Steve murmured, his fingers gentle in Tony’s hair after he’d tied Tony’s hands to a cut-out in the I-beam, so his wrists were pulled tightly above his head. Tony sagged, his head falling forward limply, hiccupping.
Steve grinned to himself for a long time as he scribbled furiously in his notebook, getting caught up in quite a few inappropriate illustrations along the way.
The room erupted in screams as the attendees dove for cover while guards tackled the man to the ground. For Steve, the world slowed to a hyper-focused pinpoint. He stared for what seemed like an eternity, then in slow motion he turned to see Tony.
“Steve…” Tony breathed, the word wet and choking, and he clutched at Steve’s shirt with his bloody hand with surprising strength. Steve’s heart raced. Tony’s pupils were two different sizes, unfocused. Concussed.
“C’mon man, let’s get you washed up,” Sam said gently as he pushed open the stall door, and Steve jumped a little, not even having heard him follow him in. Steve got to his feet unsteadily, letting Sam hold him firm with a strong, warm hand on his back. He let warm water run over his hands, watching rivulets tinted with red swirl down the drain. His mind was like static. Too much noise. But not enough to cover the what-ifs that shouted him down.
“You know what? This is an occasion that needs to be commemorated,” he said with a beaming smile, and sat back down, pulling out his phone. “Smile,” he said, leaning in close to Steve to take the picture. Steve indeed smiled, wildly delighted to see them looking so happy together in one photo. Tony snapped the picture and pocketed his phone.
“Oh my god, Tony, I’m here,” Steve mumbled frantically, ripping a piece of fabric off his shirt and pulling Tony’s hand from his throat, putting pressure on the hole that bled with alarming volume. “Jesus Christ! Someone call an ambulance!” he shouted, trying to flatten his forearm over the other two holes, attempting to put pressure on them both, cursing the fact that he didn’t have three hands.
“Yeahh,” he hedged. After all, it wasn’t like he could tell Tony that he was an erotica writer, a noted author of many a thrilling corset ripper and gay tryst. Especially since Tony was his muse, and Steve had written an entire erotic series with Tony at its center (or on his back or his knees or-) well, anyway, Steve wasn’t going to tell. Tony arched a brow.
“Hey, don’t you start taking the blame like you always do when one of us gets hurt,” he said quietly. “This wasn’t your fault. And you know Dr. Cho always gets us patched up good and sturdy. Tony wouldn’t let her touch him if he didn’t trust her completely.” Steve glanced up at Sam, only to be distracted by the TV on the wall, already covering the shooting and playing the footage of Tony being shot and falling off the stage over and over again. Steve felt like he was going to be sick.
“One more time,” Tony said, shifting up to straddle Steve’s hips, and Steve caught his hands, lacing their fingers together.
“You know, I was just thinking about our wedding the other day,” he murmured, letting himself get a little lost in the sweet memory. “You were so beautiful. Your hair was getting a little long, and it made these precious curls in the back. I love when you let it grow out like that. You had those ridiculous sunglasses on, but you took them off for me because I wanted to see your eyes.”
Steve nodded at his hands, then completely unbidden, his face crumpled and he folded in on himself, burying his face in his hands as his shoulders shook silently. They all immediately fussed over him, and Steve hated it, wanted to run back to Tony.
“No! I’m just- fuck-“ Steve panted, staring at the table and raking his fingers through his hair. He finally looked up at Tony (oh God, Tony was sitting across from him. No counter between them, no safe barrier to keep their endless flirting in check. Just. Oh God), giving him a crooked smile and pretending that he wasn’t blushing all the way down to his dick. “Sorry. Just startled. Did I use up all the internet, or something?” he greeted by way of an incredibly lame joke that even made him want to groan. He almost sagged in relief when Tony laughed.
“Don’t even think about trying to bite me. If I feel even a scrape of teeth, I’m gonna fucking knock them out of your skull,” Steve said, and Tony nodded, his eyes already welling up involuntarily just from the grip in his hair and the emotions ripping through him as his body tried to decide if this was real or not. Without preamble, Steve removed his fingers and shoved his thick, unfairly long cock into Tony’s mouth, and holding him rigid by the hair and the jaw, Steve thrust forward hard until Tony’s nose was pressed against Steve’s well-groomed, blond pubic hair.
And Tony was astounded at the level Steve was willing to fall to. The alpha must have known that tony was in heat. He never expected the alpha to be like this. “So you come during my heat, yeah that sounds very believable Steven.”
Steve’s stance changes the second he hears this, he becomes The Solider, and Tony could never understand him. “How can you say that? I have never loved anyone more than I have loved you.”
Steve was aware of the looks he got from the members of the Ton. Envy from the young and unmated omegas, anger from their old mothers, and disgust from their stately fathers. His only friends were Duke Rhodes and Earl Banner. Everyone else generally ignored him, until Tony was standing next to him. Tony's position as one of the most powerful dukes in the kingdom made sure that no one was ever rude to Steve to his face. They needed Tony's business too much to care about his mistress.
“Going to put on the armour to fight the subpar robots of a cheap ass Ironman knockoff.” Tony is really confused here.
Because sure as hell he wasn’t gonna share them with Tony. It had stopped hurting him as much as it did during the early part of their relationship. Steve and his friend started meeting up every week and Tony was still ok with that.
“That position is not good for your injuries.” But Tony has tuned him out. The smell of his sweaty and battle worn alpha is slowly permeating through the room, working as an aphrodisiac and ramping up the already blazing need in his blood.
Steve slowly enters him, but before he can sink completely he moves back out. Tony tries to clench, to keep him in but Steve keeps withdrawing until only his tip is resting at Tony's rim. And then he slowly enters again. He hitches Tony up and HOLY FUCK!
The very thought made Steve’s heart ache in a way that hadn’t happened in years. Not since that fateful day.
Maybe, maybe meeting Steve and getting some answers was enough. Maybe this would be enough to move on. But did he want to move on? Could he really imagine a life without Steve? Weeks, months, years and decades without seeing that face, without feeling those arms wrap around him. Without his kisses. Without Steve deep inside him.
Tony's smile turned into a leer, “I wouldn’t oppose you picking me up right now but you will have to have your way with me.”
Also also this is not the end of jealous Tony. It is just the beginning. Next chapter will have more.
But he also knew that if they entered a relationship again, he would spend their entire lives worried about something like this. Worried that Steve would leave him. That he would shut Tony outside again.
“Will you do me the honour of dancing with me?” He is looking at Steve with big eyes and its clear that he is offering that as a way to escape this situation, and not just to make Tony jealous.
“Tony, please don’t cry. You know I can’t bear it when you cry.” He looks so sad when he says this, fists clenched by his sides.
Why was he surprised? He knew this day would come, hadn’t he? Rich lords married young heiresses and had children with them. They didn’t marry lowly soldiers who slept with them before marriage. They certainly didn’t marry omegas like Steve. Hadn’t he known that Tony would marry someday?
And now he was pregnant with their child. He didn’t really know when it happened. Not that it mattered.
It should be a haven for the omegas but Steve is the odd one out here too. There is no love lost between other omegas and him. They dislike him on principle as he is too tall, too well built, and entirely too different. And he is the only mistress of the man they all wish to snatch.
Coming to a stop near a thicket of trees, Steve got down and tied his horse to one and flopping down under another. He was worried about what he was always worried about whenever he was alone.
“You don’t. It’s a leap of faith Tony. Whatever you choose to do will require courage which you have.”
Then late one night Tony had come to meet him, looking bedraggled and sleep-deprived. He had told Steve that he was afraid for him and wouldn’t be able to live with himself if he let the omega go to war. Steve had relented and stayed. The alpha had arranged for him to test weapons out in the Stark factory. It wasn’t a perfect solution but at least he had something to do.
For as long as they were bonded Steve had grappled with the fact that he might have to give orders that could harm his omega. He only had to remember what it felt to order the portal closed after Tony, a stranger at that point, to know that he would never be able to give an order like that again.
But he knew there was no use. Steve was with Bucky now. He was sure of this in his heart. Bucky wasn't just any ex, he was the one that got away. He broke up with Steve when the alpha was in the army and fighting the war. Steve spent weeks trying to get back together with the omega. But Bucky soon transferred to another unit and Steve took the hint. But he obviously never got over it.
“Well you found out and I blew up on you. I still don’t understand how I could say something like that to you. Except I think it was because I was angry at myself. I think I was so ashamed that I lashed out.”
Steve feels so full and he wishes he could feel like this forever. Tony sets a slow pace and refuses to speed up like he is hell-bent on driving Steve mad. And then just before Tony climaxes, Steve hears a whispered word.
Here comes the other point that caused all this mess. “Do you really think I am needy and clingy?” Tony had obsessed over this so much. He couldn’t get it out of his head that the reason for Steve’s departure was that Tony was too much. Demanded too much of his time and energy.
He’s out on the field when he hears footsteps behind him. But he doesn’t care about that. He sees his lab and Bruce waving to him madly. He hastens his steps and he’s through. He hears the portal close and his heart feels heavy for it.
Steve immediately had doubts. Natasha turned to him with her supernatural ability and said, “I know you have doubts. Please wait until I am done.” So Steve smartly shut his mouth.
“NO.” Steve roared and came to kneel in front of Tony, “you are. You are the love of my life. Yes, I loved him once upon a time; I will not insult both of us by pretending otherwise. But you, Tony, are the love of my life. There will be no one after you. I will never recover from our love. I don’t want to.” He looked so sincere that Tony wanted to believe him. “It’s funny how you could be making the worst mistake of your life and not notice it. Not recognize the impact of that single decision.”
Which is why it was such a huge shock to learn that Steve had been off meeting some other omega in secret. And then the words he used against Tony when he brought it up like he was the one who was in the wrong. Like he didn’t have the right to ask about things. He couldn’t help but question the depth of Steve’s love. Oh, he knew Steve liked him well enough. But if he ran to his old omega then maybe Tony was just a stop gap. Not perfect but would work right now.
Soon the day of their shift to London came. Their luggage was loaded in different carriages. They couldn’t live together in London. The gossip would be too much, even for someone with Tony's reputation. They embraced one last time and climbed into their respective carriages.
After about half an hour of war talk, Tony pipes up and asks Steve to dance with him and he gladly accepts. Tony leads them to the dance floor and soon they are swaying to the tune and Tony is making Steve laugh by telling him the latest on dits. But that soon devolves into filthy whisperings of what he will do to Steve once they get home. Steve is sure that he is bright red and that everyone knows what they are talking about.
He picks up the dildo again and slowly starts to fuck himself on it, desperately wishing for a warm cock instead.
The idea of his omega, swollen with his child, sitting on the bed, wet and wanting, begging for his cock; it was the only thing that he could think of. Suddenly Tony started to stir beneath him. Smiling, Steve pulled out and turned him over onto his back. The omega was still groggy from sleep and was blinking adorably at the scene. Steve wrenched Tony's legs apart, supporting them on his arms, before entering him again.
He doesn’t know at what time Bucky will arrive, just that he will. He will then mingle a little before heading over to talk to Tony. And since people always come to talk to Tony or Lord Rhodes, it won’t be considered odd.
After that Steve gathered him in his arms they both silently sobbed. Steve picked Tony up and walked over to the couch and put him in his lap, where he spent hours just scenting him stroking him.
He isn’t in the best mental condition and this fact just pushes him over the ledge and he starts sobbing his heart out. The lust recedes which is good because right now even the idea of it is too much to bear.
But what would happen to him now? Would Tony throw him away? Probably give him a small pension to live off of. Or would he expect Steve to continue being his mistress? Plenty of men in the Ton had marriages that were business transactions and kept mistresses on the side. Would Tony make him his dirty little secret?
He wished he was back at war. Right now, defeating Napoleon’s army seemed easier than dealing with this turmoil within him. It was obvious that Tony didn’t love him. Hadn't ever loved him. Why would he? Steve didn’t have a title or money; he was just the son of a farmer who decided that war was his calling.
Two days before the window opened his watch started to beep madly. That was the signal. He stared at it for a second and then took off at a mad dash.
Usually, his method of mending a broken heart meant an engineering binge that culminated in a truly inspiring piece of technology. He could still recall, with pride if he might add, the epic binge after Sunset Bain left with some of his plans for future products; he came up with a new line of Stark Prosthetics
He put on a robe and stumbled his way to the door, sure that the doorman will not let just anyone enter.
Days where he felt like he should just cut his losses and move to California, start anew. But the searing pain that gripped his heart at the very thought of never seeing Steve again was enough to quell those thoughts.
So Tony looks him directly in the eye and says, “Steve I needs you in me. Please, I feel so empty like this.” He isn’t even lying. He misses the slide of skin on skin, the taste of Steve on his tongue, and the way the alpha's eyes twinkled as he said the filthiest things Tony had ever heard.
Another night and he couldn't stand the empty apartment. Maybe he should sell it. But then he would lose what little he had of Steve and he wasn’t ready for that yet, not by a long shot.
After that, Steve wasn’t even sure why Tony forgave him. He couldn’t believe that he had hurt his omega like that.
Tony was still not fully awake but was getting there. He looked at Steve and his pupils were blown so much that there was barely any of that warm brown left. Overwhelmed with lust and love Steve leaned in, bending the omega in half, and kissed Tony within an inch of his life.
Tony is now in the middle of the bed, with his ass in the air and if he isn’t filled with alpha cock in the next few seconds, he is sure he will start crying. His body feel s overheated and he just wants something inside him.
He left Stark Tower a mess. He somehow got back to his new flat and the contrast between this place and his home was staggering. It looked like no one lived there. It wasn’t the bare walls or the silence that bugged him; it was the clear lack of Tony. When he lived with Tony, Steve could find proof of his existence everywhere around him. The coffee pots and Starkpads in each room, and screwdrivers everywhere.
Suddenly Steve is on him and they are kissing fiercely. The alpha picks him up and Tony wraps his legs around Steve’s waist, he is able to feel that thick bulge. He whimpers and that makes Steve deepens the kiss. He’s grinding his cock on Steve’s and he feels him loosen up, getting ready to take an alpha’s knot.
He didn’t know if saying it was the right decision or not but that didn’t stop him from whispering, “Never.”
They both are giggling so much they don’t notice a pair of tawny eyes stare daggers into their backs.
Walking back to his own suite, which adjoined Tony's, he rang for his maid. After getting ready and eating breakfast, Steve set out for the stables. Getting the groomsman to ready his horse, he decided to take a round of Tony’s estate. Stratfield Saye House was a stately building with a large lake, multiple gardens, and a huge forest attached to it. Riding through it always left Steve in awe of the wonder and beauty of it.
Steve was only a man. And he did whatever any sane man was wont to do in this situation; he fucked Tony, every night, even if the other man was asleep. And he was amazed to realize that Tony was made to be fucked. It was incredible how easily his omega opened up for him like he was created just to take Steve's cock, deep within. Tony barely twitched and never woke up. It was something that Steve was unable to fully comprehend. Tony looked so vulnerable in his sleep. So easily breakable.
That also meant that no one could ever complain about any other rules of etiquette they broke; namely dancing more than two dances with the same partner despite the gossip of them committing public indecency. If they thought that was indecent, then the Ton en masse would clutch their pearls and faint at their behaviour in the bedroom. Steve loved dancing, and they danced as long as he wished. He loved it when Tony whispered in his ears, making him giggle and blush in turns.
The sensations he is feeling right now are becoming too much for him but Steve is relentless, licking into him, and the sensation of that strong powerful tongue on his soft insides.
The slow roll of hips and Steve's refusal to completely fill Tony is slowly wearing on his nerves. He groans and begs, but Steve is adamant. There will be no pounding, no rough movements and no vigorous bouts of animal sex.
Tell me why I shouldn’t just go out and get another alpha. Someone who’ll love me better. Someone who will treat me like I deserve. I could be someone’s first choice.” Tony hugs himself tighter, wishing to protect himself, and moving away from Steve.
He met Tony Stark at a ball thrown by Lady Kenilworth. He was invited because being the ‘hero’ who saved Lord Rhodes in a battle against the French despite being ‘only’ an omega made him something of a curiosity.
And that the real reason why Tony is so sad, Steve always promised that he would fight for their love but obviously not.
Steve knew he had fucked up. This whole thing was his fault. This one secret and his attempts to justify them had wrecked the best thing in his life.
“It matters because I love you, it matters because I am sorry, it matter because I wanna come home.” Steve is crying now, what a pair they make.
“You could have hurt yourself. We had it handled.” Steve was red in the face but his eyes belied the worry and concern he had for Tony. Tony appreciated it but he also knew that their duty came first. They were not free to do as they wished when innocent lives were on the line.
All through this time he keeps accosting Steve, who finds it harder and harder to ignore him.  At first it is surprisingly easy for Steve to do this; he simply got up and left. But Tony is nothing if not wily and he refuses to lose this war. Once he got as far as half naked with his alpha’s thick fingers in him, satiating the need that is burning him from inside out. It was glorious, he was lying on top of Steve, pants off and shirt unbuttoned, rubbing his erection on Steve’s clothed one, while being finger fucked to oblivion. He was very wet, and the smooth glide of Steve’s fingers was maddening. He lips battled with Steve, nipping and licking, the taste intoxicating him.
He wanted to gag. His stomach felt sick. The thought of those beautiful hands with its calluses caressing someone else, those fingers entwined with someone else's, those lips kissing someone other than Steve. He couldn’t breathe. Running to his suite, Steve flung himself on his bed.
Steve is used to it. Dare he say he enjoys it? He knows the reason for the hate. In the mind of the Ton Tony is his and so they hate Steve.  Feels no need to be loved or liked by people who have no respect for him and yet right now he longs for some company, some friendship, some understanding of what it’s like to want Tony but never being able to attain him.
Tony was nervous, jittery. He couldn’t sit still and he felt he was too keyed up for this conversation.
Could he forgive and forget? Was it possible? Tony had been betrayed many times in his life, by his friends and his lovers. He had become wary of any new people in his life; sure that he was a terrible judge of character. But Steve was different. He had barrelled into Tony's life and had refused to leave. Stubborn as an ox, Steve decided that he loved Tony and that was that. Basically, Tony had never expected that someone would love him like that.
“Answer truthfully, alright? Did you touch him?” Tony's stomach was churning at the very thought and he would wonder about this for the rest of his life if he didn’t get an answer.
“But how do I know if I am doing the right thing.” He knew he was whining but given the circumstance, he thought he got a pass.
Tony was sacred, so scared that Steve was out there cheating on him. He was scared shitless. If Tony didn’t get a reply from Steve immediately or if Steve didn’t answer his calls, Tony's mind went straight to cheating. He would torture himself with the images of Steve fucking Bucky.
He had loved learning to dance too. Tony had hired a dance instructor to teach him, a strict man with a handlebar moustache and absolutely no sense of humour. He had tried to teach Steve but being the big lumbering omega he was, he continually stepped on the instructor’s toes. And being the stubborn soldier that he was also meant that he made no effort to follow any instructions. In the end, Tony had to dismiss the dance master and take over the duty himself.
Steve carried their lunch outside to Tony’s ‘shed’, a room where he experimented on some of the automatons and weapons for his business. How that man was still alive was a mystery to him. Tony forgot to sleep, eat, or even go outside for days. Steve was appalled at this and had started a mission to feed Tony regularly. It was mostly a success, with Tony scarfing down whatever was put in front of him when he was working. Making Tony sleep was trickier, that was until Steve figured out that if he went to bed after kissing Tony then he would come sniffing in an hour. He was Tony’s mistress and his bed was open whenever the alpha wanted.
And then his lips are captured in a brutal kiss, Tony snakes his hand into his hair and yanks Steve’s head back. He kisses a languorous path down to his neck and sucks a bruise there, high where it would be visible no matter how much Steve tries to hide it.
Steve can feel the colour drain from his face and he feels nauseous. He didn’t know he would have to see this interloper so soon. He turns to see Tony's face and his face is blank. There are no expressions there. Then he moves to Lord Rhodes and he looks uncomfortable with the entire situation.
He starts small. Licking of a spoon seductively here, bending to retrieve a dropped screwdriver there. He schools his expressions, so that his master strategist doesn’t figure out his plan. When he gets no results, except lust blown eyes and soft touches, he ramps it up. He starts to cuddle with Bruce, which isn’t normally a problem for Steve. Except he is two days away from his heat. He knows that Steve is bothered by smelling Bruce on him. It is very obvious from the growling he directs at the man, and the scenting that follows after.
Turns out Steve hated being a ‘minor lord’ as he termed himself. “My brother, God bless his soul, was supposed to do all this while I went out to war.” He said one day after too much whiskey and too little sleep, “but he died and left me all this,” throwing his arms out to gesture around, “and now I farm and trade. But I don’t fight while thousands die.”
Steve’s face crumpled when he heard this and his voice sounded choked when he said, “Tony, baby I am so sorry I came, I just missed you.”
When he felt he had taken in his fill, he took out his cock, and dragged it over Tony's leaking hole, getting it wet and sloppy. Then in one swift move, he sank down to his balls, moaning at the warm tight feeling. Even in his sleep, his omega was clenching around him, sucking him in deep and trying to keep him there. He started to pump in and out, his pants and the wet squelching the only sounds in the room.
While Tony could tell that Steve wanted to go all in, he ensured that he followed whatever schedule the omega set for them. They started small, weekly coffee dates. It was extremely awkward at first. Not because they didn’t know each other or didn’t know the appropriate behaviour. It was awkward because when two people love each other deeply and completely, it is hard for them to suppress it. it is hard for them to pretend. Hard for them to not exhibit their feelings.
When he first started this Steve used a washcloth to clean Tony up. But after a little while, he started enjoying his come flowing out of Tony's abused and puffy hole. He didn’t want to clean it up. His seed belonged inside Tony. He decided to taste his omega first. The clear proof that he was ready to take Steve's cock, even in his sleep, made the alpha go weak in the knees with desire. He licked a broad stripe and moaning at the taste. He kneaded Tony's plump behind and spread him so that he could dive deeper. Tony's nectar was divine and Steve wanted every drop. He kept on licking inside. Tony wouldn’t wake up and anyway this act was not for his pleasure, it is for Steve’s.
Steve suddenly walks towards him and gets down on his knees in front of Tony. And Tony is so surprised by this that he lets Steve hold his hips while he leans his head on Tony stomach.
They have shared laughter and dances. They have spent hours under the stars, just talking. Tony has seen Steve at his weakest, sobbing due to the nightmares that have plagued him since the war. Steve has comforted Tony when the man felt burdened by the weight of his name and position. Tony has been inside him, so deep Steve wished he’d stay. If all this wasn’t enough for Tony to love him then the alpha never will. It hurts, this knowledge, the fact that Tony likes him but doesn’t care for him.
Tony realized he was crying too. Steve’s explanation made sense. He could see how Steve would want to protect him from this knowledge, and it’s not like he hasn’t said some regrettable things when fighting with Steve or anyone else for that matter. But one fact remains.
Tony loves it and always tries to turn it into something more. But he has to stop when Bruce tells him in no uncertain terms that he does not want to be a part of Tony's schemes.
Keeping his face straight despite the way his heart was pounding he said, “I have realized that you only do something I wish you would when I pick you up and force you to do it.”
His hole was getting looser, the muscles inside relaxing, and filling with slick. Ready to receive an alpha’s knot. And still no sign of Steve.
You don’t share anything with me, you never tell me anything. Do you know how that feels? All through our relationship, I felt like I was a second thought. I love you but you don’t love me.”
On the last day, he called Rhodey, missing his honey bear more than words could describe. Why were all of his friends so far away? Pepper had left yesterday to go to California for a meeting. Rhodey was deployed. Bruce was in India, finding himself in the hills, Beatles style.
Mind made up he and Bucky continue dancing, talking about the Howling Commandos. Soon Bucky is making him laugh by telling him a story of how they spent an entire day fooling Morita into thinking his bag had a hole by stealing his things.
He writhes in agony, he wanted his alpha, the connection they shared with each other but he had to make do with a dildo. There were times when the tears overpowered the lust and he would just sit in his shower, music blaring at a high volume an accompaniment to his sobbing.
“They think they own everything and that omegas are not equal to them.” Steve hated when he was treated like he was delicate, or worse a delicate
But now Tony had moved on, at least physically, and the thought of it made him nauseous. He didn’t have the stomach to go see Tony; he felt the shame in his burning like a ball of lead in the centre of his chest.
Preparations for the season were taking place and the entire manor was in grips of ecstasy. London, their destination, inspired that in people. And this year the excitement was doubled, soldiers returning meant long-gone relatives and lovers were coming back. Some of Steve's friends would be coming back to him too.
“If I go you’ll leave me. You won’t come back. I left the last time and I was so alone and you slept with other people.” Steve had his head clutched in his hands and was crying. And Tony wanted to comfort him, a primal need to soothe his pains and aches. But right now he needed to think about himself.
“You taste so amazing. I want to keep doing this for hours.” Steve husked out. Tony turns to look at him and feels a swoop in his gut as he is flooded with even more lust. Steve’s mouth is covered in slick and his lips are red. He looks debauched.
“Tony, baby please never think that. I can’t even imagine it. I am yours, only yours. The idea of being with someone else is abhorrent to me. I am yours, till my dying breath.”
With these thoughts swirling in his head, he sees Bucky saunter his way over to them, with a small smile playing on his lips. He looks like a rowdy and overconfident young alpha, someone who believes he can do anything. Steve knows Tony hates alphas like that, having to hear multiple rants about cocky little things.
There were good days and there were bad days. Some days Tony felt like he and Steve would fall back in love in no time. Some days... well some days Tony felt he was a fool for ever letting Steve back in. That feeling had nothing to do with Steve’s actions after they got back together and everything to do with his doubting mind.
They had fought for hours, screaming and shouting. And then Steve called him insecure and needy. That had shut down the conversation fast. Steve had tried apologizing, saying it just came out in the heat of the moment, that he didn’t believe that about him but Tony just couldn't understand how Steve could call him something like that and not believe it in his heart.
Bucky then smiles and says, “Oh how could I forget. I meant you were beaten up by alphas after you tried to fight them.”
Here was a soul who was saving him from all calamities and truthfully he didn’t want to lose this strange something that was between them
Tony stared at him. He was sure that his best friend would tell him to dump Steve and never look back. And he said as much.
“Tony you are on bed rest, you have cracked ribs, and you are in heat. You are sitting this one out.” He sounded firm, like he expected Tony would bow down and follow his order.
“Don’t touch yourself while I’m out of town,” Steve said, coming to Tony to help straighten his tie.
“Since it was legal,” he said softly. Steve returned his adoring gaze, not looking away until Sam pointedly cleared his throat.
The chaos was deafening and terrifying, and suddenly Tony was afraid of anyone else hearing, and tears were on his cheeks again, this time from humiliation and frustration. He kicked his foot out, catching Natasha’s heel.
