Rather than lose himself in useless melancholy, Steve walked over to the table and slid into the seat beside Tony. Slowly, he put a hand on his shoulder, causing Tony to look up.
"I've just been worried, okay," she said. "It's no big deal." Clint's eyebrows raised contrastively.
So far in talking to Tony, Steve had only really noticed one similarity between Tony and his father – the passion and love for inventing and technology. Even though Steve couldn't understand anything he was saying, as Tony explained the Iron Man suit to him, Steve could see the spark of excitement in his eyes and hear the enthusiasm in his voice. It was infectious. Steve found himself smiling alongside Tony. He liked it. He liked it…
"No."
He knocked on the first door he came across. There was no reply and the door was apparently unlocked. Turning the knob, Bruce was met with the sight of a blackened, unused room. Despite that, he figured there had to be a map of the building or a fire evacuation plan in the room somewhere. He felt across the wall for a light switch but found none. Undeterred, he pulled his phone out of his back pocket.
"And you had him arrested?"
"I quit," Natasha clarified. "And I thought you promised Commander Hill that you'd have Captain Rogers back by ten." Tony couldn't help but snort at that.
Seeing as the conversation abruptly died, and the next wave of nausea still hadn't hit him yet, Tony pulled his phone out of his pocket. He had talked to Pepper the day before to reassure her that he was okay, but the last time he had texted her was on Sunday. Pulling her up in his messenger app, he could see that their previous conversation had been about the color of the curtains in the living room. Tony couldn't be sure of how drunk he was when he wrote some of those texts.
"That was a rather pleasant way to wake up." Tony brought a hand up to slowly stroke Steve's cheek.
"But," Tony said with a sigh. "I don't want to relive that night." Pepper nodded.
"Yeah," Tony sighed. "Just want to sleep."
"Not much longer, I don't think," Knežević said.
"Restraining order," she reiterated.
Steve winced at that thought. He still couldn't wrap his mind around that. He had just kissed Peggy five days ago and yet now she was an old woman who had moved on with her life at this point. She founded S.H.I.E.L.D., she married, she had kids… She had moved on, why couldn't he?
"Steve," he said. "You're not a terrible boyfriend. You're probably one of the best I've ever had."
"No," Tony said. "It's the truth."
"I think you're doing it wrong," Carol said as she came up beside Jessica. She rolled up the sleeve of her flight jacket and started tapping the screen of her wrist display. "Here, let me."
Early in the Raël's history, they unlocked the secret to gene editing. This allowed them to shape their race to their own design, unlike any other race in the history of the universe had before. They molded all their offspring in their image of beauty – bronze skin, hairless men and women with manes of gold, shockingly bright brown eyes that seemed to shimmer with every movement, and lithe forms more suited to spend endless days in leisure rather than on the battlefield. Any "undesirable" traits were simply edited out before birth. For the longest time, this suited the Raël just fine, until their luck ran out and they were forced to face the dark side of gene editing.
Carol took a breath. What she was about to say wasn't painful, but it was just stupid, and she really wished she could go back in time and kick her past self's ass for letting things escalate to that point. The painful stuff was in what she had just said, and she needed a moment to recover from it. Letting out the breath, she continued.
"And the fire department," Lara guiltily added.
"That's understandable," she said, putting a hand on her shoulder. "Believe me when I tell you that we're all worried for Tony, too. We wouldn't be here if we weren't."
"Does it even really matter?" Sharpton said. "I didn't even get to kill you, or your little boy toy, or that faggot Stark!"
Well, that is an exaggeration. He got maybe one and a half to two hours of groggy, dreamless sleep, but obviously, the quality of it was not that good, so he might as well have not slept at all. On the upside, though, that meant that he did not have any nightmares. So, there was something good that came out of the ordeal.
"Okay." With one last kiss, the two of them pulled back. Steve spared a glance at their food, which had since gone cold.
"Uh, can you take it out and put it by the elevator for now?" Tony asked. "We'll worry about getting it out of the apartment later. I just want it out of here."
"I'm fine," Tony asserted.
"No," Steve said. "Why would you think that?"
"You can't be serious." Pepper shrugged.
Breaking apart, Tony and Steve walked out from behind the curtain to see three men entering the room. Like the S.H.I.E.L.D. doctors, they were wearing protective suits, only theirs were thicker and bulkier; like they were made to withstand a nuclear apocalypse. Clearly printed on the left breasts of the suits were the letters "CDC."
"What can I get you?" Tony smirked.
"Then what's the problem?" Rhodey asked. Tony sucked in the corner of his mouth.
"Clint?" His heart soared. That was Laura's voice. "Clint, can you hear me? Crap! Wait, don't respond to that! Natasha told me about the ventilator. Don't talk. I'll just assume you're listening."
"Yeah," Lara said. "I ended up having to press much stronger charges."
"Oh," he said. "That one."
"West Hills," Pepper said.
"There's something in your room," Steve said.
Special thanks to mfaerie32, Bookdragon777, jessica19951, and SavageAngel7 on FFN for all the support, and sweet_as_suga and babystark on AO3 as well.
"One chance," Pepper said. "Everyone deserves at least that."
"I swear I wasn't," Natasha said. "I would never…"
"Hey, guys, listen up!" Tony waited for all eyes to be on him. "Team meeting after breakfast! Attendance is mandatory, no ifs, ands, or buts." Natasha was the first to react, raising her eyebrows.
"I told you," Lara said. "They were the pre-flight entertainment. They were a group of children who looked like they were born black but had their skin bleached and forced to preform a song wishing us good tidings on our aviary voyage. You know, sort of like Michael Jackson. Wait, it's not racist that I dreamt that right?"
"Any day of the week," Steve assured. "I just think in this case it's best to just leave it be unless we're provoked. Save us all the heartache."
"Damn shame," he said. "I was hoping I'd be wrong, but this works, too."
"Well, she was dating a guy with the last name Samson the last time I saw her," he said. "It's pretty safe to assume they got married and she changed he name." Lara raised an eyebrow.
"I did it," he announced, sliding the phone across the counter to give back to her.
"I'm still here, though." Tony nodded.
"Tony," he said as he shook Tony's shoulder. "Tony, wake up." Tony's eyes fluttered open and a soft smile appeared on his face.
"That's fine, because I love to be handed things. So, let's trade." Pepper handed Coulson her glass while she took the tablet and gave it to Tony, who still looked slightly annoyed.
"So, you're saying that if I was the one who stayed up all night, you'd actually let me sleep in?" Tony asked.
"You punched him?" Lara nodded in confirmation. "So, you initiated a physical confrontation?" She went as pale as a ghost.
"No," Romanoff said. "I want you to knock it off with the drinking before it becomes a problem."
"I couldn't get through to Hill," she said. "I'll try her again."
"Yes, I'm aware, JARVIS." Tony washed the pill down with a sip of orange juice. "Still, it's worth a shot."
"I'll see you later." She then turned and went to escort Coulson back to the elevator. "Make sure you save some of that champagne for me." That caused Tony's lips to quirk upwards for a second, but not much longer than that. He opened his phone up to the messenger app. He'd been busy all day trying to get the tower up and running. He hadn't had time to check his messages after he texted Steve during brunch. When he finally got a look at his unread messages, though, he was met with heartbreak.
"If it was alive, yes," Tony said. "If it was flour, then we're doubly in the clear."
"I wish I could say you have no taste," Lara said. "But I've seen Steve, so that be an outright lie. You agree with me though, right Pepper? Those workmen were sexy, right?" Pepper fought back a smile as she swallowed down a sip of her drink.
"Oh, yes," she said. "It's lovely to meet you, too, sir, and your name is?"
Speaking of what he had planned, that was another reason why he couldn't recruit the Avengers; they would most certainly try to put a stop to it. He just knew none of them would be able to morally stand for it – no matter how much brainwashing he subjected them to – so they had to be eliminated. That was why he ordered Sharpton to send the virus to Avengers Tower. He wanted them out of the way ASAP.
"Guess we'll find out," he said before moving to look at a screen on the other side of the room.
After a few more minutes of waiting, the blacked-out doors finally opened. Through it stepped an older man wearing a long white robe. He was accompanied by a pair of women. Both were wearing white coveralls with a red stripe running down the center. The man looked Carol up and down, as if he was assessing her. She did him the same courtesy.

"They probably did," Clint admitted. "But I can't really remember now. It was ten years ago."
"Easier said than done," Mrs. Barnes said. "But I guess they're being quiet for now. They might not burst in for a bit." Steve walked over to the threshold of the kitchen. Both Bucky's mom and his mom were sitting at a round table with their backs to him. Before he could get a chance to speak up and get the women's attention, Steve's mother spoke up again.
"How old were you?" Knežević asked.
"They're here," Fury said. "They called it." Steve saw Tony's shoulders slump a little bit before he directed his gaze back down to the ground.
"Hey," he said. "Why not instead of making this about me, why don't we make this about you? After all, you're the one who's been treating me like a stranger."
"It was an accident," he said. "Someone took my phone, started messing with it, and ended up calling her." Natasha frowned.
"Because you wouldn't mean them?" Natasha's tone wasn't accusatory; more curious.
Unwrapping the plastic coverings and pulling off price tags, Carol got the clothes on without much hassle. They fit her well – not too baggy or too tight. She didn't realize until she got to the very bottom of the bag, though, that she had missed one item. Pulling it out and unfolding it, Carol frowned when she saw it was yet another baseball cap with the S.H.I.E.L.D. emblem on it.
Biting down on her lip hard, Lara tried to turn the volume up on her phone again. Unfortunately, the device had already reached its maximum volume and Robin Zander couldn't sing any louder. She thought about screaming just to drown out the sounds that Todd and her boyfriend were making, but she was certain that if she did, they would both come running out with guns drawn, not bothering to put on any clothes. Lara didn't need to see that, nor did she need to risk getting shot again, so she once again feebly tried to knock on the wall.
"Are you okay?" Tony nodded.
"Tony, it's your turn." Tony glanced down at the letters in his tray. All he had were the letters O, T, T, O, I and an extremely cluttered board to work with. If "K-I" was considered a word, maybe…
"Because she's Russian and pissed," Hill responded without missing a beat. Natasha didn't hear any more of the conversation as she shut the door behind her, heading a few feet down the hall to the interrogation room where Sharpton was being held.
"Hello," he heard the man on the other end of the line say. Steve could feel his chest clench. He wasn't sure if that was a good or bad thing.
"Tony, do you understand what's going on with your body right now?" Bruce asked. "You haven't drunk anything in over twenty-four hours now. Considering how much alcohol you in took before, it's only a matter of time before you start suffering from withdrawal symptoms."
"That sounds fine to me, ma'am." Steve nodded and slowly got up, trying to be careful not to disturb Tony. Thankfully, Tony slept on. Though his appearance was still worrying, he looked absolutely content. Steve gave the sleeping man a small smile before following the redheaded woman out into the small sitting area. As soon as the door shut the redheaded woman took a step towards him.
"You can't tell me you didn't strategically plan that to make Stark – and by extension, the company – look bad. For God's sake, the video footage of Stark and Col. Rhodes' fight went viral!" Romanoff took a deep breath.
"Alright, alright," Tony joyfully agreed.
"What, you want me to just sit on my ass while people are hurt downstairs?"
"Only because he doesn't know it," Lara defended. "Besides, I've only got it narrowed down to sixty-four thousand possibilities if I did the math right, so…" Pepper huffed in annoyance.
Happy Fourth of July to everyone in the US and a very happy 100th birthday to everyone's favorite sentinel of liberty, Steve Rogers - AKA Captain America! Do you want to know the best way you can celebrate? It's by not doxxing me, getting off that hire-a-hitman site your on and deleting the TOR browser from your computer completely. Yeah, it's one of THOSE chapters.
"Who?" he asked.
"Thanks," he said. "But for the record, I don't like to be handed things. Why are you doing this, anyway."
"Like we had an unforeseen emergency going on," Romanoff offered.
They had scheduled this training over a week ago. At the time, he was more concerned about giving Lara a refresher on how to treat people in emergencies. He did not think about what that would mean for him.
it is," Lara said. "Err, I'm going to have to work on that, now it sounds like a porno. Not the point though, do you need anything?"
As stated before, every time a piece of armor was removed from his body Tony felt an immense weight come off him. However, that wasn't necessarily a good thing. With each piece that came off, it literally felt like Tony was getting lighter and lighter to the point he had no physical mass. If he got any lighter, he'd get carried off on a breeze and float away. Thankfully, he did have a little bit of encouragement to keep moving forward and not collapse to the ground like he wanted. Steve was waiting for him at the end of the assembly line and as soon as the final piece of armor was off him, Tony practically jumped into his arms.
I also can't write too much right now because I've also realized I haven't taken my meds yet and I feel a bit off. So, yeah, sorry for not writing much of an author's note. Please, feel free to review/comment! It really means a lot.
"Yes." Conroy's eyes squeezed shut for a second and she muttered something about owing someone fifty bucks, but after that moment passed, she held out her hand to him.
The next procedure was the one that scared Steve the most. At first, he thought that it would be just like the thermometer; like what he was used to, just looking a little different. Once the blood pressure cuff was secured around his bicep, the machine it was attached to started filling it up with air. As the cuff got tighter and tighter, Steve started to fear that it would get so tight it would take his arm clean off. He tried as best as he could not show it on his face, but he wished he could reach for his knife and cut the cuff off himself. Eventually, the machine stopped pumping air in and slowly deflated the cuff, much to Steve's relief. Dr. Fox made some comment about his blood pressure is a little higher than he expected, but Steve gave no response as he considered how lucky he was to still have his right arm.
"Are you serious?" She rushed over and leaned over the desk a bit, trying to get a better look at Tony and determine if he was showing any signs of weakness or distress. "Is something wrong? Is the Arc Reactor still working? What…" Tony quickly held up a hand to silence her questions.
"Screw you!" He went into the bedroom, shutting the door behind him.
"Are you alright?" She nodded.
"Come on, Johnny!" The officer continued to try to reason with him. "The only way you're getting out of here alive is if you surrender now! The Bureau is willing to make a deal! You give up your suppliers, you get off with twenty-five to life! Considering what you're facing, that's a pretty good deal!"
designed to terrorist groups for years without you noticing?" Tony was a split second away from saying or doing something he'd regret when Pepper finally broke through.
"Uh," was all Carol could really come out with for a moment. "I told the truth." It was the only defense she had, even if it made Amanda's face twist like she had just had a lemon forced into her mouth.
"If he does, I'll shock him back to life."
"What?"
he told himself.
"You're going to cook for me?" Steve smiled and answered in the affirmative. "Oh, babe, that's so nice." He pulled him in for another hug and Steve laughed.
"It's your job," Lara pointed out.
"It's a six," Bruce said, but even he sounded unsure.
"Yep," Lara said, popping the "p." "I looked up the comments on the original upload, and most people seem to be supportive of you. Although, FYI, most of the views the video got probably came from me replaying it over and over because that was just glorious, and I wish I could have appreciated it properly at the moment."
"Not help," Freeman said. "Just support."
"Because he's joining us for dinner."
"Nope," Tony said, popping the "p." "They just made it more complicated." Lara pushed the phone into his hands.
she told herself.
"What? Can't come up with a better one?" Carol asked.
Back then, it was common for VHS collectors and bored college kids to pass tapes around to their inner circles. Most of it was innocent; cheesy yet hilarious video dating profiles, amateur footage of some poor soul's mishap jumping into a swimming pool, even short films and underground cult classics. A well-known example would be the animated short
"Oh, you don't need to ask," he said. "I'm fine with needles. Go ahead."
"Well, I'm alive," Tony said. "No need to worry about party plans. You can go ahead and cancel the parade." Lara rolled her eyes.
"Oh, God damn it!" Rhodey cursed. "The media's already gotten ahold of this?"
"And what if we don't see anything?" Clint inquired.
"Roger that. Do we have an agent down? Over."
"Wow," Steve's mother commented as she inspected his hand. "She got you good, didn't she?" She flipped his hand around to make sure she had cleaned off all the blood. "Thankfully, I don't think you're going to need stitches. We'll just wrap it up and make sure to keep it clean."
"I get the point," Carol said, holding up a placating hand. "But I still broke all that stuff, I should be held responsible for it."
"You could say that," Tony said. "We had our bumps along the way, but we came together in the end."
"Please," Pepper said as she looked through her purse. "You've stayed this long helping me. It's the least I can do." She pulled out her wallet, produced two twenties, and held them out to her. Reluctantly, Lara took them as she knew she wasn't going to change Pepper's mind. As she stuffed the bills into her pocket, she tried to plan a way to covertly give them back. The best she could think of was to leave it somewhere where Pepper would notice them, but not necessarily connect that it was the money she gave her. That would work if she was in Pepper's office, but unfortunately that wasn't the case.
"Wait," one of the singers said. "Isn't this supposed to be where the birthday party is?" All gazes turned to Lara.
"Do you want to look at him." Bruce looked at Tony and caught on to his apprehensive look. He shook his head.
I think that kind of serves me right for going out so much recently when we're supposed to be on lockdown. I'm starting to get the feeling that once the pandemic has passed, a lot of people are going to get hit with a bunch of minor colds and viruses thanks to not properly socializing for over a year. Oh well, at least I didn't get struck with COVID, right?
You better be ready for the long haul...
"What are you…" Then it came back to Steve like a punch in the face.
"I don't think I can." A pang of sympathy ran through Tony's chest. He would comment on it, but as he said before, Natasha was just too fast. "I get your point, though. We all have weird stories. I'm just concerned that her weird story might be an indicator of something more serious…"
"You've got to be kidding me," he said. "The State of the Union Address? The whole reason we came down here in the first place?"
He hoped the last memory he'd leave his kids with wouldn't be of a kiss on the head each and a promise to come back safe and sound this time. Breaking that promise would sting worse than any of the other promises he'd made and broken in his lifetime.
Thank you to mfaerie32 for the review on FFN! It really means a lot!
"My goodness," Steve said. "What a monster! Someone should lock her up and throw away the key!"
As soon as the words "I'm dying" left Tony's mouth, the room fell into sort of a stunned silence. Pepper seemed like she needed a minute to take in the information. When she finally spoke up her voice had a slight panicked quality to it, but overall, she managed to sound relatively calm.
"Well, I think that's a drastic oversimplification," he said. "But it's along the right track."
Not thinking due to anger overtaking her, she charged into the bedroom with the wadded-up panties in her hand. She only spared the thought to worry about whether her hand would get chlamydia from touching the underwear. Ripping open the door, Dante jumped a bit when Lara stepped into the room.
Happy Guy Fawkes Day!
"Well, you need someone's help," Lara shouted back. "Why not just go ahead and accept mine?"
"You know, I looked into that," Dante said. "The restraining order you had against me expired in 2009. You have no legal right to have me arrested." Lara let out a curse under her breath. That was when Cabe stepped forward.
"No," Bruce said. "Shaking would only happen once the seizure set in. It's just the general absence of alcohol in his system making him do that. Most of the time, there is no warning for a seizure. It just happens. Although some patients have reported certain types of olfactory feedback before experiencing a seizure."
"You sure?" Steve asked. "Because I can go with you if you're not okay." Tony felt his cheeks warm and his lips curve up at the sentiment.
"Just that you better not be late for this board meeting, which is in…" Conroy glanced at her wristwatch and made a sound like that of a seal being eaten alive by a walrus. "Eight minutes, if the time is correct on this thing for once." Tony sure hoped it wasn't. He walked past Conroy and town towards his car. That's when he noticed the lack of strange vehicles in his driveway.
"Short for bisexual," Tony clarified. "It means you're attracted to both boys and girls."
"The charges range from petty theft to several counts of first-degree murder." Tony's veins ran cold.
"I'm going to take that as a 'you're welcome,'" Tony said. "I am welcome to do that again, right?"
"Well," Steve said to Bruce. "this is actually kind of familiar
to do it," Pepper said. "Why don't you hand it off to one of the other Avengers, at least just so they can check for you what's actually inside before you just dismiss it as something you can't handle."
First thing was first, she had to urge herself not to panic. For most people, panicking would mean running around and screaming hysterically; being unhelpful and endangering others. For Lara, it meant putting an end to the problem as fast as possible by any means necessary. Of course, this wasn't always the right course of action and she was aware of that. On Friday, she and Pepper had a conversation about her reaction to Tony being drunk at the gala and after discussing it further with her friend, Todd, and her brother, she decided that it would probably be beneficial for her to take a step back for a moment and pay attention to what she was doing any time that an emergency came up, which considering that she worked for Iron Man would be pretty often. Taking a deep breath, Lara started to break down what she knew in her head.
"What he's got," Tony said as he crossed the room and stepped in front of another monitor. "Is an Acme dynamite kit. It's going to blow up in his face, and I'm going to be there when it does."
"Is this going to turn into one of your inspirational speeches, Cap?" Steve sighed.
"I don't like this," he said. "I hate whoever called this meeting." Those words stirred up a little more anxiety inside of Steve. Everyone else seemed to wave it off, though.
"She's my assistant," Tony clarified. "She's had quite the interesting occupational history."
"Tony Stark," he said. "
After what seemed like an eternity, a woman from the LA County Poison Control Center picked up the phone. Rhodey explained the situation and Tony's symptoms as best he could but did not make it any further than the word "Ketamine" before the woman was cutting him off.
"What are you doing?" he asked. "You're being too loud. People are still asleep."
"Why?" Tony asked. "What are you doing to my door?" In response to his question, there was a small
Eventually, Natasha grew tired of the silence and engaged Steve in conversation. The slight tension in the room was dispelled and from what Tony could tell, the tone was very pleasant. Steve tried to bring him into the conversation a couple of times, but Tony just kept slipping out of it. It was not like he was avoiding anything, though. In truth, he was not really paying attention. He was more focused on finishing his breakfast so he could at least get started on the packet before the rest of the Mötley Crüe showed up.
"I appreciate that," Tony said. "But I'll be fine. I just need to talk to Pepper really quick, then I'll be right up, okay?" Steve nodded.
My attention's being drawn in six directions at once right now. Let's just get on with this before I snap at someone.
"Hi," he said, still a little breathless. "What was that for?" Steve shrugged.
"You don't get to question the winner." Steve shook his head before glancing back at Lara.
"I don't care," he said. "Just carry me." Tony could have sworn he heard Steve laugh a bit before he scooped him up into his arms. It was remarkably easy for Steve to lift him, but Tony shouldn't be surprised since he
"And for what it's worth, I'm happy for you and Leonard, too. I hope you have a wonderful wedding day." Betty's smile grew wider.
Turning around, Tony expected to see Knežević standing there, smirking after having had turned another piece of the armor to stone and preparing to lunge at the Arc Reactor's housing again. Instead, he saw Steve standing between him and Knežević holding up the old replica of his shield that Tony had cannibalized into other projects. (Most notably, using it as a stand for a particle accelerator.)
"What's going on?" he finally asked when it looked like she was done. Smith audibly took a deep breath.
"Steve…" he whispered.
"Half an hour?" Steve questioned. "Where are we going?"
"Trevor's a CPA," Lara pointed out. "I shouldn't be."
"Sure," Natasha said. "We'll go with that."
"Humans," the Other said. "They are not the cowering wretches we were promised. They stand. They are unruly, and therefore cannot be ruled." Thanos stood up, and instantly the Other bowed his head. "To challenge them is to court death."
"I'm fine," Tony assured. "And I'll be even finer once this plane is in the air."
"For now," Natasha said. "Unless anyone thinks we need to add something?" Both Bruce and Clint had no arguments and the room lapsed into silence as they waited for Hill to return.

"Yeah, but you don't have to phrase it like that," Pepper said. "Especially when you have a
"Which are doing fine," Adoniram said. "Better than ever. We don't need the Avengers. Suddenly turning around at this point would probably hurt our recruitment rather than help it. So, try again. Why should we enlist the Avengers into our ranks?"
"Oh God, no," Tony said. "I'd be terrible at the whole international spies/espionage thing. Besides, my face is far too recognizable. I run… Well, I used to run the company my father started. I'm not used to not being able to say that. Pepper does that now."
"Your work with the Tesseract is what drove Loki to it," Thor pointed out. "And his allies. It is a signal to all the realms that the Earth is ready for a higher form of war."
"Your speech," Bruce said. "Slow down. You're talking a little too fast." Lara seemed to huff a little in annoyance but complied.
Charles left the church in a huff. The young lady he'd been chatting up for the past few weeks had invited him to a party that was being thrown that night. Seeing it as a chance to get lucky, he agreed to go, only to find out that this "party" was a church event. He did go inside for a few moments, though. The young woman was indeed very attractive. However, it didn't take long for the church members to – in his view – force their religion upon him, so he stormed out of there. That girl may have been pretty, but she wasn't worth putting up with that malarkey.
"Ever since…" Stark's voice audibly froze. "Ever since… 'The Incident,' my mind's been going non-stop. I keep thinking about what went wrong – what I did wrong – and I keep trying to fix it, and yeah, blaming myself kind of goes along with all of that."
"Oh God," she said. "I don't know where to start."
"Just try to do my best," Clint explained. "Try not to do anything that would let Laura and the kids down, no matter how upset or scared I am. I think of them, and I try to do my best for them. Really, in the end, that is all you can do. If you try to be the better person, there is no reason you can ever feel ashamed of yourself, okay?"
"I can't get Loki out of my head." With those words, Natasha's frown turned into a look of sympathy. Slowly, she lowered herself down so she could sit next to him but refrained from touching him. She didn't want to startle him or make him uncomfortable. "I don't know what it is," Clint continued. "But every free second, I have, my mind just drifts back to when it happened. I can't stand it, so I try to keep myself busy. Back at the nest, it's easy, but here?" Natasha slowly mirrored Clint's position, pulling her legs up to her chest and directing her gaze to her feet.
"But is it what you want?" Tony felt his bottom lip quiver a bit as he squeezed his eyes shut.
scared. For some reason, this just hit me harder than usual. I was afraid that…" Nat swallowed hard as she came to an abrupt stop. Clint's expression softened.
"I think I have a bottle of Peppermint Schnapps at the bar," Tony said. "It's not Listerine, but it tastes enough like it. That's good enough, right?"
"Oswin, think about this rationally," Duran urged. "The police have the resources to protect you both."
"Hey," he said in a soft, gentle voice, the same one he could remember his mom using whenever he was sick. "Come on, you've got to get up."
impossible." The previous mass exoduses were only proof of that. He didn't want to risk losing any more followers. After all, he needed as many people as possible for what he had planned.
"So, S.H.I.E.L.D. fixed your hearing?" Stark asked.
"I'm going to take the jet to DC tonight," she said. "You clearly have homework to do."
"No," Lara said. "The button just makes the elevator stop on the nearest floor and stay there in the event of a fire. If Tony's still wandering around here drunk, it'll stop him from making an escape using the elevator."
"Unfortunately," she said. "I have people going through our backlog of security video right now. We've found a few instances of cameras near different entrances and exits suddenly going offline, but nothing that directly implicates one person other than this."
"Natasha."
"What if he managed to get both of those things off?" Steve asked. He could clearly imagine the look Tony was giving him right now.
"I'm fine, Clint," she said. "Just let me get changed and I'll be right down." She then moved to shut the door, but before it could do so all the way, Clint jammed his foot between it and the door frame, effectively blocking the action.
"Good," he said, feeling a small weight come off him. Although his memories of those two days in D.C. were a bit hazy at best, he did remember that she tried to help him (after hurting him, but still.) Hearing that she was going to be okay gave him one less thing to worry about on a list that was growing with every passing second.
"And that's the truth?" Tony swallowed hard.
"No," the second person from legal spoke up. He was a younger man with freckles covering most of his face. "What's insane is that you're all acting like we can do something about this when we're corporate attorneys." The entire room fell silent. DeMarcus shot the younger attorney a sharp look. "What? I'm just saying what needed to be said." DeMarcus sighed.
"Hey," he started to say. "What's…"
; it's an interesting read if you ever want to look it up."
or whatever it is they call it now? Because not cool guys, not cool!"
Alright, so the board meeting wasn't going well. Ever since it started the board was blaming him for driving stocks down with the botched
Anyways, thank you so much for taking the time to read this chapter! Be sure to review if you did!
Betty was particularly interested in the lipstick stain that sealed the back of the letter. Bruce had to agree it was strange but didn't see it as such a pressing piece of evidence. In his opinion, they should be focusing on determining how and if the viruses could have survived postal irradiation.
"Did you ingest the poison as well?" Jessica shook her head.
"Yes," Steve said. "Why wouldn't it be? I mean, I know I'm just sick and I can't get better. Hell, the serum couldn't even fix this, and it fixed everything else…"
Loki could feel the other touch the side of his head. Seriously, he could
Anyways, if you liked this chapter, you know what to do. I'm just going to look up pictures of teacup pigs doing random mundane tasks to try to cheer myself up.
"You think?" Oswin went quiet and Knežević took a few deep breaths to try and calm down.
Since she couldn't smell gas, Lara figured she was probably safe for right then, though she remained vigilant, just in case. In the meantime, all she could really do was wait for news updates and pick the popcorn she dumped off the floor. For a moment, Lara was actually thankful that her diabetes disallowed her from having butter. Picking greasy popcorn crumbs out of her rug was not her idea of a good time.
Looking through his closet of S.H.I.E.L.D.-provided clothing, Steve picked out the nicest outfit he could find, which ended up being a white button-up shirt and black pants. The pants fit okay enough to where he felt like it wouldn't be noticeable that he wasn't wearing a belt, but the lack of a tie made the outfit feel a little too casual for him. He had no idea what Tony had planned, so he didn't want to be underdressed. Then again, he had no idea how much the style had changed, so maybe it was safe to go without the tie. Was he overthinking this? Probably. Was this still not a date? Definitely.
"Okay, I'll admit, I might have fibbed to the foreman guy about which elevator was the service elevator," she said. "But I don't see how that was a security concern. Besides, you're leaving out a key word there."
Just so everyone's aware, in this universe, the chain of presidents is going to go Obama - Elias (to be compliant with Iron Man 3) - Trump. Most of the reason is that the MCU is rather inconsistent with this. In Iron Man 3 and Captain America: The Winter Soldier it's stated that the fictitious character of President Elias, while Luke Cage and the Runaways supposedly make direct references to President Obama. (I've only seen the first season of Luke Cage and none of the Runaways, so don't take my word a hundred percent, I'm just going off of what I've heard.) If I don't get to the Obama - Elias transition (because I probably won't remember to when I go to adapt Iron Man 3) I'm just going to state right now that instead of Mitt Romney, Obama went against Elias in the 2012 election. Obama lost because the public wasn't entirely impressed with how he responded to the Battle of New York and went with Elias, who took a harder stance. As far as the Elias - Trump transition... I think that's going to be a major theme in the lead up to something else so I'm not going to touch on it. Just remember that's how it's going to go. Obama - Elias - Trump.
Being careful not to hurt or jostle the puppy as he stood up, Clint went to leave the bathroom. He was probably overthinking it. Maybe he'd have a clearer head in the morning.
"I already know that," she said. "And I wasn't going to ask about that until I clarified a few other things."
"You're drunk." Tony rolled his eyes.
"What case against the Hay-Adams Hotel?" Pepper took a calming breath as well, but otherwise didn't hesitate to respond.
"Face powder," Natasha countered. "Foot powder, talcum powder, flour, confectioner's sugar…"
"That's not possible," Tony said. "Rewind the video back two minutes and play it again."
"She told me, 'there's nothing wrong with you,'" Tony said. "'You're not sick, you're not a bad person, and there's certainly nothing wrong with being who you are. Never let anyone change your mind about that.'"
"Yeah. See you in a bit."
"Alright." The elevator chimed, and the doors slid open, allowing Lara to get off. "I guess I'll see you all on Friday, then."
"Hey," Lara said. "I felt
"How so?" Stark asked. Clint shrugged.
"Are you sure?" the AI inquired. "I can…"
That was another good thing about going back to the tower. Tony and Steve could be as affectionate with each other all they like, and no one could say anything about it because it was Tony's building. If they didn't like it, they could leave, or Cabe could throw them out. Feeling a little more secure, knowing that fact, Tony leaned into the touch.
Romanoff dealt with it well. She did not bat an eye at any of the passive aggressive remarks that some of the board members threw at her. Although, she had most certainly heard worse being a spy who had the unfortunate crippling disability of also being female. Still, Tony had to admit that he himself wouldn't be able to deal with some of the things they said without repressing it deeply until he cracked, leading him to try to drown it all under gallons of alcohol, so he could admit he could admire her for that. Now he had two things he liked about her and he could say that he would not have known that one if he had not given her a chance.
At that point, Steve knew he would not be able to beat around the bush anymore. He looked Tony right in the eye as he said, "I'm just scared, okay?" Steve looked away from Tony. A few moments passed before he heard him give any type of reaction.
"Bold of you to assume this is solely about you." Tony frowned.
"I'd like that," she said with a smile. "I've missed you, too."
Steve nodded in agreement as he stabbed a forkful of chicken and pasta. Once he got to eating the food, he found that he liked it. The flavors were not too strong, and the cheesy sauce was already leaving him wanting more. He looked back up at Tony, a slight smile on his face.
"Please," Adoniram said, taking a much tighter hold of Carol's hand than necessary. "Call me Brother Daniel."
"Try me," Tony said. "I mean, I'm my own mess of a basket case, so I'm not sure how much of a help I'd be, but if you want to talk, I'm willing to listen. Just say the magic words."
"Is that why you were crying?" Bruce asked Lara.
One of Steve's eyes opened to look at Tony, but quickly snapped back shut.
Freeman shifted his gaze to Tony, who wasn't going to argue with anything Lara had said. All of it was true. His toes still stung from the frostbite and although he hadn't been too sick so far, he kept expecting his hangover to hit him at full force at any moment. He was in no condition to be locked in a room with countless politicians and the media and be forced to sit pretty and listen to the President give a speech. He was certain of that. At the same time, though, he also acknowledged the position not going would put the Avengers in and was unwilling to argue against that either. Freeman, seemingly realizing that he wasn't going to be getting any help from Tony, turned to address the entire group.
"It's too late," he said, taking both Lara and Tony by surprise. "You guys woke me up before you could even prank me. You were going to prank me, right?"
"Any and all files connected to or associated with SSR Project: Rebirth." Tony fell deathly silent for a moment.
"I think not," he said.
"I know things," Loki said. "Things you would like to know. I can help you achieve unlimited power." Thanos seemingly chuckled at that.
Yeah, remember that domestic violence warning at the beginning? Well, here it is...
"How'd it go?" she asked.
"Shall we play, Doctor?" Tony turned to Bruce and asked.
"Thank fully no," he said. "I don't have to blow anyone up this time."
"Mm," Tony hummed. "I'm good." Then, much like he did on the plane, Tony patted the empty space next to him. "Lie down."
"No… Not sick…" Steve's mother began to wonder if he was a little loopy with a fever, until he said "don't want a needle in my eye…" She instantly went pale and struggled to breathe for a second.
"I might have mentioned something about that, too," Tony said. "I don't know if he heard it or not. He was still out when I said it."
"Mr. Schaffer," Pepper tried to cut in, but Schaffer ignored her.
"I should let you know, though, that Rhodey's coming tomorrow," Tony said.
Tony didn't realize he had no idea where he was supposed to go until he was halfway down the hall. He assumed everyone was waiting in the lobby, so he figured he should head towards there. However, he couldn't quite remember which way led back to the lobby (probably because he was paying more attention to Steve's butt on the way in,) so he got a bit turned around. Once it became clear he had no idea where he was, he decided to stick to the adage of "if you're lost, stay put." He found a spot on the floor and waited for Lara and/or Freeman to come across him.
"Yes," Margot responded. "But they said the matter was urgent." Adoniram sighed.
"JARVIS," he called out. "Put everything we got into the thrusters!"
However, Natasha's response surprised him. She let out a burst of air through her mouth as her face slowly became conflicted. Honestly, he wasn't quite sure what to make of it.
"Why?" he questioned. "I've told him more times than I can count that I forgive him for what happened."
Pepper was the first one to return to the room, none too pleased with having to find out from his former insurance provider that his policy was canceled. It was just as fun as Tony imagined. Technically, it wasn't really a secret, Tony just plain forgot to tell her. It didn't matter, though. Pepper was still angry.
"Back us up, Thor?" Loki glanced over his shoulder to see his brother nod and start to follow them. In his eyes, Loki caught a glimpse of a wide range of emotions. Anger was the leading one, but he could also see glimpses of more heart-wrenching ones – disappointment, shame, despair – and the fact was, Loki couldn't find it in himself to blame Thor. Not because of everything he destroyed or the lives that were taken, he still felt that it was his God-given right to rule over all the Nine Realms.
"Car, please," Tony responded. "The last thing I need right now is the kind of attention an ambulance would bring." Tony had forced himself to sit up. It clearly took him a lot of effort as he swung his legs over to sit on the edge of the bed. Pepper put her hand on his shoulder.
"I'm already in this. Might as well see it through to the end." She patted Jessica's shoulder. "Call Fury. I'll keep an eye on Stark."
"That's funny," he said. "I thought we weren't friends." Steve squeezed his eyes shut. Yes, he probably deserved that.
"They can," Lara agreed. "But you don't get out or do anything for fun?"
"Well, unless the driver of our limousine decides to take a sharp right off of a freeway overpass, I don't see that happening." Tony made sure he said that extra loud so that way their driver could hear him through the privacy shade. Apparently, the driver didn't have the same death wish they had. Tony felt a warm hand slide into his own.
, right?
"Good," she said. "It's nice to know that at least
to you," Tony corrected. "Or, if we want to be factual, Gold-Titanium Alloy Man, but…"
"Either way," she said. "I'd change into something comfortable. It sounds like we're in for a long ride."
"I appreciate your concern," he said. "But really, I'm fine. Just a little headache. No big deal."
Speaking of reality, Steve realized that he should probably snap back to it. He spent enough time mulling over his own anxieties. He needed to figure out what was going on with dinner so that way he could ensure that both he and Tony ate before they went off to bed.
"What's wrong?" Steve asked.
The heavy hitters were the Hollywood tabloid-style talk shows. If they were not looking through Tony's past trying to find any signs, they "missed" that indicated that he was gay, then they were making inappropriate speculations about his personal life and health. They questioned if any of Tony's male friends were secretly his lover. They wondered if the women he had been with before knew, or if he had even been with them at all. Most disgustingly, they hypothesized that since Tony had been having relations men, that had to mean he was HIV positive.
"No, it's true," Tony said. "But it hurt to hear it, right?"
"Alright," Natasha said. "A classic it is."
"Most likely," he confirmed. "JARVIS has eyes on him in the tower right now."
"Thank you, Pepper," he said.
"Speaking." Knežević let out an internal sigh of relief at the confirmation. "Who is this?"
"What do you want me to do?" He expected Tony to sigh in annoyance, but he was pleasantly surprised when instead, he just got right down to business.
"What happened?" he asked.
"Alright," she said. "I'll live you to rest, then." She started moving towards the door and Tony headed back to bed.
"Was?" Tony looked away from him at the question. Steve knew what that meant, but he wasn't exactly processing the information. He was being told that someone he had just spoken to a few days ago had died and had a son. (Well, not in that order, obviously.) One would say he was taking it a little too well, but he also had enough valium in his system to knock out an elephant. He'd probably have some form of emotional reaction later when the drugs wore off, but for right now he was completely numb to it. However, he could see in Tony's reaction that he wasn't completely numb to it, so he said the only thing he probably could. "I'm sorry."
"I'm fine," Tony assured. "I mean, my head hurts, and my throat hurts and the beach is tilting funny, but other than that…"
"Thanks, Betty," Bruce said. "And listen, can I just apologize…"
Two rings…
"What about the stairs?" Steve asked.
hard. Regardless, Loki couldn't help but laugh. He had been expecting this. He knew that Odin would send Thor to collect him like he was a misbehaving child. Granted, he thought Thor would show um much sooner, but better late than never he supposed.
The tour was a little rushed given the fact that they were only allowed to be there so long, but Steve still enjoyed it, nonetheless. Some of the museum's displays showcased events Steve was already aware of, but there were numerous displays that covered the sixty-five years he missed. Everything from the end of World War II and beyond was covered. Well, probably not
"I'm taking the limo."
"Alright," he said. "What should we discuss first?"
Flash!
"You think yourself above them?" Thor asked.
"No comment." Everhart's face soured again. Too bad.
"You're right, I don't," Lara said. "So, how long has this been going on?"
"I guess," he said. "Again, I haven't looked to see exactly what's inside of there. I am just assuming given the timing. It might not be Avengers-related at all."
"I still won't let him fire you." Lara smiled a bit, grateful for the assurance.
Steve turned his gaze to Tony, silently pleading for him to do something. Tony gave him a small smile and tried to step closer but was stopped by the other doctors. That dashed his spirits a little bit, but he still managed to look reassuring.
Slowly, Steve turned around and moved to sit in a nearby swivel chair. Natasha found another one and pulled it up to sit beside him. It was clear that troubled thoughts swirled behind his stony expression, but he didn't speak up. Again, Nat found herself having to take the initiative.
The room on the other side was clearly an interrogation room, but the table and chairs had been removed and space converted into a make-shift ICU. Multiple machines monitored the vitals of a man lying on a hospital bed in the back-center of the room. Several heat lamps surrounded the bed. The man looked like he was in a calm and peaceful sleep even though he had various tubes and wires connected to him. He appeared to be in his early to mid-twenties and had a rather fit physique with strong arms and a broad chest. Tony might have focused on that detail for a little too long before the eye's flicked up to the man's face. Once he properly focused on it he realized he had seen the face before. He had never met the man himself (given that the guy was supposed to be, you know, dead) but he had seen pictures before and heard his father go on about the man enough times. However, the logical part of his brain rejected the notion.
The list went on endlessly in Tony's head. He had to force himself to snap out of it and focus on his conversation with Pepper.
However, several sources tout the effectiveness of interventions but do stress that it should only be used as a last-ditch resort and that it's down to the addict to help themselves.
"Why do you have to ruin my fun, J?"
"How do you know that?" Freeman asked.
Tony – predictably – gave no response. Steve sighed.
"It's the least I can do," she said. Tony hummed and nodded in agreement. An awkward silence then passed over the room, but it was not as bad as it could have been. Tony was not radiating anything but animosity towards Natasha anymore, and that was a major improvement.
"No, it's not," Lara said. "And if you don't go to that meeting, I will leave the court to kick your ass." Tony frowned.
"No," he said. "No, I am not." For some reason, he let out a pathetic little laugh following that statement.
Things didn't go "viral" back in 1995. At least, not in the way that we understand today. Computers had much more limited processing power, and sites like YouTube were a full decade out from being created. The most reliable way to play video content was via VHS. Yes, DVDs had been invented by that point, but they weren't as affordable or convenient for the average consumer. After all, most VCRs had a recording function built-in, which made it much easier for people to record whatever they wanted and was less complicated than the process of burning a DVD. Not to mention that if the person possessed the right equipment, they could copy VHS tapes, too, making it entirely possible to share certain videos with friends and family. This was great if you just wanted to share memories or just make a copy of the latest blockbuster. It was terrible if you stood to lose any public credibility.
"I thought I basically summarized it."
to scream that.
Thanks to Balletgrl046 for leaving kudos and bookmarking, along with kagsfan on AO3! I hope you both have a happy holiday! :)
"Try to tell your professor that," Clint said. "Or whoever it is on the other side of the computer that grades your homework and reads your papers."
"Sorry." It came out a little more begrudging than he would have liked, but Tony still shrugged in acceptance.
"I've been standing here for a couple of minutes," she said. "Who were you talking to?"
Pepper got up and Steve followed her down the hall to Tony's room. Upon entering, Steve saw Lara playing with her small, black device again while Tony was writing his information down on the forms Lara had been filling out earlier. Tony glanced up from the clipboard and his and Steve's eyes connected. Steve pushed away from the fluttering feeling an anxiety that stirred up and just reveled in the relief that Tony was okay. That moment didn't last though as Lara spoke up, capturing everyone's attention.
"What's going on?" Natasha took a deep breath before speaking up.
"I totally agree."
Once he backed away, Tony sat up and reached for the glass. He prolonged his drink as much as possible to avoid having to speak or lie back down. Again, he noticed the odd texture of the water but didn't question it. He drank almost all the glass before pulling it away from his lips.
Hill told them everything she knew – which she claimed wasn't much, but it was a lot more than what Lara and Bruce had been working off. One of the Avengers (she honestly didn't know which one) opened a letter containing a white powder. They couldn't give them a who, how, or why as they hadn't even begun to co-ordinate their efforts properly, never mind launch an investigation. She couldn't even tell them what the powder even was (though, she did admit anthrax was a suspect.) The most she could tell them was that Steve and Natasha had been quarantined at Avengers Tower while Tony and Clint had been taken to Mount Sinai Hospital to be more closely monitored.
"The address is obviously fake," he said. "So why pick Newark? You could make it look like the letter came from anywhere in the world. Why there?" Betty's eyebrows knitted together as she thought the question over. When she came to the answer, her eyes went wide.
"You can do that when you're better," Steve argued.
"Enough to make a bomb if you know what you're doing."
"Peachy," Jessica said. "Thanks for asking…"
"And we should take your word for that?" Tony questioned.
"Alright," Tony said. "But the apartment better come out looking at least half as good as Steve's sketches."
"I'll take you to the Stark Industries homepage," she said. "Why what is it that you're looking for."
"Not necessarily," Steve said. "I think they were genuinely concerned." Tony looked down. He highly doubted that. "Are you coming?" Tony nodded.
"Hi," she said, a little surprised at his sudden appearance. "Here's your water."
Happy Birthday to our favorite billionaire, genius, playboy, philanthropist! I hope everyone enjoys this chapter!
"Gee doesn't that sound familiar," Betty commented.
"Pretty much," he said. "Why?"
"God damn it!"
"You're still not fired," Pepper said. "But if you don't come in tomorrow, you will be. Understand?"
"I don't think I understand," Adoniram said.
"Secondly," Lara continued. "You don't understand exactly what Freeman did. He let a man who tried to kill me – a murderer – into the building where I work, into my proximity. I might be wrong; it might be the PTSD talking, but I perceive that as a threat. So, yeah, I have a right to feel scared and angry."
"Of course." She waved it off like it was nothing. "Easy as pie! Why? Are you offering me a job or something?"
This hadn't been where he was before. Clint was sure of that. What he wasn't sure of was how he got there or why he was even there in the first place. He remembered something about S.H.I.E.L.D., but that was it. He didn't remember how he had gotten to this field, and it took him a second to even recognize the place. When he did, he was overjoyed. This was the field surrounding his farm, turning around, Clint could spot the farmhouse in the distance and began sprinting at top speed for it.
Steve leaned in closer to the screen and watched Tony's movements with bated breath. Tony was very clearly bed wrangled with his hair a mess and his clothes rumpled. He seemed very out of it, rubbing his eyes and leaning against a wall for support. For the longest time he did nothing; just stared at the elevator's control panel with a glazed over expression. After a few minutes, he reached out and touched one of the buttons. He had his finger on it for less than a second before he jerked his hand back to cover his ears. Although there was no sound along with the footage, it could clearly be seen that Tony had been affected by a loud noise. With hands still over his ears, he staggered out of the elevator and out of shot.
"Yeah," Tony said once the faceplate snapped over his face and the HUD lit up in front of him. "I need you to stay here and keep an eye on the building's power levels. They should remain stable, but call me if the power goes out – either here or to the rest of the city, alright?"
Steve and the other Avengers have discovered that Tony's missing, and are now searching the hotel for him.
"No," Freeman assured. "I'm doing this to protect you. If there's something you don't want to talk about, now's the time to say something."
"Right away, Sir." JARVIS then brought up the video feed on the holographic screen. Tony sat down in his chair and took a sip of his orange juice.
"Pretty sure I just got fired." Lara didn't miss a beat. She spoke as simply as if she was ordering breakfast.
"JARVIS," Steve called out. "What's the fastest way downstairs; stairs or elevator?"
"Anything else I need to know?" he asked.
Clint and a few other agents tried to fire at the hostile with their sidearms, but another blast got sent their way, forcing him to have to tuck and roll to safety. He could already feel the bruises he was going to have later as he slowly forced himself to stand. As he got to his feet, though, the man accosted him, grabbing his arm and squeezing his wrist painfully. Clint was surprised when the man didn't try to take any other action against him.
"Like the crap, the People's Unity Church has been spewing for months?" Lara's eyes went wide.
"I know," Rhodey said. "But I need to hear you say it." Tony took a couple of deep breaths.
"You know that?" he chuckled humorlessly. "Is that what you know?" He then leaned back to find he was on an exam table like the ones found in most private practice doctor's offices. It wasn't exactly the most comfortable thing in the world, but Clint found himself decompressing and relaxing on top of it like it was the world's finest feather-filled mattress with the softest silk sheets money could buy. "I have no window," he heard himself saying. "I have to flush him out."
"No." Tony frowned.
"What's this about?" Pepper asked.
"I also wasn't able to get the stuff you asked for," she added.
"Yeah, Lara said. "One count of attempted murder, one count of actual murder."
"Alright," he said. "But can I ask you one thing?"
"It's likely you have another condition in addition to these infections," Rawls said. "Speaking of which, have you been more susceptible to viruses and infections than usual?" Taking a moment to think about it, Tony realized he had been sick far more times this year than he had in years past. He had initially chalked it up the palladium poisoning, but maybe something else was going on.
"Good," Bruce said. He started to approach the letter's protective housing. "So, there's a moisture strip." Betty nodded in confirmation. "Which means that more likely than not, this thing is alive." A sympathetic look crossed Betty's face.
"Oh yes," Rawls said. "Just a few rounds of antibiotics and Mr. Stark should be good to go." Pepper let out a breath of relief and Tony could feel a little bit of the weight lift off his shoulders. "However, I don't think that's all that's going on here." Just like that three times the weight was added. "You said the headache started long before the respiratory symptoms did, right?"
On a subconscious level, Clint knew that something was wrong. His senses were both dulled and heightened at the same time. It was like being under the effects of some extremely powerful drug. Everything he saw was sharper, brighter, clearer, and his reaction time had increased ten-fold. However, at the same time, he noticed that something was off with his hearing. At first, he thought that his implants were malfunctioning, but when he tested them out by snapping his fingers near his ears, he found that he could hear that just fine. Same with the sound of objects being moved or the various
"It turns out we were on the right track by treating Captain Rogers for hypothermia." Tony glanced over at the agent in surprise but quickly turned his attention back to the unconscious man in the next room. "The only thing we didn't account for was that his average core body temperature is much higher than what is considered normal. A cellular biologist we have on staff was able to determine the temperature we needed to get him up to and one of our engineers modified the heat packs to reach higher temperatures without burning the patient." Tony had to admit he was mildly impressed, however, he had other concerns now.
"Knock, knock," she said as she tapped on the wood of the door. "Is it alright for me to come in?"
With that, Peggy looked him directly in the eyes and said, "I understand because Steve was the exact same way." It took a moment for Tony to fully comprehend what she was saying, and once he did the shock became obvious on his face.
"Don't know yet," Knežević said. "In theory, it's a permeant freezing solution, but I haven't yet gotten the opportunity to see the chemicals react in practice. If you get these chemicals for me, I'll be able to find a practical use for it and market it on an international scale."
"No way," Tony said. "I went back to the hotel as you and Lara wanted me to! Now that there's no risk of damaging someone's public reputation, I should be allowed to do whatever the hell I want!"
"By the way," Tony said. "
It felt like hours had passed before Tony could stand wholly upright and start to move away from the trash chute. When he did, Steve pulled up the sleeve of his shirt and used it to wipe his mouth off. He hummed gratefully.
"I brought him back to the hotel and he snuck out last night while I was asleep," Steve said. "We haven't been able to find him."
"It's just knowing where to start is hard," he admitted. "I have some hundred-thousand questions running through my head and I don't know what to ask first."
"What's that supposed to mean?" There was a sharp edge to Stark's voice. Clint swallowed hard.
"No, it isn't," Clint agreed. "But if people are hurt nothing's going to stand in the way of me helping them; not even getting sick."
"Midnight last night, maybe sooner?" Tony's brow creased as he tried to remember. "Steve said that I was burning up after I puked last night, but I can't remember when that was."
"After S.H.I.E.L.D. was established all the old SSR files were added to the official S.H.I.E.L.D. archive and that's what the med and science teams are going through now," Hill explained. "Currently, all of the information on Project: Rebirth in the world is inside this building.
"What's the other part?" Lara asked.
Tony, obviously, hadn't taken the cold reception very well. That was very apparent now that they were standing in the S.H.I.E.L.D. Quinjet facing opposite sides of the plane while Loki sat tied up a few feet away from them. The Norse God had surrendered easily, allowing the agents to secure his hands while Natasha patted him down. As far as she could tell, he didn't have any other weapons on him and they were given the okay to bring Loki back to the Helicarrier base. Tony claimed to be exhausted after flying all the way from New York to Germany in the suit and asked Natasha with a "pretty please" to let him hitch a ride to S.H.I.E.L.D.'s secret base with them. Natasha agreed, but only because she felt safer having the extra hands ready to deal with Loki at any given time and because he "asked nicely."
"Really?" Salinas scoffed. "Care to share?"
By the time the meeting adjourned, Tony's list had grown to include one-hundred fifty entries. At this point, Steve failing to call him should have been the very last thing on his mind, but Tony couldn't stop feeling it eat away at him. The worry was unfounded, but it still existed nonetheless, and Tony didn't have time to allow it to consume. He had bigger fish to fry.
"And we're not expecting Thor to show, right?"
"And that situation would be?" She raised an eyebrow as if to will the cop to be truthful to her. It didn't work.
"I think I'm whole enough. Goodbye." She left the room, not listening to Carl's protests and demands for her to stay. She rolled her eyes. He had to know it was completely useless.
"Within reason?" Fury questioned.
"I'll go find an agent," Bruce said. "They at least need to get the word out to the post offices in Newark just in case anyone's been exposed."
"Okay." Tony eyed him oddly. "What did you tell her?"
… Something hadn't been right. He told Steve and the medical staff as much that day. He was adamant that something was wrong with him, even when everyone assured him there was nothing physically wrong with him.
"I'll keep that in mind, doc." Tony got the sense that if Smith could roll her eyes without destroying all semblance of professionalism, she would. "Now what?"
"I believe you," Pepper said. "Trust me, Tony has security protocol on top of security protocol protecting that house. I'm certain he has JARVIS lock down the house automatically if he leaves without doing it. Not to mention all the alarms that would be triggered if an unidentified person set foot on the property."
"I need to put down the phone for a second," she said. "I won't hang up, I'm just going to ask someone something really quick." She didn't wait for the operator's response as she turned off speakerphone and set the device down on the table in front of her. Taking a deep breath to collect herself, she turned her gaze upwards at the unseen being. "JARVIS, what is the fastest escape route barring the elevator?"
"Is anyone else sick?" she asked. "Specifically, Tony?"
"Actually, yes. Do you know where I can use a phone?" A look of confusion overtook the agent's face.
"It's still healing!"
"I think it's suspicious that Fury's known that she's been out there all this time and never once called her in; not even for New York." Clint's jaw set in a hard line. "What do you think?" He let out a heavy breath through his nostrils.
"There's nothing else wrong with you, right?" Steve asked. "Nothing hurts or feels weird?"
(See the end of the chapter for
"Don't worry about it," Tony said. "I've got it taken care of." Out of the corner of his eye, Tony could see Pepper shooting him a questioning look, and he sent one back that hopefully communicated "I'll explain later." That seemingly satisfied her as she nodded and backed off, but Tony couldn't say the same about some of the other looks they were receiving throughout the room. Shaking it off, Tony patted her on the shoulder and started moving towards the exit. "Come on, we don't want the food to get any colder." They made it to the archway before Tony remembered the thing he was going to ask about. "Oh yeah, Bruce, can you take a look at Pepper's cheek. It's hurting her."
"What I want to know is what was the deal with that Q&A session?" Tony asked. "Because that wasn't the media, that was the public."
"It's nothing bad," Steve assured. "At least, not in the immediate sense."
"Why?" Tony said. "Why am I like this? Why?"
"Thank you." Tony spread the blankets over himself, snuggling the blue blanket particularly close.
"Yeah, about that," Pepper said. "I was actually thinking of staying back." Tony's eyebrows raised in surprise.
Adoniram pulled his hand away from the shard a little too fast. As a result, he was momentarily blinded, and his head felt like it was spinning. Shutting his eyes and shaking his head usually fixed it, but this time it took a little longer than normal. By the time his vision came back to him, Margot was calling for him again, her voice growing slightly concerned. Adoniram shut the shard's case and went to get the door.
"I'm fine," he tried to say but Steve wouldn't hear it.
"Alright," Pepper said as she finished scanning the page. "Most of this is correct, but under personal care provider you put 'Tony Stark' and under policy number you put 'same as social security number.'"
"Well, this is his modius operandi, right?" Freeman said. "He'll go out, get drunk, and party all night. It's nothing out of the ordinary."
"Listen," Tony said. "That's great and all, but I need to get in the building. Can you get someone to let me in?" He hadn't remembered it until the door rejected his card, but the exterior card sliders were disabled in a code blue lockdown, even for the master keycards. It was an extra precaution to make sure no one could get in or out by any means – even by stealing one of the three master keycards. (However, the master keycards still worked to unlock the interior doors.)
"The same thing," Lara dismissed. "I'm tired. I can't American right now. You're lucky I haven't reverted to French."
"The CDC hasn't officially confirmed it yet," Bruce said. "But we have an idea and it's not looking good."
"I don't know," Audrey responded. "She's not here, but her car is in the driveway…"
"So, what do you say?" Steve could feel his smile returning.
"Not quite," Hill said. "We still need to discuss how this was allowed to happen." A pregnant pause filled the room. Every face had some level of guilt written across them, even the puppy. "So, where were you all last night?" Lara was the first one to speak up.
"You know what, just give me the strongest thing you have." He just wanted to be done with the pain already.
"Tony." He stopped as soon as he caught sight of the stern expression on Pepper's face. "Don't. Go to bed."
Carol extended out her wrist and a golden light came out of a sensor. The beam scanned Stark up and down twice before the computer beeped, announcing it had enough readings.
It wasn't just the vomiting that had them concerned. Tony's skin had gone so pale that someone could confuse him in a lineup with Casper the Friendly Ghost and a dying E.T. Add to that the fact that his minor shivers before had progressed to full-body trembles and what you got wasn't a pretty picture. The worst part about all of it was that despite how terrible he was doing now, there was still a chance that things could get worse.
"That will be all for now, Miss Everhart." Tony looked over at Lara.
"It's Nina."
In all seriousness, the disaster that was the 2010 Stark Expo was definitely the fault of Justin Hammer and Ivan Vanko – two men brought together by the desire to respectively outdo and get revenge on Tony Stark – but the media, a certain percentage of the general public, the company that insured Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, and Tony's own conscience all seemed to disagree with that fact. It was to the point where Tony was shocked that the city officially gave them the go-ahead to start construction. He was certain that some city official would pull some long-forgotten law or ordinance out of nowhere to stall construction, but that never seemed to happen. That came as a relief, considering how much time, energy, and money had already been sunk into the project, but at the same time it set Tony a bit on edge. Call him paranoid, but he was almost certain that someone had something up their sleeve to set the project back. He could just feel it.
Obviously, Tony was more than a bit antsy to see Steve. How could he not be? The guy was the only thing he had on his mind for the past week, other than completing construction on the tower. It was a little scary to Tony to admit that, but at the same time it was thrilling.
"Good," Natasha said.
"Howard told you about that?" Tony tried hard not to laugh at Steve's embarrassment.
"Yes," he assured. "I'm sure." Steve smiled back.
So, irritated at the fact that no one on this ship could contact the outside world for help – a stupid and wildly dangerous thing to do – Tony went straight to the bridge, spotted an agent who looked to be talking on an old-school land-line phone, pulled the device from their hand, hung up on whoever they were talking to and started to dial out. Hill descended upon him in seconds. She tried to ask him what the hell he was doing but he shushed her as the operator picked up the phone.
"I had pizza," Tony tried to argue.
"And what kind of attention would that be?" Tony legitimately found himself questioning her intelligence.
"You couldn't have mentioned that earlier," she groaned. "Mon Dieu, did he leave anything else behind?"
The two of them quickly fell into line with the traffic, managing to stay side-by-side. Lara allowed two flights of stairs to pass before she tried speaking again, out of respect for the people they obstructed.
"Steve, can you hear me?" Steve looked down at Natasha. He could see her concern etched in the lines of her brow; concern for him, not Tony. That just made things worse and added the question of whether or not the others were taking this seriously to mind. He'd say something but his throat suddenly felt like sandpaper, making speech impossible. Bruce chose that moment to speak up.
"Public buses," Lara added.
"No," Lara said. "I work for Mr. Stark and I'm not going to step aside until you identify yourself and state your intentions."
"Well, I'd love to see it," Clint said.
"No one is lying," Freeman said before Lara cut in.
"That sounds nice," Tony said.
"Wait, Peoples Unity Church…?" Lara questioned. "Tony isn't that the same group that gathers in front of the tower."
"How could you have seen worse?" he asked. "That's almost dead."
Welcome to chaos, do you recognize me?
"I get that," Steve said.
"Should we really be focusing on what could have been done, though?" Bruce asked. "I mean, it's already happened. Hindsight isn't going to solve anything."
"Agent Drew," Smith said. "I must implore you to return to bed immediately."
"Listen, I don't know where you got that idea psychiatry, but that's not how we're going to be doing things here." Dr. Cranston's voice was firm, yet still somehow gentle. "When I say that this is a safe space, I mean it. We don't talk about what you don't want to talk about. That would be detrimental to your recovery process. You're in charge here, and what you don't feel comfortable talking about, we won't talk about. Although, I would appreciate it if you told me now whether or not you have a desire to kill women for their skin." Alright, that got Tony to smile for a moment.
"Then arrest yourself." Natasha shook her head.
He didn't have much time to beat himself up over it. A few moments later a nurse came in to take a throat culture and some blood. The culture wasn't a problem but drawing the blood could have gone smoother. It took six times for the nurse to find a vein. He normally didn't mind needles but getting stabbed by one over and over was not a pleasant experience. He was ever so thankful when the nurse announced that she had what she needed, and the test results would be back in a couple of hours. At that point, he was left alone to contemplate his fate.

arrested if he ever sets foot on US soil again. It's also not worth the four-hour flight just to go down there to beat him up, so I'd leave it be, Cap." Steve let out a heavy sigh.
"No," he said. "It's been quiet all…" Scratching sounded at the door and it was far from normal scratching. It sounded like a caged wolf trying to escape its pen. Clint's face fell. "Shit."
"I don't taste anything wrong…" That's when it dawned on him. "Shit, I just thought of this. They put all kinds of artificial chemicals and flavorings in food now. With your enhanced senses and the fact that you're not used to eating any of them, you can probably taste them stronger than most people can." He handed the burger back to Steve.
"Not if you're willing to pay five figures." Clint had to grab the table to keep from falling over.
Instantly, the S.H.I.E.L.D. doctors started to back away while the CDC crew hovered close by. Smith hopped down from her chair and rushed over to Tony. Tilting his head up, she began to prod at his glands.
"Clint also hits people when he sees a car with an out of state license plate," Natasha added.
"What's wrong?" he asked.
Clint forced himself to sit up as he continued to pull on the restraints. He fought desperately for control; to stay in one reality long enough to determine what was real and what wasn't. Tears collected in the corners of his eyes. His wrists ached with pain. The only reassuring thing was that he could still hear Natasha's voice.
"And what did they tell you about the danger?" Carol asked. "About the Kree?"
"I was too," he said. "But I'm not sure how I feel about the hugging." Lara instantly pulled back.
"We'll see about that," Carol remarked. At the same time, a small, sleep-laden voice spoke up from within the bedroom.
Under normal circumstances, I'd wish everyone a happy Inauguration Day, but given all the recent events I don't think that'd be a wise idea.
By the time Tony made his way to the bridge, the rest of Fury's rag-tag team of misfits had already gathered in the bridge; Natasha, Thor, Dr. Bruce Banner, and Steve… Tony tried his best to keep his frustration with Steve off his mind, but it was rather hard to do that when he was looking right at the man. Luckily, Bruce was discussing what Loki and his cohorts were up to with the cube, so it was easy for him to distract himself with something more important.
The second time Tony woke up, he felt something cold pressed against the back of his neck. He turned to see Steve leaning over him and pulling his hand away.
For a while, they just laid there, enjoying each other's company. However, something substantial was left hanging in the air. Tony could feel the tension and squeezed his eyes shut, waiting for the other shoe to drop.
"I'm not overconfident," Knežević said. "I just have nothing else to lose."
"S.H.I.E.L.D. sent over a bunch of files," Lara explained. "We think they're from what happened in D.C. and the bio-terror attack. Could you just give it a look-through just to see what it is and whether or not Tony needs to sign anything?" Natasha nodded.
Happy Martin Luther King Jr. Day to everyone in the US! To everyone else, happy Monday I guess.
"Can I speak to him?"
"You could say that," he said. "Might I ask why?"
"Not tonight," Steve said. "Maybe some other time. Come on, let's get you to bed."
The shock and horror remained in Lorraine's eyes until they eventually glazed over and died out. Knežević moved the body to the backyard, mostly because he honestly didn't think he could pass it off as modern art if the neighbors got suspicious and called the cops.
Thank you to Saidra for the comment on AO3! It really means a lot!
Slowly, he began to saunter out of the restaurant when he stopped dead in his tracks. Turning around, Knežević looked at the stone corpse. He glanced down at her name tag and smiled.
"Alright," he said. "Just take your time." Lara took a deep breath and willed away the rolling and churning of her stomach. Well, at least she tried to.
Stane did not know yet, and that kept one problem at bay for now. It was still likely he'd find out through less than preferable means thanks to the pack of wild vultures outside, but it was still one less thing that needed to be dealt with right away and Rhodey absolutely appreciated that as he didn't want to be the on the receiving end of the potential fallout. Then again, he did not want Tony to be either – especially when he was not conscious and could not defend himself – so it was really a lose-lose situation. Regardless, Stane did not know yet and Rhodey would take the blessings he could get.
"My people want nothing but peace with your planet," Thor said.
"Jessica, can you hear me?" Her eyes went over to the doctor who asked the question. It was the only indication she could give that she was listening. His face was shadowed making his already masked face seem more ominous.
"Nina, listen to me." Oswin pulled back and once again cradled her girlfriend's face in her hands. "I'm safe. Whatever that Homeland Security lady told you was wrong. I'm alive, and I promise I'm not going to leave your side, okay?" Nina nodded, but still had questions despite the assurances.
"No," Carol said. "You're here because you made the safe and healthy choice. You can do it. You just need to have faith in yourself."
"Plus, Pepper thought it was a good idea," Tony added.
"But why would they try to interrupt one of our press conferences like that?" Lara questioned. "Especially such an impromptu one. I can see them trying to interrupt something we planned days or even weeks out like that, but less than six hours before?"
Ehehe... If you don't already want to kill me, you're going to want to by the time you get to the endnote.
"Hey, hey." Steve's arms quickly encircled Tony in a warm comforting hug. For two seconds Tony let his guard down and allowed a few tears to slip out. "You're here now and everyone's safe. That's all that matters. Just try to focus on that, okay?"
"True enough," Steve said. "But for what it's worth, I sincerely hope that you never get put in that situation again."
Dr. Smith had told him that they believed that the powder had been genetically modified Ebola and H5N1. While the idea of that terrified him, at the same time he realized that he probably didn't have it. Other than throwing up that one time, he hadn't been sick at all. In fact, he felt much better than he had in days. Either he wasn't infected, or the combination of Ebola and H5N1 was a miracle cure for withdrawal symptoms.
"Ah," Bruce said. "I wouldn't go that far."
"I'm going to make a series of statements," he explained. "All you have to do is say yes or no as to whether or not you believe that statement applies to you. Do you understand?"
"What's wrong with Vista?" Lara asked.
"Are you serious?" He felt like hitting something, so he slammed his fist hard against the passenger-side window. He flinched a little bit from the pain. "Ah – You just said you got spotted by five guards! What the hell are you thinking and shit, what are your windows made of?"
"No worries," Natasha assured as she stood from her seat. "I've got it."
"Do you even know what you're talking about Schaffer?" Tony asked. "Because it just seemed like your lips were moving but no sound was coming out."
"Last night," Lara said.
"I've been trying," he said. "I really have."
of her skin. Eventually, just staring at the petrified corpse was too creepy for Duran. She had to look away before she lost what little remained of her sanity. …And her lunch.
"Just barely," she said. "It's just a little bit after 11 AM. Did you enjoy your little after-shower nap?"
"So what?" Bergeron asked. "Are you saying that we should just give up? There's no way that two people alone could have gotten that many chemicals out of Stark Industries by themselves! That just doesn't happen!"
"Possibly," Peggy admitted. "She's been getting passed around all night, having her cheeks pinched. Figured she deserved a little break. Besides, who doesn't open the door for a baby?" She rubbed her finger across Sharon's cheek, eliciting a laugh from the little girl.
"It still doesn't sound like this conversation's going anywhere good." Again, Steve sighed.
They stayed on the call for a while. The kids told him about what they did at school and daycare, and Clint assured them all once again that he was feeling much better. By the time it came to say goodbye, Clint really did feel better. He was glad to see that his family was safe and healthy, and he knew it was the same for them. His mind was eased ten-fold.
"Kitchen!" Carol glanced at Fury and shrugged before heading down the hall.
Slowly prying his eyes open, Tony glanced around at his surroundings. He was, in fact, in a hospital room. He wasn't sure if it was the same hospital room as he was in before, if it wasn't it was practically identical. Glancing out the window, Tony could see that the sky was clad in the gray of early dawn. So, he'd been passed out for quite a while. He began to wonder if it was the next day or if he had been completely out for a few days when an extremely irritated blonde woman entered the room. Tony let out an exasperated sigh.
"Because we're a team," Natasha said. "And if you really want to try to conquer this, we'll help you."
"Design ideas for the apartment." That reply caused Tony to raise an eyebrow and Pepper to step over to look for herself. Lara and Tony then followed suit. "I mean, it's not much," Steve admitted. "I mostly based it on what I remember of the inside of the house in Malibu and what you've got going on downstairs…"
The entire time he went through the integration process, the Other had taunted him and threatened him. All of which were some of the sickest and vile things someone could say to another person, but Loki was able to handle it. He knew everyone had said those things about him behind his back at some point or another. It was refreshing for someone to have the courage to say it to his face. There was one threat, though, that always struck, well for lack of a better term, the fear of God into Loki; one thing that the Other could say that would make even Loki's cold, mischievous heart shrivel in terror.
"Whoa," Steve said. "Back up. What's an intervention?"
"Well, I couldn't very well lie to Mr. Stark now, could I?" Lara frowned.
"Amateur," Clint scoffed.
"I'm sorry," she said. "I know this is probably distressing for you…"
Not wanting to worry her best friend, Carol didn't share her concerns with her. Though she did try to keep as close to the truth as possible.
"We got to stop him." Natasha's voice had a sense of decided determination as she turned around.
"I'm fine," she said. "And fired, but mostly fine."
"I take it you don't think that's a good idea," Bruce said. Lara sighed.
"You'd hate living under a totalitarian regime more," Natasha said. "Trust me."
"Can't give you an ETA, but I should be back to drop off this little guy soon." He just needed to get access to a quinjet, which he knew wouldn't be too hard.
"What can I say. I don't hold back." Her mouth tasted sour from the venom she had to keep out of those words.
He hadn't seen any of the others since Romanoff left him. That would be all well and good as he was certain that Romanoff had turned them all against him by this point, but Steve was still with them. He liked Steve. He missed Steve. He wanted to kiss Steve. So, he had no choice but to try and find them. The only problem with that was that he couldn't remember where their table was, and people kept coming up to him to talk. Also, the fact that he kept pouring more alcohol down his throat probably didn't help.
"Me, too," Steve said when Freeman turned his gaze over to him.
"Loki's going to use the arc reactor at Stark Tower to fire up the Cube," he explained without even giving Hill a glance. "Everything within a few blocks of the tower… Hell, maybe all of Midtown needs to be evacuated ASAP."
The hospital that Tony was taken to was just as well-versed in maintaining the privacy of their more well-known patients. By the time Rhodey arrived in his car, they had security guards posted at all the entrances and ID had to be shown along with a statement of your purpose in being there. Rhodey showed both his driver's license and his military ID, and given his position within the armed forces and the fact that he was a regular member of Tony's entourage and therefore recognizable as someone who actually knew Tony, he was let inside.
"Yeah," Tony said. "That's when you call me." Cabe sighed.
"Casse couille." Lara feigned offense. Tony ignored her and turned back towards the bedroom. "If I must get ready now, can I at least wake up Steve? He'll make the process so much more enjoyable."
Anyways, I really hope you enjoyed this chapter and the story as a whole. Also, I'm sorry in advance. You'll see what I mean.
"You too," Tony's smile faltered. "Barton's not, though." Steve's face sank into concern.
"He forced you to drink?" Tony nodded. "Did he do anything else?"
"There will be no problem," Romanoff said. "As long as you tell us why Salinas is after Stark." A look of disgust came across Freeman's face.
"Right," Steve said. "Is it enough for you to figure out where he's going?"
About an hour passed before he heard the front door open again. This time, he could hear two people talking. One was very clearly the girl from earlier and the other voice belonged to a second woman.
As soon as they managed to get comfortable, Tony pulled Steve close for another kiss. This kiss was much more chaste than the ones before it, but still enjoyable nonetheless. When Tony pulled back, he gave him a wide smile.
"Something tells me you should have let him squirm."
"You can't," Loki protested. "There is no stopping it. There is only the war."
but…"
Ah, isn't living in denial great?
"He's an Asgardian," Natasha provided. "And the only one of us that isn't living here at the moment."
"Got it," Lara said as she got up and started heading for the door. Tony felt Steve's hand return to his back.
Speaking of reality that was something that Tony needed to snap back to quick. Pushing his justifications for self-neglect aside, Tony got himself dressed and ready for his work day. After he got himself relatively put together, Tony walked back over to the side of the bed and bent over to plant a kiss on Steve's forehead. He did not stir – which Tony was thankful for – and he silently padded out of the room, careful to shut the door softly on his way out.
"You're fine," Tony said. "I just… I…" He put his head back in his hand. What he wanted to say was that he hated himself, but he knew that wouldn't go over well. God, just when he thought he was starting to put that night behind him… It was just like one tiny step forward and one giant leap back. "So, you're suing the hotel?" He looked back up to see the tail end of Pepper's nod.
The ship's escape pods were designed to hold at least fifty people, so the ship's inhabitants would easily fit in comfortably, even with the two new little additions to their ranks. However, none of the men would be joining the evacuees. It was women and children only. The men were to stay on the ship, doing whatever they could to distract the Kree and prevent them from following the escape pod to the planet below. Although they knew the planet – which went by many names; Terra, C-53, Midgard, Earth, etc. – wasn't uninhabited, it was only a short distance from the red planet they had chosen to colonize, so the hope was that once on Terra they could petition it's government to assist them in completing the final leg of their journey. However, if they wanted to start their lives on this new planet, they were going to need all the information they could get in order to do it and do it right.
"Stark…" Steve said. "Tony said his father was dead."
"They sell a lot of things at the Gap," he said. "You don't know."
"You can probably figure it out."
"Then tell me the truth!" Bergeron slammed his fist down on the table once again.
"I know," Steve said with a nod. "And I know it won't. Things have changed and people are more accepting now. I know that and I'm not worried about it." Natasha felt a little bit of relief as he said that. At least she wasn't going to have that conversation again.
"No," he begrudgingly admitted. Pepper sighed.
"For the last time, no!" The clerk practically shouted. "You can't leave your God damn pamphlets here!"
"I just have one more question to ask," she said. "Where does Tony keep his belts?"
"Agent Romanoff," he said with a smirk as he rolled up to the scene. "You miss me?"
"I know how to make this up to you," he whispered before pecking Steve's temple.
"Sorry," she had said. "Spent the last two months in New Zealand. Hard to switch back.")
"Good," Lara said. "Because from the way he was acting before, I was scared that might be the case."
"I wasn't gaping," Steve insisted.
"Really?" Emboldened, Amanda's glare turned hard.
"You're absolutely sure about that?"
"Good."
"Why not?"
"Get ready?" Lara questioned. "Get ready for what?" Freeman gave her an astonished look.
Lara swallowed hard. As much as she liked Natasha – who was much nicer than Tony had made her out to be – Lara knew that it would be a terrible idea to try to go into a master spy and assassin's room without there permission, even if it was for something as trivial as a hair dryer. In fact, it'd probably be tantamount to suicide. It was probably a better idea to walk blindfolded through a minefield. Regardless, it wasn't like she had any other choice. So, rather dramatically, she sighed.
Steve didn't have time to acknowledge Tony's words before he started up again. For what it was worth, he didn't try to interrupt him. He just did as he was told.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Don't try that with me," Mrs. Barnes warned. "You still stuck your fingers in your sister's ear! She could have gone deaf! I don't care if it's 'just a wet willy," I don't care if she wasn't hurt, I don't care if she bit Steve! She's being punished for her actions, but that doesn't excuse your actions! You do not treat your sister or any other woman like that! Do you understand?"
"If you don't mind my asking, what are you doing here?" Even having an amazingly cute puppy in his arms couldn't distract Bruce from getting right to the point.
"We understand," Natasha assured.
"You did?" Clint asked.
"Then why are they?" Steve asked.
There were blood and a lot of it. Certainly, more than what she would consider normal for her period. Most alarmingly, it all looked fresh and it had clearly soaked through her underwear and her pants. Now she knew why someone had called after her; they wanted to tell her that she was covered in blood.
"Alright." Clint's eyes looked out and carefully scanned the crowd as if searching for some sort of threat. He must have been reassured that there was none because after that silent moment he went ahead and did as he was told. "My name is Clint Barton. You all probably know me better as Hawkeye, and a random fact about myself… My favorite movie is
"I can't believe this," Tony's voice echoed of the tile walls. "I just got over being poisoned, only to get poisoned again! If this is someone's sick idea of a joke, I'm not laughing!"
"Emily," Salinas called. "Are you awake yet?"
"Not as much as you," Steve countered. "Last week for example…"
"Seriously, Rhodes?" he said. "That's why you called? Come on! When have you ever known me to do something stupid?"
"What is going on here?" Nina asked. "Why is the road blocked off?"
"Um," Lara spoke up carefully, he eyes darting from Tony to Natasha. "Can I say something first?"
"How long has it been since the plane crashed?" Steve could see the conflict in Tony's eyes. "Come on, you have to tell me." Tony opened his mouth to say something, but then the door on the other side of the room unlocked and opened. Tony turned to look and see who was coming.
Having successfully subdued her attackers, Carol made a break for the stairs. However, by this point Alpha had recovered and began to chase after her. Carol leaped up to fly again, but Alpha grabbed her around the waist, attempting to pull her back to the ground. Carol tried to increase the heat and amount of energy flowing through her body, but it did not seem to have the same affect on Alpha that it did on Beta. Alpha tightened her grip around Carol's waist even though she was screaming in pain. Carol tried to wiggle out of her grasp, but it was almost as if Alpha was clinging to her for dear life. Carol reached down and tried to pry Alpha's arms off her, but while she did so, she did not notice that Beta had recovered as well and sent a concrete fist flying directly into Carol's temple.
"Never mind, JARVIS," he said.
"I don't…" was all Tony could get out.
"Of course, I am," Steve said. "Why wouldn't I be?"
"Well, I hate to tell you this, but your test turned up some very alarming results." Lara raised an eyebrow.
"Still, trust me," Tony said. "I'll be alright." It took a moment, but slowly, Steve nodded. "I'll see you in a few hours."
"You heard about the Tower being struck?" Rhodes gave him a look of disbelief.
Steve tried to follow in pursuit as well, but he only got three-quarters of the way to the end of the block before he got winded and had to catch his breath. He watched as Rebecca turned the corner and disappeared and Bucky followed closely behind her. It was then that Steve figured out how to stop her. Rebecca wasn't allowed to cross the street on her own. If Bucky didn't manage to catch her, she would most likely just keep going around the block and end up in front of the apartment building in which the Barnes' lived once again. So, once he was back to breathing (relatively) normally again, Steve positioned himself in front of the building and waited for Rebecca and Bucky to come running around the corner again.
"I'm talking about robbing Stark Industries." Oswin's eyes went wide. "Not for money or anything like that. I just need to 'borrow' some of the chemicals they have inside for a little bit."
"No," Lara said. "I've already talked to Cabe and the police about it, so if he shows up again, he's going straight to jail. I also texted my friend Todd to see if I could crash at her place until I go to court next Tuesday. By the way, I need next Tuesday off." Tony raised his eyebrows as he felt a little bit of weight come off him.
"Your neurosis is concerning," she remarked.
"Because of Cropsey," Stark said simply.
"It'll just take two minutes," Drew insisted. "I'll be fine."
"Isn't Conroy the one who pulled a fire alarm or something juvenile like that a few weeks ago?" Tony raised an eyebrow, wondering how that little detail had made it all the way to Malibu.
"Did I do something wrong?" Tony shook his head.
"Now, you're free to go," Smith said. "There's already a nurse getting a fresh set of scrubs for you. I don't know if Avengers Tower has been cleared by the CDC yet, but I can find out."
Yeah, not entirely happy with this chapter myself, but what can you do? If you liked this please review or comment or whatever you kids do these days. I don't really have much to say right now. Also, I am not a scientist. This chapter has probably made that very clear to you.
Welcome back! I hope everyone remembers the story so far, and if you don't... Go back and read it yourselves! This is a free story on the Internet! I don't need to recap everything for you! Stop being lazy!
"I was in Calcutta," he said. "I was pretty well removed."
The fact that Pepper and Happy were going to be helping Tony to do this and were supportive of him went a long way to ease Steve's worries. By this point, Steve knew them well enough to know that they would never allow Tony to do something that would put himself in danger. (Well, outside of Iron Man.) He could not help but be thankful for that. Not only did Tony have two amazing friends that would help him through something like this, but they could be trusted to keep him safe. Steve missed having friends like that… A friend…
"Steve," he said in the hazy cheerfulness that usually accompanied being on strong drugs. "Finally, you're here. I've been asking for you for forever."
"I think it's time you thought about getting a haircut." Adoniram looked at his wife through the reflective surface of the mirror. This had been a tradition of theirs for as long as they'd been together. Before Daniel would go in front of the congregation, Margot would comb his hair for him. When they started this, his hair was brown and in a bowl cut. Now, it was white and began to reach past his shoulders, and even though he kept it tied back in a ponytail most of the time, it still managed to become tangled quickly. Margot had pulled at a particularly nasty bur when she made that remark, causing a flash of pain to come across his face.
Thank you to the two guests who left kudos on AO3! You guys rock!
"I can't, I'm in deep cover," Jessica explained. "If I take him to the hospital my cover is blown, and Hydra will kill me and anyone I'm with."
I hope everyone enjoyed this chapter! This definitely was a little brutal on everyone, Tony especially. Things aren't looking good for him now, are they?
"I'm sorry, who?" The producer raised an eyebrow as Tony turned around.
"JARVIS," he said addressing his suit's AI. Thor looked confused for a second as he looked around for the mysteriously invisible fourth person. "do you have a bead on our little attempted supreme overlord?" Steve couldn't hear what JARVIS was saying as Tony only had him wired to access the internal speakers, not the external ones. However, whatever he said clearly shocked Tony. "What? Are you serious?"
"Hit me with it now," he said. "It'll give me one less thing to worry about." Lara nodded. She got out of the recliner chair across from Barton and set her laptop down in front of Tony.
"Emergency protocols have been initiated," she reported. "All civilians are evacuating via the north-west and north-east stairwells. Your head of security advised that we should evacuate to the basement using the south-west stairwell."
Immediately a wave of anger and concern came over Natasha. About eighty different questions ran through her mind. What happened? Where's Clint? Is he hurt? Is he safe? Are Laura and the kids safe? Has the farm been compromised as well? However, before she could ask she had one little issue she needed to deal with. Turning her harsh glare on the boss and the lackeys.
With not many more words being exchanged, Hill turned and went back the way she came, most likely to continue to monitor the situation with Barton and Romanoff. Since they had the go-ahead to leave, Steve and Tony started making their way back towards the main entrance of the hospital. Hill had informed them that the S.H.I.E.L.D. car that had brought her, Steve, and Romanoff to the hospital would be available to take them back to Avengers Tower, which was a relief considering that neither Steve nor Tony had their cell phones or exact change on them.
"Homophobia," he said. "If I could put it into just one word, it'd be homophobia."
"You're welcome," she said. "Just remember to keep trying. That's always the best thing you can do."
"Great," Tony said. "It's not on now, right?"
"It's lovely to meet you as well," Tony said in a way that sounded less than sincere. It was clear that Hill had caught on to the slight as she shook his hand.
They mostly discussed his alcoholism and the incident that happened in D.C. Tony wasn't keen on discussing much else – at least right then – and Cranston seemed to pick up on that. All things considered; the session seemed to be going well.
"You're no fun, Pepper." At the same time, JARVIS spoke up again.
"Why, exactly, would we want the Avengers to join our ranks?" he asked.
"She wasn't talking," she finally said. "We needed her to talk to have any hope of a chance at saving you."
"I'm good."
She was then gently moved from the stretcher to the bed of the MRI machine. It was expressed to her that she needed to remain totally still, and Carol tried hard not to roll her eyes. If she didn't get it the first fifty times, she certainly got it now. As she rolled into the machine, Carol closed her eyes and focused on taking deep, even breaths. The entire time she reminded herself to be patient and that Terran medicine was quite a bit behind what she was used to. She just had to put up with it and she'd be free to go.
"The Avengers," Tony commented as he opened a glass bottle. Loki gave him a strange look. "That's what we call ourselves. We're sort of like a team. 'Earth's Mightiest Heroes' type of thing."
"And I'll expect you'll be duly disappointed when your boss educates you on how a matter of national security takes prescience over a silly squabble over jurisdiction." Bergeron was glad she couldn't see him roll his eyes over the phone.
"Why?" the six-year-old whined.
"Have you been talking to Steve?"
"You won't say anything to him about this, will you?" Tony's eyes were wide and pleading.
"Innkeepers," Tony pointed out.
"I wouldn't be saying it if I didn't think I could," Tony lied.
"I found out that my ex is a member of the Peoples Unity Church," she said. "That's how he figured out where I worked. He was attending one of the services and saw me getting on the elevator. I still have no idea how he found my personal phone number, though."
"Video calling," she said. "It's the way of the future." Knežević still looked at her puzzled, in need of a better explanation. Oswin laughed. "Like I said, I'm not all that computer savvy, so I don't know it exactly how it works. The best I can explain it is that the phone shoots some signal up to a satellite and the satellite sends the signal back down to the laptop, allowing you to see and hear everything that I'm doing."
"Steve," Tony said. Steve stood up before he could question him further.
"I thought you dead," he said.
To his credit, Tony tried to answer the questions to the best of his ability, but these doctors were more impatient than any amount of paparazzi he'd ever dealt with in his life. He was just about to be overtaken by the sea of inquiring voices when a loud shout from above silenced the room.
The tone then sounded and Rhodey rushed into leaving the message.
"Yes, sir," the cop then nodded and left, likely to pass the request on to his superiors. Tony looked around the room.
"His brain waves are like those of a coma patient waking up," someone behind him explained. "And all of his other vitals are giving off similar readings." Tony paid them no attention as he analyzed the data for himself.
"Good," Tony said. "That's all great."
"You know, you could talk to Happy and Pepper about this," Rhodey pointed out. "They seem really concerned."
"It was an accident," he explained. "I was plugging your frequency into my contacts so I could call you in the event of an
"Hi," he said gently.
"No." Steve turned back and continued pacing. Natasha moved to keep pace with him.
"Actually, if you were having a heart attack, you'd be more likely to go completely unresponsive." Tony wished Lara were not sitting on the floor so he could shoot her a proper glare. He could settle for sarcasm, though.
"Oh really?" Duran's smug intonation was really getting on his nerves. "And how is Secretary Napolitano? I haven't had the pleasure of speaking with her recently."
"Tony," Pepper said. "Just looking around I'm shocked you've been able to live like this for this long." Tony rolled his eyes.
"Right." Steve took out his wallet an threw a few bills on the table. "Maybe another time."
Friday, December 19th, 1986
"Steve and Tony probably took the limo," Bruce said. "Lara and I took a cab to the station and back."
"Bye, Tony," he said. "Try and get some actual rest, don't just roll onto your side and pretend like your sleeping, only to really be on your phone for hours."
"In New York?" Steve questioned in disbelief. Pepper shrugged.
"Yeah?"
"Uh, yeah," she said. "Why? Should I not have done that?"
Happy Walking Dead premiere day to anyone who also happens to be a fan of that show and a very Happy Birthday to James Rupert "Rhodey" Rhodes! (I swear, I haven't forgotten that he exists! He doesn't want to be written into any of my stories!)
"You've been having nightmares?" Pepper was the first one to speak, to no one's surprise. "Why didn't you say anything?" Tony opened his eyes but directed his gaze to the ceiling.
"So, did I," Salinas said. Freeman turned his gaze to Adoniram.
"Why?" he asked. "I mean, it's not like any of you know me. Not really."
"Yeah," Tony agreed. "The thing is, though, I'm not quite sure what the next step is."
"Are you sure about that?" Natasha nodded.
"Emily! Are you awake yet?" Hearing Salinas shout the alias she had given him had taken Jessica by surprise. He wasn't supposed to be there. Nonetheless, Jessica responded as she was supposed to.
Natasha was on a warpath. She barely took notice of her surroundings as she passed, which wasn't a problem until she was outside, marching straight into the assembled crowd of gawkers. Steve and Hill found themselves apologizing for her to all the people she bumped into and shoved. It took longer than it should have and by the time they got back to the S.H.I.E.L.D. car, Nat was already sitting in the backseat, her arms crossed impatiently.
Remember kids, needles are technically weapons, so they can hurt you!
Once he was behind his car, Rhodey spiked the tape down on the ground as hard as he could. The plastic casing cracked a bit, but otherwise it was relatively undamaged. Rhodey gave an angry and dismissive snort, resolving that it would not stay that way for long. He marched over to the driver's side of the car, hopped in the front seat, and turned the key in the ignition. He did not even give the car a chance to warm up before he threw it in reverse and slammed on the gas pedal.
"Isn't that what you said when Joyce died?" Knežević had nothing to say to that. "Exactly. I'm not going to let you put those girls in danger again. I'm sorry, but you can't see them." The floor seemed to drop out from under him just then.
"Agent Coulson is down," Fury's voice came over the coms. Both Steve and Tony's eyes went wide with shock.
"Yeah," Tony confirmed. "Well, JARVIS said that you were asleep, and I didn't want to disturb you…"
"It was only a wet willy, Ma," Bucky defended. "She wasn't hurt."
Steve wasn't worried until he opened the door. He was shocked to find that the bed was still made and there was no sign of Tony anywhere. He flipped on the light, but it didn't make anything clearer. Even though it was obvious Tony wasn't there, Steve couldn't help but call out his name, hoping desperately that his boyfriend would respond.
idiot. Falling into step with the crowd around her, she threw her mind back in the zone. That probably was a bad idea given what just happened, but she figured it'd be okay. She'd only be endangering herself by not paying attention, not anyone else.
"I can see that," Knežević said. "Good."
For a while, it was silent in the car. Then Oswin burst out laughing.
"Yes," Freeman said. "To protect us from the Kree should they try to stop us like last time." Adoniram had to resist the urge to roll his eyes. His mythology was biting him on the ass again. Nonetheless, he acted the part and made sure that rage was evident in his tone.
A mixture of thoughts and emotions were stirred up in Tony's mind at the question. Most of them were good, but he wasn't sure what to tell Pepper. After all, he couldn't just say "oh, Steve? It's no big deal, really. He's just the World War II Army Hero Captain America. Yes, I know he's supposed to be dead. Turns out he just spent the last sixty-five years frozen in a block of ice until S.H.I.E.L.D. came across and unfroze him. That's why they called me in on Saturday. They needed some of my father's files to make sure they didn't accidentally kill him as he thawed out. I also think he's pretty good looking and I can't stop myself from smiling when I so much as glance at him. Is that creepy?" Yeah, that would get him sent to the happy home with trees and flowers and chirping birds and basket weavers who sit and smile and twiddle their thumbs and toes for sure.
Remember kids, I'm so glad Stan and Kyle aren't here! I hate those guys, seriously!
She pulled back the quilt and pried the blue blanket out of his grasp so she could reach the rest of his clothing. The pants she got off rather easily, but she let him keep his underwear just for boundaries' sake. Next was his vest and after that was the dress shirt. As she started to unbutton it, though, she began to see a strange pattern on his undershirt. Curious, Carol used one finger to pull down the hem of the shirt's neckline, revealing a palm-sized metal cylinder implanted in Stark's chest.
"What would that be?" Thanos smirked. Loki was then grabbed by the neck and once again dragged across the rocky surface of the asteroid. When they reached the edge, Thanos lifted him in the air so that way he was eye-level with him. The smirk turned into a full-blown grin.
Tony looked at her, completely stunned. He couldn't figure out why she was the one apologizing. He was the one who had done something wrong. If anything, he was the one who should be apologizing not only to her but to everyone else for that matter. Shockingly, despite this, he found himself looking her in the eye and saying "yes." Natasha nodded in response.
Lara raised an eyebrow, her gaze holding a slight amount of skepticism.
"Physically." That gave Tony a little bit of relief. Physically he could define easily.
She forced herself to take a deep breath.
I have not seen Spiderman: Far From Home yet, and I'm probably not going to until sometime next week after all the Fourth of July craziness has calmed down. Please do not put any spoilers in your review, thank you.
"They're here."
"Impulsive?" Clint questioned. "What are you talking about?" Laura shrugged.
"Okay." Steve's arms tightened around him. "Take all the time you need. Just tell me when you're ready, and we'll figure things out together."
Before he could change his mind, Tony got up from his chair and went right to Pepper's office – only diverting his course to throw out the apple juice containers and the shot glasses. When he walked in, Pepper and Happy were engaged in conversation, but they abruptly stopped when they took notice of Tony.
"They're okay, though," Laura said. "We're all okay, so don't you worry about us. You need to focus on fighting this." He heard her sniffle. "Fight this, Clint. For the kids… For me… Please, just fight this!"
"True," Freeman said. "But it's a risk we'll have to take." Natasha didn't seem convinced but nodded anyway. Freeman looked to the rest of the group. "Remember, just relax and be yourselves. The public wants to get to know the Avengers. I know we've been stressing over worst-case scenarios, but we also don't want you to be uptight and guarded. Just smile and be at ease. It will make the process go much easier."
Tony's eyebrows raised in alarm when he heard Barton's hacking renew, this time much more violent. He wanted to ask if he alright, but he held back. He didn't want to force answers out of a choking person. However, the sudden blaring of alarms made his concern worsen.
"Yeah, I can see that," he said. "I can see it right now. So how do you get over that."
"Did you tell them that I'm seeking council with the Supreme Understanding?" Adoniram asked.
Tony said something in his sleep that's been concerning Steve all day.
"I have no one to protect," she confessed. "Not anymore, anyways."
The early dawn air was cool, but still carried the heavy, humid quality that made summer days in New York completely unbearable. Maria Hill tried to pay it little mind as she stepped off the helicopter, following closely behind Director Fury. They'd spent the past few days checking in on Project P.E.G.A.S.U.S. and were returning to business as usual.
"Tucking you in," Tony explained. "Now lie back down. You'll be more comfortable that way."
"We'll see how it works out, though," Lara said. "Dante hasn't tried to approach me in days and hopefully it'll stay that way until the hearing."
"I can't," Steve said. "Not when Tony…"
Steve agreed, and Tony pressed his lips to the back of his hand before standing up and heading for the bathroom. As he moved, he started to realize that it would take more than a cold shower to get this erection to go down.
"Doesn't matter," Tony said. "If he frees Loki or kills him, the Tesseract's lost." Tony then started to make his way over to the still open rear hatch.
"Hopefully, nothing," Wayne said. "But until we can determine that for sure, this is where you'll be staying."
"What's his status?" Fury asked Hill.
"She said she wanted to get to know me better if I'm going to be at her wedding," she said. "I asked her what she meant by that and she said to ask you." Bruce felt his stomach drop and had to use sheer force of will keep his pulse down. Thankfully he managed it and didn't turn a single shade of green.
"Okay," Stark said as he set down his glass. "Let us say I believe you. You truly had my mental health and safety as your first concern. Why the hell did you let that party escalate like that? Don't try saying that you were drunk, too, because we both know that's bull crap." Natasha sighed.
Bucky was reaching the end of his rope. To level with his sister, he bent down to her level and put both of his hands on her shoulders. However, Rebecca quickly pushed his hands off her and took off at top speed down the sidewalk. Bucky said a word that would've gotten him in trouble if an adult was listening and began to chase after her.
"Since we don't know what he's been exposed do and there's no definitive way to tell if he's infected or not until the blood tests get back, I'd rather be safe than sorry. I recommend he be put into isolation along with Agent Barton."
"Seriously?"
"Thanks, Rhonda," Jessa said. "City of Los Angeles fire officials have confirmed that the fire has indeed been contained this evening. However, residents are still not permitted to return to their homes due to lingering safety concerns. Reports indicate that the fire broke out in the early hours of the morning on Monday after the blast rocked the neighborhood and woke hundreds of residents. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities thus far though police suspect deaths may be uncovered as they investigate further. The cause of the blast has yet to be determined, but police believe it could be related to the production of illegal substances…"
"Yeah, but this is the last thing Tony needs right now." Lara brought a hand to her forehead and squeezed her eyes shut. "I swear on my mother's grave that I locked that door on the way out. I forgot to put the key back, but I swear I locked the door."
"I left mine in the front pocket of my duffle bag," she said. "If you're running up there, can you get it for me?" Clint nodded and took the card.
She didn't look back up again until the car came to a complete stop. At that point, she pushed all her thoughts aside and got to work. Getting out of the car, she walked around to Clint's side and opened the door for him. At the same time Happy Hogan – whom Stark sent to pick them up – went to the trunk to get the wheelchair that the hospital had provided them with. Clint tried to argue that he didn't need the wheelchair and he could stand just fine, but that wasn't true at all. He leaned on Natasha heavily as she helped him out of the car and once, he was in the chair, the arguments stopped. Other than pouting a little bit, he didn't try to stand or otherwise object to the placement, which was good. At least he knew when to give up the fight.
The ambulance arrived no less than fifteen minutes after Rhodey was connected to the police. It would have come as a relief if it wasn't closely followed by a sea of reporters. Some of the paparazzi liked to keep an ear on the local police scanners in case someone of note was arrested or – as in this case – taken to the hospital. When Tony's address came over the feed, everyone started scrambling over there, wanting to be the first to break the story. Luckily, thanks to the high-profile nature of many of its residents, both the Malibu police force and the EMTs were used to and trained on keeping the media away from a person having a medical emergency. The police forced the reporters back down to the bottom of the hill while the EMTs got Tony loaded into the ambulance safely. Once they were ready to go, the police gave them an escort to the hospital, mostly to ensure that the paparazzi continued to stay back.
After parting ways with Bruce, Lara set out to find Pepper. Seeing as Tony was otherwise occupied, Pepper was the next person she knew to defer to. Finding her proved to be a challenge, though. Apparently, rather than telling her straight out that they didn't know where Pepper was, everyone Lara approached seemed to find sparing her feelings of more importance. They'd lie to her, saying Pepper was at x location when she really wasn't forcing Lara to walk all the way there and get lied to by the next person she asked. If she wasn't fully aware of the situation she was in, she would have gone postal on somebody.
"Wait; what?"
They went through the kitchen, down a hallway, and into the living room – all of which were clean and nicely furnished. Salinas slowly set Tony down on the couch. Tony didn't allow himself to get comfortable until Salinas let him go. When he did, Tony practically became one with the couch. It was
"What seems to be the problem?" Steve made sure his voice was direct and to the point. He was the team leader and that made it his job to deal with irrationally angry people who suddenly confronted them and do it in the most peaceful way possible. He'd already failed in one of his roles today. He wasn't going to fail in another.
"Nat," he said carefully. "Coulson's death wasn't your fault.
of something metal being put on the ground. The door then shut. A pair of footsteps could be heard crossing the room. The person picked up the metal object (which Steve now guessed to be a chair), carried it to his bedside and sat down.
What happened next astounded Tony. He watched as the red-shaded gold-titanium alloy changed to clear, see-through stone. Although some pieces of wiring and a few inner components were now visible, the inner layers of armor and everything else he could see appeared to be unharmed. Knežević smirked.
Lara didn't reply to any of the messages. She wanted to keep all the well-wishes on the first page where she could see them. Smiling, she put the phone back down on the table and went to sleep feeling less alone than she had in a long time.
"No," Steve said firmly.
"Hi," he whispered.
"Of course they are," Tony assured. "I was directly involved, which brings me to my next question. How does it feel to be a genius?"
Steve sent one look of complete disgust and disappointment at the sweating concierge before turning and heading back down the narrow hallway. Already, he could see that Natasha was far ahead. Steve glanced back to see that Clint and Bruce were following closely behind him. He then started walking faster to catch up with Nat. He saw she was tapping the screen of her phone.
"How long would that be?" Fury asked.
"Uh, yeah," the man said as he started lifting the mask off Steve's face. "You probably want this off." The man reached behind his head to pull off the elastics that secured the mask to his face. Steve took in a nice deep breath of fresh air. It felt amazing. "I don't know if it's okay to take this off. Just say something if you feel like you're asphyxiating."

"Where's Thor?" Some in the crowd giggled at the child's bluntness. Tony, however, noticed that Steve sat up a little straighter and scooched forward onto the edge of his seat to answer the question.
"I need an update on the search for the cube," he said. "Got any leads?"
Steve gently pulled back and Tony ran his tongue across his lips, trying to savor the taste of his boyfriend while he could. His cheeks burned as he caught his breath. He was probably a sight to see, but Tony didn't care. In fact, he wouldn't have minded ten more kisses like that, even if the cost were turning into a complete and utter hot mess. Tony's eyes met Steve's and he watched as the sweetest, most sincere smile spread across his face.
"Why?" Tony asked.
"What are you talking about?"
"Well, no."
"You all know who I am, obviously," he said eliciting another laugh from the crowd. "And I'm already certain that ninety percent of you know more about me than I know about myself, so you can take that as your random fact." The crowd cheered, laughed, and clapped. Once again, they reached the end of the line.
"That's exactly what I'm offering you," he said. "My name is Vasyl Knežević and I would like to employ your services, Miss Oswin." He held out his hand for her to shake.
Alright, now I need to elaborate on what I mean by a "dead-end" and I really don't want to... Anyway, here we go. I am officially out of material to cover my post dates. How do I know this? Because my next post date was supposed to be November 24th and I don't have a chapter ready to go. I have only written 1,776 words of Chapter Twenty-Nine and if I had to make an estimate, it's probably going to be around four-thousand words in length. I can't write approximately 3,300 in two days, especially when I have a family engagement to go to tomorrow.
"Yeah," Bruce agreed. "You don't see many elementary school teachers doing that."
"Do you need me to come out there?" The concern in Rhodey's voice was palpable, even over the phone. However, that didn't deter Tony from hastening his reply.
"I slept for seventy years, sir," he said as he started striking the new punching bag. "I think I've had my fill."
"God damn it, Fury!" she muttered as she reluctantly pulled it on. As much as she hated to admit it, depending on the situation outside, she might need it to help hide her face as she left. So, she had no choice but to wear it. That didn't mean she wasn't going to complain about it, though.
"Yes," she said. "It's all they've been talking about on the news today. How have you not heard about it?"
"The kind that's in the public domain," the hotel employee holding the cake said. They set the plate down in the center of the conference table. "Anyways, the Hay-Adams hotel wishes our honored guest, Geena Davis, a wonderful day on this, her fifty-sixth birthday." The employees then promptly filed out of the room. Tony shot Lara a sharp look.
Gently slipping out from under Steve's embrace, Tony quietly padded over to the en suite bathroom, one of the only rooms in the entire apartment that was technically finished. Getting down on his hands and knees, he opened the cabinet under the sink. There, he retrieved an inconspicuous-looking box from the back and produced a flask from inside. Tilting his head back, Tony downed as much alcohol as fast as he could. He got about halfway through the flask before sealing it and putting it back inside the box. The box went back into it's hiding place in the back of the cabinet and pulled himself back up so that he was eye-to-eye with the man in the mirror.
"Then what's wrong?" Steve hesitated to answer. He did not want to upset Tony, and he had a feeling that if he tried to talk about what was bothering him, that's all that would happen. He tried to come up with a way to phrase it that would minimize the potential emotional reaction, but he could not figure it out before Tony tried asking again. "Why don't we try this; when did you start feeling like this?"
"He probably paid people off to keep from speculating about him," Tony said. "It wouldn't surprise me." Tony let a moment pass to get his emotions under control; taking a few calming breaths. "What are they saying about me?" he asked as soon as he felt composed enough. Rhodey shook his head.
"Like when you took ahold of that nuclear missile and carried it through the portal?" Tony felt all the air leave the room. "Now, Mr. Stark, I think the entire
Debating over the issue kept Tony up, which was honestly a blessing in disguise. Even though he knew getting sober was the best thing for him right now, he was scared to fall asleep without having something to drink first. He was being honest when he told Steve that drinking helped him sleep because it really did. He would sleep soundly through the night if he had something to drink beforehand and if he had any nightmares, they would be dulled. They wouldn't have the same horrifying, panic-inducing effect that would shock him out of sleep if he were sober. That was the worst part of the nightmares and honestly, he didn't want to go through it while a bunch of strangers monitored him on closed-circuit television. So, the distress was a good thing. It kept him awake and therefore kept the nightmares away.
"Will do, Sir."
"Or you can just skip the extraneous effort and just fall asleep right now." Steve let out a deep sigh.
"Look," Tony said. "I didn't mean to upset you, but I knew this would be hard for you, especially seeing all of this." Tony gestured around the room. Steve nodded but didn't say anything. Tony inhaled and exhaled a deep breath. "The main reason why I did this was that I knew S.H.I.E.L.D. was going to give you the sunshine and rainbows version of the past seven decades. It's a nice fable, but it's not the reality you need to hear. There are things in our past that we'd rather forget and while we've come a long way, we've still got a long way to go. I know you've lost a lot and me saying this doesn't make any of it better, but… You've got to keep moving forward. I don't mean forget the past or get over it or anything like that, but you're here now and there's no changing that. You're not alone, though. I'll help you with anything you need. I just want to move forward with you. Is that alright?"
talk about sex," Tony said. "Safe sex, likes and dislikes, consent… You know, just so we're on the same page when the time finally comes."
Anyone who doesn't understand what I'm talking about obviously isn't familiar with the Boondock Saints. To which, I say thank God. (I recognize that it is not objectively a good movie, but I still can't help but love it.)

The other board members were just as silent as Fair. Tony allowed the silence to linger a little longer, just o really let the shame and guilt set in. Eventually, though, he had to break it.
"Well, prepare to be disappointed," Oswin said in response.
They stood there for a few minutes, just enjoying the embrace. However, eventually, Tony felt compelled to pull back.
"To ascension and beyond," Margot repeated. She pulled his hand closer to her mouth and kissed the palm when a knock was heard at the door.
"You know, we probably have enough time to squeeze one last kiss in there." Steve reflected his smile.
So, he spent all his energy lying perfectly still and waiting for sleep to come. He had turned out all the lights and pulled the curtains shut so it was absolutely pitch black in the room aside from the glow of his Arc Reactor. He didn't have anything to drink outside of that one glass of scotch in the limo earlier. In fact, he had barely anything to eat following the press conference. His stomach was volatile and he had moved the waste bin next to his bed just in case he threw up. Overall, Tony Stark was not a happy camper.
"No, you're not," Steve said for what felt like the billionth time. "People don't get this drunk unless something's wrong."
Silence filled the room. Stark seemed to be struggling to process the information. His expression was completely blank. Natasha was starting to worry that something might be seriously wrong when he finally spoke up.
Ohohoho, do I have a lot of feelings about this topic. Honestly, I'm pretty happy with this chapter as it gave me a creative means to vent. I don't like the TV show Intervention. There are a lot of obvious reasons; it profits off of people's addictions and mental illnesses; it emphasizes the drama and doesn't do much to use the platform to educate the masses about addiction; etc. My biggest problem with it is that it's entire premise hinges on the idea that interventions are helpful when the truth of the matter is that there is little evidence to support that. To quote Joel L. Young, MD writing for Psychology Today, "there's little data on the effectiveness of interventions, perhaps because effectiveness is difficult to define. Addicts are more likely to seek treatment when they undergo an intervention, but interventions don't affect the outcome of the treatment itself. If an addict seeks treatment without being fully committed to a life of sobriety - as some might to in response to the overwhelming peer pressure of an intervention - he or she may be less likely to get better."
"Betty," he said. "The results on the lipstick stain came back! You'll never believe this!"
"It is." Steve moved his hand to rest gently on Tony's shoulder. "Trust me."
"Yeah," Tony said. "You've said it multiple times actually, and each time you're clearly walking away still upset about it, so that leads me to believe you aren't really saying what's on your mind." Lara frowned.
"I'm out of prison," he tried explaining again. "Legally out of prison. I didn't escape or anything crazy like that. I served my full sentence and got out fair and square."
Pulling his arm off his eyes, Steve looked around to find that it was much later than he thought it was. While earlier if he looked out the window, he could still see golden rays of sunshine glinting of the sides of the surrounding buildings, now all he could see was the violet-black glow that the sky took on, denoting nighttime in New York City. Also, someone had turned the living room lights on, and turning his head to the side gave him a clear indication as to who.
Anyways, I hope you all are having a Merry Christmas! Have fun to celebrate capitalism and consumerism! I, meanwhile, am going to be trying to convince my mom that we need to hold an intervention for my aunt (my family's fucked.)
"Do you really think I'm going to do that?" he said. "Hell no. I spent the last decade in jail and I swore to myself I wouldn't die there. I swore that I'd make it back to Audrey and Stephanie…" He tried to take another swig from the bottle but found that it was empty. He threw it out into the ocean in anger and it sank rather than float back up to the surface. "Nah, man. I'm not going back to jail, and you can't make me."
This went beyond "too good to be true"; it was near miraculous and Tony wasn't one to believe in miracles. There was a rational explanation for this, but the only rational explanation was more questionable and full of holes than the idea of a miracle. For once in his life, the workings of the world around him completely baffled Tony and he didn't like that much.
Does anyone else feel faint? No, just me? Awesome.
Steve was shaking hands with Congresswoman Giffords. He couldn't hear exactly what he was saying, but whatever it was it made her smile. She slowly thanked Steve for whatever he said before turning back to join a man Tony assumed was her husband. When Steve turned back, Tony had to resist the urge to passionately kiss him right then and there.
That's when he got an idea…
"They want to talk to you about yesterday." Tony squeezed his eyes shut.
"Believe me," he said. "If I could solve all your problems with the push of a button, I would."
"I drew a line?" Steve looked at her like "what other explanation were you expecting?"
To his left, Pepper was gathering all her things and getting herself organized to leave while to his right, Conroy was intently focused on her laptop, trying to get her own notes copied and saved for the next day. Tony sat with his head in his hands, desperately trying to remember what it felt like to be healthy. Unfortunately, he couldn't really remember that far back. Eventually, Conroy shut her laptop and let out a long, exhausted sigh.
