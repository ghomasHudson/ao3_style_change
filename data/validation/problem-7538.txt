Tony sucked in air, peeking down to watch Steve as he very intentionally, very slowly began unfastening the button and then the zipper of his pants. “Not playing fair, Cap, you know how long I’ve waited--”
He cut off with a strangled sound as Steve forced his arms up higher, getting both wrists trapped with one of his own hands, while the other dropped to grope between Tony’s legs. “Okay--yeah, no,
“You and me, we’ve got a history of winding up too tight and then going for each other’s throats,” Tony muttered. There was a bitter amusement in his tone. He turned around at last, leaning back against the computer station with complete nonchalance; he even crossed his fucking ankles, and his hands slid into his pants pockets as if he wasn’t concerned in the slightest about what Steve might do. It made Steve want to shake him. “No, I guess I don’t blame you for being pissed at me. No more than I blamed you for being afraid to let Banner loosen up, back when we were all on the helicarrier.”
“Together.” He kept his tone level, not raising his voice. Regardless of his anger at Tony for what he had done behind their backs--and for dragging Bruce into helping him with it, which Steve
out on your stupidly fine ass.”
Rolling his eyes, Steve shifted his position to keep his balance without having to let Tony get back on his feet. “Or you could just ask for a good hard fuck whenever you need it. I’d prefer not having to deal with homicidal machinery in between rounds.”
Finally, Steve swayed enough to let Tony ease back to the floor, and he eased his spent cock out of the other man, then lifted the hem of his shirt to check and make sure the bruises he’d left weren’t signs of worse injury. “I know you will. And we’re gonna help you.” Leaning forward, he pressed a gentle kiss to the darkest of the bruises, which held hints of distinct finger-shaped lines curling around Tony’s hip. He heard the soft inhale from above his head; he’d surprised Tony.
Steve’s frustration was mounting by the second as Tony deflected and rejected any blame sent his way. Bruce was clearly uncomfortable, explaining the work they had been attempting in full and showing ready remorse for the crisis that had come from it; but Tony was hard-faced, unapologetic even when Thor seized him by his shirt front and got right in his face about endangering them by trying to take control of the mind stone.
Steve’s hand slammed against the wall as he thrust forward with a hard snap of his hips, burying himself to the base in Tony’s ass and savoring the much louder sound, almost a yelp, that tore out of him in response. “Hence the takin’ my time on prep. But you’re open enough, now...”
He pushed his suit pants down only as far as he needed to in order to free his cock, using the remainder of his spit from opening Tony up to give himself a few strokes. “You got a safeword, Tony?”
“I’ll continue hunting it,” Thor confirmed, still glaring at Tony’s back. “Contact me if you need me to return.” With that, he turned and stalked out.
for me. And then, I’m going to keep fucking you until I get off, maybe let you come again--I don’t care if it’s dry--but you’re doing it without a single touch to your dick because you are so fucking stubborn and pigheaded--”
sound with a nice, sharp pop. “Don’t need one. Whatever you do, Cap, I’m going to fucking enjoy it. Bruises and aches the next day are just perks of good sex. And--”
The lab door slid shut with its usual secure hiss, and Tony let out a long, contented sigh as he fastened his belt, completely unbothered by the streaks of his own release cooling on his skin beneath the fabric. Steve’s was slowly dripping from his hole and making the seat of his suit pants slick, but it was nothing that dry cleaning couldn’t handle.
Tony gasped, jerking back enough for Steve to see that his eyes were almost black, his pupils dilated almost comically as he clawed at Steve’s shoulders. “Do it--”
--” Steve’s hands dropped back to his hips, hoisting him higher up against the wall. Distantly he registered that Tony was actually keeping his arms raised--either too involved in the heat of the moment, or too blissed-out from his own orgasm to try and maintain his normal levels of sass.
--she rose as well, following the others out of the room.
“Oh, my God, you talk too much,” Steve muttered. He hooked his hands underneath Tony’s thighs, lifting the smaller man off of his feet. Tony gave a shocked grunt and promptly locked his legs around Steve’s hips, and Steve couldn’t have choreographed it better as he felt his cock slide along the heated line of Tony’s ass. “Lube--”
Tony’s eyes swept over each member of the team in turn, not looking for forgiveness, but rather seeming determined to make them see his point. There was an underlying pain when he reminded them of the army that had come down through the wormhole, almost an edge of panic as he described the glimpse he had gotten when he had taken the missile up there. Something far bigger, worse, stronger than anything that they had faced together to date.
Oh, fucking hell. Steve’s face darkened, his breath hitching a little as more restless anger simmered up through him. “I wanted to keep us all safe. Bruce didn’t resent that.” He licked his lips, and Tony’s eyes fell to his mouth. The itch deepened under Steve’s skin. “You’re pushing me on purpose, Stark.”
Steve huffed, unfolding his arms and taking a few steps closer. “Those lectures were designed for selling war bonds and scolding school kids in detention. I don’t think saying ‘I’m not angry, just disappointed’ will do much, in this case.”
He gave a particularly hard thrust of his hips, bottoming out inside of Tony, and Steve grinned at the raw noise that it earned him. “I can feel that, right here,” he rumbled, pressing his palm firmly against Tony’s throat. “Can feel your breath and every sound you make for me.” His other hand tightened over Tony’s wrists, drawing them a little higher up the wall; it forced Tony’s spine to arch, pushing his hips down more sharply and impaling him harder on Steve’s cock. “Fuck, now
He could feel Tony trying to move his hands, sliding his fingers underneath the collar of Steve’s shirt. With a dark chuckle, Steve adjusted; he seized both of Tony’s wrists, yanking them up over his head and slamming them back against the wall, held immobile in his grip. He was more than strong enough to hold Tony suspended there, especially with some of the man’s weight still being supported by his legs around Steve’s waist as he was rocked back against the wall with every continued thrust. “Motherfucker, Cap, c’mon--’M dyin’ here--”
Getting both of Tony’s wrists trapped in one of his hands, Steve lowered the other until his fingertips settled at the base of Tony’s throat. He could feel the man’s pulse, hammering hard enough to almost be visible, thrumming beneath the skin.
“Christ, such language,” Tony groaned, thudding his head back again as he bucked forward into Steve’s touch. “Boy scout bullshit, indeed...foul-mouthed motherfucker--”
And of course, it meant that the team could discuss, as Tony and Bruce had moved at once to move Ultron’s lanky form--corpse? Was a machine ever alive?--back to the table it had come from.
“Security footage of the lab saved to an encrypted file and emailed to your personal server only,” she confirmed in her soothing Irish accent. “Footage is deleted from Avengers-accessible surveillance. Only you can approve anyone seeing the last hour in this room.”
Steve intervened, stopping Thor from causing Tony actual bodily harm, but he couldn’t pretend that he didn’t feel a flicker of the same serious rage, himself.
---and then dropping both of his hands to the brunette’s hips. “You’re a lightweight by comparison.” He could see the battle waging in Tony’s eyes; they glowed like amber as he flicked his glance upward, seemingly depating, and Steve clicked his tongue in teasing reprimand.
When he pulled his fingers free, Tony made a sound of disapproval, and Steve rolled his eyes as he pressed his spit-slick fingers to the other man’s mouth. “Don’t you start,” he growled, pointedly ignoring Tony’s smirk as he closed his lips around the digits and sucked tauntingly. “I promise, you’re gonna prefer what’s coming next.”
Steve kissed him again, biting at his bottom lip just harshly enough to make Tony shudder. “You can ask, but there’s no promise I’m gonna give you whatever it is,” Steve rumbled, and he reveled in the way that Tony’s entire body trembled from the groan that he let out. “Just so we’re clear, I’m still
Tony let out a shocked sound, rutting forward helplessly. Looking down, Steve saw that he was already leaking pre-come, leaving a darkened streak along the hip of Steve’s own pants. “Messy bitch,” he muttered, smirking. “I think I’m going to need to make you scream for me, Stark."
The setup for a snarky little callback was too perfect to pass up. Steve knew his face had to look smug as he tilted his head just a little, looking Tony up and down with the same cocky self-righteousness that he knew he’d radiated when they’d been seconds from breaking into a fist fight on the helicarrier, right before Clint’s arrow had blown through the propellers. “Oh, I’m starting to want you to make me.”
Once he was four-fingers deep, Steve was more than ready to drop the niceties and get things moving.
Steve reached between their bodies, his fingers closing tightly around Tony’s cock and using the man’s own pre-come to slick his palm before giving the shaft a few swift, hard strokes. He grinned smugly at the tortured sound that he got in return, letting his hand slide back further until Steve’s fingers could tease over Tony’s balls, back to his taint. “You will for me.”
“Nope. I just stay that big,” Steve retorted, grinning smugly at the raw sound that Tony let out at the words. “Guessin’ I’ve just earned myself another faithful cockslut on the team, huh?”
“You seriously--are having no fucking problem, holding me up, are you,” Tony panted against the side of his neck, and Steve gave a hoarse chuckle. “Christ, I should’ve tried to piss you off this hard years ago.”
Steve’s vision nearly went white from the force of pleasure that exploded through him as his climax hit. The lingering cognizant part of his brain was vaguely relieved that he had moved his hand away from Tony’s throat, because Steve knew the kinds of bruises he could leave when he was in the heat of it--sex, a fight, whatever. There was a damned compelling reason that he tended to go through half a dozen punching bags any time he had the chance to hit the gym.
As soon as he was in, Tony gave a low, groaning cry, ducking his face to hide against the side of Steve’s throat. “Jesus--I knew, your suit does jack-shit to hide how thick you are--but
Tony’s breathing was more ragged now, and he was no longer fighting for control; Steve could feel him relax, trusting the blonde man’s hold on him and focusing instead on writhing as much as his pinned position would allow, almost managing to use Steve’s cock to fuck himself. “Close--I’m--”
It wasn’t clear if it was his words, or the intensity of the fucking, or even just the fantastic sounds of their bodies slamming together. But Tony finally broke, letting out a shout that might just have escalated into a proper scream if his vocal cords weren’t being compressed along with his airway under the unyielding force of Steve’s hand.
Keeping his pants on with Clint had been a matter of kink; now, with Tony, it was back to being situational necessity, like it had been with Natasha. Steve had no doubt that Nat would have subtly locked the lab door behind them all, but that didn’t mean he needed to keep his ass on display if anyone came back.
the scientist could not have felt okay about--he wanted to get through to Tony, not just back him into a defensive corner.
“Then we’ll do that together, too,” he countered, but it did make something in his chest clench with fear. That was not something that Steve particularly enjoyed experiencing. “Let’s--just call it, for tonight,” he went on, forcing his voice to remain steady. “Dr. Cho, can you help Maria finish--” The doctor nodded, moving over to take the tweezers that Maria was using to carefully extract glass splinters from the soles of her feet. Clint drifted away from the wall at once to assist, letting Maria hook her arm over his shoulders so that she didn’t need to apply any weight to her feet, half-hopping and half-limping along as Clint and Cho guided her from the lab.
From the choked-off whines and moans escaping from him around the intrusion of Steve’s tongue, the shorter man definitely didn’t appear to object.
Steve took one more step, which brought them officially into each other’s personal space. “Guess so. And every time, I end up wanting to slam you against a wall. Or over the nearest flat surface.”
for anyo--”
Withdrawing his hand--Steve smirked when Tony responded with a low whine of protest--he sucked his fingers, getting a taste of the shorter man’s pre-come and making his skin slick so that when he reached back between Tony’s thighs, he was able to start pressing into him with more intention. “I don’t hate you, Tony--never have, and never will.” He worked one finger in to the first knuckle, grinning when Tony groaned and let his head thud back against the wall again. “This is just
. You’re angry
“Nope.” Tony emphasized the
Smirking, Steve slid his hand around Tony’s thigh and tugged him a step away from the wall, twisting him around to put him facing the wall. Using his other hand, Steve delivered a pair of good, hard swats to Tony’s bare ass, leaving a lovely pink handprint on each cheek. “Cap, what the fuck--”
“Quiet,” Steve said shortly, knowing that his continued smirk would soften the heat of the order. He released Tony’s vest and caught his wrists, pinning them level with his shoulders. Following the momentum of the moment, Steve surged forward, reinforcing the command for silence with a hard, borderline savage kiss.
“I get to top at some point,” Tony grumbled, but then he squeezed his inner muscles, gasping when Steve reacted promptly by tightening his fingers on the smaller man’s hips again. “Yeah, okay, fuck--Goddamn, gonna need to mold a fucking dildo based on this monster. Pep will go insane to see me taking it...” He tipped his head back against the wall, smiling faintly. “Jokes aside, though...I’m gonna fix it, Steve.”
Steve almost hoped it stained. He wouldn’t let Tony discard the soiled garment, either.
And then Ultron revealed himself, staggering into the main space on incomplete legs, dragging wires and cords in his wake and emitting literal sparks when everything erupted into chaos.
An affronted noise escaped Tony. “I don’t
The spark lit in Tony’s eyes as he recognized his own taunt. He reached out one hand, no hesitation or caution in the movement, seemingly going for Steve’s shirt front--and somehow it was that self-assurance that made the itch snap into fire, blazing under Steve’s skin.
“Well, fucking you with insufficient prep would be leaving anger behind and heading into sadism,” Steve shot back, twisting his hand to get the one finger in all the way. “I want to drive my point home, but I need your ass to be able to handle what I dish out. Literally and otherwise.” He did take Tony’s impatience into account, though, and sped up the task of making sure that the dark-haired man was stretched enough. Steve knew what was minimally safe, and he knew that his size was nothing to sneeze at.
And more importantly, Tony did not react in a manner that would have prompted an apology, even if Steve had instantly rushed to prepare one. The dark-haired man’s eyes leapt back to Steve’s, widening, his pupils expanding, and his lips parted to let out a startled exhalation that sounded--at least in Steve’s ears--like something tauntingly close to an aborted groan.
Steve yanked hard, drawing Tony’s pants and briefs down in one swift movement and making him stutter off in shock at suddenly being bare from the waist down. Steve only had to duck down for a moment to get them completely off, along with the man’s gleaming Italian leather shoes--not a thing he was fucking wearing could possibly cost less than $1,000, and somehow that was just obnoxiously attractive--and then he was upright again, his hips once more pinning Tony’s to the wall.
“Your take on anger--is pretty chill, then,” Tony growled, and Steve laughed openly at that.
“Spit,” Tony countered, locking his arms around Steve’s shoulders for a little additional support. “‘S good enough--use one of your hands--”
The words flew out without a second thought--and before being drawn into the group dynamic that Natasha and Clint had orbiting around them, Steve might have stuttered and immediately apologized for overstepping. He’d attempted to backtrack in the truck with Nat, after all.
He stepped back, doing up his own pants and glancing up at the ceiling over the door; the line where JARVIS’ presence was normally glowing strongly was off. Of course. Sighing, Steve grabbed his jacket and went to unlock the lab door, glancing back one last time to make sure--
Sighing, Steve looked at Rhodes. “Can you help him off--and be his communications contact, here?” He saw the flash of confusion and then understanding, and Rhodes nodded, looking over at Tony; the other man hadn’t turned around yet. Rhodes murmured an affirmation, following Thor and letting the lab door slide shut behind him with a soft, mechanical hiss.
“Don’t even think about it,” he growled, his fingers moving to the front of Tony’s suit pants. “You want me to continue what I’m doin’, then you’re gonna be fucking well-behaved and keep your damned hands where I put them.”
sex.”
Even better, Steve felt it when Tony shattered into his climax; his entire body went rigid, shuddering between the wall and Steve’s chest as his cock leapt against his stomach, smearing his release over both of their party shirts.
Steve looked to Thor again. “I know you said the trail went cold, but can you--”
“We’re the Avengers--we can bust arms dealers all the livelong day, but...that up there, that’s the endgame. How were you guys planning on beating that?” Tony’s face was both hard and scared, a mixture of emotions that Steve was not used to seeing on the billionaire’s handsome features. He looked more tired than the super soldier had ever seen him.
“You’re good to me.”
is pretty.”
pissed about the Ultron issue.”
disappointed.”
The pre-come wouldn’t be enough, but it worked for a tease; Steve let the tip of his middle finger rub over Tony’s entrance, feeling how the furled muscle quivered and clenched against the suggestion of penetration. “Have you never--”
of Tony’s ass clenching down around his cock from the intensity of his orgasm. Steve had fully intended to drag this out, and to try and get that threatened second round out Tony--but goddamn, it felt as if he was trying to literally milk it out of the older man. And Steve didn’t feel any need to deny himself.
But this was Steve. Steve, who thought Tony didn’t like him anymore and was still somehow willing to be ignored as long as it made Tony happy. And Tony felt like such an asshole, Christ, but he was going to fix it. With a totally-not-date.
Tony licked his lips, his eyes moving restlessly from Steve, to their position, to Steve’s crotch and back again. “So are you just going to stare at me or…”
Steve straightened, quickly pulling off his own clothes, and raised an eyebrow at Tony. “Better now?”
This was getting ridiculous. Steve was down to one gray SHIELD sweater and a plaid button-down. At first he thought he was imagining it, that he was simply misplacing his clothes. The last he’d see them was after exercising where he threw his sweaty shirts on the ground to be cleaned later. His wardrobe really was getting smaller each week.
“See, that’s the problem!” Tony let go of him and spread his arms to indicate the room. “This is all a big problem and I don’t understand why you’re here. You’re a smart guy, Steve, so what are you doing?”
“What do you mean you can’t?”
Tony was trapped, desperate to come but held against an immovable force. He struggled, trying to push himself back onto Steve’s cock, but it was no use. Steve simply hummed, nuzzling into the side of Tony’s neck, scattering kisses into his skin. Tony stopped trying to move, realizing he was truly at Steve’s mercy, dropping his warm head onto the coolness of the counter.
“So.” Tony turned to face Steve and shrugged. “Toilets are important. Repulsor tech is the future.”
“So what? Am I supposed to go up to him and ask him out to dinner?”
The next morning when Tony woke up hungover, he grumbled and muttered lots of nonsensical things that Steve was fairly certain were gibberish. He nodded dazedly at Steve, who was still sitting in the chair next to the couch, and moved towards the elevators to get to his room. And later Tony showed up to the kitchen with sunglasses on, still muttering and glaring at Clint, who was threatening to consume the rest of the coffee just to fuck with Stark. Tony finished his breakfast, flashed a quiet grin in Steve’s direction, and returned to the workshop.
“Does it hurt? I didn’t get carried away, did I?”
He frowned. “What is it?”
This was better than last time, he decided. It probably had something to do with not being worried over his team’s reactions. Having the focus of five different people, having them possibly judging him, was a bit nerve-wracking. Tony had a well-documented history of letting people down, and he knew he would just get in their way if he’d ever join their team bonding time.
“I know I must be ugly to look at now.”
This could work. He brought his other hand to trail down his abdomen, painting teasing circles on his flesh, before grasping his hardening cock in a loose grip. He was definitely into this.
“You sure you don't want any help?” Steve asked, tilting his head. It was rather adorable -- no, bad Stark, you're supposed to be getting away. “You did seem to like our help last time.”
“While I was asleep.”
Being freed sent Tony into a coughing fit, but just as he finished luxuriating in his breaths, he was pushed back onto the cock. These thrusts were kept shallow but Tony knew that Steve was aiming to get back into his throat. While he anticipated that, he sucked at the cock, laving his tongue over the head, humming along the entire length, pulling all the stops he knew. He was ready this time when Steve pushed down his throat. He moaned at the heavy, hot weight in his mouth and grounded eagerly into his hand.
Tony sighed. “Okay. Steve. Please don’t punch me.” And then Tony lifted himself to his tiptoes and kissed him.
Steve smirked at Tony’s astonishment. “I’m nowhere near done with you.”
“Yes, dear,” Steve said, bending down to kiss him sweetly. He ran his fingers through Tony’s soft locks and Tony felt he could almost purr at the sensation.
“I’m Tony.” Tony shoved his hand at him and Steve grudgingly shook it.
“Brucie, if I was seriously sick, I would tell you. I promise. I’m being honest that I’m perfectly fine right now.”
With an exaggerated sigh, Tony turned back to his floor-length mirror, fixing his bow tie in the reflection. “I really don’t have time for your macho posturing,” he said. “Why don’t you save that for the debriefs?”
“So this really doesn’t bother you?”
So Tony had been avoiding him. Which was fine, you know, it was Tony’s decision. If Tony didn’t want to be friends with him anymore, then Steve needed to respect that. Boundaries. Besides he had probably been annoying Tony too much. Tony was always working and he just took up residence in the workshop, not caring if he was a distraction. Really, Steve should have realized this. Just because they weren’t at each other’s throats like back at the helicarrier didn’t mean that they were the best of friends.
Clint braced a hand on Tony’s shoulder as he bottomed out, his balls pressed up against the curve of Tony’s ass. He gave Tony a few moments to get used to the sensation, before pulling out and thrusting back in. Tony let his head hang down with a moan. He never expected to enjoy the feeling of being fulfilled, of being stuffed with a fat cock. He whimpered as the cockhead hit his prostate, his hands scrabbling against the countertop.
(With those tired but beautiful brown eyes and mussed up hair and—)
“You know, I just came up here to get some coffee and I’m feeling so attacked right now.”
Tony turned to give him a sort of terrified look and Steve wondered what he’d done to make Tony look at him like that. “Why would we need to talk? I thought everything was… peachy keen?”
“Shush.” But Steve couldn’t help but grin, adding another finger. It was a tight fit, the muscles surrounding his digits were relaxing incrementally. He pushed them deeper and found what he was looking for, touching Tony’s prostate.
“Tell me what?” His voice was barely more than a whisper.
“Of course you will. And when you do, I’ll tell you all about what I think about these hands.” Steve ducked his head to press a kiss to each of the four visible fingertips. Tony gaped at him. “Come on, time for bed.”
And he’d imagine taking those hands, holding them in his own, kissing the hardened tips of the fingers. He’d imagine those hands undressing Steve eagerly, sliding down his abdomen, unzipping his pants and pulling out his hard cock. Stroking him, as Tony would lean in and whisper in his ear about how much he wanted him.
“You cheeky little—” Tony grinned when Steve laughed. Steve rested his head on Tony’s shoulder, giving him a satisfied smile. “I love you.”
“Sir is currently experiencing an increased heart rate and heightened ar—”
Tony’s hands were in his pockets and his shoulders were hunched, as if trying to make himself look as small as possible. He gave Steve a bashful sort of look, which was a word Steve never thought he would associate with Tony. “It’s not you, I was just… I don’t know how to explain it.”
“Am I supposed to automatically accept your apology? Is that why I’m an asshole? You’re not any better than me. I know you probably tell yourself that every time we interact, but just ‘cause you wear a flag it doesn’t mean you’re morally superior to me.”
“Captain, if I may insist, there is nothing wrong with allowing yourself to indulge. Especially after Dummy’s inexcusable—”
That shouldn’t have been so arousing but Tony never did care for convention. He moaned around the length and reached a hand down to his clothed erection, pressing the heel of his hand against the head. He licked along the shaft as it pumped in and out and managed to relax his gag reflex in time for Steve to shove himself down his throat.
Tony grunted and shook his head as Steve left the workshop.
Tony moaned in surprise which Steve took advantage of, dipping his tongue in briefly before retreating, as if promising more pleasure to come. Steve broke the kiss and leaned back, smirking down at Tony’s shocked expression. “Turns out Rhodey was right.”
“Do you remember what we talked about last night?” There. That was a good way to ease into the topic.
, as if Dummy was a teenager caught up in self-centered angst. This was ridiculous.
Tony moaned weakly when he felt Steve’s hand circle around his cock. All it took was one sharp tug for his climax and he barely reacted to it, shaking in Natasha’s arms, his mind turning to mush. He could feel Steve slowly pull out of him and he thought about protesting. He wanted to keep Steve inside him always.
Tony’s hands lost their swelling and recovered to the point that the casts got switched out for splints. And whenever they were lounging together, watching TV, or sitting next to each other eating, Steve would take one or both of Tony’s hands into his lap. He would kiss them, feel along their sides, caress those four naked fingers, or simply hold them. Tony never complained, but he always got this sort of dazed look, as if he couldn’t comprehend why Steve acted so enamored.
“Tones, I can’t just drop everything over here ‘cause you say so,” Jim replied, his voice warm despite the admonishment.
“I would if you bothered to show up,” Cap retorted. He glared at him through the reflection but Tony didn’t stop fixing his outfit. He had a very important charity gala tonight, thanks to Pepper’s threatening email reminder, and he didn’t have the time or energy to deal with Captain Stick-up-his-ass.
“You’re injured.”
“Why would Tony be mad?”
“If I may, sir, Dummy really did mean this as a way to show you how much you matter to him,” JARVIS said.
“It’s fine. Really. And no to the bath, thank you though.”
Tony can imagine Natasha would be unbearably smug if she knew what he was considering.
“What are you, some sort of indie director?” Tony muttered, ignoring the camera lens shoved into his face. This new hobby of Dummy was irritating but at least he wasn’t going trigger-happy with the fire extinguisher. Though this was easier when Steve was the subject of Dummy’s new art project. “The least you could do is give me some coffee. I don’t even know why I keep you here; should’ve kept you in storage.” The camera was thrust even further into Tony’s space before he slapped it away. “Hey, I’m working here!”
It wasn’t until Steve managed three fingers in him that he was satisfied; he kept jerking Tony throughout it and avoided brushing against his prostate. He glanced at Tony and grinned when he saw his expression. “You’re evil,” Tony grumbled, straining against Steve’s hands.
He crossed the room in long strides and peered into the bag. The toy was put back into its packaging, and the remote control was actually returned.
One afternoon had him sitting on a stool at a workbench in his shop, grinding his hips against the seat, staring at the blueprints JARVIS had projected for him. He was trying and failing to focus, his cock hard and leaking, and he was considering whether to get himself off then or prolong the sweet torture. He steepled his fingers against his temple, breathing slowly.
“And I won’t lie: Dummy has been creeping me out lately.” They both looked at the bot, who was so overjoyed at this latest development that he missed the disapproving stares aimed at him. “How did he get the idea for all of this?”
Their first date went well. So did their second. And third, and fourth. When they had their first date, Steve took Tony to a small burger place he frequented often, where he knew the owners and patrons won’t pay much mind to the two Avengers. Besides knowing cheeseburgers to be Tony’s favorite food, Steve figured it would be an easy food for Tony to hold with his injured hands. Tony seemed to almost forget about his hands; he was too busy telling Steve lame chemistry jokes to remember.
“I’m fine! It’s just a bit strained, is all.”
“I’m sorry for what I said on the helicarrier.”
He turned off the plug and stood up to stretch, wondering idly if Bruce had figured it out or if he was just being paranoid.
“Well, that was before this whole weird obsession thing was going on. And You has anger issues, like seriously, what’s his problem with ice cube trays?” Tony shook his head. “God, worse than Bruce, at least Bruce has a reason to be angry.”
“Are you fucking serious?” he groaned when he saw that damned blown up picture of Steve sitting on his bed. “Are you—Dummy!”
Tony felt himself begin to float off, no longer concerned about needing to come, enjoying Steve’s solid weight pressing down all around him. Before he could truly relax, however, a wolf whistle broke him out of his reverie.
Except now Tony didn’t look hurt. In fact Tony looked completely fine, except for the fact he looked completely terrified like he was expecting Steve to hit him.
“Whatever. Let’s just go eat.”
Butterfingers and You forgot their quarrel and gathered round Dummy, as he connected the camera to Tony’s main computer and a holographic interface popped up. It showed a blue-tinged video of Steve in the gym, pounding away at a punching bag; he paused momentarily to glance at the camera. “Hey, Dummy, how are you?” He patted the top of the camera before moving his attention back to his exercise.
Steve chuckled, turning back towards the extravagant tub that had ample room for a super soldier. “JARVIS, that’s cheating.”
“Hey, Cap, you’re looking very good, very healthy. All that cardio.” He reached out for Steve’s bicep before remembering himself and pulling back. “Uh, science! Right. I need to go do science now!”
“What did you find?”
“Yeah, no thanks. But Tony’s so irritating! I’d be in an elevator with him and he’d just smile. He probably thinks this is a fucking riot.”
Tony blinked after him and the workshop door swished close. That was a complete 180 than from what he expected.
Steve nodded. “Turn your damn music off.”
It was about four in the afternoon when Steve realized that it didn’t look like Tony was going to address last night any time soon.
Well, fuck him.
He can see Natasha reach for Steve’s abandoned apple on the counter and take a bite out of it, as she tilted her head at him. “Why are you so shy now, Tony? I thought you were liking having your ass pounded.”
“I think Tony’s mad at me.”
She shook her head. “Just talk to him. Then get back to me when it’s all sorted out.”
“Well, you work a guy up and then don’t deliver.”
Dummy hung his arm down, shaking still, looking down on the ground. Tony glanced up at the picture of Steve. It was one of Tony’s favorite pictures of him; after a particularly grueling battle the whole team had collapsed in the rec room. They popped in a cheesy 80s flick and ordered in Thai food. Thor had taken several photos that night on his prototype Stark phone and Tony later hacked into the phone to download the photo onto his servers. Steve had thrown his head back, laughing, blue eyes looking so bright and happy, his grin infectious.
“Well, yes. Otherwise we would be in the bedroom right now.” Tony did a double take. Steve had a very good poker face.
“You don’t seem all right. Is something wrong?” He moved closer to him but Tony ducked out of the way so fast that Steve blinked in confusion. “Um—”
“Why would I be angry? I mean, I admit I was surprised—okay, very surprised,” he amended when he saw the skeptical look on Tony’s face. “When I came up here, I thought you were hurt.”
Clint grunted an affirmative.
“Video…”
“If Tony doesn’t want to speak to me, then I should respect that.”
He’d deny it later, but Tony did whimper.
“No, it isn’t. You always keep the temperature in here at 64 degrees.” Bruce shifted his glasses, considering him. “Don’t tell me you have a fever. I thought JARVIS constantly monitored your vitals and made sure you take care of yourself.” Before Tony could insist that he was fine, perfectly healthy, his straining cock being an example of how perfectly healthy he was right now, Bruce asked JARVIS for his vitals.
Tony glanced up once Steve entered his workspace – his expression brightened instantly and he greeted Steve with a grin. He leaned towards his desktop and lowered the volume of the speakers enough so they wouldn’t have to shout at each other.
He could hear the almost inaudible swoosh of the door and froze. Shit, he forgot to tell JARVIS to make sure he was undisturbed.
And there he was. Shirtless, on his stomach, mouth open, a fine line of drool lingering on the corner of his lips and ending on the pillow. Dummy made a soft, high beep before focusing his camera on the sleeping man.
“You’re a real asshole sometimes.”
Steve smiled at him. “Despite your flaw of waking people with rock music, I do like being with you.” Before Tony could protest that, Steve kissed him again. He placed his other hand at Tony’s waist, bringing him even closer, and deepened the kiss. Tony relaxed into it and his hands wandered over Steve’s back, pausing to grab Steve’s ass and pull his lower half closer.
“Seriously, Steve. You are too sympathetic to him, you know he’s just a robot, right? Not even a good one.”
“Always so desperate for it,” Steve groaned, his fingers clenching tightly in Tony’s hair. “I should’ve done this when I first met you. You would’ve done it happily, too, wouldn’t you? You’re that much a slut.”
One of Rogers’ most admirable and annoying qualities was that the guy just won’t quit. He was possibly the most stubborn person Tony had ever met, which was quite a feat when you consider the company Tony kept.
Tony snorted. “I don’t disobey you for funsies, Cap. I just find better, quicker ways of ending a mission.”
“Just keep it down,” Steve grumbled. He strode stiffly out of the apartment and refused to acknowledge the snickering behind him.
“Hey, J, where is that stupid robot?”
“‘Everything he’s worked on’? Jesus Christ, Dummy, what is
“I always did, Tony. Now sleep. We’ll talk later.”
Okay. Okay, Steve can work with that. Because at least that meant that Tony didn’t hate him. He smiled. “Maybe we can go out to eat and figure it out together? I’ve barely seen you all week.”
And as for Tony’s feelings, well, he could lie and bluff and deflect like he normally would in embarrassing situations, but the thing was he wanted it. He wanted Steve. He wanted to be in a relationship with the guy and do all those corny, lovey-dovey things couples do. After his failed relationship with Pepper, he figured he’d never have a shot at real love again. But Steve actually liked him for some weird reason, and he would laugh at all of Tony’s dumb jokes like they were the funniest shit he’d ever heard. And sometimes Steve would look at Tony with his blue eyes and Tony would think that maybe he feels it too.
Fuck, he was so tight. Steve rocked slowly into him, rubbing comforting circles into Tony’s hipbones with his thumbs. Tony’s body relented and Steve sunk deeper in.
Tony’s expression darkened. “Fine, go have fun with your super-secret boy band. I don’t care.” And he stormed off like he was doing so often these days.
Dummy was looking at him expectantly and Tony couldn’t help it. He patted his strut. “I know, buddy, I know this is your way of being nice to me. But you and me are going to have a stern talk about boundaries. And you two,” he said in a louder voice, glancing at Butterfingers and You, who were beginning to whine, “we are going to have a lovely chat about the evils of peer pressure, you understand me?” He surveyed the room once more and winced when he found a pile of printed photos of Steve on another table. “Okay, you guys are going to need to clean all this up and—”
“Don’t call me that.”
There had been times where he’d rush at the end of the day to leave the office as soon as his shift was over. Bucky mocked him every time. “You’re so transparent, Stevie.”
“He’s absolutely beautiful, Tasha,” Clint said, elbowing her playfully. “I can’t wait to watch you fuck him.”
Tony smiled, nudging one of Steve's hands with his face as the man pushed him back under the shower spray to rinse his hair off. "I think you better hold off on that press release. People will think you're delirious. Or that you've finally snapped," he said with a chuckle. He pulled Steve back under the spray with him and kissed him hard, his hands sliding down the blonde's slender back. There was nothing erotic in the kiss; it was all emotion. "I love you, Steve Rogers. Scares me to death I nearly lost you. You're not allowed to pull anything like that again, serum or no." They both knew that if Steve did get the serum back and further got back into the field that there was zero chance that the man wouldn't risk his life again if the situation called for it. That didn't mean Tony couldn't have his fantasy.
"Oh. That." Clint had skimmed the memo, assumed it was one of the junior SHIELD members, and left it at that. It was a little different knowing it was someone who struck him as the sort to never get scolded about so much as an overdue haircut, nevermind sucking face in public. He took a sip of his coffee, trying to wrap his head around the idea that Fury's favorite had done anything wrong enough to get a memo blasted out. "I kinda assumed it was a dumb kid. Since you're not a dumb kid, I'm guessing there's more to it than that, and that it's bugging you." Steely eyes watched Steve closely, but there wasn't any sort of judgment in them, just curiosity and a fair amount of concern to boot. Clint liked Steve, and as more than fap fodder. The guy was a good teammate. He'd taken good care of Nat during the whole Loki incident - which was apparently hanging over their heads once again - and had more than proven himself in combat.
"Sounds good," Scott agreed. "All the essentials." He watched Logan drinking and realized how much he was enjoying just sitting with the man and eating greasy food and enjoying a good, cheap beer. Maybe they didn’t deserve the reprieve in the midst of the chaos, but they needed it. "When I start looking - if I start looking - would you come with me?" They wouldn't be getting a place together exactly, but Scott wanted Logan to feel at home wherever he was. He wanted the man to be part of any changes that he made in his life.
Tony's jaw muscles flexed as he stared hard at the god for several long moments. "So, what about now? Still wanna hurt your brother? Rule the world? Or just a world? Because you're not going to get that with the Avengers. You might have to save the world a few times. Maybe even from people who have the same ideas you did. But you're not going to get to step on any more ants." He paused and snorted in amusement. "Well, I guess you've got one chance left. But since you need me to help keep the Avengers from killing you outright, I guess I'm not much of an option, either."
"Hm. Who said it was about you?" Tony countered, a wicked glint in his eye as he continued to trail his fingers along the waistband. He was, frankly, running out of patience himself, and watching Steve worry his lip in anticipation wasn't helping.
Clint paused, his eyebrows flicking up in surprise as he offered a faint smile. "That's good. 'Cause if you cook half as well as your couch is comfy, I wasn’t kidding about that not getting rid of me bit," he joked, tossing the carrots into the salad and starting on the tomatoes. "I mean, I -  ow. Ow! Dammit." He sighed, grabbing a paper towel and wrapping it around one finger. "Okay, so there might be some blood in the salad."
"Yes, apparently I'm owed enough courtesy to be left alive." His fingers curled against his thighs. "Not if he thinks I've killed you, though. None of them would hesitate at that - and most of your friends wouldn't have paused to begin with." Loki allowed, "Not that I blame them for the impulse. I can't say that I have ever been without the will for my own survival, but I can see their point of view on the matter. My idiot brother-" He winced and glanced back up at Tony. "I suppose that's not precisely the title I should use addressing him anymore." The diplomatic angle of his potential new life would be a minefield, but despite that, Loki felt the distinct stirrings of something like hope for the first time in recent memory. "But he is an idiot."
"Friend Hawk, you...?" Thor trailed off at Clint's slow, frightened-looking nod. The god glanced at Sif, frowning. "The hammer was forged by the ice giants. We should ask my mother, but I fear that perhaps only Loki would know the answer."
Clint shifted nervously, torn. Things were escalating, and he had no idea what to do. No scenario that came to his mind ended in anything but one or both of them just getting hurt more. The archer wasn't sure he could handle what was happening right in front of his eyes, though.
Watching the men kissing was lovely. It wasn't the hunger, it was the sweetness beneath it that made her unable to look away. Natasha kept things slow. She was enjoying the show, and she wanted to built Scott's hunger carefully so that he didn't go off like a rocket the second Logan finally slid home. It was better to draw it out. They had awhile before the alcohol wore off and headaches and dehydration became an issue. She didn't want to distract the boys, but Natasha still couldn't resist nipping at the skin of Scott's thigh while she slid in a second finger.
"Okay, then." Still holding Clint's hands, Phil let himself feel a modicum of relief. He knew it wasn't everything. He knew it was miles and miles away from everything. He also knew it was the most he could hope for. "I like touching you. I like spending time with you. I'd even like to go camping with you and see what it's like chasing down a few defenseless animals for sport. I'm actually pretty amazing at Call of Duty even if you could probably take me playing Resident Evil. So... I'd really, really like to try this." He let go of one of Clint's hands to reach out and stroke careful fingers against his cheek. "I want this, but you have to be ready to be all in. I don't mean I expect any kind of commitment, but I don't share. That's a big change, it's a big promise, and you shouldn't make it if you aren't sure you're ready for it."
"Mmmm..." Just the thought of a nice, cozy cabin and nights spent curled up in front of the fire with Tony left him feeling better even if cold wasn’t his favorite by and large. "The cabin. Definitely." Knowing Tony it would be a "cozy" ten bedroom mansion, but it was the thought that counted. "You, me, chilly nights, a warm fire? That sounds pretty close to perfection if you ask me. Then we can get mostly naked and go hang out at the beach next vacation." It was presumptuous to assume that they'd be together for more than one vacation, for long enough to make that happen, but it felt right. Steve believed they would be, and it was as simple as that.
"I'm sure they can," Logan agreed with a smirk. The three made sure their tabs were taken care of, and Logan led the charge back to the SUV. He'd already insisted on getting the keys from Clint before they'd ever entered the club, and the three of them piled into the vehicle and were on the road quickly enough. Logan was pretty glad for the center console next to the driver's seat, because he was pretty sure that he'd otherwise have dragged Scott over next to him and done some breathtakingly distracted driving on the way back.
Clint only had to threaten a junior agent a little to get the cuffs off. Mostly the threats involved asking the kid if he thought the handcuffs would really slow Clint down. After making sure everything in the cell block was as sorted out as it was going to get, Clint found Natasha's location through Jarvis and headed her way as quickly as he could. She was a few feet from Scott's door when he caught up with her. He had it in his head that he was going to ask her how she felt, tell her he missed her, or make some kind of half hearted joke about the whole ordeal. Instead, he all but tackled her and pulled her tight against him, hanging onto her like she'd disappear if he loosened his grip at all. His breathing roughened as he bit back tears, his whole body trembling.
Steve winced. He could just imagine what Bruce was feeling in the wake of everything, what Tony might have said to him. "Give him a little space, okay?" Steve heard his phone chime and retrieved it from the counter, humming softly. "Meeting in thirty with Fury. I... I think I'm gonna sit this one out. Tell them I have a note from my doctor." He lay the phone down on the counter again and crossed his arms as he regarded Tony more seriously. "I meant what I said: you could take over. It may not be forever, but the Avengers need a leader who can go out there and get it done."
Tony smoothed his free hand over Loki's skin, tracing a few of the lines as he wondered what the change meant. He nipped at Loki's chest, letting his nimble tongue flick against one of the god's nipples before he withdrew his fingers and grasped Loki's hips and his own cock.. He tugged at the god, guiding him forward as his eyes drifted up to Loki's face. "Ride me. Please," he added as an afterthought, his voice barely above a whisper.
Logan was pretty sure he was still asleep, but the slightly awkward pause of silence didn't get interrupted by any sort of normally land-bound mammals coming through the window. //Well, that rules that out.// He slowly nodded. "Yeah. Uh, you don't haveta sleep on the floor. SHIELD gave me more bed than I need," he said, patting the unused half of the bed beside him. "Just... if I get noisy in my dreams, make sure you get to a safe distance."
Tony actually jumped at the sudden sound. Feeling oddly nervous at the certainty of who would be with Loki, he took a deep breath and walked across the room. Slowly, hesitantly, he wrapped his hand around the knob and pulled the door open. There was Loki, surrounded by his friends, and... Tony felt his heart skip at the sight of the suit he'd made for his lover. "Steve!" He threw himself at the other man, relieved and frustrated all at once when his hands met with unforgiving armor.
Tony held out his hand for the mug, then put it aside on the nearby table when Steve handed it to him. He grabbed the blonde by his lapel and dragged him into a long, gentle kiss, drawing away with a smile. "'Boyfriend.' I like that," he murmured, hesitating a moment before letting Steve go completely. What he really wanted was to curl up against the muscular blonde and stay there all day. Feeling that was a bit more than he should say at that particular moment, he instead grabbed Steve's coffee cup and finished off what was left in it. "Yeah. Yeah, you were right. Terrible," he said grimacing as he handed his lover the empty mug.
Scott returned the kiss hungrily despite his aching body. "I think," he managed as he finally caught his breath, "you might not be the only one who's compromised." Being into kinky sex was one thing. Being a masochist was another. What Scott felt was a third option that scared him. It made him wonder how much of anything he felt belonged to him and how much was tainted by Loki.
"We're grown ups," Natasha answered simply as she lay down. "You're not just a body pillow," she amended with a sigh. She looked over her shoulder at Clint, gaze sincere. "You're the best friend that I've ever had. It's not what you want, but it's the most I've ever given anyone.
Tony groaned into the more passionate kiss. It didn't have the same crushing weight of need and restrained power that he was used to, but it felt amazing all the same. When they drew apart, Tony was panting faintly. "Bed... Gotta get into the bed," he decided breathlessly, half tugging Steve toward the bedroom. He broke away when they stepped through the door, tugging his shirt off and tossing it to the floor before he looked to his lover. He hadn't missed Steve's uncertainty a moment before, or his nervousness when he'd swapped shirts in front of Tony that morning. Tony settled on the edge of the bed, hands beside his hips and a surprisingly patient look on his face. "If you get nervous or anything, tell me. I don't want you uncomfortable," he said gently, though in truth he was anxious to have Steve naked and pressed against him.
"They t...ake some getting used to," Tony replied, his voice catching as Steve's lips moved across the perfect spot on his neck, near his collarbone. "Repulsors." When Steve's eyes flicked up at him, he clarified in the most distracted voice ever, "They're r... repulsors - and fuck, that's the right spot," he breathed, squirming against his lover. "Besides, you'll heal. Fast." He nibbled at Steve's jaw, not minding the faint saltiness one bit. "Maybe I could... put in... What are we talking about?" he wanted to know, his fingers fairly digging into Steve's back.
Clint put his beer down but didn't look at the interloper directly. "That's mine, ugly."
"No, we don't, Tony," Bruce finally put in.
"I said 'no', playboy," Logan growled, adamantium claws bare millimeters from Stark's face and blue eyes narrowed. "I remember you, now. 'Iron Man'. Ain't so tough without the armor, huh? I don't want anything to do with your freakshow. I've had enough o' you government stiffs and your agendas. Your little Aryan buddy back there might've gotten along just fine when Uncle Sam signed 'im up for guinea pig duty, but I ain't near as impressed."
Tony froze, apple halfway to his mouth as he looked at the god with definite confusion. Was he hallucinating? Had Loki just referred to a mortal as 'good company'? He looked at the fruit in his hand suspiciously and then put it aside. He thought for a moment, wondering just how to respond. While 'first impulse' was usually his style, the situation seemed way too delicate for something like that. Finally, he decided making sure he wasn't just delirious was a good start. "So, is that my cue to leave, or is that you giving me the closest thing to a compliment I'll ever get from you?" he asked, his tone carefully neutral.
"Yeah," Clint agreed, tensing and grunting as he heard the muffled "whump!" of an explosion outside the door and a few pieces of ceiling rained down around them. Hulk accidentally arming a nuclear warhead wouldn’t help their situation. He kept rummaging, now with far less concern as to whether a few doodads ended up on the floor. Another explosion, sounding closer, rattled the shelves, and Clint grunted as a jar bounced off the back of his head, knocking him to the floor. With a groan, he pushed himself up on hands and knees, then froze as he noticed a disconcerting glint at the back of the shelf he was now peering at. "Coulson, I think we found it." He started to reach for it, then hesitated as he felt the hairs on his forearm stand on end. "Seems kinda weird," he muttered, finally forcing himself to grab the handle of the hammer and drag it off the shelf. For its size, the weapon felt bizarrely light in his hand.
"Like I said, I don't know you very well. Believe me when I say that's not something I'd come up with on my own when I'm passing notes from your boyfriend."
"Much better," Victor rumbled, pressing one hand and all his weight into the center of Clint's chest, holding him down as he brushed the backs of his claws against Clint's cheek and watched the man shudder. "Responsive." He glanced up to Phil and smirked tauntingly. "Bet I could play him like a violin, sensitive as he is."
Steve had lost his resolve with Tony's building passion, and it only took him a few more seconds to follow Tony over the edge, his cock grinding into the sheets beneath him. They'd need to be changed in short order, but it was worth it. He sagged, boneless in the aftermath, and sighed, "You're amazing. Not that your ego needs the help, but... you're totally amazing." Steve wriggled enough to turn over underneath Tony so that he could kiss his lover's slack lips.
Clint shivered, watching Victor move back to Phil. Creed was right about that; he could see much, much more than he wanted to now. Unwilling to let it break him, he carefully caught Phil's gaze, hoping that the eye contact would give the man some reassurance.
"We think you can live. That's more than some people can manage," Coulson answered with a hint of a smile. "We think you can take a beating. Tony can do it as Iron Man, Cap can handle it to a point, Thor can stand toe to toe, there's even Hulk, but that's... unpredictable. You can think and fight and probably come through the other side. What else do you think we might need, Logan?"
Logan, tired from his mission, was only able to stay tensely, awkwardly awake for a few minutes longer before passing out. He slept as easily as he ever did, though. Daylight streaming through the window woke him, and he slowly realized he was cuddled up closely to Scott. //Why do I keep wakin' up cuddled up to guys I wouldn't touch with a ten foot pole?// Moving slowly in hopes he wouldn't wake Scott, he carefully started to extract himself from the other man and roll away.
Clint grinned broadly as he sat up on the bed, though he felt a little disappointed that Phil was already moving to get ready. "I'm not sure that that's protocol, but at least it's accurate," he admitted, quickly brushing his teeth and washing his face. He knocked back his stubble a bit, then stepped out of the bathroom, tossing the hand towel he'd used to dry his face on the counter. He settled back on the edge of the bed and rubbed at his face. "We don't have to do anything today, right? Like, the geniuses are upstairs geniusing and I don't have anyone to kill, so..."
It was a thing of beauty to watch the two of them together. Natasha obviously knew not only how to make it feel good but how to make it look good. She even looked over and meet Scott's gaze before finally taking the head of Logan's cock into her mouth. Scott knew the taste well enough that his mouth watered at the thought.
Understanding the consideration Tony was showing, Coulson nodded and rose, taking the helm on Tony's chair. The truth was he wasn't sure he wanted to leave the man alone to deal with whatever they would find down the hall. He met Clint's gaze briefly. "You and Natasha should get some rest. I'll let you know when we have more information or Steve is ready for more visitors."
"I thought it would take at least two cups before he was that perky." Phil had been effectively summoned by the smell of coffee.
"He's sure," Pepper broke in before Tony could answer. "He spends far too much time here alone. If you can get him out of that lab for even a few hours a day, it will be well worth it." Apparently satisfied, Pepper grabbed her briefcase from where she'd dropped it by the door and gave them a wave. "Have fun picking out a room!" she bid Steve before heading back out into the world.
No smut, just friendship and sweetness.
It took Coulson a moment to even understand the words. A slow blink was the only outward sign of the internal processing going on. "May I ask what the benefit to the Avengers might be in that scenario?"
Clint frowned thoughtfully as he laid his bow back on the bar. "Dunno. Five... six... something like that." Clint liked beer. A lot. But he also didn't really make much of a habit of drinking more than one or two at a time. Five or six was more than enough to get him reasonably drunk. It caught up with him a moment later just how stupid his bravado had been, and he sighed, sagging against the bar. "Guess this is where I get the 'you've had enough' speech, huh?"
Steve blushed furiously, and even though he knew that was precisely what Tony had intended for him to do, it didn’t make it any easier to find the words to flirt in return. He didn’t really answer, just flashed Tony a smile and went back to stirring some sauce on the stove. “I gotta admit, it wasn’t that much trouble. I’m not a ‘make the noodles from scratch’ kinda good cook. This is more heating and assembling than cooking.” He nodded toward the oven. “I guess the garlic bread almost counts. There’s the spreading butter, the putting on the garlic… pretty complicated for an old guy.”
Clint stood, too, unsure of what Scott's approach meant and not wanting to be taken by surprise. He'd seen what the man's powers could do; he didn't want to get caught off guard. "Loki has a way of getting to people," he allowed, feeling it'd be a little unfair to completely condemn the other man. "Good that you noticed it. You think we should maybe go to medical and get you looked over?"
Clint pressed a tentative kiss to Phil's lips, then grabbed him and pulled him into one that was far more passionate, more desperate. He realized a moment later that it might be too rough and softened the contact a little before he pulled away, running his hand through Phil's ruffled hair. "I know it will be. I know you'll be there, whatever happens. That's all I need." He leaned in for another kiss, then pressed his forehead to Phil's and groaned when he heard the alarm chime softly.
Coulson couldn't help smiling at that. "I appreciate your enthusiasm. The best lead we have at the moment is a trade cell that seems to be operating in New York City - one of the outer boroughs. We don't have any reason to believe that Mr. Summers has moved through there specifically, but it's the closest point of contact from where he was taken, so it's our best bet for information." The man's smile stretched a bit wider. "How are you at undercover work?"
The lights in the lab came up as he approached, and it gave Steve chills even though he knew it was just Jarvis being hospitable. "Thank you for coming, sir. Forgive the interruption."
Coulson barely resisted the urge to kick the hammer as far away from Clint as he could. It would've been childish, though possibly not an overreaction. Hoping to make up for the probably unwanted contact before, he whispered softly to Clint, "I can't risk losing you again. This thing? It scares me. We both know not a lot of things scare me."
"That would be safest," Scott agreed.
"That's an understatement," Steve answered with a smile before lifting his head long enough to look at the other man's face. "I didn't know you made those." Exhaustion soon made him drop his head back against Tony's shoulder. He shifted his weight to the side to keep from crushing Tony but couldn't give up the contact. It didn't surprise him that Logan wasn't one for cuddling. It did surprise him that Tony was. Thankfully it was a pleasant surprise. "Mmm... your arm okay?"
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Tony, having abandoned his wheelchair not long after Steve had left, was leaning against a table a little more heavily than he should have needed to. While he definitely hadn't torn anything open, he'd definitely proven to himself that he wasn't ready to tear around the lab on foot. "Well," he said, swallowing a couple of pain pills sans water, "the hammer's freaky."
"Square deal." Scott laughed quietly and took a long pull off of the beer. "I'm about to go to jail - you know what I mean. I'm getting a last drink. You're cute - I'm pretty sure you know that - and I've heard that you're into guys sometimes, so... I was wondering if you might be interested in having some fun before we go downstairs and I start getting the psych eval to end all psych evals. Because if I have to do that, doing it stone cold sober and sexually frustrated just doesn't sound like fun." Scott could hear the words coming out of his mouth, and he meant them wholeheartedly, but they didn't make sense. He couldn't figure out why they felt like they did. He couldn't figure out exactly why it was a good idea to hit on Clint when he was still aching from his encounter with Logan not an hour before.
"We'll have somebody there before you have a chance to read all the dirty magazines in the rack."
Clint nodded, relieved to know that he was staying with Phil and Nat. He was also pretty impressed at how easily Tony was stepping into the leadership role. "You got it, tin man."
Steve smiled at Tony's rambling, warming at the sound and finally chiming in, "I'm thinking Italian. Comfort food, but classy... and you may have a point about the dancing. All I can say is that you're a terrible influence." Before Tony could get offended, he used his grip on Tony's hand to pull the man in a little closer and kiss his neck softly. "Luckily for you, I enjoy that." Steve glanced up at the clock and calculated briefly. "Okay, I'm going to go shower, get something decent on, and try to answer the three hundred emails I probably have from Director Fury by now. Meet back here at lunch?"
Steve's jaw clenched, and he nodded. He'd known that already from the look on Bruce's face, from the way Fitz-Simmons wouldn't meet his eye, from the catch in Tony's voice. "Enough," Steve assured firmly. He'd had a hand on the other man the whole time, unable to break contact even if it was a bit awkward. "I can take whatever I have to. We'll get everybody back, and I'll be fine." He slid his hand behind Tony's head and kissed him gently. No one watching mattered. He knew most of them would look away and try to give them the only kind of privacy they could afford for the moment.
Bruce shook his head. Tony wasn't really in the conversation, just thinking aloud. It scared him to think that Tony was designing the gun for his own use. He had to reassure himself that Logan would be willing to use it and that it would actually work.
"You know Bruce?" Steve inquired with surprise before looking back over at Tony. "Yes, he does. Actually, they're pretty close." He'd even experienced the odd twinge of jealousy at how easily Bruce and Tony interacted. When they got off on some tangent about mechanics and engineering, Steve could only look on, utterly lost. He poked Tony in the side with his free hand and pointed out, "You smell like a still. I'm surprised you can even tell what the bar smells like anymore." Steve took the opportunity of Tony protesting to slide his cell phone out and call a cab. As much as he hated constantly being virtually tethered to the device, it certainly had its moments of convenience. "We'll be on our way in a second." Steve tossed a fond smile at the man currently leaning against his side and told Logan, "He's actually brilliant."
Clint could feel his passenger's eyes on him, though he stayed focused on his flying. "Thing is, SHIELD has a tendency to keep an eye on technology and experiments which could be used against us. Maybe you're a small time crook, but that thing in your brain? You'd probably shit yourself if you knew how many organizations want to capture you and cut your head open," he said casually. He glanced back, keen blue eyes giving the other man a long look. "That aside, I couldn't guess why Fury wants you. He may have something specific in mind, or he may just want to make sure you're safe... and that we're safe from you." Aside from questionable taste in hairstyles, the guy wasn't hard on the eyes. //Nice build, nice jaw... And you need to focus on the mission,// he reminded himself, turning his gaze back to the instrument panel. //Another ten minutes, and we can land and I can take a nice, cold shower.//
"You heard him, Hairball." Tony was pretty sure Steve could take care of himself, but that didn't stop the billionaire from wanting to make sure the show he was getting didn't get unpleasantly interrupted because Logan was too far out of touch with humanity to not be a dick. The withering glare he got from the mutant was almost enough to make Tony wish he'd just let the two fight it out.
Bucky instinctively flinched at the sight of the needle. His brow furrowed while his expression darkened and beads of sweat glistened on his skin. He tried to concentrate on Coulson's friendly smile, but his vision blurred and the image wavered. Like a bad television signal phasing in and out, everything before Bucky had drowned itself in static. One minute Coulson was standing there, and the next a surgical masked doctor stood in the agent's place. Bucky shut his eyes tight, but all he could see was the Hydra symbol in his mind. He didn't want to go back there, he didn't want to remember. "Wait... stop," he pleaded with Coulson. "I... don't know what's happening... I don't want to hurt you..."
"If he does, we'll stop him then." Coulson paused. "Just in case the voices in your head go both ways, I think it's important that he be aware that we don't intend to leave any loose ends this time." He lifted a folder. "I have paperwork to do. Enjoy your stay." Even with his blood pressure skyrocketing, the agent managed an apparently casual smile as he turned and walked out of the room. They needed to find Loki, and they needed to find him fast.
Victor took his time, doing everything he could to draw any sounds he could from his victim. It wasn't easy. Phil wasn't as soft as the mutant had expected, but that just meant he'd be more fun.
Tony raised a skeptical eyebrow at the two. Bravado wasn't going to win him over\. With a deep breath, he managed to concentrate and pull the suit back in, going back to jeans and t-shirt. He grimaced and flexed his mouth. "Tastes like metal fillings," he murmured.
Tony raised an eyebrow but didn't argue. He was raising his hand to knock on Fury's door when it opened on its own.
"I know. Only Pepper can get away with such blatant disrespect for the laws of Stark." He'd gotten a call from the woman the night before. Apparently she'd heard through the grapevine a version of what happened. He'd filled in the blanks. Pepper wasn't officially part of the SHIELD chain of security and intelligence, but he didn't care. The truth was that Pepper Potts was probably more trustworthy than Stark most of the time. He set the food on the table and grabbed his own coffee from the tray, taking a seat and waiting for Tony to join him. "Got a text from the medical staff. Steve should be off the oxygen by the time we get down. He did better overnight."
"Mmm..." Steve hummed his approval and leaned his head back to rest on Tony's arm for a long, blissful moment. Long nights of nothing but Tony and a roaring fire and no one asking them for anything sounded like a pretty perfect approximation of heaven. "Definitely. Can't wait to see Fury's face when we tell him we're both disappearing for an undisclosed amount of time. And that I'll be smashing my cell phone into a million pieces before we leave so he can't contact us."
"When it tells me where to shoot a target."
"Just for that..." She rested her elbow on Clint's shoulder like he was there solely for her comfort and nodded her approval of his continuing to speak. "Go on."
Logan arched an eyebrow in response. “Why, you offerin’?”
"You're a bad liar," Steve answered, stretching up to kiss Tony again as they found a rhythm that left him barely catching his breath before Tony's thrusts stole it away again. "You want me as badly as I want you." It still boggled his mind to think that Tony had chosen him, that after all the men and women he'd been with, Steve was the one who had ultimately caught his eye. "And never get hurt again. Don't think I can take all that pretending to behave myself around you." Steve rocked his hips upward to meet Tony's next thrust and let out a deep groan. Even though they were still keeping it slow, Steve could feel his release building closer with every rolling movement of Tony's body against his own.
Steve snapped into leader mode without any further prompting. "Thor talks to his mom tonight, I'll talk to Fury in just a minute... we head out just before dawn. Everybody will need some sleep." He had no idea whether he'd even be capable of getting any. “I'll text Bruce the highlights and fill him in when he gets back. No sense in cutting his date short."
Logan had already been regaining consciousness when he'd been thrown into the cell. Standing, he fixed Coulson with eyes glimmering an unmistakably unnatural blue. "You're not gonna find it in time," he taunted, smirking at the agent. "Not before Loki gets there."
Phil's mouth was pressed into a tight line. He managed to hold himself together just barely, and only because they were standing in the hall. Without a word, he slid an arm around Clint's waist and led the man back to his room. The second they were through the door, Phil pulled Clint in tight and took a series of shaky breaths. "Sorry, just... I just needed to be here first." He'd needed to know it was just the two of them. He loathed the idea of sharing anything with a shrink, but he also knew the danger of coming to depend too heavily on Clint as the only other person who understood. That was stupid and short sighted. They needed to be able to function independently to do their jobs, and despite the danger and the risk, Phil loved his job. "We can try to behave like rational adults later. Right now I want to keep touching you and being close. It reminds me to breathe."
Loki flinched not at the admonition but at the implication that he somehow belonged to Thor. It was an old wound and one that he didn't particularly enjoy prodding. Still he managed to say nothing and was proud of that show of self control. "Captain? I don't expect you to trust me." He inclined his head and said, "Actually, I would worry for your integrity and common sense if you trusted me, but I can help. You know that because you are not a stupid man. I ask only for a chance, and as I would have a baby-sitter, there would be little risk to your team."
"Well, Cap, if it's an order..." Tony trailed off and grinned a little. He knew Steve was about as crazy about giving orders as Tony was about following them; it was just something they both had to do once in awhile. He leaned in and pressed a few fleeting kisses to Steve's neck. "What I mean is, be my guest."
Phil smiled faintly at that. Clint wasn't one to show idle gratitude. If he thanked someone, he meant it. "Not a problem. I don't want you bored." Clint was always a handful, but bored he was downright dangerous. He glanced over at Clint and enjoyed the look of actual relaxation on his face. With Natasha's situation, he knew the mood would likely be transitory, but that didn't matter. It was something. "Outside a few brief phone exchanges with Charles Xavier, I'm afraid I don't have much of an in with any of the X-Men. Hopefully they'll still be willing to listen."
Tony pushed himself up painfully - the sudden movements hadn't done anything for his injuries - just to see where his reflexive throw had landed. "Uhh... oops."
Victor seemed amused. "Look at that. He's worried for you, suit," he said, glancing back at Clint. "He thinks I'm gonna kill you. He might be right. But first..." He let go of Phil. Messing with the man directly wasn't getting the level of response he wanted. It was obvious that the archer was Coulson's weak spot. "C'mere, little bird." He reached for Clint again, claws snagging in what was left of the man's undershirt.
Logan quirked a faint grin at that. "Don't worry. I'll still call you a dick when people're lookin'. And I'm not readin' you a bedtime story," he promised, tossing the TV remote to Scott. "But, y'know, there's the boob tube if you need some background noise. Probably give you fewer nightmares, too." He stood and stretched, his back popping a few times. "Think I'm gonna turn in. I'm sure SHIELD'll drag me outta bed first thing to get all the details they can outta me."
Visibly surprised at being dubbed the more fashion-forward of them, Steve looked the shirts over and nodded his approval. They looked comfortable, functional, and obviously plaid and wife beaters were Logan's standard uniform. "I think they'll do just fine."
Clint had the decency to blush a little at that. It wasn't as if Phil was unaware that he and Nat had been more than just casual friends, but it was still a little awkward. Deciding it was best to play it off, he smirked a little and nibbled at Phil's jaw, unable to resist. He always pushed boundaries. At least a little. "Yeah, I am pretty cozy. I'm like a portable furnace. I could just lay on you and keep you toasty," he said, taking a moment to glance at the movie.
"Ms. Potts is waiting in Mr. Stark's suite. She was rather overcome with the news, and I believe she wishes to see for herself that this isn't, as she put it, 'some screwed up joke.' I naturally assured her otherwise."
“Yeah, I got that feeling.” Steve stepped in closer. He watched Tony work with a relentless certainty on something he couldn’t identify. There was something beautiful about watching the genius work even though Steve didn’t know the first thing about what Tony was doing. “I’d offer to help, but we both know that’s useless, so instead of me helping you with that,” Steve gestured to the pile of parts, “how about I help you get upstairs to your room?” The unfortunate double entendre caught up with Steve a second later. “I mean… I just mean you should get some rest, Tony. I’m worried about you. I’ve seen you go on a few work benders, but this isn’t healthy.” More than anything, Steve wanted to pick the man up, sling Tony over his shoulder and get him upstairs. “Just… talk to me, at least.”
Tony caught up to the others just as they were stepping into the briefing room. "Wonder Twins, you're on," he said as Bruce set the prototype down on the table and the two of them took seats.
Simmons looked up at him as if she didn't recognize him in the slightest. "Er, Agent Coulson, sir, it... you..." She blinked as if utterly uncertain what to say.
As promised, Phil was stationed in one of the smaller meeting rooms downstairs with Loki's file already projected up onto the screen and several touch pads ready for the others to follow along. "I hope the room is to your liking," he commented before diving in. "The basics you probably know already: Loki is a god. Well, demigod. He's a bit of a silver tongued devil, not to mention that according to Thor he has spent much of his life pursuing a greater knowledge of the magical arts."
Clint drew himself up a little. "Sounds like something I could help with. What do you say, Coulson? Think we can sneak out and find Logan's old team?" He was done with sitting on his ass. He was about ready to wade hip-deep through whatever goons Loki had gathered up and turn them into pincushions. Since no one knew where the bastard was, they'd have to settle for next best: gathering allies. He knew it'd piss Fury off, but it wouldn't be the first time he'd gotten yelled at. Hawkeye knew his value and just how much Fury would put up with him. He'd pushed it leaving Natasha alive when they first met, but he figured she'd paid that 'lapse' off in Fury's eyes already. //Time to borrow against my rep all over again.//
"Or we could have a drink first." He looked down at his own suit - liberally disheveled and coated with dirt and he didn't like to think what else. "Showers can probably wait." Seeing Loki had been harder than he expected. His chest ached, though Phil knew the pain was in his head and not his body. "Definitely a drink." Without another word, he lead the way to the elevator and down to the lounge and its wet bar - fully stocked thanks to Tony Stark's generous patronage. Coulson stepped up to the bar and smiled faintly. "You look as bad as I feel, so I'll be your bartender for the evening. I'm a scotch man myself. What's your poison?"
Loki hadn't expected Tony to be able to give in so thoroughly with Steve Rogers lingering in the back of his mind, but it seemed that Tony Stark was a flexible sort of a man in more ways than one. "I have to admit," he finally said, gaze raking over Stark's naked, glistening body, "that you are rather wonderful at that." Leaning in closer, he whispered in Stark's ear, "Perhaps later I can show you a bit more of my skills as well." Loki wondered whether Stark would remain so enthralled in the aftermath, in the quiet moments when he finally had a chance to examine what he'd done.
“What do we tell the others?” Steve asked, pushing himself into a sitting position at the edge of the bed.
Tony paused the screen and squinted behind his glasses to compare the still images of the Loki that had deserted them to the one that returned (and had consequently been taken back to Asgard). They weren’t the same person. Undeniably, it was Loki, but in that fifteen minutes of abandoning the original flow of the timestream, something had happened to change him. The hair wasn’t right, nor his demeanour: the original Loki had been sassing Thor and the other Avengers ever since he had been put in chains, while this one was moody and quiet. Wherever he went, it hadn't been good.
On one of his better days, in the second or third week, Steve had definitely visited and informed Tony and Peter that he was leaving to put the Stones back.
Tony thought as he sat up, clicked back on his communications with a rush of noise, and watched Steve’s star-spangled ass among the team of Avengers, old and new:
While Tony couldn't recall many of the immediate days after Thanos’ defeat, he had thought that (barring Peter, who only left his side to see his Aunt during the evenings) Steve visited his bedside the most often. Tony remembered a steady presence keeping watch in the dark hushed place between sleep and wakefulness, but it was always gone by the time he was roused. Stolen, by the night. It hadn’t occurred to him until now that the guardian might’ve been a figment.
Newly freed, Steve cradled the back of Tony’s head with one hand, making the hairs on the back of his neck stand on end. He kissed up the side of Tony’s throat and greedily ran his second hand along the naked skin at Tony’s rib cage.
A golden yellow glow from indoors cast a soft warmth over Steve’s features which extended to a natural flush of red and a healthy pink denoting embarrassment bled across Cap’s ashlar cheeks. Care and craftsmanship had been taken to great lengths to chisel the fine sculpt of his features, but Tony always preferred them marred by messy biology.
So, because they had all been damnably busy - and
“Your bike is in the garage,” Tony said smoothly as if reading his mind. He glanced around the mess of his workstation with a well-meaning sigh then pointed at Steve with an accusatory finger. “You really shouldn’t leave it parked out front, you know. Let me know if Dum-E scratched it, I’ll scrap him for parts.”
FRIDAY announced calmly, although it felt like a punch to the chest.
“They’re fucking - you’re fucking, right? You finally-” Clint said quickly, the bedraggled state of his hair and dark under-eye circles causing him to look a lot like a mad scientist. His eyes darted to Peter, before deciding any hopes of appearing polite in his company were hopeless.
It was late evening by the time he built up the nerve and peeked into Tony's private workshop. He had been surprised that J.A.R.V.I.S let him past the security defences of the Tower, but either Tony was a lot more reckless back in the day or he trusted Steve much more than he originally thought. Bruce was nowhere to be seen - likely sleeping the evening away like any normal guy would do after a long battle.
- but he had his bow and an arrow ready and that was what counted. On the far side of the yard, Barnes mirrored the archer with his rifle.
“I saw him give you the once over. More than once, I’m surprised you didn’t notice.” Steve argued and his hands found their way down the sides of Tony’s chest, back to framing his hips over his bruises. He squeezed. “You were holding hands.”
sexier. It allowed him to be close enough to direct the team, gather data, and act as evac or drop extra ammunition when necessary. He was the eyes in the sky: Iron Man even without wearing the suit.
- and playing with his bruises? Not a day-to-day Cap activity.
"Me too," Steve smirked and lifted Tony up against him so his legs came to rest around his waist. Without the armour, he weighed very little and Steve spun them easily so he could settle his arse back against the bench, holding Tony up around his midsection. Gravity forced Tony's crotch against his and Steve couldn't resist grinding their stiffening pricks together. Tony's hands gripped his shoulders tightly. "You're alright I've got you."
“He couldn’t hold a grudge to save his life,” Tony dismissed with a wave of his hand. “He’s a great kid; all heart and half as stubborn as you... I meant what I said: I won’t have you getting the ridiculous idea in your head that we’re better off apart, so don’t go looking for reasons.” He added with a sense of superiority he did not feel. He pushed his glasses higher up the bridge of his nose and tapped at his tablet mindlessly.
And yet, that man still chose to fuck Tony's past-self, even after everything that happened between them.
As far as Tony could tell, the man had never thought about their little tryst again - he had never even hinted at it in the years-post. Tony had been under the impression that it had been a meaningless one-time fling for Cap, something nice and not to be repeated, but perhaps Steve had remembered it enough to know he wanted to undo it.
” he hissed, stalking past Steve again to slam the door shut with enough force to rattle the cabinets. The cool and calm approach immediately went out of the imitation window. He was shaking, he realised, but if he acknowledged it for more than a moment he might break. “I have lived with this the whole time.”
But, ever since coming back from the past, Steve had been risking the team harmony by avoiding Tony and keeping
Steve stretched him to three and he whined brokenly, sweat dampening his shirt until it clung flush, cloying, to his back as Steve maintained ultimate control over his pleasure. His pace was relentless and punishing. Violent, if one ignored the precision Steve kept and Tony knew he was very far from using his full strength.
“What’s wrong?” asked Steve, concerned.
"Fuck." Tony scrambled up to help as Steve removed his own soft cotton top, hands skittering over hard musculature. His fingertips brushed over Steve’s nipples and he moaned under the tickling touch. “And you really are the wet-dream, 'peak of physical perfection' they say you are, huh Cap? You know I jacked off thinking about you when I was in college? I had a poster and everything.”
“Yeah, well. You try waking up on a dime after three great orgasms,” Steve grumbled into the pillow, digging his face into the cushiony fabric as if he could find an alternate-reality of pleasant sleep in its depths. Perhaps he thought Tony couldn’t hear him all the way inside that pillow. “It’s different if there’s a mission.”
Tony was there, bent over pieces of the Iron Man armour looking comfortable and lively while he tinkered.
In the second it took for them to realign, a seed of doubt lodged itself on the tip of Tony’s tongue. The shell caught in his teeth uncomfortably and he was ridding himself of the sensation before he even realised he had opened his mouth, “I haven’t-, not since-... with the arm. You know. It doesn’t matter; it’s all the same really. It is, of course, amazing,-”
"Strange," he greeted, a little bit of truth breaking through the word over his tongue. Tony hadn't seen the world-renowned doctor since '05. He cast his mind back to that blurry vignette of memory, recalling that Strange had a good taste of expensive sheets, men, and liquor.
Steve was half upright under the sheets waiting for him when Tony returned but settled into a supine position when he was joined in the bed. Tony turned to face him, discernible in the dark by strands of his hair made golden in the light of the fire. He would estimate that five inches separated them.
He looked the same as he had when he visited all those years ago. This had been his Steve all along.
She was unnaturally quiet for a moment and if Tony hadn’t literally been watching her brain work, he might've thought she had shut down. Two new windows opened up before him, large and imposing.
Back then, before the raid in Sokovia - before they had even been a real team - Tony was convinced that Steve never mentioned their fling because he had felt betrayed.
- but Tony wouldn't know it.
“See! It’s not just me that thinks you’re crazy," crowed Bruce.
force Cap could easily exert. And Steve knew exactly how much Tony could take, always drawing him to the edge and holding him there, never once testing or threatening going over the line. There was precision and power in that control, too. Steve could play him like a well-polished, finely-tuned instrument.
"I've been wanting to do that all day," Tony admitted, cheeks flushed and eyes dark. Steve could feel his breaths against the moisture on his top lip.
“You don’t do stuff in halves, do ya?” Steve asked but notably didn’t refuse. In fact, his cock twitched against Tony’s palm as he began to picture the joy of being inside him.
be a big scary rage monster and said rage monster won’t be afraid of him.
"Where did you get the bike?" He murmured after a pause, blinking his eyes open. From the close distance, he watched Steve do the same.
“I do, fuck, Tony. You’ve got it,” was Steve’s affirmation he had been waiting for and with a final roll of their hips - clashing together with a brutal force that would bruise at least one of them, if not both - Tony was arching inwards and gasping out his orgasm into the heated patch of Steve's throat. Waves of pleasure throbbed at his dick, the slide between them becoming slicker and messy; a combination of their need for one another.
Tony’s insecurity wasn’t focused entirely on the arm. Steve had technically slept with him mere months ago, but the Tony he had slept with was young, not yet embittered - one might argue that just after the battle in New York, Tony was his best self. It wouldn’t be unexpected if Steve kept the thought of that Tony in his mind and found this one wanting. But the tone Steve used allowed no room for doubt and, despite his inclination to argue, Tony could only feel relief and desire. He believed him.
"Alright?" Steve asked, voice rumbling like nature and rounded with sleep. He held Tony steady. His hand rubbed reassuringly against Tony's waist, searing a brand into his flesh. Perhaps it hadn’t only been the densely woven sheets that had stirred-up a heat comparable to Afghanistan.
In place of saying all of this, he had said something stupid and uninspired (because he could never find the right words for Steve) and Steve left with opportunity in the past. After sobering, Tony chalked the sentiment up to being loopy on space-grown painkillers. It wasn’t a big deal. Steve returned from his trip looking like he hadn’t left and Tony forgot about his missed attempt at a heart-to-heart. That was, he had forgotten until Steve sat across from him during a boring-ass meeting and hid a smile like being Tony’s friend again was the worst idea in the world.
He stood between Tony's thighs and gripped his neglected prick, slowly dragging his fist the whole length from base to tip, drawing out a breathy moan. Tony kicked his legs free from his trousers and reached for Steve, one hand at his waist and another a little lower.
Steve, emboldened with adrenaline, gripped Tony’s waist and pulled them both flush together. He looked down at Tony and found shock and desire written across his features. "If I'm bein’ honest I didn't just come back to say 'good job'." He admitted, because truthfully in his heart he had hoped that by staying around longer than necessary he could make a connection with Tony. Things were too tense between them back home, so he would reach out here in the safe confines of the past. Whether that was letting Tony know he was appreciated with words or with actions, it didn't matter. He tightened his arm around Tony’s waist and felt the other man shiver. "Say the word and I'll go right now if you want. Pretend this didn't happen."
Tony sat up to a caliginous room with a whiplash jerk, brow sweat-slick and hand, numb, scrambling at his chest. Obie had taken the reactor. He couldn’t move, but he was drowning, all the same, each intake of breath more shallow than the last. JARVIS was in pieces,
And reckless beginnings always suited Tony rather well.
sprinkles and nuts, regardless of the ice cream flavour. I’m not anti-sprinkle, but use your head for once, Tony.”
He checked the time. 1 am. Far from an unsociable hour.
“Tomorrow?”
“You… Don’t know. There’s a semi-stable God of
“I’m angry at you because you didn’t know back then what we had. Maybe it wouldn’t have made a difference if you had known, but you looked at me like a stranger the next time I saw you after New York. You didn’t trust me with Ultron, with Wanda, any of it. You
Something about that seemed to do it for Steve too, who began to stroke faster, his breaths loud in the short space between them. Tony keened, arching his back to try and get closer, to feel the patter of kisses he knew the other man ached to decorate his spine with. But Steve was long, had always been long, and he could wrap two fists around himself well before nudging up against Tony's cheeks if he wanted; Tony had quite a way to go to be filled. The hand at his back kept the distance between them and, again, Tony almost came then and there from the pure
"Nor I of you," Strange replied with a quirk of his brow. It was a bit smug, the curl of his lip, and Tony had a flash of memory that recalled pouncing for that cockiness. "We've both changed in the past decade," and then his eyes did flicker down to Tony's chest. "But you're half right; I'm not here solely to donate to the cause. Thor invited me."
Steve tightened his grip on Tony’s hands and used the leverage to thrust deeply, grunting with satisfaction as Tony cried out from the powerful slam of his cock. He bounced Tony along the length of his erection, keeping a fierce hold as he ploughed into him. Tony’s body strained against his grip and his heels dug into the small of his back to meet him thrust for thrust. Steve moved to grip Tony's slim waist, pressing bruises there as he watched their point of connection - watched himself slam into his friend over and over.
He swallowed, throat tight. A wave of unbridled shame washed over Tony; not at the admission that his self-worth had been rocked after Steve refused to trust him, but from his own self-awareness: he was referring to himself in the third person. He couldn’t stop it. It didn’t even work to distance himself from the hurt. He used to do that with Howard, and Obie, too. He didn't want to do that with Steve. He didn't want Steve to see his coping mechanisms, his weaknesses.
"Yeah, sounds good," Scott answered with a nod. He tried to relax himself without the aid of the TV but finally gave in and turned on some old Nick at Nite re-reruns. A few episodes of the Dick Van Dyke Show later, Scott finally drifted off. He found himself running in the dream, turning down twisting pathways that always ended in a dark room filled with leering guards. He'd turn, he'd run, and no matter what turns he took, in the end one of the men would grab him and drag him in, screaming. He woke sweating and exhausted to find that he'd only gotten a few minutes of sleep. The cycle repeated three more times before Scott finally hauled himself up and stumbled, weary and shaky, into Logan's room. He didn't understand why he felt safer with the man, but he did. "Logan?" he called out, remembering well how it had gone when Rogue interrupted the man while he was sleeping.
Logan closed his eyes, sighed heavily, and let his head fall back as Scott's lips moved over his skin. "Kinda really like the way you use your mouth," he breathed, lifting his head and smirking at his lover, "and the way you hold my hand." It was the most romantic thing he could think of to say. The feeling of Scott's fingers tangled with his while they'd eaten dinner had been strangely soothing.
It didn't take Clint long to clean himself up and head down the hall to get dressed. He pulled on a pair of neatly creased black cargo pants, boots, a button-down shirt and a leather jacket, then headed back down to check on Darien’s progress. "There're some extra clothes in the closet if you need anything. SHIELD got some stuff in your size."
"No. If I knew where she was, would your drunk ass still be sitting there?" Fury rubbed his forehead. "It'll be online in a few. This is a courtesy update." He looked Coulson over and then added, “Just make sure Barton's still alive in the morning."
Tony grinned sarcastically. "Oh, good. Is this going to be the same fantastic timing as with the Hydra weapons, or...?"
//Yeeeeeep. I'm definitely going nuts. Hallucinating, even. This is all a dream. Well, somewhere it turned into one.// "I, uh... okay," Tony allowed, not sure of what else to say or why he kept getting distracted by his captor's nude state. //Maybe if I could think with my higher brain functions.// "Just, y'know, don't kill any of my friends when they show up. That'd be a start. And fix whatever that hammer's done to Barton."
Seeing the look on Clint’s face, Phil offered gently, “I understand your concern, Barton. I really do. I just think there’s a bigger picture and a bigger mission. I think we owe Barnes a chance. Go get some sleep. You can go back to crawling through the ductwork in the morning.”
It's all plot, folks. Plotty plot plot.
Clint could feel his peak nearing and was so focused on Darien's hot mouth wrapped around him that he almost didn't notice Alan, the other observer, approaching from his position leaning against the wall.
"He might," Bruce allowed with a nod. "He might not, though, and I don't want to lie to you, Cap. This is bad either way. Part of me wants him to remember everything so we can find Hydra and cut all the heads off that thing once and for all. Part of me hopes he doesn't remember anything. We got a taste of what they've been using him for with Tony, but we don't know how bad it's been."
Logan pushed Scott away, shoving him onto his back on the couch. Before Scott could protest or assume that Logan was rejecting him, though, the feral mutant had knelt between his lover's knees. Logan unceremoniously wrapped his mouth around Scott's cock. He knew the other man wouldn't last long at all, but he wanted to give Scott something more than simple touching. Dark eyes drifted up to Scott's face as his hands clamped down on Scott's hips and his lover's shaft slowly slid down his throat.
Steve hadn't felt so pained and proud at the same time since the first glimpse he got of Bucky in uniform. The moment carried the same bittersweet notes, and Steve sighed, resigned. "Okay. Yeah, I... You sure you can't just be the rich, egotistical jerk everybody thinks you are? Because that would be good sometimes. I've got a bad heart, y'know." Steve didn't mean a word of it, and he knew Tony was well aware. Instead he kissed the man soundly, morning breath be damned. "Okay. I'm behind you. I'm also going to be praying like hell that we don't come within a million miles of needing you to back Logan up on this."
"You should be careful with him, Tony," Steve cautioned once Logan had left the room. "He likes you alright so far, but there's a lot of cracks already started. You push too hard, you're bound to break something." He didn't want to see Tony get hurt or Logan end up in a SHIELD holding facility because he'd gone off on their resident playboy genius. "Tell him everything, but tell him when he asks." Some things Logan didn't remember might be for the best. Certainly Steve could allow that there were a few things he wouldn't mind scrubbing from his memory, and he knew Tony had more than his share too. "I'm gonna go see if we can help get him some new clothes or anything. You coming?"
Clint glanced at Coulson curiously, completely oblivious to the Director's meaning.
"We need to know where Loki is, and we need to know now."
Bruce was off to try and find a traceable energy signature for the device Loki had used. Fury was fuming somewhere. Scott had been there but had barely spoken. The man looked too shaken to be much use, but he'd insisted on at least being there for the debriefing. Afterwards Coulson had suggested he stay on top of the techs even though they didn't really need it. "Of course we are," Phil answered as though that was a foregone conclusion. It was in a way, he just wasn't ready to speculate on whether Logan and Nat would be alive when they were found. "You need rest. A shower. Tony bled all over you."
Logan nodded amiably. He'd have made the offer himself, but didn't quite know how to do it without seeming weird. "'Course. Wouldn't want to leave ya out in the cold." He knew how hard it was, being alone when he woke up freaked out and trying to figure out where he was. //Now the game becomes trying to not cuddle up to 'im while I'm asleep.//
He feigned a look of offense and held Clint a little tighter. "I beg to differ. I'm fairly sure that taking the two of you on as assets were the craziest things I ever did. It kind of worked out."
Coulson couldn't believe he'd actually invited Clint to come to bed with him if he had anymore bad dreams. He wanted to go hide back in his room again, but Clint seemed willing to let it slide. "Thank you... and no. I'm fine. Mostly. The pills assured me a good night's sleep, interruption aside, and waking up to coffee always helps. I don't usually get to do that." By "usually" didn't get to, he meant that he never got to do it unless he programmed the pot. There was never anyone else there to do it. Small as the gesture was, it actually meant the world. "What about you? The dream? And you don't get to tell me that it was nothing. You woke me up in the middle of the night. Something's got you rattled, Clint. Talk to me."
Clint laughed, more heartily this time. "Yeah? I've got one from getting my leg tangled in the trapeze as a kid," he said with a smirk. "But I think that guy of yours digs scars, but not as much as the whole package, I'm betting," he said, gracefully sliding a leg across Phil's legs and settling across the man's lap. He looked down at his handler, still smirking with just a hint of cockiness. "Maybe we can compare, count them up and see who has more," he decided, slowly tugging his shirt up over his head and tossing it aside.
Darien felt a sense of relief as well even through the awkwardness of the situation. While the brief encounter the night before hadn't left him feeling one way or another about Natasha, he could tell easily how Clint felt about her. They didn't qualify as a couple, but he did care what Clint was going through. "Sounds like good news."
Tony felt his pulse quicken at the thought. The kissing hadn't hurt, either. "No, but I want to," Tony said, his voice a little deeper than it had been a moment before. "Hopefully it's hot, sweaty, and takes up at least half my day." He was really beginning to loathe the stitches. "And remind me to 'thank' Logan's brother when I get better for interfering with my sexy funtime."
Having only caught the last sentence of the conversation, Tony couldn't know for sure what was up, but he had a fair idea. Still, he wasn't above pushing Fury's buttons. "Cellphones, I'm not so sure, but I know I saw a few iPads. Those're hard to mi-"
"There's nothing to talk about," Tony sighed with a dismissive wave of his hand. Unfortunately the gesture caused the computer schematic he had been trying to concentrate on to fly across the room. "I know it's strange that an exceptionally charismatic guy like me is at a loss for words. Hard to believe, right?" Tony honestly didn't mean to be so short and discourteous to Steve. The other man meant well, but this was something Tony could not talk about or deal with, possibly ever. In fact, the only time he managed to blot out the memory of what had happened was in the bottom of a bottle.
"Not sure I'd want to." Somewhere along the way he'd gotten used to Logan, even before he'd counted the man as a friend. Shifting, Scott straddled Logan's lap properly just to be closer. His arms slid over Logan's shoulders, and his forehead fell against Logan's. "I really, really wouldn't want to, actually. Having you next to me feels safe. Which is pretty dumb when we're all risking our butts with a guy who might as well be a real god." He kissed the man's lips. "It still feels better doing it with you."
“I appreciate that,” Phil agreed readily. He trusted that Barnes really did want to do what was best, but he also knew that Hydra had made it as difficult as possible. “I don’t want to treat him like he’s on death row, but we need to be careful for his sake, for Captain Rogers, for Stark. There’s a lot on the line for the team, and it will benefit all of us if we do everything in our power to make it work. For the moment, he’s sleeping. I think it would be in our best interest to get some rest too.”
Steve rose with dignity and walked out side by side with Tony. He felt overwhelmed and grateful and shaky. The adrenaline was wearing off, the effort of the day weighed heavily on his shoulders, and even with his health improved, his stamina wasn't where it should have been. Still Steve curled his fingers around Tony's as they walked. He felt almost shy, wanting to say everything all at the same time, to question and praise and touch and ultimately unsure what to do first. "I feel like I have a million things to say. Then... it's stupid, but I kind of just want to stare at you."
Logan started to tell her he'd do it, then seemed to change his mind. "You do it," he decided, letting go of Nat and taking hold of Scott. He nipped at the man's neck, his tongue soothing over the fading bruises from the events of the last few days as he pulled his lover tight against him. He let out a harsh sigh as their cocks slid together, nuzzling Scott's throat and jaw. "Feel good, baby," he murmured softly.
"Sir, I don't think - "
Phil's grip on Clint tightened as much as he dared, held him fast and willed his own trembling to stop. "No. Listen to me, Barton, this is not your fault." He threaded his fingers into Clint's spiky hair and closed his eyes against the feeling of Clint's tears. He hated Clint hurting. He hated that he couldn't fix it or protect his lover. "The only person responsible for this is the asshole who just left." Phil sighed softly and kissed Clint's hair. "I need to do whatever I can to protect you. When we get out of here, if I'm whole and sane, it's going to be because you're getting out with me. It's going to be because you're okay."
Tony obviously had no need for a slow pace and no desire to have any sort of control. That was both good and bad. It had been awhile, and being with Tony was good on so many levels that Steve found himself at a loss to take a breather when he needed to. "You feel perfect," he moaned, finally starting to move in earnest: slow, deep strokes that left him aching for more.
For once Steve was thankful that he was missing something. There was obviously more to the reference than the obvious given the smirk on Tony's face, but he had no idea what the man was getting at. He settled for an uncertain shake of his head and ventured carefully, "I just think you got some of the best parts of him." It wasn't a new thing for Tony to take advantage of the fact that he'd missed more than a little slang and even more cultural references during his long entombment. One of the reasons Steve found it so difficult to be at ease around him was a feeling of constantly walking on eggshells trying not to say anything too painfully stupid, to not expose his ignorance. Of all the Avengers Tony tended to be the hardest to convince that he had worth as a leader - and how was he supposed to be a good leader when sometimes he felt like he didn't even know how to be a person in the strange, new world?
It was a hell of a show, and one Logan had guessed rightly that Natasha appreciated. She'd always enjoyed watching Clint take control of his lovers, and it wasn't any different seeing Logan working Scott up. The two of them were fucking beautiful together. "Oh, I'm definitely okay with winging it. Tell me, Logan, that pretty mouth of his... is it as talented as it looks?"
"No. If Fury is as thorough as usual, he won't be hurting anyone at all," Phil agreed with a heavy sigh. He nodded toward the hammer. "You okay if we drop that off with R&D? They're going to want to check it out after all this. We haven't seen what the readings do once it's been in use this long, and Simmons is going to want to have every conceivable bit of biofeedback from you she can get her hands on." The hope that Clint might give it up willingly if it sounded like a routine drop was a slim one but worth trying out just the same. "I'm sure Stark and Rogers will be doing a check in there too." Simmons would be like a kid on Christmas morning with so much data to sift through and Tony back to boot.
Phil froze when he got close enough to see Clint and Darien's legs tangled together on the floor. Without seeing more, he had no idea just what was going on, but he knew it didn’t invite extra company. "Sorry. Coffee run. I'll... come back later."
Fury stared hard at Loki, surprised to see nothing but fear and vulnerability there. That was something he'd yet to see in the Asgardian. "So, let me get this straight: you show up, try to kill us all, turn one of my best agents into your personal playtoy, go to prison, break out, break one of my Avengers, nearly kill one, abduct two of my best agents... I'm sure I'm leaving things out here, but you get the idea. And now you want me to let you not only live, but stay here and join the Avengers?"
Though Simmons rolled her eyes, she was smiling too. "Of course, Captain Rogers. We'd love to have you."
Tony crossed his arms over his chest and rolled his eyes. "Here we go. Moral absolutionism." He shook his head. "Look, humans aren't perfect. We have idiot leaders. We have terrible people in our ranks. I know; I used to be one of them." He leaned toward Loki, inclining his head to get the god to look at him. "But, y'know what? I'm guessing the fact that your brother, the guy with the muscles and the epic hammer, is in charge where you're from because there are assholes in Asgard, too. If all it took was smarts and whatever concept you have of good leadership, he wouldn't be in charge, would he? You wouldn't be here trying to retrieve a weapon that was made where you're from if your world was so damned perfect. And if you've still got that nutcase idea in your head that enslaving everyone is what's going to fix it, then you might as well head to Mars, because it's basically the same idea. If you wipe out all freedom and make everyone march in lockstep, there's no war and no terror and no bad stuff, but then there's not a hell of a lot of fun, either, is there?" He stuck his chin out and defiantly narrowed his eyes at the god. "And I know how much you like chaos. You'd get bored real fast."
In which Logan and Scott take a moment for themselves.
Tony settled at the bar and gestured to the bartender, who was cowering behind it still. "Hey, uh... it's okay. Just fill'er up," he said, leaning over and trying to hand his glass to the man. He looked at Logan. "Care for another? Next round's on me."
Natasha shrugged. "Not yet. Something tells me necks break the same way in Asgard." She smiled in a rather off-putting way at Bruce only to turn at the sound of steps behind them.
Clint shrugged, still staring at the countertop to keep the light from getting him. "Human sacrifice, dogs and cats living together, mass hysteria... He's the god of mischief. Oh, and also, I hear he wants his own personal planet and slave race. So there's that." He looked up, squinting bloodshot eyes at Darien from under his hoodie. "Please tell me there's coffee now."
They passed the rest of the day in a surprisingly comfortable succession of beer and bad TV and companionable silence. As the hour drew late, Scott ventured, “Can I stay with you tonight? Just sleep. Scout's honor."
Tony had often been compared to his father, especially the older he got. Sometimes he didn't know whether to take it as a compliment or to be offended. Hearing Steve admit that he genuinely held admiration for him brought a smile to Tony's face. Deciding to yank Steve's chain a little more, Tony remarked with mock seriousness, "So, are you saying I'm the 'daddy' type?" He wondered what kind of reaction that would elicit from the other man, who still seemed naive about the ways of the modern world.
"Very true," Phil agreed with a nod. "Fitz put his shoes up on my table once. He didn't ever do it again." It wasn't so much that he was bothered by the act as that he'd enjoyed the look of terror on Fitz face when he made his displeasure clear. Just because he was fond of Fitz-Simmons didn't mean they didn't need to get shaken up from time to time. It was a pretty surface sort of fact, and it felt odd to realize how little Clint probably knew beyond the obvious. Deciding to go for broke, he offered, "My mother died last year. We were in Mexico - that op with the cartel. That's why I was such a dick that week."
Scott let out a groan but didn't really protest. He liked it. Scott ducked his head under the water and grabbed the shampoo. "Morning," he returned, scrubbing off the remains of the previous day. The night before he'd wondered what it would all feel like in the harsh light of day. Thanks to Natasha's insistence on hydration and the fact that she'd apparently left aspirin on the night stand, Scott didn't feel too bad. His headache was a dull pressure at the back of his skull, but nothing he couldn't handle. "Maybe getting a place of my own's a terrible idea. I kinda like waking up this way."
Clint couldn't help but laugh a little about that. He had to deal with his own jealousy issues regarding their far from monogamous relationship. It just felt weird knowing that she and Coulson had slept together and that Clint had never caught onto it. //Well, I guess I don't see everything,// he thought with a smirk. "Poor guy. I bet none of the other agents believed him, either," he remarked with a smirk. While Phil Coulson was hardly bad on the eyes - and apparently he was hung - he also didn't strike a person as the sort who'd be able to convince Nat to sleep with them. At least, not without some thought. Coulson had nerves of steel and enough confidence to stand up to gods, so in a way it made perfect sense. //Still awkward.// "I'm still going to have to fight to look him in the eye for the next few days."
Bruce tensed as Tony slid an arm around his shoulders and shook him companionably. "Tony, I don't think our new friends really want to meet the big guy in person, so - "
Steve chuckled at the visual and then shook his head. "Best case scenario, I'd probably break something." He was still smiling when he explained, "I'm not giving up, but I also know that right now, I can't go out in the field and take the hits. I can coordinate, I can help, but I can't be the leader they're going to need right now." Steve nudged his lover in the ribs with his elbow and added, "Bet you can be, though."
Scott swallowed hard, fingers clutching tight around the glasses for a moment. They'd been torn from his face during the fight. He'd spent a solid week completely blind with his eyes bound roughly whether he was awake or asleep. He shuddered at the memory. "Thanks." He set the glasses down on the nightstand and sighed as he sat gingerly down on the bed. It didn't disappear, and he chose to trust the reality of the moment and lie down. Scott stretched out on his stomach to avoid aggravating his back further. At the last second of consciousness, Scott's eyes fluttered open. "Who sent you? You wouldn't come for me... not for the Professor... who?"
Natasha allowed herself time to enjoy every last quake of the climax before she returned her attention to Clint. "Now I want you to fuck me, and don't even think about cumming until I say that you can." She waited until Clint gave a nod of confirmation before spreading her legs wide and inviting him to crawl up between them. Often Nat preferred less traditional poses, but for the night she was satisfied to watch Clint's face as he fell apart. The sight of his eyes naked at the moment of release was something to see. "And don't you dare take those pants off." Nat's toes ran up over the leather.
Natasha shook her head and waved the idea away. "Doesn't matter. I wouldn't say anything to Clint I wouldn't say in front of you." Though she didn't have nearly the buddy relationship with Coulson that Clint had forged, Natasha trusted the man. He had the greater good in mind when he acted, and he'd proven more than a few times that he wasn't an idiot. That was all she really needed to know. "Besides, this way you can keep me from killing Clint with my scary new mind powers."
"Just might have to keep things more NC-17 than X-rated tonight," Scott answered, letting Logan push his shirt up and off. He knew he looked like kind of a mess. He'd winced at the sight of himself in the mirror when he showered while Logan was still passed out on the bed. There was still a wealth of things they could do as long as he didn't let Logan get freaked out or pull away. "I'm fine. I've had a lot worse than this." Maybe not for worse reasons, but it was a mess for everyone. Feeling like it was probably better to get a lot of it out of the way at once, Scott unfastened his own pants and let them fall. With his boxer briefs hanging low on his hips, it was easy to see the finger-shaped bruises dotting the skin. Even Scott wasn't sure which bruises belonged to which man, and he didn't let himself think too much about it. He caught the look on Logan's face and swallowed. "If I should put my pants on and head back to my own room... I mean, I don't think anybody would blame you if this kills the mood."
Simmons lingered a bit, selecting a cup and a muffin with a bright smile. "I hope the extra, er, rest helped."
It took very little to get him to the edge. Phil had been close since the first kiss, and soon he was gasping, his hips losing all sense of proper rhythm  as he let go of Clint's head in favor of his shoulder again. He braced his other hand flat against the wall to keep from tumbling to the floor. He came hard but did his best to keep mostly quiet. Bringing in the whole damn club didn't sound like the right way to end things. Instead Phil found himself letting go with an intensity that left him fighting to breathe and moaning Clint's name.
Tony leaned in and nipped at the spot behind Steve's ear that he knew could make the man squirm with a little more insistent pressure before he drew back. "I'll hold you to that," he said, his voice deeper than it had been a moment before as he gave Steve a decidedly hungry look. He pressed a much more chaste kiss to Steve's lips, then pressed their foreheads together and sighed. "Alright. Fine. But I guess if I'm going to get anything done, you're going to have to not be so distracting."
Clint grinned. "I think I remembered to bring my Tums. That'll help," he said, eyeing the Snickers bar in Phil's hand. He reached out and grabbed the wrist said hand was attached to and making sure he got eye contact, Clint jammed entirely too much of the bar into his mouth and took a bite before letting Phil go and chewing casually as if nothing strange had happened. He was moving back to the potatoes as he casually remarked, "Man, that's a lot more sugar than I'm used to."
Once the SUV was parked, Logan casually sauntered around to where Scott was disembarking and immediately dragged his lover into a deep, sensual kiss, then glanced at Nat as she got out. "So, your place or ours?"
Fury settled back in his chair, then shoved a folder that had been sitting next to his elbow toward Coulson. "Sounds like it's time to clean out the Fridge," he said.
Steve lost the thread of worrying about getting Tony to work immediately. He forgot almost everything, including his own middle name as Tony worked at the sensitive skin and pressed tightly against him. "Maybe... maybe longer than five minutes," he panted, wrapping his legs around Tony to prevent the man getting any ideas about moving away. Already he was half hard against his lover's thigh. "Maybe we should take care of this first."
Bruce ignored the personal jab. "Yeah. A metal suit sprouting out of your skin. Not weird at all."
"No," Clint answered as he brushed past Logan. "Stark does, too."
Instead of looking angry, Loki laughed at the threat and smiled with some real warmth. "I think I'm beginning to like you, Mr. Stark. I will be the absolute picture of discretion, have no fear. Captain Rogers will hear nothing of it from me. You may wish to give the same admonition to Logan. From what his brother says, he's likely to know regardless." Loki let the words sink in and shifted to sit at the edge of the bed once more, fingers steepled and arms braced on his knees as he leaned forward to address Tony. "I am endeavoring to be sincere. Honest, even. It is not my natural inclination." The god's expression clouded. "But I am earnest in my desire to find a new way of doing things even it means attempting to be polite to my brother... as long as that doesn't come up often."
Phil knew objectively that the way he'd ended up twisting Clint so that he was half turned against him probably wasn't comfortable. Of course, judging from the way Clint was moaning into his mouth and clutching at him, that didn't seem to matter. Phil silently thanked a god he'd never particularly believed in. The kisses weren't desperate, but they were insistent. Phil wasn't interested in giving either of them time to breathe or do anything but soak each other in.
Steve turned at that, his gaze narrowed and jaw set. He took a step in, not backing down for a second even if only the armor gave him the height needed to look Clint in the eye for the time being. "It is, and if you get too close right now, you're not going to need Loki's help," Steve warned in a tone so calm and even that it was slightly terrifying.
Anyone who has watched Sci-Fi's Invisible Man series back in the day will recognize that I shamelessly stole Darien Fawkes from them. I don't regret it, but I'm not tagging Invisible Man since this is a wholesale bastardized version, plus he comes and goes and isn't a steady char here.
"We look ridiculous," Phil observed as he took Clint's hand. He didn't really mind. Clint was worth looking ridiculous for. "Well, I look ridiculous. You actually look kind of gorgeous. Why do you look gorgeous when you're blushing? I just look like I got winded running up the stairs." The complaint lacked venom, and soon they found the stands to procure the items they'd decided on with a last minute addition of spiral cut potatoes. "If we're going to do the fair food, we might as well do this all the way. There's no more certain way to prevent sex than eating enough to make you feel like you never want to move again."
Loki breathed in and squared his shoulders. "We go to Fury, then?" The man hated him, and the feeling was mutual. He might not really consider all humans insects, but Fury brought one to mind rather clearly. Making nice with him would be a rather fitting litmus test to see if he could suppress the desire to smite the idiots that would surround him on a regular basis on Midgard.
Steve nodded, but when Bruce disappeared into the lab again, he stayed right where he was.
"Thanks, sport," Tony said, looking the specs over. "I'll feed this to Jarvis." Fitz was right; it wouldn't do more than buy him more time to possibly kill Loki, but hopefully it was a moot point. He really hoped it was a moot point. His stomach gurgled plaintively. It was the third time in the hour; Tony had just been pointedly ignoring it in favor of working.
Logan nodded, running a hand through Scott's hair and smiling. "Y'know, I tried that a couple o' times. Sayin' no, I mean." He smiled faintly. "It's pretty tough to make it a firm no. 'Specially when Chuck pulls your ass outta the fire." It felt good having Scott in his lap. The man being pressed against him meant that Scott was safe. Logan still remembered how vulnerable Scott had been when he'd found the man, and it was hard to stop feeling protective. "You might have a hard time goin' out into the field without me attached to ya, though." It had been frightening fighting Loki with Scott at his side, but it would have been more frightening for the man to have been out there without him.
Sif shook her head. "Nay, it is worthy armor," she said with obvious approval. "I have come to aid you in your quest."
"Parts of me are," Scott allowed. He knew sitting would be at least slightly uncomfortable for awhile, but he didn't particularly regret the ache. Instead he smiled wickedly at Logan and draped his arms across the man's shoulders. Soap suds dripped down them both as their bodies slotted together. They fit naturally, easily, and Scott simply appreciated that fact for a moment. "I'm not looking to start anything. I know you might be dragged off on a mission any second. I'm just enjoying," he gestured vaguely, "this. It's easier than I thought it would be."
"I'll clean up breakfast, then it's back to meetings." Pepper sounded exhausted just talking about it. "People keep telling me they'll be happy to wait. I think waiting would be worse. I'd rather do it all. I'd rather do every last bit of it right now."
"Bad news is, we're not doing it, because it's out of the question," Tony snapped.
Well into the night, Bruce finally nudged Tony with a stylus. "Hey. It's after ten. Go get some rest," he said.
Half hard and dying to make Clint follow through with the promise. Phil gripped Clint's hand tightly, sharing the tension. The last thing he wanted was for Clint to think it was lack of interest keeping him from saying yes. Unfortunately he knew better. He knew that no matter how anonymous a moment felt, there were always eyes. The only eyes he wanted on Clint's body anymore were his, so Phil knew he'd have to be at least a little patient. "When we get back, I'm going to take the longest, coldest shower of my life."
For a moment, Steve was sure that Tony was about to be eviscerated, but apparently Logan's instincts shifted quickly enough to keep him in one piece. The tension dissipated, and Steve just let himself enjoy the scene. Instead of jealous, he felt pure pleasure at the unmistakable desire between the two men. //Maybe I should have tried something like this sooner.// "Maybe we should take this to the bedroom," he suggested, walking up to the pair slowly. Logan didn't seem like the kind of guy to take by surprise no matter how lucky Tony might've gotten with the strategy. Instead he moved in with quiet purpose, one hand sliding around Logan's waist from behind so that he could press a kiss to the man's neck. "Nobody'll interrupt there."
"He's still out," Bruce began as he took a seat on the bench next to Steve and stretched his legs out in front of him. "We're working to get all the drugs out of his system. The stuff they gave him... I don't even know what some of it is. Once he's clear, then we wake him up and see. It's fair to say there was probably some brainwashing apart from the drugs, but I've got my suspicions that the cocktail was their main tool. That's good for us since it means once the detox is done..."
Coulson's gaze narrowed for a moment but he apparently decided not to take the bait. "Isn't who you made out with on the dance floor. He isn't part of this issue."
Darien took only a few more strokes to find his release. He gasped and moaned into Clint's mouth, the sound breaking free at the end of the kiss, and his cum splashing over Clint's hand. It was strange to sit exposed in the middle of the kitchen getting jerked off by someone he'd only known for a few days, but it wasn't bad strange. Darien cursed at the sound of footsteps on the other side of the counter and hurriedly grabbed for a towel as he tucked himself back into his slacks.
"Sir?" The AI almost sounded wary.
Bucky found himself taken aback. He hadn't expected such an earnest response and staunch defense of his character. "You're awfully nice to someone who tried to throttle you," he said with good humor. "I'll take your word for it. Arguing with you wouldn't be a good idea. I know you've got it in you to put me down." That was putting it mildly. Bucky hadn't known what hit him, and Agent Coulson had made it perfectly clear he could take care of himself.
Bruce smiled faintly to himself. It was nice, actually, having someone other than Tony around who wasn't afraid to get within ten feet of him. Well, Nat and Steve weren't either, but they seemed to think he wanted the space. Tony just didn't care. But Simmons was nice. And she smelled nice. Reminding himself they were actually doing something, Bruce focused on the monitor. "Maybe this," he said, taking out one compound and throwing in another.
Steve woke with a shaky gasp. The sound of beeping greeted his ears, and he couldn't stop trembling, shaking with a numbing cold. He swallowed hard and blinked, finally spotting a familiar face leaning over him. "C-coulson..."
"I know. We know. Thank you, Jarvis."
Steve felt his heart break for them both even as he smiled. "I'll tell him. Every word." Their goodbyes were only somewhat strained, and Steve promised to come back, to check in, to relay any messages from Scott as soon as he could. He made his way down the line with a heavy heart and found Scott curled in on himself on the bunk at the back of the cell. "Scott?" The man's gaze snapped up, and Steve was struck by how young and vulnerable he looked. On paper they'd been walking the earth the same number of years - the ones spent on ice not precisely counting as far as Steve was concerned - but with his tear-streaked face and the circles under his eyes, Scott looked like he wasn't nearly old enough to have been through so much. "I know we don't know each other very well, but I wanted to check in."
She rolled her eyes. "You're ridiculous. And of course I'll get you some food." For the first time in a long time, Jemma found herself looking forward to something that had nothing at all to do with work. Not even Fitz looking for her to play lab mother was enough to dull her spirits.
Clint normally would have said no, as well. If he could avoid a meeting, he'd do it. He much preferred the "get orders, put arrows in people, come home" routine, but when it came to anything possibly pertaining to getting Nat back, he was willing to sit through a briefing. "Yeah, I'll go. Maybe I can offer," his voice hitched a little, "some insight." He topped off his coffee and gave Darien a quick peck on the cheek and another ass slap. "Thanks again." He turned to Coulson. "Let's go. Provided Fury can deal with me showing up in street clothes."
"I did poke Bruce Banner with a taser once," Tony admitted, looking up to give Loki a faint smirk. He tilted his head. "Aside from the fact that you look like you just got dragged out of the freezer, I'm not seeing a big difference. I mean, you're still being you in all your charming glory. You haven't tried to eat my eyeballs or anything uncharacteristically horrible. Most of the horrible things you've done so far have been par for the course."
Tony smiled, tangling his fingers with Steve's and bringing the blonde's hand to his mouth for a kiss. "I was a little scared, too. I'm not anymore," he said, dark eyes fixed on bright blue. "You feel different, but you're still you. We're still us. You still drive me crazy, and I still love you," he said, meaning every word of it. He'd be lying to pretend that things hadn't changed a bit. But the important things hadn't. He leaned in to press his lips to Steve's for a long, slow kiss, drawing away and pressing their foreheads together. "You're totally worth the brain damage."
"I'm sure we'll find something to make this work more safely," Simmons assured the group in general as if they weren't all working on the same problem. "We just have to keep looking. With all of the tech we have at our disposal between the Stark archives and SHIELD... well, if anyone can find the answer, we can."
Logan took the memo, raising an eyebrow as the news sank in. "Summers?" he asked, sounding somewhere between surprised and annoyed. "I put ten thousand miles between us, and the little shit still manages to be a pain in my ass," he growled as he looked over the memo. It really didn't have any more information than Coulson had already given him verbally. Logan looked up and tilted his head at Coulson. "So you kids want me to go get 'im? Your files didn't tell you how well the two of us get along?"
He felt short of breath.
“This is all you're getting for now,” Steve promised, his voice low as he pulled out to watch Tony’s hole gape and wink before filling the space that he left bereft. He only sank in the inch of his tip and Tony started to understand what regret tasted like.
Tony’s fingers tapped idly at his elbows as he watched over the duplicate footage JARVIS saved again. He frowned as his past self collapsed, allowing Loki the opportunity to collect the Tesseract from the floor of the Tower while everybody was distracted, before retreating into a portal at his back. There had been fifteen minutes of chaos as their original selves looked for Loki - including Thor yelling to the heavens and Steve getting into a spectacular fight with his future self - and then, innocent as anything, the god of mischief reappeared in chains before Thor as if nothing had happened. The Tesseract was handed over to Pierce, and all was right in the world again; the Stone returned to its place in the hands of a Nazi.
Like their first time, Steve’s cock remained just as hard as it had been moments before and that erotic thought hit Tony straight in the gut, a slice of a hot blade all the way down to his erection and burning him to his core. He would be able to get so much pleasure from Steve; the guy that could go and go again. Tony had always found the most erotic part of sex the knowledge acquisition and implementation. With Steve, he could learn and utilise and repeat time and time again.
“Tony?”
Tony spared a moment for disbelief, then chuckled and shook his head. "I'm never going to get tired of you. But you do realise that this will haunt you forever, right? Every time we fight I'll tell you to go back to twenty-twelve and find yourself a hot young side-piece. It's disappointing, really; I won't get to return the favour without messing us up further. Past-You would be great fun."
rub up against him. He broke free to bite at Steve’s jugular, his voice rough as he spoke, “Oh, he definitely did check me out. We banged on the regular and I still look pretty good, with a more than smoking hot husband-to-be waiting at my beck-and-call. Can you blame him for looking at what he missed out on? And I wasn’t holding his hand. The fact I have had said hand inside me several times completely escaped my notice until
“I wouldn't miss it, Captain,” Tony acknowledged with a nod and watched Steve retreat into the en suite. His eyes trailed the length of Steve’s back, the narrow slip of his waist, and the impossibly thick muscle of his behind and legs.
He would do something about this.
“Doesn’t really answer my question, Steve,” He said, unclear about when he had become the one designated to coax out an adult conversation from the pair of them. He let his head drop back with a dull thud against the brick behind him as Steve unbuttoned his shirt from the bottom up, methodically revealing his toned stomach and scarred ribs. “Give me some artistic direction, huh? All I’ve got to work on here is that seeing me with Strange is doing something for you.”
It was like they shared an impossible secret. Something just for them, together. He leaned in and kissed Steve again. It felt like a celebration.
Tony’s lower lip dropped a little in surprise as he took in the man before him. He was indeed familiar, but ever so different from the man that he could remember in his mind's eye. Like himself, there was grey at his temples where there hadn’t been before, signs of age and wear set in over wrinkles around his eyes, too.
“All that time - more than
As the light materialised into a figure, Tony understood why the man looked so stricken.
was the one that had fucked around in his past; Tony had a right to demand explanations. If Steve got pissed and defensive then that was his own decision to make and they would have to deal.
“FRI, where is Captain A?” He stood, grabbing a pair of sunglasses and shoving them onto his nose. He scrunched up said nose then tossed the pair aside, replacing them with his normal spectacles.
“Thank God that’s over,” Carol muttered, shoulders tense around her ears. Tony liked her: she was self-assured in a way that a lot of people outside their group didn't like
After all, they could do that later, too.
(Carol had blinked twenty-three times and the pen-pot remained uncombusted).
“Don’t worry about being gentle, Cap, I’ll tell you if something’s up. Just -
“I’m not his keeper,” Carol replied, crossing her arms though she smiled. “If you want his attention you know where to find him.”
“God, you feel so good. You have to move. Slowly,
Tony waved a palm over the screen of his StarkPad, effectively hiding the program he had running that tracked FRIDAY’s progress with JARVIS. He settled the tablet onto his lap and directed his attention to the cursing bundle of beef tucked beside his hips where he sat against the headboard.
sex was the type to lounge.
Because Bucky had to have been lying to Peter; Steve couldn’t want him as he was
Pressed so close together, he could feel the lump of Steve’s growing erection through both layers of cotton between them. He couldn’t remember how it tasted, how it felt in his mouth, but he had thought of it often. Less so in the past few years, but it was a well-worn memory path. It had always been a shame that he had only one memory of it.
The design was based on schematics for a certain super-soldier but had been abandoned halfway through. He’d flipped the orientation, trimmed the bulk, and produced it in a smooth, brushed matte titanium-gold alloy (the flesh tone had felt too fake and plain steel too close to nightmares, but gold was ostentatious and suited him well. He made it an accessory so he couldn’t think of it as a hindrance: he couldn’t miss his original arm when this one was so freaking
“I am going to turn in for the evening; rouse me if there is a supper to be had,” Thor said, squeezing Tony’s bony elbow and patting Steve on a broad bicep as he turned off in the direction of the elevators. Thor had always been touchy and Tony was glad he hadn't lost that along with everything else. Sometimes he didn’t realise until Thor drew him into his side how touch-starved he had gotten the past few months.
Tony had left an open invitation to all of the Avengers as he and Bruce drove back to the tower together. At the time he hadn't taken it seriously, believing that Stark was showboating again... How little trust he had had; how different could things have been if he had let Tony give him a home?
"Stark."
Steve had to stop touching as Tony drew the top up his chest and over his shoulders. He tossed the fabric over his own shoulder before grabbing onto Steve’s, steadying himself with a shaky exhale. Steve’s hands found his waist and their lips met once more, coaxing and exploring, succumbing to each other in a way they hadn’t taken the time to do during their past union.
Thor was with Loki which probably wasn't the best idea considering the history of rivalry between them, but Bruce was along keeping watch. Although, the three of them
They stood, side-by-side, watching the rain and the wind roll in across the Mansion’s gardens and it was a long time before either of them moved again.
Sure, they'd met (and left early) at a few galas in the past; celebrating the hospital, the children, Stephen's godlike touch probably, et cetera. Tony turned up for the booze and good publicity and had always thought Strange was the same.
. We can do the strength test another time.”
With great ability comes great accountability, as the song goes.
“Please, please,” Steve whispered, shaking so violently that Tony was almost worried he would crumble apart like pieces of sandstone between cruel centuries.
Lang gasped, growing to full size. And, frankly, just when the
Tony was sure that if anything came up Sam would handle it.
to start investing.

In this timeline, he had always been with Steve.
not even in the dark to the ceiling with Steve holding him - truly holding him, not fighting to hold him back.
and Steve cried out, his pleasure spilling over to coat Tony’s cock and balls in thick clear ropes of spunk. The image burned into the possessive part of his brain. He would always have this; Tony's spent cock covered in his come.
He opened his mouth to reply when a cacophonic scream from above blared throughout the kitchen, stealing any thought he had from his tongue.
The rest of the team were likely sleeping or out of the Mansion. It didn't matter. Tony only needed one person for this.
- that was what pushed Steve over the edge, his pleasure slamming into him as he spilt down Tony’s throat. He arched back, both hands coming up to tug at his own hair as he cried out to the ceiling in disbelief, the shockwaves of his pleasure pulsing through him into Tony’s willing mouth. He felt his cock jerk over and over and Tony sucked him down greedily, mewling his appreciation.
Clint already felt like throwing up. He kept a fairly cool facade, though, until Coulson brought Nat into it. "Goddammit," he snarled, slamming his hand on Phil's desk. "I didn't fucking *know*! He seemed normal! I mean, I get that it was stupid, but how the hell was I supposed to know he was fucking possessed? I..." Running out of steam almost as quickly as he'd built it, Clint sagged into one of Coulson's chairs and ran a hand over his face, looking shell-shocked. "I didn't want..."
Steve knew he was staring and knew his mouth was hanging open, but he couldn't really do anything about it. The idea that Thor had been involved with his brother of all people left him utterly speechless. "It... was it... Nevermind, I guess it doesn't matter whether he knew Loki was adopted or not, they were raised together and... wow." He could barely process the information. Despite his intentions to leave it lie and a certainty that he probably didn't want to know more, Steve ventured, "What happened between them?"
Steve looked at him evenly. "If I find out any of this is a lie, I let Hulk and your brother settle who gets what pieces of you when it's done. Understood?"
Tony drew back in surprise. This was not how he'd imagined things would go. His analytical mind did not allow for errors, and Steve's actions threw the proverbial wrench into the works. It took Tony a moment to gather his thoughts, to process what had just happened. "What are you doing?" he asked softly. "I was chained down, drugged, and being fucked by your presumed dead best friend. And all the time I wanted it to be you." Tony shook his head in disbelief, even as his lips tingled from the kiss. "Why did you do that?"
Natasha's voice came back from the cockpit, "Almost there." Fury had sent Agent May along with them too, knowing that the more bodies they had the better. The two women had taken over the helm without a word. "Make sure you're locked and loaded, boys."
Tony twisted his hand against his bonds, wondering if he was imagining the fact that his captor seemed to be turning blue. He pretended to think over Loki's proposal, but it was obvious what he had to do. Keeping the two agents alive was still better than letting them die. Tony was fairly certain he was as good as dead already, but maybe if he kept Loki from getting bored with him, he'd survive long enough to escape. //Might as well make it count.// "Alright. If you're really that hard up for friends… deal. Me for their lives," he said, swallowing hard. He knew that making deals with Loki was a bad idea, but not playing along seemed like the shorter path to getting dead.

"Yes... yes, many of your names are familiar to me. May we speak of a mutual enemy, then?"
"I actually highlighted that in your file," Phil answered, reluctantly rolling away and getting out of bed. "I have a spare toothbrush." There was only so long that they could carefully avoid the issue, and he preferred to get the mundane things out of the way as quickly as possible. Phil went through his morning routine quickly and left the spare toothbrush in its plastic on the edge of the sink. "All yours. Also? That note in your file? I may have made that note in your file. Sorry."
It was a sentiment that Natasha had no trouble understanding. If she could have written out or written over some of her own history, she would have been sorely tempted. "There are worse things than blank spots. Meanwhile, let's go another round." It felt good, companionable, the four of them shooting even with Scott's less than traditional methods. She liked it. The normalcy - such as it was - reassured Natasha on a level she realized she'd been missing. In an utterly uncharacteristic lapse in focus, she didn't notice that anyone had joined them until another target started floating down the range. It was the grouping that followed more than anything else that alerted her to the identity of their companion a few stalls down. "Looks like Coulson's having a bad day." It wasn't his lack of precision that told her so, it was the fact that he wasn't bothering with center mass. Instead the head of the target looked like it was missing some pretty important higher brain function.
Clint tensed at the question. "That's..." His eyes slid to Nat. He'd been expected to kill her. He'd disobeyed orders, risked being put down himself. And his own recruitment hadn't been much smoother. You didn't often take SHIELD agents hostage and get pulled into the organization. You usually just got put down like a rabid dog. "That's actually surprisingly personal."
Logan picked a ribeye for himself, along with a nice craft beer. The waitress seemed quietly taken with them both, which Logan couldn't help but find amusing, at least until he remembered Jean's words. //"Girls always flirt with the bad guy, Logan; they don't take him home."// Recentering his attention on the moment at hand, he tilted his head at Steve. "So, I get the feelin' that in spite o' all the girls that throw themselves at you, you're still single. Nothin' caught your eye yet?"
Phil blinked, momentarily too stunned by the burst of familiarity to say anything, and then managed a smile. "Right. Yes, that would be me," he agreed. It was somehow a great deal more mortifying to be standing half naked in the gas station with someone he almost knew, but he was too grateful for the civilization to care. "Could I borrow your phone?"
Logan raised his head to watch Scott, trying to keep from thrusting up into the man's mouth. He figured Scott had probably taken enough abuse, and judging by the bruises on his lover's hips, Clint likely hadn't used kid gloves on any part of Scott. The hand in Scott's hair moved away, trailing over the man's shoulders, sliding over his arm, tracing his ear and jawline. Logan wanted to cement the moment in his mind: Scott looking up at him with beautifully darkened blue eyes as his throbbing shaft slowly disappeared into the man's throat.
"It's a strong step in the right direction," Jemma agreed, "and if any of the difficulties he encounters are chemical rather than, well, magical, we should be able to help even more." Psychology was a long way from her area of expertise, and the same was certainly true of whatever properties Asgardian technology dealt with. A chemical imbalance or other true scientific interruption of Clint's normal bodily functions was a puzzle she could work to solve, especially with Bruce and Fitz working on the problem as well. "What do you say we take a stroll through the park before we head back? I think a bit of fresh air might do us good."
"It's been an education," Scott answered with a smile. Sif wasn't exactly a laid back, relaxed sort of lady. Still, she was undeniably fascinating. Talking to Sif and Thor was like interacting with characters from a book of fairy tales, at once strange and intriguing. "You and Natasha get Creed checked into his brand new temporary home?" Though he knew that Creed was Logan's brother, he mostly just thought of the guy as a crazy pain in the ass, and the idea of him being permanently under lock and key was soothing. One less nutjob in the world was always a good thing.
Wincing at the obviously unspoken part of the statement, Simmons forced another smile. "It's nothing to worry about. Routine excursion." She had absolutely no idea what a routine excursion really looked like, but she prayed it was like what they had planned. "Really."
"Tony, you're being a dick," Bruce said as if he was politely telling the man he had lint on his shirt.
A little more Pepper and Steve helping each other out with emotional health, and a tiny dash of science.
Scott grinned up at her and, with Logan positioned behind her, sank to the floor and hooked his thumbs beneath her panties. He dragged them down, kissing his way up Natasha's thigh. While she braced herself on his shoulders and by leaning back into Logan's chest, Scott licked carefully at the woman's clit. He loved the sound of her breath catching, and the way her hips rolled sinuously.
Hank, deciding that Steve had Mystique handled for the moment, swooped in to give Pyro a nudge toward a patch of ice he hadn't quite gotten to, hoping to send him sliding and give Bobby a chance to gain ground against him.
Logan nodded. He had to keep reminding himself of that. It was tough to get past the delicate state he'd found Scott in, but he had to remember that most people put in Scott's place would've been just as likely to end up dead or permanently crazy. Logan pressed himself close to Scott, letting his own throbbing shaft rest against his lover's thigh as he slowly pressed one finger into Scott's body. Logan watched himr closely, relishing the sight of those full lips parted in pleasure, and the hooded blue eyes that Logan couldn't get enough of.
Scott heard himself actually whimper in response, but he didn't particularly care. He just let Logan fuck him while his eyes drifted closed. The desperation was rising, and soon Scott's eyes flew open again. They locked at once on Logan's face, trailing over the sweat as it made a path down to the man's neck and the powerful muscles straining. He reached between their bodies and gave his cock a few harsh strokes. That was all it took before Scott came. His lips went slack beneath Logan's while his body went tight, squeezing Logan's cock hard inside him.
In fact, Tony had almost backed out several times. Every time he tried to convince himself having dinner with Steve was a bad idea, he reminded himself of how open and caring the other man had been. Tony could not disappoint him. So, he showered and cleaned himself up for what felt like the first time in ages. Looking a little more like a billionaire playboy and less like a vagrant hobo, Tony dressed and slipped on one of his favorite rock and roll T-shirts before stepping out. It did not take him long to make his way to Steve's apartment. Tony wished the journey had given him enough time to dismiss an uncharacteristic bout of nerves. He stood in front of Steve's door for a good five minutes, breathing and gathering his composure. Finally he reached out and knocked, clearing his throat at the same time. "I hope dinner's ready," Tony called out, "because there's a drop dead handsome man waiting to eat."
"I like that idea," Phil agreed with a smile. It was nice to know that the day had meant something to Clint too, that he hadn't been making up the personal connectivity in his head. When they pulled into the parking lot, he scoped the place out and felt relieved to see at least some mix of ages. Most of the crowd looked to be in their late 20s and 30s, but at least he felt satisfied that he wouldn't look like a creepy old man next to the others. "Looks nice."
Logan had to bite back more snark at the sight of the pajamas. They looked like something Beaver Cleaver's dad would have worn. For his part, Logan would've prefered his long pajama pants, but tighty whities would do in a pinch. He shrugged off his motorcycle jacket, peeled off his shirt, undershirt, and beat up jeans and then settled onto the edge of the bed. The mattress gave under his adamantium-laced weight, but held well enough. "Nice," he remarked before crawling under the sheets.
Logan's expression shifted to one of fear, and he pulled Scott closer to him, holding him with protective gentility that belied his aggression the moment before. It was his fault. He knew it was. And now he'd brutalized the man he'd set out to protect, as well as having invited some psychotic alien to muddle with his lover's thoughts. "Maybe... look, you don't know that. Maybe it's just me. I'll go turn myself in and... and you'll be fine, darlin'."
Steve cursed under his breath and clutched the comforter in his hands. It was better than grabbing onto Tony and risking hurting him. He almost decided to warn the man against pushing himself too hard again but thought better of it. Steve just wanted him not to stop. He stared down at Tony as his lover's cheeks hollowed and the suction became delicious to the point of near pain.
"Sure. Of course." Steve drew away a little but wouldn't let go entirely, his hand clinging to Tony's. He knew she only needed so much access and made a note to bring the woman flowers for not batting an eyelash.
Darien found himself staring at the thug as he scrambled up, looked around in a wild panic, then spat on the floor and all but ran out the front door. "Jesus..." He jumped at the feeling of Clint's hand settling on his knee and managed an uneasy laugh. "So, uh, I'm guessing that is your idea of a good time?" He was pretty sure he was freaked out, but underneath that, there was something else. Darien's adrenaline was flowering, and he found himself wondering if the bathrooms were too disgusting to be worth checking out for a quickie after all.
Bruce smirked back at the mutant, finding it amusing that Logan seemed almost as uncertain of the bridge's integrity as he was. He glanced back to Sif. "So what's our first stop? I can't imagine we'll go unnoticed long. Even less long under the... uh... wrong circumstances."
We all deserve some smut after chapter 1. We've earned it.
Clint sighed and rested an arm over the one around him. "This is. Thanks," he said, smiling when Phil gave him a puzzled look. "For planning it. And for... I don't know. Just thanks." He fell silent, taking in the crowds around them and the middling band and Phil's aftershave. Strong fingers laced with Phil's, and he sighed contentedly. An urge tickled at the back of his mind for several moments before he finally gave in to it, turning his head to press his lips to his handler's throat, lingering a little longer than completely appropriate and not really feeling too terribly ashamed for it.
While Fitz looked utterly uncomfortable thinking about Stark and Rogers together, but Simmons' expression softened. She could imagine all too well after seeing the aftermath of the whole thing. "Sir? We've got all the figures we need, and we'll all need to get a bit of rest tonight. If you wanted to check in on Captain Rogers... We all worry, Sir, is all," she explained, trying to make it sound as if they needed the information as much as Tony. "A bit of dinner, some rest, then we're all back in the game come the wee hours of the morning."
"Tony." Bruce waited for the other man to face him. "We are not risking you, too. We can't keep sacrificing people."
"I need to fix Logan." It was clear that he wouldn't be able to help them all. If Steve could stand up to one more bout with the gun, he could help Logan and then Logan would be free to save Scott from whatever spell Loki had cast. "Help me up," Steve requested quietly.
Jean sighed. "I hope so."
Loki flinched at the words, unable to check the reaction, and snapped, "Yes, I believe that I will continue turning blue as it seems to be what I've been doing since you shot me with that stupid gun." He stated pacing and finally stopped and whirled on the mortal lounging in feigned comfort. Loki knew how out of sorts Stark was whatever the pretense. "Perhaps this will serve me well. The mutants have looked to me as a useful ally but certainly not one of theirs. This may yet help me find their good graces."
Logan crossed his arms and raised an eyebrow. "So... can't wait to meet that guy. He seems like fun."
"Put me on speakerphone."
Clint snorted softly. "Yeah, I think he needed therapy when he got here. Speaking of which, shouldn't we be checking that video feed? Or just checking on Logan himself? I feel a little nervous not knowing what he's doing or where he is. Like he's going to show up and stab me. Pretty sure we're not friends," he said, though he didn't really seem concerned. "Also, how the hell are we supposed to cure him? Somehow, I think hitting him in the head with a scaffold railing won't work."
Finally Steve stood, took a breath, and said aloud, "I can do this," knowing that Pepper wasn't about to make fun of him for needing the external assurance. All he got from her was a small nod before he made his way downstairs. In the lab - painfully quiet without Tony's energy filling the room, and Steve had to fight back tears yet again - he found Simmons hunched over a computer, barely awake, and Fitz curled up in a ball on the cot snoring softly. "Agent Simmons?"
"So long as it's not your own, I think you're fine," Tony quipped, the overhead lights illuminating his bedroom the moment he stepped inside. He quickly threw open the closet doors and began selecting something more comfortable for Steve. "This might just fit you," he decided, offering Steve a black T-shirt and a pair of sweat pants. Tony handed over the articles of clothing, giving the other man what seemed like a careful examination. "With all those muscles you might stretch them out," he decided, "so if you want to keep these, you're welcome to them."
Fury looked annoyed to see Loki. Then again, he usually looked annoyed about most things. He growled the god's name, sounding thoroughly disgusted that Loki was a prisoner and not a corpse. "Have a seat, gentlemen. And I guess the dead man can have a chair, too." He glowered at Steve. "Captain Rogers, if this... person did anything but surrender to you, I want a really good explanation of why he's still standing up."
"Mmhmm," Clint murmured, barely awake himself. He was out a moment later.
“Not to be disturbed. Right. I know the drill. Tell him I’m coming down anyway.”
"We don't know if anyone can."
The archer sighed and settled back into his seat, managing to wiggle around in the harness enough to rest his head on Coulson's shoulder. He was too tired to realize that the other agents present might wonder about the gesture, instead falling gratefully into sleep.
"You will," Scott answered with a flicker of a smile. Logan was more the hero than he pretended to be. If he hadn't been, Scott might never have thought twice about Jean walking away. Unfortunately Logan wasn't quite the loner he pretended to be. Underneath his prickly exterior, he cared. He wasn't a cuddly teddy bear, but he was a good man. That was what had made him dangerous. Jean saw that goodness as clearly as anyone - maybe more clearly than anyone but Rogue. "There are worse things to do with your time. I think over the past few weeks I've done most of them."
"Never say no to an offer like that." Especially since he had been instructed to make sure things would be as difficult as possible for the man after his rescue. The Avengers would be focused on his ordeal, think of that as the punishment. In truth it was little more than a catalyst. On the table full of instruments next to Tony's cot was a package of condoms and a tube of lubricant. Hydra was nothing if not thorough. The Soldier smiled grimly to himself and stroked his own cock to full hardness before releasing the ties holding Tony's legs to the table. He was too far gone to need them. With no further time spent on preparation and instead a liberal dollop of lube, he lifted the man's legs, spread them and slid home between. "Is that what you need?"
Darien was pretty sure someone sounding as sexy as Nat did in that moment should be illegal. If he hadn't already been working to get off, he would've started then. He bit his lip to keep from making any sound that might interrupt the pair. The truth was that he wanted to see the end of the show too.
"You look better without 'em, too," Logan remarked before he thought about it. He wasn’t in the habit of holding back what was on his mind, but he hadn't realized that was what was on his mind. When he did think about it for a second, Scott's bright blue eyes were very- //Woah. Wait. Now you're just bein' weird. And the guy just got through gettin' handed around by a bunch of guys who wanted to fuck him stupid. He probably doesn't want anyone hittin' on him//. Not that Scott had ever really struck Logan as likely to be into men, anyway.  Looking as embarrassed as he ever had the decency to get, Logan stared intently at his bottle. "But I get it. Feelin' useful's kinda important."
