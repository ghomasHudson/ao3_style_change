Steve grinned. "No-one goes off Tony Stark's radar." He paused and shook his head. "You know, for me, a year ago radar was still pretty much top secret and now it's an idiom."
"They may not know that. Even so, I'd rather not take a commercial flight to New York or Washington and put other people in danger, particularly when we have Betty with us, and I'm certainly not going to leave either her or you on your own—"
He shrugged. "Most relationships I've been in have lasted less than a week." In most cases less than twenty-four hours, if he was honest.
Danvers grinned at him. "I'll remember that's the case. But this isn't official. In fact, if anyone finds out I'm talking to you about Jim, I'm in deep shit. You have resources no one else has, Stark. Will you look for him?"
It didn't startle him the way his surroundings had, which was odd, and the man in the suit was younger than he had somehow expected.
Yesterday... yesterday, before he strengthened it, he would have been dead by now. He had promised Steve he would come back and he was going to do that. Dying was simply no longer a possibility.
Pepper made a noise that was half disapproving, half amusement. "I need one, Tony. You'd better be telling me the truth. See you soon."
Interestingly, none of the other 'agents' escorting them had attempted to shoot Storm. They had, however, ordered the hangar cleared of personnel, and Base Commander MacTavish had had the tarmac cleared and the runways shut down.
The portal snapped shut at the same moment as the hatch. Danvers sent the jet rocketing high into the sky, outrunning the shockwave as the drone exploded.
"Your arrival complicates things," Jan said sharply. "And you didn't crash our party on the off chance that Tony knew something about James Rhodes."
"Which is the reason I called you," Thor said. "Jane and Selvig will not leave their equipment. I cannot both protect them and move them and it to safety."
Tony chuckled. "Jarvis, make a note: Steve enjoys rough sex but feels guilty afterwards. So, remind me to go no further than role play scenarios, with maybe just a little light bondage."
He fired the repulsor blasts directly at her hands. The egg-shaped object flew high into the air where it hovered as the woman took a step, but only a single step, backwards.
He wasn't entirely sure why he had brought the shield. It had been safe in New York – ought to be perfectly safe in New York – but he didn't want to let it far out of his reach. And it was as safe – safer – here.
"Bucky?" Steve snorted. "I grew up with Bucky. Since I was three I spent as much – more – time with his family than I did with my mother because she worked so hard. His mom even looked after me sometimes when I was sick and my mom had to be on shift. When I wasn't in his apartment, he was in ours. He was
"Sleep, Tony. Your father's files have waited since... well, since the war, I guess. They can wait another few hours."
More displays were appearing. All he needed now were the repulsors... and there they were, if at minimal power. Still, he could move upwards. And there might enough power to extract sufficient oxygen from the seawater to keep him alive – not to mention remove excess carbon dioxide before it killed him.
He needed to take out every single one of them before he flew through the portal and was well on his way to achieving that when the newly-arrived woman managed to snatch out her gun as she dived for cover.
Every fifteen minutes or so, the Panther would lower the cloaking device for a few seconds – and without them being blown to tiny pieces, to Tony's relief. Indeed, the Panther seemed to feel safe enough to resume his chanting, though at first it was plain that the road, maybe fifty feet away, was busy with traffic and the sky was dotted with distant headlights as well as stars.
, Steve said, "You were kidnapped by terrorists who tried to force you to build weapons, but you built the first Iron Man armour and escaped..."
Tony looked at his father with what he suspected was an obvious air of disappointment. "He was bursting out of that SHIELD uniform, and he seemed confused," was all he could come up with.
Now thoroughly caffeinated and, without Steve there to chide him, there was little point in teetering on the edge of caffeine poisoning so he didn't bother ordering another.
T'Challa chuckled. "The members of the Dora Milaje are also, in tradition, the king's wives in training. So not that much in common, Captain."
By the time they reached the hospital, Tony's vision had begun to return, in that blobs were floating over the blackness. He pointed this out – loudly – to Bruce, but it didn't stop the other man threatening to call out the Hulk – or wait for Steve – if Tony didn't take off the helmet and come with him.
It was cold down there. Even colder than here, unless he was falling more quickly than he had calculated.
"Jarvis, repeat the briefing you gave me twenty minutes ago," Tony ordered, though he really did not want to listen to it again. Instead, he helped himself to coffee and bagels and listened with half an ear as Jarvis recounted the events that had led to the departure of Jan and Steve from Malibu, and their eventual arrival at Travis airbase.
Tony's mind was racing as they made their way out of the inner compound. He was sure Steve could take out their escort at any time, with or without help from him, but the bowmen on the walls worried him, as they would anyone who had worked with Hawkeye. Nor, having encountered the spears, was he at all sure that the bows or the arrows were anything like as primitive as they seemed. Maybe these people didn't need guns at all, and the one Steve was carrying might tip the odds in their favour.
These people plainly knew more about the Infinity Stones than he did, which was presumably why this Tony and Natasha had brought him – and probably them – here. This made sense of their talk of 'magicians' so this was almost certainly Strange's Sanctum which, he now recalled, was in Greenwich Village. Strange wouldn't be here yet, but his predecessor, the Ancient One, would.
As a last act before he left, he released the worm that would, eventually, scramble all the data and the backups.
"Yeah, but you still might have to answer to the Pentagon, and there are people in the USAF that I don't trust any more than I trust SHIELD," Tony said.
was what Steve thought but he battened down on his instinctive – and unwanted – reaction. He said, in measured tones, "It's a symmetrical, but interesting, face. I wonder if he'd let me draw him." Not that he hadn't been sketching Tony without his permission, though he was probably vain enough to be flattered by the attention, anyway.
It was then that the HUD showed someone appearing out of the portal, causing a moment's hesitation on the part of the leader of the fleeing group, but only a moment before he continued on. Plainly, the newcomer was known to him.
The hologram turned slowly in the air in front of him, each rotation building another layer of detail, until it became recognisable as a helmet, though with far more appendages than Tony considered feasible, including a spectacular pair of antennae. Inside, it was packed with electronics which controlled a tiny but sophisticated chemical factory as well as some things even Tony did not understand, though he knew he could construct them.
"Well, that was an interesting entrance," Bruce's voice said dryly, with the faint echo that meant Tony was hearing him naturally as well as through the radio. "Can you get up?"
"Yeah. You know, expert at shrinking things. And if you've got the technology to shrink someone, it's not that hard to adapt it to make them grow."
"But not tonight," Bruce's voice was firm as he busied himself at the kitchenette, returning with a glass full of water, which he offered to Tony, along with two capsules. "Take these and get a good night's sleep."
"No. All the indicators suggest this is tied in somehow to Peggy's grave, maybe to her death, and we're only here because Sharon Carter – if that's her real name – told us the location of the grave. And I doubt very much that she or Romanoff would have spilled that without Fury's say so."
Which was patently untrue, but Steve sensed that Tony was not in the least scared for either of them, so he held back.
It occurred to Steve that he could not remember the word 'sorry' coming so easily to Tony's lips. Pondering this, he slid out of bed, hesitated, then pulled on the scarlet robe and tied the belt firmly. He could feel Tony's eyes following him, and turned, resolutely, to face him. "You'd better not mean that," he said. "Because you didn't do anything I didn't want."
. He probably crewed it with SHIELD scientists and certainly sent it post haste into the frozen north. SHIELD had given up on Cap too."
Moments later, the place was silent. The only things Tony could hear were the harsh breathing of the gunmen, someone whimpering with fright and the occasional thud of falling plaster.
But Tony recognised that voice. He had heard it time and time again as he played over the recording of 'his' conversation on Peggy Carter's supposed phone number, and now Jarvis threw a photograph of Peggy Carter up on the HUD.
Besides, these flashes of the worst clips from a badly made movie in his mind were the only way he would ever see Bucky and Peggy again...
Tony grinned. "So you're less credulous than Loki. Good. Do you really have objections to any actions Captain Rogers has taken? Any point at which he has not been the perfect moral superhero?"
Xavier could not quite hide his own smile, though he bowed his head so that perhaps only Steve saw it. When he raised it again his expression was bland. "And my senior students are Jean Grey and Scott Summers."
"No, Tony. It's not worth it." He saw Tony's face fall, and added, "Not just to satisfy my curiosity. Save it for a real emergency."
Tony threw himself in the chair, swung round three times just for the hell of it, and instructed Jarvis to get Bruce Banner on the secure video-link.
"No, thank you, Mr Stark. I'm afraid that this cannot be considered a social call," Cheyo said, a little gruffly.
There was another flash, seemingly from the air, and this time Steve thought he saw... well, something... in the air.
Bruce took a deep breath. "Actually... er... we've had radio reception for the last twenty minutes."
"Dead. Thor didn't want to believe it either, so..." He should not have let the Asgardian take Steve's body, but, just for the moment, in Thor's presence, there had been a tiny thread of hope.
"Oh." All Steve's anger had drained away, and he was having trouble fighting off a wave of shame that followed it. Tony had been so danged generous – and kind.
Steve looked at him with amused affection. "I know you love me, Tony. It was the only reason I agreed to this; that after all the things I've said to you, I've done to you, you still took me in, cared for me, took me to bed..."
Wait, wait. The stones. Where were the Infinity Stones? Oh God, had he failed at the very start of his mission?
"I'm not concussed, just pissed that I missed the chance of getting out of here," Tony retorted. "Well, at least now both of us are missing someone will eventually look for us."
Steve had not protested about the wine, hoping that it would make Tony relax a little and, indeed, by the time they reached the ice cream and coffee the conversation had started to flow again, though neither of them referred to the angry exchange at the pool. There were odd pauses, though, and they had lost their physical easiness.
Tony had brought the vehicle under control by frantic use of the yoke and rudder, and was gaining height, circling up above the compound.
"I had visitors. From Asgard. Thor's back, and in exile, apparently, because he got his mom to save Steve's life. Steve is back too, a bit shaken up and not at his full strength, but getting there."
"Maybe," Jan said, "But someone had gone to some lengths to make sure it couldn't be identified as hers. Luckily," she smiled a little, and her eyes shifted to Hank for a moment, "the researcher involved believed in record redundancy."
Steve leaned in close. "Luckily," he whispered, "considering considering your usual response to authority."
"The government compound," N'kendi said, as more of those ceremonial warriors paced towards the SUV. They were wearing what looked like a form of lightweight armour, but Tony could see only edged weapons. None of the warriors carried anything that looked like a modern projectile weapon.
Tony fired, and the air shimmered in an expanding cone that embraced the warrior, who gasped, and tumbled backwards, the blade flying from his hand. It hit the floor of the walkway, slicing through the ceramic and burying itself to the hilt.
." He scrubbed at his eyes with the heels of his hands, as if that would somehow stop the tears he didn't want to acknowledge.
"He's filled me in what happened during the time I was in Asgard," Steve replied, trying for neutrality.
"I'm sorry, Colonel," Suit-and-sunglasses said, sounding not in the least sorry. "I'm also a Federal agent and I am in charge here. You'd better just stand back and let us get on with our jobs."
It turned out to be easy, again using Extremis, to isolate those labs being used by SHIELD. Then, this time using the personnel department (one overworked clerk who doubled as the building manager and a small PC) plus the internal network directory, it was just as simple to trace Dr Paula Morganti and her small, high-powered team to a particular building.
Fear, as dreadful as that when he had faced Thanos, had him in his grip. His contact with the stones began to slip.
"Nope. A mutant," Tony said. "There are a lot of them around. Xavier trains them to use their powers for good. And he really does read minds. So does one of his students. I've met her. She was on the run and we worked together to defeat this big time supervillain mutant called Magneto. I'll call the Westchester school in the morning. Even if Xavier brushes me off, Jean should be able to get me in to see him. But I think he'll be intrigued enough to help."
Betty was frowning. "If you didn't know who I was how can you be sure who my father is? And so confident he had nothing to do with your powers?"
Before today, Steve would have probably snorted and ignored him, careless of his own safety and impatient with any suggestion of caution from the notably   reckless Tony Stark. But everything had changed: not his feelings, but the knowledge that Tony reciprocated them, that he – that they – had a chance to make something together.
It seemed like years before Steve's fingers withdrew, and Tony took one breath after another, trying to contain his loss and his need. Then he heard the snap of the condom and grinned to himself.
The man went down but his gun rattled as his figure tightened convulsively on the trigger, the shells ploughing runnels in the soil.
"Howard?" Steve frowned. "Howard set out to trap people and starve them to death? That hardly sounds likely. If he did, he must have been desperate to protect someone or something. He can hardly have meant to kill us."
Tony swore and brushed the equations hanging in the air aside. "Fuck it, Jarvis! I don't want that woman here."
Three stones still sat in the pockets built into the foam interior of the case – Red and Purple and Blue, Reality and Power and Space. Good. The two that he had sent onward had gone, though whether he had sent them into the correct position and time was uncertain.
Xavier deserved to know the truth. "I don't think I am Captain America," Steve said, and felt Tony's hand tighten on his shoulder so hard it ought to hurt – but didn't.
"Don't mention it. Indeed, let me emphasise that you don't mention it. Because there isn't anything to mention. Particularly if doing so will bring the IRS down on my head."
If Captain America had really come back to himself, he might already be ashore. But the last time Tony had seen him, drawn to the lab by morbid curiosity, he had floated naked in the tank, unmoving, eyes closed, all his hair removed – though apparently the serum caused problems with that – attached to the life-support machines by a series of tubes that ventilated him, fed him, and removed bodily waste. The machines that measured his metabolism actually showed more animation, if not much.
"I don't know what talents you have as a magician, but you certainly have one for understatement." It sounded like Natasha.
Instantly, images of Clint and Natasha appeared in front of them. He hadn't had time to update the tech here, so they were visible as if a screen was hovering in the air, rather than the full holographic three-dimensional version available in the Tower.
By the time he wrapped himself in a soft, thick blanket and settled down to sleep, Tony was even more annoyed. Said 'camp bed', which had unfolded, expanded and assembled itself, complete with pillow and mattress, appeared to be made of some sophisticated shape-memory polymer. There was no doubt now that T'Challa had not been kidding about how advanced Wakanda's technology actually was. Tony's only comfort was that Hank was going to be even more annoyed when he heard about it.
"You're a definitely a billionaire – there weren't any in my day, but then with inflation – and a philanthropist. There's no doubt about your genius. What you didn't mention was how darn kind you are."
"Jay, I remain impressed by my own genius in creating you. I presume you have hacked both CODIS and the Pentagon's database. Who was it?"
As he swooped lower, he saw the bodies in the water, making his path clear. Scan for body heat. Pick up anyone who showed signs of life and transport them to shore and the waiting ambulances.
Steve stared helplessly at his reflection in the screen of the laptop which had gone black of its own accord about fifteen minutes ago.
Steve turned, his face lighting up momentarily before it darkened again. "Tony. You're back." He took a deep breath and forced a smile. "Did you have a good time with your girl?"
Tony shrugged. He didn't understand that himself or why he was bristling at his father's challenges. Howard always challenged him: it was one of the reasons Tony adored him.
It was the presence of someone else, someone familiar, that Tony noticed first. Until then he had floated, content, in the strange orange light; now, though, the light shifted colour, more yellow than red. Suddenly, he was reading patterns; emotion, algorithms... thoughts...
"No longer an issue." Tony turned to Pepper. "The Porsche is in the lot." He tossed the key to her. "Take care of it."
Pepper gave a very unladylike snort. "Tony relied on me to do the things he doesn't consider important, and he never considered what I thought about them. He doesn't
Tony was following in Steve's tracks as they explored the woods on the other side of the valley from the Devil's Ironing Board, for once happy that the other man couldn't watch him closely. Even better, that conversation was practically impossible.
Leaving it to Clea to finish up, Tony glanced at Jean to make sure she was all right – judging by the way she was frowning at a tear in her costume, he didn’t think she was in any distress. When the tear miraculously mended itself, he was certain of it.
Determining to keep a firm hold on his tongue, Tony held out his hand and said, "I'm Tony Stark. Welcome to my tower. What can I do for you?"
"I'm sorry I lost my temper, Tony," Steve said. "I was scared too. But that's no excuse for forgetting you've already had to cope with me being dead. I'll try to take more account of your feelings in future, I promise."
Carefully, Steve put his shield down and reached out to take the bottle while Tony was concentrating on holding the glass steady on its way to his lips, ignoring the annoyed whirr from the robot arm, and looked up into his teammate's eyes. "Tell me who left you, Tony."
It was something from memory, though, because there was an occasional discordant note, a fluff that somehow made it even more endearing. Steve guessed that it was something that, if he hadn't skipped the last seventy years, he would have recognised.
He opened the refrigerator door, looked at the choices available to him, winced, and went to pour himself a whisky.
Tony's guts were melting, turning to jello, if jello had been heated to the boiling point, as memories flooded back. But the most vivid were not of his own sensations, but of Steve's reactions, of the way he had given himself completely into Tony's hands, submitted – Captain America, who could break him in half with his bare hands, had submitted to him openly and enthusiastically – his quiet moans, pleas, the way his hands had gripped the pillows convulsively at each thrust...
Jan shrugged. "No idea. The Hulk carried him in and he could have bailed out anywhere en route. I came courtesy of Jarvis and the Iron Man suit. Hank doesn't want to 'play superhero,'" she added inconsequentially.
"Nor am I. But it's a helluva selfish way to grieve for Peggy. And to take advantage of your kindness."
Tony shrugged. "He may have forgotten about it. It was over twenty years between the base here being decommissioned and his death, and he'd been pretty much soaking himself in alcohol for at least three quarters of those years that I know about."
Through the grey pre-dawn twilight Steve could see the navigation lights of a strangely-shaped aircraft that reminded him nothing so much as a miniature version of the
"Shh. Shh," Tony kissed the tears leaking onto his cheeks. "You should have told me. It doesn't matter to me. It's you. Just you."
Jarvis's scans provided the location of slowly cooling bodies but no sign of actual endothermic life, other than themselves. If there had been any bats here, they had probably decided to be elsewhere, probably in advance of the human invasion of their territory. Though the lack of guano made it unlikely there had ever been any at all.
"At first I presumed they had instituted new code, sir. When it became clear that the network had vanished entirely, I did inform Captain Rogers."
"Yeah. And my tech. Even the thing keeping me alive. Well, Pep says I'm lousy at judging people. Like Obie. And Phil. And Natasha. And Thor. And you. Jury's still out on Fury..."
"Uh-huh. He's not the only one who needs to decide what his next step is going to be." Tony hitched his stool closer to Steve, not touching, but close enough so that their arms would brush if Steve leaned forward.
"Clint and I will make some calls," Natasha said. "Though if we are going to intimidate anyone we may have to head for Washington."
There were definitely only two people – gods, whatever – on the beach, one taller than the other, both glowing white against the darkness of the cold Pacific as the wind-driven breakers rolled on and parted for them. The shorter of the two men had a hood thrown up against the weather, or to conceal his identity, but the other was unmistakeable.
"Just get on it. Also look for high-energy signatures or, even better, energy dead areas. They may be using their cloaking device, or whatever it is."
"Yeah, apart from that. Sandro was heading for the coast and gaining in strength. It could have devastated cities from Virginia to Maine."
It was the man from the flying sail ship; Tony refrained from asking him where he was keeping Puff the Magic Dragon on the principle that, in the circumstances, he might just produce him. Instead, he raised the faceplate and the armour's force shields at the same moment so that the warrior could see his face without compromising his own safety.
The falling sun laid a path of dazzling light across the lake, throwing the mountain peaks into black silhouettes and swathing the forest covered hills in shadow, hiding all traces of man's presence even from Steve's serum-enhanced vision; the extensive villas, the boathouses, the marina, the expensive retirement homes and the discreetly luxurious hotels were all invisible, isolating him on the deserted terrace.
"The stone," he said. "You are sure it fell into the sea? That Kar— that the witch did not manage to retrieve it?"
Something wasn't right here. The mixture of outdated fortification and ancient weapons did not square with the airfield, roads and SUVs. Those spears and arrows must be more than they seemed – unless they were a diversion, camouflage – and he would bet that that the thorn fence around the outer compound wasn't thorn at all but some unidentifiable alloy masquerading as thorn.
When Thor had gone, Tony put a couple of shots of brandy in a big mug of black coffee and sugared it heavily, then made his way back to the master bedroom where he sat watching Steve sleep, sipping at the alcohol-laced coffee and trying to decide what he should do.
There was a pause while Jarvis, who operated in nano-seconds, contemplated the pun. "At once, sir," he said, finally.
The Ferrari's speedometer needle was edging towards the 200 mph mark, but that wasn't anywhere near as fast as the War Machine armour. Even as he wondered why whoever was in it – not Rhodey, please, not Rhodey – wanted to kill them, the road in front of them exploded.
"I overheard you arguing with Miss Potts," Steve interrupted. "She was angry with you for exposing yourself to danger, and I've made that worse."
"You've been checking up on me!" Tony shouldn't be delighted, but it showed the sort of interest from Steve he had only dreamed about. What else had he been hiding under that pose of total disinterest? "God, have you seen the Santa Barbara video? Because even I'm ashamed of that one."
Perhaps that was why he had spent so much time with Steve, who was desperately grateful for even this short break in his isolation.
or at least cast someone other than Leo as Abagnale, because then no-one would have noticed how easy it was to be a pilot when you weren't, and the airlines wouldn't have tightened their internal checks and I wouldn't have had to be so free with the bribes. C'mon, let me do the eyebrows. Please? I've watched Pep often enough."
"We've lost track of him," Tony said, hoping that this was indeed the case. "He phones 'Peggy' I need to know at once. Personally."
He hit the surface, cleaving the water neatly, diving deeper, deeper, stroking hard away from the trajectory of the falling mass of metal – he wasn't guessing at the tonnage –
Then the hands were back, and cloth was being wrapped round him – the comforter from the couch, probably – then Steve's arms slid under him, lifting him.
The 'resident biochemical genius' was Dr Henry Pym – Hank, apparently, to everyone – a surprisingly powerful man in his thirties; blond, handsome and intense. Jan's attention was focused on him immediately and exclusively. Bruce treated him with the utmost respect and Tony refrained from both poking and insulting him. The three male scientists went into an immediate huddle around the sphere.
But he could wait. Tony had promised that they would talk this through, and he was going to hold him to it.
– which meant the caller was Marilyn, who was still nagging at him to replace it with the theme from
"PTSD – Post Traumatic Stress Disorder," Fury had said. "They called it Battle Fatigue in your day, and Shell Shock before that. You're neither the first nor the last to experience it, soldier."
This was no place for his playboy persona, and no place either for the smartass genius that was the closest he dared come with other people to who he really was. Okay, time for tough-businessman-Tony-Stark to put in an appearance, with the smartass genius in reserve.
Blessing Washington's restriction on building height, Tony spiralled outwards, keeping to about a hundred and fifty feet above the streets and rooftops. There were all too many people glowing cheerfully on the streets below him but even the SHIELD agents had seemed to have stopped running.
There was another flash in the air, and the helmet jerked from its path. Steve reached out a casual hand to catch it, though right then his attention was all on the flutter of iridescent wings as the Wasp went tumbling towards the ground.
"Oh, magic," Tony muttered, trying not to sound totally sceptical. T'Challa plainly believed this rubbish, but his imagination promptly provided Steve and Pepper in chorus telling him to keep his views to himself while he needed T'Challa's good will. "That shouldn't affect the armour's sensors – or Jarvis, the AI that runs the suit."
Making up his mind, he began to swim towards the dark bulk of the shore blocking the stars in front of him, ignoring the call of the city lights.
Tony didn't struggle but instead said, earnestly, "Steve, listen to me. You know your metabolism's accelerated, that you need more calories per day than most people, right? And that if you can't get those calories your body compensates? But if that goes on long enough, the serum will start shutting down unnecessary functions, the way it did in the ice. Hunger may be one of those. You've got to let me go get you some food... chocolate and Powerbars to start with, then we'll weigh in with the proteins. Now, let go, huh? I'll be back, promise."
"Wow!" Pepper flung back her own head – her hair was longer now, drawn into a chignon, and seemed a shade or two darker red – and stared up at him, brown eyes theatrically wide under arching brows. "What have you done with little Tony? Or are you wearing heels?" Her eyes moved down to his feet, as if she expected to find his shoes had lifts.
"Maybe, but has it occurred to you could hurt Steve quite badly here? All this flim flam from SHIELD doesn't mean that this Peggy might not still be alive but senile or dying in a hospice somewhere or simply doesn't want anything to do with a man she knew seventy years ago..."
Natasha ignored the question and, instead, pointed to the object half hidden by Steve's curled body. "Is that Thor's hammer?"
Then her expression of shock and suspicion vanished in a friendly smile. "Captain America. Jarvis told me you'd left the building and Tony had gone to find you. Was there trouble?"
"Yes, Mom," he said, and nibbled tentatively at the chocolate. Moments later he was wolfing down everything Tony offered, taking huge bites and barely chewing before he swallowed
The second floor of the Executive Residence had two human heat signatures. The one in the East Sitting Hall he presumed to be the President's. The other was in one of the bedrooms. If that was who he thought it was, he might be able to get in without lasering any locks.
Even as he spoke, the helicopter was raising a spout of water, smoke and flame on the surface of the river.
"Howard! The gun!" Steve held up his hand and the weapon came flying through the air, his hand closing on it as he somersaulted over the robot's blast, twisted in midair, bounced off a car hood and made his final leap towards the green-cloaked robot. Landing on its shoulders, he hooked his feet round its neck, reached around and thrust the barrel of the gun into the right eye slit and pulled the trigger.
"Got it in one. The Chitauri tech is also composed of previously unknown elements and compounds that simply should not exist. What's more, we analysed the contents of your 'bomb' from the pterathopter craft, and guess what?"
"As the Warriors Three and I have fought beside Thor, who could defeat all four of us at once, plus a small army. Perhaps Midgardians are not so different."
"If I know all this already, you'd better get to your point, because I'm bored with this conversation."
After a while, Steve said, "I wanted... the first time I did that, to be perfect for you, the way you made it perfect for me."
"I'm not," Steve protested, but he had flinched at the accusation and Tony knew it had hit home. It gave him hope.
"We haven't had time to exchange details," Tony said, making a cutting motion with one hand across his throat at Steve. "So, a portal and mercenaries?"
"So," Jan went on, still speaking in the same soothing voice was she helped Tony remove the breast and back plates. Tony concentrated on her words, trying not to remember those times when Steve had used his strength to free buckled plates that the bots could not. "I called up my private jet, chivvied Bruce and Hank – plus Hank's and my equipment – on board and told my pilot to follow Jarvis's instructions. Sit, Tony. Let's get those boots off."
What really hurt, though, was that, though plainly disapproving, Steve seemed amused. And, worse, what he disapproved of was Tony's treatment of the women and what he found funny was his floundering attempts to eject them.
Jan had drawn back into a pitcher's stance. Now she hurled something small directly at the Hulk. The beast put out a hand to fend it off, and it exploded in a pink-tinged cloud.
"Tony...?" It was a whisper, as Steve's head turned. "Tony!" Then he was on his feet, relief and ... joy? ... in his voice and his expression. He stumbled as he started forward, hands closing on the Iron Man's arms, making the metal creak.
"Yeah. Like that. I went from not particularly interested to... well, to being too damn interested. But Peggy was my only hope of being, y'know, considered normal. I did love her, Tony. More importantly, I wanted her. For all of that, I was willing to wait. I got very familiar with my right hand."
Fandral was nodding to himself. "You are wise to fear him," he said. "No, no, I fear him too, and I have been his comrade in arms. But Loki is imprisoned in a place tailored to his very nature, where any word spoken must be the absolute truth, a fitting prison for the Prince of Lies."
Tony's voice said, in his earbud: "According to the armour's infra-red scans there's no life in the cemetery larger than a chipmunk."
Happy snorted, but extracted the boots from their case and held them ready for Steve to finish becoming Captain America.
Then tiny wings glittered in his circle of light and, seconds later, Jan was kneeling on the palm of his hand, oblivious of the softly glowing repulsor.
– into rough cubes, and perched on their rim was what appeared to be a whitewashed Spanish mission, though this road plainly did not lead to it.
His instincts were shouting that this was a good thing, something he should reach out to, something that held a promise...
"Pepper's better off out of this, Steve. She never approved of the Iron Man, and she's going to be furious when she realises the Avengers are back in operation. Not to mention that Jan Van Dyne is now a superhero and that Natasha is installed in the tower."
"Such a mouth on Captain America," Tony complained. "Still, if there's a sewer there's way out – though we don't have a geologist's hammer or a poster of Rita Hayworth."
The last thing he wanted was Rhodey and Steve to be mad at each other. It was bad enough that Pepper was – or would be when she realised that Steve was the 'other woman'.
"I don't know what I believe. I don't have a strong enough hypothesis, and very few facts to verify it, or any other."
"Fuck indeed," the lady involved said, proving that he had underestimated her hearing. "Captain, this gun will not let me fire it."
Tony avoided the low, heavily padded ottomans and sat at a recognisable desk with a sloping, softly lit surface that was probably something high tech.
Steve shrugged, and wished he hadn't, though he managed to conceal the pain. "That fuel's limited, so I'm told, and all the really flammable stuff went up with the first explosion." He glanced at Tony in what he hoped the other man could interpret as a warning. "Now we have a moment, I'd be grateful if someone would tell us exactly what happened here."
Iron Man was flying a few feet above the jungle canopy with the south-western mountain range and the outlier mountain that was his destination rising into view when Jarvis said, "We have a passenger, sir."
Tony laughed. "What, teddy bears and elves and rainbows and things?" He became serious. "Steve, what would have happened if you hadn't been with Jarvis when those thugs arrived in the lobby?"
"So she definitely knew Hawkeye's real name. And Natasha's – Pepper originally knew her as Natalie Rushman... or did she? I'm beginning to wonder. Natasha might have told Pepper her real name, as might Coulson, but there would have to have been a good reason.  Coulson hardly told me anything, and SHIELD was trying to control both me and the armour from the beginning. But I can't see either of them having any reason to mention Hawkeye, let alone his real name. I was careful not to do so. Jarvis? I don't suppose by any chance you still have a recording of Steve's conversation with Pepper to confirm that exact wording?"
"Thor told me that he intends to come back, if Odin will permit it. I'll talk to Barton and the Widow – and we'll tackle Bruce together," Steve promised.
Jan was grinning. "You don't understand, sweetie. That's the real thing. Tony used some of his secret tech to shift it out of Manhattan and Hank shrank it down to about a foot and brought it here in a helicopter. We decided that this is the best size to work—"
He wasn't sure he was ever going to come to terms with any of this, but he said, "Yes, thank you, sir," automatically.
"I have a right to be angry. He... he deliberately committed suicide on the smallest of chances that I might live for a few more hours."
to help me with that, Tony. It was bad enough when you were wasting your time playing superhero as Iron Man, but then you had to involve Jim—"
The outer compound was deserted, save for a vehicle hovering a foot or two above the ground and a black clad man standing a few yards in front of it, a darker shadow in the fading light.
"You'd fit right in," Tony said aloud. He rose to his feet. "T'Challa – Black Panther – there's a place for you on the Avengers team, even if your duties to Wakanda do not allow you to fight with us as often as we might prefer."
was all he had time to think before the edges of the expanding cone of fire caught him and the light and sound greyed out his world.
But Gene wasn't here now. Tony had already used Extremis and the armour to send a message to Gene's email account when he had identified the Makluan ring. There had been no response and he had not really expected an immediate one. It had been more a heads up for the Mandarin to collect his property. Tony wanted nothing to do with that particular ring.
He should have realised that Jarvis would have blocked the signal used by the women's cell phones as soon as he saw them being used as cameras, but Steve might have told him that he'd quietly purloined said cells while the women were at breakfast and deleted all the incriminating photographs.
Next morning, over breakfast, Steve had just announced that Jarvis had broken the encryption and was busy sorting the clear language files into order of importance when Tony came in, his cell in his hand. He was frowning. "I've had an urgent message from Stark Special Projects in Seattle. I need to fly up there and sort them out. Sorry." Though the words were addressed to the room in general, his eyes were on Steve.
Excuses. The combined technology had as much potential to change the world, benefit mankind and make him an even greater fortune than the ARC reactors alone. He should have seen that long ago.
Steve did as he was told, clinging to the armour as it rose again from the surface. The amplified Iron Man voice boomed out across the bay. "Evacuate the area! Possible explosion! Evacuate the area!" even as he rocketed towards the shore, the limp pilot dangling from one hand and Captain America a limpet on his back.
"Just a minute," Hank interrupted. "Where's Jan? I know she was with you in Malibu. I've tried to call her half a dozen times, but she's not answering her cell. I can't contact Steve, either."
"Well, it does explain my few years of attempted playgirling, though I couldn't've done that without the heiress bit, which is down to my parents' business sense, except the part where they left all the money and stocks to me. Dad was responsible for my majoring in chemistry – he was a distinguished research chemist himself."
He shouldn't have done any of it, but, oh God, he had never been so elated. He was not going to feel sorry. He was never going to feel sorry.
Still hanging onto Steve to give himself some basis in reality, Tony hiccupped, then said, "Hmm. Research lab."
It was, however, as the truck bounced down the ramp behind the earth wall of the strangely intact barn on the deserted farm and into the tunnel beyond that Steve suddenly burst into delighted laughter.
Steve shifted Tony into a fireman's lift, rose to his feet and said, "Jarvis, can you show me the way to a spare bedroom. Preferably one with glass in the windows and no leaks." He doubted very much that Tony wanted to wake up in the bedroom he had shared with Pepper.
Gritting his teeth, he turned on his heel and headed back into the temple itself, stumbling, moving by will power alone. Beneath the statue of the Panther, his legs failed him, and he collapsed on the cool stone.
"And have you ever identified either the Black Widow or Hawkeye, under their real names, to Pepper, or anyone else?"
He shook his head slightly. He'd seen very little of Rhodey over the past couple of weeks, despite both of them being in New York. Okay, he had been busy with the political and economic fallout from both the Battle of Manhattan and with ensuring that his clean energy products not only worked but hit the market in the immediately foreseeable future, but his best friend might have made time to call.
Jan shook her head. "Tony called in a favour from me and bribed Hank with Chitauri tech and Bruce's help. We'd already moved to a secure Stark facility after Hank made his big breakthrough. We'd been approached by some dangerous people, and after my father was murdered in his lab I—" She stopped, and shook her head. "You are really too easy to talk to, you know."
Whatever Tony might have secretly hoped, it was plain that Thor didn't know the date and place of Coulson's funeral, or Odin had forbidden his participation in something that did not include a burning ship or Valkyries thundering over a battlefield. If he had been around he could have provided thunder and lightning or at least a gloomy overcast sky, but instead the sun was bright against Captain America blue with only a few high-flying cirrus and the odd contrail for contrast. It might have made the mass of almost identically black clad people listening with professionally blank expressions to the preacher standing above the lily-smothered coffin a tad less surreal.
"It's problematic whether it ever was really alive at all," Tony said, "but if it was, it, like the Chitauri themselves, died or deactivated when I blew their station or ship or whatever it was to its component atoms. Or when the Black Widow closed the portal. I wasn't timing it." Couldn't, actually, as he'd been unconscious at the time.
But they weren't out of danger yet. Quickly scanning the room, he saw that the monster – demon, Clea had called it – had partially pulled back into the circle of light from which it had emerged. It was batting Clea's magical bolts away as she continued to bombard it. Jean was floating towards them. And the monster's mutilated servant—
Meanwhile, her eyes narrowed in suspicion, probably at his expression and she turned her head to look for her reflection in what remained of the glass wall. One perfectly plucked eyebrow lifted. "Is this how you think of me, Stark?
"So I know the symptoms and I listened to Bruce and, well, you didn't have my resources – any resources. Even the prospect of revenge. I guessed Natasha would look after Clint, and I gave Bruce work and people to argue with, but you were off looking for America or something, all by yourself... and, damn it, I shouldn't have brought you here where Jarvis couldn't— I mean where y—"
"Thanks." Steve scooped up the red-fletched arrows with his left hand, without touching the bows, and hopped up onto the seat to stand upright, looking to the rear, balancing with ease on braced legs, despite the way the vehicle banked and bucked its way through the forest.
Steve and Storm were stowing the prisoner in the rear of the Gulfstream with Betty tut-tuting over his condition, when Jan arrived from the cockpit. "We've just heard from the base commander," she said to Storm. "Apparently the plane you were supposed to transfer to has just taken off without clearance. It's heading out over the Pacific. MacTavish has called in a squadron of fighters to pursue it. The one you arrived in is still there, but the crew has vanished. Want to bet they weren't on the other plane?"
Steve sidestepped him. "It's supposed to be from Peggy, from the fake address and it's typed – she – it – says her hands are arthritic. If it hadn't been for that address I might have fallen for that—"
Refusing to ask for an explanation, Steve glanced in the mirrors and, seeing the road was empty, braked, swung the SUV round in as tight a turning circle as its wheelbase could manage, then gunned the engine to race back the way they had come, no doubt breaking any problematic speed limits.
The Doombot ignored all three of them. "The thing of magic you are hiding. Where is it?" it demanded.
Yogthulu's head and first few segments had emerged; the room wasn't big enough to take the whole creature, though Tony was sure it would simply break through the roof if it felt like it.
"Unlikely. Hogan's value would be simply in controlling Stark. You have a value of your own— don't—" The gun was suddenly in his hand. "I know you are fast, Captain, but so am I – very fast."
Why the fuck had he been sulking in Avengers' Tower, mourning his relationship with Pepper, becoming more and more frustrated until he was getting hard at the sight of a tight ass or big tits?
Bored, excluded, and deprived of the resources of both internet and gym, he had made his way out into the noonday sunshine, hoping to be able to at least run himself to exhaustion – but that wasn't possible in the confines of the valley.
Being nasty about Howard didn't sting Tony any more. "Looking for a return? Probably. He spent a helluva lot of Stark Industries cash building those Arctic exploration vessels." The damn things had been mothballed after Howard's death, with an occasional lease for research—
"He would say that his people rescued you and were keeping you alive," Howard said at the same moment.
"Bit scorched," Steve said, blinking in the blinding light of the ARC reactor and the repulsors, trying to mask the fact that he was shaking with relief.
"Well fuck me." Tony stared down at the invitingly intact mechanism which showed no signs of blowing up. "Let's get you to Uncle Erik and find out what makes you tick. Then we may go visit your creators."
Steve rose to his feet, not the bait. "I don't get this, Tony," he said. "Despite what you say, there's nothing here to steal. And I didn't see any disturbed graves."
Even as the thought crossed his mind he saw the heavy gold collar around Clea's neck unclasp and descend slowly and silently to the floor.
He'd had plenty of offers and a few one-night stands, usually when he had been feeling particularly lonely. At first he had felt guilty, that he had perhaps betrayed Pepper, but as time passed that had faded, and he started to enjoy himself.
"Yes, sir." Even as Jarvis acknowledged Tony's order a bright speck of repulsor energy flew from the weapons battery in Iron Man's shoulder. It hit the rock and exploded.
"Then let's get on with this." He spoke to the Hatut Zeraze in Wakandan, and Tony found himself hustled outside into the frame of the stone panther's fangs, where Hunter, in the White Wolf suit but with the cowl pushed back, stepped forwards and spoke to the crowd.
"Which it has not done to anyone else?" Clea looked hard at Tony. "Do you also ask what your soul-mate asks? That an attempt is made to bring the soul and mind that first occupied that body back to it."
patent it." It was a woman's voice; an intelligent, determined voice that, despite the lack of an English accent, reminded him all too vividly of Peggy.
"Lockdown achieved, sir." There was distinct disapproval in Jarvis's voice. Tough. When he had originally made Pepper CEO, he had promised he would not monitor her in her office or anywhere else, but that was before she dumped him, resigned and came back. And now she was conspiring with Steve and he wasn't sure which hurt more.
Tony was already taking the stairs two at a time, because that was faster than the elevator. Yelling to the house computer he barrelled through the doors into his own apartment, and dived onto the repulsor platform that led to his armoury.
He relaxed his grip on Happy's shoulder, and patted it for a moment. "Clint, Natasha, you'd better get out of here. Don't scratch the paintwork on that bike. Jan and I will handle the cops. And SHIELD, if we have to. Well, move. You too, Happy. Pepper will be needing you back at the Tower."
"Why so hostile, Tony? We're going to crawl all over that downed helicarrier. But it'll be easier and safer for you to get what I want from the wreckage."
Iron Man made the short flight to his own landing pad, where the bots stripped away his armour, though he waited for Steve to join him there.
Only, looking at the wall opposite the now-vanished stairway, he was now able to trace thin lines that seemed to mark the outline of a doorway, though it had no sign of hinges, lock or handles.
"And dangerous? I am aware of that. But I am shocked, so shocked, that you thought I couldn't evade surveillance, I really am." The complex evasion strategy had been necessary against SHIELD's advanced surveillance techniques, but, apparently, they weren't the only people watching him.
"Nah. Just in time," Tony answered, as the armour closed around him. "Robbie, make one circuit, so we can drop, then go high and wait for my call."
"You were lucky. There may be no other way to shut it down without a controller," Okoye said, "and even if you'd found one it would not have worked for you. Captain Rogers thought it was keyed to the holder's fingerprints or DNA. Their guns are the same. And they don't work for the dead."
Nat returned his nod, rose gracefully to her feet in one smooth motion – how did she do that? – and crossed to the seated woman. "Can I help?" she asked, offering her hand.
Ignoring him, Steve opened the locker. The internal light revealed two double-recurve bows and clusters of arrows, sorted into purpose made-containers by colour of their fletching. "Do these arrows explode on contact too?" he asked.
Raising the faceplate had been a mistake, Tony realised, as he struggled to keep his expression neutral. There had been a lot of speculation about Captain America but very little of it suggesting that he was the original, Steve Rogers, frozen in the ice for seventy years, unaging, undreaming, unchanged.
"Yes, sir, really." It was said with an air of long sufferance. "To go back to the Avengers. Is it true that Thor claims to be the actual Norse God of Thund—?"
"Whaddaya take me for?" For a moment Rhodey sounded angry but then his voice softened. "I just wanted to know you were okay."
But Iron Man's repulsors flared, throwing him backwards and blasting the egg – crystal, stone, whatever – into the sea, even as he heard the distinctive whine of the firing gun.
"That's even weirder. Ross has been given first refusal on the Hulk, as if they've somehow managed to tame the Other Guy but are willing to hand him over for... well, they aren't very clear on that, but favours are definitely involved. And what sound like threats."
"No," Steve said quietly. "Not unless you come with me. You're just as exhausted as I am, and if I'm right about what's in that flying dustbin, I'm not leaving you alone with it." Behind that golden mask, Tony must be hurting and desperately worried, for all his own attempts at reassurance.
Steve squirmed a little with the realisation that he hated any criticism of Tony, however justified and however gentle, even from someone who obviously loved him. He concentrated on his tea, which was nothing like he expected tea to taste.
He was instantly reminded, from that and the planes of her features, the darkness of her skin and her tightly-bound hair, of Okoye.
The first thing Tony was aware of was pain. His head was pounding, in what, if it was a hangover, was the worst he had experienced in years. Whatever he had been drinking, it was powerful enough to make him think of giving up booze for good...
"Major Grimm was a qualified test pilot and astronaut," Jan said helpfully. “Susan Storm's boyfriend was Doctor Reed Richards."
As the truck jerked forward, Tony removed the Iron Man helmet and gauntlets and said, "You have the papers?"
Steve's feet pounded in hard sand. Tony had said goodbye three hours ago. He would have been in conference for nearly all of that. He had decided on a morning run northward along the beach, on the principle that he wouldn't miss Tony so much if he was running, and it would allow the housekeeping contractors free access to the Malibu mansion under Jarvis's supervision.
"You can have a proper meal later. But meanwhile," Tony said, wrinkling his nose and steadfastly ignoring the effect that look was having on his stomach – not to mention his groin, "I think you'd better take a shower. That is, if you can get up and hobble into the bathroom without falling over, Old Man." He rose to his feet and held out his hand. "Or shall I call the suit and carry you?"
"They can try," Tony said, and Clint's image was stilled and silenced. "But with any luck they'll be too late."
"I'll get Roberta on that, and then I'll talk to him," Howard said calmly. "He's not going to succeed in bullying either of us, Tony. He needs us too much."
Steve, who now knew what a Jedi was, was fascinated by the philosophy behind what their instructor called
"My personal shopper in LA. I rang her this morning, gave her your size details and asked her to pick up some clothes for you. Or would you rather go out in full Asgardian?"
"Steve has suffered contusions and a strained shoulder, all of which are healing at his accelerated rate."
The reaction of the warriors suddenly seemed over the top. Unless, of course, they knew something Tony did not, such as the vehicle being heavily armed, which was entirely possible, even probable.
There were any number of things about Tony's diatribe that needed explaining but, oddly, the one thing at the top of Steve's list was, "Rescue? Pepper?"
"Do you think you can walk a mile and three eighths or so?" It was at moments like this that Steve was reminded that the Asgardians were speaking a different language. The Allspeak was sometimes too literal and sometimes too vague.
Suddenly ravenously hungry, he inspected the interior of the refrigerator. Most of the fresh food was soft, slimy, dried up or growing mould, so he drained a bottle of mineral water and went searching for Power bars and chocolate.
Despite this distraction, pressed into Tony's lap, Steve could not help but realise that Tony was not even half-hard. He shifted, trying disguise his own erection, but while the other man's right hand was still hooked behind his head, his left hand slid down Steve's body to his fly, unzipped it and reached inside...
The most worrying thing he had said, though, had been, "You can't let anyone else know about this – it would be another reason for them to try and re-create the super-soldier serum, or experiment on you to isolate that part of it. You've heard what happened to Bruce, which wasn't the worst of it." He'd elaborated to an extent that left Steve shocked and faintly nauseous.
Tony was well aware of that, but Jan had been taking too many chances recently – and she was completely untrained.
"I wouldn't bet on that. From what Dad had to say about Carter, she knew how to get what she wanted..."
One of the Iron Man gauntlets lying on the floor suddenly hummed to life. The fingers clenched, moving the palm so it was pointing at Doom. Instantly, the repulsor flashed.
But his guts churned at the thought of meeting Miss Potts. Which was odd because he had not had the not-knowing-what-to-say-to-dames problem with Natasha or Deputy Director Hill, but then they were professional ... somethings.
Tony was unshaken: he had known all along that the Attorney General had to be involved in the legal actions against him, though it did explain his lack of significant progress with the movers and shakers in the White House, which he had put down to the impending elections. "Guess I'll have to up the political slush fund."
Danvers' expression hadn't changed. She just stared him down until he paused to draw breath, then interrupted with, "I need to know where he is, Stark, because the Air Force isn't telling."
"I don't know," he admitted. "Don't see how this can be related to his sister's missing DNA. But the timing is suspicious. If Thor and Tony hadn't turned that hurricane, the East Coast would be in chaos right now. Don't suppose anyone would bother 'bout Storm for a while."
Not, Steve supposed, that that uncharacteristic compliance was going to last, but he'd take advantage of it while he had the chance.
"I met Hank," Jan admitted. "Financing his work wasn't enough to make him see me as a partner. So I went back to college."
But Jarvis had a radar fix on the truck, and an intense thermal image in front of and just below it that was probably Thor. The AI was also targeting an even brighter energy reading that was almost certainly the transportation portal, just two hundred yards from the truck, and almost fifty warm bodies in the forest in the trees encircling the truck. They were, however, holding back, probably because of the lightning that danced about the truck. Resisting temptation, Tony also held back from wholesale slaughter. It would take too much explaining to the local cops.
Okoye rose to face her and they began what looked like an angry conversation. Tony activated the boot thrusters as Jan shrank to insect-size, hovering on the dragonfly wings that had sprouted from her shoulders in the process.
Before, he had been dreaming, content, if not thinking was contentment – but now he knew he was not alone. Recognition followed.
"You must understand," Cheyo said, "that we are not here on our own initiative and," – his face clouded suddenly – "we are not used to being treated as messenger boys. It is not... dignified."
Pepper's voice was rising. "I know better than to steal any of your beloved technology." She visibly calmed herself and added, in a quieter voice, "Besides, it belongs to Stark Industries and we only hand over things for cash."
Carefully, he pushed himself into a sitting position, then swung his feet out of bed and stood up, surprised by a lack of dizziness. Looking about him, he noticed for the first time that the room was large and tastefully decorated but, apart from the art on the walls – which he was scared to examine too closely because he recognised some of the artists and the works looked to be originals – it didn't have a lot of personality. Maybe it was a high class hotel room. What he needed right now was the bathroom, so he hoped that that was somewhere close.
N'kendi bowed low and spoke quickly in that language that was becoming familiar if not any more understandable.
It was obviously a sincere question and deserved a truthful answer. "The super-soldier serum in your blood."
"Jarvis," Tony said, "try to locate Margaret Carter, who was with the SSR during and after World War 2. Births, marriages, deaths, press references—"
Instantly, Iron Man whirled about, putting the armour between the explosion and Steve, as the shock wave tumbled them across the sky.
"You sure know how to get my staff riled up, Tony. And you know my rules about identifying a customer – even an ex-customer, because I understand Miranda has made it clear they ain't welcome in future – or she would have done if she'd been able to contact them."
Much as Tony hadn't wanted to admit it, Steve was smart and making determined efforts to come to terms with the technology of the twenty-first century. That should have been no surprise, because he'd faced the alien tech employed by Hydra, and had had to put up with Howard Stark's eccentric genius. His initial prejudices tossed aside, Tony took charge of Steve's education, with Jarvis as assistant, abandoning SHIELD's step-by-step chronological approach and challenging Steve with his own cutting edge tech and the science that underpinned it. Jarvis proved surprisingly good at translating some of this into reasonably plain English.
Equally suddenly, the shadowy shape of buildings in the murk flickered with light. From below, something exploded, sending earth and concrete and steel seething upwards, and the Tendring Tower slid down to meet it, as Thor seized Tony's wrist and propelled them up and up, out flying the fountain of debris.
"Thor," Tony said, with a slight nod. "Steve. Welcome to sunny California. I see you brought your own weather with you."
"That is the age we inherited from the original universe," Clea said. "But I was taught that the birth of the multiverse is much more recent. As each universe splits from another, both carry that common history with them."
"No," Tony replied, watching in fascination as one of the most powerful people in the world opened the door at speed, peered out and looked to left and right, then relaxed and closed the door, turning to face Tony. "Is there any reason I should be?" he asked. "Or do you expect treachery from everyone nowadays?"
There was a trace of delight in Tony's voice now. "Oh, deflection. Using my own tricks against me. Oooo-kay, how did you come to be in my workshop in the first place?"
"Let her into the armoury." Tony was thinking quickly. "I'll send Steve around the back yard. Can you meet him, Dad, but first switch off the driveway monitors and the alarms in the backyard walls until he gets over them."
Tony turned and lifted his head. Behind his faceplate he was grinning widely at the worried face beside his. "Thor! I was just thinking of you, buddy. Is Heimdall telepathic?"
Steve sighed, dropped the sketch book he had been using on his knees and rested his chin on his hands; Manhattan was laid out below him, towers and surviving brownstones marching in straight lines, yellow cabs crowding the streets below Stark Tower, sunlight glinting off glass and water. From his perch the damage the Chitauri had done seemed almost negligible.
He thought he'd been in love before – with Whitney, with Pepper – but there had been nothing like this desperate need to touch. Which he wasn't allowed to do.
"Not badly. That's just the bruising coming out. Your back, though, must be much worse... I noticed last night that you weren't letting it touch anything, even a chair back or the mattress."
"That T'Challa guy is frightening," Hank was continuing. "The second he came out of it he was on his feet demanding to be briefed on what was happening. The Wakandans sent for that Okoye woman, and the rest of us were kicked out."
When Tony woke, he found himself held tightly in Steve's grip, one arm flung over his chest, a leg pinning his thighs to the mattress.
"Yeah, and he's really, really, really interested in meeting Cap. Well, his best chance of that is cashing in his own chips, which considering his apparent age might be sooner than he expects— What the hell was that?"
"Your self-image is much the same as your present appearance," Xavier went on. "Though you look older here."
Steve mumbled something in which the words, "Peggy", "date" and "home," were the only ones intelligible.
Tony was glad he wasn't and hated himself for being glad. There were things he ought to say to Steve, that he wanted to say but somehow couldn't get past the voice of caution in his own head, telling him it was too soon, that it might not be real, that Steve was going to see through Tony's own masks and realise his mistake.
But Tony wasn't actually listening to the Lieutenant any more. Instead, he was looking about him in dismay. "Hey, where's Helen of Troy? I know she was with you at LAX..."
The west coast was still in darkness as Iron Man, the suit blazing with repulsor light, led the jet in to land at the Stark-Seattle airfield. Below them, floodlit roads and runways ran for what seemed like miles between factories, hangars and office buildings, all lit up like a mini-Manhattan.
Steve flung himself at the hatch to the access stairs which, as he had anticipated – and as Tony had also no doubt anticipated – was locked. What's more, it was a metal hatch and an extremely stout lock, no doubt installed to keep burglars away from whatever fancy stuff the guests had brought with them.
And, in the blink of an eye, they were back in Xavier's study. Tony had a hand on his shoulder, rock solid and steady, his eyes narrowed on Xavier. "What happened?" he asked, then, to Steve, "Did you remember?"
"Someone was trying to get rid of all that remained of the Chitauri in New York without caring who they killed doing it," Steve said.
Tony's mind made one of those sudden leaps for which he was, in some circles, infamous. "Jarvis," he said, for the AI's metaphorical ears alone, "have any of the Arctic Exploration vessels, iced superheroes for the finding of, been leased out at any time during the past three years? If so, to whom?"
"I didn't dare," Steve told him. "Didn't dare risk your friendship. Because there was always Pepper. I have to know – is it still Pepper? Will you take her back?"
Another African-American, this time a man wearing one of those dislikeable SHIELD uniforms, was pacing the office, glaring at Howard every time he turned. This was, presumably, Fury.
Jan was nodding. "Doctor Reed Richards. I knew his fiancée, Susan Storm. She was on that rocket too. Her brother Johnny went into the Air Force and is now in astronaut training with NASA."
Keeping low behind the car, Tony secured the chest and back plates, slid his hands into the gauntlets, and stepped into the boots. Next was the helmet...
With Thor's arrival, the situation in the Tower changed rapidly. He felt none of Steve or Bruce's qualms about accepting Tony's hospitality – indeed, taking it for granted – so he not only moved in but brought his astrophysicist lover, Dr Jane Foster, with him, and Jane came as a unit with Dr Erik Selvig and their ridiculous intern, Darcy Lewis. So that meant that Tony had to find lab space for Jane and Erik. Encouraged by the way the women lightened the mood in the Tower, Bruce gathered his courage and asked his equally brilliant lover, Dr Betty Ross, to stay for the weekend – a weekend that became a week, then two, at which point Betty resigned from Culver and accepted Tony's offer of funding for her research. More lab space to find, but it also meant that Tony was suddenly surrounded by brilliant scientists who spoke his language and shared his dedication.
But then his father said he was far too cynical for someone not even old enough to buy a drink. Not that that would stop him pouring himself a whisky when he returned home.
Tony wandered round the workshop picking up pieces of equipment and putting them down again, flicking aside holographic displays, replacing them and switching them off in disgust.
"I'm sure you're going to conspire against me, but I'm putting off letting you compare notes as long as possible, so—"
No, this was the Natasha he had first met, red curls falling about her shoulders, her face younger and deceptively serene.
Tony heard Steve's sharp intake of breath, and felt his hand settle lightly on his shoulder. "Tony's the only reason you have either 'leviathans' or the bombs, sir," Steve pointed out. "He's certainly less likely to supply weapons of any kind to the Air Force than... anyone else... with access to them."
"No you're not, and I'm not," Steve said to the woman-who-wasn't-Peggy. Tony had never expected him to speak so coldly to someone he had never met before, but that voice held all the ice of his seventy years of frozen imprisonment. "Did you always look like that?"
There was only one guard on duty as SUV-a-like swished through grass that brushed the hood and pattered against the windows, though what he was guarding was problematic as they were driving straight towards a wall of golden coloured stone, ordinary save that it emitted a faint mauve light.
"He also collapsed in your workshop." Howard was suddenly looking grimmer than Tony had seen him since the Makluan invasion. "But if they were draining his blood and extracting the serum so that it was at low levels—"
"Yes, sir. Also Director Fury, Deputy Director Hill, the entire Press Corps, Colonel Velasco, Ms Bartowski—"
It was not enough. Even as he turned towards the portal to follow, it exploded. The shock wave smashed into Iron Man and hurled him straight into one of the portico pillars.
"Nah. Never travel without the suitcase armour nowadays," Tony said, as he opened the case and began to don the lightweight suit, feeling the weight of Steve's eyes on him.
"Well, whaddya know," Tony's voice, even distorted by the Iron Man synthesizer, sounded both delighted and shocked. "It's a steampunk pterosaur. Oh my God, it's even flapping its wings. It's an ornithopter! Pterathopter? That is such a lousy design. But I want one to play with."
There was a holster on the belt containing a pistol of a type he had never seen before, but there was nothing that suggested it would be any different in use from those he had...
"It is where you are, sir. And you are currently alone here. Ms Potts is in Japan, negotiating with Toyota. They wish to power their next generation of cars with modified ARC reactors."
"That's horrible! I can't believe— or perhaps I can. I know you won't ask because you know the rules, but I'll talk to the boss when he gets back."
So, maybe he could still use their own powers to send them their appointed places. In a moment it was done: Mind and Time pushed by Space to places he had seen, knew.
And she was, standing with Fury on one side and Diane, the ex-girlfriend cellist, on the other, hands folded discreetly, apparently listening to every word that fell from the priest's lips. There were a lot of them.
"Sir," Jarvis interrupted, "radar reveals a contact heading straight for the tower, level with the helipad."
"You met Peggy?" Steve was vaguely aware that his childlike wonder at this must be obvious to Tony, but he didn't really care.
"However," Jarvis continued, "I have located what appears to be a DNA match to the samples taken from the remains of the pilot of the War Machine."
If he ever saw Tony again, because his chest was tightening, and he couldn't seem to find his way out... The water was thick with mud and debris and he only had one hand free and his lungs were crying out for air...
"So, have you got a final updated will for me to sign?" Tony asked, after the usual friendly greetings and enquiries about her sons and daughter had elicited a positive response. "Incorporating the amendments I sent you yesterday?"
"Then let's go." He hoped they could get this over with as quickly as possible because though he trusted his Dad, he didn't want to leave Steve in anyone else's hands.
were working with SHIELD. Neither of us would have been alive if it hadn't been for SHIELD. Phil recruited me to help keep you safe. He and Fury had – have – your best interests at heart, Tony. You can't go on like this. This continual risking of your life and other peoples'."
"Things got a little hectic around here. To be honest, I'm surprised there was anyone here to save when you arrived."
He'd had his own problems at the time and his solution to them was probably the reason Fury had never followed up on his suggestion that Tony help them unfreeze him. Fury didn't appreciate being outsmarted by a cocky seventeen-year old smartass.
I would really love to be spending our sixth anniversary by your side, probably pretending we're a refined couple and eating in a fancy restaurant to later return home, put on our holed onesies and watch a low-budget reality show while eating popcorn with melted chocolate - because the food in the expensive restaurant wouldn't get close to fulfilling the black holes we call stomachs. But, unfortunately, you a have a dream to realize and, as much as it breaks my heart not to have you around on this so special day, I will always support you.
"Of course, I'm a gay villain who wants to corrupt the world", the brunette closed his body to the actor’s, noticing how he was extremely fragrant, exactly as Stark imagined. He took a deep breath, trying not to be tempted by the sweet scent and the see-through blouse that seemed to attack him, and whispered: "When you leave here with a woman, remember my video."
Despite the traumas and the holes in my self esteem, I still believed the prince charming would come - he would maybe take a while because he was stuck in the traffic of the 5th Avenue, or maybe he was wasting his time with the wrong duke (not prince). I thought maybe the prince could be my first boyfriend, with his beautiful light eyes and the maximum cheap talk a 16 year old boy can have, with pearls like "hey, babe, can I put my hand inside your pants today?"
to pay with it?” he asked, making Steve nearly scream in anger. At least, he knew he wasn't crazy or hearing voices.
In pre-school, boys called me a rabbit, because my front teeth were the size of ultra tampons and my mom used to be quite generous when it came to feeding me. In middle school, however, I went through my growth spurt and lost the spare weight, but, on the other hand, my nickname affectionately became faggot, because, well, I was the most likely among them to be gay, which was entirely true - at least the growth rhythm of my teeth slowed down and soon they were all the same size and proportional to my face. In high school, I used to spend most of my free time hidden in the library, reading romances and classics, since life didn't turned out to be the Adam Sandler cheap comedy movie I thought it would.
Tony was sitting on his couch, finishing his latest assignment for one of his classes. He loved solving equations, especially the tricky ones, but he was just so tired from work, school and his channel that being a math genius that morning felt more like a burden than a gift. Suddenly, his phone rang. It was Pepper.
I imagine that the Astrology scholars are probably cursing me and yelling that "the sun sign itself means almost nothing", and I know that! I know that the others aspects of the birth chart are just as important, but I'm going to limit myself to the sun. Firstly, because this is going to be a simple research. Secondly, because I'm still learning about the subject and I don't want to come off like I'm a Steven Forrest or something, and thirdly because it's easier to find an Aries than a guy with sun, moon, and ascendant in Aries (for that, I'd have t go to the pits of hell)!
My favorite childhood movie was Cinderella. I used to watch at least once a day, until I drove my mom mad with the hallucinated and out of tone singing of an 8-year-old - that's probably why suddenly the tape decided "not to roll anymore".
That time, I believed that, when I grew up enough to be immune to the germs of those yucky boys I was surrounded with, a beautiful prince would fit a crystal shoe in my foot and we'd live happily ever after in an enchanted castle.
He spent a good full hour choosing, before picking three to take – Morgan's 12 Star Signs, Ecstatic! and (Un)forgettable –. When he arrived at the cashier he could not believe his eyes, because there he was, the
“Um…Hi?” he tried to get the attention of the boy who seemed to be focused on something on his cellphone, not sure how to act. That really
In the moment Steve was getting his card to give it to the brunette who's life mission seemed to be pissing him off, a shriek was heard from behind him, drawing the attention of both men. He turned around slowly, and behind him was standing a little blue-haired girl with a big smile and wide eyes shifting between the two of them.
The party went by in a blur (he kissed, drank and actually had a great time talking to two Natasha and Bucky, who were not nearly as constipated as the ginger’s client, in Tony’s mere opinion, which allowed for a great conversation), and Tony found himself thinking maybe he should go dancing, or looking for Pepper in the middle of the crowd, but just the thought of having to see the girl kissing some model makes him bored. He decided to get up from where he was and choose what to do as he went, not at all expecting to run into someone.
Tony stopped right beside Steve, arms touching, and he promptly decided to ignore the energy that waved through his body that moment. “Thank you so much!”
However, reality was a bit harsher with me. What actually happened was: my cousin and best friend Peter, alongside his boyfriend Wade, organized a surprise party for my birthday in a Japanese restaurant to which we used to go all time. Stephen went by my house to pick me up, and even if he was trying hard, I felt him really distant. We still went, and, on the middle of the dinner, Peter announced there was a little surprise for me, made by all my friends. A small retrospective of my 22 years of life started to pass on the restaurant's big screen. Everything was going just fine, thank you, until the pictures of my childhood as a toothy and happy kid were replaced by images of Stephen and Loki, a friend from college; they weren't very pleasant, a few very compromising, all incredibly incriminating.
MOMENT NUMBER TWO: when you asked me to be your boyfriend while you held my head from the toilet because I had drank too much, and, on the breaks of vomiting my guts out, I asked if you were never going to; you laughed, told me you loved me and explained you thought we were already dating, that it wasn't actually necessary to ask. You also asked if you should ask for my father's blessing, and we both laughed so hard. When I start to drink too fast, I remember that day and stop, because no drinking will ever be as special as that one.
“TONY!!” she screamed in excitement, to the point he had to remove his phone from his ear from how loud it was, “I have an invitation for you”.
The intention of this final assignment, by which I'll be evaluated and graded, is to demonstrate by writing, in an online page, the result of an investigation of a theme -
People, I never dated Loki. What kind of question is that?" He looks away from the screen for a second, saying "We never had sex Pepper; quit that look, what the fuck? Are you guys high? I'm a respectful, family young man.”
the one thinking too much of yourself”, the blonde said, putting his glass on the counter. Tony started staring very non-discreetly at those abs, not being able to believe they were real and not an exaggeration of the cameras. “Come on, man”.
The night was hot and moist as if the doors of Hell had been opened and Lucy ready to receive his guests. I was thrown in the living room's couch, watching a reprise of MasterChef and thinking about my chances on doing a dish like that using only pre-cooked pasta, Soy sauce and old cheese, the only available ingredients in the pantry.
Steve for his bad luck and for choosing a small library with only one cashier. He took a deep breath before approaching.
I am sending this letter so that it strategically arrives one day before our anniversary there in Los Angeles, because I want you to make this show thinking about me; if I'm the only the person in your head while you transform music into art, I don't mind us been separated for a little while.
I hope you're having a wonderful night, doing what you were born to do, and that you return soon to New York (or I'll go to Madrid, hihi). I'll see you next Saturday and promise to even wear a tie for our yearly romantic date, because I know it annoys you how I only wear the same clothes.
“Hey there! I know I went MIA for a while, and I'm sorry for having left you guys without new videos for so long, must have been suffocating. College is crazy, someone needs to remind me why was I stupid enough to choose Mechanical Engineering, I thought I'd get to build stuff during all my classes”, he sighed, waving a hand through his face as if he was really tired, which he appeared to be. “Anyways, I'm not here to ramble about how I'm dying, but to talk about him, the one you all adore, mister Steve Rogers! I've got to congratulate him on winning the BAFTA Award for best actor.”
I would like to start stating that my name is not Morgan, that is just the pseudonym I chose so I could write to you guys - the reason of the choice is a bit personal, and I'd rather to not say it.
“Even I would stalk him. And I'm a lesbian.” the girl declared, receiving a slap from the boy next to her.
“But I don't have any issues with you”, he shrugged, giving that sarcastic toothless smile and directing the card machine in Steve's direction, as if telling him to get on with it “Don't flatter yourself, movie star. Card or money?”
“Third, button up those shirts you steal from your grandma, they are ugly as hell, and coming from someone who doesn't have any knowledge on fashion, even my mom dresses better. It's like you are from the 40s and just woke up in the 21st century and has no clue how to dress."
"I know you did it on purpose", the smile on Steve's face and his tone of voice were incandescent – proof that the alcohol was also taking its toll on the actor, seeing how he hadn’t got mad at Tony for touching him.
. The boy smiled, showing his white teeth and Steve wasn’t impressed when he started talking and his voice sounded smooth, apparently accustomed with all that.
After the rage, came the tears. At least, I was already far enough to not give Stephen and Loki that taste. In a cab on the way back home, I soaked Peter's shirt while Wade tried to calm me down with pats in the back, like I was a Golden Retriever taking its first vaccine - I didn't judge him, after all, that was a really generous gesture given his emotional capability.
bad”, he said laughing, and Steve was dying to know what was so funny. “I just gave my opinions on a few things, but if you want me to do another, just let me know”.
"That I don’t know how to dress?”, he said, playing the obtuse card, and the smile on Steve’s face was more than perfect.
I'm not going to say I reacted with the maturity and graciousness of a young adult. And I'm not going to lie: the sushis that flew everywhere were all previously in my plate. But I lost my mind... in one minute, I felt hope, I thought I could turn this thing around and make my  enchanted prince in a leather jacket remember the reasons why he had fallen in love with me, and on the next, I was throwing Shoyu to the air like Oprah throws wisdom gems.
“This one is from Scott, he wants to know if I have a crush in a certain blue-eyed actor... blue-eyed actor? Who's he talking about?” Steve held his breath, knowing exactly whom that boy was talking about. He knew it was just a matter of time until he popped up in that livestream.
, run as if your life depends on it, no looking back. I don't want anyone crying in my timeline later ‘cause I'm no therapist.” A pillow went flying directly into Tony's face, and Steve made a mental note to thank that person later. “Guess I forgot to mention, Pepper is here right now playing video games, so in a bit after she loses for the millionth time she might be joining us.”
"That you like dicks and loved our approximation. And that I would love to do a lot more with you.", Tony bit his earlobe, enjoying the fact that the actor looked paralyzed, and walked away laughing. Steve Rogers,
“Oh, sorry, love”, and Tony heard Steve’s sigh of frustration towards the nickname. “You really didn’t catch the fashion tip from my video, did you? Although this one I don’t mind that much.”
“Hm. Does Rhodey know he wasn’t invited?”, Tony asked with malice in his voice. He loved being the preferred friend.
Steve took a long deep breath, closing his eyes, trying not to lose completely his reason. He just really liked the black and white.
The problem was - as it was obvious it was going to happen, because teenagers own the emotional depth of a cotton swab - that three other boys also believed he was their prince charming, and received the same loving promises and the same uncoordinated make out session behind the school gym. When I finally heard about the cheating, my heart shattered with the strength only the first love and first disillusion can have. My mom tried to console me with romantic comedy movies, books and chocolate, but all I wanted was to act like a wacko with no proud or self-love, and call him to convince him I was the best out of the four suitors. In the end, neither me or the other boys had to go through the humiliation, since the boy ended up picking, among all princes, an older socialite princess.
“Ok, I was nice, now let's put some things out in the open that I know lots of people will hate me for. Yes, I think Steve is a good actor and deserves the awards he's been getting, but can someone let him know to
“I'm a huge fan of both of you”, her voice was slight and shy, and Steve directed a smile in her direction, like he was used to, but Tony simply gave a fake smile for a few seconds after returning to his bored expression “Hum… Can I take two pictures? One between you and the other just you two?”
“I like both of you and I want to imagine you get along well, even after that video, which was pretty funny, by the way”, she said even more embarrassed, clutching to the phone on her hand. Steve could not form words in his mouth, but he didn't have to, because he suddenly heard Tony's smooth voice.
MOMENT NUMBER THREE: when I got into NYU and you bought me that ridiculous "first day of class kit" with only Hello Kitty products, that I use up until today and makes all my friends feel embarrassed.
“Oh, but in those you indeed are. Very much.”, Stark laughed, making Steve even more annoyed. “Now, if you don’t mind, go back to your friends, because I’m trying to get the bartender's number over here”.
I had all my firsts with Stephen. First relationship, first time, first fight, first DTR, first hungover. And, on my 22nd birthday, first cheating. And public.
I, just like many of you (I hope so), started to search about astrology quite recently, and realized there are many theories out there, but almost zero practical experiences on the subject - is there a better way to learn something than to live it and feel it in your own skin?
Everyday I thank your high school friend for having left you alone in that Temaki barbecue we met; maybe, if you had company, you would have never noticed me, and we would have never initiated this beautiful, and sometimes weird, love story.
“Do you think I wanna go now? I’m touched by your love and consideration, Pepper, really. Good luck finding someone as cool and stylish as me to go with you. Bye.”
MOMENT NUMBER 6: when you accidentally burned my right hand's ring finger with the ashes of the cigar, and in the following moment, burned your own finger, claiming we wouldn't need commitment rings anymore because we had a burn pact.
.” by her tone, it was clear she knew he was planning something, “Thank you, it’s going to be awesome! I’ll text you the details later.”
He then remembered the huge amount of notifications he'd gotten that morning and entered in Twitter. The top one topic trend was #Stevelovesdicks, with over 100.000 tweets.
“Oh, and by the way, this week's video will feature Pepper, do you remember her? The crazy blonde. She will probably talk about her love life –
“That's all?” he pointed to the books as if Steve's presence didn't matter that much – which could be entirely true. He just nodded, knowing that trying to understand the other was probably impossible. Steve took a deep breath, knowing he would not be able to let things stay the way they were.
he was in his house, with his good-smelling new books, without Tony and the fan that made him take a picture with him.
I was wearing my special pj's for lazy days and it was past shower time. It was a Sunday and I had college the next day, and just to think that my entire body crawled in sadness.
Yes, yes, another one! But I'm pretty sure mine possesses a significant difference, that will interest both men and women (or any other gender you identify yourself as).
Steve was so angry he could almost feel his face becoming red. He entered in Twitter, already hearing the complaints he would listen from Natasha later, and tweeted
?” Steve opened his mouth in confusion, not sure whether he heard that correctly. Tony stared back like the other man was getting crazy.
I'm going to try and update it three times a week, but iIm a really volatile person, so don't quote me on that. Also, i'd like to apologize in advance for any grammar mistakes, that's really not my forte :(
“Let's do it, why not?” he muttered, and the brunette soon left from behind the balcony with a smile on his face, that was somehow managing to annoy Steve even more.
The thing is, no Disney movie ever prepares you for the pain of betrayal, or the finding that the 6 years that went by meant absolutely nothing to the person whom you shared every joy and sadness. All the good moments, all the kisses, hugs, laughs, dinners, plans, movies, travels... all thrown in the trash can.
make jokes during his interviews? Buddy, you're terrible at it, people don't truly laugh and as an actor, you should recognize a performance. They laugh because you're famous, rich, and cute, but not close to funny. So just stop, ok? STOP.” Steve raised his eyebrows, feeling an anger rising in his veins.
Two years and a few "half-princes" later, I met Stephen. I had just turned 16 when he showed up in my life like a rainy day in the middle of the hot summer - unexpected, but very much welcomed. We met in a birthday barbecue, and the connection was immediate. Despite the four years difference, he seemed enchanted with our common tastes  and my facility to talk about musics, films, and video games (even though I was only doing it to impress him). We stayed for hours and hours talking, and on that same night, he gave me a ride home and kissed me in the building lobby, in a scene worthy of a low-budget romantic movie. A few months later, we were officially dating - of course it only become official after we put "dating" on Orkut and I could, at last, accept all those statements stuck in my home page.
OOOOH, and fun fact because I love those: Pepper's and Loki's major is Fashion - that's why they had tickets and etc; that's also how Loki ended up joining the squad, because Pepper, Rhodey and Tony are all childhood buddies and such, and after Pepper met Loki in one of her classes, they ended up adopting the little gay devil.
“Figured you'd say that”, he smiled again, putting the books inside a bag, “Credit, debit, money, your body?”
“Secondly, what the hell is going on inside his head? I doubt that there is someone capable of explaining to me, at least, three pictures of his Instagram or those philosophical-like tweets – which I'm sure he finds at those Quotes websites. They don't make sense, and plus, only speaks in codes those who have something to hide. Oh, and before I forget,
. She makes it seem like all women are crazy, but just between us, she's the crazy one. I feel truly sorry for the women who fall for her talk. Women, if you ever find her,
It seemed like it would never end. Each picture of them together in social media crushed me, the videos of Stephen's shows were bookmarked in my computer, his smile stamped in the back of my memory, and I would sleep and wake listening to an audio he had sent me before it all came to ruins, saying "don't forget I love you, Tony".
“Are you really going to pretend you didn't rip on me?” Steve blurted out before giving too much thought into it, and the answer came in the form of an expression: a raised eyebrow that showed Tony had no intention in acknowledging that he knew Steve or that he made a mess in his Twitter the previous days.
Tony Stark, the youtuber who said bad things about him and about a butt load of other famous people too. Tony put his phone down and gave Steve a sarcastic smile, and the actor had to secretly admit that he was much prettier in person – his eyes were much brighter and his lips had a nice shade of pink. The brunette didn´t say anything, just registered the three books.
"Thor says that magic is simply science we don't understand yet," Tony said from the door. "And I will drink to that." He made for the cooler, Betty following at his heels.
"No! This is all a lie." Steve flung the letter on the workbench. "Read it if you want, Tony. Then get rid of it. Please." He turned on his heel and stalked out of the room.
"We have a few of our own. But Fury isn't the only one who can set traps. Let me go first. I have the protection of this metal suit."
Steve's expression sympathetic, but Tony just knew it masked scepticism. "Don't worry," he said. "I won't press. But if you need a sympathetic ear... well, if you don't trust me – or you think I'm too young and inexperienced – there's always Bruce.
"And I'm sure you would have. Or a close approximation." This was good. This was a great distraction. "Jarvis, check out that number for me."
And why was Rhodey so damn annoyed that he hadn't been in the Tower? And why, indeed, had he been so sure that Tony would be there? There was only one answer. "Why have you been spying on me?" he demanded.
"It is not an invitation that has ever been extended to members of our governments," Ndungu added dryly.
The newcomer was tall, clad in a skin-tight suit, rather like White Wolf's but black and without the shoulder armour, the cape or any obvious weapons. If the suit had a mask, it had been pushed back to fall about his neck, revealing the handsome, determined face of a man probably in his mid-twenties, about Steve's apparent age. Also, unlike White Wolf, he was plainly a Wakandan native.
Again there was a sudden widening of the eyes, but all the Panther said was, "I am pleased to meet you, Captain Rogers," as he clasped the offered hand. "And even more pleased to have fought beside you. Now, though, we must wait for our opportunity."
It was with a kind of relief that Tony rounded on him. "Did you pay any attention when you met Pepper, Jolly Green, or were you asleep? Would you really want to make that argument to her, because let me tell you, I don't. I prefer my head on my shoulders and my balls intact."
"I'll come to the workshop with you," Steve said, as firmly as he could manage. "I'd like to talk to Thor too."
"You asked me not to set him looking for data on her," Tony pointed out. "And Bruce persuaded me not to risk it. I didn't want to lose your trust. That's why I went through Natasha."
Tony, dressed in unrelieved black, was standing waiting for them, his usually mobile face impassive. Perhaps it was the sombre clothing or that Steve had not seen him for some days, but he looked unusually tired and pale.
Everything was suddenly clear, though, by God, it was a stretch. "You think it has something to do with that hurricane heading for the east coast."
"I didn't find out it was real until I started looking for Lieutenant Storm. Before then it was just rumour."
Steve's hands were suddenly on his shoulders, pulling him round so they were face to face. And close. So close.
Pepper watched him eat with approval. Then, after a while, she said: "Steve, I know how much you respect Tony, but for his sake, you have to talk to me."
His mind raced through the entire journey, going over the details of the last few days, dwelling on the mistakes that had cost him so much, what he might have done to prevent them, and the possible consequences of those actions. There was also a future to face in which he had to acknowledge that he had lost Steve, and to try to locate Bruce, to hope against hope that Thor would return, to keep anyone else from being killed, to accelerate the growth of Stark Energy using T'Challa's priceless gift and, most pressing of all, to do what he had promised Fury, and make sure SHIELD's informant at Stark Industries would be of no further use.
"And Tony pushing his luck," Steve added. "I don't think I did that much damage. There's the effect of him tumbling head first into his father's trap to consider."
Then North was beside him. "Call it off!" he snarled, and Tony felt the burn of the knife blade against his throat. "Call—" There was an electronic crackle and both knife and men fell away. Something, an insect maybe, though it seemed heavier than that – but, hey, Africa! – landed on Tony's wrist. He attempted to shake it off, but his movement was too restricted. Fuck it, it was probably going to bite—
Steve's arms relaxed and he slid forward, resting his forehead against Tony's, and they remained there for several minutes, in the warmth of the sunlight, with the promise of no lies between them, only possibilities.
Tony raised his head, and his eyes, bluer than the sky, than sapphires, were blazing with anger and grief. "What sort of... of... fickle coward do you think I am? Don't try to palm some sort of substitute off on me, Steve.
Half an hour later he was standing, whisky glass in hand, once again looking out through a ceiling high curve of window at a familiar view, but clear of skyscrapers and road and river traffic. Here there was just open ocean and rolling breakers below, the occasional smudge of an island no longer visible against the red sky, only a few navigation lights betraying the ships that would pass as night fell.
"Good. Sleep is for wimps – or at least not for Asgardian gods," Tony said, ushering Thor into the elevator. "We need to find out who's closeted with Hank," he added. Then, as the doors closed, he went on, impulsively, "There's something I have to tell you: the people I encountered in the eye of the hurricane were... magic users. Or at least what looked like magic. They had this sorta-Viking ship floating in the air in the middle of the eye."
"Jarvis." It was Jan's voice. She was on the other side of the security barrier, wrapped in a huge white towelling bathrobe. "Let me in, please."
"Well, if you'd had the nerve to face me you'd know about it, and you could have your Captain America suit."
He said, more calmly, "About ten years ago I came across a paper buried in one of the more obscure journals. It was several years old even then, and the ideas were so way out, there were so many gaps and so much arrogance displayed that it had been pretty much ignored by the scientific community. But it bugged me. There were parts of it that almost made sense – and those parts gave me ideas that led to the repulsor tech."
A 3D picture of Pepper's office materialised in front of him. Neither of the occupants was sitting at the desk. Steve was perched on the edge of the coffee table, with the Picasso Tony had given Pepper on her last birthday in his line of sight, and Pepper was in one of the two easy chairs, her feet on the coffee table next to Steve. They both looked insufferably relaxed.
Tony's only failure seemed to be with Wakanda, which remained as much a mystery as ever. Indeed, it caused him, in a fit of pique, to remark that, "Obviously the first rule of Wakanda is that you do not talk about Wakanda." This in turn led to Steve spending an uncomfortable two hours watching a movie that, for all its undoubted brilliance, left him shaking his head over a morality that seemed not to have improved since Prohibition.
Friend or enemy? His feelings towards the name were such a mixture that he could not isolate most of them.
"You can tell Nat and Clint," Tony had said in the few minutes of privacy they managed to snatch before Tony climbed into the Iron Man suit and the rest of them departed for JFK airport. "Or you can let it ride and I'll break it to them when we get to Seattle."
Again, the warrior flinched. "You should fear him. I do. So does my lady. Yet she has done his bidding."
Yeah. Stuff that could disable his shields and cut his armour to ribbons – in an eStarkStore. Concentrate on what Cap – Steve – needed to know. "The edges of the blades are only a molecule or so thick. That's—"
"What does it say?" Tony asked, with real interest, edging towards Steve in the hope of reading it over his shoulder.
Because of SHIELD (and Loki) they had gotten off on the wrong foot – Steve felt incredibly lucky to have been allowed a second chance to get to know the real Tony. It was a friendship he depended on too much to jeopardise.
Oooh, risky, Tony decided. Particularly if this new arrival had cottoned on to the fact that someone else was occupying White Wolf's costume.
But not red roses. Tony knew that red roses signified love, passion. Red rosebuds would have looked great with the blue things, but Steve had chosen not to include them.
"Do you suppose that was a deliberate attack, or was the giant-green-mutant-zombie-bear-dog on the Hulk-style run?"
"Possibly they called it by another name," the deep voice said calmly. "Nevertheless, your 'clean energy' technology is powered by it, and you have not been sold any from the legitimate source."
Things got more complicated after that, as everything involving Tony seemed to do. They sat in the back of the van and were driven to an airport (Steve thought it might be Idlewild, now confusingly known as JFK, which were the initials, he'd learned, of an assassinated president), where they disembarked in a deserted cargo bay besides a truck with its doors standing wide. They transferred their bags and the cargo crates from the van into the truck and closed the doors on it. Half an hour later they were in the air.
"Most of the people will be out fishing, and the children in school," T'Challa told them. "Still, be cautious. This way."
Steve felt sickening disappointment. He wanted Tony here and safe but... "What's the emergency?" he asked.
"Oh, come on, Tony. Your father may have put in a landline to keep in touch with the staff working here, but they would also have had all modern comforts. Of course he arranged for radio and TV reception."
"The Chitauri? Loki?" Barton's voice was tense, his hands clasped tight on his lap, as if he was trying to physically stop himself reaching for his bow.
It was only as he closed the doors behind them that he realised that they were not the only people who had headed out here to take advantage of its privacy. One was his father – who he would never fail to recognise, even if, as here, he was only a shadow against the light from the window behind him – but the others were unrecognisable, the glowing tips of a cigarettes visible in a couple of hands resting on the balcony safety rail the only nearby light.
"I'm flying the plane," Danvers called back. "Jan is acting as co-pilot, unless you're checked out on civilian jets."
It seemed like an ideal opportunity for a weapons test. "Hawkeye, remember those new explosive arrows I told you to be careful with. Now might be the time to use them."
T'Challa – at least Tony supposed it was T'Challa because he was in full Panther regalia, big cat mask and necklace of fangs included – was seated on a carved stool raised on a small dais, ringed by a semi-circle of generally older men and women in robes as richly-coloured as Tony's own.
"And, just in case you don't," Steve went on, "I feel that way too. When you're ready, I'll say it."
"Is it always like this?" Cap – no, Steve, because Captain America would never allow himself to look so young and vulnerable – asked.
"You're bluffing, Stark." Fury's one eye held a basilisk stare. Tony almost expected to be turned to stone. Or was that the right mythos?
"We've been busy, Stark, or hadn't you noticed? Fury ordered an autopsy, but that was delayed by an influx of bodies, human and alien. We want to do him justice. Are you asking for an invitation?"
"Let us hope that Odin does not notice it at all," Volstagg agreed. "With Loki confined, he would not need to look far for a magician who could conjure this, not with the Lady Frigga standing before him."
"Virgil Potts just called me," he said, once they were out of Steve's hearing. "He wants to know what you did to Pepper."
"And you, Tony. My goodness, you've grown," she added, offering him her cheek to kiss. She grinned mischievously up at him and flicked a glance sideways at the man with the sunglasses to see how he was taking it. Which was not well.
Tony had itched to go and see for himself, sure that he could sift details of the weapons and their power source from the remains that no one else could.
Tony burst out laughing, though only he knew that that laughter was forced. "Oh, sure, you expected to find him alive, did you? I doubt it. You were after the shield and Hydra's tech and maybe even what remained of Erskine's serum in Captain America's frozen body."
Tony saw the glowing figure start, then put the laptop aside, bounce off the bed, and pause to switch off the main lighting, so that only a bedside lamp was glowing.
"Yeah. It's bad," Tony admitted. He kissed Steve's cheek, in what he hoped was a gesture of comfort. "But you can't change human nature or social structures easily. Even though power never attracts moral people, we've made progress."
Stark wouldn't let himself be vulnerable to anyone. Probably not even Miss Potts. Steve said, carefully, "You mean your girl walked out on you because you couldn't explain what you were going to say to her when you thought you were dying? And she knows you better than anyone on Earth? You know, I think she might just come back, Tony."
Steve's flinch was enough to confirm Tony's guess, but his head lifted defiantly. "Does it matter?" he said. "You knew he wasn't really responsible but you tried to kill him anyway."
"Who do you think you are, telling me what to do?" Pepper yelled back. "You're insufferable, Tony Stark."
But Pepper, as always, was already talking over him. "If so it makes you look kinda elegant, like your Dad. I like the designer stubble but please don't grow a moustache because that would be gross. Hey, I thought I saw the helicarrier over the Sound – did I tell you I flew in from California as Rescue? – thank you for the upgrade, by the way." Pepper interrupted her avalanche of words long enough to kiss him on the cheek.
As he neared the surface, Tony could see two kinds of light; the one that flickered was almost certainly the continuous lightning in the eyewall, but the other was white and steady and seemed to come from a single point.
It still left room for too many thoughts. Life here was good, but it couldn't go on forever. Sooner or later – probably sooner – Tony was going to realise what a fraud Steve was. And he was still struggling to accept what Tony – and Howard – had done to protect him, not to mention the risks Tony had taken. He remembered vividly how abandoned he had felt when Tony had vanished, leaving him alone in a world he didn't understand, in the care of Howard, whom he hadn't quite trusted.
"So someone else must have duplicated the super-soldier process," Betty was saying. "No wonder Dad is furious. The nearest he got was Blonsky." Then, as Steve and Jan stared at her, Betty added, "The thing Bruce was fighting when he wrecked Harlem. The press dubbed him 'the Abomination."
Finally, he burst out onto a metal surface tilting to the right under the light of hazy stars. A massive tower loomed to his left, and an aircraft slid along the – deck? – in front of him.
Tony's refusal to be honest with him had destroyed Steve's confidence in the strength of their newly forged relationship—  if, indeed, Tony even thought of it as a relationship.
"This man is Tony Stark, the American engineer, who pilots the Iron Man armour, and can synthesise vibranium. His companion is Captain Rogers, who is his—"
Fury was eyeing him with a kind of resigned irritation. "Okay, Stark, you've made your point. You're in. So, where do we look?"
The steel-coloured War Machine armour, caught in the act of trying to raise the last few links of the articulated tail of a Chitauri troop carrier from their resting place on top of three yellow cabs, a truck and the remains of the store window taken out by the tip, jerked sideways. The tail swayed dramatically, then began to fall.
Hank, meanwhile, was standing at the far side of the conference table, his hands thrust into his pockets and a scowl on his face. As for his visitor, despite the immaculately tailored suit, so at odds with everything else Tony had seen him wearing, there was no mistaking the man seated at the conference table.
He hadn't managed it by the time the horses pulled to a halt just in front of the dome, Thor reaching out a hand to the grey's reins to reinforce herd instinct.
Tony swore creatively, disengaged himself from Steve, who made no resistance, rose, and stormed towards the computer terminals. It gave Steve the chance to climb, much more carefully, to his feet.
Tony opened the faceplate of the armour again. "When is Coulson's funeral?" he asked. "Or memorial service. Whatever?"
Steve glanced sideways at the long green cloak lying on the bed and said, "Are you trying to disguise me as Fandral?"
Howard was bending over the blonde woman. Now he felt in his pocket, produced some sort of restraining device and secured the woman's wrists and ankles. He met Steve's eyes and smiled. "Well," he drawled, "remind me not to doubt my son. Thanks, Captain."
Steve looked at the small piles and did a mental check. Apart from two of the ubiquitous tablets and a small tool pack, it pretty much matched the gear he had stowed into the duffle a few minutes before, save that Tony's tee shirts were mostly red. "Looks okay to me."
He knew. Of course he knew. It had been twisting his guts ever since they had arrived in the lobby of Stark Tower, but all his instincts demanded deflection. "Returned the Time Stone to this time and place?" he suggested, waving a hand at the amulet that nested in the robes that weren't quite saffron, nor yet cream. "Which considering how I feel about magic and wizards – except Wong, I'll make an exception for Wong – is a tribute to my respect for Bruce..." He petered out under the Ancient One's unwavering gaze.
Steve looked suspiciously at Tony. "If it is on computer," he repeated. "Would you need to ... hack? ... SHIELD's computers again?"
Even though there was no one else in the room to hear that innuendo, and Steve was sure Tony did not mean that the way it sounded, he felt heat begin to rise to his face. Carefully not replying to it, he said, "I take it they'd find it difficult to claim they owned Steve Rogers, or have they amended that out of the Bill of Rights?"
"I'll be in the workshop when you get in," Tony told her, heading for the door. No doubt she would get the story - well, his part of the story - out of him in bed that night, which was really the whole point of keeping it from her right now. Having someone to whom he could tell everything was the most wonderful aspect of his relationship with Pepper.
Steve felt a rush of relief. All Tony's wild emotion of the night before seemed to have retreated, leaving the familiar teasing affection, though there was a reserve in both his voice and expression, even in his position beneath the windows, as far from the bed as he could decently sit, that Steve hadn't seen for some time.
"I will not leave myself undefended," the strange voice rumbled, drowning those others so far away. "Those I fled from long ago will see me, even here, where I have made myself this sanctuary. When I came to this world, with my fellows, we ruled a great land, one of the greatest, but then we learned there were more powerful beings protecting this world and others. We were arrogant enough to defy them... and Asgard defeated us. They still watch. Only the magics turn aside the all-seeing golden-eyed one."
Hunter was yelling something in Wakandan, and the Hatut Zeraze responded so the air was filled with arrows and spears, which Jarvis, who was certainly running the suit, ignored. The explosions wouldn't even dent the armour, but those tipped with vibranium steel...
And it was the Red Skull's grinning skeletal head that was eaten by the blue-white lightning of the Tesseract, atom by atom, until its seething white column was pink streaked by blood and flesh as it burned upwards, carrying what remained of the Skull into the blackness of interstellar space, where stars and galaxies... swirled and the red skin peeled away into red flesh, atom by atom.
He whirled, checking every inch of the room, ready to fight, but there was nothing to fight against. "Where are you?" he demanded.
Tony, however, only stayed long enough to refuel, answering questions in monosyllables and refusing the beer everyone else was drinking.
in this matter." T'Challa rose to his feet. "There are camp beds and blankets. Sleep while you can."
"And then there's you, Lieutenant." Tony turned to look straight into the young man's eyes. Just a couple of shades lighter blue than Steve's, he noted absently. "Someone in the Air Force must have facilitated your kidnapping, but that doesn't mean they ordered it. You were taken by the mercenaries who also took Shuri, who tried to take over Wakanda, who have the Hulk, and who have tried to kill me and the Captain too many times. They have technology that marks them out. We thought that your abduction might have something to do with the theft of your sister's DNA sample, but that seems to be unrelated. So the question is, why? And who are these guys working for this time?"
"Shhh. I want you to hold me, Tony. This is nothing. It might seem bad to you but I spent two decades in chronic pain. And I'm pretty much healed from today's – yesterday's – injuries. So, please." Then, as Tony's arms went round his neck, "We'll find him," Steve promised. "You and me, we can do anything." He waited until Tony's breathing had steadied a little, and then asked, in a normal voice, "Do you know whose DNA it was?"
"I know what Fury told me, and what Dad told me and, most importantly, what Captain Rogers told me. I also know that anyone who threatens him is going to have to go through me." He was watching the President closely for any change of expression, any hint that she had been told that Captain Rogers was dead, but saw no sign of surprise.
Steve had that stoic look on his face that Tony had come to realise covered nervousness. It probably put the fear of God into everyone else, given his height, s musculature and breadth of shoulder. Currently he was scanning the area while tapping the sunglasses he would probably need within the hour on the palm of his hand. He nodded slightly at Tony and inclined his head towards two sets of headlights coming towards them. His stance had shifted, balanced on the balls of his feet, ready to move fast. Tony fingered the bracelet of the only-partly-a-watch on his left wrist, which, despite a lack of contact with Jarvis, could summon the armour from New York to close about him. Unfortunately, even if he activated it right now it would take hours to get here.
Tony gritted his teeth and accelerated, hoping to keep in touch with Steve, who was hurdling fallen logs as if he was in an athletics steeplechase. Ahead the land dipped towards the lake, and then both of them were scrambling on scree and years of accumulated needles, using the trees as brakes and handholds.
Now Dr Ross was really looking worried. "Bruce sent me a message saying he was going into danger, and not to worry because, you know, the Hulk is pretty much indestructible."
Pepper was shaking her head. "I didn't need Fury to tell me that. You're being ridiculous. And I don't have time for this nonsense."
Doctor Morganti's home address was in eastern Pennsylvania, and the code for her workplace led to a SHIELD research station based – oh, this was interesting – in a pharmaceutical laboratory now mainly occupied by biochemists from Culver University.
"I am not going to call out the Other Guy so you can play interrogator!" Bruce protested, ignoring the fact that Tony was busy exchanging rude hand signals with the cab driver.
"They already are," Tony said, knowing it for a fact. "That's why Hennis and his thugs were after Steve. They might even be considering cloning him, though that won't work unless the Erskine process actually changed his DNA. Maybe SHIELD can tell us. I will bet my fortune that they already have samples. Well, Cap?"
Tony forced himself into Chairman of the Board mode, which was as much as he could currently manage. "A great honour. On behalf of the Avengers, I thank you, and hope we may remain friends and allies."
The headlights, no doubt, were an indication that the guards at the gates had seen the explosions and responded predictably. Maybe, now the fire was out, they'd pass straight by, saving a lot of explanation...
Then suddenly he turned his head away, shoving at Tony's shoulders. "We didn't... oughta be doing this..." he panted.
Climbing carefully to his feet, he staggered over to the wet room Pepper had insisted he install, shedding his clothes as he went.
"Thank you," Chayo said quietly as Ndungu followed Steve. Only when they had disappeared did he add, "You should be safe enough, for Wakanda is, according to all reports, highly civilised, save in its adherence to a religion older than either Christianity or Islam. But two of my staff have been suddenly recalled – the ones I have long suspected of being from Wakanda. The political situation there may not be entirely stable. Be wary."
Tony took to the air, rocketing after them, hand repulsors firing. He was too late. The two mercenaries leaped into the portal but the Hulk was at their heels.
What they needed was to delay the ceremony long enough for the Iron Man armour to arrive and find Tony, who would then be safe and able, perhaps, to save T'Challa and Wakanda. And for that he also needed the magic that guarded Wakanda to vanish – always hoping that T'Challa dealt with the technological protections. Indeed, if the Panther had still been aware, he could have spoken to his god.
Suddenly feeling much more cheerful, Tony took the path someone – probably Bruce and Hank, under instruction from Jan – had cleared to allow access to the pool, then waded out into the grass until it came up to his knees rather than his waist.
Then he was engulfed in fog reddened by fire. Twisting in the air, he tucked himself into a ball. If he had managed to clear the strip of garden, the lake would be below him...
"Then take it," Hunter snapped. "As part of your payment." He stepped forwards to the front of the steps and addressed the muttering crowd in Wakandan.
He flung them outwards, willing them into Reality with all his fear and hope, willing all the might of the Power and Space stones to strike at the evil on their heels...
"They feed us little pieces of technology, in return for our silence and our assistance in dealing with the rest of the world," Chayo said. "The reason our governments have refused to negotiate with your representatives to bring us your new technologies is because they have been forbidden to do so by Wakanda.
The answer to that was far simpler. "Yes. Do that. Got anything on the Michael Moorcock connection? Or the Eternal Champ—?"
The rest of the company – a huge man with rusty hair and beard falling haphazardly in spiral curls; a compact, frowning man with features that set him apart from all the other Asgardians that Steve had so far seen, his black hair radiating  in short parasol spikes from a top knot; a slender and fierce-looking young woman with a sword in her belt; Fandral, and Thor – exchanged looks that ranged from puzzlement to alarm.
"Are you all right, Captain?" It was the English-accented voice from the air again, and it was so unexpected he almost fell into the empty tub.
Steve drew Tony's hand to his own lips, then said, "Sweetheart, what you need is to stop trying to run everything and give yourself time to think.”
He was so, so cold. One hand grasping steel that froze him even through the glove, the other reaching, reaching. The world was black and white and grey, and Bucky was falling, oh so painfully slowly, into the black, bottomless abyss, his face turned up to Steve, blue eyes – the only touch of colour there was – wide and accusing...
"Steve, I shouldn't—" Tony hesitated, then toed off his sneakers and flopped down on the bed, close to Steve but on top of the covers. "Okay. But no sex – no kissing even – tonight. We'll talk things over tomorrow," he added as he reached out and purloined one of the pillows.
"Hmm." Steve looked sceptical. "Is that really a good idea? Won't the other members of the Board need to have their say?"
licence ARC technology exclusively, even exclusively in any particular market area. And I won't sell it, even in sealed boxes that explode if you open them, to the military or ROXXON oil."
"I do not know," Okoye admitted. "Something is very wrong with my Lord. It is almost as if he is possessed."
As if he'd heard Tony's movement – and, hey, super-soldier senses so he probably had – Steve glanced towards him, then came swiftly to his feet.
The President remained remarkably quiet on the subject, though with an election approaching she would soon have to break her silence.
"He couldn't've be'n that stupid," Tony said, with what almost sounded like disappointment in his voice.
"All the same, we need to clear the facility," Tony decided. He pinched the bridge of his nose between his fingers, hoping the discomfort would help him concentrate.
The vehicle shot upwards and backwards. Something exploded to the left, sending the craft spinning out of control towards the outer 'thorn' barricade.
Tony turned his head so his face was hidden against Steve's shoulder, but his fingers were biting deep into muscle, as if he could hold Steve here by sheer force of will, and his whole body was shaking, each breath a gasp. "Isn't," he said petulantly.
Rhodey pulled off the War Machine helmet and stared at Tony, wide-eyed. "I know you aren't religious, buddy, but that's pretty damn close to blasphemy."
Howard waved Steve to a stool at the breakfast bar. Tony put a glass of orange juice in front of him and asked how he liked his coffee...
"Got it." Steve was fumbling for the control that lowered the left hand window. Even as it slid away, and with an air of what seemed very much like contempt, the shrunken Hulk leaped from Steve's shoulder onto the back seat and vanished behind Hank.
In which a lot of things move, sometimes rather too quickly... and too many people are taking an interest in Tony's tech.
The unknown – to him at least – nodded. "Give the man a cigar. You're nearly as smart as you think you are. Yeah, they were hired to kidnap Virginia Potts."
Those possibilities had simply not occurred to Tony. Surely there was no one who had ever met Steve who didn't want to see him again? He was set back on his heels, but only for a moment. "In that case we tell Steve she's confirmed dead..."
It took him precisely ten minutes and twenty three seconds to enter the building, make his way to the vault, open the doors, scoop every vial of blood and serum into a fold-out shopping bag that had been stowed in one of the armour's secure cavities, replace the bag with one special and very old sample and leave, letting the delayed commands lock the vault behind him.
They needed allies. The people lurking in the jungle didn't act like warriors; they acted like people who wanted to help, but were scared of the Iron Man armour. He could hardly blame them for being scared of something designed to be scary.
"Jan dragged him off when we started to technobabble," Tony told him. "Probably wants to tell him what you've found out about the Chitauri tech, and incidentally show off the Pym process."
Steve was still hesitating; rubbing the back of his neck in what was plainly an habitual nervous gesture. "I need to check whether an address in England exists and, if it does, the name of the person who lives there – and whether the telephone number I have for them is correct."
"Tony," Steve said. "Didn't you say that it was a theoretical paper of Richards that put you on to repulsor tech?"
Tony nibbled at the hand. As soon as Steve removed it, he said, "I'm impressed. You were as exhausted as I was."
An old woman sat halfway down the steps, a small bowl on her knees. She was pounding at something in it with a wooden pestle, ignoring the crowd. She only raised her head for a moment as a group of men climbed the steps past her, headed by T'Challa and White Wolf walking side by side.
A Wakandan woman – an important one to judge by the richness of her robes and the extent of her adornments – pushed her way past the line of warriors and called out a challenge.
Tony let his eyes widen. "Why, for God's sake? I can't think of anything that would make you take such a stupid risk..." Even as he spoke, Tony realised he was wrong. "Except your daughter. Damn it, Alison, I should have seen that."
Jean laughed. "Take it from me, the limited vocabulary is a bonus. You'd know that if you'd been lectured by Professor X."
Saying "No sex" to Steve had been easy. Ignoring his own physical reactions was not. Damn it, he'd had this under control. Until tonight. Until he'd been shown, in no uncertain terms, that Steve – who was alive! Alive! Thank all the gods of Asgard – that Steve was willing – had wanted – to have sex with him.
"Before you steal them from me for StarkEnergy, right?" Pepper said, in that I-know-your-game-Mister-Stark voice that he hadn't heard for a while.
Tony winced and then hoped that that hadn't been visible. "It's not that. It's something I have to be sure about before I ac— tell anyone."
Bruce ignored the babble. "The ants pointed Hank in the direction of that big outcrop near the valley head. Steve climbed up and found that one of the trees clinging to the cracks was actually metal. There was rotted coaxial running down a deep – and probably artificial – crack in the rock into the valley. From there on it was easy."
"Natasha and Clint. Are you sure that was the phrase she used? Come on, I know how good your memory is now."
"Welcome, Man of Iron! There are foes enough for both of us!" Thor called. "But I would welcome assistance with this vehicle."
Steve muttered something under his breath, rubbed his cheek where Pepper had kissed him, sighed, and shook his head.
Steve was sitting on a hunk of concrete amid chaos, as SHIELD agents, EMTs, firemen, representatives of half a dozen police forces and the odd stubborn citizen milled and yelled about him. He was taking no notice of them, his shield between his spread knees, his cowled head bowed.
Let's pretend the Gulfstream G650 came into service a couple of years earlier than 2012, okay? At least until I get round to a full edit after the story is completed.
The intruder was not Tony, at least; he was twice as wide and, well, bald, and he braked to a stop when he spotted the empty bed, his back still to Steve. It was the work of a moment to grab him in a choke hold and render him unconscious.
It was a relief to take the wheel of the SUV and carry Bruce and Steve off to Steve's apartment to collect those few possessions – apart from the shield and the bike, which were already at the Tower – that he was allowing himself to call his own.
Even as he was speaking, Tony was pulling a clean t-shirt and jeans from his locker. He could have done without underwear and socks if he had to, but both were present, though donning anything at all while still monitoring the displays was... awkward.
"Why doesn't that surprise me?" Steve asked the air. His expression sharpened. "Tony, are you hiding broken ribs?" It couldn't be too bad; there was no blood on Tony's lips, so at least he hadn't punctured a lung. The odds of getting him to allow Steve to get a proper look at his injuries were prohibitive so, instead, he took the opportunity afforded by the fact Tony was still using him as support to run a firm hand down the side his fellow Avenger had been favouring.
With the clothes carefully draped across one arm, he was making his way back towards the stairs when Steve's voice said, "Tony..."
"No, you haven't." Pepper slapped his left hand pocket. "You just don't want to leave the booze and broads—"
"Jarvis," Iron Man said as he rose into the air. "Plot me a path back to the road that I can repulsor clear of such inconveniences as trees, steering well away from the portal. And bring up the stealth suit to help."
It was only then that the memory of Thor as he would be today, as he had been at the Battle of New York made him catch his breath. It was such a dreadful contrast to Thor as he had been in the days of their defeat. But Thor had an excuse. He had lost everything but had still, at the last, fought for others. Tony knew how easy it was to turn to alcohol for comfort. Luckily, for him, he'd always had someone, be it his mother, Edwin and Ana Jarvis, Rhodey or Pepper... He'd never lost everything...
Besides, he was being held so tightly in the other man's arms that he couldn't break free without hurting him.
"It's a Van Dyke. And I gotta distinguish myself from Dad," Tony said lightly, curling closely into Steve's side. "And how old are you, cradle snatcher?"
Clea had introduced him as her teacher and mentor, Doctor Stephen Strange, who had looked at them all with cold, suspicious eyes, flung his cloak around Clea and vanished.
He did wish he had more time to think. He also wished that it was someone other than Steve who had been carrying the Stones, because there were still all those unresolved issues between them. Above all, he wished he could go home to Pepper and Morgan.
"Okay. Let's hope you don't regret it. We're going to pick up a small group of scientists and their equipment. I have a fix on their location but right now they're on the run from a group of highly dangerous mercenaries. Luckily, they also have some equally dangerous protection."
The view was glorious – and he hated it. It was at once too similar to and too different from the one from the roof of Stark Tower, as if he was looking at Manhattan through a distorting mirror. The tall buildings and the stretches of water were what gave the place that disturbing familiarity, but the scale of Asgard was... colossal. Nor was Manhattan surrounded by rocky crags that looked almost as high as the Alps without either their white tops or green valleys.
He glanced at his watch. Tony should have been out of the spa by now but was probably waiting for that Martini he wasn't going to get. At least not from Steve. Or, if he really was that stiff, he might have had problems getting out. He'd better go and lend a hand if necessary.
"Wish we knew," Barton said. "No, wait, wait, Stark." He raised his hands, palms outwards, whether defensively or placatingly was not immediately clear. "Cap told me and Nat you were in trouble – possibly Thor too. He and Van Dyne arranged a repurposed air-sea rescue helicopter for us to pick up at Norfolk. We went looking for you, but Thor found us first – and then he found you."
Then Steve's hands closed on his waist to lift him, and the pain made Tony gasp and flinch before he could stop himself from reacting.
He wondered if there had been a measure of what was now called 'genetic engineering' in the mixture of serum and vita-rays that had turned him into the one and only super-soldier.
"Never mind that now," he said, reaching for a towel and pushing it into Steve's hands. "Dry yourself off. I'll go check what food we have."
"She is a truly courageous woman," Shuri said. Then, still suspiciously, "How do you know my brothers?"
"And mine," a third voice said. "Colonel Marchand speaking. You may have command of some nebulous mission, Fury, but
"What exactly, are you implying?" Tony demanded, but he knew, he knew, and the taste of it was bitter. Carter was claiming that she might be an even better link to Steve's past than being Peggy's great-niece and virtual double. Peggy's granddaughter – and Steve's? She looked like Peggy, but the colouring...
That second time he'd reached out with his Extremis-enhanced mind and found... nothing save the dumbest of monitors and computer controlled feed lines.
"Well, that answers that. How the fuck did you let a Doombot get ahold of that ring, Gene?" Tony demanded.
In return he received blank stares and the attention of two guns, but no one actually moved, except for the man who hadn't bothered to ready his own weapon. He stepped forward. "Mr Stark? I'm Major Hennis of the MICIO."
It wasn't just the farms as big as a county run by half a dozen people, the deserted towns, the closed schools, the insularity of those who remained, but the feeling that the very heart of America was slowly dying.
He had been dependent on Pepper for so long, and when he had been dying he had tried to make sure of her future by handing her the company on a plate. Despite the panic in which the decision had been made it had proved to be inspired. She ran the company well and loved running it, loved Stark Industries for its own sake, while he was only interested the company as a means to shape the world, his world, into something better. But with the ridiculous amount of time she spent in the office and he spent in the workshop, not to mention, in her words, his addiction to Iron Man and the Avengers, they hardly saw each other anymore, except in bed. And, God help him, he was sometimes irritated by the way she tried to organise his life.
Despite there being only two people seated at the end of a table that was designed for twenty, its marble top was almost invisible under the scatter of takeaway containers, paper bags, bottles, glasses, porcelain plates, exquisite Chinese bowls, silver flatware and cheap wooden chopsticks.
The conversation paused while each course was delivered, which appeared to give Tony the time he needed to collect his thoughts and edit out any touch of the personal from his narrative. Steve suspected that that was what he had planned when he had arranged for them to come here.
"Mr Stark, sir." The call came from the reception desk. They'd been extra fast. "We have no trace of a Steven Rogers, with or without the G or the PH or the D entering or leaving the building in the past month. We used to have a Grant Stephens working in Legal, but he left six months ago, and there's an S. Rogers in IT, but she's Sonya."
"Of course. I am chosen of the Panther god. Enhanced night vision – how would you Americans say? – comes with the territory."
But Bruce drew back and gave Tony a stern look, which, of course, had no apparent effect. Indeed, Tony was on his toes and almost bouncing with excitement. "Got another present for you and Hank, kiddies. Steve, could you carry that crate for me – no, that one – and we'll go see our resident biochemical genius."
"Bruce set off the explosion," Steve interrupted. "That's what caused him to Hulk out. What I don't understand is why he attacked you and Hank. At the Battle of Manhattan he worked with us, took orders, saved your life—
"Yes," Steve said shortly. There had been no condemnation in Tony's comment, but no approval either.
"Huh? What?" Steve blinked sleepily at him. His expression moved from puzzlement to a slow smile to open adoration. "Hi."
"So  all we can do now is wait," Steve said, as Clint's face collapsed into an instant of static, then disappeared.
Steve's eyes closed in relief and exhaustion. But there was still one question he had to ask. "Tony? Is he—?
Frigga might be Queen of Asgard, and its current ruler, but she was not a lady who stood on ceremony. What was more, she was perfectly willing to answer his questions. According to her, the poison had "stemmed the flow of your spirit" which was "slow to return to its full power."
"He's just flattering me," Steve said. "Meanwhile, hadn't you better shower and change? You're extremely late already and Pepper is going to kill you."
Steve sat in front of the computer, sighing while he clicked on the link popping up in his timeline for what felt like the millionth time, soon recognizing the smooth voice and whiskey eyes.
Of course I never even imagined that it would all end the way it did. In the few moments of clarity I had during our crisis, when it started to hit me that the end was near, I just believed that that we would break up and live our lives, until we meet again in a not so distant future, when we'd both be more mature, with good jobs and ready for a lasting relationship.
Before the bartender could answer, a loud, familiar voice rang in Tony’s ears, who turned to see the person he wanted so badly. Steve Rogers was standing in front of him, a glass in his hand and a see-through black blouse down the front, and all Stark wanted to do was run his fingers across those pecked abs.
said I had used too much and the movie had rotten, but I'll never forget the burned tips of the tape when I accepted to throw away the mortal remains of my obsession. Guess I never made much of an effort to hide my sexuality. Thanks God.
“I think it's Rogers? You did a video saying you would show him he likes dicks if he wanted to.” the girl said again. Repeating it was really that necessary? Steve knew Tony knew who he was, the entire United States knew who he was, for Christ's sake. Not to brag or sound egocentric, but it
, his favorite super-hero would be Iron Man. He's just as arrogant. He was much more of a Team Cap guy himself – he'd seen the movies after all, the only thing Iron Man really fought for was himself.
Proper explanations are due, I finish here my opening post. As soon as I'm able, I'll come back here to describe my first date, preferentially in astrological order, that is, starting with the first star sign of the Zodiac.
Steve asked in confusion, thinking for the second time in the last half an hour that he was getting crazy “What was that about the second picture?”
As he wove his way through the throng, he caught another tantalising glimpse of the blond man now dancing with a too-skinny thirty something with haunted eyes. Tony's eyes lingered on the man's neat ass, shown to perfection by too tight – no
Ah, a new puzzle. Tony felt a flood of relief. Puzzles were distracting. Puzzles could consume him. "Go on. Is it about your Dad?"
But that was something Steve simply could not do. He was quiet on the ride home – no, it wasn't his home, he needed to remember that – and Tony was also silent, concentrating on the traffic.
Steve straightened his eyes on Storm. "You were going to fly co-pilot on the new orbiter. Where was that going to be launched?"
Tony snorted. But he remembered the look on Steve's face as he returned it to him and remained otherwise silent.
Tony struggled against his bonds, concentrating his anger on the restrictions, because he dared not, even for a moment, look towards Steve's motionless body lying beneath the paws of the statue of the Panther god. If he did, grief might overwhelm the anger and he would lose not just Steve, but the future of the world.
He pushed forwards, feeling resistance from the water – perhaps from a current – and from the thick mud laced with twigs beneath his feet. His back – and his ears – had started hurting again now they were out of the water, but he was used to ignoring pain.
He rolled over, and his hand fell on Tony's hip. Instantly, Tony also shifted, and Steve's hand slid down – accidentally, of course accidentally – onto Tony's ass. Which felt wonderful. As did the thrill centring on his groin.
That told Steve that they were well drilled, and probably military, though he couldn't even guess what they were looking for. One of their number lay still on the tarmac, his gun beside him. There was no clue as to whether he was unconscious or dead.
The two men looked at each other, then back at the other farm truck. There was a middle-aged woman at the wheel and a young man beside her.
When Tony had invited Bruce to stay at Stark Tower he had had an unexpressed notion of him working for Stark Industries research division, of them sharing ideas and lab space.
"And that," T'Challa said, "may be played to our advantage. We will strike in the early morning tomorrow, when few will be awake and alert. Now, though, eat and rest. Then we will plan."
"Tony. Tony, release the locks on your armour, huh, so we can get you out of it without damaging it more than it is already.""
South... South lay Oklahoma, more land like this, but it was also where Bruce was located and, tempting as it was to join him, to build on a tentative friendship to replace at least one of those he had lost, he knew he must not put him in danger.
"Is it SHIELD again?" Tony demanded, hands clenching. Coulson's arrival in the Tower had seen his systems by-passed once too often, and now the Tower was as secure as he and Jarvis could make it. Which meant, he hoped, that it was one of the most secure places on the face of the Earth.
"Yeah, I'm aware. This place doesn't seem to have changed since the war, and it was run down even then – and should you be standing with the seat belt light still on?"
There was no time to reply because the tumult of water was already up to Steve's chin, the thin fuselage walls caving in under the pressure as it sank down towards the bottom.
"You're just nosy. Like me." Tony reached for a pair of pliers and used them to pick up the envelope.
With a sigh he rose to his feet and made his way back towards the entrance to the penthouse, fighting the high wind with little effort. It was then that he became aware of raised voices inside the building.
Abruptly realising he still had his arms around Tony's chest, Steve let go and started to scramble to his feet, with every intention of taking off after the tiny Hulk. Surely he couldn't get very far.
"Is that how you got to be a – what was it Tony said? – an 'heiress, playgirl, biochemist and fashion designer'?"
Whoever was sitting up front, they had confidence that amounted to arrogance. They'd be sorry for that.
"Nope. I had that with me all the way through high school, though it's been upgraded since. I refuse to go undefended." He repacked the bag quickly and surprisingly neatly and stood glaring at it for a moment before turning to Steve. "You got everything you need?"
"Your adopted sister. No, no, Shuri is in France and oblivious to what is happening. Her Professor's research has necessitated the use of fresh human blood. What more natural than his students should contribute to the research materials? Shuri is safe and whether she remains so depends completely on her. She might be wise not to try to come home."
To his own astonishment, Tony had slept for over twelve hours after they had arrived here. He'd firmly steered Steve to the main suite. It had the largest bed, which Steve needed more than he did, and he did not want to sleep in what had been his parents' bed. Nor think about Steve sleeping there, as it happened.
"Ross is obsessed with Cap and the Other Guy," Tony said. "He doesn't like me but I don't think trying to kill me is a priority. Certainly killing Betty isn't. Nor does he have access to the type of tech used in that attack or that Steve, Jan, Hank and I saw in Africa. If he still thinks Steve is dead he certainly wasn't privy to the attack on us by the War Machine armour. To which he never had access."
"A commission interview. A kindergarten wanted some murals painted, and that, at least, is something I'm qualified to do, so..." He shrugged. "If the police have my bike they must be puzzled by the drawings I'd done."
"Sir." The voice was female and there was something vaguely familiar about it. Probably someone he had met at SHIELD HQ.
Summoning all of his will, he shoved the pain and fear to the back of his mind, making himself think clearly. It wasn't only his consciousness that was at stake, but Natasha's.
"I want to... to have sex with you. I want you to fuck me into the mattress or against the wall or whatever you want..." His voice faded into a whisper. "I want you inside me. Please."
"Sure." That had, Tony suspected, more to do with the disappearance of all the data on the members of the Avengers from SHIELD's files than the Director's benevolence. Tony only wished he'd been there when the technicians told him what had happened. Jarvis had reported the systems shut down and rebooted. However, that only made it easier to wipe selected data from the backups themselves, and SHIELD's private cloud space.
That didn't have the effect on his friend that Tony had anticipated. "And that's another thing: this new version of Captain America."
Hogun shrugged. "Ask the Valkyries to take you. But Frigga and Thor think not. They believe, given your prowess as a warrior, that Odin will confine you to Asgard. I have been charged with getting you to Midgard first."
"Not spectacularly." Though he had, in fact, taken no more than a single mouthful of the Scotch, as Tony spoke a wave of dizziness swept over him, leaving him trembling. Fuck it, the stimulant T'Challa had ordered his personal physician to give him must be wearing off. He was going to have to speed things up. Gathering his wits, he straightened and placed the glass carefully on the dressing table. "What are you doing packing at nine forty-five in the morning?"
"You don't need evidence," Hennis retorted. "Don't play the innocent with me. You're Howard Stark's son and a SHIELD consultant. You've known who Rogers was since you were three."
When Steve reached the security office dead on time, he found it empty except for a dark haired man in a smart navy blue uniform with a lot of gold on the sleeves. A military style cap lay on the desk next to his feet, and his face was buried in a mug.
Even more ominously, the police hadn't called for witness statements. Cap's motorbike was almost certainly present at the scene, yet there was nothing in any of the reports to suggest it had been found. Tony still had the Harley WLA that Howard Stark had modified and SHIELD had bugged in the Tower garage, but he had sent Happy Hogan, who had purchased the Triumph Tiger Explorer as its replacement using the new identity Tony had forged for Steve Rogers, and had checked him out on it before he took to the road. Happy didn't find it, but reported a jumpy police presence.
One commentator had said it was meant to be a picture of the USSR in 1948, the year it was written. That was disconcerting too. Sure, the Soviets had switched sides, but they had hated the Nazis. When he had ... gone missing in action ... the Nazis had been outside Stalingrad and the Russians resisting as best they could.
"My plane, my rules," Tony said cheerfully, grinning as he sashayed across the cabin to where the case containing his armour was strapped to the wall on its own custom fixings. Unfortunately, the plane chose that moment to hit a stretch of broken concrete and lurch.
"Don't ask me," Tony said. "All I know is, I had bruising encounter with their Queen." He waved a hand vaguely across his face and torso, which Steve suddenly noticed was covered by a tee that announced 'Snark Program Engaged'. He hadn't known he owned such a thing but it wasn't the first T-shirt to mysteriously appear amid his clothing, and Tony had a nerve to complain about how tightly they fitted.
He was relieved when they landed neatly on the Tower's helicopter pad but that feeling vanished when he saw Maria Hill waiting for them, a slight smile on her face.
Steve looked up into Howard's eyes, so like his son's. "Maybe they can trigger me. Maybe I'm meant to gain your confidence and destroy you. I don't know!"
The man who answered it was squat and powerful, with an expression that suggested the scum of the Earth had just rolled up on his doorstep.
low and slow and non-metallic. It'll profile like a kite or glider on radar. Or it may have gotten clearance from Air Traffic Control – ah, Jarvis says it has. It's advertising a new movie... and it's just amazing. I suspect everyone's too busy capturing it on their cells to even think about calling the military."
"I wondered why she kept glaring at me," Natasha replied, holding out a hand to haul him to his feet. "And you need to take a look at how you see yourself."
But the bullets merely stitched holes in the walls, shattered a mirror wall (and, damn it, the security cameras behind it) and destroyed the specially commissioned artwork.
Perhaps the comms were out. Perhaps his own hearing had been affected by the explosion. Perhaps the fog's dampening effect was stronger than he thought it should be. Or perhaps Tony was dead. In which case, he might as well stop treading water and let himself go down again.
For the sun had disappeared behind the hills, and evening was falling swiftly. Even the flames around the car had died. As the light of Tony's phone dimmed they were alone in the dark in a narrow valley thick with shrubs, trees and unstable rocks.
"Well I know that now, Stark. I made it my business to track Pepper down and she'd been attending classes in LA when she was apparently with me."
"Bathroom's through there." Tony gave him a gentle shove in the right direction and Steve went meekly enough, if a little unsteadily.
Tony yelped and grabbed for the nearest handhold, which happened to be Steve, who smothered his own exclamation of surprise and tightened his grip on the door. Not that either of them supposed they would escape with their lives...
"Frigga," she corrected him. "Or Lady Frigga if you wish to be formal. I am not your queen. At least—" She frowned. "—I hope I will never be your queen. For now I am simply your magician-physician." She paused, her expression quizzical. "The Allspeak made a mess of that, didn't it?"
"Question seconded, Robin Hood," Tony said, looking hard at Jan. "Some of it was a holographic projection – using my tech, I might add – but there was something physical, very large and very strong in there too."
He clattered down the stairs, deliberately making noise. By the time he reached the foot, Tony Stark was waiting for him, in black jeans and a red t-shirt, looking incredibly handsome, ridiculously young, and totally... edible.
"Is that," Steve answered, from where he was standing with his arms folded, looking down his nose at the Doombot, "why your computer is so keen on lecturing me?"
"Still alive. He's under constant guard by my sisters of the Dora Milaje – who still do not entirely believe that T'Challa gave me permission to speak in a language other than Hausa and to non-Wakandans at all. It has not gone down well with the Council either. Luckily, they don't know about Pym."
"I did. The first night when SHIELD had too much on its plate to keep track of something so big and inert that no one was likely to make off with it. Or believed that there were any nerves to fry. I don't think anyone's going to get anything much out of the Chitauri tech except us—"
But matched against the impossibility of Captain America's survival, and the huge gap since his disappearance, the words meant little. It was assumed that this was some sort of con by the nebulous 'authorities' behind the Avengers.
He never used to be afraid. Well, not as Iron Man. But the implications of what had happened today were not something that Iron Man could deal with – that would be all down to Tony Stark.
"Vibranium?" he was astonished to hear his own voice, and reached desperately for control. If he couldn't stop himself talking maybe he could nudge himself into his habitual diversionary tactics. "Rumour has it that's the stuff my father used to create Captain America's shield but I've never laid hands on the stuff—"
The study was almost exactly the opposite of everything in the Stark house; book lined, with Victorian antique furniture, and a number of second-rate browning seascapes in baroque gilded frames, and reeking of nostalgia and convention.
"I may be completely wrong. So much has changed over the last seventy years – but I was in England a while during the war, and the address is like nothing I ever heard or saw there."
Steve saw the gleam in Tony's eyes as he opened his mouth to reply and kicked his ankle hurriedly. "Let's hope that it doesn't affect Artificial Intelligence. But if it does, what do you have to do?"
"Be careful," Tony said, "and yell to Jarvis if you need help. Bruce would never forgive me if I allowed you to get killed."
"Jarvis," he said, "use the ultraband radar to build a map of the caves and passages in the mountain. And map any gamma radiation hotspots onto it."
Unable to find controls anywhere outside the spur tunnel, they left the 'door' open and went to find the others.
"That last will of his," Tony said. "There wasn't some sort of secret codicil to it, waiting to ambush me?"
"Sir, my maps and the satellite cameras show nothing but sea and mangrove swamps at those co-ordinates."
The Iron Man stood in the air, inches above rustling crowns of the rain forest trees. From this vantage point, using the HUD nightsight, he could see the unnaturally abrupt change to savannah on the open plain at Wakanda's borders.
"No and no. You really think I'm gonna pass this to the Feds or SHIELD any time soon? Uhuh. The secret of this dies with me an' Jarvis. Okay, buddy, hijack that cell and prepare to call the number Captain Rogers gave you. Steve, not a word. You'll get your chance if Margaret Carter really is on the end of this."
"It's just relief," Jean said. "Believe me, I'm on a team of testosterone filled teens, and I know."
A torpedo-shaped bolt of red and gold screamed across the heads of the crowd, bright against the growing darkness. The crowd stopped listening to White Wolf; those beneath it fell to the earth, while the rest scattered towards the jungle.
"He'll be happy about that – and so am I. Next time, bring some more of the Avengers, Tony. I want to feed them. Thor looks as if he could even out-eat Captain Rogers here."
Two horses were tied up in the shadow of the lean-to, swishing their tails against the depredations of the flies. One might have meant Lori, but two...
"I don't even know where Stark Air Services is," Steve admitted, as he finger-combed his hair back into place. "Or what it is, come to that. Tony's never mentioned it."
"Who knew I was here? It was your car, coming from a place where you own the lease on a dining room, not far from the house you built. No, this one was aimed at you. Mostly, though, this attack was incompetent – and by all accounts Rhodes isn't."
