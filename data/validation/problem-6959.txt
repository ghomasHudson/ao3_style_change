Lost in a trace, he was sure Steve left the hotel, but there was the sound of the faucet running in the bathroom. It went on for a while, the white noise lulling Tony into a fitful slumber.
Steve shuts his eyes, he presses a thumb to the space between his eyes, and breathes heavily. “I’m sorry. I’m fucking this up. That’s not what I meant.” He opens his eyes to see Tony’s patient expression. “I mean, what I mean to say, is—” he stutters upon the words. “I’ve read about that, I’m sorry to hear about them. I’ve read about you, too. You seem like a good person, I just… is it alright to have some sort of investment in your well-being?”
He tries to stay close to Tony, afraid to lose him as they pass through a throng of people. “Er, I saw you kiss someone at the party,” Steve says, yelling in case Tony doesn’t hear him.
The man who wears Steve’s face stops in front of Tony, squeezes his shoulders. “Farewell, Stark,” he says, as if this would give Tony closure.
His family all stood by the lake and they parted with nods and pats on the back for Steve. Morgan stood between Harley and Peter, holding onto the latter’s hand.
“Tony, I’m asking,” Steve is pleading. He knows this from the tone of his voice. He’d be on his knees if it didn’t mean sparing the last of his pride.
It was that righteousness that Tony loved— still loved— and sometimes he wondered how that was still possible. People chose their hells though, and grief was a specific mode of torture.
“Obviously.” Tony huffs, letting the tension disappear. “Having kids around… they need regular meals and I’ve been bullied as the cook.”
Steve didn’t let it heal. He picked at it in the evenings in bed, turning over memories that refused to fade away. That’s one thing he was grateful for—eidetic memory. Tony may be memorialized in books, essays, and street art, but there were memories that belonged just to Steve. Like the way Tony woke up in the morning and how he turned his wedding band when he was thinking.
“I hope so,” Tony laughed. “God, I’m a little fucked in the head because I’m expecting something bad to happen. Things can’t always be perfect, can they?”
“Yeah. We gotta go guys.” He sat up, scrubbing at his hair, but the movement was sluggish. “Come on.”
Silence enveloped them. Tony twitched and the stabs on his arms itched, but he didn’t dare move. Steve was measuring his breaths.
The burn is good. He’s well stretched with fingers, spit, and lube, but there’s nothing like being pried open by Steve’s thick cock. It’s stupid, but he feels whole. This is one thing he’s sure of. Fucking is what he knows. Tony stabilizes himself with both hands going to Steve’s shoulders and bounces up and down, letting gravity pull him down.
There’s not much to miss when the only fond memories they shared were barbed comments exchanged in the saloon or when Rogers would arrest him for public disturbance. They said more when Tony was being a nuisance, yelling and yapping outside the station, drunkenly trying to get Rogers’ attention.
“And then, everything will be fine?” Steve brought Tony’s hand to his chest. They were strong, calloused, and filled with scars. Tony’s survived Afghanistan, the wormhole, and hundreds of missions.
“Alright, okay.” Steve nodded, cradling Tony’s head and kissing him with all the hope and gratefulness he felt. “We have today and the rest of our lives.”
It's alright, Tony will lie to himself and pretend the world has been overtaken by Skrulls instead. He's still in the helicarrier now. Still Director, and Maria Hill will come any minute now, rip his ass for doing another wrong thing.
“Indeed, Stark.” Natasha pauses at the edge of the dam’s remains scattered across the bedrock. There’s a large footprint from Banner. She stares at it, sighing before turning back to Tony. “And while I’m ecstatic that James has returned to me, I — I think that the dead should stay dead. I cannot shake the feeling that it isn’t him.” She cries, “God, that must make me an awful wife. All I ever wanted was for him to return to me. But I saw the scalp, no matter how much Rogers tells me that was a way to stop the questions from being asked.”
With Ru beside him, Tony had felt a little braver. But he was never at ease because if you let your walls down, you allow people to crawl inside your body and sometimes all they want to do is live in your bones, until you don’t realize they’re there at all. And once they become part of you, it’s hard to ask them to leave.
“Oh my god, Steve. They’ve been fucking for months now.” Tony barked a laugh, eyes dancing. Steve was glad he wasn’t wearing his sunglasses. Tony looked immaculate in those Tom Fords. But Steve loved seeing the brown of his eyes, the speck of green in his irises. They were wide and expressive.
He tugs at Tony’s balls until he’s let off. Tony gives him an amused smile. “No one can keep me from having your mouth, Rogers.”
“Will you come for me?” Steve asks, and Tony nods, frantic now. He tries to get a hand between their bodies but Steve slaps it away, admonishing him with a huff. He leans back, spits on his hand, and jerks Tony off.
“You weren’t sleeping?” Steve sat on the other end of the couch, setting the briefcase on his lap. “I think you should be getting rest, Tony. From my understanding, you just had the arc reactor removed, right?”
Steve settled Tony on his feet, turned him around against the tiles. He took the washcloth and began scrubbing Tony’s back, unhurried. He kissed Tony’s shoulders, the middle of his back, before dropping down to check his hole. The water was already washing away his come. Tony clenched and a little dripped out.
Tony eyes him for a beat, and he must see something, because squares his shoulders, determined, then pushes his chair back. The sound of wood drags against the floors. He glances at Steve, and Steve knows that it means stay put, watch guard, and maybe reading quick expressions like this they’ll both never unlearn.
Steve offers him a hand, palms outstretched. The moment before Goliath’s death flashes, bright and vivid. Steve offers a hand, there’s that damned EMP. In the Mansion, Steve offers a hand.
He wants to press his face to the crook of his arms, wipe away the dampness there. Hide. But he doesn't. He puts on a brave face, nods.
“For you.” Steve dropped the crown on Tony’s head. “You look like you belong here. Pretty, naked, mine.”
Steve walks along the bright-light halls. He used to think that the Compound was too cold, too empty of personality with its sleek lines and grayscale walls. He used to think it was like the exterior of the Stark Tower, stoic and untouchable. But Steve’s always been the outsider, a simple pedestrian looking at the skyscraper from the street.
Steve wraps his arms over his chest, wondering what he’ll do if he’s not on the road, if there’s any job in town for him. “I’m in no rush to be anywhere else.”
He and Tony weren’t meant to be apart, dammit. Steve’s a God-fearing man, call him traditional or romantic, but he believed that if he had to die, it would be just right after Tony.
Steve stayed still, grinning as Tony began whining and fucking himself on Steve’s cock. He placed both hands on Tony’s hips and began thrusting in and out. When their movements turned manic, Steve grabbed Tony’s dick and pumped its shaft until they both came.
“I still like it.” Steve walks up to him and sets a hand on Tony’s waist. He presses their foreheads together.
It was summer in New Mexico, and the leaves were of the distant had patches of gold. Steve was thirsty, he remembered that. They spent hours just flying around the state, Tony touring them through different peaks and ranges. Life could be beautiful, Steve had thought.
Steve smiles, proud of how Tony’s gotten to this point. There were times back when they all lived in the Tower where Tony would go for days just drinking smoothies and eating trail mix.
“Alright, fine, I know I shouldn’t believe everything in the paper, but he was the talk of the century for ages. You seem like a good guy. He’s lucky to have you.”
He enlisted their kids to pout and whine with worry anytime Tony watched the news and said, “The Avengers could use Iron Man.”
He was in the safety of their bedroom so he let out a muted wail and dropped his head to the wall. His entire body shook and he felt like vomiting again. Slowly, he turned back to the mirror and placed a hand to his middle.
Steve climbs into the driver’s seat and rests his hands on the steering wheel. He grips it for a beat and imagines himself driving further and further up north with no doubt in mind. He’ll only be there for a few days, and if he’s not allowed to enter, at least he can sleep in the back. Steve fiddles with the rear mirror, catching the way the back seats have been removed. The rest of the interior serves as an open space.
“Why couldn’t he figure out how to cure himself, then? Why? Why’d it have to be him?” Steve spat the words out, voice shaking with rage.
Morgan rushed awake with a cry. Peter, god, he looked like he aged five years in the last three days. Steve knew this kid, he put it on himself to take care of his siblings. Steve tried to offer an encouraging smile as Peter slid beside Morgan.
Tony flinched. There was an image swimming in the edges of his memory. Steve standing over him. The shield hitting his faceplate again and again until it cracked open.
He would never have that again. He sat with the memory, then shut the water, dried himself with awareness, making sure to towel his hair so the water wouldn’t get on the tiles. Tony had hated when Steve walked off, still dripping with water.
Steve stood by the windows observing New York wake up. Outside, a garbage truck made its way through through the streets, taking all the things people want out of their homes.
They just finished a short mission in Connecticut and were happy-drunk from victory. Not every mission was successful and those were the worst, especially when Tony would lock himself in the Compound’s workshop. Bad days were far and between. But maybe that’s just because Steve was happy. Married, loving life.
“Then, I’ll be happy to take it off your hands.” Steve opens the driver’s door and examines the interior. It smelled like stale cigarettes, but it was clean, nearly spotless minus the fading stickers on the dashboard.
Nevermind, you don’t want to hear it. Won't talk about it. Not when you can't be here to yell at me. No use in scrawling it on paper when I'd just rehash the event to myself.
The brownstone was located in the upper east side, near the Guggenheim. It was a renovated building from the 19th century, with a terrace on the ground floor, a spacious cellar, and four bedrooms on the top two floors. The rooftop was dreamy, but the best part of the entire house was the open space kitchen. He could picture them having the Avengers over for dinner. Tony will play mother hen and set the table while Steve popped open the wine. It’s too much space for just the two of them, but they didn’t say anything once Pepper handed them the paperwork.
Can I still call you that. After. Well. I haven’t written in a while. It’s been busy. I gave a speech to the suits the other day. Told them you fought and died against the Registration and if they tried to strip away my autonomy as Director of SHIELD, they'd be proving you right. I saw a couple of them smirk. Osborn rolled his eyes. How is he even there. Jesus.
Some moved away from town and into the mountains or the Capital, swearing that the returned were the work of the devil.
It was like opening the manila folder that contained information on "Anthony E. Stark '' as curated by SHIELD.
Warm all over, Steve wiped the sweat from his temple and grabbed a couple of tomatoes and cucumbers. He threw them into the basket hoping to make a mediterranean salad with dinner. Ever since Tony went into remission, they’ve changed their eating habits and Tony’s retired from using the suits unless absolutely necessary. Steve didn’t even let Natasha call Tony for backup and she never tried to persuade Steve otherwise.
Steve stayed silent. Instead of replying, he held Tony tighter, hoping that somehow, his fingers around his dying husband would stop his last breath from ever coming.
It’s only after a beat and Tony’s acknowledgement that Steve turns away. It’s terrifying to be here. In this space. Tony’s refuge. He feels like a trespasser now.
“I was being sarcastic...” Peter twisted his lips. “But no, it helps to talk to someone,” he added, pointedly.
Tony smelled like motor oil and something that burnt, but Steve didn’t care. His husband was finally back in bed with him.
Missions were going well. They haven’t had a mission as catastrophic as the Chitauri. Most missions were espionage which was more of Bucky and Natasha’s specialty. Sometimes they grudgingly worked with SHIELD on international issues. Other times, they offered their services and power for assisting with natural disasters and humanitarian efforts like hurricanes or earthquakes. Tony threw money on rebuilding cities with green energy, but he also helped on with on-site clean up as Iron Man. Sometimes they had the basic, local villain like Doom or Osborn.
“God, I want to hate you so bad. I can’t. I can’t — ” Steve curled his body, wrapping his arms around Tony’s back and neck, holding too tight, like he was afraid Tony would disappear. He’s crying. “I don’t know how I can keep
“We’re a happy ending, alright? Even if I’m gone. You still get your happy ending. Finish it for us, okay? Live a good life, Steve Rogers. I’ve
I am at a loss for words. Steve feeds me poison with these lies. He doesn’t understand why we came here.
Tony remembered thinking, she must have been in a lot of pain to make the leap. While desperation was present in her features, she was determined, as if this was all she had left to give.
When patience left him, he resorted to nailing his hand once again. This time he set the nails on his fingertips and in the between his knuckles.
Rhodes, Carol, Pepper, Bucky, and Natasha stepped into the brownstone’s living room with a mix of unconcerned and neutral expressions, but Steve wasn’t fooled. At least Sam wasn’t with them this time.
“Well, it’s not really important. But uh,” he scratched his head, spotting a crow hopping on near their feet. “Nat and Bucky are dating, I guess.”
“Well, why don’t you show me how grateful you are?” Tony smirked, rocking his hips against Steve’s as they kissed.
When he got out of ice, the SHIELD medical team showed him his x-rays. His lungs are pristine. He’s in good health. Everything is fine, perfect, even. But he wonders if he is nothing but his abilities these days. His utility to the world. If that’s what Captain America is — hero, teammate, friend, patriot — he doesn’t know who Steve Rogers is otherwise.
“I will,” Steve promised with a nod. He glanced at the sky, an endless blue, just like the day of the funeral. There’s nowhere else for him to go. “You wanna help me out with the garden?”
That’s what Steve wants. He’s not sure whether he’s jealous of her or not, but there’s an empty feeling in his chest, and he knows it's loneliness. It’s the fear of being forgotten and being left behind again. He’s nothing but an old relic in a new century. How is he supposed to inspire when there’s nothing but the hollow ghost of yesterday following him late into the night?
Now, his brain supplied him memories of being on opposing sides, tearing their team apart, destroying parts of the city in their hubris.
Tony’s close enough that their shoulders almost touch. Despite a couple of bumps, the sand is soft on their feet. The smell of salt and seaweed fill the air when they settle down near the shore. Tony leans on his hands and smiles up at Steve.
And now he’s here, knees bend and between Tony’s legs, looking up at him in admiration, almost like a shy whisper. Steve cups his jaw, scratches the lines of his goatee with a thick thumb. “I’m here, Tony.”
In quick strides, they’re in their bedroom, miraculously uncaught by Jarvis or any loitering Avenger. But, there’s not much of them here these days. At least, not their newly-minted New Avengers that fell into shambles in a matter of a few short weeks. Logan and Peter can’t smell them.
Extremis dumped data, confirming this was Steve Rogers. Flesh and blood. Tony wasn’t stuck in the labyrinth of his memories this time.
Tony doesn’t believe any of it, but he’s too weak to deny that Steve is here. Holding him, it’s everything he’s ever wanted.
Steve’s still learning parenting. His official claim to Morgan is by marriage, and sometimes he catches himself wondering if he’s overstepping by buying her everything she asks for and indulging every single one of her hobbies.
“But it’s dad’s favorite song,” Morgan protested, standing in between the record player and Steve with one hand on her hips.
Everyone died. People usually buried their parents. Steve borrowed money from an employer to pay for Sarah Roger's burial. It was life. The natural order of things. The worst part was that the world kept moving. It didn’t stop. It kept spinning.
Of course. He should learn to stop asking people for things they cannot give him. He wants nothing more than to push through.
“What is it with you, you can make these grand speeches while the world is ending, and you can’t say the simplest things?”
Steve sighs, no other choice bur to march on forward and get dressed there. With the towel wrapped around his waist, he walks out, only to catch Tony sitting up with the pillows piled on his back.
“We’re all getting tired of you two kissing all the time, you know. I wish Peter was here so he could web you two apart for just five seconds,” Morgan complains and crosses her arms.
“Is that it?” She turns back to him, and it’s so much like that time all those years ago back on their way to New Jersey. “I suppose running away could be about survival.”
“We can find a motel or a B&B for tonight,” Tony says. He doesn’t put his sunglasses back on. It seems stupid to do so now with the sun going down, but Steve’s always suspected it was just another one of Tony’s masks. The playboy persona, the Iron Man’s face plate, the sunglasses Tony Stark often wears… they’re all just masquerading in a world that’s blinded to the person inside.
He tears his eyes from the white plaster of the ceiling, glances at Steve. That ocean of blue. His ocean of blue. An ocean of trouble. He’s repeated this phase to Steve so many times before.  A quiet good morning, a murmured goodnight,
Rhodey and Carol come over. They both punch Steve in the arm, and just as he’s about to mock-frown at them, the door slams open, revealing Tony grumbling about damages to the War Machine suit, phone in hand, likely chatting with Peter Parker or his new ragtag mentees. As Tony walks to Steve for a kiss, Bucky and Sam enter from the side door, a pile of pizza between them.
There’s people like Iz and Augusto who offer their friendships easily. There’s the usual kids who run around town sticking their tongues at him. There’s little pockets of happiness that give evidence of their work as worth it.
Steve turns back to the side table and fills the glass to the brim. He returns to Tony and sets the glass right under his mouth, tilting Tony’s head upright with his other hand. “Come on, drink up.”
“You like that?” Steve pulls off, kissing Tony’s pubic bone. His face looks so open, like he’s pleased to be taking Tony apart.
“That’s true,” Steve said, solemn. He picked up Morgan from the counter and deposited her to the chair. They eat breakfast with Peter mumbling about school and programs. Harley teased Peter about a girl named MJ and Morgan complained about the lackluster breakfast selection, asking for a cheeseburger for dinner.
Soon they’ll both have to get up and start their nightly routine. Steve will climb up one side of the bed, and Tony will climb the other. He’ll be pulled close, and he’ll hold Tony in his arms and whisper their way of saying I love you.
“You think refusing to eat will do you any good? Tony, you’ll just hurt yourself.” He caresses Tony’s face like some cosmic joke.
He asked Tony before, if this was always the view from the sky, flying with the armor, and Tony answered,
He stares at Tony’s hole, adding a third finger, and suppresses a moan when Tony starts rocking back. How is Steve supposed to go on pretending this never happened, that he doesn’t know the sounds Tony makes when he’s begging for cock?
Some found Jessica Drew’s kindness unnerving. She used to bicker with the farmers and pickpocket travelers.
He keeps his own hands on his side and doesn’t step forward. Doesn’t walk the seven steps it would take to stand in front of Tony, pull him up, shake him, make him listen. Can’t he see — can’t he determine with that brilliant mind of his that Steve is trying. This is him attempting.
The sun was high up. Their bodies were slightly shaded by the veranda and the overgrown vines climbing up on the wooden structure.
“Fine.” Steve dropped a peck on Tony’s waiting lips. “Can I fuck you later? In that big mattress of yours? Or maybe suck you off while you tinker in the workshop? Will that do?”
Steve dropped beside Bucky and put his shield down. He removed the cowl and wiped his sweaty hair back. “Hey, Buck. I’m not sure what you want to do. If you want to just stay away from all this superhero stuff, I think Tony can get you a new identity after the rest of your triggers are removed.”
He woke up sweating with snot dripping from his nose. He was still on the floor. The room smelled so foul that he scrunched his nose and nearly gagged. It wasn't until he was in the bathroom looking at his reflection that he realized that the putrid smell was coming from him.
“And brainwashed him and made him their murder doll,” Tony finished, pulling away from Steve to read the rest of the files. “The script’s already written, and it’s a shitty-ass one at that. God. Fucking hell. How trite. They take Captain America’s bestfriend and turn him into a world-known assassin. What a plot.”
Steve’s mouth is open and his pupils are dilated. He’s keeping still, ceding to Tony’s control. For once.
“Alright?” Tony turned, eyeing the hand still on his shoulder. Steve squeeze it before stepping back.
“Because I saw you across that first day and you were lonely. As I was,” It says, cradling Tony’s face. They cannot kiss. Tony ignores the desire to hold this creature, keep him. “We studied the town. Relationships, kinfolk. And I don’t know, there was something about you that I liked. I saw the way he looked at you, and I wanted to know what that was like.”
“No shit, huh?” The man turns around, a glint in his eyes and watches Tony. “Thought he looked a little familiar. Also didn’t recognize him without the suit. What does he find himself here for?”
“Can you repeat that, please?” Steve swallowed down the anxiety and laced his fingers with Tony’s. Tony squeezed them hard.
No one dared to print a word of slander all knowing that Ms. Pepper Potts could scorch their careers until there wasn’t even ash as evidence. She also issued a statement asking photographers and journalists to respect Steve and the children by not taking any photographs of them in public for the foreseeable future.
Tony used to grill the tomatillos and the jalapenos until they were charred. Steve did the same, following the recipe by the dot. He blended the spices together and let the pork simmer for half the day. The entire brownstone smelled like the tang of peppers and cilantro. If he closed his eyes, he could pretend that it was Tony making dinner.
“Everything is good here.” Tony pushes off, and walks towards him only to turn to the dining room. He straightens the chairs, still not facing Steve.
“I got tired of waiting for you to make a move. So, as one innovative, genius, billionaire, reformed playboy once said, I know exactly what I'm doing.”
Steve cleared his throat, looking at the crow prancing around in the corner of his eyes. They’ve been working together as Avengers for a year and a half now. They’ve built the Compound together, brick by brick. Streamlined the potential new Avengers into the program by offering training and applications to interested superheroes.
“The first time’s hard enough, Pops. I don’t think he wanted us to see it again and again. We’d go insane.” Peter said.
“Iz is teaching me how to make herbal medicine from the yarrows and rose hips.” Steve places the eggs on a plate and re-heats the leftover potatoes on the pan.
Steve observed the empty pots stacked in the corner of the roof, packages of soil lining the east wall. “Where do you think I should start?” He couldn’t fathom where to begin. Even with his eidetic memory, he can’t remember what his life was like before Tony.
With what little energy he has left, Tony lifts his head and the muscles on his back overwork themselves and he wishes that Steve would just break his neck so he doesn’t have to go through this every night.
“Yes. It’s a lovely place,” Steve says, pressing a hand over his forehead to shade his eyes from the sun.
Mayor Danvers is in the middle of the circle. There’s a smather of green goo, blood perhaps, on her dress, and she’s got the remains of Rhodes, no, It, on her lap.
Steve grips his hips, steadying him. He lets Tony go with a slight warning and observes the mess on the floor. Steve’s eyes are wide, and he exhales heavily, still hard. He stands in front of Tony, just inches away, fisting his cock. Steve’s boots settle on the puddle, and he smiles, eyes focused on Tony as he twists the head of his cock. “You’re so gorgeous when you let go, Shellhead.”
Overcome with want, Steve grabs his ass, squeezes it, hard, then sets him down on the bench. They didn’t have time to work Tony open, but Steve gets down on his knees, opens Tony wider, and licks his shaft. He sucks the head, and when he looks up, it’s to see Tony’s heedy eyes, pupils wide and dark. His chest is flushed and he hands heavily. Steve works a tongue to swirl on the head, flicking his tongue over the slit before dropping down to put one of Tony’s balls inside his mouth.
They stood side by side watching the rest of their team and family loiter around the penthouse. The Christmas tree was huge. Fresh. Purchased from a farm upstate.
“I will clarify that with Ms. Potts, sir.” JARVIS paused for a beat, no doubt sending Pepper the message. “She said,
“Tell me, then, tell me, what it is,” Tony urged, catching the taste of his tears as they stream down his face. “Can we still fix this?”
Most times, he walks deep into the night, patrolling — there’s no other word for it. He walks city perimeters, checks roads without street lamps. Stops bar fights, ensuring that a group of rowdy teenagers make it home safe, prevents looting of corner shops. Just small things, no more superhero-level missions.
He’s wearing simple clothes. Not the ones that are stained with blood, grime, and mud. His hair is bright yellow, even paler under the sun.
Tony joked about making them all wear Iron Man suits, once, when he was in remission. Back then, death seemed like it’d never come. Steve was just ecstatic that they had more time—more birthdays, more holidays, more evenings under the New York sky.
At least there, I knew my time was finite. There would have been a bullet to my head after subjecting myself to medical prodings, to the experimentation, to interrogations about my biology.
I hate what we’ve become. I hate how I’m still angry. I hate that I can’t tell you when I’ll forgive you. I hate everything that’s happened. I hate how we’re here. Hating is tiring and I don’t have it in me to fight you anymore.” And for the first time, Tony thought that was unsteady, unknowable, because this was everything Tony’s wanted to hear, and how could Steve say this now. “I am furious, Tony. But when I close my eyes, I just see you in your armor and I don’t know if I would have stopped, if I would have dropped the shield if people didn’t stop me. I
I’ve had over four thousand hypotheses about you. Starting that day we found you in ice. Greatest day of my life, Steve. That’s the scientific method. Ask a question, establish a hypothesis based on preliminary observations. I can't get past the first step and I've given up on trying to understand. Categorize you. I found long ago that you defy any boxes. Maybe if I tried harder, I can boil you down to your atoms. Study you in a vacuum. I’m still trying.
Hank's right. My hands are dirty. Always. Again and again. I'm sorry. For you, Steve. For Janet. For everything. We’ve lost a lot.
“No,” Steve says easily with a smile. “You married me the day after I proposed. Ready to start a life with me. It’s everything I want.”
“I don’t know about that.” Steve shrugs. He wouldn’t know anything about being a good man. Once, perhaps, he might have believed the statement. But some people may never learn to forgive themselves.
Tony’s eyes are heavy-lidded with sleep. There’s a new freckle on his cheekbones. There are so many new lines surround his eyes now, and Steve tracks each one as a reminder that they’re both growing old together. When Steve looks at himself in the mirror, he sees new lines on his forehead. Creases on his cheeks. It pleases Steve every time he counts a new one.
His eyes always found Tony, in the suit, soaring in the sky. Tony, at home, in their bed, asleep. Tony talking to their kids. Tony, Tony, Tony.
Tony has had a glint in his eyes these last few weeks. Anytime Steve raises an eyebrow and probes him, he mime zips his mouth shut and turns away with a laugh, telling Steve that he’ll see soon enough.
“I can belong anywhere as long as it's beside you.” Tony straddled Steve’s thighs. He kissed Steve’s cheek with a loud smack. “I love you, Steve.”
It’s about bodies and being human, all too human. His heart was a decaying organ that he wanted to pry out and substitute with something more durable.
Instead, Steve stared at her furrowed brows. Her eyes were green, clear and unwavering. There’s no doubt that she was trying to be his anchor at the moment. He wondered if she was like Tony, who needed the darkness to utter what they couldn’t say in daylight.
A tongue flicks against his hole, and Steve’s diving in, stubbornly trying to milk another orgasm out of him. Tony sags as Steve clutches the back of his thighs, pulling his legs wider and wider apart.
“Bullshit. Captain America is here bullshitting us.” Aisha took her sunglasses off for the first time, her eyes were swollen and bloodshot. “You don’t believe that so don’t try to convince us with any of your speeches. You’ll never be whole again once half of you is buried, so please. Do
Tony shouted urgent orders to JARVIS to conserve power: reduce weapons capacities, cut all but emergency communication, anything to focus enough power on the thrusters to get them to land. Steve might be fine. His near bottomless energy reserves could be enough to help him swim towards the coast, but even with the emergency releases, the water was too frigid for Tony.
“Is that right?” Steve asks, resting his cheek against Tony’s shoulder. “I’m not surprised. This is where I fell in love with you.”
“Stop.” Steve’s mouth snaps shut, the muscle in his jaw straining as he grinds his teeth together. It must be killing him, and Tony curses the hope that curls in his stomach and nudges at the mockery of a heart behind the reactor.
Without even thinking, he thumbs some of the spend near Tony’s nipple and presses it into Tony’s mouth, chasing after it with his tongue.
Tony still didn’t stir but he was no longer panting, his breath coming easier with just Steve’s hands on his waist so Steve brushed his knuckles over the slope of Tony’s perfect, round ass and savoured the way gooseflesh rose over his skin.
Steve comes with a bitten off groan, eyelids flickering as he loses himself in the pleasure and digs his fingers into Tony’s scalp, holding him in place without choking him on Steve’s cock. Every muscle in Steve’s body goes tense as he thrusts stream after stream across the back of Tony’s tongue, down his throat as he swallows repeatedly, desperate to take it all if he can.
Steve pauses, searches his eyes for answers that he must find, because he leans back and takes his hand away, sadness dancing across his features. “I’m sorry.”
“Why don’t you throw on that super old movie, you know the one. A New Hope,” Tony teases from the kitchen island, sodas in hand as he tosses one towards the couch just to watch Peter’s reflexes as he shoves upward and off the sofa to pull the can out of the air.
“You’d love that though, wouldn’t you? You’d want them to watch, just so they all know you belong to me. Invite them into our damned bedroom if you could, just so they’d all see, hm?” Steve smiles to himself and the silence that greets him, knowing full well that Tony’s both a sucker for Steve talking filth to him at inopportune times, and his little fantasies of the rest of the team having to watch.
Steve is still getting it right a month later when Helen confirms what the other doctors have said; amputation is the best option. Tony had been prepared for it, but the word amputation still makes him wince and sit up marginally straighter, holding himself up with the sheer force of his pride. Even with the arm gone he’ll still have scars, hideous ones that span chest to back and have seared away at his face including some of the hair around his ear.
“My mates.” Steve rumbled in challenge, tipping him sideways and pressing him down into the blanket mound in a delicious display of ownership.
They’re plastered together chest to back, sweat dripping between them and Steve gasps, moans, damn well near cries.
“I’m sure Shuri will be able to arrange something for him, then.” Tony interrupts, because there is no way in hell he will ever go near that man or his damned robotic arm ever again. It’s not even about Barnes, not really. But he won’t.
The hard-won trust Steve had gained shifted into something else and at first, Steve had been shocked when Tony had proposed an… unorthodox solution to the sleep disturbances.
His eyes flicker across the newest memory. Steve is in the yard outside of Clint’s farmhouse, dripping with sweat and glistening, all bronzed god in the sun.
Steve’s whispering his name like a prayer, cracked and raw when his other hand comes up to clutch Tony’s wrist in a vice grip.
Steve presses his lips together and gives Tony a calculating look that makes him think he should have left New York hours ago when he’d had the chance. It wouldn’t take much to get up now and walk away from Steve, leave him sitting there with his overflowing barrel of self-pity and bitterness, but he doesn’t.
Steve paused, panting as he pressed his forehead against Tony’s thigh and tried to catch his breath. Tony could feel it too, the shadow of the feedback loop of pleasure they’d be missing this entire time.
Peter laughs and asks FRIDAY to cue it up. Before the movie starts playing, Peter hesitates. He glances at Tony, down into his lap, back up at Tony, to the can of soda on the table and back again.
“You think he won’t snap out of it all in a few months and think about all the time he’s wasted? All that he could have been doing if someone just… helped him along? Just gave him that push he needed to be okay again?”
Amy-Amanda smiled, gentle and understanding. “Alright, hurry along, it’s lasagna on the menu. And remember there’s group tonight. Maybe you’ll share something with us?”
Tony’s a mess really, or at least the parts of himself that he can see. Thick fingerprints litter his torso, darkest at the hips but spreading onto his belly and chest from when Steve had held him down and pounded into him from behind.
He doesn’t let Tony up for air until they’re forced to gasp into each other's mouth, trading kisses that turn into a wet smear of mouth against mouth. Steve picks up the pace, shoving into Tony with a singular purpose, and reaches between them to wrap a hand around Tony’s cock which slides between his slick fingers and brushes against the soft curl of Steve’s belly every few thrusts.
Here, he's nothing but a body providing Tony pleasure. That's it. Nothing more. Steve's just a fucktoy, invited to a couple's bed for the night.
It cannot be true. There should be scar tissue. Even if Strange is a self-proclaimed medical genius, there has to be evidence of the blunt force of a navy pistol. It’s Colt made, not Stark’s.
The restaurant is nearly empty. All the patrons are likely in bed, at home, with the family and friends they still have. But the place is open for another hour.
Steve watches his throat work, grateful that it’s dark and he has his legs bent so Tony can’t see his cock thicken. How he’s thought about this on dark, dreary nights in the desert. Tony Stark as his only salvation. Here he is, in the flesh, sitting beside Steve when he could be with anyone else. It’s a dream come true.
“I’m serious, baby. This is just a narrative arc, you’ll be okay. Just one of many. You have to live, Steve. I need you to be okay, Steve. Please.”
There are no photographs on the walls, not even an empty mug. There’s no difference between this room and the motels and hostels he’s stayed in the last couple of months. The last few years, really. There’s just the queen bed and its white sheets with two flat pillows and a floor lamp. All that’s missing is the bible inside the side table.
Earlier, they got called for back-up by the active Avengers and the Fantastic Four for some alien drama in Midtown. Tony had a seizure while in the suit, vomited inside the armor, and fell off a building. Fortunately, Sam was able to swoop in before too much internal damage was done.
“I know.” Steve pressed the ends of his fingers over his eye lids. He didn’t want to be like this. He didn’t want to cry anymore. He didn’t want to breakdown every time he entered the workshop. He wiped the stray tears on his jaw. “I miss him too.”
He notices how time has seemed to drift these last few years. For a man suspended in animation for seventy years,  time is an odd feeling. A heavy emotion, not Time as in minutes passing, but an abstract construct he has no means of fully understanding. Maybe it’s an experience? Steve doesn’t really understand it. All he knows is he thought he was dying, then he woke up again. This time, to a new world, a new life, a place he’s still struggling to belong to.
“You’re being very brave.” Steve smiles, hoping to distract the kid as Tony dabs the cut with pads of alcohol. It’s not deep, just a small surface cut, but it’s best to be cautious. For Steve, this might have resulted in an infection back in the day.
Tony would like to tear it from his hands, break it, bend it, stomp on it, burn it until nothing is left. Maybe throw it to the hog and watch the pigs eat through the metal.
Tony had more clothes than him, hence, the extra large walk-in closet. The cupboards holding Tony’s shoes and briefcases are now empty. There was too much space. Too much empty space. Too much.
“You, I just want you, Steve,” Tony tries the words out, blinking quickly because his eyes sting and there’s this loss deep in the cavities of his chest, an ache that hurts more than their fight from earlier. More than Steve pinning him on the Mansion’s ruins, fist up in the air, breathing heavily as Tony spits on his face. “I don’t care how.”
You’re right, Steve. Sometimes people in power find it hard to listen, even if they’re presented evidence on what is
He wipes his forehead with the end of his shirt and drops down to the patch of grass. Across from him, there’s a jasmine tree partially in bloom. Its flowers growing, but there’s segments of just empty branches. It’s a deep white color, and there’s no doubt that if Steve didn’t have the serum, he’d be coughing and dry heaving from the pollen. Beside it, there’s a fallen log with a blue bird hopping the bark before flying off.
He walks towards Tony at the end of the dock, eyes flicking on their friends and family. Peter and Johnny are in matching suits, ties skewed, face flushed.
“But Dr. Lisk said that there were gaps in your memory. That your 'back-up' was formed before—" Steve swallowed and looked away. “Before the war.”
The first photo is of Tigra’s mutilated body. Her torso is cut in half. Her intestines spill out, a dark shade of red pools out to coat the debris on the concrete. Her tail has been roughly cut off, tied to her neck like a bow-tie, its end stuff into her gaping mouth.
Christmas Eve dinners at the Tower had grown exponentially in the past decade. Whereas Tony and Steve used to keep it amongst the original Avengers during their tenure as superheroes, now the Tower’s dining table had to be enlarged at least three times its size. Tony had a fit about the New Avengers, retired Avengers, and their family coming all together for the holidays. The man loved to hold court and pretend he was disgruntled.
Steve tilts his head again, again, again. It’s a favorite, and Tony’s always liked Steve taking command. Steve kisses him, cups his chin with his thumb and forefinger, and traces the line of Tony’s lips with his tongue. His body responses to Steve’s touch, the flick off his nipples, the heavy touch of Steve’s hands on his lower back. Tony closes his eyes, embracing Steve.
“What the hell are you both on?” Tony throws up a hand, but pads to mount his horse. “Ben Parker died last year.”
There’s a figure walking towards them. Four, to be exact. One is walking backwards, gesturing wildly with their hands. The other is skipping and laughing, long hair blowing against the wind. He registers that Bruce is at the edge, hands in his jacket’s pocket, a sheepish, distracted smile on his face.
Scott and Hope were in the living room with Cassie, chatting about some television show they have all started watching. Steve spotted Clint and Laura with their now adult daughter, Lila, out in the roof top garden having beers with Rhodes.
“Activating rooftop shields for blackout mode, Captain Rogers.” JARVIS announced, sounding hesitant like he’s disrupting something important.
I wonder these days whether I keep searching for a future already made. A peace that can never be, no matter how much of myself I sell out to get that. I still stand by what I said. I do what I think is best, Steve. So do you, I know. I know. I know. Maybe it’s true. Love, life, peace, it can’t be. The cat’s in the cradle, they say.
Everything will be fine. I’m still committed. Wipe myself clean, even though I’ll never forgive myself. For everything I’ve done. I won’t remember it. That’s death, it must be that. We’re only alive as long as we’re remembered, aren’t we? Personality, memories, feelings. Is that what makes us human, Steve? It might not be enough. Not without empathy. Not without guilt.
He licks at Tony’s ass, and a very far away part of him thinks it feels good. He’s grateful, because this is a different type of punishment. Steve isn’t fucking into him without prep, or working his hole without lube. Isn’t making his fucktoy of a hole bleed anymore.
His fingers follow the circular pattern of the arc reactor, then the spidery lines on its edges. It looked like the sun—and if that wasn’t a perfect metaphor for how Steve orbited around Tony.
The sun beamed high and the scent of their come mixed with the smell of the flowers and herbs in the garden. He turned to Tony, amazed at his strength—that they have a life together. He was like a garden nymph. Dark haired, bright-eyed, and beautiful.
Tony returned the smile, affectionate. He grabbed Steve’s left ankle, kissed the soft jut of his bone, and hoisted it up to his shoulder before sliding back inside.
“Husband needs to pry me from the workshop then.” Tony squeezed Steve’s fingers and begged for coffee. “Once this project for SI is approved, then I’ll be back in bed stealing your blankets, baby. Now, coffee! Please, darling?”
“Hawkeye?” Steve asks, wondering where Clint was too. They hadn’t seen each other since the Raft. Steve didn’t keep track of his surviving team mates in the weeks they returned to the Compound.
“They can be. We just have to hope.” Steve brought their laced fingers to his lips and gave their wedding rings a kiss.
There’s Clint and his own family just on the other side. He nods at Steve, pleased, and he can’t help but wonder what Natasha would say if she was here, if she would stand beside him or prefer to sit beside Clint. He wonders what she would wear and if she would match with Morgan.
Steve’s heart stuttered, and he glanced away because Tony’s eyes were too revealing, too tempting, and Steve had no time for that now.
They dried themselves, chatting idly about the mission. Steve wrapped a towel on his hips, admiring Tony’s fucked out expression.
On their way back to the hotel, a woman asks for help in grabbing her fallen groceries, a young child falls off his bike, and a man’s car stops working in the middle of the road. The woman’s apples are easily picked up, and Steve runs into the nearest mart to acquire a paper bag.
But Steve wants this face in perfect condition. No matter how many times he places his fist on it or how he punches me until the ring leaves a dent, Steve always patches me up.
He settled in, got comfortable, and let the grief wash over him. In the mirror, Steve observed the lines on his forehead, the curl of his lips. He has aged in the three years without Tony. His hair was lighter due to the gardening under the sun. There was a freckle on the tip of his nose and he suspected that Tony would kiss it if he was alive.
Steve thanks her, already noting how much time left he has to eat. Perhaps, less than an hour. Then he’ll hop on the train that’ll take him out to the ports.
Steve stares. He doesn’t know what to do. He didn’t expect this—he thought—well—he thought he'd meet Tony Stark, they’d have a walk around the beach, talk about their respective lives. Then, maybe they’d grab a bite and Steve would tell Tony about his time in the Army. Then, maybe Tony might open up about his parent’s untimely death last year. Steve would ask, “How are you holding up? Is there anyone to support you?” But he wouldn’t say,
Steve tries to smile in thanks. It turns genuine as he watches Tony pour Bruce a cup of coffee. Their eyes meet. There’s still that residual grin on Tony’s face, and it softens as he holds Steve’s gaze.
With a bottle of whiskey, he's had the courage to sing the song at the top of his lungs, hoping like hell Steve would pay attention. The dames have told him, and damn, doesn't feel like a century ago, that he had a nice baritone voice. Yeah, yeah, Starks are genius and excel at most of the arts, be it mathematics or literature. His mother, a governess before her marriage to the late Howard Stark, taught him well.
He stares at the badge, hating the way he sees himself reflected in the star of it. Recalling the way Steve would set it down primly on his desk before unlocking the cell to fuck Tony’s face.
He thinks back to dropping the shield and prying the red and blue out of his suit, as if he could strip off Captain America from his memories.
“What can I say? Deflection and distraction works wonders.” Tony punched him lightly, pouting. He was damn handsome with a suit, but Steve preferred this: Tony Stark in sweats with mused hair, goatee needing trimming to keep the lines precise. “I’m a bad man, Steve, you should know that by now. Merchant of Death, they called me.”
“Really? From here it looks like you want to punch me. Come on, Steve. Do it. No one will say a word. This is a discreet hotel made for those with surnames backed by money. Even if they can’t serve me alcohol, they won’t say a thing about screams that come from closed doors. I deserve it."
But as always, Friday mornings means a thick slab of butter melting on freshly made French Toast. Iz’s recipe includes Dutch Honey drizzled over the dish. Sugar, cream, butter, and a dash of vanilla.
“Ugh, just get over here.” Tony waves him over and points to the empty seat beside Peter. “Eat. And for your information, honeybear, I do not garden, I sit here and look pretty twirling a glass of juice while my husband does all the work.”
Steve’s saving the suits for Peter and Harley if they ever want it. He opened the drawer and ran a finger over Tony’s hoard of watches and sunglasses. Steve sighed. He’ll save that drawer for another day. Maybe Peter could help him and choose which ones he’d like to keep.
“You know, you make really good waffles, Steve. That thing you do to make it all fluffy, I could never get that right.” He kissed Steve. “Breakfast?”
Steve bites back the words, resisting the temptation to pretend that he doesn’t have to walk away after coming, doesn’t have to return to an empty bed, alone with the smell of Tony, the taste of Tony on his lips.
He’s put on more muscles, and for a moment, Steve’s mind drifts back to Tony in a wheelchair, IV by his side because Steve insisted that he join the debrief to get as much information on Thanos as possible. Because Steve had other priorities, and no matter how much he wanted to make Tony rest, such desires were outweighed by the need of desperate victory.
“You mean it?” He squats down and faces Morgan. He reaches for her, running a hand through her thick hair.
“I had a bad day,” Steve says, frowning, and until now, Tony wants the curve of his lips to be inverted into a smile.
“You’re hiding.” Steve grasps Tony’s hand and pulls him into the workshop and to the upstairs flat. Steve struts up the steps with the confidence Tony doesn’t feel.
“OK, this isn’t an interrogation,” Tony says, pushing Kate and Riri towards Natasha. “And if it is, ask Ms. Romanoff for some tips. You both could use some subtly.”
Steve sighs and pitches Tony’s side. “I made it as fancy as I could to fit your taste. It’s an outdoor shower, not an outhouse. I know what an outhouse is,” Steve replies, shuttering at the memory of his time in the army. “You, sir, do not.”
“Go on, give him a lick.” She scoots forward, squeezing one of Tony’s cheeks, and pulls it to the side. She tips her three fingers in, humming as Tony’s glistening hole flutters. Rumiko fucks her fingers in, twisting and turning with expert movement. Belatedly, Steve realizes she knows Tony’s body in a way Steve has only ever hoped to understand. She adds a fourth finger, hushing Tony. Her hands are smaller compared to Steve, but Tony takes it with a sense of familiarity, hole expanding against her knuckles. “You like that, baby? Feels good? I’m making you feel good?” She turns to Steve, pulling her fingers out and licking them clean. “You should have a taste. Go on, you’ll love it.”
Steve feels seen. He didn’t think it would be like this. Steve really imagined their first meeting to be much more romantic, not trying to stop some guy from drugging Tony.
Steve watches them fondly. Bucky and Tony had a special friendship he’ll never understand. He’ll always live on the outskirts of it. What they did together in the shop belonged to them, but they had the ritual of shaking each other’s hand as hard as possible in order to determine their respective arm’s strength.
Tony held his gaze. The fire in him seemed to evaporate. A surprised expression passed across his face and he seemed to decide something. “Steve.” He raised a hand, then set it back down.
Tony takes the spoon from him and blows. He eats, forcing himself to swallow it down. His throat is hot, and there’s a certain rawness that warm food cannot assuage.
He wished he had scars on his back and abdomen to prove that Tony used to run his hands all over Steve, clawing at his back when they fucked.
He’s imagined those words, all the filthy things Steve tells him now, for years. But never like this.
He runs and runs, throws the shield out by the edges of the forest, then jumps after it. He runs until his quads burn enough that he could ignore the ache on his chest.
“What? Overbearing?” That’s what Harley’s taken to calling him. Peter would twist his lips into a frown and scratch his head. At least Morgan just took it in stride when Steve double checked that she had her phone, that her temperature was normal, that they were healthy. “Be an asshole to my friends who are just trying to help? I know, I see it all. Sorry. I just don’t know… how to…It’s hard to do this. It’s difficult to live, Nat. It really is.”
“Hmmm, I do like coming to the sight of you and the lake, but you made this for me, so,” he says, as if that’s explanation enough.
He arranges Tony to the settee, then grabs a soup bowl, whistling the entire time, like he’s slipping into character.
“It’s cute.” Morgan smiled, reaching for Tony’s hand. She squeezed it tight, three times, laughing as their fingers collapsed on each other.
There isn't a winter. Nevermind that he's only been here for five weeks. Summer is endless, but it's not like the blistering humidity of the East Coast in August. Los Angeles has a different life blood. It's multicultural, like New York, but the enclaves and villages are all spread out, unlike Manhattan, where you can walk two blocks and be in Harlem then in Morningside Heights.
Tony’s still trying to convince Rhodes to join the team. But so far, they had Sam Wilson, a friend from DC, joining them for aerial support. Bucky was recently cleared to join the team.
Tony turns his head, glaring at Steve but pushing back against Steve’s hips. “What are you thinking about now, huh?”
Steve tried to listen. He can’t see anything but Tony in the hospital gown, face exhausted from the battle, body battered from the fall.
He doesn’t remember when he last had a meal. He threw Its beans away. Put the iced tea down the drain.
He settles closer to Steve, lining their bodies together, then he’s whispering up to Steve, and takes what’s his. “Goodnight, sweetheart.”
I laugh. Steve is so determined, so earnest in his beliefs, yet he’s the one that keeps lying to himself.
“When you live, when you’re the one who has to bury the body and go on with your life, you’re at the mercy of grief. And it just goes on, and on, and on, Peter.”
“It’s been a beautiful fight.” She quirked her lips for a fleeting moment then walked them forward. “Still is. That’s Bukowski for you.”
There's nothing else to worry about except the car in front of him and the one in the rear view mirror. He doesn't have to succumb to failure or fight with anyone. All he has to do is control his grip, keep a foot on the petal, and drive. Steve can just be.
They get married in the fall, just as Tony suggested months ago. Surprisingly, no one tries to stop them. He half expected someone to pull Tony aside and call him crazy for remarrying, and at that, a man who’s betrayed him, hurt him, and loved him all the same. But no one did. Instead, all their friends smiled, muttered under their breathes,
“Sorry.” Tony frowns, looks away again. There’s a tremble to the way he holds his body tight against the chair. “I really am.”
Somehow, they’re all clear. No one cares anymore. The rest of the world is too busy rebuilding. There’s no time for dried out superheroes who failed.
“Steve,” she choked out. Steve turned, catching her eyes both hard and filled with tears to the brim. “Move over, let me help you. Come on.”
He walks out of  his new workshop and sits on the porch, and imagines Steve patrolling the streets, feeding his skinny horse, making talk with a merchant about their crops. If Tony squints, he can see Steve lingering beside him, smelling musky under the sun.
“What,” he says because Tony’s standing on the edge of the dock with a suit and Rhodes is beside him, followed by Carol. Bruce Banner is there too, and he’s waving at Steve, beckoning them all forward.
There was once a time when he wanted this in the safety of their home, if not in the tatters of their decaying friendship.
“Reminds me of dad.” Morgan fingered the stone, letting it flash red against the fluorescence of the light.
“Yeah.” Steve coughed. His son was much more adjusted than him. “You’re right about that. I uh, learned in a group that. Grief is part of love. Love is worth it. I’m trying here, alright? I’m still trying to come to terms with that.
Belatedly, he realizes he’s sobbing. Snot drips down his chin, and he feels nothing but shame at the man he’s become: thin and starved and weak to even fight back.
He turned to Bucky who was squatting on the far side of the field. He was staring at Tony like a ghost.
Erskine, soft-spoken and meticulous, hangs around Savage Mountain because the common folk at Timely confuse his worldly curiosity with being a mad hack. Tony still isn’t sold on the medical experiment that saved Steve’s life. But one is told they cannot bite the fingers that feed their mouths.
He’s got his mouth full of cock, he’s taking it so deep, he’s nearly choking, but when he tries to pull off to address the intruders, Tony tugs at Steve’s hair with his prosthetic arm. It’s strong enough to keep Steve in place.
Steve pressed forward, pushing inside. He didn’t stop until he was fully seated. Then like being in the battlefield, they worked together. Tony pushed out, squeezing his hole as Steve pulled away.
The world turned and Steve’s life tilted. Grief was such a powerful reminder of life’s fragility. Even as the serum continued to circulate in his veins, Steve was mortal just like everyone else. He has known loss, all his life, but this was the first time the foundations of his personhood shattered. There’d be no rebuilding, not when half of his world was gone.
The door rings open and close. The barkeeper nods and continues washing down the bar. Outside, there’s the sound of critters crawling through the night. Late February has always been chilly, especially with the winds coming from up north.
But Steve doesn’t ask. Instead he says, “ok, ok,” like a broken record. They stare at each other from across the table, daring the other to move first. Steve hedges closer, leads both of his arms across table. “Let’s eat.”
Steve was helpless to watch Tony wince and adjust himself in a more comfortable position. He was throwing up the previous evening. Steve should have been more vigilant. They thought Tony had a reaction to last night’s take out. God, there were so many moments Steve should have checked on Tony. But everything seemed so normal.
“And we have the certificate to prove it!” Tony spun them around the room, once, twice, before settling on a slow rock on the balls of his feet.
A song he didn’t listen to anymore. Steve told the kids to turn it off once he heard the first three keys. “Now, Peter. Please.”
You asked me a question at the end of it. You know. You, in a cell, screaming out a question I couldn’t answer at that moment. I couldn’t take off the helmet because you’ve always read me too well. You’d try something. You’d see me. Couldn’t have that. Sometimes I hate that you can do that. Read me is as easy as you throw the shield. But if that’s true, why couldn’t you understand. You know me. I know you. Half my adult life, Steve. That has to mean something. Right. I thought. Well.
He pulls away just a few inches to kiss the space under my eyes. “Good morning, Tony,” he says, voice wistful.
Steve turned, seeing the snow fall in the window. There was a snow storm during the battle. But Iron Man’s suit shone bright against all the white—ruby reds and beaming yellows.
Steve responds well to it. He pulls me to his chest, kisses the top of my head, and dotes on me. He apologizes for holding the shield above my head.
They’d stood on the balcony overlooking the street walkers. All of New York, full of life—and then, there was Steve Rogers, Captain America, dying inside by the second as Tony had confessed, “She said she was hopelessly in love with me. I never knew it could be like this, Steve.”
Steve felt the rage bubbling over, he leaned forward, trying to restrain himself from lashing out. Pepper’s heard the worst of his comebacks. She didn’t deserve his scathing remarks.
“Someone should look after him,” he replies, falling on parade rest. He wants to storm into the house and make sure Tony’s alright, cared for. “Not a cop. Ex-military.”
That’s the thing with Steve Rogers, once he has something that’s his, he’ll sink his claws in and refuse to let go. He’s never had much. Now, he has someone — people — to call his family.
It’s just any other day. Steve had to live. He had to move on. It would get easier, he hoped. It was a flat-out lie that the living liked to believe.
There’s a burning in his lungs kin to smoking, but there’s no nicotine rush to follow this time. The air of the room is suddenly heavy now, and Steve wonders how they can go from a brisk walk, talking about nothing but the layout of the town and its people, to being here, surrounded by no one else but each other.
Maybe he likes driving because there’s always movement. Even if he’s just sitting in this car, ashamed at living in his own skin. In the road, there’s always direction, somewhere to go, a place to run to.
Steve licked the head, making his way down the shaft. He sucked with ease, hot as hell that they were doing this in a semi-public place, even though they couldn’t be seen since Tony raised the invisible fortress. The rest of the city would just see this afternoon’s image of the garden. They’d have no idea that Steve was sucking Tony’s dick and looking forward to fucking his ass on it.
Steve shoved a hand to his mouth and bit hard on his knuckles until he tasted blood on his mouth. “Alright, alright. Tony, baby, alright.” He returned to the sofa, breathing hard, trying to calm his racing heart.
He’s doing all this wrong. He’s missing steps. It’s barely noon, and they are on the verge of a row if he doesn’t thread carefully.
Steve’s insides twisted up. He wasn’t sure how much of Bucky was still there in the programming. Natasha has warned that “Bucky” may no longer exist and went as far as to note that Bucky died when he fell from the train. He’s been HYDRA’s guard dog for seventy years. But Steve couldn’t give up on him.
Words fail him, so he stays silent. Tony is just a few feet away from him. He reaches past Steve without a word, and pulls the trunk open, settles his bag beside Steve’s shield.
Back inside, Tony rushes to his bed, grabs a set of clothes, then slams the door shut like a decision made final. Steve wishes he could pry the door open, pull Tony into his arms, make him understand that Steve is truly happy for him, only he doesn’t understand the way his heartstrings are kept taunt, ready to splinter.
“Ah.” She nods in understanding, and its rather awkward even though Steve has been asked the same question nearly every other day. Maybe he never learned to school his features as unaffected. Maybe grief and the last decade is still etched on his face. “Disappeared,” she adds, voice trailing down as if it’s a question.
Steve returned to the room, ignoring the empty bed frame. He’d get a new bed delivered later today and recycle the old one. It won’t smell like Tony. The mattress in the hall no longer carried Tony’s scent, but Steve liked to imagine that there were still remnants of Tony, on there, somewhere. But he will have to move on, for his own sake and as a way to honor his promise.
“I’m so sorry, darling. I’m so sorry.” Steve hiccuped, wishing that Tony was beside him to comfort their daughter.
“What are you offering?” Steve started at the red tint on Tony’s cheeks. Tony was blushing because of him.
Tony’s favorite work table was untouched, still a mess of mugs, notes, and tools. On the middle of it was the helmet of the last Iron Man suit he worked on. Steve bit his lip and dragged his gaze back to the kids.
Tony was going to be sick. He was already sick. They all said that Steve came to Broxton, but he didn’t stay to see Tony awake.
“It wouldn't bother me. I'm an asshole. I wouldn't give a fuck. I'd walk away. I don't give a shit, you hear that? I live my life every goddamn day without him. He's buried. Six feet under. So what do I give a shit about you, the person I’ve been fucking for three months? Nothing.” Aisha shook her head.
He nods his agreement and bumps their shoulders. They stay quiet. Steve has too much to say, too much to tell her, and if he starts now, he won’t stop, and if he continues digging for memories, he might not leave. So, he leans forward, watching the trio with solemn eyes.
Along the walls are mail Steve received during his tenure as Captain America. There’s a series of drawings from kids, likely in elementary school at the time the pictures were sent, featuring the shield, Captain America and Iron Man, the rest of the Avengers, line art of New York City.
Steve splutters, trying to go against Bucky’s firm hold, but it’s insistent and unyielding. “Buck, I gotta go feed the chickens and the horses.”
It’s different now. He knows this, but he can’t stop finding all the places where his life and the world are upside down. It’s like walking down a fun house mirror. Is the world distorted, or is it just his own perspective?
Steve pinched the bridge of his nose then stared him down. “You don’t get to die. You’re going to stop drinking,” he said, each word rang like a threat.
Sometimes, Tony would be on SI business across the globe and return home with several vinyls. Then, he’d put it on the record player and sway with Steve. He laughed and joked every time Steve stepped on his toes. Even after almost two decades together,  Steve never learned how to dance. He was content on following Tony’s steps, drifting around the room with hands on each other’s waist.
“Wow.” Morgan ripped the wrapping and started at the necklace in awe. She held it up for them and they all chimed happy sounds.
Steve trained me on what he likes: a tight fist on the base of his cock and small licks to his slit. Sometimes, he enjoys my teeth lightly scraping his shaft.
. He bites his lips and focuses his efforts on scissoring Tony open, prodding and poking until he finds that sweet spot. Steve rubs it over and over just for the joy of hearing Tony’s response. He’s pleading now, saying he wants to come, promising he’ll be good, and Steve imagines that Tony knows it’s him doing this—knows it’s
“I’m on my way to the greenhouse, if you want to come,” he says, pointing at the cottage-like structure down the road.
All Tony feels is heat blooming from his cheeks to his nape, quickly followed by a sharp cold that makes its way to his belly and toes.
People walk, and walk, and walk. With family, with friends, with their dogs. This is how normal people live.
Tony kicked at Steve’s back and began fucking himself on Steve’s cock. Determined, Tony sunk on Steve’s cock, using the wall and Steve’s own body to piston himself up and down.
God, Steve was falling apart and his kids were the one taking care of him. They’re so young, they needed to be protected from this—Steve was the one who was supposed to check on them, make sure they got enough to eat, that they were sleeping alright. He was the one who was supposed to take them to their doctors appointments, to soccer games, make sure they did their homework.
Once again, autumn will bleed into winter and the cold will freeze the lake. They pull the canoe from the dock to enjoy these last fall days, when the water is still warm enough for a swim.
Steve dropped his ring beside Tony’s in the cabinet. There’s a soft click, then he swung the little door shut. He observed himself in the mirror once more and forced himself to smile. Steve took two fingers and pulled at his cheeks. He looked awful with pasty red cheeks and his face felt tight. But he maneuvered his fingers to make himself smile. He could do this. It’s a close mimicry for now.
Fuck the serum for taking that away. In the mirror, his body was pristine. He’s aged. Steve was in his late-forties now, biologically. There were crows feet on his eyes. Tony loved to kiss them. He said, “Steve, you’re aging, you’re human, we’ll grow old together.”
Walking the streets is like being flayed open, his edges rubbing against each other as Steve remembers the team’s first mission as Avengers together years ago. He wasn’t stateside when Thanos’ army attacked and Tony went to space. He only saw the crater the alien army left in Fifth Ave through the papers.
Steve had decided on something because he was nodding and shifting forward, and this was Steve at his most dangerous, when he was earnest to a fault. When he’d decided on something, he’d follow through, everything else be damned. “I’m here because I lo— ”
The sun glares down at them. Tony sweats, and it must just be whiskey and coffee. He is parched. He presses on his hand and the flask appears from his sleeve. He takes a swing, savoring the taste of Wolverine’s finest on his tongue.
Pepper didn’t know a single thing, who cared if she was one of the smartest women in the world. “None of you know the half of it.”
Steve said, and Tony couldn’t determine whether Steve was commanding or begging. “I just want you to be alright.”
The waters in the Hudson were clear. Again and again, he heard of all these “positive” outcomes of the Decimation. Fresh water and ecological impacts. Optimists broadcasted these facts every morning alongside pictures of the new world.
“Here I am.” Steve heaves a half sigh, half broken laugh. “Here. Thank you. Just, thank you, for everything. For sharing this life with me. Your kid.”
She wrapped her arms around his shoulder and like so many times throughout the year, he bit his lip and tried not to call her Tony.
Tony does what he wants because it’s just for tonight. He forces smiles and turns to face Steve. “Yeah,” he cards a hand on Steve’s already mused hair, settles it on his shoulder, and they walk back to their bed room, steps in sync. Hand in hand.
Tony waited. He took the television set apart, again and again. He strode across the room and read the week old paper with crusty eyes.
I insist on making this better. I’m not backing down. So, I’m here to tell you that even though I’m livid and disappointed, and sometimes I don’t want to see you, I still care. I’m not giving up on you. I know you’ve been here the last week. I was the one that sent Carol.”
“Hey, Manchurian Candidate, have you ever had Mexican food?” Tony grunted, face twisting in pain. “I’m starved. I’ll have to call in advance to make sure they’ve got enough food for two super-soldiers though.”
Peter and Harley preferred late evenings in the lab with Tony, exchanging notes and ideas. Steve’s taken to sitting on the workshop sofa with Morgan on his lap—the two of them sketching the lab’s robots and their boys.
He stayed there until his body stopped shaking and the sobs subsided. The serum was supposed to keep him at optimal condition.
Steve pulses, coming hard at the sound of Tony’s breathy voice. He lets himself ride the wave. Gravity pulls him down. He kisses the side of Tony’s face, his jaw, his temple, his eyelids. Tony soothes his back, rubbing circles from his traps to his delts. He’s humming, purring even, telling Steve that he’s all filled and it feels so good to have come inside him.
I’ve been thinking about Baldwin again: “To defend oneself against a fear is simply to insure that one will, one day, be conquered by it; fears must be faced.” You quoted Mark fucking Twain, so let me give you Baldwin, alright.
The open space of the Compound allows him to see the photographs of Tony, Riri, and Kate hanging in the next room over. Beside it, the walls are lined with bookshelves, and there, serving as a book end, is a photograph of all of them from Before. In that small patch of time in the Tower.
“There’s also someone who calls himself the Daredevil, now,” Rhodes says. “Well, you got Lang in the West. Ever think of having a West Coast Avengers?”
“I’ll never figure you out, Tony Stark.” Steve grinned, bumping their shoulders again. It was friendly, no big deal. He was really happy that Tony’s his teammate, friend.
Steve was sobbing. Tony felt drunk with power for a brief moment, and then he was crying, too. He pawed at Steve’s chest, wrapping his arms around him and pulling him as close as possible.
He points up at the sky, tracing the lines from one point to another. “That’s Cassiopeia, and there we have the Dippers.”
The next time he woke up, someone was prying the balcony doors open. A quick snap of the wrist and the handle broke. Carol stepped inside, body framed by the setting sun.
“Harley,” Steve wiped the sting from his eyes, but the fat lot of tears rolled down his cheeks anyway.
Tony refuses to call it an outhouse, claiming that it brings him flashbacks from summer camp. Steve knows for a fact that Tony's never been to summer camp, much less use an outhouse. Even in their trips to Yosemite, he still refuses to bathe in the lake. Steve recalls Tony renting a cabin in Yosemite's Upper Pines campgrounds just to access the private showers.
The woman on Tony’s left makes another line and wipes her nose. She dances around them. But Tony’s content on just rocking to the beat on the stereos. He’s turning to Stone and pulling him for a messy kiss. They make out. Steve wants to look away, but he can’t because it’s Tony. Steve’s seen Stone fuck Tony many times, it’s seared into his brain. But this is different; it’s happening in real time and Steve can see Tony in the flesh, watch his throat work and the way his t-shirt pulls on his chest. Steve is breathless. He drowns his beer and stays in the corner watching them like a fool.
When you’re hurting, you hurt people who want you to be better. Shove them away so they don’t see that there’s nowhere else to go but downhill.
“I assure you, sir,” Steve interrupts with what he hopes is a placating smile, “he’s the best mechanic I’ve ever met.”
He entered the bedroom and found Steve sitting on the edge of the tub, testing the water’s temperature. Steve’s hair was still damp, but in disarray, as if he’d been running his hands through them. He was barefoot, dressed only in his shirt and jeans.
The words come out in a quiet rush, but Steve hears it all the same. There’s a roaring in his ears, so overwhelming that he almost stops the car right then and there, in the middle of the highway.
He’s learning to forgive himself. It’s hard work, living with yourself and your grief everyday. But here he is, and as if to remind himself of undeserved second chances, he replaces his finger with his mouth and kisses the jagged line of Tony’s shoulder.
But it wasn’t because Steve’s heart broke at the sight of Peter sitting on Tony’s chair. It's awful to be the one who survived to deal with the loss. The dead? They don't have to deal with that.
“Alright,” Steve looked at the clock hanging from the mantel in the living room area. “Time for school.”
Steve swallowed, took the sponge and scrubbed his torso and the back of his legs. He recalled how Tony used to get on his knees and tell Steve to put his hands on the shower walls. He had complained about the shower tiles digging onto his knees and how he wasn’t as spry as Steve. Then, Tony had taken the shower sponge and scrubbed the back of his thighs, teasing Steve by caressing his ass, before dutifully soaping the rest of Steve’s body. After Steve was clean of soap, Tony kissed his shoulder then passed the sponge to Steve.
Tony made a disgruntled sound, sitting forward and settling his legs on the coffee table. “Well, I guess I was up anyway.”
The next time he opens them, the only heartbeat in the room is his own. Alone again. Naturally. He swings his feet to the floor. He’s nearly in tears, and then, two tiny beads drip down his cheeks. He wipes them quickly, frustrated.
“They’re out there training. Tony says it’s all about routine and moving.” Natasha stops, puts a hand to shade her eyes. “Sometimes I think he hates me for sitting in that goddamn office.”
He never told Steve the story of the woman with the fur coat and how he had to explain the scene to the police officers. Tony decided he’d tell Steve someday, not now.
Tony closes his eyes, breathes through his nose, loosens his jaw and lets Steve use his mouth like the whore he is.
Steve glanced at the set of carnations lining the wall. He was remiss on tending them because it hurt too much to be reminded of plucking them for Tony.
Tony stares at him for a moment, then laughs. “Shit. Did someone send you to look after me? Because I swear, I won’t drive drunk, I’ll find a place to crash or get a cab to drop me off to Malibu. My place isn’t too far.” He says the last line with a suggestive quality, but maybe Steve is just reading into things.
Tony’s parched and his lips are cracked. From dehydration or his mouth being fucked open last night, he doesn’t know.
“I think this is my new favorite spot to get laid.” Tony reaches for the wash cloth and gives it to Steve. With an eye roll, he lathers up soap and begins scrubbing Tony’s back, taking extra care to tenderly wash the space between his cheeks.
Tony isn’t a fool. This isn’t to please him, no, it’s for Steve, because Steve loves to steal groans and curses out of him, fuck his hole until he’s mumbling and incoherent. It isn’t worship, but maybe if Tony closes his eyes and wishes hard enough, maybe it could be. This is for Steve to own him, and Tony will let him.
“Oh, not this again,” Tony sighs, feeling the beginnings of another headache. “We’ve sent Banner to Dr. Strange’s abode. Tell me there’s not another crisis. If so, do me the honors of assuring me that it’s simply a robber or some misguided vagabond.”
He stitches the cuts himself and takes a warm towel to my face. Then, he murmurs dark threats that masquerade as apologies. He calls me Tony when he says, “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to. It’s just — you get — you’re not following orders. I told you what to do. Can’t you just do it? Tony, please. I’m asking here.”
He doesn’t understand what it means, if not a boot to the ass saying, move soldier, move. Isn’t that what he’s done all these years? Left foot, right foot, left, right, left, until he’s marching to another battle, making more ghosts.
Tony hummed, a soft laugh shaking his form. Steve wanted to hear the sound again and again. “Yes, you do, never stop telling me things, I want to hear everything you have to say Steve, every thought, every promise.” Tony swallowed, turning to him, eyes still so brown and expressive. “We write our own scripts. So don’t forget you’re the protagonist, alright? You’re the hero, you’ll overcome this.”
“Well, let’s introduce you.” He turns and points at both women sitting with their feet up on the sofa. They looked delighted as Steve squirms under their scrutiny. “Riri Williams and Kate Bishop.”
The waters are clear, a cerulean color towards the shore, a deeper navy towards the horizon where it meets the sky and bleeds into it seamlessly. It stretches further and further, so much so that Steve is struck with the idea that this is just the horizon. There’s the sky above it, the rest of the sea under. His mind flashes to a million different hues of blue: the sky surrounded by high rise buildings, only, the view is from above, as if he's soaring up the sky, catching a lift back to the Tower, hands around Iron Man’s plated shoulders.
Steve shifts back, pulls Tony’s shirt up, exposing his flat stomach. He kisses the valleys and grooves there, circling his belly button, before inching his way down to Tony’s half-hard cock. Steve smiles. Tony is groaning and trying to sit up again. He trails down Tony’s abdomen, licking his lips then runs his tongue over Tony’s shaft. His dick is throbbing, but he ignores it, focusing instead on getting Tony harder. Steve licks up and down, circling his thumb and index finger to jerk the length before sucking on the head. He groans, willing to take Tony in deeper.
“Yes, finally, fuck me, split me open. I want to go to my meeting with the feeling of your dick still inside me.” Tony ran his fingers through Steve’s wet hair then slid a hand to knead Steve’s back. He pressed the head in slowly, taking care to watch Tony’s impatient expression. Tony tugged at his hair. “Now, fuck me, Steve. Now would be good.”
It’s frightening to enter the place and witness how it’s been transformed. Without him. He’s afraid that he might be the only one who hasn’t changed.
“Like that will spare them, huh?” Samuel cups a hand over his mouth. A quick strike lights a fire. He smiles then blows smoke.
Tony fights a sigh, when Steve circles his rim and sucks his cock. Tony’s up on his elbows watching his cock get swallowed by perfect lips and blue eyes. Always blue.
Tony’s nodding because he’s lost in that shade of blue. Blue, like forget-me-nots. Blue, like the color of the cowl. Blue, like how Tony feels now.
He didn’t use to be this pessimistic. He was the type of man who never settled for less than what was right, and what’s right by his standards. But that’s just Steve.
Shit. That’s the thing, Steve. You and I have too many expectations of each other. Maybe that’s where we went wrong.
The Iron Man suit dropped on the Compound’s rooftop. “Hey, so.” Tony’s faceplate was up, revealing the sweat dripping from his temples.
For earlier, Tony thinks. Then, Steve’s burying his face on Tony’s neck again, wet little kisses that almost mask the drips of his tears. Tony’s eyes hurt. He grabs Steve’s biceps, squeezes them, once, twice, and they have eyes on each other again, following each other’s slight movements, the rise and fall of their chests.
Tony likes Steve messy with the taste of him, evidence of debauching perfect, pristine Captain America, making Steve suck his cock. Tony moans with the thought, doubles his effort in trying to peel off Steve's shirt. He doesn’t succeed because their angles are all wrong but they’re desperate to feel each other. No matter. Their lips lock again and Tony cedes control to Steve.
Can you tell us what happened, she had asked. Another said, he’s in shock. Then, a whisper, yeah, that kid’s a witness. A gasp recognizing him, that’s Stark’s son, you know, of Stark Industries? They got his contact info and gave him a ride home.
He places a hand behind Tony’s back, rubs circles, whispers about how he wants Tony better, wants Tony to please stop crying because he’s damned tired of hearing the sobs and the screams.
“Sometimes I forget how similar you and Bucky are.” Steve picks at a loose thread on his pants, struggling to maintain eye contact. “You would have been friends, I think. If all of this stuff hadn’t happened.”
“Perhaps a restorative healing approach, Colonel,” Vision says in his unhelpful monotone. “From what I have discerned, this approach would require the active participation and accountabilities of all parties, perhaps in the form of a circle. We would focus on group cohesion and repairing the damage from the fallout over the Accords.”
His thoughts are a mess, and Steve sees Tony loses his grip on himself. He breaks off, and the tears forming at the corner of his eyes break free and slide down over his splotchy cheeks. For a brief second, his eyes drop down to Steve’s mouth before his jaw sets, and his face contorts into something ugly and spiteful.
Steve swallows, then grins up at him, watching the uncertainty melt away when Steve takes the proffered hand and lets Tony tug him to his feet.
“Iron Man, meet us at the top of Main,” Steve makes a sweeping gesture north and watches as Tony blasts forward.
He doesn’t even wait for Tony to kick his feet apart, just willingly spreads his thighs and presses his forehead to the sofa.
The letters, he thinks with desperation. He hasn’t had a chance to read them. If he had known, he would have read them, just for the closure. Just to know. It’s not fair that he should die without getting a chance to read them.
Steve is awake and dressed, looking every inch of handsome perfection. He’s tucking the sheets back into place on the bed, as if he’s forgotten that Tony has robots for that sort of thing. Steve never actually forgets; he just prefers it. These little routines that Tony has categorized under Things that Keeps Steve Rogers Sane. It wouldn’t surprise him if before the end of the world comes, Steve still manages to find time to bounce a quarter off the corners.
An entire year and he’s barely even taken a breath. A year without Bucky. A year without Sam. They’d fought so hard to get here. To be happy.
They’ve discussed this. All of the current Avengers are in agreement and Ross isn’t naïve enough to challenge the unified team, not now that he’s lost so much ground.
Tony’s gaze flickers up, expression carefully neutral. “That’s not what I said. Are you—is that what you want?”
Steam all but rises from Ross’s ears and the aid to his left leans in to mutter something private the microphone doesn’t pick up. Next to Tony, Rhodey is tense, his left hand tapping against the side of one of his braces.
“Steve.” When Tony says his name, Steve’s eyes shoot to his face. They’re wide and open, so blue that Tony thinks he could easily drown in them. After all, he’s drowned in them before, so many times over.
When he flipped on the switch to the relaxation space, Tony was not prepared to practically jump out of his skin.
Steve is clocking his movements but why should Tony care? Steve probably knows now anyway, or at least suspects, and Tony has nothing to be ashamed of. Fuck Steve and his guilty conscience.
“You are so beautiful,” Steve whispers, one arm tucked around his waist to keep him steady while the other traces patterns over his ribs, sliding higher to brush light fingertips across Tony’s nipples and make him squirm.
It had happened, quite literally, in the midst of them all stumbling into bed together, Tony rattling off codes to the ceiling robot as he’d shoved his hand down Bucky’s pants.
There had been a time once where Tony would have gone to the end of the earth to protect Steve from anything. From everything. Hurting him now won’t make a difference. It only makes Tony ache to soothe him, to smooth away the stinging barbs he’s embedded under Steve’s skin.
The lie is so gauzy thin that Tony wonders why anyone chooses to believe it. But then, people will believe a lot of things when they’re too scared to face reality.
The room has thinned out around them. Tony shakes his head for a second, thinking he must’ve misheard.
What was left of the programming showed itself when Tony had poked him wrong at the shoulder, sending a whirl of pain up and along his spine. One minute Bucky was balanced on the table, the next he had Tony in a hard grip, fingers tight around his throat.
at all. It’s written like he thinks I was going to, I don’t know, send it to the press or something.” Tony grips the kitchen counter so hard his finger joints creak. “You know, he told me he loved me. Before.”
Tony hums, noncommittal, and glances towards the box of donuts, wondering how rude it would be to reach in and take one. The conversation made him feel uneasy and he wants to go back to hating each other, just to avoid it.
, explodes behind his eyes and a fresh wave of tears threatens. That he could have ever—that he had contributed to
Tony can hardly fault the rest of the Avengers for their frustrations. It’s not that he doesn’t share them on especially charged days, but after so many months, the sting has gone dull. Life is unfair, isn’t that what everyone always says?
When his brain is swimming–drowning, really–too much to think about anything more, Tony collapses into bed with his clothes on. Sleep hangs just beyond his grasp and every time he’s about to drift off, he jerks awake with an ache in his chest and his breathing rapid.
When he finally strips the webbing off of his uniform and tosses it into the corner of the gym, Natasha is at his side, a subtle tilt of her head enough of a signal that Steve knows his next play.
“Two more days,” Rhodey’s voice is soft and thick as he wipes his hands on a crumpled napkin and tosses it onto the remains of a soggy bun and a handful of fries.
He crawls into his bed and doesn’t sleep. The flip phone sits in the nightstand of his bedside table and taunts him. There have been missed texts on it sporadically since Steve came back to the US, usually variations of apologies and requests to talk.
Something pulls and tugs at the back of Tony’s mind, waiting to be set free. It belongs to Bucky, the little words he offered him earlier that morning that had made them all chuckle, except now they’re twisting with doubt and dousing him in ice cold water.
Barnes is staring at him, wide-eyed and horrified, the tie that was looped around his throat a few moments ago curled in his metal fist. He hasn’t made any efforts towards closing his gaping mouth and Tony could clobber them both. This isn’t even Tony’s fight, and Tony has no right to insert himself this way, but he can’t help it. Steve is so goddamn condescending and he’s repeating the same mistakes over and over again because he’s too stubborn to open his eyes.
The chest piece is glowing bright, and though there is a massive concave dent in the back of the suit, it doesn’t appear to impair Tony’s ability to fly or fight. Tony doesn’t respond, the eyes of the Iron Man suit glowing back at him as Tony dodges past Steve and blasts another alien dropping from the sky.
“Pardon me, Sir. Combatant might not be the most appropriate term. There is a spectator watching the Tower, more specifically, the Winter Soldier is observing you through the bedroom window.”
“I love you.” Steve brushes the hair off his face and to Tony’s distress, he slows down. Steve kisses the corner of his mouth, the edge of his jaw, dipping lower to suck a light bruise into his throat. The urgency dissolves and Tony’s cock doesn’t know what to do with this new development, still straining up seeking contact and the warm hollow of Steve’s abdomen.
Steve and Barnes sit opposite to Natasha and Sam in a small booth off to the side of the hotel’s bar and grill. It’s two in the afternoon and the room is empty save the Rogues, three of whom eye him warily as he approaches. One gives him a hopeful smile that feels like an undeserved secret.
Steve’s defenses are down. He’s exhausted and his thoughts feel sluggish, two steps behind the rest of him. The pang of losing Phil is lingering, sharp like a knife in his belly, but the fear of losing Tony was something different entirely.
“I can do that.” Steve falters for a breath as if he wants to say something else, but doesn’t. He doesn’t reach out to touch Tony, sliding to his feet and folding his jacket over his arm. He doesn’t linger, taking determined steps towards the door with his back to Tony, something Tony’s never been able to do.
Tony discovers time travel and drives out to the Compound, shield in his trunk, and has an uncomfortable reconciliation with Steve. It’s superficial, as they shake hands and talk about moving on with the word resentment tossed between them. As if such a menial world could fully capture the battleground where their future together went to die in the waste of Siberia and never came home again.
But the fact that there’s absolutely zero chance at a Captain America altercation means Tony lets himself join the team for dinner. The first time since they all came together.
Sometimes, Steve liked to think that maybe that meant that Tony had loved him too, pushing his buttons and getting under his skin because he too could feel the connection between them. He couldn’t have been the only one to feel the magnetic pull of something bigger than just the two of them, drawing them together.
, Tony thinks, feeling a sneer unfurl across his face. Sam, one of the few people capable of getting through to his darling ex-husband, and he doesn’t even try.
“What is that?” Tony demanded, brows furrowing as he inhaled deeply. He scowled down at the meal in Steve’s hands. “Okay, I’m not sure what your problem is, but this feels a little low even for you, Cap. Seriously, fuck off with that.” Tony waved his arm dismissively in Steve’s general direction.
He’s only just dropped his cufflinks onto the small dresser and is halfway through loosening his tie when there’s a knock at his door. It’s sharp and commanding, bringing a ripple of anxiety that spasms through his left shoulder and leaving his fingers twitching at his side.
A sixth text buzzes through as he’s sitting at his desk, halfway through his third glass of scotch because if there’s something Tony Stark knows how to do right, it’s a relapse. And he’ll be damned if he doesn’t deserve it after everything else.
and a huff of air before Tony and Rhodes are both laughing, and Steve imagines Tony half-wrapped around him, while Rhodes, straight-faced, tries to squirm out of the embrace.
He drops his forehead to the arc reactor, listening to the steady thump of Tony’s heart. He wonders if Tony knew he could hear it all along. Steve’s long since memorized every pattern: the way Tony’s heart rate picks up when he’s soaring through the sky, the way it settles to baseline when Clint hands over the last slice of pizza and their movie nights come to an end.
Tony’s breath catches and before he can stop it, a sob slips out and he presses wet eyes into the curve of Steve’s throat.
“Oh, Tony.” Steve’s prostate lights up his body and every muscle strains and releases as Tony thrusts into him at a controlled pace until Steve’s body is relaxed and open under his hands. Running his metal fingers up Steve’s abdomen, Tony rolls one of his nipples until Steve is making little hitching gasps and takes the briefest moment to suck the tip of Steve’s cock into his mouth before he crawls further onto the bed, pressing Steve’s legs apart.
“Mm,” Tony hums, taking the green light and working at his belt. “That’s right. If you just need a little reminder that I’m yours, or maybe that’s not what does it for you? No, I think it’s the other way around.” Tony dips a hand down into his boxers and wraps his fingers around Steve’s cock, already mostly hard and craving his touch. “I think you’d want to make sure I remember who I belong to. I think you’d want to remind me that I’m
“Ninety seconds to the surface,” JARVIS advised, and a flicker of the SOS appeared across the HUD before it disappeared. Even the alarms had stopped blaring. “Suit integrity, 23%.”
“When did I become such a bad guy to you, huh? You talk to me like I’m some—I don’t know, Tony—some dictator or something. Just because you’re angry doesn’t give you any right to—”
There’s no time to respond because Tony comes face to face with the rest of the team and the planning starts. This time, there’s no excuse for time alone which is a small blessing and allows Tony to focus on the work. This time, he can avoid being trapped in the past.
The nurse gave him another long look, before she pressed her lips together in something Steve had come to recognize as a sympathy that bordered on pity. She nodded slowly, and when it was clear she wasn’t leaving, Steve sighed again and pushed himself out of the bed. Zipping up his hoodie, Steve folded the blankets back into their perfect corners over the mattress.
Tony hadn’t been wrong; Bucky had been sulking around the Compound, sprawled out on furniture or sitting on the edge of the roof. A perch that left them both mad with worry.
Steve kisses him, laughing when Tony keeps up a steady stream of words against his lips. Maybe their friendship has a few perks in it for Steve after all.
“I saw it in the paper, you know,” Steve says, quieter. Pain flashes in Tony’s eyes but he stays stubbornly silent. “You called me and said not to worry when the mansion fell into the ocean and that same afternoon the papers said you were dead. And then you didn’t answer the phone, Tony!”
The wings are spread across one of his longer work-benches, and he’s been trying to work out some of the kinks, maybe add a little more firepower, even.
It soars through the air, silent and shining against the fluorescent lights and slices a clean sweep through the lowest part of Peter’s web just above his grip. Peter tries to launch another but Natasha’s throwing star slices through it before it makes contact with the ceiling and he shoots, toppling from the open air in a flurry of limbs.
If this is what Tony needs him to be—an escape, a distraction, he can give that to Tony. Steve steels himself and digs his nails into Tony’s hips
Ross is transparent, and there’s something respectable about that. Everyone else prefers to stab Tony in the back. Then lie about it.
“L–let’s go back to the Compound instead.” When Tony goes to protest, Peter straightens his shoulders with a false confidence Tony remembers from his own youth. “The rest of them will stay for a while. Let’s play video games or something. Order a pizza. You wanna see the new Death Star Ned and I finished putting together?”
how deeply and desperately these men loved him. It was all around him, looping and layering over each other, every sensation building and answering the one before.
Which absolutely wasn’t true, as the robot rolled forward towards an offering of a small Lego set of DUM-E himself, an equally miniature Iron Man blasting off beside him. The robot chirped, rotating his claw in Tony’s direction.
“Tony, just listen,” Steve starts, trying to meet him in the middle for once in their lives. “I’m not happy about how things played out and I hate that I hurt you, I do. This—it’s a mess and I know that. I want to sort it out, but right now I need to think about Bucky and the team—”
“Peter,” He says gently, because all at once the kid has tears in his eyes and looks like he’s about to cry.
“Are you sure you want to know?” Steve nods sharply and because he would want to know, too, if it had been Steve, he’ll tell him.
Honey and flakey pastry explode in his mouth at the same time he tastes the edges of Tony’s fingers, barely touching them with the tip of his tongue.
Tony draws a long breath and tips his head back against the thin hospital pillow. It’s unfair that he’s thinking about this again, but then, when has life with Steve Rogers ever been fair? Tony gives and gives and gives of himself, always has, to a fault really, and Steve sits back and basks in the glow of Tony’s charity.
Tony tilts his head in a nod back to their friends, all standing now, cheering with red-rimmed eyes and the biggest, brightest smiles Steve’s ever seen.
Tony will be here because he’s always there. Every dream, every nightmare; all roads lead back to Tony.
“Yeah.” Steve lets himself relax back into the pillow, accepting defeat. “Do you know what happened? After I fell?”
Strong arms wrap around his shoulders, tugging him in and holding him tight in a crushing grip against Steve’s chest. They cling to each other, desperation and fear crackling the thin threads of their reunion. Steve presses his mouth to Tony’s ear, the side of his throat, the curve of his shoulder.
Steve groaned, thrusting up into his grip and curling his other fist tighter around the little puppet in his hand. It couldn’t be wrong if it felt this good and Tony would want him to feel good. Tony would want him to be happy, that’s what everyone kept saying.
“I hurt for the kids, I hurt for Tony.” Her eyes flashed. Pain. She was in pain too. It’s a familiar ache. Grief was filled with longing. Yearning for the dead. “Don’t ever raise your voice at me, Steve. You can grieve forever and it’ll hurt every single day. No doubt about that. But shit, get it together for the kids.”
“It’s gonna be difficult, there’s no lie there. BARF should help with the traumatic memories. The only downfall is that one has to relive them, but the projection is supposed to help him work through the experience. His assigned therapist will help him make sense of the process, too.”
He blinks because of course Tony would know what Steve wants without him having to say anything. “Sometimes I miss the old gal.” Steve is surprised by his own admittance.
He learned that there were over five million people riding New York City's transit per day. Five million people is the size of a small country and he was the only one to witness the woman step down the ledge.
In those three weeks, the Compound was stifling. The air was too thick. It clung onto them. Too heavy with the reminder of the last time he was here, lounging about with Sam and Wanda. Vision floating in and out of the room, unannounced. Tony and his bots dancing in the workshop, a smoothie in hand. Natasha, sitting cross-legged with a Russian poetry book in her lap.
“As we said, Captain Rogers. It’s operable, but we need to do it right now. Dr. Lee and I will perform the surgery. There’s already an operation room booked.”
Steve took the sponge and washed Tony’s back, reaching up behind him, moving his arms around to get at the side of his ribs.
Tony grunts, pulls a few  inches away to pinch Steve’s side, then kisses him again. “It’s never been like this, though. Are the chickens gonna be alright?”
There’s still blood on the cell’s floor. There’s no utility in cleaning a pigsty when it’s serving its function.
Tony Stark doesn’t do that anymore. I didn’t listen, and I paid the price. Even now, I don’t know the currency to gamble on when it comes to Steve.
Then, Steve cried. Tears streamed from his face. He could only tell the difference between the shower’s water and his tears because of the taste of salt.
Steve ignored his throbbing dick. Instead, he pressed a finger to Tony’s open mouth. Tony grabbed his wrists, sucking and lathering Steve’s fingers with spit. He drew his hand back to press wet fingers on Tony’s hole. He lifted Tony’s thighs up to stare at the winking hole. He still had Steve’s come from earlier caking the rim.
It took Steve almost an hour to shave it this morning. Steve set the razor down dozens of times, then picked it up again. The cream on his jaw had turned too soft. He kept looking at the mirror, wondering what Tony would say about his fresh face. He didn’t have a sharp jaw like Tony, but Steve’s been told he’s got a strong chin.
He doesn’t know what was happening outside these four walls. There’s no electrical wirings in his cell, no blankets in case he tries to hang himself again. Warmth is a privilege reserved for men with dignity.
Husband. With that word, Steve’s knees always go weak and his heart stutters in his chest. Tony gets whatever he wants whenever he uses that word to refer to Steve, so instead of blushing embarrassment, he simply bends down, grabs Tony by the arm and leg lifts him up in a fireman’s carry.
Steve smiled, hoping it would convey how full his heart felt at that moment. Tony looked like a god, framed by the sky, its light, and the greenery all around them. It was just them, alone on the rooftop. Just two people, happy and in love.
Steve hides his face in Tony’s shoulder, breathing him in and gripping him hard. Steve’s fingers shake. He fucks Tony deeper, harder. He wants to hurt Tony, bruise him, slap him around. Steve is sick of controlling his strength. He wants to hurt himself.
The hands cupping him squeeze, hard, no remorse for the beating Tony just endured. Then, there’s a slick finger pressing to his entrance. There’s no pleasure in it. Just a quiet sort of detachment, like Steve’s checking that he’s still warm in there.
“All we can do is try to be better.” Her voice is flat, and it’s only now that he realizes she must be angry at him.
Tony exhaled. His Adam's apple bobbed. Then suddenly, he laughed. Steve’s a little proud of that predictable line. Tony’s smiling as he pressed their lips together.
“I couldn’t bring the tape with me, but I’m sure you can hack into SHIELD and access it.” Steve set the folder in between them. It contained their spotty research on the Winter Soldier and HYDRA up to date. There was a lot of retracted information from SHIELD’s files, but the most important document led evidence to Howard and Maria’s death.
“I got you shot. On my watch, Steve! That’s on me. All the things I did, the things I’ve done. I know sorry is not enough. It’ll never be enough.”
Steve sighed. Sometimes he wished he could just keep Tony chained in the workshop. Steve would fight all the battles himself if it meant keeping Tony safe.
Tony wasn’t going to cry, that would be reserved for later when he pounded the door of the suite across the hall and demanded they give him the contents of their wet-bar.
“I wish.” He rubbed a hand over his forehead. “I wish that the serum could have helped him. Hell, something. I don’t know. I would have begged Odin, made a deal with Loki. Whatever it takes, I’d have done it.”
Natasha reasoned that Steve needed to relax. She raised an eyebrow after one mission, when Steve beat someone’s face bloody and dislocated his jaw. She wondered out loud that Captain America needed a vacation. Natasha made passing comments about jumping out of helicarriers without a parachute and into positions he didn’t really understand.
He leans over for a kiss, shifting to pass Morgan who sits in the middle seat. She rolls her eyes and Kit wiggles around them, getting an eye roll from Morgan. Steve meets him halfway, pausing his work with the paddle to suck Tony’s bottom lip.
“Steve,” he calls out sometime later. Because he’s foolish and he wants to see Steve one more time, tomorrow, the next day. He hopes he’ll wake up still in Steve’s arms, wishing that he’ll turn around tomorrow morning and see those blue eyes and remember them without anger. “What was it—what couldn’t you say earlier?”
Tony doubles his efforts, impaling himself on Steve’s dick. Eyes on each other, Steve shifts forward to capture his lips, sucking on the bottom before nipping at Tony’s jaw. He plants his feet on the mattress and begins thrust up just as Tony drops down. Together, they work. An approximation of a conversation unspoken. A kiss here and long, drawn out moans, Tony keeps shaking Steve’s entire torso. Steve meets his gaze head on but Tony can’t decipher what Steve’s saying with the sound of their moans and the pleasure building in his balls. He can come from Steve’s dick alone. Steve’s orgasm must be building too because his pace quickens.
Back in the room, he closed the balcony doors, shut the curtains, and tossed the broken knob in the bin. Sitting on the bed, Tony phoned the receptionist. “Champagne, please. And two bottles of every liquor you have in stock.”
He pries Tony’s hands from his arms, and it’s only when Steve holds it up and forces Tony to focus his gaze on him that he realizes that they’re bloody. He rubs Tony’s back, whispers, “It’s alright, Shellhead, it’s alright.”
That he’d be missing Harley’s first day in high school. Peter’s graduation. He wouldn’t be here to help Steve move the kids into their college dorm. Soon, Harley and Morgan would follow, and Steve would pick out the beddings and the decor without Tony. He’d have to do all of that, alone.
Tony didn’t look healthy. He had circles under his eyes and he was so thin. But, his eyes twinkled and he had a smile. Steve wished he could kiss its upturned corners.
Morgan is bouncing in place with a basket of petals. She’s in a peach dress and her hair is braided to the side. Her big ol’ eyes stare up at him. “Pops! Did we surprise you?”
“I was trying to make amends. I was already remembering things then, Steve.” His eyes stung, but Steve forced their gazes to meet. Tony wanted to look away, but he couldn’t.
Steve’s never known him other than a quick spar in an airport field. There’s an unoccupied desk in the east corner of the workshop. There's an empty beaker, a half curled tong, and several test tubes lying organized in racks. The table is pristine, and behind it lies a glass cabinet with a warning sign containing more chemicals.
“You’re rich, you can buy another, sweetheart.” Steve took his shirt off and threw it over his shoulders. His jeans and boxers soon followed.
“You think I’m awful? My people wanted nothing but a home. That's what all species across this banal existence ever want.”
When he returns to the hotel room, Tony’s stepping half way in from the balcony, leaving the door slightly open. He glances at Steve, something uneasy on his face that is quickly replaced by neutral expression.
“Don’t try to turn this on me, Steve. You’re so obvious. I’ve been tailing you all for a while now and every time Tony does something half as reckless as you, you get your panties in a twist, yelling at comms.” Bucky sighed, “You sure know how to pick trouble.”
Harley had learned all of Tony’s sarcasm and had a tendency to talk back to Steve. Like his father, Harley also loved blowing things up in the lab.
Morgan attends school in the city with Pepper from Monday toThursday, and then on Fridays, Pepper and Tony somehow convinced the school to allow Morgan to have Fridays as home-schooling days. She’s a little genius already, spending time with her father in the workshop or doing her work in their kitchen table as Steve does the washing up.
“She’s like a hurricane,” Tony had laughed, full and filled with joy, so much so that Steve couldn’t help the heaviness blooming in his sternum. “Blows me away, you know? Like that one Neil Young song. She’s… She’s something, Steve. You’d like her.”
“I’m an open book.” Tony shrugged, toying with a couple of buttons on the panel. “Ask me anything and I’ll tell you the truth.” He pointed at Bucky, who seemed relaxed in the facility now. There were no more HYDRA agents on site. He was alone, but still on the chair. “He’s doing better. It’ll be good for him to see his therapist after this though. J, can you schedule it?”
Maybe he should have planned something more grand. A trip to Paris where he could propose on the Eiffel Tower or while drifting down the Nile. But Steve never fancied himself romantic. He loved Tony everyday, that’s all that mattered. Simple.
Steve wondered why it was so hard to deal with grief. Why couldn’t it have been Steve with the IV attached to his veins and throwing up in the middle of the night?
There's Bernie Tolliver and his ugly green coat with stains and holes on the cuff. Protect something, he had said, it gives meaning to your life. Tony tried. He did. He saw the future and knew what was coming. Tony had an imperfect solution, but it was a long con, and players like him had to roll on the dice.
Tony waved a hand at him, hushing. “Shut up for a sec, Steve. Let me read. J, baby, you awake? Can you help me?”
. Claiming that orgasm as his and his alone. Not Rumiko’s, not even Tony’s. It’s just for Steve. He keeps twisting his fingers, thrusting in and out, until Tony falls back on the mattress with a satisfied laugh.
“A date, or—” Tony bit his lips, looking at Steve with conflicting emotions. One moment, Tony’s eyes flicked down to his lips, then the next, he’s looking at Steve with pained nervousness. “Whatever you want. Whatever you want to give me.”
Steve from before who had Tony in handcuffs, hands behind his back as Steve fucked his face in rough thrusts. Steve who comes on his face and lets it dry. Steve who pulls Tony’ hair until he stands up, only to bend him over the settee and spank his ass with a belt. Until he’s too red, crying for Steve to stop.
“Miss Barnes, I swear on my father that Dr. Reed Richards sent me for you. I’m off to alert Dr. Strange as well.” With that, he runs off towards the Savage Mountains, gone in an instant.
He moves his back to Steve, as if he can’t look anymore. Tony fiddles with the buttons on the keypad, closes the door, and coughs. “Yeah, just be safe, alright? Please, I can’t lose —  we can’t. We’ve lost enough.”
“It seems like you both are doing well,” he says, face heating. He knows what she means. She didn’t expect him to be the one to leave. “I’m happy for you both.”
“I had this made just for you,” Steve says, and points at the door on the far wall. “I’m just right there if you need me.”
He stops, stands there on the sidewalk, and watches the pedestrians of New York honk and holler like nothing has changed. People still walk quickly, side stepping each other to get from one street to the other. People run down the steps and disappear into the dim lights of the subway station. There are vendors in the corner fiddling with their phones and bagging up kebabs. Others scoop roasted almonds into little brown paper bags and exchange them for a few loose bills.
Maybe people go on and on with their lives never thinking that they could lose the love of their life until they reached old age when it was inevitable. But Tony was young and there were promises of another few decades of love, hope, and dreams.
He had the urge to vomit again because Steve was here, alive, and now Tony’s brain was lighting up and shoving another memory to the forefront of his mind: Steve was yelling at him from the confines of a cell.
Sometimes, he pictured Tony’s mocking smirk before he brought a cigar to his lips. He wondered how Tony coped with the smell of ash and tar. Every time Steve went for business at the Stark Tower with Natasha and Maria in tow, Tony’s office smelled of whiskey and his heavy cologne. There was the underlying scent of cigars, too, but they weren’t like the ones Dum Dum used to smoke. The stench of the cigar was so strong, and again, he mused if Tony liked it.
He nods at all the right places, hums when he should, he’s on autopilot now. He wants to pay attention, he really does, but he finds his mind drifting to Tony, just a few floors above them.
It all came head to head in this facility. Natasha threw a dagger on Pierce's forehead, while Rumlow was replusored in the ass. Sitwell and other minions were being taken into Fury's custody. Steve didn't trust them one bit—and he'd rather go independent with Tony, knowing that Fury's moral compass was sort of skewed.
It’s been forty-one months without Tony and he’s alright. Steve was going to make it. He’ll wake up tomorrow and continue to live another forty-one months. Then, another three decades after that. Time would stretch on, but he knew one thing is certain: everytime he closes his eyes, he’ll see Tony’s smirk, his wide-eyes, surprised, happy.
Steve wears the judge’s robes. He’s the single voter on the verdict, and he’s the one who puts the noose around my neck. The rope is his fingers closing around my neck.
His body is heavy with the weight of being in the town square. It’s too bright out, and his eyes hurt every time his sight lands on the window of the Sheriff’s office.
“Hell no, Peacher Castle ain’t no Peacher. Besides, I think the Avengers of the West can handle anything, isn’t that what Ulrich wrote?” Red Wolf says, examining Tony with curious eyes.
“Shut up,” he whispers, voice harsh. Half of this face is bloody. Steve wipes it, props me up, and leans down to kiss me. Him. His face. Tony’s forehead.
“Just relax, I have you, I’ll take care of you, sweetheart.” Steve says, pushing Tony's chest back to the floor. He scratches at Tony's pubes, enjoying the feeling of it against his chest. Soon, Tony’s attempts to call out Steve’s name stops, but he’s still writhing, fingers flexing on the sand.
This might just be a moment for them, a fragment of history in their journalistic accounts, but this is Steve’s reality now. It’s his everyday. There wasn’t another story.
Natasha leads them towards the damn, looks back and forth, biting her lip. “That’s what I wanted to talk to you about. Jessica Drew is an orphan, there’s no one for her to return to.”
It still floored Steve that this little sensitive son of his could twist his features in anger just to avoid crying.
He stood on an empty platform late in the evening, waiting for the subway train on 86th Street when a woman, likely the wife of another rich bastard, entered the station. Her heels clattered on the concrete, a quiet pounding sound that accompanied the hum of the flickering lights. She smiled at him, her red stained lips turning into a small grin. She took off her heels, set them down by the platform, and draped a fur winter coat beside it.
Someone told him he should listen more, and he’s taken the advice to heart by biting the inside of his cheeks, waiting three beats to make sure that a person is done talking.
He’d taken apart the television set earlier, now he tasked himself with setting it right and improving the circuitry. Tony was lost in the wires and panels that ran on the machine, and he'd work much better with a glass of brandy, but he had none. Carol took all the liquor, even the fridge was empty save for a few bottles of S.Pellegrino.
The ocean keeps running to the shore, then back out again. Again and again, there’s that push and pull of dropping dead in the shoreline, then rushing back out again. He looks at Tony, anxious.
Tony takes another puff from his pipe, getting up to brew himself a cup of coffee. He imagines what Steve may reply. Steve would likely get on his knees, put a hand on the kid’s shoulder, and listen to the information intently, promising to check the dams again.
“Does it bother you that we never had a wedding?” Tony asks, out of the blue. He’s nursing a glass of iced tea. The lemon swirls as he messes with the straw.
Steve’s the same. It isn’t until he’s run out of the country did he realize Captain America and the shield is just his own line of defense because it’s frightening to peel back his skin and show the world the scars the serum has rid off. There aren’t any more scars on his arms from chicken pox.
“It’s a good song. I like it. We should play it more often.” Harley pressed his cheek on Steve’s chest. His heart clenched at the dampness there.
The barkeeper returns. His apron is caked with the smell of dried gin, and somehow, it reminds Steve of that time he and Tony shared a bed in Clint’s old farmhouse.
Steve from before who arranges his legs as wide as they can go, spits on his hole, and fucks him until his hole is puffy.
Failure, though, that's another beast. You ever read Samuel Beckett? He was after your time, Irish playwright who had a tragic view of life. He's a funny man. Though, you might not like him, Steve. He's probably too much an absurdist for you. You're an idealist in an ugly world and really, that stubborn optimism of yours pisses me off. But I admire it. Respect it. Even if I disagree. Beckett says there's no meaning of life and accepting that well...that leads us to freedom. A different freedom than one you might think of, Steve. You’re dead, so you’re free. The rest of us are held captive in this reality. Suspended animation, Reed might say.
Across the hall, Natasha’s door remained open. Her face was impassive. Steve considered this as her worried look. She raised an eyebrow.
Is he supposed to crack his ribs open now, hasn’t Tony know it’s already fractured? That Steve himself is just a fragment of who he was, the man they think he is, the man he’s supposed to be?
Steve stared at the wicker sofa. It didn’t feel like looking at the end of the world anymore. It was just a place where an ending happened but life kept moving. Steve dropped on the single seat across from it. He didn’t feel as heavy-hearted today, but he’s been feeling threadbare and his limits for so long it hardly mattered.
Steve reached out and placed a hand on Tony’s shoulders, urging him to go on. Tony shivered with the force of it. He hadn’t been touched in a long time.
The limo passed through Harlem where there was a community event in honor of Tony, and then, there was a local memorial in Central Park. This was Tony’s turf and his hometown made sure he was remembered.
“Good morning, beloved,” Steve said to the empty room. He stared at the ceiling, not ready to look at anything else. At least the ceiling was a white canvas. There was no evidence of Tony ever marking it. He spent many mornings cataloguing the plaster on the ceiling, counting dust motes from the light filtering in the windows.
The ground is where they kick him until he can't even wrap his arms around his belly to protect his spleen.
He doesn’t want it that way. No, never did. But sometimes Steve can’t keep his mouth shut. Nor does he want to. He needs to say what he wants or a sinking feeling will take over, a volcano of emotions and resentment builds and builds, tethering with coarse and sharp words until it erupts into fists thrown against the wall.
Tony takes a sip and eyes Steve through the brim of his mug. “Isn’t it a bit presumptuous of you to assume what I can handle?”
“He’s always wandering.” The man reaches for something on the porch. It’s a blunt; he blows the smoke to the side, and looks up at Steve, measuring. “You a cop?”
And because Tony asks him for it, that’s exactly what Steve does. He sits up on his haunches and kisses Tony’s waiting lips.
Steve sets him on his back, lines himself up, and stares at Tony the entire time. Steve’s face reverent as if Tony is a god he worships. He bites his lips and whispers sweet things about how he loves fucking Tony, and he’s so grateful to have this.
Tony was wearing a faded yellow t-shirt in big, bold curvy font stating, ACDC. He wasn’t wearing trousers. His red checkered boxers peaked just below the t-shirt. There was a dust of fine hair on his shins and there were stains on his knobby knees. Steve barely had the moment to clear his throat and turn his eyes away from Tony’s legs. He’s seen legs before. He was in the army, for fucks sake.
“I’m fine.” Tony glares, uncertain of how to respond. His fingers itch for his breast pocket, only to find his usual flask absent. He drops his head on the wooden beam, wishing he would be brave enough to bash it in. He’s damned tired of the waves of nausea that never seems to end. “Who said anything about love?”
But the flowers smell fresh, and the carnations are in bloom, like they were picked from the green house just a few hours ago.
This is unacceptable. Steve’s researched the man—Tiberus Stone—in these past few weeks. He’s the son of a wealthy businessman and runs in the same circles as Tony Stark. He was in the sex tape with Tony.
But the device allowed him to watch the scenes of their lives unfold. It was better than turning over memories in his head—he recalled them perfectly—but BARF allowed him to hear Tony’s voice. The way it would fall flat at a groan. How a sarcastic remark would slide off his tongue.
Tony laughs, and it hurts to hear him sound so content with his life. Steve is happy for him. Really, he is, but it seems like the rest of the world has moved on except him. The jealousy in his chest aches and it takes awhile to soothe it down. He wishes he was a better man.
“Always carnations,” Tony nodded, pressing his head to Steve’s shoulder. “But later. Just hold me, Steve.”
They burned Tony's body but maybe even then, the particles and molecules making him up will go into the universe and transform into something else. Hopefully, something beautiful and worthwhile.
Tony understands the way brains are affected by ethanol. Neurons demand nutrition from the brain. He’s just a body now. Six feet and one inch, he can’t even stand up with the damage to his knees, so used to being on all fours with his ass up.
He has that spirit about him, the sort that you follow anywhere because you’re too blind to see that he's simply just a son of a bitch who lets silly things like love dictate him.
He opens for Tony, hums at the slight sour taste in both of their tongues, but Steve doesn’t care much. Steve deepens the kiss and rolls their hips until they get a rhythm.
The man shrugs, shoves the cigarettes in the front pocket of his t-shirt. “Your loss. There’s a party inside, if you wanna pass through. Rum, beer, some blow. Tony Stark fucking around with a toaster. If you’re into that shit.”
Sheriff Red Wolf raises both hands, and for a moment Tony thinks he’ll be arrested, but Red Wolf takes him by the shoulders, and claps him twice in a friendly gesture. “Stark, relax. In a town full of crazies, no one will bat an eye about you and Rogers.”
Steve pressed him deeper into the mattress, and glided between his legs. Breathing hard, he ran a hand on Steve's chests, tracing the valleys of his collarbones before lifting up to kissing his cheek. Steve choked, a quiet sound in the dead of the night, and offered him a shaky smile.
He knew he’d always hold onto Tony—the memories were marked and branded to his brain. There would be no forgetting for Steve.
Steve loves to trace the lines on the red and gold hand and he loves to suck on them after it’s filled with Tony’s come. He flips Tony’s left hand, brings it to his mouth, and kisses the wedding band.
Steve fists his dick, jacks it off a couple of times. He takes a deep breath, then moves to the center of the bed. Tony’s been patient, panting and making low, pleased sounds, anticipating what Rumiko has planned.
“That’s not—” Bucky leaned forward, catching Natasha’s gaze. Like Rhodes and Carol, they shared a silent conversation between them. Fuck this.
He knew he was being needy and he’s been clinging into Tony since he was first diagnosed. Natasha and Pepper both agreed that Steve was like an emotional octopus, getting all his arms and feet all over Tony and refusing to let go.
“I feel like this would be saying goodbye,” Tony’s eyes open to catch the moonlight drifting in the outdoor balcony. They haven’t made the Avengers Tower home.
“Alright,” Tony said, because society people have notoriously impeccable manners even if it was all smoke and mirrors. As he stepped back to the machine, the station bells rang to announce the arrival of the car. It was a loud, angry whistle that shook the edges of the platform.
Tony lets the pride settle in his chest. He’s fucking Captain America into silence. A hand slips to hit Steve’s chest. He wants to spit on it so bad. If Steve was still wearing his suit, Tony would aim for the goddamn star.
Except, well, maybe that might not be true. The happiness comes in waves, and now, as he looks over to see Rumiko's scrunched up face on the verge of coming, it registers that Tony and Rumiko will have this for the rest of their lives. Steve is just here for a moment. He’s a wild animal passing in the juncture of an intersection. He'll cross the road and go on his way after this. It's just for tonight.
"I survived because of it— him, the Hulk. Let me get used to my own skin. I finally understand why I deny things.”
“I could be persuaded for another kiss,” Steve hauled Tony to his chest and rubbed his back. He was so warm, Steve sought him out the same way a sunflower followed the sun. “You know, you’re bound to wake up the minions.”
His fists were clenched and Tony knew the way Steve looked when he wanted to hit something. This was familiar. This was like being in the rubbles of the Mansion all over again.
“I’m never gonna love again, Buck. Not because I don’t want to. It’s just not possible. I don’t want to love someone the same way I loved him. Do you know what it’s like to
“I’m sorry, I didn’t write as often, or call, or text, I — I’m not good at words,” Steve tries, grimacing at the sound of his voice.
“It’s alright, sweetheart. It’ll be alright,” Steve said, hoping that if he said the phrase enough, it would come true. “We’ll be okay.”
“Tony!” Steve groans and drops his head between Tony’s legs. The answering reply is a quiet one. Tony runs a hand through his scalp again, but this time, it’s softer, massaging.
“Sometimes I wonder if it’s alright that we’re getting them into this. They’re so young.” Natasha offers her hand. Steve goes easy and follows her out the door. “Come on.”
“What you’re doing,” she trails off, flicking her cigarette so the ash falls to their feet. It’s soon taken by the breeze.
“Yes,” he mumbled, thinking about Peggy’s funeral, losing soldiers in France, Bucky falling off the train. “But this is Tony. I thought we’d have forever.”
As if Tony’ s reading his thoughts, he cups Steve’s face with one hand, bringing their mouths together. Tony slips his tongue inside, wet and warm, as if to assure Steve that they’ll both be alright.
“I don’t know what that means,” Tony says and it’s the truth. What he knows is that he’s woken up in the morning to look at Steve’s bright yellow toothbrush beside his blue one. It’s dry and unused for weeks.
There were shock impulses from the wheels, high vibrations that sounded like waves. Only this time, the train blared, wailing loud from a short distance. The conductor must have seen her because the ringing continued like some formidable warning.
Tony dropped to the floor and eyed the puddle of vomit with barely a hint of disdain. He rolled over and found a bottle of rum. It was nearly empty, nothing left but a sip.
He turns to blow the smoke away from Tommy, not sure how to react. His eyes linger on the Sheriff’s station, then drift to the pigsty. “Kid, you don’t gotta believe everything you hear.”
He quizzes me on how we met, how the Avengers found him all those years ago. He asks me, “Do you remember the first words we said to each other?”
The rooftop was in perfect planting condition because Tony installed an invisible fortress around their brownstone that controlled the rooftop’s temperature. It was a year round greenhouse and Steve’s perfect, considerate husband built it just to support his hobbies.
For a moment, Tony thinks he’ll be allowed to lie there, that they’ll let him melt onto the floor until there’s nothing left. He hoped that the guards would shoot him down and put his photo on the wall. But Steve kneels down, waves the officers off, and they’re alone.
“I’m coming, fuck, Tony.” Steve thrusted twice, trying to suppress his orgasm. “You first, come for me.”
Three years later, here he is, still standing on the edges of the workshop. He stands there, trying to be level-headed.
“It’s alright, Steve. Sometimes we leave so we can come back,” Natasha says, voice undeservingly soft. “So we know it’s worth coming back.”
Steve bit his lip. She was right. “No, it’s alright.” He swallowed. “You’re right. That’s what he said—Tony, you all know—” he struggled to get the words out, to refer to his husband to people who didn’t actually know him. “I shouldn’t just live for my kids, that’s not right. He said that it’s not over. That our ending was happy too. I have to be happy. He told me — he made me promise that I’ll be okay. But I… I don’t know how to accept that I won’t see him again if it’s not in my dreams. My memory. It isn’t happy now. He said—we had a happy ending. But it wasn’t that. That wasn’t how I remember it.”
He thinks Tony might have smiled back in the day, amused at Steve’s flustered state, but he doesn’t now. Instead, his eyes remain on Steve’s own as if he’s trying to stop himself from looking Steve up and down.
Tony called it BARF because he didn’t want to talk about feelings. Tony said talking about emotions and trauma made him want to throw up. Yet here he was, the man who opened his mansion to the team, funded them, and built their tech. Maybe Tony preferred self-deprecation when talking about his time in Afghanistan, but Steve saw through the facade.
They just brought Morgan home twelve weeks ago, and for the third time in their life—Steve and Tony were in love with another small human being.
and listen to my kids’ educational progress. Where Tony can’t be. Homecoming for Peter. Prom. All that shit, Nat. He’ll miss it. And—” Steve hiccuped, fists closed. He blinked, trying to center himself. He wasn’t going to break down today. He wasn’t. He couldn’t. It’s Christmas. No crying during the holidays. “And I miss him.”
Steve couldn’t imagine the future without him. Another forty-one months, maybe Steve would live another forty-one years without him. It’ll be alright, he promised himself. Little by little, he’ll stitch himself together.
These two words often occupy Steve’s head, and he goes numb with the possibilities of how life could be different now if he spoke up years ago, if he listened instead of shaking his fist and pushing forward. But fear is paralyzing, and that’s the trick, he realizes now. It’s how men back in his day enlist because they’re told to fight for their country, and the motivation for such an act is born in terror of losing everything they have.
“Yeah?” There’s a ghost of a smile in Tony’s lips, barely there at all, like he’s amused but refuses to show it. “See how the rest of the world keeps moving?”
The waves crashed without remorse. All he could do was stay half-wake, half-asleep, immobile as the wreckage passed.
“Look, dad,” Morgan says, pointing excitedly at their hummingbird feeder. Even with all the feeders Tony’s gifted him, the one that hangs on the tree by the docks is still Steve’s favorite. It’s something special.  “Pops.” She grabs Steve’s shoulder and tries to turn him. “The red-winged blackbirds are there.”
“It’s yours,” Tony insists, voice low. Steve detects a waver there, as if Tony is unsure that is true even in their history, but he nods in determination and repeats the statement. “So take it.”
They settled on the long table: Scott, Hope, and Cassie on one end with Sam, Bucky, and Natasha near Steve. Carol and Rhodey sat in the middle. Across from them were the Bartons. Their kids sat in the empty seats. Steve tried not to choke when Peter took the seat on the other end of the table. Tony’s seat.
Tony shakes off the memories focusing on Sherrif Red Wolf, instead. It's in the evenings when he opens the door to the phantom that haunts him.“Did you tell them to stay away from the dam?”
He’s sitting on a plush, winged back chair, legs spread, hands on folded on his lap. There’s a tray with a jug of water and an empty glass beside him.
“You know, we could hire a cleaner. They’d come everyday. You wouldn’t have to bend over the tub to get the soap scum off.” Tony hummed, rubbing Steve’s chest. “Wait, nevermind, I like you bending over.”
“Fuck,” Steve stared at Tony’s blown pupils and his bobbing throat. Steve tried to get the dirt from the palm of his hands, but it was no use, Tony’s trousers were streaked. He unbuttoned Tony’s pants, pulling them until they were below his knees.
Tony stared at him with a frown. “Relax, Rogers, I’m not gonna hunt your buddy. Not if he could be saved. But you’re not stopping me from hunting HYDRA.”
He knows it’s not useful. Not five years later with thousands of days in between the bunker and Wakanda and now. The four seasons had already passed, and then it passed again, and again.
Steve kissed his collarbone, blissed out from coming. But one thought rang loud and clear: he wants to be the perfect husband, too.
Tony hits the first key, then the rest follow. He hums at first, getting settled. Drunk out of his ass, he sang outside the station, timing it so that Steve was in the station, feet up on the rickety wooden desk, reports in hand. The best nights were when the oil lamp burned low and there were no other men locked up in the cell. Steve would invite him over to sober up or walk him home.
The kids began chatting about their plans and projects for the day. Morgan planned to help Steve with harvesting some of the basil and cucumbers in the garden, while Peter and Harley tried to convince Tony for access to tools in the lab. The morning conversation was light and it washed over Steve. He was content to listen to them joke and tease each other. At least the kids didn’t fight often and when they did, Tony and Steve made sure to explain their feelings to the kids. Parenting was a lot of work. But life was good.
Just like he always did every night, Steve will drop into the same sheets he’d shared with his husband for the better half of a decade. He’ll take out all the clothes from Tony’s drawer and run his hands all over them—the silky ties, the suit jackets, his cotton socks. Steve will carry it all to the bed and hope like hell it still smelled like Tony. In the morning, he’ll wake up early, fold the shirts, hang the suit pants, putting them all back to their original places. Then, he’ll run around New York, return to the brownstone, and cook breakfast for his family, just like he always did.
He turns on the radio. After a beat, the static goes away and the music starts. With a quick start, he thinks Tony might like this, though he’ll probably make fun of Steve’s vehicle choice.
“No. I’m sorry to wake you,” Steve measured out, feeling slightly awkward and annoyed that he had to be here at all. If the world wasn’t so fucked, then maybe Tony’s parents would still be alive and he wouldn’t have to tell Howard’s son that his best friend, Bucky Barnes, was the one who orphaned him.
He swept the floor, waxed it, then dusted the art pieces. Steve stacked some of the books from the coffee table, tucking them to the shelves. He ran a hand over the spine of some of his favorites, picking up some books at random. They were Tony’s collection, a hodgepodge of books ranging from sci-fi, biographical, to journal annuals.
Tony eats it up because there’s almost nothing else left but this warped determination to fuck each other good. Just for tonight. He sticks out his tongue, knowing he probably looks wanton, but Steve’s always liked him that way, looser, less in control. Steve takes his cock—half hard now, and getting harder again—dabs the head on Tony’s awaiting tongue. Once, twice, then he’s coating Tony’s lips with the taste of him again.
Steve was irritated. He didn’t want to sit on the rooftop, but Pepper insisted. They sat with cups of coffee between them and matching frowns on their faces.
He gave a snort, focusing on the blood oozing from his palm. Tony was anything but that—a resurface cut. Loss was more like a Jericho missile being dropped on Steve’s chest.
Steve stayed steady, holding onto Tony’s waist and feeling the sensation of being inside. “You’re so pretty, Tony. I love this. I love doing this. I love making you feel good.”
He reminds himself that this isn’t Steve. Not the Steve he’s known half his adult life. Not even the Steve who straddled his prone body and punched his face bloody while the rest of the world burned.
“You’re still as handsome as the first day I laid eyes on you,” Steve said, squeezing Tony’s calves. He loved quiet mornings like these, when they were all lazy together. It was domestic. There would be more meals in bed, just like this. Steve wasn’t giving up. Everything was fine.
He’ll pick more fresh eggs and some flowers from the garden to give to Tony. And by the time he returns back to the house, Tony will have shredded the cheese and have toasted the bread for their omelettes. They’ll have breakfast. Together.
“No, no, hell no, I see your face. I don’t wanna start this conversation.” Tony holds up a hand, shakes his head. He takes the soiled napkin and flicks it to Steve’s side of the table with a huff. “We’ve only been here a day, I don’t wanna start now.”
His mind returns to the photographs in the hall, looping back to Tigra kissing Jarvis and saying goodbye, to her dismembered body, hanging like a mantle.
an agent told him in a monotone voice. Life was slowed down without termination. A living creature may appear to be dead but it's just their body fighting for survival by dropping to a dormant state.
“Thank you for joining me,” Steve says, meaning it, not being able to express his gratefulness. Something is building in the back of his throat, and he means to say more, only he doesn’t know what.
Steve was speechless. He swallowed, searched her awaiting eyes. They were brown, wide, and expressive, so much like Tony’s and it only hurt a little bit. Like an ache to a month-old bruise. Like a quiet murmur. It was okay to look at her and think about missing Tony and loving him and feeling like shit and waiting for the world to just swallow him whole. It was alright.
“Salty,” Tony counters easily but also finishes his plate. He leans against the winged back chair, arms across his chest, a look of curiosity on his face. “I was wondering…”
He would never bring Tony coffee in that mug again. But Steve still had use for it. He leaned on the counter, picked up the mug, and traced the lining of the words in bold curly lines:
Tony pecked them every time they had the chance. Then, in the mornings, Steve traced the lines on Tony’s sternum under the daylight filtering through the windows.
Steve chokes down a sob. A plea. He doesn't know. He longs for a different time. Maybe if he had had more courage, he might have said something to Tony years ago, rather than forcing himself to be satisfied with specks and remnants of what could have been.
They sit outdoors under a huge rainbow umbrella and chatted away. From where he sits, Steve can see Tony down the street. His track suit jacket now lies abandoned on the floor. He’s taken to wiping his sweaty forehead with the end of his shirt, and while people stopped to stare, most people paid him no mind when they realize he wasn’t too focused to engage in a conversation.
Tony bites his lips and doesn’t say the words out loud because he knows Steve will walk out the door come morning. He’ll wear the suit and patrol the streets with the rest of the New Avengers, and the next time Tony will see him, they’ll fuck again. Only this time, the cuts are meant to hurt, and they might not pull back.
Tony’s clammy hands shake as he packs the pipe with tobacco, humming a song he doesn’t like to sing anymore. Each verse tastes sour in his mouth, like the tang of alcohol on his tongue. He lights the pipe and observes the upgrades to the armor.
“Promise me something.” Tony opened his hand and laced their fingers. Steve brought it up to his lips and kissed the wedding band.
The water was too hot but Tony didn’t complain. It smelled like lavender. Tony sighed, dropping further into the waters.
It’s the first time Tony’s said his name all day, and he suppresses the pressure on his chest and the need to sigh out.
“I came to just tell you about your parents. I understand if you don’t want to take any part of this. You shouldn’t have to—”
Steve continues the assault on his stomach, and Tony jerks, trying to even out his breaths and hold it in, but it's useless. Steve is rocking against his back, and he's arranging Tony's body, forcing Tony's legs shut. He grunts, slipping his cock between Tony's thighs, thrusting in and out at a slow pace. "Fuck. You feel how hard I am?"
He hates driving. He drove a humvee in Desert Storm but at least there wasn't traffic. Los Angeles freeways are always backed up, anywhere he goes. Steve soon gives up and learns the side street routes that take him from Wilshire to Venice. It's a straight route from Washington Boulevard.
“I’m sorry — I.” Steve hid his face against his hand. “I’m angry. I really am. I shouldn’t have done that,” he tried again, voice jagged with forced calm.
She wears a large bonet over her head, so unlike her usual attire when they’re off running patrols with Red Wolf.
Steve prows in a circle, making pleased sounds as he runs a finger down Tony’s shoulder, then up his arms.
“Yes, well.” Red Wolf scratches his head and points at the Mayor’s office. “Danver’s late husband, Colonel Rhodes, seems to have appeared at their house early this morning.”
Rhodes snorted. “You know, that’s something Tony would say. Try to play this off as something casual. But you know why we’re here, Steve.”
Tony meets his eyes for a moment, as if to apologize for the questions, but Steve merely shakes his head as if to say, no harm done.
He and Tony had such funny kids. Morgan loved doing cartwheels and fancied herself as a gymnast one day, then she’d spend afternoons turning the pages to classic texts and called herself a poet. Harley and Peter were cut from the same thread, finishing each other’s sentences that Tony wondered if they shared a brain.
She stayed silent, lips turning to a pressed line. She shifted closer, wrapped an arm around his shoulder, then rearranged them so Steve’s head was on her lap.
He scratches idly, almost absently at his right shoulder, but Steve knows that all of his focus is on the prosthetic, how it can be improved so his nerves aren’t affected by the cold. Tony is likely running scenarios in his head now, so Steve stays quiet and lets him be. He drops his right hand on Tony’s knee and lets it stay there.
Steve could see Tony’ massive design sprawling against the blue lake glittering under the sun. Throughout the west, there are already trees of all kinds, pines and oaks. “What about a cherry tree?” Steve asked, one hand going to his hips. He could already imagine the area milling with people. A team. New recruits to be trained. “Maybe on that rose bush.”
“Stop, Tony, just stop.” Steve’s fingers tightened on Tony’s shoulder for a beat. “You and I both know that this isn’t just about the Registration. It was everything else.”
“And you say it ain’t like that, huh?” The man laughs and claps Steve on the back. “We’ll bring you a beer.”
Steve stands there, hands in his pockets, a sheepish smile on his face. It’s a night in, just between the two of them.
Tony pauses, pensive for a moment, likely lost in thought. He shakes himself. “Don’t tempt me! I’m retired! But, but, but, I could be persuaded to consult and oversee the building of a headquarters….”
Steve hums a quiet tune, like they’re back in the Mansion on 890th and he’s showing Tony his sketches.
Tony gritted his teeth and shoved her, but it wasn’t enough. She was stronger, and he was weak, a body that hadn’t seen the sun in days.
Clint looks like he's in pain, as if the noose wasn’t tied properly. Maybe Steve wanted it to hurt, wanted to prolong Clint’s life as penance.
“Cut it, go ahead. It’s good for open wounds.” Bruce nods and offers Steve a pair of garden scissors. "I woke up in Sakaar and two years had passed. I get the confusion.”
“Fuck you, Red Wolf,” Tony whispers, itching to scream at him, maybe punch him in the face. He flicks his wrist, but the contraption only reveals a gun, not a flask. “It was never like that.”
Tony keeps his sunglasses perched on the bridge of his nose. He taps two fingers on the console. A patpatpat with no rhythm at all.
“Yes.” Tony rolls his eyes and opens the dishwasher. “But I’ve been told there’s something useful about teaching kids responsibility and not letting the bots do all the work for them.” He turns to Riri. “Besides, when you leave and go off to college, how are you gonna ever wash your own dishes?”
“What do you think I’ve been doing?” Steve seethed, loosening the grip he had on the glass. He made sure he was there for
He swallows like a starved man. At least he’ll know what Tony’s come tastes like. There's a greedy part of him that says
“I know, baby. I submitted the schematics to Pep, so everything should be fine now.” He smiled and climbed onto Steve’s lap, ignoring the kissy and mocking faces their kids made. “You won’t miss me tonight.” Tony winked.
Later, when they’re both naked and flushed together, breathes heavy with want, Steve grabs Tony by the waist and carefully presses him against the shower’s tiles. The sun is setting now, the cutting on the outdoor shower’s roof lets in the colors of the sky. It’s a haze of lavender and pale oranges. Tahoe in the summer is warm, but in the evenings, it cools down, and a slight breeze greets them.
In the morning, Tony wakes up with a hangover. He’s naked in the guest room on the second floor. “Fuck,” he massages his temples and lies back down on the bed. He has a blistering headache that starts at the base of his skull and wraps around both of his eyes.
they’d say. There were no pauses, no questions, just debating the strategy for victory. Steve supposes that a man gets used to that. When you spend all your free time standing around a room full of men out for blood and call it necessary for democracy, winning becomes the most important thing. But Steve could never swallow down his morals just because a proposal made sense in a moment in time. Still, when he was in the Army, he had an order, so he followed.
When Tony pulls his fingers back and wraps them around his throat, keeping up a steady pace as he drives into him, Steve moans and lets his head drop. If Tony pressed down just a shade harder, he’d even take away his ability to breathe and Steve could be completely at his mercy.
The eccentric little Omega saw everything for exactly what it was, and exactly what he wanted it to be.
“There won’t be a neighborhood for him to get friendly with if aliens wipe out the planet,” Rhodey points out, because he’s rational and a realist that way.
Bucky fishes his phone out of his pocket and brings it to his ear. Steve tries to ignore him, fixing his gaze on the mess of broken glass. He can’t look at Bucky, and he can’t look at the photo of Tony and the perfect family Steve never had with him.
“This is not doing anything for me.” Steve deadpanned, tugging Tony towards him and licking a strip along the underside of his jaw, practically purring as he reached down and traced the line of Tony’s waistband. “But
“Tony, yes. Yes sweetheart, come on. Like you mean it,” Steve pants, bracing his feet on the bed for leverage and trying to arch harder into Tony’s thrusts.
“Goddamn it, Steve. What the hell are you doing to yourself down here?” Steve barely sees Bucky as tears mix with the blurred specks now dancing across his vision.
There’s a reason he’s built this, and before they’d interrupted him, Bucky had been utilizing two of the weighted blankets, a grounding strategy Tony was familiar with. It had made him feel like he was suffocating when he’d tried it months ago.
Peggy is just as beautiful as she ever was, so still she could have been sleeping. Steve has seen more than his fair share of death, but seeing Peggy is something different. Her hair coils around her thin, time-weary face, and the flowers do their best to break through the cool sheen of death.
Tony frowns because it sounded right in his head, but his stomach is screaming that it’s a lie. They could have done this before, at any point. Hell, he had tried to talk to Steve, more than once, before everything fell to pieces.
Peggy’s the last one to approach him, cupping his chin in her palm. Immediately, he knows that this isn’t the Peggy he’d been with. This is the Peggy from his own timeline, from a whole different life. “I hear we had our dance,” she says. “You didn’t have to do that, Steve. I was going to be okay; you knew that.”
Tony’s emotions are traveling along with Steve, on some horrific warp-speed rollercoaster, ebbing and flowing like the tide in a typhoon, as he’s hit with every time Steve’s lied, hidden the truth, chosen not to trust him all over again. Except he’s doing all the right things now, and the whiplash leaves him gasping and raw, shredded down to the very core of who he is. It’s too hard to process what this means, all without Steve having to say a word.
Bucky had ripped his shirt right off his body, which, rude, but also hot as hell. Anticipation shivered down Tony’s spine as four hot, heavy hands worked him over slowly, rolling over his person as if they could massage pleasure into every crease and crevice.
“It’s not all black and white, Steve. I’m not going to walk away because we’re having a fight. I want you to be a real person with me. I know it’s hard, I wrote the book on deflection, remember?”
“We thought you might say that.” Clint flops down on the couch and crosses his arms over his chest, looking like a cat rolling in the cream. “Show ‘em, Nat.”
“Not like you to forget.” Tony smirks and Steve shoots him an exasperated look. “Don’t worry, I’ve been told that I can be very distracting.”
It’s an homage to the way Steve’s features had contorted when Tony had handed him the divorce papers, but infinitely worse because this time there’s an additional layer of fear that borders on terror. There’s something pinched around Steve’s mouth, the way it quivers in the corner, and Tony can see the rapid thrum of his pulse in the hollow of his throat.
Instantly regretting that when Tony pulled back, Steve watched half-dazed as he shoveled a quickly cooling bite into his mouth and grinned.
Vision turns to look at him with a blissfully ignorant, encouraging smile. “I’m unfamiliar with this practice, Tony. Could you elaborate on its function?”
“Oh, ho, Barnes, those are fightin’ words.” Tony throws his hands up from where he’s been tinkering on the 1932 roadster Bucky drools over. The first time he’d laid eyes on it, Steve had gotten an earful about keeping secrets and hoarding the wealth, and it had taken less than an hour for Bucky to drag Tony back down to the garage with permission to play.
“A year, Tony.” Steve shakes his head at the enormity of the loss. Then again, softer, “A whole year.”
“You two are going to make sure he doesn’t tear the wallpaper off the wall, right?” Tony asks. Rhodes slaps a hand down on his shoulder, and Steve winces a little, his ribs still tender.
If only Tony knew how right he was back then. Steve hardly knows who he is these days. The remnants of his team give him broken, pitying looks when they think he isn’t looking and he’s not Captain America now, hasn’t been for months. The shield doesn’t belong to him anymore, he couldn’t carry it even if it did.
Tears prickle behind his eyelids and even as his entire body rises up towards Tony’s mouth, he begs, “Don’t make me come!”
. Somewhere on the edges of his consciousness he thinks he hears a yelp, and when enough of his brain reboots, Steve opens his eyes and sees Tony wearing a mischievous grin, rubbing at an already purpling bruise at his throat.
Steve is wrapped around him. All over him. Touching him everywhere and kissing him until he’s breathless. When he leans over him it’s welcomed and familiar, setting Tony’s senses on fire. There’s no fear here, and Steve is looking at him as if he’s the rarest gemstone on earth, all open awe and amazement.
Quiet moments pass and Steve focuses on the gentleness of Tony’s touch, sinking into it and drifting in the intimacy. After everything, he thinks he can still feel the love Tony has for him jumping from the tips of his fingers and working into Steve’s skin like a balm.
Steve gagged, his body moving of its own accord, carrying him back to the other corner of the bed as he stared at Tony and the distance between them widened like a chasm. Everything they’d had, all the love, all the trust, swirled and contorted into a whirlpool, circling down the drain until all that was left with Steve and his hands, dirty from where they had touched Tony’s sleeping, vulnerable body.
, that’s it darling, yes, you’re so gorgeous—never thought you’d want this in a million years and now you’re mine. All mine.”
Tony gives her a withering look, then proceeds to feel like human garbage as he thrusts the champagne glass off to a passing waitress and stalks off towards the exit. Pepper is so good to him, so kind and giving, and contrary to popular belief, Tony does know when he’s being an asshole and she doesn’t deserve to be treated like this.
Tony rolls off him, dragging the duvet up over them both. He curls towards Steve with one arm under the pillow and his cheeks rosy-red. “That was unexpected. Dinner’s going to be cold now.”
“C’mere sweetheart.” Tony blindly tipped his head at the request, following the hand that was gripping his chin and the soft voice directing him. “Oh fuck, that’s perfect. Just like that.”
A tentative tendril of hope peeks out between the carefully constructed shards of Tony’s shattered heart, wondering if maybe Steve is starting to see. To understand.
Peter lands next to them, dropping down into a crouch and scrambling across the dirt until he can get an arm around them both. His eyes scan Tony’s face, look into Steve’s eyes. He chokes on a sob and collapses into Steve, too.
He’s halfway to jabbing his finger into Steve’s face just as Steve stops taking steps backward and Tony almost bowls into him, hand smacking off his chest and the crisp fabric of his suit. He snatches it back and holds it against his body as if touching Steve has burned him, and maybe in a way, it has.
“I wish I could stay here forever.” Steve lets his head drop back against the pillows. He curls Tony closer to his chest. “Is that selfish of me?”
Thor starts to force the portal closed; a malfunction in the Bifrost that Steve can’t care less for, as long as he shuts it down and the aliens stop coming through. The whole situation is far too similar to New York and Steve finds himself shoving aside the visual of Tony falling, limp from the sky.
“Stark men are made of iron,” Clint interrupts over the comms, “isn’t that what he’s always telling us? He’s fine, Cap, as long as he can hear us. At least we’ll get a break from the comedy special.”
Tony looks at him, defeat laced with worry and a simmer of anger like he’s just taken his emotions off the stove to cool. “You should’ve called me. We’re supposed to be a team. We’re supposed to do these things together now.”
