and not even selfless intentions of helping. He had done all of this for a selfish desire to see his friend again.
"Yes."
With it out of their system, all that was left was a lazy Thursday morning, no appointments, no meetings, nowhere to be except to hide from the dreary weather. Steve took his time lining up and pushing in, relishing the feeling of Tony's velvety inner walls. Nothing felt more like home than being inside Tony.
"How do you know for sure?"
"I didn't expect this," he confessed, "I expected to find you and, I don't know, I guess have a happy reunion?"
Tony didn't even have a chance to answer. The train had stopped, doors opening, and Steve took the opportunity.
It was a bit too cold out to be sitting on the roof, and Clint cursed his own lack of foresight in not bringing a warmer coat with him. He shuffled his position, bringing his knees up to his chest and tucking his hands away, staring out into the early afternoon sky. It was quiet up there, which was what he was after.
"Whatever," Steve grabbed a piece of bread from the basket and tore it in two. "Bacon is delicious." He shoved half into his mouth, grinning at Bruce.
He wasn't fine.
that it's all Tony wants, all he can think about.
the one who helped clean him up.
"Like a little baby."
He always scrambled to pick it up, needing the mental visual of Steve on his knees behind him working him over with his tongue.
"Don't thank me yet. Here," Coulson hands Tony the pass and itinerary. "Plane leaves tomorrow at 8 am. We're flying to DC."
"We were attacked." Natasha spoke softly. "By aliens. A group of officials deemed it necessary to launch a nuclear bomb at Manhattan when it looked like they would win. The bomb would have taken out the whole city."
"I heard ya had a job. One that pays handsomely."
"Where he's not sick and not on the verge of depression?" Steve frowned, glancing away from Tony just for a second to shoot Natasha a loaded look.
Clint was seated at the island in the kitchen, pushing around a stray piece of cheese left on the table from their meal. "You
Steve fumbled, catching the bills as they slid from his chest. "You ain't never killed an innocent?"
He meets Clint first, and by God do they hit it off. Tony is completely annoyed with himself, but he
"Just a sec," Steve replied, checking a pot and giving it a stir. "Alexa," he called out, "set timer for twenty minutes."
Howard took the armchair across the room, sitting stiffly. "I don't think we've been properly introduced."
"It's Brucie," Tony explained while opening the door.
"Well, that didn't wake him."
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve really tried not to think about it.
But Steve did speak Tony fluently, after all. The return of the sarcasm meant the point had been comprehended. It meant that Tony understood. It wasn't a fix for his insecurities, but it was a start.
"It says that you searched for love in between the sheets because you couldn't find it anywhere else. It says that you drink to drown out the voices inside your head that tell you you’re worthless and unworthy. We all have demons, Tony. We all have things we're not proud of, things we try to hide. But, most of us didn't have to do it in the public eye, as you did. As you do."
Raising an eyebrow, Thor crossed his ankles. "Is that so?"
Tony turned, pulling Steve's neck down to kiss him deeply, swiping his tongue along in the inside of Steve's mouth. "Custom fits? I can certainly appreciate that."
"Go back to sleep, Tony," he said as he pulled his pajamas back on.
"Stay," Natasha said sternly, pointing at Howard and following Clint outside. Howard didn't move from his spot against the glass, still gleefully watching as the suit dismantled. She slid the door closed, hurriedly whispering to Clint, "Does Tony know you contacted him?"
He liked to say there wasn't much he was afraid of, but
Tony gave a tired chuckle, lounging back in the chair, "Yeah, that would be counterproductive." His stomach grumbled loudly, and Steve barked a laugh, bending down to kiss him, resting his hand on Tony's toned stomach.
Thor nodded, no other words needing to be said.
"No, you are an old geezer and I don't want to hear words like fam or lit coming from your mouth!"
"I know," he replied softly. "I'll work on that too."
"I hate magic."
"It was years ago, don't know why he still gets to me." Tony spoke into his water glass, taking a long gulp and setting it down before rubbing his eyes. "I swear he knows the power he holds over me too."
Howard sent him a contemplative expression. "Not yet."
Even like this, so wrapped up in busying himself, Tony was still a sight to be seen. Beauty amid chaos. That's how Steve saw Tony. Not just in that moment, but always. He was surreal, ethereal in ways Steve could never even find the words for. His brilliant mind like the Jackson Pollocks he adored, colorful disorder with no obvious reason until you actually stepped back and could see the whole picture. How order could be made from mayhem.
But Tony didn't smile back. He looked confused, a bit scared, and his deep brown eyes were wide with both emotions.
"Guys like what, what, what!" His attempt at twerking was atrocious.
"Steve?"
"Oh, I will."
"Uh, no?"
"Nick, what the hell are you sending me into?"
"Excellent," Tony says, looking up from the texts. "So, where am I going?"
"He still thinks it's me!"
"What can I do ya for?" Tony smirked, eyeing him up and down appreciatively. No one but James and his four bodyguards--Brucie, Tasha, Clint, and a man with no name that everyone just called Thor--knew of his leanings, even though he never acted on them. There was too much at stake to risk a frolic with a man.
so that when he did go back, he could be better. Do better. Give Tony the childhood he deserved and make sure that Tony, Steve - and the rest of the Avengers as well - were nowhere near New York when the shit hit the fan. At the very least, he could devise a way for them to win without the Iron Man armor, if his being a better father really did keep Tony from making it. See? It was foolproof! He just needed to hammer out a few minor details. Inconsequential, really.
"There's a chance it will die down enough if we're truthful. Howard could lead a definitively normal life after that." Standing, Bruce moved toward the kitchen. "I'm going to start dinner. I'm not sure how much more I can add here, and it's getting late."
"-But?"
. But what Tony had said hadn't yet sunk in. Howard was far too unnerved by the defensive movements his son was making. "I'm bisexual. Do you know what that means?" Another step backwards. Tony's eyes darted around, unable to look his father head on, the courage dulled at the edges.
"I keep trying to call him. It goes straight to voicemail. I…I can't-" It's like he's lost the use of his vocal chords. No other words are coming out. Sputtering, he chokes on air and wordlessly hands the phone to Bruce. He can't do it. He can't stand there and talk to Natasha, can't comfort her when he can't even comfort himself.
Tony barked a laugh at that, "Oh, am I?"
"I think we're all seeing that except for Steve." She sighed, and the sounds rushed through the phone. Pinching the bridge of her nose, she admitted softly, "I was too hasty to judge him, right?"
Natasha scoffed, "I'm not lugging out the deep fryer. We can make a salad."
Tony's legs clamped around him, his hands went to his back, nails digging in, and he moaned. "Fuck me!"
Which is, of course, when the call to assemble came.
"I should just leave you to freeze," but Steve was already gliding his hands down Tony's flanks to his hips, trailing from there to his thighs and knees, and lifting his legs to wrap around Steve's waist. They were still naked from their lovemaking the night before, a feisty and charged festival of endurance and want, sparked by another close call, another mission barely won.
As Steve bent his head to take Tony's lips on his, he knew: Not even the most famous poet in the world could put any of it into words.
Tony is not entirely sure what's going on. She's beautiful; he knows that, but under the gorgeous skin and wavy red hair is a killer. And that's...well, that's frightening. He'd like to go back to Clint now, thanks.
"Sir," Jarvis spoke up quietly, "I have a confession to make."
He paused, tucking his laptop under his arm, and studying Tony. "Why did you say that?"
"Oh yeah. Of course. I always take the subway. I know about about the subway. Public transit. Sure thing."
With a shrug, he went back to his desk and took a sip of tea. "Okay, let's do this."
"Oh. It's fine." Steve stood up from his seat on the ground. "I'm, uh, I'm going in."
"Howard, stop it!"
"Fuck," Tony muttered, pushing the vibrator in just a little deeper. What was it about Steve's hands that set him off so much? The long fingers, the strength behind them...the fact that he was impossibly strong but still so gentle. It sent a shiver through Tony's body.
"Promise, Pep."
A dame with some of the nicest stems he had ever seen wandered into view, and he looked up at her from his bent position, a flirtatious smile playing on his lips. "Antonio, there's a man at the front. Says he knows ya."
Tony turned, taking in her apron and nametag. "Yes, we are. You work here?"
Tony kissed his head gently as Steve panted, "I'm okay with you waking me up to do that whenever you want."
"He sounds just like him!" Howard exclaimed, his awe evident. "I mean you'd know better, you've known him longer, I'm guessing. Probably spent more time with him." He shrugged, a bit ashamed. "You obviously loved Jarvis quite a bit. And it shows. This," he pointed to the ceiling, "is absolutely astounding."
She sighed, knowing she wasn't getting much else done at that moment. "Yes," she relinquished, "I took the liberty of starting you guys in New Mexico, and you end in New York at the Jones Beach Theater. March 15th through September 12th, fifty-six dates, with some double shows."
He didn't want to fight with Steve. Hated it with a passion. The only time it was acceptable was when they had to assemble. They could bicker and argue about what to do and fight even more at the debriefing. And then they could leave it there. It helped to strengthen their relationship outside of the Avengers; the ability let out tension while in battle meant that the little tiffs they got into outside of that were usually talked out functionally. Calmly.
Howard turned to look at Clint, but he just snickered, "She's
"I keep thinking it's a joke, like hey! Let's fuck with Tony Stark again! Because the universe hates me."
"It's okay," Tony tries to comfort him; they all know this is the only way to keep the facade up that Tony didn't die, "I'll be fine."
if we can get you back in the Top 40 and onto the playlists of teenagers."
Steve laughed and kissed Tony's head. "Not that I don't want to be inside you," he let his own hands slide down Tony's back, "making you scream," his fingers dipped under the waistband of his boxers, "but I really need to pee."
"What are you going to do with it?" Tony slyly asked as Steve let the silk drop to the floor. He stepped out of them with much more grace, proud of himself until Steve leaned over and took the head of his cock into his mouth and Tony's knees buckled. "Oh fuck!"
"Something like that." Tony muttered, wound too tightly to correct him. "Listen, do you know if, I mean, does Steve...?" He trailed off, not sure how to phrase his question.
Two today since they're both short. I'll be back this evening with the other.
"Steve!"
"I'm a fan of
Sitting up, Tony laughed sarcastically. "It working?"
Enjoy the epilogue!
He had walked in on Steve and...
"I think Tony yelled at Steve for it though. He looked pissed when I saw him this morning." Placing her cup on the ground next to her, she folded her legs underneath her body and leaned on Clint. "Steve is being a bit, well,
"Hey, there's enough, right? For another plate?"
Avery entered a few minutes later, sitting on the stool after shaking their hands, smiling openly at Natasha. "My daughter idolizes you."
. And the five of them. No one else fit. The bridge was drawn and the moat filled.
Bruce licks his lips, his eyes watery. He looks stricken, something Steve has never seen on him. His voice is flat as he repeats the information he has like he's done this before, and he has. Nine times since the breaking news bulletin flashed across the television screen. "He called me this morning. Preflight checks on his personal plane came back with engine issues. He said he was taking Flight 328 out of Singapore at 10pm their time." Shaking his head, Bruce looks away. "I'm sorry, Steve. I wish it wasn't true. Tony was on that plane."
"So it's like the blind leading the blind?" Rhodey sighed, pinching the bridge of his nose. He hadn't always been so supportive of the relationship. Steve was like a thorn in his side for a time.
But everywhere he looked, he came up with more and more dead ends. He had tried hacking the account himself, but everything kept going wrong. His computers would freeze, the websites would crash, all stupid things that made no sense. It was his technology, for fuck's sake, why wasn't it working? He had even tried to get Jarvis to do it, begging the AI to 'Just hack the fucking account already!' But all he got was the run around.
In the workshop bathroom mirror, Tony checked his hair, he checked his shirt, his jeans, making sure no cake or cocoa had fallen on them. He smoothed down his goatee, picked at invisible lint on his shoulder, and rubbed a spot on his boots.
Tony was shaking, and Howard felt a pang at that. Two sides of him - one determined to love and accept Tony as is and the other filled with stalwart propriety - warred within him. He tried to call out again, to stop them as Steve led Tony back down the hallway. He couldn't. He couldn't move, couldn't find his voice. He stood rooted to his spot, watching as they entered Tony's suite, until the door closed, leaving Howard in darkness.
"Tony! What brings you to this neck of the woods?" He was smiling, beaming at Tony and his unexpected visit. In Tony's mind, he took a picture. He wanted to remember what could possibly be the last time that smile would ever be directed toward him.
to protect and save everyone.
"Like actually go into a store and buy stuff?" The face Clint made had Bruce chuckling.
And yes, they are."
"Are you two
"What Rhodey said, are you really against that?"
Steve just smiled and shook his head. "Point still stands. It's not about being worthy, Tony. It's about me loving you, and you loving me. And nothing else matters."
It wasn't like the old films he snuck into with Bucky. It didn't happen all at once. It was a slow, creeping sort of love. One that grew, like vines curving up a building, twisting up around him, from his legs, to his torso, then up around his heart.
told him this was Tony's best friend!
"Don't pull my leg, Tony, not right now." Steve's response is almost sad like he had a glimmer of hope before being crushed. Tony feels his heart skip a beat.
"That sounds boring and monotonous, you know, a life without
The battle is lost, and Tony dissolves. His sobs turn into wails as he beats his fist against the bedsheets. He's on his side, held up by one of his elbows. The sheets pool around his waist, t-shirt is riding up in that annoying way it does, and his pajama pants are bunching up around his knees even more annoyingly. How did he even get into bed? How did he get into his pajamas? How did any of this,
His hand dropped, and he dragged it back up, leaning his forehead on it. "Feels so good, oh god, oh fuck, please please please!"
"I could have acted like I didn't know him! I could have, I don't know!" He threw his arms up in frustration. "If I hadn't overreacted, we could have just told the others,
And then of course his traitorous stomach made its choice loudly. Very loudly. Steve's laughing didn't help, as Tony let his head drop down in defeat. "You at least owe me a blow job later."
kind of guy. He just liked to smash. And the Avengers let him.
"What are you saying?" Rhodey spat out, "That we encourage some form of paternal bonding between them? For the love of- Agent Romanoff, that man beat his own kid, he ignored him to the point where Tony feels like he has no other choice than to be
"A lot."
Steve kept the angle consistent, ramming into Tony's prostate, the smaller man's body nearly folded in half. "God, look at you," he moaned, leaning back to watch as Tony came undone, "you really are going to come on my cock, aren't you?"
," he said softly, ruffling the boy's hair and standing. "I hope you have a great rest of your day."
Another similarity then. His Stark, too, did not trust easily.
Steve shook his head, "I don't know. Hey," he pulled back, keeping his hands on Tony's shoulders, "why don't you take a bath, relax, maybe do some reading? You don't have to talk to him if you don't want to."
Aware that Thor had not been around and couldn't possibly know, she explained, "I went a bit off the walls pushing Tony and Howard together. I didn't stop to think about what Tony wanted, and neither did Steve. He did everything to keep them apart."
Chuckling, Clint looked over at her. "Vodka tonic for your thoughts?"
Steve was obviously conflicted, looking back and forth between the bacon and Tony. "You're making me choose between sex and food. Again. That's not fair." Tony smirked, trailing his hand down his abdomen. He was just about to touch himself when Steve snapped his eyes shut and swung around to face the stove. "Nope! Your wiles will not work on me, demon! Go! Be gone!" He wildly gestured in the vicinity of the bathroom, the spatula flapping up and down.
"She's a spitfire, but a good heart. If you're alive, it means she likes you. All right," he moved to the door, "let me get changed. Don't kill each other." He pointed back and forth between the two of them. "I really don't want to clean up all the blood."
Tony's smile was free and sweet, and he cupped Steve's face, leaning up to peck the tip of his nose. "I love you too. Let's never break up again. 0/10 would not recommend."
Steve volunteers. It is - for the most part - because he is the only one able to lift Tony with no difficulty. Thor can, but he isn't there. Tony needs stable arms to bring him to the bathroom, arms that won't jostle his ribs too much and can bear the weight as he is stripped and cleaned. Steve, of course, forgot about the stripping part.
"Oh, fuck shit. That hurts." His voice was pinched. "Oh no, oh no no no!" Steve could only follow as Tony ran to the bathroom and dropped to his knees. So much for feeling better.
Wrapping his arms around Tony's, Steve hugged him tightly and drew his lips into a kiss. "Surprise!"
He was surprisingly pleased to hear that, "That's pretty awesome!"
"You look very distinguished this night, Anthony."
"I wouldn't have, if it wasn't important."
"I don't eat Wheaties." Steve said, wrapping his hand around Tony's bicep and pulling him. Tony had no choice but to follow. "Come on, I want to see it!"
It took a second to get his body back under control. He had never felt this way before just by looking at someone. Steve wasn't an idiot, though. He knew relations between men were sinful and more than frowned upon. But that didn't stop him from appreciating the gorgeous man before him.
"Precisely."
"Pushy, pushy, Mr. Stark." But Steve obliged, pressing the tip of his finger just past the rim. "Have you done this before?" He leaned his head against Tony's leg, watching as his finger disappeared inside.
"Jesus, Rogers! It's about time!" Natasha snapped, pushing a sleeping Clint from her shoulder, "Bruce said you'd be right up!"
She had been filled in, albeit in drips and drabs, but she knew the Avengers were working on having his memories erased. Which she understood. Of course. On a logical level it made perfect sense to send a time traveler back with no recollection of what had happened, but on an emotional one, not so much. This was Tony's chance to have a good childhood. To have a supportive and loving father. Who knew what positives could come from this?
"You must be Bruce!"
Tony groaned, "How? How was that a favor?" He looked at his clothes, smears of come and lube stained the fabric. He had meant to wash them before touching his clothing, but obviously that didn't happen.
But Bruce ignored him. "Ask me what it's about?"
"Bit chewy though."
Natasha answered for him, "Tony got them all out before we got here. Can we shoot him now?"
"We have to walk past the peanut gallery first."
"Well fuck indeed."
"Join the club," Tony laughed. "Come here, I'll help you set it up. And get Jarvis on it for you."
"He'll come around," Tony said softly, and followed Steve down the hallway, leaving Howard alone in the living room.
It wouldn't be an hour, Steve knew Tony better than that. But he'd take all the time he could get to process this. It was a lot for both of them.
"He'll have to get scoped, as well." Bruce continued. "But this is good news!" Steve couldn't see how. "With celiac, all he'll have to do is go gluten free. Then he'll be back to the Tony we all know and love!"
to Bruce that he hadn't felt in a long time.
Tony handed Steve a plate with four of the hot dogs on it. "That's okay. JARVIS will have saved our spot. We can finish it later."
Steve snorted, "Don't ever call it 'randy' again."
The woman made a sad face, and Steve looked...
"Because I need you to understand, Tony." He senses Steve's hand before he feels it, sliding under his cheek and turning his face so Tony has no choice but to look at him. "I lost her. And it nearly destroyed me."
"You're right, it's not. It's
"You're going to let me sleep in another man's bed?" Tony said coyly.
"But they don't confide in me anymore."
"I think that settles it," Michael says, standing. "You'll get to continue being you. We don't know what's coming—and something is—but you will be an asset. That I know for sure."
With a sassy twist, Tony tilts his head up to look at Joseph. "You might want to fire your marketing department."
She tugged him so he faced away from the window, stepping around so their positions were switched, "This Howard is from 1961, Rhodes. Do you get what that means?"
"This," Tony began, choking back tears, and that was really annoying, was he seriously about to cry again? He swallowed, bringing himself back under some sort of semblance of control. "This is incredible."
"And you say you're not perfect."
"Where's ya mother buried?" He thought Tony wouldn't answer, he had no right to ask anyway.
"He didn't deserve you," Steve said evenly. "He didn't deserve you at all."
"Stop quoting movies!"
"I sent them to cool off their tempers." Hand out, Thor called Mjölnir to him. "I do not know where it is that they went."
All of this after Tony had curled up on Steve's lap on the verge of tears. They were supposed to be comforting him. Protecting him. Instead, they had been coddling him - no matter how much Tony had needed it - and spoke for him like he was incapable of independent thought. They should have known he wouldn't want it. Steve knew this, damn it, he knew Tony didn't like to be babied, that as much comfort as he allowed himself to receive he needed to counteract it in some way.
Blinking, Steve found himself standing in the middle of the living room, staring off into space. "Huh?" He felt hollow, like he was floating, disconnected from his body.
But the trees keep on dancing.
His voice was deep, like the roots of a mountain, steady and concrete, he held the harmonies up, never letting them fall. He was married with two daughters, Hedda and Katrine, two weirdly Norse names.
It was instinct, Bruce thought, that Steve's hand reached out to fold over Tony's. Bruce said nothing, but he did send a quiet prayer to a God he wasn't sure he believed in that no one was photographing them. Tony needed that physical touch.
Please think about leaving a comment, either to say if and what you want for a new interlude or to tell me that you love this story.  Seeing your comments gives me confidence to write!
When the elevator dinged, Howard straightened his back, stuck his chin out, and did what he could to raise his armor. No matter what, he would go down swinging. Proud.
"TONY! HOW ARE YOU FEELING?"
(See the end of the chapter for
"Hey, with the right marinade, that shit's delicious."
She looked far too disappointed. "That's boring."
And sometimes, she wondered if she could just get on the train one day and not come back. Didn't she deserve a bit of normalcy after everything she had been through? Why couldn't she go college at Stonybrook and work weekends at a Hollister? Why couldn't she share a tiny apartment with three other girls, draping scarves over the windows in lieu of curtains, and eating ramen noodles and toaster strudels. Crowding around the bathroom mirror on Saturday nights, trading lipsticks and eyeshadows, and
"I'm glad you're okay, Tony. Take care of yourself."
"I'm fine." Close and open and close and open and close…
"Well," she turned to appraise him, "We should probably stay away from anything that will make you vomit. I'm not in the mood to clean it up, and if you're anything like Clint, that's a definite." Over her shoulder, she gestured to the living room where the other man from the night before was still asleep on the couch.
Her phone beeped the incoming message and she called out to him through the doorway, "Steve's cooking for the two of them, think he wants to keep Tony away."
"JARVIS?" Steve yelled out over the alarm.
his inner voice was telling him.
"Steve!" Bruce felt his heart drop. He knew how much Steve loved Tony; he saw it every time he set eyes on him, but Steve could be really thick sometimes. His need to protect those he loved stemmed from losing everything he knew. Bruce understood that, but it didn't make Steve's actions always right. He was protective, but it could be suffocating, especially for Tony who had been on his own almost his entire life. Tony had a voice all his own, and he was never afraid to use it. Steve needed to understand that.
They stood outside the bathroom as he retched, Steve inside and trying to comfort him, the sounds making them feel like failures.

"I enjoyed it."
"Deal. But you deliver by Saturday. Or I'll skin you alive.
"Yes, now would you listen?"
"No, I fucking hate this." She groaned, tossing a piece back into the pile. "But I'm bored."
Please comment and let me know what you think!
"Call it anecdotal learning."
She sighed. "You really are an idiot."
"He was stunned silent, I think," Bruce was talking, peering up at Rhodey with unveiled concern. "Tony took it as a negative response, and really, can you blame him?"
Steve's pain from waking up so far removed from everything he'd known diminished more and more each day because he had a new family. New friends. A new life. A boyfriend who adored him. A home. Love. Comfort.
Taking her hand and letting her pull him up, he bent down to retrieve her coffee and handed it back to her. "Me too. Anything you want in particular?"
"I can't answer that, doll." He said carefully. "I don't know the answer. I know," he sighed, leaning down to press his forehead against Tony's. "I know that I don't want you to be disappointed when he turns out to be exactly who you think he is. I know I don't want you to get hurt."
With a grin, Tony said, "Doubt that."
Though half asleep, Tony grabbed one of the dry ones to wipe the water from Steve's own skin. The towels were pushed lazily to the floor and the blankets pulled up, Tony curling into Steve's chest.
"German. At two. I know just the place in the East Village. But first, breakfast."
"Are you kidding me right now?" Natasha balked, finally reaching out to pick up the thick folder.
Most of the Avengers merchandise in the tower he had bought; it had seemed so funny at the time. But gazing down at the ridiculous mug in the cool light of a March morning, his father asleep in the next room… It all felt so trivial. There were real problems in the world. And he was a lost and damaged man just trying to wade through it.
But Tony…
As twilight settled around Manhattan, they woke curled around each other to missed calls and hungry stomachs. Tony made sandwiches while Steve texted the others, telling them they were staying away for the rest of the evening and would remerge the next morning. It was a break both of them needed from the insanity of what was going on.
Clint shrugged, "Seems like it. She got Ty back on the radio, I wondered how that happened." Tony gave a shudder. "Shit. Sorry, didn't mean to say the devil's name."
This time, Tony didn't drape himself out on the lounger. Instead, he walked to a safe and bent down to open it.
Bruce's cheeky reply had Tony throwing his head back, barking a laugh, "Then maybe you should be a better cook!"
"I do not watch Gilmore Girls," Tony mumbled into Rhodey's shirt.
"Colonel Rhodes, good to see you." Bruce shook his head in confusion, "I didn't know you were coming."
"Spoil sport." But Tony didn't mind. He grabbed a cookie, tugging from Steve's arms, the soldier rolling his eyes as he did so. But seeing Tony willingly eat was wonderful.
He nodded, his body slightly tense at the thought of someone else touching it. But Steve was careful, sweet. He kissed the center, the scars around it, so reminiscent of one of the stories, but somehow so real. Tony wondered how long he had wanted to do that.
Steve clenches his jaw shut, pulling in air through his nose with fury. It's not a good look for him. "God, you're such a prick! It's a wonder I fell in love with you at all!"
"Aren't you the least bit curious?"
"Why does every conversation with you end up revolving around sex?"
this. Let me ask you a question." She leaned toward him, eyebrows raised. "If you were given a chance to make amends with your brother, would you?"
"That would be the general consensus, yes." Clint said, sitting up, "Look, do you take requests? You take them on the page, right? But I don't have time to comment, so face to face works better."
"Good night!" Steve said instead of responding, taking Tony's bicep and leading him to the elevator. The genius stumbled a bit before catching his feet and trailing after him, not like he had a choice.
"Poor thing," Clint stage whispered, leaning his elbow on Bruce's shoulder. "Plum tuckered out."
He's so tired. "Petra said I had to hide."
Just one night, that's all he wanted. One night to tell Stevie Boy what to do to make him come. Suck him. Fuck him. Eat him. He'd give anything for it.
"Yeah, but that one sounds like
"That's...not reassuring." Tony knows how Clint's going to take that statement. He's going to laugh, thinking he's told Tony he's got quite the job in front of him, but the truth? Coulson and, by extension, Tony are in charge of keeping two of the agents here safe; a lack of proper brains working on their weapons and the safety of their uniforms is disconcerting at best.
"I feel more optimistic than I think I normally would, especially about what you're saying."
Her shoulders sagged in concession, "I know," she answered quietly, "but it's kinda hard to separate."
Tony picked his head up at that, watching as Steve sat next to him, "Oh, yeah?" He made no move to right his body. Steve had to remind himself oftentimes that that man he loved, while an absolutely brilliant engineer, genius, and billionaire, was actually an adult. It was
"If you'll excuse my language, fuck propriety. Now-" Bruce turned to Thor, "-when is the pizza coming and for the love of all things good in the world, tell me at least one doesn't have pineapple on it."
been trapped in here for days."
"All in good company, I assure you."
Shaking his head, Coulson looks sad. "No, Tony. I did not."
Being friends with him is better than nothing.
"Oh, no, that's still there."
"That sounds like wonderful news?" Perplexed, Howard tried to move closer again, but Tony stepped back until he was standing in the doorway, the frame casting a shadow across half of his face. "Tony?"
"Oh no, it's time to get up. Rise and shine, honey bear!" With one strong pull, the blankets were ripped off his body.
His head falls back against the pillow. "So they say."
"Clint called you?" The voice was too little to belong to Tony Stark.
Natasha really needed to learn that threatening civilians never led to anything productive.
. Including his temper. He
Steve knew he really wasn't all that funny. But the tense situation had Tony unknowingly seeking any type of positive release. Regardless, seeing Tony laugh set his mind at ease. They'd get through this, one way or another.
"Thank you." It was a start. Tony wasn't even close to
She laughed, the sound crisp in the air. "Sure. It's not going to help you figure it out. He'll be forty-four at the end of May." With that, she left the kitchen in a sprint, and the only evidence of what she was doing was the unmanly squawk of Clint, followed by a whole lot of cursing.
Steve gasped, feeling the tightening around his cock. His hands jumped from hips to waist, thumb and fingers splayed across the svelte expanse. He could feel Tony quivering under his fingertips, shaking from the post-orgasmic high and the continued pleasure as Steve kept thrusting, still catching his prostate on every pass.
"You're at the tower. It's late, but you're safe. We love you. You're going to be okay."
But like anything clandestine, it had to come to an end and he stood, helping Tony to his feet and wiping him with his own ruined waistcoat. Tony laughed, a pure sound, and kissed him again.
This is a longer one than usual! And also one of the reasons for the E reading!
"Natural History. Tomorrow at 2 work?" The door opened, and Steve watched as Tony came out, balancing a tray of steaks in one hand and two more beers for him and Steve in the other. Steve stood; he’d let Tony make the salad -- it was hard to mess up chopping vegetables -- but there was no way he was letting Tony anywhere near the grill. "Hill got those books too.  She's going to drop them off on Friday."
"I really am sorry," he refused to break eye contact once it was established again, "but if you tell me Tony is going to bleep out of existence, I won't accept it. I will work until my death to keep him here."
It's as they're leaving the headquarters that Coulson pulls Tony aside. His face is pinched and worried; it immediately has Tony on guard.
"You're incorrigible."
"From what I hear, Miss Potts, there is no one more formidable than you. If Tony trusts you, then I do as well."
Tony smirked, self-satisfied, and walked to the door. "Excuse me, I have to go get the butter and salt." A well aimed tomato hit the back of his head.
the scared voice of the elder Stark spoke up.
"I'll do it." Three sets of eyes swivel to stare at Tony. He swallows and repeats himself. "I'll do it. Don't worry about the funding. I'll pay. And I can probably improve on whatever radar you have so we don't dive unnecessarily. It'll take a weekend. Maybe three days." He musters up a grin. "It'll be fun."
His superior chuckled, "I don't envy you the messes Stark creates, just the fact that your best friend is a billionaire genius. Those come in handy."
Steve's smile - as forced as it was - faltered. "You haven't eaten anything Tony," he gently chastised, "you need something in your stomach."
"You've reached the automated answering system of Tony Stark's Masturbation Hot-line. Please leave a message after the beep." he paused for dramatic effect. "Beep."
"This is the bridge from that fanfiction." Steve said quietly. But it wasn't said as a question. It was a statement. Like Steve knew they were headed there.
"I'm fine. Lunch will do me good. Though I find myself surprised you'd willingly leaving the tower again. That's three times in, what? A week?"
"Zen?"
She shook her head, "Stevie, don't go getting mixed up with the wrong crowd. My life ain't worth it."
"ARE YOU AWARE THAT YOU'RE SENDING A BAD MESSAGE TO YOUNG TEENS ABOUT BODY IMAGE?"
"What," Howard swallowed, "what did he do to you?"
"What about that dame you got? The Widow?"
She unwrapped a piece of chocolate for herself, popping it into her mouth and chewing thoughtfully before answering. "But it's still making you angry."
"Did he just-?!"
"Not sure what Clint got out of it though." Laying back against the pillows, Steve reached over to slide Tony closer, tucking his arm around him and pulling him to his chest. Tony settled in without even waking. It was a testament to his complete trust of Steve, and that was nice to see, even if Bruce
"I can't even be mad," Tony said around a mouth full of cookies, "I've been torturing him for years with the lascivious details of my
"Explain what?" Tony snapped, rubbing the washcloth along his front before bringing it around to wipe his backside. "That you
"I was getting worried there," Tony laughed, letting his legs fall open. "Everything okay out there?"
There were cheers, the mood lifting high up above them. Tony righted himself and finished, his voice light. "I've brought some friends along with me," he pointed to the rest of the Avengers. "There's a free photo-op scheduled for 8pm. And I'm sponsoring a fundraiser event for the fall, a completely gluten free carnival. All proceeds to go to the NCA.
He blanched at that. They were so caught up in their own discussions they hadn't realized just what they were revealing. "Ah, no."
So, Steve didn't interfere.
A trip to the market meant getting dressed, and Bruce slugged on a pair of khakis and a polo. He didn't bother with the mess of curls on his head, only threw on his shoes and jacket, and grabbed his cellphone and wallet on the way out. He didn't leave the tower often, mostly he just ordered what he needed from JARVIS and had everything delivered. There was no room in the world for a man with a giant green problem.
Slipping his hands under Steve's shirt, Tony pushed it up. "I just said I wanted you. Get your hearing checked, old man!"
"Don't what?" Howard asked, the smile slipping from his face. What was last night then, if Tony still disliked him?
"Something wrong, Rogers?"
"Rogers!" Bruce covered his face, laughing hard, "It's a saying! Oh God, please stop!"
"All whole. Though one is deaf."
"I think that goes for us all. But is it
These days, he still refused outright physical affection from others, but he craved it from Steve. Especially that slow, loving rocking. Tucked tightly into Steve's arms, the only place he ever felt he belonged.
Clint is inches away. "Hey, food's ready. You hungry?"
She smiled, "Will that be all, Mr. Stark?"
"That's a great idea, I'm starved!" It was forced, but Tony was grateful for Steve's attempt as well.
It was. Without Howard tackling the lunatic, he would have shot Tony with the crossbow point blank and instead of joking with a civilian paramedic, Tony wound be laid out on the street. Dead. Steve looked down, shifting his shield from one arm to the other. He had been so messed up in his own head that he couldn't even act. Howard had saved Tony's life.
"I'll find clean clothes for you," she offered, lingering in the doorway a while later, "and we'll get you toiletries and whatever else you need. For now, stick to the guest room, the kitchen, the living room, and the bathroom. You can go to the landing pad if you need fresh air, but don't go anywhere else."
"I'm sure."
"Not yet," Rhodey answered, "but he's no idiot. If we don't tell him, he'll figure it out."
). Cuddled together for warmth in the dead of winter, talking in hushed voices of their dreams, how they were going to get out of the tenement apartment they lived in and make something of themselves. How Bucky always knew when Steve was in trouble. How Steve always knew when Bucky needed a little extra support. How they complimented each other, like two colors opposite on the color wheel.
"Sweetheart?" he gently prodded when Tony made no move to continue. "What were you wrong about?"
"That's mean." He turned enough to point in her face. "You're mean!"
Clint was quiet, his good mood gone when he thought about Tony. "Something's gotta give, man. Even the media is noticing. They're saying he has an eating disorder."
"Your father–" Hill almost spits out, and damn, what's her problem anyway? "–didn't have the technology that we have."
"How much?"
"Nothing!"
Tony could feel the shiver that ran through Steve's body. "You did?"
Tony winces in sympathy. "That's…you know what? I have no pithy response to that."
"Tony’s going to freak." Natasha said.
The soldier was red with his giggling. "What? Technically, I'm still in my mid-twenties!"
"You're annoying."
. Stopping the cycle of horrible childhoods with the empire he was building himself. He'd have a legacy to pass on, unlike the drunk bum who had knocked his mother up and spent every penny they earned down at the local pub.
There is a pause, and Steve is amused to see Tony snickering, the sound is like wind chimes dangling in the sunlight. JARVIS speaks again, his voice smug. "Saint Jude's thanks you for your generous donation of your gaming devices, Agent Barton. The children will be so happy."
Steve didn't need to be told twice. He threw the vibrator aside and pushed Tony off of his lap and onto his knees, dropping behind him and pulling his own cock out. He blindly grabbed for the lube he had used earlier and slicked himself, dropping the bottle and slamming into Tony with a loud grunt, wasting no time in a build up, just taking. Fucking the willing body beneath him with an abandon that sent Tony back to his elbows, his ass popped up and open.
"All part of my charm." He flashed Howard his brightest smile. "I'm infuriating. Just ask Director Fury. Hey!" He pointed to Dum-E, changing the subject to something lighter. "How did you end up getting dragged into playing fetch with Dum-E anyway?" Not that Tony could blame him. His robots were the best. And if Dum-E already had Howard wrapped around his claw…
"Yeah, but Thor is a cuddler. He could be very comfy."
Let me know what you all think and what you'll would like to see if there's a continuation of this!
And all the more dangerous considering the temper of the Other Guy.
"Natasha…"
"Good." She said, then turned to the three fans who
"Fine," Bruce sighed, "bacon and eggs. That's it. I have work to do."
As soon as he caught his breath, he was grabbing for Tony, tugging him up to crash their mouths together, licking along the inside and tasting himself. "Your turn."
She turned toward Clint, for once letting every bit of anguish she felt show in her eyes. Fuck her reputation,
replied: What about the pool in the gym? It locks from the inside. LMFAO
She huffed, amused, and took the cup, settling back against the pillar. "At least I didn't scream like a little girl."
"Did you eat?" Tony's voice was raspy and exhausted. He prodded the egg yolk with a fork.
She glared at him, narrowing her eyes and leaning in threateningly. She knew that he understood she would never intentionally hurt him, but reminding him that she could went a long way sometimes. "I never wanted this family, but I sure as hell will protect it."
It wasn't much longer, the heat had built too greatly over the course of their lovemaking, the need over the duration of their knowing each other. His hips seized momentarily as he tumbled over the edge, his orgasm rocking his entire body, coming into Tony, filling him, still thrusting, though less controlled, the fucking so deep that some of it was pushed out through the force of it. His whole body was shaking as he came back down, his movements finally slowing to a stop.
Clint mumbled under his breath but forked over two twenty dollar bills and an extra ten in tip when Natasha elbowed him.
"About 220 million tons of old computers and other electronics are thrown away in the United States each year," Tony said cheekily.
"I already told you, bubble wrap. And lots of it."
"It's Murphy's Law, Steve, really!" Wheeling away from Steve's hold, he moved back to the bench, picking up the helmet and pointing to it, "What can go wrong, will go wrong. And someone needs to think of these things before they happen!"
Shaking his head, Tony strides forward and envelops him in his arms. "It's okay. I took them out. I took them all out! All the weapons...everything." Yinsen is hugging him back tightly, and his voice is warbly when he speaks again.
"I don't know, Pep," Tony said quietly, "been throwing up."
"You as well. I know this is unconventional, according to Michael, but I appreciate your patience." He jogs down the steps to the center of the room and shakes Coulson's hand.
Thor hummed in agreement. "In which case, we have time to convince this Stark to change his - how do you say? Your colloquialisms confuse me - Ah yes, to change the tune of the song he is singing. Barton," he put his hand on the archer's shoulder, "take Romanoff somewhere so the two of you can quell your tempers. Return the day after tomorrow. I will handle Howard Stark."
to control everything. It wasn't u
"Jarvis," he groaned, "screen above me. You know what to do."
This was
Steve likes how he says 'mutz' instead of mozzarella. He's only ever heard it in cities that boast a large Italian population, but the way it rolls off Tony's tongue is both adorable and attractive. "Definitely extra on the pickles."
"It's a bouncing baby boy. Howard, you
She grumbled, several words in Russian rolling off her tongue. With a hard kick to the railing that had Clint wincing, she sighed. It was true. He
you can make the charts. That's a decidedly younger crowd. It could be good for you."
With a tilt of her head, she smirked. He was a bastard who abused her best friend, but he was still a force. There would be no Stark Industries without him building it, and she had to respect him for that if nothing else. He knew how to get straight to business; with Howard Stark, there was no pussyfooting around.
"It has been five months since I have been here." Thor said, his eyebrow raising, "I seem to remember it being Steven's turn."
His appearance has always been his real armor. If he looked confident; he felt confident.
"What's wrong, sweetheart?"
Clint visibly gulped, trading one last look with Bruce before turning to his captain. "Because… we took such good care of Tony that he'll rather be with us!"
nearest and dearest that it meant he was Tony's. Even though the other man had never given him reason to doubt that Tony felt the same way.
"Okay, well. Good night." It was stiff, and Tony glanced back and forth between them, watching as Howard let himself out.
The smoke in the speakeasy was overwhelming. Swirls of it curled around the patrons, dancing in the dim lights and fluttering around the tea cups and coffee mugs filled with moonshine. Tony "Bright Eyes" Stark sat surrounded by his business associates, one leg up over the arm of the chair he was on, the other tapped on the floor along with the music blaring from the last minute band. He was waiting for someone, though it was anyone's guess who, and sucking on cigarette after cigarette, sipping on soda water, and ignoring the Candy Girls who giggled and flirted with him. He just wasn't interested.
"Of all the people to like," Bruce muttered to himself, "you choose the most complicated." It was true, but only half so. Bruce had a feeling that the Other Guy took to Tony not only because Tony was the only one not afraid of him off the bat, but also because
"Not possible," it was Tony, sauntering in to refill his coffee, "I have fake files on record." He paused. "Wait, why?"
. "I've got coffee in your Captain America travel mug—by the way, that's so sweet I think I just got a cavity—and lunch reservations at Gino's. We need to have a talk."
At least he remembered to wash his hands.
As soon as he was out of earshot, Steve left the steaks to cook and walked over to pluck the lettuce from Howard's hair. "Having trouble with the salad, Howard?"
As much as Pepper wanted to hate him, this Howard had redeemed himself with those words. "Yes, I believe you're right. The decision is Tony's, I'll stand by that. By him." They would be angry with her, but at the end of the day whether or not Howard returned with his memory intact or not was not up to them. "Tony is the smartest man I know, Mister Stark. He'll make the right decision."
"You better." Steve's hand snaked around Tony's body, and the only tell to what he was doing was Tony's breathy gasp and the slow widening of knees.
Tony had more patience with Steve than he had with anyone else, but he was still Tony Stark. He still wanted answers, but he
"You too, huh?"
"I can do that." Tony flirted, lifting his body up so he could kiss him deeply. Steve felt his breath catch. God, Tony was good at that. He moved, sliding over to maneuver Tony beneath him and settling between his legs. Tony mewed softly, lifting his hips and seeking friction as Steve sucked down his neck.
"What do you mean
Tony just shrugged, "Doesn't matter. They made up for it," he said, indicating his mother, Jarvis, and Ana. "It wasn't all bad."
Steve's heart ached. "Okay, Tony, but you have to promise to eat later." Tony nodded. "Anything you want to do today?"
She shrugged. The heaters were on. She found it pleasant and not overbearing, but she could understand how someone not raised in the harsh winters of Russia would still find it cold. "So why did you come?"
"How can I be a pest and an angel all at once? That's contradictory." Tony's eyes narrowed slightly and he slid one of his hands around Steve's waist, pulling gently.
And even then, that was blurry; it was like he was several different people in one and none of them were Tony Stark. None of them were at all familiar, and, not for the first time, Tony wondered at Steve's patience and understanding of him. The months through his sickness had been long and not at all easy to deal with. Tony knew that. He knew he was irritable at times, and others his mood would slam down and vanish like the contents of his stomach.
Once the sound of the door clicking shut was heard, Tony fell back against the mattress. "Tease," he grumbled, though a smirk played on his face. Steve would pay for that.
It was a few hours later when Tony noticed the light was dimming and checked his watch. "Oh shit, it's almost five."
"Dirty mouth." He trailed open mouth kisses down Tony's back, spreading him open before giving just one long lick, causing Tony to cry out in want. "Patience, angel." He kept the lube in a box on the nightstand, and it was quick retrieval, though not quick enough as he ran his thumb up and down Tony's hole and listened to the incredible begging from below him.
The room was quiet, like the breath before a storm, waiting for him to say the words most knew were there.
"Not just you."
Turning away from the skyline, Howard looked at least a little abashed, although not by much; he was still Howard Stark, after all. Steve was at once both amused and angered.
With a kiss, and his hands on either side of Steve's face, Tony spoke in a husky voice. "Come in me, Steve. Fill me up. I want to feel you. Oh, God, Steve, I love you so much!"
before you just
Mischief not even close to being managed, so please comment and let me know what you think!
Those conversations had usually started at the end of a bottle. With Tony drinking so much to try and suppress the memories that after all that, after getting shit-faced, they had been all he could think about. The unkind words from his father were just the beginning. When the subject did get breached, it was only bits and pieces to a much larger puzzle that Rhodey had to build over the years.
Unwillingly, Howard sat. Standing felt better, but he was pretty sure his knees were going to give out. "I don't understand."
And he was okay with that.
"Later?" Steve asked, hopeful as he set the glass back onto the tray.
Fuck. Guess it was time to rub one out. Again.
The chatter dies away as the attention falls on Steve. He smiles at them, meeting each of their eyes one at a time before landing on Tony's.
Bruce grabbed his bags and the receipt, racing to the door.
And he couldn't have him.
She was a bit taken aback by the passion they spoke with. These were five guys who
"Uh, thanks." Clearing his throat, Steve concentrated on putting one foot in front of the other, looking forward to his bed and Tony, but as he passed Howard's still form, he stopped, turning to the other man, his face pleading. "Don't hurt him."
"It's complicated."
. You have
Tony stayed quiet after that, contemplating what Rhodey had said and slowly making his way through his dessert and (admittedly very good) espresso. After he scooped the last of the ice cream from the plate, he sat back, feeling, well… Feeling satisfied. Feeling good. It was new. Unheard of for him. This wasn't anything he was used to, but he liked it.
"I'd like to make a toast to the New Year. To friends, to found family, and to new love." There's a murmur through the group, and they stare openly at Tony then at Steve. "We figured you all knew. So, might as well make it official." If at all possible, he's grinning even wider, and Tony feels the ghost of a blush crawl up his neck. Standing, he takes Steve's hand.
😈 I know I insinuated lighter. I lied.
Tony grins widely. "You know it."
"Once, in college. Never deemed anyone else worthy. But-" Moaning, Tony gripped under his knees, pulling his legs up wider. "-I like to fuck myself with a mounted dildo."
"Why are you here, Howard?"
Open and close. "Yeah."
Dropping back into the armchair, Clint plucks his phone from the charging dock on the end table, scrolling through to find the menu.  "I'm always down for a diner-burger, Cap."
"So you said." His grin was devilish. A good look on him. "And how sensitive is that prostate, really?"
He looked away, eyes shadowed by his own past. "You know I would."
"Because I'm smarter than you."
When their food came, they ate in companionable silence for a few minutes, before Natasha took up the previous conversation. "No one has the right to touch you without your consent, Tony, even if it's a nonverbal one. You don't have to explicitly say yes to someone putting their hand on your arm, but some jackass grabbing your bubble butt? No, they don't get to do that unless you expressly say they can."
Natasha was grinning, but her eyes were dark. She held onto Steve's arm as he tried to escape, managing to hold him for a few seconds before he broke free and bolted. She threw her head back and laughed.
"Gotta go." Tony blushed, and
Ria Rose - 3136 - K5 - Asking for Trouble
"Oh, uh, sure." This was the part of being in the Avengers he couldn't get used to: People who weren't nearly as afraid of him as they should be and the heroics of it all. Natasha sometimes felt the same way. They were the bad guys for so long that it was startling to think they were admired in any way.
"Bye, Clint!"
was the first step.
been trying, but damn it all, he needed an outlet. Even if he knew he might regret it later. He stood and took two steps toward Howard and mustered up every drop of confidence he could. It wasn't much, but it was enough to allow him to stand up tall, roll his shoulders back, and snap at Howard.
"Hey, Tones. Heard you're having a rough time."
Steve ignored the exclamation, "You're so fit but it's still so soft."
"They're good at finding out things like this," Tony grumbled, "the truth? They couldn't find it if it bit them on the ass."
Tony was honestly shocked with himself. It was rare indeed that he was able to go for round two, but in the water, his cock was swelling. And he could feel Steve growing harder behind him.
To the Put on the Suit -- the Stony discord server -- for just being a whole slew of positivity and cheering.
The end.
"Too late now," he said, moving forward to the sliding doors. Howard looked over at him as he passed. "Is that him? Is that the robot?"
"You said that." She spoke softly, coming to stand by the bed and studying her friend. He followed her with his eyes, looking for all the world like a deer in headlights.
Steve scoffed, "Logan, obviously. Rich kid with a big heart? What's not to love?"
Howard seemed torn between laughing and amazement. "You programmed an A.I. to speak with no difficulties and the ability to be a smart ass?"
Tony moaned, his hands coming up to grip Steve's shoulders, "What? Ah- Fuck that feels good."
"I bet you that as soon as I touch you here, your eyes will close, thus proving that this-" he pointed to Tony's hole, "-is connected to these." His finger trailed up through the air to point to Tony's eyes.
"And fought a battle."
battles for me." He ripped his pants up off the dresser with an angry flourish and slipped them on, not even bothering with his underwear.
"Mr. Stark," Rhodey said coolly. He was considering what Natasha had said, but it still didn't mean he had to be friendly with the guy.
"I don't want to be a statistic. But there it is."
"That's great, except for the whole part about being one of hundreds if not thousands that have seen that."
"He took a little girl from my old neighborhood in Queens, snatched her right up, and sold her to some perv down in Washington. By the time we tracked her down to bring her home, the man she was sold to had raped her to death."
"I'm saying-" Fury's face was open and honest, and Tony didn't know how he felt about that, "-that we control the outcome of the narrative. This is what we have to work with, we play the cards we're dealt."
With a confused frown, Steve looked down at Tony. "You okay?"
Tony balked, "Okay super serum, whatever you say!"
"Fury is en route as well," Clint continued, looking from Bruce to Thor, "and we have info on the spell Howard used."
Young. Full of piss and vinegar. His first love.
He can't help himself. He asks, "But what?"
"Sounds less complicated to me." Tony chuckles, gesturing to the table. "Look at these delinquents!"
Welcome to the final chapter! This is it, save for the epilogue that will go up next week!
"Coffee?" He asked, standing and taking his mug to the coffee machine. He didn't wait for an answer, just pulled another mug from the cabinet. "You must be Pepper Potts." Glancing over his shoulder, he waited until she nodded in affirmation before turning back to the counter. "How do you take your coffee, Miss Potts?"
He laughed outright at that. "You're good for me."
"I let my anxiety and stress and- and, well frankly… my daddy issues get in the way. I should have never broken up with you. I've made a lot of stupid mistakes in my life-" He barked out an embarrassed laugh, "-especially for being a genius. Stupid, stupid mistakes. But the worst… the worst was letting you go."
He looked up as Tony entered, wincing at the movement. "Tony," he said in greeting.
"All I have are questions."
It was a perfect release. Throwing his head back, Tony howled, joined a moment later by Clint. Two adult men - superheroes at that - howling at the moon. He was sure the press would have a field day. But rule number one of illegal explosions: Turn off all electronics. Rules numbered two through eight-hundred-and-sixty-four: Don't talk about Fight Club.
He spun around, "Where are they?"
She shook her head, even if she knew he couldn't see it, "No, I will. Steve and I need to have a real discussion about both of our behaviors."
"Why is this upsetting me?" he exploded. "Why do I even care that he's here? I didn't need him then, and I sure as fuck don't need him now!"
"I can try."
When Tony returns just over 5 minutes later in his heavy winter coat, scarf, hat, gloves, and snow boots, he half expects Steve not to show. But he's there by the elevator, wrapping an obscenely long scarf around his neck. His eyes are still a little red but dry, and he sends Tony a small but warm smile as he approaches.
"You!" Howard could barely get the words out, "You are going to be so much fun to tease."
And Tony chuckles good-naturedly. "Surveillance, equipment, computers, security, vehicles… Things like that."
"I don't want to be sick anymore." Tony spoke in a hushed voice, leaning his forehead on Steve's chest. "I'll go to the doctor."
"Is it always this quick?" He gestures to the room around them.
"JARVIS," Pepper asked quietly as she stepped into the elevator, "how is Tony holding up?"
Six figures, obviously in the aftermath of a battle, stood staring out toward the camera, combat weary and dirty, but proud. A large green thing in the back - a bit frightening to be honest; a beautiful redhead who looked just as dangerous as Howard liked them; a red and gold robot with glowing eyes; a man clenching a bow with his arrows just barely visible on his back; an imposing man wielding a huge hammer with long blonde hair; and Steve. In his full Captain America uniform, cowl pushed back, shield hanging from his hand. It was a newspaper clipping, taken from what Howard could guess as the front page because of its size.
"That's morbid."
Tony gave him a scathing look at the usage of his full first name. "I was only hurting him."
"Maybe, but wouldn't he question that I'm never in here then?"
"Steve," she began, but he cut her off.
Raising her eyebrows at the greeting but still smiling, Natasha took his hand as well. Tony was a handful. Always had been. Rehab twice for alcohol addiction, one stemming from a DUI, two arrests for bar fights, and a whole charade of bad publicity relationships. But she also knew he came from a broken and abusive home, and there were those rumors about Obie Stane…  Regardless, he had boasted recently about being over ten years sober and hadn't had an incident in almost as long. Could be worse. Another lead in the group, with a voice she had heard compared to that of an angel with a smoking problem. He was smooth and raspy in places, and in others his voice rang out like church bells. He was single, but probably had some kids out there. Maybe. Most likely. If it looks like a slut and acts like a slut…
"Oh." Tony sits back, thinking. "Because they had my weapons; because they were bad people. Because...Because I didn't want anyone else to get hurt."
Howard watched Steve's retreating form with an affronted look on his face. This was certainly not how he had planned on meeting Steve again. He didn't know who the other man was, he'd barely gotten a good look at him either, but he must have been important for Steve to take off like he did.
But the idea was enticing.
"What the fuck did I just hear?"
"The leftovers will be appreciated. Got all that, Jarvis?"
Twelve Months
"Rimming, Tony. It's about rimming." And Tony could hear the self-satisfied grin through the line.
"Then, Mr. McFly, I think it's safe to say that he gets back somehow, and we figure it out."
She places his file into a different container, and it pops away. "That's it! They'll have everything you need, even if you decline."
"Banner, Barton, I'm serious. Don't do this again."
"Hey, hey! It's okay, listen to me." Pressing his lips to Tony's head quickly, Steve tightened his hold and spoke softly. "Bruce is going to figure out how to erase his memory of this, SHIELD didn't even question it, because he's the best at this stuff, Tony, you know that. And Nat and Clint are working on finding that spellbook."
Steve ignores JARVIS' response, too focused on Tony, scooting down the couch to gently tug him up.
Tony tuned them out, moving back to the counter to pour himself a cup of coffee and make tea for Steve and Bruce. They were trying hard to distract him - and it was mostly working - but he found himself thinking once again of his father.
"Tony Stark! How
lose Tony as well.
"Don't look so surprised."
"-Miss Romanoff," that was Bruce, "no offence, but we stopped caring about relevancy about fifteen years ago."
"What's going on?!" Steve pulls him into a hug again, burying his face in Tony's hair. "We thought we lost you!"
"You young whippersnappers, with your Starbucks and your yeets!"
"Mind what?"
Bruce looked up sharply at her words, his head swinging around to look at Nat and Clint. "How did she-"
"Impressive!"
Tony was quiet at that, his eye catching a photo of himself sidestepping a rather pushy looking paparazzi, head down as he judged the curb he was jumping to, right next to him was Steve, bright like the sun, and looking at Tony.
"Who?"
With a sigh that could rival Tony's at his most annoyed, he sat up and swung his feet over the edge of his bed. It was a small price to pay for keeping the Other Guy at bay.
a genius - that there's always a method to my own madness. Maybe I was," he shook his head, eyebrows raised in admittance, "down here because I was avoiding Howard. And you. But something
Tony's knees went weak. He had kissed countless people in his years, and none had sent such a voltage through him. How could one person cause so many emotions to flutter within his chest?
"It was fine at first. I mean, I tire quicker. But I'm grounded now." He shrugged like it didn't bother him, but Avery and Steve knew better.
meant that Howard had to be really careful about every move he made when Bruce was around. Any little thing could set him off. And smashing
"You have a day job?" Pushing away his plate because Coulson had frankly given him too many pancakes, Tony raises an eyebrow. "Wait, the facade of being normal. Never mind."
That drew a laugh from Steve, and he pulled off Tony's boxers and pajamas in one motion, dropping his head down to take him into his mouth. Tony keened, hands going to Steve's hair, head pressed back against the bed. Steve brought him to the brink before backing off, watching as Tony's head thrashed back and forth, and dipping down to do it again. Teasing and teasing until Tony's body shook under his palms, and he was almost sobbing with need.
Steve felt his heart drop. Tony had every right to be mad. They were bickering and yelling like he wasn't there. They couldn't have screwed up any worse if Howard had actually been in the room.
"Like glitter after a lap dance."
Steve barely had a second to react as the dragon heaved a deep breath and let loose a roaring stream of fire. He ran and jumped, launching himself off of an abandoned taxi onto an awning, just missing getting singed and swaying to regain his balance. "Iron Man! Sitrep!" Across the street, a building burned, glass from the storefronts and apartments above shattered on the streets. It had to have been the explosion he and Tony felt, and Steve prayed silently that no one was inside when it happened.
"Mmkay."
Howard was finding it hard to swallow. The rushing was back, and his face was hot. "I need--
Also, yes, is this a fic within a fic? Fiception? Yeah, probably. Will Leonardo DiCaprio make an appearance? Probably not.
"What do you want from me?"
"So desperate for companionship you'll come to Captain America for company, Tony?"
Tony laughed as he turned toward the cupboards, wiping his eyes and snagging two dessert plates. "You know, I knew someone like you in college. He would get stoned off his ass and make anything and everything sound like the most delicious fucking thing in existence."
Not a single one held more interest to him other than the idea that maybe, just maybe, he could be with Steve.
saying yes, just to be clear," Tony asserts before Michael can respond. "Absolutely yes." He makes grabby hands for the books. It's an impulsive decision, he knows, but he's got all the info, and he knows what's what. He wants to help. He wants to save people. He wants to make up for every mistake made and then some.
"I'm here." A voice by the door said, and Nat wheeled around to see Rhodey leaning against the frame. "Haven't seen Bruce or Thor, and according to JARVIS, Howard is reading in the guest room."
"I need to talk to Steve."
"Steve, I want you to hear me-- oh shit! Sorry!" He was definitely not expecting Steve, distinctly post coitus, in bed with someone. He laughed loudly. Steve's bed sat with its head against the wall to his left, and he had a side view of the couple scrambling to hide.
She was in his closet, pulling out a suit. "No time to shower. Fix your hair, spray something on yourself, and let's go! Happy is waiting."
A bit shell-shocked, Tony looked up at him with wide eyes, his fingers tight around Steve's bicep, like he was afraid he'd fall over. "My hero."
"I'm kinda naked here!" He tried again, but she continued to ignore him.
"You think I'm not on Tony's side?"
falling in love with him. And maybe Tony was too.
A soft voice sounded in the dark. It could have been Clint, but Tony was sure it was Natasha.
Nodding again, Avery asked, "And prior?"
"I'm sure it isn't." She stepped back as he stood.
"It's nothing, Howard, come on," Steve steered him, turning into the room and pressing him to sit on the bed.
Tony allowed himself to cry it out once in a while.
His mouth hung open, panic spreading across his face as he answered. "How can you expect me to hurt him now? I can't… if I know… I won't. I won't do it, Natasha. I won't hurt him again."
"Oh sure, now that the hard part is already done!"
"Of course," Steve answered, his voice barely above a whisper, "but we need to talk. I messed up. You can't put all the blame on yourself."
Look at us! So close to the end! Please leave a comment letting me know what you think!
Steve caught up to him, grabbing the back of his shirt and yanking him backwards, almost sending Tony careening to the sidewalk. The genius yelped, clinging to the first thing he could, which was Steve's arm, and trying to steady himself. Steve pushed him back upright.
She snickered, "You can make one kind of soup, Barton."
She nodded to him and turned to Clint. "Agent Barton, a word, if you please." She gestured to the hallway and though confused, he followed her. She stopped outside his door, and he let her in, hastily swiping stray arrows from the love seat just inside the door.
Tony's voice said in his mind.
"Thanks! You too!" Clint went red.
"But at what cost, Natasha? Steve? Because if we keep pushing this, then Steve is going to feel like he has no other choice than to continue trying to protect Tony." He set his mug down and stood, walking to her bookcase and plucking a random title from the shelf. Running his fingers down the spine, he continued. "They already fought over Steve overstepping. What good will Tony and Howard reconciling be if he loses Steve over it?"
"That's the problem," Steve asserted, "you have no idea what you had."
"Steve, I-" He swallowed dryly. "We need to talk."
is in that tower right now?" he said, jabbing his finger toward the door, "At this moment?" He turned back towards the door and froze, his eyes landing on the vague outline of Howard, still at the window. "Is that him?"
And Tony was laughing again, feeling so much better than he had before. "You do that!"
He's worried about this Director Fury even
"You know it, honey."
The movie luckily went off without an issue, with Howard choosing a 1956 film he liked,
"Love you too, little brother. Now get your ass in the shower."
She tilted her head, "Privacy smivacy. Wait," she glared, hand held out. "Is Bruce making you his pancakes?!"
Tony moved out of his reach, his shoulder dipping away from Steve's hand as he turned to his standing tool box and plucked a set of wire cutters from it. He pointed at Dum-E, "What's this mess?" He gestured to a few tools on the floor, "Right here? Clean that up."
"We shall!" Tony laughed, hooking his arm through Steve's and they left the cafe, taking long, ridiculous strides and laughing like two twelve-years-old boys. There was a camera flash just outside, and Tony laughed harder, just imagining what the headline would be. "Never mind us," he said in the direction of the flash, "just two imbeciles, out for a stroll!"
Except he had ended up fifty years into the future only to find out that he had a son who hated him - and rightly so! - because at some point in the next decade of his life he apparently made the decision to abuse his child.
"Tones, would you
"No." Steve said softly, his fingers still moving, he bent the digit upwards, trying to stretch him quicker. Out of nowhere, Tony keened.
"Mm," he kissed Tony's forehead. "I won't then." When his stomach made a loud, grumbling noise, he laughed, "And I'll get right on that."
"Please," Clint sassed, as they stopped to pick out some carrots. "A whole new world has opened up to me. I am the Soup King!"
Dropping kisses down Tony's bare chest, Steve tugged at the waist band of the boxers, and Tony lifted his hips. Smoothly, Steve removed them, laying a final kiss to the skin next to his belly button, and sat up to undo the buttons on his union suit, sliding it off and standing to kick out of it.
much."
to spill himself all over Steve's stomach.
"Thor would like you to know that you would love pineapple on pizza if you just tried it, and he and Howard are on their way to you."
Natasha's cheeks filled with air, and she blew it out, the sound cutting through the tension. All eyes turned to her. "I say we watch a movie." She shrugged, helpless at the confused gazes. "Look, this is so obviously awkward, and conversation isn't going to help. I'm just saying, something else to concentrate on while we eat would probably be better."
"Sir," Jarvis spoke up, about a half hour later, "Captain Rogers is in the foyer of the building. He will be in the common rooms in approximately seven minutes."
"Tony, sweetheart, I have no blood in my brain at the moment."
Only to be responsible for Steve's upheaval and Tony's demise.
"Shut up and fuck me." It was a growl. And it was almost Steve's undoing.
he texted again,
"Aw, hell, Howard. You have no idea the trouble you're causing, do you?"
Tony eyed him skeptically, "You're procrastinating because you need to gather your thoughts, huh? Come on, you can say it. Not a weakness."
"Tony?"
The media? The ones who stalked Tony and followed him to Boston, procuring media passes and packing into the back of the reception hall where the speeches would take place? They were still too stupid to even begin to realize exactly why Tony was there. It was so much more fun to paint him as a villain, as someone who had brought this upon himself.
-the fans will notice."
"Shut up, Rogers! Just shut the fuck up for once!"
It felt like that one time Tony dumped a cup of ice water down his back. The chill shook him, and he had to swallow before speaking. "How did that go?"
fucked him up enough in the next ten years that aged him well beyond his time.
"Yeah," Tony answered, "bagels."
"Okay? Speak, man!" That was Clint, digging through the cabinets and plucking a package of K-Toos from the shelf, a brand of gluten free cookies Tony loved.
Tony blinked, drawn out from his fantasy. In answer, Tony filled the machine, turned it on, and pointed to the percolating coffee, "I got nourishment right here. Zoom Zoom Juice."
"Ya really think the world is gonna miss someone like Paulie Two Fingers?" He remarked, his voice low and dangerous. He invaded Steve's personal space, and something crackled between them. "Ask me why I had that bastard put to pasture." Tony smelled like cigarettes and hair oil, baby powder used after his baths, and something sweet. Candy, maybe, sugary and tantalizing. It made Steve's cock twitch.
Howard rolled his shoulders back, proud. "Absolutely."
"Don't call me abused, damn it. Just don't!" Tony stepped to the other side of the coffee table and turned on his heels to face them. He had put space in between himself and the two people he was supposed to be able to trust the most. That hurt more than Steve wanted to admit. "I'm not some damn charity case! There's no need to call in Benson and Stabler," pointing to himself, he snapped viciously, "not a special victim. And I'd appreciate it if you both could, I don't know, let the genius in the room make the decision about how he handles his
He took the elevator, using his last few seconds to try and calm his nerves. When he entered the living room, the rest of the team was there, and if they had popcorn and the television wasn't on, he didn't judge, just made an inquiring gesture, to which Natasha answered.
That was unforgivable.
Clint shrugged. "Dunno, maybe he's too much of a pussy to hope." He got a loaded look for that. "I'm just saying! If he's convinced Steve is straight, he's not going to entertain the idea that it's him. Why break ya own heart, you know?"
"We were apart for five minutes." He chuckled into the kiss.
"Sorry about the cold comment. I know you're a little," he gestured wildly, "testy about it."
"You're disgusting. And in regards to those two? I'm not even shocked anymore." Just to prove her point about propriety, she cut off a small piece of her own waffle and chewed politely with her mouth closed.
Clint laughed and pulled away from her hand. "You want another screwdriver?"
The car slowed to a stop, and Tony was dismayed to see paparazzi outside the office as well.
Groaning, Tony rolled off the couch and onto his feet. "I like my butt too much to risk that." Turning to Howard, he asked, "Pep didn't scare you too much, did she?"
"With marshmallows?"
," Natasha teased, handing him a glass of water and pulling a butterknife from one of the drawers.
"I like him." Retrieving the tennis ball, Howard waved it in front of Dum-E. "Wanna go again, little 'bot?"
And answering Steve means admitting how in love with him Tony actually is. And knowing that Steve feels the same way… He's not strong enough to say no. Not even close. He knows he'll give in, and then he's damning Steve to turmoil and stress. To dealing with the media and with Tony's baggage.
"Think I can arrange that," Tony chuckled softly, taking Steve's lips onto his.
Steve threw his head back and laughed loudly, Tony really liked how his eyes crinkled in mirth. He pushed Tony forwards, "Come on, idiot. I'll let you enter first, so you can pretend you won."
There was so much to say. Steve felt the beginnings of a thousand words form in his throat and get stuck at the back of his tongue.
When it finished, he pulled the dildo from his ass and melted into the bed, his body still twitching in the aftermath.
He turned back to Howard.
. According to the Emergency Medicine doctor, he has four fractured ribs, a broken metatarsal, a fractured wrist, two broken fingers, and a dislocated shoulder. That amongst the multiple contusions, the bruises, the scrapes… It's a fucking mess all around.
"Not at all," Rhodey sighed, thinking back to the young Tony he once knew. His insecurities had only been masked over time, but they never went away.
"Are you sure?" Steve asked, pulling back yet again, much to Tony's consternation.
He sat, pulling a stuffed bear from behind him and setting it on the back of the couch. "I'm beginning to think this isn't a good idea, Tash."
It only seemed fitting that it would backfire at some point. Like Midas, his own actions eventually damned him.
"Oh God, please, please!" Tony was trembling with need, so the next time Steve pulled out, he thrust back in faster, a little harder. Picking up speed with each stroke.
"I know," Steve offered, "but it is what it is. Maybe we can use this to our advantage? It might be nice to form
That's why Clint called Rhodey.
It didn't help. Not that Bruce had meant it to. Steve wouldn't actually kill them. There was a lecture in their future,
A burst of heat enveloped Steve as he stepped out of the shower, compliments of the heaters Tony had installed in everyone's bathroom. That wonderful man really did think of everything. The ridiculously fluffy towel he wrapped around his waist was just another luxury courtesy of Tony, and he entered his bedroom to dress only to find Natasha sitting on his bed, flipping through his sketchbook.
Later at the base, after Tony bathes and gets patched up, Rhodey slips into the bed beside him and holds him, his eyes wet and his breath stuttering.
The sign clanged back into position and the door opened, the dull thud of music drifted out. She led him down a hallway, and behind a false door, which when opened, allowed the stream of conversation, smoke, and music to blast free. "I'll tell Tonio. Wait here." She was back quicker than she was the other night, beckoning him with a nod of her head.
"Of course! I'm not a total heathen!"
"144."
"Okay, so this time, it's bone broth, with chicken, carrots, onions and celery." A quick soup Clint had googled. "And herbal tea." He handed Steve the bowl, since Tony still hadn't moved from his position on the couch, his head in Steve's lap. "The pot I used still had the price tag on it. We've been here for over a year."
"Tell that to Tony and Clint."
"Tony," Howard sighed, dropping his hands, "it's still my fault."
"You can't think of anything?" Clint said, turning to Bruce, who sat next to him.
Tony twitched, jolting to the side. "Stop that! I'm ticklish!"
"Then what was that?" He gestured to Steve's lap, "Not that I don't like sitting on you, just prefer it when we're naked." He was deflecting again, and Steve let him.
"No touching my whore. But I want you to take your cock out."
"Regardless," Hill snapped, her expression edging into annoyed, "the whole world is now cognizant of Howard Stark -- looking fresh and young -- running around the city, saving his son. When he died an old man over twenty years ago."
"I can do that." Bending his knees back against his body, Tony let out a small puff of breath, a soft moan trailing at the end of it. Steve kissed him once more before leaning back up to close Tony's knees against his chest, keeping his strokes, long, deep, and fast. It was an uncomfortable angle for him, but he was rubbing against that sweet spot inside Tony with every pass. This wasn't about him, Steve knew, this was about Tony. He had been the one to wake him just so he could go aid Nat, so his own pleasure didn't matter as much.
, Steve thought darkly,
"'Ey, Bright Eyes, you gonna have some?" It was his right hand, James "Colonel" Rhodes, a handsome black man that Tony had to fight tooth and nail to get into the family business. Many of his
Nodding, Howard asked, "Curry? Really?"
And him being there, didn't that mean that Tony would never be abused?
Swallowing, Howard tried to neutralize his expression. It was a weak point of his, the ever so helpful internet calling it
They're bundled up, but even under their winter parkas and the hemmed slacks, he can see that they are frail, withered with age and experience. There is still strength there - hidden under wrinkles - and it reveals itself with their linked arms and careful stride.

a favorite.
?" Clint asked, looking at Tony with his head tilted.
"I'll get them," Nat offered, standing up, though she loathed having to re-shoulder her burdens. "You get Howard. Better to hear it from us. I know JARVIS can just tell them to come out but…"
"It-it was a spell," he stuttered out his response, "connected to your artist pin. Once you held it again, I'd be brought to you."
But it didn't seem right. It didn't seem
It was nice to not feel like falling asleep directly after, and sometimes, he even had enough spare energy for round two.
Bored was a lie. There was always a new project, or an unfinished blueprint. No, bored was Tony's way of saying he needed to talk. They rarely ever got into the actual reason that he needed that, but if all Rhodey could do was offer a friendly conversation, that's what he was there for.
It was nice to have even a semblance of normalcy after years in the spotlight, to be able to go to lunch without worrying about bodyguards and getting their shirts ripped clean off them, to be able to go food shopping or to the gym without a thousand cameras going off.
Bruce watches as Steve paces the living room, his feet frantically stomping back and forth.
"Selfie!" He chucked, throwing his arm around Clint and pulling him close. Clint threw up a peace sign and they both smiled. "Oh, that's awful," Tony chuckled, looking at the photo.
Tony runs his hands through his hair. "What does this have to do with anything?!"
It was also possible that Howard was just another bigot, blind to what love actually was.
"Smart woman," Clint grinned, taking the phone to wish her a happy birthday. Tony turned away from him to continue making idle chatter with the fans. They had moved to the curb as the sidewalks were filled with the lunchtime rush.
Cocking an eyebrow, Bruce used his foot to pull out a stool for him to sit on. "Cut the act, Tony."
"What reputation?"
"I mean, I guess. But Tony, what happens if he flips out?"
Steve nodded, "Yeah, he said they had bagels. Had been feeling well enough that he figured he'd step out of the soup jail he'd been put in."
Bruce called Tony his best friend, and he didn't say it lightly. He also didn't say it often. Tony had Rhodey. And he had Steve now as well. Though, lover and best friend varied depending on who you asked, it was easy to see that Steve
Steve's head whipped around, glaring at the man and taking in how he was slowly moving up against Tony's backside and the gross way his hands were at Tony's hip and on his ass.
"Bye! You pervert," And she was gone, Steve's laughter trailing behind her.
"Anytime!" Bruce's voice called back as he disappeared into his own room. Rhodey chuckled as he pushed open the door.
"Yes, that will be all."
Steve splayed his hands on Tony's shins to anchor himself, holding Tony still as he brought him closer and closer to the edge. When the muscles started to tremble under his touch, he pushed Tony's knees apart and took him in hand, jerking him with quick, practised movements.
"Oh?" Tony smiled up at him, "Feeling a little randy?"
and see the nightmares he gets! I shared a dorm with him when he was a teenager, you share a
"Of course, Agent Romanoff."
He didn't look at all like the Howard from the few photographs Tony kept, or the man he had met at graduation that stood tall and proud behind his son. Media smile on, posing for pictures and paparazzi, while behind Tony's back, he kept his son's arm in a vice grip.
Steve tried to push the thoughts away as he stepped under the stream of hot water, but they wouldn't budge. Howard reminded him of Peggy, and not the Peggy who was losing herself to Alzheimer's in a hospital across the ocean, but
"Any of it!" His voice was rising, the pitch wavering back and forth between fury and something sad and filled with longing. "What the fuck did you think you were doing?" The anger shot out, like the spittle he ejected as he said it, flying across the room and making Howard flinch back.
Spinning on his heel, Steve stomped to his bed, sighed, and fell face down into it. His voice was muffled when he spoke. "What did I ever do to deserve this?"
it was overwhelming. His head dropped into his hands, and the sob that he let out had Natasha startled.
"What? How?" Natasha paused while sliding the cutting board from its place behind the bread box. "You figured it out."
"I need to check on my father."
on the subway. He was thankful, at least, that in his short time in the new millennium Steve had come to fully grasp the intricate systems that were the transportation module of the five boroughs of New York City.
But he was a murderer. A gangster. Everyone knew what he had done to earn his place as the Don of the family, even if no one could prove it. But it still didn't stop Steve's cock from twitching when he looked at him, splayed out on that lounger, like he was without a care in the world.
"Okay. Good. And really, thank you. You pulled me back from a dark place. It's not...I'm not perfect. But I am better. I owe that all to you." Pausing, Steve looks at Tony, really looks at him. Deep enough that Tony is starting to shift his weight a little uncomfortably. "Tell me if I'm over-reading this."
Leaping from the awning and landing on the sidewalk, Steve gave the dragon a wide berth, his eyes taking in every detail he could, searching for hidden hands or feet of civilians who may have been missed. Taking off up the street toward a cafe where he saw moving shadows in the dim light, Steve heard the repulsors of the Iron Man armor charging up and firing and the steady beat of the weapons on board the quinjet blaring off. He risked a glance behind him, happy to see Tony far from the dragon's reach, hovering and firing blast after blast.
"Howard!"
"There's some New York Strip Steaks in here. Not the finest cut, but still good," Steve suggested, pulling out the meat and holding it out to show him.
"I need to learn a whole fucking lot, don't I?" Tony groaned.
Tony gave James a triumphant look. "Whatever, man," Rhodes said, lighting a cigarette for some other dame. No one could say he wasn't a gentleman. "If he'll do it, then it's just fine. If not, I'll take care of it."
"Think we're missing what's right in front of us."
And Steve jumped so high, he was briefly concerned the whole super soldier thing was a ruse. "Tony!" He moved to slam his laptop shut, but Tony stopped him, gently putting his hands on Steve's and slipping the device from him.
"I know of her, she did work with a few singers I've worked with, don't know much, why?" She paused and laughed, "is she the new manager? How long before you chase this one away?"
"Maybe. But he also might be happy to see him."
"He's not that fragile, Miss Potts." Clint was a little indignant on Tony's behalf. "He's survived this long for a reason. He's strong."
Tony was hiding his face and
RiaRose - 3136 -  T5 - Non Penetrative Sex
"He hated me." Tony felt Rhodey as he moved closer, bringing Tony to his side and twisting his body to look into his face and block the questioning gazes of the patrons around them. He was warm. Comforting. Always protecting him. Like Maria couldn't. "I didn't do anything wrong." He looked at Rhodey. "I was a child. Right? A kid. Kids are innocent."
"Oh, give it a rest! We figured out it was you like right away, man. Relax. We're all for it." He pushed the cursor, opening Steve's documents and scanning them. "Let me see your unfinished ones, e-mail them to me. I can look them over tomorrow and maybe help you complete them."
"I like it better when it's after someone comes in me. Clean me up."
She could sit there forever. At first, she had lamented the loss of her own youth. Envious that she would never get the chance to have her hot Massapequa boyfriend bridal carry her onto the drunk train or be able to lean on her best friends and navigate the steps together, speaking along with the automated voice as the train pulled away.
I think we're doing just fine."
Howard graced him with a smile. "That it is."
Clint closed his eyes, sighing. "That's not what I mean, Nat. He would feel he had no other choice. Tony isn't controllable; he doesn't like people speaking or acting
It turns out that becoming a guardian angel and entering The Protectors program entails a lot of paperwork, which is ridiculous because Heaven should have something better in place already. Tony dutifully crosses every T and dots every I. He reads through
"He only likes me because I can reach the top shelf!" Steve called out, blatantly yelling so Tony could hear him.
Smiling at the obvious false bravado Howard was emitting, Thor placed Mjolnir beside him and responded, "I am Thor, son of Odin, from Asgard." He watched with amusement as those words settled over Howard's understanding like a sudden rain, his face going from guarded to open with confusion and a little bit of wonder. "I am also one of the Avengers, and proud to be so. I count them all as family, including Tony. So, it should not be a shock that I am disheartened and angered to hear that you disapprove of his leanings and his relationship."
