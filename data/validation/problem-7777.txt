“Thank you,” Tony says sincerely. “For bringing him.”
Steve snorts a laugh.  “Virgin eyes?” Steve asks.  “You do realize I’ve probably seen more naked ass than you have, right?  Spend a few years on tour with showgirls then another couple in a warzone and there isn’t much left to corrupt.”
“That’s not what I meant,” Steve objects.
“I’m a boy scout, remember?” Steve teases. “I wouldn’t say it if it wasn’t true.”
“I’m sorry, I’m sorry. This is mean. I am a mean person for enjoying this.”
Steve had already dealt with one too many sex tapes for his liking so anything more than a brief kiss was a no.
It’s at one of these charity functions that Steve first meets Tony’s most recent fella.  Steve’s been warned (yes, warned, because everyone expects that Steve will freak out) that Stark is bisexual.  Steve considers pointing out to Hill that this generation didn’t invent bisexuality, or sex, for that matter but she’s trying to be helpful so he plays along.  She looks relieved when he  promises not to choke on his straw if he sees his teammate bringing around a man on his arm.
“You don’t approve?” Tony asks.
Steve listens, and when Tony finishes he lets out a slow breath.  “I’m about to get dinner with Nat, Sam and Clint.  Come with us.”
Steve wants to be annoyed but the laugh bursts out from him. “Thanks, I think?”
Tony stays in his armor as they wait for news.  He leaves the faceplate open but the rest of him is entirely closed off.  That’s okay.  Steve gets it, he really does.  It’s awkward to hold hands with Tony in his gauntlets anyway, so instead they lean against each other for comfort, secluded on a couch in a private waiting area.  They don’t speak more than a few polite words in the first hour.
He turns slowly, looks at the crates and knows what they represent and well-- it turns out he doesn’t want them.  Not now.  Maybe never.
Tony raises his hand again like he’s going to start pounding and Steve just blurts out the first thing that comes to mind.
with Clint last Christmas (I lift up mine eyes into the hills) but for whatever reason, when he needs to split, he ends up in Switzerland, von Trapp style.
that appreciates The Art of War
“If I put one thigh on that thing it’s going to collapse,” Steve says, eyeing it suspiciously.
Obie is faster.  He stands, then rushes toward the door.
“Sounds right,” James agrees.
“Is that a problem?” Steve asks.
Clint nods, pushes back from the table and walks into the kitchen slowly and deliberately. James isn’t looking but Clint is telegraphing every movement and making a good bit more noise than necessary.
“He’s gonna be a lot less stable if he wakes up and we’re still up in the air,” Clint says. “Gotta do something about that.”
“Give it to me,” James reproaches, limping to grab it from Bruce’s grasp. He looks entirely unimpressed. “Don’t burn things someone could use.”
Dummy chirps apologetically from the other end of the table.
dance, because Clint strips naked without a care in the world and then stands directly in the middle of the spray, hands on his hips, junk jutted forward, just to be a dick.
A few additional friends have been added to the table for the night.  Rhodey, Pepper and Nanna meet up with the gang after work, and have all agreed to join in Clint’s quest for a record breaking Fry Platter night.  They’re on number 5 when Steve leans over to Tony.
“That’d be nice, thanks.”
“Okay, Tony.  You’re good to go,” Steve says.
“Holy.  Shit.” Clint swears.  “This is
“Steve Rogers would say the same thing,” Steve says.  “You-- I mean Bucky-- always hated that. That I wouldn’t just admit it when things hurt. He’d watch me gasp for air all night, and then hear me tell my mom I was fine when she got home the next morning.”  Steve draws in a slow breath, shaken by the memory.  "Some days I think he was ready to throttle me himself. He'd usually just tell my Mom, though, which felt like a fate worse than death. He always said he knew I was looking for the quickest way to martyrdom and someone had to stop me.” Steve’s voice falters on the last few words.
Bruce mutes the phone. Steve looks to Tony.
“I noticed him before I got to the barn,” James says noncommittally. “If I was going to kill him, I’d have killed him then.”
“I don’t see you that way,” Steve says.
James goes ragged with relief. “I saw a bathtub.”
“So kind of like the opposite of you,” Tony teases.
“What?” Steve asks.  “Yes.  Sorry--  What?”
“No, not him,” Bruce says. “It’s old. Older than either of you. From Roman times.”
“This mattress is fine,” Steve assures him.  “Better than fine, because it’s got you on it.  Can I kiss you?”
Steve can see from the handwritten BRUCE on the front, that it’s from Tony. It looks like it was opened without care.
“That’s--” Tony pauses.  “That’s very Captain America of you.”
Tony looks up from his workbench and shrugs. “Why? Something happen at work?”
"Exactly."
“Give me some credit, Doc.  When I come back tomorrow I’ll have everything I need.”
there.  But he can’t be, and this is how he has to do things for now and that sucks. "Yeah, of course. What kind of injury?" he asks.  He knows he sounds deflated.  It’s the best he can do.
Tony hops down off the counter and puts down the Starkpad, finally meeting Steve’s eyes.  “C’mon, it’s all back here.”
“I’m not going to live that phrase down, am I?” Tony asks.
“What’s wrong?” he asks, more awake when he gets a good look at her stony expression.  That’s Nat’s Serious Business face.
Steve turns away and walks to the closet.  “She wouldn’t do that.  She’s upset, but I don’t think she’s vindictive.”
No one mentions that Thor has decorated his egg in green and gold and it’s a miniature Loki.  They aren’t sure he knows.  So it’s a relief when Steve hears him call it “Yolki” a few hours later.  And despite Thor’s tendency to move around the penthouse like a bull in a China shop, he’s careful with his egg.
Tony looks at Steve like Steve’s speaking a different language and Steve can see he’s overwhelmed.  Steve steps slowly around the car and draws Tony against him.  Tony rests there, like he has no intention of pulling away any time soon.
“Pretty sure I can,” Tony affirms.
“There’s a little more,” Bruce says. He isn’t insulted at all by James’s shut down. If anything, Bruce feels better knowing that James is willing to listen to new information and sort it out for himself. “The entirety of what the scientific community knows to be absolutely certain about how the human brain stores and retrieves memories would fill about half a pamphlet. When scientists publish papers they’re guessing. Like you just said, most of it is bullshit,” Bruce admits. “But one thing pretty much everyone can agree on is that brains are resilient. And no matter what’s been done to you... no matter how much of your humanity was stripped away, I think that who you are at your fundamental core-- the version of you from the beginning-- I think that would be really damn hard to destroy.”
“Very,” Bruce says.
Complete 7/30/15
It’s only the necessity to breathe (pesky air) that separates them, and even then it’s only their faces. At some point they’ve turned and it’s Steve pinning Tony against the wall and they just stay there.
In section
“Tell me you aren’t still working there because you think you need the money,” Tony demands.
“Nanna knows where it is,” Bucky says.  “I need you to sit your ass down and work on these traffic camera manips.  If they haven’t gotten to the security cameras yet, this will slow them down, and if I try to do it myself they’re gonna look like shit.”
“Human Resources,” Tony starts again, making no more sense on his second attempt than he had on his first.  “They have a form we could sign.  I know it seems way too official just for us to be able to flirt, but if you-- I mean, if flirting is something you’d be interested in exploring.  There’s a waiver for that.”
He takes a hard blow to the shoulder and throws his elbow backwards to send whomever hit him flying backward.
He finds Tony and Steve sitting close together on the love seat, their heads bent together in quiet conversation.
Clint smiles back at him ominously.  “Oh, you’re gonna wish.”
“If that’s--” Tony continues, trying to hold off the silence for as long as possible.
Bruce’s chest tightens.  Why hadn’t Tony told him?  Why hadn’t Tony trusted him?  Why had Tony gone through this alone?
“This is good,” Tony says, after he takes his first bite.  “I’d forgotten.”
“For an obscene amount of cash,” Clint says. “On a service that only goes out to people with a reputation for getting shit done.”
Have a happy new year!!! <3 Arrow
“Well, yeah. Except for that part,” Clint says. “But I wasn’t sure you didn’t know. I know you’ve said before that Hulk can sense those things even when you’re all... you shaped.”
“Mine,” Tony says, with all the ferocity of a toddler.  “I said it didn’t make us even; I didn’t say it wasn’t a start.”
Bruce wants him, of everyone, to understand that.
“And move up our counseling sessions to twice a week,” Steve adds.
“You are not your father, if that's what you're worried about,” Steve says.  “Just look how you take care of the team.  If and when this is a conversation you want to have... I can’t say I haven’t given it some thought, too.”
“Figure I’ll wing it,” Tony admits.
It’s adorable. Tony wants to kiss his face forever. Just as soon as Steve’s back to only having one face. And maybe things aren’t so spinny.
“That makes a lot of sense,” Bruce says, and honestly, the conversation solves another word problem Bruce has been struggling with. “So skin arm and metal arm is how you’d like us to talk about your arms? I haven’t been sure how to differentiate them in conversation without being rude.”
“Didn’t do it for you, Cap,” Clint says.  “I’m not ready to kiss and make up, but I’m less pissed than I was.  Tony wrote me a letter.  I know he’s sorry.”
Steve and Bruce won’t.  Everyone else will.
“See? Bruce knows what I’m talking about.”
Bruce hears James sigh and then huff and Bruce digs his fingers into his palm to keep from rescuing him. James will find the words. And it’s obvious to Bruce those words aren’t going to be about the weather.
For the most part every day on GMNY is the same.  There’s a cooking segment (Steve learns to make polenta and prepare kale this way), they talk about the weather, there’s some bizarre fashion trend to discuss, a weight loss segment, and then the hosts end the show with celebrity gossip.  The gossip is usually where Steve starts to tune it out, but when they announce they’ve got Tony Stark’s most recent ex-girlfriend coming up next, he puts down the paper to watch.
The scanner is genius. The small scanning brick is sleek and white and could pass for a phone except there’s no screen. The longer baton lays on any surface and slits open to project a surprisingly clear holograph above it. The hologram can be swatted through to move pictures forward and backward. It also sends all the information to Bruce’s phone so he can look at the images later or send them to JARVIS for a second opinion.
“Dude,” Clint says, with a sort of disarming, midwestern charm that Clint manages to make seem natural. “I’m not bragging when I say I’m one of the best and you just got the drop on me out of that bath like it was nothing. We aren’t keeping you here. I’m not, because I know it’d be pointless, and Bruce won’t, because he’s as decent as they get. If you want to go, we wouldn’t stop you, even if we could.”
“He is,” Tony says. “No clue why he’d wanna hang around with me, but I guess stranger things have happened.”
“Yes,” Steve agrees. “What can I do for you, son?”
“That’s... intense,” Bruce says.
“Oh, Nat’s going to pay.”
“Ask away.”
“That all, Ms. Potts?” Tony asks.
“You’re a natural,” Steve says.
Steve can’t mention Tony’s name without Bruce’s eyes going hazel or Clint disappearing off to the range for hours at a time.  Natasha flies to South America and only promises she’ll check in once a week.  Pepper says she needs to focus on keeping SI afloat despite Tony’s best efforts to sink the company, and Rhodey buries himself in his military work.
“Sorry! Sorry!” Steve apologizes, his voice muffled by the food. “I didn’t want to talk with my mouth full and you asked right as I took a huge bite.” He sounds contrite. “We are not burying any bodies. I think what you’re smelling is mulch, maybe? And-- we’re not going to hurt you. I won’t let

“I was never really into that stuff. It just took my mind off things I didn’t want to think about. Made me numb. Gave me an outlet for the punishment I thought I deserved. I’m not even sure if I’m any good at... I mean, Shayla said--”
“You aren’t really going to make that my ringtone are you?”
Bruce wishes he had a whiteboard, or Tony’s holoboard, or even post-it notes and a pen. This would be so much easier if he had something to do with his hands other than wave them around like a lunatic.
“Good, you’re back,” Tony greets Steve, when he walks out of James’s room.
Emergency with Barnes. JARVIS will fill you in. Can’t call cause I need to keep the line open for Bruce. Think he’s gonna need me.
“I think I’d rather just ride it all out and get back to hockey,” Steve says. “Though I do appreciate you stepping in. It’s been a rough couple of weeks.”
“No one’s going to die,” Steve says.  “And no one’s making a sex tape, either.”
It’s weird calling him Stark, Steve thinks.  In his mind, he’s always Tony now.  And since he’s given Tony an embarrassing amount of thought lately, the given name sticks.
It’s the first time Steve’s said it outloud to anyone who didn’t already know.  It sounds so simple, even if lately it’s been anything but.
James lifts his hips off the hay slightly and pushes his too-loose jeans down. There’s nothing underneath and Bruce averts his eyes. It isn’t that he has an issue with nudity. God knows he’s over that by now. He’s just repulsed by the knowledge that James’s dignity has been disregarded for so long that he doesn’t blink at stripping in front of a stranger.
5 Eggs Down - 2 To Go
“Help us unload, then move the van back to the edge of the woods.”
Except Steve doesn’t ask.  A month passes, then another.  Steve comes up with a dozen reasons not to seek out Tony.  Just because he’s Captain America doesn’t mean he’s immune to the pang of rejection or a distaste for being mocked.  Tony will tease him about wanting his relics.  Remind him he’s an old man and offer to buy him a new sketchbook-- a digital one with all the bells and whistles.  He won’t understand.
but he’s more stuck on the paper-wrapped taco in Clint’s hand.
“I think that would be best.”
By ‘got us covered’ Steve had assumed Tony meant he had the keys to a rink somewhere. It hadn’t occurred to him in any way that Tony might have an ice rink at his mansion. Or that Tony would
“Circus wisdom,” Clint explains. “We had a bear that rode a little tricycle. Mean as shit. I hated that thing.”
“A thing,” Tony says, smiling wondrously.  “Are you coming out to me right now?”
That does not help Steve’s cause.  Tony glares at Steve with a sort of fury that leaves no room for apology.  Not now.  Maybe not ever.  He drops Steve’s coat to the ground like it burns him.  “I want my keys.”
Bruce is trying not to laugh, while the other Avengers stare at the egg Tony’s holding out in his hand.  It’s whole and it has Pepper’s signature on the bottom.
_______________________________________________________________
“That’s a nice thought, doc,” Clint says quietly. “You really think so?”
“Hot. Damn,” Clint says. “He’s into you.”
“I wouldn’t have guessed,” Clint says kindly (Bruce really does not believe him.) “So what do you say? Tomorrow morning want to play barbershop?”
“What would have worked on him back during the war?” Tony asks.  “You said you think he’s in there, Steve.  What would bring him running?”
All he ever draws is the past, and it intensifies the loneliness he feels, even after a year.  It’s better not to think about.  Better to distract himself with the screen.
Bruce is done with his inspection in under five minutes.  It’s going to take James longer since he’s peering suspiciously in every closet, pulling out every drawer, and inspecting under the beds with a thoroughness that leaves Bruce confident if there’s so much as an ant in the house, James will find it and escort it out the door.
For a few minutes they chat about less important things. Bruce finds out Clint broke into the famous gazebo from the movie, and Clint laughs hard at Bruce's story about laying down to sleep only to realize his head is resting in cow--
“It’s not right, you still feel like that,” James says. “Bruce is a good listener. You should talk to him.”
Kudos and comments are always appreciated!
“I’ve been an asset and a weapon,” Clint adds. “It sucks.”
“You’d better.  And you also better get back all in one piece, mister, or we’re going to have words.”
“I’m sure that looks good on his resume,” Tony says.  “Maybe the Knicks are hiring.”
“Escort this man out of here!” Obie shouts at the nearest guards.
About half an hour later, the bedroom door swings open.  James walks into the living room and his hair is significantly shorter.  It doesn’t look bad, either, for having cut it himself.  He’s done a much better job than Bruce has ever done on his own hair.
Tony and Steve do get their revenge because once Clint closes his eyes to let the spray wash his face, Tony gestures at Steve to move back.  Steve does, and Tony springs forward, smacks the temperature controls, and then hops out of the shower range right as the water turns ice cold.
“My speed?” Tony asks.  “Do foods have speeds?  Are you calling me, what?  Fast?  Slow?  I don’t even know what’s more insulting here.  You’re going to have to explain this metaphor.”
Natasha pulls out her phone to text Clint and Bucky.
“Really, Tony?” Steve asks to the air.
They try new combinations of their favorite milkshakes every time they meet up. Steve’s new favorite is the Iron Widow. Clint insists on buying an Avenger Special which is every one of them all mixed together. The smell makes Steve gag. Tony and Bruce are purists. They refuse to mix and match, though Bruce will sip whatever Clint’s having occasionally.
“Wait. I’m going to put you on speaker. Everyone’s going to need to hear this.”
Enjoy being tied up in bed?  Good.  For.  You.
“Me and Bucky both did,” Steve says.  “We kind of grew up there.  Nanna was one of the founders.”
Steve snaps his notebook closed and tucks it in his bag.  He could use some air, anyway.  Maybe a walk will help him sort out where this whole conversation went so very, very wrong.
Tony stops speaking as the occupants around the table (minus Steve and Clint) laugh.  Tony laughs, too, but when the laughter dies down, Tony fills his next glass to the brim with more champagne and drains it like a thirsty soldier with a canteen.  There’s no more science talk.  Instead Tony’s boyfriend takes over the conversation and launches into a story about a time he’d shut Tony up, this one involving a gag.
“Clint didn’t say,” Natasha say apologetically. “Sam’s up for it, too.”
“I can’t do this in a field,” Bruce says numbly. “Call Tony-- I need-- I need JARVIS. And we’re going to need a lift. He'll need an operating room.”
“Please tell me this isn’t a body-burying trunk,” Tony sighs into the darkness.
“If I slip up, it’s because I would accidentally talk to you the way I would talk to my friends.  Just know, if I ever tell you to do something and you don’t want to do it, I give you absolute, irrevocable permission to tell me to fuck off, okay? Like Clint says, it keeps me on my toes.”
Bruce turns his attention to James, who has slumped into the cushions looking drained.
“I never... I never knew you thought that,” Steve says helplessly.  He tries to replay a hundred different moments in his head at once.  A hundred different confrontations and conversations and sideways glances.  “I’m sorry.  Shit, I’m sorry.  That was never my intention.  I thought you knew.  Everyone else on the team knows.”
“Then here.  Let’s get you 110 points,” Tony says, reaching for a post-it note.  He writes KICK ME and then hands it to Clint.  “Tag me.”
“Give me a second to think,” Tony insists.
He’s really not usually this hostile.  Or at least he tries to hide it better.  There’s something about Tony that allows Steve to let down his guard in a way he doesn’t do with anyone else.  And that’s probably shitty of him because Tony doesn’t deserve his mood.  No one does.
It’s his ‘she mentioned the arc reactor on television’ look.  Steve hates that this time he’s the one who put it there.
“Was his protective streak only for you or was he out to save everybody?” Natasha asks.
“I bought you breakfast to thank you,” Steve says, as he steps into Tony’s workshop and places one of the two paper McDonalds’s bags in his hand onto the table in front of Tony.  He adds a large McDonalds coffee next to it.
Clint interrupts by reaching over the table to drop a slab of fries to Tony’s plate, and then Steve’s.
“He’s better off than he was,” Steve says, like it’s the most obvious thing in the world. “Sometimes you don’t get a choice in how you help people.”
Steve interrupted Tony’s words.
And with that Steve smiled and ,with a yelp of surprise from Tony, he lifted Tony bridal style and carried him to the elevator.
To Tony’s relief, it looked like Bucky and Natasha didn’t have the desire to bully Tony. The only reaction he got from them was when Natasha said: “Be a good boy Tony and get healthy soon” and Bucky nodding his head.
“Tony, stop this whining. You know better than that. Just because you are rich and famous it doesn’t dismiss you from responsibility. You’re an omega with certain needs that you so kindly forgot to accomplish. You will face the responsibility and punishment of your actions.”
“Tony, please strip down from your clothes”
“Two things: 1. It’s my body so I can do what I want. 2. You have no right to punish me! You aren’t even my alpha! And even then, you…”
~ OMG, how the hell I didn’t understand that earlier?! We are teammates! I’m the alpha’s team. I suppose to care for my alphas and omegas. Especially the omegas. And knowing Tony he wasn’t one to care too much about his health. ~
Tony blushed but hurried to do as Steve said. He didn’t want any more trouble. He had enough as it was now.
Tony raised his head a little bit. Not exactly looking Steve in the eyes but better than before.
Tony hoped that Steve will let go of this matter. And really, in today’s society, not everyone cared so much about the needs of developed omegas.
“Now,” said Steve, “We will go visit doctor Bruce. Who will check your health and will recommend what we will do next to ensure that you will become a healthy omega.”
Tony heard a giggle from behind him. He completely forgot! There were more people in the common room! He was so so so…
Steve rushed to Tony's side, tugging his shirt off of him. Steve was ready to offer his sweatshirt when he froze.
“Clint! Be quiet. Try to support Tony.” Steve commended.
“Tony please, at least try to understand. And to answer to your point of view… 1. It is your body and it's your right to do what you want with it. But your body has needs. You can’t change that. If you won’t wash your hands for weeks you can become seriously ill. Of course, maybe there is a chance of 0.000001% that nothing will happen... But… Most likely something will go wrong. You need to take care of your body. 2. I have the right to punish you. I’m the Capitan of our team and can punish every member of it. Including you. The fact that I’m not your alpha won’t affect my right to punish you. Understood?”
“What about a bot?” Tony asks.  “I’ve got some small ones.  Hamster sized.”
“Oh no you didn’t,” Clint says.
“Were you upset?” Steve asks, since Tony isn’t volunteering any additional information on his own.
The elevator comes to a stop and Tony stares at Steve with a new kind of wonder.  It’s not the science.  Well-- it’s a little the science.  But it’s more that Tony’s always looked at Steve in a certain light and made a lot of assumptions and now Steve’s admitting that he not only loves planetariums, but he’s a total nerd about it.
“I’m already up to my eyeballs in this, Banner, and I’m offering my help.  Email JARVIS what it’ll take to scan Barnes’ injuries.  Try and get some scans of his arm while you’re at it. Robocop might have trackers in there or a kill switch.”
“Nathashaaaaaa they’re bullying me!” Clint sulks.
“You really mean that,” Tony says.
“I’m usually the one making that offer. It’s weird from this side.”
Bruce nods. He understands that Clint is speaking from a place of raw honesty, and also that his words are slurred because he’s either nearly in shock or at some point he took some seriously-strong pain killers.
Tony’s reasons are enough. They aren’t perfect, but they’re a start.
(See the end of the chapter for
He tries to talk to Tony again, just to make sure everything is okay.  Tony fakes a call from Pepper.  The phone doesn’t even ring or vibrate and Steve’s superior hearing means he damn sure knows there’s no one else on the line. Tony holds up a finger to Steve like he’s telling Steve he can’t continue their conversation and walks away.
“It is,” Tony sighs. “And until Bruce gets back I’m his R&D Department.” Tony’s phone dings. “That’s him now. Don’t keep him waiting.”
And well-- if they were going to kill him, that seems like a weird thing for Steve to concern himself with, right?
“I’m fine,” Bruce says. He is. He’s not smashing anything so he’s got to be fine, right? “Really. And good call on a new place. I’m getting antsy here, I think.”
Not that not having a phone would stop Tony if he really wanted to speak to Steve. He could probably make one out of an old shoe and some fishing wire. This is better though. The rules are in place for a reason.
“Tony,” she says cautiously.  “Is there something you’d like to talk about?”
“You don’t need to babysit me, Steve,” Tony says. “Go. Mingle. I’m going to sit with Rhodey and Pepper, drink my water and watch my trophy boyfriend do his thing. I’ll be fine.”
“Maybe we could take a walk after,” Steve says casually.
“Hey Clint, what do you get when you put a translator and a genius together in the back of a cab?” Kate asks.
“I don’t get it,” Steve says instead.  “What does Stark see in these people?”
This is love.
Tony sees all this, but isn’t entirely sure what’s happening.  Steve’s words are still playing on repeat in his head, though none of them slot into place in a way that makes any sense.  It’s not that Tony and Steve aren’t friends-- Tony knows they are.  He’s just always had the feeling it’s based on necessary tolerance and mandated team unity and unavoidable mutual friends.  That Steve might genuinely like him-- might respect his work and how hard he tries to make things right-- has honestly never crossed Tony’s mind.
“Or what happened in Reno?” Rhodes echoes.
“I’m here,” Steve affirms. There’s a rough quality to his voice. “You’re with Bucky?”
Steve’s going to be by any minute. Tony’s been primping for an hour. He wouldn’t call it primping out loud, but his thoughts are less charitable. They tell it like it is.
“Just a couple of minutes, if you can wait?”
James fixes him with his best irritated glare. Considering James is flat on his back it’s pretty impressive. “You should hate me.”
“Suit yourself,” Steve says.  There’s finality in his voice.  One more person Tony has disappointed.
“That, I think we can do.”
Another blow off.  Steve isn’t surprised by this one, at least.
Steve looks up at Tony with an expression that’s hard to read. “You really think so?” Steve asks.
“Whooooooa,” Tony says, raising a hand to shut Steve down. “Why would I think that?”
“Sure,” Natasha agrees.
“Two guns, two knives, and your arm,” Clint rattles off. “Then the knife Bruce dropped. So either you’re not as good as we think you are, or even with you going all Winter Soldier on us-- we got out alive.”
Minutes pass.
“I should have called but I told myself I needed more information," Steve says, all in a rush, before Tony can get out a word. "I didn’t want to drop all that in your lap without some kind of... answer. And then... Bucky. I guess-- in the whole scheme of things your parents weren’t-- weren’t at the top of my mind because it’s Bucky.”
He trails off.  He’s not any better with words than Bruce is apparently.
“Leave it,” Tony says.  “I’ve got bots for that.”
“Hey,” Clint pouts.  “People who date me don’t run off to do talk shows about how much I suck.”
Steve lets him go with a kiss to his forehead.  “Takes one to know one.”
“Fine. Name your first kid after me. We’ll call it even,” Tony says.
“Mingle,” Tony demands. He gives Steve a playful push and then heads across the room to his best friends.
“I got sick of waiting and let myself into the surgery records,” Tony says, turning his wrist display toward Bruce.  “Here.  You probably know what this doctor talk means better than I do.”
“The vultures will be gone by now,” Tony says at the same time Steve blurts out “I’m sorry about that interview!”
No. I’m on my way home. Just keep an eye on him for me til I get there?
Tony shoves hard at the table, sending it back a few inches and slopping some of Howard’s coffee out of his mug.
“Can’t trust the wired internet connections,” Bucky says, without looking up.  “I just need to finish borrowing space on this satellite so we’ve got somewhere untraceable to work, and then we’ll be set.”
Clint sticks out his tongue at her and then runs a hand over his own chest ridiculously. “Just cause you can’t handle this heat.”
“Ummm... sure?” Steve says, sitting up on an elbow.  “Let her in.”
“You deserve better,” Steve says.
“It worked,” Natasha says firmly.
“That makes you sound like a date,” Tony sulks. “I don’t want to date you. That’s incest.”
Steve’s not sure how JARVIS knows to time food delivery for a few minutes after Tony wakes up, but he’s grateful just the same.  Steve eats while Tony sips water and they watch a nature documentary on baby hippos.  It’s another quiet evening, and Steve realizes belatedly, a Sunday.  He hasn’t thought about the museum even once.
“They’re getting by,” Steve says. “It sounds like Nat’s coming home soon. Bruce has been in the tower lab a few times when I’ve dropped by. Clint’s been keeping me entertained. Oh, which reminds me... how much do you know about paintball production? I’ve got a whole list of ideas...”
“Then why?” Clint asks.  “You don’t want his money and he’s a complete tool whenever you’re around.  What would you get out of it?”
The picture changes to Steve’s panel.  He’s in his uniform, turned slightly to the side, with the shield front and center.  Behind him on the left is an interpretation of Brooklyn and as the scene flows to the right, the buildings become more modern.
“Ana sounds special,” Steve says.
Bucky, Clint and Steve stay upstairs to get to work on their assignments, while Tony follows Nanna back down to the basement.  He’d guessed correctly, the large metal cabinet is the weapons cache.  What he hadn’t guessed is that the huge safe opens to reveal another door.   The weapons are through there, and it’s a room twice the size of the visible part of the basement.  It must take up the space under the whole of the back yard.
“We met when I was fourteen and I had zero references for what friendship looked like.  It took a lot of hand-holding.  Boat loads of patience.  Rhodey ended up getting real creative with Friendship 101.”
Pepper glances down at her screen with a frown.  “I don’t really take days off.”
She skates to Bucky at break-neck speed.
“He knew what was up,” Steve agrees.  “He helped design a few of these.  And he promised he’ll have dinner waiting for us at the tower when we get home.”
Tony nods against Steve’s shirt.
“That sounds painful,” Bruce says, which is the first thing that comes to mind. He hasn’t spoken out loud much lately either so he’s not exactly at top form. He has never been at top form, really, now that he thinks about it. “Is there a specific reason you came to find me?”
James raises an eyebrow.  “Is this how all your stories start?”
“SHIELD?” Bruce asks, pulling his eyes away from the hologram in confusion. SHIELD is supposed to be gone, and if there’s anything left, Bruce doesn’t trust it.
Jarvis assists with the calculations to keep the stretcher level as Bruce floats it up the steps. Clint leads the way, and they walk through a kitchen and a living room, then down a short hall to a bedroom on the ground floor. When Bruce steps in, he can tell that either Jarvis or Tony had walked Natasha and Sam through how to set up the room because all the monitors are where he’d expect them, and everything he might need from the jet is plugged in and turned on.
“For the pizza?” Tony asks, not quite getting what Steve’s going for.
The elephant in the room begins to fade away.  Talking helps.  Who knew?
Though now Steve sees that although he’s come around a different direction he could have taken the elevator up two floors and ended up near where he is now.   Steve tries the door and it doesn’t open.  He knocks and waits.
“Drink all of this,” she says, handing Tony the water. “Take two of these,” she indicates the pain pills, “and sleep it off. I’ll leave Steve’s on his nightstand. He knows what to do.”
“Careful there, Obie,” Tony warns, "Or your face is gonna stick like that.  Now if you’ll excuse me?  I have some important information I’d like to share with the class.  Everybody, ready to take some notes?”
Tony doesn’t reply, but he does reach down to pick up a plate and hand it to Steve.
If Tony likes being tied up, Steve could work with that.  Soft rope.  Easy-to-tug-free knots.  It wouldn’t have to be like a prison camp.
“Like when you do or see something really unexpected,” Clint says.  “You’ve got to literally be saying to yourself ‘How did I get here?  How is this my life right now?”
It’s quiet after that. Eventually, Bruce hears Steve and Tony arrive. They stay out of sight. About an hour passes before Tony texts him.
Clint tosses Bruce what he’s holding in his hand.
Steve’s angry retort dies on his tongue.  He glares at Tony, bends down to pick up a plate, and hurls it a hundred miles an hour at the ramp.  It hits so hard the pieces turn to dust.
Which makes Bruce laugh. “No, not ordinary.  I’d
He waits a few seconds, for Dum-E to press the button, and when he sees the red light flicker on, he begins.
“But I’m taller,” Steve says.
“Who died and made you Captain?” Bucky complains. “This is my first game in forever.”
It turned out, Steve’s fixation was on the brainwashing techniques HYDRA’d used on Barnes.  Ugly stuff.  Old School.  Having once been on the receiving end of similar torture, Tony was only able to spy on Steve’s screen for about a minute before he grabbed for the nearest trash can and threw up his dinner.
“Steve!” Clint greets, while Bucky juggles a plastic bag with a few subs and locks the door.
Tony texts the picture to her and she’s totally engrossed in her phone. It starts buzzing and beeping and her smile is everything Tony had hoped. This might actually be better than a puck, but Tony hopes that’s still coming too.
He wonders if Tony can hear the rub there.  If he can hear Steve’s lonely bitter frustration that he can’t help Bucky in even the smallest of ways.  Or his jealousy that Tony’s best pal texts him morning, noon and night while Steve combs through paragraphs about arm stumps and bone grafts and blood.
Tony’s still asleep and he doesn’t stir as Steve tucks the blanket in around him.  He’s totally dead to the world.  It makes Steve wonder just how long it’s been since Tony slept.  A while, probably.
“The truth,” Steve says.  In contrast to Tony, he says it with all the confidence in the world.  “I call things like I see ‘em.”
“I think it’s a great idea,” Steve says. “Jarvis can get you all set up. It’ll be fun.”
“That
“I won’t argue with those results,” Steve concedes.
“Do you mind walking back to the tower?” Tony asks as they stand from their booth.  “Might be nice to get a little more fresh air.”
“Nothing ever went on between me and Howard,” Steve rushes to assure him.  “He knew though, and he covered for me every now and then when I needed an alibi.’
“Did you read any biographies on Bucky Barnes?”
“See how delicately they’ve shaded her face?” Steve asks.  “And how that contrasts with the strength in her pose and in her build?  It’s perfect.”
Steve smiles, and even though it’s a little sad, it looks like there’s some good memories behind it. “Then some things never change.”
“Bucky?” Natasha answers. She listens. “Clint, slow down. Tony’s right here.”
“I would never hurt you,” Steve says.  He stands absolutely still, so Tony doesn’t interpret any movement as threatening.  “If you’re not interested in me, that’s fine.  We can be friends.  Team mates.  Polite strangers.  It’s your call.”
“Then you need to get your eyes checked, grandpa,” Tony says.  It’s supposed to be a joke except his voice cracks.  He turns his face toward the window, to shut Steve out.  The car will park soon.  Steve will leave.  They can laugh about this in a few days.
“Do you think Gerber lays in bed at night and just gets off on thinking up the most impossible talking points ever?” Tony asks.  “Like ohhhh-ohhhhh-ohhhhh this is good.  This is going to make one of them cry... Maybe both... Real tears... Ahhhhhhhhhhh.”
“I’m not hungry. I’m not-- anything,” Steve argues.
And that makes Steve’s breath hitch.  Aunt Peggy.  Of course.  Three years into his friendship with Tony, and somehow this is the first time she’s ever come up.  Steve can’t hide the flash of pain he feels at her name.
like anything you want.”
They play a game with something that actually resembles rules this time. Tony’s the better skater, and the better shooter, but Steve is obviously better at defense. Tony can’t help his running narrative that’s half smart-ass commentary and half game calling. By the end of the match it’s probably close but neither of them are keeping score.
“Why did you choose The Potato Eaters?” Steve prompts.
“I stopped by to see a friend,” Steve says. “A friend I knew I wanted more with. Just didn’t want to make assumptions.”
Tony can feel his eyes crossing in confusion.  "Am I going to regret asking why you're taking creeper shots of Dr. Banner?"
“If you really want to know what I do on the internet,” Steve says.  “Most of what I look at is the art.  Pictures of famous paintings I’d only ever seen in books that could never really capture what was there.  And lately I’ve been looking at the art people make of us.  There was one set of individual painted panels in the Art Nouveau style that if I could have figured out the artist I would have tried to buy.  They were incredible”
Bruce has no idea how this conversation’s going to go.  How he’s going to tell the best friend he’s ever had that he’s palling around Europe with the guy who’d offed Howard and Maria
“I think that’s as good a solution as any,” Bruce agrees.
Steve shrugs. “Medium?”
His smile at the sight of Steve betrays all the chill he’s trying to portray.
Rumlow looks like he’s going to fight back, but Natasha steps up to Clint’s left, with her arms crossed like she means business. You’d have to be a straight up idiot to take them both on at once.  Brock looks to Steve for assistance, and Steve just glares.  Brock thinks better of his clenched fists and jogs away to catch up to the rest of his team, mumbling slurs under his breath.  He’s pissed, and he can stay pissed.  Steve’s not going after him to play nice
“You did, Sir,” Jarvis agrees. “SHIELD agents are experiencing unprecedented uptime and productivity. I assure you there was no harm done.”
“Oh, well, that’s nice of them,” Tony says. “Don’t know why you’d complain about that.”
Tony’s eyes narrow slightly at Steve’s sad attempt at a joke.  “Fine.  Ask away.  I couldn’t feel any more like shit if I tried.”
Tony’s thoughts on Hulk have always differed from Steve’s, but there is some comfort in knowing that no matter how bad things get, at least one member of the team is protected.
“Where did you learn to make this?” he asks.
“Mind if I go down and join him?” Bruce asks. “He’s got a covariance where he needs a correlation.”
There is silence from the bathroom, and then the front door flies open and Clint’s standing there in nothing but a towel and a triumphant grin.
Mae’s face softens.  “Oh, Lord.”  She leaves the cloth where it is and comes over to sit next to him.  “You designed the milkshakes.  They’re yours to name.
“If I’ve got astronomy questions while the documentary is on, you’ve got to answer them without trailing off or acting like it’s no big deal you know the answer off the top of your head.  No playin’ dumb.  Not with me.”  Steve softens his words by tugging Tony a couple of inches closer. “Deal?”
“Considering Bruce knows what a bad idea it might be to have you and James in a room together, it must be a pretty big deal if he’s willing to ask you to do that,” Steve comments.
There’s another pause.
Another screen flicks on and Sam and Nat appear. They’re in the Quinjet now.
“I stopped asking their names.  It didn’t matter.  And I’m not seeing a doctor.  Just go.  Leave me alone,” Tony pleads.
“To answer your question, I didn’t know what kind of bagels you like and I was hungry-- figured I’d let you pick first then eat the rest.”
“Forget it,” Tony interrupts.
“Because he was hot and you’re sick of dealing with the perpetually damaged?” Tony guesses. “See? I didn’t need to ask. Got in on my first try.”
“Anything else I should know?” Tony asks, as they make their way up the few stairs to Nanna’s door.
He’s still on his knees, and he’s glaring at Tony like he honesty believes Tony’s hiding these answers to be a dick.  Like somehow Tony’s the key to making it all make sense.   Which is utter bullshit, because Tony’s flying just as blind as the rest of them.
Steve flips the television channel away from the breaking news to a documentary about national parks.  He stares at a magazine until his eyes blur.  Tony spends his time tapping on the wrist display of his suit.  Steve doesn’t ask what he’s doing.  He’s just glad Tony’s here.
That had lasted until just now.  Steve wasn’t eating (except for the BannerBar Tony’d hassled him into swallowing whole).  He was barely drinking.   He hadn’t slept.  Whatever he’d found, Tony needed to know.  Turns out, Steve had found the Winter Soldier's medical experimentation files.
“Wait. What?” Steve asks. Because now it’s his turn to be confused. “I never said that.”
“Yes you do,” Tony says, popping open the driver’s side door of the bright orange QuickCar.  “Now get in.  The seat will move back.  You aren’t that much taller than me.”
Steve reaches for Tony, who is still flat on his back. He helps him sit up and then rolls him closer so they can kiss.
This story is an absolute joy to write, thanks largely to all the feedback from you!  When I realized this chapter was over 7,000 words I just about died.
“Yeah, well, he needs me.  What can I say?”
. You’ve got to stop being so cavalier about your safety.”
“Ummmm... or not.  We’ve got incoming,” Clint says suddenly.
“And look.  I know you’ve got no reason to believe me,” Clint adds, as he sits back down at the table, “But I am giving you my word-- no one’s putting you back in that chair.  I would kill to keep you out of that chair.  Hell, I would
“You shouldn’t be here-- I have to tough it out--  like a man--”
Thankfully they make it back to tower without Tony saying anything idiotic or embarrassing despite what is now an absolute and undeniable crush.  JARVIS lets them know that Sam and Natasha have returned, and Steve and Tony split up for a bit with plans to meet up with everyone for dinner.
There’s really not much he wants to do less, but if he wants to prove to the coaches that he’s got his shit together, that’s what this is going to take.
Bruce shakes his head and laughs as James gave Clint a slight, acknowledging tilt of his head.
Tony stares at him, looking sleep-rumpled and confused.
“Fuck salad,” Tony says, as Steve lowers the phone.  “We’re getting burgers and fries.  And we’re getting the hell out of Brooklyn.  I’m making an executive decision to say goodbye to these ghosts and get us back to my home turf.  That cool with you?”
Tony rolls his eyes and grabs for the receipt regardless, but Natasha’s got reflexes like a cat.  She snatches it up and yanks it back.
“I’m not trying to fix him,” Bruce sighs. “I’m just trying not to make him any worse. And in the moments when it counts-- when he’s out of it and dangerous-- I’m fucking useless because I’ve got bigger problems to deal with than saying the right thing. Why does anyone come within a mile of me? Fuck.”
“Must not have been in too big a hurry if it took you two whole days,” Tony points out from where he sits on top of the security counter.  He’s got a Starkpad in one hand and he’s typing without looking up.
THANK YOU SO MUCH for reading!  Kudos and comments are love!
“Wow,” Tony says. “Didn’t realize shell casings were the secret ingredient in Hangover Stew.”
Steve always forgets how observant Bucky can be about every single word.
me to do.”
“Yeah, you are.”
“What’s wrong?” Rhodey asks.
Steve’s tone is light but his words carry weight.
"The 7th floor?" Tony asks with a yawn.  "Isn't that the Security Admin Department?  What's he doing there?"
“Oh my god, Captain America swam naked with dudes,” Tony exclaims.
“What?” Steve asks, pulling back a little so he can see Tony’s face.
“So fourteen-year-old-you didn’t hate me, at least,” Steve says, without realizing for a moment that he’s said it out loud.
“Europe,” Natasha says.  “No more than that.  The less we know, the less there is to give away in case of capture.”
“Tony--” Steve starts.
Clint gives James a once over with his eyes and then grabs for his bag.
,” Clint whines, banging his fist down onto the table in front of Bruce and Kate.
Bruce smiles and shrugs. “Most of us have it coming.”
“Sounds good,” Tony says.  “Keep it coming.”
Tony turns to Rhodey and adds “You have put a ring on it, right? A woman like this doesn’t drop her standards for a loser like you every day. You’re not going to do better.”
“Keep trying,” Tony instructs.  “And initiate the Flea Circus Protocol, while you’re at it.”
“I take that as a compliment, sir.”
“If you aren’t comfortable with this, I can stop at any time,” Bruce assures James. “There are other ways.”
“I never thought I’d get here,” Tony says.
When it’s nearing noon, it’s time for them to go. Rhodey has work and Pepper’s got a meeting. Steve hates to see them leave.
“Don’t encourage this,” James says, fixing Bruce with a look that only conveys the littlest bit of murder. “It smells like burning.”
“I am so sorry to put you through this,” Bruce tells James, though he’s smiling. “They mean well.”
“You’re just mentioning this now?” Bucky asks, sounding slightly exasperated.
“What about Stark?” James asks.
Sorry this took ages but it was hard to get just right and I ~wanted~ it to be just right!
Steve bumps Tony lightly, and Tony bumps Steve back.  He's pretty sure he hasn't flirted like this in oh... twenty years?
“That’s better,” Rhodey says. “And tomorrow, Jenny and I will come by after breakfast. She’s been begging to skate. You could join us?”
“Do you know anything about art pads at all?” Steve asks.
“No you don’t.  Most of the time you tell me you don’t even like me and Rhodey.”
Tony picks up a mug and flings it at the ramp. It breaks apart with a loud crack and joins the mess on the roof below.  “Not quite as impressive as your throw, but it gets the job done.”
Still maintains he doesn’t know it.
“I know that now,” Steve says. “At the time, I was maybe a little less sure. The IT department at SHIELD liked to prank me by seeing how many lies I’d believe before I caught on. But you’re missing the point. I didn’t want to look at those specific pictures. If you ever feel like getting creative with your phone and you’re sending them just to me...”
There's an obvious answer.  An elephant in the room (his mind's room) that Tony's been studiously avoiding giving any thought: Steve.
“We’ll steer clear,” Natasha says through the speaker. “Jarvis can let us know if you need us.”
It’s a little anticlimactic as far as instructions to blow up a hill go, but they aren’t here for the fun of it.
“There’s no time,” Natasha says. “Sam, shoot him.”
Clint snorts.  “Understatement.”
He’s cut off as the steady beeps from James’s monitors begin to speed up to something more irregular and his neural alarms go off. Bruce is on his feet in an instant. James looks okay, he isn’t seizing and his eyes are still closed. The neural monitors are showing increased activity, though.
“That makes it sound like no one knew.  There were people who did. Peggy for one. The Howling Commandos. Your dad.”
“After the initial pain goes away, what’s left is like a ghost.  The sharpness fades, but there’s still something aching there. I guess my brain expects it to hurt so it’s like an itch I can’t scratch. I can feel the bone mending and that’s not something I think a person is supposed to notice,” Steve adds. “I just have to keep telling myself the pain’s not real and it’ll calm down after a few days. I mostly try not to think about it and by the time I do, it's usually manageable.”
“I guess I picked a good blanket,” Steve says.
Steve doesn’t know what to make of that.
“I overthink my words,” Bruce explains. “I want to be careful because people can be self-conscious when there’s something about them that isn’t typical. Not many people have metal arms.”
“Tony.”
Clint yawns, finally awake, and nudges himself up onto his un-injured elbow.  “Hey, future boy right here, and I think it’s weird. too. I vote we all talk to Bruce.”
Reading in the paper, two weeks later, that Tony and Sean have broken up, is even better.
“I wasn’t chirping anyone!” Clint protests.
And that’s what Steve is to them. An embarrassment. A mess. An error.
“I saw it,”  Natasha says.  “Pepper emailed me the clip right after it aired.  Shayla’s lucky she was on the next flight out of New York.  It’d be a shame if something bad had happened to her.”
But not half as hot
100 - Unknown Awesome (Photographic proof required.)  (No sex tapes.) (SERIOUSLY NO SEX TAPES CLINT.)
Steve considers his response.  “No man left behind?”
And thanks as always for all the kudos and comments!  You keep me writing. <3
It’s Clint who finds him up on the roof, sitting with his back against the landing pad’s dropped edge, hidden from view.
“Depends on what I’ve been doing in bed,” Steve says.  His tone is pure innocence, but his smirk gives him away and Tony’s mouth drops open slightly.
have notified Stark Industries Human Resources Department that they entered into a consensual relationship on or around
Once outside, they’re on a tiny back patio, hidden from the alley by large, blue-painted, planks of wood.  There’s a picnic table and a trash can and not much else.
“She’s Russian,” Sam says. “She can out-drink us Americans by a metric mile.”
Steve can see the slow, dawning misery on Tony’s face.  Like everything he’s done for the last six weeks is slotting into place in his memories.  Like the full weight of what he’s done is settling on him.
“Promise me we’ll come back up here,” Tony says.
“No way you’re pawning off Pepé Le Pew on us,” Tony objects.
“Understood, sir,” Jarvis agrees.
Bucky leans in to tackle-kiss Clint as the beer (that Tony hadn’t seen anyone order) arrives.  There’s a tray of fries, too, on a giant communal platter, and they’re smothered in cheese and bacon and ranch dressing.  Tony hasn’t seen anything like it since college, and that was always on other people’s tables.
Bruce sits up with a start. He doesn't go peek in at James no matter how tempting it is. He’d told James they don’t intend to trap him here and allowing him space is the easiest way to prove that.  Bruce heads for the bathroom instead. He hadn’t bothered washing up the night before and he really should have.  He’s disgusting.
“Jarvis, what’s going on?”
“I work better when I multi-task,” Tony says.
“Or you can just have as many StarkBars as I’ve got left?” Bruce asks. “Whatever you want. You know your body better than I do.”
“I like that plan already,” Steve agrees.
He’s happy. He’s secure. He’s got hope for a happier future.
“You’ll have a better chance of figuring it out than I will,” Bruce says. “And if you want to speak to him, he said once he’s up from his nap, he might be willing to see you. Even sounded like he was looking forward to it.”
Steve appears on the screen again behind Tony, bursting through the lab door with a gigantic bag slung over his shoulder and a lightness in his expression Bruce has never seen. Like the weight of the world has fallen away.
Steve can only imagine how frustrating that must be for Jarvis.
“Seriously?” Bucky asks, repeating Clint in both word and facial expression.
“Ana and Jarvis were the ones who raised me,” Tony says.  “They couldn’t have kids.  I didn’t know that until I was older.  Ana always said they had me around, why would they need anything more?”
“This is all going to be fine,” Tony says.  “You know that, right?”
“You and Natasha good now?” Steve asks, once he and Tony are in their bedroom, stripping down for a shower.
Right. Steve texts Jarvis.
“Give me a minute,” Steve says. “I’ll throw some stuff for us into a bag.”
“Hello to you, too,” Steve says gently.  “And no.  I came straight here, like you asked.  What’s going on?”
“You’re not-- I mean, you don’t owe me this.  The money is no strings attached.”
“Natasha, think you could give us a minute?” Tony asks.
“I need to go,” Steve says apologetically. “It was great meeting you, though. I can’t tell you how happy I am to know Boop lived a long, happy life. And here. Let me write down my phone number. I’d love for you to meet Tony. Maybe you could come by the tower sometime?”
“I can go either way,” Tony says. “Story of my life.”
“I’m sorry,” he starts.  Because he is sorry.  “I know this is a long shot, but is Mr. Stark in today?”
“Time to haul ass,” Bucky says, pointing toward the van.
The quiet in the room stretches out on under Cap’s unrelenting glare.  When Steve speaks again, his voice is low and deadly serious.  This is not the Captain America these people think they know.  This is Steve Rogers: protective, battle-hardened and mad as shit that these assholes think they’re going to bully a member of his team.
more emotionally compromised than when it comes to Rhodey or Pepper.  Where I think I’d be screwed-- and where so far you’re not doing any better-- is that getting yourself shot is not going to bring him back.”
“Yes, dad,” Clint says, before shoving his knee into the back of Tony’s seat.
“I’m good with sharing a bed,” Steve interrupts, looking nothing but amused at Tony’s attempt at repairing his overstep.  “And tearing this bed apart sounds like a promising way to spend the afternoon.  Seeing James was... rough.”
“I know-- I know,” Steve says, before Tony can speak. “I shouldn’t get my hopes up. James might hate me. He’s not Bucky. This could all go so wrong.”
“Who says I’m not?” Steve asks in false affront.
James lets out a slow breath. “I trust you,” he says. “And I trust Clint. The other two can stay if you think it’s a good idea.”
“They’re pulling into the server lot now.  They’re gonna have to shut off their transmissions to keep from giving anything away.  Us, too.  Radio silence in 3... 2... 1.”
“When do you need it?”
Clint lifts his water in salute.  “It’s about damn time.”
The drive back to the tower is a quiet one.  Steve knows that if Tony wants to talk, he’ll talk.  They hold hands for most of the trip, and when the traffic picks up and Steve needs both hands on the wheel, Tony rest his fingers on Steve’s thigh.  It’s nice.
“I’ve wanted you since that night you told Sean off for forcing the gag on me.  There you were, Captain fucking America, back from the dead, and as good and righteous as every story I ever heard.”  Tony sounds wrecked.  Haunted.  “You were the perfect person for me to want because you were never going to want me back.  I could daydream about you and it was going to hurt indefinitely because you would never be interested and that’s what I deserve.  And then you had to go and be bi.  Which-- thanks for head’s up, by the way.  It felt great finding that out three years after everyone else.”
“Steve, I heard you were getting out.” Happy said in relief.
“He always works too hard, trying to push himself.” She muttered.
“Old enough.”
“Please.”
Bucky smiled and kissed Steve's cheek. He looked at Rumlow. "What are you waiting for? Start the car."
“I just wanna say that Steve will be mine and I will not back down.” Of course, Tony just had to start a war. Happy sighed in exhaustion. It’s gonna be along night for him.
Steve heard a knock and was curious to who was at the door. He switched off his TV and figured it was either Sam, Wanda or Nat. He opened to see the last person he wanted to see.
“Well that won’t do, Steve deserves the best.”
Both Betas stare at him wide eyed and slowly smirking at him.
Happy gulped. "Yes, sir."
Bucky thought hard. Maybe this could play to his advantage. He looked at Wilson. "Maybe you didn't fuck up entirely." To which Rumlow and Wade looked weirdly at each other.
"He won't talk to me!"
“10? How do we know where Steve is?”
“To be honest I don’t know.” He looked down.
"Yeah...about that. I don't." She said lowly.
Happy panicked. “Oh dear God.”
Tony hold his cheek in shock, couldn't digest the fact that the omega hit him. He looked at the Omega who glared at him.
Sam blushed in a variety shades of reds”, stunned by the act. “O-Oh uhm yeah.”
“I should give you more flowers then.”
Sharon worriedly nodded. Steve got out of the bar to which Bucky quickly slides his hand around his waist and walked towards the VIP room. Steve wanted to push that hand so badly but he didn't want to make a scene especially on his first day. They entered the room and Steve pushed Bucky away.
"What?!" Steve looked at him shocked.
With a huffed, Pietro took a deep breath and looked at Wanda seriously. "Wanda. Listen to me right now. Make sure Steve stays the hell away from Barnes."
"I brought him with me actually. Come on, Steve." Peter motioned Steve behind the door to get inside.
Bucky whispered in his ear, his warm breath tickling Steve’s nerves. Steve knew it was Russian, he heard Bucky talks with his father sometimes in their mother tongue. Most of the times, it was just arguments. The Omega was taken aback why he is suddenly speaking in Russian.
Natasha walked in his office furious as ever. “What the hell Barnes?!”
Steve sighed. “A-Alright.” Smiled a little at the kind Beta who sighed in relief. “Just not today. Maybe tomorrow?”
"Oh yeah, Coulson. Very enthusiastic about protecting Omegas."
Steve scrambled against the strong hold, attempting to get out but no avail. “Let..me..go!”
"Of course." They both reached the door and Peter knocked.
Sam smiled. “You surprised me alright. I’m sure Steve will too.” He then sighed.
“I made pancakes with banana and mango puree. I want to show my gratitude for yesterday. You paid my medical expenses which I could never thank enough-“
