doesn't see it.  You talk the way people do when they...when they miss someone, even when Stark is standing right in front of you."
"We do need new weapons and repairs," Steve says thoughtfully. "If I can get you into a mechanic's shop, you think you can manage?"
Steve is not gay or even bisexual, he knows this well, but maybe the universe will always make exceptions for Tony Stark.
and realized how much Tony could hurt - but seventy years missing.  And Ultron.  And Howard Stark.  And the Accords, and Bucky.  Because there's always a fucking
"It won't happen again," Tony whispers.  "I - I slipped, was an accident. I've been doing well.  I just - I don' know what came over me."
In the early months they wake up in each other's arms every morning and it is lazy and warm and beautiful.  Steve cracks open his eyes on Saturdays and there's Tony, softer and smaller somehow in sleep, curled up against Steve's chest with his hair all tufty and his mouth slightly open.  Steve runs his hand through the thick locks, treasuring the way Tony mumbles inaudibly as he's wont to do at any affectionate touch, and marvels at how this man - this kind, intelligent, brave, amazing man - is all his.
To her credit, Natasha doesn't even twitch at hearing her words repeated back to her. Instead, she shrugs. "We know who you are. We know what you've done. I didn't think you were worth it, but Steve doesn't believe in abandoning someone who could be saved."
"Yeah," Tony says, and he laughs a little, dry and worn.  "They've been visiting while you were out, but they're back at the Tower to shower now.  You were...you were the only one who was hurt."
In hindsight, he doesn't know how he didn't see it before.  The drinking, that is. Well, he knew about it, of course, Tony's little habits, but he'd foolishly thought it would stop.  That Tony would see him before he saw the drink. He was wrong.
"Steve, huh?" Tony says interestedly. He wonders who this "Steve" is, what he looks like – he imagines some rugged older guy, maybe a father figure, with a thick dark beard and caring eyes. His intrigue is almost enough to stop the mild flinch he makes when he registers the rest of the words –
"Yeah, okay," Tony agrees, and that's that.  By this time, Steve doesn't even have to deal with Tony's alcohol issues, because it's been several months since his breakup with Pepper and he's okay now that he's got Steve.
Stark Tower, despite having known his teammates for quite a long while, Tony rarely let his mask down.  Lately, however, he'd been showing his softer side more and more often, and Steve subsequently found himself being even more drawn to the beautiful enigma that was Tony Stark.
He gently eases his legs off the table and stands gingerly, one hand on the table in case he collapses. After flexing his muscles and deciding he's okay to move, he walks over to his bag and rummages through the contents to make sure everything's in order. His weapons are missing – makes sense – but his wristwatch is still there, and so is his water.
"Umm," Tony says. He glances back and forth between the faces at the table. Natasha's mouth is drawn tight, and Barnes looks like a caged animal. "I don't know what it is I did, or if you guys just hate me because I'm bi or a whore or whatever, but I swear I'm not actually that bad." He winces – smooth, Stark, what a great way to prove you're an okay person despite everything. He hopes he hasn't unintentionally reminded them of the slew of sex tapes he's got on the Internet, because he has the feeling the tapes wouldn't impress them. "I've been told I'm narcissistic and don't play well with others, but other than my laundry list of character defects, I'm not
"I miss you, JARV," he murmurs, even though JARVIS is right here. What he really means is this – he misses building, creating, inventing in his workshop, with JARVIS's soothing voice offering advice and pointing out errors by his side. He misses the Before, even the Before with Howard, because at least then he had a home.
Tony's still on TV, of course he is, and he's still churning out these amazing wondrous inventions that never fail to make Steve's eyes widen and his jaw slip even if he doesn't understand a single bit of science lingo.  They say Tony's saving the environment, with those plans for green energy and turning toxic waste into life-friendly fuel.  They say...they say Tony is a
"Oh. Huh. That was easy." Tony thinks for a second. "Make it easy for me, J. Where exactly is that?"
He makes his way back to his room slowly, massaging his chest but carefully avoiding the area where his injuries are located. There is no door – no privacy – so he has to be careful. Easing himself up onto the table, he places his bag next to him and rummages around for his map and a pen.
He tries to sit up and regrets the decision a second later when his chest flares with pain again. Wheezing, he lies back down, constraining himself to only turning his head.
Tony turns his attention to the people across the table. There's Bruce, and then Natasha, and then Clint. None of them are Steve. He nods at the one empty chair with his chin. "That one's for Steve, then?"
He holds out a hand and wiggles his fingers. He doesn't have his ring on him; it's somewhere at home, a symbol of his old life and the way he'd left it, but he likes to think he doesn't need it anyway. "Got a brass rat?"
Maybe he should ask Steve about that mechanic's shop now. Zombies should be no match for his weaponry as soon as he gets his hands on some actual tools. In any case, the sooner he proves his worth to the group, the better.
"We talked about this," Steve says quietly.  The truth is, he's never really understood alcoholism.  Sure, he's seen the effects - shitty people doing shitty things - but how can anything just
"Bye, Buck.  See you, Sam."  In the doorway, they're already looking at each other, not even really seeing Steve; Bucky looks happier than ever and Sam's face is crinkled up with uncharacteristic softness.  They wave at him, and grin, but their gazes keep darting back to one another every point three seconds and Steve finally takes pity - on them or himself, he isn't sure - and shuts the door.
Tony beams at him. "Duh. It took me a bit to recognize you, but then – well. I've definitely stalked you."
Tony, who had been just about to fork up a meatball, dropped his utensil with an ear splitting clang.  "What the hell, Rhodey?  You want him to give me that Disappointed Stare and then proceed to smash me into bits with that shield of his, don't you.  Didn't we just go over this?"
It was dark and oddly quiet in the arena.  Even with his serum-enhanced hearing, Steve couldn't pick out anything.  Wait.  No.  He was careful not to show any hint of a reaction, but now the faintest sounds of breathing reached his ears…
There's a sudden noise, like the snap of a twig underfoot, and Tony jerks around, his hand already closing around the grip of his handgun. He flicks the safety off with a smooth swipe of his thumb.
Tony's eyes finally lift to meet his, and when they do, Steve's taken aback by how empty they are.  "Okay," he says slowly, cupping the coffee mug to his chest. "See you later, Steve."
"Oh, great." Tony thinks for a second. With any luck, his godfather – Obie – is going to be there, hopefully alive and well. Obie's rich as sin, so he'd probably paid for tons of defense mechanisms in the early stages of the apocalypse. "I'm going there, too."
"Alright," Tony says, smiling a little as he snuggles back into the bed.  "Have fun, although I don't know why you would subject yourself to such torture."
When he next awakens, he's alone again. His bandages have been changed and there's a jacket pillowed beneath his head, but other than that, he's relatively untouched. He sits up with a groan and is surprised to note that the pain, while still present, is nowhere near as bad as it was the last time he was awake. Maybe Natasha had stuck him with some pain meds.
This, at least, is true – he would like to thank Steve, maybe find a way to repay him. Quite frankly, he's extremely lucky that these strangers had recognized his face and still opted to help him. Not many people would be willing to spare their resources on a rich, spoiled brat.
Tony's heard worse.  Steve knows Tony knows he's heard worse.  But this is probably the first time Steve's ever gone for their relationship like that, and they both know it.
Here's the thing about Steve: he grew up during the Great Depression, with a father who drank and beat his mother.  And then he drove a plane into the ice and woke up seventy years in the future, only to realize he had nobody left.
taken hundreds of photos of their little makeout session.  Because he finally felt centered in a world that for so long felt strange and unnatural.  The twenty first century no longer represented all the things of the past he had lost, it now represented the future.  He had Tony, he had a
Tony exclaims, briefly forgetting that there are other people at the table. "You're the guy who figured out how to artificially age organic materials with the post-irradiation effect!"
"Breakfast?" Tony says dumbly. For some reason, he hadn't expected these people to feed him, not after having gone through so much trouble already to save him.
Tony waits till Steve is halfway down the hall before calling out, "Stark is my father. Call me Tony!"
"I adapt easily," he says. "Just because I'm rich, or whatever else you've heard about me, doesn't mean I'm not capable of taking care of myself or handling tough situations." He narrows his eyes.
He hears a chorus of affirmations and he's turning, scanning the skies for a familiar red and gold suit, when he hears a clank behind him.  A metallic clank - one of the last Doombots, struggling to stand again, spindly arm raised in a last ditch effort to hurt.
Tony just hums at him.  Only his eyes are visible now over the line of the blanket, and Steve wants to take a picture of the adorableness - to tell FRIDAY to - but the AI only does passive scanning in the bedrooms.  Oh, well. He's got enough snapshots of Tony in the living room and the kitchen and on his phone to last him a lifetime.
They've never directly talked about it before, but Tony must be aware of how much Steve hates it when Tony drinks.
Suddenly he feels nausea bubble up in his throat and he dry heaves, tasting regurgitated hash brown on his tongue. He swallows it back down, gagging harshly, and presses his palms flat to his thighs in a futile effort to calm down.
"I know," Tony says.  He is still being quiet, uncharacteristically so; it makes Steve's head itch with something he doesn't know how to define.  He feels wild and untethered, unraveling. Something between them is coming loose right here, in this moment, and he doesn't know if they can fix it.  "I'm sorry. I just - it really does help me focus. I wasn't really...I was having a hard time last night."
"I'm trying to make up for my mistakes," Tony says quietly.  His hands tremble a little around his mug, and Steve wants to take them and kiss his knuckles to calm him down.  But he doesn't, because love has never been that easy.
"You're an idiot," Rhodey proclaimed, throwing a hand in the air.  His other hand was preoccupied with stirring a pot filled with marinara sauce.  The two were chatting in Tony's private kitchen in the Tower, similar to the one downstairs, but without the other Avengers' access.
you.  You think you're so hard to love, but you're not.  A little difficult at times, but you.  Are a wonderful human being.  If I didn't see you as my little brother, I'd probably want to kiss you too."  He paused.  "Don't let that get to your head though.  Anyway, you're funny, and kind, and a sarcastic shit when you want to be, and you do things for people without expecting a 'thank you'.  You can be real stupid sometimes, I'd be the first one to tell you if you ever went wrong and you know it, but you have a heart of gold.  Honestly, I'd go so far as to say you're way too good for that blonde haired, blue eyed discount Thor."
"You're welcome," Steve says, stilted. Normally Tony would feel a little bit offended, but for some reason, he's not getting any hostile vibes from Steve. In fact, the guy looks rather awkward. "I don't believe in leaving people to die. I would've done it for anyone."
It starts that Steve forgets to come down to the workshop more and more.  At least, that's what he tells himself, that he just forgot and he'll remember next time.  He used to draw in there all the time on that ratty old couch, sketching the way Tony looked in his element - all bright-eyed and steady - but now he sees the gym and it's like…  It's like, he just thinks,
"It didn't smell like a little," Steve finds himself saying, even though it did.  Maybe he wants to test Tony. Maybe he wants to antagonize him, just a little, because he never said he was the perfect boyfriend, Mr. Nice Guy.  That's what the world said. All he did was show up in good condition.
It's ten o'clock.  Before he goes downstairs, he folds the blankets down Tony's body.  Tony mumbles something incoherent and thrashes a little, so Steve presses a quick kiss to his forehead to calm him down.  He must be having a nightmare.
"I didn't know you were interested in my research," Bruce says, leaning forward. His eyes are alight.
"Wait," Tony says, struggling to sit up again. "Wait! Who are you? Where am I? Why did you save me?"
Tony nods. "Incident photon pathways are easy to map out but much harder to make converge. What did you do?"
JARVIS isn't helpful in the technical sense; he contains all of the information that existed before the Internet went out, but knowing about the ingredients in coffee or when George Washington's birthday is isn't nearly as important as it used to be. JARVIS can't even track his location without a satellite connection; Tony's had to rely on his pitifully lacking knowledge of United States geography and a good old fashioned map. The AI's data is, however, stored on separate servers housed in the mansion at home, and unless the newfangled energy device Tony invented powers out, JARVIS stays with him.
"I know, I just slipped again, 'm sorry," Tony says.  His face is crumpling, which is shocking because Steve rarely ever sees him cry.  In this moment, however, he just looks gross - eyes swollen, cheeks red, mouth stinking with that acid tang.  Another wave of revulsion washes over Steve. This is the man he's
From his awkward vantage point, he can only see three things – the walls on either side of him, and the ceiling. He's in some sort of storage room, lying on a table; a haphazard display of bloodied medical supplies and bandages lies on a tray next to him. His bag, looking surprisingly untouched, has been discarded against the wall.
"You're up early, Stark," Clint comments as he pops an orange slice into his mouth.  He's watching Tony like the bird he was adequately named for and it makes Steve uneasy.  Clint was affected hard too, by Ultron; there had been a small child in the rubble not unlike Clint's own Cooper that he'd been too late to save.  Steve had asked him about it, gently; Clint had refused to answer.
"Yeah, I guess," the engineer said.  He looked uncomfortable with the fact that Steve seemed to be implying he was a good person, and Steve wanted to hold him and tell him all the things he should love about himself.  But he couldn't.
but he's not really thinking properly and suddenly all the exhaustion of today hits him like a wave.
On Saturday Steve wakes up in bed with Tony in his arms.  He spends some time just looking at his lover - the slack mouth he emptied kisses into last night, the loosely curled hands that, just hours before, had been touching Steve, tugging and teasing and taking him.
Your senses are better than that."  The laser tag had been a small game, just Tony and Clint versus Steve and Natasha.  Thor was off in Asgard for some royal meetings and Bruce was working on a charity project in Bangalore.
Tony flinches, head jerking up with a start. He manages to get himself up on one elbow, high enough to see the source of the noise.
"Nothing."  Steve shakes his head and glances toward the TV, which is a huge mistake.  The channel has just changed to the opening of another Stark-Industries-owned boarding school for orphans or kids with no home to go to, and there's Tony, signature goatee framing a wide smile and dark eyes bright.  Bucky tracks his gaze to the pixelated figure onscreen and for a second, he looks at Steve like he's less Captain America and more Jack from Titanic.  Like Steve's a trainwreck waiting to happen, except more quiet and slow and like falling asleep in frigid waters rather than exploding.
He spent most of his teenage years drunk or high or fucking his way through Malibu; and because he was rich, and famous, he got away with it. Most cops turned a blind eye to his wild lifestyle, and he always had his father to bail him out.
Paterlini, a pianist, is a remnant of Tony's past with his mother. Don't get him wrong, he's more of a rock music kind of guy – he headbangs to AC/DC and dances embarrassingly to Black Sabbath in the shower and in the shop. But Maria Stark had always loved classical piano, and all types of sheet music, and she had introduced Tony to the instrumental world when he was a child. After she'd passed when Tony was twelve, piano had become his only tie to her, the only way he could drift off to music and still dream of her.
Tony sat up straighter on the couch.  "I'm not aiming for rejection.  A kiss was all I needed.  Now we can avoid each other and everything will be fine."
"Well." Tony twists his lips. "Sometimes you gotta run before you can walk. Let's see how quickly Steve can get me to a workshop, shall we?"
fault that his chest has been fucked up by glass shards. He'd caused the explosion, after all. He almost –
"Thanks, Tony," Steve says in surprise, taking it.  He offers Tony a smile. "I'd be happy to attend."
"He's better looking than Thor," Tony protested defensively before he realized what he was saying and shut up.
In hindsight, he thinks to himself, it's almost funny how much the apocalypse looks like what it is – an apocalypse. Global cinematography certainly pegged the stereotypes on their heads.
"Yeah, no, of course," Tony says, a little too loudly.  He snatches his hand back from Steve's in one fluid motion and stands, giving Steve a smile as he steps back.  "You need rest, I get that. I'm just glad you're okay, Winghead. Call me - um, call us - if you need something, alright?  I'll, we'll be here immediately. Okay?"
Their relationship only hits a pit after Tony creates a homicidal robot hellbent on murder and world destruction.  It's later on determined that much of the blame lies within Loki's sceptre itself rather than the billionaire who triggered its consciousness, but Steve cannot forget that Tony shouldn't have been messing around with this kind of thing in the first place.  He knows Tony; he knows Tony has a big heart and better intentions. But what Steve has learned from growing up in an abusive household and surviving most of World War Two is that intent rarely matters more than outcome. It is outcome that affects everything, that put bruises on Steve's mother's body and sent Steve seventy years into the future.
Clint looks up at him, the set of his mouth hard and angry. "I said, you're treating the outbreak like it's a joke. You and all the other rich folks, holed up in your gated communities and guarded homes while people like us are out here dying and fighting for our lives. So, what, you decided to come out here just to live like the rest of us for a day? Saw your first zombie and freaked out and decided to blow up the block?"
"Maybe you should go back down to the workshop," Steve says after a lengthy bit of silence, trying to mitigate the situation.  He looks at Tony, tries to convey some sort of apology through his gaze. "I'll come down later."
He spots a Rite Aid nearby, and decides to check it out. He ran out of medical supplies last week in a fruitless attempt to bandage a scraped knee, and while he's never been big on safety – hell, he built his first-ever robot while drunk – he's taken more care with cuts and bruises since the apocalypse began. According to the news headlines that had run for months before dwindling out, the zombie disease is only effective insofar as it's transmitted via open wounds. That's why most zombies tend to bite their victims once they get close enough – it's quick, easy, and effectively transfers germs.
At that, Tony can’t help but gasp a rattling laugh, “Peter surviving is worth everything, even death.”
“And look how that worked out.” His laugh is self-deprecating, he knows - his father is probably turning in his grave as they speak.
come back to his senses, he’s on Steve’s lap, face buried in the crook of his lover’s neck while gentle hands card through his damp hair.
over a strip of exposed tanned skin above the waist of his jeans. Tony’s collar was still slightly damp from bleaching his hair.
Something in Steve breaks, right then, something he never thought existed until this very moment; he knows his touch gentles as he pulls Anthony into his chest, its instinctual, it’s the same way he held his first born - with fierce love and protection. A shield against the rest of the world. Steve holds onto Anthony as tightly as the man clings to him, Steve easily lifts him and moves them to the battered cot, and lowers them down onto it. Anthony fits against him just as perfectly as Tony does, if a little sharper at the edges, and smelling of grease and whiskey -
Steve is vaguely aware that they’ll probably be stuffed on Vietnamese food for the next few days, but he can’t bring himself to care when Tony moans beneath him on the workshop’s couch, surging up to kiss his husband of so many years (and hopefully so many years more) and whisper words of adoration against his lips. Steve knew he’d think about Anthony and worry every now and again, but he knew to have faith in the conviction he’d heard in Anthony’s voice, to show the same faith in Anthony that Steve does in his husband; to never stop believing in him. And Anthony seemed like he was only just getting started. On the other hand, his time with Anthony made Steve grateful to have this perfect alien-invading-superheroing-life of theirs, with their wonderfully smart and sassy teenagers, and a husband that was his soulmate in every universe; because Anthony had been right, losing Tony
That hadn't been an easy night for Steve's conscious, but it was still a night he heald near and dear to his heart. Tony had chosen to understand his panic, rather than mock him or push him away for it. Steve didn't know many that would be as forgiving. Tony hadn't given up on him, despite their setbacks. And in the end, Tony had made flying okay again.

like a nice cardigan-” Steve offers, and feels a little more confident when Tony sputters on his drink and laughs.
Tony still has moments to himself, like game nights with Rhodey and brunches with Pepper, he’d spend time with his protégés Peter and Riri, or even just tinkering down in his workshop. However, Steve’s with him more often than not, even with their hectic and event-packed schedules, the blond never seems to
The blond gently nudges Tony’s chin to the side, nodding towards the mirror behind them and Tony does as silently instructed, jumping down from the counter Tony turns to look at his reflection in the mirror; his breath catches in his throat at the site, at the site of
Steve stares a bit longer, watching while Tony chuckles at his phone screen long enough for the Captain to take in the engineer’s features up close. They’d been closer together before, of course. But something about this moment, about the

Steve grins at the familiar kick drum and beats that begin to blare out through the suit’s speakers. Loud enough for the large majority of onlookers hearing it to show their confusion, even as they began humming along. The team had collectively had this song stuck in their heads for about two weeks when it had first released. To the point that, whatever room you’d walk into, you were likely to hear

It had been easier in the beginning, to give into what Steve wanted, no matter how much he put up with from Tony - he always said he loved the little ‘fighting spirit’ within his husband - there were just some things Steve wouldn’t tolerate. Tony remembered one particularly jarring incident, it had been after the implant was put in, Tony thinks…

and, as always, they die. They always die. Tony tries to stop it, tries preventing their deaths - the end of the world, the death of trillions - in his dreams and reality.
“Thank you,” Anthony whispers, it was a little broken, but stronger than before, “thank you so much.”
It doesn’t take a genius to have guessed who the large man Iron Man had set down likely was. However, with Steve holding his phone up and pointed towards his teammate, everyone else seemed to heed his example and do the same instead of crowding him. Steve watches his friend wave at people that begun to get a little too close, shooing them away while asking for a space of five feet, claiming it to be
“I’m sure it’s five in the afternoon somewhere,” Tony says, taking another drink - no point in hiding, Pepper of all people already knows how fucking messed up he is.
The two remain silent for a moment before Stark pulls back slightly to look down at his son, who pulls back and scrubs a hand down his splotchy face, “I’ll…I’ll try the old methods, maybe Clint’s morse-coding again.”
a sickening mixture of anger, fear, and - Tony didn’t know if it made him proud or scared to see - determined
Tony cradles the broken limb protectively to his chest, dark eyes scanning his surroundings in a vain effort to find an escape; the room around him is small, no bigger than a prison cell would be but instead dressed sterile-white with no windows and one door, decorated - and he uses that word lightly - with a single thin futon that was currently beneath him. Tony doesn’t know if it’s a relief or not that while he’s locked up in - what appears to be - a cell that could rival something out of a psych ward, and that he isn’t restrained.
Steve stands tall and authoritative in the middle of their living room, the lights were dimmed enough to make the normally ‘innocent’ looking Steve come across as menacing, but visible enough that Tony wouldn’t be able to mistake the glare in his oceanic eyes for anything else. He felt his knees go weak and skin rise, his hands began to shake, and Tony couldn’t tell if the cold trickle down his spine was of fear or…something else.
The brunet flinches when large hands cup his face, thumbs wiping away tears he was unaware of, and only then does he realize he’s trembling.
and Tony was a hard nut to crack. People mistook Tony’s confidence in himself for shamelessness - and hell, for a time, so did Steve. But over time, Steve was unsettled to learn that Tony didn't
He thinks of Clint and Natasha, cold and blue. “Why couldn't I protect you?!” He thinks of Thor and Bruce, dead bodies flinching in death to scar him. “You’re all my responsibility and I couldn’t even protect you!”
be converted were killed - like Stephen Strange, Thor, and Professor Xavier, again, to only name a few. However, those that couldn’t be killed - in the cases of people like Banner and Wolverine - would find themselves in Cryostasis, indefinitely. Not many ‘rebels’ were left, be it powered or no, they were labelled as ‘terrorists’ and had bounties on their heads. Tony had fought long and hard for the past year, the few of them remaining clinging to the hope that - one day - they’d be able to take down Hydra and break their iron-grip on the world, but days when even that wasn’t enough for Tony he’d look to Peter and force himself to
“Yeah,” Steve yells because he has to. “I’m good,” he says, clinging a little tighter when he feels the suit’s armour warm under his palms. He could feel the windburn developing on his cheeks. Tony never went anywhere near the suit’s actual potential, but it was still August in New York. Though Steve couldn’t bring himself to care, whatever little burns his cheeks endured would heal before they even landed anyway. They always did. The crisp pain of the cold contrasting with the warmth against his side was always a good reminder that he was okay. Held against his best friend and teammate while they flew over the city he was born in - even if he was still, technically, he was still relearning it.

The picture of the two of them, Steve with his bald head and Tony who looked like a member of the Blue Man Group, was plastered on newspapers all over the world. The duo sharing a post-battle kiss in celebration of a job well done. It hadn’t been the most ideal way to announce their relationship, but Steve couldn’t bring himself to care about the backlash. And while he was thankful for the support, all he

Static of what’s left of his nightmares remain in the inventor’s mind, trying to shove them away into the darkest recesses of his subconscious - he knows it’s not a healthy coping method; but it works, so who gives a shit? Running hands down his face the brunet huffs a tired sigh, the taste of bile finally subsides, and his skin no longer buzzes as though he’d vibrate out of it. This near nightly occurrence is now almost a routine for Tony Stark. Through any increment of slumber he somehow manages to fall into, he’s always awakened with nightmares that leave him in tears - though he’d never admit to it.
The brunet snorts at that, as if Jarvis were speaking as anything more than a program, but he nods regardless - maybe old habits really do die hard, but Tony wouldn't know, his habits never really do die.

Parker is up like a shot and bolts for the exit, Rogers catches on almost immediately, but Tony’s position gives him enough leverage to wrestle the man to the ground; he knows Steve has every advantage over him, but Tony just hopes he’s able to buy Peter enough time to escape. It’s a blur from that moment, because one second Tony’s managed to wrestle the super solider to the ground with him, and the next he’s slammed onto his back, gasping for breath as Captain Hydra glowers down at him - something akin to pride swells in Tony’s chest at the bloodied lip he’s managed to give the blond. Tony knows he’s probably going to die, is probably going to be beaten to death, or have his brains blown out onto the already grotesque concrete floor - if he should be so lucky. However, no matter the outcome, it would be worth it, knowing that he’d helped Peter get away - knows Peter escaped for a fact what with the way Steve’s eyes blacken as he glares down at Tony.
Steve goes silent, it’s unlike him and makes Tony feel the need to fill the quiet, but before he can the blond finally speaks.
The blond’s eyes go from the hidden camera on the corner ceiling and back down onto Tony, something within pools of blue the genius can’t comprehend. “But after Vision I thought…”

, “really Tony, anyone else would feel insulted, but you’re lucky I love that about you. Come now, I’m losing my patience.”

is all Steve can think, watching with astonished glee as Tony cheers on his new dance partner. Steve had seen street performers around the city before, but they never failed to amaze him every time. Well, not every time. The talent in New York varied, of course. Tony begins to belt the little spoken-word moment in the song, directing his attention to Steve for a moment. Then he turns his attention to all those around them, encouraging them to sing along. In the back of his mind, Steve was
Because that was the real question, wasn’t it? Would Anthony be okay? But what could Steve do if he wasn’t? Live with the guilt of knowing there was a version of his husband out there, a version he
“I’m not-” Steve tried, instinct telling him to tell the truth to the man who shares Tony’s face, but his words die off when the bundle in his arms croaks out a broken sob.
“YOU BASTARD!” Steve froze at the doorway of what appeared to be a nearly abandoned and smashed up bedroom, but all Steve could focus on was the profile of the man hunched over the foot of the torn up bed, “You PROMISED! You promised me that...that’d you wouldn’t leave, you promised- you self-righteous bastard you
The Captain’s expression changes at that, but not to the anger Tony tried to invoke, but into a twisted grin that makes Tony’s insides frost over.
. He stares down serenely as Tony screams in pain, Steve’s head tilts to the side as he smiles at the writhing brunet, “I’m not going to kill you Tony, I love you far too much to
“We have a son named Peter and daughter named Riri,” Anthony holds onto Steve a little tighter but doesn’t say a word, “they can drive us crazy, but we love them, and not to mention all the little rugrats too smart for their own good that we’ve adopted by proxy because Tony really doesn’t ever know when to stop,” Steve can feel the smile tugging at his lips at thoughts of his husband, and gives into the safe and warm feeling; the feeling of
That playful glint was back in Tony’s brilliant eyes before he'd even finished speaking. Steve felt helpless but to stare. “I respect it, Rogers.
, you’re fine don’t worry about it. But I texted Thor, just in case.” Maybe it's Tony's rambling, or whatever the hell Steve just barfed up that turned him into a human-glowstick. Or maybe it was the I-want-to-laugh-but-I-need-to-know-you’re-okay-first expression of muddled emotions on Tony's face. But whatever it was, it had Steve doubling over with laughter.
He knew this Look; Tony Stark had many ‘Looks’, and if you could figure them out - especially the nuanced flinches and stifled smiles - you found yourself the Rosetta Stone to - in Steve’s opinion - the best person to ever exist (only followed by versions of him from other dimensions, apparently). Because apparently, no matter the dimension, Tony Stark’s eyes would always be striking and expressive.
“-went haywire! And you got caught in the blast, because it effective JARVIS is CPU processors pretty badly and-”
he thought, in those final few seconds of peace, before the chaos struck. Steve had felt his skin burn and flay. Felt the blood in his veins freeze. Tasted the arctic in his throat, but he didn’t know which got him first.
Tony even sees a fluffy sky blue towel - his favorite towel to use after long baths - hung up and ready to be used where he’d always kept it for easy reach. Tony finally looks away from his surroundings to meet Steve’s eyes, the eyes of the man he once knew -

Tony’s breath stutters when Steve turns him onto his back whilst speaking, his large frame still concealing Tony from a majority of the lavatory, making it nearly impossible to see past him - though Tony knew that was the point, he feels like it’s some kind of poetic irony he’s failing to grasp. Steve was his world, had always been, and he knew - despite the threats, despite
“Someone needs to stand up to Fisk,” Anthony’s eyes blink open, and for a moment they’re sharper than they’ve ever been, “no one did before now and Steve paid the price, I can’t let anyone else-
Tony clings onto Steve just as tightly as the Captain grips onto him, “I love you,” Tony whispers against his lips for the first time since all of this had began, and he trembles, why? He doesn’t know, because it’s
“We found him scouting the parameter of the Compound, likely looking for…a former alley,” Natasha’s voice was steady, blunt like she’d always been - even before Hydra had gotten to her - but something was just…

If Tony was being honest, he could probably pinpoint the moment he’d doomed their relationship; it was the moment he told the world
that Steve no longer wanted to keep their relationship under-wraps. Though he understood why, really, he
“I love you too, Tony,” Steve whispers, talented hand still stroking through chocolate locks, the other wrapped around his waist, “sleep now.”
. I shouldn’t have been so quick to judge you, because now you’re-” he stops, swallows, and sighs. “You’re my teammate, Tony...and I never leave a man behind.”
“You did great today,” Tony says with a grin. Even with his skin and hair still a vivid blue, he looked like he didn’t have a care in the world.

“Tony,” the blond greets, voice light and warm, but it still sends a chill down Tony's spine. “I’ve missed you.”
He'd yelled at the man, remembered the acrid panic and venom in his voice. He’d hate the flights to and from battles, but he’d deal with it, he was a

Steve doesn’t realize he’s begun to cry until Anthony swipes a thumb over his flushed cheek, “I feel like you both have that in common, a big heart,” he says softly, adoringly (almost yearningly), as though to himself. “He stood up to Fisk, but Fisk and his men don’t play fair…Steve was about doin’ it
It had been a few months since Tony’s inexcusable outburst at his husband, longer since Steve had found him -
The first time Steve said it, it took Tony a little longer for the word to register, but that couldn’t be helped what with the way Steve all but
The blond stands upright and meets Tony’s gaze head on, “before Wanda and Pietro came onto our side, back when she was using her abilities against us and...and showed us all of our greatest fears.” Tony’s mind reels;
of it. After being kidnapped in Afghanistan he thought his nightmares couldn’t get any worse, that the torture he’d endured would be the only thing to plague his subconscious, and then - as the news stations had dubbed -
Steve had thought he held himself together well. At least, well enough no one mentioned how pale he’d become during the flight back to the tower. Maybe Tony had followed him, or maybe he'd just happened upon Steve when he was in the middle of an anxiety-attack-induced-emergency-clearing-of-his-stomach. Either way, Tony had found him and sat with Steve until he’d no longer tasted the Arctic in the back of his burning throat.
“I should have saved you, Steve…” Tony cries, too far gone to even think of hiding his fears any longer, and clutches onto the front of Steve’s shirt for some form of stability.
“We haven’t done a single truth yet,” Steve says as the thought occurs to him. They’d been so wrapped up in trying to outdo each other with the dares, that they’d forgotten about the
“I’m working out some kinks with Friday’s programming,” the brunet blatantly lies, struggling to his feet, and trying not to dig himself further into the hole he’s currently in; Tony forces a lazy smile. “What are you doing here, Capsicle?”
Tony thinks with a sob, scared he’d whimpered the words aloud with the way Steve smiles and whispers, “I’m never letting you go again, my love.”
Peter nods, already scanning through different radio signals trying to find any signs of life from the few friends they had left. Tony watches the teenager work for a moment, unbearably

Tony belatedly corrects when Steve fixes him with another darkened glare, feeling a shiver break out over his skin, but is interrupted before he can continue - the rounded point of his dress shoe ghosting over the swell at his crotch, and Tony has to fight back the urge to
“I mean honestly, Amalia? A superhero isn’t the worst babysitter they’ve had,” the mother with short hair - who introduced herself as Elena - says with a shrug, and Steve couldn’t help but chuckle sympathetically when the long-haired mother - Amalia - groans and sighs.
Tony really believed he’d lost Steve forever, but there he was, stood a head taller than Tony, thick arms braced around Tony’s shorter frame and nosing at his jaw - at his signature goatee. It was like coming home, like that first gasp of air after being trapped under water for too long; bliss. A wish come true.
It was one of those nights where it seemed like everything around you was turned down somehow. Nights where sounds weren't deafening, but a calming backdrop, like waves calmly lapping at the seashore. Nights where lights didn’t seem blinding, but instead calmly glittering like beautiful, warm starlight. Steve often wondered why these nights seemed so rare. Why they only came to fruition every blue moon, but then realized the missing ingredient to all his nights where everything otherwise seemed like too much; Tony Stark.
“He used to do that, too,” Anthony says with a soft chuckle, and Steve still saw the heartbreak in his honey eyes, but there was hope there now, too. “When Steve would get excited or be really relieved, a sigh and then the damndest adorable
Tony carefully moves to stand, walking over to the door, he tests the lock with no real hope that it would

, and even if he won’t admit it the brunet knows why he can’t solve such a simple question; because the reality is, he hasn’t been okay for a long time - maybe he’s finally reached his breaking point. Tony wraps a towel around his waist, about to step out of the shower only to slip, his hands desperately search for purchase, but upon the resounding crack of his knees hitting marble he knows he’s failed.
“Don’t tell me you have the hots for me, Cap,” the brunet teases, the blond reddens further, but his jaw is set - teeth undoubtedly gritting together.
Steve’s foot traces over the hard line of Tony’s prick, gaze focused on his crotch, not meeting Tony’s eyes when he speaks, “then let me clarify it for you; how was your night
like there’s had been, down to the detail of Steve’s art supplies and canvas in the corner for mornings when he wanted to sketch by the floor-to-ceiling windows, and the one book Tony refused to read in anything but the paper copy of (the copy his
He still remembered how sincere Tony's words were. How the knot of anxiety over possibly destroying the beginnings of their friendship had quelled almost instantly over those words.
Steve had dared him to bleach his entire head, facial hair included, which he did, hence the ink-stain on Steve’s front tooth.
and turn to stone mere seconds later. Instantly, Steve wished he could have somehow taken the words back. He
Tony thinks he should take Steve’s words as a slight against him, but when their lips connect once again, gentle and tender, the brunet thinks - for the first time in months - maybe, just maybe, he really isn’t alone in all this.
Tony chuckles weakly, “Pepper’s gone, Steve, the one person that kept me grounded...that gave me hope that maybe all this shit was worth it, and she’s
Despite the creation of Vision, Tony couldn't let go of Jarvis, and to this day the fact that it’s Jarvis is voice and not Friday’s that speaks to him in the privacy of his - rebuilt - Malibu home remains a secret. He’d lost everything after Ultron, but he’d admit his selfishness at being unable to let Jarvis go - especially not when the A.l. was all he had left. The brunet turns over and throws his legs over the edge of his bed, the dead weight of his limbs hang limply until Tony moves to stand, stumbling ever so slightly before righting himself and moves to the door of his room. There were times his teammates asked why he wasn't at the tower with them, and he’d always given them one excuse after another, but since Pepper had left him, they no longer asked why he needed his privacy. The media speculated, now that Tony was single again, that he was doing nothing but partying and humping anything that moved - a part of him wished they were right. It’d be so much easier if they were.
changed. For those that bowed to Hydra’s rule, their lives were relatively the same, but for those that refused to comply, well…they weren’t treated so kindly.

The brunet swallows thickly, turning over and allows his head to fall back against the couch cushions. He’s on his back and a part of him knows he should turn onto his side because at any moment he could choke on his own vomit, but a larger part of Tony can’t bring himself to care. The brunet feels as if the world’s rushing to his head, and chuckles at the fact that Tony’s probably the heaviest drinker he knows, and yet still hasn’t been this drunk since his senior prom. He vaguely remembers hearing a muffled
Tony wasn’t sure how long he’d been living back in his Malibu home, the rebuilding process had happened not long after it’s destruction, and had been finished long before the Avengers had taken care of destroying the last traces of Ultron. However, it was the night Pepper broke up with him that he’d drunkenly driven himself back here rather than to the tower, the next morning the brunet had looked around with glazed eyes and finally registered where he had brought himself; he’s been there ever since. The team would call on Tony whenever they’d assemble, which was sparsely since Ultron, and for that Tony was thankful - he didn’t think he could actually stomach putting up a front that much anymore.
If Steve is surprised, he doesn’t show it, instead his cold mask of Captain Hydra falls easily into place - eerily so - and Tony feels his heart in his throat; he knows any attempt to try to save Peter will only promise the boy’s death, “take him for reconditioning, and if he doesn’t submit, kill him.”
Steve reprimands and moves to stay away from the brittle grass, lest someone hear him approaching, and continues forward while kept safe in a cloak of darkness.
Tony’s cheeks felt chilled, the bare skin of his face exposed to the cold air and the final few strokes of Steve’s straight-razor, but it all fell to the wayside as Steve continued, “I never lied to you, Tony, I meant everything that was said and happened between us, but how many more wars would we have had to suffer through? How many battles would we have had to fight? How many more deaths to reach-”
“Shit!” Tony hisses, yanking his hand back from his soldering gun and almost burns his other hand in the process.
but then remembers who he’s talking to, “you’re sayin’ you’re from another reality, an’ you look almost
Any superheroes - and even villains - that had been were captured and refused to comply were sent off for ‘reprogramming’, Tony didn’t know all the details, but he knew enough; there were many times friends he’d fought along side with were captured, and the next time they’d meet, Tony would be fighting
Steve’s cheeks almost ache with his want to smile. Tony just had a way of doing that to him, but still tries playing it cool - Nat would be proud, maybe. “So what does a night alone with Tony Stark entail?”
Steve’s blue eyes trail down to the teenager knelt as feet, pressing the barrel of the gun a bit more firmly against the base of Peter’s skull, eyes snapping up to Tony in a silent threat; a slow and cruel smile spreads across Steve’s handsome features as he meets Tony’s eyes - the same look he’d given Tony before killing Rhodey. In that moment Tony knows that there are only two options; run and sacrifice Peter, or surrender and -
For a moment the blond looks sheepish but sighs, hand running through his hair - like it’s a hardship to even explain, “Pepper called me.”
unsure if he means his fresh face or Steve at his side. Staring at their reflection like this, it was easy to forget that the world outside their room was controlled by Hydra - by

will deem fit; Stark swallows his pride, casting a glance at Peter before slowly approaching Steve who watches his every move intently. Tony stops just out of the Captain’s reach and bends at the knees, carefully projecting his movements and intentions as he slowly lowers himself down onto all fours at Steve’s dirtied boots.
“Don’t fuck with me, Steve!” The brunet barks, anger grounding him to speak properly. “We both know what you fucking said, now spit it out! What did you mean?!”
“Hello, I’m America Chavez, and my friends and I are fans of yours, and we were hoping to get a picture with you?” She didn’t stumble on her words so much as sped through them, quick enough that Steve needed a moment for the meaning to set in. Looking over her shoulder, he noticed a group of four other kids, all looking varying shades of excited and
The brunet watches the blond’s fists ball up, and for a moment he wonders what it’d be like to get punched by a Super Soldier - because with the way Steve’s jaw tenses, he thinks he really might be hit. However, ever the Boy Scout, Steve does nothing more than breathe deeply to calm himself and answers - isn’t he just the pinnacle of rationality?
“Oh, did I forget to mention Bilgy and I play together whenever Thor’s away?” Tony looks far too pleased with himself. The massive beast huffs happily under Tony’s attention.
“Peter, I know you’re goggles got busted recent-” the words die on Tony’s tongue, his throat going dry as he stops in his tracks. “Steve.”
The maddened genius freezes, hands trembling as he speaks through clenched teeth, “what’s that supposed to mean?”
“We’re together again, my love,” Steve whispers against Tony’s skin, blue eyes meeting his hazel through the mirror, Tony swallows, thick and dry because….
The glare Steve fixes Tony with makes his skin break out in a cold sweat, “Tony, do you really want me to
“I love you Tony, okay?” The blond confesses, eye flashing with shock at his own words, but there’s no traces of a lie in his ever-telling eyes.
“I think we should head up before Nat uses this as an excuse to order one of everything again,” Tony says with a beaming smile and musical chuckle, darting forward to steal kiss.
“I don’t expect you to love me back...but please Tony, just...just give me the chance to show you you’re
Steve’s own smile freezes for a moment, unsure if he was helping or making the situation worse, but Anthony was trying to levity so maybe- suddenly, Anthony barks a laugh and pokes at Steve’s right cheek, “you don’t have a right dimple!”
“We thought you’d contact us if you were in any serious trouble, Tony,” the blond begins, and suddenly the genuine sadness and worry that seems to take over him is like a knee to the gut. “But, clearly, we should have been more attentive with you…”
“I did, Sir,” Jarvis chimes in helpfully, and for a moment Tony has the unexplainable want to dismantle his A.I. that is, until it registers that
“Can I tell you a truth?” Tony tips his head forward, nose gently bumping Steve’s jaw. “I think I’m in love with you, too.”
“Who let you in?” Tony is the first to break the silence, squinting over at Steve before rubbing the remaining sleep and crust from his eyes.
him, but instead we stood back until there was nothin’ left because we were all too afraid of Fisk and his men.”
more time would be all it took for Steve to kill him, snap his neck in an unrelenting fists, like he’d done to Rhodey,
Approaching the clearing of the small Florida town by the woods, Tony scans the area for any potential threats, upon finding none, he carefully walks along the shadows towards the sleepy town. His tattered clothes and scruffy beard were worlds away from the once instantly recognizable suave and well-groomed man people had known, but his unkempt appearance worked in his favor, because no one cast the genius a second glance - let alone a first. It only took a few hours to get what he needed, from a quick stop at a street vendor for canned goods to the junkyard for new cables, and a few minutes haggling with a street salesmen to buy Peter a new shirt. Tony would call it a successful trip, especially because at the junkyard Tony spotted a set of binoculars and snatched them up, knowing Peter’s goggles were hanging on to the teenager’s face by a literal thread - and maybe some webbing, Tony would bet.
like losing part of himself, because Tony was a part of Steve’s soul, and he would spend eternities in every universe with this man.
Tony knows the threat for what it is, knows that Steve would easily kill Peter if it meant it broke another part of Tony; if it reminded him that he could never

say. Anthony seemed like he’d be okay, and if that look told Steve anything, some version of the Iron Man armor was about to be worked on; that look of manic child-like excitement was reserved for the suit and
, Rogers?” Tony snarled, glaring at the blond and he wishes he could hate him - wishes that the image of Steve dying in his arms wasn’t still making his bones ache.
Steve turned his face towards the crook of Tony’s neck, keeping a safe distance from the suit’s joints, but resting his cheek on the seamless - and obnoxiously endearing red - shoulder plate. However, this was different. Since Steve had begun taking these little joyrides with Tony, which had begun as an idea of his own during a battle, they just...kept on doing it. Even outside of battle. The genius created a way for the armour to warm on the outside so Steve would have some source of warmth while they flew. The usual Captain America uniform was great at deflecting bullets, but it wasn't an insolation unit - that was a whole other suit. It was a strange relief to Steve, that flying with Tony never brought him to the edge of panic like flying usually did.
“I mean, would what be so bad? It left enough for leftovers for Peter and Ned to take to their roleplaying thingy, I think they packed some for MJ and Kamala too,” Steve counters, grinning just as goofily, playfully pulling Tony into him as he moves to stand.
“You sure you can do this, soldier?” Steve shivers as Tony whispers the words into his ear from behind, only
“We’ll find him, Stark,” the blond seethes, hands twitching as he stares down at the inventor, “and when we do, I’m going to skin him alive right in front of you.”
Steve, for the life of him, had no idea what Tony was referencing. But the playful twinkle in Tony's eyes was enough to make him huff and grin fondly at the man anyway. It seemed, around Tony, Steve was never anything but some kind of ‘fond.' It made Steve wonder when the ice had seemingly begun to seep from his bones because some days, the cold was all he could feel. But not tonight. Not now.
Tony concocted didn’t taste like the gasoline-flavoured whiskey that stung his throat back on the frontlines. Instead, Steve discovered what it would taste like if you crossed Fing Fang Foom’s spit with an Atlantean’s briefs. Steve had never moved faster in his life, even under live enemy fire, than he did right then. Darting over to the kitchen sink to yak out his guts. For a second Steve would
“What did you mean, earlier,” Tony questions, brown-eyes still watching Steve work around the kitchen.
who he was, even if that image of himself was torn apart and burnt to embers. There was no better analogy for the Phoenix than his best friend; the man who fell only to rise, and rise again. So knowing that Tony would do just about anything because he lived life with the mentality of
yours,” Tony whispers, voice trembling, and carefully clutches tighter at the front of the man’s uniform.
So, Steve turned on the tap, rinsed out his mouth a couple of times, before turning around to face the genius while grinning as smugly as he can. Because despite having hacked up his guts not-five minutes into the game, he was having fun. And more importantly, he was having fun
“Dad was flippin’ out! And called uncle Bruce-” Riri quickly began to explain, but was overlapped by Peter, who, at the same time as his sister, decided to tell their father what happened since he was gone.
It had been less than a week after Clint and Bucky’s realizations, and ensuing retaliations, that Steve stood dirty and tired in the middle of the street post-battle and smiling at Tony as the man walked up to him. The mission had been quick and simple, but still took a lot of energy out of them. Though, thankfully, there was little-to-no damage or harm caused by the end of it all.
, Tony ducks his head and captures Steve’s lips with his own; the Captain doesn’t hesitate, and neither does Peter.
“He’ll find me,” Steve says as he settles in, because he trusted Tony implicitly, and knew Tony would come for him no matter what. “Do you know what your gonna do next?”
“I still love you, Pepper, y’know that? Right?” Tony interrupts, and cringes at the way his voice almost cracks. “I-I need you to know that.”
“If I can help it,” Steve says, pulling his husband close, hands gently stroking at the waistband of Tony’s tattered jeans.
Tony surges forward, lips pressing against the blond’s, and it only takes Steve a fraction of a second to kiss back with unabated want. It’s such a simple thing, something Tony’s done hundreds - if not thousands - of times in his life, and yet unlike any time before it grounds him - no one but Pepper had ever made him feel this way. The two grapple onto each other, finding purchase by clutching onto the other’s clothes, until they pull away with a gasp and press their foreheads together. Tony doesn’t open his eyes, not yet; he wants to savor this warmth and safety within him
“Tony go!” Peter shouts, biting back a cry when the Captain hits him with the handle of the gun, a seething warning to
, thank you so much for doing that. I know it’s strange, but I just…I don’t know, you helped someone Steve; helped
, and whatever his eyes couldn’t perceive his other senses did. The building seemed larger than a regular house, which either meant a very rich owner (meaning security) or multiple owners living together (higher risk of being seen or caught), but either way, this was going to be far more annoying to get through than Steve first thought.
“Looks like it’s just you and me, Rogers,” Tony announces as he reaches for his root beer, swirling the remaining contents of it with a hum. “I wonder who’s more wholesome, you or Fred? Nah, you don’t wear cardigans, Mr. Rogers 2.0 wins this round.”
He still remembers the feeling of the weight falling off his shoulders at that moment as he cackles over Tony trying to maneuver his hips through the suit to dance. It was aggressively hilarious, and somehow
The blond stops, hand midair, and slowly lowers it as he searches Tony’s face for a silent and tense moment, “prove it.”
“No, no I wasn’t sent to Asgard, which you likely know since you’re the one who brought me back,” Steve tales his husband’s hands into his own, taking a deep breath before asking, “we promised full honesty, right?” and watched with a heavy heart as his husband’s relief at having him back was slowly morphing into apprehension and confusion.
For all that people thought he’d hate electronics, Steve was actually a quick learner and loved tablets especially.
Tony rolls his eyes, trying to shake off the guilt he feels coiling in his chest, “what is that supposed to mean?”
to blame. Unbeknownst to Steve nor Tony, Bucky and Clint decided to team up in revenge. Bucky got back at Tony by rigging his shower head with semi-permeant dye, and for a week, Tony was blue from head-to-toe. As for Steve’s penance, well...Tony said Steve didn’t look
"For me?” Tony does lean back a little, not enough that Steve can any longer deny what this moment between them was. ‘Just friends’ didn't sit like this, lean towards each other like they just couldn’t help themselves. But he needed to know if Tony felt it, too. “Yeah...yeah I do, Steve. Tell me a secret?”
” Steve swallows thickly as he plans out his next words, and softens his grip in case Anthony decides to pull away - Steve would let him go, no matter how much he may not want to, he’d still let him go if Anthony didn’t want to be held by him. Anthony may
had to grow up so fast. Turning away with a small smile, a ghost of one really, but seeing Peter fight so hard for those he loves and what he believes in never failed to give Tony some semblance of hope; that’s what Peter Parker had become to Tony,
over Tony; the brunet never left his sight unless absolutely necessary, when Tony wasn’t knelt by Steve’s side, head resting on the man’s muscled thigh, he was in the newly built nook in their room tinkering. It was terrifying, how complacent Tony was becoming with all this; a caged bird, happy to never fly again. No one dared look at Tony, never addressed him directly; those that had made those mistakes were met with Steve’s swift cruelty, and if they survived, they never repeated their transgressions. Steve treated him like his most valued object, no one was allowed to look or touch, only
The attention of the kids brought a few more fans over, but Steve didn't mind too much. He wasn’t as good with crowds as Tony was, but his USO tours had helped learn how to settle his nerves in front of crowds. For the most part, anyway. But the kids and teens that came up to him made it easy. At first, he used to hate stuff like this. But the more he learned to differentiate (most) civilians from scandal-hungry vultures, he began to enjoy interacting with the people of his city. It made their work as Avengers seem all the more important, the more he grew to socialize with those within his community. Something real to fight for, not just an idea. And on some days, on the
“I know you ain’t him,” Steve startles at the sudden proclamation, but before he can even open is mouth to speak - honestly clueless as to what he’d say, because it was the
Steve leans his back against the edge of the sofa, legs sprawled on the floor where they sat, side by side, on the common room floor. Trying to think of something to ask;
Tony manages a pathetic chuckle through his gasps, rasping out, “unlike me, he’s powered...and a hell of a genius…he’ll…he’ll get away.” The brunet watches Steve’s jaw twitch, faintly he thinks it was something he used to find so
He was in the middle of the desert but upon closer look, Steve realizes where ever he’d been teleported to was by a long stretch of dry road, and behind him the ground elevated indicating a kind of hill. Steve turns to face the hill and decides to climb it and see which end of the route he should hike for. The ground wasn’t very steep by any means, more like a rapid decline off the side of another level; which proved to be true once Steve pulled himself over the side of the edge, not too far ahead of him lay shrubbery likely to deter anyone from going the way he’d come up. Getting his feet on solid ground, Steve remains crouched, and sticks to the shadows as he creeps forward. It looked like a kind of backyard, though the grass had clearly seen better days, overgrown and parched of any color or life. It seemed a little dangerous, having a backyard (no matter how uncared for) right by what was basically a cliff; it was reckless, but Tony had a mansion off the side of a cliff too in Malibu, so who was he to judge?

a little from its usual slow-rest rate when watching Tony like this. He’d given up on doing that months ago. However, Steve's attention is pulled from his best friend by a gentle tug at his sleeve. Looking down, Steve sees a little girl staring up at him with tightly gripped excitement, as though she were waiting for permission to express it. He smiles as kindly as he can to try to calm the kid. Some kids were nervous when they first met him, it wasn’t anything unusual. She couldn’t have been more than 10 or 11 but stood tall and confident. Her rosy cheeks framed by beautifully wild brown ringlets that swayed around her shoulders, which only made his heart melt further when she finally smiled.
“Tony’s the best thing to have ever happened in my life, apart from our children of course, but I couldn’t imagine my life without him,” Steve turns his head just enough to whisper into Anthony’s hair, “he’s my other half.”

it’s a split-second of a thing, blink-and-you’ll-miss-it; Natasha winks at him. Her face doesn’t change, her stance still as rigid as it had been when she’d dragged Peter bloody and beaten into the office, just as cold all over, but…he’d
know who it will have to be. Tony carefully lifts his arms, slowing just enough to broadcast his intentions when Steve’s hand tightens in his hair - a warning to tread lightly - but eventually he wraps his arms around the broad shoulders of the super soldier; Steve eats it up. With one last glance to Peter, and Tony hopes to

Steve’s movements slow for a second, just long enough to dismiss Natasha and Hydra’s latest capture, for the door to his office to click closed behind them before he’s yanked onto Steve’s lap. The smaller man loses himself to Steve’s touches, fists at the man’s gold-spun hair and chokes on silent cries as Steve thrusts into him whispering his love against Tony’s skin, it’s so much,
Stepping back out onto the porch for the second time in less than 24 hours, Steve takes a deep breath and presses forward and- promptly falls flat on his face…on reinforced stainless panel flooring; on reinforced stainless panel flooring that he’s

Anthony’s hand clutches at the front of Steve’s shirt, his lips warm against the blond’s, and Steve runs his thumb along Anthony’s scruffy jaw in reassurance. It felt like hours later when Anthony’s hands no longer felt rigid against Steve’s jaw, when his trembling began to taper off to little shivers, but Steve was happy that the man finally seemed to relax a little. Steve wouldn’t lie, he felt a little saddened by the loss of Anthony’s gentle lips when they were no longer pressed against his own; however, the delicate but hopeful smile on Anthony’s face was more than worth the loss. The man searches Steve’s face, a wistful smile on his handsome - but so painfully
“This is our first night alone together!” Steve would flush at the phrasing if he wasn’t still trying to put two-and-two together in regards to the genius is reasoning. “Our first night at the Tower de mano en mano - well ‘de hombre a hombre’ if you really wanna nitpick.
“We’re married,” Anthony starts upon hearing the words, but Steve gently strokes his back until the man calms from his sputtering surprise,
The trek back was always a little tricker, making sure to take winding paths and hidden passageways to lose a tail should they have been spotted, so far Tony and his team in Florida had been lucky to go without incident, but it paid to be cautious. Casting one last glance over his shoulder, Tony felt relieved as not having to shake off - or fight off, if need be - a shadowy follower, and made his way into their underground base. Entering their makeshift home, Tony opened up his backpack and dug out the goggles, feeling a little excited to give Peter something to cheer him up - if only a little - after the events of earlier that night.
Rogers barks out a laugh, cutting Tony off, the grin he flashes Tony sends a chill down his spine, “‘serve Hydra’? Tony, my
The blond groans softly, a whine of frustrated sadness, and his brows knit together - thumb absently stroking Tony’s cheek.
“I’ll take it,” they both knew nothing in their lives was promised, that being superheroes meant risking everything to save everything else, but right here and now they had each other and that was all that mattered.
“I tell you I’ve missed you, and that’s your response?” Steve’s voice is calm, the kind of calm that terrifies a person more than the storm that is sure to follow ever could, and Tony was
“He’s cool with it!” She shouts over her shoulder, hands rifling through her sweatshirt pockets. Steve turns his attention to her friends. The girl wearing a Hawkeye shirt almost bowls over America, who lets loose a punched-out laugh.

as he wanted to be, given that they were in the living room. Though that could, hopefully, change later. Slowly ghosting his fingertips against the hem of Tony’s shirt, Steve pauses. His fingers hovering

kill me. Holy shit, Steve are you okay?” Steve could hear the tremble of amusement along with the tinge of anxiety in Tony’s coaxing voice, as though there were two parts of him at war with each other. The part that was worried he’d harmed Steve, and the other half that wanted to laugh away the situation with him.
The blond hums, gaze still locked on Tony, uncaring of the writhing teenager in his grip, “kid or no, he’s still a terrorist, Tony. Maybe I can make an example of him to deter others…like I did with Rhodey.”
. The inventor walks towards his cot and shrugs off his tank top, reaching for the worn bindings hanging from the side of his bed - calling it a ‘bed’ was generous - and wrapping it around his arc reactor, concealing the blue glow; pulling on nondescript clothing and a scarf to help better hide his face, Tony pulls the hood over his head, grabbing his backpack for the supplies and heads out of their makeshift base. Mentally making note of the items he’d need to get - a few cans of beans, new cables to power their suits, and more first-aid supplies - as he navigates his way out of the sewer system they’d taken cover in, surfacing through the mouth of a well hidden tunnel at a abandoned and shallowed swamp. Trekking through the woods towards the city, Tony didn’t dare use a flashlight lest he attract attention to himself, and walked with purpose through the well traveled path they would take to avoid detection or tails.
“At this rate, you're going to end up killing yourself, Sir. Be it of exhaustion, malnutrition or liver failure...I worry about you, Sir.”
“I hate that that’s true,” but quickly jumps to add, “I’m not a bad mom, I swear-” Steve quickly waves off her worries.
“-then I walked out of the porch and just about broke my face on the floor,” Steve finishes with a long breath, trying to steady his racing heart before looking up at where Tony stands between his legs. “Tony I-”
“What for?” Tony’s a masochist, has to be, it’s the only logical explanation as to why he questions Steve further instead of just pushing him out with a simple;
For once in his life Tony no longer feared death, instead he’d made his peace with it, and now waited for the day his existence would no longer bring harm into those he loved and cared for. Yes, he fully admits that he loves his teammates, from Wanda to Banner, and even Steve - but since Ultron he can’t blame them for not feeling the same.
after all - Anthony continues, “I don’t know if this is real or I’ve finally lost my mind to drink, but...but I know
“SHIT!” Tony yelps - but hey, it isn’t a scream - and jumps backwards, only to trip over his own clumsy feet and fall flat on his ass,
“Don’t let your ego get to you, Tony,” Steve teases playfully. Reaching for another root beer from the counter to rinse out his mouth further. “Just ask Bucky how stubborn I can be. Spoiler,
Steve looks around for something to use as a makeshift weapon but settles on snatching up one of the decorative vases Tony had in the hallway. At the very least, he could use it to distract. Moving quickly, but quietly, into the room Steve looks around and sees- no,
Tony sought kisses for comfort; for reassurance. Earlier in their friendship, the first time Steve had seen Tony peck Rhodey on the lips resulted in Peter jumping onto the fridge because Steve’s mug suddenly ‘exploded’ in his grip - Clint lost his breakfast because he’d laughed a little too hard, but Natasha and Bucky were no better.
The forty-five year old man stands, striding over to the kid and wraps his arms around Peter, holding the crying teenager until his breathing calms - no matter what Tony tried telling himself, he knew Parker was nothing if not a son to him by now. They both knew it. It was a risk, caring for someone so deeply, but they’d both already lost too much and too many people to try to deny themselves the few comforts that they still had.
tower, and brushed off any request for us to come see you after missions you would just show up to and leave right after. We thought something happened, Tony!”
Steve and Tony were having a dual mid-life crisis. Especially after the footage of Tony dancing in Time Square went viral, despite Taylor Swift having personally gotten a kick out of it. And during the hight of it all, both her and Tony decided to team up and open a charity organization to promote dancing amongst New York’s youth. Which, Steve was happy to report, was an amazing success.
Tony hadn’t known how to feel when Steve had proved, ruthlessly, that all the love between them had been
“Why do you taste like super strong whiskey?” Tony had relatively quit drinking, limiting himself to a single celebratory gland of champagne, but didn’t mind it if his husband drank - though Steve never really cared for the taste and rarely did. However, the question was valid, and one Steve was still trying to figure out how to answer - one he thought he’d have a little more
Steve didn’t understand what was happening, what Anthony was talking about, but one thing seemed to be true; Anthony Stark had his own Steve Rogers in this world, and had lost him. Steve’s heart almost felt like it was spasming in his chest, he couldn’t imagine losing Tony; Steve couldn’t imagine a life without his Iron Man, without his teammate, best friend, and—
The blond sighs softly, palm pressing against Tony’s jaw to tilt his face up, and Tony meets his sea-blue gaze, “you can’t save us Tony, not alone...you always think you’re alone in this, from the palladium poisoning to...to

and monsters, super soldiers and assassins. No, her fear stemmed from something far more illogical; love. Tony remembers thinking he must have been the Frodo to her Sam, because each time her green-eyes would silently scream
Steve decided he’d blame the shiver he felt wrack up his spine on the chilly New York night as he accepts Tony’s ride back to the compound. Their dares seemed to…spiral, from there. They decide to stay inside for the rest of the night, both agreeing that one public display was enough for the night. But that didn’t mean they weren’t above childish behaviour. Tony dares Steve to set up a trap in Clint’s room and make it look like Bucky did it. At first, Steve was hesitant. The last time someone pranked Clint, it incited the Prank Wars of 2013. But when Tony sighed and said,

Tony wants to say he has more dignity than to scramble to his feet at Steve’s command, but he doesn’t, because pride in a world like this gets you killed. Instead, Tony follows behind Steve into a bedroom,
“Don’t cry, pet,” Steve coos, leaning forward to press a tender kiss just under Tony’s eye, over the damp trail of a…a tear? When had he begun crying? “You’ll be good for me, won’t you?”
he thinks with a chuckle as they all introduce themselves. There’s a pair of twins and another blond boy who looked the most nervous amongst them. Though the excitement of his friends and Steve's open demeanour seems to be calming his nerves the more they chatted and took photos.
“IT’S IRON MAN!” Steve’s enhanced hearing catches the words from the distance, over the wind that chills his skin and looking around he realizes they’d arrived at Time Square just as Tony began to slow to a hover. Once low enough, but higher than most people could handle, Steve hops onto the grimy New York concrete and smiles up at his friend in thanks.
Tony felt…hollow, somehow, when Steve wasn’t at his side. Always told by others he lit up like a Christmas tree when Steve would call or text him, and Tony couldn’t even deny it, because he
well how stubborn your All American Ass can be, Rogers,” Tony scoffs with a roll of his eyes. Though, his attempted exasperation is undercut by the grin tugging at the corner of his lips. “So it’s your turn. What does Captain America have up his sleeve?”
“I wasn’t always, don’t get me wrong,” Steve starts, eyes focused on his task, and Tony almost felt comforted by the familiar feeling of it all; of Steve between his legs, of his husband’s hands on him and his gentle voice surrounding him - it made Tony forget, for a moment. “After waking up from the ice, to a world that…that never actually

It’s almost like an out of body experience, the way things suddenly shifted; the way his body jolted to
It was phrased as a question, even though they both knew the answer. Though Steve’s silence had been confirmation enough to the genius.

Steve stops, eyes screwing shut as his hands clutch onto the edge of the kitchen counter, ducking his head in between his arms as he breathes hard, and Tony is about to speak when Steve beats him to it.
The moan escapes Tony before he can even think to stop it, the feeling of Steve’s hot tongue against this skin and heavy hands on his waist making him tremble,
“Well bless your mother, Captain, she raised a hell of a man,” Elena says with a kind smile, before beginning to wrangle the kids in the other direction. While the two mothers bustled the group of excited kids away, Steve felt a tap on his shoulder.
“You think I’m lying?” Steve, clearly affronted, takes a step closer to the brunet and Tony fights the urge to shove him away like a petulant child.
difference was the far wall, where in their room had been the Avengers’ recognizable ‘A’ symbol, was now a prominent Hydra insignia - it was a perfect replica of the bedroom Steve and Tony had shared for years, but bastardized to this new world.
The words should comfort him, should offer some reprieve from the constricting pain he’s begun to believe to be chronic around his heart as of late, but instead each syllable hits him like a punch to the gut. The sadness in Pepper’s eyes gut him, if only because he knows he’s the reason for it. He wonders if it would be melodramatic to say they were doomed from the start, because Pepper would have moved heaven and earth to protect Tony after Afghanistan, but the only time he felt true safety after being torn apart and put back together was in his suits - Tony never really knows when to just shut up, but this time he remains silent about his thoughts. However, the sad - or pathetically ironic - part of it all, was that Pepper had left Tony

“Like I said,” Steve puffs out his chest little in an over-the-top display of arrogance, but feels his neck flush a little when he notices Tony’s eyes wander down his chest.
Shoving his middle finger into his mouth Tony stands, stomach twisting within him as it groans and convulses with wordless pleas of hunger, and like the functional adult Tony admits to be he heads to the kitchenette in his work shop, cracking open a bottle of Maker’s Mark - and just because he’s classy, drinks right from the bottle. He feels his suits watch him in disapproval.
Tony seemed amazing, but he knew why Tony was asking him to share; secrets never weighed well on Steve’s conscious, and so, he told him. Everything. Tony just about clings to his husband, but Steve doesn’t mind because he holds onto Tony just as tightly. However, Steve knew Tony’s sniffs and hiccups about his short time with Anthony was overshadowed by the prospect of facing what Anthony had; losing Steve. He knew, because if the roles had been reversed, Steve would have been a far worse sobbing mess.
Tony’s heart stutters at the soldier’s words because this was it, this was his moment to save Peter’s life, or lose another person he loved with his entire being. Swallowing thickly Tony chooses action rather than words, crawling forward towards the blond, he reaches a tentative - trembling - hand to grasp onto Steve’s black and red uniform - a bastardized version of his former one that broke Tony’s heart to see. The Captain kneels before Tony, accepting his silent beckoning, a gloved hand reaches out and the brunet shivers as he feels it run through his hair, gasping softly when Steve grabs it in a fist and pulls Tony’s head back to look at him. Stark knows Peter is watching, knows that what was left of the Avengers would all rather die fighting than give in, but they both knew - deep down, it was an unspoken fact they just
“Big talk for a little guy, Tones. Let's see if your bite’s as bad as your bark,” Steve goads before spinning the bottle. But despite his calm outward demeanour, every inch of his being was hoping for the bottle to land on Tony.
“Of course, Anthony,” Steve replies and kisses the top the man’s forehead, moving around just enough to pull the slightly itchy duvet out from under him and toss it over their legs.
Steve didn’t hesitate to kiss Tony back to the moment the smaller man leaned forward, but he knew he had some explaining to do when Tony stilled, and then pulled away with a confused expression.

“You’re insufferable,” Steve harrumphs, but has a smile on his lips as he presses another, deeper, kiss to Tony’s kiss-reddened lips.
“Just enjoying my time off before I gotta put the suit back on be Iron Man, Pep, it’s not a big dea-”
It’s somewhere between the end of his second bottle of Maker’s Mark and the beginning of the third that he hears his phone ring, he knows he shouldn’t answer, not in his state, but his resolve dies when he sees Pepper’s face flash across the screen. Tony picks up his Stark-Phone
in his face. But Steve just couldn’t bring himself to believe any of those things, not with the way Tony watches him. Silence takes over the room, but still, Steve couldn’t bring himself to panic. If only because Tony didn't. There wasn’t even a moment of surprise in his expression. Not like he’d seen this coming, but more like…Tony had been
The Captain thought he’d feel some kind of panic roiling in his gut at the admission. That fear would strike him down, hard with the belief Tony would flee. Reject him. Or flat out
Tony goes without another word. However, through all his actions he feels a knot of anxiety building up within him, coiling tight and heavy within himself; a damn Gordian Knot he can’t find the end to no matter how hard he tries. Tony’s hands shake as they scrub the shampoo into his scalp, and he knows it’s pathetic, knows that he has to be stronger than this but he just can’t keep it together anymore; can’t live knowing he’s nothing but a burden to those around him no matter what he does. You’d think being a genius would mean you had the answers to everything, but Tony just can’t seem to figure out a way to prove that

“It’s okay,” Anthony says with a shudder, taking half a step back, “y’er here now, y’er back an’ it’s…it’s okay now,” Steve immediately feels torn, he knows he won’t be here for long if Tony has any say in it, but Anthony thinks

The - then - twenty-five year old had become a household name within the year of his rise, and at twenty-six Steve had let slip that he was in a relationship with (in)famous Tony Stark, the unforgivingly self-proclaimed genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist; the media had lost their

Tony’s gaze snaps back to Steve’s just as quickly as they had cast themselves away towards Peter and Natasha, he surges forward, kissing the blond - he feels Steve’s defenses fall by the wayside; the Captain hadn’t expected this,
Tony wished he was a stronger man, but unlike the super soldier above him, Tony was only human; he couldn’t stop himself from passing out from the pain, no matter how hard he tried, but for once he was thankful for the embrace of oblivion.
Rogers chuckles as he moves down to crouch in front of Tony, elbows resting on muscled thighs without so much as wavering in his balance, reaching out a bare hand and isn’t deterred when Tony flinches away from it. Tony feels the callouses caress his scruffy jaw, swallowing thickly when Steve hums in thought.
Tony moves like a shot, sitting up ramrod straight in his four-poster bed, skin sweltering with a sheen of sweat and kicks off the covers that cling to him; the man shivers and cringes at the taste in his mouth. Tony hates this, fuck that, he was

No one knew the real Steve Rogers, they were all too caught up in the veneer, bewitched by his charming smile and kind platitudes; all under the spell of the carefully cultivated personality that he presented to the world.

Now ‘Steve Rogers’ was a name that was known all across the world, a musician that preformed to stadiums of thousands, with the lyrics and voice that stole the hearts of everyone in his presence - he was America’s Ed Sheeran, every tabloid’s favorite sweetheart, though the man would bashfully deny the compliments.

worried he wouldn’t get away with the prank. Clint was a master spy, after all. But Tony didn’t need to know that. Steve decided to retaliate in-kind, feeling petty and dares Tony to go into Thor’s room and pet the Bilgesnipe in there. Steve had expected Tony to call him crazy and switch to truth. Which was the goal, but leave it to Tony to leave Steve floundering in surprise. Because after a moment's consideration Tony shrugs, gets up, and starts for the elevator. Steve moves to follow, but before he could even
days, knowing that made all the difference. Eventually, both of America’s mothers bustled over, clearly having been looking for their daughter and her friends in a panic, but calmed when they realized who the little gang had run off to meet.
was always lingering just beneath the surface, waiting for his moment to show his true colors, and Tony…Tony had been
from where Anthony’s tucked his face into the crook of his neck, but this time doesn’t feel it’s out of sadness - or maybe not
“How do you plan to get back to y’er fella?” Anthony asks through a yawn, his eyes no longer even open,
Anthony shifts in Steve’s arms, and the blond knows what’s coming before he feels the smaller man’s slightly chapped lips press against his own, and Steve does the one thing he can do; he kisses Anthony back. A part of Steve felt guilty for it, knowing that this man wasn’t really
“You were always perfect like this,” Steve releases Peter - who slumps forward like a puppet with their strings cut - to run his other hand along Tony’s unkempt beard, eyes never leaving the brunet’s face as he speaks, “on your knees for me, so perfect.
Tony and Steve's "first kiss" may be more than just a kiss... Just a bit more... Like, microscopically more...
Still other days, it meant Steve taking care of Tony, at times wrangling him as one would a toddler, reminders to eat please Tony, sleep please Tony, don't combine explosive materials in potentially explosive ways please Tony.
"Not literally, just the general feeling of the thing, you know? I understood where you are at with everything and I respect it." Tony looked away before saying this next bit. "And I'm sorry if I pushed it. At all. Not the intention, I swear."
And just like that, Steve's brain turned off, all lights out, just to flip on again straight into overdrive.
"I think we've got some talking to do in the meantime, some misconceptions we need to iron out, mostly relating to your apparent lack of functional understanding of how
Interesting. He'd never thought himself to be that kind of person but, damn, if that thought didn't make him ache, his pulse stronger in his cock than anywhere else in his body at the moment.
Add onto that the fact Tony looks directly at him right when he feels the heat reach it's climax, he's not sure he'll ever recover.
Sharing just enough intimate space, while being complimented for something he's usually decently insecure about (because he's constantly surrounded by the biggest minds in science and technology, as well as THE spies), his usual blush doesn't quite cut it.
Fortunately, that did a lot for Tony. Hearing Steve struggle to control himself, usually the paragon of self control, face flushed with effort, a rare sight, hair tousled from Tony's fingers gripping it (and hey, when had he done that?) and suddenly he wasn't all that far off from where Steve was, damn near exactly where he wanted to be.
Pepper was stuck in board meetings all day. Tony had begged out of them due to an (admittedly legitimate) splitting headache (after a bad dive in the Iron Man armor the day before out on a mission).
Steve's breath puffed out sharply against his ear at that and the resulting shiver up Tony's spine was a nice confirmation that neither of them actually wanted to stop.
Steve broke off at that, unable to put into words what he was feeling. Shaking his head and looking away, he finished with a simple but insufficient "I'm so sorry, Tony."
Mind going blank for a moment, Tony gasped, unable to contain his shock. Steve, ever the strategist, took the opportunity and moved in. Somehow it turned quickly from Tony kissing Steve into Steve kissing Tony.
Tony tightens his fingers in Cap's hair (you know, Cap, Captain America, who he's freaking making out with now) and dives in to meet the new found enthusiasm. One well placed nibble on Steve's lower lip and there it is. The most delectable sound Tony thinks he's probably ever heard: Steve groaning, slightly muffled by Tony's own lips.
Probably at least a little bit of experience with women, kissing at the bare minimum. Anything beyond that...
"Oh. OH! Ohhhh, you don't- I mean, I figured- but then I guess you wouldn't with the whole... Oh no."
Foregoing any verbal answer, Tony rolled his hips against Steve's thigh where it had fitted between his legs again. He was hard, the movement making his breath catch.
Several more rolls of his hips, dragging his cock up and down along Steve's palm, combined with the bite mark Steve gave him as his teeth clamped down on Tony's neck had him twitching, hips juddering as his release punched him square in the gut and left his vision fuzzy.
After a moment of silence, Steve looked back. Tony had frozen, mouth open like he was shocked by the whole thing.
Rutting against each other, chests heaving, Steve worked his teeth and lips and tongue down Tony's neck, biting, sucking, and laving at the marks he left behind.
"And not fair to the other person I'm interested in, either." His lips quirked into a smile. "Who I now have on good authority, has feelings for me."
Steve kept up the movements of their hips, speeding up, only to falter a moment before spreading back down. Tony was going crazy, he needed more than this amount of stimulation, he wasn't in his twenties anymore.
Instead, he's reaching one hand out to rest on Steve's hip bone and the other to rest on the back of Steve's neck.
"Is Pepper still here?" Tony asked, emerging from the lab for the first time in Steve doesn't know how many days.
This doesn't really relate to the first chapter much other than it's the yummy kiss scene. But really it's just a general yummy kiss scene. Also, my first, so be gentle :)
"What- but is that- does that mean...?" Steve lets the question fade, but it's okay because Tony is already in the process of answering. Just not verbally.
Thank you so much for reading! Hope it wasn't too difficult to make it to the end. Kudos, comments, and constructive criticism is encouraged and always welcome! Let me know if you think I can wring any more out of this admittedly thin concept lol
Shaking his head, a smirk lighting up his expression, but still maintaining that intensity that's making Tony's heart race, Steve's answer, whispered low, right in his ear, damn near makes Tony's knees buckle.
"...but now I don't have to. Looks like we're both off the hook, Cap." Tony continued, like he wasn't sure how to go about conversing at the moment.
With the Avengers, Tony already had a different call than whatever call Steve made. Media presence Tony always got to take the lead on but he never followed through with the strategy agreed upon in planning. Upgrades, remodels, clean up, hell, even dinner was a point of constant dispute between the two.
"Listen, Tony, about that say, you know, what happened with us, I was, or, I guess it was just a bit, um, we-"
His right hand stayed where it was, but his fingers, unaccustomed to being stationary, found Steve's hair. Just long enough for fingers to rake through, just long enough to get a decent hold. Nothing too solid, but enough to test his new partner.
As Tony stammered, consequently making Steve feel less like the idiot he thought he had been moments before, he moved in closer, gesturing to this and that, between himself and Steve, the door Pepper had gone through, the lab, Steve wasn't quite sure.
"Come on, Steve, uhhh," he broke off on a groan. "What're you waiting for?" His voice was more pleading than he had meant it, having aimed for teasing.
He's sure Tony can feel the added heat coming off his whole body. Granted, it's always been a well known fact, Cap runs hot.
Tony is intimately acquainted with people valuing you for only one thing, and what that does to your sense of self worth. He definitely doesn't want anyone else to deal with that.
But all of it related to other people. Somehow, if the two could just spend the afternoon holed up in Tony's lab, training together, either in the facilities Tony had put into his building or at SHIELD, or the one particularly memorable day they spent looking through old things of Howard and Peggy's, they got on just swimmingly.
Once his brain came back online, there was all kinds of new information he needed to process. Namely, Steve's hands. They'd been at his sides when they started. Somehow they had moved under Tony's arms so his hands were on Tony's back, resting lightly just above and just below his shoulder blades.
"Um- yes? I think she was just getting ready to leave though." Steve gestures behind him at the door Pepper had just disappeared through. "I'm sure I can catch her. Do you want-"
Steve let a hand sneak under Tony's shirt, fingers digging into where love handles would be, thumbs grazing hip bones, heat spreading from any and all points of contact.
Partially because it's true and he feels like someone needs to remind Steve that he has more than just his muscles.
Okay, he needed to get a handle on this quick, or at least get a read on Steve, see where he's thinking of taking this, if this is all he's planning or if he's got something more in mind, see if-
Then it was entirely another thing when they were not strictly alone. Any time other people were involved, they butted heads something fierce.
No sooner had the thought crossed his mind than he felt something warm and wet flutter against his upper lip. Holy shit...
And, wow, did that sound suggestive or was Steve imagining it? He's never been good at reading these kinds of things.
"Oh, shit, Tony," Steve forced out between breaths, "Tony, I can't, ah, last much longer, mmm, wanted to show you-" that seemed to be the end of his composure.  His eyes fluttered between half-lidded, pupils blown wide with his arousal, and tight shut, as though he could block some of it out by not seeing Tony.
Some days that means he's way more keyed up than he needs to be. Other days, when Steve is maybe feeling a bit more lost, more set adrift by this or that, it becomes a grounding point in Steve's mind. Something familiar and steady, something he could rely on to bring him back to himself.
It was Steve's turn to look confused. Had he entirely misread the situation? Had he made the whole thing up in his head like some crazy wishful thinking? And now in trying to fix it, made it into the very thing he was trying to fix?
"Oh, no, definitely not." Tony cut him off, shaking his head furiously. "I was trying to come up with a better excuse than having you tell her I died."
Now normally Tony would be a bit offended by the fact his best friend had just told him to shut up. Mid make out however, he feels it's justified.
And, yeah. That does the trick. Whatever gear that had started going in overdrive was effectively disconnected. Just taken right out of the machine that made up his mind.
Tony doesn't remember being so turned on by such innocent actions before. Tony clutched at Steve's shirt, realizing they were both fully clothed still. Steve's hands had come to grip Tony's hips, controlling his movements just enough that Tony knew any move he made was because Steve was allowing it.
Plus, the thought of being solely responsible for the sexual education of Captain America made all his bits tingly, from head to toe.
"Wow. Okay, first, I don't know where you get that I have standards but, trust me, if I did, you meet and well exceed any and all possible standards anyone could imagine. Like, ever. And second, give me like, a couple hours? I'm sure you'll be ready and raring to go in like, ten minutes but we're not all as lucky as you mister 'pinnacle of human perfection.' So if you want, we can just hang out here, get some fresh clothes and maybe some refreshments, before we try for round two?"
