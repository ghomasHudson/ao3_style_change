For once Steve was thankful that he was missing something. There was obviously more to the reference than the obvious given the smirk on Tony's face, but he had no idea what the man was getting at. He settled for an uncertain shake of his head and ventured carefully, "I just think you got some of the best parts of him." It wasn't a new thing for Tony to take advantage of the fact that he'd missed more than a little slang and even more cultural references during his long entombment. One of the reasons Steve found it so difficult to be at ease around him was a feeling of constantly walking on eggshells trying not to say anything too painfully stupid, to not expose his ignorance. Of all the Avengers Tony tended to be the hardest to convince that he had worth as a leader - and how was he supposed to be a good leader when sometimes he felt like he didn't even know how to be a person in the strange, new world?
Logan nodded silently, his face unreadable as he left the cup of coffee, untouched, on the counter and went to sit in the kitchen chair next to Scott, facing the man fully. "I don't freak out," he countered, leaning in, his hand on one of Scott's knees as he gave him a defiant stare, more akin to the glares he'd shot the younger man when they'd first met. He was well within Scott's personal space. It was a test, in a way. He wanted to see if Scott still had the nerve he'd had when drunk. His gaze bored into blue eyes as if to say 'your move.'
Coulson shook his head at once. "It's not worth losing you in the process. Not even close to worth it."
"Yeah... Fair enough." A good romp would probably help clear his head. It sure beat the hell out of sitting around, staring at a wall. "Catch ya later."
The touch was enough to make him feel like he couldn't breathe. The words, husky and hot and absolutely perfect, made Phil moan in a way that was a lot needier than he would have liked. The hands that had been pushing eagerly under Clint's shirt froze for a moment while he tried to get himself under control. He shook it off and recovered again a beat later. "Glad to hear you approve," he managed, fingers running across Clint's muscled back. He gave up on that a to cup Clint through his too-tight jeans with a sigh of pleasure. "Not doing too bad yourself."
Hank, ever difficult to offend, laughed heartily. "I am Henry McCoy. You can call me Hank. Or Beast," he said, offering a hand.
Logan grinned, offering Sif a slight bow. It felt silly and appropriate all at once. "Lady Sif, I think Natasha was going to show you to your room. Or some dinner if you'd rather. Jarvis can tell you where to find her," he said, closing in on Scott as he spoke. He didn't really give two shits about what Sif might think as he took the man's hand. "We should get some drinks tomorrow night, though. You 'n' Thor both."
"I'm going to be the jerk who answers a question with a question for a second. Great sex is always a good start, but if you put that aside," and that was hard to do when he could still taste Clint on his tongue, "then can you really see me as someone you'd want to be with? I'm older. I'm admittedly less exciting than Natasha on a lot of levels. Even if you want to move on, is there any chance I'd be the one to do it with?"
"Mm... I like the way you think. We can save slow for the whole pickin' out drapes together part. I kind think some other things need to happen on the faster scale."
Clint raised an eyebrow at the other man. "Considering I got body-jacked and you got killed, I'd have to say that getting a root canal is more fun than saving the world, so I'm not sure if that was a compliment," he teased, then wiggled his shoulders as if trying to burrow a little deeper into Phil's chest. "But I'll admit that there's not a lot that could make me move right now. Except maybe the opportunity to finally knock off a certain irritating out-of-towner," he said, careful to redact his real meaning. Not wanting the conversation to turn too serious, Clint tilted his head at Phil. "So, what kind of greasy festival food are we having? I'm pretty sure I'd be down for a funnel cake unless you had something more unhealthy in mind."
Scott had torn off the blindfold and was checking Logan over even though Natasha had already determined he was alive. "Jesus, what-"
Steve shook his head firmly. "Watching over you is our first priority. Whatever Bucky's part in this is... if someone's after you, we have to make sure they don't get anywhere near you." Before Tony could protest, he added quietly, "I'll talk to Director Fury. He can bring in Clint and Natasha. If anyone can find out what's going on, it's them. I'm staying with you." He knew that Fury would have been happy to assign someone else to watch over Tony and nurse him through his recovery, to be his bodyguard for the duration of the healing, but Steve couldn't stand the idea of anyone else doing it. Somehow Bucky was responsible for what had happened to Tony, which meant that he was too. "Get some sleep. I'll be right here."
It felt good to relax. Tony had been on edge and well on his way to becoming a reclusive drunk. Now it was as if he could take on the whole world again. His gaze ticked between the action on screen and Steve's reaction. Tony ached to be close to the other man, and before he realized what had happened, he'd inched closer and tentatively draped his arm across Steve's broad shoulders. "Is this all right?" he asked softly. Despite his renewed confidence, Tony was still a little unsure, and he didn't want to make a wrong move after Steve had been so patient and understanding with him.
Positive that he'd somehow managed to walk from the bar into the pages of a freaky leather magazine, Darien was dazed by the expert way Clint trussed him up. His partner had done this before. Clint had dragged people into the seedy back room and fucked them there more than once. It was terrifying and sexy all at once, and Darien tried to catch his breath. "Wh-what, uh, what exactly is the plan here?" he managed in a voice that didn't sound any steadier than he felt. At least staying on his feet wasn't a concern since he was bound and tied off kneeling. His gaze strayed from Clint to the two other men, who were smirking at him. They apparently knew what was coming, and his stomach twisted with a heady mix of fear and excitement.
"I'm sure Captain Rogers understands that feeling well." Coulson returned the smile. "I also imagine there are benefits to not knowing, but you and I both know that none of us are going to be safe until we know what Hydra has planned. Right now you're our best link to that." He hated pushing too hard, but they needed the secrets locked in the man's head and to know that he wasn't a threat.
"Few days," Tony answered. "I mean, it's just a flesh wound, right? Mild internal injuries at best. So, probably tomorrow I'll be fine." //If I'm not, they can just sew me back up, because I'm not waiting anymore.// The billionaire leaned up, nibbling at Steve's ear as his hand drifted low over the blonde's abs. "Seem a little restless," he said, his hand stopping right at the waistband of Steve's briefs. "Hard time waiting it out?"
"We'll give them a look tomorrow afternoon if all goes well," Jemma agreed, "but I've had Jarvis keeping an eye out for me. It looks good. The arrhythmia is almost gone, and his breathing is more or less normal. He's putting on weight, a bit of height..." She beamed a smile again. "It's working. Thanks to you. It's fantastic to have some truly, honestly good news."
"Real thing is definitely better," Clint decided, letting himself practically melt against Phil's form once again. It felt amazing to be against his handler, to feel so safe. Clint was quiet for a moment before something occurred to him. "Hey, you remember that op where we got forced to hide together in the broom closet? Where it was so close we could barely close the door?" He turned his head to look at Phil and smiled slowly, a wicked spark in his eye. "And I was complaining about your sidearm poking me... but it wasn't your sidearm, was it?"
Logan snapped at the bartender in Japanese, and the man hurriedly moved away. "You've had enough, Stark. Enjoy some water," he said as the prescribed solution was put in front of Tony. "If I had a brother, he'd've come lookin' for me by now, don'tcha think?" When Tony grinned, shook his head and opened his mouth to answer, Logan held up a hand to silence him. "You're gonna piss me off if you keep talkin', and I'd hate to have to force-feed you a knuckle sandwich in front o' all these nice folks in here."
Steve winced. He felt guilty at the very mention of it. "No. The last time I saw him... the last time I saw him, Logan wasn't himself. At all. I know it's awful to say it, but it's hard to see him like that." As for Summers, he'd been rather sure that the man didn't feel like talking to people who knew what had happened, but Steve knew that might be an unfair assumption. "I'll check on them after we eat. If anything's changed, I'll let you know."
Politely disregarding the more awkward parts of the conversation, Bruce held up a tablet for display. "Still getting a good energy profile on it. It's kind of hard to do."
"A bar," Clint replied without elaborating. He lead the way to the garage and hopped onto his motorcycle, gesturing for Darien to get on the back. He knew it was probably a little mean considering the abuse Darien's rear had just been through, but it was the only wheels Clint had, and the archer wasn't really concerned with Darien's comfort anyway.
"Let's put that on the 'not to do' list as a general rule if you don't mind," Steve answered. He glanced back to the bar and saw Logan nursing a fresh beer. It wasn't like they had to worry about the man getting drunk, but he still looked pretty disgruntled. Deciding he needed to stop focusing on the negative and start focusing on the positive, Steve offered his dance partner a warm smile. "You're good at this. Sorry I'm not. This is definitely a different style for me." For a moment Steve had to tamp down the impulse to wipe the smirk off of Tony's face with a kiss. That he could definitely do, but Steve forced himself to think of why that might not be the best idea.
Coulson led the charge to the kitchen and started a pot of coffee before he observed, “They could find someone else. I could hand him over to a junior agent and be done with it, but Captain Rogers asked me to look after him, and honestly I think a friendly face will do more good right now.” He could see the lines of tension in Clint’s shoulders and the set of his jaw. “Besides, how much trouble can I get in when you’re watching over me?” Coulson gathered up two mugs, some creamer, and a pot of sugar. “Speaking of which, you don’t actually have to do that. It’s... “ He searched for the right words to convey how he felt and finally admitted, “It’s comforting, actually, but you don’t have to do it.”
//Phil?// The guy looked somewhere between badass and someone who should be trading comic books in his mom's basement. All the same, Logan shook hands. "You can drop the 'mister' part, Coulson. I ain't much for titles."
"Good." Phil looked very obviously pleased to have the matter settled enough for the two of them. "No problems there." It was surprisingly easy negotiating the first few issues that might crop up. Clint was willing to be monogamous, neither of them had a problem going public, and Clint wasn't leaving for the night. "I figured I'd have a good time tonight. I feel like a third wheel sometimes, but it's still always fun going out with the team. I just didn't think... this isn't something I really ever thought was a possibility."
Phil's stomach turned at the sight of the blood and the look of pain on Clint's face. He would have done anything in that moment to make sure that he could protect Clint. Unfortunately the impulse played directly into Creed's hand, but there wasn't much he could do about it. Protecting Clint was instinct. //I think I see why he and Loki get along so well.// Phil wondered how different things might have been if Erik Lehnsherr was present and accounted for, if he would have been able to rein his people in and keep some sort of order amidst the chaos. Instead of addressing Creed at all, he switched his focus to Clint. "We're gonna be fine. You and I both know Natasha's not going to leave this alone."
Clint settled in the bed next to her, propping his elbow on the pillow to look at her, his hand running down her arm. "I know," he admitted. He kissed her forehead. "Thank you." He felt suddenly guilty. He hadn't demanded it, but he still felt like he'd somehow asked far more of her than was fair. "I..." He bit the words back. Don't be stupid. He knew she wouldn't or maybe even couldn't reciprocate, and it was unfair of him to put her in the spot. He grabbed her hand and kissed it, then held his arm out for her to cuddle closer. "C'mere."
"And humble, too," Clint remarked, though he had to smirk a little at the other man's confidence. And why the hell not? Phil might've been a suit, but he was sure as hell a good looking one. "But I guess the cellists dig that sort of manly asshole bravado, huh?" He hadn't stopped to think that Phil hadn't mentioned said musician in a long while.
Clint was buzzed, but not nearly buzzed enough to pretend he wasn’t aware of everything he was doing. It was a bit late to play coy or pretend that it was still part of the joke. He'd done his best to fluster Coulson, and that hadn't worked, but he'd stayed pressed against the guy well after it was obviously not working. Coulson hadn't pushed him away, either. It occurred to Clint that while Nat had been his original target, blowing off steam with his handler might not be such a bad idea, either. "Well," he murmured, leaning in close to Phil, pulling them tight together and slowing his movement to a graceful sway as the music's tempo dropped, "I was kind of curious." He shifted his hips against Phil's, the slight change in angles sending a thrill through him. "And now I'm thinking I wasn't imagining things when I saw you in your PJs the other night..." He lowered his voice and leaned in to rasp into Coulson's ear, "and I might be feeling a little left out after hearing about you and Nat."
"F-fuck," was all Tony managed, clutching helplessly at Steve as the man's teeth and tongue drove him nearly insane. It felt perfect. It was just what he'd needed. Tony finally convinced his fingers to let go of their death grip on Steve's bicep, trailing his fingers up to the back of Steve's neck. He managed to raise one leg up, hooking it over Steve's hip and pressing their aching cocks together in the most perfect way. Tony gasped, his head falling back against the tiles. "God, yes. Need you, baby. Love you..."
Meanwhile Steve had pulled Tony close, touching as lightly as he could manage while encased in the bulky metal. He couldn't help the tears, mission be damned, because Tony was there. He was real. He was alive. "I... God, Tony, I... love you," was all Steve managed before he kissed the other man gently.
For all his impatience, even Logan could take a minute to enjoy the view the two were presenting. Both men were incredibly fit, looked absolutely perfect together. The eerie glow of the arc reactor only served to highlight the perfect curves of muscles, the beads of sweat clinging to their skin. Logan found himself moving closer to them again. He stretched out beside Tony, fingertips tracing the outline of one pec before he reached lower to begin stroking the man's cock, drawing a low moan of pleasure from him.
Fury shook his head in immediate negation. "He's also here for more than just babysitting the Avengers. No."
“Triggers?” Steve’s brow furrowed, then he caught sight of the bruises just above Coulson’s collar, and his eyes went slightly wide. “Are you-”
Jarvis' voice cut through the gentle attempts at conversation. "Captain Rogers, your presence is requested in the lab when you feel ready."
Tony was momentarily overwhelmed with the two struggles he was so firmly planted between. Figuring Bruce could cope with his current problem, Tony focused on the blue chick tangled around Steve. "Okay, you're gonna have to get out of my kool-aid, hon," he admonished, trying to aim in a way that'd only strike the python-esque mutant woman. Realizing that wasn't going to work, he dropped his hand. //I'm gonna hate myself for this, sooner or later. The two were too low to the ground for Tony to aid Steve with a flyby, and that left one option.// The armored superhero threw himself into the tangle, trying - unsuccessfully - to catch Mystique by the throat, the hair... anything. Armored up, he didn't have the agility to fight the woman. "Jarvis, ditch the suit."
Loki laughed out loud. "You might be surprised," he deadpanned before looking to Creed. "I'm afraid I did promise to return her in mostly good condition. I just need her friends to miss her... and perhaps to find a thing or two in her mental filing cabinet."
"I sincerely doubt it," Loki answered with the faintest trace of a smile on his lips, "but I'm afraid I'm going to ask something of you anyway. Well, not ask so much as inform you of a change in plans." He waited until Victor seemed properly focused before informing him, "We're releasing them. The captives. SHIELD may not come for Stark, but they'll come for those two. I'd rather they be left somewhere to die of exposure quietly and without our involvement before that time comes. Take the transport device and leave them somewhere. I honestly don't care where, just see that it's done before the night is out. We're tempting fate as it is."
"Can do." Scott looked over Coulson's shoulder to offer Logan a smile and an arched eyebrow. "I'm feeling pretty popular right about now."
"Like you two knowing Nat seemed a little better." Steve was still relieved at the idea that she might at least not be actively suffering as badly.
The intonation was a familiar one, and Tony gasped as Loki's hips slammed home once again, his toes curling as he felt his peak nearing. His fingers dug into the god's back, blunt fingernails raking over his skin. Short, choked gasps escaped him, a few of which sounded like Steve's name. With a low cry, Tony finally came undone, his body arching up into Loki's as he spilled himself between them. It was perfect.
Clint tensed at the sight of it. It made him itch to take the weapon, but fear held him back more than the cuffs.
“Steve Rogers.” Reaching out, Steve closed his hand around Tony’s and couldn’t help grinning right back. Messy as their first meeting had been, he wouldn’t really have scrubbed it for anything. Both of them had walked in with preconceptions about each other. Without the animosity, they might never have broken those assumptions down. “I’m glad I thawed out soon enough to get a chance to meet you.”
Victor was already drawing away and searching for his discarded clothing. "What? No 'thank you'?" he said, grinning and chuckling. It had been a good fuck, no doubt. Surreal, almost intimidating, but definitely good. Victor pulled on his pants but didn't bother with anything else. He headed to the door, the rest of his clothes bundled in one arm. He paused by the door and glanced back at Loki. "Lemme know if you need some more o' this," he said, tossing the god a confident grin before disappearing out the door.
"Of course," Coulson agreed readily. He took the cuffs and put them on himself. He hated that they had to use them at all, but at the very least he wanted to be in charge of the situation. Smiling sadly at Clint, he checked to make sure the cuffs weren't too tight before leading the archer to the cell block.
The landing jostled him from a light sleep, and Phil tensed for a fight before he remembered where they were. He got a nod of greeting from Ward as his eyes opened, and Phil gave Clint's leg a gentle shake. "Hey. Time to get to the doctor," he informed the man in a voice rough from sleep and lingering dehydration. The sooner they got the medical part of things done, the sooner they could curl up somewhere and sleep.
They had some things to work through. Clint did especially with years of being madly in love with someone who simply couldn't feel the same way. Phil understood. "Well, that's a bad habit, then. We'll have to change that. You should be hearing it at least daily." Though he wasn't by any means angry with Natasha for the way things had gone - Phil understood well enough that she had her own issues, plenty of them - he couldn't help but feel awful that for so many years, Clint had gone without the attention he really deserved. He'd been taking what he could get. He shouldn't have to wait for what was left over.  Phil kept the introspection to himself and simply stroked his fingers through Clint's hair and over his back, soothing and maintaining gentle contact at all times. "I'll make a note on my calendar."
Clint rumbled, nuzzling Nat's throat as he focused on his breathing and keeping his pace slow and deliberate. He wanted to fuck the woman with wild abandon, but he wanted the session to last even more. Either way, he wasn't going to do anything Nat hadn't given permission for. Drawing away from her throat, he pressed another kiss to the woman's lips, the contact hot and purely sexual at first. Without thinking about it, Clint eased up after a moment, and the kiss became almost tender before he remembered his place in their relationship. As if the tender contact hadn't happened, he pulled back and lightly tugged at Nat's full lower lip, bright blue eyes locked with hers. His lips parted with arousal even as hooded, intense eyes watched his lover, relishing the look of her so obviously turned on.
Scott swallowed hard. He didn't want to believe that because it would also mean the safest thing would be to get away from his lover. "We're a fucking mess. Let's just... let's do this." If he let himself get lost in Logan's embrace, Scott wasn't sure his willpower would hold out. He shakily rise from the bed and stumbled into the bathroom to get at least vaguely clean.
"See, now you're putting me in the position of telling you no because it's the right thing to do. You're evil," Steve pointed out, visibly disgruntled as they tangled together. "You're lucky I apparently have a thing for evil. Yes, you should go and do lab things and make science and not kill Fitz-Simmons because I think Phil wouldn't appreciate that." He kissed Tony's shoulder, "But can you maybe do it in five minutes or something? I want a few minutes to cuddle you before you go shower."
"Finders keepers." Clint met Loki's gaze, jaw clenched, much like his gut. He still remembered the last time he'd confronted the god. "The only thing I owe you is a slow, painful death," the archer growled. Subconsciously, he placed himself between Coulson and Loki as he drew down on the god. "You've fucked with me, my friends, my allies... If you think you're getting off this planet intact, you've got another thought coming." He smirked. "And, if I don't do the trick, don't forget... we have a Hulk."
Tony nodded absently. "You ever wonder if there's a real serpent of Midgard? Because that sounds pretty damn terrifying."
Tony grinned broadly, pushing himself up to follow Steve into the bathroom. The second the water was warm enough, he pulled Steve under the spray and lathered him up and rinsed him off. After they got in bed, though, Tony slowed down, tugging Steve close to him and letting his hands roam over the blonde's lean body. "Feel better?" he asked.
Clint followed, but only after he took a few seconds to make sure his legs weren't as wobbly as he felt. He settled on the couch next to Phil, coffee in hand, not quite up against the other man but still within arm's reach. "Star Wars. Got that one," he said with a faint grin. Clint knew Phil was kind of a nerd, but then the archer couldn't completely deny some nerdiness after all the video games he'd played, either. He sobered a little, sipping his coffee. He still felt uncertain, like there was something he should do, but he wasn't sure what.
"That may actually mean we're screwed, yes," Phil agreed. "It may be why they still have Romanov. If Loki or his allies are looking for something, she might know some of the places SHIELD would put it." He stared at the file as if it might somehow spit out more information. "So much for drinking to forget."
Tony smirked. Steve had caught him just before he'd managed to turn on the water, but the billionaire didn't protest at all. "Sleep? Who the hell said anything about sleep?" he teased, pulling the blonde into a slow kiss. It was odd, having his lover at almost the exact same height he was, neither having to lean down or or stretch upwards for a kiss. The man still felt like perfection against him, though, and Tony relished the feeling of their bared forms pressed together. "Must've had that helmet on too tight..." Trailing off, he caught Steve's lips in another breathless kiss, his arms draping over Steve's shoulders.
Steve sighed and let his arms slide around Tony's waist. His annoyance eased almost at once, and he rested his forehead against Tony's. "Okay. You mine now? No ore for a few hours?" he teased in return. Steve couldn't resist another brief kiss before he drew back. "C'mon, let's go. Your punishment is me picking the movie."
Clint nodded, relieved to know that he was staying with Phil and Nat. He was also pretty impressed at how easily Tony was stepping into the leadership role. "You got it, tin man."
Tony couldn't help but feel a little bit agitated at the sight of Logan biting into the blonde's perfect skin. Not that Tony had any delusions that Steve might not recover or that Tony had any chance of protecting him, but the possessive move rankled his nerves in a way that he wasn't quite able to understand yet. Willing to make a competition out of it, Tony leaned up and began working the blonde's throat in earnest, licking and nipping as his fingers found their way to one pert nipple and began to slowly tease the sensitive nub. "You feel amazing," he murmured against sweat-slick skin. He wanted Steve to enjoy himself as much as possible, and focusing on Steve let Tony forget the nagging pain of the 'scrape' Logan had left on his back.
"Hey. That's too far," Tony said, standing up. Unlike most everyone else, Tony Stark gave less than two shits about whether the Director got mad at him and threw him off the team. SHIELD was using Tony's tower after all, and the organization had already figured out that Tony's tech-fu was better than theirs and that if Iron Man didn't want them in his tower, they weren't staying in his tower. In that spirit, Tony didn't even blink when Fury fixed him with an exasperated gaze. "That gun had a shelf-life, and Steve chose to make the move before it shit the bed. I'm sure Fitz-Simmons can tell you it's a pile of worthless scrap by now. Or close to it. The other option was to let your favorite marksman try and wield the hammer directly and probably go all Gollum on you."
Tony's heart seemed to give a painful thump, and he struggled for a moment to take a breath. It was Steve's voice, Steve's body. Tony was certain he'd never see the real thing again. The gentle words, the tone.... Tony swallowed hard, staring at the hand that had been extended to him. He wanted it to be real. It looked, felt, and sounded real. The reality of the situation hurt. Not just the illusion, but the whole damn thing. If Loki was willing, no matter the reason behind it, to make things hurt less for even a moment, Tony couldn't help but reassure himself that it was fair for him to take the offering.
Tony's warm brown eyes lit up at the prospect. "You, my friend, are in for a treat," he promised. Anxious to get started, Tony finished up his dinner and offered to help clear away the plates. "Get the TV warmed up and I'll make us some coffee." Tony could not help but notice the dessert sitting on the counter. Even after eating a full meal, he found himself hungry for more, and he felt a sense of giddy schoolboy excitement over spending the evening curled up on the sofa with Steve.
"I didn't realize he was going to... I should have realized that," Steve answered with a sigh, only belatedly piecing together just how blind he'd been. "Sorry." He paid the check and tipped the waitress well before preceding Logan out the door. They were close enough that it wasn't worth hailing a cab, and since they were both in good shape, a brisk walk soon had them on the corner awaiting Tony Stark. "On the upside, if anybody's gonna know a good place to see about meeting somebody, it's Tony." He had watched a disturbing parade of women pass through Tony's bedroom since his break-up with Pepper. "He doesn't sleep alone very often."
Now that was interesting, Tony mentally noted. He might have dismissed the warm flush as anger, but he knew better. Having gotten so thoroughly under Steve's skin had been effortless from the moment they'd met. Tony wasn't looking to butt heads in a public venue, but he could have a little fun. He returned his attention to Steve and tried his best not to grin too smugly. "Bruce and I might have a lot in common - we can talk tech specs till the sun goes down - but seeing as we might be working together again, I thought we - as in you and I - should try and get to know each other better." Tony spread his arms wide and shrugged in a gesture of harmless friendliness. "So, what do you say? Care to spend the evening with me?"
Steve sighed. He hadn't wanted the night to end so early, especially not to have it end with Fury paging them. That rarely meant anything good. "Guess it is. Just don't think you're off the hook for a sleepover tonight... assuming we get to sleep," he added with a groan. Reluctantly they both found their clothes and dressed for the drive back. Showing up disheveled with Tony on his arm was one thing, but showing up naked wasn't on Steve's to do list. For one thing Clint would never, ever let either of them live it down. "I can't wait to see what corner of the sky is falling today. Then again, we should be grateful. I don't think anybody's tried to kill me in at least a week."
Scott held up his hands in surrender. "I didn't even know you could cook. If I get to see that in action, I'm willing to eat whatever comes so long as it won't kill me." He saw no reason to look a gift horse in the mouth. Scott's own cooking skills veered toward macaroni, sandwiches, and the odd microwave meal. While Logan worried about the food, he poured them both generous cups of coffee. "How do you take it?" If he'd ever paid any attention to Logan's habits before, Scott might have known already. They'd eaten breakfast at the same table together for the better part of two years, but he'd never bothered to take note. Scott did his best to shrug off a strange sensation of guilt at the realization.
"We're not dating. Me and Coulson," Clint reassured the server before he continued down the line with Nat, picking food as he went. "This is how rumors get started." When everything was too classified to discuss openly, personal lives became the number one topic around the water cooler whether the facts being spread were real or not. "Seriously, RUMINT nightmare in the making. And of course I’d choke out anyone with something bad to say about Steve. I'd probably leave them alive, though."
Steve felt his suit and the flesh beneath it tear as he ducked back. Thankfully it was a superficial wound, and he knew it would be gone inside a day. Less comforting was the thought of the kind of damage the enraged man could do. Steve caught movement from the corner of his eye and was comforted to realize that Tony was at least okay enough to get up and move. "You need to work on your anger management," Steve gritted out, trying to keep the shield between his body and Creed.
Steve couldn't help enjoying the closeness. He knew Tony was just trying to make Coulson uncomfortable, but his hand rose, and he found himself unconsciously stroking the hair at the nape of Tony's neck just the same. The whole thing might be a mess, but that didn't stop him from kind of liking it. "He's on our side, remember?"
Logan crossed his arms over his chest, looking reluctant. He finally nodded slowly, though. "Yeah. I think I'm about all you have that can deal with it." He glanced at Bruce. "Just about."
"This is one of the rare moments where I almost wish Fury was paranoid enough to put tracking devices in the back of our necks," Coulson mused as they stared out over the vast and rather disheartening expanse of absolutely nothing. Finally he closed his eyes and focused on letting the tense muscles in his body relax. Being vigilant was good, but he hadn't honestly relaxed since they were taken, and that was forcing his body to work double time. If they were going to spend the night walking only to realize they needed to do even more walking, he had to recharge a little first. With food and water out of reach, that left rest. "Do me a favor and poke me if I need to wake up and help you stomp a snake to death or something."
Tony moaned helplessly at those words, arching under his two partners as one hand tangled in the sheets, his short fingernails snagging lightly in the bedsheets. He groaned almost pitifully as Logan's hand fell away from his cock and the man rolled to one side, but then tangled his hands in Steve's hair and dragged him into a starved kiss. His body arched against the taller man's, and he groaned anxiously. "Do it," he breathed, shivering slightly. "Please."
Even with the tension of the moment, Scott had to fight a smile. Coulson was apparently as used to breaking up juvenile arguments as he'd been with the X-Men. "I think we can all be civil." He wrapped a hand around Logan's tense bicep. "Let's sit down."
"Yeah, popcorn sounds good," Steve agreed. Naturally he rose to help Tony make it only to find that it was as simple as tossing a bag into the microwave. He still hadn't quite gotten used to them and food he attempted to prepare in his own tended to veer between burned and frozen. Soon they were settled on the couch in a surprisingly comfortable fashion, eating popcorn and enjoying the movie. It wasn't until he was settled next to Tony side by side that he realized just how long a day it had been. Somehow he'd never managed to get over the idea that he needed to do PT even when it didn't really change anything. His metabolism more or less took care of it all, but Steve still tended to get up early to run or work out. It felt right somehow and a lot more productive than just sitting in his apartment. Unfortunately with the party at the end of the day, Steve found himself drifting off as the images played themselves out across the screen. Before it registered fully just how tired he really was, Steve was asleep, his head falling onto Tony's shoulder as he slumped back on the cushions.
When they arrived, Steve insisted on carrying Tony's bag and holding doors for him. The gestures were old fashioned and perhaps unnecessary, but Steve still felt responsible for Tony getting hurt at all. If he could help in any small way, he intended to. While Tony got himself settled in his bedroom for the night, Steve fetched a pillow and comforter from his own room and began making up a bed for himself on the small couch in the room's sitting area, unwilling to leave Tony unprotected during the night.
At Steve's touch Tony could feel his resolve beginning to crumble. It was a subtle breaching of the wall he'd erected, the crack spidering outward. Tony, barely holding it together already, visibly shuddered as the emotional weight of everything he'd been trying to forget threatened to cripple him. "What do you want me to say?" His voice was little more than a whisper. "That I relive that moment every time I close my eyes? That the only way I can forget is drinking myself blind? Or... or how I can't even look at you and remember...?"
Logan grunted softly as Scott jerked him into the clumsy kiss, but his arms instinctively wrapped around the other man's body. Scott's scent hit him stronger so close: beer, aftershave, and the scent that was distinctly Scott's. Without thought, Logan pressed into the contact, meeting Scott kiss with equal enthusiasm. Rational thought caught up a second later, well after Logan had conveyed his real urges on the matter, but the feral mutant forced himself to pull Scott back to meet his eyes. Logan was panting, his eyes hooded and his face flush. In a voice rougher and deeper than it should've been, he murmured, "Scott... I... *really* wanna keep goin' where this's goin', but... Maybe we should wait 'til you're sober?"
"I'm gonna," Logan affirmed, pressing Scott hard against the sheet rock. He was pretty sure he didn't have the patience to walk the five steps to the bed, anyway. He shifted back just far enough to get his fly unzipped before returning his attention to Scott once more, hooking his hands under the man's knees and pulling them up to let Scott wrap his legs around Logan's waist. He nipped at Scott's throat and gruffly whispered, "Need you."
Memories of those times seemed like yesterday, not decades ago, and it perplexed Bucky that Agent Coulson viewed him as some kind of hero, especially considering he'd been accused of horrible crimes he couldn't properly remember. Still, he mustered another faint smile and thanked Coulson for the thought. "As long as I'm not asked to make a speech or anything. I'll leave that to Steve. He was always much better at it."
Definite consent issues, kidnapping, mind games - though on a pretty mild scale as Loki goes. Contains Loki/Tony and Loki being a little shit. As usual.
Logan groaned his pleasure at the need in Scott's voice. "Fuck yes, baby," he rumbled, placing a gentle bite right below Scott's ear. A skillful shift, and he was slowly sliding into his lover's tight heat, letting out a short, tense moan as he slid home. "Fuck, you're a tight little bitch," he growled. He wasn't sure how Scott would tolerate a little bit of name-calling, but it seemed to fit with the way things were going. He stretched his neck out to nip at the ridge of Scott's ear, his tongue running over the flesh a moment later as his gaze shifted to Nat, drinking in the sight of her pleasuring herself.
Scott moaned around Logan's cock. He was too turned on to think about the fact that it might hurt. He just knew he needed it as badly as Logan did. Sucking as hard as he could, Scott finally drew back. He didn't want Logan to cum too soon. Scott took the break to divest himself of his pants and find the lube in the drawer of the nightstand. He passed the bottle to Logan. "You wanna do the honors?"
For the second time in a span of minutes, Scott clung to Logan again. He needed the anchor this time. Guilty questions swirled through his head. Had Logan struck a deal with Loki? Did his possible new gift explain why Romanov was still being held captive? Scott couldn't voice the questions. If it wasn't true, he'd be asking Logan something that couldn't be un-asked. He might be breaking the fragile new bond between them. He also didn't want to know if it was true because he wasn't sure he could live with that. Instead Scott breathed deep and stroked Logan's back. "I don't mean to go all catatonic, I just... I never thought I'd have a shot at this."
"A pot. All of it. Irish, preferably," Tony decided. He'd found a few of the snacks he'd hidden around the lab, munching on them, but his stomach still gurgled. "Go to the Coffee Cat on the corner. I want one of their raspberry krullers. Or five. Cream cheese, too," he added, still staring at his tablet. Tony clearly had no qualms about using the pair as interns, credentials or no. He'd have respect for them if they figured out the problem at hand.
Scott's shoulders slumped with relief. He'd been ready for rejection, and he frankly wouldn't have blamed Logan if he did feel too strange about it for them to share the same bed again. The ground they stood on had shifted. Everything was strange. In the harsh light of day, they might both regret the whole thing, but Scott didn't really think so. He forced himself up off the couch and drank two glasses of water in quick succession. "There. Now hopefully my head will only mostly be killing me in the morning." The man stumbled somewhat as he made his way back toward Logan's room. "No complaining to me about blue balls in the morning," Scott proclaimed as he stripped his shirt off and kicked off his shoes.
"I don't think I'd have much of a shot considering what you did back there," Darien answered with a shrug. He'd caught Clint's gaze lingering and couldn't help but smile. It never hurt to get noticed by a good-looking guy even if that guy did happen to be spattered with blood. That should have been a turn off. Darien was pretty sure that anyone with half a brain would be turned off by it. Instead it was kind of thrilling. He gave a slight shake of his head, musing at his own lack of self preservation instinct, and ventured, "Anyway, I'll play along. Haven't given the Agency much trouble yet, and those guys are douchebags."
Grudgingly, Tony led the way back to his suite, letting Steve go back to his own room long enough to change. In one of his typically expensive, flashy suits, Tony met back up with Steve in one of the tower's many conference rooms. "Y'know, they're gonna wonder why I'm not more mouthy. Maybe I could just throw 'em a few details. Or we could tell 'em about Logan," he pointed out. Really, the idea of being quiet in front of so many cameras was painful, but the idea of being anything other than what struck his fancy seemed outright inhumane.
Logan growled softly in frustration as Scott teased him with another kiss. "Now I *know* you're just tryin' to get payback," he said, though he smiled faintly and ran a hand through the other man's hair. He'd leaned in for another kiss when the door to his room slid open.
Steve sighed and jumped out behind them. No matter how the mission went, it was going to be a mess. Loki didn't do neat and tidy and, so far, neither did they. The Avengers were effective, but they were a long way from a cohesive, smooth unit. //Neat and tidy's overrated,// Steve decided as he deployed his shoot. A water jump was one thing, but the fewer bumps and bruises he landed with the more he could tolerate getting if the fight got rough. He hoped with the course they'd mapped out, the other team would land on the other side and, with the help of the surrounding terrain,  make it less likely for Loki to get past them.
Logan took a moment to appreciate the amount of athleticism and skill Clint displayed before stuffing a magazine in the Golani rifle he'd picked out. He'd seen what Scott could do more than enough times, so he left his lover to show off to Nat with a faint smirk. As he started putting rounds downrange, the only regret he had was that he was pretty sure he wasn't allowed a cigar to go with the rest of the therapy.
"Well, I figure if I can wake you up because I had a bad dream, you have every right to not pretty up before you answer the door. Though I wasn't expecting to get invited to your bedroom in the case of more nightmares," he said with a teasing smirk. The archer hadn't thought too much of it considering they'd both been well drugged. He hadn't missed some other information, though, seeing Coulson in nothing but sleepwear. //Yeah, that's not a path you need to go down. Still have to look him in the eye and all when he gives you orders.// As the coffee sputtered its readiness, Clint turned to pour Phil a cup and push it across the counter to him before preparing one of his own. "Not too sore this morning, I hope?"
The only times when it hurt to be with Clint were the ones when she could feel how much he wanted something she couldn't give. Nat had given up any aspirations of love at a young age. They'd never come back. No matter what he said, Clint had never lost them. He carried his hope on his sleeve. She locked her gaze with his and reached up, her hand stroking over his cheek. Love was beyond her grasp, but affection wasn't. Nat wasn't in love with Clint, but she loved him more than any person on earth besides herself. "Perfect," she praised while Clint's hips moved at a languid pace.
"You do. Forgive me, Mr. Summers, but you do. If Agent Barton picked up on changes, then you have. There's no way around that. You led the man, you've known him for years, and you've seen it."
"Probably Loki's influence." Coulson had noticed an upswing in crime in general, and he was beginning to have a sinking feeling about how many people Loki might have visited throughout the world. "We appreciate you coming."
Scott rose, but he didn't agree with the sentiment at all. They were playing a dangerous game, and he didn't see any way it could come out well. "And what happens if they do? Do you really think talking's going to be enough by then?" He caught the dirty look one of the nurses was giving him and rubbed the bridge of his nose. "Let's get out of here, go back to your room." Reasoning with Logan wasn't possible most of the time. Scott was beginning to remember vividly that Jean wasn't the only reason they'd nearly killed one another a few times.
Coulson let out a soft sigh that sounded more like a groan. He hated himself a little for not stopping things then and there. What happened with Natasha had never been intended as more than a one off. With Clint... but, then again, if it was his only chance, maybe it wouldn't be such a good idea to say no. "Maybe we should find a more private spot, then."
"Logan, we only get so many chances to regroup before Loki takes over the world and turns us into his personal ant farm. Much as I'd like to not be dead, I have to be as ready to put it on the line as the rest of you." He glanced at Bruce, "Rage-inspired invincibility and healing powers or not."
Steve lost the thread of worrying about getting Tony to work immediately. He forgot almost everything, including his own middle name as Tony worked at the sensitive skin and pressed tightly against him. "Maybe... maybe longer than five minutes," he panted, wrapping his legs around Tony to prevent the man getting any ideas about moving away. Already he was half hard against his lover's thigh. "Maybe we should take care of this first."
"Yeah, well, you're a bad influence. Or a good one. I don't even care," Steve murmured as he rocked into Tony's grip. It wasn't that Steve hadn't always enjoyed sex, but being with Tony was something altogether different. He supposed it was the feeling behind everything and the way Tony made him feel like he could never quite catch his breath in the best of all possible ways. Smiling, Steve murmured, "Love you. Also, not to take away from the moment, but I'd like you to fuck me into the mattress."
"I think I'm gonna be," Steve answered, glad that the tension from earlier had diffused. He already had almost everything unpacked, his clothes hung in the closet and the few knick-knacks he'd acquired set out along with an old photo book. "Y'know, I don't think I've ever actually had a room this big. The apartment at SHIELD was nice, but this place... it's really something, Tony." He nodded toward the laptop that was set up on the desk next to the photo album and some file folders. "I understand a lot of it. I can find everything Clint bookmarked for me." Steve was proud of himself for remembering the proper term. It felt some days as if he was learning a whole new language. "I know you can look up people, though, find out more about them. Could you show me?"
Victor Creed grunted as five hundred pounds of man and power armor landed on him; he withdrew his claws from Tony's faceplate and clasped onto the man's sides with both hands, grinning with manic glee as he sank adamantium into the suit's sides, eliciting a scream of pain from Tony.
Steve woke with a shaky gasp. The sound of beeping greeted his ears, and he couldn't stop trembling, shaking with a numbing cold. He swallowed hard and blinked, finally spotting a familiar face leaning over him. "C-coulson..."
Having regained as much composure as he ever had, Tony shrugged and moved to stand closer to Steve. "I think we've actually got the copyright on that. At least, I do." He shrugged, grabbing his drink from the bar again. "I mean, what're you going to do here? Chase geishas and fight Yakuza? Wait for your brother to turn up again?"
"He'll be the one doing the most yelling, though." Tony shrugged. "Look on the bright side; the LGBT community has a new hero."
Scott almost choked on the water he'd been sipping between shots to try to stave off at least the worst of the hangover the next day. "Us?"
"Not a chance," Steve answered evenly, though he leaned in to whisper in Tony's ear, "But if you get some real work done, I might be persuaded to do a lot more than sit when you get home."
Fury's one-eyed gaze drifted to Tony, shifting from looking fairly pleased to looking ready to kill again. "Please tell me this plan doesn't involve me losing another Avenger in charge, 'cause I'd hate to have to have these two put to sleep," he said, gesturing to Fitz-Simmons.
Lacking anything for his fingers to fool with and his feet too high up off the floor to bounce a knee, Clint found himself fiddling with his own fingers as he tried to come up with a semi-decent answer. He finally shrugged and looked away, looking as agitated as he ever got. "I don't know. I like being around you, Phil." He quirked a faint smile and finally managed to look at his handler. "I mean, maybe you're not as exciting as Tash, but... we get a lot of excitement at work." He looked down at the counter, nudging his coffee cup with one finger, "...and sometimes I just wanna feed the ducks."
Natasha shook her head and waved the idea away. "Doesn't matter. I wouldn't say anything to Clint I wouldn't say in front of you." Though she didn't have nearly the buddy relationship with Coulson that Clint had forged, Natasha trusted the man. He had the greater good in mind when he acted, and he'd proven more than a few times that he wasn't an idiot. That was all she really needed to know. "Besides, this way you can keep me from killing Clint with my scary new mind powers."
Fury was two steps from the door already. "Just stand by. Stay within twenty four hours of HQ, and don't get drunk again until I tell you you can. I have to go make a long distance phone call."
Tony smiled warmly at Steve, his fingers still carding through his lover's hair as he pressed their foreheads together. "I think I like it, too," he said, pressing a kiss to Steve's lips. He was a little surprised by how much the blonde was into the idea of possession, but he couldn't deny that it was hot. "And they look good on you. The hickeys. I like seeing them, too." He smirked faintly. "I think they're just trying to get used to the idea that you may not actually be a boy scout."
"You're very well preserved, Mr. Rogers," Tony grinned, "if you don't mind my saying so." The easy banter and the warm atmosphere of being in Steve's company made Tony feel more alive than he had in ages. He could not imagine returning to his room and drowning himself in misery. Not after tonight. Tony Stark was officially back in the game. He would bear the scars of what had happened for the rest of his life, but he refused to let the painful memories rule him any longer.
"When Scott was missing," she filled in, smile fading only marginally as she led the way down an oak-paneled hall. "It's alright. I'm glad he's found a place where he's happy." Jean opened the door to a large office at the end of the hallway. "Professor? We have visitors."
"I think your gut's trying to tell you something," Bruce pointed out. "You should probably feed it."
Phil gritted his teeth. He wanted more than anything to lash out. He didn't let himself. It wouldn't work out well for him, and it probably would've worked out even more poorly for Clint given the fact that Victor's attention was fixed so firmly on him. Instead of screaming or throwing himself at Creed and hoping to buy Clint a few seconds, he repeated, "Look at me, Clint. Please, look at me." If he could have promised anything to get Clint free, he would have in that moment. Torture had never been particularly effective against him. Pain, he could endure. Seeing Clint terrified and helpless was something else. "You're going to be okay. I promise that you are going to be okay."
Not one to be accused of being sentimental, Tony diverted, "Who wouldn't wanna be pressed against all this?" he asked, laying a hand on Steve's well-muscled chest for emphasis. In spite of the bravado, though, Tony sighed contentedly and turned towards his lover, nuzzling his head against the man's chest. It felt good. Safe. "This is more like it. They need to make bigger hospital beds so this can be a thing."
It wasn't so bad at first. The wave of weariness washed over him just as it had before. Steve had to brace himself against the wall to keep from sliding down to his knees, but he managed. After the first few seconds, it became clear that things weren't going well. Bracing his back tight against the wall and gritting his teeth, Steve fought to keep his arms steady, but the battle was one he began losing rather quickly. "Get... get the gun," he managed, finger falling away from the trigger as he tried to hold the weapon out toward Logan. Steve slipped into unconsciousness so quickly he wasn't entirely sure whether he managed the transfer or not.
"You just wanna get your hands in my suit," Tony replied casually. "And the one you're adapting the gun to is, well..." Standing up, he took a second to rearrange his thoughts. The neuro interface was still taking some getting used to. Suddenly, red and gold seemed to erupt from around the arc reactor, quickly encasing Tony in the familiar suit. "It's a little attached," he said as the faceplate slid back, "but we can do this as long as I can keep a hand free to work and the two of you don't get too irritating."
"I never said you did," Phil answered mildly. "I just pointed out that if you're holding back, it's a bad idea. That's all." He crossed his arms and leaned back in the plastic seat as if it was perfectly comfortable. "We don't have the same kind of skills that Xavier had at his disposal, but it's still a bad idea to dismiss what we do have."
Bucky tried to focus on Coulson's soothing voice. Every instinct in him screamed to tear the place apart, along with anyone who might be in his way. He breathed heavily, shaking as he struggled to regain control. Instead of sending him over the edge into a psychotic hurricane of violence, Coulson's touch comforted Bucky, and he felt himself beginning to calm down. "Thank... thank you," he managed, sounding as if he'd run a marathon. "I... think I'm... okay now..."
"Mmhm," Tony replied. Steve was holding him tighter than usual. Tony knew why, but he also knew that talking about it in that particular moment was just going to make the reality harder. Forcing himself to relax, he Steve as close as he could and tried not to think about the idea that he might end up dead just as he'd found someone who mattered so much to him.
"How's your 'sharp points through the eye' phobia?" Logan shot back, leaning against the plane's safety harness as if it were the only thing keeping him from making good on his threat.
"Maybe I did," Scott allowed earnestly. He hated the idea of becoming so jaded, but Logan was right. It was hard to think of any way that people like the scum trafficking in mutant slaves could be negotiated with. He knew what Magneto would do to men like that, and Scott was willing to admit to himself that he would likely have paid money for a ticket to watch it. "Either way, I don't feel comfortable there for now. I know that who I am at the moment isn't who they need or want me to be. Here, maybe I can just be."
The mortal slept easily. Loki honestly wished he could have done the same. Instead he sat brooding over the events of the day and trying to discern whether he felt different. //If I hadn't seen myself, would I know at all?// He closed his eyes and rubbed at his forehead as if that might soothe the changes away. He had no desire to be a monster no matter what company he kept. At length he rose and stalked to the door, ordering whatever fledgling mutant was there to see about bringing food to the room. If he couldn't sleep, at least he could have a decent meal.
Logan laughed. He couldn't help it. The idea that Jean might be vanilla... Well, maybe he hadn't missed out in as much as he'd thought. "Just promise me one thing, Scott," he said, tipping Scott's head up to look at him. "If there's ever anything you wanna try, let me know. Not a lot I wouldn't consider, especially for you."
Having just started to relax, Clint tensed again as he looked up to see a pair of odd-looking people approaching from the other plane. "What the hell is that?"
"Nat?" Clint had managed to keep it together, but as the spots from his vision cleared and it became obvious the woman wasn't there, he felt cold panic threatening to take over. "Coulson, where is she? Summers, she has to be around her somewhere! Find her!" he growled. His mind was already coming up with all the horrible things the woman would experience at Loki's hands. The god wouldn't just kill her. He'd... "No... no... nonono..." His eyes darted about helplessly as he searched for some sign, some clue as to where Loki had taken their teammates.
The weight of Mystique's body and the motion of her throwing herself toward the ground brought Steve down with her. He found his feet quickly but couldn't quite get vertical with the woman still choking him out. Most opponents were easy enough to unseat, but Mystique's slender form made prying her away something like trying to disentangle oneself from a spiderweb.
Tony responded with a much weaker yell of his own, his hair mussed in the early morning light as he squinted painfully at Logan's backlit silhouette. "Ahh... whyyy are we yelling...?" He rolled over and pulled a pillow over his head.
"Oh, believe me, anytime," she agreed with a throaty chuckle before stealing a kiss from Scott too. "You boys are absolutely beautiful, and if you ever need a little extra something? Call me. If I'm free, I might just show up." Natasha slipped from bed and didn't bother cleaning up before she tugged her pants and shirt back on, balling up her underwear in a hand without any apparent shame at the idea of walking through the Tower holding it. She gave the boys a final wave before sauntering from the room.
"We've been keeping him in the hallway. He's been waiting for any news about you." //Or about Bucky.// Natasha decided that the last bit might be better kept to herself and tilted her head instead. "Would you like me to get him? I wanted to make sure you were up to it first." Out of everyone, she knew that Steve would be the hardest to face. He knew enough for the whole situation to be embarrassing and not nearly enough to offer the comfort Tony really needed.
"Alright, Central Park sounds close enough," Logan agreed, squeezing Scott's hand. It'd get them away from the city's fumes for a minute, at least. "Though I think you're just trying to bait some idiots into gettin' themselves killed," he added with a grin.
Fury nodded. "I'll trust your opinion." Noting that Barton looked ready to pipe up again, Fury pointed at him. "You spotted the issue first. You're in charge of keeping an eye on him. You see any cracks, any craziness, any weird blue eyes, you let me know. Or just kill him right there."
Clint, obviously feeling the adrenaline, managed a grim smirk nonetheless. "That deer had it in for us."
"Dunno if I can get used to starched jeans, but I'm sure what I'm wearin' could use a refresh. Pretty sure I couldn't cram myself into one o' his shirts if I wanted to," he remarked, glancing back at the pile of already snoring playboy on the couch. "So where'm I sleepin', anyway?" He hesitated, then glanced at Steve. "And... I dunno what all that super serum does for ya, bub, but if I look like I'm havin' a bad dream, best to just let me sleep through it."
"I sure as hell ain't babysittin' you people," Logan threw in, folding his arms over his chest. "I haven't even met Thor, and the rest o' you're fuckin' nuts in ways that makes Scientology make sense."
Charles propped his chin in hand thoughtfully. "That is troublesome, then. You haven't actually seen Erik?"
Steve sucked in a breath, belatedly realizing what Thor was thinking. He closed his eyes for a second and then steeled himself. "She's taking it pretty hard," he agreed mildly before moving onto the next leg of the verbal journey. It hurt like hell to talk about. It hurt like hell using the past tense when he talked about Tony. "Tony and Pepper broke up awhile ago - it... well, it was messy, but they were okay. Friends." He met Thor's gaze and managed a wavering smile. "We were together. Me and Tony." The smile broke, and it was suddenly damn hard to breathe through the pain. //Were.//
"It *could* be describe as enthusiastic. Happy. Maybe gay," Tony allowed with his usual smirk, deadpan as he heedlessly led them to the bar itself. "Scotch, Danny. And whatever my associates want."
It was all Steve could do not to beg Tony to give in and just touch him already. Just the look in Tony's eyes made him weak in the knees. The man was sex on legs. Even if he'd wanted to try being strong and saying no, Steve wasn't sure it was possible to turn down Tony Stark looking so hot and so eager. "Please, Tony..." The words escaped in a breathless gasp despite his best efforts.
When Steve woke, the sun was shining in through the windows, and he felt warm and comfortable. He shifted and reached out to lay a hand on his pillow only to register that his pillow felt very, very strange. Blinking slowly to consciousness, Steve realized that his "pillow" happened to be Tony Stark's lap. He glanced up only to find Tony already awake and looking down at him. The soldier blushed at once and quickly sat up, scooting away. "I'm sorry. I didn't mean to fall asleep on you like that..." Then again, Steve's mind finally registered, Tony didn't look mad. Amused, maybe, but not mad. "Sleep okay?"
Simmons looked up at him as if she didn't recognize him in the slightest. "Er, Agent Coulson, sir, it... you..." She blinked as if utterly uncertain what to say.
Clint sagged back against the couch, looking like his mind was completely blown. "I... not a big deal? So, you did Coulson on a mission, and that... I can't... and why do I need a heads-up about kinks?" he asked, his mind finally catching up to the first half of the conversation. "I did not decide I was dating Coulson. That was a theoretical conversation. A really awkward one." Clint was pretty sure he'd need a few days before it was possible to make eye contact with his handler.
"Tell the team I'm sorry I wasn't there." Natasha slumped forward, elbows braced on her knees. "I hate feeling useless."
Natasha's gaze narrowed, but there was no venom in her expression. It was back to something closer to their usual banter. She still kept her eyes on Bruce, but the man looked a lot less likely to break any of them over the conference table.
"You've got it," Natasha agreed. They stopped off at Logan's room and found Scott bored and edgy and ready to blow off some steam too. Nat smiled at the man. "You're gonna like this." She was genuinely intrigued to see what Scott could do. It was one thing knowing someone was a mutant. It was another thing seeing it firsthand. She led the charge to the shooting range and gestured to a well-stocked cabinet just inside. "Pick your poison, boys."
Tony shrugged. "Or they'll just wonder why you're turning colors," he pointed out. He tilted his head. He hadn't missed the flinch. "So, why not just cover it with an illusion? I mean, if you can turn into..." He swallowed hard, unable to finish the sentence, and looked away. "Point being, you could just cover it up if it bugs you that much." His voice tensed a little as he added, "I mean, if you can do it while you're fucking me, it must not be that tough to do, right?" He knew he was pushing buttons, but he couldn't quite bring himself to care. He'd promised to do what Loki told him to do. He'd said nothing about being nice, and Tony wasn't any more above playing semantics than Loki was.
Natasha tensed at the sound of approaching footsteps, but it was obvious from the way Sif greeted the trio of men that they were the allies she had mentioned. The blond approached, sweeping Natasha's hand into his own and bending to kiss it. "Fandral, at your service, my lady."
The surprise and shocked pleasure on Clint's face fed Coulson's ego appropriately. The man looked like he was coming apart at the seams, and it was gorgeous. Clint turned on was the most beautiful thing he'd seen in a long time. Already Coulson was filing the sound of his moans away to review at a later time. He set a quick pace, grabbing one of Clint's hands and moving it to his head to let the man know that he didn't mind some instruction.
It was then that Clint remembered the surveillance. He tensed, doing his best to not look like he'd just been caught with a dead body. He'd known Coulson too long to think that that tone of voice was anything but bad news. Shouldering his bow, he did his best to look like it was business as usual as he replied with a terse, "Yes, sir," and followed Phil out of the cell block.
Clint folded his bow and put it on his back. "Let's hope Summers still has his shit together," he decided, glancing back at Logan before stalking out through the group of confused-looking junior agents. It had to have been a hell of a sight, Clint reflected, them dumping a guy with an arrow sticking out of him into a cell with no obvious intent of providing medical care. //They'll figure it out in a minute.//
Clint's smile broadened at the memory. "I remember that now," he said. It had been a minor op that had gotten way more out of hand than it should have due to the delayed extraction. Phil had been so unbelievably angry, Clint had found himself sneaking offerings of food and coffee to the man and avoiding direct interaction for a week before it had all cooled down. The archer's eyes softened, and he tilted his head a little as he traced a finger along Phil's jaw. "You weren't angry, were you? You were scared," he realized.
If he hadn't seemed so damned sincere, it would have been smarmy. As it was, Nat found the whole thing kind of funny. "Thanks. Now let's go wake up Thor before his brother can do anymore damage."
"A feast is called for with our companions returned!" he agreed heartily, clapping a hand against Coulson's back as if he hadn't just been warned to treat the man's bruised body carefully.
Logan shrugged. "If I drink a whole bottle at once, it lasts a couple seconds," he said, picking up the shot of whiskey. "Otherwise... I dunno. It just... reminds me o' somethin'." Every shot of cheap whiskey seemed to make memories dance at the edge of his mind. Good ones, surprisingly. Camaraderie at a rundown airplane hangar-turned-bar. Going home to someone he loved. Not much more, but it was as much comfort as he got. Logan glanced at Steve. He didn't know much about the guy, aside from the fact that he was America's pet project, and that he looked like a complete anachronism.
"That's your team," the man agreed placidly, "but that's not what I asked about. The two of you are living together. He's hardly left your side. Had to knock him out just to get to you. That's seems very, very friendly." It was easy to see that the drugs were making Tony a little loopy, but that was for the best. The more pliant he was, the easier it would be to put on a proper show. "Your conquests are common knowledge, Mr. Stark. Are you trying to tell me that you have no interest whatsoever in Steve Rogers apart from professional courtesy?"
Logan looked around the room as if subconsciously expecting to see some visible manifestation of the AI in question. "So, basically, you're tellin' me you gotta build your friends?"
"Good. I'd hate to have to kill you after all that bonding." Phil relaxed more the longer they drove. Even in times of stress, Lola had become something of a safe space. Being inside her and driving down the road felt very close to freedom. Normally he preferred alone time, but it was oddly comforting to have Clint slouched in the passenger seat. "Your taste in music isn't completely awful."
"No," Steve answered firmly. He didn't look away for a second. On that point, at least, he could be completely honest without fear of saying something that wasn't his to give away. "He didn't hurt anyone. He turned himself in when he started to think that something might be wrong." That was the gospel truth too even though it was a severely truncated version of the truth. "I can't say he's okay anymore than I can say you are, though. We both know that wouldn't be the whole story."
Tony nodded, taking a deep breath. Questions were the last thing he was in the mood for, especially from Fury, but he wasn't going to leave his lover's side anytime soon. "Let's go."
Bruce offered Nat a wry grin at her suggestion that he dress and nodded. "Yeah, think that'd be best." He glanced at Jemma and his smile turned more awkward as he pulled his shredded pants a little closer to himself. "I'll, uh... need to change, but... coffee in a bit?" He knew they'd be loading up for another mission soon - for which he reminded himself to pack something with more give in it - but he wanted to make sure he got that damn coffee before he went anywhere else.
"More than capable," Victor assured, shrugging off his coat and letting it hit the floor. He had to admit to a faint bit of nervousness as he closed distance with the self-professed god. The man was powerful, no doubt. The idea of being a top for him almost seemed absurd, but of course if Loki was willing... Deciding it was best not to disappoint, Victor fisted a clawed hand in Loki's robes and dragged him into a rough, possessive kiss. His other hand landed firmly on Loki's hip, pulling their bodies flush together.
Clint was grinning ear to ear until Nat mentioned it not being a state secret. He sighed dramatically. "I'm always the last one to hear these things," he pouted, crossing his arms over his chest while Phil looked more flustered than Clint was sure he'd ever seen him. "Nat, should I tell him what else I heard, or... save that for later?"
Steve looked at him evenly. "If I find out any of this is a lie, I let Hulk and your brother settle who gets what pieces of you when it's done. Understood?"
Tony stopped for a moment to offer Steve his typical cocky smirk. "What's the right answer? 'Challenge accepted'?" Grinning even more broadly at Steve's put-out expression, Tony dove back into his work. He licked at the head of the man's cock a few more times before slowly letting the shaft slide into his mouth. He sucked and teased, his tongue manipulating the swollen flesh skillfully. After a moment, he paused, his eyes raising to meet Steve's bright blue gaze. Then, with a muffled moan, he slid forward, letting the blonde's thick shaft slowly glide into his throat. He didn't pause until his lips were stretched around the base of Steve's cock, then drew back slowly only to repeat the process again and again.
The tears were falling almost at once, and Steve slid his arms around Tony's waist and pulled him in tight. "I love you too. I never thought... I... don't you dare ever leave me again. I'm with Pepper on this one," he managed, voice thick with emotion. "I can't do it. I don't want to." Steve carded his fingers through Tony's hair, simply touching and soothing them both with the gesture. "I need you right here with me." He let himself flash back for a moment to the aching nights he'd spent without Tony next to him. "When Jarvis asked me to go down into the lab, I thought just... just going in there... I couldn't even..." He didn't know how to explain it, hoped that Tony understood without him being able to properly put it all into words. "I never want to do this without you again."
Logan's relief at seeing Scott alive was tempered by Fury's presence. "She's not. He said he was gonna send her back. He didn't say when." Logan left out the reason he'd been returned. It was none of SHIELD's business in his mind.
Coulson answered with a faint smile. They both knew better. Steve could get Tony to do things that no other human being on Earth likely could, but that didn’t make him a miracle worker, or at least not enough of one to facilitate quite so drastic a resolution. “I’ll try asking him. In the meantime, I’m thinking of talking to Fitz. He’s young, but he’s bright, forward-thinking. He’s honestly the best bet after Stark.” The fact that Fitz didn’t have any entrenched thoughts about how he approached problems would leave him free to be more creative in solving Bucky’s particularly unique issue. “Assuming we can keep Barnes from strangling him.”
Logan chose to ignore the unease that Scott's comments about Jean had brought up. His feelings on the matter were almost more of a jumble than the swiss cheese that was his memory. Instead, he focused on Scott's question. "They'll wanna know all the names you can remember. Any locations, any prisoner's names, if they ever said anything about who their target market was or why they were focusing more on mutants than normal humans. Really, any details you can come up with could help: smells, sounds, how many times you were transported. The more you can give, the more we can look. I dug up a good chunk o' information on their locations lookin' for you, but I had to do it without tippin' anyone off, so I didn't get as much as I'd like." //Or the opportunity to cut pieces outta every last one of 'em.// "If you recognized any accents, or even if you noticed whether they all had the same accent, same language. How they caught you and exactly where's gonna be important, too." He felt guilty, asking Scott to recall the next, "And anything else they did or said in the exam. And if they seemed to have any sort of organization or rules or restraint when it came to prisoner control." More restrained captors meant a more organized, large-scale operation with some big-time, business-smart backers. Already, Logan had seen signs of that much. The fact that Scott was still alive and hadn't been raped more than suggested that there was a very big backer behind all this, perhaps even a fairly well-to-do foreign government.
"Alright, good," Tony said, then looked up at Fitz-Simmons. "Still want you two to make sure it works with my suit - preferably without the dying side effects - just in case."
At first Scott let his nerves get the best of him. Logan was huge, and even going slow it was hard. Just when the pain almost got the best of him, Scott saw the look on Logan's face and heard the catch in his voice, and he gave in. The moment Scott's body relaxed, he felt Logan ease in deeper and groaned, pain suddenly the farthest thing from his mind. "Oh fuck." He read the flicker of unease on Logan's face and shook his head. "Good. It's good. Don't stop."
"Clint, I think you'd better have a seat," he said, far less patiently than Jemma had, looking at the archer in a way that said he wouldn't mind letting the Other Guy explain why he should if it came down to it.
"We're working on this. Right now the first thing is to keep you stable," the doctor explained as gently as he could. "The rest we worry about as step two. What you need right now is rest."
In which Logan tries to help, Tony is a terrible patient, and Scott takes his new eyes for a test drive
Clint drew back a little, eyes searching the other man's face as he spoke, brow furrowed. "Phil... I don't... I don't think I could do that." The idea sounded terrible. Not so much the idea of sleeping with Nat, of course, but just the idea of going to someone else if Phil was still trying to recover. Clint worried his lower lip, running a hand down Phil's chest. "I mean, I know... Considering my past... exploits, I get why you'd think..." He trailed off, trying to get his thoughts in order. "I don't think I want anyone else. I'll wait, okay?"
"Think I've had enough sleep," Tony declared, looking to the nurse and pointing to his IV line. "You can just go ahead and take this away. I'll get my own cocktail. Maybe gimme some pills to go."
"Guys." Bruce's voice was soft but somehow managed to carry enough weight to draw their attention, save for Clint. "We need him to tell us how to fix the issue with the hammer. And knowing where Tony is wouldn't hurt, either."
Coulson couldn't help smiling. Stark was an abrasive asshole sometimes, but he wasn't a bad guy. He hid it well much of the time. Though he had no intention of stealing Tony's scotch, Coulson did rummage around and assemble a sandwich with the ingredients from Tony's kitchen. He was beginning to wonder if the man was really as incapable a cook as he often professed. Judging by the level of gourmet ingredients he kept on hand, it looked like he could not only cook but cook well. He filed the information away and stretched out on the couch to eat his sandwich and attempt relaxation for a few hours before he had to go into Tony's room and find a way to make the man sleep.
"Yeah, well, I can't get drunk or high, I don't gamble, we both know womanizing's not my thing... I should have some kind of vice, right? Picking fights isn't as good an idea anymore as it was when I was a kid." It was one thing getting beaten up for smarting off or calling someone out for being a jerk. Whaling on someone half your size when they didn't have enhanced strength and reflexes was a whole other ballgame. "You go get some sleep. Remember, your lady assigned me to keep you out of the lab sometimes." Crush or no, Steve was starting to think that maybe moving in with Tony wasn't such a bad idea after all.
Phil watched Steve go and felt a surge of gratitude. "I'm sorry," he said as soon as Steve was clear of the table. "About earlier. I know you didn't mean it that way, and you're thinking the way you should be thinking. The way we both should be thinking. I guess maybe this whole thing's under my skin more than I realized."
If the commentary hadn't been on such a grim subject, Logan would've been hard put not to have a laugh at just how ridiculous Thor sounded. As it was, the feral mutant focused on his food. There were a lot of touchy subjects flying around the table, and he found himself wishing Scott was there to help mitigate some of his utter inability to deal with people's feelings.
Clint smirked, well aware of what Coulson was trying to politely get at. Knowing he'd probably embarrass the poor guy, he answered, "Oh, he handles pretty well. Good and resilient."
Darien found himself staring at the thug as he scrambled up, looked around in a wild panic, then spat on the floor and all but ran out the front door. "Jesus..." He jumped at the feeling of Clint's hand settling on his knee and managed an uneasy laugh. "So, uh, I'm guessing that is your idea of a good time?" He was pretty sure he was freaked out, but underneath that, there was something else. Darien's adrenaline was flowering, and he found himself wondering if the bathrooms were too disgusting to be worth checking out for a quickie after all.
Logan laughed quietly to himself as they moved out, settling into step beside Natasha. "You know, I think blondie back there has a crush on you," he said with a wink. "Not that I can blame him."
Feeling slightly better for having showered, Tony stepped out of the bathroom with a fairly ragged-looking towel wrapped around his waist. He was starting to feel hungry again, but pride kept him from asking for food. Knowing Loki had far less leverage on him was serving quite well to give him more of his old defiance back. Instead of asking for clothing, Tony settled in the ragged wing-backed chair that was obviously for Loki and casually propped his ankle on his knee. "Figure out how to convince them you're really not an asshole yet?" He smirked at the glare he got. "I mean, giving me back's a start. Alive. And saving Barton from the hammer. You might also want to apologize to Phil."
With Steve, Clint and Coulson all stalking in together, it took no time for them to scramble a secure cell to dump Logan in. "Sir, is he-"
"I hope so," Steve answered. He still remembered the heart-pounding fear he felt when Tony fell through the portal, those breathless moments before his eyes opened. It had been hell. Nevermind that earlier the same day he'd been ready to throw Tony through a wall. All it took was thinking that the man might be gone to realize that none of the fighting mattered. Steve shook it off with an effort and met Logan's gaze again. "You shouldn't give up, though. There's a right fit for everybody."
"Good. It's best you understand the situation if nothing else." Nat turned on her heel and led the way out of the room without bothering to check whether the others would follow. They didn't have a whole lot of other choices.
Scott swallowed hard. It had been a long time since he had reason to hold a civil conversation with anyone. "I'm not crazy, right? You're real?" It sounded like Logan, looked like Logan, but the idea that he was safe was too much. Scott reached out and closed trembling fingers around Logan's arm, shuddering at the feeling of the solid warmth beneath his hand. "You're real," he echoed with a shaky sigh. The man's stiff shoulders slumped, and Scott let himself feel the weight of the relief, let it drag his eyes closed again. For once he was in a room with someone he didn't have to watch like a hawk. The thought of a hospital brought up a sudden new rush of panic, and Scott gave a jerky shake of his head as his eyes opened again, "Just... can we go.. go somewhere safe? A hotel or something? I just want to get cleaned up." His voice was rough even to his own ears, but Scott found that he couldn't tolerate the idea of being examined by yet another stranger.
Clint grunted and nodded as if he'd expected the response. He pushed himself away from the bar and stood with a sigh. "I tried," he said, placing himself between the bruiser and Darien. "Fuck off."
Coulson smiled despite himself as he took Clint's hand and let the man haul him upward. "That sounds like a solid plan." When they got back, Phil considered changing and then decided against it. He was exhausted, drained after his conversation with Clint. For once the people around him could forgive a lack of professional dress. If they ended up going somewhere other than the lab, then he could see about a change. They got Clint cuffed up on the way in, Phil feeling even worse than he had before about the situation, and they headed into the lab.
Logan was even less graceful about it, staring openly and opening his mouth to ask what the hell had happened - he hadn't bothered to read the file he'd been sent - but Nick Fury was mercifully sitting next to him, and even more mercifully applied a steel-toed boot to Logan's adamantium shin-bone before he could say something profoundly idiotic. The mutant grunted and kept his mouth shut.
Logan grinned. Scott drunk was turning out to not just be entertaining, but more or less the most amazing thing ever. As if to keep Scott focused, Logan casually ran a hand up the man's thigh, hooking his thumb in Scott's belt. "Just don't take too long," he said, grabbing a shot for himself. "Hate to have to fuck you right here in this booth. Might have some explainin' to do when we get back," he said, giving Nat a faint smile to let her know he hadn't forgotten she was also on the menu.
In which Clint and Phil have a surprisingly relaxing day... for awhile. Then everything goes to hell.
It didn't take long for a response, and Scott was half surprised. That could be good or bad. If Steve was dead, people would be scrambling. If he was just badly hurt, they might be waiting. Neither option sounded like a happy one. "What's he say?"
It was an awkward ride back to headquarters, not in the least because Logan had insisted on driving Tony's very expensive sports car at insane speeds down the highway. That aside, of course, there was the angry silence hanging over everyone. Tony managed to keep his hands to himself, knowing Steve wouldn't let him do anything with Logan right there.
The junior agent held up a set off high-tech looking handcuffs. "There were some other stipulations," he said, looking almost apologetic.
Bruce sighed and pulled off his glasses. "We're trying to work out how to make the gun not kill the user. But apparently that hammer feeds off something inside it, and taking its... mojo from it means it has to feed off something else. Also means it's got a shelf life. And it means that any prototypes are out of the question until we can at least get a decent theoretical model that doesn't break down."
Victor snorted, shoving Clint to the floor and moving toward Phil. "You talk too much, suit," he growled, catching Phil by the tie and staring hard at him. He had to admit to being impressed; Phil was keeping his cool rather well. "Just makes me want to hurt him more. He your little fucktoy?" Victor's gaze moved back to Clint, who was pulling himself back into a sitting position and already looping his cuffed hands under his legs to get them in front of himself. "I wouldn't try anything else, pretty. You wouldn't want me to perforate your pet bureaucrat." Clint froze, and Victor smirked, turning his attention back to Phil. "But it'd bother you if I hurt him, wouldn't it? Really hurt him. He's yours, isn't he? Or you want him to be. You want to fuck him. Maybe I should instead."
Victor scowled, about to rail at Loki for letting the man go when he noticed Natasha. "Oh, she's nice. I get to play, right?" he said, moving closer and smiling like he'd been handed a new toy. He leaned on the bars - electrified only for prisoners, thanks to Loki's magic - and leered at her. "You look like you've got some fight in you. I like that."
That definitely should have set off warning bells. Instead Darien heard himself moan a little bit too loudly considering there were other people around. "Uh... that... you... really?" It was dirty talk. It had to be. Because outside of porn, people didn't do that, did they? //And outside of sci-fi, they dion't turn invisible. And outside of spy flicks, no one could kill a half a dozen guys in under a minute without breaking a sweat.// "Oh, fuck, you mean it. Yeah, okay. Only live once, right?"
"Maybe only part of their sense of self worth?" he suggested with a smile. "They are helping, and Simmons was the only one who didn't look at me like I was a cheap hooker for having a few hickeys." Steve trailed his fingers over Tony's chest idly. "Not that I mind, exactly. I like them. I like... I like them seeing the marks and knowing that I'm yours." It was old fashioned or possibly not politically correct, but Steve didn't much care. His only concern was that Tony knew exactly how he felt. "I like being yours."
"A date and hanging out with the Avengers? I am moving up in the world," Jemma teased, her fingers squeezing Bruce's hand affectionately. "I think that sounds rather lovely, though." She wondered how many members of the team would show up. Tony and Steve would likely come as a show of support, such as it was. Coulson and Clint... she doubted that very much. Natasha was impossible to read at the best of times, though Jemma tended to think the woman might cast her lot in with Clint and Coulson since they'd been working together for so long. "It's going to be an interesting situation. Should we make an evite, or do you think we should just sort of spread the word?"
"Mmm hmm. You're more than deep enough." Steve stole a kiss while he started the water, "Besides, I know Bruce wouldn't sleep with you. He likes you too much to risk killing you. Most of the time." Tony knew how to push buttons better than anyone else in the entire world. If anyone could bring out the big guy during the course of normal conversation, it was Tony Stark. "Now get in here and get clean. Then you're sleeping. Whether I follow you to the lab like a puppy or not, we both need sleep first. I haven't gotten to fall asleep next to you in days. If you won't do it for you, do it for me."
"Ditto," Logan admitted with a chuckle. He ran a hand through Scott's wet hair, nuzzling at his stubbled throat. They were cuddling, he realized. It was a surreal epiphany, but one he enjoyed nonetheless. "I still remember wantin' to beat ya in a very different way."
Steve retrieved his shield and impulsively threw it at Loki, who was getting closer than was comfortable to Clint. Coulson had thrown aside his borrowed gun, and Steve suspected the long, improper storage had done nothing for whatever it ran on. The distraction proved exactly as ineffectual as he'd suspected. It took little more than a gesture for Loki to send the shield careening off into the shelves instead, but at least he looked away from Phil and Clint and over to him. "Miss me?"
"I'd like that. And I might have been lying about the poison. I'm fairly certain I wouldn't hurt you unless I absolutely had to." In fact, he was completely certain of that fact. More than once Phil had found himself feeling grateful that Natasha had been the one to confront Clint instead of him despite how poorly his own simultaneous plan had gone. "I meant it about being welcome here, though. You are. Not that I suspect you'll be terribly interested in hanging out and watching me read or watch television or catch up on paperwork, but... the offer stands just the same."
Tony heard the catch in Steve's voice, and he registered the blood draining out of the other man's face. "What... what is it?" He strained to see the image displayed on the phone, but only succeeded in making his current predicament that much worse. Tony groaned and let his aching head sink back. His brow remained furrowed between pain and concern as he prompted Steve, "Tell me... what did you see?"
Natasha snorted at that and gave a slight shake of her head. "Oh, Phil, if you're looking for practical, you have made some truly terrible life choices. What happened to you being the sane one?"
"Hey, the drape thing? That was my joke. Just puttin' that out there," Tony said, putting aside his touchpad. "I, for one, would give my eye teeth to personally watch you stab Loki in the face. A few of us would, actually." He gave Phil a meaningful look. "And, who knows? Maybe Asgardians are susceptible to adamantium poisoning."
Steeling himself, Logan reached down and grabbed a handful of Scott's hair. //Please have the fucking sense to keep your mouth shut//, he prayed, though half of him was hoping to be "forced" into a fight. He tipped the man's head up and had to struggle to keep his expression clinical. It was unsettling to see Scott's eyes in the first place, and even more unsettling to see the hopelessness in them.
"I'll do my best," was the best Bruce could offer. It was said in a way that made it clear he was going to stay up a week straight if he had to.
Logan's eyebrows raised, and he looked away and cleared his throat uneasily not because the idea of sleeping with Scott bothered him, but rather the exact opposite. Not wanting Scott to see it if he happened to get a bit of a flush going, he muttered at the floor, "Could be worse. I mean, you could wake up stabbin' people, right?" he asked, finally looking up with a wry grin. "I mean, I'm not a great cuddler, but at least I don't big the covers." //Annnnnd I could change the subject any second now...//
Sif squared her shoulders and tipped her head back. "Now." She surged forward without a word, kicking in the doors at the end of the hallway and taking in the scene in a heartbeat. Thankfully the long lull in activity had apparently made them all too comfortable. The lady's mutant captor sat on a couch just inside with Lady Frigga at the window toward the back of the room. Sif raised her sword, the hilt clutched tight in her hand. "It would be in your best interest to surrender at once."
Coulson wasn't sure how it happened, he just knew that one minute he was holding Natasha by the waist and the next he was watching her slip away to grab a cute blond girl who's been dancing close. It took all of two seconds before he found Clint's fingers looked into his belt and his own hands on Clint's waist. Just the feeling of holding him like that was enough to short circuit Phil's brain just a little, especially when coupled with the wicked gleam in the asset's eyes.
It was easier said than done. Darien's fingers wriggled, and he rocked on his heels, trying to keep still and quiet. "Read any good books lately?"
The feeling was mutual, although Loki was loathe to admit as much. He didn't need mortals. He didn't need anyone. He found himself understanding all too quickly, however, why Rogers was so attached to the man. As he truly began to move, Loki heard himself moaning as he found just the right angle. It was easy to pretend that he was simply using Stark for his own pleasure and a bit harder to believe as he strained to hear the same sort of sounds from Tony, as he idly reached up to flick the man's nipples and then bent to lick his neck.
Looking dazed and fascinated all at once, Clint offered his hand, looking for all the world like he was shaking hands with a real, live unicorn. "I... Uh... Barton. Hawkeye. Either way."
"We have a couple friends who need a hand too. Thor's would be preferred." Natasha smiled faintly and then followed Sif out onto a bridge that looked like it was made of light and air and echoed like it had metal running through it. She looked over to Bruce and raised an eyebrow. "So how are you liking alien worlds so far, Dr. Banner?"
Phil smiled back as though he hadn't seen Clint almost choke to death on a sip of coffee. "They do," he answered, nodding sagely. "Also boxers." He let that sink in for a moment, enjoying the way Clint turned a rather pretty shade of pink. Turnabout was fair play. "You'd be amazed by the things I have in my wardrobe, Barton. And my video library."
Tony flicked a quick look toward the bar just as Logan turned away from them and focused on one of the TV screens instead. He turned his attention back to Steve. "Doing fine. I'm making this up as I go, actually," he answered. A little trickle of sweat was running down the side of Steve's face, and Tony decided it was a *very* good look for the blonde. "So, he's not looking. Are you gonna kiss me, or am I gonna have to slip you a super-roofie?"
When Tony returned to Steve's room, he had changed into a fresh black T-shirt and a pair of sleep pants. He stepped inside and his gaze settled on the other man, deciding quickly that he had probably teased Steve enough for one day. Although Cap was an easy target, Tony found his naivete charming, and the two of them seemed to get along rather well when they weren't disagreeing. His eyes moved over Steve, taking in the way his borrowed clothes clung to his body. Tony felt a sharp rush of arousal at the enticing sight, and he once again found himself surprised over the effect Steve had on him. "Getting settled in?" he asked, crossing his arms and leaning against the door frame. "I hope you're gonna be happy here with me."
Logan was pretty sure that if he hadn't just taken his cigar out of his mouth to tell Stark to hurry up and finish talking, it would have fallen out. His next "What?" sounded less testy and more like he was sure he'd just started hallucinating.
Clint couldn't help the flush of shame in spite of Steve's reassurances. "Thanks." A beat. "I mean, for not... just, thanks." He was glad that Steve wasn't judging him, but that almost made it feel worse, in a way. He was pretty sure he could've handled Fury screaming at him better than Rogers' quiet forgiveness. Trying to focus on something else, Clint looked over the overwhelming display of foods - half of which he couldn't have guessed the identity of - before picking a quiche and some four cheese macaroni. It was a weird combination, weirder for his choice of coffee as a beverage, but it was food he recognized and that would contain the stuff he needed to keep training and fighting. As they settled at a table, Clint unrolled his silverware before deciding, "Best bet on curing Nat and the others is still gonna be turning Loki into a puddle of goo." He looked between Rogers and Coulson, eyes intense, even a little manic. "The hammer hurt him. Not just a little. I'm pretty damned sure I broke something. I don't know how long he'll take to grow it back, but if I can hurt a god, I can kill him."
Logan wasn't in the mood to let the two chit-chat. Pillow talk could wait. The mutant shoved Steve onto his back and pounced on him in one smooth motion, almost too fast for an ordinary person to track. Logan tangled one powerful hand into soft blonde hair and dragged Steve into a demanding kiss, holding back nothing as he ground himself against the taller man.
Tony propped his head up on one arm so he could look at Steve more easily. "I like how you think." He paused, brow furrowed. "Wait, does this mean we have to give Fury and Coulson a detailed report? I don't think they'd like that. ...or they'd like it too much. Not sure which." He thought for a moment. "Wonder how long they'd buy that I need 'bed rest'."
"Probably about as good as arrows. But Loki has a habit of bringing thuglettes with him, and those usually die pretty easy."
"I want to feel you," Steve groaned. He loved the look on Tony's face. That alone was worth the price of admission. Steve dragged the man down into another kiss. The heated embrace helped him to forget how odd it felt to be stretched open by Tony's finger. He shook off the tension and relaxed instead, opening himself up to the invasion. "Ready for more," he finally murmured against Tony's lips.
Tony froze as the implication settled in. He'd been throwing himself on Loki's whims to protect two men who were well beyond the god's reach. "You son of a bitch," he hissed, swallowing against sudden nausea. "You manipulative son of a bitch!" It was all Tony could do to restrain himself from hitting the god. He knew it would do no real damage. Something else occurred to him, then, and he felt the blood drain from his face as he sagged against the wall. "Guess that means you're done with me, then," he said, trying not to sound as hopeless as he felt. Loki had just given up his leverage over Tony, and the billionaire hadn't forgotten the god's promise to dispose of him once he was no longer useful.
"Just might have to keep things more NC-17 than X-rated tonight," Scott answered, letting Logan push his shirt up and off. He knew he looked like kind of a mess. He'd winced at the sight of himself in the mirror when he showered while Logan was still passed out on the bed. There was still a wealth of things they could do as long as he didn't let Logan get freaked out or pull away. "I'm fine. I've had a lot worse than this." Maybe not for worse reasons, but it was a mess for everyone. Feeling like it was probably better to get a lot of it out of the way at once, Scott unfastened his own pants and let them fall. With his boxer briefs hanging low on his hips, it was easy to see the finger-shaped bruises dotting the skin. Even Scott wasn't sure which bruises belonged to which man, and he didn't let himself think too much about it. He caught the look on Logan's face and swallowed. "If I should put my pants on and head back to my own room... I mean, I don't think anybody would blame you if this kills the mood."
"And we'll keep it that way," Bruce decided, putting a chip in his mouth and going back to his work.
Phil breathed carefully in and out through his nose. He wasn't going to think about it. He wasn't going to picture it. He definitely was not going to- He forced his grip on the wheel to ease, shoulders remaining immobile, relaxed. "That sounds like a good plan," Phil managed to answer in a tone so cool it was almost icy. It actually sounded horrible because he wasn't going to be able to stop thinking about it, but there was no getting around that part. The tower loomed, and Phil pulled gratefully into the darkness of the garage. "Have fun."
Even approaching Logan's cell made Steve nervous. The last time he'd seen the man, Logan had been a mess. He edged almost nervously over to the door. "Hey," he greeted softly, hopeful that he'd be talking to Logan and not some projection of Loki's into the man's mind.
“Let’s do that. Pizza or Chinese or… I don’t care. I care about the company, not the food.” Steve let his arm tighten for a moment around Tony’s waist as the credits rolled. He honestly hated for the night to end, but it was getting late. Things were going so well that he honestly felt like he was tempting fate. At any second, Steve was sure that somehow, some way it was all going to fall apart. He swallowed the thought down and smiled at Tony instead. “It’s not an exaggeration to say I’ll be counting the hours. Maybe we could meet up in the main kitchen for breakfast tomorrow?” He wondered if Tony would even be up for the possibility of seeing the rest of the team, but getting him out and about would make that feel normal again a lot more easily than hiding in the lab.
Natasha sighed. "Because this isn't going to be fun. Meetings are awful. Meetings about the future of the team in a situation like this..." The woman tried to put on a smile and mostly succeeded. "Just try not to make an ass out of yourself. I'd hate to have to break your shin under the table."
It was a long moment before Coulson found his voice. He knew it was shock, but the intellectual knowledge of that did very little to help. Honestly it was hard when he wanted to drift away. Losing touch with the world for awhile sounded like heaven. Finally Clint's hand on his arm came into focus along with the vibrant red of the chaffed skin, and he reached up, taking Clint's hand and realizing the tatters of his shirt were still hanging from his wrists. Phil elected to ignore them for the moment and clutched Clint's hand in his own shaking one. "Don't hurt yourself," he choked out. "He'll hurt both of us plenty. Don't hurt yourself, okay?"
Tony smirked, feeling a bit more in control as Steve rambled a little incoherently. He grabbed the blonde by the chin and pulled him into a brief, intense kiss before offering him a broad smirk. "I think you were saying you were going to lube me up and fuck me silly," he reminded the blonde, glancing at the man's lubed fingers. "Not that I don't appreciate you holding onto my ass like I'm your own personal call girl, but I'd love to take this to the next step," he quipped.
Clint shivered, watching Victor move back to Phil. Creed was right about that; he could see much, much more than he wanted to now. Unwilling to let it break him, he carefully caught Phil's gaze, hoping that the eye contact would give the man some reassurance.
Tony smiled. It was surprisingly rewarding to watch his lover devour the meal he'd made, simple as it was. He shrugged at Steve's question, hoping they could change the subject soon, before he got cornered into telling Steve Plan B. "Well, the gun already killed him once, and he didn't seem much worse for wear. Considering his personality, I think at this point he'd be more than willing to take one for the team. And the plan is to modify the old model to hurt a lot less." He was quiet for a moment. "Wish we could've had more time before. It might not have hurt you as badly if-"
The billionaire tried to keep some composure, but that just resulted in a would-be moan coming out as more of a pitiful, needy whimper when Steve filled him up perfectly. As Steve settled over him, he wrapped his arms around the blonde and marveled yet again at the man's strength and build. He knew Steve could break him in half without a thought, knew that it took Steve conscious effort to avoid hurting him. The feel of that restrained power against him was incredible, exhilarating, and reassuring. Tony leaned up and pressed his lips to Steve's throat, nuzzling the sweat-slick skin a moment later. He took a breath to speak, then stopped himself. //Little early for that kind of confession. And we've been dating, what? Two, three days? Yeah...// A shift on Steve's part served to send any further thoughts of romance crashing to the wayside as Tony lifted his hips and managed a breathy, "Ohfuckyes," in his partner's ear.
"Slept through my alarm," Tony explained quickly. He leaned up for a kiss, then paused and gave Steve a sheepish look. "Sorry. Okay, to be honest, I got caught up analyzing the molecular decay of a couple of samples of that chitauri ore we recovered and there were some isotopes-" He cut himself off when Steve gave him that 'speak English' look he knew so well. Instead, he went with his previously intended action and stole a quick kiss from the other man. "Sorry."
Logan looked skeptical, but nodded slowly. "So, then, what's with the accessory?" When he didn't immediately get an answer, the feral mutant gestured to the door. "Your pet archer. Is he here to help with the coursework, too? Or just stickin' around to find evidence o' me havin' the same kinda crazy he did?"
Though Loki's lip curled in distaste, he didn't bother countering the words. The longer it all drew on, the more tired he felt. Being locked in a cell with no company but some books and the howls of other inmates had been hell. As it turned out, his stronghold on Midgard was simply another sort of a cell with another sort of inmate. "Perhaps not," he almost whispered, gaze dropping to the bed as he considered that idea. "Perhaps this is all pointless. Perhaps that doesn't matter. I think that you and I both know there are only so many ways for this to end. None of them are particularly favorable for me, so it seems in my best interest to enjoy the things I can while I'm still able to do so. Good company, for example."
"Shut up," the burly man grated out. His accent was heavy, and Darien had no idea whether it was Russian or German or just really terrible English. "Quiet. No move."
Tony pointedly leaned forward over the table to get a good look at Scott, then sat back up to look at Logan, his expression making it clear he had all kinds of things to say about his assumptions.
Tony shrugged even as he somehow managed to keep dancing and edge a little closer. "Y'know, I've pissed off far scarier people... things... and lived. I'll be fine," Tony assured, briefly wondering how true that was. It was hard to get too worried with Steve so close. Truth be told, Tony had been eyeballing the tall blonde for awhile, but something had always held him back. Tony was too impulsive to worry about mixing business with pleasure, but when it came to catching feelings, he had a tendency to be slightly more cautious. "I think as long as I don't punch a baby in front of him, I'll be fine."
Sparks flew as Creed's razor claws crashed against Steve's shield with bone-crushing force. He could smell blood, knew he'd wounded the man. He roared with the sheer thrill of battle, of finding a worthy opponent. He parried one of Steve's blows, absorbed another, feinted, and managed to knock the soldier's shield aside. His arm swung in a wide arc, claws brought to bear for the man's exposed gut, when a blast from one of Iron Man's hand thrusters knocked him away.
Steve couldn't even understand the techno-babble Tony was spouting even in the humor-laced introduction. It didn't matter. He'd been flattered to be asked to attend for the opening anyway, not to mention too speechless to say no when Tony had asked him. Tony had been fresh from bed wearing nothing but sleep pants and tousled hair. Steve had actually said yes before he was even quite sure what he was being asked. By the time he'd figured it out, Tony had already been instructing him on what time Happy would bring the car around to pick them up.
"As I'll ever be," Coulson agreed. He'd grabbed the shirt as a joke, but as he'd gotten dressed, it had started seeming maybe a little stupid. He'd gone from internally amused to intimidated and made a quick pass around trying to grab something else and change before he embraced the situation. Thankfully Clint had taken it in the spirit in which it was intended. There was no sense in grabbing Lola as much as he liked the idea of taking her out. Instead Phil settled for strolling side by side next to Clint, hands shoved in his pockets, enjoying the nice day. He'd ditched his contacts and pulled his glasses from his back pocket as they approached the theater. "Sorry, I know they're not exactly fashion forward, but considering how little sleep I've gotten, dry eyes are not my friend."
"Right. Yeah, on it," Steve answered with a flicker of a smile. Strong, sure fingers were soon scissoring Tony open, testing the waters for what was to come. He knew Tony could take every last inch, but he wanted it to feel as amazing for Tony as it would for him. With every twitch of Tony's ass around his fingers, Steve grew harder and subsequently more desperate. "You wanna be on top?" There was something to be said for not trying to cram themselves into an even more awkward position in the car, but Steve didn't really care how they proceeded as long as they did. The need to take instead of tease had grown overwhelming.
It was obvious that Logan could wait no longer. "Now," Scott managed in a husky groan. He didn't care anymore if it hurt, he just needed to feel how much Logan wanted him. He jerked Logan's head up to force the man to look at him. "Do it."
Clint felt a twinge of satisfaction at the praise, but he knew better than to make too much of a show of it. Instead, he flicked his intense blue eyes up at her as he nipped at the inside of her thigh in mock defiance. He then kissed his way back to her waiting heat, his tongue shoving aside the scant fabric of her thong and slowly teasing at her entrance. His fingers remained tangled in the waistband of the panties, and after several moments he tugged down, settling back on his knees for a moment as he helped her slide one leg from the undergarment. He wasted little time in resettling between Nat's thighs, his tongue dragging over her outer lips before slowly delving between them and dragging over her clit.
"We're counting on it," Fury agreed. "Summers, you willing to stay behind to coordinate with the X-Men?"
"D-don't stop on my account," Scott stammered. He could only sink into the couch at first. His body refused to do anything at all but enjoy how it felt to have Logan inside him once and for all, to feel his lover going deeper with each passing moment. Scott recovered at last and lifted his legs to wrap around Logan's hips. "Ohhh, fuck I love that feeling." Nothing he'd ever felt quite compared to those first seconds of burning pleasure when Logan bottomed out inside him. "I think we need to schedule a standing meeting to do this every single day."
Tony had to work hard to focus on Steve's words as the man worked a spot the man hadn't even known was a weakness until that moment. He squirmed between the tiled wall and his lover, making soft whimpering sounds that were borderline undignified. "Glad it helped," he managed, tilting his head so the water was no longer running down his face, though it had already done its job plastering dark curls to his forehead. "Wanted to make sure you... mm... had something in case the serum... was a bust. Or I didn't come back." He gasped and arched as Steve's teeth raked perfectly over the sensitive spot. "Wanted you safe."
"This feels perfect," Phil agreed, surprised at how much having Clint lying against him centered his whole being. It wasn't something he'd let himself hope for, but he realized in that moment how many sleepless nights could have been saved with the simple reassurance. Clint's presence reminded him that the man was safe and sound, was warm and alive against him. He let his eyes fall closed and felt sleep slowly beginning to call. "Could definitely get used to this," he murmured, already drifting as he wrapped an arm around Clint's muscular back.
"You pathetic fools!" Loki spat, his voice vibrating with rage. The ridiculous-looking gun that Logan wielded was surprisingly painful. He felt strange, almost feverish. He wasn't leaving without Tony Stark, and the man in question seemed to be holding back. Apparently they thought that the stupid gun would be enough to kill him. Loki glared hard at Logan and stepped in closer. "I think, my friend, that you will be killed by your idiotic toy long before I am."
Natasha shrugged. "Not yet. Something tells me necks break the same way in Asgard." She smiled in a rather off-putting way at Bruce only to turn at the sound of steps behind them.
"Of course," Simmons answered with the same smile, at once grateful for and nervous about Bruce's presence. She hated putting him in deliberately stressful situations considering what that did to his equilibrium, but it could hardly be helped. Nervously she began taking readings while Clint stared at her like he expected her to snatch the hammer away. That was the very last thing in the world she wanted.
The idea was enough to make Phil's heart skip a beat, and he couldn't resist reaching for Clint's free hand. "What happens in my locked office on our lunch breaks is no one's business but ours," he assured firmly. "I'm not planning on hiding this from anyone, either. I'm going to file the paperwork, Fury will know. I just have to keep some boundaries in place. That's more about me than the rules. I know my limits, and I know that I'm already prone to being a little more forgiving than I should be with you and Natasha as it is." It had never been easy to stay mad at Clint long. All it took was a few days of the man slinking around giving him hurt puppy looks and bringing him coffee quietly in the mornings and Phil tended to forget why he'd been angry to start with. Hoping to take some of the sting out of the idea of keeping things handler and asset during the long days in the office, Phil allowed, "I'll even get a better lock for the door. Promise."
Tony's HUD quickly told him just how many mutants were there on Loki's side. "Maybe we should've invited the X-Men," he muttered to Logan, who was already shouldering the gun and moving for a better angle. To Loki, Tony shot back, "Not a bad entrance. But you left a better impression at the tower." He smirked at the god as the Hulk edged closer.
"Else? There's an else?" Coulson tried very, very hard to remember anything else that he might have said or done in Natasha's presence that required additional information being passed on to Clint. He was worrying so much about it that he didn't even realize how well it was distracting him from freaking out about everything else. Suddenly whatever had brought him back wasn't the center of his universe. Clint and Natasha and a growing sense of horror were. "Maybe we should pretend there's not one?"
Natasha stretched, forcing herself to be entirely casual about the matter. "Just an old piece of garbage that needs to be taken out again." Her gaze cut to Clint, checking his face and seeing him looking like he was going to throw up. "Wipe down, put clothes on. I'm not in the mood to have my city broken again." Nat looked over at Darien, appraising how quickly he'd gotten himself together and nodded her approval. "You too. If you're going to join us, you may as well start now."
"You won't miss them. You've got plenty. You're the smartest guy in the room, and it doesn't even matter what room were talking about." Steve tucked himself in against Tony's side and made a pleased noise. "I was kind of worried we wouldn't fit together anymore," he confessed quietly, "that laying together and holding hands and kissing would feel wrong. Still just feels like us, though."
Phil froze when he got close enough to see Clint and Darien's legs tangled together on the floor. Without seeing more, he had no idea just what was going on, but he knew it didn’t invite extra company. "Sorry. Coffee run. I'll... come back later."
Tony rubbed at his wrists, wondering just what that might mean. Deciding to test the waters, he stood, swaying a little, his hand pressed against the nearest solid object. "Well, I'm sure it'll grow back. People like you have a tendency to do that when you're not killed thoroughly," he observed, feeling a little breathless as he worked to hold himself upright. It wasn't as tough as he expected, but it still wasn't a world of fun. "Good to know I didn't skip hours of sleep and sex with my boyfriend with nothing to show for it."
The Soldier held up his hands, stepping back as quickly as possible given the situation. He opened his mouth to speak, but an arrow laced with drugs slammed into his shoulder and sent him to the ground before he said anything at all.
Steve just grinned as Pepper held the finger up the rest of the way out the door and closed it soundly behind her. He burst out laughing the second she was gone.
"Great. We should hang out," Logan said, grabbing his clothes from the bedroom and wadding them up under his arm. "I'm packed. Let's get outta here before Stark remembers where the bar is."
Thankful that he wasn't quite as pure and innocent as his friends seemed to think he was, Steve forced his eyes open so he didn't miss a thing. Any blushing virgin would have been finished already, and after a long - decades long, he supposed - dry spell, Steve was proud of himself for holding out so well. Keeping his pace achingly slow helped. It also drew out the pleasure of Tony's muscles rippling around him. "You're beautiful," he whispered, the words slipping out before he could think that they might be the wrong thing to say.
"You have to try the pumpkin," Simmons insisted, stepping up to the counter and ordering for both of them without thinking. She did it most of the time, making coffee runs for herself and Fitz, and only afterward realized it might be a bit pushy. "Sorry. Habit. Bad habit, probably. It's actually been... well, since I got out of the academy, I haven't had much time for dating. SHIELD is rather all encompassing, I find." Normally she absolutely adored the challenge of being presented with one truly impossible puzzle after another, but there were days when Simmons wondered how she was supposed to make a life of her own when it seemed that SHIELD owned every inch of her.
Tony wasn't about to. He slowly licked his way in deeper, tongue thrusting slowly into Steve's hole. His fingers kneaded the blonde's ass as he worked, and he became completely focused on the shift of Steve's hips, the incredible sounds of arousal he made as Tony worked him open. Tony’s fingers grazed lightly over Steve's balls, his cock, teasing without providing any relief as he focused on all the little shifts and motions that made Steve gasp. He wanted to see how much it would take to make his lover beg, and he was pretty sure that as long as Steve kept making those sounds of pleasure, Tony could wait as long as he needed to.
Loki cast about, trying to think of something, and finally looking up at Clint and Coulson with a flicker of something in his eyes. "Stark mentioned that you don't remember how it is that you're alive, Agent Coulson." He waited until the man nodded tightly and didn't miss the glare that Coulson sent Tony's way. "I cannot change the fact that I was responsible for your death, but I can give you back the memory of what happened. I can open that door for you." It would be easy, really, if he had the permission to do so. If Coulson would let him in, it was a simple task and something he could give as a show of good faith.
Logan pressed his lips to Scott's throat, his hand cupping the man's face as he nuzzled his cheek. "All I could think o' was what they'd do to you if they decided you were too dangerous," he said. "S'why I had to tell you I loved you through Steve. Wasn't sure I'd get to tell you in person," he admitted softly, brushing his lips softly to Scott's.
Clint had opened his mouth to spout off a comeback when the mutant disappeared in a flash of light. "Shit." He glanced around at their surroundings. "I hope this is just a shitty corner of El Paso," he muttered. It was frightening to be left without any resources in the wild, but at least it was a situation they had some control over. They had some hope of being able to do something to take care of themselves. He glanced at Phil. "Any ideas?"
The archer was skilled in hand-to-hand, nimble and lightning-fast. The problem was, he had no real way to hurt Victor. Even with the man in a sleeper hold, Victor's throat lodged firmly between his bicep and forearm, he could feel himself losing. When Victor's adamantium-laced skull snapped back into Clint's forehead, the man dropped like a fly, his ears ringing as spots floated in his vision.
Loki didn't bother to reply. He simply shifted to hover for a moment above Stark, their eyes locked before he began to lower himself. At first he let Stark feel only the possibility but then put more weight behind the movement and sank slowly down. The muscles of his thighs strained as he kept the motion as slow as possible. His own body rebelled against the pace, begging for more, wanting to take it all. Finally Loki relented for the sake of his own sanity - or whatever was left of it - and let his hips come to rest against Tony's with a sharp gasp. Loki's nails raked across Stark's chest and his muscles clenched around the mortal's cock as he found himself finally filled.
Tony almost immediately forgot about Logan pushing him around when Steve's mouth closed over his cock. He let out a long, hissing breath and allowed his head to thump back against the headboard. Regaining his composure a little, he lifted it again and groaned as he watched the beautiful blonde's lips slide along the length of his overheated cock. His fingers tangled in silky hair as he thrust into Steve's hot mouth.
Logan couldn't help a faint smile at the thought. Imagining Steve with a laptop was amusing enough. Imagining him on his own with a bunch of Tony's robots was simultaneously sad and amusing, and Logan settled for nodding sympathetically. "You look like you're feelin' better," he remarked as gently as he knew how. "It'll be good to have you back on the team. Hopefully in the lead," he added before taking a bite of food.
Coulson barely resisted the urge to kick the hammer as far away from Clint as he could. It would've been childish, though possibly not an overreaction. Hoping to make up for the probably unwanted contact before, he whispered softly to Clint, "I can't risk losing you again. This thing? It scares me. We both know not a lot of things scare me."
Phil knew it was silly to be huddled so closely together when they were already baking, but he didn't want to let go. He needed to hold fast to Clint and feel the steady beat of the man's heart. It made their escape feel more real. Much as Phil wanted to murmur a million different things he'd be embarrassed about later, he settled for silence and feeling Clint against him and knowing that somehow, when they woke up, they were going to get home and be just fine.
Logan was pretty sure the look of horror on Thor's face was the worst thing he'd seen in recent memory. And that was saying something.
He did, slow in and then out again until he felt weak but no longer in danger of actually collapsing. "I'm okay."
"You will," Scott answered with a flicker of a smile. Logan was more the hero than he pretended to be. If he hadn't been, Scott might never have thought twice about Jean walking away. Unfortunately Logan wasn't quite the loner he pretended to be. Underneath his prickly exterior, he cared. He wasn't a cuddly teddy bear, but he was a good man. That was what had made him dangerous. Jean saw that goodness as clearly as anyone - maybe more clearly than anyone but Rogue. "There are worse things to do with your time. I think over the past few weeks I've done most of them."
Worked up as they both were, Scott wasn't far behind, his cock pulsing between them. He knew that by the afternoon, he'd feel enough soreness to regret the choice to some degree. In the moment he just felt sated. "Let's go lay down. Don't hafta sleep, but I think we're both going to lose feeling in our extremities if we try to stay like this." Carefully he unwrapped his legs from Logan's thighs and gingerly stepped into the bedroom. "Actually... shower. Shower, then bed. You want to join me?"
Tony grabbed Steve and pulled the larger man up against himself, heedless of the fact that the blonde was probably a little too heavy to comfortably support. //Worth it even if my arm does fall asleep.// He gently ran his fingers through Steve's hair, smiling at him in a way that was a little uncharacteristically warm. "That was good," he decided, pretty sure he could hear Logan rolling his eyes beside them.
"Bribery. Excellent." Tony stood and gingerly pulled on a baggy t-shirt with Steve’s help. "Shall we?"
Sif took the suggestion in stride. "It is a plan as good as any we have yet made." She led them carefully into the palace. As promised, there were enough guards aiding in their entry that it was a relatively simple task to get inside. A good way down from the lady's chambers, Sif turned to them. "Magneto will be with her. He will be ready. We must be as well. On my mark, we shall advance into the room. He must be restrained at once. The lady may well be able to assist us with her own skills if she is well and whole enough to do so."
Clint tensed and, for a split second, moved as if to grab the bow that wasn't on his back. He let out a breath at the sight of Natasha, straightening as he tilted his head. "Nat," he said tensely. He felt the slightest twinge of unease and did his best to hide it. Anyone that knew him as well as Nat did would have been hard put to miss the flash of emotion. His 'relationship' with her wasn't anything like serious, much as he'd have liked it to be, but he couldn't help but feel faintly guilty every time she caught him with someone else. He could see the amusement on her face and did a valiant job of collecting himself. "Not any later than usual. Hoping for a 'nightcap'?"
Just thinking about it set Steve’s blood pressure on the rise. He needed to know Tony was okay. The best he could get were vague assurances from other people. He’d learned through constantly hounding the team and Coulson that Tony wasn’t really talking to anyone. Only Coulson showed much open concern for the fact, but even he gently urged Steve to give the man space. So Steve gave Tony space. He moved his things without their exchanging so much as a word, and he ached to know what was happening inside the man’s head. After growing so unexpectedly close to the billionaire, Steve found the sudden freeze out intolerable.
The archer had the decency to blush, worrying the bag of chips in his hands. "Uh, thanks." He was surprised the woman didn't want to know what had happened to them, but then if she'd seen Coulson in action, she'd probably already assumed it was something utterly insane.
Clint looked to his companion, still chewing the last of his food. "It's alright. I think we're all a little on edge," he said, finishing off his coffee. His mind flashed back to their light-hearted banter earlier that morning, and he found himself wishing he could get back to that level of relaxation. "You really think we'll be able to fix them? Summers and Logan?" While Nat seemed miserable, she otherwise seemed to be herself. The other two, though...
Tony grinned as Logan made a small sound of arousal. Or maybe it was a warning growl. Tony really wasn't going anywhere, either way. "Time to get those instincts revved up, eh, Cap?" His gaze met Steve's, and he gave the blonde his best seductive grin as he leaned in to nip at Logan's neck. If Tony were honest with himself, he knew he couldn't possibly withstand an unbridled fucking from either of the two men, but that just made it more interesting.
Logan rumbled his agreement. "Yeah, I think I'd rather roll around with ya naked," he said, then winked. "Though the hate-sex could've been great." It was strange to think he'd hated Scott so much, even knowing that Scott had stood between him and having a chance at Jean. It was a strange comfort to have the man pressed against him now, though. Scott reminded him of all the good things he'd had at the school without reminding him of the painful memories that had driven him away.
"This is the closest you'll ever come to being with him again. Are you sure you want to turn your back on the chance?" It was easy to see how deeply the illusion affected Tony, how it cut him. Apparently he'd gotten something wrong, some detail that gave it away. That was no matter. Reaching out and still speaking in Steve's gentle voice, Loki pressed, "This could be seen as a gift. I thought it might be easier on you this way." That was only half true. He'd also rather relished the thought of Tony giving himself over willingly - losing himself in the fantasy enough to truly enjoy it.
Steve couldn’t remember ever having spent quite so much time staring at his closet. He made it a point to look nice whenever possible, but it was different wanting to look good but not too good, casual but not too casual. Finally Steve chose a pair of dark jeans that Natasha had insisted he buy in the store in addition to his usual slacks and paired it with a blue button down. Knots of nervous energy twisted in his stomach, but Steve made his way to the kitchen on mostly steady legs. Finding it still empty, Steve took a moment to start getting some ingredients together. The more he had to do, the less he would think of how terrified he was that Tony might not even show up.
Mystique glared at the blue-furred mutant and was drawing her other leg back to kick him in the face when it was suddenly caught in a tight grip. She looked up to see May gazing back impassively. "Who the hell are you?"
"Sounds like the most beautiful case of indigestion ever thought of," Clint decided, though he was unable to convince himself to stand up and actually pull away from the hands roaming over his body. The touches kindled just the perfect hum of low-grade arousal in him, and he was pretty sure he wanted to stay that way until the sun went down. "I don't know... food and beer are up there on my priorities list, but I think I'd do about anything for you to keep touching me," he murmured, his voice relaxed and thick.
"You will. We all will." Coulson met the man's gaze and tried to smile. "Right now, you need to rest and warm up. Then we all move in together on this. We don't have a direction yet. The second I know anything, you’ll know it too."
Phil couldn't resist the silent urging. He put a hand on the back of Clint's head, and together they found a slow, steady rhythm. He knew better than to be rough, knew he wasn't going to last anyway. It was so fucking good he was holding on only by the skin of his teeth to begin with. "You look so fucking sexy right now... fuck, Clint..." Holding onto Clint was ultimately as much to steady himself as to guide the pace. "It's... won't be long," he admitted. Just watching Clint taking every last damn inch he could was almost enough to make him lose it alone, nevermind the spectacular feeling of Clint's throat closing in tightly around him.
"Alive," Scott answered. His tone was dull. He couldn't help sounding and feeling defeated. They were, honestly. "He took Tony."
Natasha emerged from the bathroom wearing a camisole top and sleep pants. She smiled at the smell of popcorn and the sight of Clint waiting patiently for it to finish popping. She grabbed them a couple of sodas from the fridge knowing neither of them would stay awake through more than five minutes of the movie otherwise. They were too fried. Nat stretched, rolled her head on her neck to work out the kinks, and grabbed a bowl. "Toss the popcorn in here and let's do this." Soon enough they were curling up on the couch side by side. It was a different sort of intimate than their usual encounters, but not in a bad way. As the movie began and they took to sipping soda and eating popcorn like they were teenagers instead of covert agents for a powerful government agency, Natasha couldn't help but ask, "So what were you and Phil up to this morning?"
"No. Thank you, Agent Ward. We'll be fine." Phil frankly felt dead on his feet and he hadn't even gotten on his feet yet, but he wasn't interested in company. He suspected that as word filtered through the team that they were back, they'd have plenty of that. He winced at the thought of a debriefing after the exam but doubted he could shake Fury long enough to avoid it. Maybe he could at least get Clint out of it so the archer could get a little rest.
Logan felt the shift in Scott's tension right before Scott's body bucked underneath him. Scott's clenching muscles were almost enough to send him over the edge, but he managed to watch Scott ride out most of his orgasm before he came with a deep growl of pleasure. He gasped out Scott's name as he spilled himself deep inside his lover, burying his face in Scott's neck and placing one more bite on the man's skin. He held Scott close to his body as the man trembled in the aftermath, relishing the feeling of Scott's body, completely undone, twitching against him.
"And Loki might have it soon." Steve felt a chill run down his spine at the idea. "And we don't know where he is. And he has Nat." Though Steve sounded calm, he felt anything but. He felt like he needed to sprint somewhere and make something happen, but there was nothing to do. There were no races to run. They simply didn't know what they needed to know to find Loki. He let out a slow breath and settled in next to Tony again. "I hope Fury knows where the damn thing is." At least then they could head Loki off at the pass and maybe have a chance at stopping him.
"Shit," Logan muttered, moving to try and get a clear shot. "So much for the easy shot." He found himself wishing he was more of a marksman. The gun wasn't exactly something you could take to the gun range. Logan managed to get what felt like a steady shot, and the beam landed a decent glancing blow. Logan grunted as his vision blurred for a moment and the weapon weighed a little heavier on his shoulder. "Stark, that didn't work. And I think I've got two more shots left. Maybe."
Steve couldn't help but smile as he watched Logan settle in as well. As the muscular mutant began to explore Tony's cock, Steve carefully slid another finger home. He gave the billionaire a moment to adjust to the invasion before twisting the digits and spreading them. He loved watching Tony's face flush and hearing the way his breath hitched. It was something he'd worried about before when he had found himself having distinctly more-than-friendly thoughts about his friend: how easily he could become addicted to those sounds and sights. With the exception of his brief relationship with Pepper, Tony wasn't exactly known for repeat performances. Steve wasn't sure he could stand this being a one time only deal. He squelched the fear in favor of enjoying the now and bent over to press a kiss to Logan's shoulder as the man leaned toward Tony.
Before he had the chance to ask more, the door opened a sliver and Bruce stuck his head in. “Sorry to interrupt. Mr. Barnes, you do need your rest. Maybe a couple hours of sleep and then some visiting hours? The stuff that’s washing you out’ll hit pretty hard soon. You’re probably going to sleep whether you want to or not.”
Natasha could feel Logan swelling until he was painfully hard in her mouth. Heedless of Logan's grip on her hair, she drew back and grinned wickedly up at the man. "Do you want to get him ready, or should I?" she purred. Natasha definitely didn't want to disrupt their rhythm, but she couldn't deny that she wanted another chance to get her hands all over Scott too.
Though there had been a flash of discomfort, Phil shook his head. "No." Whether it hurt or not on a physical level, the affection and Clint's gentle touch soothed him more than anything else in the world could have. "This is good. I wish you weren't here, but only because..." Because he wasn't sure he could handle Creed turning his attention to Clint. He wasn't sure he could handle seeing it or hearing it or knowing that he couldn't stop it. Instead of panicking, Phil drew Clint into a careful hug. Creed already knew how they felt, and he was going to use it. There wasn't any point in hiding. Phil wanted every last bit of comfort they could draw in the meantime. "This helps. Knowing you still want to do this helps."
"I agree," Tony said, pressing another kiss to Steve's lips, then down his jawline. "In fact," he said between kisses, "I think you could use a few more." Before Steve could protest, Tony was sucking and biting at a spot on his lover's neck, just below the jawline. Tony knew he really should have been getting ready to go to the lab, but he was pretty damn sure that the simulations they'd set up the night before could run themselves for awhile longer. That, and the fact that Bruce would probably have Jarvis harass him out of his room if they really needed him.
"A suit?" Thor echoed incredulously. He gave the table a thump, making the food and trays on it jump. "Glorious! You shall do great honor unto the Man of Iron's memory!"
Clint picked at the food, taking solace in the friendship surrounding him, even though he wasn't participating directly. It still felt good to have everyone together. He glanced at Phil, reassuring himself of the man's presence.
Tony was certainly enjoying the deception. His legs rose to wrap around Loki's waist as if trying to pull him deeper. The rough entry had hurt, but Tony couldn't bring himself to care. It felt too good, too comforting, and he wasn't about to complain. "Fuck yes, baby," he murmured, lightly nipping at the god's throat as he arched underneath his captor. "Fuck... feels so good... Love you so much..."
Hulk flung a few more guards into a pillar, stomping at another group as they tried to get out of his way and leaving a good dent in the stonework floor. He caught another guard by the ankle and used him to as a weapon to knock over another half dozen armored figures. Hulk had managed to swing the man at the floor a few times before a shout rang out. "Puny gods!"
Steve was watching both of them closely and carefully interjected, "I think it's best that anyone we have guarding it be changed out pretty regularly. Same for the people working with it. If it's this powerful, we shouldn't take chances. The team's thin enough, Barton. I need you on reserve, not guard duty." He looked back to Bruce. "Tony's always up for talking... and working more than he should. Just help me keep an eye out for when he needs to stop and rest, okay? He won't do it on his own."
"Someone has to," Steve agreed. They were doing something entirely new. He was intensely grateful to be doing that thing with Tony by his side. He needed that sure, comforting familiarity to keep hold of himself. Steve let his gaze stray to the nearest clock on the wall and groaned, his arms tightening around Tony's neck. "I have to let you go soon." His voice dropped, and he leaned in to whisper the rest in Tony's ear, "If you still want to keep that promise from the other night... we can maybe see what we've got time for tonight." The situation had changed and so had the playing field, but Steve found himself hoping that Tony might still be up for trying something new.
"You're honestly doing brilliantly. Still a good deal of weight and a few inches to put on, of course, but, Captain, you're very nearly normalized." Simmons was beaming at the man as she spoke and offered a soft smile to Tony as well. "I think you're well on the road to recovery. Give it another day or two, and I don't think anyone will have any idea this ever happened.
Logan did and didn't all at once. SHIELD probably would want to know, and Logan figured it would be easier for Scott to tell him than someone like Coulson. He nodded. "I do," he said as gently as he knew how. Scott somehow looked even more vulnerable in the oversized clothing than he had wearing only underwear, and Logan found himself wishing he could comfort the man a little. The feral mutant doubted that Scott would find any comfort in anything Logan had to offer. Except... //Almost forgot.// Reaching into his bag, he pulled out a small case, opened it, and passed Scott a set of ruby-tinted sunglasses. "Here. For whenever you're ready to get some sun again."
Logan smirked. "So, a guy with a metal skeleton against a guy that controls metal. Round two, matter o' fact," he observed. He gave Bruce a shrug. "Well, I guess you can do the whole smash thing if it comes right down to it."
