There was that sigh again. But at least he could hear a smile.
Tony’s stomach whirled dramatically as his mind raced, but Coulson had already moved on to the next table.  “Justin, hand it over.  No phones at lunch; you know the rules.”
“Iron Man was valiant and brave today, as he always is. I should like that to go into our team records,” Thor declared. He tucked a strand of hair behind his ear.
He sees Steve’s eyes widen as he understands, sees his eyes find the folded material on the workbench.  Then his jaw sets, stubborn. “The workshop is yours.  It’s.  You feel safe here.  I won’t take that from you.”
She swore, angrily. “Steve, I’m getting him back on that list. I’m not leaving until I find someone who can make it happen.  You know I don’t care. You know I love him, arm or no arm. But I will not let him get shunted aside by someone who doesn’t know what he’s been through.”
What exactly did Stern want with Steve, anyway? Well.  Maybe Tony couldn’t take back his crass actions in the limo.  Maybe he couldn’t erase the time Steve had spent playing his assistant.  But he could protect him from whatever Stern wanted. Probably. Men like Stern, like Howard, they understood money and power and threats.  They had to be bullied, or bribed.  Tony had years of practice playing this game, and Tony had learned from the best—Howard had been better at it than this orange buffoon.  Howard had been better at it than nearly anyone. And he was, he thought acidly, his father’s son.  He could see it tonight.  Wouldn’t Howard be proud? Tony fought the queasiness, the nausea.
, according to Happy) was waiting to get them home.
He actually did remember this exact day.  He had turned sixteen a month before.  Maybe a little less. Tony’d just met Rhodey, who knew he was going to be Air Force no matter what, and was already looking at areas where he would be likely involved in conflict.  Not surprisingly, the Middle East was a hot zone.  They’d been debating how to solve issues, like the two semi-idealistic, half-drunk, very narcissistic idiots that they were.  Rhodey had brought up the example of post-WWI Germany as compared to post-WWII Japan, building a case for providing education and infrastructure as a low-cost way to avoid future conflicts.  Eventually, drunk off their asses and sitting on the floor of the dorm, they’d cobbled together a proposal, sent it to Howard, and finished off the rest of the single malt.
Most of it was Howard’s work, clear annotations in his cramped, capital letters.  There were a few memos, from Stern, Erskine, and a Commander Phillips, apparently the head of this military experiment, arguing back and forth over the rights they would have over the test subject once he had undergone the procedure. Howard claimed he should have experimental rights and all patents.  That anything the test subject did post-test would fall under his purview since the experiment would never take place without using his facility. And those Vita Rays were his, too.  Phillips argued that the military didn’t actually want to be involved at all, unless the procedure could be given to a test subject of his choice, saying he hadn’t wasted his political capital on “that skinny little gerbil, Rogers.” Idiot. Stern laid claim to the test subject indefinitely on the basis that he had secured the exemptions on human experimentation.  But to each of these, Erskine responded with absolute denial.  He wouldn’t give his formulae, he wouldn’t contribute his singular expertise, unless the subject was released after he’d served his time in the army.  He backed his stance with the Geneva Conventions, Human Rights conventions, and his personal experience, he said, in Nazi Germany.  And there it was: a contract, signed by all of them—Steve too, giving the subject freedom after one term of military service. Magically forgotten in Howard’s safe, hidden from the public.
This time Steve laughed.  “Not getting any less weird.”
It’s all he wanted, after all, lying here, with Tony, completely honest, completely known, completely loved, in the light of his own personal sun.
“So Tones, what possessed you to kidnap a giant, huh?” Rhodes asked.  Behind him, Steve came down the stairs, carrying what looked like a pitcher of that lemonade. Rhodey tracked Tony’s eyes, turning around to see what had caught his attention. “Oh, nevermind.  I know exactly what possessed you. Tall, blonde, and built, huh?”
The next morning, Steve had coffee ready for Tony at his door, like normal.  Steve liked working for Tony.  He helped. He had little routines, orderly, like this one. Tony was a little sluggish, not surprising for the night he’d had.  He forgot to pull on his pajama top, and just threw on a robe to answer the door.  It fell open when he grabbed for his coffee.
So you’re a senior, huh? Me too.  Last Halloween here, and Shield kids always go all out.  What are you going to be for this, your final year? Big decision, right?
“Alright, Ken doll,” Tony said, noting how Steve winced a bit at the name.  Not comfy with the looks then. Weird, considering he’d won the genetic lottery somehow. “Start now.  I’ll have Happy bring the bike into the garage when he comes back.  Find you a room somewhere.”
“Sir, I thank you for the rescue,” she told him, voice ringing, mellow and sweet.
“That’s not how it felt,” Tony says. He feels gutted.
“Do not be wroth with Lady Sif,” Thor counseled Tony.  “It was not her doing. She is only here to retrieve him.”
Steve weighed the odds.  Tony wouldn’t thank Steve for breaking in and disrupting the mood if he had a guest in there, and Steve really didn’t want to walk in on him with someone else.  The thought of it physically pained him, although Tony could have anyone he wanted, and Steve really needed to face up to facts.  On the other hand, if he was under attack, he sounded like he could use some help.  And if it was just music, well, he could take the opportunity to tease Steve some more. He sort of liked having that, anyway, it was like having an inside joke with him.  Yep, he was fully aware of just how pathetic that sounded.
“So you wanna talk about your boy?”
“And Howard—”
“I’m sorry,” Steve says. Like he’d said in the letter. “I’m sorry I didn’t tell you. I didn’t mean to lie to you. I thought I’d have more time, so I could figure out how.”
Tony put the faceplate up. There was a smudge of grease on one eyebrow. “I don’t know,” was all he said.
Tony blushed, looking at the screen.  Jesus.  He was blushing from reading words.  Just words.  Not even porn or anything, just knowing that Flying thought about him.  “a lot.” And he signed it, “Love.”
“--be on a team with Hammer,” the others chimed in, even Natasha. She already hated the slick git.
“After your shower. You don’t want to welcome Natasha home smelling like that.”
Batroc held up a finger, telling Steve he’d be back in a minute.  Steve could still hear a one-sided conversation, voice low but, of course, Batroc also had nothing to hide from him. He scanned what he could see of the office in front of him.  The mobile phone on the desk, a second on a shelf behind him next to a photo of Batroc on a beautiful yacht off the coast of Monaco.
“Haha, it’s okay, Shell, I didn’t think you were rude.
“Ah, Tony,” Dr. Selvig said, motioning him forward.  “Mr. Rhodes, Miss Potts.”
Tony grinned. “That means we can have sex, right? Cause I gotta tell you, I’ve been dying to see what you’ve got down there.” He hooked Steve with his ankle and flipped them. “I told you,” he said smugly, pulling Steve’s pants off.  “Well, hello there,” he purred, looking positively gleeful to get his hands on Steve’s dick. Or, his mouth, anyway.  He kissed his way down Steve’s body, tonguing his balls, swirling them on his tongue, licking along the seam.  Steve’s cock jumped, straining.
“I think he’s overstepping, moving beyond SHIELD into aggression. I have to call him out.”
And honestly, it was better this way.  He’d been stupid enough to show up on a news conference. What an idiot. He’d put his face on live television answering Miss Everhart.  Stern knew where he was now. And it wasn’t fair to get Tony involved in any capacity.  He obviously didn’t know about Rebirth, about Erskine or Howard or Phillips.  He didn’t know about Stern. The last thing Tony needed was Stern causing problems, and Steve had brought that to his doorstep anyway.
JustaShell: I’m trying.  But it’s hard to live up to that kind of standard.  He thought I could be someone better than I am.  He believed I could change… the world, practically.
Steve smiled, involuntarily.  “That was sort of weird for a pep talk, Buck.  But thanks.  I know you’re trying to help.”
“Nah, that’s Peter.  He’s the freshman on the team,” Steve said.  “He’s super smart.  Like Tony.”
“You drooled on me.”
At the front of the room, Steve raised an eyebrow, but said nothing.  He added a note about the filtration masks for the team and then asked for team input.
“Flying,
“Christine Everhart, Mr. Stark. What do you say to rumors that you sold weapons to the Russians at an orgy with supermodels and are holding the money in Dubai?” she asked, smiling as if she’d caught him.
More irony.  Tony was going to get his movement back, but the reactor was going to die on him before he could get down to the workshop. He was going to die before the paralysis wore off. This was worse than Afghanistan.  It was worse than anything.
Thank god the Brit wasn’t a moron, Natasha thought vaguely.  She really needed to start hanging out with more girls.  Hidden depths.
Tony.  It had to be.  No one else that Steve knew had that kind of power.  And Tony had been able to get him to back off once before.  It had to be.  He was still doing favors for him, even after Steve… He blushed, uncomfortable with himself.
Steve rode out of Manhattan, watching the sun go down, the wind bracing on his skin, whipping brisk around his face. This was worse than the ice.  This time he’d done it to himself knowingly, it was all on him. This time he had to live through it, instead of waking up after.  He wondered how long it would take, this time, to get to
“Mr. Stark?” Steve called. “Um, I have coffee for you. If you want.  Jarvis said two sugars.”
“All for your boyfriend here, huh?”
Steve put his bookmark between the pages, set it aside.  “Well.  When I feel like I need more information to solve a problem or make a decision, I go to the experts. People who know more than I do.”
“I know,” Tony replies.
“I would like to communicate more with you, Tony,” Thor announced, waggling his eyebrows in a manner he seemed to think would be suggestive.
“That’s Dr. Selvig’s volvo,” Tony told them.  “He’s sent me to get his briefcase out of it like half a dozen times just this month.”
Steve dismissed the team, reminding Natasha to pick up extra chili sauce for Tony’s drunken noodles. He grabbed Tony on his way out to talk about the filtration systems.
Steve grimaced, chastened.  “Sorry, Sam.  I don’t know.  I guess I’ve just been a little stressed.”
“Um, hey guys, does anyone know why Justin Hammer is at my door?” Steve asked curiously.  “Is he even in chemistry this year?”
“Mr. Stark!” one of the kids said into the video call.  Her eyes sparkled, excited.  “We’re so honored to have you call us, we’ve been looking into palladium replacements—“
Shit.  This could not be happening.  Too many pieces were falling into place. Steve couldn’t breathe, his lungs burning for oxygen. Shit shit shit. That date, just about a year ago.  Halfway between Jalalabad and Peshawar.  Those were indelibly carved into Steve, the source of his guilt, the way he’d earned his discharge. Earned on the backs of his troops, at the cost of Bucky’s arm.  Not a retrieval unit. A rescue unit.  His unit.  Whoever it was had made a deal to sell Tony’s weapons to a warlord in Afghanistan to take out Steve’s ducklings.
Tony’s arm snaked around his waist. “I would have stayed.”
“Really?” Steve asked, genuinely surprised.
And he does.  It works.  It works until Tony is outnumbered (he always is), surrounded (he always is), and the suit is damaged.  Giant sewer rats, the size of golden retrievers and glowing an unhealthy purple, mob him, razor claws scratching into the metal plates of the suit. Tony’s unsure what his next move is when a flash of black polymers catches his eye.  The fight’s a little more even.  Steve takes on more than his share, although Tony’s not sure that the suit is going to hold up well to the glowing purple claws.  He just hopes they’re not poisonous, too.  Eventually, they’re winning, only a few of the horrible sewer rats left. Steve’s caught one leaping toward his face when Tony puts down the last one on his side.  Tony turns, gauntlet raised, to blast the purple beast, and Steve flinches hard. It lets the rat scratch him deep across the chest. The suit holds up, but he’s bleeding profusely from his sternum. There’s a crack, and the rat goes limp, the glow fading.
Then Steve stopped, caught himself, the motion of his fingers stilling over Tony’s face as he drew back. Tony could see the guilt there.  “Miss Potts,” Steve said, ashamed. He flushed, the red enticing, drawing beneath the split in his collar.  He looked away.  “I’m sorry.” As if it were Steve who had started it.  As if it had been Steve who was splitting them apart.
Pepper and Rhodey made their way out together, in intense discussion about Barnes and Romanoff.  She turned back at the door, looking at the pair still standing inside.  She took a deep breath, a smile settling across her face, and shut the door quietly behind her.
Tony turned around, shifting nervously.  “So, you slept with Loki, huh?” he teased. “Even I haven’t slept with an Asgardian.”
“We’ll be waiting at the cars!” Pepper called to them.
did you move from?”
Tony couldn’t look at him, buried his face in Steve’s chest, feeling the steady rhythm of his heart.
“That’s what we do, Tony. We make weapons. What we do keeps the world from falling into chaos.”
Well, this was going great.  Fast friends.  Stark walked in an actual circle around him.  He prodded Steve’s bicep at one angle, made a motion like he was measuring his shoulders in another.
Ugh.  No. No.  Tony’s pulse raced, his stomach didn’t want to stay in place.  But what could Hammer possibly do to Natasha? Nothing. The girl was more than capable of handling herself and then some. So, what, he had them all hang out together for a couple awkward sessions? Okay. Not so bad, right? He could do that.  He could.  And she wouldn’t ever let him touch her anyway. So he could buy off Hammer, stay in his good graces. Because if Howard found out… Shit.  Tony didn’t even want to think about what would happen.  He’d be disowned, first.  Out of the company. Pulled from school.  Maybe sent to one of those praythegayaway camps. Or maybe Howard would just try to beat it out of him.  Not like it hadn’t happened before, the sleeping with the teddy bear, that one brief moment in kindergarten when he wanted to be a writer.
Quickly, he sent a new message.
“Gross, Bucky,” his blind date said through the phone.
From: Tony 10:35am
“Well,” Steve began, “I guess I should clean up in here.  Do you have a list for me to do today?”
No, knowing Steve, he’d be just as quick to protect him, to listen to his advice, to back Tony’s play. Just as generous with giving credit to Tony when it was due. Just as unwilling to send Tony into a compromised situation, doing it only when there truly was no other way—and his tactical mind was better than anyone Tony had ever seen, Fury included.
This is team building, Rogers style. Coaching. Tony's seen his work enough to recognize it, too.
Speak of the devil. A rumbling motorcycle pulled up in front of the house, and Brock Rumlow got off, hanging his bucket helmet over one handlebar.  Tony noted that he was favoring his left side heavily, and moved like he was extremely sore.  Good.  Asshole deserved whatever Steve dished out.
? I’m just trying to keep him on the ground. What makes you think I’m giving him anything?”
Rhodey was grinning, like a dork.  “You’re getting enchiladas with the whole enchilada?” he asked.
“It’s true, huh? In the flesh.” Stark shook his head a little, clearing it.  “Jesus.  Dad would’ve been so proud.”
Tony continued staring at him, tracking his movement.  Then: “Get in.”
“You’re screwed, dickbag. Think daddy will love you now?”
She smiled again at him, her voice stretching through his heart, a balm on a sore. “No one will come to harm, Captain, unless it be you.  It will only last for a day, after all. But you must be certain what you wish for.  Knowing the consequences.”
“And you’re okay with that?” Tony shouts, incredulous.
Sam pretended to yack up a hairball while Natasha glared at Tony.  “Couldn’t he have just texted?” she asked.  “Or emailed? Or face-timed?”
From: Rhodeybear 10:42am
School was school.  Evidently, it continued, despite any upheavals Tony experienced. Despite any time Steve may have spent in lock up (Natasha had gotten Murdock to put aside his “I don’t really do this kind of lawyering, Ms. Romanoff,” to take on Steve’s case.  Steve was going to be just fine).  Hammer didn’t end up coming back though. Nor did Hodge.  Not by the time February rolled around, anyway.
“Well. It just felt like working for Senator Brandt again.  Back to being a dancing monkey.”
Steve hit #3 quickly. Bucky would be relieved. He worried too much about Steve. “Bucky! I—“
Steve finished up, tossing the bandaid wrappers and putting the kit neatly away.  When he stood up, Tony was in the other room, getting a new shirt.  Steve turned to the kitten, still curled happily in his towel.  “Okay, baby, let’s go find everyone else,” he said to him, picking him up again.
Tony was covered in sweat, having spent the last few hours rearranging the workshop.  Back into hardware mode.  Jarvis had gotten some workmen to dig most of what he needed from storage.  They’d been sweaty and smelly and disgusting, and using his elevator, but he couldn’t complain.  They did the heavy lifting and got the equipment to him sooner than he had anticipated. Tony had told himself severely that he did not wish they were Steve.  It hadn’t helped.  Dynalab and ADC rushed him a shipment. Being Tony Stark did come with some perks. Like the ability to pay double the rush fee and get supplies delivered within the hour.
Double huh.  He thought Pepper had said picking up stray boys was a bad idea.  Walking sexual harassment lawsuit.  Something like that.
“Stern or Stark?” Bucky teased.  He knew Steve’s type, watched him fall for a feisty temperament with a sharp brain and dark eyes before.
Tony tapped his fingers on Steve’s chest, counting. “When I have you come down to the workshop, even if technically I don’t need you around.  I had you teach me how to scramble eggs.  So I could be around you at breakfast for longer.  When I ask if I can take you to your meetings when really I should just let you go with Sam. Do you even know how long Dum-E’s been waiting to give you those watercolors? I just didn’t know how to do it without being awkward.”
I’m so incredibly proud of you! I can’t even find the words to tell you how amazing you are.  You’re so brave.  I wish I could be more like you.  Maybe I’ll find a way to get there. I might move a little slower than you do, but you’re inspiring to me, too.  I’m so so proud of you!
Steve couldn’t bring himself to leave his room for breakfast.
“—really wasn’t going to go out for cross country before that, so full confessions here, Steve’s the reason I’m off running so much,” Pieter was telling his sister.

“You wanna tell me what your buddy was after?”
Tony read the email, almost wistful.  Was there something like that for him?  It had been a difficult week. He’d gone with Nat every day to see the lawyer, Murdock, who seemed intense.  But he needed intense. He needed the help.  And it wouldn’t be too long, now, until he would be out of danger.
"Oh my. I shouldn't have even come!" Tony mocks and Steve laughs again.
"This is it," Steve says, gesturing around the room vaguely before launching himself onto the bed, which rests in a corner of the tiny room.
"I've wanted you for a while now," Tony says breathlessly, as Steve licks the purple bruise on his neck, offering it temporary relief. He sighs softly, breathing in Steve's scent. Steve shudders, as Tony wraps his legs around his trim waist.
Wow, he thought, Steve's hands might just become his favorite part of him.
"You okay?" Steve asks, voice tight and Tony merely nods, biting his tongue in an attempt to not cry.
Later, when Steve had cleaned them both up and they lay on the bed; Tony's head resting on Steve's chest, as the soldier traced circles down Tony's arm.
Steve and Tony couldn't keep their hands off of each other.
Steve adverts his eyes and Tony's gut twists.
"Um, these are for you," Tony forces a smile when she finally lets go of him, and pushes the flowers into her hands.
"O’ Hell, would you let me finish?"
From his pant pocket, he draws a piece of charcoal and begins to sketch something on his hand. Tony watches impatiently, as the drawing looks more and more familiar with every stroke until-
the bowl of soup, prepared from whatever the hunter had stocked in his kitchen.
Sarah dabs her eyes, and turns to him, the smile returning to her face. Tony can see so much of Steve in her.
, he repeats to himself as he storms to his room.
"I've regretted them every second I have lived. And now I am here, sitting with you, a hunter I
It had simply been woven into existence when their paths had crossed.
Howard wasn't home. Tony thought it was best that Steve stay over for the weekend and Steve— Steve was giddy with excitement.
The spread on the table is lavish to say the least. Tony doesn't know half of what he is seeing but it smells so ravishing, he can't really wait to dive right in.
In retrospect, that was the worst thing to say, ever.
One would've hoped that after finally getting together, the friends would've found some solace. But now, they faced another problem.
“Uh huh,” Steve said, still not looking at him.
Steve wrings his hands and sighs.
"Just accept it and then give it to me, man," Sam mutters and Sarah shakes her head at him, but is clearly amused.
Steve's eyes snap open.
"Well, most people are in this
"You don't have to give me an answer today. Just, think about it?" Steve asks, eyes round and pleading.
"Tony, if you can hear me, know that I regret all of it. I've never admitted this to anybody, but if I could take it all back, I would.
Tony's grin widens and he snuggles closer to Steve, lifting an arm to throw it around him but he pauses, hesitant.
Tony rubs the palm of his hand. "I'm not entirely sure. I guess I have to take care of my father's company."
, is he hot.
Steve felt his eyes flutter shut and he whimpered slowly. He loved getting his dick sucked, it was no secret, but having Tony do that to him took it to another level.
something that was always meant to be.
"Get what?" he croaked as Steve bit down on the spot behind his ear while grinding against his butt.
"Anyway, tell me about you, darling. What do you want to do after college?"

"How?"
Steve feigns dismay and Sarah laughs again, reaching out to squeeze his shoulder.
"I'm pretty sure he's the one spoiling you," she mutters smugly and if Tony wasn't sure before, he definitely likes her now.
have a crush on. What do you want to do about it?"
His eyes feel heavy, and his entire body is feverish with desire, the racing thoughts in his brain tumbling out of his mouth before he can ever stop them.
Despite his powers being feeble at the moment, he rushes out of the room, but not before he casts the hunter one, last look. His features seem gaunt, which is natural, considering that he has just been on the brink of death; ghost-like skin caked with dust, hands greasy and bloody.
They'd only began dating recently, having confessed their love after being pressured into it by their exasperated circle of friends.
Tony pulled back again, and Steve felt his teeth scrape against the length. Steve winced.
"You ah— you uh touched my—
"Bucky lives with you, how-"
"You better not be fucking with me, Rogers," Tony mutters, still shocked, even though he knows Steve isn't heartless enough to pull something like this on him.
"’Could've done this myself, you know?"
Tony then reaches behind Steve to produce a lipstick from God knows where. He holds his stare as he lets his fingernails scrunch up the fabric of Steve's expensive shirt before ripping it open, buttons flying askew. Steve has barely enough time to react, before Tony quickly writes ten digits in the flamboyant red on his skin and then jumps off his lap, just as the song in the background comes to an end.
Steve caresses Tony's cheek with his thumb, smile still wide on his face.
A blonde head peeks in through the half ajar door a moment later and then swings open entirely, to reveal a smiling Steve, dressed in a casual white tee and jeans.
Steve's almost done playing too, so he pulls his fingers out gently and Tony whimpers at the loss- a sound that makes Steve's entire body flush.
Tony felt his eyes droop, exhaustion taking over completely. Never, in all his life, had he actually felt this warm after sex, this full, this happy.
"You could tell them that I'm not like the other witches-"
, his legs were already shaking, but it felt oh so fucking good. He gripped at the sheets beside him tightly, hoping that he wouldn't fall.
If Tony had to describe the Rogers' household using only colors, he'd say that every moment spent there was a sunny yellow tinted with a gentle red.
Steve's face visibly falls at that, and he lets go of hand and Tony suddenly feels cold all over. He turns away, not wanting to fall victim to the tricks his mind seems to be playing.
"You're not so bad yourself," he whispers, lips brushing the shell of Steve's ear. His voice is soft and flirty, and it sends shivers down Steve's spine. Tony is making him feel like a first timer and he absolutely loves it.
The sight of Tony on his knees before him, pupils blown, was enough to send Steve into overdrive but he tried to clear his mind. This was just a one time thing. Steve was trying to tutor Tony. Nothing more.
The house is small, smaller than Tony is used to, at least. The walls are a faded blue, a striking contrast from the blinding white walls at his father's place. The furniture belongs in an era long before their birth, but there's a certain harmony in the way that the flowery tapestries hang in the drawing area, the lived in couches and the scraped, vintage tables. It isn't luxury living, but something tells Tony that this house never gets cold.
But Tony finds himself relaxing more in Steve's presence, finds himself liking the way they shoot each other down while also being equals in some ways.
Tony blinks at him, obviously taken aback. He is silent for a moment. "What do I have to do in return?"
The blond however, had other plans.
He is greeted by the same, silent void.
be a guy. I'm not sure."
Steve hasn't been this turned-on since... forever. He's feeling almost animal-like, something wild and carnal in him wants to rip off that last piece of cloth off Tony's skin and take him whole.
He cleans up as much of the blood he can, so as to save the wound from being infected.
"I'll pay you double the amount that you get here," Steve says, voice almost guttural and Tony pulls back to stare at him with wide eyes. "You don't have to keep doing this."
A mortal. Killed by
Tony doesn't even realise when Steve comes up behind him and wraps his arms around his waist, pulling him flush against his chest.
Steve blinks. "That was fast. Are you sure? I don't want to pressure-"
How could
Once he figured Steve was relaxed, he popped open the button of Steve's pants, gazing up at him with a wistful look in his eyes.
The stairs lead to an aisle, which further leads to three separate rooms. Steve guides him towards the last one.
Another thrust. Steve was being painfully slow, taking his time to tease Tony.
“I like you too. I can’t believe this is real. And I can’t believe we just did that,” he said, flustered. Tony had sucked his dick and kissed him, all in the same evening. It was almost too much.
"I don't generally do this
"Love that," Tony purrs, continuing to grind against Steve.
"You keep calling me witch hunter, but I've never
Steve smiles at her forcefully. He is still debating whether or not to go ahead with this at all, partly because he is slightly tipsy from the bar visit and partly because this was not a habit he wants to develop. But today he needs this.
Steve," Tony begs, managing to turn his face away from the mattress,"I need you i-inside me."
The next and last part is pure smut, I promise! (Updates next Thursday) Come talk to me on tumblr @starkrogerrs :P
A moment later, he opened his eyes, slowly sitting up. Tony was walking out of the bathroom, dabbing his lips with a towel, a shy glint in his eyes.
"Don't... Stop... Talking," Steve grunted out, each word punctuated with faint breaths.
“No,” Tony said firmly and Steve blinked twice, any sign of amusement leaving his face.
Steve drags his hand up the length of Tony's thigh, before resting it on his ass. He gives it a harsh squeeze and Tony bites his lips, groaning.
"I've never actually killed a witch," Steve admits as they sit pouring over books, in the amber light of the tiny library that the hunter himself built. Several rows lay stacked with ancient books that he somehow possesses.
"You don't got to tell me twice," Sam murmurs as he reaches over to the soup and begins pouring himself some.
"Now, don't be shy, boys. Dig in," Sarah says, smiling fondly. Tony knows why Steve is the way he is now. Even when they were poor and didn't really have much food (Steve had told Tony about his difficult childhood), Sarah's love kept him full.
"What coven do you belong to?"
Steve leaned back a little then, never letting go of Tony's waist, his grip firm. There was a wicked look on his face, eyes dark with lust. He swung Tony's legs over his broad shoulders, as the latter groaned at the sensation.
"No. But I am aware of the coven they belong to."
His legs are long shafts of beautiful, bronze skin and Steve swears he has never seen a more beautiful man in a life.
he whispers against his lips, letting the power of the words settle into Steve’s being.
"You don't have to be nervous, she'll love you. I can tell she already does."
"I don't care,
Thankfully, the boys troop in just then; Steve falling in between Sarah and Tony and Sam and Bucky on the couch across them.
“That…  you like someone else,” he said, surprised by his own admission.
"Right. So, uh, when do you want to try this thing?"
," he says again, finally letting go of his hand and nodding reassuringly.
good at this. He moans as he bucks his hips, feeling the orgasm erupt low in his stomach. Steve seems to be moving at lightning speed; the smack of his cock against his slick hole is nothing short of erotic.
Tony grabbed Steve’s hand, ”Hey, look at me.
Tony tears his gaze away from the man then, the thought of escaping clouding his mind already. Adrenaline courses through him, heart beating wildly at his chest at the thought of freedom. At the thought of seeing familiar faces again. He almost grins as he reaches the main door and yanks it open.
of charge," Tony muses, handing Steven -
. You cannot possibly, be asking me this."
White hot anger burns through him.
They fell into perfect sync; Steve thrusting into Tony’s mouth as Tony continued to pump his cock.
Steve's face falls. He'd wanted to see Giselle today; she was exceptionally attractive and often helped him forget everything that was on his mind. This was the one place he was allowed to have a favorite.
The world fell around him as the ache grew stronger, until it burned hot and bright before his eyes and he came into Tony's mouth with a loud cry.
"I didn't tell them, I swear. They must've put a spell on this place. I've told them to wait downstairs so I can fetch you."
Summoning magic that is as old as time itself, he chants a spell he's never used before. Before he can even complete it, the wound starts to glow white. Tony can feel the familiar tug in his gut as he continues to whisper the spell, Steve's grip still firm on his arm.
"I-I was attacked," Steve manages throatily. "By- by a werewolf."
"No way you're sleeping without me," Steve mutters, nibbling at his ear.
"The murderer was from your coven."
"Your house is beautiful," Tony says, trying to jump right past the awkwardness and help some of his own nervousness.
"If you leave with me, you are bound to me automatically by the spell that guards the house. There is no escape, Anthony," Steve answers and Tony wonders if he imagines the reluctance in his voice. "I
Steve tugs him closer, brushing the skin of the delicious 'V' above his abdomen. "Whatever you do here. The only difference- it'll be at my place. For me exclusively."
Tony reaches over to hold Steve's hand, his body acting on its own accord. A heartbeat passes as Steve stares up at him with big, round eyes.
Steve grasps his hands then, a determined look on his face. "I know, I know. But I really, really love you, Tony. I want this."
"You're not taking enough care of him," Sarah chimes in, playing along. "He's miserable, the poor thing."
"I know," Tony said against his lips, his trademark smirk plastered on his face and holy shit— Steve realised— he was so far gone that there was no recovering from this again.
Tony swallowed everything he had to give, lapping it up like he needed it to survive.
I am so sorry for being so late but it's finally here sigh. I am sorry if it isn't worth the wait but I've had enough of this fic sgdnhs.
"I hope you're enjoying yourself," he mumbles, burying his nose into Tony's neck as Tony leans back into him with a sigh. Even if he has been with Steve in the same room all day, he's missed him.
sugar, let me make you feel good," he says softly, and Steve can feel Tony's hardness pressing against him as his own twitches in response.
"Earth to Rogers. You here, babe?" he asked again, turning around completely now so that their knees touched; hating that all the work that Steve had done on his body seemed to be disappearing.
Tony frowned, turning his head slightly to look at Steve, who was staring down at his back. His pupils were blown so wide that the brunet almost came then and there.
Tony doesn't know what to say. Steve seems to be more trusting of him, and he doesn't know what to think.
can’t believe it took me sucking your dick for you to confess,” Tony retorted, laughing as Steve swatted his arm, before snuggling into him once more.
Tony stares at Steve for a moment, tonguing his cheek. Steve can't tell what he's thinking.
"Quit being such a chicken, will you," Tony mumbles, gesturing at Steve to hold out his arms. He starts to bandage his torso with the fresh gauze.
"What in the Heaven..," he murmurs to himself.
"Okay," Tony said, putting his mouth to his cock again. He sank down on it, careful to not hurt Steve this time.
"I — need — you," Tony managed in between grunts as Steve continued to nibble at his ear. Steve was all around him, and Tony felt warm like he hadn't in years.
Before Tony can complain, however, Steve slips in a finger, moving to lick the skin between Tony's shoulder blades. Tony buries his face into the mattress- there are so many things happening at once- only if to muffle the loud and drawn moan that tumbles from his mouth.
The hunter - Steven, he has learned- visits frequently now. They have the same conversation everyday but that doesn't stop the man from trying again. Steven grills him at an increasing degree everyday, but hasn't resorted to physical torture.
They help Sarah clean up after, refusing to listen to her when she says she can manage on her own.
Having used most of his magic on the healing spell, he cannot even attempt to break the spell that surrounds the house. The spell, he realises, must be the work of a white witch.
"Other than the fact that you're not my bitch, I loved it."
Steve's mouth fell open, eyes unblinking.
Steve let his hands slide down Tony's back and squeeze his hips, eliciting a soft moan from him. Steve loved the little noises that Tony made— soft moans and breathy whispers of his name.
Steve all but snapped back to reality.
A single tear rolls down his cheek and Tony feels his chest tighten.
His words are almost a whisper, he’s not entirely sure if he said them out loud.
Steve lets out a moan at the sudden friction and Tony flashes him a brilliant smile.
"More than," he croaked, voice hoarse and throaty.
It's Steve.
"Turn around. I want to look at you when I fuck you," Steve growls low in Tony's ear, eliciting a moan from him.
"I joined the Barnes' Hunters Guild then. They took me in when I was eighteen. It's been my mission to catch my mother's killer then," he says grimly.
"Hello," Tony says nervously and squeezes Steve's hand which still clasps his for comfort. Steve nudges him reassuringly.
with you or anything."
"But I've tried to be better.
A loud clang echoes through the chamber. The door of the cell opens, flooding it with white light, and in spite of the fact that he needs the light so desperately, he finds himself shielding his eyes against it.
kind.
"There's rules in this strip club, mister," Tony retorts but the blush hasn't left his cheeks yet. Steve squeezes his ass again, gesturing for Tony to start moving again.
He tried to keep his mind completely blank as Tony pulled his boxers down, his cock springing free.
Steve laughs and kisses his cheek. All of his nervous energy from the morning is gone, and he actually feels comfortable now. Even more so in Steve's arms.
Tony frowns at him.
"That's the symbol of the Church of Lilith!"
to get into his pants.
"You need to rest," he whispers, ignoring the hunter's question altogether. He falters as Steven reaches over to grip his hand. From what he can gather, Tony knows that he must be in incredible pain.
Tony clamps his mouth shut with his hand, still grinning. "Make up your mind, Rogers. Do you or do you not want me to move in?"
"Go on baby,” he whimpers, throwing his head back into the mattress again, eyes fluttering shut. The dates could definitely wait.
The corners of Tony's eyes were wet.
Steve. Fuck.
Steven was a mortal first, after all.
killed a witch."
Steve hums, and there it is again; that swooping feeling inside Tony's stomach that raises a million red flags in his head.
Tony has never seen a more gruesome sight. He can tell that it, most definitely, is the mark of a werewolf.
The hunter stares at him for a moment, undoubtedly considering his options.
in my
Tony doesn't think he and Steve are becoming friends.
Tony looks at him questioningly, jaw set. He doesn't know if he wants to discuss this. It is easier to justify his choice of helping Steve if he pretended that he wasn't really a hunter. "I find that hard to believe."
"I never thanked you for healing me. For agreeing to help me. I don't know why you did it, but- but I am grateful. And. And I am sorry. For making you go through all of this," Steve whispers against his lips, words tumbling over one another in his effort to be earnest.
Steve didn’t see the smile that lifted the corners of Tony’s mouth.
He crashes onto his bed heavily, feeling that hot anger flash through him in bursts. He misses his coven, his friends and familiar more so than ever. James, Happy and all of his friends must be looking for him as well. The thought twists at his heart.
That very oath rings in his ears as he removes his robe and tears a long strip from the hem. Wrapping the cloth around the wound as gingerly as possible, he helps Steven sit up. Then, he pulls Steven's left arm around his shoulders and hauls them outside.
"But I'm your
"What
In the face of spending a lifetime trapped with a hunter of all people, death seems like the most welcome choice.
The effect is almost immediate; Tony feels like a blanket has been lifted off of him.
, what the fuck was he doing and — oh.
"Well, you know now. That I'm yours. Forever," he said, climbing on top of Steve, who was already moaning and captured his lips in his own.
"Objection, Your Honor! Witnesses state that Steve is taking good care of him. More than the required and prescribed care, in fact."
Just as the stars swimming before his eyes begin to fade, Steve comes inside him, moaning a string of curses; his warm seed filling him whole. The fact that Tony is the one who satisfied his needs, makes him feel hot all over again.
"How do you even know if the witch is still alive?"
A heartbeat passes before Steve throws a pillow at him while Tony goes beet red and Sam whoops loudly.
"I'm Steve," he greets back.
Gripping Tony's hips with both hands, Steve picks up pace. He spears in and out, angling himself closer and closer to Tony's prostate and
"If it makes you uncomfortable, I can talk to James-"
"The food will be ready in about ten minutes, why don't you boys wait in the drawing room? Sam and Bucky said they'd be here soon."
Andy interrupts. “That doesn’t mean he won’t. It also doesn’t mean that he might not trip on a curb tomorrow and break his damn neck.”
“We know,” Andy placates. “But trust me… it’s better if they think he’s dead.”
—a tremendous gift. Steve doesn’t doubt that Tony was happy with her.
“And she’s not a replacement for Tony.”
“She has her mother,” Bucky interjects.
Let him. Steve isn’t trying to replace Tony. No one could possibly do that. He just wants to be there for Tony’s daughter, to protect her like Tony would if he could.
When Tony settles down, a smile still playing at his lips, he says, “Hey, Rogers?”
And Andy would
“We’re immortal,” he says. Morgan turns sharply to look at him. “For real,” he says. “Not just… enhanced. It’s not just the serum for me. We’re… immortal. We can’t be killed. I’m told that we can die… eventually. That at some point it runs out, but apparently it takes hundreds or thousands of years to happen.”
. Or even if they just don’t believe you’re really you.”
Rogers bites his lip but says, “The world saw you
is one of them. What the
She glares. “Do that.”
He can see the wheels spin behind her eyes. She’s brilliant—not Tony brilliant, no one is, really—but close. And she’s brilliant in ways that Tony wasn’t; she’s so much better with people.
It isn’t hard to recruit Bruce into helping Morgan find ways to meet up with Tony, and she does a better job of hiding her excitement about getting to see him. That doesn’t mean that she’s not irritated that Bruce knew and also didn’t tell her, but she milks his guilt to get him to help out.
Cradling Morgan to him like she’s his own personal emotional-support child, he asks, “Aren’t I allowed to miss him too?”
Andy glare over the line, which is, honestly, impressive. The only other person he knew who could do that was Natasha. “He’s not, and you know it.”
Five more years pass, and then they do it, somehow. The Avengers. They somehow bring everyone back.
“No, Bruce, they’re right. Morgan and Pepper think I’m dead, right?” he asks and gets a hesitant nod. Stark takes a deep breath. “Okay then… then they won’t be hurt again. Hurt more, I mean. It’s better this way, I think.”
Pepper, really?” he says, completely blindsided by the accusation.
"There are loads, sir but you haven't been with anyone of them. Who would you like?"
Bucky follows suit and Steve offers some bread to Tony, which Tony gratefully accepts. Steve passes him the steak as well, making it less awkward for him.
Stupid boner.
"That, I couldn't vouch against," Tony retorts, moving to help Sarah with the flowers. He's lost some of the nervousness already, feeling the jitters fizzle as Steve takes his hand again.
"But I am. I will return your powers in exchange for your help in finding the killer. Once we find them, you are free to go."
"You're lucky that you have a pretty face, hunter," Tony adds, when he says nothing. "Or I would've slaughtered you long ago."
Steve squeezes his hand amidst the chaos then, drawing his attention and nods towards the staircase leading up to the second storey.
"C'mon," Steve presses, voice dropping an octave,"I'll treat you so
Steve's dependent on him now, because he isn't fully healed yet. It is exactly what he had wanted; to ask Steve for freedom when he was most vulnerable. And yet, Tony finds himself straying from that very thought and showing Steve concern no hunter deserves.
"Please-," Steven whispers, reaching out to grasp Tony's arm. "-please, help me."
"You healed me, your captor. I don't think those hands could kill an innocent mortal."
Tony scoffed, burying his face into Steve's chest to hide his blush.
be a hunter. And I should
Steve turns him onto his stomach then, and Tony's core flushes with the anticipation of his long-awaited release. Steve throws a pillow under Tony to hoist his ass up for better access. He's careful yet rough— just
"Surely there's somebody who's free," he says, hoping his voice sounds more cheerful than what it seems like to him.
Tony wonders if Steven had used and perhaps,
Tony moans again as Steve's head brushes against his hole. Squeezing his eyes shut and tilting his head back to give Steve's tongue better access, he does his best not to come even though every fiber of his being feels like it's being twisted.
" Steve whispers assertively and Tony sees remorse and... something else in those azure eyes. He wants to look away, lest it burn him completely. He can't bring himself to. Instead, he pulls Steve close and kisses him, with the passion of a thousand burning suns. He tastes fire, regret and a flash of the future that leaves him gasping for air.
Tony understands immediately, feeling a little elated at the thought of seeing Steve's childhood room. Steve excuses the both of them, but not before Sam's thrown him a knowing look and Tony blushes as they climb up the stairs.
"No," Steve said too fast, but hoped that Tony would ignore this, "I mean— Buck might be already seeing someone and I don't think he'd be willing, you know?"
Steve laughs attractively, and Tony has to bite his lip again. Who would've thought he'd fall for his employer-of-sorts? Thirty minutes ago he had been on the brink of tears and now there was only one thing echoing in his mind.
Sarah pats his hand. "What do you want to do?" she asks again.
Steve sits on Tony's left and Bucky across him, while Sam sits opposite to Steve. In between Bucky and Tony, sits Sarah, at the head of the table.
The sound makes Steve groan too, and he slides  another lubed finger in, pulling and twisting and pushing as Tony shudders against his hand. Steve can tell that Tony's absolutely loving this and the thought of him coming further strokes the desire burning inside him.
Tony walks over to help him ease back into the bed, hand gripping his back. The gash across his front, although stitched, is still an angry red and the skin around it seems to be infected.
Steve eyes shoot open, pupils blowing wide with lust. Tony tries to make a comment but his throat tightens. He only tugs at Steve's pants and the latter leans away to swiftly shuck them to the floor. Tony watches his sprung cock hungrily, almost drooling and something comes over Steve as he hooks his fingers into that red, silken thong and tears it right off of him. The action makes Tony's dick twitch with arousal and he lets out a squeaky moan.
Steve shut the door behind them and he hadn't even turned around fully before Tony was kissing him again.
"I don't want you staying here for long either," he says. "But you need to eat, you can't die on me."
Steve screams in agony, reaching over to clutch Tony's arm. He flinches as his nails dig into his skin, but continues to spread the paste around. The blood flow has slowed down but if Tony doesn't act fast, he knows that it would kill him. The paste can only do so much.
"Surprise me," he says nonchalantly, stalking off to his already paid-for-room.
"Has it occurred to you that the witch might not be from my coven at all?"
Just then a loud knock resounds in the room, and he has to bury his face into the pillow. Steve, although his only company, is the last person he wants to talk to right now.
Fuck.
Steve parts Tony's legs then, gripping him by his ass and dragging him close to his own core. Tony immediately wraps his legs around Steve's waist again, biting his lower lip.
"Just some girl," Bucky murmurs, shooting daggers at Sam and Steve who are still laughing.
"My father, who you obviously knew," he began, tensing a little at the thought of his father. But Steve's hands found their way to his dick and palmed him gently and, well, Tony forgot whatever he was supposed to say.
"So...uh you're serious about this guy?"
“No, let’s finish this,” he said, determined, and maybe Steve was experienced but he was also an idiot, an idiot in love and he could formulate no response. Tony resumed his work, eyeing his cock almost hungrily, letting his tongue roll around him. It wasn’t the swiftest motion but Steve felt heat burn up his chest. He let his fingers curl through Tony’s hair and Tony moaned audibly at the sensation. Steve bit his lip, afraid he might give away too much of his feelings.
"Tony, I did what I had to do," he adds softly, regret full and genuine in his voice.
Steve hummed in response, urging Tony to continue. He nuzzled his nose into Tony's neck, as his warm fingers skimmed down his thighs.
He slams his fist into the ground, frustrated at how pathetic and helpless he feels.
"Food for today," says the man from behind the flaming torch, as he stoops down to place a wooden plate before him.
The light is gone as quickly as it had come. He hears the crunch of feet on the stone floor and a soft click, as fire bursts into the room, flooding it warm amber.
“It’s what?”
Her eyes glaze over then, reminiscing. Tony reaches over and squeezes her hand, feeling sorry. He doesn't know where he gets the confidence from, but he knows it's the only thing to do.
Tony takes a shaky breath.
Tony cleared his throat then, as Steve sat down beside him, leaving a hand's breadth of distance between them. “So, how was I?”
Sarah shakes her head and waves her hand. "That boy is my blessing. I wouldn't have the courage to fight our state if it wasn't for him."
He eases Steven out of his already torn shirt. There are tiny cuts everywhere, a million paper cuts if you will, that probably hurt more than the actual wound itself.
"I want you... to
," Steve mutters, gasping when Tony presses too tightly.
Steve turns to him, vulnerability shining bright in his eyes. He cannot help but sympathise with the man; ache for him. Even if he shouldn't be because he's being held captive, for Satan's sake.
Steve leaned over again, sucking at the spot that made Tony's neck flush red and toes curl. Tony's eyes fluttered shut and lips parted instantly as Steve turned his chin to kiss him.
"It's nice, real cozy," Tony notes, moving to a tiny window in the wall which is half covered by the cupboard. There really isn't room to move around much. Out the window, Tony can see the lawn and the large oak tree that marks the start of the forest.
But all he does is push Tony closer to himself, hands still splayed firm against his ass.
words."
"We'll figure something out, babe. We always do."
"Hello, Mr. Rogers! We weren't expecting you today," a beautiful, red-haired woman greets him.
How could he say no to that?
"And I did at times bring you up in conversations randomly and—
Steve shakes his head.
you," he says, the words sounding like poison on his tongue.
"I guess I do owe you that much for saving my life."
Everything seems to be moving at the speed of lightning. Mere hours ago, he had been in Steve's embrace and now Steve is asking him to run away.
Steve cocks his head. "I'm sure you have."
"Are you serious right now?"
"You can't move a hair on my skin, witch," the hunter murmurs through gritted teeth.
His magic, to add to his misery, continues to remain at sub par levels.
"The tattoo," he half-whispered, breath fanning Tony's neck.
The hunter glances at him irritably, a single muscle clenching in his jaw. They say nothing for a moment.
Tony looks at him, shocked. For a horribly numbing moment he thinks Steve has double-crossed him. After everything they went through and last night-  he opens his mouth in question but Steve answers him before he says a word.
Steve wasn't particularly convinced, but Tony's tongue worked on the vein that throbbed on the underside of his cock and everything was forgotten. He tugged at Tony's hair again, needing the support as Tony's head bobbed up and down his length. Steve moaned long and slow as Tony sucked and blew alternatively; and he felt a familiar tug in the base of his abdomen.
Steve said nothing, eyes still dark as he turned Tony around, his fingernails digging into the brunette's skin. Steve pulled him onto his lap, his hardness pressing down against his back. Tony's breath hitched as arousal coursed through him again.
Tony was flung back in time, to the very eventful night of 4th of July, 1990. It was a couple of months after he'd turned twenty and the night America turned 214.
"God, I feel like I haven't eaten in years," Sam announces as they settle into the chairs around the dining table.
She returns a moment later, an apologetic look on her face. "Giselle's not here today, sir. Also, Rick and Hernandez are busy."
"Your teeth," Steve breathed, "less of that."
Tony stiffened at that, averting his eyes. "Well, there is something...it's what I actually came to you for."
Tony finally looked up at Steve then. There was so much trust and kindness in those eyes that Tony couldn't help himself.
The look Steve flashed him was grateful, as much for the lack of questions as the lie.  Then he took the elevator to his room and shower.  As soon as he disappeared, Tony told Jarvis to find everything he could on Steve Rogers.
“Um, yes?” Steve replied, confused.
“Nope, just Steve,” Steve said, level.
“No, you’re. It’s.” Steve swallows. “It’s okay.”
“See you guys at school.” Jimmy waved, moving back to stand next to his father.
Tony knew he should have fixed that. Supersoldier hearing and all. He steps from his alcove.  “Where’s your team, Steve?”
He paused at the top of the stairs, but Tony’s door was already open.  He could hear swearing, too, now, and running water.  Well.  This could be bad.  He hesitated outside, a few scenarios running through his mind.  He tried to quickly rank them for likelihood of occurring and potential for embarrassment.
“Sort of like flying, huh?”
Tony leered at him, giving him a very obvious once-over.  “It’d certainly show off your assets,” he threw back, winking.  “But I don’t know if America’s ready for that much of a show, Spangles.”
Steve kissed their joined hands.  “I know.  I know, Tony.”
Pepper handed the pie to Jarvis, then took off her coat and matching gloves. “Last week.  I freeze them, so there’s always a few lying around in case there’s an unexpected party.” She grinned, obviously pleased with herself.  “Jim went to pick up Sam and Steve, and Natasha and Bruce were right behind me.”
“Whatever you say, Cap,” Tony replies.  Then stops, a spoon midair.  “Sorry.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve couldn’t look at him, sat down on the edge of the bed.  “I’m a little old for that, I think,” he said, a self-deprecating note in his voice. “Or young.  Either way, I’ve never been particularly flighty.” He sighed.  “Sorry,” he said again.  “I’m um, more of a one-guy kinda guy.” He took a deep breath.  “I promise it won’t change anything, I won’t try anything,” he got out before he was knocked backward onto the bed and straddled.
“Alright, J.  Hit it.”
like she was thinking about kicking Hammer through a wall, so clearly she was acting on Tony's behalf), Tony was still elated.  The feeling of freedom, from telling Natasha, from being brave, he couldn’t contain it.
“It is, and I win,” Tony declared. “And I’m glad that Peggy recognizes that.”
Steve smiled up, gratefully. Tony always took care of the team.  He’d just done a round of upgrades, but Steve had said he wasn’t sure he wanted to wear full gloves because it interfered with his tactile dexterity.  Last week he’d gotten the fingerprints on his left hand singed off, though.  It had hurt, and benched him for almost two days.  Tony said fingers have a lot of nerve endings, good for sensation, but could make them painful if damaged.  Then he’d coughed, and told Steve he’d work on some gloves.  Steve had gone to bed that night thinking about just how he could use his fingers’ sensitivity to make Tony shiver with pleasure. He’d felt guilty and embarrassed, afterward.  On the other hand, his focus had definitely shifted away from the pain in his fingertips.
“I’ll catch you tomorrow, right? Filtration masks?” Tony tried to keep his voice even, avoid that pleading, needy tone he was feeling.
Steve just turned to the fridge and grabbed Tony a Coke. Then he added a pink straw with a paper umbrella on it, and handed it over, grinning.
“No, but we don’t like strangers,” Happy told him. Then, looking quickly at Pepper, “Which you clearly aren’t. But it’s good to have your information.  You know, in case of an emergency.” He looked back at Pepper, who smiled ever so slightly.  “So, you know.  I’ll be up to see you in a minute.  Get you a badge. Which you have to wear, at all times.” He glared slightly.
“You must be Tony,” she said, sounding extremely posh. “I’m so pleased to meet you.  Steve has said only very nice things about you. Hello, James.  Lovely to see you again.”
Coulson sighed.  He would have run a hand through his hair if he hadn’t been so completely in control of himself.  “Yeah.  He’s coming to HQ today.  We want you to meet him.”
Tony’s brain reset.  “Oh, well. I just meant, she was hot in the general sense.  Like, she’s very pretty. You totally have a chance with her,” he amended.
Steve sighed, setting down the shield shaped backpack and taking off his leather jacket.  Small mercies that SHIELD even let him ride a motorcycle to his own apartment.  As if they weren’t also probably making sure his neighbors were SHIELD agents.  Always had to control the circumstances.  He understood it—he’d been a little well, shell-shocked so to speak, coming out of the ice.  And the world was a lot… more complicated than it had been.  He thought about ditching the green Ford Focus he saw  trailing him two blocks behind, but it seemed petty when he knew they must have a tracker on the motorcycle itself anyway.  And they knew where he was going.  Work.  Home.  Work.
Steve was still confused, but he felt pretty sure they weren’t talking about him.  He didn’t have any iridium, at least.  He got out of bed, glad that he’d decided not to go to sleep naked, but also slightly mortified that he’d worn the Iron Man underwear.  He drew himself up, trying to project confidence.  “What’s going on?”
The kitchen was spotless, all stainless steel, gleaming surfaces.  The sunlight shone softly through the window, catching on minute specks of dust floating lazily with the movement of air.  Steve washed his hands (the sink turned on by itself! And then off!) and found ingredients.  Ham, cheese, pickles.  Mustard.  He pulled a pan from one off the cupboards and butter from the fridge.  While he toasted the sandwich he found a pantry that held some chips and washed a few strawberries.  He tipped the sandwich out of the pan, sliced it neatly at an angle, and arranged the halves on a plate. Pulling a glass out of the cupboard, he filled it with iced tea and added a lemon wedge.  This he could do.  This was methodical.  It calmed him.  He could momentarily forget that he was here, being the personal assistant to a crazy billionaire in order to protect his best friend, forget that he was fleeing from the greedy grasp of a power-hungry maniac, forget all of that.  This.  This was routine.  This made sense.
He opened the book toward the middle so he could add the loose sketch back in.
Tony’s done with it.  He grabs Steve and flies to the tower. When they touch down, Steve’s skin is clammy and pale, but he stops outside, plants himself firmly, and says, “The cuffs.”
“Okay.  After robotics tomorrow, Nat is coming to Steve’s chemistry study group.  Do you want to come with us?”
Steve flushed. Was that really what Tony thought of him? He was a narcissist and a bigot? So old-fashioned, so hypermasculine, that he couldn’t cope with change? Couldn’t compromise? Steve’s skin was heated but the rest of him was ice cold, humiliated, sick with disappointment in himself. He touched the handle of his motorcycle, trying to ground himself. No. Probably not. Or not entirely. Steve felt fairly sure that if Tony really thought all that of him, he’d be less welcoming than he was.  Tony didn’t dislike him; he was kind to Steve.  Caught him up on the good movies, showed him how to make the pop-up blocker more selective, asked him for feedback on his suits.  They were teammates. Friends.  Good friends, even.
He’d looked at Steve’s file back when Rhodey had handed it over.  Rogers had been to see a doctor all of twice.  He’d been in to two counseling sessions and then waived the rest.  No fault on the doctors.  They’d been overworked.  And it wasn’t like anyone was going to get Steve back in to see another one when his mind had been made up against it, the stubborn fool.  But Steve’s nightmares were clearly not new or unexpected. Tony thought, knowing Steve as much as he did now, the soldier probably didn’t want to impose.  Probably felt like he didn’t deserve the help as much as other people did, always selling himself short.  The VA shouldn’t have to count pennies when it came to helping veterans.  And Tony could help out a little.  In recognition of the men and women who had been with him in Afghanistan.  In recognition of Steve.
Tony walked in on Steve, dressing in uniform, leather gloves lying on the dresser.  He wore enough of his own armor to recognize what this was.  He walked to his side, a squire in a modern universe, tightening the brown leather straps, smoothing them down.
“Flying, No.  I really haven’t.  Ever.  Like I said, I don’t think my friends would care that much. They’re really the best.  But I don’t think my family would take it as well.  That would be a real blow to my family, especially my dad.  It’s hard to think that I wouldn’t live up to his expectations. That he’d be disappointed in me. Again. What about your parents? –Shell”
To:  A-Team
Dinner was a team affair, loud and boisterous, just the same as always.  Except that sometimes, he’d look over at Tony, and Tony would be looking back, the same private smile on his face.  Dinner turned into movie night, everyone clustered onto the couch and in the giant chairs.  Tony and Steve ended up on one of the couches, in their normal seats.  Steve relaxed into Tony’s side, holding his popcorn bowl where Tony could easily reach it.  Maybe he held Tony’s hand during the space scenes.  Maybe Tony squeezed his hand, grateful.
“Very good, Captain Rogers.”
“Steve,” he said softly, staying at the threshold to the kitchen. He wanted to give Steve space, clearly indicate that he wouldn’t try anything again.  That he wasn’t like Stern. Wasn’t like Howard.
On his way down the stairs, Jarvis alerted him.  “It matched Captain Rogers’s file, sir, the encryption key for the last file.  It appears to be encrypted by your father, and only has a ten digit passcode.”
Coffee.
The spark, the light that was in Tony’s eyes went out.  “Good job, kid. J, music.” He turned away from Steve and Steve felt the cool dismissal again.  Drums and guitars clashed, serenading his exit.
Tony grabbed his glass, and raised it in an ironic toast. “Better luck,” he said, derision just under control, and left Stern standing with his cronies. He checked his watch.  He could probably cut out in half an hour.  A little sooner if he promised Pepper he’d be early (on-time, to the rest of the world) to the next board meeting.
Bucky dragged his gaze away from Natasha, although his arm was still around her waist, keeping her firmly in his lap.  “Steve.  I am a happily engaged man, so you gotta trust me, ‘cause I am an expert, when I tell you—“
“Um, it’s about a year ago? Hey, we were there a year ago.  It’s the—“ he broke off suddenly.  “Holy shit, is that what I think it is?”
“I’m afraid I’ve had a momentary glitch in my system, Captain, and I seem to have erased all the footage of the house from the last few seconds. I do so apologize for the inconvenience, but I seem not to have gotten a recording of when Mr. Stane walked into that door,” Jarvis replied smoothly.
Pepper just sighed again, not quite rolling her eyes. “It really isn’t,” she told Peggy. “Everyone write your name on an index card, fold it—once,” she looked hard at Tony again, “and toss it in the hat.”
Tony’s friends were everything he said.  It didn’t change anything, anyway, only now Pepper’s parents didn’t care if he spent the night.  A small silver lining there.  They knew how to listen, and how to leave certain things lie.  Howard hadn’t been able to touch him—he’d disowned him, but he hadn’t been able to do anything. Matt Murdock was a goddamn genius, and Tony’s assets were ironclad against poaching.
“It’s no big thing,” Tony began to say, when Jarvis broke in, speaking over him.
In a manner of speaking? Well. Still. Maybe he shouldn’t look at the texts directly, but Jarvis could still help him out. “What’s the issue, J?”
“Peg, it’s okay, I’m fine,” he said, walking over to her, grasping her hands.
The bell pinged as Rhodey held the door open for Tony, sweeping his arm in front of him as if Tony were a princess.
And then it was just Steve. Steve pulled Tony to him, folded him into his arms, a small tremble that hadn’t been there before.  He sighed, kissed Tony’s hair, rubbed his hands down Tony’s back.
Steve picked up the gun. “Right.  Tony, I don’t want to ask it of you…”
“What’s he looking for?”
JustaShell: Someone else died.  And it should have been me.  It should have been me.  I’m the one who deserved it.  He died so I didn’t have to.  How do I live with that?
Except there was.
He drove the A4 over to Gapstow Bridge.  The night was cold, but a clean cold, not snowy, the air was dry.  The moon illuminated everything, reflecting off of the river, placid as glass.  He checked his phone.  10:42.  That was more than enough time, right? That was enough time for someone to hear about his little display via snapchat even if Flying hadn’t been at the dance itself.
“Tony? Tony!” Nat flicked his knee. Ouch.  He’d sort of lost his train of thought.  “You want a soda?”
That short walk was chaos.  On the way back to the tower, Tony finally gave up and called Steve.
You can’t imagine how glad I was to see an email from you.  Just hearing from you makes me feel better.  And you had great timing! I actually had a pretty crappy day today. No big deal, but seeing your email.  You just, you’re so true. You’re so real, even if we’ve never met.  In person.  I’m so lucky to have you. Not that I do, but you know what I mean.  It was a tough day for me.  How was yours?
“I gave you money to get a new one,” Tony started.
“Sir would probably appreciate a sandwich for lunch, if you were so inclined. The kitchen is this way,” Jarvis indicated. And now, Jarvis might be artificial, but Steve was definitely sure the voice was slightly amused again.  But he followed gamely along.  After all, this was his mess to clean up.  He could at least start by making Mr. Stark a sandwich.
Tony changed his passwords immediately. All of them.  He grabbed a snack from the kitchen, said hi to Jarvis and his mother, and locked himself in his room. He had an email.
“I wasn’t saying it was. I was just wondering about adding in a secondary program.  For when he’s just out in the neighborhood.  Like a tutoring program, or bilingual translations. Maybe he can earn some extra credit.”
Steve knew better than to assume the claw was just a claw, and nodded.  “Pleased to meet you, Dum-E.”
“I know, you know what I am, what I’m not, I don’t want you to feel pressured, like I told you at the beginning, I’m just a kid from Brooklyn, it’s all I am, but everything that I am I want to give to you, I just, I want to make the world better with you. I want to make the world better for you. If you want…”
Sorry, I had to fix a thing in this one, too.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Barnes,” Tony replied.
If he’d just been better. If he’d kept a closer eye on the business end of SI instead of sleeping his way through the calendar and drinking his way through the cabinet… Yeah, sure, not his fault.
“Bullshit, that’s not what happened.  I was there.  You took his side.”
Tony rolled his eyes, pulling a packet of dried blueberries out of his pocket. Might as well have snacks during the entertainment.
Steve blinked at him, clear blue eyes. Tony couldn’t even look directly at him, instead watching the skyline.  “Did I do something?”
I’m glad you had a good day.  I’m getting there.  And I’m sorry about the email thing, I was super busy, but I wasn’t disappointed.
“Pep, Virginia, boss lady, what can I, humble servant, do for you?” It would have gone over better if his mouth hadn’t been full of apple.
Damn.  He’d sort of hoped Bucky hadn’t caught that, but it slipped out.  Hard to think about
“This is the good stuff, son: Highland Park 50.”
“That’s all, Tony.” The line clicked at the same time as there was a knock on the door.
“Ugh,” Barnes grimaced, while Steve just made a face. Interesting.  So, not his boyfriend? “I’m the one who broke in. I should be the one to work it off. This isn’t about you!”
“I’m sorry I hurt you. I couldn’t let you. Not when it, not when it wasn’t him,” Steve continues, like he’s heard Tony’s thoughts.  The unfortunate side effect, Tony thinks, of working so well as a team.  Anticipating each other’s moves.
It wasn’t that Steve was pure exactly.  After all, someone who was pure wouldn’t withhold coffee from Tony—literally holding it over his head—until he ate something nutritious.  Someone who was pure wouldn’t stand possessively nearby when pretty reporters hovered, with a deceptively mild look on his face—a look that somehow told them to back off when they got too close. Someone who was pure wouldn’t kiss Tony, hard, purposefully, while they were both in uniform, wink at him, and then jump out of a plane straight into a battle.  Or tell him, in that low, Captain tone, to wait until they got home.  Or stand in the back of a summer press conference, slowly and calmly eating a pop rocket while Tony tried to concentrate.
“No phones at breakfast,” Steve told Peter for the billionth time.
The recording, scratchy and metallic, caught the loud, jolly sound of Iron Monger’s laughter.  “Yeah, it sure is, m’boy,” the American voice said heartily. “You’ll get your Jericho when you eliminate Tony Stark.”
Mr. Morita shrugged. “I have no idea. But it was super expensive.”
, Steve thought. He had been wrong.  This was worse.
Tony dragged himself out of the workshop that night. He hadn’t gotten anything done. His hair was wild but he didn’t care, he was heartsick.  Was he doing the right thing? Yes, of course, he was.  But the reactor was twice as heavy now, pressing down on him, weighing on him. Steve was brilliant and kind, generous and devoted, the stubborn ass. Steve had been the best of him, brought out the best in him.  He couldn’t breathe, now, thinking of how it would be, his bedroom cold and dark, without Steve and his goddamn paper books.  He couldn’t bring himself to open the door.
To:  A-Team
Steve swallowed.  “Yes.  I’m sorry.”
“Tony, I can’t—“
“Tony, I know who you are.  You wouldn’t want me, if you knew who I am. There’s no way you would want me. I’m sorry. I really hate to disappoint you.  Especially you.”
Tony didn’t really know how to respond.
“What do you want?” Tony asks instead.  Maybe it’s business.  He can handle business.
Tony picked up his head, turned so he was staring at Steve full in the face. There was that smile again, but a bit shy maybe, a wry upturn in the corner of his mouth.  “I love you.  Thought you already knew that. Thought I’d given myself away.”
, he commanded himself.
Clint didn’t even let her finish the sentence before he had a steak knife from the nearest table.  “Babes, just watch this.” With a flick of his wrist almost too quick to see, he’d embedded the knife deep in the ceiling and balloons poured over the dancers on the floor.  Chaos reigned.  And by the time Clint looked around to bask in his glory, the girls had both disappeared.
The armed man lay on the floor. Wasn’t moving.
Tony’s stomach flipped over.  Okay.  Not Pieter. Okay. That was okay.  In retrospect, he wasn’t all that cute anyway.  It was almost as if imbuing Pieter with the qualities he knew that Flying had, that’s what made him attractive.  But Christ, he’d been so sure.  It had all matched up so well.
“And I thought I wouldn’t see you here at all! I’m glad to see you here, and not working. It’s a great night, Tony!” Obie boomed. “And I think we’re going to get good news soon, for the company.  I don’t want to jinx anything, but I think it’s going to be time to celebrate soon.  Let’s have a drink now, for luck!” He pressed a very full tumbler into Tony’s hand.
“I was just, you know, collecting my phone from Coulson. Turns out our phones look a lot alike.  You’d never know the difference.”
Steve nodded.  “And the colonel.” Steve glanced down.  “And Happy. And Natasha, actually.”
“You shot him?” Rhodes asked Barnes, severely. Bucky and Natasha were both standing at attention, although technically Natasha’s gun was still pointed at Stane’s head.
(Mod)Wilson: Thanks for stopping by.  Anyone want to start off?
The night continues its watch, sheltering them in the deep protection of starlight, sex eventually giving way to sleep after Tony tries to express his revelation with his body, with his touch, as many ways as he knows how, and Steve seems to understand, tries to show him that they are in this together.
Feel free to leave comments.  You know.  :D
“Okay, Tony,” he said, mildly. “Breakfast in about twenty.”
“What am I, a soccer mom?” Tony complained, but no real fire in it.  Yeah, they could definitely pick up Jimmy.  He’d much rather his anonymous pen pal was Morita than Douchey McDoucheface.  If Flying was really Rumlow, he’d done a great job of layering on the asshole over the nice guy who was hiding inside.  “Sure, we can go get OtherJim.”
“How about make sure you eat breakfast today.  And tell that nice boy he did a good job.” She paused. “He seems very sweet, Tony.” There was an implied,
“Tony!” Mr. Morita exclaimed excitedly.  “You’ll never believe what I got in yesterday! Jimmy—go get that little box I put on the coffee table,” he ordered the kid in the back.  “Jimmy just finished his last college applications,” he confided in the boys.  “Says he wants to get a scholarship so I don’t need to pay for him to go to school.  I told him I didn’t mind, I’d handle it, but he wants to make sure he doesn’t have to ask.  He’s such a good son.”
“Huh.”  Tony eyed the pizza.  The crust looked crispy, with caramelized bits of tomatoes peeking out from beneath the bubbling cheese.  Pepper was a genius. He turned back to Steve, who seemed to have gotten himself under control. “All right, Brooklyn.  Show me what you got.”
different verse
Steve stifled a groan.  With a lapful of Tony, he was fully hard.  But as willing and eager as Tony seemed to be, he couldn’t. It wouldn’t be right.  Not when this was all a dream. Or maybe not a dream, but also not real.  “I love you,” he said, instead.
“I’m sorry.  I didn’t mean for it to sound rude.  But, jesus, I’d definitely know if Hamlet was gay, right?”
Steve smiled.  “You earned it. Besides, you’re on the swim team and student council and your grades are amazing.” Tony added another tally to his not-a-drug-reference list.
Double shit.
Love,
“Why did you bring a goat?” Steve asked, looking at what appeared to be a very confused goat now sitting on the conference table.
“Sure, Tones.  Just be careful, will you?”
Tony barked out a laugh. “Yes, I’m sure you are.  And I bet Batroc bought that, hook line and sinker.
Steve froze. “No.  Tony, no, of course not, I wouldn’t have…”
“Tony, Tony, Tony,” Obie drawled, walking over to his workbench. “That’s a publicity stunt! It was to shut the hippies up. We lose money there, every day. We need to get back to basics, Tony. We’re a weapons manufacturer.” Obie was shaking his head slightly, as if surprised by Tony’s naivete.
Tony was engrossed in the ultraglass; he’d managed to lighten it 20%.  “I’ve almost got this thing figured out.  Go ahead, I’ll be up in a few.”
Steve’s breath caught, Tony could feel it under his palm, a tremor running through his frame. After a moment, his chest rose and fell again, almost normal.  “I’ll hold you to that, Tony,” he said.
“I don’t want you to—“
“Yeah, and you got nothing to prove, right?” Barnes shook his head.  His expression was defeated, and looked like habit.  A losing fight he was used to losing.
She nodded at him.  Then looked at Steve, gaze gentle. “Captain, no one will come to harm,” she reminded him, and his heart eased a little.
He shut the door, leaving a perfect thumbprint on the handle, and followed Coulson up the stairs to the roof where a little red car waited. Lola, Steve surmised.
Tony reached up and kissed him quickly.  A perfect second kiss.  “I’m ecstatic that it’s you.” Steve’s lips were soft, the way they always looked, and he kissed like he did everything, sweet and purposeful.
Rhodey’s phone beeped at the same time as Tony’s vibrated in his pocket.  “Is it both of us? Read it to me, sugarbeet.”
“What are you doing here, Steve?” Tony asked when he recovered. He couldn’t tell how his voice sounded, grateful he could get words out at all, past the lump in his throat, the squeeze of it.
Apparently it was too late, Tony thought, his breath seizing in his lungs.  Apparently his heart was already broken. Thinking that tonight, he'd go to sleep, truly alone.  Tomorrow he'd wake up, and Steve wouldn't be there. There was no oxygen left in the room.  There was no point. He’d read somewhere that the pain receptors in the brain for emotional pain were the same as for physical pain. Now he knew it to be true. This was pain beyond imagining. He didn’t regret it exactly. Steve was worth it, every time.  But it hurt.  Worse than anything he could remember, and Tony’d been through a few rough patches. A deep part of him wanted to crawl his way into a bottle, drink it all away, but an even deeper need within him didn’t want to disappoint Steve still.  There’s the irony.
Pepper’s grin brightened.  She turned toward Tony. “Tony! I was so worried!”
“That was easy,” he muttered under his breath to no one. Taking off his safety glasses, he ducked under the accelerator and sat down at the worktable.  He examined the glowing triangle.  It looked stable. He grabbed a pair of needle nose pliers.
“Sorry,” Tony mutters.
“Tony, I. I’m just. You know what I am, you saw the photos.  That’s all I am. This is just a show, it’s not real.”
“What’s up, Rogers?” Mr. Stark asked, not looking at him and continuing to solder the small metal joint. “Wanted to see what it looks like in Death’s lair?” He was being a bit nasty, he knew.  Still, the accusation had stung.
Also, plot is about to happen soonish. I promise.
Mel: Sounds like a lot of pressure.  Just remember you’ve got friends. We’re here to listen.
How did she know? Or, what did she know?
Steve didn’t know what he had expected.  Disappointment, maybe, horror, shock.  He knew Abraham wasn’t violent, wasn’t a cruel man.  He was kind, and his tendencies ran liberal. But it was one thing to support gay rights in the abstract, and another entirely to have a family member be gay. What did his response mean? No way to know without looking at him.  Steve looked up.
“Tony Stark, you idiot, you could have told us! We love you, you know!” Pepper was teary.
“No,” he said, moving closer, smiling up at him.  “Graphic design, maybe.  I think that’s more your speed.”
“So what’s the big secre—Hey, isn’t that—hey!” Sam dropped all his shit at Tony’s feet and sprinted toward the door.
“Sure,” he said, mentally kicking himself for his own silent pun about being thirsty.
“—he told Steve to get out of his way, told him to move, and the sweet idiot just says, ‘No, you move,’ and lets the monster swing at him! Meanwhile Peter’s scampered off, like Steve told him to, because at least the child has a working sense of self-preservation!” Peggy took a deep breath, still clearly fuming.
It’s a little rich for her to say that, but she

“That kind of fall wouldn’t kill him,” Steve says, sighing.

that formal, but one of the other immortals calls in to check on him at least once a week. They don’t exactly hover, and they don’t even always call—Booker and Nile usually text—but there’s a definite mother-hen sense. Especially from Joe. Steve would be more bothered by it if he didn’t find it endearing. These people are soldiers, have fought together extensively for hundreds of years, and expect to have him with them as well. It’s touching rather. He just wishes Tony would deign to speak to him.
Stark looks pained, indecisive. It’s a terrible choice they’re asking him to make with little time to process it.
Steve meets Tony in his current safe house after Morgan’s college graduation. He did get to go to the official dinner with her, as did Bruce. Her girlfriend and boyfriend are both there too—a fact that amuses Tony to no end—and it’s a good time had by all.
I owe you all an apology for this taking so long. For now this is going to retain its rating (we'll see if it needs to go up), but I'm not sure how many chapters it's going to be now... ^_^;;
Banner doesn’t look like he entirely agrees, but he doesn’t argue. That’s the best Andy can hope for.
Bruce is around—of course he is. Steve is more than 90% sure that he keeps in contact with Tony too, even though Steve isn’t allowed to. It hurts, but it makes sense.
Which means that after everyone else has left after her sixteenth birthday, he’s not surprised she finally asks.
If Steve isn’t sure he should tell her that Tony’s alive, he’s absolutely sure he shouldn’t tell her what he says next, but he does anyway. He’s learned the hard way that keeping secrets from Starks does more harm than good. Keeping these secrets from Morgan for so long has been painful.
touch Morgan like that. She’s—” He stops himself abruptly because he knows how he feels about Morgan, and he also knows that Pepper isn’t going to like it.
“Taught her first aid?”
Steve tries really hard not to think about that and instead tries to focus on the fact he has his friend back for right now.
To say that keeping Tony Stark under wraps is a challenge is something of an understatement. Stark is used to going anywhere, doing
“They already do! He’s
Lips press into a thin line that makes the lines in her cheeks stand out and makes Steve realize how thin she’s gotten. Not that Pepper ever really had any extra fat on her to begin with, but she’s even thinner now. Steve is around as often as he physically can be for Morgan, but there is too much history, too much pain, too much of Tony between him and Pepper, and he had missed how much she is still grieving.
Maybe better not to ask that question.
“Because you gave them to me. I wasn’t going to tell you no. She’s your daughter.”

reach out, but honestly, they’ve been trying for nearly a decade, and he’s made no sign or movement to search for them. Maybe he really is an anomaly. Maybe he doesn’t see them. In any case, the world has gone crazier than they’ve ever seen, and it’s time to help others.
And another one of them is born.
Resigned, he says, “She’s like a daughter to me.”
“He’s not perfect,” Steve agrees. “But don’t doubt for a second that he loves you more than anything in the world.”
Captain America is a busy man, and he gets around
“They may assume it’s genetic,” Nicky says softly. “They may try to hurt your daughter.”
The situation is not helped by the fact that he has one of the most recognizable faces on the planet.
“I have no idea what you mean,” Steve says with as much dignity as he can muster.
"I just don't know what to
She doesn’t say it, but she doesn’t have to.
“Want to take bets on Tweedle-girl and Tweedle-boy?” Tony asks, in a surprisingly good mood. These celebratory events that he can’t attend can be hit and miss with him.
Something in Tony’s eyes changes, but he can’t quite read them. “Yeah,” he says after a moment. “She is.” Steve opens his mouth to say something like
“Why are you doing this, Steve?” Pepper asks after the last guests and well-wishers have shuffled out. Of course it’s been a huge to-do. It’s not surprising, what with it being both the anniversary of Tony’s death and end of the Blip. That it’s expected hasn’t made the day easier on Pepper, who had to play hostess all day, or Morgan, who had people trying to make her “feel better” all day. She’d spent the better part of the evening hiding with Steve.
Or maybe she just learned the hard way that money can’t buy everything.
“Yes, and looking rather mature for her age.” He stares, horrified. “You think I don’t notice how excited she gets when you go have your ‘dates’? What are you doing with her?”
“They’re friends,” Rogers says, and it even sounds like he believes it.
It starts with the first gift, but soon, Steve is giving Morgan two gifts all the time: the one from him, and the one from Tony. Pepper gives him side looks sometimes, but she doesn’t say anything. Morgan gives him looks too, and he’s pretty sure she suspects.
"I belong to the Church of Lilith."
"Did you not like it?" Tony asked, propping his head up on his arm. He was struggling to keep his eyes open but like they say, curiosity killed the cat.
He doesn't answer, reaching out to the plate, but the hunter draws it back. At least, he
Steven looks up at him then, blue steel meeting warm brown and Tony has to look away when something spikes inside him, hot and strong. He frees his hand from Steven's grasp, as the latter looks on.
it was okay.
A dull thud comes from somewhere outside the room just then, startling Tony. Straining his ear, he hears loud voices coming from below. His body reacts before he can and the hairs on his neck stand up. Before he can take action of any sort, the handle on his door turns and someone slips in.
Some seconds later, he felt Tony’s mouth leave his cock, heartbeat slowing as he came down from his high.
"Oh, don't act like you don't know," Tony retorts, rolling his eyes. He reaches over to grab the bottle but Steve pulls it away from his reach.
Tony thought, as Steve licked the skin of his neck again. Tony's hands immediately went up to fist the soldier's hair.
"Mrs. Rogers, I've got to say, I'm never going to like anything from the college cafeteria after this," he says, settling back into the chair, feeling drowsy all of a sudden.
"And that is why I need to know what coven you belong to."
Steve pushes in gently, moving slowly so as to not hurt Tony, until he's finally all in. Tony's eyes roll inside his head and his toes curl as Steve's length fills him in, his walls already spasming to accommodate the man.
Steve’s hand was still in Tony’s as he inched closer. Their thighs were touching again.
Tony's body tingles with electricity, feeling the adrenaline rush through him as his powers take control, ready to defend him. A billion questions burn through his mind and he blurts the first thing that comes to him.
,” Steve said, voice dropping, before looking away again.
Cool, midnight wind sweeps towards him and sends shivers down his spine but the euphoria of freedom keeps him warm. He steps outside, a little too excitedly, grin plastered on his face but is immediately flung backward into the hallway and lands on his back with a thud.
Steve looks up at that, blinking.
options.
Tony slides in next to him on the high chairs wordlessly. Steve watches silently as Tony takes the glass and brings it to his lips. Throwing his head back, he downs the liquid to its last drop, before slamming the glass onto the table.
Steve pulled away at that, eyes widening. Tony seemed to snap out of his daze as well, and blinked at him. His hair was sticking up in all directions and his lips were red and shiny. Steve cleared his throat, feeling his cheeks heat up.
? That'd suck as a tattoo."
Steve breaks into a smile at that, eyes crinkling at the corners. He nods his head vigorously and only then does Tony take his hand off of his face.
And, as much as he hates to admit it, Steve is right. If working with a hunter was the cost he had to pay to restore his coven's glory, so be it. There was a chance that Steve might be lying about setting him free, but he had to take the risk.
Tony bit down on his lip as he gazed at Steve. Blue eyes sheltered by long eyelashes that curved towards the sharp nose and those soft, plump lips were just inviting as ever.
Tony smiled up at him then, that gorgeous smile of his turning all of Steve in mush. He stroked him slowly, before smearing the leaking pre-cum around his tip with his thumb.
There's promise in the way he smiles at him, a little dazed but with such surety that Tony can't help but believe him.
"I.. I regret everything I have ever done. Perhaps, ma would've hated me for choosing this path. F-for wanting to avenge her. But she was my mother and I was seven. It's no excuse but.. if it hadn't happened...I wouldn't be here. Nor would you," he says, voice raspy as if he's struggling to get the words out.
Steve is messing with his head and a strange, new anger burns inside him.
Before he could ask him however, his eyes fluttered shut as Tony's tongue swirled around his head, taking him in and then pulling away. He licked thick stripes in his mouth, savouring the taste and Steve reached out to weave his fingers through Tony's hair. He tugged at it a little and Tony let his teeth rake over the sensitive skin, turning Steve's legs to jelly instantly.
He is barely settled onto the couch when someone calls to him from behind the shimmering drapes at the entrance.
"You were supposed to be on my side!"
"An oath bound to your blood; You will never bother me or my coven again, after I help you. Fail to deliver and your blood will turn to poison."
Steve presses a light kiss to his forehead and Tony feels grounded immediately, feeling some of the nervous energy seep out of him.
“I'm listening."
Steve has only ever heard rumors of people making such propositions before and never thought he'd be making one someday as well but hell, Tony's making him feel wild like he hasn't in ages.
The hunter has given him access to the entire house but he is still bound, unable to contact his coven or his familiar or anything that is not Steve.
Tony would've melted at his words if there weren't a million questions pounding through his head right now.
A force-field spell.
Steve's own eyes are a dark, dark blue and if Tony wasn't half blissed out, he would have kissed him again.
But there is so much warmth here, thawing the cold that has seemed to settle inside of Tony all of these years. There is warmth in the way everyone can't stop laughing around him, in the way that his hand lies entwined with Steve's in his lap, in the delicious food and in Sarah Rogers' kind smile. It is enough and so much more than Tony has ever known, he thinks he might combust.
this as complex as it might make things. He runs his free hand over the curves and lines of Steve's body, committing them to memory.
Steve says nothing at first, only looks grim and distant.
Steve leans over his back, pressing his dick against his thigh and continues to circle the hole, while sucking a spot behind his ear. He's such a slow tease, it's driving Tony insane.
Steve smirked against his skin, and Tony felt himself relax. He grinned up at the soldier.
Tony squints at Steve. "I've done things that I regret too, you know?"
"What were you two talking about?" Steve asks, throwing one arm around his mother.
Steve licked the shell of his ear, before leaning away again.
Tony knows that he should be hating Steve. That he should be poisoning the soup that's brewing before him, knows that he should run away from someone who could possibly be his mortal enemy.
"Why do-" Steve interrupts but Tony places a finger against his lips, silencing him. A tinge of red dusts Steve's cheeks but Tony's already slipping under the alcohol's influence and doesn't notice.
Tony sighs. He might as well let him know. He was at his mercy after all.
how was he supposed to think with Steve's hand on his dick?
"Is this okay?" he asked coyly.
Steve hesitates for a split second, but then starts moving slowly and Tony mewls, the friction already feeling a bit too much. Steve pecks his neck to soothe him and Tony's hands move to fist Steve's hair. Steve pushes again and his hands tighten around those gorgeous locks— an anchor to tether him.
"Let me show you."
Next morning, Tony finds Steve bent over himself on the floor, clutching his chest.
"Okay," he breathes shakily, trying to forget the storm in his head and focus on the fact that Steve had just asked him to move in with him. What.
He wasn't looking forward to any of it especially the meeting with the king of Wakanda, T'challa
Laughing, even more, Rhodey answered “it must be the emotions”
Ripping steve shirt open with surprisingly great strength, Tony pushed Steve onto the bed “What does it look like I'm doing” he said as he straddled steve's thighs and dove in for another kiss much like the kiss before Steve grabbed the bottom of Tony's shirt lifting it over his head throwing it onto the floor all while diving in for another kiss letting his hands glide down Tony's chest and grabbing his hips pulling him closer skin on skin made Steve shiver it felt so good.
“Woah Steve, you alright,” Natasha ask helping him get steady looking around he could see all of the others that were with him, Sam, Wanda and Natasha and they were still in the air with Sam behind the controls.
“Gamora,” she said.
It took then a short time to get to the factory with their suits looking around before they landed and with a boatload of confusion no guards or mercenaries came running out guns raised and ready to shoot not even so much as a Hydra agent in sight walking toward the door tony was surprised to see it wasn’t even guarded glancing at one another tony turned to head inside but was stopped with Rhodey’s hand “I don’t know tony this seems too easy”
Floating, it felt like he was on a cloud almost peaceful but there was a buzz almost like he jugged $58.000 worth of Dalmore 62 single Hiland malt scotch, he hated the unfocused feeling and the lack of coordination for better words his head throbs as he came too he realizes two things
Nodding the king straightened from where he leaned against “I can't give you my full support not yet at least but do as you must ill decide about the position you offered until then”.
A little bit of hate goes a long way
“No, look it's not like before Ultron had been influenced by a force we couldn't comprehend a complete unknown this, this is a standard A.I just like Friday and Jarvis just with an added Mobile and defensive parts”Tony explained hoping Rhodey would understand the need for J.J.
“I understand but what i dont understand is why are you doing this i have seen many mistakes the government makes with the mutants and the inchanted humans but even those have been handled by the Xmen quite efficiently too so why,” T'challa asked.
“We're going to have some fun with you stark, you know i think we developed a kink here i think ill call it the pregnant stark kink,” McCrawl said his hand gliding over his crotch landing on tony's stomach where his baby rest, a bile rose in tony's throat just thinking about what they wanted to do to him, oh god how can he stop them he was absolutely helpless he could barely move, the anger in tony rose as McCrawl's hand still rubbed his belly how fucking dare he touch his baby girl how fucking dare he touch him.
No matter how hard he tried to focus he couldn't get his damn brain to work but finally give up on the darkness sleep claims him
“No sorry boss” Friday responded the feeling of irritation got worse as he worked it was under his skin worming up his nerves, it almost felt like Tony blood was boiling with a swing of his arm tony knocked down everything he had piled and stacked, even with all the shit Ross had done he would still be able to get away with it.
Tony stark Gave birth to Me .
After being stopped by a few party members tony only caught the tail end of T'challa conversation with the other person before he swept in “Your Highness I'm glad to see you're enjoying yourself tonight” Tony greeting T'challa patting him on the shoulder tony could see the Dora standing close by if he didnt know who they were he would have easily mistaken them for guests.
”Alright, alright take the front if someone comes up ahead you can just get rid of them,” she said putting as much authority in her voice, pure relief filled her as the guard followed her orders giving it a few second following along the hall mason grabbed at the weapon forever grateful that they didn't use the safety, putting a bullet in the guards legs not watching as he fell she turned towards the other two nurses putting each a bullet in the shoulder, making sure they were down she threw away the gun and started pushing tony bed toward the meeting point, they had agreed to a meeting point that could be easily assessable.
°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°
Wakanda was an absolutely beautiful place with the mountains that almost surround the vibrant city that boomed with life and the people going about their day as if they didn't have a care in the world but he knew better everyone has problems.
“Not Completely sure Mr. Barton but I'll inform all of you if it's anything of importance but as I said to stay inside the guest wing,” T'Challa said before nodding his goodbye and leaving with his Dora bodyguards trailing behind.
Also attemp kiddnapping boy one hell of a suprize is coming
“I saw what had happened to uncle Bucky I saw him fall off the train,” mason said with a soft whisper tony closed his eyes he hated masons dreams some days showing her thing he hoped she never saw “daddy was very sad when he couldn’t save Uncle Bucky”.
Waking up tony felt fuzzy and sore his arms were above his head and he could feel a cold services on his back, there were metal bracelets on his wrists and ankles, his eyes were heavy due to the drug that was still in his system a flash of panic went through him hoping whatever they gave him didnt hurt his baby girl, opening his eyes slightly tony looked around the light was making his head throb he could see much with the way he was bound but he could make out a few details of the plain room, there were camera's all around the room tony tried to see through them but his head was still too groggy to get inside the technology behind them his head throbbed every minute he tried and tony felt himself starting to lose consciousness again.
<3 Time Skip <3
“Fire again,” A voice said from the box above “Kill him now”.
“You're quite the fighter Gamora, come let me help you,” the purple Giant said holding out his hand for her to take hold.
Tony watched his daughter play with the toys that laid in the principal office, Tony had wanted mason to have a childhood he never had gone to school have friends have good and bad grades, blushing at boys or girls it didn’t matter to him and rebel, enjoy her younger years but it seems she couldn’t even have that he wanted to protest and reject the idea but with the thought that it would hold her back and keep her from earning her goal’s he just couldn’t.
Nodding his head he recalled stark's pained gasp and Colonel Rhodes fast worried reaction to it and him almost leading tony out, always at touching length, like he was worried tony was going to fall over any minute “It would explain what we saw” T'challa said to Okoye she nodded as well.
Walking into the medbay the doctor was there along with vision worry echoing on his face ever since their heart to heart vision had been more and more support going to almost all of Tony's doctor appointments not really communicating just being there for him,Tony was glad vision had decided to stay with the Avengers instead of leaving on his own, the pain had gone away while they were in the elevator it had only lasted a few minutes which was strange Rhodey still brought Tony to the medbay just to be sure there was nothing wrong with the baby.
“the rogue Avengers” Ross answers.
After he was sick the torture began they had demanded he make them weapons, he refused, of course, he stopped making them because of this very same reason, innocent people get hurt and he didn't want any more blood on his hands than he already has.
Charles was going to tell bow to take a break when a piercing pain shot through their minds, pushing bow backward with force knocking him out cold while the rest of them held their hand to their heads.
“Yes it came back after I gave her dinner to say she was overjoyed was an overstatement,” tony said still not turning from the monitor “Rhodey come take a look at this”.
And meeting with Ashole Ross
“Maybe there is another way, ”Rhodey said and hope faded a little inside tony he really had hoped Rhodey would understand why they needed J.J.
Knowing at some point it was going to happen.
“See I told you” Shaking his head “Look I don't completely understand why you want to go but I will support you and dont even think I'm not going with you because I am,” Rhodey said giving Tony the no argument look.
Returning to Wakanda again Tony couldn’t say it was a pleasant feeling just as before his head started pounding with all the technology trying to get inside his head so tony had to shut of his mind again just to be able to think straight he had gotten use to all other country’s technology but with wakanda being so far more advanced he had trouble dealing with it but before he had landed there had been a tingle at the back of his head warning him of trouble but seeing as mason was safe with pepper and it was probably his subconscious warning him about the avengers tony let it go he would look into it later.
“ well that explains the doc's expression the other day he was surprised you're still alive and the baby is healthy” Rhodey Groused not really happy about what he heard the fact that tony still may die didn't sit well with him.
“shhh hay it was just a dream” moving forward and resting his head on tony's Steve looked into his eyes “everything is okay”
“TONY” Rhodey finally yelled out.
“Macie did that”.
“We can't operate on him now he's only 8 months it's too dangerous for both of them,” The woman said the irritation was clear in her voice as she spoke.
Still not completely believing what he was hearing“But you were in my head before when that kid looked at my memories and when we arrived” Tony said if Charles couldn't read inside his head maybe he didn't know about his baby girl and maybe he would be able to play it off as only his powers as much as he didn't like lie-ing to the professor he is a wonderful person and that goes a long way in his book he didn't want any more people knowing about his pregnancy or his child.
Roque Avengers P.O.V
“Mr. Stark”.
°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°
I don't own marvel only the oc
“ Yes meet Mason Maria Stark” Tony introduce them to there new extended family member.
Rolling on top of him steve start kissing his neck grabbing steve hips holding on for his dear life as he felt every inch of Steve on top of him and enjoying the sensation of Steves hard length grinding on his hip.
“I'm fine,” Tony said as he stood reaching for the unopened toothbrush, by the pinch of Rhodey's brow he didn't believe tony “don't worry gumdrop, its just morning sickness” Tony stated hoping it would assure Rhodey he was fine.
“No, hell we don’t even know how this works if it works,” Tony said looking completely helpless.
“Retiring,” Sam Wilson says completely dumbstruck after Tony meeting and in the rush, he had left in T'challa had come and informed them of the meeting T'challa didnt need to but he still did, however, he wished he didnt it only made Sam wonder more about what had happened in Siberia he hated thinking badly of steve not only because they were friends but he was also Captain America a hero, or so he thought.
“So while you are so saying having fun, the Avengers are rogue's, trying to save the world with no weapons or technical support or a roof over their heads and with 117 countries hunting them” Fury's glare grew colder by every clipped word he spoke, Tony needed to remind himself to stay calm, the absolute nerve he had to come to him and question him about his loyalty to the Avengers he had stood by the Avengers gave them the best he could make upgraded there weapons yes he had made mistakes but he tried everything in his power to make them right.
At al means, he was extremely proud of the little girl he sometimes just wished she couldn't walk yet then tony wouldn't be running after her every time she had to bath
Tony hated Hydra, No he despised Hydra if it was a person he would beat it over the head with a rock before killing it painfully, being tied to a table or so say bed again have lost its appeal, back then he would have loved being tied to a bed but now all he wanted was to be freed so he could go home, he didn't know for how long he was there he was 8 months along, but he knew if he didnt get out before he went into Labor they will take his baby away from him and use her for god knows what, over his dead body.
“I don't know pep, nobody came out yet with any news, I'm starting to get worried,” Rhodey said as he sat down placing his head in his hands.
“No, Not yet i still have a few things i have to settle before i announce my retirement but that's not what i wanted to discuss as i said i want to put a few changes in the accords due to bad parties being involved in the accord signing as well as you should know there will be some exposure going to happen in the days to come and i want you to be aware of it so it wouldn't catch you unaware seeing as your father, my condolences for your loss, was a big contributor to the accords and also the one who helped push it forward due to what had happened in Lagos, hoping i have your support in the changes i wanted to make for a good purpose i sure you” Stark says going completely down to business showing T'challa the ruthless businessman that had ran stark industries with an iron fist before potts had taken it over at starks say, it was impressive.
Rhodey shrugged walking closer to tony “yeah but you and I both know you have done plenty of crazy before this, but you know I'll always support you tones besides I'm going to be an uncle” Tony laughed at Rhodey. he will always be grateful for the family he has and he will do anything to protect them.
Sagging into a seat steve rested his head back letting out a deep breath it wasn't long after he felt the jet land frowning they couldn't be back already straightened out steve looked around the jet only to find it empty and the ramp was open, standing he walked cautiously out of the jet on the roof of the Avengers tower the elevator door was open as well confused he turned looking for some sign of the other but nothing so he headed toward the elevator once inside the door closed and started up taking him to the only apartment that was on the console Tony's.
Feeling the shake of his shoulder, tony jolted upright he felt refreshed like he slept but Tony swore he didn't sleep and by the unease in his gut told him it wasn't a dream.
Not to mention nausea, bloating and cramps the odd dreams, however, he can deal with they ward off the nightmares he's getting more sleep in then he had in years
“Mr. Stark”
He hoped not to be honest he really didn't want to find out knowing that he is either one of hydra lackeys or worse the madman debroski's kid gave him a bad taste in his mouth.
Watching the king leave an ache had settled in his chest tony was going to be in Wakanda and Steve wouldn't be able to see him he did regret the way they had left things the way he left leaving tony behind it wasn't the way he wanted thing to go but it had and he couldn't take them back, Bucky was his best friend his brother and the most important person at the time thinking back to the fight he should have realized tony wouldn't have killed bucky but I'll he could think about was protecting him.
There were so many reasons he needed to protect his baby girl, he hated that she would be growing up with his enemies looming over her he needed to be sure she was protected, building a suit within J.J frame was a challenging move but it was a success when she was in danger she or tony could activate the protector protocol  and the suit will ensemble and take her to safety
Finishing her milk tony headed back to Mason only to freeze, mason's playpen was empty,“oh come on not again” tony placed down mason's bottle searching where she could have disappeared too, it wasn't the first time it had happened either, the first time she had just suddenly disappeared Rhodey had just given mason her dinner and had placed her in her playpen before bed when he had returned to get her she was gone.
“Yeah” that was all tony could muster up.
“Tony, Tony are you okay,” pepper asked worriedly her hand cupped his cheek.
Shaking her head“No the Dora just told us the king requested our presence I know not to ask questions” Natasha said turning her head toward T'challa arrival followed by his Dora bodyguards.
~~~&~~~
This story is pure fan fiction
“Tony this doesn't rely on good, time,” Rhodey said but was completely frozen by what Tony had to say.
{Tony} And when shield is back ill make sure there is no way hydra can infiltrate it again.
Before T’challa could say anything about Tony’s proposal Tony’s phone went off and the tingle at the back of Tony’s head went from tingle to pounding headache that pulsed with pressure looking down at his phone tony saw it was pepper that was calling.
“I'll never agree to be apart of this if i knew what hydra had planned, what you people did is inhumane and wrong no child should be used the way hydra want to use this one you're disgusting” mason said with disgust and hate in her voice.
“You care about them after everything they did to stabbing you in the back leaving you to die and skrewing with your mind after all that you are willing to help them” Rhodey Roared with rage
“Arent you supposed to be out, how did you get in,” Tony asked he didn't want Rhodey to see him as this Ross had never gotten to Tony before but Today was a bad day he felt uncomfortable like everything was pushing to tight on him and pulling.
He could not take the smell of bacon and eggs anymore as tony bolted up from the bed making a dash for the bathroom he barely made it to the toilet before puking the last of his half-eaten dinner out Tony sat back against the cold tile his stomach turned again and he swallowed the groan,
°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°
A little suprize and a reveal of many things to come
Glancing at the clock Tony noticed it was only early afternoon and he was already bored“ Okay Peach its time for a walk” Tony said sliding out of bed feeling the numbness in his legs as he stood he hated the feeling“Let's see if we can get Friday will let us in the workshop huh”.
“ if you'll just lay down for me we can get it started” laying back on the bed as the doctor got the equipment ready,“now Mr. Stark this will be cold”he stated as he applied the cold clear gel to his stomach
“ Are you okay tony you seem a little distracted ”
“yes let's get this over with,” Tony said as he opened the doors and walked through standing near the podium tony waited for pepper.
He also needed to look after the baby he couldn't just defend himself when he was attacked he needed help and as much as he hated to take Rhodey away from his therapy but he needed to get Rhodey out from time to time.
Back handing the moron dared to make an excuse for losing his most valuable subject.
Charity balls
“Charles?” a voice called next to him, turning his head he looked at hank he shook his head to clear the fog Charles to wonder what had she meant about mason destiny and only she could discover it and that she had survived for a reason made his gut clenched mason will always be in danger due to her gifts she had but was this another stone in her path of life or was it the meaning of her end he sure doesn’t hope so to lose such a brilliant, sweet, and kind child would be too much of a loss for the world she could do so much in this lifetime and she had wormed her way into his heart he couldn’t even think about losing her “Charles are you okay” hank ask again.
Hi sorry it has been very long I didn't really like how I changed it before so I redid it I'm so pleased but while I did it I got a nasty stomach virus that made me sleep a lot anyway I made it longer added a few twists and a couple of surprises so I would read it from the beginning  thanks for reading
Nodding “yes I have seen it a few times but what do you expect us to do exactly”.
Turning towards Rhodey and pepper who was sitting at the far end of the table barely containing their laughter at his struggle “this is ridiculous she doesn't want to eat this shhh...irt she doesn't even want to try it” Tony said glaring at both of them and covered up his near curse word, it was not funny he needed a new supplement for Mason one that would make her full and keep her healthy.
Two Years Old
Walking around the nursery tony rocked Mason gently waiting for her to fall asleep the love he felt holding his little girl was unlike anything he felt for anyone before, it scared him but also he couldn't care he loved the feeling he didn't want it to stop
“I thought Ross would have already spoken to Bartons family”.
Settled in the common room jean had left to get them beverages (Mostly tea since Tony couldn't have coffee) he had a buzzing almost like static sound in his ear he couldn't get rid of it was bothering tony and it was getting louder.
Why can't life just give tony just one little break before it throws him in hell is it too much to ask or is it to much fun to screw him over?.
*Macie, Sweetheart can you hear me* tony thought almost holding his breath waiting for an answer.
