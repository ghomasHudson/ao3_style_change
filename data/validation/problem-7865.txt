A few weeks later he took Steve on a surprise trip to his house in Hawaii, kissing him beneath the palms, as the soft sound of the waves crashed on the shore like a lullaby.
“Your gods did not smile on you today, Ivor,” Stíofán said, trying not to sound too smug, but by the sour look on the other Satyr’s face, he didn’t manage it.
Trying not to show his mortification, Tony nodded. “Of course! I’ll go get you something.”
He must want Tony to ready himself. Tony nodded, getting up and heading to the bedroom to rifle through his trunk. He had prepared for this.
Now that the battle was over, Tony set to finding Steve. He hoped that he’d just been pushed to the side and was further along.
A number of the residents smiled at his arrival, a few giving little waves, Steve trailing behind him pushing the trolley with the carriers carefully stacked. He tried to keep a friendly smile on his face, but all he could see was his true age reflected back at him.
Stíofán tried to ignore it as he stripped off, making sure to scrub the dry blood from his hocks.
“We’ll improvise.”
“Going nowhere,” Tony finished. “Computer, lock door.”
Deputy Barnes glared at Steve, clearly catching on to the trick, but he shook his head dutifully, clearing his plate and reaching for a glass of punch to subtly wash away the taste.
They wrapped Peter up in the blanket Tony had carried him in and in a pair of socks borrowed from the Doctor’s neighbours. Peter was trying to be good, but it was clear he was getting fussy.
Tony nodded, “Absolutely,” as he pulled out a small basket he didn’t use much and filled it with soft fabric scraps from his attempts at learning to sew. He settled the pup in and placed him next to the stove to keep warm. “Outside, you got it.”
“I--”
“Uhhhh—“
“Ana’s sweets, and trust me you’re going to love them.”
It was something to think about.
He wished he’d had a chance to get Anthony’s likeness so he knew who he was looking for. Brooklyn Junction wasn’t a big town by any means, but they were the nearest station for the surrounding areas, so the train could get a mite busy.
He was distracted, looking longingly out the window, and Steve gave him a nudge. “That food will do its job better in your belly.”
“Are you sure I’m not too heavy?”
He could remember his own schedule. Definitely. He had a...ummmm…“Late for...?”
“I’ll walk him down, Pep,” he said, waving her on. “You’ve got another meeting.”
Stíofán shook his head. “That’s cruel, so cruel. I’m going to be out providing shelter to a new family and you would take my food from me?”
As he walked the long line of the pen, he noticed one in particular. He was at the end, fleece black with white flecks. Stíofán could see ample thighs, and dainty hooves, and the suggestion of a shapely behind beneath the fabric he wore. Stíofán looked up from his perusal, finding himself looking into a pair of inquisitive eyes. The doe looked at him, ears flicking beneath dark curls. Stíofán felt desire pool in his belly. This one. This one he could imagine fighting for. He let himself imagine it, the faun baring himself to Stíofán in his cell, being able to mount him after a long day of fighting, and the sweeter side of having a bride, having someone to talk to, banishing the loneliness Stíofán usually felt as he dreamed of home. As he let himself look at the doe again, their tail flicked twice, and Stíofán had to focus so as not to embarrass himself. He let himself drink him in for just a moment more before he returned to the line. That doe would be his. He swore it.
Tony scowled at him. “Don’t you dare!”
It was an odd thought, one he hadn’t really let himself have until now. But, he liked it here. It was quiet and peaceful in a way he hadn’t felt in years and the people here were kind to him, offering their friendship to him not even knowing who he was or what he’d done. They treated him like Steve, and that meant something to him, not to be weighed down by expectation and just able to be a guy people liked talking to.
“I—“ Tony said, and then tensed up, slipping sideways.
Steve gave him a self-deprecating smile. “Sorry I couldn’t say anything.”
The town was just as nice as Mr Jarvis had said, Steve realised as he wandered down the Main Street. A charming vibe, with many of the shopfronts reminiscent of Steve’s time, though kept in much better condition. There were only a few cars passing by, meaning the town was mostly peaceful but it still had a pleasant bustle, and Steve found his shoulders relaxed, the constant fear of sticking out dropping away as he gave a woman a friendly nod.
Tony scoffed, not wanting to dignify that with an answer. Like he hadn’t shown up to every parade and ceremony Steve had asked him to, even when the threat of redeployment had loomed.
Stíofán tucked him under his chin with a chuckle. “Wish you were back in Aquileina?”
“We’ll do whatever we want, because we can, and you can’t do anything about it,” the second one said and leaned down to grab the bike. As he did, Rogers snapped, his fist striking out to hit the man and sending him stumbling backwards. “You little—“
For a minute it was absolutely perfect.
The Sheriff smiled, putting on his hat and offering his arm. Tony slipped his hand into the crook of his elbow and started their way into town.
“What and he was alive? After seventy years?”
The heat from it felt like a brand.
“Too much?” Though he didn’t let go. He grasped it tighter and jerked it.
“And yet you think going to Coney Island, where you’d be shook around like ice cubes in a cocktail shaker on every ride, will
“You didn’t see him. Soft fleece, dark hair and nicely curled horns. Fluffy tail. Gorgeous.”
“Let me get dressed. I’ll be out in a moment.”
“Like you wouldn’t believe.”
Tony slumped into the cafe, feeling exhausted.
And maybe this could be enough. What they had now. Maybe they didn’t have to have pups or be together in the same way other married couples were, even though Tony longed for the hot intimacy of their first night. They were married in the eyes of God, and they clearly both cared for one another.
“Of course. Let me walk you out.”
“I’ll leave you to it,” Coulson said, looking amused, and he handed Steve what looked like a blue jacket. “You might need this when you head out.” He gave Tony a nod and headed off to speak to some of the other agents.
“I think kids these days call that ‘duck face’,” Bucky said, shaking his head. “If this is how we’re doing on the warm-up shots, I can’t wait to see what you do when you have to start actually taking your clothes off.”
He launched off, feeling the magic flow through him and propel the broom into the air. As the lights of his village disappeared into the distance, Tony felt a surge of anticipation. This was his chance. He was going to show the world what his magic could do.
“Sure dad,” Tony agreed, trying not to roll his eyes. His father wasn’t a witch, didn’t come from a witch family, but he always seemed to think he knew best. It came from his success, in fairness to him, of starting a witchcraft business that was well known in the community. It had been his parents’ pride and joy before he’d come along, his mother providing the know-how and skill, his father the business acumen. But running a magic shop didn’t make one a witch, and his dad always seemed to forget that.
He would’ve been able to counter it without a thought on any other day, but it was like his brain was falling into a fog. He was hot, and a little dizzy, and all he could smell was Tony.
“Tony! You’ve got a guest!”
“Sure. I’ll saddle Nomad for you.”
“Ah, ah,” Stíofán admonished. “Got to keep it down, or you’ll wake the little ones.”
“So what do you do all day?” Tony asked, scarfing down his bowl.
“Just a guess.”
Stíofán tossed another log on the fire, checking for stray coals around the edges before heading over to the fabric sheet that hid their bed. The partition was an unusual addition since the houses were usually all one room, but Tony had grown used to his privacy after the Stables and hadn’t been ready to give it up, which Stíofán understood. He heard the swish of the fur at the entrance as Tony returned with the bowls, tying the fabric behind him to block out the chill. Stíofán stripped off his shirt and the thick trousers he wore, shivering as the cool air crept over his skin.
“I think Nat said she watered it yesterday.”
“That’s gotta take a lot of work. You must be pretty smart.”
we can go - if your arm is better. But Steve, baby? I need you to stop insulting guys who are beefier than you. And travel in packs.”
Tony felt himself pulled into awakeness by an uncomfortable warmth.
This had been great at first, Peter running around all the brightly coloured plastic and climbing the shiny structures, but when he’d climbed onto the monkey bars, Tony felt a beat of panic and stood up from the bench.
Why did it have to happen like this?
Tony looked pleased. “She likes you.”
“If anything goes wrong, California has divorce. I can leave.”
“Pretty sure.”
“Never talk to me, or my plant son, ever again.”
No more family dinners on Sunday with Nana, or brunches out at Sam’s. No more engineering binges with Dad in the workshop or art projects with Pops.
“You know I could probably help you out,” Steve offered, looking at the men. “Seems to me I could probably use ropes and the bike and get it done.”
Bucky handed Hugh to Tony. “I think we’re done for the day. Take your brood home before the small ones give me a damn heart attack.” He wandered off towards his parents’ house with a wave.
“Yeah, but you know what? It’s not so bad. When I was getting better, I got lots of stories, and I got to eat pie and custard for dinner for being so brave.”
“Go try her out.”
“Yeah. It’s for one of the charities we work with that uses our Medtech. It helps them, and it’s our last chance to build hype for the StarkScan before it goes live next month.”
“A 1942 Harley-Davidson WLA Liberator. It’s, uh, vintage.” Steve had learned early on that word was basically a free pass.
“I think I can swing it.”
“Steve, what the hell are you doing?”
“You can see the ropes straining at the posts, and the ground crew is trying to secure them,” the reporter’s voice said over top. “It’s being battered by the gusts, and if you see there--” the camera zoomed in on the cockpit, “we can see the crew in the cockpit are looking very nervous.”
Steve jumped as the magazine hit the table in front of him with a
“There are
“Wow Cap, when were you going to tell us we were living with a GQ’s Sexiest Alpha winner?” Clint asked cheekily. “I might swoon.”
Tony grinned. “That looks like just the place. Good spotting J.”
Tony walked down the street, trying to ignore the curious eyes following him. He was carrying the basket with Steve’s dinner in it, hurrying along to keep the bread warm.
“Yes beloved,” Stíofán answered dutifully, moving over to the long-suffering animal.
Tony wanted to say that it was Steve he would miss: that this house would be empty without his warm, comforting presence. That losing him would break Tony’s heart.
“Can’t believe I missed out on a doe, I’ve been here ten years and this young buck just up and nabs the first decent opportunity I’ve had. My balls are about ready to explode the amount of use they’ve had.”
How about that. He’d stopped fixating on it, and it had happened. Steve was right, his big brain was one for brooding.
He stayed close till he felt the muscles unlock, letting Tony stand on his own two hooves. “What did I just say?”
Tony flew closer, only to pull up short when a laser burst struck the front of the suit. “Hey! Watch it, you radioshack rejects! Planty is in there!”
“I figured brave heroics were worth a slice of chocolate cake. Seemed only fair.”
The sun was low in the sky by the time Tony could see Peter starting to flag so he approached them. “Getting tired kiddo?”
that does not send a champion.”
“Oh yes.” Bucky raised an eyebrow at him. “You want me to help, we’re doing this my way. That means proper lighting and some fucking costumes.”
And it’s not like that was unreasonable, but well. It wasn’t exactly Tony’s first rodeo when it came to people he trusted keeping secrets. Ty, when they’d dated at MIT, would often be away on “business trips” with his father, frequently going away at the last minute. Tony had been fooled for about six months before he’d realised that unless Ty’s dad was also a red-headed philosophy major, there wasn’t any business taking place. Well, not the suit-and-tie kind anyway.
Tony felt a swell of emotion. “And you're sure?”
The last was directed at the alpha who entered, somehow covered head to toe in mud. Tony stared in surprise, but both the deputy and Steve broke out into laughter.
“Don’t worry about it, I get it. I’ll work something else out.”
That voice. Tony could bathe in that deep, smooth rumble. God, he clearly needed to get out and date more if this was his reaction to some hot guy.
Tony made a note on his tablet with a smile. “Alright, how about you pull her out and I’ll take measurements?”
“Tony--”
“I’m not doing that.”
Steve shook the Doc’s hand when they arrived at the surgery, letting Tony in ahead of him to see Peter for himself.
Hope you're enjoying it so far!
“I’m Kamala Khan, I’m majoring in biological engineering and I’m from New Jersey.” She looked pointedly at Maria.
When the peak finally came, Tony slumped forward, wrapping his arms around Steve’s neck and pressing his face into his neck as he panted. Steve knotted easily, the stimulation of Tony’s twitching muscles enough to push him over the edge. He held Tony tight, murmuring praise into his ear, and once they were locked together, he laid them down, pulling the covers over to keep away the chill.
“Oh I see.” Tony tugged off his cloak, folding it by the door before grabbing his own bowl of stew. He went to sit by the kids but Stíofán reached out, pulling him to perch on his knee.
He stepped back. “We need to celebrate.” He grabbed his keys off the counter. “How about you guys take the truck and go grab us a pizza, or something from Sam’s? Go and tell Nana on your way home and bring her over, she won’t want to miss it.”
Steve felt more aware of the difference in their size than he ever felt before. Tony looked so small and fragile, and Steve felt big and awkward and unsure how to fix something he couldn’t fight. He crouched down, slowly sliding an arm around Tony’s shoulders. “Sweetheart?”
“Some of the locals got a little too raucous. Steve stepped in, but they didn’t take too kindly to it since he’s had run-ins with Hodge and his crew before, so someone got a little too excited and decided to make a point. Sam took the guy to the office and locked him up. He’ll face the judge: don't you worry.”
“Mind if I grab a shower?”
The man shook the gun. “Look, don’t fuck around. Just give me the money.”
Oh. “So we are not expecting a happy announcement anytime soon?”
Steve wasn’t quite sure what that meant, but he could sort of guess from context. “I didn’t used to look like this. I was pretty small and they never really paid much attention to me. Then I was overseas so didn’t really get the chance.” That was probably too much information. He reluctantly cleared his throat. “I guess I should really head over to the motel; It’s getting late.”
“I just never expected this, I can't believe you're for real.”
Tony pretty much forgot the incident after that, except to tell Pepper about the fight. He’d been too caught up in the sound of Steve’s laugh, the flush of his cheeks when Tony complimented him, the heady scent of his skin when he let Tony lean against him in the car back to the tower.
“Good luck,” his dad said, and his voice sounded a little rough. “I know you’ll do us proud.”
She held the phone out and her brother took it, still rubbing his hair dry one-handed with a towel.  “Hi Nana.”
Before Tony could answer, the first omega scowled. “It seems my cousin has forgotten her manners. I’m Miss Foster, and this is Miss Lewis.”
He shouldn’t.
Tony looked at them, a little confused. They didn’t look much like the farming folk he’d seen come to town to deliver goods for market. Too bookish for farm labour. His confusion must’ve been clear because Miss Lewis laughed.
He felt the last piece click into place and stepped back. “All done. She should run like a breeze.”
“It was going to hurt either way. Better to do it all in one go.”
Steve’s head whipped around to look at him. “Really?!”
“No! My room! Steve is in my room!”
Because his omega was coming today.
Rhodey made him stay put until Sam returned, watching him eat a bowl of oatmeal before he was allowed to leave.
The band was already playing, and the place was bustling with townsfolk. Tony got many looks, some admiring, some tinged with envy, but that hardly mattered, because he had the handsomest Alpha in town. Steve cleaned up nice in his good slacks and dark blue waistcoat and jacket. The cut accentuated his broad shoulders and narrow waist, and Tony felt pleased they were such a handsome pair.
“Mrs Wilson told me it’s important for healing.” Tony grabbed the basin of water and a cloth and placed it on the bedside table. Then he began to unbutton Steve’s shirt.
J.J stepped out of the way, just in time to dodge Dad sweeping her up and clutching at her like she might disappear.
They pushed open the door, a little bell ringing overhead. The shop was bustling, a few customers lined up while a man with a friendly smile greeted and served them. It was much friendlier than the town had been so far, and Tony found himself relaxing for the first time since they’d arrived. The smell of fresh bread and sugar was on the air, and he breathed in deep, the delicious smell making his stomach grumble.
Pepper sighed, walking around the bed to put her hand on his and wrapping her fingers around his. She took the silk waistcoat from him, shook it out and refolded it, her hand smoothing over the soft material before she tucked it into the bag.
“Hello?”
He turned a corner, and his eyes fell on a guy with a large smile on his face.
“It’s not nothing. You’ve fainted twice in an hour. Tell me what’s happening.”
“So please, tell me about yourself?”
Steve looked at him and then snorted. He slipped his arms behind Tony’s legs and lifted him in one move, Tony’s weight seemingly nothing to him. Tony stared down at him, legs coming around Steve’s hips on instinct, arousal flooding through him. “How--how long can you do that for?” he rasped.
Hugh slumped in his arms but rolled his head back to look at Ma upside down. “Sorry nana.
Steve reached out, and Tony let himself be tugged into the alpha’s lap. “I know you don’t blame me for being away when Peter was sick--”
Stíofán made an effort to enjoy himself. Tomorrow might be his last day after all, why not indulge a bit. He found himself sitting on a few cushions, his arm around Tony as he sipped his wine. He was careful not to overdo it, he needed to be on form tomorrow, but he had a pleasant warmth in his body, and he was more prone to a laugh as the bucks around told jokes and stories.
And then licked him, making him squeal. Tony slumped in relief, his heart still hammering. “Jesus Christ.”
Forgiven?
Tony looked back. “Oh yeah. You probably want one of the deputies to deal with that.”
The hand looped through the thin straps of his right shoulder, then his left, and soon the soft material slipped down, revealing the whole of his chest. He felt as though his face must be on fire: never had he been so naked in the presence of an alpha. He had to turn his head away, unable to look him in the eye. He’d never felt like this before. Hot and needy.
“Oh? I’m not sure I understand.” S’Teve’s ear pricked up at the statement, though he kept his gaze on the surroundings, keeping an eye for security threats.
“Yeah,” Tony breathed, a wide smile taking over his face. “I knew you’d find me.”
Rhodey also shared that Steve had apparently waited for more than an hour and a half before he accepted Tony wasn’t coming. Tony felt oddly guilty, though he couldn’t have helped it.
Tony appeared at his shoulder, though Steve had no idea how he’d noticed he was struggling. “Hey, you ok?”
Steve huffed a breath, fogging up his glasses as he did. “Yeah well. I’m over that now. If the airforce won’t take me I’ll fly anyway, and I’m going to do something better with it. I’m looking at a private license: see if I can’t try my hand at dropping medical supplies to remote areas, that sort of thing.”
. Everyone saw.”
“Yes, you did or we’d go home remember?”
Pushing open the door to the Sheriff’s office, he stopped at the sight of Carol sitting at the chair across from Steve at his desk. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to interrupt.”
“And maybe do a little debriefing of our own?” Tony asked, wiggling his eyebrows.
But Peter was four now, nearing five. And still an only child.
“Of course.” Coulson flicked his hand over a screen and an image of a huge shapeless
“You couldn’t have known. Pups go downhill quick, but they bounce back fast too. Just gotta keep him cool and give him the tonic and hope for the best.”
Peter looked at his bowl. “All gone.”
Stíofán stared up at him. He was so beautiful. Those eyes, his well-kept beard far more fetching than Stíofán’s, the cute horns that poked out from the unruly curls on his head. And, as Stíofán’s hands held his hips, the just noticeable bump that held their future inside it.
“Mom always said the first step was to go to the town square and announce yourself as the new town witch. So I guess we do that, and I’m sure we’ll know exactly what we need to do. Perhaps when we meet the mayor I can make his car better, show off what I can do.”
“Maybe we need to--”
Tony paused. “What? Of course you -”
“Let’s take lunch at the restaurant,” Steve suggested, and Tony was only too pleased to agree. They were ushered to a small table by the window, and Tony didn’t miss the look he was given by the omega serving them. She looked him up and down pretty clearly, taking in his clothes and shoes, and wrinkled her nose, only for a moment, but it was enough.
He followed quickly, buffeted by the wind. The new broom was good, but the winds were strong, trying to shove him off course. He pushed forward, trying to get to Steve, one gust ending him into a spin. He pulled out of it, hearing Steve’s concerned calls.
“One of the first of its kind. It’s a step up from our planes — that’s for sure.”
“Excuse me a moment, Deputy, I need to identify the weak spots.” Tony tried to lean underneath but grunted as the corset dug in and kept him upright. “This awful thing!” He looked over to Deputy Barnes. He tugged his shirt free of his trousers. “Deputy, you got a knife?”
Bucky sighed but dutifully ducked out from behind the camera. He reached over and placed one of Steve’s arms on the back, and then rested the other on his thigh so it hid some of what was on offer. “There, now it looks like you’re teasing him.”
And the day before that.
Peter was a constant heat against him, and the struggle of carrying him there had left Tony exhausted. His legs felt like gelatine, and he stumbled, trying to keep his feet. There was pressure on the toe of his boot, and he felt a stab of panic as he caught himself on a stone and went flying forward. He panicked, instinctively rolling his body to buffer his pup against the fall...
“Why didn’t you say anything?”
“No,” he breathed, looking at the giant gash on Steve’s back that was steadily oozing blood onto the concrete underneath. “No no no, Cap - stay with me, okay, we’ll get you -”
He waited. And waited. And waited.
“John, this is Steve. He’s ex-military so I bet he’d love to hear some of your war stories.”
“It’s a long journey to California.” Pepper grabbed a pair of his finest boots and added them to the pile. “Are you sure you’ll be alright, travelling alone?”
“I could--” Tony began because this was his chance. If he could show Steve he could be good at it, maybe Steve would think again about having intimate relations.
If he got caught in the rain, he would no doubt catch cold. Despite Jarvis’ best efforts, Rogers was still as slight as when he’d first arrived at the estate.
Tony squinted suspiciously at the small arms wrapped around the pile and shook his head. “Nah, I live in the penthouse. I just figured I could use a coffee and a snack.”
“Oh.”
Ceiling? What did he--
“Oh, it does? Doesn’t seem to stop 200,000 kids a year being sent to the emergency room for playground-related injuries every year does it?”
“Neither, I’m just passing through. I’m on a road trip, East Coast to West.”
There was no time to react before Steve was tugged away, mouthing ‘sorry’ at them before he disappeared into the crowd.
“No, no, no, don’t you-- eeek!” Tony clung to him as Stíofán lifted him into the air, spinning him until the faun shrieked with laughter.
He had just put his purchases in his saddle bags when he heard a commotion up the street. He squinted to see what was happening but couldn’t make it out. There were people crowding around in a circle, and he could hear shouts. He untied Ana and wandered over, curious as to what could have everyone in such a tizzy.
“Maybe I’ll see it someday,” Tony said, though the tone implied he thought it was just wishful thinking.
“Do I have enough time to grab a coffee from the good barista on floor 60?”
“World’s largest ant colony,” Luis said, his chest puffing with pride. “My friend Scott made them a little city to live in. It’s rad.”
“I don’t know.”
marking their place, and putting it aside. He took the pup first, putting him into his bed and tucking him in, giving Oscar a little pat when the dog jumped up to lie beside him to keep watch. He gave Peter a kiss on the head and pulled the door mostly closed behind him.
“Mr Rogers!”
“It’s nothing, I just—“
Steve scowled. “What do you want Tony? Haven't I been embarrassed enough?”
Her phone lit up and she looked at the new message. ‘
“Sam, status!”
At the word, Steve’s stomach started to rumble and Tony snorted. “Seriously, already?”
“Steve!” Deputy Wilson came down the road, leaping off his horse. “You alright?”
Tony and Steve started hanging out more and more in the evenings.
“I could never be seen betting as the pastor’s omega, Mrs Jones,” Mr Murphy said haughtily. “But if I could, I’d call it easy money.”
Eventually the Sheriff pushed him onto his back and settled over him. He still looked a little unsure, but he dipped down, brushing his lips over Tony’s bonding gland and making him shiver at the sensation.
“Please?”
Tony smiled so brightly it was almost blinding. “I thought you’d never ask.”
“Tony,” Steve cut him off with a stern look. “A word?”
Tony flushed behind his mug, looking around the room. His eyes caught on the clock and snapped wide. “Is that the time?”
Stíofán groaned. If they were still preparing it was very early. He gave Tony a nudge. “We have to get up.”
“Let me.” Tony got up, grabbing a cloth and basin from the table by the door. Steve opened his mouth to protest, but Tony shushed him, putting them down on the bed beside them. He brushed the wet cloth over a few scrapes on Steve’s neck. “Seems like you’ve been through the wars.”
“Shut up,” Steve told him, scowling. He grabbed his sketchbook and headed to his room, knowing he was going to inevitably add to his collection of Tony sketches.
Steve released a shaky sigh. “Ok. Ok, I get it. Is he going to get better?”
“Captain Rogers,” a voice called from down below. Coulson’s, Steve realised. “We have to go.”
“If you don’t go, I will actually make a scene. I’ll stand up, wave my arms, cluck like a chicken, there is no way America’s Ass over there won’t notice.”
“That’s real kind of you, Ms Maximoff,” Steve told her, manners impeccable as always. “Perhaps you might have Tony over for some of those Sokovian steamed buns you make as well.”
“I’m trying, okay? What am I supposed to do?”
He awoke instead to a retching noise and sat up to find Tony bent over their water bowl, heaving up very little since he hadn’t had dinner. Stíofán moved quickly helping back to bed and taking the bowl out to the yard. He cleaned it out and refilled it with cool water.
Fuck. Not again.
They danced the rest of the night, Tony teaching Steve a basic waltz to add to their repertoire.
Sure enough, there was a slowly growing pile of food on the floor. “Oops.”
At one point, he even agreed to assist with some work in one of the Jeffries tubes when he’d discovered Tony’s plan to ambush him in the commissary. He’d managed to change his shift so that they were on opposite sleep cycles for the next few days, hopefully just long enough for Tony to forget their conversation and become distracted with a new engineering problem. Based on past experience, it should only take between twenty-seven to twenty-nine hours for that to occur, but S’Teve was covering all contingencies.
They were not in love of course, but Tony felt they already had a fondness for one another –far more so than any of the alphas he’d met whom his parents thought would be a good match. It was his ticket away from all of this, and rumour had it that society in the West was less rigid than in the East, something Tony hoped might mean he might be able to forge a path for himself.
He expected to find it hard to fall asleep, given how little of it he’d been doing of late. But when his head hit the pillow, it smelled faintly of Tony - spicy and masculine - and he found himself breathing it in and relaxing into its soft embrace. His eyes fell shut, and he was out before he could think anymore.
They talked for a bit longer, Steve giving him recommendations of local shelters that Tony could take Peter to and the best ways to choose the right dog for them both.
He’d been dwelling on it, turning it over in his head, knowing he wouldn’t be able to drop it until he saw his sweetheart again and made it better.
Pierce was tense beside him, his grip tight at Tony’s collarbone. “He cut the power. We need to--”
She pretended to think. “I guess I can make this work. Bugs or no bugs.”
Tony shook his head. “Not really my thing. But fuses? Gears? That’s where I shine.”
He and Steve turned to see Mr Murphy holding his soiled corset. Figured. “How kind.”
The alpha was silent for a moment, and then his shoulders went back, and his face took on a determined look.
He held Peter close through the shivers, the pup waking up once or twice as they waited for morning.
“Oh really? Just here by your lonesome then?”
Tony managed, resting his face against the wooden wall
Tony was tense in his lap, and Steve was unsure what to do. He didn’t much want to leave Peter either, but they needed real rest.
Steve sighed, his shoulders slumping as he looked at the empty bottle in his hand. “I’m really bad at this, aren’t I? Maybe this is a bad idea.”
“Spear. Wanna see?” She tossed the spear to Carol who caught it, giving it a twirl and extending it with ease.
“You have to know the cops know something’s wrong by now. You’d be better off getting out before they charge in here and arrest you and your flunkies.”
As he swung himself into the saddle he felt the first patter of raindrops against his face. He felt the worry deepen. He’d better make haste.
Steve gestured down the street. “There’s a park just over there. Maybe we could take a walk, finally get to actually talk?”
“I’m hot dada,” Peter mumbled, his voice raspy and sore-sounding, and Tony redraped a freshly cooled cloth on his head. He grabbed a cup of water from the table, helping Peter to take small sips.
“Then spill it over whatever the fuck else is in that lace bra. Just do it!”
Tony rolled his eyes. “Yeah, yeah we’re all terrible. Alright, let’s hear one, come on.”
Tony’s mind flashed back to the night in the saloon. How frantic he’d been to be with Steve, even as he’d been almost too tired to think straight: a driving need, even through his fear.
Good lord. Did this man think he was a - a- well, an “omega of easy virtue”?
Steve’s eyes were wide. “That’s incredible.”
“It’s no problem. Now, I think we can lock up a bit early and go in search of dinner. What do you think?”
“You don’t have to laugh that hard,” he grumbled and Tony flapped a hand.
He turned and saw a woman with striking red hair and a concerned look on her face. “What?”
“Look, look!” Hugh said, and then he turned to Peadar, sucked in a breath and gave a loud, “Arrrrgh!”

“You can-- I’m ready--,” the doe whined, as Stíofán pressed the heel of his hand firmly against the front of the shift. “Yes,
“Get out,” he growled, his voice low and dangerous. “And if you come near him again, I’ll make you a
He pulled Tony tight against his chest, letting himself breathe in the scent of his hair and take in the feeling of having him safe and warm in his arms for a moment, and then he clicked his tongue, urging Nomad on towards home.
Tony spluttered. “Excuse me, young man! I think you know better than to speak about your teacher like that.”
Pierce grabbed Tony’s tie in his hand, dragging him to his feet. Tony really wished he wasn’t wearing the one Steve had given him: Pierce was getting it all wrinkled.
“Why don’t you just paint--”
“There’s no need to be rude.”
“Oh no,” he managed, voice almost a whisper. “Jarvis…”
Sam was right. He and Tony had gotten better over the years at talking about things, the more they got to know each other and fell in love, but there were still times when it was hard to talk about the tough stuff - especially when they didn’t want to hurt the other. And it was becoming clear that this was one of the big things they were going to have to discuss if they wanted to move forward and be happy. Because it was getting harder and harder to see the disappointment on Tony's face when he started getting the pre-heat symptoms that let him know the last attempt was unsuccessful. Steve would do anything in the world to get him to stop making that particular face, the expression cutting into his chest every time he saw it. It was tough having a problem that he knew he couldn't fix just by being stubborn enough.
Tony got Oscar because Steve was a soft touch.
“Ah, I like Daddy’s curls too,” Steve told him, faux-whispering, and he gave Tony a wink.
The man who had hit Tony looked falsely apologetic. “He says they don’t deal with people like us, boss. I thought perhaps you might like to talk to him.”
Stíofán rubbed a palm over the interested area. “Well, that is a shame.” He gave one more stroke to hear Tony’s caught breath and pulled his hand away.
“What?”
She felt the relief settle in her chest and she smiled back. Then she felt J.J’s pinch of her arm and it froze on her face.
When Steve looked up, there was the telltale glint of tears in his eyes. “I am. I’m-- I’m pleased as punch, I really am. If there were ever a sign I’m making the right choice, this little ‘un is it.”
He kept up a steady rhythm, pulling Tony slightly onto knees so he could reach underneath and begin to stroke. The faun writhed beneath him and Stíofán had to start focusing on not making noises himself. He could hear Tony begging for relief and so, he gave a strong twist of his hand. Tony went limp with a long muffled groan.
Tony sat down on the bed, and Steve caught a whiff of his scent, making his heart flutter.
He tried to help Steve up, but when the other man groaned, he shook his head. “Hey Sam? I think Stevie bruised those brass balls of his. I’ll take him home to ice them.”
He took a deep breath and opened the door.
“Oh do they want a spell?”
Tony solves a problem plaguing every omega living with a messy alpha
He turned away and went to the bedroom, where Tony could hear the sounds of a bag being unzipped. Tony wanted to go after him, apologise and stop him, tell him not to go.
“Is it normal? To skip heats?”
He took in the scene quickly. Tony on the floor, Tiberius standing over him looking terrified. His eyes flitted up as Stíofán entered, the blood draining from his face. “I didn’t even touch him, I swear!”
“I said he’d be excited, not that it’s the only reason.”
“S’Teve, come on. I thought we were past this by now. We’re friends, or at least I thought we were.” He reached out to touch his shoulder, and S’Teve felt the flare of emotions coming from him. Worry, frustration, but beneath it, sadness? A tendril of hurt was winding through all of it, and it made S’Teve’s face twitch.
He grunted as he tried to move, the pain shooting up his leg. The clouds rumbled above him and he cursed loudly. And now he was going to get rained on.
“I do,
He turned and caught sight of a fruit stall, where a woman looked shocked and a large man with long blond hair and muscles for days was standing with pumpkin pulp all over his shoes.
“As am I,” Antonius told him. “You think they could send citizens to become whores? My family sold me to the Stables. I understand we are married only in spirit.”
Rhodey’s eyebrows shot up. “Excuse me?”
Tony remembered seeing something under a tarp in the shed. “Like a motorbike?”
The cafe was quiet, the morning rush over and only a few patrons scattered across the tables. So he heard the footsteps as someone approached him and he slowly opened his eyes to see Steve standing in front of him, brandishing a mug of coffee.
Stíofán breathed deep as they came over the rise of the hill, the village down below. It looked just as he’d remembered it, just as lively and welcoming as when he’d waved goodbye that final time.
“Right,” Steve chuckled, looking unsure. His hands clenched on the back of the chair and Tony ached to touch him.
“So be it.
Tony leapt up to escape the hot liquid with a yelp, trying to brush the coffee off his jeans.
Tonight would be different, he swore it.
Tonight was important. They would consummate their marriage and make their bond.
“The Sheriff has humiliated me and made me spend thirty days in one of the most miserable holes I’ve ever seen. I think it's time he and I
“J.J’s over there Azari,” she said, pointing to her brother, nearly shouting to be heard over the greetings.
Bucky grinned in a way that made the hair on the back of Steve’s neck stand up.
He ordered a coffee and took a seat at a table in the corner, leaning back and letting his eyes fall closed.
He intoned in a dramatic voice and the kids’ laughed in delight.
As he hit the city limits, he was grateful to find the town auto repair shop was close to the edge of town. He pushed the bike onto the drive and rolled it through the big open doors.
Rhodey rubbed a hand over his chin. “You know, people would probably pay for that. Plenty of folks have cars that break down, appliances that don’t work like they used to. You could charge for the initial spell and charge for regular strengthening.”
He shook his head, and she pulled him up. “Come on, let’s head back to mine, and I’ll help you make a few to take home. You can call me Natasha by the way.”
There was a wet feeling between his legs. It wasn’t entirely new, but the times it had happened before had been few and far between. And he’d certainly never had it happen while he’d had a strong, strapping alpha between his thighs.
Steve hummed. “And maybe a few rides. Just a couple. Definitely at least the Cyclone: I have a score to settle.”
She looked as though she wanted to argue, and Tony could understand it. There were several folks here far stronger than Tony, and what omega would be able to lift such a heavy burden? He stared her down, trying to will her to understand, and it must’ve worked because she nodded, lip trembling.
She pulled on her new denim jacket over her dress that Pepper had bought her and looked in the mirror.
The old Bucky would’ve died laughing, bent over unable to breathe. But this Bucky, still coming to terms with his time as the Winter Soldier, merely twitched the corner of his mouth. “That’s what I thought you said.”
They chatted for a while, Tony pretending not to notice when Steve occasionally tripped over the odd pop culture reference and finding himself more charmed by the minute. He managed to convince Steve to sketch on a napkin when he admitted he was a bit of an artist and was amazed when he jotted down a rough but beautiful drawing of a landscape, with tall mountains and a sea of trees.
No dramatic crash this time - just Steve calling his name and Tony turning to see him carrying his bag, a work laptop, a coffee, and a large stack of files that were precariously balanced under his chin.
“What, cat got your tongue, Sheriff? I thought you’d be happy.”
Tony snorted as he realised it was a picture of the bartender Carol as some sort of terrifying goddess, gesturing at a crowd of dogs with huge puppy eyes. One dog in particular was a lab with floppy blond hair.
“Now, you want a story or what? Tony likes hearing the one about the time I met Captain America in France, but I got a few up my sleeve.”
Tony nodded eagerly, perhaps he could make up for the awkwardness by spending time together. “It would be nice to see my new home.”
Steve quickly followed, holstering his gun and grabbing his hat. He wondered what was happening. The new shop owner had seemed polite enough when he’d come to town at the start of the month, hardly the type to cause a fuss.
“On Lanova,” he began, unsure if it was the correct course of action. “I heard you speaking to the Chancellor. He implied we were in a romantic relationship. You disagreed.”
Mr Rogers wasn’t interested in him like that. It had become clear to Tony that Mr Rogers’ attention was elsewhere much to his bitter disappointment.
“I’m glad I could be useful.” He reached out and gave Tony’s hand a squeeze. Tony tried to keep the heat from his cheeks. “You’re trying and that’s what matters, don’t be too hard on yourself.”
Pierce’s expression twitched, the anger peeking through. “You seem to think this is a negotiation. It isn’t. I want the weapons I know you have hidden here.” He walked up to stand toe-to-toe with Tony. “And most of all I want the power source. I want the arc reactor.”
He dressed in a fine white top, with a pair of deep red trousers that opened wide at the ankles. He put on his daintier heeled boots, the height making him feel graceful.
After everyone had given him all the advice and their best wishes, they made their way out to the back garden. He didn’t have a broom of his own, too fond of using his own creation when he could get away with it, so his mother had given him one of hers, imbued with all the protection magic she could give it.
“That’s very kind,” Rogers said to her, cheeks tinged pink. “I’m proud of my art, hopefully I’ll have a show of my own someday.”
and he collapsed forward, Antonius huffing beneath his weight as his strength, which had been so prominent since the fight, left him.
“I think I know,” Steve said drily and Tony threw his hands up.
Artist Rogers must’ve caught Jan’s gesture, because he turned to look at them, deep blue eyes wide and curious. Tony wasn’t ashamed to admit he felt a swoop in his belly, the guy was cute.
Steve watched them drive off until they turned the corner down the main street and then he hurried to his horse. He didn’t want to be away from them any longer than he had to.
“Of course my love,” Stíofán said, feeling pleased. He liked that he could make Tony so desperate, so ready to take him however he chose to. It was heady but also humbling that his doe would trust Stíofán to take care of him. He loved it. He pushed in, a slow glide as Tony’s breath escaped in a sigh. They rocked together, in no rush, as the wind howled. Eventually Stíofán’s need grew too much to keep teasing and he shoved in hard making Tony squeak.
“I must return to Tactical. It’s almost beta shift.” S’Teve stood abruptly, grabbing his work PADD.
His son continued playing with his miniature theatre. “Yes, Papa?”
Tony’s eyes went wide. “Either way, what do you-- even if you die, that’s what you did. You moron, is that why you agreed to do the challenge?”
“Put me down you brute!” Tony managed, undermined by the snort he made when Stíofán jostled him.
He just had to get to the doctor.
“Can’t afford it. Besides, not all places will take dogs, you know?”
“That’s not my plant.”
“Uh huh,” Tony sighed again. “I hope you’ve thought about what more kids mean. They can’t all come to the forge, you’d have to watch them.”
Steve tipped his head towards the direction of the bar and Tony bit his lip.
These games had come with a twist, they soon found out. Instead of simply fighting each other, a champion from a different Ludus was here, a large, heavyset man by the name of Ivor. He was big, very big, but Stíofán could already tell he’d be slow. He’d looked over the does, a mean smile on his face, and as the one he already thought of as his flinched, Stíofán realised there was no way he would let Ivor anywhere near him.
The omega blushed, and it delighted Steve that even after years together he could still garner such a reaction with a simple compliment.
Tony fell into bed that night, face buried in the pillow that still smelled faintly of Steve’s heady cologne.
“Not that. That word.”
He kissed a little longer but pulled away when Steve tried to push for more. Steve rolled onto his side, almost pouting, which was flattering. And cute. “Uh, uh, uh, come on, up. I want pancakes.”
“Don’t make a peep now,” Steve said. There was a swish, and Tony tensed. But when the loud crack sounded, he felt no pain. His eyes shot open, and he looked down to see the leather had slapped not his skin, but the pale line of Steve’s forearm.
He panted, the cool air on his body making his fleece ruffle. He rolled to the side, on his back, the doe now lying flat, as his arms gave way, and tried to regain his breath.
“So what’s with you always comparing me to a pig when you’re upset?” Steve asked, and Tony snorted. He felt Steve’s chest shake as he started to laugh too.
“Not sure how you can help us though,” the other man said, raising an eyebrow. “This isn’t really something that can be fixed with potions.”
“Seems to me it most-assuredly does. You release her now. I won’t be so polite if I have to ask again.”
“I knew you’d be good at it,” Stíofán sighed, resting a hand in the thick hair. “Give it a good suck, yeah that’s--oh that’s good,
Steve looked up to seem Tony looking concerned and nodded. “Just not used to hearing that from gals I guess.”
“You went on a trip?”
They rode down the hill, the ride much easier this time, and by the time they were nearly under the airship, looking up, Steve was already excitedly reciting facts. He knew a lot about it, and clearly he did come to see it as often as he said, as some of the crew waved to him as they cycled past.
“There’s still time.”
Steve laid out a colourful blanket, and unpacked the picnic basket while Tony stared out at the sea. Sam had clearly gone all out, and they had no trouble getting through it. For such a small guy, Steve could sure eat a lot.
Stíofán found himself losing focus as Tony detailed how to make armour and swords, and wondered just how much time he’d spent watching the armour maker.
Perhaps, S’Teve thought, he should invest in a hat.
Stíofán held out his arms, taking him from the other buck. “I’ll take him home, let him lie down.” He looked over to Bucky and the other satyrs helping to attach the last of the main frame of the roundhouse. They were getting close to finishing now, just the thatch to be done. Bucky waved him off and Stíofán nodded his thanks.
Peter giggled but then huffed. “It was too hot.”
“Jarvis. He’s my familiar.”
“Uh…”
Tony groaned. Why couldn’t people keep their stupid happiness to themselves?
“Ok.”
He was sick of being on the back foot, realising he was free to do what he wanted now that his secret was out. He reached over, and tugged Tony forward by his shirt. “I’m going to kiss you now.”
“We’ll get another cat.”
“You ready to go?”
Tony breathed in a gulp of beer, nearly choking on it as he spun around to look. “Holy shit.”
“I can’t believe you guys came.”
“I just can’t wait to be up there,” he told Tony, shining with excitement. “Feeling the breeze, and almost feeling weightless, it’s--” he stopped and laughed. “Well, I don’t need to tell you. You know all about it.”
“Where are we?” Tony asked, letting Steve pull him into the warmth of his body.
Using the pan to catch the acid and protect Vision, he poured the acid in thin rivulets over part of the wood, watching with wonder as it seared through the boards, carefully and meticulously removing the parts that held the alpha trapped.
“Yeah!” Sam said, looking pleased as punch over his panic. “We went to get her early. I didn’t realise her first experience was going to be seeing you plummeting out of the sky, but you know what maybe this is for the best. Prepare her early.”
And I will find your mother and she will welcome me with open arms and the kid and I will live in paradise for the rest of our lives and eat only milk and honey, yes.”
“Well I’m glad it didn’t come to that,” Laura told him, looking concerned. “Surely your parents would’ve helped?”
“Don’t you worry,” Barton rumbled. “Lucky here’s a good horse, and his name ain’t for nothing.”
Tony glared at him. “I can do many things, and if you’re doing this, you better get used to being surprised. I have plans.”
The spellwork itself didn’t take much. Most of his time was spent exploring the machine with his magic, finding all the parts he needed to tweak and reinforcing weak spots. The magic flowed from him into the tractor, and soon he could feel it getting stronger, the magic pulsing like a heartbeat. A bit more, just needed to-- there!
“It’s way better for you guys now,” Dad said, opening up a bag and pulling out bedding. “When I went to MIT, the few omegas there were just got assigned to a house. Definite nunnery vibes. It was all 9pm curfew and no alphas allowed above the ground floor. Little did they know, we made our own fun.” He snorted. “We made some of the alpha frats look tame.”
Tony nodded in relief, but couldn’t help feeling a little bold. “Could there be more kissing if we do?”
“Rogers. But just Steve is fine,” the blond adonis said an easy smile on his face. “And that’s Dodger.”
Tony sighed. “Fine, but only if you tell me your name.”
“Stíofán doesn’t need to know. You let me wet my wick behind the kitchen wall and I’ll pay you well.” His voice went low and coaxing. “Everyone knows Stíofán wants to get out, what will you have when he’s gone? Surely earning a few coins on your knees wouldn’t do any harm?”
Tony sighed, realising he’d look ridiculous if he said no now. “Fine.”
He sounded like he did on a mission, and he hated it.
“You will cross the pit, battle some of the best fighters in Rome, and defeat the manticore, claiming a feather from its wing. Begin!”
“Hey, can I get a refill over here?”
Steve put his hands on his hips, blinking up at the hot sun overhead. “Guess I’m walking.”
Tony looked sheepish. “Uhhh I made it automatic? If you address it by name it’ll listen to the order and process it for you.”
Stíofán nodded. “Yes. I know we can’t be married, not by Rome’s law, but I think of us that way. I’d like for us to be like that.” He felt a little embarrassed now. “I know I said some things when we were coupling, but that’s just talk in the moment. I’d like to get to know you too.”
Tony felt the rest of his anger slip away and sighed. “It’s alright. Yes, you should’ve told me you were safe, but you’re right too. Being married is new for both of us, and there are bound to be some bumps in the road. I just didn’t like feeling so helpless.”
Tony couldn’t make sense of what was happening. “I’m sorry, do I know you?”
The crowd was almost silent as they watched it disappear, and Stíofán walked back towards the emperor, feeling the blood dripping down his jaw.
Antonius tried to shake his head, whining, but Stíofán held his head in place. “Let me hear it. Bleat!”
“And what about me?” Tony’s voice came from the doorway, sounding almost angry. “Do I get a thank you for putting you up or are you just going to disappear into that helicopter and I’ll never hear from you again?”
Tony flushed, feeling ridiculous. “I’m so sorry. Honestly, I have no idea what went wrong but I never would’ve thought of making either of you eat it.”
Mr Rogers heaved a big sigh. “Yes of course. It will just be so dull.”
And before they could answer, he turned and walked away, trying to keep his pace natural even though all he wanted was to run away.
“Imperator, I ask for freedom, for me and my doe, and for my
Only a few hours later the Marshall had ridden up, requesting his and Sam’s presence for a posse. Normally he would’ve had time to go home and prepare, but the Marshall had told them they were hot on the fugitives’ trail and needed to leave immediately.
“Sheriff! I know you’re in there! Get out here!”
With one last opponent to go, he used the shield like a ram, battering it against the other satyr’s own. He shoved hard sweeping the other’s hoof with his own, taking off balance and sending him into the dust. Stíofán put his sword point to the other buck’s throat and looked to the Emperor.
Maybe he didn’t have to go.
“I can get him out. I’ve got a plan.”
Tony took a deep breath. No turning back now.
Tony decided enough was enough. He stepped forward and cleared his throat. “Umm, I can help?”
“I know you can. You’re strong, smart, and not once in your life have you ever let anyone tell you you can’t do something.” He chuckled. “Remember when that coach tried to tell you an omega couldn’t play on the soccer team? I don’t think I’ve ever seen a grown alpha cowed by an eleven-year-old. Sam still has the video.” He sat down next to her on the couch and tucked her up against him. “I just know there are some assholes out there. Alphas will undermine you, speak over you, say that being an omega means your work isn’t worth as much as theirs. And I hate to think of you facing them without us to back you up.”
When they sat down to dinner, Tony was still feeling irked.
This time Stíofán went in shield high, getting past the front paws, and under the wings. He raised his shield and brought the sharp edge down on the chain that held it to the ground. It took a good three slices to break the chain, and manticore shrieked with anger whirling around to face him, ready to land a killing strike--
He ignored Steve mouthing the words
“The very same. And you must be the new Mr Rogers. Sam wrote and told me Steve’s catalogue omega had come. I’m glad to find it turns out you’re respectable. It’s just like that alpha to wait till I was out of town to do something so foolhardy.” She smiled. “I only got back this morning, but I was planning to call on you tomorrow to introduce myself. Guess it’s just happening a little sooner.”
He did, but for all he loved to fly it was just a normal part of being a witch. Hearing Steve talk about it with such longing was such a different experience. “If I get my broom finished, maybe I can take you flying.”
Steve looked as if he wanted to say something, but then just settled on a nod.
Tony laughed. “You know, weirdly I feel better? It’s like having my anxiety confirmed and facing it made me feel like maybe I could deal with other things too. And seeing Peter, so ready to charge in, that kid can take down anything. I’m sure it’s the adrenalin hangover talking, but I feel kind of relaxed.”
Because now he had a name, he knew who Tony reminded him of.
And boom! I hope you enjoyed it!!
“Thanks, Coulson,” Steve said, and as he turned it over, Tony realised it was covered in painted circles and -- oh. Oh god.
Hodge pulled himself free, nearly shaking with anger.
The thought of it made Steve’s blood boil. “Of course not.”
“And what’s its name?”
He waved as Steve cycled off and then stepped inside, coming face to face with a grinning Sam.
He frowned, shifting to go back to sleep, but the heat was right against his chest, and he opened his eyes reluctantly.
“But it’s because they’re there, you know they exist.”
Untouched. Stíofán could feel the desire rushing southward. He was hard enough to pound iron. “I like it. That I’ll be the first Buck you’ll ever have.”
“Huh,” Steve said, looking at Tony’s embarrassing craft project “You really liked me then, not just the shield?”
“What else would I be doing?” Steve teased, but then his face fell. “I’m sorry I wasn’t here.”
His eyes burned and he rubbed a hand roughly over his face. He couldn’t cry. He wasn’t going to do that. It wouldn’t help.
Steve sighed into the kiss, and Tony brought a hand up to cradle his jaw, brushing a soft thumb over his cheek. He is pleasantly surprised when he feels one of Steve’s hands against his hip, holding them together as their lips drag pleasingly over each other, lighting a spark between them. Steve in particular seemed to enjoy it, pawing at Tony’s waistcoat, much to Tony’s surprise but immediate delight. His other hand joined it’s partner, holding Steve’s head in place to better ravish him, basking in the soft moans it elicited.  Things were getting rather interesting when Steve twitched, the motion jostling his ankle and he broke away with a whimper.
“Sorry!” Peter said, sounding breathless. “But I had to show Mr Rogers my art!”
“Where’s Pops?” she asked, accepting the plate and grabbing the syrup.
She snorted, nearly choking on a piece of pancake.
“Right.”
Steve walked up quietly, nodding to Dr Banner, who patted Steve’s shoulder on the way out and pulled the door almost all the way closed, leaving them alone.
He’d absolutely lose it.
“Yea-NO! Uh, I mean it’s broken, sorry.” He picked up a jumper and began to tug it on. He heard the sound of Steve rolling onto his back. He struggled to find the head hole, and so it took a moment for him to realise Steve had spoken.
Well, he’d seen weird stuff in the war. This wasn’t much stranger.
Steve laughed. “Wow, that’s a lot of dogs. Which one is your favourite?”
He heard a chuckle, and then there was just sensation. Steve licked and sucked at the skin, dipping in his tongue and making Tony pant. The hands-on his thighs spread him wider and he was exposed, letting Steve get deeper and oh God it was good – it was so good.
“So how’d it happen?” Tony asked, and he didn’t need to clarify for Sam to know what he meant.
He was also... aesthetically pleasing. The tips of S’Teve’s pointed ears increased in temperature when he thought of it, watching Tony strip off his red uniform shirt to allow him to work in some of the tighter spaces of the ship, sweat shimmering on his well-formed muscles. It was a fact, nothing more. Tony had a mostly symmetrical face, with well-maintained facial hair and eyes of a rich brown hue. These traits were often considered attractive in male humans, and S’Teve, as a scholar of Federation species, noticed them in turn.
“We could use my workshop! I have loads of spare parts, a bench for you to work at, and I know someone who can order you anything you need for cheap.”
“And will there be enough room here?”
So that’s what a Cap speech sounded like. Tony felt a little dazed. “You know, you’d make a killing at motivational speaking.”
“Oh Stíofán, oh!” Tony moaned as Stíofán rutted between his furred thighs.
Antonius seemed to fall into the rhythm, dragging and sucking, hot and tight and Stíofán couldn’t do much more than grunt. “Use your hands, come on sweetheart.”
Tony snorted. “I see the wine has made you cocky.” He put a hand behind him and then Stíofán felt pressure on his dick and sighed as he slipped inside.
As if he were being punished for his cynicism, his phone flashed in his hand, and he looked down and sighed. He knew what the instagram notification was going to show before he even opened it.
He just had to be patient.
“It can’t be that hard,” Tony sniffed. “You simply heat the right balance of metals, which you have to be careful with because some take longer to become liquid, you create moulds for the style you want---”
(See the end of the chapter for
As Tony put the mugs in the sink he let himself imagine what it would be like to have Steve there all the time. Someone to help with Peter, keep him safe, long dog walks in the park, cozy nights on the couch together with Tony tinkering and Steve sketching, family breakfasts on Sundays, and a warm body in Tony’s bed and a chest to rest his head on.
“Hi,” Tony said, smiling at him. He was cute, Tony decided, and clearly brave given he was ready to fight those three bullies. “Are you ok?”
“Anthony, wait!” The alpha tried to follow him, but as he started forward, his balance failed him, and he fell sideways with a thump. There were hoots of laughter from inside, and the deputies came out to investigate.
Steve didn’t mind his crazy schedule since he did commissions on the side and sometimes had to take business trips or work late. He liked hanging out in the workshop, which was nice, but Tony also found he tended to leave it more to spend time with Steve.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’m pretty sure we have everything.”
“‘m hungry,” the pup whined. “I miss Oscar.”
“I didn't either, when I was little.”
“I can fix it,” he announced to Mr Barton, who grinned, looking pleased.
It was like he was walking on air all morning and nothing could dampen his mood. Not even when Steve had cycled past, giving him a wave and Tony had dropped the loaf he’d been handing to a customer, his face flushing red.
“What’s this guy’s name?” Steve asked, looking up at Tony.
Tony nodded, not even sure what he was talking about, but if it was as gentle as his previous ministrations, it would be welcome.
“Uh, hi,” Maria stuttered. The girl in front of her had dark hair and dark eyes and a lovely smile. She was beautiful.
He managed to hide his disappointment when all he got was an affectionate brush of lips across his knuckles.
Pops wrapped his arms around dad. “Caltech! That’s amazing. We didn’t know you’d applied there.”
“You had to know I have a crush on you, the rest of the ship does. I have for years. Ever since that mission on Zenra IV, remember?”
about finding you something to keep you occupied.”
“Come on,” Tony said, pushing himself up. “We can go get bagels.”
Instead he waited, and eventually Dr Banner appeared, with a reassuring smile.
“I said I’m fine,” Steve managed, averting his eyes. “If you might leave me for a spell? I’m...hungry. I could use a bite to eat.”
“I should’ve known. Nothing but a mortal injury could keep you down,” he said, sounding amused and Steve huffed.
“Bleat for me,” Stíofán growled. “Come on, bleat. Let everyone hear you, tell them you’re mine. Bleat!”
Steve gestured at him to continue with a nod.
“Steve?”
“If you succeed, I will grant you anything you wish. If you die, may the gods be with you.”
Tony had been frozen, so sure Steve was going to get punched. But something in his expression must’ve rattled the guy because instead of knocking Steve’s lights out, he opened his wallet, threw a handful of notes on the table, and left without another word.
Only to let out a loud squeak as it settled on his entrance. “What- Steve-” He couldn’t manage a coherent thought.
“I liked that,” Tony managed after a little time to recover. “We should do that again.”
Peter lay against the sheets, looking tiny in the big bed, and his cheeks flushed. He had a damp cloth on his head, with a light sheet covering him, even as he trembled beneath it. It was such a stark contrast to his little boy who had been gleefully shovelling down cake at the tea house just a couple of days ago.
“Doesn’t seem like it,” Tony grumbled. He saw Sam and Rhodey exchange looks.
“I thank you for the compliment. And for proving me wrong in my assumption of what would be better for Peter’s education. He is vastly happier by leaps and bounds, and has nothing but praise for his teacher,” Tony said, keeping back the
Of course Mr Rogers would have a beau. He was beautiful, kind and undeniably a wit. Though what this soldier had done to earn his charms Tony couldn’t fathom. He turned on his heel and left, being careful not to be seen. His mood had taken an unpleasant turn.
Huh. That was something Stíofán could work with. “If I do, then I want to negotiate terms.”
Fuck. But he couldn’t.
Steve glanced up at him, then did a double take when Tony stepped closer to sit down at his bedside and grab his hand. Tony could hear Steve swallow as he stared down at where Tony was intertwining their fingers.
Steve snorted, reaching out to take the corset from the omega. “Thank you kindly, Mr Murphy. We’ll dispose of that ourselves.”
He made it around halfway when he heard the clip-clop of hooves behind him. He felt a small spike of fear, but then a familiar horse pulled up in front of him and a familiar alpha slid from the saddle to stand beside him.
They left the arena, ducking into the tunnel as the doors were pulled closed behind them.
“Steve…” Tony managed softly. Because oh god: he’d thought Steve would cheat.
“No can do, Cap. Not today.” Tony patted the baby bjorn. “I have precious cargo. Can’t risk getting caught in the crossfire.”
!’, his eyes flicked over to the doe watching curiously from the side of the arena.
Stíofán was the best fighter there, so it was easy for him to move through the rounds until he and Ivor stood, awaiting the signal to begin.
As he searched, he let his mind wander. He thought back to the ball seven days ago, at Rhodes’ estate. He’d invited Mr Rogers under the guise of watching Peter, but really he’d just wanted to see him enjoy himself, let Tony imagine what Mr Rogers would look like in Tony’s life as more than just a tutor. He had been charming, naturally, winning over all the gentlemen and ladies in attendance.
“We got sent a file. Come on, we’ll show you our little girl-to-be.”
Because that was Maybe-George walking down the street and he had a beautiful woman on his arm.
She could see Pops over his shoulder and when she met his eyes, she mouthed
Tony hurried closer, sticking to the porches of the shops, as the other townsfolk nearby huddled to watch.
“Stíofán!”
Tony nodded. “Yeah I helped him out yesterday and he was a jerk.”
Maria groaned.
“Tony, stop that,” Steve said, sounding scandalised.
Tony sat up, getting to his feet. “Can't say I have. But I’ll tell you what: why don’t you make an appointment with my PA and we’ll do lunch?”
“Oh my god,” Tony said, and Sam nodded, hands coming to rest on the sides of his face.
Tony scowled. “But what does that mean?”
“Thank the gods,” Stíofán breathed, resting his forehead against Peadar’s for a moment. “I thought he was really hurt.”
He rolled over onto his side and closed his eyes, the words from the letter he’d sent running through his head.
“I’m--”
Stíofán knew what was coming, and so reached out pulling Tony close before it happened. He felt Tony go stiff in his arms, his weight completely against him and stroked his hair for a moment before he shook it off, glaring up at Stíofán. “Look what you did.”
It was quick and perfunctory, despite the town clerk spending the first few minutes elbowing the Sheriff in the side in glee, and the local preacher being called in to conduct the ceremony.
He’d have to remember to pick some wildflowers on his way home.
He walked, his hand trailing over garden walls, and breathing the salty air as he got ever closer to the coast. He counted down the numbers on the mail boxes, arriving at the address on the envelope he held as the street opened up to a wide view of the sea.
“Great! I’ll come pick you up at 7!” He put Jarvis down gently on the ground, and headed for the door. “See you tonight!”
“For dinner??” Peter’s little jaw dropped, making Steve laugh.
Steve kissed him hungrily, and Tony grasped desperately at his shoulders, hanging on for the ride. He felt hands slip under his thighs and suddenly he was airborne, held tight against Steve’s chest. There was that super strength in action.
“Gods gladiators are horny,” Tony complained, catching Stíofán’s appreciation. He clapped his hands. “You said we shouldn’t waste time.”
“I don’t know!” Rhodey yelled, looking freaked. “Why would they give him the same name? They could name a clone anything they want!”
“We have training most of the day, then time spent with the doctor to check our health, then the evening meal. Then those of us who have been here a year or more are allowed to spend some time in the meal room before bed.” He rubbed his hand gently over Tony's lower back. “Not every
He looked up to see Steve smiling at him. “Yes, I think that’s quite enough excitement for one day.”
Steve grabbed a novel from the side table. “
He reached down to pick up the jack, and Steve stepped forward to take it from him.
She walked over to the window, watching as they came out the front door, walked out across the parking lot towards the rental car.
He stopped to tap in a clean-up request into the intranet on his phone and then tucked it into his pocket to head into the meeting.
Although things had improved at home, it wasn’t until a trip to the General Store that Tony realised perhaps their initial difficulties had been far too obvious about town.
attracted to him.
For a minute he wondered if he should ask Steve out, maybe try for something more than just Dog Park Buddy. But being friendly with them wasn’t the same as being into Tony. Steve himself said he worked for a charity, he might be just one of those people that likes to be nice.
Tony grinned. “I’d like that. I think we’ve waited long enough, don’t you?”
So he said nothing. He took the basket with his thanks and rode home on Ana, meeting Deputy Barnes at the house when he arrived.
When Dad released them, Pops came over and took his place. “How’d we get so lucky, huh?” He pressed a kiss to each of their heads. “You two are just the most incredible kids.”
“Mr Rogers, what a delight to see you again. Perhaps you might fetch your husband. I’d like to speak to him.” The man dismounted, his hands clear of his gun, but Tony didn’t dare lower his own.
” Stíofán pushed on, needing to hear it.
, S’Teve thought. He had taken part or not taken part as needed in many rituals of first contact. This was no different.
The sheriff, having run out of things to do with his hands, cleared his throat awkwardly. “I suppose I ought…”
“Just one. But he makes me happier everyday, so I guess I’ll keep him around.”
He wondered if maybe one day the Sheriff might permit a visit. He’d been open to most things so far, but then maybe accepting your omega’s family (or close enough) to visit for a few weeks might be too much.
Steve blanched, remembering the last time he’d asked her for help on a photoshoot and ended up getting a treatment that might as well have been torture for how much his skin had ached afterwards. “Oh no.”
A recipe from his mother-in-law was a fine first step. “That would be lovely.” Wait, had the Sheriff said ‘write her for it’? “She doesn’t live here?”
“That there.”
How had some simple sweeping and mattress dusting taken that long?
“Your concern is unnecessary.” This was foolish, he didn't need to explore this further.
“Peter, you--”
Stíofán felt like he was being very slow, though it was hard to think with the panic still subsiding. “I don’t--”
His heat was late.
had delivered them the news earlier in the week, to give them a reason to train harder. He also had a suspicion that there was the hope of offspring that could be trained for the
Stíofán made his way to the grounds feeling less enthusiastic than usual. He wanted to stay. Make Tony laugh some more. Or spend the day working together. As it often did, the image of his home filled his mind. The woodsmoke on the air, the soothing bustle of the village that was so unlike the frantic noise of Rome, the green of the pastures and the safety of the village walls. His mother outside the house, Bucky waving as he walked by. Perhaps he’d be married by now, living in his own stone house. For a moment, his mind placed Tony there. Tony helping his ma with the garden, or cooking over the fire as Stíofán came in from tending to the crops. He felt suddenly so homesick it was almost a physical pain. He blinked quickly to keep the tears back and stepped into lines with the others.
“Ow!”
Half of this job was popularity and as much as he hated it, he knew he couldn’t afford to shun it. He gave a few poses for laughs and appreciative stares, but as he courted the cheers of ‘
“That’s it,” Steve said looking up at him. “If it feels good I want to hear you. Don’t hold back.”
Steve looked at him, chin high in the air, brave even in the face of potential humiliation. “I am.”
Tony breathed a sigh of relief, carrying his items to the counter and trying to control the red in his cheeks. No way the shop owner didn’t hear them carrying on.
Tony snapped his fingers. “Yes, I remember. I totally remembered the whole time.”
“Pleasure to meet you,” Tony replied in turn. “And I’m happy to be here. Everyone in this town seems so nice.”
“Thanks for dinner,” Steve told him as he straddled the bike. “It was delicious.”
Steve waved the note. “Says here, ‘Please enjoy this picnic, free of charge, provided you enjoy it outside and take our delivery man with you for a whole afternoon. Signed,The Baking Boys.’”
Tony snorted, an assortment of feelings bubbling up. “I suppose we’d better.”
Tony huffed. “Maybe. I’d rather be at home tweaking the new line.”
Tony snorted, even as he felt his cheeks heat. Hot engineer guy huh? Guess he hadn’t been the only one looking.
Tony groaned as he walked around the small crowd that was forming and clapping for the couple.
Hodge scowled. “I will have my pound of flesh. In fact, you know what? I’ve changed my mind. If your husband won’t speak to me, then I guess we’ll have to take you with us. Give him a reason to come find me.”
“Who is that man? Is he your security?” He gave Tony a shake. “Answer me!”
“Hey I’m just making sure. Living away from home the first time is tough.”
He started forward at a quick pace, and Tony followed as if in a dream. It was as though his soul was outside his body, watching himself stumble after the deputy, his baby in the alpha’s hold, quiet and face flushed, lacking his usual pep and bright-eyed curiosity.
“Amazing,” Wilson wheezed, before clearing his throat. “Delicious.”
There was a pause. And then there was a peal of laughter.
Tony clenched his teeth angrily. He was stuck. He couldn’t risk everyone here, but there was no way he could give weapons to what was clearly some sort of terrorist group. Who knew how many people he’d hurt?
They were so close to launching Stark Pet Products he could almost taste it.
The cart groaned. “3, 2, 1 - Now!”
“Take my hand,” he said, reaching out, and he could see Steve was reluctant to relax any of his grip. “I’ll save you, I promise.”
“Me too,” Ana said with a smile. “I have had a good, long life here with my Edwin. I am very lucky.”
Tony blinked and then laughed, the sound building deep in his chest and forcing its way out in this wave of relief and surprise. There were tears in his eyes as he laughed, and Steve’s face blurred, even as his horror turned into a scowl.
Behind there was a click like the sound of a lock, and a squeak and then a gasp. Tony’s eyes snapped open and he turned around, coming face to face with a very surprised Steve Rogers.
But that future was gone now. Peggy had lived her whole life without him, and he had to learn to move on.
The man chuckled. “He’s fine. My team will get him. Just thought maybe he deserved to piss himself a bit first.”
“Who else could I ask? You’ve seen me as skinny Steve Rogers who couldn’t get a date to save his life, you saw me when I ate those bad rations in those woods in France and didn’t realise the way the serum protects me is by
. “I’m sorry, I thought…” He trailed off, unable to say it.
He figured he’d have to throw the match to get Steve in his bed, but instead, Steve made every shot with frightening accuracy.
“It’s not bouncy. Daddy’s is bouncy.”
“Let’s see what’s ailing this old girl, hmm?”
Tony put his pie on the table, making sure to lay it out nicely and precut a few slices, while Steve spoke to a couple and congratulated them on their nuptials.
“That would be— wow, I guess I hadn’t really thought about how I would use my specialty, just that I wanted to. But I could make a business out of it?”
“Call him that again,” Stíofán said, not looking away from Tony. “And I’ll shove that bowl up your ass.”
Tony covered his face with his hands for a moment, weighing the potential humiliation, but then walked over to his closet and opened it. The door swung open to show the mini-collage of photos of Steve before the serum from Camp Lehigh, his military records, and rebirth taped to the inside. He looked up at the ceiling feeling the heat crawling into his cheeks.
He was really beginning to regret that decision.
The ease with which he lived his life just looked so...freeing.
Tony handed the money over, and the man frowned. “Is this it?”
“Bucky! Language!”
extend to pool. He missed easy shots, and for the first two games knocked the eight ball into the pocket early with a curse.
That was something at least.
“Hush!” Tony said, giving him a shove. “You didn’t have to do that.”
They started meeting Steve at the park regularly.
“Oh of course. I meant no offence. I mean, everyone’s noticed the sheriff’s lack of...
“Ok, that’s the second time you’ve done that. What’s going on?”
He didn’t have to turn to see Steve’s spectacular eye-roll. “She didn’t say that.”
This had to be some kind of sign that Tony was meant to climb this man like a tree. He looked even better in the tight t-shirt and dark jeans he wore under the apron, and Tony unconsciously ran his tongue over his bottom lip.
“Well, it’s just,” Tony ran a hand through his hair. “Bruce said that the reason your heat came on so fast was because you were near a compatible alpha. You know, me. I'm the compatible alpha.”
“You come first,” Steve told him. “You and Peter. I may have to be the peacekeeper but that doesn’t mean I won’t do anything to keep you two safe.”
Oh, God.
Steve raised an eyebrow. “Well, you may want to learn to get faster out here. Cold stew isn’t nearly as pleasant, and we’ll be eating a lot of it.”
Bucky bit back a snort, hurrying into the elevator before he could get an earful of his best friend getting it on. Maybe Sam would be up for a beer or something. He only turned back for a two-fingered salute, already planning to get a high five at breakfast tomorrow.
That underhanded, conniving baker! Tony shoved the basket at Steve along with the note. “Guess this is for you.”
Tiberius opened his mouth to respond but snapped it shut when a bowl of mush was placed in front of him.
“A new broom,” Steve repeated, accidentally smudging icing on his face in his enthusiasm. “You said you’d made one that works better than plain old wood, why not make one again?”
“No, I-- sexy?”
Tony scowled. “No, really I can. I’m a witch.”
“What do you make?”
“You are a good father,” Mr Rogers said firmly. “I have worked with families where the fathers barely took an interest in their children, but you dote on him, listen to him, and make sure he knows he’s loved. It’s very admirable.”
Vision suddenly popped free of the cart with a whoosh, and Tony only had a moment to feel a rush of triumph before he felt two strong hands on his calves, and he was yanked out from under the cart with a squawk.
“Really, I can walk.”
The diner had been grateful and their waitress, Angie, always had a treat for them whenever they went back.
“Well she seems like a smart gal,” Tony grinned, enjoying the praise. “We?”
Steve perked up. “I do, I had it back in London during the- uh during a vacation there.” He remembered eating the dessert with custard in a BnB he and the Howlies had stayed at during a 48-hour leave. It had been strange at first, but it had grown on him, and he’d had it a few times during his time in England.
“Hey,” a familiar voice behind her said, and she looked over her shoulder to see J.J with Azari on his back. “One of those for me?”
“Good luck Captain,” Director Fury said from behind him.
“Wait, hold on.” Tony felt his heart suddenly pounding as he parsed through Steve’s words. “You did that for me?”
When they were gone, Steve put his hands on his hips. “You know I had respect in this town before you came along.”
As she stepped out he moved past her with his towel.
A hand shot out to grab his, curling around his wrist, and tugged him forward. Tony went with it, looking up to see Steve looking worried. Steve pulled him against his chest, letting him lean against his uninjured side. “We’re ok. Don’t be upset now.”
The man’s face lit up. “Oh that’s a classic. My dad had one he fixed up, I used to love it.”
“Tell you what,” Tony offered, leaning next to him on the table. “I win the next one, and I get a kiss.”
is under
Steve tore through the tents, slamming into one of the alphas who tried to run. He was edging towards feral. He could feel it: something that alpha’s rarely experienced outside life or death situations. He should try and draw it back, but he felt himself leaning into it. That rage would get him to Tony faster.
“So did I. But I miss the tiny hooves, waiting for their first horns to come in. The kids are old enough now that they don’t need as much watching and if you’re carrying soon, they’ll be just in time for next spring.”
“Fine.”
Tony reached over and plucked a plain brown paper packet from the basket. “I wouldn’t say that.”
by a wide margin.
For a moment Stíofán thought he’d made a mistake, that Tony would tell him they were convenient but nothing more. But instead, the doe nodded, head bobbing frantically. “Me too. I love you too.”
You didn’t get a second chance at a first impression after all.
Stíofán huffed a laugh and placed a last apologetic kiss to his cheek before he started working Tony with his hand again.
“I’m sorry about the mess. I’ll get up and clean it shortly.”
This was going to be a long day.
He helped Tony roundup some of the cafe cats into carriers, and took a few cakes from Rhodey who sent them off with a wave.
“Alright. If you’re good, I’ll ask Ma if you can have some honey with your bread, how does that sound? Good?”
Steve didn’t hesitate as much this time. His thrusts were long, deep, and even soon enough, and Tony was moaning with it, limbs curling around his alpha, the pleasure building up in him again.
“Your reaction suggested you thought it impossible.”
Stíofán leaned down to blow gently on his neck, feeling Antonius shiver. His own interest was becoming plain, his cock pressing against the front of the knotted fabric he wore, straining between his furred legs. He tried not to groan at the feel of it pressing against the doe’s thigh. “Mhmmm. I smelt your sweet scent and all I could think about was getting you here, mounting you until you bleat loud enough for everyone to hear.”
He felt the protective instinct rush up, and he stepped inside, his tone no nonsense. “What’s going on here?”
Steve stared at him. “Tony. The
“If you don’t mind me saying,” Steve started and he looked a little awkward. “You seem to be a little anxious about him. Is it-- Is it just you and him?”
“I sell books! What were you expecting?”
“If I
“But yours is right there. Mine’s all the way back at home.”
“I was thinking, maybe you could come to the fundraiser with me?”
“But we have to show you something!” Hugh cried, bouncing around him in a circle. “Now, now, now!”
“Yeah I hear you,“ Sam agreed. “I'm sure Natasha's raging just as much as Tony that I took off without a word. You know how much she hates that.”
“No,” Steve’s voice was soft, and there was a tinge of hope in it now. “No, I didn't ask because I had this wonderful, beautiful omega who let me feel the most pleasure I’d ever felt, only for me to realise I had made him cry. And I wasn’t going to do that again. I was a lucky enough fellah that he’d married me. Better to have you to love and care for than not at all.”
Tony grinned. “You bet.”
At lunchtime, Tony put up the closed sign, and at Steve’s questioning look, Tony grinned.
The clouds rumbled overhead as he straddled the broom and Tony winced. Was his entire witches journey to be plagued by rain whenever he flew?
“Yes sir,” Steve agreed, wanting to fight but knowing it was useless. He had to go, and no amount of wishful thinking would change that. He had a job to do. “Nicest place I’ve been.”
Tony’s eyes were wide. “Pinch me. This can’t be real.”
The Sheriff began to move, and Tony gasped at the feeling. In and out, long, slow thrusts that made a pressure build low in his belly. He could feel a moan trying to escape, but he bit it back, remembering one of the books he’d once read from his father’s library.
Steve had always known he liked men the same as he’d liked the ladies. Ever since he was that little guy in Brooklyn. He’d accepted it pretty early on. It was illegal, so he wouldn’t act on it, and luckily he liked gals too so no problem. Then, of course, it had turned out to be a moot point since no one, of either sex, was lining up to dance with him. And although Father O’Malley had been sure to point out that being that way was a sin, he also said that people should be happy with the way God made them. So Steve had decided to just not worry about it.
“No sir,” Jarvis replied from the bed, stretching his back in a long arch, his claws digging into the duvet to hold him in place. “You’ve been packed for a month. I hardly think anything would’ve moved.”
“Hey, hey, ” Steve protested, as he pulled away. “Steady now.” He held Tony’s hips tight as the omega tried to shift in his lap. “You’re tired, and you’re worked up. Let’s just get some shuteye.”
As they pulled away she caught a glimpse of her dad burying his face in Pop’s shoulder and Pops winding his arms around him.
Before he got too far down the hall, his enhanced hearing caught the rustle of pages and a thoughtful hum.
Those bastards. He couldn’t believe they’d gone as far as to kidnap his omega over a few barfights. Some alphas could be petty over the most minor of slights, but he’d never expected this.
He didn’t realise there were tears running down his cheeks until Tony reached up to wipe them away.
He took over, undressing them both with nimble fingers, Tony groaning as the cool air hit bare skin. Steve hoped it was just the stress. He wasn’t sure he could handle it if Tony fell ill too.
Tony watched in horror as the dish slipped from his hands and smashed on the floor in an explosion of china, soup and vegetables all across his nicely swept floor.
“Well no but--”
A hand came down to brush over his cock, and Tony came with a shout, just as the knot pushed inside him and swelled, tipping him over the edge again, a cascade of pleasure, and he collapsed forward on the bed, unable to hold himself up, covered by a warm, sweaty alpha who was giving him grateful kisses on his shoulders. “Thank you. Tony. I love you. You’re so good.”
“Story!”
“I didn’t--” She fixed him with a glare. “Yeah, I might’ve.”
“Experiments?”
“It looks great, how’s it handle?”
Peadar reached his arms up to loop around Stíofán’s neck, rubbing his horns against Stíofán’s. “Sorry Da.”
“What?”
The omega looked like he’d swallowed a lemon but nodded and walked off to join his friends who looked equally unimpressed.
He came in to land in a field next to an old wooden farmhouse, feeling the familiarity of the country wrapping around him. He’d forgotten how quiet home was compared to the bustling city, and the sudden silence felt like a breath of fresh air. Actually, so did the literal breath he took: no smog from cars or stagnant water from the sewers, just grass and the faint smell of rain. He looked where there were dark clouds gathering in the distance. Hopefully he’d be fast enough to miss those on the way home.
He couldn’t wait any longer. He shoved in, sheathing himself in one push, making the doe gasp. He ran a hand over Antonius’ back to calm him, giving him a moment to adjust as he savoured the feeling around his dick. It was the closest thing to heaven Stíofán had ever experienced.
“It’s great,” Tony told him honestly. “I really appreciate you guys helping me out.”
“Sheriff, Sheriff!” The door to the office banged open.
Steve hissed a little, and at first Tony thought it was pain, but then out of the corner of his eye he noticed a slight rise in the covers.
Steve felt his neck prickle with heat. Oh, this was not a conversation he wanted to have.
Now Mr Rogers looks more confused. “I am sorry. I don’t know what you are talking about. Bucky and I are friends.”
“Meep moop, I am a human child. I will live with my overprotective parents forever and never leave them Beep beep,” Sam mimed, doing robot actions. Carol burst into laughter behind him.
“Well I’d say he did, wouldn’t you?”
He paid, then gathered up his shopping in his basket and stepped outside. Once out the door, he quickly ducked into the alley between the general store and the tailor’s and tried not to cry.
“And how do you know what his fleece felt like?”
“Thanks for the tip though,” the man said before shoving him backwards. “Sit down.”
The one Hodge had grabbed nodded, rubbing at her arm. “I’m fine, thank you.” She looked up and her eyes widened in surprise. “Oh! Your Mr Rogers aren’t you? The Sheriff’s omega?”
He felt Tony relax against him, his breath evening out, before he realised the omega had fallen asleep on him. He smiled a little, glad he could be of some help.
“Yeah, Sam said. It’s ok.”
The moment of distraction was just enough for Tony to miss the gust of wind, only realising after it hit, spinning them off course.
“Thank you,” he murmured, and he felt Tony nod, a rather sobbish sounding noise coming from his collarbone.
Tony shrugged. “I have a mechanical broom at home. Flies like a dream. My parents didn’t trust it though. They think it’s too ‘modern’. So I had to use mom’s one instead.”
“I see. Well, in that case, I guess I should uphold my end of the deal.” Tony downed the remainder of his drink in one swallow and gave Rhodey a wave as he pointed to the door. Rhodey gave him a wink and a thumbs-up before turning back to watch the game that was playing on the big screen. Tony gave Steve a heated glance holding out his hand. “Shall we?”
Now was the time. He could do it.
He was so relaxed in fact, that he didn’t even see the danger that was lurking at the end of the path as it opened out onto the wide green space.
The beast swiped again, this time a claw caught the side of Stíofán’s face, tearing a burning line down his cheek. Stíofán growled, slapping it away with the shield.
“Ugh, don’t you just hate that?” Rich guy said, as there was a loud gasp. Tony looked in the direction of his scowl. It looked like two patrons had bumped into each other, and yup, there it was, the glow of a new bond. Christ.
So, it came as a shock when that bubble was burst.
He should stop. It was only polite. But he found himself drifting lower, around Steve’s belly, near the top of his hip bones. He could feel the heat starting in his cheeks, but he didn’t relent.
Tony looked through the basket of shopping as he waited. He was glad they hadn’t bought anything too affected by the heat, otherwise it would all be spoiled.
The Sheriff, it turned out, was a prattler. He was pointing out things to Tony as they went, talking to the horse that Tony learned was called Daisy, and shifting around as he guided them to Tony’s new home.
“And the words on your arm mean you know yours exists too,” Rhodey emptied his glass. “Now go buy another round. If I have to listen to you whine then you’re picking up the tab.”
“I don’t run into gunfire.”
“Yeah we are buddy, let’s try and use our inside voices until then huh?” He picked him up to put him on the stair and shove the sneakers on his feet. “Now, let’s go over the rules again. What do we do when we get to the dog park?”
, you hated that I was in the army, why would you go out with another soldier?”
“Your Cap boots have lifts! It’s basically the same thing, stop whining.” Bucky adjusted the lens. “Now lean up against the wall since you’ve got the balance of a baby deer, and try to flirt with the camera.”
She stepped into the room feeling a swoop of excitement in her stomach. She was here!
Rhodey asked Friday politely to open the drawer, and the till did so, dinging happily. Steve’s eyes widened.
pic by any standards.
Well. Wouldn’t do to be seen ogling tower visitors. But maybe he could ask around later: see if anyone knew of a sexy blond who had signed into the building. Maybe. Tony took a sip of his coffee as his phone beeped, letting him know Pepper had noticed his absence. Back to the grind.
He let Tony work, keeping his hands to himself for as long as he could, but eventually the desire to touch was too strong, and he wrapped his arm around Tony’s waist, drawing him close. Tony stumbled into him and leaned against him with a sigh. Steve kissed his jaw, frowning when he felt an unexpected warmth. “You’re hot.”
“You got it. Oh here, let me tidy up the bed.” And before Tony could stop him, he picked up the duvet, shaking it out and letting it fall onto the mattress.
“That sounds nice.”
“And well, she kept hanging around the bookshop and people kept asking if she was up for adoption and I thought, if people want to adopt her just from hanging out in the bookshop, maybe they’d consider adopting others. So I started fostering a few who were taking a while to get adopted, and then Rhodey had the bright idea that Cat Cafes were getting popular so we expanded. The shelter keeps us supplied with furbabies for adoption, and we help keep them from getting overrun. Plus we help socialise them and give people a chance to get to play with the cats they want to adopt. It works well.” He grinned. “Didn’t hurt business either - turns out book people are often cat people and when you offer them both, it’s hard to keep them away.”
He walked back until he reached the cordon, checking the medical tent that had been set up to check over injuries. No sign of Steve. A tendril of panic started creeping up his spine as he considered the aftermath of the battle. What if Steve was in amongst that mess, yet to be discovered?
Tony let out a sob that surprised even him, and in an instant he was surrounded by alpha. He clung to Steve, all the stress and worry seeping away, until all that was left was a resounding relief he felt all the way to his bones.
Oh, he - he didn’t want - oh.
He turned on his heel and took off at pace.
“If you don’t, you’re going to be hit by a car or something because you’re too tired to look both ways. You need a break.”
Though the town clerk would no doubt be down at the saloon telling everyone as soon as the ink was dry. Everyone would want to hear that the Sheriff had gotten himself hitched to an omega.
“Glad you listened to me about something.”
He waited impatiently for the guard at the platform to open the door and accepted the alpha’s hand down so he didn’t slip on the stairs.
There was a ping on his phone and he looked at the notification.
Doc Bruce shook his head sternly. “No, of course not. Peter’s a healthy pup. He just caught an illness like anyone else.” He gave Steve a pointed look. “It’s no one’s fault, Steve.”
As they drove away, Tony saw the Falcon make kissy faces at Steve, who gave him a punch in the arm and snorted.
“So that’s it?”
S’Teve took to watching the Chief Engineer closely.
“Rogers! If you break one more thing in my bar I’ll--”
To say the journey was stressful would be an understatement.
He was ambling back when he heard the telltale sound of a gunshot. That alone was not necessarily a cause for concern, but when he heard more and realised where they were coming from, he started to run.
He looked up, and his breath caught as he looked into a familiar pair of blue eyes.
“You clean up well,” Tony said, looking him over. “More civilised.”
Tony let the smile spread over his face as he reached out to take Steve’s hand in his. “Well that is very fortunate. I have been burning with jealousy over a soldier for the past few months when I could have simply said something and put my suffering to rest. If only I had but an ounce of your bravery Mr Rogers.” He lifted Steve’s hand to his mouth, placing a kiss to the knuckles and enjoying the red flush that spread across those gorgeous cheekbones. “I love you. A great deal in fact, and when you are recovered, I would very much like to make you an offer of marriage.”
He was someone’s. Someone’s omega, and this was his home now. It was...a heady feeling, after spending so much time like a tenant in his parents’ home, something they could use to build their own power and reputation.
Dad snorted. “Ah, my terrifying offspring.” He pressed a kiss to her hair. “You can have anything you want.”
Stíofán took the reins, pulling the donkey forward until Tony had a clear view of the little fortress below.
This was bad. Or it could be fine. People got fevers, children especially. So it might be nothing. Or it might be very bad and Peter was very sick.
He slipped under the covers, stretching out and getting comfortable. It wasn’t long before the curtain was tugged back and a faun shoved his way into his arms.
“But I mean, if you’d met that little guy back then I don’t think we would’ve--” he gestured to between them. “I wasn’t much to look at.”
“Hi!” There was an omega girl standing there holding a container in her hands.
“Deal.” Rhodey stuck a fry in his mouth with a smirk. “Good luck Romeo.”
Steve took the basket and offered Tony his elbow. “Feels like there’s a critter clawing at my belly I’m so hungry.”
Suddenly Stíofán wanted the interlopers gone. Seeing him stake a claim was one thing, but seeing Tony fall apart was just for him.
Tony rolled his eyes. “Alright that’s it, out. We’re busy trying to spread the joy of reading. Move your ass out of here.” He shooed her, Darcy laughing when she dodged his playful swatting. It was clear they cared about each other, just having fun at work like it was any other day.
“Perhaps that ought to wait until you’re a little better.” He grinned at the distinct pout of Steve’s lip. “Now, since you are bedridden, how about I fetch a book to--” that’s as far as he got before there was a thunder of footsteps in the hall, and Tony had but a moment to catch Peter before he flung himself on Steve’s injured ankle. “Peter! Be careful!”
“I’m proud of you. You took care of our pup. You carried him to town when he needed help, and now the doc’s taking care of him. I’m sorry I wasn’t here.”
“Bye Steve, we’ll see you next time.”
Steve took a deep breath and let it out. “You’re right, I’m sorry.” He got to his feet. “I’m going to beat Hodge to a pulp.” And then he threw himself down the steep canyon wall, sliding to the bottom.
He slipped under the quilt, and Tony could feel the heat coming off him almost at once. They sat in silence for a moment, and Tony tried not to stare at the smooth chest beside him.
Hodge laughed. “All in good time. Now let’s head back to camp. The sheriff will come to us soon enough.”
“Wha?” A tired voice answered on the other end.
Warning notes: Bad guys try to make Steve physically discipline Tony, Steve instead harms himself to fool them and protect Tony
The Sheriff growled. “You touch him, I’ll rip that hand off.”
But the other part, the pushier part that was keeping his stomach in a constant tangle, was that he and Tony hadn’t made up after their recent dispute.
When the other items arrived, Tony took them with thanks. He was well aware of the dozens of pairs of eyes on his back as he poured the acid and water into the jar. It puffed puff with white smoke, making the crowd gasp and step back. Then he took the enamel tray and shimmied under the cart. It was creaking dangerously, and Tony knew he had to be quick if he didn’t want the whole thing to collapse on them both.
Oh good god. He clearly wasn’t in jail anymore.
Steve could feel the heat in his cheeks now, his permission apparently not needed, as he stared at the doorway Tony had disappeared through.
He punctuated the command with a particularly hard thrust.
“I’m sorry, I’m just having a little trouble making sense.”
“Good.”
A wave of acknowledgment, and Steve led Tony to the horse, helping him up before climbing on behind him.
“You little bastard!” The other buck roared in outrage, trying to get himself upright.
“Yeah me too,” Stíofán said, and they both chuckled, both seemingly taken by the absurdity of it.
His distraction made his focus slip, and the tool went astray, making him knock over his now-cold coffee onto Steve’s shirt.
The doe whined at that, though Stíofán couldn’t tell if the thought was pleasing or shocking. “I can’t wait to have you suck me, those pretty lips brushing over my dick, it’ll be incredible.”
Stíofán stroked faster and licked deeper, until the doe spilled onto the wall, panting and gasping as his knees gave way. Stíofán caught him, tugging him down in his arms and holding him as he shivered.
“Yeah I mean if you guys have the tools..”
He shouldn’t ask, asking was a bad idea, but he couldn’t help himself. “Is it just you and Dodger?”
Barnes darted out of Steve’s reach with a laugh. “Chill Stevie. You put a ring on his finger, I don’t think he’ll be put off by finding out his alpha has all the class of donkey.”
Plus, it was hard to be mad when he could see the love and pride in Steve’s eyes from beneath the dark blue mask.
“Must be tough. Is that why you’re on the road?”
He watched Steve carefully, feeling a little guilt at the flinch he gave. “Tony.”
He dressed in his plainest things, pulling on his heeled boots and using a rag to hold his curls from his face as he’d seen in a magazine advertisement once.
Peter gasped, spoon hanging from his mouth. “She cut her hair?”
“What?”
Tony and Sam winced and Bucky howled with laughter.
“Of course. I’m sure he’ll enjoy that immensely.”
“You--”
“I’d rather not. I just, I’m sorry it wasn’t what you were expecting.”
“That’s a--oh fuck!” Tony staggered back, grabbing Peter and pulling him back. Because there on the ground was a long, coiled snake. It gave a warning rattle, it’s dark eyes fixed on them.
“Sure I do. You’re my best friend and a great guy. And somewhere the perfect person is just waiting for you to say the words they’ve been waiting their whole life to hear.”
“Yeah Steve’s pretty great. He’s uh, going to help me with my broom.”
There was a steady pulse beneath his fingers and Stíofán breathed a sigh of relief. This close he could see the doe’s dark eyelashes, smell his warm spicy scent. And the way he’d fallen, the soft fabric covering him up had slipped, giving Stíofán a clear view of sharp collarbones and the long line of his neck. Stíofán licked his lips, mouth suddenly dry. He moved to his storage chest, pulling out a rag and dipped in his water bucket. He knelt back down, and wiped it over the doe’s face, letting the cool water splash gently down his cheeks.
And they were both wearing bonded rings.
Tony crooked his finger, and Steve obediently leaned up for a kiss. “See you at home.”
He felt a hot flush of shame. That wasn’t supposed to be possible. Alphas wanted it all the time: everyone knew that. They’d try anything to get it. And most of his friends who had married had been with child within the first few months of their marriage. But somehow, he’d failed.
He let his eyes fall shut.
Eventually, Tony pulled away for air, letting his fingers brush over S’Teve’s ears, making him shiver.
“It’ll keep you safe,” Tony had told him as they stood at the entrance to the arena. He slipped the handles over Stíofán’s arm, over the greaves he'd made him and the thin breastplate. It was all so light and thin, he hadn’t been sure of it. But Tony had poked him in the chest and told him it would work, and so he had no choice but to believe.
“Even better,” he grinned. “This might be my first almost proposal, but I understand they often come with a show of one’s affection,” his expression turning sly.
“That’s so cool,” Steve breathed, sounding awed. “I’ve seen you fly, it must be so great being able to do that without a machine.”
He was still asleep, whatever the doctor gave him was still holding strong, and so Tony made sure to keep him warm and check for fever regularly before he went to the main room to curl up on the armchair to rest. He didn’t want to risk hurting Steve if he moved during the night.
“I get it Dad. I’ll be careful.”
Steve looked at him in alarm. “What?”
“I’m sure we can do something. Which leg is it?”
“I see you didn’t get the memo,” he called, getting both men’s attention. “SI hasn’t made weapons since my father was in charge, and there’s no way in hell I'm helping you.”
Stíofán felt as though his heart might explode and he clutched Tony to him, pressing kisses along his hair and pointed ears.
When the Sheriff looked at her, her face smoothed out, and she was all politeness and smiles, taking their order and buttering the alpha up. Seemed society here wasn’t as different to back East as they liked to believe.
“Sorry, I didn’t see you there,” he said, trying to regain his composure and feeling a little embarrassed.
“Baaaaaaaaa!” Tony cried, loud and desperate and Stíofán fucked him harder wanting that sweet bleat again.
Tony bumped his head against Steve’s. “Want to see how fast it can go?”
He looked back at the gateway where he knew Tony would be, even as the bright light kept him hidden in shadow and sent a wink his way and a smile.
The only response he got was a raised middle finger as Steve rifled through the bags.
He was still mulling it over as he got close the entranceway before he became aware of voices.
“Huh? Oh.” His hand came up to brush gingerly against the bruise. “Yeah don’t worry. I’ve had worse.”
“Course you are. Always scary the first time your alpha gets hurt. It’s not easy being married to a lawman.” Her voice was gentler this time, and he looked up to meet her eyes. “Now, he’s going to need your help when you get him home. Do you know any remedies?”
“You’re right. Let’s see what there is to eat in this town.”
“Well, you know, Kittenbot 3000 is the hot new pet of the future,” Tony said with a wink. “How goes the new fashion line?”
“Well, I mean, nothing is impossible obviously, we have enough experience to know that, but unlikely, sure.”
Steve raised his eyebrows. “Seems it’s never dull in these circles.” He looked at Tony. “And you, sir? Have you caused a scandal? If it’s not too rude to pry.”
"More than," Steve said. "We’ve been away too long.”
Tiberius scowled. “That’s simply because Fury knows my worth. He would not risk me being used for anything but the most prestigious fights.”
“Hmmm?”
“So I can make you rest. Captain’s orders.” But he had a glint in his eye that told Tony he could be convinced.
“Come on,” Bruce said gently, tugging his blanket tighter around himself. “Let’s meet him at the hospital.”
“Oh am I?” Tony asked, spotting his prey across the street. “I didn’t notice. Now are you going to lend me your arm, or am I supposed to risk taking a tumble?”
“I do,” Tony answered, finally spooning up the last of his meal and swallowing it down. Now he could be honest, he was sure. “I like novels, though I’m also partial to the sciences and mathematics. I like to learn.”
Steve flushed. “I just wanted to get you something special. You’re always surprising me with all these great presents and trips away, I just wanted you to know how much I appreciate it and how much I love you.”
Tony swallowed feeling a stone settle in his stomach.
The man hesitated, looking nervous, and Steve lifted him off the ground. “Tell me!”
Tony turned and gave the man a stiff smile. “Just travelling, same as you, sir. If you don’t mind, I’d like to get back to my reading. So...have an enjoyable journey.” He looked back at his book, trying to ignore the alpha’s presence.
Stíofán drove in harder, feeling his own need nearing its peak but wanting that sweet bleat in his ears. He slipped his hand down to pull on Tony’s cock, making him shout.
Natasha showed him recipes for remedies that helped healing, beat infection, and helped reduce pain: everything that Steve would need. She made up some for him to take along, with instructions for making his own when he ran out. He was very grateful.
“Can I cut my hair?”
“Ma will help.”
Tony looked confused. “...Yes? We aren’t, unless there’s something you haven’t told me.”
“Like that is it?” Tony asked, voice amused and Stíofán tried not to blush beneath his beard. He was glad it hid his cheeks, having been able to grow it in the longer, thicker style his people preferred now that he was free. Tony kept his short, something widely talked about along with his olive skin but Stíofán had a feeling one more winter might change that if his cold pink cheeks were anything to go by.
As he stepped into the atrium, Pepper hurried over to him looking frazzled.
“What did you do that for?” He whined at Sam, who looked pleased with himself. “I can’t go to a party. I don’t have anything to wear, and I don’t know anyone.”
She thought they’d been clever, picking the same state but J.J was still 5 and a half hours drive away. He wouldn’t be there when she had a rough day or standing up for her when someone gave her a hard time for being an omega who dared to have opinions. No shoving each other when they watched horror movies or skipping rocks by the lake.
He helped Tony to his feet, letting the doe take him by the hand and lead him behind the kitchens, hidden mostly from sight. He pushed Tony up against the wall, his hands already wrapping around those hips that were becoming softer by the day. He undid the knot of his wrappings, pulling out his cock, and pushed up the back of Tony’s shift. The round, furred buttocks looked so plush and inviting. He’d never get tired of that sight.
Stíofán held him for a moment longer and then pushed him back. “You bucks enjoy the rest of the afternoon.”
Steve gave him one last smile and headed for the elevators, without mishap this time, and Tony tapped his phone against his chin. He wondered when Steve’s first day was.
“Oh good, good.” The sheriff pointed to a large-ish building ahead of them. “Come on then, Let’s go speak to the clerk. Also, if he makes a fuss, I do apologise. People in this town have been waiting for me to get hitched, and my making a match with an out-of-towner, especially one so-” he looked over Tony who felt himself preen at the attention, “if you don’t mind me saying, Mr Stark, so beautiful. It’s going to cause quite a stir.”
They’d ended up sharing the meal Tony had brought, and Tony had waited in the office until Steve could go home so they could walk back together. It was easily one of the nicest afternoons Steve had ever spent.
He had to leave. He could feel the emotion starting to break through his mask, and he needed to leave before he lost control.
Sam directed him to some buns that needed icing, and Tony dutifully covered them carefully with the thick sugary syrup.
Tony didn’t turn around, still staring at Peter. “Yes but we talked about this, didn’t we Peter, we recited it on the way over. What is the rule?” He was trying to reign in his frustration, but it was there, at the edge of his voice.
Sam came up behind him tapping him on the shoulder. “Time to ride out. You ready?”
“Yeah, ‘s nice.”
He was thinking about it as he walked towards the kitchens early one evening. There had been an announcement of a large games in the summer, to celebrate the emperor’s birthday. It would mean rich rewards if he fought well, which was good, though the most enticing offer had been boon from the emperor himself to any man willing to fight to take on a great challenge. It was a risk. The prize might be offered in earnest, but men in power did not like to lose. It’s possible the tasks were made to be unwinnable. Stíofán had considered it, but it was too dangerous he’d decided. For now, there was no reason they couldn’t wait, play it safe until another option made itself known.
“The little Cap-burrito thing you’ve got going on there definitely says that, yes.”
“I did it wrong,” Tony hissed, feeling a lump in his throat. “I must’ve used salt instead of sugar! It tastes awful. And the first bite any of those vipers have of it, they’re going to know.”
“Then come on then Sheriff,” Tony said, and it came out a purr. “Show me what I’ve been missing.”
Then the mouth pulled off, and Tony sighed at the loss.
Steve slammed them on, the bike coming to a halt and floating in mid-air, and Tony sighed in relief.
As he got close, he could feel his muscles tensing. That beautiful creature would be in his room, waiting for him. It was almost too good to be true.
The sheriff followed his eye line and blanched. “I wasn’t-”
“I guess we...watch it? Make sure it doesn’t wilt or whatever plants do. Otherwise you’ll be down a kidney I guess,” Steve said, with an impish grin that Tony refused to find charming. “But that’s fine, you know you only need -”
The click of the door told him it was futile to attempt to leave, since Tony would never be less than thorough, though he did consider simply breaking the door down with his above-human strength.
It was a great, hulking beast, heavyset muscles beneath the thick fur and the sharp teeth glistening. Stíofán charged forward, swinging his sword. The manticore swatted at him, an angry roar ripping from its throat. He used the shield to block, the claws making a horrible sound as they scraped down the metal. He slashed at the legs, managing to catch the edge of one and drawing a shallow wound.
- that’s
The dog looked at Peter.
“It is.”
“I’m glad. I’ve always loved cats. Never really been in a position to have one of my own though.” The tabby tilted her chin so he could scratch the white fur beneath.
S’Teve’s heart seemed to pound faster as he marvelled at the gesture. He met Tony’s gaze and realised he didn’t need to sense Tony’s emotions to see the hope in his eyes. He reached out, touching his own two fingers against Tony’s in the Vulcan way.
“What’s the bet he brings nothing to contribute to the food for the dance?” The redhead tittered, delighting in the gossip.
By the time the train pulled into the station, Tony’s insides were in knots. He’d been so focused on getting here that he’d hardly thought about what that would actually mean. Tony hurried to the lavatory to change. It wouldn’t do to meet his new alpha in travelling clothes.
Tony winced. “Ouch. Does she struggle with balance?”
“I’m sure he’d be fine Tony, the ground’s got safety padding,” Steve offered, looking concerned, but fear made Tony snap.
Had he mentioned he was hot?
“Well not anymore.”
“Hey.” She turned back and raised a brow at him. “You look nice.”
“And I will be the size of fattened pig and you’ll have me at your mercy, is that it?” Tony purred. “Unable to do anything but lie here and wait for you to come home. Is that what you secretly wish?”
There was a sigh, and then Tony rocked forward as Steve grabbed the hem and pulled until Tony popped free.
“I did,” Tony confirmed, his voice sharp and full of fight. “This man thought our son had stolen something - not that he had
Stíofán nodded. “I know.” He covered Tony’s hand with his own. “Promise me you’ll go. There’s a handful of coins to get you started, and the rest of the money is sewn into my old tunic for safekeeping. Wear that tomorrow, so you’re ready.”
“I’d love to.”
Tony had to blink at his words, the threat of tears almost taking over. He smacked Steve’s arm. “How is it you always know what to say?”
“What?”
“Hello, I’ve heard a lot about you,” he told her, accepting the hug when it was given and inviting her to place her hands on his belly, a pleased smile on his face.
Stíofán pretended to think for a moment before he rolled them over, wrapping a hand around Tony’s cock and worshipping him with his hand and mouth until he spilled again, his cries muffled by a kiss.
“How am I supposed to do my job now,” Steve panted, hips moving constantly, the slap of skin loud in the room. “Knowing I got this at home, huh? That I can come back and have you whenever I want.” He groaned. “Or wherever. God, number of times I had to excuse myself because I saw you bent over the stove, that pert behind on display, or those gorgeous lips wrapped around something.” He put both hands on Tony’s hips now, thrusting harder. “Number of times, I just wanted to bend you over the kitchen table, take you till you were near delirious with how good it felt. Or in the stable, you sitting atop me trying to keep your seat like I taught you.”
“Okay, how does a guy who can do a perfect backflip off a bus without breaking a sweat manage to look like he’s never even heard of the word ‘graceful’?”
The alpha tipped his hat obligingly. “No trouble at all. You enjoy your day now.” And walked off towards the ticket office.
Tony walked the kitchen gardens, and then came out onto the lawn.
If he had to buy one more soulmate gift this year he was going to scream. He might as well get a subscription to soup tureen monthly.
When he glanced back Steve was looking more relaxed and Tony felt a shimmer of hope that maybe he hadn’t blown it after all.
and a photo of one of Tony’s high school friends and another woman, faces pressed together with both of them holding lit matches.
Tony glared at him. “I doubt it. Stark Industries doesn’t work with people like you.”
A sick pup, an argument, Tony being very brave and Steve making a big decision.
It wasn’t only the kids who looked at him with pleading eyes. Stíofán chuckled. It wouldn’t be long before he was telling stories to a bigger audience and he couldn’t wait.
“I heard you're from New York,” the other omega said, eyes bright behind a pair of dark glasses and even darker hair. “That’s real keen. What’s it like?”
“Don’t even start. Jarvis projected an article onto the front lawn about how Johns Hopkins is still the best-rated medical school and wouldn’t take it down until I read it. Neither one of them would admit who did it but my money’s on Dad with Pops covering for him.”
“I understand. And I want to start making it up to you. So, tomorrow, how about I start teaching you how to ride?” The alpha hummed. “Maybe we should go over to the Barton farm and get you a horse of your own.”
“Don’t sweat it. We can spare some extra food. I promise. Now, let’s go.”
“I got to go in ten minutes, I need the refill now,” the man at the other table grumbled. Steve rolled his eyes, and shot Tony an apologetic look before heading over to pour coffee into the man’s mug. Tony hoped he’d come back, but once he was done there was a shout from the kitchen and Steve wandered away. Tony wasn’t too worried this time though. The coffee and doughnut were delicious, he’d definitely be coming back for a return visit.
He took out his wallet, flashing the green as Pepper saw the last woman through the door and returned to their spot on the floor.
Deciding it would be too easy for them to call his bluff, he chose truth. “My husband is not here. I suggest you leave.”
“That would be great.” Steve rubbed at the icing on his face and Tony laughed.
The manticore shrieked, its huge wings beating down, the gust sending Stíofán back several steps.
He was never accepting a gift from Rhodey ever again.
Fury pushed open the door to the cafe, his one eye scanning the room. “Nice place you found to hole up in Captain Rogers.”
Tony groaned. Yes, that’s what he wanted. What he’d wanted all this time.
“Yes sir,” the man replied, gesturing to another and going out the exit to the stairs. Pierce pointed to the guard who had hit Tony. “Bar the door. He’s not getting in.”
He looked up to see Doc Bruce in the doorway and gave him a nod. The doctor noticed Tony and dropped his voice to a low murmur. “He’s been up since last night. Stress.”
“I can’t, I--”
The twins cheered, taking off at a sprint to be the first one to grab at the greenery on the newly ploughed field.
The man in blue pulled out a communicator from his belt. “Building’s clear. Rescue team can enter. Turn the power back on.”
“My ankle, I can’t walk.” he managed pitifully, and he expected some exasperation but instead, Mr Stark’s face turned soft.
Stíofán would see to it.
“It could,” Steve agreed. “But I promise I’ll always do my best to come back to you. I won’t leave you if I can help it. And if something ever goes wrong, Bucky and Sam will help you, Ma too. You won’t have to face anything alone.”
“No need,” Tony waved a hand. “We have to get used to a dog in the house, why not start now?”
“Your call,” the man said, and with barely any effort at all, he flicked the man sideways, sending him careening out the broken window, the guard screaming as he plummeted.
“Tony.”
“Hi!” A voice called from somewhere inside the shop, though no matter how much Steve ducked and squinted he couldn’t see the source. He wandered in further, his eyes sweeping over the tacky junk littering the place.
Steve walked forward, carrying Tony with ease. He closed the bedroom door behind them, not even bothering with the light as they tumbled onto the bed.
“Oh? How interesting,” Tony said casually, sipping his own drink. The bartender was making her way over now, face like thunder.
“What about that one?” Jarvis offered, pointing a small paw at a part of the coastline that jutted out, creating a small harbour. Even from here, it looked perfectly picturesque.
Steve swallowed, feeling a lump in his throat. “I’ll keep that in mind.” He started the bike and felt the rumble of the engine settle under his skin. “Goodbye.”
“I’ll handle it. Come on, come sit down a second.” He started leading Tony over to his chair before realising he didn’t even want him in the same room as the guy. Instead he tugged Tony through the connecting door to the cafe, noticing Rhodey clock them as soon as they entered.
“Yes.”
“Tony, please.”
The finger moved with more certainty, pressing inside with gentle rocking motion. Tony could feel himself tense, despite his attempts at relaxing. The finger tilted upwards, and suddenly there was an odd feeling, a pressure that was..strange but not unpleasant. Sort of nice really. Tony felt his muscles relax with every brush, and soon he was feeling warm and loose.
“If you’ve got time to speculate, Deputy Wilson, then I’d best assign you some more work,” the Sheriff said, his tone friendly but firm and the Deputy seemed to catch the note with a wave of his hand.
He kissed her forehead before pulling away. “You need anything, you know your Pops and me will be on a plane in an instant.”
Peter cheered, and Steve gave him a peck on the head as they walked. He wondered if the proprietor Mrs Pym might also be kind enough to watch Peter for a few minutes.
“Can I ask where you’re from originally?” Steve asked.
Tony glared at the ground. “You want me to launch a cat prosthetic, without a cat???”
Steve smiled, though there was an odd twist to it. “I guess that’s true.”
“There’s always another option! We have time, we can plan.”
“That wasn’t the best impression,” the doe said, readjusting the silk so it lay better. “I am Antonius.”
“No,” Steve said softly. “I said I didn’t like what you were becoming. You were being chipped away bit by bit by Stane, he was making you more and more like your dad and I could see that you hated it, but you kept at it anyway.” He sighed. “I may have said yes when Natasha suggested this, but it doesn’t mean I haven’t followed what you’ve been up to. Stopping weapons development, expanding on medical and clean energy. You’ve been doing great, Tones.”
“Will the doctor make him better?”
He felt a little faint.
He felt the scratch of Steve’s beard as he pressed a soft kiss to the back of Tony’s neck. “That’s been clear to me since you compared me to a grunting hog. I couldn’t help but think about what a spitfire you were.”
Thanks very much to MountainRose who was my science beta 💖 the verdict was 'That's not how acids work irl' but that I could definitely do it XD
“Oh, uh, hmmm, how about...Friday?”
Steve grinned, giving the bike a rev. “Lead the way.”
All in all, it was fine.
He’d wanted to give her the flowers when she’d been sick with a cold, he remembered, as he stepped forward to hug her tight. “I can’t either.”
“Dad!” Peter cried, and he sounded panicked. Then he scowled.
Tony nestled into his arms for a moment, and then pulled back. “Let’s find some water for clean up, then I need to sleep. It was hot in the kitchens all day, made me tired.”
Tony held out his hand to shake. “Tony.”
Tony’s heart stopped. “Steve?”
And they had danced. Tony knew he shouldn’t have, that dancing with someone who could never be yours was like a form of self-flagellation. But he hadn’t been able to help himself. Rhodey often extended an invite to the local militia. If that soldier truly cared for Mr Rogers then he would be here, sweeping him off his feet.
“Okay, okay.” Steve opened the bottle with a pop, letting the foam drip all over him before he upended the bottle and -
“Depends, “Steve shot back. “Do I get to see you?”
“He’s great,” Steve said, and Jarvis purred, the traitor.
He knew Steve, and he was sure that if Peter was their only child it wouldn't change anything. But that didn't take away the longing for either of them. He knew he was lucky to have an Alpha who cared more about him than expanding their brood. But that didn't mean he didn't desperately want to give Steve another pup. So far nature had failed to get with the programme.
“Sounds lovely.” He tried to think of what else to talk about. “So, what is it going to be like living here? What’s your day like?”
Tony woke to a loud banging, his heart in his throat as Steve leapt out of bed, grabbing his gun from the dresser.
“No it isn’t. Sit your ass down.”
“Just a mutton stew, nothing too special.” He took a little package wrapped in butcher’s paper and a jar from under the towel and took it over to Wilson. “But I didn’t want to be rude, so I brought you and Deputy Barnes some fresh biscuits, and some butter to put on them.”
When he stood up, Tony was staring at him wide-eyed. “Nice aim there. Jesus.” Tony walked over to the guy gingerly and grabbed the kitten, tucking it into his arms and moving back behind the counter. “I should call the police.” Tony was starting to tremble, and Steve realised that for all he’d seemed calm and confident, he wasn’t unaffected. He stepped forward, wrapping his hand around Tony’s elbow.
Tony snorted. “Oh well if you’re the best, I can hardly say no.” Steve grinned and followed them down the hall to look through Peter’s books while Tony got the kid’s teeth brushed and face washed before wrestling him into his jammies.
“I didn’t hate that you were in the army,” Tony denied. “I hated that you wanted to sign up for another tour when Bucky had already lost his arm and you’d only just recovered from the explosion. I hated worrying about you.”
“Luis!” A voice called from the door. Both Steve and Luis turned to look to see a guy in the doorway. “I asked around town, no one will help us without asking for a pretty hefty pay-- Oh hi!”
And what could Stíofán say to that? That because he was a buck, it was his place to make sure they were safe? He had a feeling that wouldn’t go down well.
“Nah, it’s fine. I’m mostly working on my bike. Closest thing to flying I can get right now.”
He sounded so sure that Tony couldn’t find it in him to disagree. He’d never been told he was special for something that wasn’t his magic or his family’s business.
“A blob. There’s no other way to describe it. It’s big, it’s destroying the city, and we need to stop it.”
“Then, yes. I am ready.”
“Some people can’t let go of hope I guess,” Tony agreed. “Even when it’s clear that hope is all it is.”
“Alright. ‘
“Did you wake me just to brag? Because if you did I hate you,” Rhodey grumped, and Tony flapped a hand he couldn’t see.
“Noted.”
“Ugh! Et tu, Brute?” Tony cried, slapping a hand on the table.
“What’re you clinging so close for?”
“Sorry nana,” Peadar echoed, looking somewhat chastised.
“Are you undertaking a courtship with anyone?” S’Teve said, surprising himself almost as much as Tony, if the expression on his face was anything to go by.
Tony tried not to react. His grandpa had told him stories about Steve’s luck with the ladies, and well, he’d always suspected. “It’s not a problem. Nice and slow. This is meant to be fun, right?”
“I shouldn’t, I-”
“I grow tired of waiting, Tony,” Pierce drawled, and Tony felt the henchman’s gun thud into his kidney, forcing him to his knees. Ow.
The doctor completed his examination and smiled. “Congratulations. You’re pregnant.”
Tony grinned and turned so he could kiss him. “Well then, it seems we have some catching up to do.”
With the alpha’s help, he and Tony secured the ropes around the axle and led the horse carefully forward until the weight was suspended. “If the cart shifts forward, he’ll be made into jam,” Tony told Mr Barton quietly. “It needs to be still.”
Steve hummed neutrally, pushing the magazine back at Clint.
“Depends on what Sam says. He said he’d message me when he knew more.” He pulled out his phone, realising there was a notification. “Oh that must be him.”
Tony wanted to snap, but he bit his tongue. It wouldn’t do any good now.
He shifted slightly in his suit. Was it getting warmer in here?
He reached his door, and with a deep breath, pushed it open.
“I’ll tell you what’s going on, sheriff! Your omega assaulted me!”
She took him inside and sat him down at the large table in her kitchen. It smelled pleasantly of herbs and spices, and it was warm beside the stove. She pushed a cup of tea into his hands and took out a large box, which she began to unpack.
“Rhodey, I still have that cake to bake for tomorrow. If it’s not done tonight I can’t ice it in the morning, and they need it for the party.”
Mrs Rogers had given great instructions for latticing, and he’d managed without too much trouble. He clapped his hands excitedly.
A tentative grin spread over the Sheriff’s face, and Tony smiled in return. They finished their breakfast in comfortable silence, and Tony thought that maybe not all was lost after all.

Tony ran his eyes over Steve. “Yes, I have no doubt.”
“I don’t think so. I haven’t tried a lot of stuff.”
“Why sexy bedroom photos? And why me?”
“An airship?” Now that was interesting. Not that Tony couldn’t already make things fly if he wanted to, but he’d be interested in getting a look at it, all those gears and inner workings. He felt that perhaps it was best not to mention the ‘make things fly’ bit. He had a feeling if he did they’d make him show Steve, and he didn’t want to say no to them after how kind they’d been, but he certainly didn’t want to do Steve any favours.
His mind worked fast thanks to the serum, taking in the lower half of someone beneath a car, the straining jack beneath the frame close to breaking. He hit the brakes with a screech, off his bike and by the car parked in the driveway just in time to take the weight of it as the jack gave way.
From what he could see, a man with dark hair seemed to be in charge, speaking into an earpiece on the other side of the room.
“Well then you won’t mind taking it to be on the safe side,” Tony replied, giving him a look, and Steve sighed.
Kamala burst out laughing, trying to cover it behind her hand and Maria felt her stomach swoop. “I’m good, thanks. But how about we go check out the coffee situation? I saw a kiosk in the quad.”
“Then this will seem like a luxury,” Stíofán joked, and the doe gave him a soft smile.
“I told you he was pushing himself too much!”
“Uh-huh.”
Probably because he was under a pile of guys all wrestling on the floor trying to put each other in headlocks. It didn’t look too violent, but it wasn’t friendly either.
Dread hit his stomach like a stone.
It was a nice place. Kept as clean as somewhere that dealt in motor oil could be, and the comforting sound of the radio playing in the back. There was the sound of a door opening and then a man walked into the main area, still drying his hands on a rag.
Maria blushed. She spotted two familiar figures behind them and grinned. “Shuri! Azari!”
Stupid cute alpha. Tony kept his face neutral.
Tony stared at Carol. “How did you know he didn’t-”
He layered up and tugged on his brown leather jacket. He pulled on his boots, tying them tight and tucking the laces in so they wouldn’t catch. There was a buzz under his skin as he looked around his bare apartment, so devoid of any personality. It felt right to leave.
. “We’ll go nice and slow, how about?”
“Yes we can,” Tony told him snippily. He felt Jarvis’ paw on his ankle, a gentle reminder to mind his manners.
Tony turned and there across the room was Steve Rogers.
Tony looked angry now. “My love life is no one else’s business, but I assure you if it became a problem, I would report it to the Captain, as is required.”
“And now,” Steve was finding it hard to get the words out, his voice raspy.  “Now I’m going to be able to take you around town, all the other alphas seeing you and near dying with jealousy, because they know I’m the one who you spread your beautiful shapely legs for.”
He picked out the outfit Jarvis had chosen for him. A pair of his nicest flowing trousers, black heeled boots and a wine red embroidered tunic. He’d forgone his corset - it was too hard to lace in a small lavatory - but he thought he cut a nice figure nonetheless, so hopefully the Sheriff wouldn’t notice. Lastly, he pulled on his travelling jacket and hat. There, that would do.
The rest of the afternoon was somewhat of a blur. Tony ended up in the restaurant drinking coffee and exchanging notes. Miss Foster was very knowledgeable, and Miss Lewis was still learning but contributed plenty. She also had read several of the novels he and Steve had finished, and so offered a lively conversation about the authors.
After their first rather spectacular meeting, Tony didn’t seek Steve out straight away.
He couldn’t stop the twisting in his gut. He paced around the house unsure what to do.
Something burst through the window, the glass spraying onto the floor. Pierce twisted them away instinctively, pulling them down behind the bar. Tony fell to the floor, but around the corner he could see a long, imposing shadow cast across the floor. His heart beat fast in his chest. Who was it? Someone here to save them, or a competitor here to steal him from Pierce for his own purposes?
“I don’t see how.”
John chuckled. “Your boy knows his stuff. It’s nice to see the younger generation knows more than how to stare at their phone.”
“Yes.” His voice was hoarse and not at all believable.
Steve nodded tersely. “Let’s find the othe-“
“And you said you’d bite my hand if I took your coffee one more time.”
Tony didn’t bother to look back and simply took off at a trot as he headed for the way home. He could feel tears ready to fall as his mind tried to cope with the worry of the day and the anger he felt, but he pushed them back. The walk seemed less frightening this time around, though it didn’t stop him from flinching when a coyote crossed his path with a flash of yellow eyes.
“Pepper, breathe! What is it?”
Steve glanced over looking awkward. “The one on Friday?”
It was embarrassing. He’d gotten his heat in public, which had never happened before. He’d draped himself all over poor Tony, who had been nothing but a gentleman despite being pawed at by an omega he didn’t like, who was acting like it was his first heat. Steve groaned, hiding his face in his hands.
As Tony talked to the woman about the book she wanted to buy for her daughter, Steve watched with a sense of envy. Tony lit up when he talked about books, knew exactly which one she wanted and located it in a second.
“Oh wow really?” Luis asked, looking excited. “That would be awesome.”
Eventually he heard the creak of the bedroom door and he tensed. He was feeling jittery with anticipation, and as the alpha slid beneath the covers, he waited for the feel of the Sheriff’s hands on him letting him know he wanted to claim him. The lamp dimmed until it was off, and he felt a tendril of anticipation through his belly.
He sighed. It didn’t really matter that much, he guessed. No alpha wanted an omega that looked like him anyway. Small, slim, delicate - that was the type of omega that alphas wanted. That was very not much him, if the building he’d been thrown through last week was anything to go by. Not to mention the fact that he’d never been able to hold his tongue, not even when he was still a little guy.
“That’s so cool. Where’d you go?”
“I’m sure Somhairle will be as smitten with Bucky as he was at the festival, house or no house,” Tony said, squeezing him a little tighter. “But your doe will be in a huff, and really, what is your priority?”
“I need you to cut my corset laces, and be quick about it.”
“Great,” Steve said, looking a little shy. “I really want you guys there.”
Tony sighed, but opened the till taking out the few bills inside. Steve muscles were tense with inaction. He could stop this. But if he did his cover might be blown.
Stíofán rolled his eyes. “Well, it would certainly mean I didn’t have to worry you’d been skewed by a hot poker or knocked by a stray hammer.”
“Sit down, and put your leg on the arm. Show off the goods.”
It needed to stop. He was wasting valuable time he should be using for scientific advancement or the performance of his duties on the ship, though how he was to achieve it, he wasn’t sure.
He’d dutifully cleaned up and thought about going out to face everyone, but at the last minute decided he couldn’t handle it.
The sheriff frowned. “What? What do you mean? Of course you-”
Steve raised an eyebrow at him. “If I didn’t know any better I’d say you’re just trying to see me naked.”
He was worried about him. Tony felt a flush of warmth and leaned in. “I’m sorry. Next time I rescue someone, I’ll be sure to be quick about it.”
Well, his family
Steve snorted. “Since when?”
Stíofán nodded. “Yes sir.”
Steve’s smile went soft. “Then you don’t have to be. Not anymore. I love you, and I think right now I don’t want to let you out of my sight.”
“Sorry to interrupt,” Sarah Rogers said, looking worried but amused. She was still in her scrubs, having clearly run over from the hospital. “I just wanted to make sure my son hadn’t rattled his brains while he was out playing superhero.”
The creature tugged at its chain, whining when it stayed fast and Stíofán realised he was looking at another soul, trapped and kept in a place far from home.
“Oh, I’m sorry, Mr ‘Notes are a waste of time’. I thought you’d remember it like you always do.”
“For someone unfamiliar with it, you give the air of someone so practiced, it is as natural as breathing,” Mr Rogers said, his voice a low rumble, and Tony stepped closer to better hear it, the sound pleasing to his ear.
He looked down to see he had bent it near in half. “Oh god, I’m sorry, let me-” He bent it back, trying to make it seem difficult. “I don’t know what came over me.”
He was pretty sure Tony was still mad at him, though now he didn’t know if it would be because he’d taken off without a word or because of their exchange a few days ago.
, Steve mouthed shirt still covering half his face. But one look from the bartender and he sheepishly stood up, brushing himself off and helping Bucky up.
The wood moved, several of the thick beams popping free and Stíofán leapt forward with his heart in his throat, trying to grab the kids as they tumbled off. The wood clattered as it fell everywhere and the kids disappeared from sight.
He tried to clean, but his mind kept wandering to the worst-case scenario. Why had he not thought about the fact that being Sheriff meant his alpha might be shot at?! It had all sounded so romantic before, but now the harsh reality was making itself very clear.
“Please stop talking.”
“Care to lose these?”
Steve mounted it excitedly, revving the engine. “She’s purring like a cat, so smooth.” Jarvis meowed from the stairwell, and Steve laughed. “Well, like a Jarvis I guess.”
“I’m sorry, it’s the only way. I love you, and I’m going to do this for us.”
said, holding out a hand, and Stíofán took it grasping his forearm.
But he supposed, for his cover, it was close enough. He nodded.
It was a start, and it made Tony feel less hopeless. He helped Rhodey for the rest of the day, greeting customers and trying not to flush as Rhodey talked him up and showed off the new magic till. Near the end of the day people were clearly talking about it in the town, as there was a long queue of nosey people lining up (and thankfully buying bread and pastries as well) up until closing.
He scooped a little black one up off the floor, letting it nuzzle his face, with a soft laugh.
But he’d faced tough before, and he’d do it again. He flung his arm back with the shield clasped in his hand and let it go in a wide arc.
“Go to bed?”
At the same time, he felt an odd sense of calm. Bucky was his friend, and a good man, and he’d see Tony’s pup to safety. He knew he would.
“Wow.” Peter looked awed. “How do two dogs mix together?”
Steve’s eyes widened. “With me?”
Steve stood up, scooping Tony into his arms in one smooth move. He grabbed a sheet of paper and scribbled something on it. “Sam’ll be here in ten. I think I can slip out without causing too much fuss.”
He flicked it open, and frowned as he read it.
Tony snorted. “So that’s why people get dogs.’
Tony was definitely going to try and get his number if he could. The older he got, the fewer non-soul bonded people were on the market, and Rogers wasn’t wearing a bond ring. He wasn’t going to miss his chance.
Apparently, his body agreed.
There was a tell-tale
Rhodey’s eyes went wide. “Oh shit, are you ok?”
Steve’s blood ran cold. How had he missed that? Stupid.
Tony reached out gently to place his hand over Steve’s. “I’m glad it helped.” He cleared his throat. “I know something about needing to do something to clear your mind, so I get it.”
The sheriff gaped, apparently unable to find the words, and Tony huffed. “I’ve said my piece. I’m going home. Enjoy your night of debauchery.”
“It is,” Tony sniffed. “Doesn’t mean you couldn’t do something stupid and noble.” He flinched at the blood on Stíofán’s cheek. “You’re hurt, we need to—“
He could’ve nodded off, happy and warm with his mate in his arms. But instead, a hand slid it’s way down his chest, wrapping around the base of his cock. He kept his eyes closed, trying not to react.
“Yeah, I realised when I got back from my tour I hadn’t really spent much time anywhere but New York, so I figured, why not? Packed a bag, gassed up my bike, and hit the road.”
“You write him a letter telling him so?”
“I haven’t seen you so smitten with someone you just met in a long time,” Jan remarked, sipping her wine. “You need to get out more.”
That’s what mattered. No matter what happened tomorrow, Tony would be safe, and he’d carry Stíofán’s legacy with him, and his child would know a better life. His only regret then was that he would never know what the kid would look like, whether they would have Stíofán’s light colouring or Tony’s pretty brown eyes. He felt the tears prick in his eyes and rubbed them away roughly.
But before the true horror could grip him, Pierce’s radio buzzed in his pocket.
, that’s right. There was a reason children were never around in romance novels.
“Yes!” Maria said, way too enthusiastically for a first meeting. She was pretty sure she was blushing.
“So what if I am?”
on the other side, their shields and swords raised in preparation. And behind them, the final challenge. A great winged manticore, it’s strong lion body pulling against its binding, the scorpion tail swishing in challenge as it roared.
Tony stared at the spotless red tablecloth, unsure what to do. He felt...sad, he thought. Like he’d been punched in the gut. He should call the waiter over, pay for his glass of wine and--
“I did,” he managed, and he sounded as though he almost couldn’t believe it himself.
The guy had looked surprised when he’d seen who was scowling at him. “Fuck you. Why are you getting in my face about it?”
“I do. Seems to me like some folk around here need to be shown I married the most accomplished omega in the East.”
.” He slipped into his chair. “So what are we-- oh.”
“That’s a pity,” Steve said, his face lit with amusement. “Rather rude really.”
“True,” J.J agreed. “Movies have made that very clear.”
Stíofán placed an arm against his chest in a salute. “Thank you
Tony huffed, then after a moment, swung a leg over Stíofán’s lap. “Take me to bed.”
By the time it was getting late, Tony had several book recommendations and an invitation to see Miss Foster's telescope as soon as Steve could take him out to visit. He went to find the Sheriff with a bounce in his step.
“Tony, I’m not--”
“I know,” his voice went soft, and she felt her irritation seep away. “Things are easier for now, but we’ve been lucky here in Shield. I just worry about what it’s going to be like when you leave here and go out in the world and you haven’t got your Pops and I, or even your brother, to look out for you.”
“I think I’m finally getting acquainted with this way of living,” Tony said, perching on the Sheriff’s chair. “It was tough at first, just with everything so different, but I like the change of pace now that I’m used to it.” He grinned. “And Sheriff Rogers has been teaching me to shoot.”
“So are you just a bookseller, or do you help out here as well?”
“I put in requests with every agent we could and apparently she somehow heard about it, and she loves cats, and since she’s doing shows here this week she agreed to swing by!”
“Don’t move,” a voice said, rough against his ear. “Or I’ll shoot him.” Tony’s heart was pounding. Clearly Pierce’s goon was going off script.
Stíofán smirked. “A huff you say?”
“I don’t know,” Steve answered honestly. He felt weirdly overwhelmed, like he’d forgotten how to make small talk. “Your shop just looked interesting. My bike broke down and the mechanic suggested I take a walk while he checked her over.”
“Ah Friday,” Rhodey said, sounding more sure. “Perfect name.”
Steve turned to smile at him. “Not to worry. We’ll have that gang trussed and delivered to courts by lunchtime. It’ll be easy.”
He took a deep breath, grunting when the corset bit into his skin. God, he was growing to hate this thing. But it made him look shapely, and the last thing he wanted was to make Steve even
Jarvis had sent for the doctor on his return and he’d taken over getting the man out of his wet clothes and into bed. Tony had fought his own urge to help by going to find Peter who, though undeniably pleased at the prospect of no more lessons for the day, was upset to hear his teacher had been hurt.
He could barely feel his fingers as he wrapped them tighter in his coat, the raindrops settling on his lashes. He tried to think of something else, anything to take his mind off the cold, and his head filled with memory, the ball at Mr Rhodes’.
“Tony,” Stíofán said, lowering them down to their mat and pulling up the blanket. “Don’t get into trouble, it’s not just you anymore.” He let his hand rest on Tony’s belly. “I don’t know what would happen if you got on someone’s bad side.”
The punch never came. Instead, Tony’s arm snapped up, gripping the alpha’s wrist and twisting it down until he yelped.
“Oh my god, yes Dad. It’s not like you can’t send it if I left something behind.”
The doe looked surprised but nodded. “Ok. In which case, maybe you could start by calling me Tony? It’s what my family used to call me.”
“Let me see.” Steve’s big warm hands were on his leg, poking at a spot that made Tony hiss.
“It is, though more for Peter than for me. Mrs Stark was...not my choice. Not that she wasn’t a lovely woman, she was, but ours was a match made by our families. There was affection between us but no strong connection. We were both happy to live our lives as friends for the most part, and then it was decided we would try for a child. An heir for the estate and she wanted to be a mother, so it was for both our benefit. Although we were not in love, her loss was still a shock, and a miracle that Peter survived at all.”
The Sheriff got a stubborn set to his jaw. “Daisy’s an old girl, and she’s better for the cart since she moves pretty slow. You need your own horse for when you want to go visiting or need to move quick. We’ll go tomorrow.”
“Thank you,” Tony said to Steve, sounding a little breathless. The sheriff flushed.
“Yes Da.”
“Alright, seems like it was a misunderstanding then,” Steve started, and he saw Tony’s eyes harden. “But one that is not acceptable. Mr Bullski I suggest you not attempt to discipline anyone else's children and instead take your concerns up with their parents.”
He looked at Tony, opting not to answer, which only seemed to annoy the man more.
Instead, the sheriff was well behaved, complimenting the meal and asking Tony to read to him. Tony felt relieved that at the very least, Steve still wanted him for the company.
“Mr Hodge,” he called, raising the gun to eye level. “You’re trespassing on private land.”
“I dunno, sounds like someone’s just too scared.” She sent Carol a mischievous grin.
Steve turned the page and, leaning back into his chair, began to read aloud.
Tony opened his mouth for a rebuke. Then he closed it again. He huffed. “That’s different.”
Tony grit his teeth. “You do, and I promise you won’t walk out of here alive.” One of his staff must’ve called the police by now. Pierce would be mincemeat.
“It’s landing in the street!” Darcy yelled from the bookshop and Steve felt his eyes fall shut. He wasn’t ready for it to be over, wasn’t ready to say goodbye. He felt like crying but his eyes were dry as he turned to face the street, watching as the helicopter landed on the main street, and Director Fury stepped onto the asphalt.
“Mhmmmm.”
“What do you think?” she asked Pops, as Dad fluffed her pillow.
“I wasn’t quite sure what was best to get, as my omega’s out of town at the moment, and she usually handles gifts. But I know she always said the thing she found hardest moving out here was the climate and the work making her hands so dry,” Deputy Wilson said, gesturing to the pots. “She ended up making her own salves to fix the problem, so I thought you might benefit.”
“It didn’t feel like that to me though,” Steve said, sounding uncertain. “It felt like you didn’t think my job was important, that yours was the only one that mattered.”
He settled Peter more securely, concerned by the lack of reaction other than a soft moan. He shut that away and started walking. It wasn’t that far to town after all.
Ana smiled at the Luis story, and she and Edwin told him a few stories from their own trips over the years. “...and then a seagull flew into him and he jumped so high he tossed his sandwich over the edge of the canyon!” she said laughing, even as Edwin looked put out. “You have never seen a man so desolate over a ham and cheese sandwich.”
“Maybe Stíofán’ll let you have a turn when he’s done, share the loot,” another cackled and Stíofán could feel his shoulders tightening.
amused 😂
“Steve!” His head turned frantically, trying to catch sight of him, but there was no familiar flash of blond, no strong hand in his. He let himself be herded until he could break free, climbing up on the plinth of a statue to give himself some height. Now he could see the Avengers had arrived, along with Spiderman, to fight some green figure on a flying scooter. He could see the Hulk scaling the building, and there was Hawkeye on the skyscraper, notching an arrow. He wondered where--Oh! There he was.
“Gods,” Stíofán cursed, hurrying over to push the poles away as Bucky hurried to the other side to help uncover them. He could hear the sounds of approaching hooves but all he could focus on was getting the kids free.
in a game of dice. How he’d woken up on a boat in chains, and been sold at a market in Rome to the
“Morning Sheriff!”
Fury hummed. “Well, you’re certainly welcome to do so. I’d appreciate it since no one else has and I don’t wish to be the only
Stíofán closed his eyes and rested his head on top of Tony’s. His mind drifted, as it often did, to home. Only now, when he looked he saw Tony next to his Ma, a bundle in his arms. His kid would know happiness, and they would be loved beyond measure.
Nakia grabbed her to pull her in for a hug. “I can’t believe how well you have done.” She tilted her head. “Actually I can, you have always been brilliant.”
Peter swung an arm trying to reenact it. “It was so neat. Mr Bull pinched my ear hard, and it hurt, and I didn’t even do anything!”
Steve gave him another smile, this one softer. “I’d’ve waited as long as I had to for you.”
It felt a little less painful than those memories usually did, and he thought perhaps it was that he wasn’t sitting alone at a cafe or in his sterile, empty apartment. Edwin and Ana were kind, and he supposed it helped that they were closer to his true age than people he usually interacted with.
But more importantly, Stíofán found he liked the look of Tony in his clothes. A lot.
“Tell you what,” Tony offered, and he pointed to the pile. “You let me give you a ride home so you don’t have to carry all that junk on the subway, and in return I’ll eat dinner with you.”
“Mr Rogers! This art is amazing, you’re so talented!” Jan gushed, gesturing at the painting. “Surely yours should be the star of this show.”
“So...do you still have the Buddy costume, or…?”
“It’s kinda...on the roof?” Luis offered with a shrug. “We had a storm and the wind was like whooosh and the sign was swinging back and forth like crazy. And I was talking to Scott and he was like ‘damn, look at that sign’, and I was like ‘I know right?’, and then while we were watching the sign blew over until it was against the roof and now it’s stuck.”
Sam gave him a look. “Doesn’t mean he doesn’t date though.”
Tony blinked to focus on where both of Rhodey’s hands were on his shoulders. “None?”
“You’ve read far too many penny dreadfuls,” Tony told her, rolling his eyes.
Tony recited his order, and when he was told the total, reached into the pocket of his robe for his money. All his fingers brushed up against was the inside of his robe. He frowned, digging more desperately. He switched pockets, checked his jeans and dug through his bag. Then he froze. The hand on his robe during the chase. Fuck, his wallet must’ve fallen free. Oh god. He had no money.
They went inside, the door closing shut behind them as Steve took a seat at his desk. “I liked it.”
Suddenly, strong hands caught his arm, another coming around to wrap tight around his waist, and for a moment he thought it must be Steve, and the relief sparked through him. He turned to greet his husband, but the words caught in his throat as he was swamped in disappointment.
“You never know what you might need!”
Pops shot in a moment later. “Tony what’s-“ His eyes landed on the envelope in his hands. “Is that-?”
Tony took one final deep breath and nodded, and Stíofán led them down the hill.
“Yes,” she sighed. “We have to leave in like half an hour, I don’t know why he couldn’t just skip it. He’s usually the organised one.”
He made the rounds with Jan speaking to a few people she pointed at - Jan knew everyone - and pretending to care about a canvas that was just painted blue or a drawing of a watermelon that supposedly represented the human struggle or whatever.
To say that Tony had a relaxing night sleep lying up against the hot, smooth muscles brushing against his back would be a lie, but to say he spent the night warm and aptly covered by both quilt and alpha would do just fine.
“That’s enough out of you,” Stíofán told him, and scooped him up into his arms, making Tony squeal with laughter.
wanted.”
“Captain Rogers,” a man in a suit walked into the room and handed over something round and metallic. “The civilians are being cleared out. Also we found this downstairs. Figured you might like it back.”
Captain America had a job to do.
“Ugh,” Clint said, and Steve jumped slightly, having completely forgotten he was there. “You two are gross.”
Tony looked a little sheepish. “A man should be entitled to a little mystery.”
“Yes. Flirt, Cap. Trust me, there are a handful of rich widowed omegas who’d love to shove money in your tux for hungry orphans or puppies who need operations. You just have to sweet talk them a little, maybe bounce those pecs of yours.”
Tony managed to get moving, and he followed after them, watching as they took his husband inside the building. He followed inside without any thought, only to be blocked by Deputy Barnes.
“Clothes, check, toolbox, check, money…I think that’s it.” He looked around the room. “Jarvis, anything else?”
Steve burned with curiousity but bit his tongue. It really wasn’t his business.
The deputy paused, looking confused. “Mr Rogers, I’m not sure that’s proper.”
“She did,” Steve agreed. “So she could send money to help people.”
They kept at it for a while, the alpha adding another finger and moving them in interesting ways.
“Why?”
Steve looked at the painting then back and shook his head. He smiled, turning it so Tony could see through the clear plastic.
The emperor raised an eyebrow. “You released the manticore. Can you call that defeat?”
Tony’s illness had also thankfully cleared up, and he was back eating well which made Stíofán feel better too, though he was growing more nervous as the games approached.
“Tony! Steve!”
Also it now has art! My dear friend B drew Steve with all his new kitty friends for me as a present 😍😍😍
Tony laughed, half amused, half relieved. “Not at all Sheriff. I am as eager to make sure our match is above board as you are, so we might get started on getting to know each other.”
There was the sound of skin hitting skin - a series of thuds and grunts - and Tony pushed himself up to peer over the counter.
“Thank you,
“I hear giggling and no sleeping,” Tony said as he pushed back the furs at the entrance to the house.
There was a sharp intake of breath, and Tony turned his head on the mattress to look back at Steve questioningly.
“A witch?” Steve looked interested then, and that made Tony madder. So it was ok to be rude to him, but if he was a witch he deserved basic human decency? No thank you.
Free to finish, Stíofán gave a dozen more messy thrusts before he finished, curling around Tony and burying his face in the curls between his horns. When he had caught his breath, he pawed around for a rag, wiping them down and tossing it aside for washing. As he laid back, Tony curled up on his chest, tugging the furs to their shoulders.
“I know.” Tony leaned against him, setting the half-eaten bowl of soup aside. “Steve, what if he--”
“And so modest,” Steve replied with a grin. He took a long drink from his beer and Tony found his eyes drawn to the foam it left on his top lip.
Stíofán looked at him. “You like the way I look?”
“Get trapped under the pile of takeout boxes in your lab and die?”
“My magic,” Tony snorted. “The way my magic works. It makes things do what they’re made for to the best of their ability. And you Steve Rogers have been going on and on about how that thing was going to make you fly! You didn’t build a bike, you built a flying machine, and my magic knew it.” He laughed again, almost unable to believe it.
Tony’s mind helpfully flashed to his laundry basket with the clothes he’d tossed on top and sighed.
But, he trusted Fury’s word. If he failed, Tony and the kid would be free, and he could leave them his saved coin and a letter for his Ma so she could take them in.
her tone was knowing
“I didn’t take the hit for that plant.”
“You know honey, how I was saying about how smart and sharp you were earlier?”
She snorted. “I’m going to remember this when you get a call from the college because I put some jock alpha in his place.”
“I’ll say. I think it was better this way. Like ripping off a band-aid…right?”
“It’s personal enough that you felt you needed to hide from me,” Tony said. “And I can tell it’s about me. Those pointed ears of yours give you away every time. They go bright green like old earth traffic lights.”
to a man who was exactly his type and who handled his baby with ease.
Steve picked up his bag and turned to Tony. “Course not. You’ve been so good to me, I can’t thank you enough.”
