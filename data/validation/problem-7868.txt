“Rough day?” Tony asked him quietly, letting his fingers wander over to Steve’s hand and stroke softly at his warm skin.
“I missed you too,” Tony’s voice punctured his thoughts and Steve looked up at him, watching how Tony shifted back and forth nervously, “it’s not… God, it’s been a
“Yeah, so I’ve been told,” he responded, making an effort to release the tension in his forehead. Steve looked him over analytically, before pursing his lips and dropping the jello cup down on Tony’s lap. Tony grinned. “Thanks.”
“What?” Clint snorted, “no, don’t be stupid.” Tony stopped, looking at Steve and holding a hand across to him before the man began to drive like a maniac back toward the tower. “He’s just said his first words!”
“Yes I do. I really, really do,” Steve tells him gently, standing close to Tony, almost forehead to forehead, and of course Tony was whispering to himself again, that was a
It hardly made any sense. But Fury was pulling up evidence; grainy photos, statements from agents that they’d had tailing Tony. Nothing official, but enough. It was enough.
Tony tutted smile playing on his face as he watched Steve take a sip and savour the taste it left in the back of his throat. “Pace yourself,” he warned, “that stuff’s strong as shit.”
Right. Breathing.
The work managed to save him about three hours. That was actually good, all things considered. Steve must have been busy. But he still ended up knocking on the door of Tony’s workshop about 192 minutes later- not that Tony had been purposely counting. It was just that once he started on the numbers, it was hard to stop, and he ended up doing it for sort of… everything.
He was pretty sure kids didn’t fight like that.
Steve just laughed and then leaned back, sliding away in order to hold onto the railings behind him and look down at Tony. He looked absolutely ravishing; well fitted jeans and a blazer, with a dress shirt tucked in and creasing around washboard abs Tony knew were underneath. As he leaned back onto the rails, the fabric stretched to try and accommodate the flex of his muscles. Tony wanted to tear the whole thing right off him. Alas, there were a few more hours to go before Tony got to do that, so he resigned himself with simply observing. That was half of the fun anyway.
“It’s 11 at night, sweetheart,” Steve slid gently into the room and shut the door. “He’s probably gone home and fallen asleep.”
“I am not sure!” Thor said jovially, his voice about ten times louder than usual, which was saying something- “but it certainly seems to have worked!”
“Some sort of adhesive qualities to his skin, from what we can see,” Tony jumped in, and when the team all looked at him blankly, he waved a hand. “He stuck to Steve’s arm and wouldn’t let go.”
“So I can do the dishes?”
Tony was making fun of him in front of his friends. Trying to make out like Steve was what, some desperate ex?
“Guess we should get digging then,” Tony said with a shrug of his shoulders, trying to squash down the wave of apprehension that curled over his chest. It wasn’t going to be fun, but it was going to be necessary. For Peter’s sake.
“Sir keeps a duffle bag full of essentials in all his cars, and he had already prepacked a suitcase before he left. I assume it would contain at least enough to last him a week.”
But he hadn’t. Tony had survived, and Steve had come to the conclusion that he was deeply in love with him, and life had moved on.
“The flight from here to Steve’s location could take hours on the plane—”
, how could I do that to him Natasha, I have to… I need to see him, I need to-”
Steve tried to reply something witty, but his brain chose that moment to freeze up and leave him stood there like an idiot, staring blankly at the ink on his forearm. Tony just looked down at him and laughed again, taking a step backward. “Oh, you really are adorable,” he said, shoving his hands in his pockets.
Tony pulled it out of his back pocket and handed it over to Steve whilst simultaneously getting up from where he’d been knelt and moving to sit on the bed next to Steve instead, eyes on the cut over his forehead. Steve bit his lip and dialled quickly, Bucky’s number coming quick from memory.
, and he valued it more than he probably should. Tony trusted him with it- Tony was texting him about it, and that… it meant a lot.
“I’m gonna—I’m gonna get some stuff,” Steve said, and Tony wasn’t sure how much time had passed, it was just going over him like a blur as he watched Steve slowly slip away, head down, looking at the floor. “I… I think I’ll head out to DC for a while, see how… yeah.”
Like an idiot.
It didn’t, not really, not to the overprotective mess of anxiety that was making its home in his brain, but he didn’t really have much choice. So he agreed quietly and then ran a hand through his hair, leaning forward and bracing his elbows against his knees. He wanted to go over there and check up on Tony himself- something felt wrong, and Steve couldn’t put a finger on it, but he knew that it was there. It was probably just his anxiety, like he’d said before, and he knew that Tony was more than capable of looking after himself- he just worried anyway. Steve was very good at that.
“I’m scared, Tony,” Steve cut in with a sigh, clearly wanting to rip the bandaid off and just blurt it out, “I am scared of touching the baby. It’s not-- it's absolutely not that I don’t think you’re a person I’d want to settle down with, that’s completely insane. I love you more than anything. Starting a family with you would be…” he looked down, blushing a little. “It’d be perfect,” he finished softly.
“I wish I could take it all back,” was all that managed to come out, knowing that wasn’t enough, but wanting to try all the same, “I wish I had… God, I wish I’d never fucking let you go. You were the best thing to ever happen to me. And I promise, I’ll tell you everything you need to know, okay. I can’t change what I did, but I can choose what I do now, at least. I wasn’t very high-up in SHIELD, but I’ll give you anything that can be useful. Then I’ll get out of your hair.”
,” he said the last bit louder and craned his head up to Thor, “because I should be getting back to a project, Thor-“
He nodded, smiling at her. “I know,” he answered, “but I don’t think I’d last very long here without Tony anyway.” When she refused to waver, he just sighed. “Susan, you don’t need to worry about me. I’ll go back and save Tony, and you will never even remember this. It’ll all turn out fine.”
He nodded, and she noted some more things down before beginning talking again; mostly stuff that went in one ear and out the other, because she’d been right about him being out of it that day. His mind was elsewhere, and he happily let it drift as she spoke- thinking about Bucky and his new car that had already broken down on the road when he’d been supposed to pick Natasha up for their date night, about Tony’s laughing face and promise to help him fix it up for free rather than spend a fortune at the garage. Bucky sure had been grateful for that, and Steve was absolutely convinced they were friends now- no matter what they kept muttering when Steve asked them.
He didn’t know why else Tony would have acted like that. He was out, Steve was almost sure of it- pretty much everyone in school knew everything about him, although God knows why, and Tony didn’t exactly try and hide the fact he went for guys too. So there were no other things that Steve could think of as to why Tony would have reacted like that, aside from the fact that… well, that Tony just wasn’t supposed to be seen hanging around with someone like Steve Rogers.
So anyway. The team are all Bonding and Growing Together and stuff, and Tony is just out on a limb, because he doesn’t know how to fucking
He rushed away, jumping in the air and tapping his heels together joyously as he did so. Behind him, he heard Steve’s laughter, and for the first time in weeks, Tony couldn’t think of a single damned thing that would make him happier.
Tony just spluttered, looking a little bit overwhelmed. “Steve,” he said, voice hoarse, “Steve, you Goddamn… you just rescheduled all my meetings like that without even… Dammit, I should be way more mad at you for doing that, what the fuck?”
But Tony felt it, and he glanced back at Steve, looking into his eyes for a second. There was panic there; a rabbit caught in the headlights of an oncoming freight train, no escape in sight. Steve just nodded in understanding, even though his heart was sinking deep into the pits of his stomach.
Hell, what was Steve even thinking? The rest of the team were probably going to be just as bad. It was going to be a nightmare.
truth to Tony’s words. Stark Industries really had been double dealing without Tony’s knowledge. But that didn’t… that didn’t change the rest of it. The village—Gulmira— that had been totally wiped off the map by Iron Man. The attacks on SHIELD facilities; targeted hits to information banks that held classified and crucial data. Tony had still done that, which didn’t match to his weapons-collecting agenda he’d been talking of.
Steve was looking at him in question, and Tony couldn’t stop the admission from falling off his tongue, rapid and a little too fearful-sounding for his liking. “I
Tony’s face shone. That was the only word to describe it. “Okay,” he whispered, “alright then, let’s get married. I have—I bought a ring and everything, it’s back home, I was just—probably could have done it at a better time, somewhere a little more romantic than a hospital room, but—”
The woman's face dropped, and she turned to face Steve, reaching out to grab him. But she never made it there. Because a moment later, the wall caved in and the world burst into red and gold.
Steve looked at him somewhat suspiciously for a second, before reaching a hand out for the coffee. “Thanks,” he said, wrapping his fingers around the hot mug.
“He’s got a point, babe,” Tony said, “you’re kind of allergic to the whole…. ‘children’ thing.”
“So what- did you have to get it picked up or something?” Steve asked him, using the fact he was in the kitchen to stock up the supplies of popcorn and other terrible foods from the cupboards as he spoke.
Peter pulled his attention away from his own thoughts by smacking his palm into the glass casing of the reactor in front of him. “Appah,” he said happily, eyes gazing into the cold blue light. “Appah!”
Fury was not a man to react to things rashly. He considered the facts, the biases, the motives behind every decision. This could be faked. Stark knew his way around a computer blindfolded.
He crouched low and lay the flowers next to the headstone. His fingers brushed the stone- cold to the touch. So unlike his mother.
Right. The project Tony had gone home to work on.
He supposed, however, that being in company as he went through more of the data would probably be comforting. At the very least, it was someone to share his anger with. Someone who understood in the same way Tony did.
“Hands are going up to my ears, nope, look at this-“ Tony ducked under Steve’s arms and leaped on his bed, slapping his palms against the side of his face and covering his ears quickly.
“There’s no limit on when you can eat Cheerios,” Clint told him adamantly, hopping up onto the counter next to Natasha, “and we weren’t planning on eating anything for dinner tonight anyway. Takeout got boring after the 5
Tony, despite all these damn years of having Steve tell him that, still blushed a little, loosening his tie and then looking up at Steve with a fond roll of his eyes. “Love you too, you wasted fratboy puppy.”
He was aware that it was probably only a matter of time before HYDRA found them in this cabin. The organization was nothing if not irritatingly persistent, and right now this little faction of Avengers were sitting ducks. Maybe the rest of the team had already been dealt with, and now HYDRA were coming for the stragglers. Either way, Tony wasn’t stupid enough to know that the longer they stayed here, the more danger they were in.
If there was one person Steve Rogers hated, it was Tony Stark.
He banged his fist against Bucky’s door and waited by the front steps, stuffing his hands into his pockets and watching as Bucky’s familiar figure began to loom through the frosted glass.
“I’m not going to let everyone else decide how I live my fucking life, Steve,” Tony told him, voice strangely calm, “not any more. I’m done.”
Tony scowls, and shrugs. “Left them out somewhere- but I don’t need them to see my own two feet, Steve, only reason I fell was because your pants are-”
Steve stopped. It’d been playing on his mind too, he couldn’t deny it. But there could have been a number of explanations. “It was probably just a blank,” he supplied, “Redford must’ve forgotten about it, or maybe he’d fired it off just to scare you.” Tony still didn’t look convinced, but he nodded his head slowly all the same. He’d undoubtedly come to the same conclusion himself.
But until the streets were clear of scum, then he and his team would continue to do their job and fight to get rid of them. Many feared him- a few didn’t believe in his existence at all- but Steve's path was clear, and he didn’t plan on stopping anytime soon.
Tony was cut off as Steve skipped over to him and leant down, shutting him up with another kiss. “I love you too, idiot. Now get dressed, or Pepper will literally have my head.”
But when he got in the car, he knew that was exactly what she was.
He shuddered. Three years. Three years today, he’d been taken. His life had changed forever.
Tony winced a little at the Bucky part, and inwardly Steve made note to try and make sure Bucky was on his best behaviour when they next saw eachother. Obviously Tony hadn’t quite warmed up to him yet- and Steve didn’t blame him. Bucky
“Yes Director Fury, I’ve got him. Sending you the coordinates right now.”
Wrong. Work stuff had definitely followed. Tony could attest to that.
They smiled at eachother, and Steve realised he probably had to start heading somewhere, but found himself somewhat unwilling to remove his eyes from Tony. That smile was fucking hypnotising. It was just…
Steve frowned a little as his backpack fell off his skinny shoulders in the same way it always did when he wasn’t holding it. His hands were currently full of bags of food and supplies that Sam’s mom had sent him out to get from the mall, and so it made things rather difficult to navigate. Luckily the complex was only a few minutes away from school, and that made catching the bus with a shit ton of shopping a hell of a lot easier.
“But I’ve been in the mall for an hour.”
But yeah. That made- what- seven? Seven new people. A month in and he only knew seven new people, what the fuck was that? It was disgraceful. He could never tell Bucky or Peggy that- they’d never stop laughing.
She raised her hands in a show of peace, but shot Steve a toothy grin as he backed clumsily out of the room, face still bright red. “Okay, okay, some things stay between two phones, right? Don’t worry- secret’s safe with me,” she wiggled her eyebrows and then blew a kiss over to him as he stuck his finger back up at her and then turned on his heel, trying to retain whatever dignity he had left.
He sat up and Tony rolled off him, letting him pad across the room to grab for his uniform. It was a hassle to head all the way over to Russia on a Tuesday, but it couldn’t be helped, and Steve hoped it wouldn’t take long. These sort of Sciencey divisions of HYDRA tended to be less well equipped in dealing with a supersoldier such as himself. The people they were testing on however… well, that might be a different story.
“Make sure to be a kid, too,” he finished with a firm nod, knowing that Peter was going to understand absolutely none of this, “and I mean, if it does turn out you’re just an Average Joe in the IQ section of things, then at least you have one less superpower to worry about. You’re gonna have a lot on your plate already, I think.”
The prospect of proposal just came as a natural progression after that.
He found his phone and sent off a text to Steve, feeling pretty satisfied with his plan. In his excited, socially backward mind, he genuinely could not think of a single reason why it wouldn’t work out. Tony liked Halloween, Steve liked Tony… they could meet in the middle, surely?
His teacher looked at him for a moment, before rolling her eyes and then waving a hand. “Anyone else, then?”
“Oh, Bruce, I do love you and your projects, you know that,” Thor gave his arm a squeeze and beamed, “but human interaction is good sometimes, yes?”
Tony was dead.
In the end, he managed to arrive back at the Wilson’s place by about eight at night, and by that time, he was very much ready to go straight to sleep. Getting kicked out of a mall and then lounging around on a couch for three hours sure was exhausting. Of course, though, as soon as he even so much as thought about sleep, he ended up bumping into Sam, who managed to somehow corral him into helping him study for the science exam that he had to do the next morning and had been stuck inside studying all day for. He wasn’t exactly sure how, but by the time he actually made it into bed, it was midnight and he was pretty much dead on his feet.
The last thing he saw before Bucky jumped out and shut the door behind him was his best friend’s reassuring smile.
(It had almost happened again.)
And, of course- perfect timing as always- right as he was about to stick his tongue in Tony’s mouth and try to persuade him to discard the idea of going anywhere, his stomach decided to give a very loud and very insistent rumble.
As soon as Tony had begun speaking, Steve realised he was right.
Tony was cut off as Steve laid his hand across Tony’s moving mouth, effectively silencing the fast-derailing thought process. He couldn’t help but chuckle a little as he watched Tony just stand there, Steve’s hand over his mouth, not knowing quite what to do.
Tony opened and shut his mouth for a few seconds, before shaking his head disbelievingly.
“Ugh, no, depressing,” he waved the idea off, before clicking his fingers, “hey, you know, it’s been a while since I pulled out the piano. You wanna watch me put Beethoven to shame for a little while?” Tony’s eyebrows wiggled and he leaned in closer, “I know you love it.”
It was nice. Familiar.
been a wonderful surprise when Tony had seen it happen for the first time. “You are
“Shut the
“Go put on some pants while I make us all some food,” he whispered in the other man’s ear, “and then maybe in a few hours I’ll take ‘em off again.”
Steve found himself watching his movements again. It was funny- even off the dancefloor, Tony moved with a sort of grace that was almost hypnotic; all flowing hands and easy strides. He seemed like a person who knew where he was going,
“Sir, if I may remind you of the concepts we went through about jokes and humor when initiating conversation-“
“If the signal shorted, the fault would have been catalogued and I would have known about it.” He bit his lip and looked at her seriously, the panic in his chest now unable to be held back properly. If Steve had gone down in the middle of a HYDRA base full of potentially enhanced soldiers… “I need to go after him,” he declared with a nod, pulling back. “I think he’s in trouble.”
“I- yeah, sure Steve,” he said, nodding, “I’ll be there.”
Of course, he’d only been a young child then. Seven, maybe. Now he didn’t cut his apples into squares or take the skin off, even if he still preferred it that way. Mom wasn’t even there to do it for him any more. His mom was dead, actually. It was funny how that hit him sometimes- completely out of the blue. She's dead. She's not coming back.
Tony just shook his head. “You didn’t need to start a fight with him, Steve,” he said quietly, “I assume you just got suspended, otherwise you wouldn’t be here right now. That’s gonna be on your school record forever, now. Colleges are gonna see that.”
everyone yelled simultaneously, and Bucky shielded himself as various objects were thrown at him in response, Steve giving him an exasperated shove and sending him into the wall.  “All right, all right- no punching. Plus I’m not sure which one of us would win anyway, and I’m not up for having my pride hit like that. Don’t worry, your pretty boy’s safe.” Bucky shot him a look, and Steve just sighed fondly, knowing Bucky was pulling his leg.
“And I just wanted to give you some money,” Tony added helpfully.
"What? No, Miss, I'll put it away-"
see his obvious crush at this point- he was pretty sure the hermits that lived in caves on the other side of the world were aware of it.
And now he was here. At Tony’s house. About to see him again a year after breaking up, and intending to lie blatantly throughout the whole night, while also seducing him into giving Steve the information he wanted.
He decided against that, however. He was on his last warning with school at that point- the next would mean a three-day suspension, and he would really rather not have to deal with that. Plus, he didn’t actually fancy getting his ass kicked in the middle of a school cafeteria. Tiberius wasn’t worth that much to him, to be quite honest. Just some slimy asshole who seemed to think he had a say in what Steve did and didn’t do.
“I understand,” Tony told him with a small smile, “I...I think my mom would have liked you a lot too, Steve.”
walk, you know.”
So he stumbles upright and Steve steadies him, firm and strong and warm as he always is. Tony isn’t particularly aware of where he’s going, because Steve pretty much just carries him the whole way there and Tony is fine with just letting his head fall against Steve’s shoulder and stay there. Possibly for the rest of his life. He wouldn’t complain.
Seemed Steve just couldn't stop fucking letting him down, huh?
“You can’t- it’s not- that doesn’t even… ‘your mom’ jokes are just tasteless, Stark-“
“Be safe, alright?” Was all Steve said in the end, sighing a little, “you… just look after yourself.”
man. We did everything in our power to get dirt on you, to find something incriminating enough to at least start a case against you, but in the end all we needed was a buff blond bimbo and you sang like a fucking bird.”
“Peggy apologised though, at least,” Steve said softly, taking a small breath. “More than can be said for Bucky. Asshole.”
There was a short silence, and then suddenly three loud claps rang through the air. Steve jumped, looking up for a second, but Tony didn’t seem to be directing them at him. “Everyone- get out. Go find another room- this one is occupied,” he announced, and the couples broke off, looking disgruntled by the interruption. However, they all slinked off after a few seconds, leaving Steve and Tony alone in the vast kitchen.
this game? Does everyone turn into a heartless bitch when they play? No wonder kids are so cruel,” Tony said wildly, as Steve pushed his shoulders again.
He shook his head. It was probably bad to think of strangers like that. Or acquaintances. Or… whatever they were. Serial-Smilers. Something like that.
Tony paused, huffing out a breath of laughter. He turned a little; a hand reaching under his collar and pulling out a small chain. There was what looked to be one half of a crescent moon attached to the end of it- simple, but obviously expensive. Valuable. When his fingers curled around the thing on the end of the chain, they stroked across the surface with such delicacy- love. Steve watched it with curious eyes.
The stars hadn’t changed. That was all the same, at least. It was comforting.
“Whoah whoah,-” Something grabbed his waist and looped around, holding him in place, diagonally tilted across the sidewalk, “you’re really not good with your drink, are you?”
"Hmmf," Steve let his cheek rest in his hand and speared another lettuce leaf. Phone removed, shitty History grade and food that tasted like ass. Yeah, he was in a bad mood, so sue him, "if you piss me off today I'm removing your shins."
He’d have to start packing a suitcase of things he wanted to take to the new house Pops would get. And then he’d be one of
it was his fucking fault, it was all him. But if he raised his voice, Tony would hear him, and if Tony heard him shouting, God only knew how he’d react. Steve didn’t want to find out.
Steve just smiled at him fondly and then leaned forward, kissing the gray strands at his temples. He calmly ignored the strange tightness that suddenly pulled on his chest, just for a second before fading away again. It had been happening intermittently ever since he’d woken back up, but Steve figured it would probably stop soon, and he didn’t want to make anyone (Tony) worry anymore. “Next time I’ll try keep my hands to myself,” he said, “that alright with you, Mr. Stark?”
Steve gritted his teeth, fighting against the pain as he bucked his hips and dislodged Rumlow. He felt a fresh wave of warm blood spill down his side, but ignored it. For now, all that mattered was winning this fight. Stopping Rumlow. Making sure Tony got out.
It’d started out fairly mundane: “What’s the coolest thing you’ve fought?” , “how many lasers can you shoot?”. But then someone asked what to do if they saw something bad happening to someone else, and it only ended up getting deeper and more philosophical from there. Then a girl at the back of the class put her hand up and said, “what happens if someone’s doing something wrong but they’re your best friend? Do you stay friends with them?” and something inside Tony clenched and twisted painfully.
Sam paused, shooting a look at Steve. “Most of them hang out in smaller groups. There are the jock-type ones, but they’re pretty cool. People tend to merge, a lot of the time. You’ll see some of the girls hanging out with the jocks- or all of the jocks and girls going over to one of the popular guy’s houses and having a dodgy house party on the outskirts of town-”
Steve snorted a little, and Tony glared at him, unimpressed. “What, Rogers, you wanna do it?” He snapped, and Steve’s quickly averted gaze and hasty silence was answer enough.
the sort of leverage that he had over Tony, he’d
“Well…” Steve made a face and shrugged, unwrapping his scarf from around his neck as they neared the door, “I’m not worried, per se, I just-“
Tony spluttered, pulling a face as he tried to think of a way to brush that off, except he couldn’t quite make anything roll off his tongue. He’d never thought of it that way.
Unfortunately, though, it seemed nothing was getting through the barrier. At this point, military aid had come through and tanks were rolling up the roads, firing off missiles that just bounced right of the thing. Then, of course, seeing as Iron Man was there too, they started firing shit at him. Never let it be said that the military didn’t utilise their chance to blow up as many targets as they could, regardless whether one of them was pretty much the only thing keeping the robot contained.
Clearly, social services were very much out. What with AIM’s interest and the fact that they were almost certainly monitoring the comings and goings of all children who were taken into care, everyone knew that allowing him to get put into the system would basically be the same as handing him straight over to the terrorists themselves. As Tony had suggested, Xavier was also a good option, but seeing as Peter was currently being hunted down by a rather formidable enemy, bringing him into a school full of young and vulnerable children would be potentially disastrous. AIM were salivating at the mouth over the prospect of one superhuman kid- none of the Avengers wanted to introduce them to a school full of them.
“M’tired,” he said quietly, before looking at Steve with the most helpless expression Steve had ever seen on the other boy, “I’m scared. I don’t… now what? What do I… what—”
“Ah right, I- yeah, no, sorry, go ahead,” Tony stumbled quickly, pushing his hand back into Steve’s and then taking another breath. He started up his conversation with Sam again; letting Steve gently work through the injuries in the same way Tony had done for him the first time around. When he got to Tony’s face, he had to shuffle around a bit; getting up on his haunches in order to clean up the stray patches of blood and fix band-aids over the cuts. Unlike Tony, his first aid kit did not come with ice packs, and the two he’d managed to rig up were currently resting over Tony’s knuckles with strict instructions not to move them when he was talking, so Steve couldn’t do much about the deeper bruises. He decided staring at them in disapproval would have to be enough for the moment.
Bruce checked his watch. “Since the first time you woke, three hours. Since getting back from the HYDRA cell, it’s been about 38.”
But his team were coming. Tony, Bucky, Bruce, Thor, Nat, Clint, Rhodey, Sam… everyone else. Someone else. They’d find him. They always did.
Thanos had won.
I was lonely and all the neighbourhood kids would rather spit at me and call me a freak than play goddamn tag with me. I was lonely and my own parents chose to ignore me, or- y’know- just hit me if I was being annoying enough, so they weren’t exactly up for it either.”
“He’s had a bit too much mead,” Tony leaned forward and whispered to him, before punching Thor in the knee. “Back off, you absolute man-whore.”
, Steve. So if you’re not one of them, which I hope to God you’re not, then please, watch your back. They’re planning something. Something b—”
Tony looked at him blankly for a second. “Coming…what?”
Not that any of that really mattered. Steve just had to focus on not getting stabbed now.
kiss, exactly, because Tony never gave bad kisses- just a slightly… disorganized one. Tony was still slightly out of breath and Steve hadn’t turned right, which sent them both stumbling into the wall, and then Tony went and slipped on the wood-paneled floor, which just sent him half-crashing into Steve’s stomach, only stopped from getting a faceful of floorboard because of Steve’s fast reflexes.
hit Tony.
Steve’s mouth quirked up, and he rolled Tony easily onto his chest. “With pleasure,” he said, pulling Tony down for an easy kiss.
Maybe it was just wired into Human DNA to know when your world was going to change forever.
“Not until later,” Tony waved a hand nonchalantly, “and it was only because he walked in and smelt it. By that time, I was long gone, and I’d wiped any evidence of Pepper being there from the scene of the crime at all, so-“
With a groan, Steve rolled over, debating whether or not to just ignore them and fall back to sleep again. The thought was very tempting- he did not function well in the morning hours, and it took a while to stretch his temper out to acceptable human-interaction levels. Chances were, the person on the other side of the door wasn’t going to be getting a great welcome if he did actually leave his room.
Tony harrumphed, then turned to the clock with a frown. “Why is Thor even up at 5 in the morning?”
“I think the fact that it’s my birthday means I’m allowed to tell you not to suck face on my couch,” Steve said haughtily, hands going to his hips as he glared at her, “now sit down and don’t m-“
Pulling out his own phone and running a hand anxiously through his hair, he pulled up Tony’s contact and began to text out a message, deleting and retyping a few times before eventually coming up with the final piece.
Tony debated it for a moment. “Well, I mean, we’ll probably be too poor to afford
“Steve? Oh, for fuck’s… Steve, you idiot, sit back down. Your bicep’s all torn up, okay, just lie down, lie… there we go.” He blinked in surprise as suddenly a face loomed above him, one warm hand pressing against his chest. Tony’s face was pinched in worry, the bruises around his face having changed a few shades since Steve last looked at him. He wondered how long he’d been out for.
“Gonna have to settle for sharpening your knives and looking a bit more threatening whenever someone looks in my direction, sweetheart,” Tony told him, voice slurred from the exhaustion that was already pulling him back under.
“Jesus, you do realise that if I hadn’t been there, he’d still be freezing out on the streets, right?” Tony asked, “I did you a fucking favour.”
So the fact that Steve hadn’t even taken off the seal off the box? A definite loss.
Sam took one look at his face and lifted an eyebrow. “Tony?”
“They don’t know what I know about him,” she continued, “their tests aren’t doing anything other than hurting him now. But he’s smart—I think there’s got to be some sort of accelerated cognitive capabilities involved here, because he’s coming along leaps and bounds without much help from us at all. He’s strong too… he can break things that babies shouldn’t be able to break. Lift things. Superhuman strength should have been added to his file weeks ago, but if I tell them he’s capable of more, they’re going to do more experiments on him. I don’t want that to happen. Not any more.”
Tony and Bucky looked at each other for a second, before shrugging. “We’re not… enemies,” Tony explained slowly, whilst Bucky nodded.
“Tracked your phone, remember?” Tony smiled at him worriedly, a rain-wet hand pressing lightly into his jaw and tilting his head. His brow creased. “Oh, Steve, what did they do to you?”
A hand landed softly on his shoulder, and Steve jerked his head up to see Thor staring solemnly down at him. “We need to head back down to the hotel and call for help,” he declared, “we cannot get any signal here, and if we leave it too long, we put Tony’s life at risk.”
Tony. He needed…
They broke away after another few seconds, looking at one another with shared smiles and rosy cheeks. Tony traced the side of his face with a finger, thinking of a dozen different futures that had just popped into his head. “You think this is gonna work?” He whispered, nervous as the words fell from his lips.
. I don’t even know what to say; I can’t believe you’ve managed to hide this from everyone, I can’t believe you’d
“You’re looking again,” Tony stated, even though his eyes were buried in the depths of the storage box.
Peter looked at Steve, now with soap suds dripping down his face, and cackled uproariously, fisting his hands and then beating down against the surface of the water. Both Steve and Tony grinned, Steve picking up another handful of bubbles from the bath and blowing it in Tony’s direction. Most of it ended up catching in his hair, damn it. Unfortunately, however, Steve was laughing with that carefree little chuckle of his and so Tony found it rather difficult to scold him for it. Instead, he turned to Peter who was also laughing, and then stuck out his tongue. “Oh, quiet you,” he snapped, smearing a handful of bubbles into the little boy’s face too.
HYDRA. SHIELD. Project Insight.
But that was when it hit him.
Tony- God, Tony beamed at him like he’d just made his morning, and it was… it was so stupid, how he did this to himself- he didn’t want to go and that was obvious- but honestly, Steve just felt glad that at least he was around to give Tony something to look forward to coming back to. He needed that. And Steve wasn’t much, but… well, Tony didn’t seem to mind that.
“Okay, well that
“Then
It wasn’t that Steve didn’t already know Tony was Iron Man—but he felt like if Tony said it, some of his earlier convictions might be solidified. He might not feel so… confused, about the whole situation. Tony had sounded so sincere when he’d said that he was going to be destroying the weapons.
“JARVIS,” Thor said gently, “perhaps this can wait until a later period.”
So Steve shook his head, pulling Tony’s hands from his own face and then clutching his bony fingers around it. “It’s not something I’d hold you to if you did, that’s all,” he hurried to assure, “I just- you know, they were all wearing fur and talking about lobster, and that’s not- it’s not a place I belong, and it’s a different sort of setting, and so I just… I mean I guess you could have warned me, because it was kinda painful to have that happen out of left field, but I mean, at the end of the day I know that I’m not-“
“Where did Rumlow take Iron Man?” Steve cut to the chase sharply, “I’m Agent Rogers. I was tasked with bringing him in.”
_____
So yeah. Tony loved everything about Halloween.
He made an incredulous face, mouthing their names and then raising his eyebrows. No doubt they were skipping class- probably hadn’t even gone to it in the first place, if they’d been hanging around with Ty Bain and all the others since the end of break.
But he knew that there was a time and place for something like that- they still had things to work through before they could get there, and Steve was willing to wait. He was willing to do anything for Tony, really.
Tony was, in fact, stepping back up onto the windowsill, shuffling back under the window and then grabbing onto the ledge with firm fingers. “I’m leaving?” He said, like it was the most obvious thing in the world, but grinned cheekily when Steve shot him an incredulous look.
His head pounded. He wondered whether he’d hit it on the way down.
“Goodnight,” Steve said. He didn’t even turn and look at him as he slammed out of Tony’s house, and the sound reverberating heavily in the corridor where Tony was still stood, staring at the vacated space while his heart thumped in his chest. He took an aborted step forward. Steve said not to follow him. And Tony had already done enough damage tonight.
“You have NO IDEA what kind of blasphemy you are speaking of right now!” Sam bellowed to Natasha, waving his finger in the air furiously. “How could you, traitor? I thought you were
A murmur of agreement flew around the cramped hospital room, and Tony wanted to say something, but he found he couldn’t speak. His throat was tight and his eyes stung, and God, he felt close to a breakdown.
Steve watched him as Rhodey pulled himself off the wall, clapping Steve lightly on the back as he moved past. “Don’t hurt him,” he said, and his tone wasn’t threatening- it was pleading, “he’s crazy about you, Steve. He’s… he’s happier than I think I’ve seen him in a long time. Just… try and be careful, yeah? He’s a lot more vulnerable than he’d ever let anyone believe. And people have hurt him, before. It’s… just be kind. Please. That’s all I can ask.” He smiled, patting Steve on the shoulder again. “But I also will reinforce the fact that we will methodically hunt you down if you hurt him. Just so we’re clear.”
“No.”
Sam’s eyes sharpened a little, but Steve shook his head in placation and waved it off. “It was nothing- he got in my way, I dealt with it. If he holds a grudge, so be it. It doesn’t concern me.”
of it any more, he just didn’t want to deal with it, that was all. He couldn’t afford to argue with Steve just then, when he knew that it was only a single thread that was still connecting Steve to him in the first place. Every time Tony looked at him, it was clear Steve wanted to run, and Tony couldn’t lose him over this. Not now. They’d gotten through the worst part, and now they just needed to stick with it until they came out the other side.
“With all due respect, sir, shut the fuck up,” Steve snapped at him angrily, forgetting where he was and who he was talking to for a second. Beside him, Tony just sighed, and when Steve looked at his headteacher, the man’s single eye looked ready to pop out of his head.
“You’ll die,” she said quietly, “your past self, he’ll live on, but
That didn’t bode well.
Steve waved hurriedly to the janitor’s trolley. “Just get in, Tony, for fuck’s sake—”
“Someone was looking for the kid,” Steve said seriously, and once more, the room fell into silence as everyone processed it. Tony looked over to Steve, paling a little. The words Steve had said earlier resonated back into his head:
And now he scrambling to his feet at lightning speed, sprinting over to Steve’s unresponsive body as it lay on the floor and feeling desperately for a pulse that was no longer there.
He knew it would be another night of sleeplessness, thinking about what had happened that morning.
Tony blinked at him, feeling Steve’s hand move to cup his cheek. He was shaking his head minutely, looking back and forth between him and the laptop. “You made a website,” he said, something disbelieving in his tone, “We fought, and you made some mistakes, and then you decided to create a whole fucking
“Just do your homework or something,” he suggested, whilst Steve scoffed loudly and obviously to his left, “they’ll be done sorting their shit soon- you know Bucky, he can’t hold a grudge for shit.”
“Don’t think mental health days count as ‘slacking’ any more.”
From the bed, Steve cocked his head analytically. “Edible,” he said in the end, and it made Tony laugh.
But Steve never wanted to leave this spot, right here in Tony’s arms. What was the point? He couldn’t think of anything worth leaving for.
It was honestly more than a little adorable.
“I wish I’d been the person you wanted me to be,” he slurred unevenly, fingers grasping at the first thing he could reach. He hoped it was something of Tony’s, although he had the slightest suspicion it may have been his own trouser-leg. “Wish I’d been worthy of you.”
He was just sat on the street, waiting for someone to walk by.
“Tiberius,” Pepper finished for him, eyebrows knitting together a fraction before she purposely relaxed herself and smiled again, “and seeing as he’s pretty much untouchable, we couldn’t exactly threaten him. So please excuse us for perhaps… overcompensating with the shovel-talk with you, but there’s a lot of bad experience there, and we’re not keen on standing by and letting it get repeated.”
Pepper sighed, a nail scraping along her forehead. “Rhodey made that sound a lot more threatening than it was meant to be. I really am sorry about this, by the way- I know you probably think we’re very odd, but… well, I don’t really care about that if it means I can go home with my mind resting easy.” She shook her head a little and raised a hand in question, “look, I’m gonna cut to the chase here. We want to know what your intentions with Tony are.”
“Do you know this guy?” Thor asked Tony, who just looked at him with a confused face, “I found him in the middle of the dancefloor, and he seemed pretty distressed-”
When none of the standing parties made to move either, Steve just sighed and wound his arm around Tony’s, before sinking down to the space of floor he’d left a few minutes ago. Tony resisted for about a second before just following along, ending up sat a little rigidly on the rug, still not looking Steve in the eye.
But he also knew that sometimes, Steve could still feel the sensation of Bucky slipping through his grasp. That Natasha smelt the blood that had once covered her hands, and Bruce could still hear the screams of terror that he’d invoked.
“I bet I’d still find you in under an hour,” Natasha had challenged, raising a daring eyebrow up at him before turning back to the morning paper.
Tony paused. He opened his mouth and then shut it again a second later. "Zeke's an ass," he said in the end, paired with an uncaring shrug, "and it was a while since I got in a fight."
Tony spluttered in a surprised laughter, smacking Steve playfully. “Shut up. When you get rich enough, strange becomes ‘eccentric’, thank you very much.”
talking any more.”
Steve needed to remember to breathe.
Half the universe died. The world fell into chaos.
With a final racketing choke, his face crumbled and he felt the sting of hot tears as they spilled over on to his cheeks. He was emotionally exhausted, he was hurt, and so was Tony. Because of
“You know,” JARVIS said eventually, making Steve jerk out of his own thoughts, “I may be an artificial intelligence, but I do think I actually like you.”
Maybe he should have at least tried to smooth his hair down a bit. Or washed his face.
“Pretty sure my lungs would just give out,” Steve admitted ruefully, “don’t worry yourself Mrs Wilson, I’ll be good as gold.”
Save for later.
“How about you tell my brother that I expect him home tonight, seeing as he hasn’t ben there for nearly six days now and I’m getting tired of eating alone, huh?” He asked, eyes flicking over to the back of the crowd one last time before he turned to face Tony and Steve, hand reaching to pat Steve on the shoulder.
He still couldn’t believe he’d really been kissed. And as first attempts went, Steve liked to think he hadn’t done too badly. Tony had seemed to enjoy it, anyway.
Tony was a mess. His lip was split, and it looked like Thor had cleaned some of the blood away, but a fresher layer had dripped down, following gravity as it slipped in a red rivulet across his chin. His cheek was destroyed, a deep gash running across the bone from what looked like a repeated attack with something that had to have been sharper than a fist. His eye was blackened, swollen up, and there was a cut running across his forehead that was streaking his face with blood.
“Can we reverse it?” He’d asked, pretending as if his voice hadn’t been wavering with each word. “Please tell me I can get it all back, Bruce.”
“Look, I’m not sorry I did it,” Steve interrupted before Tony could try and say anything else, “nothing anyone says is going to make me sorry, either. He deserves everything he got and then some.”
“Is that what happened to him last night?” The man asked him softly. “Is that why you—”
“We glued them to the floor,” Natasha informed him, as she tossed an M&M into the air and then caught it between her teeth.
“You can and you will,” Tony said sharply, pushing him back once more and then standing up jerkily, rushing over to his wardrobe and then throwing out all the contents until he found a decent suit. He looked manic, but his eyes were empty- completely unlike what Steve had been experiencing barely even two minutes beforehand.
Steve told him, kissing his forehead.
In the other room, he could hear Tony arguing with Clint, his voice frantic and angry. He was trying to get out of bed, and Clint wasn’t letting him. “Clint, dammit, he’s out there and he needs me! Tell him to come here or let me go out, but either way, I have to- I have to see him.”
But then Tony just shrugged, taking another large sip. “It doesn’t matter. But you don’t need to worry, Steve. I’ll find whoever it is that’s out for you, and I’ll stop them.”
He could feel his arms start to shake, but he didn’t want to jostle Tony too much. He didn’t know what was happening. This wasn’t real. This wasn’t… a minute had passed since Tony had been telling him he loved him. A minute. He couldn’t be alive and then dead like that. That’s not what happened.
Tony sat up a little. “Hi,” he said weakly, “Steve, I’m... I’m so sorry-”
everything he did was so sporadic and Steve couldn’t find a pattern, a link between any of the causes. Tony was a complete and utter enigma.
He just wished he’d put some makeup on first.
The accords.
“Stop thinking.” Steve pulled him back in and ducked down to kiss him before Tony’s mind could reach any higher, “That’s sweet. Thank you, Tony.”
?” He asked, voice incredulous.
Tony turned onto his side, shutting his eyes and sighing. He was glad that neither Clint nor Natasha were in the room just then, because as teenage boys tend to do, his mind was rapidly descending to filthier places, and having a mind-reading friend watching that process would definitely not be something Tony wanted to experience. Their abilities were cool, but there was a time and a place. He breathed out slowly and then considered calling Steve for a little bit, just to hear his voice. But he felt that might not be enough. Tony wanted him
He was going to get
The room cleared pretty quickly after that.
“It’s
Well, they could stare all they wanted. It was Steve who got to go on a date with him tonight.
“I’m sure Peter will be on his best behaviour,” Thor assured them, but Tony looked at the God over his shoulder and raised an eyebrow.
Tony figured that was going to go about as well as he was currently picturing in his head. That being, a fire-and-brimstone sort of event.
, really. It was kinda transfixing to watch him like that; so alive and so tuned in to everything and nothing at the same time. The logical part of Steve wondered how the hell it was only him and a sparse few other who ever got to see that side of him.
Steve just sighed, and then lifted them both up effortlessly. “I think we’ll do just that, actually.”
Another blow hit a few minutes later as new reports started to surface. Tony still had the CCTV footage in the corner of the HUD, plus the various messages that he was receiving through the SHIELD secure line, and he took it all in with a sinking heart. “Steve, it looks like our enemies are sporting a variety of mid-level enhancements.”
Tony glanced up at it, and then looked back to Steve. The man huffed. “You probably don’t remember,” he murmured, “But you woke up for a bit when we got you on the jet and, uh, told me what you’d been planning.”
Steve sighed, palming his forehead and shaking his head, holding off on a tiny smile. “Is this what it’s always like with you?”
just had an attempt on his life, after all. He needed to act like it.
They stopped at a roadside diner for more food along the way, stocking up on snacks while Tony dressed Steve up in a pair of ridiculously big sunglasses and an obnoxious baseball cap in order to help him blend in. No one noticed them, thankfully- or at least, if they did, they didn’t care enough to comment, and once their pancakes had been scoffed down they were back on the road again, bickering about the quickest way to reach the town where they were supposed to be staying. Steve called Tony names while his hand held onto the other man’s thigh, and Tony swore he regretted ever agreeing to the trip while he rested his fingers over Steve’s knuckles and drew absent patterns against the skin there.
“I don’t care, Tony, seriously,” Steve told him seriously, looking up at him through his eyelashes and noting the way Tony’s own eyes were blown wide, how his cheeks were tinted with pink and his throat working as he swallowed nervously. He genuinely was scared that Steve thought that little of him. It made his heart hurt, just a little bit. “I know who you are. I see you. And I’m not going to change my mind.”
He really wished they’d stayed at home.
It was still hard to watch himself slip into that mode, though.
, the only thing he wanted to do in that moment was pull Tony away and do something stupid like write
No. No no no, not—he couldn’t have.
honestly. It was kinda crazy.”
“Fun!” Peter yelled back. He chose that moment to lift his hands away from the ceiling, and both Tony and Steve yelled and rushed forward to try and catch him until realising that he was still stuck by his feet.
The blond head ducked out of the door before Tony could catch it, but he refused to be deterred. Leaping onto one of the dining tables, he shouted off hurried apologies to the general area beneath him as he ran over the expensive tablecloth and pristine food, before dropping off at the end and then running to the door, the crowds having finally thinned out by that point. “Steve!”
– however, he knew that this Christmas was going to be different.
“Hey,” Tony said softly, cheek pressed into the pillow as he looked up at Steve, “still here, still fine, still love you. Just like I promised.” He brushed a little strand of hair off Steve’s face with his pinkie finger and then smiled as Steve blinked tiredly and rubbed at his eyes with the back of his hand.
“He would heely his way straight into my work and ruin it, Steve, you know he would.” Tony shot the Bot a fond look and then rolled his eyes, turning back around to face his work. He was crouched low, ass stuck out, and Steve found himself cocking his head and watching appreciatively as the man screwed something into place. “You are far too attached to that thing.”
Tony looked up and saw him, his fluffy blond head peeking out over the sofa. He was beaming at Tony as if he were the best thing since sliced bread. “Guys, look!” He said again, bringing his hand down and smacking a shoulder that looked like it could possibly have been Clint’s. It seemed he used enough force that he managed to dislodge Clint from the couch entirely, and Tony watched with a small wince of sympathy as he was sent rolling onto the floor below. Steve, however, seemed not to notice. “Tony’s here guys!”
“It wasn’t like… that,” the boy shook his head and looked down, frowning at a patch of black on the back of his hand, “she didn’t… she didn’t stick around
“Really,” Tony laughed a little, nodding his head again, His ears had turned slightly pink.
“Nope. No you’re really not.”
No. The one he was struggling with was, surprise surprise, Tony.
Alright. Okay. It was just a house. A ridiculously big, expensive house, but still- a house. He could find Tony in it.
, Tony. Without you, we would have fallen to bits a long time ago.” His face twisted in pain and he bit his lip. “Why would you think that we would ever,
Steve needed to ask. But he didn’t think now was the time. Not when Tony was like this.
Steve had to do this with Tony. Because that was what they did. They saved the world- “together, like we should have been the first time.”
“What’s that supposed to mean?”
Well. At the very least, that was what Steve was assuming. According to Thor, Tony hadn’t really talked since arriving, beaten and bloody at Thor’s doorstep. Just given the guy a smile and then collapsed forward into his arms.
“I’ll ask Tony to reimburse you when I find him,” Steve said with a tight smile, rolling his shoulders and holding back a wince. Thor’s eyes narrowed slightly, but Steve turned away and started walking in the direction of where he’d last seen the others heading, before they’d become shrouded in snow and forest. “Go get us some help. Call JARVIS when you can, get him to send a drone down, deep-scan the mountain. We’ll find him.”
“That doesn’t excuse what he did- if what you’re saying is true, then he should have been fucking falling at Tony’s feet for picking me up and helping me out,” Steve argued snappily, clenching his jaw and throwing out a hand.
“You think very loudly, you know,” Tony declared, his tongue poking out and licking off a stray fleck of cream from the corner of his lip.
Steve looked sullen, hitching his bag higher up onto his shoulder defensively. “He’s a fucking bastard,” he muttered, jumping down the steps two at a time.
“I’m gonna be good for you too, you know,” he mumbled sleepily, pressing his lips into Tony’s shoulder, “promise.”
Steve frowned, shifting to look at her. She smiled. “Bucky loved her an awful lot. He still loves
Steve swallowed and turned back around. Not his problem. Not his problem. Not his problem.
Rhodey’s face, however, told Tony that persuading them to leave was going to be difficult. “Nat, I think he’s getting delirious,” he said to the woman next to him, shooting her a look before turning his gaze back to Tony. “You’re delirious.”
“You don’t ever have to be in pain again,” Tony whispered against his mouth, “it’s over, Steve. We won.”
Peter burbled, a sticky hand reaching, as usual, for the light in Tony’s chest. When he couldn't reach, his brow folded and his little podgy fist clenched, flying around in Tony's vicinity, trying to get a hold on any part of him that he could reach. He always wanted to touch, did Peter. Like he'd said; he loved attention, and even though Tony was still apprehensive, it was damn-near impossible to deny the boy that when he was looking at Tony so Goddamn earnestly. It was like he'd taken that puppy-dog gaze straight out of Steve's 'how to wrap a Tony around your little finger' handbook.  Downright embarrassing how fast Tony caved to that, these days.
he was getting redder and redder. Goddamn it, he hated his pale skin sometimes.  "The fact that you try so hard to keep everything under wraps... well, that on its own says quite a lot about you, don't you think?" He said eventually, picking his words with care so that he didn't accidentally offend Tony.
He needed to get out. Sort his fucking nose out, for starters. Then he could call Tony or something.
Those last words were kept to the confines of Steve’s own head, but when he dared to glance up at Tony, he thought he could see the words that were on the tip of his own tongue as well. Looked like it was something along the lines of
Steve couldn’t focus. Couldn’t work, or eat, or sleep.
in his head,
“Thor,” Bruce said soothingly, a hand going to Thor’s shoulder, but the God wasn’t finished. He stood in his fury, tears slipping down his cheeks. He was the only one who seemed to know how to express his emotions. Steve couldn’t even look at him. There was something terrible beginning to lurch in his stomach, a tension forming over each line of his body. He could feel Tony's weight in his arms. The memory of his empty face was inescapable.
The worst part was that this time, he knew that all of them were true
He arrived at Thor’s about an hour and a half earlier than anticipated. Thor was still busy making lunch by the time Steve used the code and let himself in, and he nearly dropped his pan of eggs in surprise when he saw Steve. “Oh my God,” the boy let the pan fall back to the stove with a clatter, “what happened to your face? And why are you back so early?”
“NO!” Everyone yelled again, and Tony laughed, fingers dancing over the smooth gold band that circled his finger.
Tony was fighting a losing battle. He couldn’t undo what he’d done here, and he couldn’t go back either. Peter was going to leave, and whatever Tony tried to do now, it was still going to hurt like hell.
“I know,” Rhodey rolled his eyes, looking a little petulant, but still smiling, “Tony explained it to me. Still think he’s an asshole though.”
, the voice in his head shouted, but he swallowed that down too, shoved it under his ribcage where it couldn’t escape. He was looking at a fanatic, a murderer. He was looking at a man who’d killed and stolen and burned buildings to the ground for his own agendas.
“Sounds like fun,” Steve said drily, poking Sam’s foot when it got too close to his face, “hey- can I invite some of my friends over here? Just two. But I want you guys to meet, and they’re both free today, so-“
Steve caught his arm.
Steve loved him. For all his broken parts, apparently. That was nice. Better than nice, actually.
Tony pulled a face, pushing down about seven different instincts in order to lean forward and wipe at Peter’s mouth. “Disgusting creature,” he informed the baby, shaking his head and sighing. “I should have stuck to my guns and not let Steve win. Would have saved me a lot of pain.”
Tony pursed his lips and began walking again. Steve followed, but then stopped when he got something thrown in his face. Hands coming up instinctively, he grabbed hold of the thing that had been chucked over him and frowned. “Why did you just throw your jacket at me?”
,” he groused, but he raised his hand and pressed it over Steve’s as he said it and then turned into him so that they were chest to chest. When he leaned up to kiss Steve, his mouth tasted like toothpaste. “Go back to bed,” his voice vibrated against Steve’s mouth, soft and low, and when Steve pulled back Tony was staring up at him with stars in his eyes and a smile dancing over his face. He was so goddamn perfect.
Steve made sure to remain very, very still. One twitch of his hand would end with it going through the table. His body was not his own. It had torn itself away from him, and he struggled to keep control. “Explain,” he ordered.
A small pause, and then, “hey Steve. Are you alright, buddy? You sound a bit funny.”
The fact that he had this, and had it with one of the best people in the whole world, was something Tony didn’t think he would ever stop being grateful for. Talk about lucky.
When Tony nodded, Steve took the pen. He sketched a little symmetrical design on the back of Tony’s palm, beginning in the middle and expanding outward. Tony just watched him work, cheek pressed delicately to the pillow. He always seemed so fascinated by Steve’s art—Steve didn’t understand why exactly, but right now, he was just about ready to pander to any of his boyfriend’s whims, so it was hardly a chore for him to do this.
“Would you like to find out?”
“Hey, baby, you know I love you, but I gotta ask- what the goddamn fuck.”
. “Steve, please don’t start doing that. Don’t be like… Please. It’s not… it’s not what it’s cut out to be, I swear. Please- please don’t.”
“You asked me to alert you when your father was five minutes from arrival,” JARVIS told him, sounding prim, and despite the fact that it seemed he’d just been cockblocked by a fucking AI, Steve couldn’t help but marvel at the way Tony had managed to get authentic inflections in the robot’s voice. It sounded almost human. A fucking annoying human, sure, but still.
Steve paused, feeling Sam’s own offer fall into a very similar category to his Dad’s the previous evening. The whole family had done far too much for him already. Steve wasn’t going to bother them with more.
“Definitely.”
Steve hummed, seemingly satisfied with the answer. He scuffed his foot back and forth along the bath-mat absently while Tony got himself sorted, occasionally sparing quick glances his way with a small smile on his face. Tony knew what he was thinking, and it made him roll his eyes fondly. “Really that desperate?” He asked. “I’m shaving, Steve, it’s hardly pornographic.”
That boy- that stubborn mess of a boy- was kissing Steve softly, smile still lingering around his mouth and damp hair from a speedy shower still tickling Steve’s cheek. It was hard to believe, really. Even harder to think that it was
Steve blinked, before turning around and looking toward the back of his room. He promptly choked on his own tongue and yelled in surprise when he saw-
“Whoah, slow down, Soldier,” Tony said with a laugh, taking Steve’s wrists and gently pausing their descent down the buttons of his shirt, “I don’t think our friends would like it if we got naked in front of them.”
Unfortunately, no matter how freakily good tony may have been with kids, that talent didn’t quite extend to Steve. Peter
There was no way he could deny the smug look Ty sent his way at the words. Instantly, Steve felt his temper rise and jaw clench, and he made a move to step forward and ask just what the fuck Ty meant by that- but then Thor was pressing down firmly on his shoulder in warning, and when he glanced his way, the boy was shaking his head minutely, face solemn. Steve remembered his words from a few weeks ago- ‘
With the increasing feeling he was walking into a trap, Tony nodded and then headed downward, arms raised in repulsor-firing position in case of… well, he wasn’t sure. Apparently there was only one thing alive in this place, and he hoped to God it was Steve. He kicked down the door to the stairwell, noting complete darkness envelop him as he did so. The lights must have shorted in the lower levels. JARVIS didn’t even need to be asked before switching on the flashlights fitted into the suit, and Tony blinked as the lighting changed. Then, once his eyes had had the chance to adjust, he saw what lay ahead of him and felt his mouth drop open in horror, letting out a violent curse.
“Oh good,” Tony said from the other side of the room, sitting up as he held a small green bag in his left hand, “nice to know you’ll live to see another day, Rogers.”
Steve poked sullenly at the shitty salad in front of him and then tugged Clint's hat off his head when he sat down, just because.
-mistake you made during our time together was handing me in at the end of it all. So well done. You’ve got a success rate of about 1 in 1000.”  Tony was just sneering at him now, that typical Tony Stark Bluntness that could cut a man down from a mile away- except his eyes told the real story. They always had. Every fight they’d ever fought, every time Tony had tried to bullshit Steve with feigned nonchalance, it had never worked. Not then and not now either.
Back in the bedroom, Steve’s morning alarm went off. It was five in the morning. Yesterday, Steve had been going on a run right about now, Tony grumbling about the early hour in the same way he did every single day.
Wheezing in audible terror, Steve gauged how far away Tony was. “Oh god, okay- Tony! Tony, sweetheart, just hold on, okay, hold on, I’ve got you, I won’t let you fall, I won’t, I swear-”
They avoided each other in the day and screamed at each other in the night when they thought he was asleep. Pops had been sleeping in the spare room for at least six of the seven nights it had been going on for. Dinner time had become a nightmare; Uncle Clint having to swap seats so he was sat in between them and prevent another fight from springing up while they ate.
“Tony?” He blinked and turned back to Steve, who was now looking slightly wary. Tony realised it had been a few seconds since he’d said a word. “If… if this isn’t the right time, or you’re not… I mean that’s fine too—”
“Oh for fuck’s sake, Steve, can you do something other than say sorry when we’re fighting?” Tony hissed at him, walking forward on his crutch and glaring, furious about more than just the fact Steve had done what he did that day- but about everything. About how Steve just let Tony fucking walk all over him, how he avoided Tony’s space whenever he could, how he felt like he couldn’t even come into Tony’s workshop to say goodbye any more. “Shout, scream back, do
He didn’t know why he cared that much. Maybe it was the fact that Steve couldn’t quite look at the Tony he was seeing up ahead of him and correlate it to the one who’d eaten ice cream with him the day before. But whatever the reason, it was enough to make him keep his distance.
Steve looked at him hopefully. “Blowjobs?”
He watched Tony pass the mirror as they were on their way out, and then touch one of the marks on his neck again. When he frowned at it, Steve almost opened his mouth to ask if they were okay- but Tony got there first.
Steve howled, then- marching forward, not knowing what he was going to do but knowing that Bucky had just managed to hit on every frayed edge, every torn up part of him, and now all that anger had to go somewhere.
He was sick of every part of his life being controlled by someone else. Since the day he was goddamn born- ‘take this medicine, Steve’, ‘don’t leave the house, Steve’, ‘that’s not safe for you, Steve’. He’d been ill and he’d lost his freedom for the sake of surviving, but he was
“I’m saying The Murderer is luring me down to the basement whilst
Steve raised his eyebrows before leaning in again, his smile pushing into Tony’s mouth. Tony surged up to meet him enthusiastically, and Steve felt… he felt fucking high off it. Tony was
His phone buzzed in his jacket pocket, and Steve bent over, pulling it from the floor.
“God, that’s gross,” Steve made a face and glanced over to the hideously designed pillow-cases while Tony tugged him back and then pulled him onto the bed, landing him right on top of Tony. “You’ve just turned me right off, I don’t want to have sex with you any more.”
“Yes,” Steve answered.
He was never going to be able to look Tony Stark in the eye ever again.
Steve raised his own left hand, looking at it in awe. “Oh my God,
“What?” Steve asked, exasperated.
“Quick learner, then,” Steve shot him a wry expression, “takes it from his—well, uh— his temporary guardian, I guess.”
Steve laughed, tilting his head down and then kissing Tony’s cheek. “Reminds me of someone,” he said in amusement, and Tony made an offended noise in the back of his throat.
God, he was adorable like that. Ridiculous, covered in paint, and adorable. Steve just smiled, because he couldn’t help himself, and then leaned up to kiss a clean section of Tony’s cheek. “No shit,” he said softly, taking Tony’s hand and leading him over to the desk where he’d clocked some baby wipes. “Come here- I’m gonna wipe off as much as I can, but seeing as your bedsheets look pretty fucked anyway, I don’t think it’s ultimately going to matter much.” He paused, before adding, “this is mostly just for me. I don’t want to be cuddled by someone who’s covered in paint. Not a good look.”
Steve, being the every-observant boyfriend he was, noticed the little tick, and immediately rolled Tony back on to his back, grimacing. “Sorry- is it bad today?” he asked softly, his body hovering above Tony’s, but not putting any pressure down against his chest.
“—works, yes, I know. But it will be a world where Tony’s still there, and I’m still with him.” Steve swallowed. Suddenly his voice was weak. “I have a chance to take all this back. Nothing in this universe will stop me from using it.”
Their lives are stressful as fuck. It’s exhausting. But at the end of the day, they get to come home and watch the shitty movie. They get to listen to the quiet pattering of rain against the window or the gentle sound of the other’s heartbeat, tangle their fingers together and maybe just sleep. It’s more than a lot of people could hope for.
“No, I shouldn’t think so.”
a lip bite, and Steve’s eyes keep flickering down toward Tony’s exposed collarbone like there’s a god damn magnet attached to the thing-
“Just… just smile. I really need to see you smile right now,” Steve told him, his voice horribly fragile in the quiet room.
Steve stayed. With Tony Stark, of all people. Director Fury sure had been surprised when Steve had informed him that he would no longer be requiring his SHIELD barracks, because he was living with the same guy he’d been spitting at not only a few weeks ago.
Tony’s hands ran through his hair a few more times (and Steve knew him- knew he was checking, because the battle had been hard and Steve was pretty beaten up after being thrown through that wall), before he pulled away a little and let his knees buckle; falling into Steve’s lap fluidly. Steve watched fondly as he wiggled his butt and got comfortable between Steve’s legs, lying back against his chest as he looked upward. “Really is something, isn’t it?”
Steve hummed happily. And then a second later, his head slumped and his eyes closed, a small snore escaping his mouth as he fell immediately asleep, his face smushed up against Tony’s left buttcheek.
He shuddered violently, leaning a hand against the wall and ducking his head. He needed to throw up- had done for days now, but he hadn’t eaten enough for anything to come up, leaving nothing more than a horrible taste in the back of his throat and a sickening lurching in his stomach.
Steve glanced over to him, shaking his head fondly as he rounded the corner which led to the stairwell. “You know, I’m pretty sure that would be a big job for anyone else.”
Goddamn it, he just needed to get his head working properly again. Once the memories came back, he didn’t even have to worry about whatever it was that his stupid mind had decided to latch onto. Maybe he just needed to rip the bandaid off. Work through the Cognitive block and try force his way through the pain until he reached the other end.
There was another short pause- one that sounded almost hesitant, if disembodied voices were capable of that. “Please be careful around Howard Stark. You’re probably not aware of quite how much influence that man has. There is not a lot he is unable to get away with, and Sir has often faced the full effects of that. He is putting an awful lot of trust into you, simply letting you in here. I implore you not to let him down.”
“If HYDRA find us here, we are all dead,” Tony snapped, “If you can get down back to civilisation and call for help before they arrive, then everyone might come out of this alive.”
Now, though, the sound of gunfire rang like a gong in his ears, pulling him out of his single-minded trance and spurring him into action. Fear lurched in his gut as he realised Clint had been right: HYDRA had come back for round two, and this time, the stranded Avengers were sitting ducks.
Steve made his peace with the floor, and was unconscious before his cheek had even touched the ground.
Natasha glared at him. “I don’t care whether you had it or not,” she snapped, even though he heard Clint mutter ‘you damn well did not’ under his breath, “I didn’t do it for you. I did it for me. Because they were owed a punch in the mouth.”
“I only ever wanted him to be proud of me,” he whispered, voice barely even audible. He didn’t look at Steve. “All my life. Tried… so hard. Jus’ to get him t’smile at me. But I was never enough. An’ now I’m outta chances.”
He felt like someone was punching him. Tony shut his eyes. “It is when we have to watch it all get taken away from us,” he responded gently, with a shake of his head. “If we—if we love him this much already, and we’re getting so carried away after such a relatively short amount of time… God, Steve, this is going to kill us if we lose ourselves any further in this. We have to start setting some boundaries. Now. We have to distance ourselves.”
“I think I’m gonna pass, actually,” Tony backed up, his legs hitting the desk, but Steve followed, unwilling to back down.
Like Tony had said. It’d been a long year.
He guessed he’d probably earned that. He’d barely spoken to them all week, after all. But hey- he was trying today, wasn’t he? That had to count for something. So maybe he did still feel like shit- but it was probably easier to feel like shit around his friends than it was to do it on his own and be subjected to his own self-destructive thoughts all day.
He huffed a little, head leaning back against the cushions of the couch. “God, I don’t know. I’d been doing okay in the beginning- I hadn’t used to go to this highschool, y’know. Went to a fancy place for ‘gifted kids’ and everything. I got into MIT by the time I was fourteen, did you know that? That’s where I met Rhodey, actually.”
“Exactly!” Tony clicked a finger toward him, and then stepped forward to meet Steve, taking a gentle hold of his wrist again. “Come on, Steve Rogers- live a little,” he whispered.
“No no, it’s fine,” Tony told him reassuringly, looking down and pulling his face into his best rendition of a smile, “but don’t worry. I’ll get Iron Man back to me soon and then it won’t even be an issue. Promise.”
“Oh, what is it?” Bruce asked, leaning forward and looking up at him.
On a completely irrelevant note, he bet that if he kissed Tony now, he’d probably taste faintly like the strawberries Steve had seen him eating for lunch.
Gingerly, Tony brushed a hand over his black eye. Then he pouted. “Will you still love me when I’m no longer young and beautiful?”
Steve looked at him for a moment, and when Thor caught his eye they both gave one another a tired smile. “Rough day, huh?” Steve asked, glancing up to the dark sky.
“You have no idea,”
The whole of his left side was a mess. His eye swollen shut, butterfly stitches spanning from jaw to temple. His nose was puffy, looked like it had been broken, and his bottom lip was painfully split open. Wherever Steve looked, there was an injury. Whatever oxygen he’d been managing to take in got stuck in his throat as he stared at Tony, gobsmacked.
“Steve?” Tony asked sleepily, as his brain finally kicked into gear.
things had been sent across their secure line in times when either of them had been away for whatever reason. Tony chewed his lip as he thought. “Send all dirty pictures via first-class airmail,” he landed on in the end with a nod of finality.
He didn’t watch Steve shut his eyes and choke back on a sob, whispering the same words, over and over again.
- JARVIS, call an ambulance right now!”

Tony kicked out the brake and then yanked his own helmet off, turning to Steve with a wild smile on his face. “Where does it look like, Steve? We’re at an abandoned mansion.”
“Or we could just stay here, it’s fine, my stomach is a liar and I think-“
was left unsaid, but Tony understood it anyway. This was dangerous territory that he and Steve were stepping on now. Old memories and all.
“Oh, I understand plenty,” Cass told him with a sickly smile, and Tony was going to throw up, his heart was going to stop, Steve was holding onto his arm so he wouldn’t step forward and get obliterated by the energy field but Tony was pushing against him blindly, unable to just stand there and do nothing as the team of mercenaries slowly backed off, sealing their fate without a second thought. “I understand that at the end of this, we’re all gonna be 40-thousand dollars richer, and you’re gonna be pretty fucking embarrassed. That’s good enough for me.”
The other LMD- John-
interesting.”
Tony’s voice, undeniably afraid,
before everything had turned to shit—was behind all that.
It had occurred to him, in that moment, quick but entirely consuming- what Bucky had been saying earlier, and what Steve had always worried about:
was particularly unusual any more.
“—we end up not being able to move past everything that happened— but I promise, okay, I’m better now. I’m not the man I was when I left, and every moment since the day you walked out I just wished I could have taken it back, tried harder, done—”
“You now regularly call him ‘My Star-Spangled Husband’ in your mission reports. Fury had to burn at least five different copies last week alone. Which mean this is now affecting the environment, not to mention the sensitivities of all SHIELD agents that have to go through them,” Coulson stepped forward gravely.
Mild Warning I guess for underage sex, depending on what State you're in? Idk Tony is 17 and Steve's 16, take it as u will and enjoy!
When he wanders in the room and sees what’s going on, he stops dead.
Mind control. It hadn’t felt like mind control. He’d… he’d wanted to. Hurt Tony.
Tony said nothing. Just watched the city skyline, face illuminated by the last vestiges of light. His fingers found Steve’s and he wrapped them up tightly together. Steve noted that his pulse was beating hard, throbbing like a wound.
“Well then, I guess finding out I’m now a Private Investigator that just got caught up in a government conspiracy big enough to rock the foundations of the USA forever is gonna be easy for you to digest then?”
But they’d learned, they’d grown. Not again. Tony wasn’t going to be manipulated this time round.
Thor sighed deeply and then joined Tony in leaning on the table despairingly. “Because when those two go off, they undoubtedly end up dragging everyone else along with them. More so in my case, because he’s my fucking brother,” Thor muttered, “but not this time. I refuse to get evil-eyed by Bain for the next three weeks. I’m staying out of it.”
Yeah. Tony knew. He clenched his jaw and slammed the coffee cup down a little too sharply. The noise resonated. “Yeah, we’re the parents, we’re the ‘mom and dad’, we’re the fucking big happy family now, aren’t we?” He muttered viciously, pouring out a healthy dose of coffee into the mug and then pulling open the fridge with a sharp tug. “Well we’re gonna need to cut that shit out. Peter can’t get overly attached to us, and we shouldn’t be getting overly attached to him either. And we’re not his fucking parents anyway. We all said—we said we’d look after him together—”
Steve still didn’t understand. Tony couldn’t…. he wasn’t serious, surely. Not after everything. Not after this. How could he be? But Tony, apparently sensing his lack of comprehension, just swallowed and then held Steve’s hand even tighter, looking somewhat nervous now. “I’ve been planning it for weeks,” he said quickly, “trying to get everything perfect, trying to do it right. I know this is—it’s out of the blue, definitely not what I had in mind, but Steve… God, Steve, I love you so much. Of
“I thought I’d lost you,” Steve whispered, eyes shutting in horror once more. “I thought I’d let you fall-”
Peter shrugged, wishing it didn’t feel as tense as it did. Why the hell did parents have to argue anyway? It was stupid. T
That was what Steve had heard, anyway. From the agents who’d dragged his beaten body off the streets and into the holding cell. Steve hadn’t seen it for himself. Far too cowardly for that.
Well- Tony hadn’t seemed to mind it so far, right?
He put the tray on Bucky’s chest and then stole the bag of cookies from it before his best friend could wrap his greedy hands from it. Bucky just whined and shot him the middle finger, which Steve maturely decided to ignore. He made himself comfortable next to Tony, and then grabbed the blanket from the side of the couch, wrapping them both up in it and pulling Tony sideways into his chest.
Steve’s eyes bulged. “Am I okay?” He hissed, “Tony, you just… why the hell did you do that to yourself? Are you crazy?” His voice was wheezy and he tried to sit up indignantly but didn’t quite manage to find the strength, and a second later he too crumbled back to the floor with a grunt.
Tony gasped. “He snitched!”
Tony’s eyes went huge, and his breath stuttered to a complete halt halfway through his drag. With a focused intensity, Steve raised a hand and plucked the cigarette out of his mouth slowly, then placed his other hand against Tony’s jaw, tilting his head upward.
Steve pulled a slightly disgusted face. “Admittedly, it was unlucky that this all had to happen on the same day. But at least now you’re all warmed up for th—”
When Steve starts closing himself off- Tony knows it’s because they’re coming up to the day Bucky died. When Clint gets drunk on a monday morning, he cross-references it with all the other times he’s noticed it happen and realises that each time, it was because he’d been made to spend the whole day at SHIELD with a task-force who still blame him for his mind control.
But he was here now, and Bucky’s car was swerving around the corner. Steve couldn’t exactly go back in now.
Prompt #37 - 'welcome to fatherhood'
“Stay away from him, Stark, do you hear me?” Bucky snarled, and Tony got to his feet in bewilderment, brushing the dirt off his jeans and then staring at the two of them incredulously. “Stay away from Steve. I’m not gonna tell you again.”
. “You were in a medically induced coma for the first one, so we put it on hold until you woke up. I’m glad to see you conscious, by the way. I’ll probably have a panic over everything that happened sometime later today, but for now… Christmas!” He paused, and then plucked one of the chairs from Clint’s hands, settling it on the right-hand side of Tony’s cot. The hospital bed was low and the table high, so it actually fit pretty perfectly, and with Tony sat up straight, it was almost as if he were sat at any other meal.
Sam didn’t even bother to answer that- just cackled and then slapped Steve’s shoulder again. He heard a snapping sound across the table a moment later, and figured that was another of Clint’s catapults that had just been crushed by Natasha’s fingers, which also meant he was about to be subjected to another fight between those two. Wisely, he chose to zone out- letting his eyes shut against his arms as his friends’ voices steadily rose across the table.
“It doesn’t have to be… Tony, I love you more than anything in the world, you know I do,” Steve choked, stepping forward, unable to help himself, “but we need a break. We need… time, space,
“You come here whenever there’s even a chance that your dad’s gonna- gonna do something, okay?” He whispered before Tony could finish, feeling his heart speed up a few paces as he thought about what kind of mess Tony lived in- a house so empty and quiet he’d created another voice out of ones and zeroes just so he could drown out the feeling of being so desperately alone, a father who threw glass at him, good
“-Because you needed help?”
Thor considered it for a moment. “I’ll wear some sunglasses. And a hoodie. No one will ever suspect it’s me.”
“Okay, so now we have that argument settled,” Tony said five minutes later, flopping down over Steve’s body and then crossing his arms over Steve’s chest, “I’m gonna have to remind you that Barnes and Peggy are ‘round at your place as we speak, waiting for your arrival. I don’t want them to storm my house with pitchforks and torches, so I’m afraid you are actually getting kicked out.”
“He’s good to you,” he said, “and I think he’s good
It was scary. New, and kind of… stupidly huge. Steve had never been in love before. Not in the way he loved Tony. He’d loved his mom, and he loved Bucky and Peggy- but that was softer. It was a constant undercurrent, always there, gentle and affirming. This- loving Tony, it was like his heart was on fire. Like a thousand things were exploding at once, and every single spark was sent directly to his spine. It was madness, really. He couldn’t concentrate, he couldn’t even think whenever Tony was in a room. Touching him was like being hit with a thousand volts of electricity, but in the best sort of way. Steve was addicted to the feeling. Steve just… wanted nothing more than to have him. All of him.
Tony looked at him from across the room. Thor, unfazed, wandered further into the medbay, eventually reaching Tony’s bedside. He placed the turkey carefully on top of the stand which held all their medical supplies. “I must be on a hell of a lot of morphine right now,” Tony said, eyeing both Thor and the cooked bird with suspicion.
Tony laughed, and honestly, Steve’s own stupid giggles were mostly just involuntary at that point. A reflex action in response to Tony’s own. “If it helps, Thor’s about to grace us with his… large presence in about three minutes, so you might be able to siphon a little bit of energy from him.” Tony scrunched up the napkin and then threw it back, landing it perfectly over Steve’s face.
Tony mulled over his words for a moment before he nodded. When he glanced down at Steve, there was a fond look in his eyes. "The picture I have of her in my head is very flattering," he said fingers twirling one of the rolls of paper around and around in his hand, "I bet she was great. I mean- You're her son- she must've been doing something right. I could imagine she was quite something."
“You think he still loved you?” Rumlow whispered, “you really fucking thought he’d just show up one night, suddenly wanting you back? How pathetic can someone be, huh? You were his
very early.”
“It’d be selfish if I wasn’t as invested as you were,” Steve told him firmly, “it’d be selfish if you were making me stay, making me help you for your own gain. You’re not. I’m choosing this. I’m choosing to love you, to be with you, flaws and all.” He smiled wryly, knocking their shoulders together, “and hey- it’s not as if I’m without my fair share of issues, right? I’m sure the time will come when I fuck something up big-time, and you’re gonna have to be around to pick up the pieces. Just ask Bucky. He’s got a hell of a lotta stories to tell you.”
, when he’s in the middle of creating something amazing in the workshop. Paint smears across Steve’s cheekbone, like smudges of rainbow illuminating his face, and the white shirt he’s wearing has suffered much the same fate. Tony can no longer see a single dash of pale skin on Steve’s hands; instead covered in reds and oranges and golds that are catching on the sunlight filling the room.
Steve pulled away, just a fraction, and looked up at him. His eyelashes were stuck together with sleep, his hair still tangled and messy. He sighed, expression tainted with a tang of concern. But he didn’t push. “If you’re sure. Just call me at lunch-break, okay?”
It was the only thing he could think of that would possibly help. And it was ridiculous, really, to visit the place where nothing more than the shell of what had been his mom now rested in the hope finding some peace, but he wanted to try.
“Hey, should we invite Jane?” Steve hurried to change the subject, pulling out the first thing he could think of from the top of his head, “I mean, Thor’s coming, and according to Bruce they’ve totally been pining after one another.”
. Steve would rather die than hurt him. He wouldn’t be prepared for HYDRA like Bucky was, he wouldn’t know that it was Steve who was the threat, not until it was far too late.
“And vomited in your shoes.”
“Shut up, punk,” Steve bumped their shoulders together, feeling himself start to blush, “if you can wax poetic about Natasha, I get to talk about mine, okay?”
hugeass
Tony turned to Steve, who just blushed and then shrugged. “I wanted to make sure,” he mumbled, “and anyway, I went and got the table for us!”
ALSO WHOOOOOO, THIS IS OFFICIALLY MY LONGEST FIC EVER AND I'M NOT EVEN SURE IF WE ARE HALFWAY THROUGH YET! Damn. This is crazy- and I just want to say a massive, huge, warm thank you to everyone who's kudo'ed, commented or otherwise supported me throughout this! I'm overwhelmed and amazed at the response this has had, and I just want to say you're all amazing and I'm grateful for every last one of you! Thank you AND I HOPE YOU ENJOY THIS CHAPTER!
Tony laughed. “Yeah, me too.”
They were all laughing at him.
Tony was still glaring grimly at Bucky. “I don’t actually feel in the mood to listen to you verbally piss all over your territory, thanks-“
“Hate to break it to you, sweetheart, but I do.”
Steve paused. “Uh,” he began, “I, uh… went to see mom. For a bit.”
“I’m sorry,” Steve whispered, unable to stop himself, “I know it wasn’t real, I know, but it felt like it was. I felt like I was… doing that. And I’m so sorry. I’m so so-”
Clint just rolled his eyes. “We’re all old, Tony. Even Cap’s getting grey hairs. Deal with it.”
“Would you really want that?” Tony murmured.
Steve rolled his eyes and gave Tony a gentle shove “Hey, let me have this, alright? Bucky stopped over this morning with a new car he bought so that he could drive up and see me more often. Except the car doesn’t actually work all that well. Pretty sure he and Natasha just pulled it off a scrap-heap.”
