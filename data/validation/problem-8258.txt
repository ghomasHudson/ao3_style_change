“I like your thinking. Plus I heard that newly engaged sex is awesome.”
Hey there everyone! I hope y’all are ready for a new chapter! It’s time for Tony to face the public for the first time in months. So, who’s ready? Read on to find out what happens and enjoy. -Shadows
The team was down to only one bot left when Tony located and made his way to the bomb. It was in a new apartment complex that was still under construction. It was hidden in the basement and Tony was quick to make his way down there to start disarming the bomb.
“Wanna tell me anything about Tony?” asked Sam.
He loved him so much, and every last second had been worth it.
Steve never did end up getting Tony his snack because not much later after their little conversation Tony was out like a light. He’d been through a lot; he deserved some rest.
Tony drifted off to the sound of yelling and feet running closer. He felt warm. So, so warm. Tony liked the warmth.
“You shouldn’t be fucking at board meeting Tony. What would Pepper think?” joked Steve as he brought the drinks over to the couch.
But, once tony laid his eyes on it he quickly realized that there was a problem.
“Yeah… yeah, we do.”
Tony was crying again and so was Steve. Steve just held Tony and prayed that he would be able to fix this.
“I’m… I’m working on making Bruce new stretchy… stretchy pants…” huffed Tony as he started to go into shock.
It was around the three-month mark when Tony and Steve told everyone about the baby. Tony had been going to appointments to make sure that everything was alright, and once they knew it was safe to do so, Steve told everyone. Well, everyone bar for Rhodey, Pepper, and Happy. Tony told them himself. They were all excited about the baby and it took everything Tony had to plaster on a smile and enjoy the excitement. Or at least pretend to.
signed Tony as tears rolled down his cheek and he began openly sobbing.
People didn’t want to be around the real Tony Stark. All he was good for was money and tech. Why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free?
Tony didn’t really pay attention to Pepper’s little introduction. He was too nervous and stuck in his head. It was only because of Steve that Tony didn’t miss his cue to go through the door and up onto the platform.
Natasha and Bucky were the first to arrive there in medical after the debrief. Rhodey would have been first but he was updating Happy and Pepper so that they could get to the compound as fast as possible. When the two arrived in medical Bucky was quick to get to Steve’s side and sit down with him. He slung his arm over Steve’s shoulders and just stayed there to let Steve know that he wasn’t alone.
“I can’t wait till I can make love to you again. Can’t wait to show you how much you mean to me. You’re my everything, Tony. I love you so fucking much.” Cooed Steve as he resumed his kissing.
Tony was a right mess when it came to his surgery. He had a lot of problems with being put under because of Afghanistan. Steve was really the only one able to calm him down enough for the doctors and nurses could do their job.
“You ready for me baby?” husked Steve as he hovered over Tony. All Tony did was spread his legs wide and send a sultry look Steve’s way.
“Such a pretty little thing. Fuck! How did I get so lucky?” sighed Steve. Tony just sent him another wink in response. It was a little frustrating not being able to talk and tell Steve everything he wanted to but Tony made it work. He’d just have to show Steve what he made him feel.
“I have a nuke incoming. And I know just where to put it.”
Tony eventually fell back asleep to Steve holding his hand and telling him how everyone else was doing. It was nice to know that everyone else was ok. The next day, the others were allowed to visit Tony in small groups. Happy, Rhodey, and Pepper got to go first. They’d been really worried about Tony and were relieved to see him awake. The visits were short because Tony was still exhausted and he needed his rest. The doctors and nurses were in and out the entire day. Tony was quite annoyed that he had to deal with having a feeding tube down his nose until his throat healed. He understood why, but it was not helping his pain and discomfort.
Tony lived of course. He lived and invited the Avengers to stay at the tower. That had been the breaking point in his and Pepper’s relationship.
“Well, I can’t stay here. I’ve got work to do. No doubt the suit is blown to shreds and all of your guys’ gear needs work. Plus I’ve got that huge project I have to get done for Pepper. Fuck, she’s going to kill me once she gets here. No doubt she’ll yell.” Rambled Tony and Steve just sat there in worry. He already knew that Tony was overworked, but his planning to push aside his own health because of all the work he had to do was going too far.
They already knew that they wanted to have the wedding at the compound. Not only was the location secure, but it was set up to host functions. So, with that in mind, it was a huge hassle trying to figure out decorations.
Tony awoke three days later to the irritating sound of a heart monitor. It took a little bit for Tony to finally manage to blink his eyes open, but when he finally did he was met with Steve holding his hand tightly while tears pooled in his own eyes.
“Please Sweet Heart. Please. I want to help you but I can’t if you don’t tell me what’s wrong.
It was Steve who moved in closer and gave Tony’s knuckles a kiss like the 1940s gentleman he was. Tony blushed like a maniac and that made Steve smile. Maybe, just maybe, they’d be alright.
The flight was a few hours long but once they landed, the two newlyweds practically sprinted from the jet and up to the house. It was dark out when they arrived but then knew the way up to the house. When they arrived, Tony quickly unlocked the front door and turned on some lights. Some of the others had been there a week prior to make sure everything was ready. Tony and Steve were very grateful for that. It allowed them to get right down to business without having to worry about anything.
Three days after Tony woke up, he was struck down with a horrible infection. His injured eye had begun to swell and cause Tony extreme pain and discomfort as the infection spread around his face. It broke Steve’s heart to see Tony laying there in pain. He couldn’t do anything to help but hold Tony’s hand and whisper encouragement.
Maybe now was the time for some serious action.
Not too long after, Tony gave one final push and baby Harley was born wet and screaming. Tony felt his vision blackout as there was a flurry of shouting around him. Steve was screaming his name and Harley was crying.
“Tony, you’re attached to an IV and injured. You’re staying here.”
“He was in the top right wing of the building.” Shouted Bruce from his spot on the jet. He was already getting medical supplies ready to take with him over to where Tony was.
“They’re calling you a hero because you are one you dumb ass.” Chided Rhodey with a smile when that particular news report came up. “They were too stupid to see it before.”
century for years at this point, he still didn’t understand the finer points of internet culture. So, posting multiple shirtless pictures that showed off his tattoos and his muscles certainly had the internet in a tizzy.
“What do you mean by that Tony. Of course, you can say your vows.” Spoke Pepper with a frown.
Tony had periods of wakefulness followed by long periods of rest. The extent of Tony’s injuries mixed with the medication he was on just left Tony utterly exhausted. So, he spent his time sleeping. When he was awake Steve was at his side just talking to him. He kept Tony grounded. He didn’t know how he’d be dealing with all of this if Steve wasn’t at his side.
“Do you really want the poor kid to be saddled with the Stark name? You really should go with just your last name,” spoke Tony as he worked harder than ever to keep his voice from wavering.
pondered Tony as he and Steve laid together in bed.
You see, they were going to go undercover in a popular gay bar nearby. Now, Steve had nothing against gay bars. He himself was bi and in a very happy relationship with Tony. No, the problem Steve had were the rolls they’d been given. Steve was supposed to act as a bouncer so he could see any fake IDs and aliases that the HYDRA agents were using, and Tony? Well, he was going to be a pole dancer. When Tony learned to pole dance was unknown to Steve.
“Stark? Don’t you dare. You’ll die!” shouted Steve through the coms as soon as JARVIS confirmed the link.
Being on a team with Captain America was not really doing anything for Tony’s self-esteem. Tony had spent his entire childhood and adolescence being compared to the great Captain America. Howard Stark didn’t care about Tony. He cared about Steve Rogers.
“I mean it, Tony. I’m so, so proud of you. You’ve… you’ve been through so much and you’ve beaten the odds every single time. You work so hard, every damn day. I couldn’t be happier to call such a strong man my fiancé. You make my life better.” Spoke Steve as he smiled down at Tony.
Steve didn’t know how to respond to that. Or well, to any of what was going on. Tony Stark was his soulmate and from the look and sound of things, it appeared that the man never thought that he’d ever have one. There was a certain insecurity in his voice that Steve was able to pick up.
Steve didn’t sleep that night. He was s stressed about trying to make things better. He wanted Tony to trust him. He wanted Tony to know that he liked him. He wanted to ask the man out for fucks sake. But Steve, well, he didn’t know what to do. Tony was convinced that Steve hated him. He’d resigned to that fact and in a moment of vulnerability, he’d let his insecurities peak through for just a second. Who’s to know what else Tony was feeling.
“Tony…” worried Steve as he looked at his fiancé. Tony’s hands were shaking and his lips were trembling.
“I love you, Tony.” Smiled Steve and Tony sleepily smiled back.
“I’m guessing they gave you the good drugs?” smiled Steve and Tony gave him a dopy smile back.
Now, as for the brace around your neck. You suffered some extreme damage to both your vocal cords and your artery. Fortunately, we were able to get your artery stable. Unfortunately, we were unable to save your vocal cords and they had to be removed. It is unlikely that you’ll ever talk again. I’m sorry Mr. Stark.”
“I love you too Tony. Love you more than anything.”
Signed Tony with a smile. He stood on his tiptoes to give Steve a kiss and Steve smiled back.
It didn’t take long before the two had devested each other of their clothes and were making out on the bed like a couple of horny teenagers. Hands wandered as the two got all hot and bothered. Eventually, Steve managed to reach over to the bedside table to pull out the tube of lube they were currently using. It didn’t take long before Steve was fingering Tony open while sucking hickeys onto his neck.
“Yeah. Yeah. Let’s get one.” Blushed Tony, his voice a bit hurried.
And Steve felt the same about Tony.
“But I’m hungry.” Whined Tony and Steve just shook his head fondly.
“…no…”
Teased Tony.
He never thought he’d see the day where Tony Stark died.
Time for some more fluff and angst. I hope you’re ready. We’ve got another short one here but I promise that they’re about to get longer again. School is just a bit crazy. I have to make a whole ass magazine for one of my classes. Well, it’s only 12 pages but I have so many articles to write and take all my own pictures for it so it’s a lot of work. Well, I hope you enjoy the chapter. -Shadows
“Fuck Tony. So tight.” Groaned Steve as he slowly began to thrust in and out of his love.
By the time Tony had finished his speech, he felt absolutely drained. Steve was the one to help him up and out of the room. Neither cared about the flashing cameras and questions shouted at them. Tony just wanted some lunch and a nap. And maybe some Steve cuddles. Yeah, Steve cuddles sounded great.
Steve didn’t really want to dwell too much on what was going on. This was going to be a long surgery and he needed to occupy his time. He started by going back to his and Tony’s room and taking a shower. He let the hot water warm him up after spending so long in medical. He let it try and wash his worries away.
Two months later Steve asked Tony out on a date and the rest was history.
“Harley’s been crying for you. Here, why don’t you hold your son.”
“Hey... Hey... Shhh, Tony. Shhh. Love. Don’t talk. Don’t talk alright. Help is on the way. You’re gonna be alright.” Cried, Steve. His composure was slipping and Steve was absolutely terrified. The love of his life was bleeding out on the concrete and he was powerless to do anything except offer comfort.
“You know, we are right next to the bed.” Smirked Steve as he slid his hands a little bit lower.
“Oh, hey Steve. I just had JARVIS record all my findings from tonight. I got some good stuff.” Smiled Tony as Steve walked into the room. Steve just stared for a moment before he slammed the door shut and walked in over to Tony.
“I hate you.” Sighed Tony and Steve smiled back at him.
“Tony, come on. Please. Please tell me what’s going on. You’ve been sitting here with tears in your eyes. I… Tony.” Pleaded Steve one afternoon while the two were laying in Tony’s medical bed together. Tony just shook his head and snuggled in closer to Steve’s side.
“Someday those assholes will learn.” Spoke Steve and Tony smiled as he looked at the ceiling of their room. Steve had painted it recently. It was don’t up in red, gold, and blue swirls, flowers, and vines. It was a colourful mess and Tony loved it.
“Does anyone know Stark’s last location?” asked Steve, his voice rising with worry. He didn’t like the situation Tony had been in. He’d left his suit off to the side because the bombs were too small and unstable for him to disable while wearing the suit.
The second they arrived back on their floor, clothes were flying and Tony quickly found himself lifted into Steve’s arms and backed up against a wall. He ground his erection against Steve’s abs and groaned when Steve palmed at his ass.
“So I’m useless.” Cried Tony his voice rising a bit with each word. “I’m useless. How am I supposed to work like this? I can’t! I can’t even hold a screwdriver. How am I supposed to be useful to you guys if I can’t work?”
The day everything changed started out just like any other day at the tower. The Avengers all ate breakfast and went about their daily business. Tony wandered into the kitchen around 11 am in search of coffee and food after the all-nighter he’d pulled to fix up Natasha’s widow bites. He was exhausted and more than ready to bite into the mac and cheese he’d made when the call to assemble went off. Food be damned, it was time to join in the fight.
The two ended up falling asleep together. The doctors brought in a bigger bed the next day.
Tony was thankful for that.
“I’m so glad you’re back home. Medical was getting too dreary.”
“Sam!” called Bucky and he managed to get the other man’s attention.
“Stee…” coughed Tony and Steve took one of his hands in his own while Steve’s other hand went to go and apply some pressure to the wound in Tony’s neck. He was extra careful not to apply too much and to not move the shrapnel at all.
Steve made Tony feel like he was finally worthy of love.
“You… you lost a lot of blood. Your heart and your body couldn’t handle giving birth. Your… your heart stopped twice Tony. Twice! I thought I was going to lose you!”  cried Steve and Tony frowned. Why was Steve so worried about him? Harley was fine so why was he worried about Tony?
You see, while Steve had been getting his tattoos done, he’d also been posting the finished projects to his Instagram so he could give his artist credit. But even though Steve had been living in the 21
“I love you, Steve Rogers.”
“Alright, fine. How about Harley? Harley Joseph Stark-Rogers?” asked Steve and Tony looked over at him with wide eyes. Stark-Rogers? Now that wasn’t right. The baby wasn’t going to be Tony’s so why on Earth would he have Tony’s last name. Tony had to pull the plug on that and quickly.
“So did something go wrong or did something go right?”
In October of 2015, the Avengers got a call out to deal with a villain going by the name of Dr. Doom. Doom was a weird fellow. He was the leader of the very small country of Latveria and he had an affinity for technology. But, instead of using it for good and helping his people, he decided to make killer robots and terrorize everyone else. Normally, a group called The Fantastic Four dealt with him and his antics, but they were busy doing something else that day so the Avengers took the call. Actually, the Avengers had worked with the Fantastic Four on a few occasions. Their guy, Johnny Storm sure looked a lot like Steve but like, less beefy. Bucky and Tony liked to tease Steve about that.
“I don’t have you, Tony. I don’t. I’ve never hated you.” Stated Steve as he tried to look Tony in the eye, but Tony’s own eyes stayed trained to his hands.
They could finally rest.
“Why the fuck do you even care?!” shouted Tony as he winced a bit in pain.
“And how did that work out for you?”
Steve had been the one to ask Tony out a few months after SHIELD fell and all the Avengers began living together while taking down what remained of HYDRA. Tony had recently gotten his arc reactor removed and had also just broken up with Pepper. Tony had been moody and grouchy after the breakup and Steve decided that the man needed some company.
As Tony dozed in his arms, Steve took a moment to think. The two of them had been through a lot in the last few years. Tony more so than any member of the team bar for Bucky. He needed a break. They both did. Maybe they should take a vacation. Somewhere warm where they could be alone. They hadn’t originally thought of taking a honeymoon, but after Tony’s accident, it seemed like a good idea to take one. Smiling, Steve leant down and kissed the crown of Tony’s head before he whispered a little message to him.
So he flew the nuke into the portal and hoped that Steve Rogers would be proud of him for laying down on the wire.
The infection had spread from Tony’s eye to the broken bone surrounding it. Because of this, Tony’s eye as well as a nice chunk of bone would need to be removed to stop the infection from spreading. Because of this, the area would need to be packed and closed over. This unfortunately meant that Tony wasn’t going to get any sort of glass eye to try and keep up his appearance. He’d be scared and eyeless.
Tony was awake when Steve entered. He looked more lucid than he had the day before but that had its downsides. Tony looked like he was in more pain now that he wasn’t on all the crazy pain meds but he was hiding it well. The two caught each other’s gaze and Steve took that as his cue to walk into the room.
So, with those horrible, completely untrue facts in his head, Tony resolved to not get attached to the baby. This was Steve’s baby. Not his.
And a month into their newfound relationship, Tony found his voice again and spoke up.
As Steve scanned the area he saw the scorch marks on the far wall and on the roof. The Iron Man armour was strewn about everywhere and in the middle of it lay Tony. Steve sprinted to his side and immediately began to panic when he saw the state that Tony was in. Pieces of the Iron Man armour had sliced up Tony’s body but the worst places were his right eye and throat. There was an impressively large piece embedded in Tony’s eye while another large piece was sitting in the middle of his neck while blood oozed sluggishly around it. As well, Tony’s right leg was sitting at an odd angle but that was the least of Steve’s worries.
“Well, he had the most amazing eyes. Had the greatest ass and the biggest heart. He was my everything. He died, last year for me. He was 87. We lived a great life. Best I could have hoped for.” Smiled Steve as he talked about his Tony.
When the doctor came out and told them that Tony was alive and would heal, Steve just about lost his cool and started crying. Luckily, he held it together to hear the information the doctor was giving them. Tony’s femur had a clean break but needed to be pined and held together for the next two months. He’d be in medical for another week at least to allow things to settle. After that Tony would be confined to a wheelchair for a while to keep the pressure off of the bone.
Joked Tony one evening over dinner.
“Steve?” rasped Tony and Steve smiled at him.
“I know. But if it meant you lived then it’s worth it.”
“Steve… I’m pretty sure I’m in labour.” gasped Tony as he reached out and took Steve’s hand in a death grip. He needed the grounding touch.
“Sorry?” frowned Steve.
Steve slowly began to pick up the pace. As his thrusts got stronger, he took Tony’s hands in one of his and held them above Tony’s head while his other hand gripped at Tony’s hip enough to leave a handprint-shaped bruise there in the morning. Steve’s own personal claim and Tony’s dirty little secret.
“Tony, No! No. I love you. I love you and I love Harley. We’re a family.” spoke Steve as his voice fell. “I love you Tony Stark.”
“Right. I would never lie to you. Now what we’re going to do is we’re going to leave the lab and go curl up together in bed and watch a movie. You need to rest doll.”
It felt great knowing that he had people who loved and appreciated him.
After nearly six hours one of the doctors came into the hall to let everyone know what was going on.
When Tony woke up again hours later it was to the sound of crying and Steve singing. Harley must have woken up wanting something. Tony just laid there in bed watching Steve with the baby. He was good with Harley. Tony knew he would be. Steve was made to be a good dad. Tony wasn’t.
Tony sat on the ground of his lab bathroom for a long time, just thinking. He was pregnant. He was pregnant with Steve Roger’s baby. On one hand, Tony was happy. He’d sort of always wanted kids of his own. Sure, his own father had been a monumental piece of shit, but Tony liked kids. He liked to go to hospitals in his armour to greet the kids there. He loved holding babies. He found it soothing.
Tony wasn’t surprised anymore when Steve showed up not long after Tony had retired to the bedroom and began mother henning.
“You and me both.” Smiled back, Tony.
The two lay together catching their breath for a few minutes before either got up. They just laid in each other's arms and savoured the moment. They were safe. They were together, they were in love. It was perfection. Eventually, the cooling fluids on their bodies became a little much and Steve, with his boundless energy, got up to grab a towel to clean them up before bed. Steve was gentle in his motions. He made sure they were clean before he threw the towel aside and pulled Tony back into his arms. Tony laid his head on Steve’s chest and sighed in contentment. He loved how Steve made him feel. He felt safe. He felt loved. He felt powerful.
Steve thoroughly washed his hands and threw a mask on before he entered Tony’s room. He almost fainted when he saw his fiancé on the bed covered in bandages and wires. There was a neck brace around Tony’s neck and half of his face was covered in bandages and there was a little bit of blood around the edges.
“Fuck. So good Tony.”
He hated himself for not using the gauntlet himself.
“I’m sorry. I’m so sorry. You deserve better.” Spoke Tony, his voice only cracking a little bit.
But for now, Tony was just focused on healing. He wanted to heal and get better so that he could finally walk down the aisle and marry the love of his life. He wanted that so badly it hurt.
Two months after they found the sceptre the Avengers moved into a new compound upstate complete with new labs, a large training space, and a fully operational medical wing.
“Shh. Shh sugar. You’re alright. I’ve got you.” spoke Steve as he tried to soothe the frantic Omega.
“Tony. No… No. I don’t hate you.” Worried Steve.
He couldn’t talk.
Having Tony there with him made everything worth it.
“I love you.” Smiled Steve and Tony smiled back.
“Fuck! I can’t do this! I can’t fucking do this!” shouted Tony as he got up from his seat. Steve was at his side in a second and was concerned when he saw a few unshed tears in Tony’s eyes.
It took a bit for the doctors to get Tony checked over and on some pain medication. The whole time Steve sat off to the side, just watching and making sure Tony was alright. He didn’t need his soulmate dying on him again. But soon enough, the doctors left leaving just Tony and Steve in the secluded medical room.
The hall was simultaneously too quiet and too loud as Tony hobbled to the chair that was put out for him. People were shouting all sorts of questions and there were a lot of not-so-nice comments about his face. But Tony slipped into his mask and faced the crowd of reporters.  Steve gave his shoulder a squeeze before he took the microphone from the stand and took his seat next to Tony. He turned it a bit so that he could clearly see Tony’s hands. By then, a deafening silence had washed over the hall as people wondered what was going on.
“I love you, Tony. So damn much.” Whispered Steve as he pulled Tony's head to his chest and the blankets around them.
“You… you what?” asked Tony as he stared down at his hands. He couldn’t bring up the courage to look at Steve.
But, before either of them could act on what had just happened, the room exploded and they were all thrown around. Steve helped Tony to his feet and the two went sprinting out of the room. They could worry about their new situation later. For now, the carrier was falling and they needed to fix that before everyone died.
Tony was laying on the ground covered in very obvious cuts and scrapes from the bomb. But that was what was concerning. What was concerning was the very obvious break to Tony’s left femur.
“I’m gonna take such good care of you Sweetheart.” Cooed Steve as he looked down at the love of his life.
Tony used his free hand to sign that to Steve. The entire team knew sign language because Clint had hearing problems and wore hearing aids. They all learned ASL to help him out. Looked like learning that had come in handy since that was currently his only method of communication until he got a pen or a StarkPad. Although Tony really didn’t mind signing. He just didn’t like how his signs got a bit jumbles if he was tired or shaky.
Tony pressed the sign for I Love You over Steve’s heart and Steve did the same. They were married. They were married and they felt amazing. It had taken so much to get to this moment and finally, finally, they could enjoy it.
They would always be alright. It just took a little bit of work, but they were alright.
By the end of Steve’s little speech, there wasn’t a dry eye in the room.
For so long Tony had been certain that he’d never have anything like this. Howard, Stane, and a few horrible ex’s like Ty Stone and Sunset Bain had done a number on his in the past and had left Tony with a bit of a messed up view of himself. Afghanistan hadn’t helped much either. But getting together with Steve had shown Tony that he could be loved. That he wasn’t bad. He was just human and humans make mistakes.
“I’m pregnant. I’m pregnant with your baby and I’m keeping it.” rushed out Tony and then the room was silent once more.
“I love you Tony Stark.” Whispered Steve as he pulled back to let Tony catch his breath.
“The internet keeps bugging me for updates on you.” Sighed Steve as he showed Tony the astronomical amount of notifications on his phone.
The second that arrived back at the compound, Tony was wheeled away for surgery. In his panic, Steve tried to follow and was pushed to the side and away from the operating room. Steve watched as the love of his life was wheeled away and that was when the reality of the situation began to hit him. Tony’s injuries were very severe. There was no denying that. What if that was the last time that Steve ever saw his beloved? What if “Love you Steve” were Tony’s last words.
“Why can’t you keep him, Tony?” Pressed Steve. He needed answers.
“Fuck, Steve. So close. Right there, so fucking close…” cried out Tony as Steve’s thrusts picked up.
“I… I can’t! No! Can’t hold him! Please don’t make me. Please stop lying. Not my son! Not mine. Can’t get attached.” cried Tony as his panic increased and his breathing became unsteady.
“You almost died.” Stated Steve as he scooted in closer to Tony’s bed.
“Tony!” shouted Steve as he ran to his side and called for aid over the coms.
“Of course I do. You promised when we started dating to tell me every day until I believed you. And I believe you. What’s all this about?” asked Tony and Steve knew it was time.
“Fuck, Steve. Yes! Please, right there.” Moaned Tony as Steve aimed his fingers just right.
But that still didn’t make it any easier to see the love of his life looking like a shell of his former self on the bad days.
Steve was silent throughout the whole affair. He knew if he tried to talk he’d end up sobbing. He mostly stayed off to the side after the funeral. He was an absolute emotional wreck and he knew he wouldn’t be getting much better. Natasha’s funeral was set for the next day and he knew he would continue to just handle the loss of his family poorly.
“But you almost died!”
Once they got to the hospital Steve was screaming for help. Soon enough Tony was surrounded by doctors while Steve hovered at his side. Now normally Tony would be pretty pissed off about being smothered by medical professionals, but he was in pain and generally not feeling great about the prospect of giving birth but not being able to keep the baby for his own. After this was all over, Tony was going to leave the team. He didn’t know if he’d be able to handle being around any of them after this. Not when he couldn’t keep his own baby.
Tony didn’t know what to do anymore.
Life wouldn’t be worth living without him.
“Do it!” he commanded but was quickly interrupted.
worried Tony as he pulled at his cuffs.
“Hey there Tony. You took quite the tumble back there.” Spoke Steve as he sat down next to Tony’s bed.
“Fuck, Steve. I’m read. So fucking ready.” Moaned Tony as Steve moved his four fingers inside of him. He brushed against Tony’s prostate and that had Tony nearly screaming and arcing off the bed. Thank fuck for soundproof walls.
Steve and Rhodey got to their feet on shaky legs and followed the doctor off to a side room near where Tony was. Steve wanted so badly to run to Tony’s side to see how bad everything was, but he stayed put. This was important if he wanted to help Tony.
“Tony, you don’t look horrible. Your scars are part of you. You’re beautiful. Don’t let the world tell you any different.” Cooed Steve and Tony smiled back shyly.
There were days were Tony woke up in pain. Days where Tony became so frustrated with himself that he’d start crying silent tears. Days where his own silence was too much to bear. Those were the days when Tony wanted nothing more than to just scream at the world. To scream and let it all out. To scream about the injustice of it all.
The two lovers sat there for a moment in an attempt to catch their breath. Steve held Tony safely in his arms as they began to calm down. Steve couldn’t help but move Tony’s chin to give him a kiss. Tony met his eyes with a smile. They really did love each other. Nobody made them as happy as the other did.
?” asked Tony as he smiled up at Steve.
But then, all too soon, Tony took a turn for the worst.
smiled back Tony. Steve smiled back. He was glad that Tony was getting back a bit of his snark.
Steve pulled Tony in closer and tucked Tony’s head under his chin. He ran his arms over Tony’s back and arms. The touch was grounding for both of them.
“I’m so proud of you doll. So proud of you for asking for help. We’ll get you help. We’ll get you healing. I promise Sweet Heart. So proud of you.” Cooed Steve as he held Tony close and kissed his forehead.
Needless to say, Tony had been feeling extremely insecure about everything. He just felt empty.
That was when something snapped into place for Steve. For months Tony had been acting strange. He didn’t want to talk about the baby. He didn’t help with any of Harley’s room set up. Hell, he’d told Steve not to give Harley his own last name and to just stick with Rogers as a last name. And the fact that Tony was stressing about trying not to get attached to the baby? Did Tony think that Steve was just going to take Harley and leave?! Not, that was unacceptable! Steve had to fix this.
Steve had planned that night meticulously. While Tony and Bruce were working hard down in the lab on some new smart medical equipment, Steve was making sure he had Tony’s favourite food ready to go as well as some dessert, candles, rose petals, and of course the ring he planned to propose with. It was all set up in their room and Steve was bouncing with excitement and nervousness.
“What’s a thirst trap?” asked Steve.
Half a second later the bomb exploded and Tony was thrown back as his body erupted in pain. All Tony saw was red as he hit the ground.
Steve and his ever mother henning glory, noticed that Tony had been feeling off again. He understood why. Tony had gone through something life-changing and traumatic. Of course he’d be feeling horrible. Steve would be concerned of Tony wasn’t feeling bad about what had happened.
“And why shouldn’t a guy let off a little steam?” argued Tony. He didn’t know why but every time he got near Loki’s glowstick of destiny he felt angry and bitter. He placed his hand on the good captain’s shoulder and looked out over the room.
When Steve had been found in the ice he was lost and confused. He was removed from his time. He’d missed everything. He was scared and angry and he didn’t know what to do. He picked fights with everyone. He isolated himself. He refused to learn about most things about the time he was now stuck in.
“God Tony. No! You are so good. You’re amazing. You’re amazing and I love you so much.”
“I’m fiiiine. I’m totally fine.” Slurred out Tony
Tony was pretty much surrounded by his friends once he was back out the door. He was smothered in hugs and encouragement. He was soon whisked away back to their living quarters and plopped down on the couch. Steve wrapped him in a blanket and Bruce got to cooking. He had to make extra since Clint’s wife and kids were arriving at the compound that night to move in permanently. Tony was kind of excited to have the kids there permanently. They were good kids. Rambunctious but good.
“What kind of problem? Do I need to beat someone up?” asked Happy and Tony shook his head.
“Whatever.” Huffed Tony, “Why are you even here?”
But, when Tony was called up on the stage for his little performance, all bets were off and Steve getting any more work done that night. He couldn’t take his eyes off of Tony the entire time he was up on that stage. He worked the pole like he’d been born on it. He’s legs. Fuck his legs. Steve had seen Tony naked multiple times and he’d never been so tantalized by his legs before. And his ass! Steve could write poems about Tony’s ass. Steve didn’t care if he looked like an idiot staring at his boyfriend as he danced. He just couldn’t take his eyes off of him.
“I know you hate me but can you give me a little slack here! If it weren't for me, those civilians would be dead!” murmured Tony and Steve felt his heart sink.
“Hey, it’s alright. SHIELD is on its way. We’ll get you checked out.” Soothed Steve. There were still tears in his eyes.
Hours later, when it was finally time for Tony to push, Tony knew that something was wrong. He felt absolutely horrible. His vision kept blacking out and he was very quickly losing energy. He didn’t even have the energy to shout out in pain because pushing a baby out was very painful.
“I love you so much, Tony. Please… Please come back to me. Please.”
“You’ll be alright doll. The doctors and nurses will make sure you stay asleep. You’re safe Sweet Heart.” Soothed Steve as he held Tony's hand and kissed his forehead. Suddenly, Tony pulled his hand away from Steve’s and began signing.
“Hey, dance with me.” Smiled Steve as he got up and pulled Tony into his arms.
Steve didn’t return to medical until the next day. He was too caught on what Tony had said. What the hell had he done to make Tony think that he still hated him. And well, Steve had never really hated Tony. He was just going through a lot and he didn’t take out his frustrations in the most healthy way. That was on Steve, not Tony.
Little Lila Barton was their flower girl. She looked so adorable in her red and blue dress as she walked down the aisle throwing gold and white flower petals. She was so excited to be the flower girl. The entire week leading up to the wedding she’d been practicing by throwing things all over the compound.
As Steve continued to talk, he noticed Tony’s eyes dropping further and his hand beginning to slack in Steve’s own. And that was when Steve truly began to panic. If Tony fell asleep now he might just slip off forever. He couldn’t lose Tony. He just couldn’t. He loved him!
Tony just looked back up at Steve and pressed the sign for “I love you” into Steve’s chest, right above his heart. Although Tony wasn’t in the mood for all the mushy stuff, he knew that Steve meant every last word that he had said. That was one thing that Tony was sure of. That Steve loved him. And that he loved Steve.
“I think… I think I need a nap.” Rasped Tony as his breathing became a bit shallow.
When it came down to creating the guest list, both Tony and Steve agreed that they wanted a small wedding. Just the other Avengers, their friends, and Rhodey’s family who were also as good as Tony’s wedding. No press. No outsiders. Just Tony, Steve, and the people that mattered to them.
So pretty much everyone was excited about the baby. The team was supportive and talked a lot about the baby to Steve. Tony mostly just existed and smiled when he wasn’t throwing up or feeling achy. Sometimes he wished that the others would talk to him. But, as Tony’s hormones spiked and got all wonky, so did his own insecurities.
“Alright Tony, you’ve absolutely got a broke femur here. We need to splint you up and get you back to the tower for medical treatment. This could get really bad the longer we wait.” Spoke Bruce and Steve saw Tony’s face blanch a bit.
“Tony…” began Steve as he moved to take the seat at Tony’s bedside. “I don’t think you leaving medical is a good idea right now. You got hurt pretty bad. Plus you’ve got all those screws in your thigh and I know you, the second you’re let out of here you’ll hide in your lab for a week.” Worried Steve as he looked Tony over.
“I… I guess we should talk everything over.” Spoke Tony after a moment of awkward silence.
“Tony!” shouted Steve as he made his way through the building.
The next day Steve donned his suit, grabbed the case containing the stones and Thor’s hammer, and confidently strode up onto the platform. He had a solid plan ready to go. He’d made his peace with Bucky and he knew that Sam and the others would be fine. They’d be just fine. And so would Steve. He could feel it.
From there the two got to know each other beyond the personality profiles that SHIELD gave them back during Loki’s invasion. They joked and learned about each other. Tony learned about Steve’s childhood and his hopes and dreams while Steve learned about all the bullshit Tony went through as a child. By the end of that talk, both of them loathed Howard Stark.
“Oh Tony.” sighed Steve.
“Oh fuck…” moaned Steve as his hands flew up to grasp Tony’s hips. They fit together so perfectly. They were made for each other.
“Cap, I named my bots DUM-E, U, and Butterfingers. Do you really think I’m cut out to name a baby? No. I’m absolutely not! This is your call.” Spoke Tony. He tried to keep his tone light and joking so as not to alert Steve to the real reason he didn’t want to name the baby. Steve was just asking as a courtesy after all.
Next up was Tony’s turn. He let go of Steve’s hands so that he could sign to him. Rhodey also stepped into view. Rhodey’s family was still learning sign so Rhodey was there to translate. With a nod and smile, Tony began his vows.
Signed Tony and Steve kissed him with a smile.
Steve also spoke up on his feeling on the matter. How when he was a kid he also thought he was never going to get a soulmate with him being so small and sickly and how he thought the serum had stolen his ability to even have one. But now they had each other. They would be alright.
Now, while Tony appreciated the bluntness, he couldn’t help but feel absolutely shocked at the news. So shocked that he passed out and Steve began to panic.
A week after their engagement, Tony and Steve posted the news to their social media accounts. As predicted the internet went crazy. Fans of Tony and Steve went ballistic over the news. One teenage girl even got a nose bleed in her excitement. It was a little weird. And sure, there were the homophobic assholes who were overly vocal over Tony and Steve’s upcoming nuptials, but neither Tony nor Steve paid them any mind.
It took them a little bit to actually make it to the conference room of the compound. Tony was on crutches and still quite weak and tired after his stint in medical so they made sure to budget in extra time for them to actually get there. But, once they were there Pepper was already walking out and the rest of the team were huddled around.
Nothing could ruin their happiness.
“We’re not even mated! I’m nothing. I’m not good!”
signed Tony as more tears fell and his breathing hitched.
“We don’t have a pole in our room.”
“I… I don’t think I’m going to come back after returning the stones, Buck.” Spoke Steve the afternoon before he was to depart on his journey. They were sitting by the crater that was the compound just watching the construction crews work on sifting through the massive amounts of rubble.
He’d called Tony worthless. Well, not directly but Tony knew he meant it from his words. They hurt. Tony wanted to be good. He’d been trying so hard. But he knew he could never measure up to Captain America.
So yes, Tony was happy. So fucking happy. Despite everything. Despite the pain. Despite losing an eye and his voice, he was happy. For the first time in a long time, Tony knew that he was worthy of love. That he was worthy of happiness. It was all because of the little life he’d forged.
Steve just knew that all they laying around was going to piss Tony off. That man was always on the move.
Eventually, after some therapy appointments that Steve made Tony go to, he was holding Harley on his own. He still kept Steve close by. He didn’t quite trust himself with the baby yet. But this was a step.
All Tony could do was nod and allow Rhodey to lead him towards the compound’s ballroom where his and Steve’s wedding would take place. Everyone that mattered to Tony and Steve was in attendance. All the Avengers were there, as well as the Barton kids and Laura Barton. Happy and Pepper were there as well. The entire Rhodes clan was in attendance. They’d basically adopted Tony as one of their own. Mama Rhodes sat right up from with Rhodey’s sister and her kids.
“Tony. Sweet Heart. It doesn’t matter to me if you can’t talk anymore. What I care about is that you’re alive and here with me. And you will always be Tony Stark. You are still powerful Tony. Even without your voice. I love you, Tony. I love you so damn much and I will do whatever it takes to make sure that you’re comfortable. I’m not leaving Tony. Not unless you tell me to.” Soothed Steve as he ran a comforting hand up and down Tony’s back.
Moments later Tony was coming between their bodies and messing up their shirts with his spend. The rhythmic clenching sent Steve over the edge. It was a good thing that the walls of their floor were soundproof.
“You know I’m proud of you, right Tony?” spoke Steve one night as they were laying together in Tony’s medical bed watching some mindless comedy special on Netflix.  Tony just blinked back at him and nodded sluggishly. He wasn’t in the mood to really deal with all the mushy gushy stuff that came with being in a relationship with Steve.
Steve pulled back from Tony in shock. Was Tony seriously thinking that?
“I don’t know Tony. I still think a red, white, and blue theme is the way to go.” Joked Steve as Tony stuck his tongue out at him.
Three days after that Steve had come home with a goofy grin on his face sporting his first tattoo. There, right over Steve’s heart, written in a bold script reminiscent of Tony’s blocky handwriting, sat the last words Tony had ever spoken to Steve.
“You know how much I love you, right?” asked Steve as Tony pulled away a bit to look up at him.
“Tony…” started Steve as he pulled Tony closer, but Tony was beginning to sob again.
So the prospect of showing off his scared features to the world was setting Tony on edge.
Tony spent his afternoon on the largest, comfiest couch in the living room eating snacks and watching movies with his friends. He was safely enveloped in Steve’s arms and for the first time in months, Tony felt completely at ease.
He should have said no.
And so, with one last deep breath, Tony raised his hands so he could sign while Steve got ready to relay his speech.
While the other Avengers took care of the five Doom Bots that Dr. Doom had unleashed on Queens, Tony was busy tracking down the bomb Doom said he had planted in the area. Tony was the one on the team with the best weapons knowledge and he would be the one who was best suited to disarming the bomb.
The statement Steve posted was met with an outpouring of support, although Steve didn’t look at all the posts coming in from people he didn’t know. He just cared about Tony. Always about his Tony.
By the end, Tony was exhausted and Steve felt horrible.
“Sometimes I hate your giddy optimism.” Snarked Tony.
The two did almost everything together. They were made for each other. They were two halves of one whole. They were happy.
“Steve, SHIELD is here with the air evac. Keep him awake.” Shouted Natasha and Steve nodded as he fussed over his fiancé.
Steve wasn’t able to finish his sentence before the tears started flowing. He just wasn’t in a place where he was currently able to deal with everybody he’d lost. He wanted to scream and cry and hit something. He wanted to bring Tony and Nat back. He wanted this nightmare to end and the only solution he could think of was to use the stones to bring himself somewhere else. He just couldn’t deal with living here anymore.
“It isn’t”
Was all Tony was able to sign back with his shaky hands.
Next Steve got changed into something more comfortable. Just some sweatpants and a grey sweater that he knew Tony loved. He also grabbed some clothes and blankets for Tony. Just little things that would bring him some comfort. According to the doctors, Tony still had a long path of recovery ahead of him and he’d be in medical for a while yet. Steve wanted to make sure that the love of his life was comfortable. He knew that Tony would do the same for him. There was one point at the beginning of their relationship when Steve had gotten hurt and needed to spend the night in medical. Tony absolutely smothered him in blankets and didn’t leave his side.
“Now you’re ready.” Smirked Steve. Whoever accused Steve of being a virgin was a big fat liar.
But not long after, Steve noticed that Tony’s face was paling fast and his grip was weakening.
“Aaaaaaallll of the good drugs.”
Rhodey was in and out a lot. Same with Pepper, Happy, and everyone else. They all wanted to check in on Tony to make sure he was still alive. They also checked in on Steve and made sure he had the things he needed.
asked Tony.
“Like it’s someone else’s.”
Steve also had a bounce in his step as they left medical behind. He’d spent the last two months worrying over Tony and having his own nightmares about his love dying in his arms. Now that they were finally leaving medical Steve could finally breathe again. But that wasn’t the whole reason behind his happiness.
By the time Steve got back to medical, he had ample time to set up Tony’s room to make it more comfortable. Someone had also brought in a cot for him so that he was no longer sleeping on the couch in the corner of the room. Steve took his time setting things up but by the time he was done, Steve still had another couple of hours to wait.
“Oh, well… that reminds me.” Smiled Steve as he reached for the circular leather bag that was sitting next to him. Sam watched in intrigue as Steve unzipped the bag to unveil a new, sparkling shield.
“Tony?”
Steve, still in his beaten and bloody uniform collapsed against the while walls of medical and slid down to the floor as he began sobbing. It took a great deal to get Steve crying. Now was one of those times. Steve’s head fell between his knees as his arms flopped over his knees. He just sat there sobbing in his soiled uniform, Tony’s blood still on his hands. He ignored the fact that the dirt on his unfirm stained the wall behind him. There were more important things on his mind.
It took Tony a few days to finally start to see the positive effects of the surgery. The infection went away and Tony’s fever broke. He was no longer throwing up and his throat was finally on the mend. Tony was slowly getting healthier and both Tony and Steve were happy about that.
“Well, I’m glad you like it because I’m getting more.”
Steve was a wreck as he and the others waited for Tony to get out of surgery. None of them knew how bad the injury was nor if Tony was alright. Steve was having an especially hard time. He felt so helpless. All he could do was sit there and wait while the man he’d fallen for under-went surgery. He felt helpless and angry and he couldn’t do anything. All Steve could do was wait and hope that Tony was alright.
And Tony did. He came with a whine and had Steve following a moment later. Tony was just so sweet and so tight and making all sorts of noises. Steve couldn’t help himself.
Steve was out with Sam and Bucky doing hell knows what when Tony asked his friends for help. He hadn’t been doing so great over the past few days and Tony had grown enough to know that he needed help. But this wasn’t something he was ready to converse with Steve about. So, he called in Rhodey, Pepper, and Happy.
With a stuttering breath, Tony slowly pried his left eye open. And that on its own was weird. Why couldn’t he open his right eye? Why did it hurt so badly? The light in the room as well as the sound of a heart monitor were very much overstimulating to Tony’s senses so Tony tried to turn his head into the pillow he was laying on. He very quickly learned that he couldn’t. There was something hard around his neck.
“Fuck…” moaned out Tony as he sank down. “Fuck I needed this.”
Tony and Steve’s first dance was magical. Steve held Tony close as they swayed to the music. Everything else just seemed to melt away until it was only the two of them left. Steve couldn’t help but lean in and kiss his husband. He would never get enough of being able to kiss his husband.
Signed Tony furiously.
Steve and Tony sat there in silence for a little bit. Neither really minded. The silence was oddly comforting after the eventful day they’d both had. Although, the silence became stifling after a while and the incessant beeping of one of the machines began to grate on Steve’s nerve so he began talking again.
Once the infection was detected, the doctors started Tony on a course of antibiotics and twice-daily cleanings of the area. It was horrible to see Tony hooked up to even more IV lines. It was even worse when Tony had to have his eye cleaned. Tony would grip his hand in an iron vice as tears rolled down his cheeks from the pain. Steve wished that he could take Tony’s pain away. His love had been through so much already. Had endured too much. Tony deserved so much better.
Steve was quick to slick himself up and slide into his lover. Tony moaned loudly and Steve was no better. They’d both been so pent up lately. They needed this. They really needed this.
“Language.” Shouted back Steve although his voice was laced with concern.
“Can’t you give me a hint?”
The Avengers hadn’t said anything about what actually happened to Tony since the accident had happened. They didn’t want the public to know until Tony was ready for them to know. Everyone would just have to suck it up and wait because it was all on Tony now. This was his call to make.
Well, at least Tony knew that he was still getting married to Steve. Actually, that had been one of the things helping Tony keep it together. He loved Steve so damn much. Tony wanted to cling to the happiness he’d found with Steve. But this…? This was a major set back and Tony didn’t know how to feel about anything anymore. He just hurt all the time and he was scared. So damn scared.
The second Steve had Tony prepared Tony was sinking down onto Steve’s cock.
Steve made sure to remind Tony every single day that he was loved and that he was good. He gave Tony cuddles and massages and just generally showered him with affection. Steve loved Tony. He wasn’t going to go anywhere.
So here we go. Finally, the turning point where the angst slowly starts to turn into fluff. I hope you’re ready. Also, this one’s a little short cuz I’ve been busy with school. I’ve got so many projects and pictures to take for my classes. Actually, huge self-plug. If you like photography and cool low light stuff, follow my insta,
It should have been a routine call out for the team. They should have been able to hack into the building's system, take down the terrorists and save the hostages while Tony disabled the bombs. It should have been easy.
“I’ll cut right to the chase,” began the doctor and Steve and Rhodey listened closely. “Mr. Stark is in bad shape. The metal in his neck sliced through his vocal cords quite profoundly. We tried to save them but the damage what extremely extensive and they had to be removed. I’m sorry but in his condition, it is extremely unlikely that Mr. Stark will ever talk again.”
So, with the easy stuff handled and out of the way, Tony and Steve had more time to focus on some of the harder things.
“We’ll be alright though. We will. I’ll take care of you. Fuck, I love you so much.”
“Thank you. I’ll do my best.”
But while Steve was going on his own personal journey of realization, Tony was trying really hard to tackle his own demons.
So Steve started doing his own research on the man. He’d come to the conclusion that Natasha’s profile had come from a bias situation and wasn’t fair to the man. And when Steve found out that the profile had been made while Tony was actively dying from heavy metal poisoning, well that just spurred him further into finding the truth.
“Look Tones. I know that a lot has happened to you. I know that that stupid head of yours can’t help but focus on all the bullshit. If I could go back and give Howard a piece of my mind then I would. But today? Today is all about you and Steve. He loves you so much Tones. I’ve never seen a guy love you that much. He’s not going to suddenly bail on you. So Tony, today, you are going to get married. You’re going to get your happy ending. If anyone deserves today, it’s you.”
JARVIS was the one to alert Steve to the fact that Tony was out of surgery and being taken back to his room. Steve said his goodbyes and raced back to medical so that he could be at Tony's side. He thanked the doctors profusely for helping Tony and then sat down at his fiancé’s side and just held his hand. Tony’s face was absolutely swathed in bandages that had tinges of blood around the edges. He was glad that Tony was still asleep because he knew that if Tony was awake that he’d be in pain despite the pain meds he was on.
Tony had always considered his voice and ability to use it to manipulate situations one of his greatest powers. Right next to his intelligence. Now he didn’t have that. No more talking. No more loud laughter. No more saying simple things such as “I love you”. That really hurt.
“Right with you baby.” Sighed Steve as he bit down on Tony’s shoulder.
asked Tony as he got comfortable in Steve’s arms. They were so close their noses were touching.
So when Tony was about to go into heat six months after the other Avengers moved into the tower, and Steve offered to help, Tony didn’t say no. After all, Steve was being a gentleman and Tony wasn’t going to pass up on this opportunity. Maybe he was a masochist.
A week later, when Tony was finally released from medical, Tony and Steve sat down on Tony’s bed and had a long talk about what was going on and how they should move forward. They decided to take it slow, but that was mostly for Tony’s benefit because he was going to be laid up for a while yet. Their dates consisted of Steve making various snacks and the two lounging around watching various movies in an attempt to continue to get Steve acclimated to the future. Things were great.
The picture Steve posted was a recent one. There were still some bandages on Tony’s face but they were mostly hidden by the way Tony's face was laying on Steve’s chest. Plus the photo was taken by Natasha one night from the doorway to Tony’s room. She had seen the two sleeping together and couldn’t help but take the picture and send it to Steve. It was sweet and Tony looked so peaceful. Probably the most at peace he could be while still in medical and attached to machines.
Now, Steve was aware of Tony’s self-esteem issues that stemmed from his childhood living under Howard Starks rule. But what Steve wasn’t aware of was that Tony felt he had to work to be useful to the team. But thinking back, Steve was pretty sure he knew exactly where that came from. Iron Man: Yes. Tony Stark: Not Recommended. He was going to have to talk to Natasha about that.
Two weeks later they finally got that much-needed vacation.
Tony missed moments like this.
“Tony? Hey… Tony.” Worried Steve and everyone else around him did the same.
“Can we… Can we talk?” asked Tony and Steve nodded and let him into the room.
signed Tony with a smile. His eye was a little watery as he welled up with emotions.
“Please. Please don’t do this.” Whispered Steve as he placed a hand over Tony’s reactor. He’d removed his right glove so the colours were showing. “Please. We only just met. Please.”
More angst? More angst. I told you at the start that this would be one angsty motherfucker. So, strap in and enjoy the ride. -Shadows
Tony allowed Steve to wheel him out of medical without so much as a small protest. His knee was still healing and he couldn’t quite walk on it yet, but Tony didn’t care. He was going to be able to sleep in his own bed for the first time in months! He was going to be able to see his bots! He was going to be able to spend time with the team again. He hadn’t seen them much since his accident because they’d been busy running damage control, but he did see them. Tony missed team movie nights.
So, Steve just sat there and held Tony’s hand in his. He thanked the universe that the love of his life hadn’t died in that explosion. They could deal with everything else together, but Steve knew that it would irreparably shatter him if he were to lose Tony.
And that’s when he realized that he had fallen for Tony Stark.
“Why, you wanna get a tattoo?”
Not being able to talk was not something Tony liked. And sure, he’d been going over that with his therapist, but it was still hard. He’d spent his entire life using his words like a shield. Now they were gone. He used to be able to see. He used to see universes and their infinite possibilities. Now Tony only saw blurry visions of what once was. He had to wear glasses now. He was covered in scars and was pushing the wrong side of 40.
“It was the only way. The Security Council was going to nuke New York and nobody else could take it through the portal.”
“Well, I’d never danced with such a pretty fella before.”
Steve took Tony’s chin in his hand and brought his lover into a kiss. His hands began to wander over Tony’s body and Tony enjoyed the sensations of Steve pleasuring him. Very quickly, Steve’s hands found their way to Tony’s pants. He quickly undid Tony’s belt and threw it across the room. Steve ripped open the button and was quick to shove his hands down Tony’s pants to grip at his ass. Tony ground back against him and Steve smiled.
“Yeah right. I never knew that you were capable of lying Captain. Now. If you’ll excuse me, I need to get out of here and back to work.” Grimaced Tony as he started to tear off some of the lines and other medical things attached to his body. Not only that but Toby sat up quite quickly and Steve could very clearly tell that that was a bad idea by the pain the flicked across Tony’s face.
Steve and Rhodey instantly raced to Tony’s side. Rhodey just plonked himself down in a chair and sighed as he watched his oldest friend laying in the bed before him. He slowly took his own seat and reached out gingerly to take Tony’s right hand. His own hands were shaking and it felt like all at once, everything came crashing down.
Steve nodded through the tears in his eyes and Rhodey voiced his wishes to see Tony. So, the two got up and followed the doctor around the corner to Tony’s room.
“No! NO! TONY! STAY AWAKE! PLEASE! Please… Please stay awake…”
“Now. I’m sure that you have some questions So I’ll cut right to the chase. I know how you prefer bluntness.” Continued the doctor. Tony noticed that Steve began to grip his hand tighter. Something was really off about this.
But for once, luck was on Tony’s side. Neither knew what happened, but after the kiss, Tony’s heart started again and Tony was shaken awake by a coughing fit. Steve all but shouted in joy as he helped Tony sit up to relieve the pressure on his chest.
“He’s fine Tony. He’s beautiful. He’s just down for a nap. It’s you I’m worried about.” fretted Steve and Tony was left more confused.
Steve was a small storm as he ran around the room gathering the things that they may need before he was yelling at JARVIS to wake up Natasha so that she could drive them to the hospital. Once Natasha responded, Steve scooped Tony into his arms and carried him to the waiting car where Natasha would meet them.
“Yup. Everything’s hunky-dory. Now, when can I get out of here?” asked Tony as he tried to move and only succeeded in barely suppressing a wince that Steve absolutely saw.
Almost two months after Tony’s accident, he was finally allowed to leave medical and return to his and Steve’s room. That small amount of freedom meant the world to Tony. He was no longer confined to the four white walls of his room. No longer surrounded by machines making sure he was still breathing. No longer suffocated by the scent of rubbing alcohol. He was free.
“Tony! Tony?” shouted Steve as he entered the basement area.
Most of the time Tony had to fight down a blush when the good Captain talked to him when they were alone in the lab. Tony was really confused about the situation. Steve hated him! Why was he so determined to spend time with Tony in the lab? Did he want something? Why didn’t he just ask Tony for whatever he wanted and be done with it? Normally Tony would have confronted Steve about this, but he was just so sick and tired of being alone in his lab that he welcomed the contact.
But with better health and longer periods of wakefulness came Tony having to confront what had happened to him In one bad explosion Tony had lost an eye and his voice. His face and neck were now covered in scars. His other eye had been damaged a little bit so he’d need glasses now. And yes, Tony could still communicate with ASL or writing, but he couldn’t talk.
“No! Don’t you dare! I just got you!” screamed Steve as the connection died and Tony flew through the portal.
“I think you already know.” Smiled back, Steve.
“I need a med evac to my location right now! Tony’s down! I need medical!” shouted Steve as he checked to make sure Tony was still alive.
The location wasn’t going to help either.
The next day they had an Avengers call out that left them both exhausted and Tony with a few nasty cuts. Steve worried and Tony assured him he was fine. The rest of the week followed in a similar fashion. Most weeks did. But, no matter what shit went down, they always had their date night to look forward to.
“I think that’s a great idea. The two of us coming together. We could add accents of purple to play into that.”
“And I love you Shellhead. Please. Please save your strength. You’re gonna be fine. I… I…” Steve’s voice shook as he talked. He could see Tony’s eyes beginning to droop and he began to panic further.
“You’re doing so well Sweetheart. Just hang in there.” soothed Steve once Tony had been situated in his hospital bed and had been checked over by the doctors and nurses. He was progressing pretty fast and they were pretty sure that the baby would be there by morning.
“It was Howard and Stane. They did… they did bad things. S’why I’m fucked up.”
Tony was jittery that morning. How could he not? This wasn’t what he’d imagined when Steve proposed. So much had changed since the accident. So much but yet so little. He’d been pacing back and forth for over an hour after he’d gotten dressed in his new suit. He was wearing a black suit with a red vest underneath and a gold pocket square and tie. He looked immaculate.
The two sat in silence side by side for a moment before Steve spoke up to ask Tony a question.
“Mr. Stark, you were injured quite badly. Because of the blast, you have a small fracture to your right knee cap that will heal with time. As well, your right eye was badly damaged. We won’t know if you retained any vision until the bone there has healed and we can remove the bandages.
His heat was absolutely amazing. Steve had been attentive and caring. Tony had never felt so good during his heat before. For the first time ever, Tony felt safe and satisfied. It was an amazing feeling.
The two set over an hour just talking and eating. It wasn’t often they got so much uninterrupted time to themselves so they took advantage of it. They shared stories of their day and laughed about how awkward it was in training with Steve being the leader of the team but Rhodey being a much higher military rank even though Steve was army and Rhodey was air force.
“And I love you, Steve. I’d be a wreck without you. How the hell did I get so lucky?”
Signed Tony and the others shared a few confused looks
Steve was the one to carry Tony back to their room. Sure, he could have used the chair but Steve wanted to carry his love. Plus he loved how Tony blushed in his arms. When they got to their room, Steve helped Tony undress and get into some nice, soft pyjamas before he began undressing himself for bed.
Tony quickly paid the bill and soon enough the two were zooming back to the tower. It felt like they couldn’t get there quick enough. Steve may have broken a few traffic laws, but they arrived back at the tower quickly and the second the bike was parked, the two were racing to the elevator and making out like teenagers.
“You know damn well why so back off!” shouted back Steve. As he turned to look angrily at Tony.
“Hey, hey doll, just breathe. That’s it. Just breathe.” soothed Steve as he tried his best to keep Tony calm as they sped off towards the hospital.
You could have heard a pin drop in that room if it weren’t for the various beeping noises coming from the machines that surrounded Tony’s bed. Both Steve and Tony sat there in shock over Steve’s words. Steve, because he hadn’t expected himself to just blurt that out. Tony because he had been so certain that Steve hated him and that his crush on the soldier would never be reciprocated.
“Yeah, Tones. It’s just not the same without you here. Who else am I supposed to talk science with? I’ve only got you and Bruce.” Smiled Rhodey as he gave his oldest friend a hug.
“No! Tony! Stay awake!” worried Steve as he fought to keep Tony’s attention. “Tell me something. Anything. What are you working on right now?”
“Hell no!” snarked Tony as he polished off his coffee and leaned into his partner's side.
In return, Tony told Steve about what happened in the bunker in Sokovia and what he’d seen. Steve managed to talk Tony down from his panic and his idea to relaunch the Ultron Project. They also worked together to take down the Maximoff twins. Apparently, they had a misplaced vendetta against Tony and neither could really be reasoned with. The new SHIELD were in charge of keeping them contained.
The second they landed medical personnel were there to cart Tony off to go get x-rayed and into surgery as soon as possible. Steve wanted to go with Tony, but he wasn’t allowed. All he could do was shed his uniform, shower, eat something, and wait in the plush chairs that Tony had put outside of Avengers Medical.
Signed Tony as he shook like crazy at Steve’s side. If Tony were still a kid, Howard would have called him weak and beat his ass for asking to see a therapist. But Tony knew he needed help. Steve showed him that it was ok to ask for help and Steve’s opinion mattered more than Howard’s. Howard was dead. Steve was here with him now showering him with love.
“God… Steve.” Whined Tony. Steve was not small by any means. While the serum may have enhanced everything about him, it hadn’t done anything to his dick. That was all him.
It only took Tony a week to figure out a tattoo ink that wouldn’t be eaten up by Steve’s serum. Now, Tony wasn’t a biologist by any means, but he did have a doctorate in chemistry. So he enlisted Bruce’s help and quickly, the two of them had made Steve safe tattoo ink in multiple colours.
And Steve held up that promise. A week later Steve came back home with a galaxy of different coloured stars swimming across his shoulder blades. Each star was a different colour and represented a different member of the team. Everyone had some fun trying to figure out which star belonged to who. Although the red and gold star that sat in the center over Steve’s spine was quite obvious. Tony loved tracing the stars while they laid in bed together after a long day.
And they deserved it.
Steve was a bit nervous while Tony was in surgery. So were the other Avengers. They didn’t like it when one of their teammates was down. But they knew that Tony would be fine and would probably act like a little bitch while he was healing.
What Tony said next though shook Steve to his core.
“Are you sure? I don’t want to say too much.” Worried Steve.
“What’s going on in that head of yours Tony?” asked Steve as he used a free hand to tilt up Tony’s chin so that they could look at each other. Tony’s eyes were swimming with tears and it broke Steve’s heart.
The few grunts and groans that Tony could make he did make as Steve took him apart with just his fingers. And one Tony was a puddle beneath him, Steve had Tony coming on his cock while he whispered all the dirty thing that he was going to do to Tony on their wedding night. He didn’t even have to touch Tony to have him coming undone.
It would be a long time before Tony was anywhere ok again, but that was alright. Steve was there to help. He was there to remind Tony that he was good and deserved his love. That he deserved this family they’d made. But, years later, Tony was finally happy. He had a mate who loved him and an amazing kid. He was happy.
The other Avengers took care of Loki while Steve helped Tony onto the jet sent for them and onto the carrier where medical was waiting. Despite their earlier arguments, Steve didn’t leave Tony’s side. They were soulmates. Their bond was special. He wasn’t going to just up and leave.
“Well, you’ve been working so hard lately I thought you deserved a little treat.” Smiled Steve and Tony made his way over to sit at Steve’s side.
“Oh, I’ll definitely say so.” Smirked Steve as he rolled Tony underneath him.
“Tony, just chill. I know for a fact that Steve is crazy about you. Just calm down.” Stressed Rhodey after having watched Tony pace and fidget got over half an hour.
For once in their lives, everything seemed to be perfect. There hadn’t been a callout in a few months, SI’s stocks were doing amazing, They were happy. Neither Tony nor Steve could ever remember being this happy.
Over the next month, Tony and Steve entered into the stress that was planning their wedding. While they agreed on things such as desert and what to wear, they had some minor disagreements on other things such as the venue. While Steve wanted to have their wedding in Brooklyn, Tony was more for celebrating upstate in a nice field, probably at the compound. But, they had plenty of time to figure it all out. They hadn’t set a date yet so they weren’t worried.
The two shed silent tears of joy as they slid their wedding rings onto the other’s hand. They were a matching set. Simple gold rings with each other’s names inscribed on the inside. They cried as Sam finished his bit and pronounced them husband and husband.
The two fell asleep in each other's arms until Harley woke up demanding food.
Sam walked up to the front where they were all standing. He was going to be the one to officiate. Steve had asked him personally and Sam couldn’t say no to one of his best friends. So, Sam went out and got ordained just for the occasion.
“Hi, Steve.” Spoke Sam as he stood next to Steve.
“Oh.”
Signed back Tony.
“It was Howard.” Whispered Tony, breaking the silence.
“I love you. I’ve loved you for months. Tony… I love you.”
Tony seemed pretty out of it when Steve entered the room. He was hooked up to a few machines that Steve didn’t know the purpose of and the bed seemed to make the man look even smaller than he was. His leg was carefully padded with gauze and bandages but Steve could see the small parts of the metal frame sticking out. But still, Tony was alive and Steve was grateful.
Steve made sure he made good on his promise.
They sat in silence for a few moments with only the beeping of machines and each other’s heartbeats for company. While sitting there in Steve’s arms, Tony thought long and hard about what he should do. He knew that he was feeling like shit and that feeling had been building for a long, long time. Tony had dealt with mental health problems since he was a kid being kidnapped and beat on a regular basis. Then there was Stane and the drinking and drugs and gaslighting. Then Afghanistan and Loki and AIM. Honestly, Tony needed help. Help that he knew that Steve couldn’t always give him even though he tried. Now, Tony didn’t want to admit any weakness, but he knew when to throw in the towel. He needed help, plain and simple.
He quickly gathered all the bugs and tech that they’d put up, thanked the owner for his cooperation and left to go meet Tony back at the tower. Steve may or may not have broken some traffic laws getting back. He parked his bike in the garage and ran up the stairs to his and Tony’s room without even breaking a sweat. He didn’t have the patience to wait for the elevator. By the time Steve arrived in their room Tony was already there getting undressed from the mission. He’d gotten to leave a little earlier with the other performers as to not arouse suspicion.
Starting therapy did wonders for Tony’s mental health once he got over his self-imposed barriers. There was a definite improvement to Tony’s mood now that he was figuring out his feelings over everything that had happened to him. But it was still slow going.
They worked well together to fix the turbine. There was no doubt that they would. Soulmates were made to be the perfect match to each other. Of course, they were able to work well together. But that didn’t stop Coulson from dying. That didn’t stop Tony from grieving and figuring out Loki’s plan. That didn’t stop Tony from flying off to the tower to try and get a jump on him. That didn’t stop the portal from opening and all hell breaking loose.
“Why?” asked Tony and more tears fell from Steve’s eyes.
But Steve kept digging and what he saw wasn’t the same man that he’d read about from Fury and Natasha. He saw a man who cared deeply but covered it up. He saw a man who had to grow up too quickly. He saw a man who just wanted to do better. And Steve liked what he saw.
If anyone had asked Tony when he was a teenager how he thought his life would turn out, He would have said something along the lines of “I’ll probably be dead in a ditch somewhere.”
“Somebody’s excited.” Smirked Steve as he pulled one of his hands away to grab a tube of lube that was stashed away in the side table drawer that adjacent to the couch they were on. Tony and Steve had lube stashed away all over their floor of the tower. It came in handy to have some close by.
“Well, I think we need to get one.” Cooed Steve as he reached down and groped Tony’s ass.
“Stop this Tony. Stop. You’re going to get yourself hurt worse than you already are!” worried Steve as he stood up to keep Tony from leaving his bed.
“Wait! So you went and did exactly what I told you not to do and created an alternate timeline? Really Cap?” complained Bruce but Steve just smiled back.
Steve eventually had to get up to grab the lube out of the suitcase. But, when Steve turned back around to start prepping his husband he saw Tony laying on his arms with his ass on display. Tony looked back at Steve with a wink and Steve very quickly got the memo. He kneeled behind his love and brought his hands up to massage at Tony’s cheeks. His ass was so plush and amazing. Steve could stay buried there and be happy for the rest of his life.
After some pictures, it was time for the reception. In classic Tony Stark fashion, the reception was a full-out party. There was plenty of food and treats and the drinks flowed freely for those who chose to drink. Toasts were made with both Rhodey and Bucky making plenty of jokes about Tony and Steve. All in good fun of course.
Tony didn’t know whether to hit Steve or kiss him for that terrible joke. Instead, he just opted to kiss him. Before Tony knew it, Steve had carried him over to the bed and nestled him in the sheets while he reached over and grabbed the tube of lube from the bedside table. That was another thing Tony loved about Steve. Tony was used to having to be the strong one in the relationship. Here, he didn’t have to. Tony had no clue he had a strength kink until he met Steve.
“Tony, doll. Of course, Harley is yours. He’s both of ours.” soothed Steve as he went to go set Harley back down in his bassinet.
But now he was on the road to healing. And Steve was right there. Right at his side offering the support Tony needed and craved.
It was six days before the doctors took Tony off of the sedation. Six days filled with worry. Six days were Steve didn’t leave Tony’s side. He had his friends bring him things he’d need when he needed them when they came to check in on Tony. But Steve? He didn’t leave his Tony. He pretty much lived in medical. The only time he left was to go shower.
“Alright, tell me about that. Just keep talking.” Encouraged Steve.
Tony instantly began to panic. He couldn’t hold the baby! No! He couldn’t do that. He couldn’t grow attached. He couldn’t expose himself to such an innocent life. Tony’s hands began shaking as he crossed his arms and moved to the back of the bed to get away from Steve’s outstretched arms.
“I’m happy for you. Truly. The only thing bumming me out is I have to live in a world without Captain America.”
“You look… really different sweetheart.” Spoke Steve as he saw Tony step out of their room wearing what he’d be performing in that night. Tony had some street clothes set to the side but was only wearing a gold pair of booty shorts that really left nothing to the imagination.
Steve brought out the best in Tony and Tony brought out the best in Steve.
Steve sat there in shock as he let Tony’s words wash over him. Steve had always hated the fact that Tony thought so little of himself. The world had been so cruel to his beloved. Tony had endured too much and Steve wished that he could take away all the hurt. All the insecurities. He needed Tony to know how loved he really was.
They cried as their friends cheered as they shared their first kiss as a married couple.
“I need back up to my location right now!” shouted Tony into the coms as he had JARVIS envelope the bomb with the suit to help contain the blast.
But on the other hand, Tony was terrified. He was terrified because he and Steve weren’t even together. He was terrified because he didn’t even know if Steve wanted a baby. This, this was life-changing. This was a big deal and Tony didn’t know what to do. Well, Tony knew that he had to tell Steve. It would be pretty impossible to keep a baby secret. So, by some miracle, Tony bucked up the courage to go knock on Steve’s bedroom door.
The bomb sitting in the corner of the room was tiny. Very tiny, but Tony still knew that it could do a lot of damage. But, because it was so small and finicky, Tony knew he wouldn’t have the dexterity needed to disarm it. So, Tony made the decision to leave his suit.
“Stark? You alright?” asked Fury drawing everyone’s attention onto Tony. And that was when they saw the colours.
So armed with this new knowledge, Steve began to put in the effort to make Tony feel more comfortable in his own damn home. Steve would go out of his way to talk to Tony when he saw him. He asked about his work and his inventions. And it wasn’t just a plot for anything. Steve was genuinely curious. Technology had advanced so much since he’d gone into the ice and he wanted to learn everything.
Steve got extremely touchy towards the end of Tony’s pregnancy. He was always holding Tony close and giving him little kisses. It made Tony’s heartache to know that he couldn’t keep this. He couldn’t keep Steve. He couldn’t keep the baby. Tony was bad. He wasn’t a good Omega. He couldn’t keep nice things. The thought of losing all of this kept Tony up most nights as he tried to keep the tears from his eyes.
Their own little slice of paradise.
“What’s all this?” asked Tony as he entered the room to see Steve sitting on an old blanket.
Steve hardly noticed when the other Avengers arrived on the scene and began to panic in their own right. Rhodey had tears in his own eyes as he plonked down at Tony’s other side and relayed information to Bruce who was outside waiting for the medical crew.
Tony had given up long ago on ever meeting his soulmate. Most people found theirs as kids or young adults. Tony was 42 and still all alone. When Tony was a child he would watch everyone go past with the rainbows colouring their skin wishing that it would someday happen to him. That his soulmate would touch him for the first time, skin to skin, and where they touched would light up in colour. But Tony was a Stark. He knew a happy ending wasn’t in the cards for him. Not when he didn’t even get a happy start.
“I’m here because I’m your teammate and I care about you.” Spoke Steve very steadily. Tony just glared back at him.
Moments later Tony was cumming around with a loud moan that triggered Steve’s orgasm. The two collapsed into each other's arms. They were breathing heavily and just holding each other close while trading little kisses. At that moment, the only that in the world that mattered was each other.
And it felt amazing.
It wasn’t long after that that the anesthesia took hold and Tony was being wheeled off to surgery. Steve had a few tears in his eyes as he watched Tony go.
“Fuck Sweet Heart. You like it when I touch you there? Love hearing how loud you are.” Moaned Steve as he removed his fingers and began lubing up his cock.
Steve didn’t stop screaming and pleading as Natasha closed the portal. His heart nearly stopped as he saw Tony fall through it. He nearly cried as Hulk caught him but did cry when he pulled Tony’s faceplate off and noticed that the arc reactor was dead and he wasn’t breathing.
Tony came back to consciousness quite quickly. It was the pain that woke him up. It felt like his face and throat were on fire. That was one red flag in the multitude that were quickly springing up. Tony knew that something was very, very wrong.
As the doctors and nurses took Tony off of the sedation they warned Steve that it may take a little while for Tony to come around and that once he did he would be very disoriented with everything that had happened. Steve promised to call them one Tony woke up for more than a minute. They all left the room Steve was right back at Tony’s side. Right where he belonged.
“Hi, Sam.” Spoke Steve, his voice lower and slower than it had been just seconds ago. But that’s what living an entire lifetime does to the body.
Tony went into labour in the middle of the night. He’d been feeling uncomfortable the entire day and he’d reached his breaking point around midnight when it finally clicked in for him that he was in labour.
Tony smiled at Steve when he arrived at the alter. Rhodey gave Tony a hug and Steve a pat on the shoulder before he went to stand next to Bucky. This was it! They were finally getting married. After so long they were finally able to bind their souls together.
All too soon Steve found himself staring down the all too bright and clear corridor leading to Tony’s room in Avengers Medical. He didn’t know what he was going to say but he knew he had to do something. So, Steve walked over to Tony’s room, knocked on the door, and entered.
Luckily, the others arrived soon after and were also fussing over Tony. Bruce was quick to check Tony over and assess the situation while Clint and Natasha cleaned up the broken fragments of suit that lay strewn about. They didn’t need the Iron Man armour getting into the wrong hands. Steve started at Tony’s side and helped where he could.
“It’s a surprise.” Smiled Steve as he got dressed in his usual attire.
“We need a vacation.” Sighed Tony as he rested his head on Steve’s chest.
The most Tony could ever let out were some painful little grunts that made him shut up pretty quick.
But that didn’t really explain why Tony never really socialized with the rest of the team. Sure he’d come around every so often to make jokes and grab a bite to eat, but he never stuck around for too long. Even Bruce spent more time with the team than Tony did. Bruce made it to every team dinner and team bonding night. Tony seldom appeared. Like, he did show up, but it wasn’t often.
“I’m sorry Tony. I’m so, so sorry.” Cried Steve and a few tears fell from Tony’s eye in response.
“Tony,” started Steve as he smiled. He couldn’t keep the smile off his face nor the tears of joy from his eyes. “I love you so much. You make everything brighter. You’re my shining star. You’re my home. Tony Stark you mean everything to me. I’ve never met a man like you. Hell, I’ve never met a man who made me feel the way I do about you. You’ve been through so much and yet you’re still here. My shining star. I love you Tony Stark. I will always love you.”
“It was… it was beautiful.”
“You know I’ll never say no to dancing with you. And to think you were once nervous about dancing with me.” Smiled back Tony as Steve took him into his arms.
“You’re… you’re hurt pretty bad Sweetheart. Just… just don’t move too much, ok. I’ll go call the doctor.” Worried Steve as he reached over and pushed the call button on the side of Tony’s bed.  Seconds later the doctor was there along with a few nurses who quickly made sure that Tony got the medication he needed. Thank fuck for nurses.
So, Steve pulled back from Tony, knelt down on one knee, and pulled a sparkling gold ring with a single sapphire out of his pocket and held it up to Tony.
It was a small wedding but it was what they’d wanted.
The building was still standing when they arrived and Steve took a mad dash to the basement to find Tony while Rhodey scanned the area for threats before tailing quickly behind him.
Steve crawled onto the bed and pulled Tony into his arms. The Omega bawled even harder and Steve rocked him back and forth. Steve felt lost for words as he held Tony in his arms. Where had he gone so wrong? What had he done to make Tony so upset that he was scared to hold his own baby for fear of getting attached? TO HIS OWN BABY!
It just felt so… unbelievable that Tony was gone. There was still so much left unsaid. So much Steve had to apologize for. So much he still wanted to do with the genius. And now? Now Tony was gone. He’d sacrificed himself for the universe, for the Avengers, for Pepper and his children. He was gone and no matter how much Steve prayed, he knew his genius was never coming back.
“That’s the plan.”
So it was really nobody’s surprise when not even a week later Steve found Tony down in his lab sitting at his workbench surrounded by wires and screws. But there was something off about Tony that day. His shoulders were slumped and he just looked lost. It wasn’t like him and Steve was worried.
He started by asking JARVIS to scan him and finished with a pregnancy test. Tony had absolutely no idea what to do as he looked down at the little pink plus sign. There were tears in his eyes as he thought about the implications of what had just happened. Apparently, super soldier sperm was stronger than condoms.
“Nah, just go with Rogers. It sounds better anyway,” said Tony and Steve looked away from him.
There wasn’t much talking as the two lovers took their pleasure from each other. The sound of skin against skin reverberated throughout the room as the two kissed loudly. Hands wandered and hickies formed on necks as Steve’s thrusts spread up. They were both so pent up that that they knew this wouldn’t last long.
“Well, I’ve sort of been wanting some tattoos for a while and if anyone can make an ink that will work in my it’s you.” Smiled Steve and Tony blushed a bit.
“Some of the older board members refuse to see reason. They keep asking me when I’m going to start making weapons again. They refuse to see that green energy and robotics are the future. I’m so sick of trying to work with people who don’t have two brain cells to rub together.”
Tony generally looked happy to explain things to Steve and Steve listened intently. But after a while, Steve began to focus on other things. Things such as the shape of Tony’s lips. How big and round his eyes were. How Tony blushed just a little bit whenever Steve asked him things.
“Whatcha thinking ‘bout doll? Asked Steve as they lay in bed together. They’d been married for three months now and things were finally starting to get back to some semblance of normal. Well, normal for them.
The next day news of Tony’s injuries had spread all over the news. SI’s stocks took a bit of a hit at the news but that had been expected. But what Tony hadn’t been expecting was the massive outpouring of support. People were sympathetic to Tony’s new situation and a surprising amount of donations had been made to the Maria Stark Foundation in the wake of Tony’s speech. Sure, there were people calling Tony all sorts of horrible things, but the majority of people were good. They called Tony a hero and praised his work. That never happened!
Steve wasted no time in fingering his husband open. Tony moved along with his fingers and breathed heavily. Steve knew just the right way to make Tony’s nerves light on fire.
“God Tony. Please, please don’t leave me.” Cried Tony as he carefully held Tony’s hand in his.
“Not even a little one?” pouted Tony and all Steve did was kiss the pout from his face.
They had a long conversation between the four of them. There were even some tears. But eventually, they were able to get through to Tony and convince him to go see his therapist. She was a damn good therapist and Tony had been doing well with her. They just hoped that she could help with his before the wedding.
“It’s just… I don’t think I can stay here. I know that creating an alternate timeline is dangerous but these past five years… it’s all been too much. And now after losing Tony and Nat… I just…”
Now that Tony was on the mend and healing, it was time to jump back into planning his and Steve’s wedding. Planning a wedding wasn’t easy so Tony and Steve relied on their friends for help. There were so many little details to keep track of. The only easy bit had been the guest list and what Tony and Steve were going to wear. Steve had dug his old military uniform out of storage for their big day while Tony had gotten a new suit custom-tailored for the event.
After that news came out, Steve began to hover around Tony… a lot. Where Tony was, Steve was often seen tailing close behind. Steve even moved into Tony’s room. That was when the comments started surrounding their relationship. Tony knew in his heart that there was no relationship there. Steve just wanted to be close to protect the baby. It was in his instincts.
He didn’t have to be alone. Not anymore.
Instead of sitting around, Steve went to go find the other Avengers. He needed to just talk to somebody about something else other than Tony being sick. He ended up finding Sam and Bucky working out together in the gym. They gladly offered Steve a distraction and a snack.
And then SHIELD fell and Steve had his eyes opened. He looked inside himself and tried to figure out how to adapt. And then Steve got to know Tony better. Sure, they’d fought when they’d first met, but now Steve couldn’t see his life without Tony in it. Tony was his light in the dark. He was… he was amazing. He’d been through so much and yet he was still so strong. It was hard not to fall in love once he got to know Tony.
“Roger that” smirked Tony as he got out of the suit and began his work.
As Steve got closer, Tony opened his eye and looked up at Steve. He coughed and a small trickle of blood rolled off of his lips.
“Hey sweetheart, stay with me. You’ll be alright. You’ll be alright.” Worried Steve, although the more he talked the words that Steve spoke seemed to be more to reassure himself and not Tony.
As Steve got closer to Tony’s location he could clearly see the trail of destruction left by the bomb. They were so lucky that they were poorly made and didn’t have much firepower. Steve picked up his pace once he saw a few pieces of the Iron Man armour strewn about. Tony must have used the armour to protect himself when the bomb went off. So Steve picked up his pace and shouted once he saw Tony laying in the middle of the floor in an office space. There were broken tables and chairs everywhere. But that wasn’t what caught Steve’s eye.
As Tony stood there in shock Steve began to see the colours on his own hand. And that caught him off guard. He looked over at Tony to see the man almost shaking, but from what emotion he did not know. It was hard to tell, well, until Tony spoke.
smiled Tony as he fell into Steve’s arms. Even though they had a king-sized bed they always slept curled up together.
