“Hey. Are you okay?” Tony nodded.
“Tony, I-“
They smiled at each other and Tony could feel his eyes getting wet. He took a deep breath and nodded towards her cup.
“So you see, if FRIDAY can be my daughter, so can you.”
He passed two of the shirts over to Steve and kept the third one for himself, sitting down on the bed again. After a moment of hesitation, he decided that there was no reason why he shouldn’t get comfortable, so he shrugged out of his pants as well and went in search of his sweatpants that he knew should be somewhere around. He found them, just in time to turn around and see Steve press a soft kiss onto Bucky’s shoulder. He could see them talk in low voices, but he wasn’t focusing enough to understand, and it wasn’t important anyway. Not right now.
Oh. “Oh.” That was unexpected. But good, obviously. “Yes! Yes please.” Steve smiled, nodded. He leaned in for another quick kiss, but then he turned away and got to work on the food again. He asked a couple of quiet questions while he set the table, mostly about where stuff was (including a candle, because Steve was apparently a romantic), but otherwise they didn’t talk much.
“Hey Bucky?”
“Don’t worry, she does not like you any less just because she likes someone else as well.” Usually, Tony would have tried to make a joke, but he wasn’t sure how Bucky would take it and this was actually important. It was something that Tony had had to learn as well. Bucky nodded again.
“Oookay. What’s going on?” Tony took a deep breath, let it out slowly.
“Steve-“ Tony had no idea what to say, even after all this years. He’d known Steve had his reasons; he’d known for years now that Barnes was not to blame. He understood Steve’s actions, even if he didn’t like them. But-
“Be right back,” he said, already opening the door to the bathroom, thinking. A bath, obviously, something with bubbles, because those were always fun. They had all seen each other naked before, of course, with them working as a team for a while. But this was different. Not bad, but not something they should rush. They had time, now. For real. So bubbles and colored water it was.
“I told him. I told both of them, I had to.”
“I-“ He broke off again, overwhelmed.
“Don’t worry, it’s okay. I just- I wanted you to know, I guess. That I see you.” Tony swallowed, nodded.
“Yeah. Really, I’m okay Tony.”
“It was my idea,” he said, almost whispered, as if he was afraid of- of what exactly? Punishment? Holy fuck, yeah that talk needed to happen soon.
“He’s going to try and save Natasha,” he said, not at all surprised by her gasp, the way her eyes were suddenly wide. Hopeful. Natasha and Pepper had had a thing going on almost before Tony and Pepper got it together, that first time. They worked, the two of them and Tony was eternally grateful that Pepper had chosen to stay with him, to let herself be shared, because there was no way he would win against Natasha. He had been a mess, for big parts of their relationship.
“Are you alright?” Rhodey asked, as he joined Tony on the couch, where he was watching the kids trying to stop a zombie invasion. He smiled.
They fell into a rhythm, somehow. Natasha spent most of her time with Clint and his family; but came over so often that it never really felt like she left. Wilson picked up the shield and went to train the new Avengers (which meant mainly Peter. Who still hadn’t come to see Tony, now that he thought about it. He’d known that Peter was with his aunt when he woke up, which made sense, but still, he had kinda expected to see him at some point. Hmm, that might need some investigation). Bucky seemed to be torn between following Wilson and staying with Steve, which meant that he was kinda all over the place for the moment. And Steve- Steve just didn’t leave. Tony knew that he had had a long and very throughout conversation with Pepper at some point, which had seemed to settle him some, because after that he just kinda moved in. The house was not a mansion, not a tower, but still big enough that they had more guestrooms than they knew what to do with. At least, until the team decided to spend so much time here, of course. Which meant that one of the guestrooms was now Steve’s room.
“Yeah, they’re baking cupcakes, which is a great way to occupy Morgan.” He hesitated, then added: “I talked to Bucky.”
“You’re not joining them either,” Bucky said after a while. It wasn’t a question, but the way he said it didn’t make Tony feel judged. It was, well mostly an observation. A correct one, too.
Now Steve was sitting up as well, looking at Bucky with wide and worried eyes.
“No. Come today. I’ll text Happy if he has time, I’m sure he won’t mind driving you here. Okay?”
“Yeah. I was just- watching them, I guess. Remembering.”
“Hey sweetheart,” he said, smile still evident in his voice.
“Maybe. But he wouldn’t have been able to do so, if not for you. Not only because it’s your tech, although that too. But… we all need someone who believes in the best of us, and you always have. Even when we betrayed you, you always believed in us.”
“What is it, Bucky? What can’t you do? No one is gonna stop you, or judge you, not here.”
He got up, still holding Bucky’s hand.
Bucky nodded suddenly, as if only now remembering that he hadn’t given an answer.
“Okay. I, okay. You wanna do it now or wait until tomorrow?”
“Steve.”
“Yeah, it’s good to hear you, too. How are you doing? Everyone okay? We didn’t really get a chance to talk, since- well, you know.”
“Yeah.”
Soo, this is for K1 "asexuality" :)
“So, can I ask you a question? And please feel free to punch me in the face or something if it’s inappropriate.” Peter grinned.
“Drink your hot chocolate.”
“Yeah, me too. But you know, I think we’re allowed to feel old by now. The kids are alright.” Tony laughed.
“Talking about what?” Bucky asked.
Peter had apparently overcome his nervousness and was asking Nebula a thousand questions. She accepted her fate with good grace. Tony was pretty sure she was having fun, even, and his assessment seemed confirmed by the fond smile on Rhodey’s face.
“Will do.”
It took a couple of days for Tony to stop feeling off. He tried hard not to let Morgan notice, because she didn’t really know Steve and he had no idea how to explain this whole mess to her. But at the same time, he didn’t ever want to lie to her, so if she’d ask, he would have to find an answer. So far, she hadn’t.
“Maybe. But it sure feels that way.”
“Steve, leave it. Come on.” But Steve was shaking his head, frowning slightly.
“Have you seen Clint yet?” he asked after a moment, sitting down and falling over his food like a starving man. “Oh this is good, who made that?” Sam raised his arm, grinning. “You, you’re hired.” He pointed his fork in Sam’s direction, before turning back to Natasha. She shook his head. “What? Why not? But he knows, right? I mean…” He turned, looked at Steve, at her again. She shrugged. “You didn’t tell him.”
“Yeah, I’ll stay the night.”
Steve was still laying in the tub when Tony came back, eyes closed, small smile on his face. Tony was balancing a couple of bottles, a plate and some cupcakes in his hands, rolling his eyes when Steve looked at him and grinned.
“Come to bed, Bucky,” Steve said, and that was apparently what he had needed. A moment later, they were all in bed. Steve pressed a soft kiss into Tony’s hair, before he reached out and put his hand on Bucky shoulder. It was warm in the middle of two supersoldiers, but good. Safe. He turned his back to Steve, smiling when he snuggled closer and reached out for Bucky again. He found the prosthetic and curled his hands around it, ignoring Bucky’s questioning sound.
Tony Stark Bingo 2019, K3 It wasn't worth it
“No, you don’t.”
“Maybe. But you can and you deserve good things. Just as FRIDAY deserves to be loved. Just because she has no body, doesn’t mean she’s not my daughter. I made her. Also, she’s very much alive.”
The smell of coffee woke him up, hours later. It wasn’t dark outside anymore; in fact, the sun was shining bright and high. He could hear Morgan running around downstairs, yelling about some thing or another. Pepper was sitting on the bed next to him, a cup of coffee in her hand, a smile in her face.
“Does he know?”
“I mean, yeah. But- I can’t not wear it. It makes me feel really dysphoric, which means that I’d be basically useless. I can’t concentrate on saving people if all I can think about is how bad I feel, how much I want to be different, to be- well, it wouldn’t work. So it’s not like I really have a choice, to be honest.” Tony looked at him, the way he clearly felt uncomfortable with the mere thought of being Spiderman without his binder. That wouldn’t work, of course.
“Steve…”
This is a fill for K2 'Friday' :)
“That sounds like a good idea.”
“Tony, don’t, please.”
“Let me say it. It’s fine, you don’t- I just don’t wanna regret not saying it.”
Steve was leaning onto the car, smiling indulgently to whatever Wilson was saying. He didn’t seem to pay a lot of attention, his eyes fixed on Tony, arms opening up just a moment before Tony almost crashed into him. He stopped at the last second, remembering that Steve was hurt, but unable to keep away.
“That’s fine, too. You don’t have to know right now. The only think that you need to know is that you don’t have to leave. You can stay here, doing nothing, doing whatever you want, and take your time to figure it all out. We’ll be happy to have you around, Steve and I, and all of us. Morgan loves you.”
“Yeah. I’m good. I just- I just realized how happy I am, how lucky.” He smiled at his daughter, but he also reached out with one hand towards Steve and the other one towards Bucky.
“You need help?” Tony snorted.
“Slow down Tony, you shouldn’t push yourself too hard, yet,” she said, while contradicting herself and helping him to fully sit up and passing him a glass of water. Granted, it had a metal straw in it, but still, apparently, he was allowed to hold it all by himself. Yay for the little things. He took a sip, then just held the glass in his hands, setting it down in his lap.
“The princess is busy, more than enough. Can you… I wouldn’t mind you looking at it. I mean… I trust you.”
“Don’t thank me, Steve found her.” Clint shrugged.
“Nothing is ever perfect, you know that.” Pepper grinned.
This is the last one!! It's for A4 "Cinderella Story" on my TSB, which means that I now have a blackout card!! Yay ^^
This is for A1, "apology".
“Thank you,” he breathed, and for the first time in years, Tony was sure that everything would be okay.
“Don’t ask me to choose between my children, that’s not fair.” Rhodey called him a coward, but Peter and Nebula definitely seemed very happy with his announcement, so Tony counted that as a win. It was weird, being the center of their little universe, but this was also the happiest Tony had ever been, so Tony was definitely not complaining. It was perfect, being here, surrounded by his family.
Steve had pushed him into a chair with another glass of juice, telling him to look for some calm background music they could listen to during dinner. Usually Tony let FRIDAY chose the music, but now he spent a moment to scroll through spotify. There were a couple if “dinner playlists” with helpful titles like “Feel Good Dinner”, “Wine & Dine” or “Classical Intimate Dinner”, but all of those didn’t really feel right. He scrolled though a couple of his own favorites, briefly contemplating Aerosmith and finally settling on Eric Clapton. He was trying to decide between ‘Unplugged’ and ‘Riding with the King’. On one hand, Tears in Heaven might not be the best choice right now, but the rest of the album was amazing (scratch that, Tears in Heaven was amazing as well, just kinda sad, too). On the other hand, ‘Riding with the King’ was a bid groovier, which might work well. Also, the songs weren’t always interrupted by clapping. He could always switch to something else if it didn’t fit.
“You got a girl, Jimmy?”
“Tony said…” Steve starts, and realizes that he has no way to say this that doesn’t make him sound like an entitled, greedy ass. He sighs and moves his hands to his lap, fingers twisting together nervously.  “Tony said I could date you both. Love you both. Be with you both.”
But there is no message from Tony. Steve thinks back on their conversation from that afternoon, wondering if he’d maybe misunderstood, or is misremembering their plan. He’s pretty sure he’s correct.
It’s nice, having a full house. After a meal and a few drinks everyone laughs easy, smiles more. Bucky and Natasha melt toward each other in that way they always do, and Jan has relaxed enough that she’s stopped trying so hard to be outrageous. It’s comfortable, and cozy, and Perry Como croons from the kitchen radio. Steve catches himself wondering if this is how it could just
…” Steve’s fingers tighten in his hair as he thrusts into Tony’s warm mouth. Tony keeps his jaw loose and his throat open, but Steve doesn’t lose control. He goes fast and hard enough to make tears prick at the edges of Tony’s eyes, for him to breathe in sharply through his nose when he can’t quite get enough air, but Steve always backs off before it’s too much. Tony eventually manages to take him in deep, to bury his nose in the thatch of hair between Steve’s legs, the head of Steve’s cock nudging down the back of his throat.
“Would you like to dance, Steve?”  Pepper is asking, and Steve is blushing again, hand rubbing at the back of his neck in a gesture that’s becoming familiar, becoming Steve.
“This is because I won’t be a kept man?” Steve asks, confusion further deepening the furrow in his brow and his voice rising. “Because it’d be easier to stash me away up here like some illicit mistress?”
“Sorry, I just…” Tony seems to realize he’d taken liberties and moves to open the door again. Steve steps to Tony’s side and puts his hand against the door, leaving it closed.
“God, you…” Tony murmurs, dropping the hold on his wrist and reaching to touch the side of his face.  “You’re just so…why do you have to be…” Tony leans forward but doesn’t kiss him again, drifting in hesitation.  When he begins to draw further away Steve dips his head, making the decision for the both of them.
.” Steve gestures between their bodies, not quite able to say aloud that Tony wants him around simply because they’ve had unbelievably fantastic sex.
Tony’s kidding, spitefully glaring at the water as he shivers.  For a cold man, his skin is surprisingly flushed.
“We will need Steve’s talents!” Thor points out.
they could have Steve right now, and I have gotten nowhere!  The only thing I’ve managed to learn so far is that I thought Kazakhstan was spelled with an ‘I’ in the middle and it’s actually an ‘A’!  How
“Right now, a benefit. Though I’m half-surprised you didn’t try and walk down the mountain on your own. I’m very glad you’ve lowered the stubborn to a reasonable level.”
“We’d…share you?” Bucky sounds a little surprised, but he shifts closer on the couch, his metal arm unfurling across the length of its back. Steve’s not sure he likes the word
“Come on, Tony, time to get up. I let you sleep in late today because I know you were celebrating last night, but the reviews are in, and they are glowing! Time to capitalize on the good press. Strike while the iron is hot, as they say.”
Steve almost gets into the shower with the water ice cold, used to his and Bucky’s life of relative frugality. He has a foot in the tub before he reconsiders. The thought of the freezing water stinging his skin is unbearable; he wants comfort, not punishment. He could allow himself this, couldn’t he? Compared with the long list of sins he racked up last night, running up the hotel’s heating bill seems a rather small crime.
“I remember she was beautiful, like a movie star.  Even then.  She wore this red, red lipstick.  I remember her being kind, and I remember thinking she seemed sad, but I don’t remember what she did or why I thought that.”  He tosses back his shot.  “And I remember my parents fighting all night after she left.”
“Natasha was wrong about you.  When she concluded that Iron Man would be a valuable addition to the team, but Tony Stark wouldn’t?  She was wrong.”
The older he grew, the allure of the city dimmed.  Tony avoided it for many reasons – his father being chief among them while he was alive, and strangely even more so after his death – but even as Tony’s life became a whirlwind of globe-trotting business trips and decadent excursions, something inevitably pulled him back.  He yearned for New York even when it hurt to be there.  He could never refuse its call.
The patio door opens and they stop mid-fight.  Pepper stands there with her hand on her hip, backlit by the warm light from inside the house.
“Amazingly, yes.”
poster, afraid to make eye contact with anyone and encourage further speculation as to their identities.
“Tony, I really can’t.”
It’s not the same place.  It’s not the hangar of HYDRA’s base in the Alps.  The dimensions are different, the light is changed, and the details are off.  But it’s so close to the past that when he catches a flash of the woman’s dark brown hair out of the corner of his eye, for a second he thinks she’s Peggy.
“Because I said so.” Steve turns on his heel and walks in the opposite direction from Tony, around the corner of the house toward the back patio.
Clint reluctantly digs into his wallet and hands over a bill.  Darcy rolls it up and tucks it into her leopard-print bra.  That’s when Tony notices the small metal circle tag clasped to the center of the plunging v-neckline of her teal t-shirt, the purple clip-on button decorated with an ivy-twined white M.
being serious. Accept my offer? I’d like to see you again.”
Tony leans his forehead against Steve’s for a moment and they share the same air, letting a few quiet moments pass as they just breathe together.
But he just holds onto Steve more tightly, feeling the reassuring solidness of his body, and lets the wind whip by.
“It’s okay if you’re not sure, Tony. Or if it’s simply something you don’t want…”
?” Happy interjects.
“Damned if I know,” she replies as she lights a cigarette and tosses her gold-plated lighter onto her makeup table. She inhales and then slowly angles a cloud of smoke toward Tony's face. “You were saying, about the film? Is it rotten or no?”
“Feeling exposed enough, thanks,” Steve mumbles, drawing back.
“The fact that there is a drug out there designed to make super soldiers go haywire leaves me very uneasy,” he tells Pepper.  “JARVIS, bring up all we have on the serum and get in contact with SHIELD about rushing that information back from the mission.”
Tony also knows that he will have to face him eventually. He will have to go back to L.A. and deal with the movie. At some point. There's no avoiding that. At the very least, he's going to have to attend the premiere.
“A person can be more than one thing. Furthermore, the problem here isn’t my daddy issues. I’m well acquainted with those, Pepper and I have already had this talk regarding Steve.”
“Yeah.  Well.”  Tony avoids looking at him.  “Here you are in the gym again.”
Steve’s whole body is wound tightly again; the line of his back is tense and he’s unconsciously grinding his teeth in that way he does when he’s bottling up his feelings, holding back for fear of saying something wrong.
Barnes stands up, taking a few steps toward them, letting his metal hand trail along the edge of the counter.
we need to worry about, and everyone knows that Daddy’s the one who really holds the purse strings. I’m gonna hit that bastard where it hurts.”
“I was even going to take you to Serendipity for frozen hot chocolate afterward, so you could live that movie you inexplicably adore.”
He curls his hand around the edge of the sliding door to steady himself, fingertips digging uselessly into the hard metal frame.
Steve arches off the floor, stomach muscles seizing. He shoves his own wrist into his mouth and bites down.
It turns out that “just the place” is an automat on St. Mark’s called BAMN!  While it’s hardly a Horn & Hordart, Steve’s tickled pink that Tony found it and thought to bring him here.
“Steve doesn't know Loki either, far as I know, not that that's much. Pretty sure he knows his brother, though. Pretty good special effects guy—different last name—but he’s got some Norse first name too, I think. Thor?”
you hated me back then.” Bucky smirks, nodding his head back toward where Steve is safely ensconced indoors. “That punk never believed me.”
He stumbles off, unsure of where he’s going but knowing he can’t stay.
like you were.” Tony nods. “So how many times?”
“Just one question. Blame a curious mind. Was it me, or Steve, that got you all…hot and bothered over here? Or is that about someone else entirely.” He points downward and Peter blushes all over again. It’s not that Tony isn’t attractive, but he is older. Peter’s never had occasion to think of him like
“Am I mistaken in asking after her whereabouts?” Even Thor can’t miss the warning sign just given.
He turns in his seat and glances up toward the balcony. Bucky and Natasha are here, somewhere, having taken him up on his family tickets. If he could be up there with them to laugh over his performance, perhaps this night could be enjoyable.
character.”
Steve stares at the wall for a long time after Tony leaves, his inspiration sapped.
“Yet you know what
He holds Tony’s hand tighter. He’ll be embarrassed about it later, he knows, but he needs it right now.
“I know you don’t want to see me anymore but that’s outside of work. I’m an adult. I would have done my job—all you had to do was ask.”
Tony doesn’t want to look away, but he has to, blinking back tears.
“All right over there, Parker?”
“I know, Pepper.”  Tony knows her patience is wearing thin.  He can push the sarcastic humor only so far before it stops being a defense mechanism and turns into an offensive weapon.
“Is there a better night for magic?”
“We were in the basement, I really lost all track of time.” Tony defends. “My hand to god.”
Steve and his best pal continue hitting all the Big Apple sights, playing tourist as if they’re foreigners and not native New Yorkers.  It hardly seems to matter that most NYC landmarks haven’t changed much since Steve and Bucky left for Europe in ’43; they want to see them anyway.  Clint and Natasha go with them almost everywhere.  He suspects that is part Fury’s doing because the director still doesn’t trust Barnes in the slightest and wants to keep an eye on him.  This will probably be the only thing he and Fury will ever agree on.
“Not fast enough.”  He turns to Pepper – he never knows what to say to her at times like these, but this circumstance feels worse than ever.  A casual quip to reassure her isn’t going to cut it.  Tony looks at her, waiting a beat before he speaks, wanting her to fully understand.  “I love you, Pepper.”
“Only if it’s funny,” Tony replies before smiling his way into a kiss that he happily extends as long as possible.
“Don’t be sorry…” Steve trails off because he realizes Bucky is crying, tears streaming down his face.  That’s all it takes for everything within him to crack wide open.  All that he’s been trying to
“And I doubt you’re someone who takes being ignored lightly,” Steve replies.  Tony taps a finger to his own temple and then points at Steve like he’s got it in one.  “Can’t see you taking that laying down.  So, what’s your sketchbook?”
But when Tony had returned from his own tantrum and discovered that no one seemed to know where Steve was, he’d gone looking.  He’s never thought of himself as particularly great at reading people – Obadiah had been plotting to kill him for years, after all, and he’d been none the wiser – but he’d at least thought he’d had a vague idea of what Steve would do in a situation like this.
“Good, cause I’d like to know what the hell in god’s name you think you’re doing-“
Tony opens the door to the walk-in closet and gestures for Steve to come inside.  Steve closes his gaping mouth and follows him.
“We should maybe go back in, watch the ball drop with everyone?”  Steve suggests, rubbing his hands over Tony’s arms and back to heat him up.
“But potent as that shit was, it woulda worn off by now.  This does, however, lead to an important question I’ve been meaning to investigate – I know you can’t really get drunk.  Can Captain America get high?”
“Sure.”  It doesn’t sound like Tony believes him.  “This doesn’t bother you at all.”  Tony doesn’t say anything more, perhaps waiting to see if he’ll answer the implied question.
and Natasha just shrugs, like
“Better. You can barely tell.” Tony announces, and Steve glances past him toward the mirror. To him it’s glaringly obvious – his lips are rosy and the color on his cheeks high, and he’s far more sweaty than he has any right to be. He looks at Tony, dismay clearly apparent. Tony shrugs. “You’re playing a detective. You
. He barely talks to me, and when he does, he doesn’t look me in the eye. He’s not sleeping, though he’s pretending that he’s fine. If I try to talk to him about any of it, he insists he’s right as rain. He’s pulling long hours and hiding at Natasha’s and I just…don’t get it.”
“Go charm the pants off America.”
"You never said you lived across the street from Jan." Steve's put off by the non-sequitur. "Janet Van Dyne?" Tony gestures over his shoulder in the general direction of the apartments across the street. "Saw her leaving when I arrived."
“She should act like it. We need a
was how you were going to convince him?  That was your grand plan?”  He laughs at Natasha, who just continues manhandling Steve down the staircase.  Steve manages to get out a few sputtering words of protest, but whatever’s going on here he’s pretty sure it’s not worth yelling over.   “I’m sorry, bro, I think what Nat was trying to say is: ‘We’re going out for dinner, would you like to come?’”
“Like that’s possible,” Clint mutters under his breath as Bruce ducks out after Tony.  Steve ekes out a smile somehow, even though Clint’s comment was barely funny and not a single person in the room cares.  It just seems like he should try to react normally to things; they’re expecting him to handle this.  He couldn’t fall to a million pieces when he woke up in 2012, and he can’t fall to a million pieces now.
He supposes since the film used a fake set, it’s the thing with him and Steve.
“Bucky…hey…” Steve murmurs, rubbing his eyes. His voice is wrecked and he sounds dog tired. He coughs lightly, and then focuses his weary gaze on Bucky. “You sound like my ma.”
“Saving it for a friend.” Steve shrugs.
Steve thinks it will be fun.  His ma used to mention something vaguely like trick or treating from back home in Ireland, but it wasn’t really a neighborhood tradition when he was a child in Brooklyn.  He suspects it’s not all that popular here in Manhattan now, with towering apartment buildings full of complete strangers and tightly closed doors, but an Avengers Halloween event will probably draw a crowd.
his first official public appearance, all he’d asked in return was some version of Camilla to take home to Tony.
“Am I allowed to ask what about?”  His stomach is slowly tightening and sinking at the same time, leaving him with a nagging feeling sitting low in his gut.
“It’s…it’s the hotel soap. I took a shower, I…I stank of booze and cigarettes.” Steve replies haltingly, caught off guard by the question. “And nothing

Tony ignores Maria’s sarcasm and shakes his head sadly, flicking his hand toward the projectionist dismissively. The playback is switched off, the film shuttering to a stop.
The leader flips by, sync sound beeping at 2 before the screen goes dark. The titles come up –
?  And what the hell were they trying to teach you?  That it’s still a no-no to solicit gay sex in public rest rooms?”
“Well now I’m
Steve is standing in the doorway to the workshop, dressed in faded jeans and a grey Henley, hair immaculately combed.  Despite the careful presentation he still looks like he went twenty rounds with Banner on a bad day.  The sight of him makes Tony feel simultaneously nauseated and incredibly grateful.
“It can get you somewhere, Tony.  Just maybe nowhere you want to go.”
Steve circles the kitchen counter and walks to Tony, stopping directly in front of him and gingerly handing him his glass.  He meets Tony’s gaze as he sets the drink in his outstretched palm.  This close, Tony notices the day’s worth of stubble shadowing Steve’s sharp jaw line; it makes him look older, slightly tired.  It also means Steve’s someone who likes to shower and shave in the morning, which isn’t surprising in the least.  The guy probably rises before the sun.
“You like him?” Because of course that was the thing Steve was latching on.
“Okay, what can you tell me about it?” Tony asked. Bucky shrugged.
Simply describing them as undead being definitely wasn’t enough, since Nebula argued that she too, was an undead being, and it didn’t explain the whole concept either. In the end, Peter went with a similar route as the explanation about cyborg by talking about the whole history of the concept, the Western adaptation of a Haitian tradition.
“Hello?”
I hope you like the last chapter :)
“I’m not asking you to validate me, or to be my moral compass.” He grinned. “I just… I can do so much more, so much better, when I know you believe in me. I’m not good, on my own, never was. I always had Bucky, and when I didn’t I- well, you know how the story goes.” He hesitated, took a step closer. After a moment, he reached out and took Tony’s hand in his. “I love you, Tony Stark. You make me want to be better and I’m always gonna be thankful for that. Thankful that I can share this with you, whatever it is, whatever it will be.”
So yeah, it was good. The only one (apart from Peter, who he hadn’t seen yet) who still worried Tony was Bucky. He didn’t really seem to find a place that he could call home. Both he and Sam spent time at the house, even when Sam got sucked into his new duty more and more. Bucky followed him on missions, but he often came to see Steve on his own as well. It was kinda heartbreaking, the way he was still hesitating at the door step, as if he expected to be thrown out every time. Tony made a point to include him as much as he could, passing Morgan to him whenever he could, because that seemed to help him be at ease, at least a bit. He had tried to refuse, in the beginning, but soon realized that Tony wouldn’t stop. Then he started to enjoy it, or so it seemed. Maybe it was easier for him, to smile and talk with Morgan, who didn’t know him before, who expected nothing of him.
“You know I have to leave, tonight, right?”
“Love you 3000, daddy,” she said and yep, Tony was dad enough to admit that this made him cry. A little bit. Rhodey smiled at him and pulled the blanket tighter around both of them.
“You’re afraid of water?” Tony shrugged.
“Yeah, you’re right. They do make me very happy. What about you?”
“I- I’m not sure I want to be the White Wolf either,” he admitted after a moment, almost whispering. As if it was shameful, not wanting to fight anymore. Oh. Okay, this Tony could understand.
“Date,” Steve suddenly blurted.
“I can see that, pumpkin.” He looked at the two men standing in his kitchen, both wearing a sheepish expression. Barnes had ducked out of the way, away from Morgan, as soon as Tony had entered the kitchen. That was something they would need to talk about, because he had seemed to be enjoying himself and Tony didn’t want him to stop doing so, just because of some misguided guilt.
“I do, yeah.”
“Kiss me?” Rhodey grinned at him, one eyebrow slightly raised.
The car stopped and for a moment, nothing moved. Then the passenger’s door opened and-
“I just wanted to see you,” he said, as if that made everything better (it did, but that was not the point).
“That’s good, Tony. You deserve as many chances as you can get.”
There was another moment of silence, then: “I’ll come. Of course I’ll- Tony are you sure?”
“I would be honored to call you my father,” she said, her voice grave and hushed. Okay wow, serious business.
“Try what?” he asked, even though he had the sinking feeling that he already knew.
“I- I don’t know,” Bucky said, sounding lost. Steve was looking at him, hesitating. He had been very careful not to push memories onto him, so he obviously didn’t want to start doing so now. Tony looked at both of them, still so young and somehow unexperienced.
“General,” mumbled Bucky.
“Hey… Hey, Tony, it’s okay. I told you I’d come back, didn’t I?”
“Look, I’m sorry. Can we- can we just ignore it, please? Steve, I-“ He sighed. “Please?”
Bucky was silent for a while, not even moving and Tony was suddenly worried that it was too much, too soon. That all they would achieve with this was to chase him out of their bed, that he would leave. But he didn’t.
He found the three of them in the kitchen, making- cupcakes?
“Oh. Okay yeah, that makes sense.” And it also reminded Tony that this was not about him. Sure, he was honored that Peter trusted him enough, that he thought Tony was important enough to know. But in the end, this was about Peter, who just told him something that probably not that many people knew. And besides, it wasn’t as if Tony didn’t know how hard coming out was.
“Okay. Stay for dinner?”
This is a fill for "hot water" (T3) :)
“Hmm, okay. And you think it has something to do with what HYDRA did to you?” Bucky shrugged.
“I-“ Bucky shook his head, not really saying no, at least it didn’t seem so. “I should-“
“Yeah. Well, it did, nowadays the suit is all nanotech. But yeah, it used to. Powered my heart as well, for a while.” He snorted. “That’s not actually true. But it did keep the shrapnel in my chest from moving into my heart, so it did keep me alive.” It took Tony a moment to realize, that Bucky was completely frozen, staring at him in shock. “Hey, what is it, are you okay?”
Steve moved a bit closer to Tony, pulling him over to his chest and they stayed like that for a while, soft and warm. For a moment, Tony almost felt like crying, because he couldn’t believe, had never dared to even dream about something like that. To have this, his family and the people he loved, all safe and happy, was more than he could have ever hoped for.
Eventually, Morgan started to squirm in Bucky’s lap and Steve sat up.
They ended up almost burning the veggies, still standing in the kitchen, still kissing. It was Steve who noticed, of course he did. He pulled away, took them out of the oven, being the responsible adult that he was. Tony didn’t care about dinner anymore, though, he just wanted to go back to kissing. If tonight was all he got, then he wanted to enjoy it as much as he could.
“What do you prefer?” he wanted to know.
“I’m sorry,” he said instead. “I didn’t mean to bring back these memories, I just-“ Tony shook his head.
“Oh really, did you now, Steven?” Tony voice was suddenly icy, which made both Barnes and Wilson laugh so hard that is was difficult maintaining a stern face. Steve at least had the good graces to look abashed.
“Rhodey!” he cried, holding his arms out for a hug. It worked very well in making Rhodey (and Peter) laugh. “When did you get here?”
“I didn’t know,” Bucky said eventually, voice quiet.
“Please? Pepper took Morgan out to see her grandparents, it’s just me, I’m all alone tonight, just- please?”
“To see me, I think. To- He’s going to bring the stones back where they belong, into their timeline. He’s- I think he came to say goodbye.”
“Okay, then let’s do that.”
me, I guess.”
“About the arc reactor. It- it powers your suit, doesn’t it?” Tony nodded.
“Do you think talking to Clint might help?” Tony asked Steve on one of the bad days. They had both spent some time with him this morning, but eventually he had asked to be left alone. Steve hated it, hated feeling helpless.
“I can’t stay long; I’ll be busy bringing the stones back to where they belong. But I just- wanted to see you, before…”
“You never stopped loving him, did you?” Steve’s head suddenly snapped up and he was looking at Tony with wide eyes.
Neither of them had thought about dessert, but that didn’t really matter. They ended up on the couch eventually, trading lazy kisses that could have led somewhere, if the situation, the circumstances were different.
“Sure. Tell him that Nat’s around and that he’s due for a visit anyway.”
Tony leaned back against Bucky. Pepper smiled at him and patted her lap, so he stretched out his legs, too. She immediately began massaging his feet, because for some reason that was something that she liked doing while watching a movie. Rhodey grinned at her, arms wrapped tight around her waist. The kids were all lounging around on the couch and the floor, eating popcorn and probably getting half of it under the furniture, but Tony couldn’t bring himself to care. He was way too happy to be annoyed about something like that.
“No, I- no, this is perfect, it’s just- I didn’t expect it to be this easy, I guess.”
Rhodey helped him make his way over to the lake, while Pepper took Morgan inside to get changed and to get some drinks. It was peaceful, calm. There were more birds than before, which struck Tony as a weird thing to notice. But then again, Thanos hadn’t just wiped out half the human population but half of all living things.
“Yes. Afraid of drowning, to be precise.”
“Try this.”
“You want me to call him and tell him to come here?” Natasha stared at him. So did Steve. Did those people never think?
“Hey Clint. Do you have a moment?”
“I can’t- I don’t know what they did, but I-“ Bucky closed his eyes and Tony very desperately hoped that he wasn’t reviving
Bucky was sitting on the porch, staring out into the darkness. It was late, Morgan had been brought to bed hours ago and even Steve had gone to sleep. Tony had been planning on doing the same, just before he noticed Bucky sitting outside. So he changed his plan, made two cups of tea and went to join him.
“No, I know, it’s fine.” Steve laughed and for a moment it almost sounded like a sob, but his eyes were dry.
Tony hesitated. He wanted to give them some privacy, but he also wasn’t sure if Bucky wanted him to leave. But Clint gave him a small smile and nodded towards the door. Okay then.
This chapter is a fill for the Tony Stark Bingo square R4: Tony/ Rhodey/ Pepper :)
Tony had never heard Bucky raise his voice, and he didn’t now, not really. But he did sound very determined, as if it was important for Tony to understand, as if this was something that he would not change his mind about.
“Wanna be exiled together?”
His hands find Steve’s hips and then slide down over his ass, cupping his cheeks and lifting and pushing Steve up and onto his own lap. His legs dangle on either side of Tony’s body, his hands going to Tony’s shoulders to steady himself after the abrupt shift.
“Just have to make whatever comes to mind, then,” he mumbles to himself, wishing that Tony had at least given him some clue as to his preferences for food. He likes planning, not guessing.
“Well, I know the lyrics, but I don’t know about teaching you the music. Guess I could hum it for you.” Steve shrugs and circles around, taking a seat on the edge of the bench beside Sam. He’s careful not to interfere with his playing, but Sam shifts slightly to his right anyway, giving him more room.
Tony steps forward instead, pulling Bruce away from Betty’s lap and easily lifting him into a fireman’s carry.  Tony must catch his irked look because he lets out an annoyed huff himself.
, it doesn’t matter now.  It’s all gone.  He can’t compete with this.
“It’s part of it. But only part of it.” Steve tilts his head, pulling back to look up at Tony, finally. “I don’t want to be an
“Didn’t one of those guys get mauled?”  Steve asks, and off Tony’s look of surprise, continues.  “Thor brought it up at breakfast the day he came back.  He ‘wished to see the mighty sparkling warriors who tame the white beasts on a vast plane of glittering stars’.  Apparently he’s been shoring up his Midgardian history by reading old travel magazines Miss Lewis had at Dr. Foster’s lab.”
impressive. They’ve even added bums for authenticity,” Tony quips loudly when the man doesn’t stir. The joke does the trick, the man snapping to like he’s been slapped awake.
“We should make popcorn.  You want popcorn?”  Tony doesn’t wait for an answer, just clambers up and heads to the kitchen.  Steve watches him go, the title credits to the movie beginning to play.  The music is loud.
Tony lifts his head as Steve sets a steady pace, each thrust long and sinking deep.
The elevator begins to beep in alarm, the doors held open too long.
“I think I would’ve been okay with that.”
“Tony?” Steve stutters out, faintly surprised and already a little breathless. Tony wraps his fingers around Steve’s cock; he’s already half-hard too. Tony’s hips hitch against Steve’s backside involuntarily.
, close enough to touch.  “How do you feel?  Do you need anything?”
“Finish cleaning up your own mess.” She snaps. “And watch you don’t make a bigger one.”
His hands tighten on Tony’s hips, fingers digging in to the cut of muscle, the curve of his ass. He backs Tony against the sink without really thinking about it, just wanting something hard and stable to press Tony against.
And there he is.
Steve belatedly notices there are two guards inside the room, posted on either side of the closed door.  He doesn’t know them but he can tell they’re SHIELD down to their very cores.  They stare at Bucky and make no move to alert anyone of anything.
.  She can’t help what Bucky remembers at all.
“Actually, from what I can recall, I kinda thought he was an arrogant self-centered prick,” Bucky states, not smiling.  “I’m not Steve, I don’t own a pair of rose-colored glasses.”
“Oh fuck, Tony,” Steve gasps as he wraps his own hand around his length and jerks himself to completion. The mess on his chest is spectacular and Tony rubs his hands through it as he loses his rhythm, stuttering inside Steve’s body and then pumping in hard like he needs to get further in than he’s physically capable of going. His whole body pulses with his orgasm as he fills Steve with his come.
He shades his own eyes with his hand and slowly the man standing there comes into focus.
“Tony, hang on, let me find a medic.”
“Rogers, against orders you dropped behind enemy lines and launched a solo invasion against an enemy base, rescuing hundreds of men from crazed Nazis, and you did it all to save your friend.”  Tony states.  “So believe me when I tell you, I’m not the only one wondering why you’re letting a pesky little order from Nick Fury keep you away from Barnes.”
But in all honesty, there was no way around it. Perhaps he hadn’t meant to say it just like that, but he was always going to talk to Steve about this thing with Bucky first, before he let Steve and Bucky sort it out between themselves. He wishes he were the bigger person who could simply send Steve in to talk to Bucky without getting a lay of the land, letting things shake out as they might, but even he's not that much of a self-sacrificing idiot.
“Nope.” Steve pops the ‘p’, shaking his head. “Haven’t seen him.” As a matter of fact, he’s seen little of Bucky for the past two weeks. His best friend has been edgy and distant, spending long hours at the office and going out with Natasha in the evenings more often than not.
“The view is even better from the balcony,” Tony suggests. “If you wanted to come back inside.”
“That would be fine.” Steve isn’t clear on what
“Mr. Stark.”
“How are you?”  He asks Tony, all too aware of his voice cracking.  His parched lips strain to form the words.  His head is starting to pound and he considers asking Bucky for some water before remembering that the other man is cuffed to the collapsible handrail and won’t be going anywhere.
“Steve, there you are.” Sam greets him, sliding on to the bar stool beside him.
A brand new Buick Roadmaster cruises down the avenue, its maroon paint job spotless and its chrome shining. The top is down and Steve instantly recognizes the passenger despite her large, dark sunglasses and black, feathered capulet. He would never comment upon it, but he can’t help but notice she’s clearly dressed in yesterday’s clothes, a strapless evening gown and shoulder high gloves. Her diamonds shimmer in the sunlight.
“But we’re not talking about the film anymore, are we? That was just flattery for flattery’s sake. You need to be flattered more often if you’re still so unwilling to believe it.”
Everything’s fine.
do that anymore. I haven’t done that since
“They tore that down too.”
“So you did go dark on purpose.”  He comments and Steve looks weary as he slips his wallet into the back pocket of his new jeans.
He eats, they drink.  Then he sits and they drink some more.  He tells them about the volunteer work he’s been doing, they offer him vague details of the latest missions SHIELD has handed down.  Every time he tries to make a departure, one of them finds a way to reel him back in.
you.  Wouldn’t you think, after discovering you were still alive, after that
script?”
“Exercise keeps my mind clear,” Steve replies a bit defensively.  “Besides, Fury’s been limiting my time with the clean up, so I don’t have much else to do.”
“Tell it to the trees, buddy. I also got a better vaporizer and Bruce sent a new batch of that eucalyptus oil you can snort – there are much more fun things to put up your nose, but okay – and he made this peppermint, rosemary, beeswax stuff to put on your chest to help with the congestion.” Tony carefully rearranges Steve against his side so he can lean over, dig into the nearest paper bag which has helpfully fallen over within reach. He pulls out a small tub, screwing off the lid. The mixture reeks, the peppermint so strong it tickles Bucky’ nose even from where he’s standing.
“Remember how Irv used to run away just about once a week?” Steve sneezes twice in a row, but grabs a fresh tissue and then continues on with his memory. “And she’d be leaning out that window--"
“That’s not—“ Tony gets up, pacing the length of the airplane cabin. He doesn't know how to make Pepper understand this, and he shouldn't have to, but here he is trying anyway. But he supposes if this thing with Steve and Bucky works out, he's going to have to get used to explaining; very few people are going to look on this situation with approval. “Look. Steve and I had a conversation, in which we decided that he and Bucky needed to have their own conversation. And I just…I wanted to let Bucky know in advance that I was okay with that conversation happening, so they…didn’t need to stop mid-conversation to loop me in. So I know that they might be…
“We’ll see.” She eyes her sometimes-boyfriend askance, and then looks down at the list of tracks on the mix critically.  Steve had offered a few suggestions, Lord Huron, Joywave, and A Silent Film among them, but he doesn’t know what Bucky eventually went with.  When Natasha doesn’t offer much of a reaction, Bucky steps back, decides to go stand by Steve.
Objectively he knows it’s a good piece of work.  It’s balanced in form, balanced in color.  It’s equal parts sleek and jagged, kinetic and still.  There’s a sense of movement and a sense of force, like trying to contain something that refuses to be contained.  He can parcel it down to its separate pieces; admire its construction and how it functions.
Steve is on one side. Steve is on
“I brought wine,” Jan says as she sees what Bucky has in hand, and Bucky amenably puts his beer right back and re-directs himself to finding a corkscrew in their messy collection of utensils.
“You made vibranium?”
“Just…don’t ever leave me, okay?”
“Ugh, I can never un-hear that.”
“Forgive me, Director, but how is Tony Stark in the position to request anything?  I was under the impression he no longer wished to be a part of this organization.”  Steve tries to keep his tone respectful but there’s a demanding, annoyed edge already creeping into his words that he just can’t help.  Thankfully Fury doesn’t call him on it.
What he
It is not his job to wonder how they knew.
Apart from the teakettle on the stove and the toaster on the counter, the kitchen is unsurprisingly free of gadgets and appliances.  The drying rack by the sink implies Steve’s never bothered to open the dishwasher.  There’s decaying vintage art of the American flag on the pale green wall and Tony suspects that apart from the cross hanging by the door, that’s as far into decorating the place as Steve will ever get.
He draws his hand back too quickly, he knows. This is what Pierce must have been waiting for. Something unwanted and unbidden. Something against orders.
“Anyway, forget the Shins, we’ve gotta plan on the New Order show.  Right, Stevie?”  He ruffles a hand through Steve’s immaculately combed hair.
Or maybe they could just sleep.  Sleep sounds great.
So Steve knows that Bucky is deliberately avoiding his look now, that he
“We’ll have to agree to disagree,” Pepper states as she opens the heavy door to Tony’s new office, pausing to let him enter first. She closes the door behind them, listening to hear the latch catch shut. Sighing heavily, she looks down at the schedule as Tony circles around the large mahogany desk and sits down in the expensive handcrafted leather chair he’d had shipped directly from Italy. “He is expecting to see you in half hour’s time.  Shall I cancel?”
“He’s moving in too.”
Pepper’s gaze softens in a different way then and he wonders how often she looks at him like that when he’s not paying attention.  He turns from the mirror to face her directly.  She reaches out and runs a hand through his hair and it’s odd, because it feels like she’s trying to comfort
He does have Tony’s office number, but he doesn’t know how he would explain to Pepper why he needs Tony’s home address or phone number, and he doesn’t expect she goes around simply handing that out, even if he is the lead actor in Tony’s film.
It had been a close call.
“Upstairs watching those Jason Bourne films.”
Just as loved.
Pepper stands.
“Sit, sit down.  Just stay still for a minute.”  He closes his eyes and makes a shushing noise.  “This is good.”
Tony lets his arm fall; he walks backward for a few paces until he’s sure that Steve is actually moving to follow. Once Steve has closed the gap between them, Tony reluctantly turns and faces forward.
“It’s
“Tony, you’re…” Steve starts, a bit surprised that Tony is already prepared for this, like he’d expected it despite coming into the bathroom under the pretense of concern. He’s not sure he really cares about the presumption.
He gives Steve everything he’s got but the angle is difficult with one hand smothering Steve’s cries of pleasure, so eventually he gives up, plants both hands on Steve’s chest for leverage and starts nailing Steve’s prostate on every thrust.
“I mean, I’m okay with the ride but I don’t understand why…all this had to be right now.”  He gestures around them, trying to encompass all of Tony’s strange behavior of the past few minutes with one motion.  Tony relaxes a little then, leading Steve to wonder what Tony thought he’d meant.
“You didn’t, I was just…” Steve trails off.  He’s quiet as he pulls from Tony’s grasp, turning off the faucet and backing away.  He cradles his hand against his stomach briefly but then drops it down to his side, droplets of water shaking to the marble tile.  “It’s no big deal.  It’ll heal by sun up.”
Given the awkward angle, the kiss is sweet and light, and unfortunately brief. Tony brushes Steve’s cheek with his thumb before Steve’s neck protests and he has to drop his head back down.
“And you really don’t care to make the distinction?” Steve presses. It’s not as if he thinks Loki will ever regret his choices, but it’s hard to believe that anyone could be so vapid and heartless.
He wants to shoot something.  He wants to blow something up in a way he hasn’t since before Afghanistan.  Even the Jericho would not suffice at this moment.
“Could’ve at least let me say I love you too,” Tony says as Steve hits him in just the right place and he pitches forward with a moan, hands slipping on the counter.  Steve slips forward with him, pressed against Tony’s sweat-slick back as Tony involuntarily clenches around his length.  Steve comes with a bitten-off groan and the feel of Steve pulsing inside of him is nearly too much for Tony to take.
The entirely misplaced focus and the anger the Winter Soldier feels are not exactly his.
about you.  You owe them nothing.”
“You may, sir, but I do feel compelled to inform you that Master Stark has skeleton codes for the entire building.  He can override any code you create.”
Steve’s already in Pennsylvania, just his bike and the clothes on his back, before he fully realizes what he’s doing.  When he does, he just revs the engine and keeps on going.
“You’re serious.”  Steve turns around, looking again at all the surrounding buildings, at the curving wall of the sports center.  “This…Penn Station used to be here.  Right here.”
“I highly approve of this.”  Tony runs a finger over one of the lines, imagining how it will look all lit up against the darkness.  Steve likes the pleased expression on Tony’s face, not a hint of insincerity there.
“What conic what?” Sam’s face screws up in puzzlement.
“You really do surprise me, Steve Rogers,” Tony says quietly as he rests their foreheads together. Steve’s unsure what he means by that, but before he can ask Tony to explain, the sink shifts underneath Tony’s weight. It tilts forward and to the right with a crack of porcelain and the creak of metal. Steve catches Tony to stop him slipping to the floor and steadies him on two feet.
“You said something about breakfast?” His voice is rough and he’s not sure if it’s the usual morning gruffness or something else. Steve brings a hand to the hollow of his throat, remembering how Tony had wrapped his fingers loosely around his neck when he’d been the one flat on his back, Tony thrusting between his legs. It hadn’t been hard enough to choke, just a little extra pressure that heightened every sensation of Tony moving inside him. He’d rather liked it. He hopes Tony left a bruise.
“Now I’m just intrigued.” Rhodey folds his arms over his chest and makes a
She’s really asking if he wants her to stay.
, it’s like seeing someone you used to know, then going over to say hey and having them ignore you like a complete asshole.”
“I didn’t know he told you.”  So she’s not shocked by the question, but by Steve cluing him in.
Tony doesn’t fill the void with effortless and endless chatter the way he usually does.  His tanned, calloused hands – those hands that prove him a man of action and application in his world of theorists and thinkers – stay still as they grip the metal foot rail of the narrow hospital bed.  Tony glances toward the hallway, biting the inside of his cheek.
“Oh, you may want to check in with public relations, because you might have something to deal with. Seems that Rogers has been spending time with Janet Van Dyne as of late? Word is that she's leaving Pym, finally, and Steve's soon to be his replacement.”
“‘Play it, Sam. Play 'As Time Goes By.'”
“Gabbing with me will beat sitting on the bus, I assure you. God knows why Stark hasn’t engaged a car service for you, that really should come standard.”
Tony pushes his black horn-rimmed glasses up his nose as his lifts his head, looking toward Steve like he’d felt the weight of a studying gaze upon him.  He tucks the phone into the front pocket of his black pea coat as Steve closes the space between them.
Tony takes the gamble and lets himself in.  The click of the door closing behind him announces his presence in the quiet bedroom.
Then he goes back to the window.
ass.  “And I know we got a lot to talk about and all, but I swear to god I’m not gonna be able to think clearly until I fuck you.  Or you fuck me.  I don’t even care; I honestly cannot concentrate on anything else besides getting your clothes off right now.”
Clint says it in a tone that sounds a little
“Steve…” Tony feels like he’s not getting through. “I know I acted like I didn’t care, but I didn’t want you to leave this morning. I wanted to sit down at that tiny table and eat an obnoxiously large breakfast with you, and then go back to bed until one of us absolutely couldn’t stay any longer. I wanted to make plans to see you again before letting you out of my sight. That’s what I wanted.”
“Can’t I just call without needing anything?”
“You’re sitting here alone and you look sad. You never look sad since uncle Steve and the others came here.” He smiled. Clever little girl.
It took a while, but eventually Bucky calmed down, straightened up a bit. He was whipping his eyes on his sleeve, or at least he tried to, until Tony passed him a tissue. Being a prepared dad definitely had his benefits, sometimes.
Morgan didn’t have a problem with that development, not at all. She took to her new uncle Steve, uncle Bucky, uncle Sam (shut up, it was hilarious, okay) and aunt Nat with ease, enjoying having so many people over who all loved to spend time with her.
Cap’s words are the last thing he remembers before waking face up in the street with the Hulk towering over him.
“Hey,” she says quietly, wide green eyes searching his face carefully.
, after all these years, and then say he’s not allowed access?  What the fuck?”
“Much,” Tony replies, already looking forward to spending tomorrow night in his California King size bed with nice, clean, 1500 thread count Egyptian cotton sheets, with a stunning view of the majestic Rockies instead of a dirty parking lot.   He goes all the way back into the bathroom, and as he shuts the door behind him, he catches a glimpse of Steve’s hands going to his waist, loosening his towel.
It’s one of the few times Steve wonders if being his old self, 10 inches shorter and 105 pounds lighter, would actually be to his benefit. People look at him and see some brawny beefcake who built the rooms they stand in, but they forget that it all came from intricate, careful plans created in his mind and drawn in detail by his hand.
“And then one night Steve kissed you and you realized you were wrong.” Bucky mumbles, knowing that part of the story. Steve had told him the day after, grinning like a fool and his head up in the clouds, and Bucky honestly, truly, barely felt a twinge. His feelings for Steve were locked up so tightly in a small little box marked
Funnily enough, he does, screen door slapping closed behind him. A cigarette hangs from his lips, almost falling from his mouth in surprise when he takes in the sight in front of him.
There’s a list of supplies they need for that afternoon’s work that everyone’s been scribbling down throughout the morning, so Steve pulls the paper from the clipboard, folds it in quarters, and slips it into his pocket. The pencil gets tucked over his right ear.
, now his and Wanda’s names are up there in big, boxy, black letters. In the recent remodel the old red and white sign was replaced with undulating waves of green neon,
do, and they’re two entirely different things.
“Yeah…that.” Steve admits, then heaves another sigh. He rubs his face, frustration and anxiety rising higher. Tony reaches over and grabs one of his hands, pulling it away from his head and toward his own chest. He also moves closer, tossing one of his legs over Steve’s, his sock-clad feet tangling with Steve’s bare, cold ones. His body anchors Steve’s into place and the weight of him calms Steve a little.
Before Steve can respond, the waiter returns to take their dinner requests. Tony orders for them both, arranging for hors d’oeuvres and multiple courses followed by dessert, all without so much as consulting Steve. The meal will be lengthy, and he calls for another bottle of wine to be prepared.
“So you and Bucky…” Tony starts, then stops, then starts again. “Your weekend was…eventful?” His voice lifts in question at the end of the sentence, like he’s unsure if
“I…” Steve starts, looking unsure, and Tony knows there’s an apology coming at him sooner rather than later.
“Nothing.”
“Oh…right, right, right.” Tony smiles a little to himself. Honestly, he doesn’t know what he’s going to do with Betty’s talents, but when he’d met Thaddeus at an industry function earlier in the month, he’d witnessed firsthand the way the man treated his daughter; it had been with absolutely no respect.
“This isn’t for fun, this isn’t—“ Bucky stops, and Tony suspects it’s because something insulting was on the tip of his tongue. He’s aware that his previous romantic exploits left him with a bit of a reputation, but Bucky has to know by now that he’d never take any part of his relationship with Steve lightly.
Dr. Ross clambers in after him, shaking her head once as she slams the door.
Tony doesn’t mean to watch.  What he meant to do was come down here, hustle and bustle his way through a meet and greet with the Cap and then be on his way.  He has things to do, surely – Pepper always insists he does – and Rogers wouldn’t be expecting an
Steve pulls the shower curtain back slowly. He knows what he must look like; Tony had probably come in half-expecting to find him curled in a ball, a sobbing mess on the floor, and instead he’s standing here solidly, dripping wet and fully hard.
“You told her, didn't you.”
“You don’t have to say anything you don’t want to.”  Steve assures him, though he suspects he’s as afraid of hearing what Bucky has to say as much as Bucky might be afraid of saying it.
“Who?”
world, where he’s so
“Look.  I know ten feet outside that door it’s a different world.  That’s pretty hard to ignore.  Not kidding myself, Stark.  But here…it’s one place at least that doesn’t feel
Tony waves him off, then stretches his arm enough to shake down his sleeve, let him get a look at his watch face for the time.
“Steve.” Tony pats a hand against Steve’s broad chest, and then unknots his tie and starts unbuttoning his shirt.
“I know that.  Why exactly do you think I’m here?”
,” Bucky curses as Steve works all the way down his length, nose pressed into the dark thatch of curls between Bucky’s legs. With his other hand he rubs gently at the sensitive spot behind Bucky’s balls, and Bucky makes a strangled, beautiful noise. His thighs tense, legs spreading wider, and where Steve has his other hand flat on Bucky’s abdomen, he feels the twitching and clenching of muscles that warn him what’s about to happen even before Bucky can get the words out himself.
would be a helluva distraction but might be too much for Steve to handle at the moment.  A walk on the High Line would be too peaceful, a beer garden in Astoria too pointless, and anything in Brooklyn, anything at all, is obviously right out.
“I’m fine, I’m fine.” She doesn’t look at all convinced. “I’m just bored. I’m used to having more to do.”
“I'm about all full up on Bucky's 'thoughts' for now, thank you.” Tony replies, voice tight, and then he glances at his wristwatch and huffs. “As fun as this has been, I'm due to meet Bruce in five.”
“Oh. Hey, Pete. I didn’t realize you were here.” He shoots Tony a look and the other man waves him off.
“Movie critic,” Tony frowns.  “I feel like we might be falling down a rabbit hole here, maybe we better leave
“I’m up now,” Steve finally says and gives Tony’s hand a squeeze.
“Tell me you have good news, buddy,” Tony begs, tapping his foot against the floor.  There’s a lot of noise in the background, excess chatter and the rumble of a huge engine.  “C’mon, tell me you’re all in one piece and on the way home.”
“It’s been known to happen,” Steve mumbles darkly, actually looking a little bit angry.
To be fair, even without Tony it would’ve been a lot to handle.  There are too many lights, too many people, and too much noise.  It’s an assault on his already hyperactive senses and it leaves him constantly tense, incessantly on his guard.   After only a few hours inside Caesar’s Palace watching Tony gamble, Steve quietly excuses himself to their room.
“And I ordered Thai curry for dinner from that place you like. I know, I know, you’re not hungry,” Tony cuts off a protest that Steve didn’t even try to make. “But it will help clear out your sinuses and I tell you, that heat actually feels good on the sore throat. You’ll see, I’m not wrong.”
“I really am terribly sorry, ma’am.”
“You must be Tony Stark.”  The man beside Steve jumps in, half-stepping between them and offering Tony his hand.  “I’m Sam Wilson.”
Steve reaches out to touch. Bucky carefully stays still, allowing him to do it.
“I’m protective of your baked goods, I will not apologize.”
know.”
“So that’s how it is. Good to know where our friendship stands,” Steve retorts. “Not even worth a song.”
“You grew up in Brooklyn. Tell me about that.”
…” he murmurs to himself.  Below the one-inch high bold print there is a photograph of a young man, crisply posed.  He has a flashy devil-may-care grin that Steve has seen before on another man’s face.
“Shut up, Hester Prynne.”
“You seemed a little uncomfortable back there.”
“Tash and Clint head out on a week long mission tomorrow, Betty has a conference in Singapore, and Thor’s going with Darce and Jane back to New Mexico to work on that whole Rainbow whatever situation.”  Bucky finishes his drink off; Tony hasn’t touched his.  “How ‘bout you turn down my invitation now so Steve doesn’t have to hear it.  If I have to see the look on his face one more time when you say no, it’ll be one time too many.”
Tony waves off any concern.
“Nothing.” Tony mutters, picking up a wrench from his toolbox and feeling the heavy weight of it in his hand for a moment before going back to the plane and ducking under to get at the landing gear. He’s already fixed what needs fixing, but pretending to be busy seems like the better option than facing his friend.
, just go undo whatever it is you did.” The question is implied, and Tony decides he should probably just confess the entire mess. It may feel better to acknowledge it aloud.
“Yeah, I
“That would be lovely, Steve.  Thank you.”
“I don’t know what you saw or why you were watching, but nothing happened.”
"Maybe someday I'll find someone worth courting and you can witness my humiliation for free," Steve counters.  He'd tell Tony to save his money and be patient, but he's beginning to doubt he'll ever find that right person.  It all feels so cruel, to have lost both Peggy and Bucky, only to have Bucky back again, so close, yet entirely out of reach.  He supposes it serves him right, really.  He'd let Bucky push him toward Peggy, and now he's reaping what was sowed.  Bucky has his own girl now.
Steve groans as Tony begins to move and without thinking Tony shifts forward, shoving deep and hard as he clasps his right hand over Steve’s mouth. Steve’s hips hitch and a stream of pre-come dribbles down his length. Tony’s unsure what specifically is setting Steve off here, being physically forced to stay quiet or the hard fuck, so Tony keeps both up.
“I think I need to tell you…” He looks up at Tony demurely through his lashes. “Your Brooklyn jokes weren’t funny the first time we met either.”
“I think this lead is a bust.”
“As much as I want you inside me, I really should go…
Rows of fluorescent fixtures hang from the high ceiling, making the room bright but without enough intense, focused light for Bruce to direct to his work. To that end he has a few portable studio lamps and a number of magnifying glasses rigged up on arms, with clips. The back wall is covered in pegboard, various tools arranged neatly for easy access. The red light bulb above the door off to the left signals the dark room, and another, narrower table along that wall is littered with a few changing bags, cast aside spools of film and leader, dust blowers and orange sticks, a portable developing tank and any number of bottles of chemicals.
“Steve.” His face drifts closer but their lips don’t meet, not yet.
Sure enough, not a few minutes later, Tony hears the plate glass door slide open behind him.
Steve whips his head up so fast his neck wrenches.  He catches a flash of Natasha’s red hair in the mirror before he turns fully around to face her.  His heart pounds wildly in his chest and he has to wonder why in the world she thought it would be a good idea to sneak up on someone recovering from an abduction.
“Don’t worry, I won’t breathe a word to anyone about your torrid little love triangle,” Tony retorts, which only serves to make her frown more deeply. “But seriously, why
“You could fuck me again,” Steve offers instead, kneeling up and inching forward. His cock is already plumping between his thighs. Tony feels his skin warm, blood rushing and heartbeat picking up as he responds in kind.
.  No way these two things aren’t related.”  Bruce gets between Tony and the holographic map of Asia, reaching out a hand and angrily sweeping all of Tony’s work aside.  “Listen to me.  She’s not like me.  Or you.  She’s just a scientist.”
He’s opening Steve’s pants, though, shoving his underwear down to his thighs, and Steve’s already got both their cocks in his big, strong hand, stroking and rubbing their lengths together.
“Tell me how it was,” Tony murmurs. He’s not entirely sure what he wants to hear. He’ll take any bits of the truth Steve can bear to part with.
He stays quiet, watching as Steve brings a trembling hand to his face, fingers rubbing at his temples.
“That’s not my name.”
Steve dashes to the rescue this time, taking her by the elbow and easing her back from that accident waiting to happen.
“We got a pumpkin for you over there, Barnes, you better get crackin’.”  Tony points across the room, waving a finger at the extra pumpkin sitting on the counter.  Steve hadn’t realized it was intended for Bucky, and his heart warms at Tony making the gesture.
“Bucky, Buck…I need…I
“Please, it’s Jan.”
Tony throws his arms out wide to welcome Phil, but just quickly drops them, letting out a disgruntled snort.  He makes a broad gesture up and down and around as if he’s trying to encompass all of Phil’s body.
And Tony is touching his Steve, and kissing him, and making him laugh, and pulling him close without pretense, and it's not okay that Tony gets to have that when he never could.
“Fuck,” Tony mumbles, rubbing his head and then his neck as he quickly inventories his surroundings, making note that yes, he did actually fall asleep on the floor in the lobby of his own building, and no, he’s not drunk or high or anything that could account for such strange behavior.
“Okay,” Tony replies, though he sounds unsure.
“It’s about time you made your way over here,” He sidesteps smoothly.  “Though I think maybe we should get Bruce down here to Hulk out.  It ain’t easy being green but he needs to give it a shot, and you need a run for your money.  Y’know, at least until Thor drops in and you have an approximation of a more likely enemy. The Hulk
His words trail off as he catches sight of Natasha and Clint standing up, somehow miraculously sober, and walking straight down the hallway to the elevator with unwavering steps and nary a look back.  Steve lets his shoulders slump.
“Uh-huh,” Tony agrees simply, smiling down at the top of Steve’s head and patting his hair in a patronizing way. Bucky knows it’s in jest but it somehow makes him hate Tony all the more. The privilege of poking fun at Steve and getting away with it used to be his and his alone. “JARVIS has loaded up the queue with all the old Katharine Hepburn movies he could get his figurative hands on, and I have a stack of crosswords and Sudoku and all that junk for you. I probably killed a whole forest because you won’t use the damn tablet.”
“JARVIS, light the fire, would you please?”  Comes a voice from behind him.  Steve hurriedly rubs his cheeks and nose, wanting to erase any trace of sadness.  It’s the second time Tony has snuck up on him today and it’s odd, because no one except Natasha has been able to get close without him noticing.  Natasha can do it because, well, she’s been trained to do it, it’s what she does.
“What the – hey, you think you could’ve led with that maybe?!”  Tony calls after her, but she’s long gone and far from caring.  He grabs a hand towel from the rack and dabs at his wet clothes.  “JARVIS!  When did the Captain get here?”
Tony takes a step back, bracing himself for the hit he knows must be coming.
“I do. I love Tony too.” Steve nods. There’s no question of that; in this whole mess, he’s never once doubted that what he feels for Tony is real and lasting. It’s weird how assured he is, even as he grapples with the overwhelming resurfacing of his desire and love for Bucky.
“I can’t wait to be in my own bed,” Steve says as he reluctantly forces himself upward.  “I’m dead on my feet.”
Clint winks and pushes the door open.
“This
“What? I can’t see him?”
“I know you do.” Pepper tucks her long hair back behind her ears and forces her gaze to Steve.  “Be careful.”
“You were an artist?”  Tony tries to imagine it, but it’s a lot like trying to picture a stereotypical high school quarterback painting happy little trees.  The only thing that comes to mind is one of those silverback gorillas you see in the documentaries that learn how to sign and finger-paint.  Steve as an artist does not compute.   He swallows down his disbelief and tries to imagine Steve as he was,
“Like a black hole.” Pepper drains her glass, trading it for a new one as a server passes by with a silver tray.  Steve can’t tell if she’s upset or bored, but he doesn’t know what to do about either.  He just knows he doesn’t agree with her, not about Tony being a black hole.
“You can leave.”  Tony brushes Steve off without looking up.
“Miss Potts, you tricksy minx. I’m paying you to lie to me now?”
With how much sex he’s already had over the past weekend, Steve is amazed to feel himself hardening quickly in Tony’s grasp as he begins to stroke.
He has not made use of the phone number embossed on its front, the black lettering starting to fade from where his fingers have traced over the lines one too many times.
“Thank you, Nigel. This is much appreciated.” Tony hands the man a bill as well, and Nigel simply bows and excuses himself, leaving Steve alone with Tony and a nearly dark, arched stone hallway that apparently leads back to the hotel.
Tony wavers, debating furiously in silence, and is about to knock when the sliver of warm light seeping from underneath the door abruptly goes out.
“Just follow her,” Clint shrugs when Steve looks at him questioningly.  “It’s so much easier than trying to resist.”
“It’s not what you think.” Steve starts to explain, re-buckling his belt, but Tony just shakes his head in refusal.
“Don’t look now, Cap, but Hulk’s destroying more landmarks.”
“Cap, that was almost
With his socks, shoes and suit coat gathered in his arms, Steve leaves Tony in the dressing room and makes the long walk down the narrow hallway toward the living room. He sits down on one of the armchairs and puts on his socks and shoes slowly, wondering if Tony is going to come back out and speak with him, maybe say good-bye, before he goes.
“Everything’s fine,” Tony waves him off, pushing past him through the doorway and inviting himself inside.  His shoes click on the hardwood floor.  He glances around, taking in his surroundings quickly.  It doesn’t take long; Steve’s entire place is the size of his childhood playroom.  It smells incredibly clean yet musty, like age is clinging to the wallpaper and can’t really be washed away no matter how many times Steve gives everything a fine military polish.  The rooms are sparse and tidy, bordering on bare.  There’s little furniture, all of it battered but sturdy, handcrafted.  Not the kind of cheap modern furniture put together on the quick; more like furniture bought at an estate sale.
It’s overwhelming.
“Wants me to star in his new picture, if you can believe that malarkey.”
“I don’t want
Tony’s jaw actually drops and Steve can’t keep himself from laughing, giving himself away.
“I don’t recall asking for your opinion, Barnes.”
“I don’t think so," Natasha replies more calmly and Clint, who’d been staring fixatedly at the table, snaps his head toward her.  His eyes flare with unexpected heat.
“Aren’t like, 75% of American movies set in New York?  People outside the U.S. probably think this city is all there is, the way we play it up.”  Steve is surprised he understood a word of what Clint said around the new fistful of popcorn stuffed in his mouth, but deciphering garbled statements must be a new skill he’s picked up from living with the archer these past six months.  “You ever think, if Hollywood stopped doing that, crazy supervillains would stop attacking it so much?  It’s practically painting a bulls-eye.  I mean…we deal with an absurd amount of nonsensical bullshit here, you gotta admit.”
The room Tony has given him has a fireplace, two flat screen televisions, its own sitting area, and a bed that has to be at least seven feet wide and is half covered in pillows of all different shapes and sizes.  The sleeping area can be closed in on all four sides by heavy curtains running from the ceiling to the floor.  Even at a glance, Steve can see the private bath is the size of his entire apartment back in Brooklyn.
“I don’t want to have to try and explain to the authorities that you were murdered by an AI.  I’d rather not spend the next 25 to life at Sing Sing.”
He stops short inside the entryway, registering both the tension and the incessant buzz of Tony’s unanswered call.
The marquee and façade for the Paramount still exist, but that’s all they are.  He’d been disappointed to find out that the theater had long since been replaced with offices or apartments or something, leaving the historical landmark of the Paramount logo on the edifice.
“Pepper…” Tony starts to argue, but he doesn’t know what to say.  Pepper stares at him, waiting, and all Tony can do is sigh.  “Call me when you land and let me know that you’re all right.  Please.”
, but you’re a big boy. It’s your choice to make.”
The hot liquid runs through the ridges of his fingers and seeps over the granite, pools on the tile floor.
“Ugh, fine.”  Tony reluctantly heads for the door.
“Fine.  But Bucky needs his own space.  Really want my own bed back.”
“We never...after the serum.” Steve replies to the question Tony hadn’t realized he’d asked aloud.  Tony sucks in a sharp breath and pulls back, wondering what other things he might’ve said without thinking.  “He thought I was better off pursuing Peggy.  Couldn’t convince him otherwise.”
