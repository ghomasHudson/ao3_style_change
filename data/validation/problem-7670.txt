“It seems like you are.”
A door swung open into the hall. Steve paused just as someone yelled at him to stop looking at his phone while he was walking. He glanced up at the person – a woman who had blonde hair.
“Steve!” A voice cut through the buzz of conversation. Steve swore a little under his breath. As much as he did want to see Tony, he was worried, like always, that somehow he’d make a fool out of himself.
“Why does it matter?”
“I’m sorry that I was kind of distant before.”
“Okay. Maybe not
“N-no, I was just checking in on him,” Steve said softly. He began to get up, but Morgan rushed over to him.
Steve shook his head. “No...I’m not sure where that came from. I’m sorry, Tony.”
He hung up and turned towards Tony’s painting. Some parts hadn’t turned out exactly the way he wanted, but he supposed that it wasn’t too bad. Tony would approve of it. At least, he hoped that he would.
“But Buck-”
(See the end of the chapter for
“So-what now?” Tony asked; his gaze flicked to him.
Steve’s gaze flicked to Tony’s face. “You know why.”
Steve laughed. “I’m not sure about that. I was just being polite.”
“Is it because you already have your eye on someone else?”
He forced himself to walk away from the table and out of the coffee shop. He walked passed the window that he knew Tony was sitting at, but he didn't look at him. If he did, he was sure that the tears that were stinging his eyes would break free.
No, no, no. That couldn’t be right. They had been working over seven hours every day. Their numbers seemed to be growing every couple of days. Surely they would be finished before that.
"Let him have his fun." he told his brother-in-arms. Thanos pried the Hulk's hands away; an expression of surprise and fear crossed the creature's green face. After several hard blows, Thanos picked up the Hulk and slammed him to the deck, defeated. Thor slammed a metal bar across Thanos's back to no avail, and got kicked across the deck by Thanos and was promptly bound in metal debris by Ebony Maw to keep him from interfering further.
"Don't you think that we should all have a weapon like that?" asked Star-Lord, and he knew that Leyenar would agree with him if she was here.
"I'm glad you brought this up, 'cause it's nothing. It's just a housing unit for nano particles." replied Tony. Carol sighed, watching them from afar. She thought,
Thanos:Hey!
"We don't wanna kill you. But we will." Nat said coolly.
"There are people who are expecting me too, you know. We both made promises."
there who was capable of doing so.
Viz=Vision
Leyenar exclaimed.
"Peter..."
Thanos:(gets up) Well, guys, it's finally my time. I'm off to destroy the universe. (heads for the door) You guys were fun. You guys indeed brought a smile on my face. I hope they remember you. (leaves)
"Can we do that?" asked Nat.
"The world's on fire. And you think, all is forgiven?" Ross snapped.
Inside the ship, Ebony Maw walked among the bodies of dead Asgardians. Heimdall, badly wounded, reached out as if he would stop Maw as he passes, but lacked the strength. Maw stepped over them with no mind as he spoke, as if they were scattered pieces of dirty clothing on a bedroom floor. Hear me, and rejoice. You have had the privilege of being saved by the Great Titan...You may think this is suffering...No, it is
"Who is she?" asked Rhodey.
Gamora began to laugh at the irony of the situation. "All my life, I dreamed of a day... a moment when you would get what you deserved. And I was always so disappointed. But now... you kill and torture... and you call it mercy. The universe has judged you. You asked it for a prize, and it told you no. You
This brings us back to Tony Stark, who has declared himself Iron Man. By itself, this is not remarkable, although excited chatter from my more scientifically-minded colleagues tells me that Iron Man's flight capabilities are extraordinary. What is puzzling is the attempt, and subsequent failure, to categorise Tony Stark and Iron Man. He is not a mutant, as far as we know, and Iron Man does not appear to require or use special mutant capabilities, unless they are those of flight. Neither does Stark appear to have been enhanced somehow. He is not superhuman, except if one considers genius a superhuman trait. So far, these are the only two words we have (and have needed) to describe people who can do things normal people cannot.
"Then we have to go to Knowhere now." said Gamora.
"You could use some of that right now." said Nat.
Remember, in Age Of Ultron, that little snippet where Tony's failed experiment integrated itself successfully to the Ultron program? It was because the Fates have decided the spirit of Ion shall inhabit that program, at least, in this AU.
The Shining Lord was watching the crowds with excitement, but there was something in his chest that beat wildly. His skin felt as if it was burning, itching—someone's gaze so heavy that the Lord felt as if it had penetrated to his bones. A young warrior looked up, blue eyes glimmering in wonder, gazing at the Lord wide-eyed. He was the Moon Prince's younger brother. The Lord, in turn, found himself pulled to the contender, unable to see his fate as his advisers did. He merely saw his brilliance, shining like a star under his sights. It was an instantaneous desire, driven by Fate, racing through their veins; the kind of want that neither could recognize, but desperately ached to fulfill.
The Apple Princess was despondent and cried and begged her father to let her be reunited with the Warrior once more, but he refused, knowing that he would receive the wrath of the Shining Lord by doing so. Meanwhile, the Star Warrior realized what a terrible mistake he had made, and he was once again reunited with his liege, the Shining Lord. He never dared to go across the Milky Way for the Apple Princess, for she deserved such punishment by falling in love with the Guardian of the High King.
"You will have my Kingsguard, the Border Tribe, the Dora Milaje, and..." T'Challa began.
Unfortunately, in his fit of rage, he didn't catch Carol's next message:
"I hope these dwarves are better at forging than they are cleaning. Maybe they realized they live in a junk pile in the middle of space." said Rocket.
. Vision is out there somewhere with the Mind Stone, and we have to find him now." he said.
"You'll only wish you were dead." Maw sneered. Strange fell unconscious and to the ground; Maw raised a portion of street pavement to use as a carrier, but the Cloak of Levitation worked its master loose of the cable spiral and flew Strange away. Meanwhile, Tony was still fighting Black Dwarf, as Strange passed through the park.
Leyenar replied, and raced over to the park nearby.
"I'm sure you did your best." Shuri said, offering him a warm smile.
Get ready for a quite long chapter!
Leyenar smirked.
I stare out into the multitude of universes, watching the ebb and flow of Time as her mighty waves crash upon every solar system, every world, every species, every life...
Dr. Strange saw his forelock fluttering, and said "Not at the moment, no."
"Thank you, Captain." Vision told Steve.
Tony was getting excited. "Yes?"
"Something's wrong. The star's gone out. And the rings are frozen." said a surprised Thor, but the trio entered the forge anyway. No matter the circumstances, it was the right thing to do.
Korean Translation:
"This is awkward." whispered Sam. Suddenly, a brunette woman came into the room.
"Lemme just ask the captain. Oh, wait a second, it's me! Yeah, I'll go." said Rocket.
Black Dwarf arrived at the park and threw his hammer at the three of them.
And it was time for Rocket to say the final question:"Are you sure you're up to this particular murder mission?"
"I got it figured out. We got two ships, and a large assortment of morons. So me and Groot will go with the pirate-angel here, and the morons will go to Knowhere to try and stop Thanos. Cool? Cool." Rocket insisted.
Well, during the time of the Celestials, it was the Star Warrior who made the mistake, but during the time of Leyenar, it's Tony who makes the mistake in Spider-Man:Homecoming.
"How many did we win?" asked Tony.
"Because, we didn't think of it." Bruce said uncertainly.
"Yeah." Tony crossed to stand right in front of Peter. "Right where I don't want you to be. This isn't Coney Island. This isn't a field trip. It's one-way ticket. You hear me? Don't pretend like you thought this through. You could not have possibly thought this through."
Palpatine:I SAID GET OUT!
"There is an 11." Wanda told him.
Thanos:Mergghhh.
"All words are made up." said Thor.
"Yes."
he still remembered the day she called Rhodey a "nigga" and received a knuckle sandwich from Nat. Afterwards, everybody began laughing at Pepper, and she had run away with her tail between her legs.
"Tree, pour what's in the cup out in space, and go in the cup again." said Thor, looking out the rear portholes.
"Language!" said Rocket.
"Holy bagumba!" cried Maw, surprised. "How...Is that an Infinity Gauntlet?"
Tony hesitated, before pulling out the cellular phone Steve mailed him, muttering 'flip phone'. It seems as though he brings it everywhere, always ready to call his lost lover. Before clicking "Call", he paused, distracted by an unusual rumbling. "Say, Doc, you wouldn't happen to be moving your hair, would you?" he asked.
Ned turned around and saw the spaceship. "Holy bagumba! We're all gonna die! There's a spaceship!" Students scrambled to the windows in the back to see the spaceship. Peter quickly slid on one of his Stark-made web-shooters, and webbed the emergency exit lever on the opposite side of the bus.
Everyone:Yaaaaaaaaaaaay!
Long ago, when the Shining Lord ruled the multiverse and all was peaceful, a child was born to the ruler of Heaven. He was a beautiful child, smart and kind, with a streak of wild recklessness his father called bravery. His name was Moon, Prince of Heaven.
"God, I love this place." said the Soldier.
"He can destroy life on a scale hitherto undreamed of." Strange finished.
"300 dwarves lived on this ring. I thought if I did what he asked, they'd be safe. I made what he wanted. A device capable of harnessing the power of the stones. Then he killed everyone anyway. All except me. "Your life is yours," he said. "But your hands are mine alone."..." Eitri said as he held up his his immobile metal fists, encased in hardened molten metal.
The fact that we cannot categorise Stark at first appears to be something of a trivial aspect. After all, one would say, a thing is not changed by its label. It does not matter whether we consider Stark a mutant or a superhero, especially since the man himself would probably resist either classification. This would, however, be grossly underestimating both the symbolic and physical impact of people like Stark and their counterparts like Iron Man. The symbolic impact is obvious - if Stark is a superhero, this gives him a certain authority, as well as an implied mandate for physical action. Captain America acted on a mandate given to him by Command, which in turn had a mandate to give orders because the USA had declared war on Nazi Germany. Although the US is embroiled in several conflicts abroad, including that in Afghanistan where Iron Man was allegedly first created, Stark carries no such mandate. This would not change even if it were revealed that Stark carries the X-gene. Mutants, after long decades fraught with tension, are now required to be taught and schooled in their powers, and cannot carry out violent actions without belonging to an officially recognised group - of which there exists only one, the X-Men, who are mostly concerned with policing their own kind.
"Which is what the grenades are for." Star-Lord joked, then said "I'm sorry, what's the favor?"
I made nicknames for certain Avengers:
"I am Groot." said Groot, who was feeling uneasy.
"How do you know he's not going for one of the other Stones?" asked Gamora.
But that is the ending to a very long story. To understand, one must learn that the Celestials, though powerful, preferred peace and merrier joys than the shedding of blood in fruitless battles. Their people have a penchant for love. One must know that, as the Midgardians say, love is a most powerful, but a fickle thing. It is a story for a different time, for the story of my death and the Shining Lord's love collides so beautifully...
"You seem to know a great deal about Thanos." said Thor.
"Sh*t." Tony cursed quietly, and then said "Steven Grant Rogers, possibly."
Iron Man walked past Dr. Strange, shaking his head and with his armor retreating into its containment as Dr. Strange got to his feet and donned the Cloak again. "We've gotta turn this ship around." the doctor insisted.
"And still conversely, it may also be his best chance against us." Tony retaliated.
"I didn't know what it was." said the Collector.
"Not me. Not here." Bruce told her.
"Oh, and I suppose you lot have been following the Dawn Bringer around looking for her fiance, him?"
"If we don't go to Knowhere and Thanos retrieves another stone, he'll be too powerful to stop." said Gamora.
"No!" cried Gamora as she was being dragged to the altar. She tried in vain to break from his grasp, much like she tried to pull free from the Blcack order knight so many years ago, but, pain showing clearly on his face, he threw her over the edge, and watched sorrowfully as she falls to her death. Light pulsed overhead as the sacrifice is correctly accomplished.
"What is your job exactly, besides making balloon animals?"
Palpatine:Who wants the first wager?
"Nobody, go away." The Moon Prince made the scariest faces he could to shoo them away, but his siblings just laughed, too used to his moods to be afraid.
"It isn't supposed to be." Suddenly, Vision's voice distorted electronically. "My systems are failing." Wanda used her magic to knit his wound back together. Vision continued in a gasping, wry tone, "I'm beginning to think...we should have stayed in bed."
The voice, vaguely familiar, continued. "$250,000. All that was needed for you to help Ross wreck many lives."
"What are you doing out of bed, baby? It's way past your time."
"Wanda, as soon as the stone's out of his head... you blow it to hell." Steve ordered.
"Uh, we don't do that here." T'Challa explained, and Bruce shot Rhodey a big grin. "So how big of an assault can we expect?" asked T'Challa as the group began to walk back into the administrative building.
"No. You simply lack the strength to wield them. Your bodies will crumble as your minds collapse into the madness." said Thor.
"Is that even possible?" asked Wanda.
"How we looking?" asked Natasha.
"On it!" Peter chased Ebony Maw, floating speedily and upright on a small platform of burbling debris leaving a deep rut in the streets, who in turn chases the Cloak-driven Strange through Manhattan; Maw attacked him, throwing a Rocket Mortgage billboard at Spider-Man to be rid of him.
"I told you. I sold it. Why would I lie?" the Collector rasped.
"Happy trails, kid. FRIDAY, send him home." Tony said. A large parachute extended from the new suit, snatching Spider-Man free of the ship's hull and him spiraling back to Earth.
Back at Nidavellir, Eitri was showing Thor, Rocket, and Groot the mold for Stormbreaker. "This is the plan? We're gonna hit him with a brick?" asked Rocket.
"Well, he's been dead before, but this time I think it really might be true." said Thor.
"Thor?" asked the giant, now identified as "Eitri".
2. Tony made the biggest mistake of his life by getting engaged to Pepper Potts.
"AH! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! PLEASE DON'T PUT YOUR EGGS IN ME!" cried Peter, then shot web at Mantis in a panic, pinning arms to her body just before Star-Lord flew at him feet-first, kicking him away.
"I didn't lose him. He's more than that. He's evolving."
"Dr. Banner, if the rest of your green friend won't be joining us..." said Strange, then he teleported Bruce to to a nearby park along with half a taxi. Tony returned and joins the fight, pushing a car thrown by Maw back at him. Maw cut it in half and let the pieces fly past him, untouched.
"I am Groot." said Groot.
Loki cheerfully emerged from behind the Black Order. " If I might interject…If you're going to Earth, you might want a guide. I do have a bit of experience in that arena."
"Gotta get that stone outta here, now." said the genius.
"If he gets all six Infinity Stones, he can do it with the snap of his fingers, like this." Gamora said as she snapped her fingers.
said Leyenar. She smiled as she told Peter
"Lost me!"
"Ant-Man." replied Steve.
. Universal scales tip toward balance because of your sacrifice. Smile..." Corvus Glaive stabbed one of the lingering Asgardians. For even in death, you have become Children of Thanos."
Pantie=Black Panther
Thanos' face expressed surprise briefly before he pressed the gauntlet to Thor's left temple. The Power Stone glowed brightly. Thor screamed hoarsely.
Palpatine:What?! Zero?
"Yeah, well, the hotels weren't exactly five-star." said Sam.
Suddenly, Leyenar yelled
"And what if you're wrong?" asked Rocket.
Blackie=Black Widow
"You said Thanos had a gauntlet, right?" said Rocket, looking at a pedestal.
"Expecting."
"Well, now, there's a four-dollar word. We just call it "Avenge Us"."
Palpatine:I think he's going to kill every last one of them except Ant-Man.
"No, Vision. Vision, if that's true…Then maybe going isn't the best idea." Wanda pleaded, then suddenly Corvus Glaive appeared behind Vision, stabbing him through the back. Vision screamed, loses his disguise to return to his green, red and gold appearance, and got thrown down into the street. Wanda, enraged, circled her hands, gathering up energy for a counterattack when Proxima Midnight blasted her from behind, knocking Wanda across the street and through a bistro's window.
Ego:And Yondu?
And so, thanks to Leyenar, the Avengers and the Guardians decided to work together.
she asked excitedly.
"What the...Wait, I recognize you." said Pepper, hearing the familiar voice.
"You really are the worst brother." said Thor.
"Might wanna use it." said Dr. Strange, bands of spells readied around his forearms.
"Don't do this." Gamora pleaded.
"Unlike everyone else in your life, I don't work for you." replied Strange.
"A small price to pay for salvation."
"One side is a revelation. The other, an honor known only to a few." said Maw. The girl whirled around and found herself facing Thanos in his full Titan armor.
"You should not be here." Tony told Peter.
feel." he said to her. Wanda gestured, her hand emanating her red swirling energy. She seemed confused.
he was now letting her take over. "You slutty, nasty, bossy high-maintenance—" she cursed, only to be cut short by Tony.
"Are you
Zod:What? He's adorable!
"Yeah, uh, speaking of loyalty..." Peter murmured. Tony, Leyenar and the Cloak turned to face him, dropping down from above.
Mimi=Captain Marvel
"And due to that fact, we're now in a flying doughnut billions of miles away from Earth with no backup." said Tony.
"He's trying to copy me." said Star-Lord.
"And what of this one?" asked Okoye.
"Slow down, slow down. I'm totally not kidding." said Tony.
Congratulations, Mr. Stark!
Palpatine:You just said Captain America three times!
replied Leyenar.
Thanos curled his gauntleted fist, activating both the Power and Space Stones, scowling—causing Nebula's already extended pieces to stretch further outward. She began to scream.
"What?" asked Star-Lord.
"Hang on, kid." said Iron Man. Black Dwarf's hammer doubled as a claw, pinning Tony to the ground and shorting his suit. As Dwarf jumped towards Tony, blades ready to end this fight, he got sent through a portal instead. The alien turned and leaps to return the same way, but Wong closed it rapidly—only Dwarf's severed hand made it back to the park. Bruce kicked the hand away with a noise of disgust.
"This boy, he shall be a great warrior, if he is to serve at the feet of the king."
“I hope to see you around, Tony.”
He handed Tony his mug before grabbing his own and walking to the couch. Tony followed him, taking a seat on the other side, a seat cushion between them.
But…he couldn’t. No. That would ruin his plan.
“Come on. I won’t show anyone else your drawings.”
A flashback to pre-time heist.
So Steve figures out who he likes. This is what unfolds after that revelation.
Steve sighed when he realized that this conversation wasn’t going to go anywhere. He held up his hands.
Hope that you enjoyed this chapter! Thank you for your continued support.
“No, it isn’t.” He sighed and rested the back of his head against his headboard. “The first time was before I knew that you were coming back. It had been about a week since the Snap and no one knew where you were except for that you had gone to space. Everyone assumed that you didn’t make it.”
He took a long swig of it. While he drank, the conversation thankfully shifted away from him. Not that it was really about him to begin with, but it was certainly nice to be out of the spotlight. He wasn’t used to talking about himself.
“Well, let me know if there’s anything I can do to help.”
“Really?”
“There’s nothing to apologize for.”
“I was happy to help.” Steve hugged her gently before releasing her. He stood up and took a step towards Tony so he was standing right next to the bed. “I’m glad that you’re okay, Tony.” He squeezed his shoulder – the one that wasn’t injured.
“Why would I lie about something like that?”
Tony kicked Thanos as he tried to pull the gauntlet away from him. The purple titan laughed at him and punched Tony’s chest, sending him flying into a large piece of debris that was lying against a tree.
“Okay. Thanks for organizing all of this,” Steve said, looking back at him.
The months went by slowly. With every month that passed, he thought that Tony would contact him, but he never did. Steve was beginning to think that Tony would never reach out to him. Steve had thought about contacting him, but the scene he made at the coffee shop still made him embarrassed. That conversation should have never happened. He had been a fool to bring it up. Or maybe he had been a fool for thinking that he could remain friends with Tony while he was in love with him. None of that mattered though. He couldn't take back what happened. All he could do was hope that Tony would come around.
“Which means a party.”
Tony turned his head to look at him.
He rocked back and forth on his heels, unsure of what to do. It was odd to be back here after being at the Avengers facility, with everyone. Even when they hadn’t been planning the mission, there always had been something to do. He had lived here longer than he had there over the last couple of years, but the place didn’t feel as much like home as it used to. But…it wasn’t like he had anywhere else to go now. The Avengers facility wasn’t standing anymore. Tony’s place was off-limits now that he had a family. Well, maybe it wasn’t, but he wouldn’t intrude on them, not now. Not to mention that he was still at the hospital. Frowning, he walked to his bedroom and shut the door behind him. He sat down on the bed and stared at the wall. He had spent the last day or so wanting to get out of the hospital that he didn’t really think of what he’d do once he got out of it. Sure, he knew that he wanted to rebuild the Avengers facility, but what was he supposed to do besides that?
He blinked and glanced at the coffee table, where Tony had been beginning to lay out a bunch of different boxes.
The answer should’ve made Steve feel lighter, happier. After all, he had found out the answer to Tony’s question. Unfortunately, the answer didn’t make him feel any better. Why should it? It was a person he couldn’t have. Twice in a row, he seemed to have waited too long for the person who he was interested in. He couldn't believe it. How could he have messed up
“Of course I did. But I thought that you deserved better.”
and all of the other Avengers. Steve smiled brightly at the brunette.
“It is?”
Tony shrugged. “I figured that since you’re hosting I’d bring over some food.”
“Well…I can’t say I was surprised when Pepper said that she wanted a divorce. We had been having problems for a while, even if I kept trying to salvage the situation.” He rubbed the back of his neck. “I’d say we started to have them after I invited you to pizza that day. Pepper had actually planned dinner for us all, but I forgot. Obviously I didn’t mean to forget, but I did. She told me that I was more focused on seeing you than spending time with her and Morgan.”
“It’s been a rough week…and apparently I need the sleep.”
“Don’t worry, I’m used to it. Now, are you going to join us?”
“Fine, fine. I’m glad that you guys could make it.”
“I can see that.”
“Yes…that’s right…and you are?”
There's more to tell about Steve and Tony's story, so there will be a sequel to this story. I hope to post the first chapter of that some time in July, so if you're interested in what happens next, keep an eye out for that!
“Are you just going to keep standing there?” Tony asked, gaze flicking up to Steve.
“Were you just tidying up?” Tony asked, raising an eyebrow.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Or tea – whichever one you like.”
“I can’t take this, Tony.”
Tony bit his lip. “Sorry…was that okay?” he asked.
“Near the end of the second year…yeah, I did. I was just, ah, worried that you wouldn’t want to hear from me.”
Steve took a step back and held up his hands.
“We won.”
“I think I – we- need some space. Until I get this under control. If this continues,” He gestured to Tony and himself. “…I don’t think this will get any better.”
A blush colored Steve’s cheeks at the sound of his name.
Steve smiled softly and started to carefully place the portrait within the frame, careful not to cause any creases in the paper. He pressed the back of the frame into place and held the portrait up to Tony, silently asking him what he thought of it.
Steve exhaled slowly and rolled his shoulders back. He could do this. It didn’t have to be perfect, it just had to be close to that. Nodding to himself, Steve picked up a pencil and began to shade.
“I came down here about ten minutes ago,” Steve replied. “Tea?”
“Ah, they’ll be fine for a few more minutes.” He took a step closer to him. “I actually came out here because I wanted to ask you to coffee.”
“I…well, most people I’ve talked to don’t like the readings that we have to do.”
“Tony, what is it?”
The next day, Steve was finally released. When he woke up from his nap after visiting Tony, Natasha and Bucky had visited him. They had spent several hours talking about the battle and what was going to happen now that they had reversed the Snap. Steve told them that he had no idea what he was going to do. He could go back to being an Avenger, but he wasn’t sure if the Avengers would be needed for any missions for a while now that Thanos was defeated. Maybe he’d try to do more art like he always wanted to do; he wasn’t sure.
Steve knew that he had helped, but he wasn’t the one who had put the gauntlet on. He wasn't the one who decided to put his life at risk at that moment. Sure, he was unconscious right before then so he couldn't have done it, but still. Silence fell over them for a few seconds before Tony spoke up again.
Yes, but not with other people. Well. He walked with Bucky, but they were roommates. That was to be expected. But with other people? Especially Tony? At 10 o’clock at night? No, that didn’t happen. Ever.
“Come on, Steve. Just for an hour.”
He hit the send button before he could change his mind about what he sent.
Steve bit his lip. It wasn’t that, either. This just seemed…well, random. Looking over the last few months though, Tony had been acting a bit different than usual. Sometimes he wanted to spend time with Steve and then other times, Tony didn't seem interested at all in him. Steve never knew what side of Tony he was going to get. Apparently, today, Steve was getting the former version of him.
“I told you when I was there to let Tony take the lead – that’s what he’s doing,” Bucky said.
“I-I’m sorry, I was just…taking a walk.”
People clapped as Happy took a step back next to Steve. The blonde opened his mouth to ask him if he should say something, but then closed it when he realized that something was happening. The crowd parted; people murmured amongst themselves. Heads turned to see what all of the fuss was about. Steve took a step forward, trying to see what or who the others were looking at. A few seconds later, Tony broke through the crowd. Steve's gaze roamed over him; he was wearing a navy blue suit with a white button-down shirt that had the first two buttons undone. Steve stared at him, his lips pressed together in a tight line. So, he had decided to come without telling him that he was coming.
The waitress brought over their pizzas, placing one in front of each of them. Steve thanked her before she left them alone. They each started on their pizzas; silence fell over the table. Eventually, once they had eaten a bit, the conversation started back up again, but this time they talked about other things like books, movies, and other things that they hadn’t talked about in a while. As the conversation progressed, Steve felt himself relaxing, even smiling at some points. He had missed this – being just with Tony, away from the Avengers and functions.
“You did before. Remember?”
Finally, he mustered the courage to glance in the room. One of the people who was sitting on the couch stood up. It was a guy. He was wearing a suit. A suit. Who on earth wore a suit to this type of thing?
“I do,” Steve finally said after several moments.
Tony held up his hand and stared Thanos down.
“No, it wasn’t.”
. “I’d start with that one first.”
This is a flashback chapter taking some time after the Battle of New York.
Steve swore under his breath. He couldn’t believe that he had finally said that aloud. To Tony. He glanced down at his lap again.
His art had to be put on hold for the next week because he was busy helping build the facility. Well. Build may have been the wrong word. Supervise would be more correct. He had wanted to help lay the foundation of the building, but Happy refused. Instead he charged Steve with making sure the materials they needed were there and helped plan some of the interior of the facility. It was going to be very similar to the old one, but this one was going to be bigger, and those who worked for the Avengers would be in a separate building than the Avengers. The Avengers would have their own training and living quarters. That way business and life could be more separate. When one of the architects proposed this idea, Steve immediately signed off on it. He wasn’t sure still what his future plans were, but he thought the Avengers would like this change. Not having their own space had always been a complaint before Thanos attacked.
He stared at her, lips parted. He couldn’t believe that he had been out for that long.
Tony glanced around the room and shrugged off his leather jacket; he wore a red t-shirt underneath. He folded it in half and placed it on the back of the couch.
“Now you’re staring. Are you going to keep staring? If so, I’ll at least pose for you.”
Steve canted his head to the side. “Captain America voice?”
“Later today, hopefully. If not today, tomorrow morning.”
Thank you for your continued support! I hope that you enjoyed this chapter.
“I didn’t feel like making anything else. I'm making a BLT, do you want one?” Steve opened the pantry and took out a loaf of bread.
Tony shrugged. “You’re just always prepared.”
The first two weeks were the hardest. He’d do something like cook a new meal or draw something and the next thing he knew, he was opening his and Tony's text conversation, wanting to tell him about it. Sometimes he would write out a message to Tony, but he’d delete it before he could send it. During those first two weeks, Steve actually turned his phone off a few times so he wasn’t as tempted to contact Tony. He would've turned his phone off more, but Natasha had contacted him and told him that she had been worried about him because he hadn't been answering his phone. After that, he made sure that his phone was on at all times. He decided that he'd just try to pretend that his phone was off so he wouldn’t call or text Tony. Eventually, it became easier to not talk to Tony. He was be able to use his phone and not feel the pull to text him. Of course, he still wanted to, but he could ignore that desire.
Steve blushed and looked down. “I wasn’t sure where else to sit, so I decided to sit here.”
He pulled on the rope and the curtain swept to the side, revealing four pieces of art work that lined the wall horizontally. The first piece was of the Avengers sitting in the living room of Avengers Tower, each of them doing something different. Clint was practicing throwing darts with Natasha. Bruce was reading a science book on the couch. Thor was fiddling with a guitar that Tony had bought recently. Tony and Steve sat on the couch, books on their laps, heads turned towards each other.
“The kiss was good, but...I don't think it can mean anything." He winced at how that sounded. "I mean, I don't think that it can mean anything at the moment. I know that you and Pepper are over…but you don’t seem to be over the divorce yet."
He shrugged off his jacket before he sat down on the chair. Steve couldn’t help it – he stared a bit. Tony was wearing a blue button-down shirt that hugged his arms in a way that clothing shouldn’t be able to. And the thing that made it worse was, Steve had sworn that he, himself, had worn a similar type of shirt on the first day of class this year. Had Tony copied his look, too? Or took inspiration from it? The thought made Steve's mouth turn up to a faint smile.
“I’m glad that you talked to him, Tony…he felt awful for what he did, even if it wasn’t him.”
[Because you were trying to be nice? –Steve]
After the fourth art class, Steve knew that he had made the right decision. The people seemed standoffish at first, but once they all started sharing their drawings with each other, everyone seemed to open up. Even Steve seemed to open up; he talked about what inspired his drawings and about being part of the Avengers. He hadn’t planned on talking about the Avengers, but…well, it just seemed to happen. His classmates would listen to him, too, which surprised him. He wasn’t sure if they were just listening because they wanted to know the scoop about the Avengers, or because they were genuinely interested. Maybe it was a bit of both.
What happens after their first date.
One minute. Two minutes. Three minutes passed. Steve stared at Tony, wondering if he ever was going to speak. If he wasn’t…well, he’d want a cue so he could just leave. And never bother him again. He opened his mouth to speak, but he was cut off before he could.
“I’m sorry, Tony…I didn’t mean to make you upset.”
Nodding, Steve left the lab and went to his bedroom. His lips spread into a smile; he couldn’t wait to discuss the book with him, especially since he didn’t think Tony would want to talk about it today. He tidied up his bedroom a bit, wanting it to look nice for him. He doubted that Tony would care, but he did. By the time he was finished, Tony appeared in his doorway, book in hand.
“Are any of them burnt?” Tony asked, raising an eyebrow.
Steve and Tony go on their first official date.
“What, professor?” Steve asked, looking at his professor with wide eyes.
“That was clear. It’s just - Tony, even if you’re not in love with her anymore, you’re still not over the divorce. You’re blaming yourself for it. That's why you blamed me earlier. I don’t think it’s a good idea for us to start anything – which is what I assume you want to do – while you’re still blaming yourself for what happened.”
The blonde asked him.
He thought about dodging the question again – Steve hadn’t actually shown Tony his art or talked about it that often, so he wasn’t quite sure if he wanted to start now. It was clear that Tony wouldn’t make fun of him for it, but Steve didn’t like showing his drawings to people. His art was personal, it was part of him, in a way. But…he didn’t want to lie to Tony. He did that once and he promised that he wouldn’t do it again. Even if it was something silly like if he was taking an art class or not.
“Good pick, old sport,” Tony replied, smirking.
Steve sighed softly. One drink couldn’t hurt.
“Nat has a point, Steve.”
Steve, finally, broke free of his little trance.
“You too, Buck." He glanced at Natasha. "I'll check up with you later?"
Tony’s gaze roamed over Steve’s face, as if trying to figure out if he was lying to him. He sighed and stood up. He walked over to Steve, making Steve pause. Tony smiled softly up at him.
Just like Steve had predicted, he arrived at Tony’s place at exactly 7. He rang the doorbell before running a hand through his hair, smoothing it out. The door opened; Tony stood on the other side, smirking at him. This time, Tony was wearing dark jeans and what Steve assumed to be a t-shirt of some band. The other night Tony had said that he was very interested in music, especially ‘older’ bands.
He took a sip of his drink.
Tony opened his mouth to say something else, but Happy walked into the hall. He glanced at the two of them.
“I thought I’d swing by to see how everything is unfolding,” Tony said, sliding his sunglasses into his hair.
“You know, Tony has texted me,” Bucky said.
“Really? I thought you’d be glad to be rid of me.”
He wanted to engage in a certain conversation, but he knew that he couldn’t rush Tony into it. Besides, he didn’t even know what Tony would say; he was just assuming that he wanted to say something positive. If it was bad…maybe it was best for him not to know quite yet. The pair ate in silence, each of them enjoying their meal. Sometimes Steve felt Tony’s gaze on him and he blushed softly, not used to the scrutiny.
“You’ll see in about two seconds.”
“I’ll be right back."
“Really?”
“Who said I’d do that?” Steve asked, tilting his head to the side.
“Good decision,” Tony said, winking.  ‘So, how has the term been treating you so far?”
Steve nodded. “I had no idea who I wanted to be with. But then Tony went to the gala and he asked me whether or not I was seeing anyone. I told him that I wasn't and he seemed surprised. Like...really surprised." He rubbed the back of his neck. "He asked me if I was waiting for someone but I couldn’t answer because it was time for me to give my closing speech so I had to cut the conversation short. But I kept thinking about his question. It confused me…but then I realized that I was waiting for someone.” Steve cleared him throat and looked at Bucky.
Well, that was a very good question. The answer to which Steve was still trying to figure out himself. He didn't know how it happened, exactly. All he knew was that it did.
“And what’s that?” Steve asked, pacing in his living room.
Steve huffed. But he didn’t want to wait. He had to talk to Tony now.
Here's the next chapter! It's slightly longer than the other chapters.
“Okay – do you want me to come over your place again? Or do you want to come to mine?” Even though there was nothing wrong with asking that, Steve’s cheeks turned a light pink. He glanced at the chalkboard.
“What can I get you?”
“I know that you said that I didn’t have to bring anything but I felt like it would be rude to not bring anything. So…I got this. It has sausage and onion on it.”
“No, it isn’t fine.”
Multiple lights that looked like chandeliers hung from the ceiling. Wooden panels lined the walls. Along the farthest wall, a podium and a white table-clothed table sat. In front of that table, there were rows of tables that faced it. A bar lined the right wall. Along the other wall, there was a table with gift baskets. That was where the guests would make silent bids for the gifts. Most of the money raised from the gift baskets would go go to local charities in the city. The other money would go towards the facility. All gifts were provided by Stark Industries.
The crowd erupted into applause. Steve smiled at the crowd and he made his way to his seat at the table. Some people got up from their seats and went over to the gift baskets. Happy turned to him.
“That’s true. It just won’t be here as soon as I’d like it.”
“Yes…I know that. You just…didn’t have to do that.”
“Go ahead.”
“You’re the one who’s hosting…it's proper etiquette to bring food.”
“What do you mean?”
Despite how well their relationship was going, they still had not publicly announced it. There were rumors that they were a couple, of course, but they ignored those. When paparazzi showed up at Tony’s or Steve’s apartment building, they just walked past them without comment. The pair wasn't afraid of going public, but they didn’t want to be under the public eye more than they already were. They also liked having this part of their life private, away from prying eyes. It allowed them to fully focus on their relationship, not the public's perception of their relationship. They were going to go public eventually, but they wanted to right for the right moment, if there was such a thing.
“Whatever you prefer.”
The brunette nodded but didn’t say anything. Steve knew that he probably didn’t need to say anything more, but he couldn’t stop himself from rambling on.
Tony pivoted towards Steve and pointed at him.
(See the end of the chapter for
“You know that’s not what I mean, Tony-”
shocking, Tony.”
“I am inevitable,” he said, smirking. “You cannot stop this.”
“Sorry I’m late, Happy,” Steve said.
He licked his lips.
Tony’s gaze flitted to his face. “No, I want you to talk about it.”
“That you need to get out! You can’t spend all night watching the cooking network.”
“Of course. It’s a little dull, but there are worse books out there.”
[That’d be the correct answer. –Stark.]
“What is it?”
“It’s done.”
“So, I was thinking about our project.”
Tony raised an eyebrow. “No drink? Really?”
“We’ll definitely get the highest mark in the class,” Tony said, glancing at Steve.
“Good evening,” the crowd repeated.
“Yeah, well. It can't be too surprising, can it?”
“I know that…but Happy told me that you weren’t coming, so I just thought that you weren’t. I thought that you had more important things to do.”
“Y-yes,” Steve managed to say a few seconds later. “I’d like to give us a try, too.”
(See the end of the chapter for
The man’s eyes widened a bit as if he was offended by the question. Should he know who he is?
The corner of Steve’s mouth twitched. “Really?”
“I’m sorry.”
Tony stayed a little bit after that conversation. Tony asked Steve how he was doing and what he has been up to the past months besides going to the site. Steve asked Tony how Stark Industries was going and if he had created any new inventions. The conversation flowed smoothly, as if they hadn’t just spent six months without talking to each other.
After a few hours, Steve left the room to head on home. He wanted to stay longer, actually, but he was exhausted. As he walked down the hall though, he heard someone call after him.
“Mind if I sit here, then? Or were you saving it for someone special?” He winked at him.
Tony smirked and gestured to himself.
“Definitely.”
The corners of Tony’s mouth turned upwards. “Hey, what are friends for?”
Tony nodded and sat down in the chair. Steve handed him the extra water bottle he had taken out for him.
Thank you for sticking with the story if you're reading this chapter! Hope you like it. ^_^
Tony smirked and got out of the car. “Well, that’s why I’m here. To lend my services, if you still need them.”
Steve pursed his lips. He wanted to say that he was sorry, but that was such an overused statement. He said something else instead.
"Are you sure you don't want to talk about it?"
Tony grinned at him. “Good, I’m glad.”
Tony’s smile widened. “Well, I wouldn’t expect anything else.” He clapped his hands together and walked into Steve’s apartment.
“I’m sure that they are good.”
“He’s fine, Steve. A little banged up, but besides that, fine.”
Minutes passed before Steve spoke. He kept opening his mouth, hoping that would help him start talking, but it didn't. It just made him feel like a fool. He glared at the edge of the island. This shouldn’t be so difficult to talk about. Finally, after a few more moments, the words seemed to want to come out.
“Okay. I guess I could, then. Perhaps on Friday?”
seemed to like the drawing that day. Surely he would like it now that Steve had completed it. Those thoughts didn’t stop Steve from pacing in the hall in front of his front door, though. Steve nearly jumped upon hearing someone knock on the door. Swearing, he walked over to the door and opened it.
“You do know that was a joke, right?”
From there, the conversation seemed to wander on smoothly. They talked about the Avengers facility, sports, weather, and a bunch of other things. Steve hadn’t realized how much time had passed until the alarm on his phone went off. He had put it on just in case he forgot when he had to begin his speech. His face paled when he saw the time. Oh…no. It was that time already? He glanced over his shoulder; Happy was standing near the podium, waving him over. Steve turned back to his friends.
“Ah, right. Follow me.” He grabbed the water bottles he had left on the counter – he had left out two just in case Tony wanted one  and led him to the living room, where an easel was set up in front of the coffee table. “You can sit wherever you want…the couch…the recliner…wherever.”
“Yeah…I’m sure that she will,” he said. He cleared his throat. “Anyways…do you want that pizza now?”
“And then we got a call from Bruce- he called us using the phone I gave you.” He bit his lip. “So we decided to go back here and we figured out a plan. After that we went to Wakanda…and well, you know the rest.”
A few moments later, the door opened. Tony was wearing a black t-shirt with the letters “AC-DC” on the front. He was wearing faded jeans. An outfit that Steve had never seen before. He tried to pry his eyes away from him, but he couldn’t. There was something about the clothing that just…suited Tony.
“On one hand, I want to call you a fool,” Bucky said.
Steve glanced around the room before his gaze settled back on his childhood friend.
“Are you normally this averse to conversation?” Tony asked, raising an eyebrow.
Tony took another sip of his drink. “Me too. Otherwise I would’ve missed this champagne.”
Even though Tony had said similar things before, it hurt more this time. To know that he created the pain in Tony’s eyes made his stomach churn, made his heart feel as though someone threw knives into it.
“I know. As I said though, I’m not upset that you told me. I was just upset that night because I felt guilty for having feelings for you - it was a month after the divorce, and I was already to move on.”
“I suppose that’s fair.” Tony’s gaze flicked to him. “Can we at least talk – like friends- in the meantime?”
Smiling a little to himself, Steve got back up and headed to the kitchen to make himself a late lunch. Yeah, he could definitely adapt.
Tony’s turned towards him. A bruise was painted across his right cheek; a cut marked the side of his mouth. The arm that had wielded the gauntlet was on top of the covers, in a sling. Steve’s gaze roamed over his injuries. Somehow, Tony didn’t seem this bad the night of the battle. Seeing him like this made Steve’s stomach churn.
The man turned around and looked up at him. “We’re just getting started, Cap. No need to apologize. I was telling everyone to go look for any personal items we can put those in bins before we start clearing the rubble.”
“I know,” Steve said, cutting him off. He didn’t need to hear him say the words. “I don’t expect you to.”
“You weren’t lying,” Tony breathed.
“Fine. It isn’t important. Well…since you know complementary colors, I take it that you like art?”
The bartender nodded and grabbed a bottle from the other side of the bar. He handed it to him and Steve mumbled his thank before turning around to go back to his table. But something stopped him. Well, actually, a person stopped him. Everything that had been on his mind seemed to vanish. It wasn’t important. Not really, anyways. Steve blinked, not quite believing what he was seeing:
And, as soon as the kiss had started, it had stopped. Tony pulled away and grinned at Steve.
“Why did you text Bucky?”
“Well…I made it for you. May as well take it.”
“Your time travel attempt didn’t work?”
Here's the next chapter! Hope that you like it.
Steve almost wanted to tell Tony to say that again, because he was certain that he hadn’t heard him right. Pepper and him couldn’t have gotten a divorce. All of this was to
“You’ve been studying for the past 3 hours; you need a break.”
“Even after we have spent many hours together?”
“Is this because of-”
Tony blinked and glanced through the window. “An art gallery?” He looked at Steve.
Tony nodded. “Yes. I was upset with you, but I didn’t know if I would ever need you, so I kept it with me.”
He missed him more than he could probably ever express to the man. Even their bickering, he had missed. Before Tony could respond, Steve put his mug on the table and wrapped his arms around Tony, pulling him close to him. He buried his head into the crook of his neck like he used to, before all of this, and wrapped his arms more tightly around him.
“Well…thank you, Tony.”
“N-nice to meet you,” Steve stammered. His cheeks turned a bright pink.
Bucky finished off his beer. “I’m not trying to make you feel better. All I’m saying is that…let Tony figure out what he wants.”
“I just have to go.” Steve took out a few dollars and placed them on the table. He went to stand up, but Tony grabbed his arm.
Hearing Tony talk about this made Steve’s stomach churn. He knew that what happened in Wakanda wasn’t his fault, but he felt like it
“I’ve been better. It’s not pleasant to have the energy of six infinity stones rush through your body.”
“Yeah?”
(See the end of the chapter for
He picked up the scissors that were placed on the podium before moving over to the ribbon. Tony padded over to him so he was standing next to him. The scissors were quite large, so both of them could hold them – Steve held one side while Tony held the other. Together, they cut the ribbon. Applause erupted; clicks of cameras could be heard.
Since Tony wanted to meet at night as opposed to the middle of the day, Steve assumed that he had good news to share. Of course, he didn’t know for certain, but Steve didn’t know why Tony would want to meet at night if he only had bad news to share. Steve was just putting the finishing touches on their dinner when there was a knock on the door. Steve smiled softly to himself and wiped his hands on a kitchen towel. He padded over to the door, his heart thundering in his chest. Steve opened the door; his eyes widened upon seeing the man who was standing on the other side of it.
The memory brought a smile to Steve’s face. Now, hopefully, Tony would never have to ask this question again; he would know that Steve trusted him, no matter what happened between them.
“And we will! But not right now.”
Tony had told him to arrive at 5, but he was a few minutes early. He tried to be late, actually – he was dreading this – but he arrived early anyways. Guess his tendency to be early was engrained in him.
The message was sent by Tony. Steve sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose. After a few minutes, he typed out his reply.
“So,” Tony began.
Tony turned around and looked at the frame; he nodded. “I like it a lot.”
Tony waved his hand. “No need to thank me.”
Steve's eyebrows knitted together as he thought about the question, which had caught him a bit off guard. His first thought was no, that there wasn’t anyone that he had his eyes on. But, that didn’t seem quite right. It was as if he felt like there was someone that he was interested in. Steve wasn't sure though, if he was interested in someone, who that person would be.
Nodding, Steve grabbed another mug from the cabinet and put it on the counter. Not knowing what to say, he focused his gaze on his feet. Despite the fact that they had made up about a week ago, things had still been awkward between the two of them. He supposed that things were less awkward than they had been…but things still weren’t back to the way things used to be, prior to the Avengers splitting up. They weren’t the way Steve wanted them to be. Maybe that was silly of him to think, but since they had made up, the blonde thought that was a reasonable thing to want. After a few moments of silence, Steve looked at Tony, who was staring at a space near Steve’s feet.
“Well, you don’t have to have any, then,” Tony replied, smirking. “More for me.”
“Tony…I know why you didn’t call me. I’m just saying…I thought I’d never be home again.” He gestured around them. “It’s nice to be back.”
“Tony, what's wrong?”
Tony sighed deeply. “You were.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Thanks for reading!
Maybe it had been a mistake to send Tony that – he’d probably find it creepy. He had told him to send him one of his drawings, not a drawing of him.
“You are all adults. I expect that you’ll be able to work with anyone that you’re assigned to. After all, when you’re in court, you may not mesh well with your client, but you will have to work with them to complete a goal.”
Steve laughed at that. Tony? Easily captured? Not at all. Tony was one of the most complicated people he knew. But who he was deep down…he supposed that was easily to convey when he drew him.
“Well…were you going to?”
“Well, you’re supposedly the smartest person around here, so why don’t you guess.”
“Well…I like to paint, but I really like to draw. Anything, really. When I was in college I used to sit around campus and draw the different buildings. They weren’t very good drawings…but I enjoyed working on them.”
Tony looked at him, really looked at him. Steve hadn’t seen him look at him like that in well…ages. It was the look Tony used to get when he surprised him. The brunette’s facial expression softened.
“You…thought…that I didn’t like you? Weren’t going to like you?”
Steve forced his legs to work again. He ran across the field, sprinting as quickly as he could. Five yards away -
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony nodded. “Nat made that abundantly clear. He did, too.”
Tony squeezed Steve’s shoulder. “I don’t want you to redraw it. I’m sure the final product will be great…it’s already great.” Tony’s gaze bore into Steve’s. “I can’t wait to see the final picture. Really.” Steve wasn’t sure how many seconds passed, but it felt like ages. He couldn't stop gazing at Tony. For a split second, Steve glanced towards Tony’s lips and stared at them. He didn’t mean to – he was just so close. A foot away from him. Maybe less. Tony dropped his hand from Steve’s shoulder; he smiled softly. “Pepper is going to love it.”
"It doesn't mean anything to you but I've always wanted to be able to live from my art and I needed a new place and I... You're
Steve dropped his head on his chest and grabbed the lapels of his jacket. He buried his head onto his shirt. "I can't, babe." He whined. "I really can't."
When will he ever understand that you can't say no to Tony Stark?
Tony sighed and wiggled away from under Steve. "Fuck you, Rogers!" He growled. "Three fucking minutes! You barely held on three minutes! I can't believe you just did that to me."
He raises his head and stares into Clint's eyes. "You really think Steve'd like that?" There is half a second of puzzlement in Clint's eyes before he grins widely. Tony tries to mirror his grin and snatches the joint from his hand. He takes a long drag before handing it back to him and turns his head to blow the smoke out of his way. "Maybe we should try new things."
“Then what is it, then?”
He glanced at the time as he wandered through the kitchen to a hall. 10:30pm. He still had a whole other half an hour to go. He would just leave, but he had promised Bucky on the way over to the party that he’d stay for at least an hour. After walking for a few moments, he stopped at a room where the door was half open. Some music – jazz music, if he was correct – came from the room. He peeked in, his gaze quickly taking in the room. A few people were sitting on the couch, laughing. Steve frowned – he didn’t know any of these people.
Steve shook his head.
Tony’s gaze broke away from the art piece that he had been staring at and settled on Steve.
“Really? Then what’s the point of taking an art class?”
The plan didn’t exactly make Steve happy, but it was the best plan that he had.
“As of now, yes. My calculations may change though. I’ll let you know if they do.” Tony made his way back the car and opened the door. “I appreciate you doing this Steve, really, I do. Anyways…I have to run. I’ll see you again soon.”
“N-nothing. Let's get started.”
Steve glanced at the people on the couch again. To his surprise, they weren’t staring at him. Yes, they were looking at him, but they didn’t look at him as if he had just committed some serious crime.
“I love it.”
He brushed passed a few people that were standing in front of the curtain, waiting for the big reveal. Steve’s breathing started to pick up; his palms began to sweat. Maybe this was a bad idea of a first date. A movie would have been a lot less nerve-wracking. He glanced at Tony, whose gaze was still on the curtain. Steve's mouth twitched as he watched him. This man had come here because he trusted Steve; he had accompanied him without knowing anything about tonight. If Tony could do that…well, he could do this. He leaned over so he could speak into Tony’s ear without others overhearing.
“Oh, Steve,” he said, shutting the book. “Finally discharged?”
Steve made his way around the room, making sure that every spot at a table was set with plates and utensils. Once he was sure that the room was set correctly, he returned to the lobby. He cleared his throat.
“I told her that wasn’t true, but now in hindsight…I guess it was true.” Tony bit his lip and glanced at Steve. “Anyways, things got worse when I invited you to the Stark Industries event. She didn’t mind you being invited, but she thought that I shouldn’t have had you sit next to me. She thought that you should’ve sat at another table. That's what we were arguing about that day. She kept telling me that I was focusing more on you than her. Again, I told her that I wasn’t. But after that day at the coffee shop, I guess I became miserable to be around. I didn’t think that I had been until Morgan asked me if something was wrong. She asked me that because apparently I had seemed sad. I tried to act happier around her because I didn’t want her to worry about me, but that didn’t stop the arguments between Pepper and me- we started to fight almost every day. We tried marriage counseling, but that didn’t work. Obviously.” He gestured to his ring finger that didn’t have a ring on it anymore. “About two weeks after our last counseling session, Pepper said that she wanted a divorce; she said that my heart clearly wasn’t in our relationship anymore and that she didn’t think it ever would be again. I guess I loved her, but I wasn’t
“You don’t have to walk me to the door,” Tony stated, pulling away from Steve.
“Let’s give it a shot – this whole…” He waved his hand around; the corner of his mouth twitched upwards. “…being friends thing.”
Steve’s tongue felt thick in his mouth. “Of course,” he forced himself to say as calmly as he could.
“Really? I had no idea. You’re here now though, so you might as well stick around a bit. Better than walking around the apartment like you’re lost.”
Steve bit his lip as the car pulled up to a familiar driveway. Unlike other times though, the driveway was full of news vans and cars. He glanced at Tony, a question in his eyes.
“What I’m saying is…you don’t need to do anything. You keep doing whatever you doing. But you also wait and see – maybe Tony will come around.”
Steve’s cheeks warmed; his gaze flicked to his feet.
“Will do,” Steve mumbled, even though Tony had already left. He glanced around the room, noticing how there weren’t a lot of pictures of Tony with his family on the walls. Huh. That was...interesting. That’s none of your business, Steve chastised himself. He forced his gaze back to his lap and took out a notebook. While he waited, he doodled on the side of a page.
Oh. Steve…hadn’t been expecting that.
Tony nodded just as the tea kettle went off. Steve padded over to the kettle and turned it off. He poured the water into each mug and put a tea bag in for each of them– chamomile for him and –
“I was going to get the sausage and pineapple pizza.” Steve made a face. “Really? That combination is that bad?”
Steve didn’t look up as the car pulled away from him, driving back the way it came.
“Who says that you have to do anything?” Bucky asked, tilting his head to the side.
A lump formed in Steve’s throat. “Don’t worry about it. You’re my friend…I couldn’t let you do it alone.”
“Are you sure?”
“Come on, that was a mistake…I had just been out of the ice for a short amount of time, I wasn’t used to cooking again.”
Steve grabbed a bottle of beer and slid it across the counter. He went back to the little work station that he had set up and took out a a few slices of bread.
Steve shrugged. "Just thought it'd be nice to have a change of scenery."
“Tony…,” Steve began, voice wavering slightly. “I don’t think we can do that again.”
“I don’t know, Buck.”
He rolled his eyes. He didn’t need sleep, didn’t want sleep. He could sleep later. His body seemed to think differently, though; a few minutes later, Steve slipped off into a dreamless sleep.
“Thank you, Tony…for doing this. I appreciate it.”
“Hey, that was different. You were able to see your surroundings. I, on the other hand, cannot see.”
“Steve, you didn’t cause this.
Tony nodded and glanced at the television; the news was playing. The news reporter was talking about families were reuniting after the Vanished had returned.
“Excuse me!” he yelled over the dim of the crowd. The conversations almost immediately quieted. “The Avengers Gala is ready to begin. You may make your way to the Grand Ballroom whenever you want.”
Steve didn’t have much time to dwell on that because Tony jolted him out of his thoughts.
“Shut up,” Steve mumbled. “You know that you were ranked the highest in our level.”
“My name is Steve Rogers and we’re here tonight to try to raise money for a building that was destroyed a couple of months ago.” He paused; everyone was still looking at him. “The Avengers facility was a place where the Avengers not only trained, but it was what they called home in between missions. It was a place where the Avengers were able to learn more about each other and become a family of sorts. I’ve spent the last couple of months working with a team from Stark Industries and some other Avengers to clear the land so it will be possible to build a new facility, one that the Avengers can call home again.”
“Tony,” Steve said, his voice barely audible. He wiped his eyes again. “You didn’t have to come here if this is how you felt.” It was probably a dumb thing to say seeing as Tony decided to help out with the mission, but he didn’t know what else to say.
Tony got up and walked over to where Steve was sitting. He glanced at the canvas; his eyes widened just a bit.
“Yes, really.” He took a sip of water. “You seem surprised.”
Well, that didn’t reassure him in any way. If everything was okay, talking wouldn’t be necessary. But...maybe he wanted to talk about what happened between them. There was no other reason for him to contact him. He licked his lips and typed out another message.
“Do you want me to strip?”
“Is everything okay?”
Steve’s cheeks grew warm.
“They’re comfortable,” Steve mumbled. He led Tony over to the little studio that he had set up in the living room. “Anyways…thanks for coming over. Did you want something to drink? Or eat?”
Steve shrugged. What he thought wasn’t important. People always eventually left him anyways. So, he must be uninteresting.
Again, Tony shrugged. He gestured away from the room, towards a hallway. “Shall we continue? The other guests should be here in a few minutes.”
Steve glanced at Tony, who was watching the waitress put their orders in the computer.
“Thank you again, Steve.”
“A whiskey would be good.”
Once he had made his rounds, he made his way to the bar for a drink. He paused when he saw a woman with red hair and a man with brown hair talking at the corner of the bar. The woman wore a white dress that cascaded down to her feet. The man was wearing a black tuxedo with a white shirt under it with a green tie.
Steve sighed and looked in front of him. The bartender walked over to him.
The next hour or so was much calmer. Dinner was served and people seemed to talk amongst themselves. Bucky, Natasha, and Sam sat near him so he spent most of the time talking to them. They congratulated him on his speech and told him that they’d be surprised if this function wasn't a success. Steve wasn’t sure about that, but he turned the conversation away, deciding to talk about other things instead - like movies and tv shows. Those were simple topics, but no one seemed to mind.
“When you finish it, we can compare notes.” Tony grinned at him.
Steve’s stomach churned; he hadn’t thought that Tony would hit so close to the truth. Especially since he had tried to make some conversation with him last term. But he guessed all of that conversation had been shallow, nothing of real importance. Sure, they had some ‘deeper’ conversations, but Steve had rarely talked during those conversations.
to leave but he had told Tony that he would come, so he wasn’t going to go back on what he said. Technically he had fulfilled that statement, but he still thought leaving early like this just because he hadn’t seen Tony yet wasn’t the right thing to do. The blonde sighed and sat back in his chair; yes, he wasn’t going to leave. At least not yet.
“What are you going to get?” Tony asked.
A few hours later, Steve was still sitting on the couch, but the page wasn’t blank anymore. He smiled widely at his work before setting the sketchbook on the table and pulling out his phone. Leaning over the table, he snapped a picture.
He attached the picture to the text and sent it before he could think more about it. He had drawn a picture of Tony sitting outside of the compound, near the lake. It wasn’t a perfect copy of the moment – Steve had been looking for him at the time and had found him reading in a chair near the lake, but he thought it was pretty close. He wasn’t sure why he decided to draw this, but while he was drawing it, it felt right. Perhaps it was because, well, Tony had been on his mind.
“You left me to handle Thanos on my own – without you. We didn’t battle together like you promised.”
Tony walked into the apartment, closing the door behind him.
“If you insist,” he teased.
Steve put his hand out; Tony stared at it for a moment before shaking it. He turned on his heel and gestured for Steve to follow him to the trunk. He popped it open and took something that Steve had thought that he would never see again: his shield. A lump formed in his throat.
“Could…er, you ask me questions instead?”
Tony was wearing black pants with a fitted green t-shirt and a leather jacket. His hair was sticking up a little in the front in typical Tony Stark fashion. Unlike last time though, the dark circles under his eyes were gone. A smile played at Tony’s lips.
Not being able to text Tony was probably the hardest thing for Steve to get used to. Tony and him had gone through lulls without texting each other before, but that was different. One time was because they had a falling out and the other time was because Tony had just not texted that much. The fact that they could text each other but chose not to was the hardest thing for him. Steve kept wanting to ask Tony how he was doing or show him a new art piece that he had made but he knew that he couldn’t. If he did, he knew that he’d want to see him again. And if he saw him again, he’d be right back to where he started.
“That’s the story, anyways,” Tony said.
“Yeah…I like capturing people’s facial expressions. Or the way they look in that moment.”
Steve frowned at him; just like that, the distance was back between them. Just like that, it seemed like they were when Steve had gone to his house, practically begging him to help them.
“Great.” Tony beamed at him. “You can pick the place…just text me the details and I’ll be there.” He winked at Steve and turned around, padding back up the stairs to where the ballroom was.
About a week later, Steve had barely heard anything from Tony. Tony had texted him when he got discharged, but that was it. There were no “we should get together” or “let’s meet so we can go over the plans for the new Avengers facility” messages. Steve tried not to let the lack of texts get to him, but he couldn’t help it. He knew that Tony had a family, but he thought that he would at least want to stay in contact with Steve. Maybe Steve had been misreading things, though. Maybe they were friends, but not nearly as close as Steve thought that had become. Steve bit his lip as he landed another punch onto the punching bag.
The blonde glanced at him. “Give what a try?”
“Well, I must have been a terrible host then,” Steve said; he hadn’t walked any of his guests out when he had hosted the Avengers event.
“Really?”
A week later, Steve found himself back at the Avengers facility. Well, what had been the Avengers facility. There was nothing left of it now. Nothing. Thanos had completely demolished the place. The only thing that was still recognizable was the landing strip near the facility. Even that had holes in it though. Steve wandered through the debris field, making his way hopefully to the other people that were here to help. He knew that Stark Industries had sent people to help out, but he wasn’t sure who else would be here. Bucky and Nat told him that they wanted to be here, but they weren’t sure if they would be able to be. Sam said that he’d try to come if he didn’t get caught up at the group that he runs. There were obviously more people that could help out but Steve hadn’t heard from any of them. Not even Tony had contacted him when he told him that they were going to start cleaning up today.
Art had always acted as an escape for him, but over the past week, it hadn’t been. Steve felt irritated whenever he sat down to draw. It felt like someone was forcing him to draw. He supposed that was true since he was taking an art class, but he still enjoyed drawing even when he was doing an assignment for the class. Even drawing Tony didn’t help him focus any better. Trying to draw him just made his mind wander to the current state of things, which hadn’t changed since Bucky had been to his apartment.
“Us.”
Steve nodded and led him to the kitchen, making sure that there was some distance between them.
“I-I know,” he said, voice weak.
“Well...yeah. I actually came back here though when I heard that you were missing. I didn’t know what to do, but I knew with you gone…someone would need to lead the fight here. I wasn’t sure if we should come here though.” Tony’s lips pursed into a thin line.  “Sorry, I don’t mean to bring this up, I can change the topic.” He knew that Tony didn’t like talking about what happened on Titan, which he understood. Losing Peter had been devastating for him.
Steve blushed deeply; he was getting ready to type out another message when one appeared on the screen. The phone nearly slipped out of Steve’s hands. No, no, no. He couldn’t be serious. No. He had to be joking.
thinking too much about this. All Tony did was invite him to the event. He probably invited him because he wanted Steve to support him. Steve still had reservations about going, but he could definitely go to show his support.
“Really? Last time I checked screaming while one’s asleep isn’t what I would call a ‘peaceful sleep’.”
“Of course I do.”
“Just take the compliment, okay?”
Here's the next chapter!
“Yes.” Tony took a seat on the couch and sighed. “It happened about four weeks ago.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Together, just like he had promised Tony. It didn’t happen exactly the way Steve had planned, but…well, they had won. They had saved the earth once again. Avenged it.
“I’m sorry, Tony…I never meant for this to happen. Never meant to feel this way. I just wanted to deal with it on my own..." There was more that he wanted to say, but the words died on his tongue.
When he was clean and dressed in sweatpants and a t-shirt, Steve checked his phone again. A message was waiting for him.
Tony slid over to him and kissed his lips gently. “Now I’m ready.”
“I missed you, Tony.”
On the fifth Friday of the new semester, Bucky knocked on his door.
“You really want to go with that story?” Bucky asked, raising an eyebrow.
Steve had just finished placing some butter and syrup on the kitchen island when Tony walked into the kitchen. Steve couldn’t help but stare at him – he was wearing pajama bottoms, a NASA t-shirt, and his hair was ruffled. Tony ran a hand through his hair, smoothing some of it down.
“We had a problem.”
Tony grinned. “It’s a date, then.”
“Buck.”
“Horrible,” Bucky said.
“See you soon.”
“I don’t know…I mean,” He shrugged. “You can hang out with people who are more interesting than me, cooler than me.”
“Well…do you want to talk about it?” he asked gently.
months to clear all of the debris, not four. Not that a month really mattered that much. It had given Steve a sense of purpose, going there every day, trying to create something special out of nothing. Over the months, some of the Avengers stopped by to help: Bucky, Nat, Sam, Peter Parker, Rhodey. They didn’t stay very long, but they still helped. Tony, on the other hand, had barely come to the site. He had only stopped by once and a while and most of the time when he had stopped by, Steve had only seen him for a few minutes. He had always seemed to be in a rush to go somewhere. Besides that, Steve had barely talked to him. Steve was convinced that he somehow did something wrong, but he couldn’t think of anything he had done within the last couple of months that would’ve made him upset. So, he tried not to dwell on it.
love with her anymore.”
“What is it, Bucky?” He glanced away from the cooking show that he had been watching.
But not in the same way that Steve was expecting. Normally, Tony sat near the back of the room, with some of his other friends while Steve sat in the front row. Steve liked the front row – it helped him focus better. That wasn’t what happened today, though. Oh, no.
He walked into the brick building and made his way to the classroom that was at the end of the hall. Some people mingled in the hall, but they didn’t pay any attention to him. Or at least, they pretended that they didn’t. Either way, Steve was grateful. He didn’t want this to be a big deal – he was just there to learn more about art. He opened the door to the classroom and slipped inside. The tables in the back were empty, so he took a seat at one of them. Some people in front of him turned around and stared at him. Steve sighed; at times like these, he wished that his superpower was invisibility. Then people wouldn't be stunned when Captain America was near them. He ignored them and took out a new sketchbook that he had bought just for the class. He had considered bringing his old one, but he didn’t want to accidentally lose it. The door opened again and a woman with brown hair walked in, towards the front of the class.
Steve looked at Tony for a few moments, wondering what he was up to. Finally, though, he gave him his phone. Tony smirked at him and took his phone. Steve glanced at the screen. He saw Tony’s number appear on the screen.
“You’re staring,” Tony said, stopping his speech to look at Steve.
He shook his head. “I’m sorry, are you saying
On Friday, Steve spent most of the afternoon, once again, cleaning the apartment. Luckily Bucky was out though so he couldn’t make fun of him for being so ‘keyed up’ or ask him questions about what was happening.
Here's the next chapter!
“I could…”
Steve sighed. “Yes.”
Tony shrugged. “This place was actually my parents’ place when they wanted to visit the city. So, when I got into law school, they gave it to me.”
Steve stared at him. He was leaving already?  He hadn’t even spent five minutes here. He had barely even talked to him – he just told him about the project. Even that could hardly count as a conversation. He glanced down at his feet.
“Have fun, Captain. You will do well.”
Steve shook his head. He sat down on one of the couches and stared at his lap, not really knowing what to say. He felt kind of silly, being here. As if he didn’t belong. It was obvious that Tony was from a whole other…background than him. He definitely shouldn’t be here. He moved to stand up, but the doorbell rang. Steve sighed and sat back down.
“Discouraging, isn’t it?” Scott asked.
The blonde made his way through the crowd and up the stairs. He turned left on the landing, towards a room that had both of its' doors open. Classical music swept into the hall from the room. Steve walked closer to the room, his gaze settling on a sign next to one of the doors, which read:
"Thanks."
Steve shook his head. “No, it’s fine. As I said, I’m just not used to it.”
Steve’s blushed deepened. “I wanted to.” Steve knew that this wasn’t a date or anything, but he had wanted to do something nice for Tony, especially after all the trouble that he had put him through. Tony seemed speechless for a moment; he opened his mouth to say something, but nothing came out.
“Steve?” Tony asked.
“Sure, I’m starved.”
“Tony, I don’t have to talk about it. I can change the topic.”
He thought that maybe by this point something would be happening with the Avengers, but no missions had come in. So, Steve decided to try to move on. Move on from what…well, that he wasn’t too sure about. About two months after the battle, he started to see Sharon Carter again. They had gone on a few dates while he had been on the run, but the relationship hadn’t gone anywhere. It was too difficult to maintain when Steve was going place to place and couldn’t let her know where he was going. Now that Steve’s record had been wiped clean and his avenging days were put on hold, he decided to give their relationship another try.
“N-no, you can take it.”
“I cannot thank you enough for your support. These last five years have been hard on us all. With your help, we will build a better team of Avengers who will not only protect the Earth more efficiently, but will give back to the community more as well. Thank you for your time.”
When he had finished eating his dinner – some chicken dish, Steve made his way to the bar to get a drink. The bartender looked up at him when he approached.
The story continues.
Steve swallowed thickly and shook his head.
So Tony has arrived at the gala...what will happen now?
“Are you going to invite me in?”
“Shut up.”
“No, I’m being realistic. Anyways…just think about it.”
“No…reach this point – be friends again, talk again. After we fought, I never thought that we'd be doing something like this...I didn't even think we'd talk again."
“I agree with Nat.”
. If he had just listened to Tony and tried to work with him more during the Accords, maybe the Avengers would have never split up; if they had never split up, perhaps they would’ve been able to stop Thanos the first time he came knocking on their door. After all, they were the Avengers, Earth’s mightiest heroes. How could they be mighty if they lost? Sure, they ultimately won, but they still
He slid a hand through his hair, smoothing it out, before opening the door. Tony stood on the other side, a smirk upon his face.
“Ah, I know that it can be overwhelming to meet me, but I’m just like you.” He winked at him. “Anyways, I’d like you to meet my companions.”
Tony shrugged by way of answering. He popped another piece of bread into his mouth. “You should have some.” He pushed the basket over to Steve, who tore off piece of bread and bit into it. “Good, right?”
Steve’s eyebrows knitted together. No, no, that wasn’t his point. He wasn’t blaming Tony for not calling him. He understood why he didn’t.
“Yeah, they just left a few hours ago. Natasha gave me this book.” He nodded towards his book.”
Feel free to leave a comment or kudos.  :)
“You’re Tony Stark?”
The blonde was just coming home from an art gallery exhibit when his phone chimed. He slipped it out of his pocket and glanced at the screen.
“Thank you,” Steve said to the driver.
Steve looked at him; a hint of a smile played at his lips. “I’m Captain America, it kind of comes with the gig.”
“Sorry that I’m late. Here, I brought some dinner.” Tony lifted up a plastic bag.
Thanks for your continued support!
“I figured as much.”
“We’re almost there,” Steve replied.
“Tony?” Steve asked, pausing in the middle of the room.
“Nothing may happen, Steve…but you never know. As I said, let Tony decide what he wants. Maybe he’ll change his mind.”
“I know. It wouldn’t have been the same.” He exhaled softly. “Good thing I didn’t have to say goodbye, huh?”
Thank you for your continued support! It really means a lot to me. Here's the next chapter.
Well…she did have a point. Maybe he
Tony pulled away and smoothed out his shirt. “I think we should go inside…we have a lot of work to do.”
“See, with all of your frowning I thought that you were having a terrible time.” What?
“Well, good thing that that didn’t happen.”
Unfortunately for Steve, they had decided to meet a few days later. He thought that the days would go by slowly, but the day that he was supposed to meet up with Tony came faster than he had expecting. He stood on the other side of Tony’s door, one hand drumming along his messenger bag, the other knocking on the door.
“Well, I’m not most people,” Tony said. “I thought that that was clear?”
Tony took a sip of his drink. He smirked. “I just didn’t know that you knew that.”
“Oh…sorry,” Steve mumbled. He took a seat next to Tony.
“Don’t mention it.”
Once they had begun to eat their meals, they started to work on the presentation. They worked mainly in silence, concentrated on getting this presentation done before the night was over. And, unlike most of their classmates, they didn’t feel like spending all night working on it. The sooner they got it finished, the better. Steve occasionally glanced at Tony, but for the most part, he focused on his section of the project, wanting it to be perfect since he knew that Tony’s section would be perfect.
Steve blinked a couple of times.
“No? Then why do you keep looking at me?”
Steve rolled his eyes. “I didn’t mean exactly two seconds, Tony.”
Tony nodded and took a step towards to the paintings. “Can we get a closer look at them?”
“Upset me? Oh, no. I didn’t care about you talking about one of your friends. I was glad for it. When we were kids…you didn’t have many friends. You acted like you didn’t need them, but I knew that you wanted them. When you started to talk about the Avengers, especially Tony, I realized that you had finally had found somewhere where you belong.”
“Nothing. Never mind,” Steve said. His cheeks turned light pink.
He arrived at the middle of the site which was marked by a bunch of people with “Stark Industries” t-shirts and construction hats. They were already picking through the rubble. In the distance, several yards away from them, bulldozers and trucks made their way to them. A man with curly brown hair stood with a small group of people, a clipboard in hand. Steve walked over to him.
He walked out of the hospital and hailed a cab. He wasn’t sure where to go, so he told the cab driver to take him to his old apartment - the one he had prior to Scott telling them about the quantum realm and time travel. When he arrived at the apartment building, he walked in and nodded to the security guard at the front desk (who always told Steve that he didn’t understand why he was protecting him when he was Captain America) before going up to his apartment.
Also, fun fact: In a draft of this chapter, Steve put a headband in his hair to keep it out of his eyes before he drew Tony.
“I don’t mind the readings, either.”
Steve sat down; his smile faded. Now It was obvious to him why he wasn’t able to forget little details like this about Tony. At first, he thought it was just him being a good friend, but now…he thought that maybe he remembered these things for a different reason. A deeper one. One that he had been too oblivious to see. It was still baffling that he hadn't realized his feelings for so long. They were so apparent to him now. He sighed deeply; well, there wasn't anything he could do about now. He gazed into his coffee, lost in his thoughts. A moment passed; he thought that he heard Tony say something, but the sound was muffled, background noise.
“Yes. It’s just odd, not getting any attention.”
“Excuse me,” Tony said, taking a spot behind the podium. People turned towards the podium. “I won’t bother introducing myself because I assume all of you know who I am. If you don't...where have you been?” Laughs came from the crowd. “Anyways, originally I was not supposed to attend tonight’s event because I was co-hosting a Stark Industries event. However, I felt like this event was more important. The Avengers, although on a hiatus right now, were a huge part of my life…are a huge part of my life. After the battle with Thanos though, my first thought wasn’t the Avengers, it was to recuperate. Some may say that was understandable after everything that happened and I don't regret not thinking about the Avengers while I was just beginning to heal. But…” Tony’s gaze lifted to where Steve was standing. “Steve Rogers was the one who was thinking about what to do next after the battle. He came up with the plan to rebuild the Avengers facility only a few days after the attack. He was the one who asked me if he could take the lead on the project. Obviously, I said yes. Over the last few months, teams have been working hard to clear that land so we can start anew, create a new era of the Avengers. Making a new building wasn’t enough though…Steve also wanted to have this function help those in our communities.” Steve’s cheeks grew warm. He wasn't used to getting this sort of praise. Not as Steve Rogers. “If you donate money, know that you will not only be supporting these types of efforts, but you will be supporting a team, led by a leader who never gives up.”
"Not hungry." Tony's voice resonated through JARVIS speakers.
Bucky jerks up again. The noises he makes are exquisite.
Tony looked away. "I mean, I... I... at the beginning—"
Tony had shifted onto his stomach, claiming his space on the huge bed. He was dozing off, although he looked pensive still. Steve was wide awake however. He turned on his side and brushed his fingers up and down Tony's spine. His boyfriend imperceptibly shivered.
"Well, there's also that Rumlow guy from work..." Tony blurted, teasingly.
"What? Isn't she omega too?"
"I have your body on demand, why would I bother?" Although there might have been a couple of times when Steve regretted not having them. Tony worked a lot and often finished late at night.
He spent a long moment of boredom watching his dad gulping down one drink after another, laughing forcibly to hide the bitterness pooling in his hazy eyes, and wondered if he was inevitably going to follow the same path. After all, alcoholism was supposed to be genetic, partly, and Tony was already sipping his fifth drink when he was barely legal. Was his grandfather a drunk too? Everybody probably drank heavily in the past ,anyway. What about his great grandfather? He had never had the chance to ask. He would probably never dare either, knowing Howard. Were all his ancestors a long lineage of cynical and drunk assholes? Was he looking at his older self, right now? The idea was utterly depressing.
He grabs the man's wrist before he starts walking away to the elevator. James stops instantly, although he could easily snatch his hand away from Tony's grasp with his super-soldier strength, and turns around slowly. He lowers his head and looks down in submission.
She pressed his arm gently. "Okay." She said softly. "I have to go. Press this button to call if you need anything." She started walking away from him but turned to him and spoke one last time. "You can change your mind about this, Gregory. About what you said. Any time. We'll be there for you, whatever you need. You can get help, you know. You're not on your own."
Steve's smile falters and something dark and forlorn tenses his soft features. He looks down. Just like he should never. Tony hates himself.
Dinner ended after that and the conversations easily went back to Natasha's exciting news as people moved over towards the living room.
"That's what you said, right?" Steve kept on, sounding as biting and bitter as before but with a tinge of humor. "Captain America saved the day again..."
The car pulled over. He took his pack of cigarette out of his pocket and picked one. He tapped it on the pack while waiting for his cue. Certainly that was where Obie was dropping him off, throwing him away like trash.
Bucky's last heat lasted four days. Steve was in charge of looking after Felicia then. When it was over Bucky ran back to his daughter and locked himself in his room with her.
Their eyes met and they remained silent, standing still in the middle of the room. Bucky was so pretty in the moonlight, his hair was falling onto his forehead and his tall and muscular figure. Very manly. The same silhouette that had attracted him more than seventy years ago. Steve could only see a lewd glimmer in his eyes and his parted lips. The alpha scent was everywhere in the nest, permeated in the walls.
He knows he should leave. He shouldn't be here... but he can't.
That particular tongue stung however, the burn spread inside Tony. He'd rather fuck the guy's mouth again. He
during which Bucky was worried to death. Ten days during which Steve didn't get out of his nest but to shower or empty himself. And when he did, he looked haggard, smiling blissfully and completely mute, in a complete daze.
Why was Steve not joining him in bed? Why had he come to his rescue if he only wanted to chastise him. Tony just wanted to sleep in his arms and cuddle. They could fight tomorrow... "I was just waiting for you." He said sheepishly.
Obviously this wasn't the reaction Tony expected. He let escape a weird strangled laugh and smiled at him confusedly. His eyes were questioning and Steve startled at the gentleness in them. Tony tilted his head on the side. "It has its perks, I suppose." He said in a shrug, eyes intent on Steve, so serious and determined, and then he reached out a hand to Steve's face.
"Have you been taking any drugs?"
They're wearing his marks, his bites, his scent. They're
Dark-haired guy laughed in surprise. "All right." He squeezed on Tony's neck again. "Like pain?"
Steve quickly paced back to the living room and straddled him again. "Close your eyes." He ordered and Tony shivered and smiled softly, slowly showing his perfect teeth, lewdly wet and shining so bright in the winter light. His hands were back on Steve's waist, strong, possessive, and Steve couldn't help a shudder that vibrated through him from head to toe. Tony's head was reclined the sofa and his eyes were closed obediently. He was at Steve's mercy, open and pliant. Steve slowly rocked his hips on his crotch and hummed sensually when he felt his boyfriend twitch under him. He did it again and drew a gasp from Tony. His lips parted. Steve brushed the chocolate down his boyfriend's face, following the bridge of his nose. Tony was biting his lips in anticipation, licking them softly. "Open." Steve husked out, the word stuck in his throat, raspy and lustful. Tony naturally opened his mouth and Steve let the chocolate slide down into it, brushing his lips softly, vibrating to the sound of his boyfriend's lewd hums and moans.
Tony shrugged, looking away, and pouted. Maybe he had. He was fucked up like that. He didn't even know what Steve was talking about, anyway....
helping." He said amusedly. "I'm helping with the mood."
"I have presented."
"Yes."
"What do you want then?"
His boyfriend complied without protest but the question seemed to linger in his eyes, still. "It's a surprise." Steve said as only explanation. "Today's such a beautiful day." He added.
"We've been through this, Tony, you know why I don't want to live in the Tower."
"I think so too."
"We'll need a terrace." Tony continued. "And an efficient ventilation system. High security... It'll have to be eco-friendly too. Sustainable. And powered with clean energy."
"Alright guys!" Sam interrupted. "Game's over. And Steve? No one said you needed to be this slutty! Chill out, alright?
"What are you doing? We were starting to get worried." Sam asked with a concerned frown on his face.
"Sleeping."

And as they are loving each other, as their connection is stronger than ever, as their bond is stronger and more unbreakable and impenetrable than ever, he loves them more.
In addition, she was brilliant and proud and ambitious. How could Steve even compete?
it as if it was his own desire pooling in his guts. It's not as urgent and visceral as the way James wants it but it's there, somewhere in the back of his head and it's growing and incessant and overwhelming. He also knows that Steve is scared, terrified at the idea of it. And he knows why.
Everyday he wakes up next to Steve and feels his heart race. Everyday he wakes up and his own lips curl up on their own as he stares down at him. Everyday he remains there, sitting in his bed that has become theirs and watches the soft movement Steve's chest makes when he sleeps. His eyes linger on his lips and how they slightly tremble as he breathes. Everyday he marvels at the beauty and warmth of the moment and makes it last, just a little more. He'd like to tell you exactly what he feels like at this moment, but it's way too intense, way too confusing for him to analyse it. He just enjoys it, hoping it will never stop. He doesn't think about it too much though, because the prospect of this ending gives him anxiety.
If scenting his freshly discovered alphaness had been an unexpected surprise to his friends this morning,
"Ooh, I like that plan." Tony cooed. "But you have yet to propose, Rogers!" His eyes and his smile were a little insecure though and Steve panicked. Moving in together was one thing, marriage was... well. Not something they had ever considered. And he wasn't ready to discuss it now, or ever. Things were already perfect between them. He threw a piece of clothes at his boyfriend's face in response.
as a person.
Steve's hands land on his hips and he gazes more openly at him, face flushed and a shy smile. A happy smile.
He really didn't want to but he lowered his head anyway, instinctively. One couldn't stand up to Howard for that long and not fear the worst. "You don't need me there to sign the contract. You know enough of the project to present it yourself. I can meet with them another time if that's so important to you."
Tony will gladly do it. He's never been good at cooking but if that's what it takes to please his boyfriend, Tony is not above learning a trick or two. After all, it worked with Clint, didn't it? It's always a plus to acquire new skills and it might turn out to be useful, you never know. In fact, there's about nothing Tony wouldn't do to make Steve happy. He just needs to know
So gorgeous.
it. It's great that you found fulfillment through paternity and I'm happy for you, really, but that's not for me and it will never be. I'm not wired that way."
On his way out he crossed path with his boyfriend who barely gave him an annoyed glance before hitting the shower himself, his jaw still had the tense tremor of anger. Tony felt like crying again. He felt like throwing up again. His heart twinged, squeezing so hard in his chest it cut his breathing short.
"Mantis, listen very carefully. I need you to meet me on Titan." said Nebula.
"Which is?"
"I remember your signature on those papers, Colonel."
Palpatine, Joker, Voldemort, Zod, and every Marvel villain are celebrating because Thanos is finally leaving to actually do something other than sit in his chair.
"You're too high up. You're running out of air." Tony told him.
Act II-Battle For The Multiverse
"My girlfriend's currently out on space, trying to recruit an army." Daisy joined in.
"No...Loki..." Thor cried, as he was freed.
"I saved you." Thanos said.
"If it's with the Collector, then it's not safe. Only an idiot would give that man a stone." Star-Lord insisted.
"I have him." replied Wong.
Ebony Maw walked towards the controls of the ship, Strange's unconscious body floating face-down behind him, and prepared to leave Earth's atmosphere, Tony hot on his tail. "Unlock 17-A." the billionaire ordered his assistant. FRIDAY immediately responded by launching a pod from the Avengers Mansion and shooting it towards the accelerating circular ship, somehow it caught Leyenar with it...or did
"Uh, sir, I think you can expect quite a big assault." said Bruce.
[Soulmate:] A person with whom you have an immediate connection the moment you meet. A connection so strong that you are drawn to them in a way you have never experienced before. As this connection develops over time, you experience a love so deep, strong and complex, that you doubt you have ever truly loved anyone prior.
Drax, who had came to, attempted to strike Thanos but the Titan used the Reality Stone to turn him into a pile of cubes, and Mantis got shredded into ribbons.
October 24th, 1997
And so, Darren joined forces with the Guardians Of The Galaxy(plus Ronan The Accuser) to go against his concept, and he WON! The universe changed, and the only thing left was ultimate salvation...or so everybody thought.
"Because
"Peace of our time." replied the AI.
"Who could find Vision, then?" asked Strange.
"This was meant for one big guy, so we gotta move at the same time." said Tony, and though their landing was a little bit bumpy, they made it to Titan.
The Guardians came in earlier than I thought, so I'll have to include them in this chapter.
"Brushing Natasha's hair," Lyla said, holding up a little redheaded doll.
"He's never fought me twice. And I'm getting a new hammer, don't forget." Thor clarified.
"Magnificent! Magnificent! Magnificent!" cheered the Collector.
After the Sokovia incident, Leyenar chose to stay at the Avengers Mansion. She dared not go back to her parents, since they were no good to her. They didn't even try to understand her opinion on same-sex pairings! Plus, FRIDAY was a really good cook, better than her mom. Once the dust had settled, the heroes threw a raging party for her, during of which Leyenar gave each and every one of them lovely gifts. The Avengers presented her with a buncha beautiful flowers in return.
might have a choice. Your mind is made up of a complex construct of overlays. JARVIS, Ultron, Tony, me, the Stone. All of them mixed together. All of them learning from one another."
"Yeah, he's a king." Rhodey replied.
"You know me so well. You finish all my sentences."
The Titan crushed the Tesseract, revealing the blue Space Stone. He blew some of the fractals away, fingering the Stone between his thumb and index, before placing it on the gauntlet, and was momentarily rocked by the surge of energy that pulses as the stone seated in its setting.
"What if I missed all the trains? What if this time, I didn't go back?"
Loki smiles and this time it is genuinely happy. "That's really nice and generous of you..." Loki mutters softly. "But I can fight my own battles."
It worked, indeed. Tony was no rookie, he knew what he was doing, been doing this for as long as he was old enough for the bouncer not to look twice at him when he showed his fake ID.
"So..." He started, voice unexpectedly charged. "It was early November. On a Saturday. The weather was really beautiful that day, unusually warm and sunny. I wasn't even wearing a coat. I err... I don't why Steve was working on that day. He wasn't supposed to work on Saturdays—I checked—but he was, and I had never seen him before although I used to go quite often there, with my parents—they insisted." Something sorrowful ran across his eyes but it was gone long before Steve could even try to analyze it. "Gosh, I can't believe how long it's been already." Tony exclaimed and then he continued, voice calm and composed but highly emotional. "And frankly I hated going there, pretending..." His smile faded a little and he swallowed. "I had to, though. I had to play the part... So I did."
to do it, we can just cuddle."
"You look fine." Steve says. "I like you just the way you are." And it sounds so blunt and genuine it unsettles him.
Tony replies with a kiss.
"Don't be sorry, baby. Never be sorry." His hand cups his face tenderly and Tony brushes his thumb along his jawline, making Steve shiver and gasp with want. His thumb rolls over his lips, Steve parts his lips and sucks it in, eyes fluttering shut. He leans into the alpha's touch and starts purring, slick flushing down his legs. "Get up, omega," the alpha commands. Steve complies, he straightens up but remains sitting, ass on his heels, so he isn't taller than the alpha. Tony is standing on his knees, dipping them into the mattress, he moves closer and leans into him, almost falling over him. Steve's impressive built doesn't budge against the smaller stature of the alpha.
He still looks at them from afar, leaving the door of his room slightly ajar so he can see if his plan works or not. His departure changed the dynamic between them and it's become more tender. The alpha is holding back, trying to enjoy the omega a little longer. He runs gentle fingers through his hair, tugging hard on it from time to time, to remind him who's the alpha and who's the omega, and incidentally because Steve loves it. And Steve returns the sentiment, swallowing the alpha's cock eagerly to the hilt.
When he was done cleaning Tony up, he brushed gentle fingers into his hair and fondled his cheek. His eyes were gentle and supportive again, a glimpse of concern pooling in them. Tony turned his head away to avoid the man's stare.
They kissed again and again.
his eyes met those of the fallen angel.
Obie had always known how to speak to Tony, how to
Tony wiped his face with his right hand, the cigarette still clutched in between his fingers. "I don't wanna fight you." He let out in a desperate sigh. "I won't fight you, Steve. I'll get you the best lawyers—"
Tony pulled the window up and sighed, still unsettlingly silent. Steve started to feel uneasy. He bit his bottom lip and swallowed before glancing timidly at his boyfriend. "Were you able to raise enough funds, at least?" He finally asked, trying to make conversation.
Tony grinned with relief, taking his hand back. "So you're not mad?"
"I've only had five and I stuffed myself like a pig..." Steve retorted. "I didn't see you eat, though."
Steve's heart made a leap. "I guess so." He choked out, words stuck in his throat. He let his boyfriend kiss him again and melted into it, forgetting about his regrets and his guilt. This time Tony was fully hard when he anchored Steve into the mattress and kissed him in the neck, eyes hazy with lust. The knuckles of his hand brushed Steve's face softly and Tony kissed him again, tongue wild and mellow into his mouth.
