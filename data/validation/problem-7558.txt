"Tony, you can call me Tony."
"Steve and I just needed a day, I guess. Didn't plan on it, it just kinda happened."
"Hey, Nat, want to spar later?"
"Don't. I know. There's nothing I can do to stop how I feel. You guys are just going to have to deal with me and Tony being kind of a mess right now," he lamented.
He needed to pull Tony out of his own mind, something that Rhodey was infinitely better at. But Rhodey wasn't there. It was just Steve. And he'd have to be good enough.
"Spoiled brat."
"Please, oh god."
"Tony?"
"In the meantime, Tony is going to need us to rally around him."
Tony felt his chest tighten. "Do you want me? I thought you wanted me." He couldn't have misread the situation that badly! Not with all the kissing and the touches and the--
"I would make that hole quiver." Thor grunted, his own body starting to curl in on itself.
"Nothing to do with his pretty shield?"
a family."
"Tony! Let it cool a bit!" Steve admonished, taking the salt from the genius in one hand and trying to grab the mug with the other.
"Not only that!" It was Clint, and Tony hadn't even seen him enter the kitchen. "But have a looky!" Leaning past Steve and Tony, he flipped all the cabinets open, ignoring Steve's face at the chaos of it all. "You are officially stocked with all sorts of goodies! Gluten free pasta, cookies, breakfast snacks, a year's worth of K-Toos and Tates, by the way, you're welcome for that one." Tony beamed at him. The cabinets were indeed stocked full of things Tony could safely consume. Clint grabbed a box of the vanilla sandwich cookies and opened it, offering them to Tony, who took one and shoved it into his mouth. Clint did the same, chewing around his grin.
"Look, I don't know
"Steve," he faltered, swallowing, "Steve gave me hell a few nights ago. Rightly so. I'm aware of how much Tony means to those around him, and I'm happy that despite what my future self does, he has that. But I assure you, I have no desire to hurt him. Not here. Not now. And I have every intention of doing whatever it takes to change how I raise him."
"I know many of you are wondering exactly what business I have here. And I think some of you have figured it out." He looked out at the curious faces, smiling lightly to set them at ease as well as himself. "I've been in the news a lot lately." He gave a sardonic grin as laughter rolled through the room. "Some wild accusations about my appearance. That I'm anorexic. Bulimic. That I have cancer." The room quieted.
Snorting loudly, Clint tilted his head back against the wall of the quinjet. "That's the understatement of the year."
Steve looked at him, face impassive, "Appetizer."
replied: WHO ARE YOU PEOPLE
"Before we roofie our friend," Bruce said evenly, "we'll try eating healthier, which, let's face it, is good for all of us, and if that doesn't work, maybe an elimination diet?"
Though they both knew the needed to talk about everything was important for their moving forward together, neither made the jump to start. They lay there, Tony on Steve's chest, skin to skin, tired and sated, content. The silence twirled around their sleepy bodies, enveloping them in a warm cocoon. It was nice to just hear the other breathe, knowing he was back where he belonged: In the other's arms.
One morning he woke up and realized he didn't hate Tony. He appreciated him. Respected him, his genius, his willingness to sacrifice. He found himself seeking out the other's company, enjoying time spent with him. He learned about him. Not just his intelligence, or his heroism, but about
. You stink. Go wash your pits."
Without a second glance to it, Steve shoved the Phoropter away and swung his leg over Tony's, straddling him. "I can definitely do that. Custom fit, just like I said." Slipping his hands down Tony's spine, he lifted his back from the seat far enough that he could grind against Tony's surprisingly svelte and toned body. Tony’s hands flung up to Steve's hair, mussing it as his fingers sluiced through the blond locks, tugging him down to press their lips together.
"Goodnight, Mr. Stark," Tony turned, just a little, into Steve. Enough to to show he needed comfort, but not enough to be obvious about it. "J, get the lights."
Deflating, Howard sighed. "Not entirely without reason, I suppose. He has every right to be angry with me."
The weather was turning, but it was still somewhat bright for the mid-afternoon. A light rain came from the clouds and washed the streets, sending the dirt from the prior dry days cascading down into the sewers. He could see the sidewalks fill as the elementary school up the block let out and children and parents began their walk home. He never had that. He had boarding schools and the occasional phone call from his mother. Propriety and rules instead of a parent waiting diligently by the doors to see her child. Decorum and manners, starched uniforms with crisp white shirts and ties. Blazers and pressed pants instead of recess and playgrounds and trading lunches.
, but I like to branch out."
Pushing off the door frame, he stepped into the living room, arms still tight against his chest. "Don't just barge in. You don't get that courtesy, Howard. That's for
My love and thanks to so many incredible people who's helped me throughout writing this story!
"I hope you're talking about the theft of my hoodie."
"No. We always do our best to infiltrate and attack, get our angels back before they perish." Michael's face is as stone-like as a statue of himself in a church, and Tony needs to swallow and remind himself to breathe.
"Tony, oh god," one hand snaked in between them and wrapped around Tony's erection, stroking him, squeezing hard, and flicking his thumb over the head. "Fuck, Tony. Come for me."
"Not until you read the chart for me, Mr. Stark." In a frankly stunning display of strength and dexterity for an optometrist, Steve lifted Tony up off his cock and spun him midair, his hands under Tony's thighs to maneuver him, until Tony's back was against his chest. "Read the chart, Mr. Stark. Doctor's orders." With one hand around Tony's waist, holding him up, he used the other to line his cock up and impaled Tony right back onto him. Tony screamed, sobbing with want. His hands flailed behind him, fingers searching for purchase on Steve's arms.
When he's gone, Tony hugs the pillow and speaks to the empty room. "I'm sorry. But I love you too much to let you get hurt because of me."
"Just-" Steve pulled out, leaving the tip inside Tony's rim, "-like this." With a grunt, he slammed back in, and Tony's toes curled, his head falling back, hitting the back of the chair hard.
"Damn straight," she muttered, plucking the toast from the oven and plating them.
Steve's face was red, but he was typing furiously, studiously ignoring Tony's eyes.
"Sir is in his workshop." The voice was clipped and short, professional in the way a boss fires his secretary.
his obsession with finding Steve yet."
"It takes a bit of training to learn how to put them away," Michael adds. "But your shell looks good; the wings are an easy add-on."
"WHY ARE YOU ANOREXIC NOW? IS IT SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE AVENGERS?"
"Maybe." Clint answered. "But I honestly think he's convinced Steve only likes boobs."
He was trembling by the time he reached the guest room door.
Reluctantly, he turned his back on the fight, knowing that with a dragon, the heavy artillery was a better solution to fighting it and his shield would only be able to do so much. A man and woman, huddled just inside the door to the cafe, looked up at him in desperation as he approached. "Come on!" he shouted, helping them up. "Follow me!"
"Knew you'd like it." Bruce could tell Tony wanted nothing more than to take Steve's hand. He could see his fingers twitch in contemplation, but though their friends were supportive and accepting of their relationship and the country's view was shifting, society as a whole was not. He hated that they had to hide.
"You got out of the-did you guys even THINK for one second, just one measly second that I could have prevented this?"
"Enough of that!" Lecturing himself wasn't something he normally did, but sometimes it was necessary. He was not the greatest listener at the best of times, but if he was going to hear anyone, it would be his own damn self. "It's not like Steve knew you were going to hop into the future, and of course he'd need a friend. Naturally another Stark would fit the bill." Which was an awful thing to say, and he knew it. Tony wasn't a stand in for Howard. But it did make him feel a bit better.
"But it's a start." He was graced with a broad smile, "Get dressed, I'll be good and wait in your living room."
"No they won't. Somehow it'll all still be my fault."
"That's gross."
"Tony!" Steve chuckled, rubbing a hand down his face, far too entertained. "If you want to eat sometime this year, go!"
She had seen Back to the Future, probably too many times given Clint's obsession with the franchise and it being a comfort movie for him, but Tony still looked pretty damn solid. Maybe it wouldn't affect what already was. Marty McFly went to the past, not the future after all.
Steve's patience was obviously wearing thin, but Bruce still couldn't help but laugh.
Bruce nodded, "No, you're right. That's going to stick out like a sore thumb over Clint's melody."
There, he had accepted his fate, gazed upon stars he had never seen before, and closed his eyes. At least the wormhole held a purpose. He was doing something right, sacrificing himself to save the lives of millions. This? This was nothing but a replay of every emotion his childhood trauma could throw at him. He felt like one of those big black garbage bags that landscapers used in the yard. He had too many sticks shoved inside and was beginning to tear, every flaw and every hidden bundle of secrecy starting to spill out.
"I don't know. He can handle milk, do you think yogurt would be okay?"
didn't abuse me. Not this you. You're off the hook, Dad." It should have made Howard happy to hear, should have had him feeling relieved. It didn't. A thought was already forming in his mind when Fury started talking again.
So what changed?
"Perish? Like...for good? Forever?"
RiaRose - 3136 - A1 - Workshop Troubles
His head hurt. He was thinking in circles, not coming up with any sort of conclusion. Just rambling on and on as guilt gnawed at his insides. Drinking coffee like it was going out of style while his stomach churned with resentment at his own future actions and hunger. God, was he hungry. The greasy and delicious smelling breakfast sandwiches Natasha had brought up for him sat uneaten in the refrigerator, growing cold. He couldn't bring himself to eat. Couldn't bring himself to leave the guest room for longer than it took to refill his mug with coffee from the machine that never seemed to be empty.
"How did you know?" He stopped and glared at her, but there was no anger behind it.
"All you." And they were kissing again, and Tony could swear if he had nothing else in his life but the ability to keep doing this, he'd be the happiest man in the world.
It was a phrase all of them had heard at one point or another. Something Howard had screamed at him constantly while growing up. Steve hated it. It renewed his fury at the elder Stark, and he felt frustration start to bubble up within him.
"Glad you think so."
so happened to have made reservations at that fancy little French place a couple of blocks over. You know, to be prepared."
"In the morning, he made me an honorary member of his family. Said he's never seen a white man drink so much and not vomit!" He spoke with his hands, something that Tony did as well, but the combination of his exuberance in the storytelling and his drunken state set him off balance, and he tipped over the back of the sofa and out of sight.
Clint groaned at that, making fast work on unzipping his jeans and tugging his erection free.
, a film from 2002 that he had first seen only a couple of years prior. He had fallen in love with the dysfunctional family and the protagonist's plight of trying to better himself.
"You have like six chins there."
It's absurd—the whole thing. And Tony's panic switches to hysteria.
"Not at all. I should also mention no manager in the past ten years has lasted longer than four months with them."
"Come, baby, show me how you come."
Steve smirked, inching the stool a little closer. "Keep going." The anticipation was growing, and so was his erection. This close, he could smell Tony: his aftershave, the musk of his work, motor oil, and something earthy. It was invigorating.
"Why didn't you wake me?" He stepped forward, smacking Steve's butt as he passed, and smirking lasciviously, his hand stinging a bit because hey, that's America's Ass for you!
The man sat on the rusted barstool adjacent to the lounger. "Name’s Steve. Just Steve. You don't need to know anymore than that."
pancakes?"
"Hey! Cheater!" But Steve was chasing after him, easily catching up.
"Malibu. Steve thought it better to get away for a few days."
"I know that, sir-"
"And make their star shine bright again."
"We didn't. There's no way to return. Howard Stark is stuck here. Permanently."
In his suite, he slowly gathered up Steve's things, his hands trembling the whole time. The mental exhaustion and lack of nutrition had him aching and shaking. Placing Steve's favorite sweater in a bag, he finally let himself cry, breaking down and sobbing, face covered by his hands, knees to chest, and rocking in a sad attempt to soothe himself.
. In his eyes, in his playful demeanor. If he could keep Tony, maybe it wouldn't be so awful. He could make a life here. It wouldn't be the same; it would be the death of every dream he had. But if he had his son, at least then he could make new dreams.
Shrugging, Steve looks over at him, "A little, but… but it shouldn't have been necessary. I know he was old, I know he had lived a good life, but he should have died at home, of natural causes, surrounded by his family, not scared and cowering as a piece of rebar careened toward him faster than he could react."
"I think Steven would be ecstatic. I think the two of you will be very happy together."
And Tony! Well, from the few interactions he had with the man, he seemed, hell, he seemed incredible. Smart. Witty. Kind. He had created that exoskeleton armour, which to be frank was amazing. So, his child had gone into engineering. Something he, himself, loved! He had yelled at Howard,
Hope you all enjoy!
"Russia?" He asked, that one word holding all of his questions.
Steve heard Tony moving around in the bedroom not twenty-five minutes after he started to cook, and when the sleepy, warm arms slipped around his waist from behind and he felt Tony's face pushed into his shoulder, he smiled. "Hey there, sleepy head." He had gathered his thoughts as best he could, knowing Tony like he did and knowing he'd be unable to wait the full hour.
Wrapping his arms back around Tony, he pulled him backward to the door. "You only like me for my beans."
It's Natasha.
He shakes his head, even though Steve can't see him, and remains silent.
"Tony doesn't skimp on - well - anything. And no, thank you."
He stepped away from the door, shedding his button-down shirt as he did so. Tony was in the hallway and off came his pants. At the door, there went his undershirt. His hearing picked up the turn of the knob, and Steve shucked his boxers. As soon as Tony was in the room, he had him against the wall, lifting him and attacking his lips. Tony moaned, wrapping his legs around Steve's bare body.
Sitting up, he swung his feet over the bed. This story was going to need something better than his fingers or his little vibrator. In the closet, in a small box, Tony had several other toys, including a nice sized dildo, red of course, and exactly the size he assumed Steve to be. He stumbled back to the bed, jumping onto it and flopping onto his back like a teenager about to see his first porn, that is, with a little too much excitement.
"Steve," Natasha said gently, "It's not cancer. I know we've all thought it. If it's this then he's not dying. Pray for celiac, because believe me, this is a good thing."
"Why is it that every time I think I'm okay, something,
a genius."
"I'm glad my pain is amusing to you, Stark." Still hunched over, Clint sat heavily on the couch. "I think you ruptured my spleen."
"You gotta let me talk and think for myself, babe." Tony lifted one corner of his lips. It was an act of understanding but not one of relent. "Let me use my big boy words and everything." Both Steve and Bruce chuckled at that. Leave it to Tony to bring the tension down with a bad joke. "Steve, you have to let me decide on my own. You say you don't want to lose me, but if you keep-" He paused, changing direction. "I love you. But sometimes I want to punch you. You gotta let me be me."
"That ship sailed a long time ago."
A Howard he had basically befriended the night before. Calling him Asshole in the kitchen that morning didn't even start to make up for it. That was another reason he called Rhodey. Because best friends fix everything, right? Rhodey could make Tony feel happier just by being there. He knew ways to distract Tony that Steve didn't. He knew how to fish through Tony's mind to aid him in organizing his thoughts. Rhodey had years of experience dealing with the bizarre mind of a genius, he knew the inner workings better than even Steve because he had been there when Tony grew from teenager into adult.
"Good. Get yourself cleaned up and come down for breakfast. You haven't eaten since those cheeseburgers." Coulson releases his shoulders and moves towards the door. "By the way, I'm the one that brought you to your bedroom. And by I, I mean I called Michael, and he carried you."
"What about parsnip? Think he'll get sick with that?" Clint held up the root vegetable.
Pulling the Ziploc bag from his coat pocket, Tony takes the parsnip but gives the beans to Steve. "I'll do the nose since I'm so
"What did you tell him?" She took a drink of her own coffee, appreciating how Clint always seemed to get the creamer to sugar ratio just right for her.
"Come on! Who else could it be? Not Clint, he can barely string two sentences together in an e-mail, not Thor, he's only just learning how to navigate our technology. Bruce? Please. He would never write about me, let alone write about Steve."
He falls asleep while eating.
Steve chuckled contritely. "So, you're mad at me as well." It wasn't a question.
With Tony sated, he pushed his knees wide up and open, and thrusted, chasing his own climax and coming with a moan muffled by Tony's shoulder.
"Come on," Steve said, finishing his drink, "let's go." Tony nodded and flipped his wallet open, plucking several bills and tossing then onto the table as he stood. If he didn't think about it, maybe his dick would calm the fuck down. "Shall we?" Steve cackled, holding his arm out exaggeratedly.
"Just pick a restaurant. Trust me on this." She wagged the bottle, "Need a refill?"
Shrugging she went back to the puzzle, like she could not care less. "What are your plans for the rest of the night? Gonna eat something for once?"
it. Steve would be lying if he said the following he had of Avengers fans didn't make him swell with pride. Obviously, he knew it was bordering on bizarre, but he wasn't one to dwell on inconsequential things like that.
"Do they?" Rhodey huffed, head in his hands. "What am I gonna do with him?"
"And Steve?" She said, raising her eyebrows and rocking her head forwards, her body language screaming DUH in stereo.
Tony huffed, grabbing the napkin holder and sticking his tongue out like a child, "Fine, no blow jobs for a month, then!"
"No!" Tony manages to get out. Everything—
"Closet too small for you, Cap?" Clint jokes, earning him an elbow to the ribs from Natasha.
"Ice cream -- like time -- heals all things."
Tony just chuckled and started typing out the intricate code to get Jarvis on the phone. Clint waited patiently until he was done, taking the phone back and swiping through it to get a feel. "Jarvis will walk you through set up now. Everything from your old phone should wirelessly transfer over."
"Just," Tony dropped his hand, "stop trying to shelter me. Stop trying to fight
"Pull me back from the abyss."
Looking directly at the oak tree and the bench underneath, no one would guess that the small square of solitude had Manhattan springing up around it, buildings on all sides and the sunlight partially blocked by the tree. The wrought iron fence cast strange shadows across Tony's face as he sang, the light moving the dark bars across his features with the breeze. His eyes were closed, and the guitar sat propped on his knee, the strap curling around his body like armor, protecting him.
"At least they got my good side." Tony said, moving down the line, looking at more pictures of he and the team dodging what had become their everyday annoyances. "This is depressing."
Tony's entire body jerked and jolted, and he froze as his climax hit, screaming out in ecstasy, his hips pumping up and down as he humped his orgasm into the coat, his come smearing and staining the pristine white fabric. His hands flung out, scratching at the carpet under him, nails raking through the threads as jet after jet of come spurted from his cock. His ass tightened around Steve, and it was almost too much. Steve's fingers tightened around Tony's waist, digging deep enough to leave bruises. He rutted against Tony's round ass, all control gone as he chased his own orgasm, so ready to fill Tony up like one of his prescription pads.
"Can't tell you."
He could hear Tony and Rhodey talking quietly, his incredible hearing picking up on words here and there through the clanging of the cabinets and the rattling of china against china. He wasn't trying to eavesdrop, he just couldn't help it.
Steve swallowed, leaning against the door frame. There was a beauty in Tony that couldn't be quantified by his large, doe-like eyes or his jawline. It would never be defined by his smooth olive skin, or the solid body underneath his designer clothing. It was something that existed only inside Tony: a grace that was exhibited through his music. Personal lyrics and melodies that told stories, notes that climbed through the air like a gentle fog, enveloping and mysterious. When Tony sang, he was like an orchid blooming, rare and beautiful all at once.
use a good battle. Tony had a desperate need to shoot something.
There were issues. The government demanding the spell book.  People harassing Howard, not believing he was who he said he was. Steve knew there were more instances like those in the future, but for that moment? They were good.
Another interlude showing the thoughts of the rest of the team, there's one more after this and then the next chapter. IF you are enjoying the interludes, I may write another in between Chapter 7 and 8 (which is the last chapter.). If you guys want another, tell me in the comments what you would like to see!
Tony backed away from him, "I don't know you. I don't know this man!" He called out, laughing again. He made it about twenty feet from Steve before taking off in the direction of the park, "Race ya!"
"Out of bottled water upstairs," he said, grabbing two bottles from the case by the refrigerator.
Releasing him, Tony snatched the package, "Gimme!" Steve let him. It wasn't like he could ever say no to Tony, not with things like this anyway. Tearing it open, Tony plucked out a plastic bag and ripped off the top, dumping what was inside into his hand. "A pin?" It was small, circular, with a pallet knife and a paintbrush crossed in the middle. Around the outside it said
"You'd be fine. You're the 'Man with the Plan.'" He spoke into Steve's chest, voice muffled, hands splayed across the firm muscles. His insecurity was showing again. Damn it.
"Oh, I did."
"Only a human of sub-par intelligence would say no to you."
God, it was so cliché. It was ridiculous. Pouring their hearts out when they should be fucking like rabbits. But it felt so good.
"You're not. Mostly, I want to know your intentions. You
"Howard, what are you doing?"
If the interns and workers of Hydra Records suddenly heard five adult male voices singing
"Are you sure?"
James shrugged and drank from his own mug. "He ain't coming, Tones."
" And Rhodey nodded. Mission accomplished for now. They had brought Tony back from the edge together. Again.
all his fault. How damaged was he that he could forgive so easily?
Howard's answering laugh was hollow. "You know me, I go in guns blazing. I don't usually have an exit strategy. I just hope something will come to me."
That got Tony's attention. He looked up at Steve, his eyes wide and his voice quiet. He was emotionally spent and tired of fighting everything that had built up within him. "It's just. I don't know what this is. I can't work; I can't do anything. I feel useless."
"I appreciate the honesty. Okay," Tony turns to look at Hill, giving her a dazzling smile, "What do you have for us, honeybuns?" She looks like she wants to claw his eyes out, but all it does is entertain Tony that much more.
She was
RiaRose - 3136 - T1 - Presumed Dead
"He used to scream at me a lot." Tony wasn't sure why he was saying it. He couldn't seem to stop once the words started to pour out, like finally saying it aloud - especially to Howard - was somehow allowing him to let it go, even if just a little bit. It felt good. It was pure catharsis. "A backhand here or there. When he really got drunk, that's when the party started."
"Steve, we think we know what's wrong with Tony!" Clint exclaimed.
Natasha deflated, "We know. But what you need to understand is that we have the chance to help him, even fix it!"
"He's okay? Physically?"
"Not for special cases. I would have gone over everything with you here, but seeing as-" she holds her arms out, implying Tony and his
Steve glared at her, "Does it really matter?"
Clint kicks out Tony's feet a little further apart and raises Tony's elbow. "He's trying to recruit you?"
A dash of creamer for himself, and black for Tony. He gently placed them on the nightstand and turned to check the food Bruce had given him for Tony. It was a little soggy but still edible, and Rhodey balanced the tray on his hip before kneeling on the bed and setting it down. He tapped Tony's nose, loathe to wake him after he had sobbed for nearly an hour, but he knew that Bruce was right. Tony needed to eat. And then he needed to get the hell out of bed.
"Please."
"You and your undying lust for Tony."
"Thank you. It's nice to know I'm not alone." He gave a quick nod of his head, signaling he was finished.
They held still when Steve was buried to his hilt, his forehead resting against Tony's, their eyes locking. Gently, he kissed him to say thank you. To convey every emotion he was currently feeling. The heat around him was immeasurable. It was hard to stay still, to give Tony the time needed to unclench himself.
But in times when he was stressed, it was more manic than productive. Most of the time, he emerged from those spells of deflection and invention with something awe inspiring and cutting edge. But sometimes, all he did was take apart his suit hunting for a problem that didn't exist.
for right now. We have twenty-three other songs to think about."
"I'll show you tonight." Standing, he helped Tony up and guided him back to the chair. "But first, we seem to have made a mess. I don't usually clean myself before I take care of my partner, but if I'm going to get what we need from the bathroom, I think it's necessary. We don't know if anyone is still in the office."
A forceful breeze rustled the curtains, sending papers and sage rolling across the floor. The book that held the spell whipped through its pages, and the candles blew out with a finality.
Snatching his phone from her hand, he grinned devilishly, "Yes. And none for super spies who can't handle two drunk men!"
"Lame."
that maybe,
"Hot dogs can wait. I'm hungry for Tony right now."
Mock bowing as much as he could while seated in a booth, he said, "Why thank you. I try."
"Will you ever tell him?"
Seeing Howard the night before had jarred Steve's memories. Yes, this Howard was a bit older, but in many ways he looked the same. He seemed to act the same too. Still reckless, still impulsive… It set off a wave of nostalgia inside of Steve that he thought he had conquered.
Tony continued, quoting the poem, and Steve couldn't help the little grin that was forming as Tony attempted to break it down. "That's innocence. Eden was innocent. But it couldn't stay that way. We can't stay that way. But that doesn't mean it's not still good. Autumn and winter are still beautiful. They're just different."
. It's a favorite of Bruce's." She answered Howard's unspoken question.
"I spent two days drinking it away." Steve didn't know why he continued talking. "But I felt some satisfaction watching the light go out. I knew what he was. But I ain't never killed before."
He set the bottle down next to him and kissed Tony deeply, "He's fine, Tony, trust me. Nothing is wrong. He and Clint just chased a pizza with a bottle of vodka, apparently. Nat just needs help getting them to bed."
"He's got a great ass!" The vent said.
"And what's with the random civilian jumping in and calling Stark his son?"
Steve let his tongue trace along the seam of Tony's mouth before pushing past his teeth and gliding against Tony's tongue. Beneath him, Tony groaned, opening to the onslaught of Steve's mouth, his body shivering as Steve sucked on the muscle. Between them, their cocks throbbed, straining against Tony's jeans and Steve's professional, pleated dress pants.
Steve's phone went to voicemail, and Tony hung up without leaving a message. It seemed so much more important to talk to Steve then to leave a voicemail. But he texted him.
"For science!" Clint bellowed. Bruce jumped, but Tony didn't stir.
"He's a mess, isn't he?"
The idea tempted her. With what Hill had revealed at the library, it seemed so much easier to run than to face the problems back at the tower. The two block walk from the New York Public Library to Avengers Tower was not nearly long enough to fully gather her thoughts. The sinking feeling in her chest had less to do with the coolness of the early spring air and more with the heaviness she felt knowing she had to explain to Howard that he was unable to go home. She didn't even want to
"Are you freaking kidding me?!"
this Howard.
"What—" but Tony can't get the words out. His chest feels crushed.
"I don't think it ever really bothered me. I just-" he shrugged, looking a bit sheepish, "I think I was too busy with propriety. With what was expected of men."
Pepper, who had remained silent, not wanting to interrupt the team's surprise, spoke up. "I've also got some information you may want." From the briefcase by her feet, she pulled out a pamphlet. "It's a celiac conference, in Boston. You'll need to make a statement to address all the rumors, but nothing says it has to be a press conference. I can get you in as a keynote speaker."
"Or," Tony began, tapping his chin, "maybe there's room on the Avengers floor after all." He smirked at Howard, leering, just a little. "I think it's about time I ask my boyfriend to move in."
"He--" Steve's voice broke, "--he broke up with me."
Tony, who had been quiet prior, took the hoodie from Steve's hands and pulled out over his head. He looked happy but exhausted. "Spit it out, Tashi."
"What? No!"
"Thinking about anything else, even on my birthday," Tony's voice was quiet, hurt. "At least he's predictable."
"It's not that." She looked contrite, apologetic, holding her palms out in a peace offering. Making her voice softer, gentler to deliver bad news in the way Clint knew Hill always did, she smiled sadly, tapping the large green tome under several papers. "This is the book he used?" Nodding, Nat fished it out of the pile and moved to hand it to Hill, but she shook her head. "I don't need to see it, Nat."
"What's that?" Steve asked, lavishing kisses on his neck.

, that Tony adored each time he felt covered and protected by him, apparently served another purpose. Howard - the nosy bastard - hadn't seen that it was
"I mean, I guess if you really want, but we set you up here so we would be close if you needed help." Steve slides forward, intending on standing to bring Tony to his room. "But, you may be right. Maybe you'll sleep better." It is a little shameful to realize none of them had figured that out before this. The couch is cushy and plush, large and cozy. Not a single one of them has been able to escape falling into a deep, restful sleep on it. But it's still not a bed.
"Victim, you mean."
But Howard freaking Stark, man, he wanted to let loose on him. Did it really matter if who Tony was in love with was the same gender as long as he was happy? Bruce didn't think so. But then again, he wasn't from the sixties.
? They pay
"I know you're all on edge, Agent Romanoff, so I'll let that slide." The right-hand corner of his lips was turned upwards in an amused smirk. "Believe it or not -- all of you, Tony included, have worked your way into my heart. And that's as much mushy bullshit as I'll allow. Fact is, I care a great deal about you." He addressed that last part at Tony, grinning at him. Tony smiled back hesitantly. "So excuse an old man for trying to ease you into it."
He'd let them believe what they wanted, but if they honestly thought he was going back without remembering, they were wrong. Howard never feared for his future prior to this. Not even a little bit. He greeted each day as a brand new set of hours to accomplish what he pleased. Worrying about what might happen was only asking for trouble. That was for Catholics and men in the fox hole.
sassy. I love it." Clint grinned, reaching across the counter for a napkin. "Just try insulting him, go on! Try it!" He subtly bumped Tony's shoulder, a silent promise to diffuse the tension as necessary.
To Bruce, he said he liked spanking. Not completely wrong, but it never made or broke sex for him. It was fun once in a while. And anyway, he needed something believable for him, Bruce knew the most about Tony.
Tony's fingers twitch. He wants to cover the blueprints, to shove Coulson away, to keep it secret for just a little longer. But he knows he can't. As much as this
Closing his eyes, Tony let one hand drag down to his cock, his breath coming out in a wisp as he moaned. "Steve..."
"Yes. We have. We were getting fed up with your obliviousness, Ant-Tony. You both deserve the utmost happiness," Thor stated, pushing the yogurt cup away from him. "But I wish you to hear this now. You are a commendable warrior: stalwart, brave. You are prepared to sacrifice yourself for the greater good, and that is not just in battle. I do not think I have ever met a man more kind and deserving of true love. You
"Then I wholly thank you for bringing me to bed. My hero." When he finished in the bathroom, Tony had every intention of stripping Steve and having his way with him. But as he stepped back into the bedroom, he found that Steve had beaten him to the punch. He was lounging in the bed, hands behind his head, naked as a jaybird.
"It is. Your wings can fold up inside your shell; it's like a magical space. Ever read Harry Potter?"
"Gotta wait that long? How much time you got?" Steve was already standing up, looking Tony up and down and walking towards him.
It's not.
Had Rhodey known -- back then -- everything Tony would accomplish, everything he would become, all the trauma he would have to go through to get there… Well. If he were being completely honest with himself, he would have wrapped Tony up and run away with him. He would have done anything to keep him safe. Superheroes and world advancement could find someone else.
With a blush, Tony hid his face in Steve's neck. "You're gonna be bad for my reputation."
"Not at all." But he was nodding his head yes, and Tony laughed.
"Then get your sneakers on, let's do some flying, get some coffee, and I'll make my mama's roast chicken for dinner while we watch." He nudged Tony away, reluctant to let him go but knowing he needed to in order to help Tony heal.
Howard moved over to the bar, sucking in deep breaths to calm himself. Screaming was getting them nowhere, "Mind if I have a drink?" He didn't wait for an answer, just walked behind the counter and grabbed a glass. Picking up a bottle and studying it, he said, "When were you, uh, thawed? Was it?"
A Steve that was protective as well as possessive of Tony? That had the engineer's cock taking notice. But the rest...it hit a little too close to home. Tony wanted Steve, all of him. Including the worry that the story gave.
"I'm starting to see that. And I admit it was foolish, even if this Howard is a decent guy. But that still doesn't mean you get to try and stop me."
"I just want to sleep a little longer."
"And you?" Bruce prodded, setting his hand on Steve's back again.
"MR STARK!"
"All of them?"
Tony watches as Happy drives away, waiting until he's turned out of the long drive before he enters the house. JARVIS greets him, and he feels a warmth permeate through his body at the AI's voice. It's like sinking into a hot bath. "Welcome home, sir."
In the dark of the kitchen, Tony buried himself in Steve's arms.
"It's the thought that counts."
"All right, all right! Shut your pie holes!"
she had figured out exactly how badly he needed her.
Tony shifted on the couch, tucking himself under Steve's arm further and blatantly using Steve's chest as his own personal pillow. On the television, Tom Hanks’s son fretted about getting into Stanford, while Jack Black vomited. It was one of Tony's favorites,
Steve stepped forward, gathering Tony into his arms. "I know it does. We have to hide in the public; we shouldn't have to hide here as well."
"I love you so much, you know that, right?" His eyes flickered up, looking at Tony.
"Two of them get paid by me, so yeah."
And they were left breathless and panting into each other's necks.
"And here I was thinking Tony would be the one to fuck up the relationship." She punched his arm, and he squeaked. "Ow! Must you always resort to violence?"
Steve flipped them, Tony's back landing on their shirts. He chuckled at Tony's undignified squeak, yanking off his jeans and boxers and pushing his legs up and open. "My absolute favorite," Steve murmured, pressing his face close and inhaling Tony's musky scent. "And it's all mine." He parted Tony's cheeks, revealing his pretty little hole and dove in, wasting no time in getting exactly what he wanted. Licking, biting, sucking… Slowly working Tony open as the legs on either side of his head quivered and trembled with the fight against closing them. He was so involved, he didn't feel Tony flail his arms to get into the nightstand drawer and toss the bottle of lube next to Steve.
to know."
But there were good moments as well, and they were beginning to outweigh all of the bad. Howard learning about new technology and loving it.  He and Tony making messes of their workshops as they went on inventing binges. The first time Howard went out in public and the response was surprisingly positive.
"Try convincing him of that."
"The whole island is. You won't find it on any map. Think of Valinor from Tolkien's mythology. Only those who know where to find it...can." Relaxing a little, Coulson leans back, his wings spreading ever so slightly to accommodate him. "Angels need vacations too, you know. We can burn out like any human. There are resorts and hidden land all over the earth that's just for us. They are all employed by retired angels who got bored and needed something to do." At Tony's incredulous look, he explains, "When you spend hundreds of years working, retiring to Heaven can be a bit mundane. Some stay forever, some come for a time and then leave again, others still opt to find new work at the resorts or just live out their lives in their shells, switching and moving every fifty years or so. It's entirely up to the individual."
"And we'll help you." It was so earnest, so sweet, so not Natasha that Tony had to look away to get his emotions under control. "And it is Steve." She continued. "I wasn't going to say anything, I was going to let this play out, but you're so in denial, I got fed up." She paused, reaching out to turn his face back to hers, "He loves you. So much that he's willing to live vicariously through fanfiction just to get a taste of being with you."
"I'm not." Together, they worked off Tony's sneakers and socks, though Bruce let Steve tug his pants off. He folded and placed them on the dresser as Steve somehow managed to get the sweater Tony wore off over his head. "I'm not exactly happy you three decided to go galavanting around blowing things up, but..." Pausing, Steve kicked off his own pants and grabbed a pair of pajama bottoms he had discarded when they woke him up. "But," he continued, tugging them on and tying the drawstring, "I can understand that Tony needed it. And you."
"That's the point, Steven," he pulled back to say, his hand pumping in place of his mouth, "this is about you right now." Steve had no answer. He fell back against the bed as Tony took him in his mouth again, hips rocking gently as he was brought to the brink and pushed over, crying out as he came down Tony's throat.
Tony shrugged, looking at Rhodey with a glint in his eyes. "Have we met, dear Rhododendron?"
Laughing, Tony joked, "There was a moment."
The pillow loses his scent by the next morning.
redeemable as he was at that moment: Howard Stark from 1961, who had yet to fall into whatever awful abyss he would tumble into that would make him hurt his child. This Howard - so much closer to the one Steve had known - was affable, funny, and caring. Instead of lashing out at or just ignoring Tony, he attempted to forge a relationship between the two, taking on a fatherly role he wasn't exactly ready for. He dove in head first and regardless of his missteps, continued to try.
"Maybe. But…" Tony pauses, looking away and out at the night sky, "sometimes it's easier not sleeping." He speaks cautiously like he's treading across a busy intersection. If he reveals that he's going one way, maybe the drivers will notice and slow down for him. "I don't have very pleasant dreams anymore," he continues, hoping that by being honest about his own mental state for once, Steve might follow suit. "All the missions, the monsters, the deaths we can't seem to avoid… It's built up. I'm… I'm worn out like I don't think I've ever been, not even in Afghanistan, but sleeping brings nothing but exaggerated reminders. It really sucks." Holding his hands out, Tony turns them palm up, showing that they are empty.
He hits end again, turning to face Bruce. "This has to be a mistake!"
"Now, see, that's why I keep you around. Brand loyalty."
"My son is a genius!" Howard was all grins, beaming across the room. "
. He had sworn he would attain what was rightfully his, and he did. Along with the crown of fear that came with it. It was satisfying.
Instead, Tony squawked, affronted and offended by the implication. "Hey!"
Tony turned his head to kiss Steve's wrist, such a sweet, saccharine action from a man known to take what he wanted without warning. "Yes."
Do me a solid and comment if you loved it? Also, have any requests? Feed my ego and shit.
"No," Tony whined, clinging to Steve to keep him from getting up. "I'm too comfy. This is where I live now."
"Did you break down?"
The woman on the television shuffles the papers in front of her. "Just in, the US Coast Guard is reporting that there are no survivors. Again, Singapore Air Flight 328 out of Singapore has gone down off the coast of California. And there are no survivors."
"Only if this shell needs to age that far, otherwise I look 33."
Despite it being easy to assemble, he took his time, adding milk, protein powder, and a handful of spinach for the nutritional benefits. To satisfy his need to actually see Tony chew something, Steve used the ridiculously small frying pan to cook up an egg and a slice of ham and pulverized an avocado with a little too much gusto than was strictly necessary.
Tony nodded and slid another plate from the cabinet. They helped him load it up, never questioning what he was doing, because they knew.
Steve stumbled into his pants, his face a mixture of guilt and pride. "I hit
"I got this," he smirked, pulling from Tony's grasp and standing. To music only he heard, he swayed. Pulling his shirt over his head and dipping his fingers, teasingly, at the waistband of his jeans. He was putting a show on for Tony. The button popped open, and he was halfway into lowering the zipper when Tony sat up to reach for him. "Too slow!" He whined impatiently, grabbing at the zipper.
But I am available for any questions, of course."
Rahib laughed, his face friendly as he loaded the brown cardboard food boxes with the hot dogs. "That's fifty, but for you, my beautiful friend, I charge forty."
kotenok?"
"Most likely. But who's counting?" Sitting, Tony picked up the filled glass that was slid over to him. "But really. I, uh, I know I was difficult. You know. With not wanting to go to the doctor. I'm sorry for that."
"Show off," Tony grumbles as he struggles to lift the head. Steve only grins and hoists the smaller ball up and onto the larger one. They're not as smooth and circular as Tony's, but Steve has shaped them with the tops slightly tapered. It's an artist's touch, and Tony thinks they're perfect.
He heard a sharp intake of breath and hugged Tony tighter, bringing his hand up to cup the back of his head. "Tell me what I can do?"
"I'm good."
Grabbing Rhodey's arm, Tony tugged him down to plant a big, fat, obnoxious kiss on his cheek. "You are filet mignon to me, Rhodey-Bear!"
It didn't matter that three different Howards were warring within Steve, or that Tony was most likely feeling the same internal battle. They could weather this together. And though he missed Bucky tremendously and felt envy at seeing others with their best friends, he could take comfort that Tony could fill those missing pieces within him. Both best friend and lover, like a bonus.
"More than you think."
"Who you calling doll, loser?"
Bruce answered silently.
"Like that woman in the video said, it doesn't matter who you are, no one gets a free pass to grab at you like you're nothing but a package of meat."
"Do what?"
We're getting into the meat of the story now, and I'd like to apologize for the delay in uploading. Hopefully, I'll have the next chapter by next Monday.
Over his shoulder as he returned to the kitchen, Clint shot back, "You walked right into that one!"
"Your son, in the Iron Man armor, flew it up into space and aimed it at their ship instead. He's the reason we won. He's the reason this city is still standing."
"Get your cute ass moving! We leave in 20!" Natasha's voice sounded a bit muffled through the wooden frame.
"Nope, definitely yours. Got some nasty ones too."
Tony was off the stool and in his arms in an instant, something snapping inside him. He buried his face in Steve's chest, fists clenched into Steve's t-shirt. "I told him." His voice was hitched, and Steve felt his guilt drop down and his need to protect push forward again.
do it—had done it before.
"Get off him."
Tony shot him an incredulous look, "I'll take 'Things that are never going to happen for 500,' Alex!’"
"Why? What's the fun in that?"
"How do you know?"
Thank you all for reading and please tell me what you think!
"I don't know," Tony chuckled, "think it's been your turn for the past few months."
Steve slipped his arm around Tony's waist, giving him a squeeze to show how proud he was of Tony's actions. "Goodnight, Howard," he said.
Hill shook her head, "No, I can't."
"Suit yourself," he responded easily, snagging a piece of toast Natasha had just buttered right from her hand and backing out of the room, "now, if you don't mind, I need a shower. I smell like vodka."
Reaching out, he took Tony's hand in his own and squeezed it, smiling tightly before standing and turning to face his judgment. This Fury held the answers, and whether or not they were what Howard wanted to hear was irrelevant. He would take the punch, and he would find a way.
"Please, spare me what was promising to be an equally lame diatribe commending your so-called awesomeness. Just read it. And when you do, we'll commence book club." With that, she hung up. Tony was left staring at his phone.
"But the big game is this weekend!"
"Come on, sugar, you must be used to this with a face and ass like that."
"Why are you out here?" Tony continued. "It's freezing."
If anyone used their heads, it would have been obvious. At least those in attendance were starting to put the pieces together.
Tony huffed, his arms crossing over his chest. Which unfortunately drew attention to the arc reactor under his shirt.
That night, while getting ready for bed, Tony wrapped his arms around Steve's waist and pressed his face into his shoulder. "I love you," he whispered, "but I need you to let me make the call on this."
Time split in two. And the Howard on the side of the spell was pulled by his navel and tossed through time, landing in a flash of light at the feet of two men, although he only had eyes for one.
"Mommy, he saved us, didn't he?"
"Steve-" he began, stepping forward to block Steve's escape, "-wait. We need to talk."
Tony comes to, out of the armor. He doesn't remember hitting the release latch, he doesn't remember stumbling across the field, and he sure as hell doesn’t remember getting hit in the first place. The puddle he passed out in is cold and muddy; he groans and rolls onto his back, the cold seeping through his undersuit like roots coming up through the earth to entrap him. His ribs ache, and his wrist is swollen, the skin starting to darken with a purple blossom. It's a few minutes before he moves again, this time to his knees, the fingers of his left hand curled into the gritty slosh as the pain takes his breath away. His right hand is cradled to his chest, but the solid bumps from the arc reactor aren't helping. He whimpers, the sound coming out involuntarily.
When he returned, he kissed Tony again and lifted him into his arms like he weighed nothing at all. "Steve!" He protested, but it was all in show. To feel so cared for, so loved...he didn't think he could ever adequately elucidate what that was like.
"What?" Rhodey's eyebrows were furrowed, looking horrified and surprised all in one.
"I was not giving you an option, Stark." Two large strides across the room, and he was in the front of the smaller man, towering over him. "Where are your quarters?"
Howard's face paled, and he stumbled backwards until his knees hit the edge of the couch, sinking down. He couldn't meet Steve's eyes. "I know. Which is why I need your help. Anything, Steve, do you hear me? Anything I can do to ease the hurt I caused." He floundered for a moment, mouth opening and closing with all the words he needed to say but couldn't. "I will be that man. But not yet." Swallowing, he finally lifted his eyes to connect with Steve's. "So, this is my only shot at being the father I could have been."
It was awkward the first few weeks as they all learned to live with each other when Howard took over and redecorated Steve's little efficiency apartment.  Meanwhile, Steve moved in with Tony, and Howard spent most of his time in their suite. There were hiccups, dark moments where Howard would find a picture of Maria or learn about how something ended that he had started. Steve had found him near tears several times, photo albums open in his lap and his hands in his hair, lamenting everything he’d missed.
All that practice, and he couldn't even help himself through one.
"Sure, go ahead." She made no move to get up, or to turn around, so he made a face and went back into the bathroom. As he closed the door, she yelled out, "Spoilsport!"
"The hell it doesn't count! You've seen what he did to him! You were there to witness it first hand!"
"No." Turning, she headed toward her kitchenette. "He wouldn't risk losing Tony over that. Tea?" The kettle was already on the stove, steam rising from the spout. Steve might hurt Howard, but he wouldn't chance altering Tony's birth, his temper notwithstanding.
The world fades away.
"My apologies."
particular situation that had him all...bajiggity."
He does his best to maintain an air of professionalism, but his cheeks burn red as he carefully pulls Tony's shirt off. He almost flees after helping him step out of his pajama bottoms, his eyes anywhere but on the man in front of him. Tony, at the very least, is too tired to protest or make any snappy comebacks.
Howard Stark knew science. He knew things that were absolute. He
"He needs what they call a celiac panel, bloodwork from the doctor." Clint answered. "Then we'll know for sure."
"He didn't. I'm not involved in this equation.
"You still think it's a bad idea." Tony didn't move from his Steve burrito, upset that they weren't on the same page but reluctant to lose contact regardless.
Natasha was a people watcher. Unashamedly. She could spend hours sitting on a bench in Central Park or taking up the corner both at a cafe. Sitting against the pillars between the entrances to track 17 and tracks 18 and 19 at Penn Station was a favorite of hers. She could sit, almost invisible, eating a slice from Rose's Pasta and Pizzeria and sipping on a beer in a brown paper bag, and just watch. During the week, it was all commuters from Long Island, standing in front of the electronic board and waiting for their track to be announced before herding down the steps in a fight to grab a seat and bitching about changing in Jamaica. On the weekends, it was the drunk crowd. Girls and guys, dressed in their partying best, high heels clicking against the floors and screams and shouts of drunken fun. Boyfriends carrying their inebriated girlfriends, arranging for taxis and Ubers to pick them up at their stations, and making plans to meet for brunch the next day.
Bruce shook his head, "Later, this conversation isn't done. Go get your shield!"
After a few minutes, he stood and made his way to the bathroom to clean himself up, and curled back under the covers, naked and sated, reaching around the floor until his fingers closed around his phone.
"A belt. His fists. Sometimes a cigar. Whatever caught his fancy."
could do
His keys clanged when they hit the metal bowl just inside his door. He dropped his wallet on top and toed off his sneakers, letting out an exhausted sigh. Natasha was relentless. She meant well, but sometimes she was just too much.
Steve sat, back to Tony, on the ground. Laptop open and scrolling through a Word document. Tony wondered what this story was about. He wondered at the way the city lights reflected off the blond locks, the way his shirt had ridden up—just a little in the back—leaving a smooth expanse of skin, and the way Steve's concentration was so wholly on his fictional world that he didn't hear Tony approach.
"Yes! We'll buy things that are organic, right? Check the ingredients. Natural stuff, with no preservatives." Natasha was already digging through the pantry to find the reusable bags she knew were in there. "If we can divide and conquer, it shouldn't take long."
"Because things have happened that have made people-" Steve paused, obviously regrouping, "-that made things a certain way. You change anything and it could change the entire course of the world."
He was stronger than Howard, taller too, but this was Howard Stark. This was an imposing figure, a man he had seen in some regard throughout his entire life. Television, newspapers, magazines… He was larger than life. It was sheer chance that Rhodey became Tony's roommate the year before, and sometimes it bothered Rhodey immensely at how easily it could have been someone else. Someone less patient, someone greedier.
"A voice, earlier, is what told me that there was food. And I've heard you all talking to something. And calling it Jarvis."
"What?" The spoon dropped to Tony's plate. Rhodey picked it up and pointedly put it back in Tony's hand.
"Because I love you."
"But why?"
you, knew you -- could see that you were an abuse survivor."
Clint throws his head back and laughs. "I'll keep that in mind." He shoulders the quiver and picks up the case he had just placed his bow into. "But for real, Stark? The fact that Phil went out of his way to introduce you to me? Chuffed as
"I missed you too."
"Of course I knew! But I was sworn to secrecy, Anthony." He shrugged, an impish smile on his face.
"Those aren't the right words at all," he teased, cupping the back of Steve's neck to bring him down for another kiss. "The right words are:
Steve laughed, "I wasn't going to walk. I was going to take the subway."
Steve sat up, hoisting Tony to balance in his lap and removed his shirt, tossing it to the side of the bed. "Who you calling old, you geezer?"
"That's… that's…."
"Nat." Steve said in warning.
Tony woke up warm and comfortable, his head pillowed on Steve's torso, the lull of his heartbeat soothing and rhythmic. He let his hand glide down Steve's chest feeling his skin, the curves to his muscles… and a familiar warmth started to build inside Tony. He grinned and let his hand trail further down, slipping into Steve's boxers and wrapping around his length.
"Maybe it takes some time? You know? To get it out of his system." Clint said quietly.
"Yeah, I mean no. I mean, our fans, how much do they know?" He glanced up from the screen.
And the sad part? She knew he actually believed it.
"In today's terms, I'm bisexual." Steve's voice was cold. "That's different than gay but still queer." Before Howard could speak again, Steve turned his back on him and gathered Tony into his arms, kissing him softly. "Come on, angel, let's go to bed."
"That would be nice." From one of the drawers in her desk, she picked up a bag of Hershey's Kisses and slid them across the wooden surface. Chocolate always helped to placate Tony, and he shook his head in amused resignation before shoving his hand in the bag and plucking out a handful. She knew him too well.
"Oh, shut up!" But Steve was smiling.
"Why aren't you?" Tony inquiries gently, taking a seat next to Steve.
"I knew there was a catch."
Tony moaned, "No. Never wanted to risk it. You?"
"Did it?"
Tony lay on his back, legs spread and bent at the knees, his eyes--still bright--half lidded, and his mouth swollen with the kisses. "In my bag in the corner, I gots Vaseline."
"You mean ruin the fun? No way. They'll figure it out eventually."
"Likewise, Doctor," Tony breathed, moving to catch his other nipple, giving it the same treatment. Steve retaliated by sliding his fingers close to Tony's scalp and pulling -- just the right amount, and Tony's knees almost gave out at the pleasure that gave him. Steve carefully leaned him back into the chair, and Tony's legs automatically lifted to brace on the arms.
"That man-" she spat out, pointing the knife at him, "-is a homophobic piece of...of.. дерьмо!"
It was almost torture, but Steve waited until they were in the hallway to wrap an arm around Tony's waist possessivly. If Tony noticed the edge of his tension, he didn't say anything. Nor did he comment when Steve lay down on the couch in Tony's living room and pulled him so he was laying on top, his legs on either side of Steve's and his head tucked under his chin.
"That makes two of us. Think Bruce will have any ideas?"
There's no answer, and Tony gingerly leans back. The moment he settles his weight onto his calves, a burst of pain flares through his left foot. "Fuck!" He tries to swallow the sob, but it's too much. He hurts from head to toe. "Guys, please, I'm hit. I'm down. Anyone?" Silence, and Tony reluctantly lifts his right hand to check his com. It's gone.
"Oh, shut up, you big baby," she teased, opening the door. "We'll continue this discussion later."
Tony's face crumbled, and immediately Rhodey pulled him into his arms, cupping the back of his head and rubbing his back. Letting Tony cry, giving him something solid to hold on to while he let it all out. This wasn't just the breakup or the coming out. This wasn't even about the assemble call. This was everything, built up over the last -- was it nine? Ten days? -- it didn't matter how long at this point. Tony had reached his threshold. He was done. And Rhodey was content to hold his best friend and allow him to cry it out, however long he needed.
"Barton!"
"Of course, Tony." She kissed his cheek and stood. "I'll call you tomorrow morning. I have to go down to the office. Unless you want to come with." It was an invitation to talk, and she had left the ball in Tony's court to make the decision if he wanted to talk privately or not.
"Steve! Fuck, yes, oh god, come in me, baby, please, fuck, I want it all!"
Rinsing, Steve smiled as he tilted his head back.
"I know." She laughed quietly. "I know you don't mean it. Teasing is just how you show you care."
It's basic math, darling. He doesn't know it was me. But he knows it was
Sometimes, it felt like someone had taken a shard of glass and was cutting him open from the inside out, other times he would vomit up everything he’d just consumed. Some days, there was nothing. Literally. He would sit in the bathroom, cramping and cursing everything in existence while other days it would come on too fast and too painful. He could never predict what would happen. It was safer to just stay at home.
Tony snorted. "Physical impossibility. And not just because you're a man. If anyone's getting pregnant, it would be me."
"You guys looked...cozy." she frowned, eyeing them both, particularly Tony in Steve's sweater.
"But, Brucie Bear!" Tony exclaimed, "Then they'd be glow in the dark!"
It made Bruce all the more loyal. All the more protective.
"Nothing left to kill?" She gave him a look. "Maim? Destroy?"
Despite the cold, Tony feels warm.
time to wake up."
"Eh."
replied: Just a guess.
"Starkpad, huh? You created this as well?"
"We figured," Bruce said, and Tony could tell he was on speaker by the echo he heard of his own voice when he responded.
"Angels do karaoke?"
"Shows what you know, you fucking
There was silence for all of five seconds before those near them in the car erupted in cheers. Others further down were looking up curiously. But the three fans stood silently, their phones still out. They were near each other, young and full of piss and vinegar. Quiet, but happily filming a celebrity getting sexually harassed.
"Four deluxe burgers coming up. Cheese?"
"You'd tell me, right?" He cupped Tony's face, gently rubbing his thumbs back and forth across his cheeks. Eyes closing, Tony leaned into the touch.
"Nat's been growing rosemary, basil, thyme, and parsley." He answered, opening the fridge again to grab the garlic and butter. "Get the salt for me, por favor?"
In the office, Tony was huddled in another of Steve's hoodies; he was wearing his own jeans, but they were belted tighter to fit him. What was once a pair of blue denim tailored to fit his curvy and lean frame now hung off his hips and looked almost sloppy.
"You have a piece of every business in this neighborhood! You made them fear you!"
Sitting back at the island, he turned the chips around, opening pointed toward her.
, that much was abundantly clear. It would do no good, regardless. Tony had been right. Howard had to be told, it was the best way to take control of the situation.
Something sparked between them, and Steve cracked. He dropped the wad of cash on the table by the door and grabbed Tony, pushing him against the wall and kissing him hard.
"No problem. Happens to me more than I'd ever admit." She still looked uneasy, but her smile was friendly, "My son," she gestured to the excited boy behind her, "he was wondering if he could have a picture?"
"Think he'll kill Howard?" She could tell he was only partly joking, but it was the part that wasn't that worried her.
, looking for a quick buck.
Tony thought. He mused over what Thor said, chewing on it like he was the cake. "I think you're right." He paused and looked at the god. "You're pretty wise, old man."
What was the difference? Steve wasn't so sure anymore.
"I know you would, Mr. Stark." Fury was actually chuckling. The sound was so absurd during such an awful moment that Howard took a step back, eyes going wide. Fury just clasped his shoulder. "Have a seat. There's a light at the end of this tunnel." All at once it felt like a balloon deflating after being blown up with too much air -- it has been too taut. The releasing of the air felt good. The entire room let out a breath, those words piercing the tense atmosphere.
Tony gave him a shy grin, and boy, was that turning Steve on. A timid Tony? He wasn't really (at least not usually), Steve knew this, but just the thought had him quaking. There was something about this that had Tony slowing down. With his other partners, it was just a chance to get off, which was always more fun with friends, but this? This was what he had longed for. He was nervous, but so ready.
Again, Tony looked awed. "My hero."
"You never whacked a guy before, have ya?" He asked, a hint of mischievousness in his voice.
"Good. Now tell me what transpired last night."
"Now, if you could say that at the next award ceremony I'm forced to attend, that would be perfect." Taking the cellphone box from Clint's hand, he popped it open and pulled out the device. Clint sat next to him, picking up his drink and frowning as he looked into it.
"He won't sleep for more than twenty minutes at a time. It's fitful. I'm worried."
On the floor. Bruce's face is priceless. I want to meme it."
They both turned to look cheekily at Tony, who stood in front of the cabinets with three dishes in hand, looking unamused. He pointed to Bruce, "No science bros experiments for a week! And you!" He pointed at Steve, "No sex for a month!"
"Oh!" Bruce perked up, "Thor's here?"
"And what about you?" Bruce asked astutely. Tony could hear the clanking of beakers and phials, and he found himself missing his workshop and Bruce's lab, quiet nights bent over their experiments, joking with each other and doing eighth grade science projects just for the fuck of it. It had been days since he let himself fall into the security of his work. Howard had derailed any attempt he made.
Howard was drunk. And Natasha realized she may have miscalculated in her attempt to make the situation better. Contrary to what Clint and Tony liked to say, alcohol
Howard nodded, finally looking up at Thor. "I wanted to find Steve."
"But it smells so good!"
He had dropped to his knees beside Tony, blocking him from Howard.
"All of you! Everyone with a penis!" She threw her hands into the air, exasperated. "Tony
He grabbed another few pieces, unwrapping them with just his left fingers. He was adept at it. Kisses were his weakness, and she knew it. "It's not, I mean-" He shoved three in his mouth at once and spoke around them. "-When it's just us with no mention of Howard, it's fine. We have amazing sex, we can have intellectual conversations, and we crack each other up. But since dear old dad dropped in, I don't know, Pep. He keeps talking for me. Acting for me."
a universal truth."
"If you don't mind," Hill interrupted, standing abruptly and shoving her hands in her pockets, "we don't have much time."
"Mine now."
"I do. I'm sorry about what I eventually do to him, Miss Potts, believe me. I hate myself for it more than any of you could." To hide his embarrassment at the admission (and he wasn't doing a good job given that she noticed), he buried his face behind the menu.
"I don't exactly have the best track record, you know."
But that didn't mean what they were going to do couldn't be special. It didn't mean he couldn't make it so good that the memory would keep him warm, even in the dry heat of the deep South.
"They're just making sure you're staying," Steve gently corrected. "They've both been through a lot."
"Oh my God...!" Tony moaned. Steve was about as close to a perfect fit as he could possibly be. No one had ever filled him so wholly ever before. "That feels amazing and you haven't even moved yet!"
"I know. And she'd want you to eat."
It was a picture of Steve, framed against a crumbled Manhattan, with Tony in his suit in the background. The Chitauri Invasion. Steve's shield was in mid-air, flying back to him and Tony had his arms out, repulsers charging. The sign underneath was typed out in bold letters.
. We know our way around this business. We've been burnt, kicked, chewed up, and spit out like a bad piece of beef jerky.
Unable to keep any modicum of composure, Tony turned his head to Hill, his face painted with fear and shock, like a child's art project: All haphazard splatter of bold colors. "Please," his voice was hoarse with his panic, loud, uncontrolled. Wavering with the implications. "Hill, for the love of of fucking everything! Tell me there's a way! Tell me I'm not going to die? To-to not exist?"
But nothing he or anyone else said could convince Tony to just see a damn doctor.
talk. Just not right away. For the moment, Tony really needed physical connection.
"Agreed."
They took the stairs, jogging down to the common living room. Both sighed in unison as they watched Howard, pressed up against the glass windows like a kid staring into a department store at Christmas as Rhodey landed in the War Machine suit.
"I know," Tony relents, "but I think I can improve on it. Make it safe. I think...Phil, I'm onto something here. Something big. Something that can save a whole lot of lives, not just your charges, but everyone else's."
"Right. Well." Visibly swallowing, Howard looked down. "I know what I do to Tony. I'm not proud of what I become."
. "Clint, right?"
Rhodey studiously ignored him. He was too good at that, to be fair, and Tony was getting rusty at shocking a reaction from him. "Do you love him?"
Thor tried not to make it a habit to lie, even to himself, which meant openly admitting that the only mortal to scare him was the tiny, fierce redhead. And maybe Pepper Potts.
"Then we keep trying. Tony, listen, I don't know much about time travel." Letting his fingers trail up Tony's face, he gently cupped his cheeks, tilting Tony's head so he could look into his eyes. "But you're still here, right? You haven't vanished into thin air?"
someone else on the payroll, but a half-hour into the meeting and Fury looks thrilled. As much as a guy with one eye and resting bitch face could look thrilled, anyway. They're talking over a potential contact when a woman enters. She's petite, brunette, and right away, Tony knows she's tough.
"You deserve more than this." The tower came into view, and Tony released a breath he didn't realize he was holding.
"That's not true." But she said it without much conviction. She was well aware of how fickle the media was. Iron Man they loved. Tony? Not so much. It angered her to no end. But then again, she was no stranger to the ebb and flow of society's emotions regarding those they considered celebrities.
The sweater stayed on, and he flopped back on his bed, shoving a few pillows underneath himself and grabbing the lube, the dildo, and the vibrator from his nightstand. It never hurt to be prepared.
Howard, so obsessed with finding Captain Rogers that he forcefully used his own child's intelligence to try to accomplish that.
"I've never known you to second guess yourself like this." She didn't answer him, so he continued, "No, I think you're right. Tony needs this. And maybe we all need this as well. Some bull shit about catharsis or something like that."
"God, you're so stupid sometimes."
The vent shut up.
The morning light filters across the floor. Steve watches as the shadows grow with the rising sun, his head propped up on his fist. He hasn't slept. He's rumpled, unshaven, hungry.
But it was also Howard's. Because one day Howard would turn, and he would beat and belittle his own son into a damaged shadow, always hurting, constantly hiding. He would be the reason for the self-destructive behavior. The self-sabotaging actions that made up most of Tony's life.
She was losing ground quickly.
"It has." As Howard stepped toward him, Tony moved away, circling around the room until he was near the door.
Which was such a dumb idiom, really. It made him think of sex on ice.
"Oh yeah. Just peachy."
Steve had to shake his head and take a sip of his tea to push the thoughts from his mind. He had writing to do. The scene on the subway was rolling about in his brain. It was all any of the fans could talk about. No one was happy that Tony apparently thought so little of himself; it was shock to the system. Steve knew, and so did the rest of the team. He was sure Pepper, Rhodey, and probably Happy knew as well. Tony could hide his insecurities from the public all he wanted, but to those who saw him almost everyday? It had become painfully obvious.
, Tony?" Howard's voice rose with intensity, "
"But you're super human."
He gave her a 'who me?' look and turned back to the drawer that held the takeout menus.
Draping his body over Tony's, Steve kissed every available piece of skin he could reach, his hips rocking hard and fast into him, drinking up every moan he pulled from Tony's throat.
Howard Stark was nothing like he'd pictured him. Most of the photos he had seen showed an older Howard, white hair and mustache, skinny, and distinguished. Always with a drink or a cigar. He had met the man only a few times while at MIT. Brief interactions that usually involved him dragging Tony away for some ridiculous reason in the middle of the night. Some research, some
He took a moment before he knocked to steel his nerves, breathing deeply and counting his exhales.
He ate fruit, munched on raw vegetables, and ate soup. As much as he was growing bored with the lack of variation, he was feeling better than he had in awhile. Natasha got him a treat of vanilla ice cream and when he kept that down, she allowed him a bowl of Rice Chex the next morning, so he didn't have to eat soup for breakfast.
Clint was unamused. "Rule number sixty-nine, don't talk about Cap's sex life, got it." Nat smacked his arm, and he grinned sheepishly. She was right to stop him, although maybe not so violently. He was so used to cracking jokes about Steve and Tony that it had come out without him even thinking about it. They were the couple that gave him hope for love, of course, but that didn't mean he couldn't poke fun at the low hanging fruit.
"That was Bruce. He wanted to know if we would like to go to lunch with him later. Or a late brunch. Anything to get out of this godforsaken tower. His words, not mine."
"You created this. It's beautiful. Just like you are." And he pressed one hand over it, feeling the warmth of it, the slight hum.
One last kiss and Steve was standing, pulling reluctantly from Tony, grabbing his go-bag, and headed towards the door. "If I can, I'll call. But Tony," he looked at him sternly, the concerned boyfriend all the way, "don't stay up all night waiting."
"They did say to create what you know."
you."
that this could be easy on you. But it's not."
"His suite, with Steve and Bruce," she nodded toward the door. "Go ahead, we can hold down the fort. I found another bottle of vodka."
"What?" Steve was saying, turning from the painting he was looking at and catching sight of the sign. "Oh! Well. Had no idea about that."
Cradling the tall glass in his hand, Tony dutifully took a few gulps, but each one looked forced. He glanced up at Steve to see if he approved of the amount, and Steve begrudgingly nodded, taking the cup from his hands.
"What year is this?!"
"No problem." He disappears. And Steve has another half hour of holding Tony to look forward to.
"Give it ten more years of being his best friend, you'll get one too. Is he all right?"
So the prompt, you'll notice, is vibes in public but I kinda failed at that. However, it did prompt the whole part and that was their intention, so I'm calling it a win.
"We'll be good once we get you on, though!" Walking back over, Clint slides the arrow back into the quiver. "I'm a bit chuffed, you know."
"Tony, do you love me?" Steve takes the anger easily. His voice is barely a whisper, wonder set on his face.
He gave her a sheepish grin, "Just trying to lighten the mood, honey-cakes." Neither he or Steve bothered with shoes or socks. It was cute in a way, and maybe if Nat wasn't dreading breaking their little bubble, she would have pointed it out.
Barton didn't wait for an invitation, stepping up next to them on their right. "So pretty." His voice was strained, his hand moving quickly inside his boxers.
"Oh, but such a sweet death!"
make things blow up. That's Tony's wheelhouse."
"I'll take your word for it. Tony-" standing, she came around the desk to crouch beside the chair and take his hand, "-what are you going to do about it?"
The sounds of the party vanish in an instant. The silence hurts. It's too sudden, too confusing. He rolls his head to the side, and there's Steve. He tries to smile, but he's too tired, too worn out from living, an exhaustion that has smothered him since childhood. When he falls unconscious this time, he welcomes the darkness.
"What-?"
"We can adjust," Bruce said, taking the black coffee and nodding his thanks, "I'm less worried about Cedar Park and more worried about Chicago. I didn't like their security last time."
it's four."
we all were a little
"Feel better," the doctor stood, shaking his hand again. "I'll see you in two months."
"That's us!" Clint raised his hand at the maitre d', walking forwards with Tony behind him. They followed to their table, sitting and picking up the menus. "I want a big, fat, juicy steak. Covered in butter."
"Fantastic," he grumbled, watching as she left. As an afterthought, he called out, "And I love him for it!"
It was hard to formulate the words. Even knowing that if he could say them to anyone, it would always be his best friend. Turning to once again stare out the window, Tony watched as the rain let up. He took a deep breath and focused on the lightest part of the clouds outside, the sun pushing through stubbornly.
"Oh? Then why don't you get these things off me."
"I can't-" Howard faltered. "I get that. But you don't know for sure-"
He heard Natasha groan, "Again. You're a child. Anyway, wanted to know if you read the new story yet."
"Steven!"
"Of course! The Boss only cares about what's in your heart and you, evidently, have a good one. But I still need your name."
He really is beautiful.
He had been at the mercy of Howard's moods.
That startled a laugh out of Tony; he always enjoyed when Steve referenced his favorite things. "I know. I love you, Sam." He could wait another hour, Steve knew. If anything it meant he could ignore the situation for just a little longer. Tony wasn't the only one well versed in his boyfriend's thought processes.
be in his position?
Embarrassed, but trying to hide it, Howard nodded. "Yeah, that sounds great."
It wasn't healthy, and Steve knew he should really get Tony up and doing something productive, but he couldn't bring himself to force it. Instead, he bent down to kiss his forehead and smiled sadly. "I'll bring up some food in a little bit. Rest, angel."
"Baby, no." He took Tony's face into his hands, rubbing his thumbs across his cheeks. "I don't know what happened, but none of this is your fault."
long (and no, random sex didn't count) meant that as soon as someone offered him love, Tony flung himself at it.
"How else do you think I made all my money?"
It took all of ten seconds before he was exploring. Steve had said to stay, not that he couldn't look around. He needed to know when in time he was to begin with, and knowing exactly where he was, well, that was pertinent information as well. He
Tony moaned as he pushed the dildo into his ass. Stopping just after his rim like Steve did in the story, and then gradually going deeper until he couldn't push any further without losing the toy inside himself. When he drew it back out, the tip rubbed against his prostate, making him throw his head back and moan again.
"You are really super duper lame."
All around him, Tony watched as the eyes flickered like street lamps. He remembered other eyes, sadder eyes. Eyes of his teachers, of businessmen, the scientists he worked with from a young age. Their eyes sliding quickly to the exposed bruises on his wrists, or his black eye, or the stains of tears on his cheeks. To the ghosts he had behind his eyes.
He turned to enter the bedroom, but something hit him in the back of his head and tumbled to the floor. "This works too." Tony chuckled, picking up the still warm hoodie Steve had been wearing and pulling it over his head. "I always prefer when they smell like you anyway."
"I...M...no, that's an N. Y...O...U...R...A...S --" leaning back from the machine, Tony turned to look at him, eyes unfocused and furrowed. "Dr. Rogers?"
She directed herself toward Howard. "The book you used, that very spell-" She moved her eyes over to Tony briefly, gauging him before flicking back to Howard and staring, obviously annoyed, upset, and at a loss before continuing, "-has only been used once before. At least to my knowledge. What I know of it is simple: You come to the future, and you stay there. There is no return trip. Mr. Stark. To be blunt, you will not be going home. The man who we know of that used the exact spell you did is still here as well. He is living in San Francisco. Currently. In this time. And he will die in this time as well."
“Tony, just wait until the first time my temper flares over something stupid! Or how I hoard food like I'm never going to eat again.” He shook his head disparagingly. “And the nightmares, don't get me started on those! Tony, damn, Tony." He threw him arms out, giving it all he had. "We're all a little bit of a mess. But that doesn't mean you're not good enough."
"Exactly. I was all over the place at first. Grasping at anything that gave me some semblance of feeling normal and okay. I went on a road trip. I visited Peggy, I kept searching and searching for something to make sense. It was only when I started to accept and build a new life that things settled down. And you? You're going to feel the same. But this time-- this time the traveler isn't alone. I want to help you, Howard. I want to help you adjust. If you'll have me, that is."
Sitting back, Rhodey twisted his body to hook his hands into the handles of the tray and brought it around, settling it on Tony's lap. "I'm only asking that you eat -- let's say -- 50 percent off this tray, cookies included." He picked up one half of the sandwich, holding it out to Tony, "Cream cheese and jelly. Your favorite abomination that I think only Italian Americans eat. You heathens."
Tony's time, Steve. I just think that he's excited about finding out he has a kid. I mean, I know I would be-"
No one knew she did this.
"Likewise," Steve chuckled, a bit strained at the feeling of hardness between his legs.
, Steve knew it was imperative that he was there for him.
"I can't let you do that." Sitting on the side of the bed, Steve reached out and brushed the hair from Tony's head. "A smoothie and a shower. That's all I ask. And then I'll leave you alone."
"Uhm, sorry? I guess, I just don't know any of you." Really, he never did have much of a sense of self-preservation.
"He's the big brother I never wanted, and tough. Stop being a jerk."
"I was angry at first, upset and all over the place," he began, popping a Kiss into his mouth, "but then Howard started showing pride in me, especially after I told him who I was. And it just, I don't know, Pepper, it felt good."
"Well then," James was saying, "he actually did it."
"You just had a snack!"
"Let me finish. Please." Steve nodded, and Tony continued, his voice thick with emotion. "You should never have had to choose between me and Howard. You should never have felt the need to protect me like this." Steve moved to interrupt again, and Tony barreled on, cutting off whatever he was going to say. "This has put a lot of strain on both of us. And I-" He switched gears. Better to put the entirety of the blame on himself. It was his fault anyway. "-I can't handle the complications of a relationship right now. Not with Howard here for the foreseeable future, and not until I can give you what you need."
Tony was so enamored with Steve's excitement, he didn't notice (until they were there for almost an hour.), the signs for an exhibit. He had looked away from Steve quickly to not get caught staring at him as the soldier was talking about some artist he admired.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Well, good morning to you," Steve murmured, his arms tightening around Tony.
It took everything for Tony to shut his trap and not respond. He was starting to learn that he didn't need to have an answer for everything.
"We all will." She said, choosing a line. "We'll take turns. It'll be good for us to learn how to make something other than Top Ramen."
"Natasha!" Thor's voice came over the line, "How are you fairing, dear friend? Are you still angry?"
She moved to the next one, Steve Rogers: another lead. Tall and handsome with the body of an Adonis. Not a single negative thing in his file save for his robust activism concerning homeless veterans. Former soldier in the Gulf War, discharged honorably after two years. Went into music for some reason. "Steve," he shook her hand with a bright smile, all teeth, and sweetness. He had the golden voice, melodic and full, like honey on ice cream. Also unattached romantically, though he had a fling with a model named Peggy two years prior. No children.
He knew that this Howard
Steve put his hand gently on Tony's thigh, letting his fingertips graze the inside right above the inseam. "Do you want to keep going?"
be supportive as well - though less likely - which is what Tony hoped for. It was inevitable that they would be found out. He was a scientist, after all, and the variables were against them. Howard was sharing quarters with the two, and something or someone was bound to slip. But, Howard was contrite over what he would turn into and that guilt might aid in softening his stance against a healthy - but still gay - relationship. If Tony were to be honest, he was more afraid of Howard finding out his own son was gay and not that Captain America was.
Steve watched in horror as the man lifted it, aiming for Tony's head. He could see Tony looking up, abject terror on his face when he realized exactly what type of danger he had put himself in by leaving the armor. Above, the quinjet tilted and tried to take aim. "We don't have a clear shot yet, Steve!" The body of the dragon, enormous and bulky, blocked the quinjet from the other side.
you died. I want to know
Howard still woke him up at night. Gasping and crying, hunched over, trying to make himself smaller. Harder to hit. It made him shake with fear and acutely aware of the silver scar that lined the top of his shoulder and fell to his shoulder blade. A permanent reminder of one particularly bad night.
His hand slides beneath his pillow almost before he's completely set down, pulling out the worn, once blue blankie from where it lay hidden. He's not ashamed that Steve sees.
He tries so hard not to, but Tony's eyes flicker away from the window and up to view Steve. He looks so lost. The dull blue and grey of Manhattan's light flickers against his skin, interspersed with shadows from the window panes. He looks like a ghost, something unreal and haunting. Tony's chest seizes.
Walking from the closet and tossing the sweater on the bed, Rhodey leveled him with a bright grin. "Was it brown and grimy?"
He didn't get sick, not this time. Didn't have to run to the bathroom for one reason or another, but he did wake up clutching his stomach and head. The stabbing glass was back, and so was the migraine. He let Steve hold him--the only one allowed to when this happened--and rub soothing circles over the spot on his abdomen that hurt, the distended, bloated belly feeling almost foreign to Steve.
Howard visibly swallowed. "How?"
what it looked like.
Tony steals a hoodie, there's dinner and TV and a bottle of vino, Natasha has no boundaries, and Tony has an OH SHIT moment.
to make things happen. Oh, he couldn't
Again, Tony bit back a retort.
"Hey!" Tony stiffened and sat up, pulling from Steve's grasp harshly. "You're talking like I'm not here again!" Standing, he shrugged off Steve's attempt to tug him back down and moved away from them, his eyes hard and angry.
"Hey, wait." Steve stopped but didn't turn around at Tony's voice. He waited, shoulders tense, for him to continue. "Listen, Steve. I'm sorry. You shouldn't have had to see that. Or hear that." There was no need to clarify; they both knew what Tony was referring to.
"Thanks, JARVIS." Setting the boxes on the counter, Natasha opened the cabinet above her head to pull out plates. "Can you tell them all we bring nourishment in the form of processed pork?"
"I dressed for you tonight," Tony chuckled. "Didn't consider the fact that it's, you know. Winter."
"Honeybear!" Tony's face lit up, and Rhodey had to force a smile. It was glaringly obvious that what Bruce had said was true. Tony was grasping at any light he could find. Not that Rhodey wouldn't put a smile on his face any other day, but there was something forced about this one. It was earnest, but also hopeful in a way that had his heart sinking. "What brings you here? You just missed breakfast - Bruce made pancakes and they were just perfection, as usual, of course. But especially delicious today. There's some leftovers in the fridge, I could heat them up for you. Do you want coffee? I'll make you coffee. Or would you rather tea?" He had been loading the dishwasher but paused to speak, a sticky looking plate flailing around as he gestured. "I don't know, you switch back and forth between the two depending on how much shit you got to do, and tea is great, don't get me wrong, but coffee is like the nectar of the gods. Do you want tea? You look like you want tea today. Bruce turned me onto Darjeeling, it's incredible, but I like it with half and half, I know you usually take yours with no cream-"
And he plunged three fingers in.
"I can see that," Tony gestured to the eye chart, chuckling. "How long have you planned this?" He slipped his glasses down his nose, squinting at the chart.
"Okay," Clint said slowly, serious face on for serious business. He
Okay? What was okay? What could possibly be okay about any of this?
"You and I, Howard Stark, are going to have a conversation." Lifting Mjolnir, he pointed it at Tony's father, dipping his head forward and raising his eyebrows in a way that clearly said,
"Four years isn't enough?"
he could at least help out his son. Help him move past what happened to him. Give Tony
If only parents knew the impact their words had on their children, how a phrase or a fist could shape them long after they were in a hole in the ground.
"Do you see? Endings can be beautiful. We are proud of you, Anthony. You can let go now, be at peace."
Bruce laughed contritely at that. "No, no, the other guy is just relieved. Me too. It-- it's just a lot."
looking a little green around the gills."
Not like he cared. Because he didn't.
"I did," Steve responds, rubbing his hands along the side of a building to knock the snow that had gathered there loose, "I paid for the funeral."
She didn't even have to look to know what he was referring to. "Yes."
"Is that..  Is it you?" The man's head whipped around, his eyes still bright after almost thirty years living on the streets. But Steve knew them like he knew his own. "Oh my God." He dropped to his knees next to him, reaching out but afraid to touch. Petrified that he wasn't real.
"But I never said anything about public fucking." Tony added.
"Talking with you. With Clint. Banging my head against the fact that I was completely on his side until one slip up." Heaving another sigh, she fell back against the couch cushions, all at once exhausted. "What would you do?"
Tony heaved another sigh and rubbed a hand down his face. "I was abused. You were right." Steve froze, unwilling to upset the moment by moving, breathing too loudly, or -- frankly -- doing anything. This was a big admission for Tony. "He abused me. I
Tony is pretty damn annoyed as well. If the weather was different and Howard had found that out, who could even guess how different Tony's childhood
"How are you so good at that?" Tony lamented, eyes still closed as he lined himself up.
Tony is a puddle by the time he's finished. The combination of the heat and the gentle ministrations have left him boneless and happy, a sweet smile playing on his lips. Steve hopes it's enough to lull him into a sound sleep. Gingerly, he dresses Tony in a fresh tank top and a pair of thick, cozy sweats and lifts him into his arms again.
"Can I preface this," Howard started slowly, "by saying that I realized I'm not angry that Tony is dating Steve? It just took me for a loop?"
Laughing, Tony answered, "Good news. If you can call it that."
"Huh? Oh, well you fell in love with a sexy idiot genius."
Doctor Avery didn't even notice. He was too busy with his nose in Tony's chart.
"Yes, but again, a lot has to change. As long as we're careful, it should be fine."
There were a few things that Bruce knew for certain. One, he was angry - which never boded well for him. Two, he cared for Tony and the rest of the team more than he ever thought he would allow himself to. And three, he was sick and tired of being passive about the entire situation. Tony was his best friend, even if Tony also had Rhodey and Pepper, and Bruce knew with a deep understanding
"Hey! Watch the goods!" But it was nice to hear Tony laughing, who knew how much levity he would get over the next couple of days.
Tony sighed dramatically, a small smile playing at the corners of his mouth. "What did I just say? This is about what you want."
But a deal was a deal.
Or so he thought.
Looking proud, Steve slid the tray of pork chops onto the stovetop. He turned and grabbed Tony's face with the oven mitts still on, "Exactly!" And nipped his nose before letting go and swinging back around to the stove.
"I saw the encore on the news. He
The realization hit him hard, and now that he knew, he felt so incredibly stupid for not figuring it out sooner. It was never Natasha. It was
have a dad bod."
"What did you call me?" Howard snapped angrily. Clint ignored the response.
He teased them, but he was happy. Happy for Tony, content to watch the two act like absolute idiots around each other. Perfectly fine to be on the outside, to have someone else for Tony to use as his own personal pillow, to make him laugh and smile.
"First of all-" Rhodey smacked his arm with the menu, "-you only know my 'O' face because you don't know how to knock. Secondly, that was one time, whereas I'm sure you've got Steve's etched into your memory."
"Isn't that always the case?"
What could Bruce do other than groan and drop his head into his hands? Clint really needed to learn not to bait angry people. Particularly the variety of angry people who knew that they had just endangered the life of his significant other.
"-Wish I got fingered on the beach."
"Nice double entendre. On-wards, faithful steed!" Tony called out, earning a snort from Happy as he pulled into the traffic.
Sometimes, he honestly felt like he wasn't the same. That he wasn't Tony Stark. He was an illness. And that was it. Gone was the inventor, the genius. Gone was the Iron Man suit, the playboy persona, the jokes, the wit. Like his whole person and history was completely rewritten from scratch, starting the first time he threw up.
His hands flew up to the back of the lounger, clinging to it as he growled his moans, his voice in the beginnings of going hoarse, the intensity overwhelming. Between them, Tony's dick was bouncing, sending smears of precome tapping along his lower stomach. Steve's chest heaved with the exertion, the burn in his lungs brilliant and satisfying.
"I got some Intel on the weather patterns when the plane went down—"
"I'm glad to see all's right with the weird world of the Avengers." She turned to Fury. "I have
"Shut up, I'm hungry." The waiter returned with their drinks, and they thanked him, Clint transferring his straw and plucking the celery out to take a bite. "Do we just tell them? I mean, how long can this go on?"
"Nope." Clint set down the mug and brandished a spoon from his pocket. "But we sure did know how to dial a phone number."
The abrupt change in topic almost set Tony off his guard.
There was a pause before the AI answered, mostly likely conferring with Tony as to whether or not to inform them of his creator's whereabouts. JARVIS was used by all the Avengers, from their cellphones to their own work, but he was loyal (as loyal as a computer could be) to Tony.
Finally gaining purchase on the curtains, Tony swings his arm forward, sending the divider sailing between them. It hurts, pain shooting up his hand and into his forearm, but he needs to get away from Steve, and since he's stuck on the bed, his best option is not seeing him. He'll take what he can get.
Hours later, after six episodes and a bottle of white, Tony was slumped against Steve, his legs up on the couch, yelling at the television in slurred ramblings. "Oh, come on! It's so obvious! Look at him! He totally did it! Steve, look at this shit! He's so guilty you can fucking smell it."
Being in the future was really starting to lose its curb appeal. No shiny electronics or technology could erase the fact that he was not only regretting this but completely done with it.
"Well, thank god." He was across the room in five strides, pulling Tony into a tight hug before doing the same to Steve, standing on his toes to reach. Realizing what he was doing, both Steve and Howard snapped back, clearing their throats awkwardly. "Sorry! I'm just… I'm happy for you. For both of you." He gestured between them. "I approve of-of this. I mean!" His face went red. "Not that you need my approval but-"
(See the end of the chapter for
"I don't care about any of that at this moment. I just-" One of the tears gathering in Tony's eyes slipped down his cheek, and Steve brushed it away. "I just want you. Right now. I need you."
It was a nice thought, but Tony knew Howard. He was an ogre. A monster. He screamed and yelled and hit. He drank, and he rampaged. He was a shadow cast upon Tony's entire life, and nothing he did could move his feet enough to step out from the shade. His roots were deep and stubborn, and he couldn't bloom in the darkness.
coming from that, and I really should finish what I started. I mean, come on, Steve. I'm sure your mother said the same thing! Finish what you start! So I have to-"
I'll be back tomorrow."
emotions carried easier. There was room for a few of the negative ones. They tacked on at the bottom. So the second Howard isn't a Stepford Wife, but he'll be happier in general because the positive emotions all came with him." Fury fell silent, letting the implications run through each of their minds.
Tony was introduced and brought on stage at 3pm exactly. Off to the side, standing together, were his teammates and friends; they gave him encouraging smiles as he adjusted his tie and fiddled with the microphone clipped to the lapel of his suit jacket.
He was pretty sure she could tell he was uncomfortable, but she made no move to call him out on it. "Come on, Joey, let's head home. Daddy is waiting for us!"
He had been Tony's optometrist for going on three years, had lusted after him for just as long, and although Tony was a genius, he really could be as thick as his glasses. Steve had dropped plenty of hints. It wasn't like he didn't think Tony was interested. On the contrary, Steve's perfect vision saw every appreciative look Tony sent towards him. Every leer, every wistful smile…
Steve was losing him. This was a train of thought he didn't want Tony following. "Don't think on it, babe," he said softly, picking up the bottle again and lubing himself quickly. With an extra squirt from the bottle, he pressed one finger into Tony, slicking him and taking his mind from past memories of his drunk father to the present, where Steve was slowly sliding into him.
Pulling out, he stood, finally kicking off his pants and pulling his shirt over his head without unbuttoning it. Tony's feet thumped to the ground, his hands flying to touch Steve's chest as soon as it was exposed. "This is what you were hiding under there?" His fingers curled inward as he tested how hard the muscles were underneath. He ran his hands up and over Steve's pectorals, the pads skidding over his nipples. Steve sucked in a breath, a short moan puffing from his throat. "You like that?"
"Bruce, Bruce, no distractions, mon cheri. I am in the pinnacle of genius. The creativity juices are flowing abundantly-"
Willingly, Tony pushed away everything he had been feeling and concentrated on the moment.
"Tony-"
"Wheat? But that's in everything!" Steve groaned.
"We'll set up here, so you don't have to move much." It's so gentle, the way Steve lays him on the sofa. Bruce hurries over, lightly lifting Tony's broken ankle and placing it on a pillow.
"Jesus, Tony…"
the one he had known back when Steve was with the Howling Commandos.
Clint stepped away from the brunette after their selfie was completed and moved next to the blonde, "Tones and I are out to get lunch."
Steve was smiling, he adored Cara. She was an amazing writer and her exuberant personality not only reminded him of someone else he knew, but it also brought out his own. It was honestly too bad she could never know who he really was, but even still, having someone to fangirl over Tony with was fun. He didn't like lying to them, but the fake profile on Facebook was necessary to keep his cover. Roger John Stark. A bit obvious, maybe, but the use of Tony's last name was common among the fans of his, as it was for the Steve fans to take on Rogers.
"And what's that?"
Bruce laughed outright, "We all play to our strengths."
"And get them back on top."
"You're not helping."
"Ahhh!" She jokingly mocked. "
On the small slab of counter space next to the refrigerator, the old toaster sat with a stickered sign on it.
"Nightingale Locksley."
Steve's head ducked down to meet Tony's, his hands sliding up to cup his face, and they were kissing. Even when the laptop slid off Tony's lap and clattered to the ground as he moved to face Steve more fully, they didn't stop. When the cheers erupted from the dark inside the tower, they kept on. It was dizzying. It was perfect.
Leaning forward, his elbows bracing on the table, Tony swiped through his phone, tapping the internet open and refreshing StonyFan1918's page, which he had never cleared from his browser.
She smiles knowingly as if it's something she hears often enough that it's no longer a nuisance to her. "You are. Congratulations on your acceptance to Heaven and not, you know—" she lowers her voice, "—the other place."
He motioned his hand to their surroundings.
Bruce sank back into his seat. "More?"
Time stretched, like those hazy moments in between waking and sleeping where nothing had meaning except the cozy, protected feeling that hovered around your body. Steve let his fingers trail up and down Tony's side, his nose pressed into Tony's hair. Almost sure that Tony was dozing peacefully, Steve was a little surprised when he started talking, sounding alert even though he spoke so quietly Steve had to strain to hear him.
"So what?" Steve snapped, "He's a jackass!" This was insane. No way could Tony's best friend be recommending this. Steve felt himself starting to boil. "He
"All right, I'm done with this gushy shit," Fury announced, his tone peeved, and Tony pointedly ignored him to twist in Steve's arms and kiss him deeply. "I'm headed backto work on making Howard a legal citizen. Hill?" She nodded and moved to flank him, though she was smiling indulgently at Tony and Steve.
"Vodka tonic for your thoughts?"
"So are you going to read it?"
Tony's face crumpled into one of disgust. "Don't ever call it a belly again!"
"Eat that brownie, or it’s mine, Stark."
"Me too." Steve's head shifted to capture Tony's lips. "Save the talking for when we're worn out."
Tony was reaching into his pocket for his wallet when the voice registered to Steve. It was familiar. It sent a bolt of hope flooding through his chest.
Wiping his eyes, Steve tries to speak. He tries to say the words, just three simple words.
Bruce said nothing to that. He moved next to Steve and keyed in his code for the Avengers floor.
"Your loss." Tony grumbled, swiping his phone open again. He paused, contemplating, before tossing his phone to the other side of the couch and shucking his clothes. It was always better when he was naked.
"I don't know what-"
"I know. I hate that I added to it."
"We had a date. She was going to teach me how to dance. But then I went into the ice, and by the time I came out, she was an old lady with Alzheimer's, and that was it. No chance." His hand is warm against Tony's cheek, and Tony longs to hate him, to feel indifferent to his heat. To not want to kiss him.
She snorted at that. "And Steve hasn't yet realized that we're all commenting on his stories and feeding his muse."
"What else could there be?" Howard regretted the words as soon as they left his mouth, but there was nothing to say to make it better; he couldn't unsay them. Stepping fully into the kitchen, he attempted to close the distance between them, but Tony's tensing form stopped him.
"What? What Tony, what are you?" Her eyes had narrowed, ready to correct him.
She called over her shoulder, not even a little bit shocked at what she was seeing. "Found him! He's in the back office!" Turning back to them, she briefly studied Tony's lean form, and met Steve's eyes. "We need to know what you're planning about the Wind-Guard situation."
"What is?!"
No one could replace Bucky. And for that, a hole lived inside of Steve that couldn't be patched up. It sat there, big and empty, taking up space.
"He told you?"
Because when Tony was upset, he felt like his emotions were out of his hands, and it was imperative he regain some semblance of agency in any way he could. Controlling the tone of the dialogue helped.
"You say that like it's a bad thing."
Tony's jaw dropped. "Don't have a- Platypus, what third world bullshit have you dragged me into?"
A crowd gathered as they landed. Cars slowing along Hempstead Turnpike, blatantly rubber-necking, people ambling out of shops to catch a sight of Iron Man and War Machine as the suits opened, and the patrons in the coffee house abandoning their drinks to run down the front steps for a chance to get close to both of them.
a little envious.
"Hey," Bruce lightly hit his arm, "you are! Don't ever think that!"
"Semantics," Tony mumbled, flopping backwards on the bed and spreading his legs. He trailed a hand up his thigh and let a finger dip inside. "What do you want more? To discuss your sex life with Howard or to live it with me?"
Steve was on his back on the floor in an instant, a knife pressed against his throat. "If you know what's good for you,
Rhodey was quiet for a few minutes, working something out through his jaw. Steve waited him out.
He held his two pointer fingers up to punctuate his point. "I punched him."
Bruce leaned forward, steepling his fingers, "Anything is possible, but that doesn't mean it's going to be easy."
Dropping his weight on her hands, he laughed as she grunted and shoved him forward. He stumbled, still chuckling, and moved to the kitchen. "What do you want? Soup? Stew? Chicken?"
