“Shuri, it’s Scott,” Hope said with a hint of glee in her eyes. “As adorable as he is this way, I do like him as an adult.”
He remembered finishing the last one, he still had his fiction writing assignment, and apparently a date with Steve... or he could have hallucinated that he wasn’t sure. The not sleeping thing was getting out of hand and he knew it, but he wanted to finish everything before finals week, so that he could spend more time with Steve. There was also the fact that he had been working on his AI the whole time as well, because while DUM-E was great, he had just been the one step forward that Tony needed to create JARVIS.
“Ahh yes, Alpha male stupidity,” Tony said with a smile. “Thanks.”
“Fine,” he said his voice low, he wasn’t sure what he should do, he wanted to run over to Tony, to talk to him and fix everything, but then he remembered what had happened when Bucky and him had broken up and he didn’t know if the same tactic would actually work.
“You better be right,” he said frustrated with the other man. “I’m not going to lose my family twice,” he rushed off towards the next battle, watching as everyone fought for their lives
“Not really, I’m more amazed that you haven’t run screaming from me at this point,” Tony said, and Steve’s heart hurt to hear him say anything like that about himself.
“Hey there, you two, how’s everything going,” she asked them, which meant that she knew what they were up to. Steve looked at Tony as if he had given out their secret.
“Yes, and I want to spend time with them as well, you don’t know what tomorrow may bring.”
“You already know who it is,” she smiled at him. “It’s Happy.”
“Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. I'll do my best,” Clint said as he kissed a picture of his kids and put it into the suit.
That was enough to startle the other man into letting go, “What?” he said before Steve took the chance and knocked him out with the shield. He knew that it was going to hurt when his other self woke up, but Steve was already tired of fighting.
Tony could feel hope bloom in his chest at hearing this, “But I heard that Sharon and Steve had a thing going on since last semester or something,” she finished and with it killing all the hope he had for anything, this is why he didn’t want to get attached to anyone, he didn’t want that hope to linger. He had tried in high school, dated around, got together with two different girls, one used him and the other had been an exchange student who had moved back to Japan after the semester had been over. Both had broken his heart, and he couldn’t deal with that, he was supposed to be the future of Stark Industries’ Research and Development, not falling in love and getting his heart broken.
“Wait until I rub this in Scott’s face,” Tony said with a smile. “Not the getting caught by Peggy part, but the fact that we got the stone and the pym particles, so he can suck it.”
“So, do I but we need you here,” Steve told him as he sat down and took his hand, before taking a deep breath. “I need you here, because if you’re not I don’t know what I would do with myself, there’s so much happening all at once, and I don’t know what would happen if we were all lost out there.”
“I sometimes feel I should put it in a locked box and drop it at the bottom of a lake... go to bed,” he said wishing that he could do it without the ramifications of what it would do to the people he loved and cared about the most.
It wasn’t difficult to get into the underground bunker that held the SHIELD headquarters, for one Steve remembered the facility, and Tony knew how to get through their rudimentary systems like they were nothing but Morgan’s marshmallow sandwiches, which she only had when they had tea parties. Mainly because she thought tea was bitter and tastes weird, and marshmallows were the best thing to remedy it.
“No,” Steve said before Clint could say anything. “We’re not getting into that.”
Steve watches as Tony’s sent flying, his heart can’t take watching Tony die, he’s not sure if he could survive losing Tony after everything. Using his shield, he charges at Thanos but is immediately pushed back, he tries again but the Titan all but throws him across the field.
If there was one thing he wouldn’t give up, even if he decided to do the time heist, it was his kids, yes, their families would be back, but they would be his no matter what. They owned his heart. Tony made his way down to the living room, a smile on his face as he saw Steve sitting on one of the chairs reading.
“Hello, Ms... umm,” Steve started but he didn’t know who Pepper was and Tony hadn’t given him her name.
Shuri had taken Vision and the cradle back with her to Wakanda five years ago, the girl had become obsessed with reviving the android, even years later when Tony knew she had settled into her role as Queen she hadn’t stopped searching for answers. He knew that she should really have been out there being a kid, having fun with her friends, but he also knew how it felt to lose all of your family at once. For him it had happened twice in his life. So, whenever she called, he always made sure to talk to her, he also sent Kamala and Riri out to Wakanda so that Shuri would have friends closer to her age, and as smart as they all were, it sometimes backfired on him when they would invent something weird. The last time it had been a prank bomb, that had turned him and Steve blue, it had even seeped in through their clothes, so they looked like the Blue Man Group from head to toe.
Steve hugged Miles smiling as he watched the kid count the cups on the table, “It should be fine, the coffee at home is always stronger than it should be, but that’s cause your dad likes it that way.”
Just as she walked towards them, Rhodey was about to launch himself towards the woman as fast as his mechanical legs could take him, but Tony was wary of new visitors, stopping his best friend from moving forward. They didn’t know if this was the same woman that Rhodey had known all those years ago, she could be someone that Thanos had sent. Tony just stood there, holding Rhodey back, Nebula on his other side, she looked over at the new arrival with caution
“You have an entire team of super heroes up there to take care of Steve, I already told Natasha that they have to take care of him,” Pepper said to him still glaring, he was going to have to buy her something expensive and he knew it. “Tony, you’re responsible for the company, you may have put me in charge, but you still have to work, and you’ve neglected that work for too long.”
“We’re working on it,” there was a hint of something in Steve’s voice, which only worried him. “Nat and Viz went to get Clint, the kids aren’t happy about him leaving, Bruce is driving them to Pepper and Happy’s right now, or at least he was going to I’m not sure if he left yet.”
“I’m going to have to mull it over,” Sharon says intently. “Run it by a few people, the usual. I can’t promise you anything.”
There’s an endless amount of ways this could end. Different scenarios that could play out. Tony wonders when he’d suddenly adopted such a negative attitude, because all the scenarios that do play out in his head don’t have favorable endings at all.
*****
Unreservedly. Speechless.
“This is not in the script,” Steve says breathlessly as Tony’s hot lips trail over the soft skin on his neck.
“You should ride with me,” Tony’s grin finally returns, refusing to feel any sort of remorse for the antagonist. “Showing up on foot will totally kill whatever rep you might get by being seen around with me.”
But it’s different with Steve.
“God,” Steve sighs, “I’m real sorry ‘bout that back there. I didn-”
“No,” Steve shakes his head as if that will help clear it, “I won’t do it.”
His twisted logic somehow leads him to this alien emotion. This thing called guilt.
Even though Steve does know it will be another day before his father will wake up, he still feels bad for wanting to leave the hospital as much as he does right then.
“A save button,” Tony says, smiling when Steve actually laughs. “No wait, hang on, there’s more. Then, they went on to invent memory cards.”
“When is this gonna end?” Pepper drops down dramatically at the kitchen table, laying her head to rest in her arms. Hogan muses at how her sprawled out blond locks just barely miss the saucy plate of spaghetti bolognaise remains.
Brock grins, only because he’s felt the same way after a single encounter with the man.
It’s quite the opposite, Steve notices as he passes her. His teary eyes must be deceiving him. But, no.
“Goodbye, Tony,” Hill states, a tiny smile gracing her features as she noticed Tony’s blatant desperation to stay.”
“Of course you’ve been busy,” wants to kick himself for assuming anything less, “you’re Tony Stark.”
Even more so that it belongs to Steve.
Is he alright?
Steve stands quickly; dodging Tony’s wet shorts as they fly passed him. He laughs, eyeing Tony from across the partially motionless azure mat.
“Tony?” Steve mutters, not fully believing it is really Tony’s eyes he’s looking into. Steve immediately sits up, moving quickly as if the illusion will disappear if he takes a second too long. “Tony, I’m so sorry. I’m sorry. I didn’t… I’m sorry.”
“I support my country,” Steve gropes his crotch with one hand and salutes with the other, not feeling the least bit self-conscious. “And my country supports me.”
“Who’s next?” Rhodey asks no one in particular as he tiredly flips to the next portfolio. “Steve Rogers.”
Hogan locks his car before walking over to Pepper where she stands beside her Beamer. She’s way too fresh and smug for such an early hour that Hogan wonders if her stupid attempts to get him to join her for yoga are actually a good idea.
“Well, Tony, we do,” Howard interjects sternly before Hogan could speak.
“My father,” Tony frowns, getting to his feet. “Well then you know what? You can keep your script. No Steve, no Tony Stark.”
He doesn’t stay long enough to be told to leave twice. Instead, Steve makes his unceremonious escape to the elevator ignoring all the knowing looks from his former colleagues who are wise enough not to sympathize over fear of suffering a similar fate. He’s just about to make a somewhat respectable clean getaway when a familiar hand prevents the elevator doors from shutting and he’s joined by his best friend in the cab.
“Absolutely,” Steve sighs. “I really should head home.”
“It shouldn’t take too long,” she assures, accepting Tony’s nod before heading out.
“Doesn’t this give you Déjà Vu?” Tony grins at the man as people rushpassed them, up and down, all acting professional.
He will attempt to make sense of everything later. Maybe later when he isn’t worshiping every single slight effort Steve is making.
He doesn’t know it’s because she hadn’t seen him properly before when the room was still dark. He doesn’t know it’s because she’s thoroughly taken aback by his remarkable beauty. If only he could know that she would do literally anything to sign him under her name right then and there. But he doesn’t.
“None taken,” Tony shrugs, shooting one more triumphant grin at Hill and Rhodey. Lee seems to be pampering the hell out of Tony, and Tony is not the only one who notices.
“Oh hello, Steve,” Lee says cheerily, entering the office before Steve can speak. “I see you’ve met your co-star.
“You don’t know a thing about me, Tony,” Steve shoots back, the offence clear in his eyes and in the way his voice hitches ever so slightly.
Nothing’s changed. The main reason Bucky left in the first place is still there. The main thing, the only thing that Steve and Bucky were constantly fighting about.
Hogan simply nods, taking in the polished look that Tony is sporting. Hogan picked the suit out for him. Everyone seems more shocked that Tony actually wore it.
People are still exiting the venue, but the few curious glances in their direction don’t go unnoticed by Steve.
How will he react, what will he do? How will he handle waking up in Steve’s bed?
The audience voices their disappointment with the revelation.
“Never heard of him,” Brock scoffs, fully prepared to hang up the phone.
The warmth radiating off of his chest and onto her back was almost distracting. Just not as effective as she would have liked it to be.
It never really matters what is said by who on television, but photographs don’t lie. Steve had hoped that the time he’d seen them in Lee’s office would be the last.
As Tony saunters over to the mini bar, Steve busies himself by shrugging out of his hoodie, tossing his cap aside and taking in the room more thoroughly.
Steve tries hard not to look over his boss’s shoulder, because Bucky is chopping Stark’s head with an imaginary axe in the next cubicle.
“Oh God,” Tony moans breathlessly when Steve moves lower, his sweaty palms finally snaking into Steve’s partially damp hair.
“No amount of money can buy that kind of talent,” Tony says, unable to look away too long from the skillful movements of the guitarist’s fingers.
There’re still ample knowing stares and some random approaches from the braver fans who can’t resist asking for an autograph or the chance to take a photo with or of the star. If it’s been exhausting for Steven just watching it happen, he wonders if Tony’s harboring real hatred towards it under his trademark smile as he briefly poses for yet more clicks and flashes. He wonders if Tony thinks all the intrusion is actually worth all the fame.
“It’s pretty urgent.” Stan Lee says.
Steve hears himself growl when Tony crawls back on his elbows the moment he has crawled forward enough for their chests to touch and their cocks to meet. He continues to crawl up the bed with his boss, never leaving the warm space between the Tony’s legs. He watches a stray bead of sweat slither down Tony’s temple as Tony reaches into the nightstand, eyes reflecting the same type of hunger Steve feels heavy in his balls. And Tony finds what he’s looking for without even sparing the transparent bottle or condoms a glance, too fixed on boring holes into every inch of Steve’s naked front. So intensely so that Steve even feels his shoulders blush seconds before Tony bites down on his trapezius muscle and wraps skilled fingers around his cock.
“You’re young too,” Tony smiles.
“I proposed to him.”
With his arms up just enough for Steve to make out every muscled curve of his triceps, the subtle way in which he rolls his hips draws attention to the definite outline of his hard cock, a site only made more delicious when Steve looks up to find Tony’s face a mask of pornographic meditation.  Almost as if in Tony’s head, with his eyes squeezed shut, he and Steve are already fucking like two cellmates after lights out.
It’s the only file there and he feels his stomach twist when he lifts it, the name on the dotted line jumping out at him:
Tony smiles at that, noticing how Steve looked more pretty than handsome back then. He actually looks more like his mother than his father. Every single family photo that lines the walls in his own parents’ house was shot in a studio and later digitally enhanced to perfection.
Tony smiles triumphantly as they exit the theatre.
“This whole Tony ordeal,” she confesses without a second thought.
“Well, as it’s been decades since anyone has asked to see my ID-” Steve is uncharacteristically snarky. Because he’s jobless and he’s been dumped by the man he thought he loved and now he’s about to be stood up by his best friend as well. “- I’d like one damn good reason why you won’t ge-”
“I’ve been busy, mom,” Tony shrugs.
The decision hadn’t been hard to make.
Tony’s face lights up as he replaces the game in place and drops down onto Steve’s hotel bed.
He’s been moved from one hotel to another, one that Lee thinks is right for him. It’s like an upgrade from coach to a seat beside the pilot. Large and fully furnished. The hotel staff is tripping over themselves; overdoing everything they can to make Steve not have to lift a finger.
“Of course, Mr. Stark,” she nods.
He knows he can’t get free even if he wanted to and surrendering to Steve just seems so exhilarating.
The day had started so differently. It started so well.
“No,” Tony cut in, “let me finish. It hurt because I was wondering why you didn’t tell me. I could have helped you; you knew I would’ve done anything to help you. Anything.”
His way of thinking.
He can’t do it. Steve just can’t do it. Not with the way Tony is looking at him. Eyes full of emotion and hope. Lips slightly quirked up into a tiny smile that is nowhere near any smile he’s ever seen on Tony’s face.
bullshit.”
“Let’s carry on,” she Hill sighs as she reenters the room and takes her seat once again. Rhodey looks relieved that she’s alone. Lee, slightly annoyed.
“Tony,” Hogan begins, a little calmer, “your father-”
So, this idea had been put on hold for a long time. It actually came to mind when I was a looot younger working part-time at a DVD store. The perks of such a job was the simple fact that if you landed the double shift (closing at night and opening in the morning) you were allowed to take as many movies/games/sitcoms as you wanted home with you (the downside to that was that I was usually half dead at work the next morning having spent all night playing PlayStation games and watching full seasons of everything. Anywho, one PAINFULLY SLOW night, literally minutes before closing, I went gay-movie-hunting (not porn – we didn’t have any of those). In my hands, I had the placement cards for All Over the Guy, Brokeback Mountain, Shelter and I was reading the summary of Mysterious Skin when in walks the owner (not the manager) to conduct his two minute random inspection just to make sure all is running smoothly (he had three branches in town) and his employees were happy (incredibly sweet man who also happened to be ‘Anderson-Cooper-sexy’). The entire time I was briefing him on the day’s progress, I was saying please don’t ask what I’m holding over and over again in my head. Then he finally slapped his hands together and said, ‘So, what will you be enjoying this evening?” And his smile sort of turned to confusion as he scanned through my selection. And my face went hot. And he sort of just said ‘oh’, before giving me the cards back, slapping my shoulder, and with the widest grin ever, he said, “enjoy.” I wasn’t entirely out then, but I wasn’t completely closeted either so my panic attack lasted only a minute. But I started thinking how hilarious it would have been if the store DID offer gay porn (any porn really) and I’d been found the same way. Then I laughed more thinking, what if that happens to someone who works at a major corporation and they look up only to find the CEO standing right beside them, doing the same thing. Then Stony came into my life and I thought, how perfect would it be if it happened to these two sexy bastards. And then in one sitting what I’d planned on making a really short story became 19 pages and now its late and I’m tired and I’m praying you guys enjoyed this as much as I enjoyed writing it. Goodnight Stony lovers, Over and out.
“When Thanos snapped his fingers, Earth became ground zero for a power surge of ridiculously cosmic proportions,” Rocket said looking around the room while playing with the holograms in front of him. “No one’s ever seen anything like it... until two days ago, on this planet.”
Why couldn’t he stop talking, he couldn’t understand this, but he kept going, “I didn’t have grandparents either, so it was nice, and then she tells me stories about what it was like growing up, and we started the book club, it’s not really a club when there’s two of us but she wanted me to have something that wasn’t tied to me being well who I am.”
“What was Coulson thinking when he was designing that I have no idea,” Tony said smiling, “It’s ridiculous.”
“Absolutely nothing,” Thor said, and Tony knew full well that Thor was ready to get his revenge on the Titan.
“We can find out more at the end of the semester when we get home,” Tony said not wanting to think about the whole thing, he had enough problems as it was.
They ate in silence after that, it wasn’t until later, when Thor had come back that they saw just how much he cared for their opinion. “You’re the only family I have left,” Thor had said sadness in his eyes, “I am afraid of losing you all as well, Asgardians live very long lives, and after everything that had happened, I realized just how much it would hurt me to lose you all as well.”
An hour later, they were all laying around the room, no one moving as they all thought about the other three stones that they needed to locate, they knew that they would have to go back to the day the Avengers first formed, but they also had to figure out the time stone as well. Both Tony and Natasha were lying on the table, papers scattered all around them, Bruce on the floor Thor soundly sleeping on his lap, Steve was off making dinner for when the kids arrived, Shuri was with Scott and Hope adjusting the suits, while Rhodey and Carol went off on a walk. Nebula had disappeared, and Tony was certain that Rocket was making a bomb outside.
“Don’t blame me,” Bucky answered before kissing Natasha on her cheek. “The moment she heard that you,” he pointed at Tony before pointing at Steve, “had met his parents, it was all over, she wanted to meet mine and then we just made our way over here afterwards.”
“This is why I told you to calm down,” she said before taking the last vial off the suit before he could make another mistake. “We’re all under pressure right now, and you tend to freak out a little when there’s too much happening at once.”
By the time Tony was on the ambulance he was ready to freak out, he wasn’t too overly fond of hospitals, having spent most of his childhood trying to fix a heart problem that had developed from being born premature. This was something that had continued well into his teenage years and had only been solved by his need to make everything better and more efficient. Hence the fact that he was allowed a limited amount of work at S.I. and not the full workload that he should have had. His mother worried, his father worked, and Tony just created things to help the company overall. The advanced pacemaker in his chest had saved him, the doctors had repaired most of the problems with his heart over the years. He hadn’t had to stay overnight in a hospital since before he went to M.I.T., but now the prospect of going to the ER was enough to send his brain into a panic.
“You know I was certain that with everything going on that the two of you would get you heads out of your asses and not fight for once,” someone said as they stood over Steve. Looking up he saw Rhodes standing over him. “But I think you two have so much that you need to get through that it would take a while before anything went back to normal.”
“And have my mother kill you on your first meeting, yeah no,” Natasha said, and Tony knew that she was right, but he also knew that Natasha wanted this meeting to go well, it was rare for them to bring anyone home, Jan was an exception because they had grown up together. Boyfriends were something completely different, especially when the meeting would take place during the annual Christmas Gala, in front of everyone they knew and then some.
“She would kill you too,” Tony said, and honestly it was the best date he could have ever hoped for.
By the end of his shift he had the perfect date planned, there was an old diner in his hometown that had the best burgers, it was an all-night diner with those red booths that you only see on TV shows. If what Jan had told him was right, then Tony would probably love it, Steve wasn’t 100% sure, but he wanted to try. He also asked his brother to check if his tent was around, he wanted to spend the night with Tony under the stars, even though it would be freezing, but a nice fire would help, and he knew the best place to go.
“0-4, 0-4... Uhh, 0-7,” Tony said and Steve wasn’t so sure of what he should be thinking.
“Not exactly,” he answered just as the doors to the elevator closed, leaving Tony in a place he never thought he would step into.
“Seriously, you didn’t?” Scott told him, dumbfounded by the whole thing. “I mean... they look like bad guys.”
“Change of plans,” Steve told him. The only thing he kept thinking about was that this was for his family, for Tony, for Nat, Shuri, Hope, and Clint, who all had lost their families.
“Let’s go,” Steve said pulling Tony up, never letting go of his hand. It felt like it should have been there all along, and he never wanted to let go.
Every once and a while Steve could swear that Thor’s powers were manifesting nearby as the crackle of lighting hit the skies above. They were all hurting from this, but Thor was trying to think differently about what had happened, swearing that there would be a way to get her back. Steve knew it had to do with Bruce’s reaction to Nat’s death, they had all been close, but those two had learned to live in a world all their own and losing their friend was a hard thing to have happen. They had all been doing so well until this happened and Steve hated it, he hated that whenever they got somewhere, or found some form of happiness the universe saw fit to throw a wrench in their path.
“But it’s not verified, we all thought that it was fake,” he still did, he was hallucinating this whole encounter.
“Anything small would do,” Tony said while Bruce nodded.
“Not if I stop. I can put a pin in it right now, and stop,” he said knowing he wouldn’t be able to.
“Was he the reason you were acting like that,” Tony said pointing Ty out, who started walking further down the hall, and out of sight.
“Sure,” Tony answered though he wasn’t sure if it would happen before he got settled, especially with everything going on during the first week of classes. “It won’t be this week, because I want to get settled in and well not get lost, but I’ll stop by when I have the chance.”
“I’m not going to be, not as long as you’re there Tony, and it’s not going to be our first date.... wait when is the gala?”
Steve honestly couldn’t believe it, he has a date with Tony Stark, the very real owner of that Instagram post that Steve was sure had been a joke or something.
Taking a deep breath, he opened the book and saw picture after picture of the Iron Man armor, the way he had described it in his stories, or a variation of the drafts that had been up on his wall in his room. Some of them with the faceplate turned up, and what could be Tony in ten years, with a goatee and a smile. He kept turning the pages, just to see how Steve saw him and how he saw Iron Man. Then he got towards the final pages, and saw himself, his glasses sliding down his face his own arms up in the air, probably talking about something Steve didn’t understand, but that was how Steve saw him, as a passionate person.
“A ship has entered the upper atmosphere, I’ve sent a distress call to our allies' boss, but it seems as though it came through the Quantum machine in the compound,” she said and he wondered maybe if his reservations about Nebula earlier weren’t unfounded. He saw Steve nearby half buried in rubble, he was breathing, which was a relief for Tony. One found everyone else to go.
“You know,” Steve said to him as they got ready for bed that night. “I never thought that I would be a father, I thought I had given that up a long time ago, especially when I started coming to terms with being 70 years in the future, but we’re not too bad at this.”
“Hey,” Steve said as he stopped in front of Tony. “I just finished my shift at Starbucks and remembered that you’d be here so I thought you’d like to try this,” Steve gave him the full cup of coffee and Tony felt like he’d been blindsided for a moment before taking the cup from him.
“I love my mom, she’s great, yeah she had to raise five kids while my dad worked all of the time, she always made sure that we had her attention, my older brothers were around a lot when I was growing up, dinners and family things, but they always made time for me and Nat, and that’s because of our mom,” Tony said a fond smile on his face as if he were remembering. “She always talked about how she had a huge family growing up, she’s Italian, and she missed that, she was an only child, with a lot of aunts and uncles, a million cousins, but when her parents moved to the states, they came over without all of that.”
“He does, we set up the basement as his studio, but we had to clean up a lot, so the camping stuff is in the mud room for now, why do you ask, because Steven Grant Rogers, you know it’s too cold to go camping right now.”
“Fury, like the character from your dad’s comics?”
Slowly grabbing the vibrator, he gave Steve’s rim one last kiss before he pulled out his fingers and replaced them with the toy. It was beautiful to see his colors in Steve’s ass, Tony felt like he should salute himself at that point, but instead he worked his way up, kissing mini Cap as he did, and watching it jerk wildly. The ring was keeping Steve from coming, and unless super soldier strength extended to breaking his dick out of confinement, it was going to stay there for a good amount of time.
“I got my second chance right here, Nat. I can't roll the dice again. If you don't talk shop, you can stay for lunch.”
Sam and Bucky had started nagging him on it, “You’re supposed to be sellin’ them not readin’ them,” Bucky called out from the café, his Brooklyn accent coming out as he said it. Natasha smirking next to him as she shelved a few books.
“I never knew that I would end up having a home for lost wayward kids, but they’re ours now and forever,” Tony smiled feeling like he was finally moving forward.
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve couldn’t help but smile, he had never seen Bucky try so hard to impress a girl, usually anyone he was interested in would fall all over themselves to get his attention. It was weird to think of Bucky having to work on getting someone’s attention.
Tony had been sure that he was the first to have offered her anything like that, a lot of people were struggling but some more than others. Kids, teenagers mostly, were suffering from losing their families, some were too old to be put into foster care so they stayed in their family homes and tried to make ends meet, often failing. Tony watched her as she ate through four burgers, only stopping to talk about superheroes, or how hard school was, or even how she had lost her family. She became more animated as she went and it reminded him of Peter in a way, he wondered how she would be with Riri, or even Shuri who need more friends her age.
“It’ll be done by the end of the summer, I promise, and maybe the girls would like having Lila, Cooper and Nate around, more kids for them to hang around with.”
They watched as Bruce walked over to Thor and kiss the man, giving him an uneasy smile before turning into the Hulk. There was a tension in the room, it had more to do with the glove than with the Hulk standing there.
“Okay,” was all he said before leaning back and thinking of how he was going to get Tony to understand that what he had seen had been a huge misunderstanding.
“No problem, I’ll see you around, maybe I could get you to read some of your stories to me,” he said before waving at Tony and walking away. It was nice, at least he thought it was, that him and Steve could actually start being friends.
“Hey, hey. Look at me. You okay?” she asked him as Clint held up a baseball glove.
“That would be alright Young Miss,” he said giving Tony a small smile and a wink. Tony knew that smile, it was his pity smile, because it meant that Tony would be completely alone, and Tony wouldn’t want to take away the small amount of quiet time that Jarvis would have with his wife, not the way his family normally worked the couple.
“Tell me a story,” she said before letting out a big yawn.
“Not from what I read, and I’ve read through both of your stories, there’s too many similarities in your story Mr. Stone, almost as if Mr. Stark did most of the work and you claimed it as your own, I understand that the dialogue is yours, I’ve read enough of your work from earlier in the semester to know how you write dialogue, but a lot if not all of the exposition was not written by you.”
Thor grunted and used both the hammer and the axe to bring down his lighting on Tony’s suit, using the suit’s back panels he absored the blast and sent it right at Thanos. The blast was huge, but he wasn’t sure if it was big enough to take Thanos down. Just as he thinks it’s working, he sees Mjölnir fly by, the distraction had been enough for Tony’s fire power to faulter, enough for Thanos to grab him and use him as a shield against the hammer and it hit him and sent him flying.
“Think about it, Tony,” Lee ignores Hogan altogether, stepping around the cluttered table in the 12th floor office to stand right in front of the boy. “If you take on this role, it will be a changing point in your career. You will begin to be viewed as more than just a pretty face, because let’s face it, you are.”
One encouraging glare from Ms. Wanda is all it takes for Steve to follow Tony.
“This,” Harold had beamed, wrinkles etching the corners of his eyes, “is my boy.”
“Just skirts,” Tony quips.
The loud rap on the door snaps her back to reality.
He’s been dozing on and off all day waiting for just such a moment and it’s finally –practically- handed to him.
Steve pretends to act shocked by it like the script demands, he even pushes on Tony’s shoulders. But before he can give in and allow it happen, Tony chuckles again.
It’s obvious that Hogan’s not going to reply this time.
Steve isn’t one much for surprises.
And then with a shaky hand, Steve reaches into his pocket and holds the little velvet box up in front of the man he wants to spend the rest of his life with.
“Yeah,” he replies, “he called me this morning. It feels really weird getting a phone call from Marvel, my dad still can’t believe it when he hears it. Mr. Lee says he’s got someone he wants me to meet.”
“Guilty.”
“Well, let me make it easy for you,” Steve interrupts. “You were right about me, Tony. After we first met, you were right. I
Pepper shimmies her way out of the bed, completely unaware of the glare Hogan was shooting at her back.
Tony has turned down countless interviews for ages, he’s dismissed hundreds of request. Which is probably why everyone is astonished that he personally phoned Natasha Romanov, asking for an appearance.
“Tony, you may be looking for that quick fix of attention that comes with fame, but here’s a newsflash for you – I’m not.”
And then everything falls silent and Tony stopped moving altogether when the punchline to Steve’s joke doesn’t follow.
When Tony enters his temporary dressing room, he’s fully prepared to just shove his clothes back on and head home. Maybe pop in to see friends, because judging from the last few messages he’s been receiving, he hasn’t done that in ages.
Pepper doesn’t matter anymore either, since she’d decided to up and leave as well.
Tony turns around, putting on an incredulous face as he meets Steve’s eyes from a distance.
“Is it because you don’t want your golf buddies knowing you have a gay son?” Tony mumbles.
“You have back-up?” Sharon answers his question with a question.
“What bullshit?”
“Do you think you’ve got enough energy for one more visitor?” Steve asked hopefully.
“I swear to God, Pepper,” Tony frowns, “he was gonna beat the shit outta me. I could see it coming.”
And for a fleeting second, he misses Hogan.
“Tony,” Hill warns over her shoulder.
Instinct guides him as he gets to his knees, scanning through the partitions until he got to
That’s what Harold had said. But what Tony had heard was: ‘This man is your bitch, make sure you give him ten times more work than everyone else and call him in on public holidays to do frivolous tasks that should’ve really been assigned to Sarah from Accounting. Also, don’t acknowledge his achievements and penalize him for his co-workers mistakes.”
Of all his years in the industry, he’s won countless awards. Oscars and Emmy’s. He’s made speech after speech. He’s talked celebrities into stepping out of their comfort zones over and over again,
“Maybe it would help if I gave you his shoe size?” Steve chuckles, then immediately feels like a middle-aged dad trying to be hip around his children’s friends when the other man remains completely unaffected and statue still.  He decides to cloak his embarrassment by busying them both. “Can you get me a Long Island Ice Tea.”
So Tony makes a promise to himself to be more vigilant.
“Tony, we’re leaving.”
Tony closes the file and clutches it underneath his arm before making his way to the door.
something wrong with me. I’m different, you know that?”
It’s not that Tony would have taken Steve’s appearance into consideration were it not for the fact that Steve Rogers is going to be acting with him. They’re going to be continuously compared with one another, based on everything they do by everyone who sees them together. Tony knows this from experience.
“Hogan spoils everything,” Tony gives a lazy laugh when the duvet is shoved into his arms.
“You know, we probably should rehearse some time,” Tony actually succeeds in sounding calm. “I mean, it’s what I usually do with my co-stars. Helps with continuity.”
“I can’t promise anything,” Tony finally speaks again with a sigh. “It’s not gonna be easy, but I’m gonna try for this one.”
Brock nods in agreement. He knows she’s right; they will probably be worth triple if they are even slightly provocative.
Tony Stark - the star – who is doing absolutely phenomenally. Scores of reporters are screaming for him and he’s doing his best to make time for all of them. He’s already signed scores of autographs and at least six out of ten witty remarks he’s made that night will certainly make the morning paper.
It’s  been a two hour drive getting there, another half hour finding Sharon Carter’s studio in a town he hardly knows. He’s had ample time to think about exactly what he was going to say to her. What he really wanted out of this unscheduled meeting.
“I’m sorry,” Stark straightens his collar, “do I have to speak slower, Rogers?”
Tony tears his eyes away from the photographs, searching his father’s eyes for a second. He tries to make sense of what the man is telling him, but he just can’t believe it. Believe that everything with Steve was all a lie. A setup.
and the two of them are from two completely different worlds.
“Do you wanna know what always puts me at ease,” Tony says before downing his drink with reprehensible professionalism and carelessly tossing the glass aside. He does the same with Steve’s tumbler and the blond man only has a second to be re-marveled by the softness of the carpet before he’s introduced the softness of the bed. He lands on his elbows, knees hooked over the edge and thighs slightly spread.
“Tony,” Steve tries again, and this time instead of encouraging Tony’s actions by massaging his scalp and rolling his hips, he gently pushes at Tony’s chest.
“Well put, Tony,” Peggy nods thoughtfully. “So have you thought of what you want to do?”
She doesn’t regret stealing the attention away from Hogan for that second, even though the look Howard gives her is enough to open the gates of hell and drag her down.
As Steve lets out a shaky breath, completely triumphant yet feeling extremely defeated, he does everything he can to clear his head of the past few minutes. Days. Weeks.
Tony chuckles, sitting further back in his seat as Lee moves closer.
Steve turns to Tony, pleading with his eyes for privacy. Tony also picks up on the unspoken apology before nodding.
“It’s my career, not his.”
The soft knock on the dressing room door completely spoils any plans that Tony was probably going to bail on last minute anyway.
Hogan’s not about to give in that easily. Especially not with a fiery Howard on his tail.
. The celebrity, the idol. And in all honesty, he is still only Steve Rogers.
“Well what did you mean, Tony?” and then Steve lets out an exasperated sigh. “Do you know what, I don’t even care. I think it’s best we both just keep this professi-”
“Hogan quit,” Tony shrugs, “I guess I became a little too much for him to handle.”
But there’s something in Mr. Stark’s tone that makes Steve know that Howard really does have it right, leaving nothing to preserve. How he knows, Steve has no idea, but he can literally feel himself tremble.
“Steve,” Tony sighs, “I’m a little bit confused at the moment. I thou-”
“He left with his father just yesterday,” she informs. “Got shipped by the ambulance and everything. I wouldn’t expect any less, I’ll tell you that much. Not with what the hospital bill looks like.”
“I’m sorry,” Tony wipes a none-existent tear away. “It’s gonna take some getting used to.”
“Bye, Dad.” It sounds final regardless of the his father sounding determined to continue the conversation.
“Didn’t you hear me,” she says, “I said we’re closed.”
“I’m invited?”
Steve moans into the desperate kiss that follows, hands shaky as he takes the proffered tube of lubricant and allows himself to be pushed back until he’s up on his knees.
The audience laughs and rants to spur Tony on.
Clint showed up a few minutes later, popping open the ice bag and shaking it before handing it to Tony, “Clint can you wait here with him so I can check in with Thor,” Steve said even though he didn’t want to leave Tony’s side.
“Yeah,” Tony rubbed the big guy’s arms. “But we don’t need that right now.”
“What about Natasha?”
“Do you know that you’re in public, and near kids, what did you think that you could get away with this,” she yelled at the man before grabbing to pull him off the chair, most likely to get him to the back office so that she could call the cops, but some of the parents were already dialing. If there was one thing that came to mind to Tony in the minutes after it happened it was that he shouldn’t have gotten too close, but he knew that someone needed to get between Natasha and the perv, and since none of the other employees were close enough, Tony had stepped up.
“I don’t need saving,” Tony grumbled before adjusting himself on the couch just as Rhodey stood up picked up Tony’s legs and sat down next to him putting his legs on Rhodey’s lap.
“Fucking hell,” Steve cried out as he chased the pleasure building up, Tony could feel it in the thrusts, but there was only so much release they were both going to find.
“On my way down to coordinate search and rescue!” Loki said before transforming back into his original form. “I mean, honestly! How do you think you’ll be...”
“Pardon me. Do I know you?”
“Where should I start?” he said as he sat up and looked at the stone. “The Aether, first, is not a stone, someone called it a stone before. It's more of a... and angry sludge thing, so... someones gonna need to amend that. It’s also known as the reality stone, it has the ability to manipulate reality as it stands. Anyway, here's an interesting story though, many years ago...My grandfather had to hide the stones from the Dark Elves...” he started wiggling his fingers as if he were a ghost. “Wooooh, scary beings. So, Jane, Oh, there she is. That's Jane... She's... an old flame of mine...” he said as a picture of his exgirlfriend appeared on screen. “She... she stuck her hand inside a rock this one time... and then the Aether stuck itself inside her... And, she became very, very sick. So, I had to take her to Asgard, which is where I'm from. And we had to try and fix her. We were dating at the time, you see. I got to introduce her to my Mother... who's dead...”
(See the end of the chapter for
If he were honestly speaking, it could just be the fact that they hadn’t had a single moment to themselves in a long while, so the rising sexual tension was also in play, and neither would probably last too long, but he did want to have fun with it all.
“Mom and dad don’t hate you,” Harley said, all the while Peter was nodding as he pulled out a giant bag of marshmallows and some how hot dogs on a stick.
“What did you talk about?” he asked to move the conversation along and to give her a chance to speak a little more.
“Continue with what you were saying Tony, before I lose my patience and break out of these restraints and spank you on that nice round bubble butt of yours.”
He hadn’t noticed the man sitting at the café with a cup of coffee in front of him taking a picture, but when the shot had started trending an hour later, and Peter had come rushing over, Steve wondered how he had missed the whole thing happening.
The lights for his workshop were on as he wheeled himself passed it, which was strange considering all their work was in Bruce’s lab which was a little further down, but he saw Shuri sitting inside throwing a ball for DUM-E and U to go and get. He didn’t want to disturb her, as she worked on distracting herself from what was happening around them, but he couldn’t leave he alone in there with her thoughts, because he knew better than anyone that sometimes your mind was your own worst enemy.
“Bingo,” Clint added, both of them on the same wavelength.
“Steve, you have to take it, it’s a part of you,” he said knowing that it hurt to look at some days, for both of them. “I cleaned it up for you, painted it and everything. Plus, if we’re talking honestly, we have to get it out of the workshop before Morgan takes it sledding.”
“Don’t worry Steve,” Bucky said but even Steve knew that it wasn’t what he wanted to hear at that moment.
When Tony’s eyes became droopy, and he had fallen asleep, Steve breathed a little easier, it was hard to function when the person you liked was talking like that. After the conversation with Ms. Potts, Steve had kept an eye on Tony, she had said that they were going to need to keep this out of the press until the official story was out. Steve still worried, not only about Tony, but also about the store, especially since he had left so quickly and now with everything that was happening.
“Look at a mod inspiration, let me see what check out. So, recommend one last sim before we pack it in for the night. This time, in the shape of a mobius strip, inverted, please,” he said.
“Then don’t call me a raccoon.”
“Can someone tell me what’s going on?” he asked rubbing his cheek, just as Natasha lunged towards him again, before she could do anything Bucky grabbed her and placed her near the counter.
“You were serious about that, we’re actually going camping,” Tony said a horrified expression on his face. “Steve, it’s cold out right now... it’s literally freezing outside.”
“You know it’s a trap, right?” Thor said and Tony was sure of it too, but they needed to try.
“Steve, I can’t see the key hole,” Tony said, and Steve couldn’t help but laugh, a sleepy Tony was one of his favorite things. “Not... funny.”
“So, how do we do this,” Tony said next to him, keeping Steve from making a horrible mistake and actually saying what was on his mind. Living with four kids made him honest, maybe too honest.
“Pepper will kill me,” Tony said looking around the room. “Too many people know already.”
“I thought that Tony was the chef,” she says as she wipes the tears from her face. “Why are you here Steve? Don’t you have a family to take care of?”
“Yeah well, she’s five, what's your excuse?” Riri said as she walked in Kamala, Pepper and Happy right behind.
Once he was at the door, wondering why they had a door to the kitchen, but it was one of those swinging doors, and of course there he was distracting himself with something so dumb as to think about the mechanics of a door like this in a house that should have a more open concept design. He took a deep breath and pushed the door, only to be faced with Steve’s back and some blonde girl with her hands on his face, her head slightly tilted, kissing Steve and breaking Tony’s heart. He had waited too long, and he knew this, this was the consequences of him being too involved in his project. He lost Steve, he heard Bucky’s curse just as Tony walked away, grabbing a nearby liquor bottle and walking out of the house not hearing Bucky calling out for him. He didn’t care, all he knew was that he took a chance and got burned, just like all of his other relationships. The only thing he had left were his robots, and he was going to make sure that the one he was working on would be the best one he could make.
The machine was done right as Clint arrived wearing the suit, his hair pushed back, but they could all see the worried look on the guy’s face. They weren’t sure if any of this was going to work, and Clint getting stuck in the past, or wherever the machine left him was going to be horrible on so many levels. Everyone had come to the room to see if it would work, Shuri leaving her lab, Thor sitting in a corner with Nebula and Valkyrie, Carol standing next to Rhodey, while Tony stood next to Steve. Bruce at the machine adjusting everything they had worked on, while watching the people in the room.
The war effort during this time was nothing like what Steve had known, and Tony didn’t want him to be subjected to the hatred that most Army Vets got from going overseas. They were just serving their country, but they had also ended up with a lot of the blame that should have rested on the shoulders of the people in charge.
“Agreed,” Nebula said as if that was the only thing she needed to say, Steve looked over at her, never really sure if she would say something more, and sometimes afraid to ask her to elaborate, especially since she’s threatened him with bodily harm on more than one occasion, especially when it comes to Tony. He also wasn’t sure if her agreeing was confirming Tony’s theory about her relationship with the others, but again, disembowelment is not on his agenda for the day.
“Captain, I thought you were coordinating search and rescue?” Sitwell asked and it took everything in him to not hit the man.
“Gods that hurts,” he said before watching Giant-Man kicking him away before rushing towards more of Thanos’s army.
“Call Nat and tell her what’s happening,” he said feeling defeated, he felt Bucky squeeze his shoulder before he was on the phone.
“I think we should go somewhere together for Spring Break,” Rhodey said to the group as they sat around the coffee table trading food cartons and fighting over the dumplings.
“Like I would still be War Machine in a different universe,” Rhodey said looking at her, Tony was fascinated by this just as much as anyone else. “Or Tony could have been a woman.”
“Um... well,” Tony knew that this was a loaded question, because he wanted to ask about Steve, but instead moved on to something else. “Why a freshman roommate?”
Morgan was giggling into his hand, “What are you doing up, little miss?”
“Shellhead?”
“I’m being very careful,” Bruce said inspecting a red tube on the suit.
“It sorta seems like you can,” he said and Tony knew that this was the moment where he would really have to make a decision.
“Thank you, Tony, I wouldn’t have been able to get this far without you,” Steve said with a smile on his face that was tugging on Tony’s heart. “I have a thank you gift for you.”
“Yeah, and I still have the pictures to remember it by, Clint had to go to Junior Prom like that too,” Tony said with a grin on his face. “I won that war too.”
“Let’s end this here for today,” he said to the group. “Thank you for sharing today, and I hope to see you all again next month.”
They were lucky that they had landed in the 70’s too early in the day for anyone to notice their funny outfits. There wasn’t a person around them for miles, and all Tony really wanted was to sit down for a few minutes and recover from their trip.
“You know,” Steve started but the rest of the room, at least those who knew the story, started laughing, it was the first time since he had gotten back, where he felt a feeling of hope that they would get out of this alright.
“He sees the future,” Steve said remembering the things he saw at Tony’s desk on a day when the genius was out. Mathematical equations that no one Steve knew could understand, even when tutoring Steve, Tony would talk about math in a way that made him light up like it was the one thing in the world that made sense.
“Not really, I mean your dad inspires kids every day, your mom probably does her own thing too, we’re the same, the only difference is that my last name means something to the world at large, I don’t really care about that,” he said and Steve understood what Tony was saying, they could be the same and different at the same time. “What does your mom do anyway?”
“If it’s life and death, then it’s a Steve Rogers mission,” she said to them before placing her hands on her hips. “I guess I need to help you out of here then.”
“Right,” Scott said, “And here I thought you were the smart one.”
“What do you mean by yeah, because honestly I’m freaking out over here,” Bucky said to him, his eyes wide and Tony was sure that he had just scared the guy.
“It’s because you do too much sometimes, but right now it’s more about where do we go from here,” Bruce looked over at him with a small sad smile. “We lost Tony, we really lost and in the only reason nothing we did worked was because we were all trying so hard to keep everything together that in the end, we were so broken that it couldn’t be fixed.”
And with that, Winghead Bookstore was finally reopened on a rainy late September day, and of course the weather played a role in people coming in, some for coffee others to get out of the horrible weather. Some people were happy that the store had been reopened and that it hadn’t been taken over by some chain, others loved the fact that the coffee shop was now a part of it, though Bucky said that only paying customers could stay there for more than a half an hour. Steve knew that it was his way of making more money for the store.
Since Bucky hadn’t let him sleep much, and Tony had done the homework the moment he had gotten his syllabus’s, or is it syllabi, over the summer, he was way ahead of everyone and used his class time to write his story. This class on the other hand, he hadn’t studied for ahead of time, mainly because he wanted to be surprised. He actually loved writing as much as he loved building things or coding, but his father told him that he couldn’t pursue it as a career. He was allowed to have it as a major as long as he kept up with his real coursework, because his father didn’t want to be disappointed in his son. Natasha was majoring in business, and international studies with a minor in Russian, because she had wanted to know more about the country she had come from. Their father was proud of her, Tony on the other hand, picked writing and his father broke a glass, which had barely missed Tony’s head, before smashing against the wall.
“I’ve never heard about this, why wasn’t it on the news,” Bucky said looking at him astonished, and well of course he would be, Tony didn’t really publicize himself because his family had money and people would always take advantage of that.
“Your dad’s not homophobic, is he?” he asked afraid of what would happen if Tony actually got to the point where he could actually ask Steve out on a date.
Tony could feel the air leaving him, he was fighting against Steve again and it hurt more this time because they had lost so much, he didn’t want to lose anything else, “I’m done fighting Steve,” he said because he couldn’t do it anymore. “I’ve got nothing left.”
Pepper had wheeled him off to his room after he started nodding off in the chair, neither of them spoke as he climbed into the bed, exhausted. “I’m sorry,” he said as he got comfortable. “For everything that I’ve put you through.”
“Not really, but I can tell just how tired you are, so I figured you can eat, and then get cleaned up, and we can go back to sleep.”
Steve was smiling at him, almost like Tony had given him something that he had never had before, a family for Captain America. It was something that Tony hadn’t known that he had wanted to see, maybe it was because Steve had lived all of his life with the knowledge that his father had created something for him and then put all the pressure on his own son to live up to that. He could just be projecting his own issues with his father, but that’s something he didn’t want to go too far into.
Natasha just sat back against the seat with a smile on her face, “That’s fine, I was actually going to go with Jan to Italy and meet up with her mom and do some shopping. Mom said she’d meet us there and that we’d have a girl's trip,” she said, and Tony could see the excitement on his sister’s face, though he wanted to complain about being alone, he knew that in the Stark family holidays together were rare.
"Chocolate Iron Man... interesting choice.”
Natasha was at his side texting Bucky from Tony’s phone, “James said that she’s going into the delivery room right now, so we’ll get there just as the babies are born.”
“I did use you to help me study, but again that was under the pretense of spending more time with you.”
Tony had gotten the most expensive bouquet of flowers Steve had ever seen, and there was no stopping Tony from buying them. “I want your mom to like me,” Tony said as they walked out.
“More like too crazy, how are you majoring in three different things?”
Without another word she walked off, her heels clicking on the tiled floor, Steve couldn’t help but be impressed, not because of her words, but because he had been threatened by two people Tony knew, and neither of them flinched when it came to what they’ve said to him. He knew he should never cross them, because he liked to stay intact, but also like they have said, to him Tony deserves the world. He wondered if he could get them to go after that guy that Tony had been talking about after leaving the library the other night, but instead decided to let Tony handle how he was going to deal with it. Not because Tony would be vindictive, but because Tony was good at using his words, in his world he could weave a story like no other and because of that he trusted Tony to fight his own battles. If Tony asked for back-up when the time came, Steve would be there waiting for him.
The thought of not being able to bring them back, the thought of failing, was something he didn’t want to deal with, but he also knew that he needed to help her regardless of his own fears. He needed to be strong for those who were with them, but he didn’t know just how long that strength will last. They sat there and ate the food given to them, Tony looking at all the people he picked up, all the people saved, wondering why did they survive, why did he live.
“Liar take it back, my handwriting is fine,” Steve said defending himself, and of course it was fine, Tony knew this, but for some reason teasing Steve was the most fun he’s had in the last day.
At those words Steve could feel the heat rushing to his face, this was something that he should have probably not known about. “How do you know about this?” he asked curious as to why she knew.
Morgan started giggling, and Tony was sure that it was one of the most wonderful sounds in the world for him. “That ain't the whole story.”
They hadn’t meant to drive off and not come back, really, they hadn’t, but it’s how it had happened in the end. A week after the news about the stones, Tony took off for the woods, half out of his mind with grief over what had happened. Steve found him near the other side of the lake just staring out at the water, his eyes devoid of anything, the dark circles around his eyes had been more profound in the afternoon sun. The first thing that Steve had done after getting the genius back to the compound was pack a bag for each of them, and then explain to Natasha that they were going to take a little break. She understood, mostly because she had seen Tony breakdown as something far worse than everyone else’s. Shuri and the rest of the Wakandans had gone back home, all despondent, but Shuri was determined to be a great Queen for her people. With the relays intact, the Zandarians were taken home by Rocket and Nebula, who had helped them load all kinds of things that would help in their own recovery efforts. Nebula staying on Zandar for a little longer to get to know Duranna better, Rocket stayed because of Groot even though he wasn’t the Guardian’s Groot.
“We don't. But the radiation's mostly gamma,” Bruce said looking at the gauntlet the stones resting in their places. “It's like...uh... We were made for this.”
“She really would, I think she trains with Nat when I’m not looking, but that’s only because Sharon wants to work in the FBI or something,” Tony said as they climbed up the three flights of stairs to the attic bedroom. “Jesus Rogers, why do you live all the way up here, are you trying to kill me.”
“Oh well, I’m doing three different things, mechanical engineering, programming, and writing, well the writing is more for me, the others are because I like making things and it’ll prepare me for my future because of course I’m a Stark so I would have to work at the company when I finish up school,” he said rambling, but he could see the surprised look on his roommate’s face. “What too little?”
Steve could only sigh as Tony mumbled something next to him, but he couldn’t hear him, and Steve was sure that his nose was broken. “Darcy,” he called out only to have Clint come to him instead.
“Sure, I’ll go get my car,” Thor said kissing Bruce before walking away.
“We’ll get back to Morgan learning that word from you later... wow... That's amazing, and... terrifying,” he said to Tony, and honestly it was terrifying to think about.
(See the end of the chapter for
“No, not really, but on the way back she was late, James and I were well on our way before she appeared next to us all.”
“I know, your dad is just a little over protective of his boys, hell Bruce called earlier saying something about his boyfriend, who we still haven’t met, and Hank was dating some girl but that didn’t work out so much for him. Peter is talking to some girl named Michelle, and Harley... well I don’t know if Harley likes anyone at all.”
“I’m going to be in the back for a while,” Steve told Natasha as she cleaned up the children’s books that some of the kids had left scattered around.
Steve wasn’t one who liked to be late for anything, he had been looking forward to this since Tony had told him about it. Of course, he was nervous, who wouldn’t be when meeting their boyfriend’s parents, but if Tony could get through meeting his crazy family, Steve could get through it as well. His bow had been tied by his mother as he had gotten ready, he had plenty of time to make it to the party, he was just waiting on Bucky. He should have known that life had another plan, nothing ever really went right when it mattered did it.
“Guys... I think it worked,” Scott said from across the room as he looked out at the small garden near the workshop, they all saw the birds which hadn’t been there before flying around.
There was also the fact that a flustered Tony Stark was a turn on for him for some reason, although this whole encounter could just be in his head, but he hadn’t hit his head he only hit his foot, so that whole hallucination thing was not entirely possible at the moment.
“I know, and I know you won’t, you’re so different from him, but in some ways, I see how the differences complete him in ways I couldn’t. I guess it’s just weird, to have to finally let go of all of the damage I did when I ended things.”
“Yeah sure,” Tony said before they both watched the displays light up.
“Well,” Steve said looking only at Tony. “It looks like we're improvising.”
“He didn’t walk you home or anything? Geez that’s a lousy date if you tell me,” Steve said and Tony couldn’t help but smile, at least someone was looking out for him.
“Wait, the only deal I’ve heard about recently was with Viastone, I heard mom on the phone with Thor, they were talking about the whole thing, mainly because Thor tells mom everything, and he doesn’t like the deal, they’ve been in talks for a while now, dad wants it to go through but Thor says that the whole thing doesn’t feel right.”
“Where are the stones?” Steve asked as they watched Thanos sit down and look around at the destruction he’s caused.
“Thank my mom, she got us out of there and made Thor drive us up here,” Natasha said smiling at them.
He was about to turn around when he hears the sounds of his own kids in the background, they’re hiding, and they shouldn’t be there at all, but he has really good hearing and Miles is terrible at things like hide and seek. Steve learned that from watching Miles play with Morgan, it strange that someone with powers to hide on the ceiling, is terrible at hiding from a five-year-old. Steve walked towards the closet, he knows they’re in there, and opens it watching as his kids, Lila Barton and America Chavez all spill out of the small space.
“Maybe ten minutes,” Scott answered. “Maybe less with some help.”
He made his way through the crowd, slowly weaving his way through everyone, wondering why they were having a party when the end of the semester didn’t happen for another week and a half, but they probably just needed some time off. Tony nearly bumped into the drinks table as the throng of people pushed him forward. It was weird because there wasn’t more than fifty people in the house, but in his mind, he felt like there were a million of them and he was just moving like molasses just to get to his destination.
“Okay, here we go,” Bruce said as he started inputting the data, “Time travel test number one, Hope fire up the uhhh.... the van I guess.”
This took so long to write, mainly because somethings happen.... Anyways
“Are you done?” he asked before taking the last of the Juice Pop and putting it in his own mouth. “Yeah, now you are,” he pushed her head down onto her pillow. “That face goes there,” he said smiling. He really loved his kids, even now he still went into the others rooms and kissed them goodnight.
“We all have regrets in our lives, but I believe what you do from this moment forward will change how others will see you, and maybe how you’ll see yourself. We’re your family now, whether you like us or not we’re going to make sure you don’t stray too far from us.”
“You know,” Barnes said as the medics started putting Steve on a stretcher, “He would have done it regardless, whether it had been you, or me, or Nat, or even Barton.”
“Your call.”
“Vision will be up by the end of the day,” Tony sighed before walking to the other end of the room. “I’m not sure about how I feel, but I know once he’s up everything will be different.”
“Okay,” Tony said with a smile on his face. “But you have to sit on the bed.”
“Who are these guys?” Scott asked him as they watched the scene in front of them unfold.
He had gotten to the other side of the kids' section when he saw something that was not right, and apparently, he hadn’t been the only one to have seen it because there was one of Steve’s co-workers watching from the side where she was shelving books. He knew that her name was Natasha, he had come into the store enough to know the names of all of the people who worked there. Anyone would wonder why some old man was sitting in the children’s section with a magazine, yes there was a chair there, but mostly it was for the parents to wait in as the kids looked through the books.
Tony couldn’t help but stare at the feisty girl he had watched grow up as she literally yelled at her father, she was shorter than the archer, and looked a lot like her mother.
“Who blabbed?”
“Hey Punk,” Bucky’s voice rang throughout the house, “I’m here, let’s get this show on the road.”
It made him happy, it was just what he needed, a distraction from his own thoughts about his failure in fiction writing. The words failure were ringing through his head, but with Steve there, he knew it would be alright, “I’ll help you,” he said to Steve not holding back his smile. “I’ll even give you a prize if you get all of the answers right on a practice test, because of course I’m giving you a practice exam.”
