“Sir if I may?” JARVIS interrupted his though process and he nods slightly waiting for what his A.I had to say about his love life. “I think you and Mr. Rogers would become excellent parents, based on my calculations on your compatibility you would fill most of the needs that of a child.”
“Did he…” He didn’t have to finish the question Tony already knew. “Yeah… He was abusive and you knew when it was coming.” He says and that was all he was going to say on the subject. “And if I turn into that he wins and I can never forgive myself.” Tony says in a vulnerable tone Steve had never heard before. “I didn’t want to tell you because I know you liked him…” Tony sighs and there it was again, out of respect for Steve’s feelings he didn’t say anything about his abusive childhood and yet again showed him that Tony loved him more than anything else in this world.
When he enters their floor his nose is hit with the lovely smell of food. He is starving. “JARVIS! The whole floor on lock down no-one gets in without my permission! And tint the windows!” He informs the A.I. Anything he could do to make sure Steve’s and his activities stayed between them.
“Yes sir.” Steve gets out. Tony immediately starts to circle around the butt plug in painfully slow motions. But then he pulls out the plug and let his fingers enter the gaping hole and find the little bundle of nerves without problem and started to stroke over there in slow movements. “Oh sir please?” He begs softly earning him a smack on his butt cheek.
“I won’t let them babe. Its you and me I promise.” Tony assures him. He put his arms around David’s middle and hugs him close. “You and me sweetheart.” Tony assures him.
He was standing outside the door looking like an idiot instead. That was better than not being believed or Steve thinking he deserved it. He had raised his hand several times to ring the doorbell but always lowered it, not knowing what to say or do when Steve opened the door. How would he explain the black eye he was sporting?  How would he explain his hunched walk because of the bruised ribs? How would he explain being absent for almost two months? It was not like they cared anyway. He had barley heard from his friends and family for the last months.
“I think we should take you to the hospital. You don’t looks so great.” Steve is worried and it shows in his entire body.
Tony’s heart broke. “Babe… We never really talked about it you just mentioned it like it was...” Tony tries to find words. “… something everyone goes through when its not. Something traumatic happened to you and I just want you to be happy.”
It was almost 5 am and they should get to bed Steve notes but he doesn’t want to rush Tony in case he wants to continue to share his story. But he was closing in on being awake for almost 24 hours and his body was aching for sleep. But he was also very aware of how hard it was for Tony to tell him about this and telling him that they should sleep could make Tony believe that he didn’t want to hear this and shut down. And that was the last thing he wanted.
“Let’s take our usual weekend and have Pepper watch them and when the winter break comes around we can go the whole family.” Tony knows there is no arguing with Steve now.
When he closed the front door Tony was standing in the doorway to the bedroom. He looked terrified and on the verge of crying.
“I never heard from either of you and you called yourself my friends! David was right you all never cared!” Tony was now facing Steve and his voice was raised.
“Why would I go to Steve? Why are you so obsessed with Steve!?” Tony question his voice raised as well.
“Yeah exactly! I don’t see you making any life altering decisions!” Bucky defends himself. Natasha just sighs and rolls her eyes at the two men.
“Yeah… They make life easier.” Tony agrees but still avoiding answering the question. Steve got up from the couch and he could feel Tony watching his every move as he goes to the kitchen and make them a cup of coffee each. When he comes back Tony had pushed himself further back into the couch and hunched over more trying to make himself smaller.
“I am sorry alright? I will never ever bring it up again.” Steve looks at him confused, angry, hurt. “But god forbid it happened to Adam or Jo? Wouldn’t you want them to get the help they need, the help they deserve?”
late it would take all damn day to clean up this mess. He put his coffee mug in the dishwasher and left it open hoping to get his message across.
Tony opens and closes his mouth several times trying to figure out what to say, wanting the right answer.  “He is just crude and he will grow on you Steve and maybe he is the one maybe not… I don’t know.” He decides on and Steve nods slowly. Now it was Steve’s turn to decide on what to say.
“Good.” He doesn’t say mush after that. Instead they sit there for a while before Tony gets them up and move Steve over to the bed and have him sitting on the edge of the bed so he can drink water which he downs easily he was always thirsty after a scene. And even though he always said he wasn’t hungry Tony always gave him a snickers bar which he ate without complaint. “Lay down on your stomach.” He orders softly and Steve doesn’t have to be told twice and takes a pillow and hugs it under his chin with his head to Tony so he could watch him. Tony sits down on the edge and opens a drawer they have on the bedside table and pulls out the cooling lotion Tony put there for occasions like this. It smelled like coconut, a smell Steve had started to associate with these moments when Tony was loving, affectionate and gentle towards him to make sure he was okay after their scences and even though he had argued in the beginning that he heal in matters of hours he had grown to love this part more and more. He had secretly always wished to have partners who would spend more time with him after but never did, he had mentioned that to Tony and he had promised to give him whatever he wanted and needed after and had done that from the very beginning.
“Oh god…” Tony cries out and pushes Steve’s face up to his groin and comes into the blonde’s mouth while muttering something incoherently and Steve just relaxes waiting him out. He can feel Tony’s hand on his neck and pulls out slowly and zips his pants up again while Steve was taking deep breathes before Tony took off the blindfold on Steve, blinking slowly trying to adjust to the light in the room. He looked up into Tony’s eyes and he smiles down to him causing him to smile to. “Hi there.” He petted Steve’s hair and hums at the soft touch.
“I’ll join him in the kitchen… I’ll just shower and brush my teeth first.” He says somewhat uncertainly. Where do you look when a machine is talking to you? His hand moves up to scratch his neck and when he has to push away the collar he remember it’s there. He blushes slightly before taking it off and put it on the bedside table and goes to the bathroom and take a quick showe and brushes his teeth and then he pulls on some clean sweatpants and a t-shirt that belonged to Tony and the he heads to the kitchen and he smells the food before he even rounds the corner to the hallway. He was starving.
“Yes sir.” He gets out. He looks up at Tony who never seemed to tear his eye’s a way from this sight. He groans out again closing his eyes shut trying to think about anything else but Tony’s intense stare. “Please Sir…” He begs and tries to slow down his strokes in attempt to push of his orgasm.
“I am not cheating! You just suck Bucky!” Steve promises as he chuckles and press pause on the game letting the theme music play in the background that would soon become annoying.
Tony looks up at Steve for a long moment as if he is wondering how much he can actually tell him. If Steve would be upset with him if he told the truth, Steve reminded himself that he have to be patient and supportive of Tony and let him decide the pace. “I just didn’t think I would be one of those people who…” Tears welled up again and began to fall. “Would be so
“Good. Let’s begin then.” Tony took a step back and Steve felt cold in an instant and he missed Tony’s presence. Again he heard Tony moving behind him and moved something on the bed and he assumed it was the blanket that he had used to hide the things he was planning on using on him tonight. “We are going to test your self-control and discipline today.” Tony informs him and before he knows it he feels Tony slick finger pressing into him, he groans slightly at the intrusion but welcomes it as well. “You are not allowed to come until I say so and you are on your own. No cock rings to help you today and trust me sweetheart I plan on taking my sweet time with you.” The next finger comes in making Steve squirm wanting escape the touch. “Can you do that for me sweetheart?” He pushes the fingers in and out slowly hitting Steve’s prostate every time knowing very well exactly where he was touching.
He put the kids to bed and as Joanna was reading her book to him he heard the font door open and close. He let her finish her chapter and telling her how good she was becoming at reading. It was something she was struggling with and as a way to encourage her to improve her reading she got to read a chapter from a book of her choice to one of them each night.
“Ice cream would be nice to.” Steve admits reluctantly. Tony nods and before he leaves he hands him a bottle of water he forgotten to give him earlier and a Twix bar something Steve looked at and then up to Tony and back to the Twix bar. “You always give me a snickers bar.” He says.
“We have been dating for six months and he is at my place all the time anyway so it makes sense.” Tony shrugs as he looks at his phone for the tenth time in almost 30 minutes, yes Steve was keeping track. “And he has closer to work from my place anyway.” Tony ads as he takes a sip of his beer.
Tony looks at him, like he was considering his choices. Like he was wondering if Steve was telling him the truth or if Steve would hurt him just like David did when things didn’t go his way. Of course Steve would never hurt Tony but Tony couldn’t be certain about anyone anymore. He only believed the words David had been feeding him.
David felt his jaw clench again. His fucking friends never minding their own business! He thought to himself and then he pressed delete on the text making sure that Tony would never see it. He opened the next from Steve.
. His heart beat faster. Taking a hand up and feels the new collar, it was thicker and wider than the brown one he had, more metal details, no that alloy he thinks. Because Tony’s suit it made of it. He took a wild guess that the leather was red to. He was wearing Tony’s colors, he belonged to Tony.
Steve puts on a fake smile and look at his friend whom seemed to buy it. Maybe Bucky was right, maybe he was just jealous and had actually missed his chance with Tony and now he was trying to make David into the devil that Tony needed saving from. He probably was a nice guy and he could make Tony happy. “You are probably right Buck… I am just upset that I missed my chance.” He mutters before walking to the fridge and took out two beers handing one to Bucky. “Let’s just watch the game and never talk about this again.”
“David never liked coffee… So I stopped drinking it at home.” Tony admits. “I stopped drinking it over all since he didn’t want me to.” He continues as he takes another sip of the coffee.
“Hey Tony its Steve. I heard you and David are back together and just wanted you to know that I am here if you need me for anything.”
“Let’s get to bed babe. We both have an early morning tomorrow.” David says and untangles himself from Tony. “And if you promise to stay in the bed all night I’ll make you breakfast in the morning.” David says softly sounding almost loving and caring. Tony allowed himself for a moment to believe that David actually cared about him.
“Its no bother… I finally got one of the machines you said I should get.” Tony looks at him and when their eye’s meet he quickly looks down but Steve could have sworn that there was a hint of a smile at his lips. “It’s better than the instant coffee I used to drink.” Tony had always hated that he drank instant coffee claiming it was the left over from the real coffee, he had probably a point but he usually drank it before his workouts only, until the Keurig had entered his life and he was officially a coffee addict
“It’s green sir.” A final kiss and squeeze on his side and he start to brace himself for the impact that was coming. The belt buckle opens and Tony drags it through the loops on the slacks giving an oddly comforting feeling even though he knew what was coming, but he was safe because he was with Tony.
“That’s good.” Tony replies before opening his mouth again. “You know… I have a business trip coming up soon to Japan and I was thinking maybe you can come with and we can take a few extra days and explore Tokyo.” Tony suggest hoping it would come across as a good idea and romantic, they had never gone away together and David had never been outside of USA so it would be a great idea in Tony’s mind.
“Yeah… yeah that sounds good.” He agrees reluctantly but makes no effort to move. Steve stands up slowly and waits for Tony to come with him. Steve moves away from the couch to give Tony some space and sure enough Tony is just a few steps behind him and they go to the bedroom and Steve picked out a pair of sweatpants and a t-shirt for Tony to use for the night or rather morning.
Tony stopped listening and put his hand on the back of his head and saw his entire hand red. Panic rose in his body what if it was permanent? What if he had seriously damaged his brain and he wouldn’t be able to take over Stark Industries? That would mean all his life up until this point had been a waste of time… He felt dizzy. Oh god that was not good.
“Not saying yes is a no in my book and I respect that, I respect you.” Steve explains to him. Tony bites his lower lip as if he was stopping himself from saying something. The silence is interrupted by Steve’s phone ringing. He grabs it in case it’s the hospital or someone needing a place to crash for the night but is surprised when he sees Tony’s name on the screen. “Tony I need you to be quiet because I think it’s David and I don’t want him to find you okay?” He explains as gently as he can, not wanting to seem intimidating to Tony.
“Tony you are not stupid. You did nothing wrong.” Steve assures him softly his fingers itches to touch Tony, to comfort him but he just fists his hands together and waist for Tony to speak
“Anything you see fit sir. I disobeyed direct orders.” He admits. He lets out breath he wasn’t even aware he was holding when he feels Tony’s hand in his hair, the nails scraping gently over his scalp sending shivers down his entire back. He takes a firm grip on Steve’s hair and pulls him back and up forcing Steve to look at him.
He went down to the kitchen and ate the plate of food Natasha must have left there, almost inhaling it before going to the car and start the drive to the flower shop where he would pick out flowers in different colors and shapes because he knew Tony liked that. He had asked Tony why he preferred those agreements over anything else.
Tony chuckles even though there was nothing funny about it. “You want to hear that story? It’s a long one.”
He noticed the cut and bruises scattered across his face from the fall Tony talked about. But he seemed fine other then that.
Tony grips his hair and sets the pace and fucks his mouth and Steve adjusts and sucks him enthusiastically allowing Tony to deep throat him. He can hear Tony muttering and groaning in pleasure when he hollows out his cheeks more and the tongue swirl around his head before shoving it down deep again. Steve loved to suck Tony off it always made him a blubbering mess and it was satisfying feeling knowing that he could bring the genius brain to complete mush.
” Yeah and he was still convinced that there was something going on between him and Steve that he would dump him and start dating Steve instead. Tony sighs he hated having this discussion when he knew he would never win!
“That wasn’t what I meant… I just thought it would be nice to get away...” Tony begins but is quickly interrupted by David.
“I am fine… Just next time let me decide the pace okay?” He tries to smile to hide his panic and fear.
“Yes but you knew I was going to drink! That’s why you go to a bar with your friends David!” He starts to pull at his wrist trying to get out of the grip once again but gets nowhere and just stare at David wondering what the hell had gotten into him!
“That’s because its true and I know you, teaching is your calling. You are meant to teach, so stop doubting yourself and just be you.” Tony encourage as he press a soft kiss to Steve’s mouth.
“Yes.” He breathes out and with careful motions Tony begins to put it on Steve’s neck and close it behind his neck, letting two fingers go under making sure it wasn’t too tight then he pulls at the collar and let his lips crash down onto Steve’s kissing him hungrily and passionately.
To sum it up David was a douchebag and they all hoped that it would soon disappear and not move in with Tony.
“People like David never tell the truth and he will make people feel crazy with their lying and abuse.” Because if he had abused Tony, Steve was sure that he had abused previous partners. And if he had a child he didn’t want, he would never talk about him and probably deny his existence. Life have to go according David’s plan and that made it hard for people around him to keep up and forced to walk on eggshell to not upset him.
Tony just chuckles against his thigh and press a last kiss there. “Always begging for more. Always wanting more.” Tony taunts softly and let his fingers enter Steve again he was still stretched so he could fit two fingers inside without problem. “You could have come you know, if you knew how to follow simple orders.” He pulls the fingers out and moves to get something. He can hear some sort of bottle opening; it must be lube he thought. Before he knew it he had something big pushing into his hole. “Relax sweetheart. You will like this.” Tony speaks softly and Steve does as he is told because he trusts Tony. Soon he felt an object being pushed into him fully and pressing against his prostate. “Told you!” Tony taunts when Steve is groaning in pleasure. He could feel it starting to vibrate, massaging inside his body. “Was it worth it to come earlier today? You could have come multiple times by now if you would just follow orders.” The vibrations go up and Steve bites his lower lip trying not to produce an embarrassing loud groan but it slipped through his lips anyway.
“It takes about seven times before people leave an abusive partner. Different reasons usually they have...” Steve trails of he was in doctor mode right now and Tony didn’t need a doctor he needed his friend.
“Anytime Mr. Stark.” And then she leaves to see to her next patient and Tony was forgotten. When he get’s out to the waiting room and groans heavily and not because he just got fifteen stitches in the back of his head. No because David, Happy and Steve seemed to have decided it was the perfect place to discuss Tony.
He walks down the hallway and checks on his kids to make sure they were asleep which they were and he closed the door behind him before he wandered down the stairs and into the office they had there. Steve was sitting in the office chair looking at the computer. He leans against the doorway and knock on the open door making Steve spin around.
That day never came. They never got to see the world together like they planned. There was knocking again and this time they open the door and Natasha was standing in the doorway. “You should eat something.” She states. “Then you are getting dressed and we are going to the cemetery.” It was an order he knew that. It’s quiet between the friends Steve forcing tears to stay inside wanting to be strong in front of her. But that broke the second she put her hand on his shoulder and the tears just fell and Natasha took him into her arms and let him cry on her shoulder. She rubbed his back in soothing motions in attempt to calm him down. It didn’t work but he appreciated the effort.  “It’s his birthday Steve and you always gave him flowers even though he hated it.”
He took a towel and starts rub himself dry. He discard the towel in the hamper as he walks into the bedroom and pulls out a pair of jeans, a white t-shirt and clean boxers and gets dressed quickly before he head to the kitchen to start on dinner, wanting something to occupy his mind while he waited for Tony to come home.
“I know that I am an idiot and stupid for not being able to come on home time!” Tears sprung from his eyes and he angrily wiped them away only to have new one force their way down his cheeks.
“I would like a second chance Anthony.” Howard states and Tony search his eyes for the hook. It was always a hook with him, he never did things out of the goodness of his heart mostly because he didn’t have a heart.
“You didn’t have to do that for me you know that.” This was high school all over again only worse. This time Tony had truly put his life in danger.
“I didn’t know what to do” Tony whispers. “All I knew was that you had to be safe so I just dealt with it.” Of course dealt with it meant that Tony accepted the abuse and hid it away from the world. Steve stayed on his side and waited for Tony to speak again but he remained quiet.
His phone beeped informing him that someone wanted him something, he takes and unlocks it and sees that it is his friend that wants to see him.
“If you are too rough? You just whacked my ass with a belt!” He informs his fiancé in case he missed that.
“Yeah sure. Just be home before nine.” He informs her. “You guys should head to school.” He says as he gets up from the table and start clearing it. Tony was still on the phone but seemed calmer then before as Steve pass him by he squeezes the shoulder softly before moving into the kitchen with the dirty dishes and he hears Joanna and Adam going out the door saying good bye as they do. As he puts things back into the fridge, put the dishes in the dishwasher and cleared the table Tony finished his phone call.
He had been there barley and hour when the text started dropping in, questioning him when he was coming by, asking him how much he had to drink, if he was dancing with Steve and so on. Tony sighs as he continues to answer the questions as they drop in as well as he tried to keep up with the conversation between his friends. But it was hard to focus on two different conversations where one made him constantly look down and only focus on his phone. So he had no idea what his friends was talking about.
“Suck me of again and you can come after me.” The order came. As fast as he can he moves over so he can obey. Tony pulled out his already hard erection and Steve takes it in his mouth eagerly and start to suck like his life depended on it, moving his tongue around the cock the way he knew Tony liked it and would hopefully come fast. “Good boy.” Tony praises him, closing his eye’s in pleasure and tangle his hand into the blonde hair. It didn’t take much longer until Tony spilled inside Steve again whom sucked him clean.
“No! We are here because of my dad! I didn’t even know he was supposed to be here!” David let’s go of his wrist just as Steve comes up to them, his smile big and his eye’s glimmering when he sees his friend. “Hey Steve! Long time no see.” Tony says happily and hugs his friend who hugs him to tight and to long and he knows he will feel David’s anger tonight.
He quickly got up and took the dishes and goes to the sink and washes it of as fast as he can, then he takes the wash cloth and cleans the surface where Tony had been sitting, taking the pillow under his arm while he was there. He cleans the cloth out and hangs it up before making the short journey to the living room and returns the pillow back into its place. He begins to strip and folds his clothes neatly placing them on the couch before kneeling on the floor again, head down, hands in his knees waiting for Tony to come back.
“You don’t notice it at first you know. Its small things and you just kind of think that they care and want to know that you are safe…” Steve nods, he had read about it and knows that victims are often lured into a relationship by charm, the idea that they will be cared for and loved. “He really was great in the beginning and I really thought he was the one…”
When he is 21 his life would start to turn around, he finally had his own apartment after a year of being roommates with Pepper and does some freelance work with programming and coding while working as a barista. He gets by, its not exactly the life of luxury he had been used to but it was enough and he would rather live in a cardboard box on the street before asking Howard for help. It was cold night when he first notices the blonde coming in to the coffee shop for the first time. He was cute and their eyes locked for a moment before Tony returned to wiping down the tables, missing the smile the blonde produced. This would be a recurring theme for the coming months and the blonde wouldn’t order until Tony was at the counter and after four months of this not so discrete flirting Tony wrote his number on the blonde’s cup. They had their first date the very next day.
I hope you enjoyed and as you notice I am not a slow-build writer I wish I was, I admire people who can build everything slowly but I can't so I hope you enjoy it anyway!
“Yes, what if I thought I could have something better and I will suck completely at it?” Steve wonders. These thoughts running through his head every damn day making him question everything he did and said. “I feel like I am not good enough, that somebody else deserves and needs this job more than I do.” Steve admits feeling like a failure.
“I am sorry…” Tony whimpers and tries to grip his side in an attempt to soothe himself. But he only he got another kick.
Tony just shakes his head. “Nothing really, I was making fun of you.” He explains innocently and Steve knows he is lying but decide not to push. Tony’s phone lit up again and Steve is left forgotten across the table. He sighs, he knows he can’t feel left out and ignored since Tony didn’t know how he felt about him and Tony had found somebody that seemed to make him happy so Steve should be happy for him. He should at least try he convince himself.
“I am not protecting anyone. Because David is great and he have never hurt me.” He replies never wavering from his script, because nobody could know what was going on, nobody would understand. Rachel smiles softly to him as she takes another sip from her coffee and remains quiet as if she was trying to read him and make a report on him.
His friends look at him as they try to decide how to approach the subject. How to tell Tony that they thought that David was bad for him without getting him pissed at all of them.
The hoodie he choose was the one Tony constantly stole from him and it still had the lingering smell of expensive cologne, toothpaste, detergent, metal and machine oil, scents that shouldn’t go together but mixed so well when it was on Tony’s body.
Tony didn’t believe him but he smiled and said okay because he didn’t want to argue. It was just easier to ignore certain things unless you wanted a nice bruise on your face. Or broken ribs. He handed David his whiskey glass he had requested earlier.
“I am sorry… I just get easily jealous and in my past people have cheated on me and I don’t want to be a past time until something better comes along you know…” David admits and Tony just nods waiting for him to continue or change the subject. “And it worries me how much time you spend with Steve… that you will eventually cheat on me with him. But that is just my insecurities talking and I am sorry.”
He could hear Tony move around and before he knew it the blindfold was of and Tony’s thumbs was under his eye’s wiping away the tears. “Touch yourself until I say you can come. While I watch.” The order came softly. A act he normally would find embarrassing but his hand found its way around his aching dick and started stoke himself. It was almost painful when he stroked back and forth with a firm hand. “Sit back your knees.” The next order came and Steve does as he is told, never stopping his strokes. He whimpers wishing Tony would give him permission soon to come. He moves his thumb over the head bucking up his hips slightly into his own hand. “You are close huh?”
“And I am terrified that if you walk out that door the next time I will see you, you are in a coffin.” Steve replies honestly. Tony had said it so himself that David would have killed him if he hadn’t gotten out of that situation. “You can stay here as long as you need and I will be by your side every step of the way.” Steve promises him.
“You do that babe and I will be right here when you wake up.” He promises and he can feel Tony’s dry lips against his neck in a soft kiss and it doesn’t take long before the brunette’s breathings evens out and he is asleep.
He swings the door open and the man in front of him is smaller and hunched over then he remembers. His arm is holding onto his midsection. The worn hoodie is covering his face and slowly he looks up and meet the blue eyes, the brown eyes was looked empty and no sign of life. Then he saw the purple around his left eye and seemed to continue up on his temple. His right cheek swollen and discolored as well and his lip were split open and several cuts were showered his face. His eyes went down to the midsection again and he assumed that they were either cracked or broken.
“Yeah I know that was stupid of me. But of course we can discuss it when we are both of sound mind.” Tony promises him. It’s quiet between them and the only sound there is the spoon sounding against the bowl as Steve finishes his ice cream and puts it to the side and sip his tea.
“Did you go crying to Steve? Maybe you let him fuck you? You would like that wouldn’t you?!” David raised his voice and rose from the couch and turned around to look at Tony as he finished his drink. Tony sighs knowing that David is overreacting and the alcohol didn’t help the situation.
“I have an early meeting in the morning so I have to go.” Tony excuses himself as he finishes his beer before he gets up from the couch.
” Tony doesn’t have time to respond before David hung up but that was okay. He would be able to see his friends and his boyfriend tonight. Quickly he responds to Pepper.
And Steve had tried being supportive and not complain too much to his husband about the conditions in their home. But it was getting on his last nerve to come home every day and see the house getting dirtier and dirtier by the day and he was pretty sure if something didn’t happen soon they would a) get some sort of pest in the house and b) probably get a divorce.  And he didn’t want either.
“This is nice… I like this.” Steve mutters into the pillow and groans whenever Tony hit a good spot.
“Yeah. You and me.” Tony promises again. And something must have clicked in Davids mind because he didn’t touch Tony during the coming weeks and his body was clean of bruises. So when it was time for his dad’s party he almost looked like he used to but he was a bit lighter so the suit looked a bit to big on his frame but David was happy so he was happy. Things were going to be good again.
“Tony if you would just…” They had entered their penthouse. Tony going first trying to get away from his husband. “No! Just no!” He turns around and looks at him furiously. God dammit must he be so hot wearing the simplest things? Just his black jeans, a button up blue shirt and being a few days behind on shaving, it should be illegal to look that good without trying. “We agreed on no kids!”
“No I just got of my shift. What’s going on? If it for Howard’s retirement party just tell me when and where and I’ll be there.” He says knowing it was coming up and both Howard and Maria loved him and saw him more as a second son then just their son’s friend. And he knew that no matter who Tony brought home to meet the parents could never compete with Steve and for some reason he was oddly proud of that.
“We don’t think you should rush these things Tony.” Pepper says softly. “And this feels rushed and maybe we are wrong but we just don’t want you to get hurt.” Pepper was always the one to get through to Tony without using force. “You move in together because it’s right and not because it’s convenient so just think this through before you make any permanent changes.” Pepper says and Steve had never been more grateful for Pepper being able to be the voice of reason for Tony.
All while ignoring the knot in his stomach that seemed to get bigger and bigger for each passing day.
Steve slides the green phone and put the phone to his ear. “Hey Tony! Long time no see!” Steve greets into the phone.
Tony hums and takes another bite of the food. “What do you think is a suitable punishment for this?” He questions not even looking at Steve who wanted any kind of acknowledgement from his Dominant at this point. A touch, a look, a slap… No he didn’t like slaps to the face, he told Tony that so he wouldn’t do that to him.
“You did not have to do that…” Steve begins but is interrupted by Tony’s lips on his and close his eyes and just enjoy his touch.
“He doesn’t hurt me.” Tony replies to hard, to fast. Because she can’t possibly know what is going on. She was crazy David had told him. He only had crazy exes and David had tried to make it work Tony knew that because that’s what David told him.
“Sure man! She can crash at my couch.” Rhodey chuckles as he takes a sip of his beer. “I guess we are having an early night then.” They glance at Pepper and she is still awake and she is but her eyes seem heavy and she wouldn’t be able to hold them open for much longer.
Steve swallowed wondering if he should tell the truth and tell her that he hadn’t heard from him either but he decided against it knowing she would only be more concerned. “Yeah I talked to him last week. But you know how he gets in relationships and they just moved in together. I am sure he will be back to normal soon.” He said as honestly as he could, wondering if he was right or if he wouldn’t see his best friend ever again.
“You are carrying her home!” Tony says to Rhodey as they take another shot. The liquid burned all the way down to his stomach and yet he downed another one without problem! He was so not going to work tomorrow! Rhodey laughs as the slam the glasses down onto the table and Pepper had become awfully quiet compared to earlier and he worries if she was still awake. It wouldn’t be the first time she fell asleep in a bar. Lucky for her they loved her to death and would never let anything bad happen to her.
He sighs as he comes back to reality and watch as his family was eating breakfast. Their children Adam and Joanna where looking through homework while eating their toast and bowl of fruit and Tony was talking on the phone about the upcoming product launch he had been working on for months. He looked over at Adam and Joanna again smiling at his children, still finding it unbelievable that they had been in their lives 12 years. Their plan had been to adopt Joanna who had been three at the time then one of the workers had mentioned something about not wanting to split the pair, this had led to Steve wondering what she meant and he got the story of how Adam and Joanna had been victims of a bad home with an abusive father and drug using mother. So Tony and Steve had just looked at each other and it was decided without even saying a word that they would become parents of two. To this day Adam was still protective of his little sister and would never let anyone hurt her or even come close to her if he suspected that they were bad news.
Tony turns around so they are face to face. “It’s not clingy or needy and you know that I will give you whatever you need after we had a scene even if it’s the day after. Like I said it was pretty intense and maybe your body can heal in a few hours but I think you mind needs a bit more time to process everything.” Steve just nods and leans in to kiss Tony who meets him halfway meeting in a soft and gentle kiss. “I love you.” Tony says when they break apart.
“My best friend being alive will always be worth more than my doctors license. I can always get another job.” Steve tries to calm him down. “But we don’t know if he will come here alright? So let’s not make any assumptions.”
“He is trying to take you away from me!” David replies. People start to circle around them. Steve laying helpless on the ground groaning in pain as David continued to kick him.
Steve had been putting everything on Tony and he knew that Tony had been trying his hardest to make this work; he had just been in his own world and had chosen to see only the negative even after everything Tony had done for him. In that moment he makes a decision and heads up the stairs to begin cleaning.
But it was hard trying to fall asleep when all this information was brought to light and the realization that Tony might have died tonight.
” The next part he would not have been able to hear if he was a normal person but he was far from normal. “
“Yeah he is great. He is funny, not funny as you but funny and he is a lawyer so you know he is hard working!” Tony informs him and he nods and pretends that he is happy for him, of course he is happy for him but it stung that it wasn’t him Tony was talking about. Steve takes a sip of his coffee as Tony continues to talk about David like he put the sun and moon in the sky.
“Hey sweetheart.” Tony greets him. Steve remains quiet. “You are allowed to speak sweetheart.” Tony offers. He comes up to stand beside him.
“We should go away for a week this year. St Barth’s maybe?” Tony suggests and places a kiss on Steve’s jaw.
He had planned on going in to Steve. He really had. He had stood by his door for almost an hour but he had no idea how to lie to Steve about his injuries. Steve wouldn’t believe him even if he was the greatest liar in the world, which he wasn’t. He thought about telling Steve the truth but quickly ignored that thought, Steve wouldn’t believe him and think he was an idiot for allowing it to happen.
“I want to see it for my self!” David demands and tries to move inside the but Steve doesn’t move an inch. He was not letting this man inside his own home.
Faster than he liked he was home forcing him to face his fear that his friend might be in trouble. But every time he tried to call or text Tony he never got an answer and he was wondering if it was Tony’s way of ending their friendship. No he and Tony where best friends and it would take a lot more for them to stop being friends. He was just busy being with David and taking over SI. It was nothing weird they had gone times before not talking to each other and then just calling each other up and nothing had changed between them and this was nothing different.
Steve worries about his best friend, David is deleting voicemails and texts and Tony... he is just trying to survive.
“My own place!” He snaps and pulls back his wrist basically feeling the bruise forming. Tony hadn’t noticed but somehow Rhodey had got them a cab and was soon all of them were inside the car. There was soft snores coming from Pepper (which she will deny are snores) and the was the only sound breaking the tense silence but Tony already knew what Rhodey was thinking and maybe he was right. Maybe Tony should get out while it was nothing to serious with them but he can’t let go. Yes they had only been dating for about two months but the good times were really good and David was the first guy he actually saw himself with that wasn’t Steve.
“No one is taking me away. I am with you David. I choose you! Steve is my best friend.” Tony says in much calmer tone. Walking up David and wrap his arms around his neck and pulls him in for hug and David’s arm came around Tony waist.
It was quiet again and several cars where passing them by and Steve was contemplating whether or not he should tell Tony the truth about his feelings or if he missed his chance. Maybe he could convince Tony that he was the one for him and they would work perfectly together and he would never insult him like David does and never make him question himself  but he does what he always does when it comes to Tony.
Steve thinks for a moment wondering how he should formulate himself to get his point across. “I miss teaching… I miss having a purpose.” He admits.
Things are not going great for Tony and his friends tries to show support and be there for their friend. But David have other plans for Tony.
“Tell me the truth and make it easier for yourself.” Tony encourages yet his voice is stern and Steve knows that he means that the punishment will be less. Another bite of food came into his mouth giving him a second to think.
“Okay Tony. As long as you are happy I am happy for you.” Steve replies and smiles softly to him. “But if you need me I am always here for you alright?”
Steve had said it once to him. Once, during their almost 15 year relationship. Almost in passing, but they had never talked about it truly because Steve didn’t want to and Tony respected that and never brought it up again. But it was there in the back of his mind, all the time. And now when their children are growing up they would need to sit down with them and talk about sex and it scared him how Steve might react.
“Letting go does not mean forgetting. You have so many memories, pictures and videos of the two of you together. We will never forget him. He will never be far from our thoughts. We love Tony to.” She reminds him and all he can do is nod. “So take a shower, get dressed and eat something.” She orders him again.
“I am sorry Captain Rogers.” the A.I says to the man left in the living room. “But my code is to follow Mr. Starks order above anyone else.” The A.I explains to him and Steve just nods, he knew this already. All his inventions were coded so no-one could override him. “The vents are not on my system just a thought” A.I says casually and Steve sighs. He had to go through the vents to get to his husband.
“Sorry… But I can’t… I don’t know how to… You deserve someone less broken.” Steve gets out between cries.
” Tony sighs and feels for him and knows he is right his friends were a bit hard to convince sometimes.
“Thank you sir!” He gets out trying to sound as steady as possible but in reality he knew he was shaking and a whimpering mess.
Even getting abused because that is what you do for your best friend. You protect them no matter what.
“And what is your color now?” Tony still stood dangerously close to him but he knew that he could always use his safe word and everything would stop and Tony would take him in his arms and hold him until he was okay again. That hadn’t happened yet.
The soft curve of his lips was a contrast to the sharp lines of his goatee, his nose had small bump in it from being broken when he was 17 and got into a fight with a jock that had insulted Steve. ‘
“If it not my boss it’s you who is always trying to make me look stupid!” Another kick. “Why can’t you just shut up?! All I do is love you but that is not enough for you, no you have to push my buttons and make me angry!” David shouts louder but stops kicking him at least that is something. Slowly Tony gets up from the floor and up to standing only to get a fist to his left eye. “You make me do this to you Tony and I don’t want to.” David cradle Tony’s cheek softly making Tony flinch thinking there would be a slap. “You know I don’t want to hurt you…” David says softly and rests his forehead against Tony’s.
He had chosen to be buried beside his parent’s.  Steve walks up and put the flowers on his grave. “I really miss you…” He says before the tears came running down his face. “I love you Tony.” For a moment the leaves rustled from a breeze in otherwise wind still day.
Tony stops with the flogger and trace his fingers over the stinging back and he just hums at the gentle treatment and just enjoy it before it ends. Tony must have seen how mush Steve enjoyed the touching because he seemed to stay there longer then he had planned or he wasn’t sure he had no concept of time right now and just enjoyed everything Tony was doing to him. His calloused fingers changed to a smaller paddle they had and dragged over his back down to the curve of his butt and it didn’t take long before Tony gave him a good smack on the right cheek followed quickly by one on the left side. It hurt more than the riding crop and flogger together making the skin burn.
Steve moves closer so he can kiss his fiancé before murmuring against his lips. “Only yours.” He promises.
“Not everyone can inherit a billion dollar company from their daddy like you! Some of us have to actually work to achieve their dreams!” David shouts to him. Tony instantly lowers his head knowing what’s about to come. David was furious and it was all Tony’s fault as usual. He should know better than push his buttons.
“Yeah you were right. This is fun.” David agrees and kiss him softly. “I am sorry that I’ve been hard on you lately. I just want the best for you, for us.” David explains and Tony nods before speaking.
He remembers how ashamed he had been when he first mentioned this to Tony. Like there was something seriously wrong with him. But Tony had kissed him softly and assured him that it was alright and he was willing to try it with him, even though he himself was lacking experience in this area. But he had researched and read every book and article that was out there to make sure he was doing it safely, which was so much more than any of the previous partners that Steve had. That’s why Tony was a stickler for consent. Or he had always been but now more than ever, neither was prepared for level of communication, trust and respect this would bring to their relationship but it came and they both loved it.
Tony opens the drawer on the desk slowly and Steve follows the motion with curious eyes wondering what was hiding in there. Tony picked it up and held it out to show Steve, a dark brown leather collar, simple with white stitching and a small buckle and not wider than an inch. Steve eye’s was darting between the collar and Tony’s eyes. “You said you wanted to try one.” Tony begins. “But if you don’t want it just say the word and I put it away.” Steve’s heart was beating fast. He had mentioned that briefly and didn’t think that Tony remembered. Steve nods. “You want it then?”
Except for one thing. The constant phone calls and text messages from David trying to get him back. But he ignored and blocked but he got new numbers or emailed him, a few times he had been outside his work and home. Tony had threatened to call the police on him if he didn’t remove himself from the premise.
“Grilled cheese and red wine the first thing you ever made me when we began dating.” Tony begins with a smile and let his hand intertwine with Steve’s. “Luckily your taste in wine has improved since then.” Tony chuckles as he takes a sip.
“I knew your partner.” She begins. “How about we grab a coffee and sit down and talk where there isn’t so many people?” She suggests and Tony knows he shouldn’t but something about her is so compelling and he wants to find out what she has to say to him. He nods and they leave the small store and move down the street to a smaller coffee shop and sit down in a corner away from the rest of the people. The young waiter take their order and as they wait tony decide to speak first.
“I am sorry Steve and I am here if you want to talk…” Bucky says kindly and Steve smiles to him before going to the couch and slumps to watch the game and for a moment forget about the fact that he missed his chance. Bucky sits down next to him and start the TV. “He doesn’t know what he is missing out Steve.”
But he knew that Tony wouldn’t be there. He knew he was gone and Tony would be so ashamed if he saw Steve now. But Steve just couldn’t bring himself to care. His husband was gone and Steve had a long way to go before he could join Tony. Never had he hated the super serum more.
“It’s not as important you. Nothing is as important as you.” Steve looks at Tony with these sad eyes he had never seen before.
It was quiet for a while and Tony rubs Steve’s back waiting for him to be calm enough to let go of him. “If I where to talk to someone… would you come with me?” Steve almost whisper.
“You have been good sweetheart. Two more and we are done alright? Will you touch yourself again without my permission again?” Tony asks and Steve has to take a deep breath before he answers.
’ Steve thought, abusers who would crush everyone to make sure they had all the power and control. His best friend had been abused for almost three years and almost died tonight he realizes, yet here was remembering the good parts of their relationship. He wanted to pull Tony into a hug and assure him that he would never let anyone hurt him again. But he knew if he would even try to touch Tony without his consent right now he would just run away. He had seen it often enough when he worked in the ER when women and men would lie about how they sustained an injury and flinch away at any sudden movement and attempt to touch them.
They had made a complete night of it. From Tony laying out his clothes before dinner to him taking his coat, pulling out his chair and making his order for him at the small bistro they had gone to, then they took a walk through the park home and he had let Tony talk and only answered when spoken to or asked a question and when they came home Tony had ordered him to undress down to his boxers and kneel by the small desk they had in the bedroom so Tony could go over a few blueprints and contracts before they continued their night, it was just a lie to get Steve to graze just above subspace and for Tony to touch him. But none the less Steve did as he was told because he had asked for this and wanted this.
“It’s your company… Shouldn’t you be there every day?” Steve wonders knowing Tony had practically lived there before David and he had loved every second being in the presence of other equally creative people, not as smart as him not by any means but it is very few who could match Tony’s intelligence. The man had three PhD’s for god’s sake.
“I forgive you sweetheart..” Tony didn’t reply to that he just hugs David thinking to himself that he must do better in the future to not make David upset. They stand there for a while before deciding to head to bed. When they lay in the bed David begins to slowly touch Tony’s bruised side with gentle fingers and then kissing it slowly as if he was trying to make it better. “Does this feel good?” David wonders as his fingers moves over his side and continues to press soft kisses of the skin. Tony just hums in response.
“Good boy.” Tony murmurs and let a hand wrap around his painfully hard shaft the pre-come making the head slick. He does a few lazy strokes and moves the thumb over the head slowly spreading out the pre-come. Steve thrust his hips forward trying to get more out of the touch but only back fired when then beads moves with him and moves over his prostate causing him to groan the deep groan from deep inside himself. He could feel the cuffs tugging on his wrist and where probably leaving a red mark. “You are so good for me.” Tony praises and leaves his erection causing Steve to whimper at the loss. Tony pulls at the collar to bring him closer so he could press kiss on his mouth which Steve returns as good as he can with being tied up and blinded.
“Fuck… Tony..” David groans as Tony ads more pressure to his growing member. “Suck me?” He gets out and Tony just grins and drops to his knees and begins to work to unbuckle his belt and undo his pants letting them and his boxers fall to his ankles and he was faced with an erection that sprung out. He was pretty average Tony thought and starts pumping his hand up and down in firm motions before letting his mouth close over the head and sucks and let his tongue twirl over it and finding the slit before pulling back and pumps again. He looks up and sees David with his eyes shut tight and biting his lower lip in pleasure.
“I doubt that if it came from your mind.” Steve replies kindly and Tony winces again when he begins cleaning out the other wound on his head.
“Yeah by getting into trouble yourself.” Tony ads softly and smiles to Steve with to much affection to David’s liking. “But we should get something to drink. We’ll see you later.” Tony ads quickly trying to pull David away from Steve. He could see the anger radiating from David and he did not want a scene and he didn’t want Steve to be hurt.
“I want to show you something.” Tony grins and Steve was officially worried. He only wore that grin when he was up to something. “Come here!” He pulls up the other chair he has and forces Steve to sit down. And then he started to show Steve coding and programing things he knew nothing about and just did as he was told to do and he could see from the corner of his eye that Tony enjoyed this, showing him things he was good at and Steve let him because it made him happy.
Tony had walked up to the duo and joined them placing a kiss on his husband’s mouth. “I missed you to.” He murmurs against his lips before kissing him quickly and turning his attention back to their son. “But I think it’s somebody’s bedtime!” Referring to Charlie who had been staying up later then he should waiting for Steve to come home. They chuckle as the little boy yawn and has him soon enough tucked him into bed and the couple found themselves in the kitchen having a late dinner.
So after a lot of consideration he decide to go back home. He didn’t have the right to disrupt Steve’s life. He had better things to do then solve Tony’s issues. He gets in a cab and goes home again thinking David would still be asleep and this whole thing would be forgotten.
He screamed after Tony and banged the door as if he was trying to break the door and get in that way. Steve unlocked the door and swung it open making David lose his balance and stumble forwards slightly. “Is he here!?” he shouts into Steve’s face. His breath reeking of alcohol.
“Well I know you are a busy man, so put it in your planner! You know dad loves drinking with you!” Tony explains before letting out a soft laughter. God he loved that laughter and could listen to it all day every day. His smile softens and he let his eyes wander over his face he knew by heart now and had been his focus in many of his drawings.
He could feel himself getting hard already and he knew it was a long way until Tony got home. He could probably just jerk himself of in the shower and Tony wouldn’t know the difference. But of course just like every time he thinks about something he shouldn’t do, he is almost certain that JARVIS can read his mind because he gets another text from Tony.
His mother began to worry the second she heard that they were back together again, making several phone calls trying to get him to think this through carefully and maybe be single for a while to really make sure David was the one. Distance makes the heart grow fonder right? David had heard everything and had thrown the phone through the wall, then apologizing for it claiming that his mother was trying to keep them apart. She didn’t understand their love. Tony had manged to calm him down and had promised to not talk to his mother unless he had to.
Tony don’t know how, when or who but someone called the police and ambulance and two police men had to remove David from the scene kicking and screaming. Steve was on the ground as the paramedics were evaluating his injuries. He had his dad screaming at him how he ruined this night with his idiot boyfriend, his mother crying about he deserved better, he heard David scream as they forced him into the police car and Steve groaning as they moved him to the ambulance. For a moment his eye’s lock with Steve’s and even though he should be furious with him he just looks at him with kindness and understanding before he is completely in the ambulance and on his way to the emergency room.
“I am spending time with my friends i can’t answer every text the second it get in David! I told you to spend time with your friends!” Tony defends himself and stare into the green eyes he usually could stare into with out a problem and that usually held so much more tenderness then they were now, bloodshot and pupils wide.
“I know you don’t wanna talk about it but-” Steve knew what he wanted to talk about and interrupted him quickly.
He helped Joanna with her homework and picked up Adam from his dance practice thinking Steve would be home when they got back but he wasn’t. Tony didn’t know if he should worry or not but deciding to give it a few more hours. He made a evening snack for the kids and let them talk to him about their day glancing at his watch ever so often feeling worry build in his stomach. What if something had happened to Steve?
Hey... I am alive and I have not forgotten about this story. But i have been dealing with major writers block and life in general have just been shit and had a lot on my plate so writing was not a priority and for that I am sorry and I hope you will forgive me.
“Yes I am!” It gets quiet after that and Steve and David are just staring each other down waiting for the other to back down. No Steve didn’t like this guy and hoped that he would be out of Tony’s life sooner rather than later.
Steve sighs knowing he shouldn’t have brought it up because he knows Tony. Plus Tony was under a lot of stress right now and didn’t need anything more added to his plate, he knew this yet he had been convinced by his words. “You know what? We will talk about this when your launch is over.” Steve decides.
“Because that is what I was taught when all the other kids was playing sports. And people don’t love me they love the idea of all the money they could get from me. That’s why I fell in love with you, because for the first time someone didn’t want anything from me.”
No Tony Rogers may not had the easiest of lives and piece by piece he had rebuild his life and it had not been easy but when he sees his husband and daughter he just knows that every struggle he went through was worth it. And he would without a shadow of a doubt do it again.
Steve understood that things would change when he began working again and the house wouldn’t look as pristine as it did when he was home all day, every day and sure the dinners might be a bit unhealthier then normal and they might behind on the laundry every now and then but he had not been prepared for
“She looked happy with out him. Like she had her life figured out when he wasn’t interfering with her. She looked normal while I feel crazy and question every step I take.” He says as an after thought.
It was close to midnight when there was knocking on his door. Not that he was anywhere close to getting any sleep he still wondered who the fuck was at his door at this time. It was too early for his friends needing a place to stay unless they started early and had done shots. Then at-least one of them would need a place to crash. Rubbing his eyes he got up from the couch and moved to the small hallway and looked through the peep hole and is surprised when he sees the brunette on the outside, he hadn’t seen or heard from him in almost 18 months.
“Well it brought me to you… So they served some purpose.” Tony smiles and presses his lips to Steve’s. “I would like a cup of tea.” He murmurs.
“Not even like trying…” He nibbled on the earlobe. “A spreader bar?” The breath was warm and moist against his ear before he started to suck on his pulse point again.
“So I am the favorite so what? That can’t be the reason you think we should bring kids into this equation!” Frustrated he turns around and walks towards his lab while yelling to JARVIS. “JARVIS, deny Steve access to the lab!” whilst heading to the door that lead to his lab.
Tony continues to stand with his back towards Steve thinking over his choices. He knows he have to get back to David or he will pay for it he knows it. If David finds him here with Steve, Steve will be the one paying for it and he couldn’t have that on his conscience.
He doesn’t know the answer. Whatever he does will ruin one relationship. If he goes to Steve, David will hate him and possibly kill him. If he goes to David, Steve will never forgive him for this. He made this mess, he needs to be the one who cleans it up. Even if it kills him.
Steve barley spoke to him in the coming weeks. Minimum contact and only when necessary like when Joanna asked if something was wrong because papa and daddy hadn’t talked all breakfast or that they didn’t hold hand when going out. Their house was quiet and Steve avoided Tony if he could, hell he even suggested Tony to go and work in the office.
” Steve had just gotten of a 14 hour shift after covering for a co-worker who was late and then old woman didn’t want to be alone after her husband had been wheeled in to surgery and he kept her company for two hours until her children came.
When he wakes up the next morning he is alone in the bed. He turns around and the other side of the bed is messy telling him that Tony had gone to bed with him last night. He was probably in his workshop he thinks to himself. He sits up and swings his legs over the bed.
“Its work babe… I have to go. I will be gone for seven days and I am going with some board members and their assistants and we will meet up with the headquarters in Japan and go see factories and such. Its just work nothing else...” Tony comes closer to him and put a hand on his shoulder. “And you manged well this time. We where apart for a week and it went well. Didn’t it?” Tony tires to sound optimistic and hopefully David would understand that he had to go and he was welcome to come with him.
“I just took a walk David. I wasn’t trying to leave. I will never leave you.” Tony promises him. Not because he was crazy in love with David but because he could never be the reason Steve got hurt. “I promise you David I am here to stay, you are it for me.” Tony lies.
“Yeah you mentioned that…” Steve says kindly never breaking away from David’s eyes. He would not be the first to give in. “What kind of lawyer are you?” Steve questions.
A shiver went through Steve’s body when Tony’s hand traced down his spine and back up again, gripping his hair and forcing his head up so their eye’s met. He adored the brown eyes and noted that they were darker than they had been when they began. The grip softens but their eyes don’t break contact. “You have been good sweetheart.” Tony murmurs. Steve smiles proudly. “But you did try to shift and it was the questioning at the restaurant.” Steve nods agreeing knowing why Tony was bringing up, so he would have reason to punish him. Steve’s heart beat faster by the idea of Tony using a riding crop or a flogger maybe both on his back; he could feel his erection growing by the thought of it. He had looked forward to this the whole night.
There was banging on the door that woke Steve up. Confused he manages to sit up and rub his eyes to wake himself up, the banging doesn’t stop rather the opposite it intensifies and the person on the other side starts screaming Tonys name. Rubbing his eyes he throws of the blanket and moves to the door. As he looks through the peephole he sees the person he had expected sense last night.
“Just what Steve? What is going on in that head of yours?” Squeezing Steve’s hand moves closer to him.
He was leaning against the doorframe that leads to their bedroom where his husband was laying in the enormous bed. He was so small under the big covers and pillows. His head and face was bare. His once pride and joy had been shaven of once he started with chemo not wanting to see it disappear so he shaved it of in a small attempt to remain in control of the uncontrollable situation. Their friends were sitting by his side talking about random things. Knowing their time with the genius was limited. The brown eyes locked eyes with the blue ones and Steve sends a soft smile to his husband assuring him that he was okay with waiting for his turn.
“It doesn't! It was years ago I am over it!” He get’s up from the couch and storms out of the living room. Pixie looked at Tony confused.
“I am sorry if I upset you but I don’t wanna attend you funeral because of him.” Its quiet between them and Steve hopes that Tony will stay here and never return to David again.
Carefully he places the phone beside the wallet and moves back to the bedroom waiting for Tony to come to bed and maybe he could convince Tony that they should start moving this coming weekend instead of next month. David smiles smugly to himself knowing that soon enough he would be the only person Tony would ever need because nobody could love Tony like he does.
“Oh god!” He pretends to sound concerned. “I am sure that Tony will come around and be home soon.” He assures David on the other side.
“I think we should.” Tony begins again. Steve remains quiet. “Have you talked to someone about it?” Tony asks.
“Yeah and wanted you to get cancer and die instead of mom but we can’t all get what we want can we?” Tony replies coolly. He knew it was harsh but it was how he felt and he just wanted Howard to leave him the hell alone just like he had been doing for the last 15 years. Howard remains quiet but Tony decides to speak. “I rebuild my whole life even when I thought I never would experience happiness. But then I met Steve and he is good! He is the kind of good that he helps strangers out without wanting anything in return!” Howard would never understand that sort of thing only thinking in ways to benefit himself. “He is the most amazing father to our daughter. And the most amazing husband to me.”
“Good answer sweetheart. And 10 with the cane for giving me the wrong answer first.” Steve doesn’t say anything. He had put himself in this mess. He deserved the punishment. He starts bracing himself for the cane first. It was fast Tony handed them out evenly over his whole butt and it was over before he knew it but his butt was stinging and must be marked by the cane. “Now thirty with the belt. This will hurt sweetheart.” Tony warns.
So when his dad’s retirement party was coming up he was worried. No he was terrified. He needed to attend it he knew that but he was terrified how his family would react. He had lost weight, he knew that. But David thought he could lose some more. He had bruises in varying degrees of healing, but could cover up them with clothing. The one on his jaw was a different story though but it was a few more day until the actual party so maybe it would go away.
“You would have used your safe word otherwise right?” Tony questions. Still uncertain if Steve thought that he had to push through whatever they did whether he wanted to or not.
Steve sighs. Tony was not wrong. And he also knew that Tony wouldn’t let him get away with anything but the truth.
Tony doesn’t know how but they start kissing and David’s hands wander over his body and they moved towards the bedroom, David shedding both their clothes as they entered the bedroom. Tony ends up on all fours on the bed and David preps him roughly and not nearly enough for it to even come close to feel good for Tony but David moans about how good he felt and how tight he was.
“I am gonna go for a run.” And he was out of the kitchen faster then Tony could react and he wouldn’t even try to stop him knowing Steve cleared his head when he ran.
“Before you it would have been too much but now I know that you will be there when we are done and you will give me whatever I want and need even if I don’t ask for it. I feel safe with you…” Tony frowns. He hated the previous partners who mistreated Steve in this vulnerable state. “So no it wasn’t too hard or too much because you will always bring me back and let me come back in my own time.” Tony rests his forehead onto Steve’s shoulder breathing out. “No need to be upset about the past…” Steve mutters.
“Yeah it was great. The beads where great we should use them again.” He says softly and he did enjoy them even if they felt like hell when he wasn’t allowed to come. “I like it when I am not completely sure what is coming.” He says.
“Fingers…sir.” Steve gets out and everything is still for a moment before Tony seemed to understand what Steve was talking about.
“And am I happy. I was happier before we began this conversation. Its not like I went to war!”  Steve was being defensive and just wanted to leave the room.
The first few hours were fine. David never left his side but he was playing nice with everyone and made small talk with people and was all around a loving partner. Kissing Tony when appropriate and showing him love and affection and people outside his family thought they looked so cute together and thought they were meant to be. But even his parents seemed more supportive of this. It made David mood better and the grip on Tony’s hand soften.
“Six!” Smack. Smack. “Seven, eight.” He breathed out, only seven to go he could handle that. He could make Tony proud. He hits him again over the cheeks one, two, three times. “Nine. Ten.” Oh no he lost count… “Eleven?” He asks rather more than say.
“Its not your fault.” Steve assures him. “You have done absolutely nothing wrong here.” Tony rubs his hands over his face and lets out a frustrated sound, like he was trying to wrap his head around this and make sense of it all and was failing miserably as it seemed. So Steve just sat there trying to be a supportive friend. “Maybe we should go to bed and sleep for a few hours.” Steve suggest after a moment of silence. Tony’s head shot up and he looked absolutely terrified. “No Tony not like that! You can take the bed and I’ll take the couch.” The terrified look eased up slightly not a lot but it was enough for Steve right now.
Bucky did have point and he knew that but he was also certain of his gut feeling, it was never wrong and if he could help Tony out of this in one piece he would feel so much better and not having to worry about his friend ending up in a ditch. Okay maybe he was over reacting but he rather be safe than sorry when it came to Tony. And the thing was that Steve had been on the sideline before, watching Tony start new relationships and Steve had been happy for him and then he had been jealous he knew how that felt, but Tony had always made time for his friends whether it was a night out or game night and always answered calls and text whenever he had time now Steve could send away a text in the morning and he could be happy if he had an answer by the next day!
He gave them three more weeks before Tony would come to his senses and realize what an ass David is!
“I couldn’t risk it Steve. He made a lot of promises to me and trust me he made sure I knew it wasn’t just empty threats. And it may be selfish but if he would hurt you I couldn’t live with myself knowing I was the cause.” It was a slight outburst but he instantly looks down at the floor again like he did something wrong, like he wasn’t allowed to have feelings.
He opens the fridge and takes out a plastic box with a pre-made dinner he had made earlier. Abs doesn’t make themselves he tells himself as he eats his salmon with sweet potato and broccoli for the fourth day in a row. He saved money if nothing else he tells himself and it was nice to just heat food up when he got home.
“Oh you know… same old same old. It was boring as hell and I wanted to come home the entire time.” He admits making Tony chuckle. Steve takes Tony’s hand in his and let his thumb run over his scared knuckles. The scars were from his inventions and his battles and each one fascinated Steve. “Are you happy?” He suddenly asks. Tony looks at Steve confused.
“David he is supposed to retire in six months and I am supposed to take over then. I need to go to show them that I can handle this. I am the future CEO and owner of Stark Industries and that will require me to be other places then New York.” Tony tries to explain in a soft tone. As if David was a child.
“This is about me wanting to see my friends! And you need to let this thing with Steve go because I am dating you, not Steve and I would like it if the two of you could get along! He is my best friend.” Tony snaps at David. He had no right to act like this when he was nothing but faithful and loyal towards David.
Under David shocked and confused exterior he was furious and ready to kill while Steve for the first time in almost a year felt hope that he might get his best friend back.
Tony swallows and seems to calm down a bit but still look at him with worried eyes. “I am not worth it Steve and…you… you could lose you license… and I am not worth that!” Tony gets out even if it is mixed up and stuttered.
. The dishes where piling up in the sink, he was pretty sure the laundry was from last week and their dinner lately had been take out almost every night since Tony didn’t know how to cook and he was trying to work from home so he could help out more until things settled with Steve’s new schedule.
“JARVIS Show family album.” In an instant all the pictures they had stored during their years together showed up on his screens and he smiles. It was pictures from their wedding day and Steve looked so amazing in his military uniform, they looked so happy. The next picture was taken from far away but you could see his excitement, he had just found out that Bruce’s daughter Angelica had been accepted to Harvard and he was just about to embrace her into a hug when the photo was snapped. The next one was him with Clint’s children playing football. He looked through several and there were always his friend’s kids nearby and he always seemed happy and carefree when they were around. He moves to his office chair that is more comfortable than his inventor stool. He smiles as he shuffles through the pictures. And suddenly he finds a picture from when he and Steve just started dating or maybe not just started but they were a few months in and had just gone to their first weekend away and they had gotten a stranger to take a picture of them in sunset. Steve who was slightly taller than Tony had rested his forehead against Tony’s looking him in the eyes and Steve had promised then and there that this was forever and he never wanted to let go. And to this day he had kept that promise, the picture made him feel warm and fuzzy inside in a way only Steve could make him feel.
“Again…” David mutters and tugs at his hair again wanting to be deep inside in Tony’s mouth. Tony goes back again and start to take him deeper relaxing his throat and hollow out his cheeks, he almost at the base when David takes a harder grip on his head and begin to pull in and out of Tony’s mouth on his own accord, hitting him at the back of his throat and he felt that his supply of air was running out. He panics trying to pull away from David’s death grip but gets nowhere and only seems to encourage David to move faster into his mouth.
“I just don’t understand why he did it. I mean I tried so hard to make it work and be everything he wanted me to be. But what he wanted would change every day and I just couldn’t keep up.” He says with a defeated voice and his shoulders slumped forward even more.
Feeling pleased with himself he attach his mouth back onto the cock and start to suck and take it deeper, he feels how David tangles his hands into his hair and tugs slightly wanting him to go deeper, he relaxes his throat and push him almost all the way down before going up again for air. Deep throating wasn’t his strongest suit but would do it to the best of his abilities if it pleased his partner.
“He was living in the building me and ma lived in when I was 12. The building was shitty but the people was good and he was a man my ma loved. He was kind and helped out with our shitty apartment, no charge. But a few times I was alone when he came over and ma never worried because he was this nice guy she trusted.” He took a deep breath tears threatening to fall. Tony patted on the bed for him to sit but he stays where he is. “But one day he said that the things he fixed wasn’t free and I was the man of the house and I...” He broke down crying and Tony was there faster then he thought possible and just hugged Steve.
“Didn’t know you would be here.” David says harshly not caring that he was being rude. Steve was his biggest threat and he wanted him gone. “I thought it was a family thing.”
“I am not nagging! You always complain about your job and if you hate it so much you should just quit and get a new job!” Tony replies as calmly as he could knowing very well that David was a ticking bomb and would soon just explode and take it out on him. “And I am sorry if that upsets you but you should think about it.”  He continues.
That was a scary thought that made him wide awake and sleep refusing to come over him. He should be exhausted he knew but he was to strung up to even consider falling asleep right now. He sighs and turn on the TV letting the infomercials run in the background as he pretended to watch them hoping that sleep would finally come to him.
“Why don’t you just put your dicks on the table and measure?” She suggests before taking a sip of her red wine. The white gold band with embedded diamonds into it, Came from Bucky’s grandma Steve knew. Bucky had been worried that it might not be enough for the redhead but the way she looked at it and then at Bucky told Steve that it was more than enough.
“He was really nice in the beginning you know.” Tony explains softly and a small smile plays on his lips. Like he is remembering the good times with David, wishing they could go back there and maybe they could be happy again.
“Its okay, I am here, I got you, I love you” He repeated until Steve calmed down but till clung to him like life depended on it. “You are safe.”
When David arrived home a few days later Tony noticed that David had hickeys on his shoulder. He found red lipstick on the white shirt he had brought. When Tony brought it up David just claimed the hickeys where rashes and the lipstick where from a hug.
“No.” He says. “If you go back there Tony he will kill you. You said so yourself.” Steve rose as well and it seemed like Tony didn’t even listen to him instead he was focused on Steve’s hand that was still clasped around his wrist and Steve realizes that he gripped to hard and to sudden. “I’m sorry.” He says instantly. “But I can’t risk losing you Tony, not again!” Steve admits his eyes never leaving Tony.
“Yeah we can to that.” Tony assures him. “That’s good to know I got a little worried with the butt plug. It was just the usual one we use.” Tony informs him. “Turn around.” He orders and Steve does as he is told and Tony places the lotion on his upper body as well soothing the red marks.
The rest of the drive was silent and passed by quickly and soon enough Tony was in his bed and fell asleep before his pillow hit the head and he could forget about this awful night.
It was not surprising to hear that David had raped Tony during their relationship. But the hurt of not being there for his friend was even worse than he could imagine. How could have he not have noticed or why didn’t Tony say anything to him, Steve would have helped him without a doubt. If he couldn’t be there for his friend back then he would be by his side now and support him every step of the way.
“We can talk after the launch. I know it’s important.”  Steve says before placing a kiss on his husbands lips and gets out of the embrace and begins to
“You know I don’t, I am the owner and CEO and you are more important then anything work related, you know that.”
“Okay sir.” Steve smiles softly to his partner and sprinkle some pepper over the plate, to mush for Tony to ever eat on his own telling Tony that Steve wanted to be feed today and kneel for him. “I made it a little spicier this time sir.” Tony nods with a smile and takes a deep breath letting the wonderful scent fill his nose. He had mentioned that he liked it but it would be even better if it had some kick to it.
Before he opens the tub of lotion he moves to take of the collar but Steve grabs Tony’s wrist and stops him. “Just a little while longer okay?” He asks quietly a blush creeping up his neck and ears.
For a moment Tony relaxes and allows himself to just enjoy the gentle touches over the bruised and sensitive skin. And then he felt how David’s hand wandered lower and in under his boxers and Tony’s entire body tense knowing what’s about to come. “I can make you feel even better.” David promises and Tony just breathe hoping it would be over sooner rather than later.
Tony nods. “Yeah I know. I haven’t had time to book an appointment but I will do that.” Tony assures him and smiles gently trying to make David stay calm and in control, he needed to look fine on his dad’s party. Otherwise all hell would break loose. “But I was thinking about dad’s retirement party, I know you don’t want to go but I have to be there.”
“Yeah? Sorry… I am just a bit tiered. Busy week at the hospital.” He smiles and focuses all his attention to Tony again. “What were you saying?”
They break apart panting slightly before Tony took Steve’s wrists and pulled him towards the center of the room where a hook was sitting in the ceiling; Tony pulled out a chair and stood on it. “Arms above head.” Steve does as he told and stands slightly up on his toes knowing the chain was long enough for him so the soles of his feet would grace the floor. “Do you want the blindfold?” Tony questions and Steve nods, he was going into subspace he noted. He went to their closet where they kept their toys, he hears the door opening and closing behind him and then Tony came up behind him and he felt the soft cotton hit his face and the rubber band closing around his head. Tony’s hands skimmed down his back making every nerve in his body fire up. Then he felt Tony’s finger hook into his boxers and push them down his legs, his fingers ghosting over the skin, he was completely exposed to Tony yet he had never felt safer.
“Okay whatever you say babe… But remember if the kids are there we have to be quiet.” Tony teased. Its quiet between them for a moment and Tony looks into his husbands eye before he speaks again, this time much quieter as he was asking him for his darkest secret. “What is on you mind babe? I can see that something is eating away at you.”
Tony hit him one, two, three, four times in a row and he tried to move and escape the biting leather wanting nothing more than this to stop. Only seven to go! He feels Tony’s hand on his butt and his hand seemed like ice against his burning skin. He drags the calloused finger pads over the burning and swollen skin. It was a simple touch but he whimpered wanting more of the softness. “I know sweetheart. We are almost done.” Tony promises him. Steve takes a deep breath and let it out preparing to the last ones. He could do this.
There was a knock on his door and he just stayed quiet wanting people to leave him alone. But they hadn’t seen him and where worried along with grieving their friend. Steve really didn’t make their lives easier he knew that, he just didn’t know how to breathe without Tony by his side. Everything hurt. It just hurt so fucking much to know that Tony was the one who had to get cancer and die. When he had worked so hard to eat right and exercise and treat his body right after years of abuse.
“Good. That’s the idea.” Tony moves forward and let his mouth trail up the blonde’s spine leaving a trail of open mouth kisses, letting his hands move softly over the ribcage. “So you liked what we did today?” He asks pressing soft kisses to Steve’s shoulder. “I wasn’t too hard on you?” Steve moves his head slightly so they could press a soft kiss to each other’s lips.
Again Steve almost believed the worrisome voice on the other side of the line, but he knew better. He had the evidence in front of him.
“Really David I am fine… I am just going to take a shower and we can go to bed alright?” He doesn’t wait for answer and just goes to the bathroom and lock himself in there before David has a chance to catch up to him. He starts the shower but remained fully clothed as he sits down on the toilet letting out a shaky breath. His throat hurt and his scalp hurt. He sits there for a long while just letting the scene replay in his head as he tried to convince himself that David just like rough sex and got carried away. That’s all this was.
“Let’s begin then.” Tony stops abruptly with his soothing motions. “Open that mouth of yours sweetheart.” Instantly Steve opens it and watches as Tony pulls out his already half hard cock, Steve licks his lips in anticipation making Tony chuckle. “You just love to suck cock don’t you?” He taunts and Steve just nods. Without warning Tony shoves his cock into the wet heat that was Steve’s mouth causing the brunette to groan in pleasure, he grips the blonde hair and start to fuck his mouth and Steve tries his best to make it good for Tony with his tongue and mouth. “You are such a cocksucker aren’t you? You just love to suck cock.” Tony taunts him shoving his cock deeper inside of Steve. “I should take you-fuck, to board meetings- ahh oh god and just let you suck all the board members and-and ah they would say yes to more of my proposals.” He gets out fastening his pace and griping harder at the blonde hair. “Ohh- you would…” He pants. “God, you would like that huh?” He groans. “Just suck dicks all day!” He pulls out for a moment letting Steve take a breath before Steve attached himself to Tony again and started to suck on the head and letting his tongue swirl over it making Tony groan and lean his head back in pleasure. He takes more and let his tongue move on the underside of him and his cheeks hollow out. “Fuck! Such a good cocksucker!” He mutters before spilling inside Steve’s mouth that gladly swallows and suck a few more times making sure Tony is completely empty. Tony pulls out of Steve’s mouth making a small amount of seed come with him but he put his thumb the swollen lips and push it into Steve’s mouth that suck on the thumb for a moment making sure he swallowed every single drop. “Good boy.” Tony praises and Steve beams at this and then Tony put back his dick into his boxer and zips the pants up again.
Steve groans into the shoulder. “You make it sound like I am clingy and needy you know? And I am fine I told you last night.” He argues even though he secretly loved the days they spent together being lazy on the couch and order in food and just watch movies. A day to just be a couple without any interruptions, it didn’t happen too often.
“But what about the house? I mean I always clean and make breakfast and dinner…” Tony interrupts him.
“I love you, you know that right?” Tony questions and Steve nods. He knew very well that Tony loved him and he had never questioned it, he might not say it a lot but he showed it in his actions. “The reason I don’t want kids is because I am terrified that I will turn into my father, a man who despise his family and only prioritizes work and booze. Also that you will despise me for becoming that person I don’t want to be… ” Steve continues with the gentle movements against his scalp and moves to his the nape of his neck. “I know that you liked my dad but I hated the man and him dying in the car crash was a happy day for me.” Tony admits. Steve nods softly.
“Come inside Tony and we can talk there.” Steve offers softly and steps aside so Tony can come inside without touching him. He hesitates but moves inside anyway. “You want anything? Food or water?” Tony shook his head. “Can I look at you? Maybe clean up the wounds?” Tony nods. Steve goes to the bathroom and gets his first aid kit when he returns to the living room Tony has moved and was looking at a framed picture of the two of them in college. Him at Harvard to become a doctor and Tony at MIT so he could take over his father’s company and Steve remembers how many ideas and plans he had to expand the company further. “A miracle that we survived right?” Steve attempt to joke and lighten the mood but Tony just turns around and look at him. “Who did this Tony?” He already knows but he wants to hear it from Tony.
“You are late for work.” He tries as he puts on that fake smile he had perfected over the years when he attended galas and events with Tony.
Tony hid his face in a pillow to allow his tears to fall and biting into the pillow to no to scream in pain as David increase his pace and force. David’s hands that gripped his hips was going to leave bruises he knew that. God it hurt Tony thought and all he wanted was for David to be done.
“Hey Tony, just focus on your breathing.” He can hear Steve far away but does as he told. Steve had helped him several times over the years and had been the one who taught him the breathing exercises in collage. In through the nose and count to four and out through the mouth and count to four and repeat. His heart seemed to calm down and his chest didn’t feel as tight. “Good Tony… Just in and out.” In for four and out for four he reminds himself. His hand loosens around the knob. “Please stay here tonight so I know you are safe.” Steve begs as Tony calms down.
“Green sir.” Then Tony continues to push the plug inside him. Tony press a soft kiss on his lower back and caress him softly on the butt and steps back and he feels the slight burning sensation of being stretched to his limit. Then comes to feeling of leather strings teasing his back and then the sharp sting of Tony smacking him with it causing him to groan and then he feels the stinging sensation again and again over his back, the flogger hugging around the sides of his body when it landed on him. It was almost to mush the sensations of being teased with the flogger and then it stung whenever Tony decided to smack him with it and being stretched to full capacity, wearing the collar Tony gave him and just being fully exposed to someone and trust them so completely and he allowed his mind and body to completely submit to Tony. It was the best feeling Steve had ever felt.
He sounded more and more defeated for each message and Tony was feeling more and more defeated when he failed his friends.
It was late when Tony came home. There was a note on the counter that the dinner was in the fridge. He sighs and heats his dinner and basically inhales it, he hadn’t had anything since breakfast. Then he moves to their bedroom assuming that Steve had gone to bed already but when he opens the door the bed is still made from this morning and Pixie sleeping at the foot of it. He walks in and scratches her behind her ears before changing out of his suit and into a t-shirt and sweatpants. Then the search began for his husband.
“Steve I know you trust you gut for everything but I really think this is just you being jealous and feeling like you missed you chance!” Bucky explains to him and put his hand around his shoulder and squeeze it in an attempt to soothe him. “Maybe it’s time for you to let go and move on from Tony and find a nice guy and settle down.”
“Yeah its because somebody is not answering my call or texts.” Steve tries to say as a joke but comes out more serious then planned.
“You look pale. You might have internal bleeding.” There was no question about it now. Tony needed to go to the hospital if so Steve had to carrying him there himself.
“Yes..” He breathes out. Tony moves away fast and the leather hits his chest again harder this time.
Tony had tried to laugh as the chemo was being pumped into his system but Steve could see that he was terrified and in so much pain, so he had just taken Tony’s hand in his and started talking about the vacation they should take when he was declared free of his cancer.
“Good morning Captain. Rogers. Sir would like you to know that he is in the kitchen preparing breakfast for the two of you and it’s your choice if you want to join him in the kitchen or stay in bed and he will join you as soon as he is done.” JARVIS informs him. He had been living here, officially, for almost two years and the A.I still scared the crap out of him whenever it started speaking to him.
“It’s alright. It’s a big launch.” Steve replies as he turns in his husbands arms. He was used to it. They had been together for twenty years and married for fifteen. Steve knew that the month leading up to the launch was always hectic for Tony. So he always let the genius be and when Tony was done with the launch he came back to the real world and always made up for it by taking Steve away for the weekend or an expensive dinner when the children where younger.
David was sitting on the couch when he entered the apartment. His heart instantly begins beating faster, knowing something is about to happen.
“Yeah he was just wondering what I was doing. He has boring paperwork to do apparently.” Steve is informed not that he actually cares but it’s important to Tony therefore it was his job to be supportive and pretend that he cared about what David was doing. He understood that they were in that honeymoon phase and they were probably competing about who missed the other one more.
He pulled out his now soft cock, bringing with it the sperm and saliva. His mouth remained opened letting strings of saliva and sperm hang from his chin as he was trying to get some air back into his lungs but has barley time to register it when he feel the pad of David’s thumb pushing the saliva and sperm back into his mouth. David seemed happy and had the impression that Tony had enjoyed that if he was supposed to go by his facial expression. “So beautiful like this…” David mutters petting Tony’s hair while he was trying to make sense of all the emotions running around his head right now.
He was sitting in front of the computer again and was as mesmerized as any child could be. It had taken Tony six months of carefully thinking it through and another year to get the adoption to go through and it was three years ago the little boy named Charles, but they called him Charlie, had become a part of their little family. The boy who was turning 8 in a few weeks was always amazed when he was allowed down into the lab with his dad, which was fairly often, and Tony showed him experiments or they messed with JARIVS or Dum-E both which Tony hoped he would take over one day but he was okay if wanted to pursue something else in life to because he would never force Charlie to become him.
“I snooped and you had looked at that specific one eight times.” Steve sighs he knows where this is going. “It should be here in a few days and I was hoping I could use it on you this weekend. If you want?”
“See something you like?” Steve asks trying to sound supportive of his friend’s decisions in life but when it came to things like this he had a hard time being supportive and wanted to kiss the brunette senseless and tell him how he felt about him.
Tony sits down in front of Steve and takes something out of his pocket before taking Steve’s hand into his own and unlocked the cuff. He held up the wrist inspecting the red mark and even though they both knew that it would heal within hours, it felt good to have Tony place his fingers and mouth there trying to sooth it with touches and kisses. The other wrist received the same attention and love. Then Steve leaned forward hiding it in the crook of Tony’s neck, Tony cradled his head softly with one hand on his neck rubbing softly and the other hand stoking softly over his back. “It was intense tonight huh?” Tony asks and Steve just nods into his neck to tired to actually reply with words. “You were amazing though.” Tony praises him. “But you do know that I wouldn’t be mad if you wanted to safe word right?” Tony said this every time to Steve both before and after wanting to make sure that Steve doesn’t push through in fear of his feelings.
Of course Tony’s filter wasn’t on and his thoughts went to worst case scenario before anything else. “So our kids aren’t enough purpose for you?”
He had mentioned it when they had been together for two years and had said one morning in bed that he had been raped as a child and after that they never talked about it again, not that they talked about it a lot then. Steve just said he wanted Tony to know and it wasn’t a big deal and he didn’t want Tony’s pity and he didn’t wanna talk about it again.
It’s quiet between them and it seems like Tony is weighing his options and that was scary, like he believed that David would be good to him if he decided to return home on his own accord. Tony looked up at Steve finally and his eyes still radiated confusion and fear something Steve never wants to see in Tony’s eyes ever again.
“I am not the one who forced you to be a stay at home dad!” Tony mutters as he turns around and walks out the door slamming it as he is out.
“So I got a few interested in science by letting them do code and do their own A.I big deal!” JARVIS still hated him for trying to make a A.I smarter than him and the plan had been to do another Dum-E or U but it had been a bit better then planed and expected.
“Since I was 13 and he 16 and he 32 now so 16 years. He will grow on you I promise. When it comes to me he is a bit protective he always has been.” Tony explains and shrugs. “But once you two get to know each other you will see that he that he is like a gentle giant! He saves spiders for god sake!” He chuckles but David doesn’t look amused nor does it look like he is put at ease by Tony’s clarification.
David tensed up. Talking about his family and the business always made him mad. But Tony needed to be there otherwise his dad would never retire. His mom deserved to have some time with her husband and he had prepared for this his whole life. “Why do you need to go? They will only try to break us apart. Your friends and family hate me you know that!” He was raising his voice.
The next year he went away to MIT. He was happier there. Not over the moon happy but happy enough to be around other people with similar interest and most people didn’t seem to mind that he was so young, there were a few others who were also young and he formed a sort of friendship with. One of them was Pepper Potts, or Virginia was her real name but wanted to be called Pepper for some reason, but she would become one of his best friends. Life was better but not good. At least he was away from Howard. But he didn’t dare to do anything like kiss another boy or underage drinking in case it would come back to Howard in some way. So he focused on his school work. He graduated three years later.
“What are you talking about? I tried to call and text you every day but you never returned them…” Steve explains to him. Which was true, he had been texting Tony almost every day asking him how he was doing or if he wanted to come with them to diffrent events or leaving him voicemails about meeting up for lunch or game night. But Tony never replied and never showed up.
“Tony we haven’t seen you in weeks! Put the phone down and do shots with us!” Pepper whines and he just smiles at his friend who was pretty drunk already and shouldn’t do any more shots if she wanted to come home safely.
Again the warmth of Tony’s body left him and he was standing alone again trying not to move too much which was hard when you could barely touch the floor with your feet. He tried to relax his body but found it impossible and he just clenched down on the beads and that with the small movements caused vibrations on his prostate that just went through his entire body. He was panting and struggling already and they had just begun. Again he felt Tony’s fingers on his spine rough and calloused after years of inventing and working in his workshop. A oddly comforting and loving feeling. He had always loved Tony’s hands and had firsthand experience about the magic they could do when barely trying. He moved around letting his hand drag over the ribcage and up his sternum and landing around the nape of his neck tugging slightly at the hair there, it was rougher then when he had been kneeling but he liked it probably better than the petting motion it was just another way for Tony to show that he was in charge of him.
The lack of Love Steve or I’ll see you tonight with a little heart at the end told Tony that Steve was getting ready mentally for tonight. It was a process for the both of them and often started like this. Usually Steve would make something they would both like for dinner or test something new but on nights when they had scenes he only cared if Tony liked it and he would prepare it with the greatest love and care and depending on the night Steve would either sit beside Tony and eat slowly while he was listing to the brunettes day or one of Tony’s own personal favorite was feeding Steve himself while he had the blonde kneeling beside him on the floor.
“Request denied sir.” The A.I answered and Steve looked at Tony confused. “We changed the code so I can never lock you out again. Now it’s in his code to not only obey my orders but yours to.” Tony shrugs softly.
“I am only acting like this because I don’t want to lose you Tony! I worry when you don’t answer my calls or text.” David wraps his arms around Tony in a tight embrace and the cologne David wore and that he found once intoxicating  made Tony sick to his stomach right now. He forced tears to stay inside his eyes and it took everything in him to not throw up then and there. “You just push my buttons when you make me look like a bad guy when all I do is for you and because I love you!” He says into Tony’s ear. He nods slowly not being able to talk for the life of him even though he wants to scream at him to leave him the hell alone and never come back.
“Found you a new toy that I just had to try out on you today.” Tony informs him and push the small item in, he guess anal beads and that was fine he could handle that it was not overly stimulating and something he could control. Then the next bead pushed inside him he groans slightly by the action he would always enjoy being entered by Tony or other things, normally a thought like that would make him blush but he was so far beyond that limit right now. He groans again when the third bead enters him. “There all done.” Tony informs him. “Good boy.” He lets go of the hip and Steve tries to balance on his own and he realizes that these where no ordinary beads. He could feel small vibrations through his body with every little movement he made causing him to groan. “Yeah those will vibrate whenever you move...” Tony’s hot breath on his ear made his body shiver in pleasure and then he remembers that he was not allowed to come… Yeah this would be a tad bit harder than he had planned.
“Hey, it me. Pepper just texted me and they are going out tonight and I was thinking that maybe I could go with them and you could see your friends. You haven’t seen them in while.” Tony says and he can hear how David’s breathe get stuck and there is suddenly tension over the phone that had never been there before.
“I’ll think about it…” He gets out barley a whisper. “When did you know he was bad news?” Tony suddenly asks.
“No we won’t! You are late and you refuse to see reason!” Steve shouts. He didn’t mean to shout but sometimes he just got so angry.
“It’s okay to miss him, to cry for him and even hating the world. It’s healthy it’s what you should do.” She tells him. “I miss him every day Steve we all do. But hiding up here and not even trying to heal is not healthy.” She ads softly.
“Hello there!” Tony was confident and could get any man or woman he decided he wanted unless it was six foot tall, blonde and 220 lbs. of muscle then he became terrified and was certain that said blonde would laugh at him, but he pushes that thought aside for the moment since he was trying to flirt with someone else and hopefully get the blonde to be jealous. “My name is Tony Stark. What is yours?” He had his most charming smile on and look into the green eyes with a hint of hazel Tony notes, the man in front of him smiles back at him somewhat nervous and shy but a smile none the less and as he reaches his hand out to take Tony’s he replies.
“Green… so green sir.” He breathes out. Tony doesn’t reply to it but he feels a soft kiss on his shoulder and a hand holding on to his ribcage squeezing softly. He lets go and Steve takes a deep breath in knowing that Tony will start again soon. He feels the callused fingers move along where he assumed a red mark was because Tony had hit him there and he enjoys the roughness of the finger against his back pushing slightly into the touch making the beads remind themselves. Like he could forget them he thinks to himself.
“It’s Tony. If you don’t bring him flowers he will find a way to make you suffer from the other side.” Natasha replies ignoring the bitterness in his voice. “And he loved the flowers you gave him… Didn’t matter if they came from a fancy flower shop or if you picked them in the backyard, it was from you therefore he loved it.” She smiles fondly at the memory of seeing Tony’s stupid smiles the first time Steve sent flowers to him on his birthday. He somehow from the middle of nowhere and undercover managed to send Tony a flower bouquet.
“Its an apology. I was an ass to you and I am sorry. You didn’t deserve that.” Steve says and hands Tony the wine glass who gladly takes it. “I thought maybe we could eat, drink some wine and just talk. It feels like I have only yelled at you lately.” Steve offers.
They had a car come and get them and David muttered something about it but Tony kissed him and promised him everything would be fine, that they would have great time tonight and they could just enjoy themselves.
Tony takes a deep breath before he starts talking in a quiet voice. “It all started three years ago when we went out to celebrate Bucky and Nat’s engagement…”
“Yeah but if they don’t appreciate you and want you to look bad you should go to some place where they want you and your abilities. You are good at your job so why shouldn’t you be in an environment you thrive?” Tony wonders, wanting only the best for the man he loved. Of course David saw it as Tony undermining him and trying to make him look stupid. Luckily they were alone so no one was around to see when he was being undermined by his boyfriend.
“Hi… Yeah I am why do you ask?” He asks slowly as he shakes her hand. His mind running a thousand miles an hour trying to figure out if he knew her or if she was trying to make him look bad in the tabloids. She wouldn’t be the first. Nor the last.
Then when he became a teenager he tried to find a nice girl like his father suggested he do. God knows he tried but the few girls he met he felt nothing for and even fewer even wanted anything to do with him. But when he was 14 he found this amazing guy named Shawn he was 15, hazel eyes, dark blonde hair, more muscular then Tony himself and a smile to die for. It was with Shawn Tony realized he was gay and he began his secret relationship with Shawn. He knew that his father would never approve of him being gay so he just said that Shawn was a friend and Howard bought it for a while thinking it was no harm in letting him have a friend.
Tony takes his hand and presses his lips to his wrist softly. “Just that I am so happy that you are mine.” He answers truthfully.
“I promise.” Tony says smiling and press his mouth to David’s who responded in the same softness as his words.
” If Steve hadn’t been Tony’s best friend and just been an outsider looking in on David’s and Tony’s relationship he would probably bought David’s story right now. But he was Tony’s best friend and he didn’t care if Tony pushed first he would protect Tony at all cost.
” He answered and Tony was feeling all warm and fuzzy inside and had at once a stupid smile on is face and could feel his cheeks flush like a school girl.
“Guys… I would like to be alone with Steve…” His voice weak and breaking so he has to catch his breath between words. One by one they hug the genius and tell him they love him and tell little inside jokes in attempt to forget for a moment that it was probably the last time they would talk to him. Pepper was the last one to hug him and place a kiss on his forehead. He tries not to listen in on the hushed conversation between the two best friends. “
“Tony!” Tony froze instantly when Steve spoke louder and harder than he had planned on. “I am sorry.” His voice softens but Tony still seemed frozen, like he was waiting for Steve to actually hurt him and that broke Steve’s heart more than anything because he would never hurt Tony like that. “Please don’t go.”
Steve put the cup down on to the coffee table in front of Tony. “If you want it…” He offers softly and sits down on the other side of the couch again. Slowly Tony moves over the couch and grabs the cup before pushing himself back to his place, holding the warm cup and takes little sips of the liquid.
“You need to let go or he will do something.” Tony hisses to David again knowing Steve will always be stupid kid who punches people to protect Tony, even at a public event. Tony looks up and sees Steve coming closer.
“And I will help out more.” Steve promises. "Again I am sorry for yelling at you, I guess I thought that I saw it as a failure if our home wasn't as prestine as it used to be and I don't know... My insecurities got the best if me." Steve admits.
“I am sorry alright?  Let’s just forget about it and continue watching the movie.” Tony says barley above a whisper moving towards the corner of the couch trying to escape the abuse that was about to come by making himself small.
“Steve?” His trance was broken and he was forced back to reality when he much rather be in dreamland and fantasizing about Tony and what he could do to that body. He looks into the brown eyes that seemed confused to his sudden silence.
“I came to talk to you Anthony.” Howard’s voice was as cold and hard as it had been 15 years ago but this time Tony wasn’t scared of him. “Can I come in?” He questions.
It was quiet between them and Steve wonders what is going on inside Tony’s head. He decides against trying to convince Tony that David’s behavior was abusive and controlling. He was pretty certain that Tony already knew this, deep down but he knew and didn’t need another nagging voice. He should talk to a therapist that could help him figure everything out and the support group at the church where people who had been in similar situations.
“You would be a great dad you know that right?” Steve brings him back to their living room. Tony look at his husband once again. He had told him parts of his childhood but not the worst part since he knew that Steve had liked his father so he tried not to ruin his memory of him.
“You are not broken and I am not you leaving you. Not now, not ever. You hear me? Its you and me to the end!” Tony assures him hugging him tighter if possible. “Tell me what you need from me and I will make it happen.” Tony promises.
“Maybe we can go again?” Tony didn’t answer but that was alright because David knew what Tony wanted so he let his hand wander down and begins to lose him up some more all while ignoring the tension in Tony’s body and the tears coming from his eyes.
“I told you I was going to be with my friends! I haven’t seen them in like a month!” Tony defends himself and opens the door letting them both inside. “And I told you that I would call you tomorrow after my meeting!” Tony continues as he shrugs his coat off and hangs it up before heading to his living room with David close behind. “Is this the way you are going to act whenever I am with my friends or doing things without you!?” He questions harshly.
“I bribed them to stay with friends tonight, I think Joanna is staying at a boy’s house so we might want to talk to her about that, but I was not in a position to argue.” Steve explains and Tony just nods, knowing that they could trust Joanna and if she wanted to have sex she would probably have it. At least they had the talk with her. “And I want to talk to you alone.”
But now he had an hour to get some things from the mall. He needed a really good body scrub to wash his skin clean. And as he was in the store looking around for the things he was looking for as someone cleared their throat behind him to get his attention. As he turns around there is a woman who looked beautiful, happy. Quite tall and slim, light brown hair with highlights in it and dressed in a dark blue suit with a white shirt underneath and high heels.
“They can survive on their own for a week! Or we let them spend a week at Clint and Laura’s farm they need to get out of the city more!” Tony suggests.
“And I am trying!” Tony snaps back rises from the chair. “It’s just that my work have been taking up most of my time!” Tony says in a calmer tone. “I am so close to breaking this thing!”
“Thank you sweetheart. You are so good to me.” Tony praises him and Steve’s beams by the small compliment. He loved hearing he did things good and even better that he was good for Tony. “Take the plate and place it on the table and I will be there in a moment okay?” Steve nods and takes the plate and the glass of water and heads to the dining table. Tony goes to the living room and gets a pillow and a wooden box he had been hiding in the bookshelf before going to the dining table again. He put down the pillow by his chair. “Kneel sweetheart.” Steve obeyed and let his knee’s land on the soft pillow. “I got something for you.” He smiles and opens the wooden box. Steve can’t see what’s in it but he feels it going around his neck.
“I couldn’t sleep so I took a walk.” Tony lies. It was easier to lie to David then Steve. It wasn’t like David believed him anyway. David always assumed he lied and that he was cheating on him every time Tony left the house.
“I will not come home one day and find you having shot your brains out or have you leave me because you couldn’t take it any longer. So if you need to go back to work you do that and I will help out more at home until we find a routine. Okay?” Tony looks at him with the brown eyes that had not changed one bit over the last twenty years.
He moves down to his abdomen and let the leather hit there two times in a row. He takes in a sharp breath at the stinging sensation. Then Tony came into his space again and let one of his fingers trace around the nipple still being quiet and he isn’t sure if he likes it or not but there was something about the tense silence between them and just let their breathing and the sound of the leather hitting his skin that made Steve’s mind just go to mush it could also be the fact that he was in subspace and everything was nice and the only thing existing in his mind was pleasing Tony and making sure that Tony was proud of him. “The peak of the human species beneath my fingers and you would let me do anything to you right now if you knew it would make me happy wouldn’t you sweetheart?” A slight taunt comes through Tony’s lips and he knows deep in his core that Tony would never go outside his limits so he knows he can play along without concern about the consequences. Tony would bring him to the edge over and over again but never pushing him over the edge.
David takes another bite of his food and seems eerily calm about the entire situation and for a moment Tony wonders if he should just take his chance and run. But his legs don’t seem to get the memo. So he just waits for David to speak again.
“Yeah I finished up faster then planned and I missed you.” He ran a hand through Tony’s hair. “You could use a hair cut.”
It was late when Tony got through the door. He was surprised when he heard soft music coming from the kitchen and living room as well as a soft glow illuminating the hallway. He dumps the keys in the bowl they had by the door. Slowly he moves towards the sound and sees Steve standing by the kitchen counter, the dishes were gone and the mess that had been on the counters where gone as well and there was candles lit on every flat surface and Steve was holding two glasses of red wine with two plates of grilled cheese on the counter. Steve peace offering.
He sighs and start to work on his computer and turn on his music loudly as he usually does when he plays on his computer but now it wasn’t play it was opening up completely. It took him six years but he finally did it. “JARVIS ask Steve to come up here.”
“You are cheating!” Bucky burst suddenly and Steve laughs at the outburst disturbing the duos conversation.
Finally David pull out of him for long enough for him to get some air but he has barley time to get it into his lungs before he forced to take David’s cock forcefully again. He could feel tears building up in his eyes from the lack of air and the pain of his forceful movement into his mouth. He could hear David chanting how good it was. And then he felt warm spurts coming down his throat and David pressed him close to his groin as he rode out his orgasm. Muttering how great it was and how great Tony was at taking his cock.
“Good boy.” Then the final blow final came and Steve was too exhausted to even cry out in pain even though it was the worst one. Tone began to unbuckle him from the spreader bar and soothes his wrist and ankles with his finger pads before he got up on all four, his shoulders and back protesting after being locked down for so long. Then he felt the vibrator being pulled out of him making him whimper by the loss. “One final things sweetheart and we are done.” Tony was moving his fingers along his spine and shoulder blades in soft motions calming him down.
Natascha and Bucky said a few weeks before their wedding that Tony was welcome to attend but David wasn’t. They didn’t want the drama he would surely bring. Tony had tried to convince them to let him come but they had stood their ground, David was not welcome to their wedding and if Tony didn’t want to show up because of it well then that was his choice.  David had become furious and said he had awful friends and shouldn’t spend time with them if they didn’t support their relationship because he loved Tony above all else so Tony should feel the same way about their relationship. He deleted all the contact information he had to them while David was watching.
“Yes. And I will not let you into my life and ruin everything I have with him, because that’s what you always do and I will be left to clean up the mess.” He took a deep breath. “So no, you will not get a second chance and I don’t want to hear from you ever again.” And with that he closed the door and he could feel a few tears fall down his face which he quickly wipes away before going to the kitchen were Steve and Maria was drawing. He walks over to them and let a hand squeeze Steve’s shoulder and press a soft kiss to Maria’s head while watching her draw a horse. He feels an arm snake around his waist and pull him closer to press a kiss on his shoulder.
“Mhm.. yeah sir.” He groans as Tony ads more pressure to his perineum and he tries to move with him making the beads move more. “Please…Ahh” He wanted release now. But Tony would not give that to him yet he knew that. But his fingers felt so good! Tony drops the riding crop onto the floor and let his hand do lazy strokes over his overly sensitive shaft by now. “Ooh god please… oh s’good… Please…” He begs wanting nothing but release from this painful buildup but of course Tony knows him well enough to know when he is about to come and stop right before and takes a step back letting Steve breathe for a moment and calm down.
“Yeah sure. I’ll make sure he contacts you.” Steve lies smoothly and hangs up him after they said their good byes.
“No.” Howard didn’t like that answer. He was still under the belief that Tony feared him and wanted to please his father something had worked through years ago with the help of Steve and a lot of therapy. He didn’t need his father’s approval. He had a family who wanted him and loved him unconditionally. Blood didn’t make a family. Love did he had learned that while being with Steve.
That was the choice that made Tony a prisoner in his own home and wasn’t allowed to see his friends and family for the next year and a half.
“Yeah but still… I want this to be good for you.” He takes the other bottle and moves so he straddles Steve’s thighs. “This okay?” Steve just nods into the pillow he was holding and Tony begins to pour the new liquid over his back and start to massage his back and shoulders, getting out knots and strained muscles.
Suddenly an arms goes out and hit Steve square in the jaw. The jealousy and anger had taken over David and he actually hit Steve. Before pushing him to the ground. “You leave Tony alone your fucking asshole!” Then kicked Steve in the stomach.
“And to Tony who finally will be sole owner of Stark Industries and will solve the equation to green energy!” Steve chimes in and they finish their champagne. The night continues with random dancing and impromptu speeches to celebrate whatever was going on in their life at that moment and just having fun with friends.
I know its almost a year since I last posted on this. But over the last year I have focused on myself. My anxeity and depression was at the worst it has ever been and I needed to get a handle on it and while this was going on i was experiencing burnout signs, because I have been working non-stop to have the money to finally be able to buy my own apartment.
“We know Steve. But he means a lot to us to. And he would kill us if we didn’t show up without god reason.” Clint replies earning a smile from Steve. Slowly they make their way to his grave.
David ate a few spoons of his ice cream as he tried to calm himself down but Tony just made it so hard to stay calm when Tony insisted on pushing his buttons. He was aware that he was good at his job and that he could go to any firm he wanted and he would succeed with flying colors. He didn’t need his boyfriend pushing him to change jobs.
The ‘thing’ was an AI that Tony had tried to create for years but still hadn’t been able to crack and Steve knew that it was important to Tony and it would guarantee him a place in the history books. Bu like he said he didn’t care right now. All he wanted to know was why it was so hard to put the dirty dishes in the dishwasher and the laundry in the washing machine, for a genius his husband was stupid sometimes.
“I am sure he is planning something fun and out of the box. It’s Happy after all.” Tony assures her. “Do you even own anything other than Jimmy Cho?” Tony teases and Pepper just stick her tongue out in a mature fashion.
“Tony. This is not your fault.” He was firmer in his tone but still kind and gentle. “It is never okay to hurt anyone. Never, so this is on him not you!” He tries to convince him but he knows it will take months maybe even years before he believed him. Tony continues to fiddle with his shirt and focuses on the floor.
“He always said that…” His voice faltered. “If… if… if I…” God Steve would think he was so stupid. “I where ever… to.. leave…” He swallows before speaking again. “He would… would kill you…” He admits in a whisper.
David was out of town for a business trip. Tony was relived to have some time alone even though David called every chance he got and Tony needed to text him every hour telling him where he was and who he was spending time with and if David didn’t approve of him activities or the people he was with he had to go home. Even if he was in an important meeting or work in general. If David didn’t approve he couldn’t be there and a part of Tony knew that it wasn’t right but then the image of Steve being dead because of him and he pushed that thought away and he did as he was told. Because Steve was more important and he should not die just because Tony couldn’t follow orders.
“I am sorry to hear that babe.” Tony replies and places a kiss on David neck. “Maybe you should switch firm? It doesn’t feel like the right fit for you.” David had complained a lot over the last months about his work and Tony was quite frankly sick of hearing it. If he was so unhappy at his current job he should switch.
“No sir. I won’t!” He gets out in a quiet voice. He was exhausted and just wanted this to be over with. The leather hits him again. Just one to go. One more and he would be done with this punishment!
He glance up to Tony who meets his eyes and he smiles before burying his face back down into his midsection and he could feel Tony starting to vibrate with laughter.
Pepper and Rhodey was in town at the same time and wanted to meet up for dinner and drinks with Tony. He said he couldn’t because he was busy at work. The truth was that he was sporting a black eye he could not cover up unless he got a make-up artist right this second. Also David didn’t like him drinking and suggested he drop a few pounds. David just wanted what’s best for him he knew that but it hurt to hear sometimes.
Their deal to not go to bed angry seemed out the window as well. Steve went to bed after he put down Joanna for the night at 8.30 pm.
David’s entire body tensed up and everything in Tony screamed that this was a mistake and that the earth should open up and swallow him whole because that would be a better option then what was coming. He had offended David and that was never good.
Steve Stark had done a lot for his family. He had never regretted it and would never regret it. He loved his family and he loved his children and would do anything for them. That’s why he had no problem quitting his job as an art teacher when they were younger to take care of them, they needed him more then he needed his job and that was a sacrifice he was willing to make even as his husband said that they could work out a schedule between their jobs. But he knew that would be next to impossible and he wanted to make sure that his kids knew who their parents where and not let them be raised by different nannies and staff. He wanted a family then he should be there for them as well.
The smile on Steve’s face was made the whole argument worth it to Tony, because Steve’s happiness would always be so much more important than his own even if he had to clean the house all on his own.
“You wanted it to be me huh?” Tony taunts and stops his motions and pulls out of him making Steve feel empty.
“Good.” He took the black blindfold and put it over Steve’s eyes. He goes around the table again letting the finger tease the spine sending shivers through Steve’s body. Every time he had the blindfold on it felt like every nerve in his body was on fire. “Tell me sweetheart how did you make yourself come in the shower today? Like this?” He felt a firm hand around his cock giving him a few firm strokes earning Tony a pleasurable groan. “Or was it like this?” A firm squeeze around his balls, Steve whimpers when Tony moves his hand to his perineum and moved over with soft fingers. “Maybe like this? I know you love to be touched here.” Again he stops abruptly making Steve groan longingly.
He pulls out the plug leaving the hole empty and gaping wanting to be filled by Tony. But Tony of course just has to tease and mess with him and fucks him slowly with two fingers and brush against the prostate making him shift back against the fingers wanting more than he was getting. “You are so greedy sweetheart.” Tony taunts him and he can only groan in response. Because he was right now he just wanted Tony to put his dick inside him and fuck him senseless. “But I have never been able to say no to you.” He unzip his pants and moans when, at least what Steve assumes is when he puts lube on himself and then enters him in full force holding himself steady on Steve’s hips and start moving angling himself so he brushes over his prostate with every move. “Come like this or don’t come at all.” Tony informs him and he is so grateful for the permission. He start to arch his back to Tony could have better access and actually hit his prostate more. “Fuck you are so hot like this.” He clutches the desk wanting this to last as long as possible but it was hard when he had been so close all night and just wanted to come.
“David!? What the fuck?!” He screams to the older man trying to pull out of his bone crushing grip but gets nowhere.
“Yes he is freaky but then again I thought that about Tony to before I got to know him! And there is still times when Tony freaks me out!” That was true. Tony’s genius freaked most people out. They had made it into a party game out of it. Who is faster the calculator or Tony? The premise was easy they said a hard equation and Tony had to do it in his head and the other one used the calculator on their phone and who ever lost had to do shots. Tony rarely had to take the shots. This had also made it easy when they had to split a bill.
“I am ah…” He groans and again trying to move his hips but it’s nearly impossible. “So sorry.. oh please… sir!” He finally says. “I am so close!”
His cock twitches at the word punishment and a small part of him just wants to do it so Tony would punish him severely for his misbehavior but the majority of him just wants to be good for Tony so he sighs and tries to think about old grandma’s and socks. It doesn’t work.
“Who is that daddy?” She questions and points to man that are her grandfather but as far as she knew his parents were dead.
His phone sounded and lit up by his side. Fuck had they been sitting here for almost an hour?! David would be furious that he hadn’t checked in! He opened the text and as expected it was from David and of course he was furious!
“You have met him Bucky tell me that he doesn’t freak you out!?” Steve tries again. That was also a thing if Tony showed up to things David was always with him and Tony would look at him like he put the moon in the sky all while Steve just had to control himself to not break David’s nose.
Steve sighs and takes a sip of his beer trying to push his thoughts away and focus on the game. It was just easier said than done.
The next morning he woke up as his doorbell rang and rang and rang until he finally got up and stumbled though his apartment and opened it. Outside there was a young man with a big bouquet of flowers in different shapes and colors , a box of chocolates, bottle of wine and a smaller box in blue with a white bow on it. “Tony Stark?” The young man holding the gift asks.
“I have been waiting for you for two hours!” David says harshly as Tony gets closer to the door and he doesn’t understand why David is mad at him. He had informed him that he would be with his friends tonight and had an early meeting so he wouldn’t have time to see David. Yet here he was standing by his door waiting anyway.
“Make yourself come for me sweetheart.” Tony looked at him as he stroked himself and it only took a few strokes until he spilled over himself letting out a grateful whimper. It was so good to finally come. “Such a good boy for me.” Tony praises petting his hair. “Can you stand up please?” With that sentence Steve knew the scene was over, when they were in a scene Tony never said please to Steve. On shaky legs he gets up and wraps his arms around Tony burying his head into the crook of Tony’s neck feeling his tears collecting there. Tony stroked him with big motions over his back and hugged him tight. “You okay babe? Was it too much?” Tony sounded worried.
“Tony I may have liked Howard but I love you and you will always come first. So if you hate him so will I!” Tony smiled softly to Steve. He was cute when he tried to hate people but it wasn’t really in his personality, but he loved the effort though. “But back to the kids thing… If you truly don’t want kids I will respect that and it will be just the two of us and that will be amazing to but I really think you don’t have anything to worry about…” Tony nods and sighs.
It had started when Tony went into product launch mode the first year they had dated and they were about five months in and Steve was certain that Tony had grown sick of him and was just ignoring him when he didn’t pick up his phone for weeks and at the time Steve didn’t have a cellphone so he just had to wait patiently and when Tony came out of his launch mode he apologized over and over again and took Steve away to his house in the Hamptons and they barley left the bed for the entire weekend. And the tradition was born and Steve didn’t need the reassurance anymore like he did that first year but it was always nice to get away with Tony.
In rage David rose from his chair and pushed Tony out of his way making him lose his balance and hit the back of his head on the edge of the kitchen table. “Don’t talk to me like I am a child! And stop talking about you being CEO you are just handed something you can’t even handle….”
On New Year’s Eve two years later Steve proposed to him. He had done it properly and gone down on his knee and gotten a ring in gold, the fireworks exploding around them promising to love him forever and never let go, they had their friends and family around them making the moment perfect. They got married in September that year. It was a small ceremony with family and friends in New York. They had gotten lucky with the venue with a last minute cancelation so they booked it then and there. That had been in May so it was a slightly rushed wedding but none the less perfect for them. They had said I do to each other and that was all they wanted and needed.
But of course Tony didn’t see it that way, no he thought that this was his fault and he should have seen it coming even when he did absolutely nothing wrong. Or that he could have done something to prevent it but of course everyone but Tony knew that it was impossible. David was a sick person and would hurt anyone he was in a relationship with and make them believe it was their own fault.
“No? Not that I am aware of.” He groans as he moves his head giving Tony better accesses, causing the brunette to chuckle against his throat.
He replies. He decide to look through his fridge and cabinets so he could write a list before going to the store tomorrow. He put on some music before he started, letting the music fill the room. His phone vibrated again.
“It’s easy for you to say. Everyone loves you without even trying and you know how to make small talk without making it awkward.”
Hello there! Its late and I am tiered but you know the drill! Kudos and comments make me happy! No beta so all mistakes are my own!
“I know sir. But I have only myself to blame.” Steve answers truthfully. If he just followed the rules Tony wouldn’t have to do this and they could be having the lovely evening Tony had planned for them.
“No gag then.” Ton says softly and Steve feels bad for ruining Tony’s plans. “No problem okay? Nothing bad will happen because of this alright? You feeling safe and comfortable is more important than a gag.” Tony assures him again. Steve nods believing him on this. He trusted Tony.
“Tony I know!” He snaps. Putting the now empty bowl on the coffee table. “Why do you always have to ruin the moment by nagging about my job!” He was getting angry and it was Tony’s fault. They had been having a perfectly nice evening together and then he just had to start nagging and complaining.
“I love you to.” Steve smiles. “And thank you for last night and today…” A small blush crept up on his neck. “I need it more then I like to admit.”
“Its his son.” Rachel states. Tony meet her eyes and for a moment it seems like the entire world stopped and the only thing he could hear was his own heart beating and his breath becoming short.
“Who?! You got Rhodey right there!” He makes a motion with his head to show the other man who makes an awkward small wave as he continues to hold Pepper up at his side.
Steve took a deep breath. “The belt sir.” He answers and Tony seems to consider it. They rarely used the belt since it wasn’t a favorite between them, but it seemed fitting for this moment.
“I know. But we have just started dating and I didn’t want to seem like a douche. And I really liked you so I pretended to like it… Seemed like a small price to pay.” Tony shrugs and takes another sip of the wine. “Where are the kids?” He asks.
It stops suddenly and Tony moves away and he can hear the chair scraping again and he felt those rough hands on his own and before he knew it his arms was down again and the blood came rushing back to his arms. Tony takes his hand and moves him slowly and stops him a few steps and start to bend him over what he assumed was the desk and he was painfully reminded how hard he was but he was proud that he had held on this far. He grips his hands on the edge of the desk. “So good for me.” Tony murmurs. “Flogger or paddle?” He questions.
“Put these on and I will just put some things away I will be right back and join you okay?” Again petting his hair and Steve nods and does as he is told and crawls down under the covers and watch as Tony puts the things back into it places and he chuckles softly at the broken desk that is the last he remember before he drifts off to a peaceful slumber.
“You have nothing to be sorry for love.” Steve assures him and presses his lips to Tony’s forehead. “You fought as hard as you could I know you did and I am so proud of you and I am so glad to call you my husband and you will always be my husband!” Steve assures him. “I will not find someone else Tony and you know that…” That hurt Tony because that meant that Steve would be alone for so long and Steve didn’t deserve that and he would argue if he had the energy.
He feels the calloused hand on him again. “You are so good for me. You take it like a good boy.” Tony praises. Smack.
One would think that Tony would stay away and never ever let David into his life again. But something shifted inside Tony when he began receiving flowers with handwritten letters begging for forgiveness and explaining why he was sorry and what he did was unforgivable but he loved Tony and wasn’t ready to let him go. Maybe should have been a warning sign for Tony but he was missing David as well and decided to invite him for a coffee, coffee turned into lunch, lunch turned into dinner, dinner turned into staying the night.
“No I know… But I do know David.” His breath was caught in his throat and he don’t know if he should run as fast as he can or stay and hear her out. She remained calm and gave nothing away. Unlike Tony who thought there was a big sign on his head telling the world exactly what was going on behind closed doors. Of course that wasn’t the case but it felt like it.
Again Tony moved away from him taking his hand with him making Steve whimper at the lost touch but Tony just remains quiet. Then he feels the soft leather on his sternum then moving down slowly over his midsection down to his abs around his navel down to his groin and out on sensitive erection causing him to groan and move his hips sending the vibrations of the beads through his body. He tried to catch his breath but it was hard when the flap of leather was slowly moving back and forth over his sensitive erection. Tony moves the leather up his body again and ever cell in his body seemed to fire of by the simple touch. Then he removes it from his body only to have it land over his pectorals with a soft clash against his now sweaty skin causing a slight sting but nothing unbearable. He lets out a groan that comes deep from inside him a sound mixed with pain and pleasure. The best sound in the world if you were to ask Tony.
