"Tired. Feeling guilty that Pete knows about my scars, and I'll have to explain them-- but I'm trying not to think about it," Tony mumbled, turning over to curl up to Steve, "I'm just glad he's okay."
Steve eyed Peter carefully as the boy ran, making sure he didn't fall before turning to Tony. He padded over to him carefully, making their lips only inches apart.
"Oh bubba..." Steve said sympathetically. He sat on the bed (thankfully Peter hadn't thrown up on there), rubbing the boy's back gently.
Tony flicked his eyes up to Steve, slowly sitting on Pete's hammock so the kid could easily place the bandaids on him. With a slight whimper, Tony took off his t-shirt, trying not to wince at the boy's hands.
"Wish I would've known that. I'm sorry." Steve said sincerely to Tony, petting Peter's hair with his free hand.  "You don't have to worry about that though, Peter. If you ever feel you aren't challenged enough or too little, you can let me know. I'll let you know if it’s something I can't handle, okay?"
"Mmhm. Shush. Sleep," Tony chuckled, "You'll feel better when you wake up, okay? I'm right over there if you need me."
"I do everything I can to make you happy and warm and comfy," Tony murmured, leaning against Steve's chest, "I love you, y'know."
"Mmhp," Steve breathed, rocking his hips back gently with it. "What is this one?" He asked curiously, letting out a moan as he felt it move a little.
He looked back at Steve. The captain had a deep look of disgust on his face as he glared at Tony. Something was up. Steve never glared at any of his teammates like that. Well, he did when he first met Tony, but he didn't do it anymore. They had come to a mutual friendship. So this was abnormal.
"Just.... conversation," Natasha hummed, swirling around a glass of what looked like white wine, "Talking about our significant others."
Tony went quiet and buried his face in Steve's neck, letting the words wash comfort over him. He huffed and sniffled, eventually nodding.
"He does. Rather fluently, actually." Steve stated with a nod. "He tried to teach me a little, but he just ended up confusing me." He said with a quick chuckle.
"Look, I've used that one on your Papa more times than I care to count. You have three seconds to open this door. Three--"
As his hair was cut, Steve went through the normal chatter that came with the routine. Tatianna had asked where he was from, being foreign from what she gathered from Tony. When he supplied 'The ocean', Tony clarified it with "Oceania. He's from New Zealand, originally.". Steve supposed that would be a bit more believable. Telling people he was a merfolk seemed to be met with insanity, if Pepper's reaction earlier was an accurate one to the situation.
"Ooo. Then I could have me a sundae, couldn't I?" Steve purred, setting his hands along Tony's hips.  "I think that could wait, though. Don't want you to leave just yet. You just got here." He said playfully.
"Anyway you wanna do it, hun." Steve replied softly. "Any way that feels awesome and'll leave me hobblin'."
The dreams were reoccurring. Well, maybe not reoccurring, but they would continue where they left off from the night prior. He would be in a vast room- with no noticeable beginning or end to it- sat in a chair, hands gripping tight to the arms of the furniture and refusing to let go.
"We're hoping these will settle his tummy, Daddy." Steve explained, letting Peter sit on his lap as he ate his crackers and drank a little juice. "He threw up, but he did it in the trash can, so he did good."
"Wanna make you feel good." He hummed, looking up at Tony. "Want you to feel good, baby. That's all I want."
"That would be nice, thank you." Steve answered quietly, looking to Tony with a bit of concern. He was worried for Sharon after all that. They knew she had a memory problem, but didn't think it's get that bad so soon.
"I know you're hot, sweetie, it's the fever," Tony murmured, leaning down to press a kiss to Steve's temple, "You need to let it run its course, okay? Give it a bit, and we'll get you back in the shower later to help. Alright, honey?"
The room looked like it was taken out of a snapshot in his mind, the area looking just like The Stork Club that he had visited many a time decades ago. All that was missing was the inevitable decay that was on the actual Stork Club, if it was still standing at all, and the people.
"So good... You're so good, Tony..." Steve whispered breathlessly against Tony's skin, leaving gentle kisses on every inch of skin he could.
"Mean," Tony pouted, arms still around Steve, "We need to talk about what you want there. I'll have some people deliver groceries, but I mean
"Y’know, whoever picks soulmates deserves a raise," Tony laughed softly, lacing their hands together, "I'm still in shock over you."
He smirked, tugging on Steve's shirt so he'd come down for a kiss. Steve kissed him back happily, cupping Tony's face and stroking his cheeks with his thumbs.
Tony buried his face in the comforter again, so the blond wouldn't see the tears streaking down his face.
He stumbled lightly towards the bathroom, taking care of his morning business before he would head out to find Tony. Before he left the bathroom however, Steve stopped as he caught his new reflection.
"Noh held. Ev'ybody needs t'be held. M'too old for silly," Peter announced, flipping to the next page of his book, "S'a dumb word."
"I wanted to sew the eye back on, but Steve insisted I leave it the way it was," Tony chuckled, reaching up to brush his fingers through Peter's hair.
After having his quick look throughout the room, Peter ran towards Steve and Tony, hugging at their legs.
He made a quick whine as he felt Tony flick his tongue along the slit. "And you're a pro with that mouth, good lord."
"Chronic? Or torture, depending," Tony hummed, blowing smoke up into the air, "I should add, Rogers, despite a medical degree, you do flush easily at intimate conversation."
Tony bent to press a kiss to Peter's temple before gently putting him over his lap, grabbing a pillow for Peter to rest his head on.
"All that is how love and being loved makes you feel. All the blushing and stammering, that's what love does to you." He explained with a smile, cupping Tony's face. "That’s why I love seeing you like that. Because its letting me know you truly feel loved."
"Mmm, I've had an hour or two to think about it," Tony grinned, shucking Steve's pants down, "Off, babe."
Tony just hummed, tugged Steve over by his belt loops and pushed him none too lightly onto the bed, crawling up to straddle his lap.
"Only a bit, but I got the gist. I'll take the little one up early, and you two can have a ladies' night," Tony teased, rolling his eyes at Peter's complaints.
"Are you sure you don't want me to push you, sweetheart?" He asked softly, watching the boy struggle to kick off, "I don't think your feetsies can reach the ground, bubba."
"Wasn't deep. Might itch, but not more than that," Tony mumbled, following after Steve regardless, "I'm sorry...”
"Kay," Tony murmured, pulling the blankets up around themselves before settling down, easily falling asleep.
"That’s gonna hurt tomorrow." Steve sighed, leaning up to gently kiss the welt. "Hopefully, our vacation will go better without any other mishaps."
"Alright, whenever you wanna go, then." Tony returned his attention to his tablet, typing away furiously at his code.
, and you didn't even look gross then. I think you're okay." He chuckled, sighing happily. "So you've had the rings for years, and it somehow managed to fit my finger perfectly?" He asked curiously. "And since you asked me, does that make me the 'bride'?"
"Hello there." Steve sighed gently. "Glad you're back. Things were starting to get a bit rough with Peter there." He whispered, resting his head against Tony's.
"Grown-ups can't get kid's sicks," Tony made up, flicking his eyes to Steve, "We're safe from your germs, babe."
Tony frowned at that, pretending to not silently agree with Steve. He held in a sigh, waving his hand.
"I'm still going to feel bad because I helped cause you to have to get stitches." Steve sighed softly. "Then you passed out, and-- hell, you scared me to death, Tony."
"Well, after this is sorted out and you feel a little better, then we can do that. And you'll be my big boy." He hummed, yawning softly. "But right now, it’s late."
"I actually have glasses," he admitted, "I wear them when I get super sick, though. I prefer contacts, but I mean--" He shrugged, winking at Steve. "Depends on how often I'll be seeing you in my office."
Sammy gathered bubbles in his little hands, squealing happily as he splashed around. He reached up for Steve, whimpering turning to bawling when he wasn't picked up right away.
"Y'did a nice paint job, Stevie. I like the spiders," Bucky laughed, putting the boxes gently on the floor, "He's gonna be the talk of the playground with all this stuff. Speaking of stuff, Nat and I got him a few things to hang up."
Tony hummed softly, yawning before settling down into Steve. He gave the blond on last kiss before closing his eyes, easily falling asleep. Steve closed his eyes to rest them, taking in all of the man that was in his arms. He soon fell asleep, feeling that everything now would end up all right.
, PA. As my personal assistant, you could technically suck me off while I work at my desk," Tony drawled, tapping his fingers on Steve's chest with a smirk.
"Yeah, yeah it is." Steve said with a soft smile, glancing down at a snoozing Peter and dropping his voice to a whisper. "Even more so with another one. I really can't wait, but I feel bad for making Peter think we'd be replacing him, you know?"
"I gotta sign papers tomorrow. Today. Later today," he mumbled, "I think--I think if I keep myself busy, I'll be okay till the funeral."
"Is uh, is this what fertilizes your eggs?" He asked carefully, earning a sputter from the brunet above him.
"It's Christmas," Tony shrugged, passing over the bottle of red for Clint to pour, "Only half glasses, Birdbrain. There's more if people want more."
He grinned up at Steve, making kissy noises up at him. Steve made noises back, heading up to their room and settling Tony in their bed gently and joining him under the covers. He pulled Tony comfortably on top of him nuzzling his cheek.
"Keep me fed and hydrated," Tony laughed, absentmindedly pushing his glasses up his nose, "Sound good?"
When Tony woke next, the bed was cool. He frowned at the lack of a warm body, but quickly retracted his thoughts when he heard tiny feet pattering down the hall.
He carried Sammy down with him outside of the workshop, Peter following behind. He knocked on the door and called gently.
"I think that the tables have turned." Steve grinned, looking to Peter. "That seems like something I normally do to you and Daddy, huh Petey?"
"Hush," Tony rolled his eyes, going over to take Peter into his arms, "She calls all her friends 'sweetie', Peter."
"You really don't have to thank me for anything, Steve. Really." Tony said carefully, finishing off his plate with a contented hum. "Having your company is honestly all I could ask of you. Its... Its nice to have someone staying here on a regular basis that I don't have to expect they'll leave the morning after they've stayed the night. Nice to have a bo-- a
He winked and stepped back to tend to Sammy, crouching down to kiss his chubby cheek. Sammy squeaked happily at the kiss on his cheek while Steve's cheeks gained a slight pink dusting.
"I don't mind being pretty for you, baby." Steve hummed, getting off the bed to dress up in the lace. "I just like knowing you would take the time to be slow with me if I ask." He smiled softly.
"I have cigar burns on my thighs, Steve," he mumbled, jumping off the counter to wrap his arms around him, "Trust me, you'd have to really wail on me to hurt me. And even then--"
He took a Transformer bandage out of the box, putting it on one of Tony's scars and kissing it gently. "T'help it get better."
"Yep," Tony hummed, sitting down in Steve's lap, "They aren't giving you trouble, are they?" "Nuh-uh!" Peter replied haughtily, "M'bein' perfect."
"You're a sap," Tony laughed, crawling in after Steve and snuggling up to him, "A warm sap, but a sap nonetheless. My sap."
"Oh, and what a sight I am met with," he hummed appreciatively, eyeing the edible underwear with a small laugh. "I can never take those things seriously. They're just so funny to me, I swear."
"Love you too, Munchkin. You're such a good boy." He hummed fondly with a smile. "Wanna help me make some PB&Js?".
"Y-yeah, yessir," Tony gasped, scrabbling at the desk for purchase, "Love your huge cock in me, love you tearing my ass apart--" He moaned loudly, pressing his face into the cool wood while trying to keep his pleasure under control.
"Fine then. We will." Steve harrumphed playfully, taking Sammy and heading to the kitchen. "C'mon, Samwich. We're gonna have fun in the bath and get you smelling sweet."
"It's not algebra, its middle school math," Tony laughed, coming over to peek at Peter's work, "We're just calling it algebra, Papa."
Nine months sounded like a long time, but honestly they flew by like it was nothing. Now, on a nice afternoon in October, just a few days after Peter's 7th birthday, their phone was ringing to tell them the wait was over.
He let everyone snuggle up around them, feeling a bit strange since he barely knew the people, but that soon subsided. It was all there as a comfort. Tony fell asleep amidst their combined warmth; when he woke, he had been moved back to his bed with just Steve, exhaustion clear on the elder’s face.
Tony nodded, padding out to his bedroom, slipping on new boxers and winter PJs, and toweled off his hair before trotting back over to Steve.
Luckily, Steve's people were in a time of peace. This meant he had his own means of a vacation for a while. This made it much easier to go and visit Tony without too many questions and him getting in trouble.
Tony helped Peter scoot over to Steve could climb in, smiling as the boy tucked himself into Steve's warmth. Pete sniffled softly and whimpered, letting Steve comfort him.
"M'glad, 'cause I'll always be brilliant. And charming. And loving," Tony teased, smiling softly at Steve, "God, I'm so head over heels for you. I feel like a teenager."
"Why not? Does it embarrass you? Then I think I'll say that as often as I can." He teased, mouthing at Tony's collarbone.
"Hey Bruce." Steve said, almost hesitantly. He could feel a light blush start to creep onto his face. "Um, is Tony around? I need to talk to him about something.".
Steve dropped Peter off without a problem, thanking Bucky and Nat for taking him for the night. He didn't go into details, but the both of them understood. He kissed Peter's cheek goodbye and headed back home.
"Long story short," Tony continued, "its a mechanical replacement voice box. Chalk it up for the 'Little Mermaid Loophole'." The man grinned triumphantly.
"That's actually a really good makeup effect. You one of those 'professional mermaids' who do underwater photoshoots and stuff?" The man asked curiously, only to be met with confusion from those beautiful baby blues.
He reached down to gently run his hand over the front of Steve's trousers, fondling him through the material. Steve's face started to redden, staring at Tony in surprise.
"Don't tease me like that, Steven. You know how I feel about kids." Tony sighed and settled down, giving Steve one last kiss before falling asleep, tightly curled up to his husband.
"I don't like seeing him upset either, but we have to follow through with the punishment. He has to learn." Steve whispered back, stroking Peter's hair.
"It’s okay, Samwich. Bubba is just excited" Steve soothed. "But yeah, a picnic at the park sounds good. And we'll get to use the stroller we've only used like once."
"Hey, he was just as fond over you, little one, no noises," Tony tsked, hefting Peter up on his hip as he rang the bell.
"...Maybe. Don't touch," Tony immediately got Peter away, scooting the boots back to collapse into their container, "It's not exactly.... calibrated yet."
"Yes, honey, you're my sexy superman," Tony laughed softly, smooching Steve's lips, "C'mon. We need to sleep before we get woken up by shark jammies at three AM."
Peter blinked and nodded, still too young to quite understand. He gave Steve a smile and leaned up to kiss his cheek, drawing him into a hug.
"H-he's gonna ask about those," Tony moaned, lifting his hips up to give Steve a better angle, "Oh god, Steve, please--"
"I agree. I really don't want to have to punish him, but what else can we do?" Steve asked carefully, eating at his soup. "I don't want to resort to spanking if we don't have to. Just want to put that out there."
"I have no doubts of that. I'm not too great at jokes as quickly as you." Steve hummed, looking down at Tony's reaction as he worked. "God, you are beautiful..." He murmured out softly.
"This is moving just fine for me, Tony." He said back softly, brushing over Tony's bangs. "This is perfect for me. I promise."
'Ms. Potts? Is she a friend of yours?' Steve asked curiously, turning towards the door as the sound of heels clacking against the floor drew louder until a woman with strawberry-blonde hair arrived in the doorway.
Tony blinked. "Kid--you mean the world to me," he replied softly, "You're not some fling and fuck, if that's what you're thinkin'. I want to keep you around, if you'll let me."
was left in Steve's mind as he ushered Tony into the room and sat on the bed. Tony was silent for a while as they sat, and Steve noticed little by little that the man was slowly breaking as he tried to think of what to say.
Steve hummed in response, still remembering the bruises. He really shouldn't let them bother him-- Tony said he liked those kind of bruises-- but it just made Steve feel a bit bad for doing it. He saw it as hurting the other and didn't really want to hurt Tony. Foregoing the thoughts for now, Steve slipped under the blankets with his fiancé and curled up around the man gently. He nuzzled close, taking in every bit of Tony he could as he drifted to sleep.
"I take responsibility and do not regret it. But I think Peter shall help complete the transformation." Steve joked, playing with Peter's hair. "We are wrapped around his little fingers."
"It wasn't a bad move. Besides, I think it would be hard to forget you. Especially with a confession like that. You ramble and its adorable, honestly." He laughed.
He slid down to the ground, taking a deep breath while counting in his head, feeling a bit exhausted from how fast his emotions were swinging him. Tony spent his last bout of strength to crawl up onto the bed, keeping himself warm in Steve's hoodie.
"I do though, baby," Tony smiled weakly, pushing Peter's wet bangs to the side, "I know exactly how many times I've messed up, too. But I try not to think of it, 'cause every one of them has helped me as much as it hurt me."
"Nice try, but I think that movie is a little too mature for you." Steve hummed back, raising a brow. "We need to see what Daddy thinks."
"Peter, we know you want to know, but it’s something you really aren't mature enough to know about yet." Steve said with an empathetic look. "And you won't be until you are at least twelve, and even then that is pushing it, sweetie."
"Prime rib, maybe. That sounds good for dinner tomorrow. I'll go grocery shop," Tony rattled off, leaning into Steve's touch, "My god, I'm turning into my mother."
"It's dumb and won't get discussed for a couple years," Tony complained, stretching his words out, "Don't look at me like that, sap."
"Jerk." Steve pouted, moving around on the bed a bit with a groan. He needed something, dammit. Steve moved to run his hand down along his cock for some friction, getting his hand smacked away.
"I know you've been through so many bad things and can remember them, and I wish I could take it all away." Steve pleaded, holding both Peter and Tony close. "But maybe when those memories try to resurface, you could think of the good memories you have with us? That's what is happening now. What happened then can't be changed, no matter what. And ending everything is definitely gonna make it worse for you, baby. You'd regret so much and never have peace that way."
"We'll get there. We'll have to decide if we want a ceremony and all that, or just a court order, thankfully New York passed that marriage law a couple years ago so we don't have to go out of state--" Tony hummed, running figures through his head.
"Well, I can't help that you have a great ass." Steve explained, shivering as cool air hit him below. His hips moved up a bit in a twitch of want, Tony always knowing how to push his buttons.
They didn't leave him. The nightmares only got worse. It was the same one, reoccurring every other night and increasing in sense of terror. Every time he awoke from the nightmare he would have a slight panic attack, and every time the real  Steve would come in to comfort him. After Tony would settle down, Steve would hesitantly leave him to his own devices, just like Tony had asked. Tony thought that would help, but it only made things worse on him.
"Its only because I'm a terrible liar, so I figure its just better to be open and honest with people instead of getting caught up in a lie. And you seem pretty open when you're talking with me.".
"Yes I am, if you want to learn?" Steve said with a smile, joining the others on the floor. "We can start with something you would like to learn to draw."
"Maybe so, but it helps you practice and learn. Which is what Daddy's homework is going to help him do. Hopefully." He explained.
"This place really is wonderful. It’s perfect, really. I never thought I would even get to look at a place like this to potentially live in." He replied with a content grin.
"It’s only because I tried to keep in shape for so long. I've slowed down a little bit." He admitted softly.
"Y'hungry, huh?" Steve chuckled, wiping the paint from his face. "Then we better get started on that pizza, huh? You can help me put the toppings on." He offered, scooping up the boy in his arms and heading them down to the kitchen.
"I said actual penguins. I would hope it would be alive." Steve said carefully, raising a brow at Tony slightly.
As he swam the direction he remembered, he spotting something sinking in the water once more. Upon closer look, it was another human.
Sammy fussed softly in Tony's arms, reaching up and grabbing at Tony's beard. He smacked at Tony's chin with a little giggle.
Tony silently scooted a little bit away from Steve, still keeping a hand on Peter's leg; he could only sit for so long before getting up, pressing a kiss to both of their cheeks.
"I know, bubba. I know." He answered, heart hurting a little at how pitiful Peter looked. Steve petted the boy's hair softly, kissing his forehead. "I'll get you some saltines in a minute so you can have something in your stomach, okay? And they should help your tummy a little, too."
"You keep makin' me feel good, and you'll get me all smoochy like this." He giggled, leaning into the petting. "I like when you get smoochy, too. Makes me happy you're happy."
Tony gasped, face flushing more as he rolled his hips back, happily making noises into his pillow. "Feels good," he mumbled, "Y'real big, Stevie, fillin' me up--"
"We'll get there, love. Wanna make sure you end up a good kind of sore." He purred, slipping in a third finger and then a fourth, stretching Tony and making sure his fingertips began to brush his sweet spot.
Steve followed behind carefully to the bedroom, looking to Tony gently. "Alright... Will you be okay, though? I didn't want to get you feeling upset, Tony." He explained
Tony arched his back and whined loudly, fisting a hand in Steve's hair; usually he could last much longer, but being slightly asleep, he couldn't hold back his orgasm, breathy moans filling the room. Steve took down everything Tony gave, licking him clean before slipping him back in his pants. He slinked back up to Tony's side, snuggling up to him sweetly.
"Mmm, maybe, but now that you can read my thoughts through the bond, it gets a little tricky." He admitted with a playful grin.
"I certainly don't regret making you a sap." Steve whispered, kissing lightly at the pad of Tony's thumb as it ran over his lips. "If it means you plan out amazing things like this. It'll be hard to beat for our actual anniversary."
"Gravity...increasing. Getting...squished!" He groaned, unable to sit up. "Gah, you are just too strong today, Petey. You've got me squished."
He crossed his leg over his thigh, hungrily raking his eyes over Steve. Steve glanced at him again with a small smirk, the look in Tony's eyes not going unnoticed.
"Yes. Quietly and carefully. We don't want our 'arguing' to wake him up and I'll need to walk tomorrow when I take him to the aquarium." He murmured, tugging Tony towards him.
"Okay then. You and I will watch a movie together after dinner. Whichever one you want to watch, just you and me." Steve smiled, petting softly at Peter's hair.
“Such a drama queen. Just like his trainer,” Tony said with a smirk, earning a pout and an incredulous ‘Hey’ from Steve in response.
"We'll get there. If you get comfortable enough, you will be able to," Tony murmured with a smirk, "But I dunno when that'll be."
"Yeah. All his energy got taken out on the swings," Tony laughed softly, tucking Peter closer to his chest, "We should probably get them home, it's about Sammy's naptime anyway, yeah?"
"It's nearly eight, peaches. Best get you home, fed, bathed and into bed so tomorrow can come faster," Tony hummed, "Sound good?"
"We are actually going to go to visit his parents sometime. Mostly so I can meet his mother. And I'll have to make sure that both Tony and I don't beat the shit out of Howard. So, that'll be something." He said, tightening his lips.
"Fuck, Steve," Tony grunted, arms shaking as he picked up his pace, "Y'gonna make me come from the noises comin' from y'pretty little mouth."
"Awe, Papa's just teasin' you, sweetheart," Tony laughed, keeping his arms around the boy as he carried him to the downstairs bathroom, "Let's get you all washed up for dinner, okay?"
"Fire...?" The brunet said softly as he made it to the kitchen and stopped in his tracks, the sight in front of him a lot less terrifying than he thought the situation would be.
"Mmm. Yeah, maybe," Tony laughed, relaxing back into Steve's arms, "He's a brilliant tyke. Probably smarter than me, and that's saying a lot."
Tony whined softly and spread his legs more, gasping when Steve thrust into his sweet spot. "God, please Stevie, right there," he moaned, scrabbling at the table for purchase.
Oh my god," Tony wheezed, running over to pick up the box, "They're--oh my god, Stevie, they're edible underwear--" He grinned, dissolving into giggles.
birthday sex?" Tony asked hopefully, scooting closer to Steve, "I don't have anything I really wanna do today--"
"C'mon Pete, let's go play in your room, okay?" Tony murmured, taking the boy's hand with a gentle squeeze.
That night, Tony slept with ease. No nightmares or panic attacks to wake him. There was only he and Steve, radiating a  comforting warmth...
The blond nodded, leaning in for a quick kiss before leaning to dig for the lube in the nightstand. Displaying his spoils with a smirk, Steve set out to slick up his fingers.  He dragged his fingers gently along Tony's inner thigh before poking them gently at the man's entrance.
He turned a gentle smile to Steve, leaning over to press a light kiss to his lips. Steve hummed, kissing back happily.
from ours for him. Bunk without a bottom, get a desk and maybe a little baby computer? Stuff it with toys and I can build him a hammock to put his favorite pillows in."
Leaning into his touch, Tony whined softly when Steve pulled away, pouting into his juice. He sipped at it till it was gone, putting the glass in the dishwasher.
"That's my good boy," Tony praised, hugging him tightly, "Take care of Samwich, and I'll see you tomorrow morning, okay?"
"Right. Captain Innocent here," Tony laughed, kissing Steve's cheek, "All the more for me, then. I've got a few other things we can try, but I don't know how you'll take to them."
"Then control it and be harder," Tony growled, backing them up so he fell on the bed, "Please? I'll beg for it, if you want me to."
"This is the waiver, disclaimer, big official packet that you need to sign. There's a few initialing spots at the end, and a final signature on the last page," She explained, motioning to the sticky note tabs, "Once you sign, the papers will be shipped tonight, and should be approved within the week. You'll receive the confirmation from the federal government via snail mail, and the process will begin."
"That there is dedication." Steve chuckled softly with a smirk. "I don't think I could physically get myself to stay in bed like that." He admitted.
"They could be. Or going to straighten something up." Steve said carefully, watching the woman. "Either way, she's braver than me to do that without a cage or anything."
"S'rry." Steve hummed, leaning up with sleepy eyes and looking at Tony. "You're just s'comfy--" he hummed, choosing to cuddle into Tony's side instead.
"Well, the talk about a baby and me apparently getting bigger have nothing to do with each other, Peter." He explained gently. "I can't have a baby. Boys can't do that."
"Hm, I think he's giggling because we were smooching." Steve smirked, swooping in and smooching at Peter's cheeks playfully. The boy shrieked in giggles, wiggling under the kisses.
"Hey buddy! You're starting to get your first tooth there," Tony exclaimed, barely able to see the little shard of white poking up through Sammy's gum, "Already sharp.... Great. Don't eat the furniture."
"All right, before anything you end up eating starts to taste like liquor, I say we get out the cake." Steve said with a grin, moving towards one of the cabinets and reaching to pull out a large cake in a cake pan from the very top shelf.
"I have a baby care book if you want to read it," Tony teased, laughing when the boy nodded, "Really?"
"So bossy." Steve smirked back, following behind Tony up towards the apartment. "Remember what I said about patience?"
, Rogers," Tony scoffed, adjusting his deerstalker before entering the building. He smirked at the gorgeous ginger nurse in the lobby, reaching out to take her gloved hand and kiss her wrist.
Tony grinned and bumped his hip against Steve's before starting to arrange the presents around the tree.
Once they were done with the kitchen, they went about tidying up the living room and guest rooms, eventually putting the last of their clothes in the closet.
"Fuck, Steve, that's not what I meant," Tony muttered, immediately lacing his hand with Steve's, "I'm not letting you go anywhere, that's for damn sure. I meant... I can't help but think about what Peter's teacher had said. What if soulmates really are dying out, and our tattoos don't symbolize a bond? What if we just got so damn lucky to land someone perfect?"
"Yessir!" Peter said happily, smooching Tony's cheek back in response before the man was too high up. "I'll be good, I promise."
"I know you don't, sweetheart, but you have to trust our judgement," Tony tried, shoulders slumping as the boy continued to cry.
"We'll take you up on that offer, Stark." Natasha smirked, giving Tony a quick hug. "Be good, kid. You hear me?" She warned playfully. "Good to meet you, Steve. Take care of this one."
He made no sound as his eyes darted over the clearly bloodless body, thumbing at the even slice from the middle of the man's collarbones down to a few inches above his groin. Tony flicked his eyes over to the arms, noting the limb attached by a few tendons. It looked to be sliced through, but not quite enough to completely sever the limb.
"You'll get it, baby boy. Don't cry. You are doing so good." Steve cooed gently. "He's tried so much in one day more than he ever has." He hummed softly.
"Thank you." He whispered gently. "I love you. I'm glad you put up with an old fart like me." He chuckled.
"Aw, that's sweet Peter. Sammy just wanted kissies cuz he loves you." Steve grinned, sitting down next to all his boys.
"I think I like the walk on you a little better." He laughed, turning the water on for them. "Didn't mean to hurt you, though."
The merman stay silent for the moment in thought. He and Tony were off to a great start, and three months had to be enough to be able to find something to keep him tethered to the land.
"I'm gonna take you, that's for sure," Tony muttered, digging his fingers into Steve's ass, pulling him closer for a better angle, "You're so perfect, so fucking
He buckled Sammy into the back with Peter, giving Steve a quick kiss before skipping over to the other car, quickly roaring off for home. Steve sighed softly at Tony's speed, shaking his fondly as he got into the driver's seat. Sammy was still awake and babbled over at Peter, reaching tiny hands over at his brother.
"Well I love it. So don't stop it." Steve chuckled, leaning more into the touch, almost like an animal wanting petted. "Moments like this, all nice and quiet but not all awkward are moments I love having with you." He whispered sweetly.
"Love you, Daddy." Peter said softly, leaning in the touch. "Love you too, Papa." He added gently, looking up at Steve.
"Its a reaction of the male body to sexual arousal." Tony said simply, eyes softening their gaze over Steve from how unsure the other was. "In easier terms, its how our bodies react in the urge to wanting to breed, essentially. And yeah, it does happen to me too, Steve. You're not alone, I promise. Now up on the bed and lay back, get comfortable, and I'll help you."
Steve leaned up in the bed concerned, about to get up and ready if he needed. "What happened, is Peter all right?"
"Okay, pumpkin. We'll have to change your band-aids, too," Tony murmured, setting the boy on his feet before turning the tap on.
Steve was quiet for a long while before he finally broke a bit, breath shaky as he fell into a seat on the couch.
"If he still feels bad tomorrow, I'm taking him to the doctor." Steve sighed softly. "I have a feeling we are in for a long night with him. I hate seeing him so sick and miserable..."
"It's a-- well, good question," Tony laughed, carefully putting Peter's clothes in the sink, "It's a steady stream of water that cleans you off."
"Hey," he replied nervously, "I'm a little stuck, but--" One of the boots came loose and sent Tony crashing to the floor, landing on the concrete with a thump. "--Ow. I'm okay."
like anything's concussed or broken," Tony sighed, trying to stretch his back, "I'm probably bruised as all hell though--"
He took up residence on his favorite spot on the couch, grabbing the blanket off the back and wrapping it around himself. Tony glanced over with a fond smile, secretly pulling out his phone to snap a few pictures before returning to his work.
"You didn't do nothing, munchkin." Steve let Peter know. "Babies are just fussy real easy. He's just hungry. Plus he's still getting used to being in the outside world."
"Okay. Might want to wake him up. Dinner's about done." He hummed, turning to kiss the corner of Tony's lips.
"Both. All of the above. Multiple times," Tony breathed, whining when Steve pulled back, "We've been doin' this dance for
Tony blinked and shook his head, but he laughed, doing as Peter asked. The boy ran off to find Steve, grinning when he found him waiting with a bow.
All of it finally clicked in the soldier's mind. The room looking like the Stork Club, date night was Saturday, the note...
"Yes you can." Steve assured, softly shushing Tony to calm him down. "It may not seem like it right now, but you
"Thoroughly fucked?" Tony laughed, reaching up to pet Steve's hair, "Alright, we'll stay out here. But lemme get something first."
Steve nodded softly, a bit surprised as he traveled downwards to the workshop. Tony had something to share this early? The blond pondered what it could be to himself as he entered Tony's domain, the brunet greeting him with an excited grin.
"Uh-huh." Peter nodded softly, leaning in Tony's touch. "When you come back, we all gonna have cuddles, right?" He asked innocently, bright brown eyes looking up at his daddy.
“Now then, you’ve checked the playroom and our room, right?” Steve asked, earning a nod in response from his boyfriend.
"...Could I sleep in here tonight, y'think? I just don't really feel like walking back to my room at the moment..."
"Nice to meet you, Steve. Next time, maybe we can chat more." Pepper said with a small hum. "Don't let Tony cause you any trouble."
Tony hesitated, but he nodded, swapping children with Steve. "Make sure you bundle up," He murmured, bouncing Sammy on his hip.
"Your turn to top." He answered.  Steve leaned in to kiss at Tony's neck, nipping gently on his collarbone. "Please?"
"Mhmm, whatever you say, Pete," Tony drawled, swooping Sammy up into his arms, "Just make sure you use protection when you kiss her, kiddo. Don't wanna get her pregnant."
Peter was still pouty as he grabbed Steve's hand, leaning against his warmth as the small family trotted out the door and toward the grassy knoll near the park.
Whimpering, Tony stretched his neck to give Steve more room, stuttered breaths on his lips. "Love you, Sir," He moaned, cock twitching, even without stimulation, "P-please, Sir--"
Peppered eyeballed the screen, observing the face specifically. She gave a sigh, looking at Tony carefully with a protective air about her.
What did I just hear out of your mouth?" Steve said, swooping in and grabbing Peter by the back of his pants and sitting him back down. "And you are still in time out. What has gotten into you, lately?"
"You can either talk to both of us, or you're going to stay in your room the rest of the night, young man," Tony replied, squeezing Steve's hand, "You unlock this door right
"Sorry. I've never really been in a house this size before. Not around where I lived, anyway. It’s exciting to take all of it in." He explained. "I probably sound like a huge dork, just getting excited by a spare room..."
"Mmm, maybe, I was kidding," Tony shrugged, "But if you wanna, we can." He put his hand on the back of his neck, glancing at the floor.
Steve pouted softly, wrapping his arms around Tony's neck. "I guess if I have to wait. I really wish I could know, though." He murmured, nuzzling Tony's neck.
"He won't for long!" Steve declared once the food was in the oven and a timer was set. He playfully stomped towards Peter with monster growls, scooping him up to smooch all over the boy's face.
"Oh man, silk sheets," Steve hummed happily, taking in the smell of the incense and the faint smell of the rose petals.  "You always manage to surprise me. Your attempt to woo me was successful." He grinned, coming around to wrap arms around Tony's waist.
Steve rolled his eyes back in a playful manner as he sat down on the bed, playing along and shutting his eyes.
The blond chuckled at that. "Well, I think normal people would think that's strange, but normal isn't completely your thing, so I'm not sure what I expected. I certainly have no objections. Me wearing pretty things makes you happy, and that's all I could ask for."
"You always talked about how you wanted to learn to dance, but you never had gone out to learn. And then last week, when you told me about you and Peggy before you crashed... I know its not all the same, never would be, but I wanted to get as close as I possibly could to your date, Steve. I really did.".
"I wasn't angry at you. Just a little annoyed that you essentially told our son I was the lady. A lady in general." Steve hummed, leaning with the touch.
much bubba. So so much. Don't cry, okay? I like to see you smiling and happy. It’s okay." He soothed, kissing the side of his son's face.
"We haven't had talks like this in too long," he murmured, "It's.... hard. God, I really don't wanna get sappy and upset on you on our vacation, but--"
"It... It is getting late, too..." Steve murmured. "You guys can stay the night downstairs or in the guesthouse if you'd like? There are spare clothes there."
He pulled Steve up so he was kneeling on the bed, spreading his thighs apart. He let Steve sit back down again, sucking on his fingers before gently trailing them down to his hole.
"Probably feels funny to him," Tony grumbled, gently playing with Sammy's hands, "It's rough, compared to the softness of everything else."
Tony looked surprised. "I never told you how Pops and I met?" he asked, earning an adamant shake of a head from the boy. "Well then," he grinned "looks like story time, huh? Get comfy, squirt."
"We're gonna hope not. For Ms. Sharon's sake, especially." Steve hummed gently. "She is going to be very tired after all this."
Tony paled and his jaw dropped at his words, quickly taking Steve's fingers into his mouth. He licked and sucked them till they dripped with saliva, pulling back when his lips were slightly red. Steve looked down at Tony's reaction after that, concern now lacing his expression as he looked at the man.
"Tony, what's the matter? If the idea of going on a date bothers you that much, you can say so. It was only a suggestion." He soothed gently.
He smiled and ran the pad of his thumb over Steve's bottom lip, ghosting his fingertips over the darkening shade.
"M'head hurts n'my nose s'all stuffy," Peter mumbled miserably, dropping his head on Steve's shoulder, "M'tummy don't feel too good, eider."
"Five-- Six--" Tony couldn't help the gasp that escaped his lips, moaning into the bed. "S-seven--" he groaned, "Eight--"
Steve turned to look at Tony curiously. "I'm sure you are contemplating on the why, aren't you Stark?"
Steve smiled softly as Tony came back in, kissing his husband's cheek when he managed to wiggle back under the covers.
Steve just wanted to hold the man, wanted to be able to keep him together and whole. He slowly reached out to wrap his arms around Tony, holding and comforting him as the dark haired man lightly shuddered in his hold.
"Not yet, no. First I need details of your relationship with your brother, the scene of the crime, and
"But you don't doubt the possibility." Fury finished in a low tone. "The only ones I have ever seemed to encounter are nothing but barbarians. So I don't doubt the bulk majority of them are the same. The odds of finding a decent one are too low to risk the loss of one of my best men."
"Oh can you now?" Steve questioned playfully, setting Peter down to put the pizza in the oven. He smirked over at Tony before looking back to Peter.
He patted Steve's backside before slipping off of him, a knowing smile on his lips. Steve pouted slightly as Tony moved, rolling over on his side.
He relaxed himself under Steve's slender, soft fingers, the blond definitely being a quick learner. Must be a perk of his military mindset, however it is that it works underwater. Steve kept up a careful, even pace, even doing so much as adding a slight twist to an upstroke that just turned Tony into butter under his hand. The twist might of been an accident at first, but Steve must've caught on to the positive reaction because he continued to add that to his movements.
Steve picked one of them up at examined it, rolling it around in his hands. "Aren't these what Jockeys use on horses? Or what they started out being used for?"
Tony rolled his eyes, wrapping his arms around Steve and kissing his neck. "Of course, I've got the best stuff planned for you," he hummed, "I mean, unless you
"Uh-huh." Peter answered, looking at Steve. "Was fun to see what Daddy does." He murmured, inching slowly towards the bed.
"This will be so helpful for us. Thank you so much." He smiled softly to her, shutting the folder and keeping it in his lap lightly. "We will need it when it comes to dealing with a
He sniffled and tried to ignore the tears rolling down his face, opting to stare into his soup instead.
"Is that any way to talk to your husband?" Steve said in mock offense. "And here I was going to be nice and touch ya a little bit more." Steve stated as he stroked once slowly along Tony's cock as he continued.
Tony had set Steve up with one of his smaller t-shirts and a pair of jeans that were tight on him but still hung loosely on the blond. He even had to give him a belt to keep them up! Although a bit baggy, Steve wore it well. It was relaxed and didn't completely constrict the former merman's new legs.
"Diverge," Tony drawled, mouthing at his pipe, "Once again, you give me all the easy words, Doctor. I need something complex if I want to get anywhere in my train of thought."
"Alright, first, we need to look up materials for the costume," Tony began, drawing up a holographic screen, "Jay, bring up material types that are flexible and lightweight, but also fairly sturdy and safe."
Peter sniffled and rubbed the back of his hand over his nose, bringing out his feet from under him. "I f'got to take m'socks off," he whimpered, lips wobbling for a second before crying again.
"Yeah, I'm all full." Steve stated. "Are you? Or did you want a slice of that pie you mentioned before we head out?"
"You should know there is nothing wrong with having two daddies, Peter. And there is surely nothing wrong with being smart. Smart people go places." Steve said carefully, reaching out to wipe at Peter's tears. "What I don't get is why your teacher hasn't done anything about it."
Steve kissed Tony softly on the lips before carefully leading him to bed. "You are getting sleep before you go and get anything, though. You work yourself late a lot. It’s not healthy."
"We're all ready to bring your little brother home." Steve announced, grabbing the car keys. "I'm sure he'll be excited to see you, Peter. He took quite a liking to you already."
"The Nightmare. It must have been pretty bad to make you have an attack like that.". Steve sounded genuinely worried about it.
“Three months?!” Tony asked back incredulously “What the hell?! Why is it that anytime we actually need that asshole, he’s away for such extended periods of time? Its a load of bullshit.”
"Sammy wants to give kissies too." Steve laughed playfully. "Just give in to the kissies, Spider-Man!"
"Love you, too." Steve whispered back, wrapping around Tony again. "And I'll do anything I can for you when you need it."
"You're definitely wearing these more often," Tony mumbled, tugging at the panties, "And we're going to buy you more. And have you wear them all the time."
Steve looked at Peter with a raised brow. "You aren't worried." He noticed, seeing Peter's grin as the boy shook his head.
He waited for the child's breath to even out before turning a worried eye to Steve, brushing his hair back.
Steve leaned in and kissed Tony's cheek comfortingly. "It'll go fine, Tony. Especially if Pepper says he knows his stuff." He hummed, stepping out of the car and opening the door on Tony's side. Steve offered a hand for Tony to take, offering a gentle look.
for a couple days. And it looks so pretty on you." the engineer preened, leaning down carefully with his hips against the others. He leaned down to try and make some more marks to match-- to earn him some more soft moans from the blond beneath him-- before he stopped in his tracks.
Peter stuck out his feet, wiggling his toes at Tony playfully as the socks were slipped on. He giggled when Tony played with the toes a little. "Tickles!"
"It’s because we love each other like we do. You'll understand when you find someone of your own someday." Steve explained as they headed to Peter's room. "He's the only one ever that I've kissed like that, so its special."
"We can get you back in shape, if you think you're gaining," he hummed suggestively, nipping at Steve's neck.
Peter squealed again in a fit of giggles, wiggling in Steve's arms. "Traitors! You've both betrayed me! Daddy turned Papa into a kissy monster!!!"
"I love you two. Always remember that." He grinned before he finally leaned up. "I'm checking dinner then I'll join you both."
"OH WOW!" Peter said excitingly, looking around and checking out the room. He looked up along the walls then immediately running over and onto the bunk bed excitedly.
"They can't be innocent forever," he murmured, "I-- I'm gonna go give him a talk, alright? You can comfort him after, if you want."
"Yeah, yeah, Sleeping Beauty. I got it..." Steve said, rolling his eyes fondly with a yawn. "Let’s go, Peter. We'll make up breakfast and Daddy his coffee."
With a wrench in his mouth, Tony slid himself on a skateboard under his newest project, blasting music in the small space; he ignored the grease dripping on his shirt, favoring to try and get the finicky motherboard out from the machine.
Steve shook his head and glanced at Peter, an idea coming to mind. He motioned for Peter to stay quiet as he carried the boy behind the breakfast bar connecting to the kitchen. Steve lifted Peter, slightly bobbing him up and down over the top as he hummed the Jaws theme in time with the movements.
"Well, I know about it now, so that promise doesn't really apply right now." Steve explained. "Either you tell me and you get that number of swats, or I just get to pick how many which is probably going to be a lot more than the times you two messed around at school."
"You have such a big heart, and you've only had it grow over these years. It makes me so proud to see that. And you deserve it all."
"Dat's stupid," Peter replied, a bored look on his face, "Why yell? Couldn' ya love eacho'da a lil quieter?"
"A nap sounds amazing right now, though." He hummed with a soft yawn. "We've earned one today. Plus I feel too thoroughly fucked to do much right now."
Steve huffed softly, playing with Tony's hair. "If that’s true, then you aren't allowed to sniffle and pout at me about it."
"They on their way?" He asked curiously, keeping Tony pressed to him. "Don't we need to go over to let them in and help them load things?"
"I'll re-sanitize the kitchen when we get home," Tony added, "And we should brush our teeth too, just in case."
"Good, baby, I want you close," Tony murmured, swiping precome off Steve's cock, "Want you so hot and heavy, baby."
"One to zero, up on the little guy," Clint murmured deeply, earning a chuckle from Tony, "It's the beefy blond's move, folks."
"Yer weird..." Steve chuckled sleepily. "Felt good though. So much for a quiet night, huh?" He hummed.
The blond stood carefully with a grunt to shut off the water. "Now let’s get dried and dressed and go get out babies."
"Mmm, fancy. I never had white wine before. We should try that." He grinned, letting his eyes rest from the pets.
"Go ahead and try. I went twenty six years without having sex. I could deal with however long you could with it." He hummed. "And what lesson would I learn?
"My first hobby, as I like t'say," Tony murmured sleepily, laying back on his hospital bed with a dopey smile.
"We've got him wrapped around your finger, kid." He joked softly. "But he does really good. He tries hard."
He yawned, slowly getting up before changing into day clothes, padding out behind Steve to the kitchen, who was searching around for ingredients and tools for omelets. Once he set things up, he got Tony's coffee started in the machine.
He closed his eyes so he could concentrate, imagining the wall he'd built around himself to slowly come down, brick by brick. A headache surged on, but Tony kept at it, forcing himself to be unmade, feeling his raw nerves be exposed.
Tony hummed deep in his throat, lazily sucking him down. He pulled back for a breath, eyes half-lidded, spit connecting his mouth to Steve's cock.
The blond flushed deeper, but nodded, climbing onto the bed and laying on his back in a way that was the most comfortable to him. His legs were bent and slightly open, gulping nervously as Tony's eyes raked over him in such a position.
Tony slipped himself off Steve and kissed his cheek, wobbling slightly as he barely made it from the desk to the bed, sighing in relief at the pillows on his back.
“We meaning you, Stark, and Dr. Banner?” Sam chimed in, earning a look from the group from his tone.
“Yup, sounds like the old days,” Bucky pointed out “He was always a cuddler, but it was always in a way to get extra body heat. His iron deficiency made him cold constantly, so as soon as your head would hit the pillow, Steve’s cuddled up against you in a ball to contain every bit of warmth he can.”
Tony put the finished papers back, grinning over at Steve. "I'm kidding, sickly," he laughed, getting up to go back over to the bed, "About the mean part."
"Mean. Five points taken from Ravenclaw." He grumbled, body still a bit sore. "Because you're being mean."
"You get so excited for the simplest things. I love it." Steve grinned, pulling out of the driveway and heading to the local ice cream shop. "I'm thinking about a cookie dough shake myself."
"You owe me a bubble bath," Tony huffed, laughing as he reached over for Sammy, playing with the baby's fingers.
He poked his head in his shared bathroom with Steve, the blond brushing his teeth to finish getting ready for bed.
Tony was quiet for a moment, unable to believe he so easily just admitted that all to Steve. Maybe because Steve had no judgement towards him like everyone else. It made him easier to talk with.
"Biggest cheeseball," he choked, letting Steve slip the ring onto his finger, "I--Steve, this is-- wow, my ring's nothing to this, I--I literally have nothing to say."
to fall asleep, but last-minute planning always wore him out. He snorted in his sleep, accidentally waking himself up, immediately hearing tiny giggles.
"Ugh, y'hands are all slobb'ry," Pete cringed, rolling his eyes at the baby's coo, "Uh huh, shore, blame Daddy."
“Yes, he might have some helpful information if his magical ass weren’t in some dimension who knows where or when.” Tony scoffed. “We tried getting ahold of him, but he’s gone for the next few months, so we are on our own.”
"I'm too old for this," Tony complained, laughing despite himself. He grinned and swooped Sammy up, placing a kiss on his shoulder.
"C'mere, buddy." Steve said consolingly, carefully hugging Peter close and petting at the boy's hair.
"Well, here's hoping the conversation ends up well. If not, I expect the biggest and fluffiest of dogs." He huffed in a chuckle. "It'd certainly be interesting. With the dog or kid."
"Hey, Tony?" He asked out quietly, flipping through a few more pages of the same subject drawn "Are we together or anything? Like a...like a couple?".
Steve kissed the top of Tony's head, hugging him close. "Love you, too. Now let's get some sleep, huh? Had long day. Need some rest, huh?"
He chewed his lip while he looked at what was at his eye level, picking up a box of Transformers bandaids.
Tony couldn't reply, too busy controlling his whines. He rocked his hips slowly before starting to move, hands on Steve's chest as he bounced up and down.
Peter squealed even louder at the raspberries in laughter, noise coming through the baby monitor from Sammy in response.
"You all right? Tired?" He smiled, noticing the yawn. "Betcha you'd fall asleep when we watch the movie."
"Actually, I'm writing code for Dummy to learn how to shake hands," he grinned, turning the screen to Steve.
"Automated butler, and more intelligent than you, Barton," Tony drawled with a raised eyebrow, "Don't be shy, Jay. Introduce yourself."
"Yeah honey, it took your brother five hours to come out," Tony sighed, "He's stubborn, just like your Papa."
"My god," Tony snorted, laughing as he turned to kiss Steve, "Fine, fine. I won't leave my Watson all aroused for naught."
Steve nodded, getting up with a small grunt to go clean himself off. He then came back over to Tony's side and got him cleaned up gently. He tossed the washcloth back into a hamper and got back into bed, snuggling into Tony sweetly.
Steve moved in on the side of Tony to dry and put away the dishes as Tony finished, smooching Tony's cheek softly.
"He's so blond," he murmured, bouncing Sammy around the room, "He almost looks bald from how blond he is."
Steve fell back softly onto the bed, looking up at Tony with a loving glint in his eyes. He slipped his hands under Tony's shirt again, trailing his fingers up and down with an inquisitive hum.
," Tony laughed, peppering Steve's face with kisses, "You're a walking Hallmark card, y'know that?" He rolled his eyes fondly, scratching at Steve's scalp. "Thank you," he mumbled, almost inaudible, "I need the reminder sometimes."
"Ngh..." He moaned, shivering from the second finger. "Tony... Gonna be too soon..." He breathed, eyes fluttering closed.
He moved the boy up to his hip and kissed his nose before trooping back over to his bedroom, not surprised to see Steve laying down with Sammy on his chest. Steve glanced over at the two with a soft smile, carefully lifting a finger to his lips in a shush motion.
He bit his lip shyly, waiting for Steve's command. Steve grinned at him, walking closer to Tony and playing with the waistband of Tony's pants.
"Seems like someone else likes your Van Dyke, too." Steve grinned with a chuckle, eyeing Sammy for a moment. "It feels nice, huh bubba bug?" He laughed.
Steve blinked, looking back at Tony confused until it clicked in his brain. His eyes then glanced down towards his Sylveon, surprise and intrigue in his expression.
Steve moved around with Tony's adjustments, finding the material actually pretty comfortable around his neck. He fiddled with it a little, messing with the clip.
Steve hummed at the feeling of the circles, revving the engine and driving them off back to the apartments.
"I'll get you a glass of juice to help pick you up, okay?" He said with a small smile, heading to the fridge.
"This sort of stuff is your clarification." Steve stated quietly. "You purposely place yourself in ways for me to pay attention to you in ways I should not. Especially when you know how I feel and you have no intentions of pursuing that endeavor."
"Well," Steve started, wringing his hands "Daddy and I were talking about maybe homeschooling you and letting you have an after school activity so you still had some kids your age to hang out with."
"Don't talk like that, baby." Steve said soothingly, shushing Tony softly. "You are so wonderful and brilliant, I honestly don't deserve
"Ah-Ah. Have'ta behave." He said, inching his finger away when Tony moved to it before slipping in two fingers right off the bat.
As Tony placed his objects that weren't clothing related into one of his suitcases, he picked up his phone and decided to check it for the first time in a week or so. He went to his messages. 34 new messages.
"Surprise? Oh my god," Tony pushed his empty plate aside, grinning at Steve, "The suspense is gonna kill me. Oh, fuck, can I guess? Hmm--"
"No... I don't like being able to see myself while we do this." Steve murmured back. "It feels weird. Makes me uncomfortable. Sorry.".
Steve hummed in response, staying still as Tony outlined him. "That would be cool. Give it a more otherworldly effect. Like how the decision of soulmates are made." He explained. Perhaps he was thinking too much into it, but that's how he saw it.
for making Peter feel like that, and then having Peter ask about his scars and he's going to have to tell him someday and he's a horrible father for doing this to himself--
"I just find him interesting, how his mind works, y'know." He explained to Natalia in a murmur. "Plus he looks fairly handsome on the off chance you catch him clean shaven and well dressed."
"You're right, I do know that. You just better hope that Fury doesn't find out about this mishap. He already wants to fillet you for today..."
Peter pouted as his hands were cleaned off, wiping his hands on his pants before sticking his thumb in his mouth.
"No, no, I'll get my phone, it's just on the table-- Coffee would be lovely, I would ask for Irish coffee, but I don't have any whiskey on me."
"I would think that you'd just...open up to me." He explained. "Slowly let your wall down. Just let it crumble, Tony."
"Bye Papa," He said sweetly, grabbing Sammy's teether ring and blanket before going over to his room.
Steve twisted the reactor and pulled it out of Tony's chest, far enough that it was only attached by its wire. Tony just stared back at Steve's grim expression, watching as the blonde held his lifeline is his hands.
"Relax, I was just picking. Your face looks like Grumpy Cat right now. But you're cuter." Steve chuckled, kissing all over Tony's face.
Tony slept late into the morning, still curled into Steve's warmth. He sighed happily, nudging Steve's chest with his nose.
"Tony..." Steve started with a sigh, forgoing the thought. He looked at Peter softly before flopping down on the bed.
Peter held his nose and closed his eyes tight as the water poured, sputtering his lips with a giggle when water fell on his face. He cracked his eyes back open when he felt hands in his hair and scrubbing. The boy reached his hand up and made an almost grabby motion to try and help scrub.
"I'm sure that I will, Tony." Steve grinned over at the man as they drove. "You wouldn't have mentioned it to me if you didn't think I would like it. Besides, I'm not too hard to please when it comes to these things."
Steve groaned softly as he took in the rest, still trying to completely adjust. "Thank goodness. Don't think I could take more right yet." He breathed, wriggling a bit more.
feel better." He laughed weakly, a sniffle escaping his throat as he looked bleakly at the faucet of the sink.
"I know, bubba bug. But we gotta go see bubby. He's a bit sick and Daddy needed to take him for help."
"Good! Gave me a great segue. Say, remember back when you got that call from Sharon in the cabin and the three of us decided we want to adopt? Well, we wanted to know if we could possibly test drive Sam--"
, was printed on his chest. When he first received it, he didn't know who would bother to call him that. At 16, he was small, skinny, and lanky. Far from what he would consider handsome. Even after his body filled out the summer of his senior year, he still never considered himself as such.
"More than ready. Been ready." Steve said excitedly. "If you guys are all ready, then let’s get the car packed and get going."
Steve nodded softly. "Yeah." He murmured. "It basically feels like it’s more routine and not special and intimate like it usually is."
Tony grunted at him, but smiled anyway, kissing him back. "You're the adorable one, babe," he chuckled, "Not me. Promise."
"Yeah, bubba. We'll let you sleep with us tonight. And we'll get you cuddled with both us and Wade." He hummed, kissing Peter's forehead.
Nodding, Tony finished looking over the packet, satisfied with the fine print. He signed his name at the appropriate areas, putting the final tick on
"That's the sand guardian, guardian of the sand. Not a shark," Tony replied with a raised eyebrow, sticking a cookie in Steve's mouth, "Now hush and put him down before he throws up all over you."
Before Steve could think about what Bruce meant by that last statement, Tony sped in with a stack of games. Steve thought Tony must be really excited about this marathon. He has been more energetic today then he has ever seen him.
"You want a day with us all to yourself, huh?" Tony hummed, gently scooping Peter up, "That can be arranged. Maybe your Aunt Pep will come and watch Sammy, and we'll go to the science museum. Sound good?"
"I'm a big boy, Daddy! Big boys don't potty deir pants." Peter explained seriously, crossing his arms. "I'll be 'tay."
"It is a natural reaction, doctor or no." He coughed from the smoke, waving it away with his hand. "It may simply be because it’s you, but lord knows why it would gauge such reaction. Now then. Nine letter word for the study of star signs?"
"Almost got it--" A young Tony hummed, just nineteen but since been out of college, working on a bot out on the sands of the beach to relax.
"Oh my god. Okay. Tomorrow, we're only talking about manly things. Enough feelings," Tony snorted, "Sports and beer. Lots of beer."
"Shhh, shhh... It’s okay, Petey. Just an accident." Steve tried to soothe, setting Peter down in the bathroom and getting rid of the boy's wet clothes. He stripped out of his damp shirt and pants as well before starting the shower water.
"Oh. Well, that’s good she found somebody so fast." Steve blinked, a bit surprised and curious on when Tony had asked Pepper since last night. "Hopefully you'll feel like it helps you a bit." He said quietly. "Thank you for asking me to come along with you."
"Thank you, baby bear," Tony hummed, smooching the boy's cheek before moving to set the table, "You were really good today, Pete. I think you've earned an extra cookie tonight, don't you?"
Peter made grabby hands up at Tony, who sighed and shifted Sammy to one hip, picking up Peter and setting him on the other.
"Pair that with that stubborn head of yours, and lord knows how much trouble you get into because of it." The brunet snickered, jostling the blond's shoulder playfully.
"He doesn't like it when ladies look at me," Tony grinned, "He thinks they'll try to-- ah, give me 'special kisses'."
"Talk to you later." Steve ended before hanging up the phone and bounding up the stairs. "Tony, Tony! We gotta talk about something!"
Steve crawled up Tony's body, straddling his hips. He knelt down and mouthed at the juncture of Tony's neck and shoulder, biting lightly and sucking hard to form dark marks.
," Tony breathed again, happily returning Steve's kisses, "We get to have story time again, and teach him or her to read and write and walk and
"Yeah. We'll have to really wash the sheets," Tony snickered, "But yeah. We'll leave the not-nursery-yet open, and put those in the other two guest rooms. The guest house comes fully furnished, so we don't have to worry about that. I'll put all my lab stuff in the basement, and we can hang your artwork up,
"Yeah, let's get the place all cleaned up and ready and I'll have Mama come over," Tony hummed, kissing Steve's chest.
Once his hair was all styled and revealed to him in the mirror, he was met with several noises of admiration; From Tatianna, Tony, and a returning Raavi, respectively.
"You'd want a whole army of kids if you could have them, wouldn't you?" Tony murmured, gently scratching at the base of Steve's neck, "Hopefully, we'll have heard back from the surrogate when we get back from the cabin."
The blond nodded, heading up the stairs and looking around for the boy. He spotted a small mass out of the corner of his eye, pretending not to see the boy and waiting for his moment to strike. Peter scooted farther into the shadows, relief flooding in his chest when he thought Steve hadn't seen him. He started to crawl away, trying to get back to his room.
He started to hand over his sketch pad, but the brunette stopped him and gestured to the seat next to himself.
"Oh, don't sound so sad, pet. You'll be able to see me, don't worry," Tony soothed, grabbing the bottle of lube from the nightstand.
off the ground right now," Tony growled, slipping in a second finger, "And you're so pretty all begging for it and all."
"Glad you like it." Steve called back as he went to get Sammy a bottle. "As for how we met, it’s an unlikely story."
"Love you too, octopus," Tony chuckled, snuggling up to Steve's chest, "Dunno how you put up with all my shit, but I'm glad for it."
"Maybe. But we'll love him all the same," Tony chuckled, waiting for Steve to lay Sammy down before going over to envelop himself in Steve's arms.
After not getting a response from the red-headed Russian, Tony deleted all the messages incase Steve wanted to snoop, grabbed his wallet and keys and headed upstairs.
"You're very welcome, lil man," Tony hummed, scooping the boy up, "Tonight we can work on moving your clothes and toys over here, if you want. So you can spend your first night in your new room. How does that sound?"
"If tha's the 'sponse I'm gettin', I'm a fuckin' whore," He muttered under his breath, a tint on his cheeks, "Remin' me-- to talk 'bout that later--"
"Dance--" Tony gave him a look, eyes widening slightly. "Really? Oh my god, well, okay-- you lead? You're taller." He pulled Steve closer to the musician, fitting a hand on his shoulder, other comfortable in Steve's hand.
"Considering what I'm gettin’ him for Christmas, kid's gonna be over the moon," Tony chuckled, still petting Peter, "I spoil him so bad, good Lord."
"Ah--" Steve jolted a bit from the cold, a shiver running up his back. "Yeah, that’s cold. Really cold." He confirmed, trying to adjust. "Okay. You're good. It’s good."
The blond stared back dazed, face burning from the attentions. He moved slightly underneath Tony, leaning up only just, almost ghosting his lips against the other's.
"They're making bread," Tony replied, eyeing the bakers through the glass, "One of my favorite things to do as a kid was grab another kid and go watch this ancient man bake bread for
"It’s all set in motion! We'll have a baby before we know it." He said happily. "Now let’s go home to our current baby. I miss him."
"Yessir, very bad, so bad," Tony breathed, not moving from his kneeling position on the floor, "I couldn't--I couldn't help myself Sir, I just needed to touch myself so
"I'm sorry. I never meant that like that, hon." Steve answered when Tony came back. "I don't ever want you to feel like you are forced or pressured to have sex with me at specific times."
"I didn't say you did, but it'd be best to get it out of the way now, right?" Tony pointed out, standing up to trail after the boy, "I gotta change the sheets on your bed anyway, so we'll stuff you into new pajamas. Sound good?"
Peter bobbed his head in agreement, sneaking a glance at his Papa before reaching for another donut. Steve snatched the treat away, splitting it in half and taking one half before handing the other back to Peter.
Sammy looked at Tony curiously as he chewed, noising softly as he waited for his formula. He smacked gently at his highchair table in wait, almost as if impatiently.
"Yep," Tony sighed, chuckling as he shifted Peter on his chest, "We should get you washed up too, kiddo. Let's go, c'mon, up to your bathroom--"
He set the boy down on his step stool, stepping back to let Peter wash his hands. The boy washed up like he was taught, giving a small hum before looking up at Tony.
"You still had dinner cooking even though it’s after midnight?" Steve asked curiously, getting out of bed slowly and wrapping a blanket around his shoulders.
"You can do it, Steve, Buck can help you, and you'll have the company for finances," he rasped, "Pepper can help you find someone--"
"I love you," Tony breathed, arching his back slightly to give Steve a better angle, "Love you so much." He moaned softly, already feeling the heat buildup in his stomach.
He couldn't reply, but Tony hummed high in his throat in agreement, feeling his panties tighten at the noises Steve was making. He pulled back to take a breath, licking the slit before reaching up to cup his balls, slipping a finger over his entrance.
"Well, that'll be a problem. As of right now, you're everything I want!" He said with his signature Stark smirk.
Steve sat on the bed in silence until he heard the front door shut. That’s when he laid down in bed, choking back silent sobs.
Steve smirked at him softly, sighing and relaxing into the tub. "Glad you think so. And you should wear those glasses more often. You wear them
"I already associate that with sex," he replied, mind whirring a mile a minute, "I just--want it to not be about that."
Steve sat up, looking to Tony attentively as he waited for the explanation. "Spill the beans, grumble puss." He teased softly.
"I can't help it. He reminds me of his father," Tony hummed leaning up to peck Steve on the cheek, "Or maybe I'm just a sap."
"Yes dear." Steve rolled his eyes fondly, going to start up the fireplace before joining his family in a cuddle pile on the bed.
"I was thinking something like one of these would look good on him, don't you think?" The brunet offered warmly. "I personally like this one, but what do you think, Steve? Any of these tickle your fancy?"
"M'sorry, I'm bad, I know, I'm sorry," Tony mumbled weakly, tucking his arm back into the blanket, "I'm horrible, I know, m'sorry--"
"What're you two grinnin' about?" Steve asked playfully, raising a brow. "That usually means you're up to somethin'."
"...I don't even know what those are." Steve shrugged. "But you apparently do, if your reaction was anything to go by."
"Such a naughty boy, Steve," Tony murmured, scissoring him open, "Fuckin' your boyfriend here--" He slipped a third finger in, leaning down to bite on Steve's hip.
"He's doing much better, and he's down to 99.0," She informed them, smiling as Tony signed the discharge papers, "He needs some sleep, and he should be better by the morning."
"Yer not gonna tease me too much, are ya?" He asked with a husk to his voice. "Really don't wanna be teased, hon."
"Sometimes I have good reason to worry, though." Steve said with a sigh, mixing up the batter. "Your dad gets hurt a lot without even trying, to be honest."
"You miss it, Rogers. You miss it and leave myself and several important neighboring tribe officals to sit here without so much as a clue when you are going to show up." Fury said cooly, his obsidian tail however twitching in clear irritation. "I know you're young and need your own time now and again, but you have never been one to bail on something important business-wise."
"Okay, Peter. We are gonna get you a cookie, brush your teeth and get you ready for bed, okay?" Steve said quickly, petting Peter's hair and shooting a look at Bucky and Clint. "It'll be past your bedtime soon."
"I'm not betting against that, because you're probably right." Steve grinned, hearing Peter traipse down the stairs.
With a happy sigh, Tony stroked Steve's hair till the blond fell asleep. He smiled and curled up as tightly as he could, easily drifting off to a light snooze.
"If you's talkin' 'bouts yellin, I already know 'bout that," Peter scoffed. He paused and his face flushed, wishing he could suck the words back into his mouth.
Tony moaned, loud and unashamed as he rocked back onto Steve's fingers, cock throbbing from the arousal pounding through him.
"Okay Sammy, bubby's going to feed you breakfast today, okay?" He informed the baby before turning to Peter. "Hold him carefully and don't tilt his bottle too much."
He grinned softly right after. "We are going to definitely need it sometimes when we have the baby."
Peter's eyes momentarily flicked over to the couch, and he offered another quiet apology, picking up another piece of paper to continue drawing.
He grinned at Steve's snort, hopping out of the car to go over to Steve's side. He held the door open, shutting it once his husband's hand was tucked into his own.
"He is very focused on his job." Steve chuckled, admiring Peter's work. "Looks good, Pete. Might come back for a sleeve."
"Evening, sleepy gills. Get you a power nap?" He asked quietly, Steve nodding in response. "Good, you looked pooped after we got you from the beach. You hungry?"
"They're gonna be okay. Peter will be an angel. It'll all be fine." Steve said to himself in assurance as they got in the car. They had never both been away from Peter in so long, but he had to trust the others.
Steve tensed for a moment, his chest panging at the thought of his dearest friend. Bucky had gone to investigate a human interaction off the coast, a short swim away, then return. It had been almost a year now, and he has never returned.
"Most of it is planned more for this evening, but I figured we could head out to the city for a bit today, do things you want to do." Steve explained with a hum, sitting next to Tony happily. "And I can give you your surprise later tonight--".
"Oh yeah, so strong. Definitely. I can lift a whole child by myself," Tony drawled, rolling his eyes, "You and I both know you're the insanely strong one here."
"No need to. I feel it." Johan said with a wicked smirked. "You've been visiting with a human, naughty boy. And now you wish to join him on the surface. You tell yourself it is only to explore, but there is another reason growing inside you, isn't there?"
"Now that's not true, and everyone make mistakes, lil 'un," Tony murmured, letting Steve take Sammy so he could rock Peter, "Everything's okay."
"Well, we'll try to keep it from doing that. Still have to clean it." He answered back carefully, quiet filling the car again for the moment.
"Is it kid friendly? Judging by the look on your face, it’s not kid friendly," Tony drawled, eventually stepping out of his clothes again to join Steve in the shower.
"No you are not. You are not bad or horrible. Just troubled." Steve explained, holding Tony to him. "You are good and smart and precious and loved, along with so much more. But never horrible."
"Good their food is filling, then." Steve said carefully, squeezing Tony's hand back as they entered.
“He was so cute when we got him. He's still cute, but we fell in love with him that instant, admit it." Steve hummed, nuzzling Tony back from the kiss. "He's definitely changed us, for sure."
"Good," He whispered, nipping down Steve's thigh, "You get a much better angle this way, baby. Trust me."
He put the correct size clothes on himself before sitting on the floor to help Peter step into his undies.
"Somewhere in the middle." Steve replied softly, leaning with the touch which felt better. "Just stung a bit."
"Nope. Not yet." Tony smirked, tapping Steve's chin away from his leg. "If you behave today, I'll show you. But you have to be on best behavior," He teased, ruffling Steve's hair.
"I want you to make love to me. Want you in me, taking your own pace." Steve breathed up at Tony. "Tease, play, whatever you'd like in between, but make love to me."
"Oh my god, you know how funny that would be?” Tony snickered, laughter soon turning to a blush across his face, "...Damn, I might have an exhibitionism thing. Or is it voyeurism? Oh well."
Peter nodded, slowly but surely getting through brushing his teeth. When he had finished, he reached up at Tony, looking up at him with pitiful eyes.
"Good boy," Tony murmured, slipping a second slick finger in once he was sure Steve was ready, "Lemme know if it really hurts, okay?"
"Alright boys, come eat," Tony called from the kitchen, carrying plates out to the dining room, "You can squish your father later, Petey."
"Mhmmm, it sure is," Tony replied sleepily, cuddling another arm around Peter, "Cold. Steve? Fireplace?"
Johann's wicked grin grew wider at the thought, knowing what he could grab would help his power and cause a bump in the merman's attempt to win the human over.
"Will do." Steve hummed back, heading towards the kitchen to use the phone, giddily calling up the others.
"You're gross and sick," Tony pointed out, sitting cross-legged on top of the sheets, "You can stay in your germ nest without me." He laughed, leaning down to kiss Steve's pouty cheeks.
He smirked and leaned down to kiss at Steve's neck, suckling a hickey on his Irish skin. The blond moaned softly, bucking up into Tony's hand for friction, bringing a hand up to card his fingers through dark locks.
He exchanged the bottle for the teething ring, smiling fondly at Sammy. Sammy suckled on his bottle contently, looking beside him and reaching out to Peter as he and Steve walked into the kitchen.
"We have 3 systems, 15 games to plow through, and enough food to hold us over in case the Zombie Apocalypse comes to pass.". He tossed a controller to both Steve and Bruce as he plopped down in a bean-bag chair, handling his own controller. A big grin grew onto his face.
Um, Hi? So its been a couple of... years. Its been a LONG TIME, but I am wanting to bring this back and work on finishing this. Plus MerMay is coming up soon, and I thought it might be the perfect time to do that during that time.
"Anyway, I know how you feel, Peter. But you'll get better and we'll probably be getting you an epipen from the doctor."
A while later, he had heard light knocking on the door. Tony wasn't even phased by the noise, Steve getting up to answer it.
"We're definitely getting you white ones," Tony breathed, nosing at Steve's cock, "And black. Fuck, you look so hot, Stevie."
"We'll be back tomorrow. Get plenty of rest." Steve told Sharon before they got ready to leave. "And... Thank you. Thank you so much for him. He's perfect." He whispered thankfully.
"Hey, you ask for that story," Tony pointed out, "Steve and I used to be neighbors, for eight years, and never knew the other one until our mailman gave Steve my Mechanic's Monthly by accident."
Glancing between the two people on the couch, Peter nervously asked, “What brings you down to my humble abode.
"Guys," Clint chimed in, trying his best to hide back a smile. "Can we just get out stuff and leave? Because -- correct me if I'm wrong-- but I would like to get home to Nat before she wakes up."
"Let's just say I don't mind using a human dick for a dildo and leaving the rest to the files." a new voice spoke from behind the group.
"I mean what I say, Stark. Peter's gone -- and he's going after Lady Michelle's killer." Loki spoke, a headache already coming her way.
His mother was still alive and well, along with Peter and MJ. His father was... well, his father was out of the picture by a long shot. The second his mother announced her pregnancy to his father, the coward of a 'man' ran out the door with a bag of clothes and his tail between his legs. She was broken-hearted because of his departure, of course, losing all faith in men; that is until Ned was born. When Edward was born his mother's life was turned upside down -- all for the better, of course.
Walking in, almost everyone lightened up at the sight of the boy. "Hey, Peter!" Wanda smiled, cutting short her conversation with Vision. Vision nodded his head in greeting, saying a quick 'good morning'.
Pellets of rain began to pour from the dark skies and lightening lit up the sky like a Christmas tree. Sighing, the boy simply looked up to the sky and closed his eyes, not caring about how soaked his clothes were getting. If he got sick, well.. he probably deserved it.
"We're just look around, but thank you." Nat smiled at the older woman. Nodding her head, the unnamed woman walked off to greet the next guest. After walking around a minute or two, they decided on a bunch of different clothing. Paying quickly, the two left the store and wondered around aimlessly for a bit.
Bruce only nodded before turning back to the group. "What I'm trying to say is, that Peter has had people die right in front of him. Ben, May, and he thinks that he could've stopped Michelle's death. If I was in his shoes, all I would want is revenge, not caring if my life was at stake or not. When, and if, he gets his revenge, it's only a matter of time before his thoughts catch up with him."
Wade took a breath of air, refilling his lungs with oxygen. Because of this, Parker followed his actions, eyes never leaving Wade's blue ones. His hand was still on Wade, it never leaving, only moving to the back of his neck. "Peter," Wade whispered lowly, heart hammering in his chest.
The room that he was in smelt way different from his bedroom. The one at the Avenger's Tower smelt of lemon's and the fresh smell of a new book. This room, however, smelt of faint chemicals. The air, as well, was quite different. It wasn't suffocating, but, it wasn't light either.
It was Monday morning. The most dreaded day of the week, or, in this case, the first day back to school. His hands trembling with nerves, Peter swallowed what saliva he had left and walked up the stairs to Hell.
Sam, of course, will be getting a Star Trek graphic t (remembering Clint and Sam's argument over Star Wars and Star Trek). Rhodey will be given a handkerchief and Vision will be getting a small bell to put on his waist, so people will know when he basically floats by.
"Peter," Natasha smiled once more, an amused look placed on her face, the same one that she only showed to Peter and a select few. "You did nothing wrong, in fact, now I feel even better for stealing Tony's card. Let's buy anything that we want, won't be like he would run out of money."
" Loki retorted. As he did, the prince's figure started to shift. His long hair grew a few more inches, long, loose curls started to form. The male's eyelashes started to grow a tad longer, a Loki's lips glossed over.
The two stood like that for a while, just enjoying each others company, smiling happily at each other. That is, until Peter realized he had to start wrapping the mountains of gifts. Groaning, he checked his phone before jumping with realization -- he was going to be late if he didn't start wrapping now!
Placed on the counter was chocolate hearts, heart shaped pancakes and eggs, three different kinds of cakes (red velvet, chocolate, and lemon [Peter's favourites]), root beer floats, chocolate ice cream, chocolate drizzled popcorn, and finally, chocolate bark (sprinkles on top).
"Whitey's right, Yellow. This is for Peter." he spoke as he took the tiny, preschool scissors into his hands and began to cut out a heart from the construction red construction paper.
About an hour later, Wanda walked into the small room. Closing the door behind her, she looked at the younger boy with a small smile. "Hey, Peter," she greeted, her eyes slightly red and puffy -- like Natasha's had been. "How are you doing?"
Blinking, Peter looked back up to his right, giving a small smile as he took down his hood, “Y-Yeah, sorry, Mr. Stark… just.. Nervous.” he answered, dancing around the question.
Nodding his head, Peter pinkie-promised the older male that he would do what he was told, and upon arrive back at The Tower, Peter did exactly that.
Sorry for the wait! I just got back about a week ago from a local convention, and I've had to catch up on everything, and have at least an hours sleep. Anyways, I know a lot of you were confused and distressed about why Aunt May had let Peter go so quickly to the Avenger's, and Tony. At first, I couldn't really say anything, because I was afraid that I would give it all away, but, now you guys can find out! Just please don't kill me -- *hides behind Wade as a makeshift shield*
"I --" Peter gasped, coughing up a small amount of blood into his hand. "B-Ben -- mem--ries!" he choked out, tears streaming down his face as a panic attack tried to set in.
Hey guys! Sorry for the 'short' hiatus on the book, I do apologize. Updates should be more regular now, but no promises on that. In case you were wondering, the song that I mentioned above is called; 'Dysfunctional' by Tech N9ne featuring Big Scoob & Krizz Kaliko.
“S-Sorry..” Peter apologized. He tried to keep his voice calm, but there was so many things going through his head, it was hard to focus on one thought. ‘What if he said no?’ ‘Even worse.. What if he said yes?’.
Just then, Bruce, Tony, Steve, Clint, and Sam walked into the kitchen. Upon entering, Tony licked his lips, Clint following suit in actions. Rolling his eyes, Peter chuckled softly. Sam, trying his best, tried to sneak a bite of the stuffing, but his hand was swatting away by Steve who was trying his best to give a strong glare, but resulted in giving up by Sam's puppy dog eyes. Damn him. "Smells delicious!" a new voice hollered. Stark groaned, a frown appearing on his face.
Once again, Peter shook his head with a chuckle, his hands in the back of his pockets. Walking into the mall, Peter chewed the inside of his cheek.
to much attention." Nodding along, the doctor slipped on his lab coat and pulled out some materials that Clint didn't know the name of. "And please, Bruce, Stark
"Okay, first of all, fuck you White, you little asshole. Maybe Yellow is right. Oh, you sonofabitch, take that
Of all things, May Reilly Parker Jameson liked to think of her self as more than just an aunt to the marvelous Spider-Man -- and yes, she knew, she wasn't stupid. Though Peter liked to keep her in the dark about his other identity, anything with two eyes and a low-level functioning brain could figure out the truth of why he was so late coming home, with horribly, make-up covered bruises. So when the infamous Tony Stark, also known as Iron Man comes knocking at her door, asking if Peter could come live with them, 'to keep better tabs on his internship', of course, May knew exactly what was up.
Chewing the inside of his cheek, Peter made his way over towards the mirror hanging on the back of the bathroom door. Looking at himself up and down, Peter frowned. Pulling the baggy shirt over his head, he tossed it on the floor. He was now standing in front of the mirror in with his red sports bra. Gently taking it off, he laid it on the floor next to his graphic t. Examining the bruises and wounds, Peter cringed. They were still really read -- and it looked like they weren't going away as fast as he thought it would.
For Spideypool, I strictly read Andrew's spidey, or fics based on the comics. Though this is based on Tom's Spidey, Wade IS aged down. In the comics, he is around 30-35ish..? I'm not sure of the age, but he's in his late twenties or early thirties I think. Correct me if I'm wrong, please!
As if reading the boy's mind, Loki smiled softly. "I heard that you are going through some... not so great things. Is that true?"
"When I was younger," Banner sighed, "my father was quite abusive. He thought that I was a mutant and called me a freak and other horrible names, beating me throughout my childhood." He shuddered. "I wasn't the only one getting beat up every day, though. My mother also took some of his hits. But, years later, she got sick of it. She came up to my room one night and told me to pack my bags, saying that we were going to leave the asshole.
The group laughed and continued gossiping until around midnight, some of them slightly drunk, and the others wishing they could be. If they had to listen to one more punny joke-- "That's it! I'm calling the police!" Sam groaned, his head throne back as he tried to cover his ears. Bruce was telling another science joke and Sam wanted to rip off his ears.
Peter gasped as the air was knocked out of him. Smiling like a sadist, Thompson did it again, and then again. Over and over, he punched Peter in the gut, then in the chest, almost knowing exactly where it all hurt.
A happy tear trailed down Peter's face, his lip quivering as he let another salty track fall down his cheek. Pulling his boyfriend in closer, Wade kissed his lover's forehead, smiling down softly at the younger. The two stayed like that, Spider-Man's cries becoming a hiccup here and there.
"If you think that we would treat him any different than before, you would be stupidly wrong. We wouldn't treat Peter different because of who was before. This is the Peter we know now, not the old him. He's apart of the Avengers -- he's our
Sam wanted to bang his head up against the counter top as Bruce rolled his eyes. Natasha showed no emotion, like usual, and Steve looked like he was holding back a smile. Peter, on the other hand, was holding back a laugh. "Sure," Clint rolled his eyes again, hopping down from off his 'nest'. "So, Cap, what's for breakfast?"
“W-What? I don’t know what you’re.. You’re talking about.” Peter stuttered once more, still dazed by the fact that Tony Stark was in his bedroom.
Looking into the small, dusty mirror, she concluded that this washroom was hardly used. Swiping her fingers over the mirror, she cleared the dust that blocked her vision and looked at herself.
"I changed your clothes, so I hope you don't mind. That pair of pajamas were the first ones I saw -- plus they're your favourite, aren't they? You were them constantly." she raised an eyebrow at the faded shirt and pants. "As for your binder, that godforsaken thing is in the trash -- where it belongs."
got that?" the two gulped and nodded their heads, eyes widened slightly at the change of tone in Romanoff's demeanor. "And if any of disagree with what I'm about to tell you, and/or treat Peter differently after this, you are not welcomed here anymore, and no longer will be considered my family."
. Not taking up the courage to speak, Peter only nodded slowly, even more pain rushing through his body at the movements. Natasha smiled, a small tear rolling down her cheek as she gently pulled the young teenager into a hug.
"Jesus, Bruce, I thought you were Steve." Tony muttered under his breath, running a hand through his hair as he bent down and picked up his abandoned tool. A soft chuckle filled the room as Bruce readjusted his glasses. Stepping inside, he walked over to the desk and pulled out one of the copious chairs that scattered the room.
Thor and the rest of the Avengers sat in the common room of the Tower, watching as JARVIS played the feedback from Peter's room on the large television screen.
Tony Stark started his day by getting attacked by heart-shaped balloons. His nose burned from the strong smell of different brands of perfume, the smell of different flower worsened it even more.
Rogers raised an eyebrow. "Are you suggesting that we break into a privately owned, and possibly federal owned, depending on the search radius, security camera?"
"Natasha, I told you it was fine." Parker spoke in a wavering voice. Getting the cue that the young boy wants to be alone, Nat said her farewells and closed the door. Sniffing, Peter slid off his old tennis shoes and lightly threw them to the side. Laying back on his bed, he picked up his pillow and hugged it over his chest. That, was when Peter Parker broke down.
The room was silent for a moment as if they were digesting all the new information. After a moment, Clint spoke up.
"What do you mean Peter's went off the grid?!" Tony fumed, his hand curling into a fist by his side.
“Okay, I get the point.” Peter huffed, crossing his arms over his chest like a three year old not getting his way.
Parker huffed a breath, a light pink dusting his cheeks. "I get it! I'm going, Jesus!" With a handful of clothes, the sixteen-year-old marched towards the bathroom connected to his room and closed the door shut. The boy could have sworn he heard Loki's laughter whilst he turned the water on.
Completely ignoring the last comment, though Clint winked Wade's way playfully, (hey! who was he to pass up on some meaningless fun?), he turned back and began to survey the area.
(You make it sound perverted,) Whitey huffed in exasperation. Wade rolled his eyes as he pulled up to his apartment building and parked in his usual spot. Getting out, Peter shivered slightly at the chilly, cold weather, the latter doing the same. Bouncing up and down to retain warmth, Deadpool and Spider-Man grabbed the gifts in the backseat and made a run for the flat.
At that moment, no one noticed a limping young teenager walking into the living area, wide eyed as he heard familiar voices playing through the speaker system. Tony looked up quickly, finally hearing him approach the room, trying his best to grab the remote to mute the telly, but it was already too late.
"I really hope you like the place," he hummed, pulling out of the complex and driving off towards the property.
"We need a night where I can do this to you under the stars," Tony hummed, bending down to kiss the moles and scars and marks on Steve's chest, "Just...explore. Taste. Nothing too off the end, but like... As if it was our first time again."
"Then, pray tell, if you know the lad was bludgeoned, why seek me out?" Stark asked, pouring himself a finger of whiskey.
"It won't take long, pipsqueak, I promise," Tony soothed, kissing Peter's cheek, "I know you're excited, lil 'un. You can take a nap if you want, that might speed things up."
DUM-E whirred dejectedly, but did as he was told before rolling his way over to Steve. The bot examined the man with curious beeping noises, moving his crane out gently towards the blond.
Chewing on his fist, Sammy looked up at Steve, idly playing with the lapels of his sweater. He babbled to himself, drooling slightly as he switched to chew on his other hand.
"He takes his Christmas shows very seriously." Steve whispered back with a grin, getting shushed by Peter as well.
"My back hurts," Tony replied, smirking, "Okay, so here's what I'm thinking. By the look of Wade's skin, you said he was dead by 9 or 10 o clock. They found him on their way home from work, which would be around 3 or 4. The skin healed itself, Steve. Whoever killed Wade took his bone for the marrow, and tendon for the muscle cells. They're probably reverse engineering the tissues to discover their healing properties."
"You just wanted me all to yourself, didn't you?"  Tony asked Peter once Steve had left, "Little troublemaker."
"Your dad's the DEAN? What are you gonna tell me next, that you're a long lost prince of some country whose name I can't even pronounce?". Steve was only half-kidding at that last statement. Tony only chuckled.
He smooched Peter's forehead and the boy's wet curls. "The baby coming here just means we gain more love to give. Doesn't mean we take away our love for you and give it to him. You're our first baby, and we could never take that special love away."
Tony heaved again, tears streaming down his face as he choked on his own bile. He sat back when he thought he was okay, only to retch again. Coughing, Tony closed the lid and flushed it away, raising the lid again just in case.
"Nine letter word for a biblical sea monster." Steve stated, trying to keep from looking at Tony. "Why do you do that?"
"All right, I got some cookies and juice to snack on before bed." Steve announced, carrying in a tray with cookies and three juices on top.
Steve's cheeks tinged pink slightly, smirking back over at Tony. "If that’s what you think, hon. I guess I'm just a bit self-conscious about it. I've never had to deal with too much weight gain before." He hummed slightly.
Steve had been walking briskly towards Tony's dorm, worrying himself along the way. He was trying to think of what all he should say. I mean, he was still a little confused on how he himself felt about the whole subject, but he figure he needed to at least try and talk about it with Tony and just go from there.
Steve squeezed Tony's hand gently to try and transmit some comfort to him. "We'll help you get there. You'll see for yourself how great you really are eventually, sweetheart."
"Alright. But I will not be Bambi's mom." Steve smirk, kissing both Tony and Peter's cheeks before heading downstairs.
Steve groaned, head falling back onto his pillow. "That was before you started messin' with meee..." He griped, trying to think of other things to calm himself down.
Tony flushed at that, shyly biting his lip. "Y'think?" He hummed, running his hands down to Steve's belt,
Sammy garbled up at Tony, little feet kicking as he was on his back on the changing table. He stuck a hand in his mouth to chew on since his teether was still in the crib.
“And I’m fine with it as long as it keeps Cap calm,” Tony chimed in, crossing his arms and giving Bucky a quick nod, “And we could use you in a recognition test later if you stick around for his next change. See if he can tell that you’re his friend while he’s in furry form.”
"Yeah. He's a super ducky today, doh." Peter explained as if it were so simple. "He's savin' da people whose boats messeded up 'n lettin' 'em ride on his back to da shore."
"Really? Weird," Tony grinned, gently petting Steve, "We'll get the cherry ones and see what they're like. If you like these."
Once his stomach rolled again, Tony flailed off of Steve, barely making it to the downstairs bathroom before retching into the toilet, coughing wetly as tears rolled down his face.
"Well, the day we left, Steve and I got a call," he began, playing with a fray on Peter's overalls, "It was the prenatal Adoption agency, and they told us we had a meeting with our match."
"This I will agree with. But you have gotten much better about it." The blond smiled, kissing Tony back sweetly. "We've grown up." He admitted at a whisper.
"I was laughing so hard in the store, Steve, you have no idea," Tony cracked up, eagerly kissing Steve back, "For the not-so-virgin Virgin? Good God."
"I wouldn't suppose you would have. I don't exactly show myself around." Steve panted, lips slightly red from the kiss. "And you never touched before either to know."
"I love hearing you laugh. It’s adorable." Steve admitted with a warm chuckle, inching back up along Tony and kissing his lips.
"So what are you wanting us to do with your locks here, love?" The woman asked sweetly, looking between Steve and Tony for an answer.
“We know ya will, Cap. Really don’t think you honestly have to worry about control. You’re fairly good with it as a person. I can imagine you’re the same as a wolf, especially if you recognize us in that form too.” Sam explained, giving Steve a warm grin. “You can do that, right? Don’t wolves do that by smell and stuff?”
The next morning, they managed to sleep in an hour longer than usual before the baby monitor went off. Cracking open an eye, Tony looked over at Steve, not surprised that their bed had been vacated by a small bear.
"Don't get into something you're not gonna finish, Rogers," he murmured, "Because I will take you up on that so hard you will use a belt, I swear to god."
"Hey," Tony reached over to squeeze Bucky's real hand, a soft smile on his lips, "If the son of an abusive drunk can somehow get a family, a kickass dude with a metal arm can have one. Sit down with Nat and Clint, talk it out. He's always wanted a family since he left the circus, and I'm sure Nat's got a secret harboring after being around Peter so much. And if not, I'll be happy to buy you hundreds of dogs till they come around."
"Tony, that's not--" Steve sighed, running a hand through his hair. He turned the stove off so he didn't cause something bad to happen, going after Tony up the stairs.
"Oh my god. I'll need to get that stepstool," Tony joked, kissing Steve back, "I'm thinking gold for my lettering. Real Victorian scrawl."
"I know you do. But breaks are important. Otherwise that mind of your's won't function right, anyhow." Steve yawned, hugging Tony closer. "Sleep now, though. Talk about things later.”
Tony decided to work more on his project that he been working on for a good month or so. Steve wanted some time to try and decide on a sketch to turn into his final piece, so Tony hadn't seen him today. Which was fine, of course. Everyone could use a break every once in a while, and he always had Bruce to keep him company.
"Mhm. Okay, but make sure you get it done," Tony replied, "Monday morning specials aren't exactly the best for algebra.
Peter looked up and over at his fathers, giggling to see Tony nearly asleep. "Daddy's always sleepy, huh Papa?"
He started with the most recent ones. A "Happy Birthday" text from his mother this morning, most of the rest were college announcements, but then he stopped before the next message name set. Steve Rogers. He stared at his phone for a long time before hesitantly tapping the screen and unleashing the messages. He read through each of them.
"You can help me put them on later, okay, squirt?" He said softly, putting the bandaids beside him on the couch, "But first, you've got one more gift waiting for you upstairs."
"Yeah..." He said softly. "But I can kiss ya just because I want to kiss ya, can't I?" Steve asked with a soft smile, giving Tony an eskimo kiss.
"If you had an eye on this place, why hadn't you bought it if you have the money? Being a billionaire, that is." He asked curiously.
"Jay? Send me a text if something goes on," Tony said to the ceiling, placing his phone on the table, "Although, no work interruptions. Good? Great."
Loud rock music played through out the workshop, the only other sound that was barely heard was the clanging of tools. This was a constant when Tony was working on something big. The music however stopped abruptly and a familiar voice rang out in the workshop.
It was tasty and warm-- Well, hot at first since it originally burned his mouth trying to eat it, but once it cooled a bit it was wonderful. Tony also showed him how to actually drink something, which started with water then sips of juices and a drink called soda. Then Tony had explained how to use the bathroom, since it apparently was something that had to be done fairly often as a human. Especially after eating.
"Fine. I'll stop. I'm done for now. Promise." Steve answered with a sigh, shutting his eyes again. “No more sore for a little bit, thank you."
the option I want," Tony announced, dragging Steve along behind him, "Yes. Definitely. Most definitely."
Tony held out his hand to Steve, a hopeful look on his face as a soft and slow ballad started to play in the room. The soldier couldn't help the grin that came onto face at the gesture, at all of this really. He took his boyfriend's hand gladly and followed him out to the middle of the floor.
"Mmm, I'm trying to find your boundaries still, and it's hard to do that when we go sexless for three weeks," Tony replied, stroking at Steve's back, "Which is going to change. I don't care
Tony's eyes went wide at realizing how close he would be cutting it and ran out of his dorm room. He just hoped he could make it to the fine arts building in time.
The blond sat and sketched his husband as the man worked, keeping an eye on him in the process as he worked. He wasn't even sure if Tony knew he was there.
"Love you too, so, so much. Always will, Tony." Steve whispered back softly, reaching down to take Tony in his hand and pump him carefully. "Want to keep you feeling good and happy. Want you to be
"Squishin' me--" Tony laughed, leaning up to kiss Steve. "Yeah. Once he's better, we'll sit down and talk. Too much change might be too much for him."
"But of course. I loved you the first time I saw you. That stuff is special and no way I would pass it up." Tony said with a grin, leaning over to give Steve a kiss.
"Yep. The good ol' Bearcat dorms. Although I don't actually play sports, I'm a 'team spirit' kind of guy.".
"Love you too, Tony." He answered, leaning down and kissing Tony, tender and deep. "Need you to roll onto your stomach though. Okay?"
"That's right, I wouldn't let them," Tony explained, "But sometimes people take what they want, and that isn't a good thing. Papa tries to protect me from that from ever happening."
"We can also talk about 'you literally taking care of me' business," Tony mumbled, sighing as he was lowered into the bathtub, "I really like this side of you."
Peter quickly finished his sandwich and reached for a juice box and carrots, happily munching down his lunch.
"Apparently so." Steve answered back, glancing over at Tony. "And I didn't know. He doesn't really ever ask me to do that stuff for English and Social Studies." He murmured.
"Want ya to tell me..." He gasped out as Tony started a slow rhythm. "Wanna know what more than that."
"I would like to add on to the baby news a little." Bucky said carefully. "Natasha, Clint, and I talked and... eventually we're gonna adopt." He said with a small smile.
"Take your fingers away, and I can help you out with that." He growled back, a hunger in his eyes he hadn't really had before.
?" Tony clicked his tongue, moving his hand down to pat Steve's buttocks none too lightly, "We'll see."
Steve nodded, nuzzling Tony's cheek. "Okay. Just hope you'll be able to handle a mini me. I'm quite a handful as it is." He joked fondly.
"He was drowning, Peg. Right in front of me. Now, human or not, I am supposed to help and protect people that I see in need. And regardless of that being my job, that is just how I react in those situation anyways. You of all people know that.".
“Thank you guys. It's so appreciated. I will do my best in this situation too to learn the extent of what I can do in my new form and learn to keep in control.”
Steve didn't know what to do for the project, which made him worry. The project wasn't due for another two months, but Steve didn't like to put things off, especially when it came to his artwork. He felt he needed to find his subject and find it fast. He pulled out his sketch pad and sat on the nearest bench, looking for something interesting to draw. Plants were too commonplace, so that choice was out. Steve looked around the concourse area, waiting for inspiration to strike.
Steve chuckled at that, smooching the top of Tony's head. "I'll try it out. Hopefully he'll have fun today." He hummed, heading to get in the shower. "You gonna add to his surprise today?"
Steve could hear Tony coming down the stairs as he usually did right after he turned on the coffee pot, turning to kiss his husband's lips happily.
"Yeah. Yeah, then we'll go from there." Steve said as he started to pull away from the lot. "We'll need to move the bassinet into our room when we get home, too. He'll have to sleep in there a while before we leave him in the nursery by himself."
Steve looked over at Peter carefully. It sounds like Peter just doesn't want Sammy using his crayons more so than worrying about what Sammy could do to himself. But he disregarded it for now.
"Maybe it's because I've had my sexcapades, but I really can't see how it’s awkward," Tony murmured, gently kissing Steve back, "I'm glad you're starting to get out of that shell, though."
"You can't be happy and unemotional. Happiness is an emotion." He laughed, running a thumb across Tony's cheek. "Well, at least I know you were thinking about it before and it wasn't an after sex, spur of the moment thing. How long have you had it? And how'd you get it past me?"
"If we were to have a ceremony, it wouldn't be too big anyway if we just invited our friends." Steve explained, tapping fingers gently on Tony's chest. "So really it could just go either way, really. I'd be happy with either, as long as we can say we're married."
"I gotcha, baby. I gotcha..." Steve grunted softly as he started to thrust, nice and slow. He held onto Tony's hips gently as he moved, lifting him a bit.
"I'm gonna put in a donation to an Alzheimer's foundation," Tony murmured, "See if I can get a wing built at that hospital in Seattle.
Today however was the first day that Tony had to actually leave the mansion for work since Steve had arrived. The brunet had tried to negotiate with Pepper a way of staying home for the meeting and just doing it over whatever a Skype call was, but the strawberry blonde was adamant. There was no twisting her arm on the matter, and Tony knew it.
Tony's breath hitched, but he kept a straight face, slowly tugging off is jeans to reveal the panties with garters and stockings. "It's not all I wear well," he murmured, his cock achingly obvious in the lacy material.
"We'll see, Tony. We'll see." Steve said, rolling his eyes softly. He helped Tony out of the tub and wrapped him up with a fluffy towel.
"I am going out, dad. And I plan on building things while I'm gone." Tony hummed, keeping his words short.
"Hey. Everyone messes up, kiddo, I know I still do," Tony chuckled softly, starting to wash Peter's hair, "It’s part of growing up. Making mistakes helps us learn."
"Yep, let’s do that, you get the lil play blanket for them to lay on and I'll get Pete," he decided, turning on his heel to get the older child.
"I'm sorry. I know I can't carry a tune in a bucket, but I enjoy it." Steve said with a wet chuckle. "It’s what Ma would sing to me, so I thought it might help. Plus I thought it'd put Sammy back to sleep."
He laid the boy on top of his chest and covered them up. "We're going to take a nap together, okay? That might make you feel better when you wake up."
Steve's eyebrows quirked up at the strength Tony had used, nodding and doing as he was told. He stripped slowly, just to tease Tony a little, and tossed his clothes onto the floor. He faced the wall and waited patiently on the bed.
Tony cleared space in the room for Steve and the delivery man, grinning at bed frame and mattresses. He paid the man and tipped him, sending him on his way.
"That's my name," Tony grinned, leaning up to kiss at Steve's chest, "So here's what I'm thinkin'. I wanna do more than just blow you--"
Tony snorted at that, laughing quietly. "Well, I think we could get away with it if we kept your place sex-free, then slept there the night before," he mused, "That could work."
"Because," Peter replied, crossing his arms. He tried to huff and play it off, sipping at his empty cup.
Peter blinked, then grinned. "Yeah! Auntie Tasha promised to make me cookies next time I came over--"
"You feel cool right now, too. So I'm very into touch." He stated. "The only other person who touched me in loving ways was my ma. Everything else was getting hit by bullies." Steve said with a dry chuckle.
"We can start wherever you want to show me first. Probably would be best to start on the top and work our way down." Steve smiled back, heading towards the stairs. "Race you upstairs?" He said, raising an eyebrow in challenge.
"It’s alright. You're learning. Just know not to talk while you're chewing food." Steve confirmed. "Don't want to have manners like Uncle Clint."
“Cap. Are you implying what I think you are implying?” Clint asked, all joking completely gone from his tone.
"Are we done being lovey dovey? Because I really want to put my cock in your mouth." He grinned, leaning back and tugging Steve up.
"Nah. A bit mat'ure, doe," Peter hummed, flicking his eyes up to Steve, "Bein' silly is f'babies, Papa."
"So, you thinking a spanking then rattling some desk drawers? Or were thinking of bouncing some springs?" He asked with a smirk.
"I didn't mean ta scare Sammy, eider." He admitted softly, kissing Tony's cheek back apologetically. "I was jus' mad. Is he otay?"
"Bike sounds good--" He whistled when Steve turned around, smacking his ass none too lightly, "You think
"Papa's gonna tuck you in for a nap, okay, squeakers?" He murmured, gently wiping the stray tears from Peter's cheeks, "And when you get up, we'll do the cookies together."
He grinned back at Tony, turning to look at the cabin. "The place looks nice on the outside. Is it even better on the inside?" He asked playfully.
Steve had laid Sammy down for bed, letting Peter stay in the room as well by the time he felt Tony's woes.
"He's gonna be stubborn as all hell," Tony snorted, kissing Steve back, "I know you are, honey. I am too."
"It’s okay, baby. I'm not upset with you about it." Steve answered quietly, smoothing his hair. "This is why we wanted to wait to ask you. We thought you'd might feel upset about it..."
"Oh God, I hope not." Steve huffed an uncomfortable laugh. "That's basically like my brother talking with a friend about my sex life. Although, oddly enough I'm curious about how the night went for all of them."
"Almost. But I didn't. We crawled into bed instead," Tony replied quietly, "I didn't have a plan, I was more venting than anything else."
"Ewwww!" Peter squeak, Sammy making a similar noise after. "No kissies in front of Sammy. He's too inn'cent for youses kissies." Peter protested.
Tony blinked, feeling his heart settle in a pit in his chest . He took a step back, and shook his head.
'What kind of friend did Pepper think I was?' The blond asked curiously, unfamiliar to what she had meant with the way she had said the word.
"You two look a little like a two-headed turtle like that." Steve grinned, seeing Tony holding back a laugh.
Tony. The one he had met after he had been out of the ice, the one he had become smitten with as they fought for New York. The one he loved for so long.
"Nope. I'm being a plankton, and I'm not singing," Tony rolled his eyes, making a face at Steve, "I'll remind you of that next time that we're--"
“Flaaaare~!” U cooed back, purring from the pet of her trainer and warming from the touch. Her tail moved and wagged happily, a flash of something brown and light tan peeking behind it. That certainly caught Tony’s attention.
He ate the sandwich Steve placed in front of him and managed a few swallows of tea, sitting back when he felt full.
"I'm all for that. It’s been locking up here and there from time to time." Bucky explained, rolling his shoulder a bit.
He took Steve all the way in, humming gently. Steve moaned softly as Tony's warm mouth enveloped him, fingers tightening in dark hair as he tries not to buck upwards into the heat. Tony gently sucked him off, pulling off again with a deep pant. The blond mewled and panted the best he was able behind the gag. His body relaxed against the cool of the floor, eyes half-lidded as he looked back down at Tony.
Steve nuzzled into Tony's back, leaving loving kisses along his spine. "Happy Birthday. Love you. Such a good boy, sweetheart. So good." He panted, all his touches after gentle and comforting.
' causing his mouth to hang open slightly at his friends in front of him. "Oh my god, Steve-- did you organize this? Holy
"Lookin' good, Stark," he murmured after trimming his goatee, putting cologne on his neck, "Lookin' good."
Grabbing a cloth, she put Sammy up to her shoulder and patted his back, reaching around to gently wipe the spittle from his lips.
"N-n--ah," Tony moaned, eyes slipping open at the sensation. He whined softly, threading his fingers into Steve's hair.
Tony used his time to clean the house and change into lounge pants, a fond smile on his face whenever he looked over at Steve sleeping on the bed. Eventually, he crawled underneath the covers, snuggling up to his fiancé and falling asleep.
He slowly reached down to take Steve in hand, pumping him while nipping at his neck. Steve tilted his head back and keened as Tony moved his hand slowly, giving a small gasp at all the touches.
for Steve, like it was never an inconvenience for him. But Steve knew it had to be. From some of the talks the engineer (one of the things Tony explained he did for a job) had with the woman that had came to the mansion when Steve first arrived, he had gathered that Tony was a
"He even helped take care of Sammy and helped him crawl around a bit." The blond continued as he bounced Peter on his lap. "Pete's being a great big brother."
"Well, you didn't really have too much stuff with you when you moved in." the brunet said with a shrug as he looked around. "Had your shield, some clothes, a motorcycle, and a sketchbook. That's about it.". An idea hit him then, turning to the soldier almost excitedly.
Steve held Peter to him, petting his hair and smooching the top of his head. "I forgive you, baby bear. I forgive you. I love you.
Steve smiled at that, kissing Tony's cheeks in return. "Speaking of growing up, I didn't know you had taught Peter how to feed Sammy. He does really well with it."
"Ye -- " Peter stopped wide eyed. If it wasn't clear the first time, he definitely felt his stomach drop to his knees. Tears began to prickle in the back of his eyes. The walls were closing in on him -- not physically, but that's what it seemed like at the time for the young boy. "Ho -- How... Wha... N --"
"The last known spot of where our guy is, was in this spot here, which is where MJ..." he trailed off. Barton coughed. "You know... Anyway, this whole area," he tried to zoom in even more, but when it didn't work he scoffed. "Damn it, Stark, fix your goddamn tech!"
So far, he had only the tiniest lead on to where the killer had escaped too, and even that wasn't much.
Quickly, he was in and out in no longer than ten minutes. Stuffing the small box in his pocket, Peter speed walked back to Wade. He was still sitting at their table, exactly like he left him. Seeing his back was turned, Peter took this moment to sneak up on his boyfriend and tap his shoulder. Deadpool jumped ten inches out of his seat with a loud, high-pitched squeak. People's heads snapped to the pair, but Wade didn't pay any attention, and Peter tried not to. Turning around, Wade huffed a breath when he realized it was only Peter, his cheeks dusted red under his black and red hoodie.
"Stark," Romanov sighed. "I don't think that's going to work. He's a mercenary. He's not just going to have his number open to the wor--"
Sharing a silent look, the two made their way inside. "Hi, welcome to Rue21, how can I help you?" an older woman, someone around their fifties, asked.
of mischief and lies. Though sometimes, though shall it be rare, he is neither or both. Because of this, I can tell of others in similar situations, like young Peter."
Iron Man nodded his head, taking in the news before Peter spoke up once more in confusion, “Wait-- why did you do a background check on me?”
Natasha and Clint gave him a gun so they could practice later on -- which they both swore that was a bb gun to worried Aunt May and Steve, though the wink sent the boy's way said otherwise. Vision gave the younger teen a microwavable popcorn popper (seeing how Parker was always late night snacking on popcorn). Rhodey gave him a leather back journal, seeing that Peter goes through one in two weeks, and Sam got him a Star Wars shirt, even though he still stood with his point on how Star Trek was better.
Laughs echoed around the gym, mostly from Flash's team (who were now seating on the sidelines, probably due to Thompson's request -- because there was no way that Peter's team took them all down). Jacoby, however, was paying no bit of attention, to entranced in a sports magazine. "Any last words, Penis Parker?" Flash taunted.
From Tony and Bruce he had received new film for his Polaroid, Steve got him a portable record player -- saying it reminded him of when he was little. Wade gifted him some muscle soak, for when he had tough missions and needed a break, Thor and Loki had brought him a corded bracelet with a beautiful stone. The two said that it was one of the most finest gems on Asgard.
Groaning, Peter looked down at the floor as he walked, almost running into IronMan once more as he came to a stop. "Here's your room, Spidey." he spoke in an amused voice.
Upon reentering the living area, if that was something you would call Wade's littered 'living' room, Peter found a glass of water placed on top of a coaster that was on the coffee table in front of the 'broken' couch. "I hope they fit," Wade spoke up from the other end of the couch, his ankles crossed as he looked up at Spider-Man. "They're mine, and I don't know your size, so I kind of just grabbed my smallest set of pants and shirt." Scanning the young superhero up and down, Wade did have to admit that even though they were the smallest clothing items he owned, they were super huge on the young, teenage boy.
"Are you having a panic attack? I think he's having a panic attack -- Bruce, he's having a panic attack!" Steve's eyes widened, looking between the startled young boy and the scientist.
Anyways, continue, Clint." Steve smiled somewhat gently. But in truth, he was just as eager to hear what the archer had to say, just like everyone else in the room;
"Do what?" he questioned as he turned back to trying to peak inside. "This is my building and I deserve to know what's going on."
Deadpool clinched his jaw as he stared down at the now sleeping Peter Parker. They were only half way through the fifth movie, Harry Potter and Order of the Phoenix when the younger boy fell asleep, his head rested into Wade's side, his hand resting on his chest. Smiling lazily through the annoying black and red mask, Wilson lifted his arm slowly and pulled Peter even closer, letting his hand mess around in those beautiful brown curls. Pausing the movie, Wade glanced at the clock, noting that it was around ten that night. Hating himself for what he was about to do, Wade mentally punched himself.
Some days are harder than others. Today was hard, but I can feel that tomorrow might be even harder — and hell, who knows. Maybe it’ll be a good day for once.
Loki smirked slightly, "'Tis a Midgardian expression, dear brother." Thor made an 'o' shape with his mouth as Wade coughed quite loudly.
Stark squinted his eyes, "But my birthday isn't until next year..? Come on, Wanda, tell me already!" he whined, trying to look over at the elevator.
But what shocked the group was there was no snarky quip back. A bad feeling sunk in the pits of nearly everyone's stomach.
"E-Everything, really.." Parker muttered under his breath, his breath becoming a bit more ragged than before. "Listening to me when I needed to talk to someone, and you to actually listen is --
It was back at the Avenger Tower, well, one of the copious rooms -- Bruce's lab, to be exact. Parker was laying down on one of the hospital beds, in a comatose state. IV's were plugged into his arm, as well as a nasal cannula. Natasha was sitting by his bed side, holding his limp, cold hand. Worry and concern filled her face. Her eyes were red and puffy, as though she had been crying. Her face was pale, and her short, auburn hair was tied back in a small pony tail, though a few pieces fell in her face.
"Better watch it, Katniss, don't wanna get on Cap's bad side." Tony talked, appearing out of no where.
Milliseconds later, the door opened to reveal a mess of auburn hair. Peter chewed the inside of his cheek when he saw who it was.
Not a few minutes later, Uncle Ben would walk in, a smile on his face. His stomach would growl loudly, causing them all to laugh. Uncle Ben would take his spot next to Peter and May, a smear of some substance across his forehead.
A wave of silence washed over the room, it lasting for a couple of beats. That is until a soft voice spoke up once more.
child, it all clicked into place. Because of this, he realized on Frigga and her guidance -- for he will
Shaking his head, Peter sat his clean clothes on the sink counter. Stripping of his clothes, he tried not to look in the mirror at the hideous sight that was himself. Pulling back the shower door, he stepped in and closed the door behind him, sighing as the hot water ran down his sore body, soothing the ache in his bones.
Choosing to be the bigger man, Parker turned on his heel and walked over towards his anxious best friend. "As you can see, Flash," Parker spoke as he made his way towards Leeds, "Both teams are evenly distributed with both females, males, both, and neither. So, if you could please stop being so sexist, it would be greatly appreciated." Cheeks turning crimson, Flash scoffed and walked off, going to help Jacoby set up the game.
Running into the school, the lady at the desk tried to stop them, but gave up when she noticed who they were. Pulling out a list of Peter's classes (that she had secretly made a copy of in case of an emergency, like this one). Scanning through all the possible classes, there was only one that Peter could be in. The gym.
Peter wasn't the best at kissing. Truth be told, that kiss right there that he shared with the merc was his first. So, he didn't know if kissing was suppose to leave you breathless or if it was just Wade. But
"There's the kid," Sam joked before his eyes bulged. "Jesus f--" Steve raised an eyebrow, a bemused expression clear on his face. "--udge?" Clint sniggered as he plopped down next to Natasha on one of the couches. Peter hid a smile as he walked over to the gigantic Christmas tree and placed the wrapped packages down on the floor. There were already tons of gifts, basically overflowing the bottom, but still, Peter found way to place them. Playing Tetris really paid off.
"This year," the coach went on, seemingly missing the whole exchange, "My helper will be none other than Flash Thompson." Peter, and half of the other students, held back a groan. This was going to be hell.
Also! "Спокойной ночи мой маленький паук" translates (roughly) to 'Goodnight my little spider' from Russian to English. Please note that I am really not the best at the language, so if it is wrong and you know for a fact that it is, please, tell me down in the comments and I will try to fix it!
Peter only nodded shyly, not saying an audible answer. "And it's stayed intact?" she questioned once more, which he nodded once more -- a complete lie. The highly intelligent woman noticed this too. "How many uses do you think you have in it?"
Pulling into the driveway of the Avenger's Tower, Natasha parked the car and popped the trunk. Both Avenger's got out of the car and split the amount of bags each person should carry. Closing the trunk, Peter and Natasha made there way back up to the main room.
I’ve been spending more time with my family, too; trying to throw out my suicidal and impulsive thoughts. It’s worked a bit, but not the best method.
"Thor and Loki should be here so -- well, speak of the devil." Clint raised an eyebrow as two gods appeared in the group.
Soon, the two pulled apart, Wade's lips brushing over Peter's one final time before he rested his forehead against Peter's, staring into those dreamy, lagoon coloured eyes.
picture, more than he is now, apparently. "Maybe this will help," Hel said. Looking up, Parker saw the Goddess wave her hand. Appearing out of thin air, was a ripple of scenery.
Natasha noticed that Peter's monitors started to calm down as the teen began to gain control of his oxygen intake. Closing her eyes, Natasha breathed in her self. "Just like that." she encouraged.
"What's for dinner?" a new voice questioned, much feminine. Turning around, Peter faced himself to see a woman with brownish red hair.
“Be down soon. Mr. Stark is a busy man. I wouldn’t keep him waiting.” And with that, she closed the young man’s door and walked back down stairs.
Though there is a slight age gap (2-3 years), there will be no slash/smut in this fanfic, simply because it will not fit with the storyline and/or plot, and seeing that Peter has not reached eighteen (yet). As well as that Wade is technically an adult (seeing that he is nineteen/twenty-ish).
"Hello?" Peter tried to call out, his voice echoing around the white space, bouncing off one side to the next. "Is anyone there?" he tried again, his head whipping around to find someone --
"Spidey, I'm going to have to take off your shirts. I'm sure Brucie fixed you up real nice, but you swinging over here," he pointed towards the web shooters that were hooked to his wrists, "worsened it all up."
His body was shaking. But he couldn't tell if it was from the cold. His grip loosened as that trembling made its way down towards Peter's fingers.
"Get a little emotional, don't you know? You could fool around and make me mad," they sung in unison as they stopped near a red light. The person in the car beside of them gave them a sideways glance, but in the end didn't say anything.
Once the heart was cut, he took his black permanent marker and uncapped the lid, releasing strong smelling chemicals. [Have I ever told you how much I hate the smell of permanent markers?]
"But don't worry. While you were asleep, I sent Clint and Bruce on a trip to the store to get you another. I would have gone, but I didn't want you to wake up while I was out." Peter took another shallow(ish) breath, his eyebrows furrowing.
"Well," Wilson chimed in, smiling through his mask. "You aren't the only one who has someone to woo."
Spatula in one hand, she raised an eyebrow, though she turned the small telly's volume up regardless. "When did you get into the news?"
As soon as he reached his destination, he booked himself inside and carried everything into his workshop. Placing the bags onto the floor lazily, he immediately grabbed his screwdriver and safety goggles.
"Over there is the men's section, holding all kinds of clothes. If you're shopping for yourself," she turned her attention from Peter to Natasha, "The women's is opposite to that. Basically a mirror if you think about it!" she giggled in a high pitched manner. Parker raised his eyebrows and pursed his lips. Nat thanked Amber quickly and the two basically sprinted off to the men's section.
"Peter," a soft voice spoke. Nearly jumping out of his skin, the teenage boy looked up. Tears fell from his eyes as he stared at his mentor. "Listen, kid, breathe -- breathe!"
“Everybody, meet Peter Parker, also known as Spider-Man.” Tony smiled, which earned a few chuckles from a certain red head,
"We're here, mortals. Don't fret." Loki spoke, though their form has changed a bit since they last saw them. Thor was by their side, smiling softly.
up?!' which, Steve didn't take too well of. Nonetheless, Peter laughed, enjoying some of the corny jokes that only a handful could understand.
"Spidey, get your beautiful ass down here before I do it myself." Deadpool ordered. Jaw ticking, tears welled up in Peter's eyes once more. Stepping down, Parker looked at the gravel under him, not being able to look Wade in the eyes; his mask clutched in his hands.
Though she didn't get sick, that feeling in her stomach wasn't going to go away. Not for a long time.
For those who don't know, "ты, черт возьми, издеваешься надо мной" roughly translates to "you're fucking kidding me" in Russian. Like I've said before, I am not an expert in the language, so please, let me know if I am wrong and I will change it asap.
Wade pretended to think, placing his pointer finger on his chin. After a couple of seconds his shook his head, "Nah fam."
"As soon as Mr Stark gets back with Aunt May. Right now, I'm going to set the table, anyone want to help?" with that, everyone shook their heads no.
Barely remembering the way, he stumbled into the room. "Star wars is better than Star Trek." Clint argued with a unfamiliar man.
"I'm sorry, hun.." she smiled sympathetically at the hurt boy. A single man tear slipped down his face. He chewed the inside of his cheek to stop from groaning in pain outerly. Quickly grabbing a different towel, Nat dried the 'wounds' througholy. Then taking the oitment, she rubbed it over the big spots, wrapping them in bandages. "I advise you to not where your binder for a couple of days." she intructed once more.
"Somewhere that's cheap?" Peter thought aloud to himself, a confused look upon his face. Once more, Natasha rolled her eyes.
Natasha looked towards the two, a spark of interest in her eyes as she noticed the way that Loki is caring for Peter. Some might say that he has taken the mortal under his metaphorical wing.
“Oh!” Tony jumped in sudden remembrance, “It’s basic logic to do so before you move in with someone, you know?”
"Well, well, well, if it isn't loser number one." Flash teased. Peter, for the umpteenth time today, sighed.
"I said," Parker spoke louder this time, knowing full good and well that Thompson heard him the first time. "Leave me alone."
"You have a choice for a special reason, young child. But, do to The Fates, I am not able to say. The main reason, however, is that you are an important person, so to speak. And do to requested from Odin himself, you will have a choice -- as well as any of the other Avengers." Death answered patiently.
was what he wanted to talk about. And here he thought it was something important. Though he thought those thoughts, Parker showed no sign of emotions, nor, change.
Lately, my depression has gotten so bad, it’s hard for me to do the simplist of task (like getting out of bed and eating). Recently, everything seems to be a chore. I know it shouldn’t be, but it feels like it.
Currently, Peter was at Wilson's place, seeing he needed to do some last minute gift shopping-- and by last minute, he means
"Peter, please. Listen to me. I'm trying to get it through to you that I'm not going to tell anyone." Nat said softly, her red hair to the opposite side of where Peter was pulled into. Soon, the young boy relaxed into the hug, hugging back just as tight.
{When is there even a 'good' Deadpool?} Yellow questioned in Wade's head, a snigger coming afterwards. Wade rolled his eyes.
One by one, all of Peter's classmates soon began to walk to one side or the other. Ned was to the left, Michelle to the right, and a bunch others mixed in between. Soon, it was just Flash and Peter in the middle. Everyone stared at them, waiting for the upcoming snarky remark or fist thrown. "And finally," Flash smiled as he saw their teacher coming back with a sack of different coloured balls. "Penis Parker to the left. "Or wait, shouldn't you be on the
." Peter raised an eyebrow and Wade put his free hand up in surrender. Unwillingly letting go of his Spider, Wade put the car in gear and drove off to the local mall.
, stop begging!" Grabbing the hanger from Clint's hands, the male stopped off into the dressing room, getting a quite strange look from the man behind the counter.
-- that he wanted to scream. He wanted to cure the wind. He wanted to send out a big, gigantic 'FUCK YOU!' to the sky, hoping someone out there, wherever they may be, heard it.
"That's not going to happen. Not on my watch." Natasha spoke solemnly, ignoring the way Deadpool's face lit up with pure joy at the so-called 'reference'.
"Oh, yeah," Nat smiled softly. Getting up from her desk chair, she stretched. Looking over at the boy, she continued talking. "I wanted to take you shopping, seeing that I noticed that you needed a few things -- clothing and
