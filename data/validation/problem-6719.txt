“Really? Because it looks like you’re working with the cops, Steve.” Bucky spat out, “So go head, tell me that isn’t what’s happening here.”
“Is younger a good thing?” Steve asked, hands coming up to wrap around his boyfriend as Tony all but melted against him in the warmth of the water.
Steve was helpless, something he hadn’t felt since his time in the war. He took a few steps towards Bucky, hoping that by physically closing the distance, he might also manage to close the rift between them.
Thor cut him off, “Ross is more likely to arrest T’Challa for disruption of justice than believe him. He’ll start digging, he’ll assume the real Captain is running scared and he’ll know that means he’s close. We’re building up a glass house and asking it not to crack under all our weight. It’s a mistake.”
They climbed the winding dark wood stairs together, heading for the top of the house. The mansion itself was one of the older Brooklyn estates, built in the 1800s and left to fall into disarray over the years. It was one of the first things Steve had brought after becoming the leader of The Avengers and had fixed it up himself along with the help of the rest of the gang in order to allow it to become both a home and a base of operations. Phillips, who had ran the gang before Steve and who had taken Steve to be his right hand in all gang related matters, had operated out of a warehouse near the docks. Steve still owned it but now it served as a cargo hold. Phillips had made The Avengers a gang and given them a reputation but Steve had made them a family.
Because they were really doing this. Giving this thing between them a go. Something Steve hadn’t even been able to contemplate a few months ago. It was never something he desired, especially after Afghanistan. He figured he wasn’t built that way anymore; love and relationships weren’t for him but perhaps with Tony they could be back on the table. Perhaps he could be something more.
Fury had a tight grip on his arm, roughly tugging him to show his victory to his team, “I hope you know what you’re doing.” He said lowly for only Steve to hear and then the moment was over, Steve was passed into another pair of hands and all but shoved into the back of a police van with several officers piling in after him.
Fury hummed, “I can knock out the cameras and we can take it through the service exit. Why are we moving him though?”
Fury slapped down another photo. A bullet wound in Bennett’s head, “Execution style. That sounds more like The Avengers to me.”
He was a sweaty exhausted heap beneath Steve and with a few more thrusts into the mattress Steve came as well, making a mess of the sheets and his stomach as his cum pooled beneath him. He rolled over, moving off the wet spot with a sly grin, a tight stomach, and Tony’s hand absently stroking his hair as Steve leaned his forehead against his hip.
Steve understood his silent plea to stop talking about it and nodded, “What do you want to talk about?”
“Because you don’t see anyone, Steve.” Bucky replied, “You have one-night stands. You get it out of your system and then you come home. What is it about this one that you can’t let go of? Is he that much of a good fuck? His father is Hydra for fuck sake. He’s probably working for them too.”
Tony’s honey brown eyes held his firmly, a soft smile curving his mouth and a steel resilience in the way he held himself that told Steve all he needed to know.
The kitchen was cleaner than the living room, clearly it wasn’t used as much. A few coffee mugs on the sides but mostly it was a clean space with white cupboards and black granite worktops. The light from the window filtered in nicely and Steve found himself imagining Tony stumbling in there in the mornings to make his coffee before work, probably squinting because the sun was too bright, but he hadn’t gotten around to putting up blinds in there yet.
It was already dark by the time Tony made it back to his apartment building, the winter nights pulling in the darkness early and dropping the temperature fast. It had to have been near freezing when Tony parked up and started the ascent to his condo on the top floor. The apartment block was always cold in the stairwell, just bricks and concrete that did nothing to protect from the cold weather, even the metal handrail was frigid against Tony’s palm as he climbed.
Steve had to find him before it got to that stage. Getting Clint out of jail was one thing but if the police found evidence to place one of them at the scene then there wasn’t going to be a lot he could do. He couldn’t buy off a judge and an entire police force. Not even with T’Challa’s help.
Steve gave a small laugh, grabbing a sponge from behind him to rinse down Tony’s chest, “Well, you must be the only garage that runs an animal shelter on the side.”
She leaned over and placed a hand on his, stopping his cleaning. Steve looked at her smaller, delicate hand on top of his, both pink with blood. They all carried horrors with them, “Is it. This family. That’s what we’re fighting for. Hydra isn’t going to win this one, Steve. We can’t let them.”
Tony sighed, “Whoever you are, you better show yourself now!” He shouted, feeling like an idiot for even doing it, “I’m serious. I’m armed and I’m pissed off.”
Bucky sighed, “I think he makes you want to be someone else. Someone who died in the desert years ago. I think he’s going to get you killed.”
“You told me I was on my own,” Steve replied, “I couldn’t risk him sounding the alarm before I got out of there.”
His legs were shaking now too, and his heart was beating too fast and God, was he dying too? He couldn’t catch his breath and his eyes stung.
“I’m a mechanic who happens to own a company, and I’m completely yours. Partners. Equals. Always.” Tony echoed back, a smile on his face, “Yes, I’ll move in with you, Steve.”
Steve took the glove from his hand, lighting the end of it with Bucky’s lighter. It set alight easily and Steve throw it in the door they had just come out of. He handed the lighter back to Bucky with a nod of thanks, letting Natasha and Bucky head back the way they’d came. Thor disappeared as well; Steve assumed he was going to start the car.
Tony stayed like that, Steve’s fingers inside him as he rolled his hips, not pulling away from Steve’s hand. Steve understood what he needed and immediately started moving his fingers, rubbing against Tony’s prostate gently with the pads of his fingers.
“It’s a stabiliser. Part of the solution Howard couldn’t figure out, a conductor for the Jericho core. It’s not easy to find but Howard will be able to get some.”
“This isn’t an interview, it’s a conversation, Mr Stark.” Ross replied, hands gripping the desk, “And I’m just trying to figure it out.”
Once in his room with the door shut, Steve allowed himself a moment to breathe. He let his eyes slide shut as his back rested against the wood of his door and he felt his hands start to shake.
It was Natasha that spoke, “Things took an unexpected turn with the guy we were tailing for you. We dealt with it.”
It would have been too easy for them just to be able to walk out of there and Steve should have guessed that the lack of men in the hallways was because they were all heading to block off the exit. Rumlow had taught them something at least.
“He wants us running scared. He wants the police on our ass so we can’t make a move and then I suspect the endgame will be to start picking us off one at a time.” Steve growled bitterly. Hydra had always been a pain in his ass, ever seen Phillips’ time in charge. Back then it had been a man called Schmidt in charge and killing him had put Steve in the position of right-hand man to the leader of The Avengers. When Phillips died, he had naturally assumed the role and set about recruiting his own people to get revenge.
Steve caught his gaze again, eyes burning, “Schmidt killed him. He slit his throat right there at the docks like butter. I killed Schmidt to even the score. Then when I told the gang what had happened they all looked to me to be the next leader. They started speculating whether I was telling the truth or whether I killed Phillips just to get him out the way.”
It had snowed overnight, as Brooklyn often did for this time of year. Everything was coated in a brilliant white that hurt Tony’s eyes and had him wishing he picked a warmer jacket for the weather, but he continued on regardless. He walked to work most days, preferring that short walk to trying to keep his cool in the city morning traffic.
The cars, two of them which seemed a bit full on to Steve but apparently the police were making a statement of their own, pulled up in front of him in a screeching holt. They blocked off Steve’s path, Steve stalled on the street and watched as cops piled out of the vehicles, guns drawn and raised at him as they formed some sort of line. Had they rehearsed this?
Steve knew what Tony was doing. He was giving him permission. Showing he really did except every dark part of Steve’s soul that he wasn’t even sure he excepted himself. Tony was giving him everything, acceptance, a future, an order. Whatever Steve needed it to be, Tony was giving that to him. And wasn’t that the kicker, Tony Stark making room for Steve’s issues in his heart when Steve couldn’t accept them himself.
Tony shook his head, “They didn’t stay because you offered them protection, Steve. They stayed because they cared about you.
Thor stepped closer to Steve’s side, putting a hand on his shoulder, “We take the fight to Rumlow. We tear apart everyone standing in our way.”
Tony’s feet were carrying him to a safe harbour without his mind really registering it but he let his shoulders slump with relief at the sight of Rhodey in front of his eyes, sitting behind his desk at the police station with a frown on his face and paperwork stacked up around him. Tony couldn’t even remember getting up to Rhodey’s office but he was glad he was here. Rhodey had always been good at picking up his pieces and it was selfish but it was better than reaching for a drink so it’s all he had.
“I’ll think of one.” Steve replied, gasping as Tony rolled his hips again, “I need to get Rumlow first, get him to the cops for the killings and then work out a deal.”
“Sam told me you left the bar with that mechanic last night,” Bucky replied, “Doesn’t explain why you didn’t come home though.”
“Steve?” Bucky’s voice asked through the phone, he was concerned and confused as to why Steve was calling him so soon after their meeting.
“You can’t keep me locked up without evidence!” Clint’s voice echoed in the empty interrogation room with biting injustice. It wasn’t the first time he’d seen the inside of a room like this and he knew it probably wouldn’t be the last.
Tony was picking at his nails nervously by the time Bucky had driven them back to Steve’s place. He had offered to take the drive back as soon as they left Howard’s office and the thought of facing Steve again was at the forefront of Tony’s mind. Now he was back facing this house again he was glad Bucky was in the driving seat.
There was a pause at the other end, even Tony had stopped walking. Stood next to the car with his hands in his pockets, watching Steve with curious eyes.
“No?” Rumlow mused, “How about little Peter? Accidents can happen when you walk home through Brooklyn at night. He’s a smart kid though, It’d be a shame to see his brains coating the pavement.”
Tony rolled his hips at the idea, smile of his face wide, “In your vintage getaway car? Is this some fantasy of yours?”
She gave him a dry smile that didn’t reach her eyes, “Come on, I need to make sure they haven’t killed each other up there.”
“Like this?” Steve breathed into his ear, “You want me to take you like this, so hard this desk is going to give you bruises and I wouldn’t be able to work at it without thinking about the way you sound when you cum?”
“Take your pants off, now.” Steve ordered in a tone that was all the Captain and sent a bolt of pleasure straight to Tony’s dick. Even tied up he was still calling the shots to make this good for both of them.
It might be a reckless decision. He had cops coming after him. Hydra and Rumlow coming after him and yet there was a part of him that couldn’t imagine fighting through all that and not having Tony there at the end of it.
“They weren’t going to hurt you, Tony. Rumlow needed the Jericho and I did try asking nicely. I came to your apartment and you, quite literally, shut the door in my face.” Howard told him plainly.
Natasha stood, “Well, they messed with the wrong mechanic because this one is under our protection.”
Rhodey pulled back gently, bodily forcing Tony into the nearest chair as he crouched down next to him, “You’ve got to clue me in on this one, Tones.”
Steve groaned at the feeling of their dicks moving together, his only half hard from his orgasm and Tony’s rock solid and begging for attention.
The sparse rooms and cold concrete reminded Steve too much of the buildings they used to clear in Afghanistan. Bricks and mortar, nothing to suggest it had once been a home except an abandoned stuffed toy or a missing child’s shoe. Steve felt the same shivers creep up the back of his neck as he did in the army.
Bucky nodded, "You're a stubborn ass but you’re our stubborn ass and we're not letting you do this alone."
Steve ignored the voice in his head that told him this was what love felt like because he was a monster. Monsters couldn’t love. This was lust, this was family, this was addiction and caring and something else.
Tony fluttered his lashes and smirked at him, “I shrunk it in the wash, but I love this t-shirt.” He shrugged, “You don’t like it?”
Steve placed a kiss on his shoulder blade, nose brushing against Tony’s skin, “You want to feel me pressing against you as I drive into you? You want me to fuck you like this knowing no one else will make you feel this way?”
Tony slowly tore his eyes away from the body and met Steve’s. They were scared and lost; a wild brown that made Steve want to cry for him. He wouldn’t be able to come back from this, he knew, Tony’s only chance was to make room for it.
Everyone was gathered in the living room, a hub of nervous energy and chatter. Steve stood in the centre of it all, tall and tired and resolute. Tony felt his heart give a jump at the sight of him. He’d changed out of the orange garb, wearing jeans and a t-shirt and looking a lot more like his Steve than when Tony had last seen him.
Tony’s hands were already moving, fingers mapping out the planes of Steve’s chest, across the valleys and dips of his body as Tony ducked his head down to nip and lick at Steve’s collarbone.
He wouldn’t do it. He wouldn’t help Rumlow get shit. He could kill him right here in this dirty grey cell.
Steve never got tired of that, the fear when they first saw him, he moved closer as he clicked the safety off the gun in his hands. He eyed his guest with a quick smile before moving over to get a wooden stool from the workbench and bring it over so he could sit in front of the Hydra member.
His cum hit the back of Tony’s throat, warm thick streams that he swallowed down despite the salty taste. Tony sucked him dry, leaving Steve a quivering mess on the mattress and having to shallowly thrust his hips against the sheets to search for some friction. He had wanted to see Steve come undone like this, he knew Steve would be primal like that, but he hadn’t thought about just how much this would turn him on.
Tony wasted no time in doing just that, his rhythm was shaky as he allowed himself a few shallow thrusts into Steve’s mouth, feeling out what worked for him. Steve encouraged him with a squeeze of his ass cheeks, lifting Tony up higher to thrust in further. He could take it and Tony needed the relief.
“Hydra’s new leader is apparently working to destroy my team.” Steve replied as he pushed open the door to the outside chill with Fury hot on his heels, “If I can find out who he is then I’ll be able to stop him.”
Steve shook his head, “We don’t have time.” He reminded Tony quickly, slipping a hand into the one not encased in the arc reactor technology and turning on his heel to go back they way he’d come.
The look in Tony’s eyes though, unyielding and passionate and perfect. Steve kissed him, long and deep before pulling back, “We could change our names. Go anyway. Paris? Italy? London? Or find a backwater town that time forgot and stay there.”
Steve would fight with him till the ends of the earth if that’s what it took. Ross wasn’t going to win this one, not now, not ever.
“You’re right. I didn’t want to be a mother.” Natasha sounded defeated, “I didn’t want that responsibility and I’m glad I did it. Look at who we are, the life we have. You want to bring a child into this? Dropping it off on a playdate so we can go and kill a man? Praying they don’t find the guns we need to keep stashed around the place for our own protection.”
“I’ll have a protection detail set up on both of them discreetly by morning.” Steve assured him, “Rumlow won’t get close.”
“Tony.” Steve groaned into his ear, picking up his pace as he slammed his hips forward again. Tony whined in response, curling his hand tighter around Steve’s as Steve repeated the motion.
Steve snapped the neck of the guy in front of him in a second, barely enough time for him to blink. Hydra was on edge about something and Steve couldn't help the small part of his mind that screamed 'Tony'.
Steve smiled sadly as her, Tony right next to him, “Brooklyn is our home. We’re coming back one day, we have to. I have to.”
“He did. He’s pretty bad, won’t let anyone near him. I think you’re the only one he’ll talk to right now.” Fury sighed, “This is bad, Steve. When I offered you the job this wasn’t part of the plan.”
Bucky and Thor were absent from the group and Steve tried to allow himself a small moment of relief that they were already in place at the docks, watching the shipment yard for any sign of Tony or Rumlow. As soon as Steve knew for sure that was where Tony was being kept, he could act.
Steve hummed, pushing the shirt up to his ribcage, “I could.” He agreed, dipping his head down to kiss the muscles of Tony’s stomach, “But I’m rather enjoying watching you squirm.”
Tony dropped his arms to his sides with a sigh, “You hurt me. You made me feel like shit, Steve. I thought it meant nothing to you. That I meant nothing to you.”
Steve frowned slightly, brows furrowing together as his hands came up to rest of Tony’s waist, “Instinct?” He offered with a small smile.
Natasha smirked, “It’s Steve’s. Sam brought it as a Christmas present last year as a joke. He uses it every day.”
“I’m not giving up.” Steve told him, eyes looking at the rest of his family, “We’re not giving up. We’re The Avengers, we don’t give up.”
Rhodey was there, to his right with worried eyes. He was scared but Tony was numb. Ross was watching him.
“Tony, it’s Steve.” Steve tried again, taking small steps towards him so not to startle him as he avoided the blood soaking into the floor.
“Because he managed to get a plan in place to ambush my team in the space of a month. He’s skilled and apparently impatient if these deaths are to do with Hydra. Trust me on this, I know army guys. They don’t like to wait around. I was working for Phillips again only a month after I got back from Afghanistan.” Steve replied, “And you’re holding the returning soldiers benefit for this year to make your campaign look good so I know you have the list.”
Clint was off like a shot. Bruce was focused on Bucky again, “Listen to me, Bucky. The only way you’re going to survive this is if I seal up the wound to stop the bleeding. It will scar and hurt like hell but with antibiotics you should be free from infection.”
“We’ve come a long way from being those kids in Brooklyn, haven’t we?” T’challa sighed, “Sometimes I miss those days.”
Tony, that one was the killer, the one thing Steve couldn’t make peace with despite having days in a cell to do just that. He’d seen the look in his eyes at the docks, Steve had hurt him and for that he would never forgive himself. He would add that to the list of sins Ross was no doubt about the discuss with him.
“Make sure our new friend finds his way out,” Steve asked Natasha as he breezed past her, “And tip him extra.” He was moving again before Natasha could utter a word or even look up from her sandwich. She’d handle it, she always did.
Now, with all those eyes on him as he trailed a path from one end of the living room to the other Steve found himself feeling more like a caged animal backed into a corner.
“Yeah, yeah. Just trying to break the cycle of shame I guess.” Tony replied, “Go put your cat somewhere he isn’t going to get run over. We have Mrs Henderson dropping off her car in 20 minutes.”
“I can. I have pull in the right places. I’ll push for them to move him to a state that has the death penalty. It won’t be too hard when everyone thinks he’s a cop killer who just hacked a man’s head clean off.” Ross smiled, all teeth and smugness.
Tony kissed him then, deeply, slipping his tongue into Steve’s mouth with a teasing flick, “So does this mean I can booty call you now?”
“Yeah, it’s all over the news, they think its gang activity, right? You’re working on that?” Tony asked.
Tony moaned, grinding his erection against Steve’s palm as his fingers burrowed into the hair at the nape of his neck, “I want you inside me.”
Bucky sighed gently, “He doesn’t think about the job when he’s with you. He doesn’t think about anything but a fantasy with you. He doesn’t think about The Captain or his own survival. That’s dangerous for a man like Steve. As soon as someone like Rumlow finds that weakness they exploit it. I know how that story ends and I don’t want to bury my best friend in the ground because of some infatuation he can’t resist.”
Rumlow ran a finger under Tony’s chin, “Maybe tomorrow. I’ll give you until then to change your mind on building the Jericho.”
Tony nodded, “We’d be Stevens and Potts. Maybe we’d open up a bar like Sam. Cosy hole-in-wall flat above it. It’d be nice.”
“If you kill me, you’ll still have to deal with Ross.” He warned Steve, “You think he’s just going to let you ride off into the sunset with your family and your boyfriend?”
He never expected it to be like this. Quiet and invisible and bloodless. Steve could fight a war; he knew how to face an opponent when he was staring down the barrel of a gun. How was he meant to win this one when the noose being fashioned was one of his own design?
He’s stomach was in knots over Tony and his heart thundered loudly in his chest. He was almost there, this had to be done now.
“Brock Rumlow? Is that who you work for?” Steve tested, “You aren’t telling me a name if I guess it, right?”
"You don't understand what's at stake here. We might not all make it out. Bruce and Sam at least should sign the papers, you’re lower level, no record, they might not even bother reassigning you."
There were dark nights where Tony wanted nothing more to burn it all down to the ground. Nights when he whispered things to Steve that he’d never admit in the light of day. Steve listened and held him on those nights, let him work through the mess of feelings he had over his father in his own time and his own way.
Steve bit his lip to stop the groan as he allowed his hands to run across the smooth skin on display for him, “That’s not exactly the phrase I would use.”
“The one I called to fix your bike? You said you wanted it sorted before your next meeting with Hydra so I found the best Mechanic this side of Manhattan. He’s in the garage right now.” She explained.
“I guess all those years of friendship with a cop finally paid off.” Tony smiled, leading Rhodey further into the garage.
He kissed him softly, tongue running along the seam of Tony’s lower lip to tease him. Tony, ever the impatient one, tried to deep the kiss. Steve resisted that temptation though. He wanted to commit every second to detail. His mouth mapped over Tony’s, tilting his head to deepen their kiss until Tony let out a small growl of frustration, pushing his own erection into Steve to make his point.
“Let’s discuss how two of your men where found on my streets last week.” Steve replied with a frown, “Pretty sure you’re in breach of your treaty right there.”
And to make matters worse Tony had given him his number like it was just a random guy he met at the bar. Steve was damn fine, for sure, and a great kisser and so cocky Tony wondered if he were like that in bed. Nope, bad ideas.
He was still pulsating tightly around Steve’s cock, the warmth tightening and loosening around him as he wrung every last bit of pleasure from Tony that he could.
Steve could feel himself getting more erratic, hips smacking into the curve of Tony’s ass as he increased his pace.
“I mean it. I’ve loved you since the first time we slept together and I stayed, and I woke up the next morning thinking I could get used to this. I’ve loved you and worshipped you and adored you. And even if you walk out that door now, I’ll love you still.” Steve told him, “But it’s your choice. It has to be your choice. It always should have been.”
“If this is a booty call, I feel like I should warn you I’m about twenty minutes away from crashing so I’m not sure it’s going to be…” Steve started as Tony pushed his vest over his head and let it fall to the floor.
“He won’t stop coming after me. I escaped jail; he’ll target the team. You. I don’t know. He’s desperate. He either catches me or I hand myself in. I’m not sure which one I can stomach.” Steve replied, rolling onto his back in defeat.
“I need you to do better.” Rhodey replied, “He’s a criminal, a gangster. He’s a killer, Tony. How do you even know him?”
“Then I’ll come back for you. After he’s dead, after you’ve watched. I’ll hunt you down and make sure these streets aren’t yours either. Every corner, every day, you’ll wonder if this is the one where I come for you.” Ross pushed further, “No Captain to save you, no Avengers around you.”
Steve shook his head, “Yes, I am. I may not have killed Phillips Tony, but I have killed countless other people. Only last night I cut a man’s hand off then came back inside to dance with you like nothing happened and it didn’t bother me. Not once. I grew into the role of The Captain and I lived up to every violent story there is about me.”
“Steve?” Rumlow’s voice asked, he seemed unsure like he was still remembering their army days in his mind. Steve froze. Fuck. He didn’t reply, couldn’t find the words. Rumlow continued though, “Steve Rogers? There’s only one person I know who’d be that much of a righteous ass and I thought he died in Afghanistan.”
Nat feigned ignorance, "I have no idea. Talk a walk, clear your head? I'm sure you'll think of something."
Steve released a breath he didn’t know he was holding, “And we’re back to your long day.” He teased with a smile.
Steve kissed him, deep and long, “You’re gorgeous like this, you know? I can’t even think straight.”
Tony nodded and Steve could feel his eyes on his ass as he climbed the stairs to the main house. He almost threw a glance at Tony over his shoulder but held back. He wasn’t a goddamn teenager anymore.
Steve shook his hair out, combing a hand through it, “Can you tell the others I have a meeting later; I might not be back for dinner.”
“Fuck.” Steve swore and Tony had never heard him this vocal before, it sent pleasure pooling through him at the thought of Steve losing control over that as well.
Bucky sighed, eyes drifting to Tony for the first time in their conversation, “I know. I saw it the moment you walked back into the house and started trying to help us get him out of that cell. That’s when I knew Natasha was right, I was wrong about you.”
Bucky was on the opposite side of the room to her, clearly intend to make this a stand off between them. He had his arms crossed like a sulking child, but his tone was biting, “I told you I had it!”
“Steve wants to meet me at the docks.” Tony told Thor, abandoning his still nearly full mug of coffee in his haste, “Fuck.”
“I guess not,” Tony mused, “How’d you sign up for this, you don’t seem like the gang type.” Then when he thought better of it, he added, “You don’t have to answer that, it’s none of my business.”
Steve hurled the phone at the wall in anger, the device bouncing off the wall with a crack to land uselessly on the floor. It didn’t make him feel any better, but it didn’t make him feel any worse either.
Fury nodded, “And my silence. Frankly, I don’t care who you are or how you faked your death. You aren’t the biggest threat right now, whoever is butchering my cops is and I have a feeling you want to get them just as much as I do.”
Steve did the move again, watching as Tony writhed beneath him like a crescendo in a musical number. He was beautiful and sinful and for now at least, he was all Steve’s. He increased his pace again, moving his head up and down faster then before until he could feel Tony in the back of his throat and smell his sweat. His nose was buried into Tony’s pubic bone on every thrust and Tony was practically vibrating with his arousal.
Steve could feel the anger in his veins, heart racing as he stood up, kicking the stool back so he had some room to move. He was crouching over his guest in seconds, the barrel of Natasha’s gun pressed firmly into the meat of his thigh, just above the knee.
The Mechanic didn’t seem to be concerned, “That explains your face paint. Red’s not exactly your colour.”
The cuffs were taken off him and as soon as he was free Tony rubbed at his bruised wrists with the pad of his thumb. He squinted through the dim light in the room that the overhead bulb provided. There was only one chair. Was he meant to sit in it? Was this the first step to getting arrested?
Steve slammed his cock back in again, harder and faster. He turned slightly, moving Tony with him as Steve slipped a leg between his and Tony wrapped one of his around Steve’s calf. The angle let him go deeper and that let him go harder.
Rumlow seems to believe that Tony is building his Jericho, or at least, he has little knowledge of mechanics and weapons manufacturing to assume any different. Using Peter and Rhodey to get to him had been smart, if this wasn't a common occurrence in Tony's life at this point he might have even fallen for it. But he knew how to be a hostage, he knew when to be defiant and when to play into the part Rumlow had set up for him to take.
He slipped it in with the others to feel Tony vibrate against him, fuller and more desperate than before. Steve pressed against him, feeling Tony’s body against every line of his and he pushed deeper inside his heat, curling his fingers in the way he knew would rub right over Tony’s prostrate because he knew Tony’s body better than his own.
“Don’t believe everything you hear.” Steve responded, turning to lean his back against the railing and study Fury instead, “What can I do for the police department today?”
Rhodey nodded, “Okay, if he was Hydra then I believe you. This isn’t how you want to start your reign at SI though.”
Tony wasn’t sure how long Steve had been sitting out there, in the cold night air with blood covering every inch of him that Tony could see. Him and Natasha walked out, spotting him instantly, alone and guarded and almost other-worldly.
Rhodey was still at the office when Tony called, working intel that suggested Tony had been kidnapped and he had gone into panic mode when Tony hadn’t answered his phone. Tony bluffed as best he could, explaining he was at the shop and lost track of time. He was fine and hadn’t been kidnapped, what was Rhodey taking these days? He could have stayed talking to him for an hour but he didn’t want to have to lie to him anymore so Tony quickly hung up with a cheerful jib about him needing to get some actual work done and telling Rhodey maybe he needed to take a few days off.
Eventually, Tony touched his fingers to Steve’s, slowly moving them down towards his palm until his cold fingers were curling around Steve’s wrist and Steve was able to latch his own fingers around Tony’s.
“Staying together is more important than how we stay together.” Clint agreed, “It’s not ideal but we’ll make it work.”
Steve held his breath as he waited for Bucky’s reply, “I’m not taking it out on anyone. You’re being ridiculous.”
“Get to the docks. Report back when you have something for me.” Steve’s change of subject spoke volumes, “Get everyone else back to the house. I’m heading home now.”
“I went to my father and made a deal for you. I helped break you out of jail. Because I love you, Steve. Whether it’s the smart decision or not is irrelevant now. I’m too far into this with you.” Tony replied, closing the gap between them until his hands were stroking down Steve’s shoulders and Tony was standing between his legs.
“Shift forward.” Tony told him softly, hands on the edge of Steve’s chair to steady himself. Steve understood where this was going, immediately locking his hands onto Tony’s thighs as he slid down into the seat a bit more, bringing his knees up higher so Tony had a bit more room to manoeuvre himself into a better position.
“Is that blood?” He asked before he could stop himself, putting the toolbox down and heading over to inspect the car.
“Is this what you want, sweetheart?” Steve asked him roughly, the heel of his hand pressing against his cock.
“They’re my family.” Tony responded, eyes dark as he all but forced Ross backwards with his presence until Ross hit the desk again and Tony had closed the gap, “And I’ve lost enough of that tonight.”
Tony was escorted into a small room at the end of a corridor, not a cell or an interview room like he had first thought. Instead he was pressed into a box room with a small slit window. The room was once a storage cupboard of some kind and now seemed to act as an office.
He heard the floor creak in Nat’s room, someone had moved, “I’m sorry. I am. But you know I’m right. We’re mobsters, we don’t get a happy ending. You and me, they are going to put us in the ground together, but I can’t give you anything else. You know that.”
Steve sighed, fingers grazing Tony’s forearm as his hand cushioned his head against the pillow, “I thought I lost you.”
“Then let’s give him something to tell them.” Steve replied, “Let me help you bring down Rumlow. You want him gone such as much as I do. I can stop him, Fury, for good. No more killings, no more selling weapons to children and pushing drugs through the high schoolers on the street. Give me 24 hours and I’ll end Hydra before Ross even gets to Brooklyn.”
She gave him a smile that didn’t meet her eyes, “He’s your best friend, I won’t put you in that position.”
“Well, he’s an idiot.” She gave him a wide smile like she’d just shared a secret, “And he was wrong. He probably knows it too. I told you, Steve loves to protect everyone else by throwing his ass in the fire. It’s just what he does.”
Tony was in front of him receiving the same treatment, his eyes boring into Steve’s. He looked scared although he was doing his best to hide it, a steely gaze and a set jaw. Every bit the survivor.
“I didn’t think I’d be able to feel anything after… I didn’t think I’d be able to feel love or happiness or relief.” Tony sighed, “But I do. I love you, Steve. It’s still there.”
Steve knew he was close; he was tense and moving constantly. It wasn’t about anything more than his release and there was nothing more beautiful than Tony Stark chasing his own passion. He wasn’t even making coherent sounds anymore, just gasps and pants of pleasure as Steve worked that second orgasm from his body.
“You want to play it that way? Fine, hand yourself over to me or the next name I release will be Natasha’s or Sam’s or Clint’s. The cops might not be able to get you, but they can arrest everyone else. Clint’s got a reputation for police custody, hasn’t he? Natasha has an impressive rap sheet too.” Rumlow replied.
Tony lingered in the doorway; shoulder propped up against the doorframe, but Steve felt his eyes on him. He didn’t look awkward, just apprehensive. He wasn’t sure how this would go; he wasn’t sure of his place outside of their relationship yet. Steve remembered feeling the same way when he had first taken over from Phillips, the rolling uncertainty of what steps to take. They’d come, Steve knew, having had to carve out his own to get this far.
Clint grunted, “Bring alcohol!” He shouted out to Thor as he slumped his head back against the cushions.
“Promise me. Whatever happens next, we do it together.” Tony replied taking Steve’s hands in his own.
Everyone was waiting for him. A packed-out living room full of Steve’s family without their leader. It was an odd scene, there was a sombre tone to the air that didn’t work with the happy teasing family Tony knew them to be. Natasha ushered him further into the room, pressing him into a seat.
“I understand that you’ve always been an idiot. I understand why you think the safety of this family is only on you.” Bucky told him, “I also understand that if Rumlow is coming for us then you’re the only person who might stand a chance against him. Not the cops, not a specialist unit. You. But you can’t do that without our help.”
Tony was frozen, he couldn’t speak or move. His hand was red and slick and shaking. Natasha had told him to find a soft spot and push and he had. God, what had he done? He stared at the letter opener in his hand again before dropping it to the floor in disgust. Oh god…
He wanted to shout into the waves crashing against the docks in hope it would make him feel better. Or find Rumlow and put a bullet in his head. Or find his family and spend one more night together without the weight of this conversation crushing him from the inside out. Or turn up at Tony’s door and lose himself in his touch.
Steve was about to walk away, leave them to their privacy when he heard his name. He stood frozen as their conversation continued.
“No, Steve.” Rumlow smiled, “You killed them remember? Or at least, that’s what Ross thinks happened. He must be on his way by now. I told him once you escaped custody it was only a matter of time before you came for me.”
Steve struggled against the cops holding him, fighting his way over to Tony. He managed to wrestle free long enough to close the gap between them, fusing his lips with Tony’s in a tight kiss. When he pulled away Tony had a smear of blood on his cheek that had transferred from Steve’s own skin, “Don’t say anything. We have a lawyer; you’re going to be fine. I promise.”
Everyone was waiting in the living room, anxious faces all staring at Steve patiently. Tony felt almost shy standing there in Steve’s t-shirt and his boxers, despite the fact everyone else was still in their pyjamas and Steve himself was without a shirt in his haste to find out what was going on. He tugged at the hem of Steve’s shirt, hoping to pull it further down his legs before he stopped himself. It wasn’t like they didn’t know they were together. Everyone knew what they were doing in Steve’s room last night.
“Not possible.” Tony retorted, “I’ve never pressed my ear up against a door to listen in on the conversation inside.”
Tony beamed, “Captain, it would be my pleasure.” He laughed, pulling Steve towards him, “Bedroom eyes?”
But he always found himself stopping by the bar at least once a week to check in. Sam came to the house frequently to see everyone but Steve preferred to see him like this, in his own environment. Sam was completely at ease here, mixing cocktails and flipping bottles with an easy smile and bartender banter. Just seeing him look lighter made Steve feel lighter.
She studied him for a moment, one eyebrow raised in a way that made Steve feel like he’d been caught with his hand in the cookie jar, “Oh, you liked him huh?” She teased softly.
Steve hit the floor hard, back stinging against the cold concrete through his jacket as Rumlow landed with him. The gun was knocked from his hand and Rumlow had thrown his own away mid-charge. He wanted this to be bloody and vicious and animalistic. He wanted to walk out of there with Steve’s blood on his skin and claim his victory like a bloody crusader, getting the dirty work done.
Both cops were silent, and Steve could see them mulling it over. It was the offer of a lifetime, the chance for Ross to achieve everything he came to Brooklyn for before Christmas and without innocent bloodshed. It was tempting and he’d be a fool not to take it.
Steve couldn’t stop moving, pacing back and forth simply to have something to do. He was never good at being still, even in the army. He often challenged orders to stay put if there were lives in danger. Now, Tony’s life was in danger and Steve found those old habits return to him as easily as breathing.
He was out of the car without waiting for the others, the adrenaline and anger coursing through him reminded him of his time in the army. You put one foot after the other and you keeping going. Don’t stop, don’t hesitate otherwise you’re dead. That training had stayed with him and even now Steve felt like a livewire. He was constantly in motion. He could feel Tony’s gaze on him as he got out the car with the others to join him.
“Oh, I’m sorry, shall I get written permission from you before I enter a bar in your patch for a drink?” Tony snarked with playful eyes and God, did he have any idea what that did to Steve? No one dared talk to him like that anymore.
Tony didn’t respond to that and Steve wanted to ask him what he was thinking. He needed to know what Tony was thinking because that was as close to an omission of feelings he had gotten, and he could feel the blood pumping in his ears. A room of Hydra men he could deal with, silence from Tony Stark? Steve wasn’t sure how to deal with that.
The Captain took the attic, partly because he liked his privacy and partly because the view of the sunset from the attic was stunning and Steve always itched to draw it. His bedroom, office and a private bathroom where all on that floor and while he often found Clint making use of his office in the dead of night as a vantage point or Bucky using his bathroom when Natasha had claimed the one of their floor for a bubble bath, for the most part the attic was his space to breathe. A place where The Captain could slump his shoulders and not have to worry about what eyes saw him and mistook his actions for weakness.
“You’re, God Tony, you’re everything.” Steve smiled, feeling a tear in the corner of his eye, “You’re the smartest man in the room always, you’re funny and kind and caring. You’re the only person who could match me on my best day. You’re the person I want to wake up to every morning and go to bed with every night. You’re the man I want to be better for. The man I want to cherish and protect and be claimed by.”
Tony could feel his heart rate pick up speed, “Are you sure about Ross? Maybe he just wants a win in Brooklyn so he can go back to where the hell they shipped him in from.”
Tony stirred in the sheets, but he didn’t wake. God, Steve would never tire of having him here. In his life, his home, his bed. How had Steve earned this right? This privilege? Tony was a masterpiece in skin, all tanned and warm and plaint and Steve knew every inch now. He’d mapped it with his hands and his mouth so many times and still he wanted another.
As it turned out everyone else was pretty much thinking along the same lines as Steve and Tony were. When they suggested their plan to everyone only a few hours later their family didn’t look surprised. Natasha even pulled out a shoe box full of fake passports and IDs for them all except Tony that she had stockpiled away for months. Sam and Bruce wanted to stay, as Steve thought they might, but everyone else seemed to think leaving Brooklyn was the best option for their continued survival. Natasha assured Steve that Bucky was also on board, apparently, they had talked about it months ago when the idea of a turf war started.
Tony was brought out of his thoughts by the sound of his captor rising to his feet, heavy boots thudding on the concrete as he made his way over to Tony, “We seem to be having some miscommunication here, Tony. My name’s Rumlow, this here is my little empire.”
“Well, like we say in the army: we take the world as it is, not as we’d like it to be.” Rumlow replied, Steve could hear his smile.
“It’s amazing, Tony.” Steve said, hands running over the paintwork, he could barely feel the dent now, “Thanks for getting it done so quickly.”
He pulls out plastic wrap, bleach and a bunch of other chemicals and gets to work, he hates having bodies in his garage. He moves the corpse onto the plastic and manages to wrap it up neatly to be disposed of before he starts on the bleach, smothering the floor in it to try and get rid of the blood stains.
He wasn’t asking them to view Tony as a gang member, he wasn’t going to make a declaration of what Tony could offer them like he normally would. This one was decidedly more selfish. Steve was asking his team to encompass Tony into their family because Steve wanted him there. Because he was important to Steve.
Steve nodded, glad that Tony was open and ready to making that step and he wasn’t in denial about it. That was good, the acceptance would make it easier for him in the long run and whilst Steve would protect him if he needed it he was glad that Tony was allowing himself this chance to move forward.
“I’ll wash it.” Steve promised, “Also I left Rhodes in the locker room. He’ll have a headache when he comes around.”
Natasha nodded, “He’d probably take it better. You don’t know what it’s like to have to kill someone because it’s you or them, Tony. That’s what Bucky’s worried about. He doesn’t want you to judge Steve because of the things he’s done or try and change him when there’s a turf war going on.”
His guest was exactly where Natasha said he’d be, sitting against the wall with his hands tied and cuffed to the radiator over by the cars. He was bleeding from his head, clearly where Natasha had hit him with the butt of her gun, but he was awake and staring at Steve with wide eyes. Someone, probably Bucky, had tapped his mouth shut.
They all were, Steve knew, and he’d seen Thor swing that hammer enough to know that he never missed his target.
So, Hydra was looking into getting a few politicians under their belt. Rumlow was getting busy. He’d need them if he ever hoped to move bombs on the black market, “Rumlow’s upgrading, huh?”
As Natasha drove off and Steve buckled his seatbelt, he couldn’t help but worry for Tony, facing his father after everything Steve knew he had been through at his hands. He shouldn’t have done it; he shouldn’t have needed to.
Rumlow hit him again and Steve could feel blood on his face, a trail of liquid trickling out of his nose. He let out a breath, waiting until Rumlow brought his fist up to strike again and then he acted. He had sparred with Thor and Bucky enough to know how to deal with an opponent like Rumlow. He was open just before the hit and Steve used that. He brought his own fist up, punching once at the soft tissue of Rumlow’s armpit and then jabbing him hard in the stomach. The move startled Rumlow and knocked the air from his lungs which was all Steve needed to throw him off balance. He rolled them over, arms on Rumlow’s jacket as he slammed him against the ground.
Steve was addicted to this man, a little bit more with every word that left his mouth. He grabbed Tony in a searing kiss and hoisted him up, letting his legs wrap around Steve’s waist for leverage. Tony smiled into the kiss as he got settled and Steve was pretty sure the roll of his hips against Steve’s erection was absolutely on purpose.
Tony blanched, letting his hand fall to his side and then he was moving. Steve was as well, meeting him half way.
As soon as Bucky edged forward, Steve had an arm out to his right to hold him back. He could feel Bucky’s angry ebbing out from him like a furnace. Buck always did have a short fuse. If it wasn’t for his lack of patience Steve could have sworn he’d make a better mob boss than he did.
“I’m an idiot.” Tony muttered into Rhodey’s shirt, hating himself for wanting to pretend Rhodey’s arms were Steve’s for a moment.
Natasha looked from Bucky to Tony and back again with a small shrug, “Just be careful.” She said softly although Tony got the impression she aimed the comment more at Bucky than at him.
“Tony,” Steve breathed out in a pained whisper whilst everyone else became distracted in their conversations. He has closed the distance between them now, catching Tony before he left the room completely. He caught Tony’s fingers in his palm, warm and callous, “Can we talk? Please?”
Steve’s mind was reeling, running through as many ways this could play out as possible. This was bad. This was bigger than him and Rumlow. This was the start of a whole new Brooklyn.
Then he saw himself. At least it was sketches of his eyes. All dark and playful but they were definitely his. Then there were actually sketches of him, in this pad along with everyone else Steve cared about. Tony was unprepared for the onslaught of emotion rising up in him. His hands stopped flicking through the pages at the sketch of him working on the car in Steve’s garage. It was a side profile, Tony busy focusing on the car in the drawing but there was something there. The look of peace and contentment at doing something he loved, even in a drawing Steve managed to see him better than most people did in a lifetime.
“You don’t hurt them.” Tony spat out, “I’ll build your missile, and you leave them both alone. That’s the deal.”
Steve gave him a sideways glance, “Sitwell’s done. Bucky’s throwing his body in the ocean as we speak. Apparently, Hydra has a new King.”
Steve nodded, pulling back. Of course, Tony had thought about it and it was too much, “I can drop you back, we’ll grab the car.”
He placed his glass down on the bar, “That won’t be necessary. Just let me buy you a drink and we’ll call it square?”
He rounded another corner, coming face to face with three more guys. He grimaced, eyeing them carefully. The heavy guns across their shoulders caught his eye.
Steve watched as Sitwell glanced at Thor again, eyes slipping down to the hammer in his hands for a brief moment. He was cataloguing. Doing inventory. Trying to judge which members of Steve’s team to go for first in a fight.
“Same as before. Wound was inflicted before death, he struggled for sure. The cause was the bullet to the head, expertly done. You still thinking gang crime for this one?” Adam asked.
He rolled his hips into Tony’s, rewarding him with a deeper kiss when Tony met his hips halfway. That firm press of their dicks against each other sent sparks through Steve and he couldn’t help but let his desire to see Tony Stark like this take over.
Steve’s eyes were on the screen as an old army photo of him flashed up on the right-hand side. He barely recognised the man staring back at him, small and weak. He didn’t have what it took to survive. He was so young back then, innocent and wide eyed and off to fight another man’s war like the good little soldier he always wanted to be. Steve almost felt sorry for him.
The door opened and he couldn’t help but feel disappointed when the man staring back at him wasn’t Steve. Instead he was older, a salt and pepper quality to his hair and glasses perched on the bridge of his nose. This is what gang members looked like now? Tony was thinking of the stereotypical dark colouring and guns. A tattoo maybe? A gang sign? Something?
There must have been a dozen or more there. Had Howard fixed the design flaw by himself? Or was he using a different triggering mechanism for the impact. Tony moved round Natasha, walking into the room.
“He’s been through a hell of a shock to his system and he’s still fighting. If we can replace the blood he lost and keep on top of any infection he’ll be okay. Mentally though, that’s going to take a toll.” Bruce sighed, “It’s going to be a long-haul process.”
He shrugged out of his joggers and his t-shirt, balling them up into a corner until he was as naked as Tony was under those sheets. Steve couldn’t help himself, he needed to wake Tony up anyway so why not let them both enjoy it? Just for a little while longer.
Steve pulled out to the tip and slammed back in again, Tony’s body moving into the desk at the force of the thrust.
Thor surveyed the damage around him, bodies piled up throughout the length of the corridor with blood and brain matter decorating the walls and the floor. There were even splatters of it on the ceiling, a new personal best.
“Okay.” He smiled back, “We need to talk to the others, get them onboard. Sam has the bar so he might want to stay. Bruce too, he’s put his life into the clinic. He wouldn’t want to leave it.”
He forced himself not to look over his shoulder, he couldn’t look jumpy. He had to be in control of this situation. He was The Captain, even with a broken heart and no way out, his audience would expect that of him.
He was already striding down the corridor when Fury caught up with him, “Hey! You want to tell me what that was about back there?”
“We’re the only ones here.” Steve replied, helping Tony move enough so he could slip out of his heat and dispose of the condom, “Bruce left for the clinic when I got back.”
Steve knew he wouldn’t win this argument and there was something about having Tony in his bed, in his arms that just felt right. He didn’t want to have to move and ruin the moment they were carving out of their blissed-out state. Steve snuggled back against him, spooning him from behind.
There were muffled words against the tape and Steve frowned, he leaned forward and grabbed one end. The tape was ripped clean off, leaving an angry red mark across his mouth.
Then he was gone, not even sparing Fury a glance behind him. He could have shot him in the back while Steve was leaving if he really wanted to, but Steve knew that wasn’t the play he was making. He needed Steve to get Rumlow off the streets and to the police. He couldn’t act against Ross’ orders, but Steve could. It seemed, for now at least, Steve and Fury were tied together in seeing this thing through to the end.
Steve frowned and looked down; the sketch was hardly his best work. A pair of eyes, round and deep and rich twinkling at him for the paper. Tony’s eyes. He shifted awkwardly in his chair, “Just doodling.”
“You’re the monster, not him.” Tony uttered between them, seeing the glint in Ross’ eyes. He was enjoying this. The pain it brought Tony, the fear. The power. Ross was coming alive with every threat he threw Tony’s way.
So far, no luck. No luck on the Hydra front either. They had been trailing a couple of lower level guys for the past two days and there was nothing new to be learnt. Whoever this guy was, Steve knew he was smart.
Tony was shaking beneath him, his breath coming out in pants everytime Steve thrust back into him. Their bodies moved together, pushing and pulling to create the friction that was driving them both crazy.
Thor went right, hammer swinging easily in his hand as he let out a low whistle. He was drawing the enemy to him, Steve knew. Thor always did like an audience when he used his hammer, a taste of what was to come. Steve continued straight ahead, following the corridor as it bent this way and that. Rumlow was here somewhere and Steve knew he wouldn’t be hiding.
Tony’s eyes were on Steve, who hadn’t shown any sign of recognition since he came into the living room, “They don’t know anything for sure. We can give them another false trail, tell them The Captain is someone else.”
Steve needed Tony to come again, he wanted to feel him around his cock as he came just like he had last time. To see if he were right and there was nothing sweet than the way Tony Stark fell apart with Steve’s cock inside him.
Tony shook his head, “You could never be a monster, Steve.” It was the strongest his voice had been since Steve had found him and he was thankful to hear it.
“How did you get out?” Tony asked breathlessly, hand moving to tug the knot on the other tie to free Steve’s other hand.
Steve felt his own cock ache at the thought, “Jesus Tony.” He sighed, giving his cock a squeeze before withdrawing his hand.
The first guy charged at him and Steve wanted to admire the effort he put in. He was strong, Steve was stronger.
Ross’ face grew redder, “You think I lost. Your boyfriend is sitting in cuffs right now, he’s going away for the rest of his life.”
Howard seemed to admit defeat then, shoulders sagging a fraction like he was no longer preparing himself for battle, “I need your help.”
Forgive me, he pleaded silently, punch me. Be disgusted, be angry, be repulsed but please don’t be this.
Tony scoffed. The Jericho was a weapon of mass destruction that Howard had spent the better part of a decade working on. He was obsessed with it, needing it to be the deadliest weapon on the market. Tony had solved the issue once when he was 17, he hadn’t even been trying. He’d just designed a new trigger system on the edge of a letter because he was bored. When Howard had found it, Tony knew he planned to use it to make the Jericho a functioning missile and in doing so would end up selling it to arms dealers on the black market. Tony had thrown the paper into the fire, letting it burn and was rewarded with a beating for his troubles. A beating he still carried the scars from.
He tapped on the door and Tony watched it open from the other side. Rumlow was out of the door in seconds, it shut with a metallic clink after his departure.
“Not involved.” Tony replied, “If you think he’s coming for me then you’re going to be disappointed. He doesn’t give a shit.”
As soon as his arms were free, Steve moved his attention to Tony’s jeans, fingers deftly hooking around his belt loops to pull him in so Tony staggered into him as Steve worked the button open and fly down. Tony was rock hard under his touch and Steve couldn’t resist sliding his hand into the jeans to cup him through the material of his boxers.
Tony hummed against his cock, the vibrations sending pleasure straight through Steve and had him tugging at his restraints with so much force than the headboard creaked in protest. Tony continued fucking Steve with his mouth, swallowing around his length like he was gulping down a glass of water just to watch the way Steve jerked his hips uselessly and arched his back off the bed a little to seek out more friction.
Steve almost came right there and then. He drew his fingers out, feeling Tony shiver as it did so, a thin sheen of sweat already coating his back, “Okay, I want that too.”
“You’re still here, aren’t you?” Steve smirked cockily and was rewarded with a playful twinkle in Tony’s chocolate eyes.
He slid out of Tony gently, moving down to roll off the condom and tie it off. He found the bin next to the bedside table and threw it in there before settling down next to Tony on the white sheets, breathing heavily and blissful spent.
“Seems to me like people are already talking, sweetheart.” Steve replied, “Might as well give them something to talk about. Besides, I’m not a mob boss anymore.”
Steve was shaking with the effort not to rip the material of the ties right off and throw Tony down until he was fucking him to the point he couldn’t remember his own name. Tony’s hips were grinding against him, desperately seeking more friction.
Then Tony was moving, slowly and teasingly. He used his knees to move himself up and down on Steve’s lap, allowing Steve to thrust into him shallowly. Their pace was gently, almost sweet, like they had all the time in the world to just feel this.
Natasha tilted her head at the question, “We aren’t together anymore. It doesn’t matter to me who he screws.”
“Bucky, I need this done. They took him because of me so you get Thor and you get down to the fucking docks. I need to know Tony is there before I go in and get my hands dirty. If he isn’t and Rumlow finds out I’m coming, then he’ll kill him.”
Then their lips were colliding and there was no more room for reason. Tony’s mouth was hot and demanding against Steve’s as he rested his weight against him, leaning up into the kiss. Steve’s hands were still tugging the shirt at his waist loose, letting the material pool to the floor at their feet. Without the obstacle in his way, his hands were free to explore the span of Tony’s hips eagerly.
He was met with silence rather than the uproar he was expecting, and he wasn’t sure that was any better. Where were the shouts of him losing his mind? The yells that he was an idiot and Tony was a civilian?
“Hi, I’m Tony, the Mechanic. The Captain asked me to fix his car?” Tony greeted with a smile and a nod towards his toolbox.
What made him pause was the whimpering body of Howard Stark at Rumlow’s feet. He was bleeding from his temple, expensive suit all dirty and crumpled as he lay on the ground like a lapdog. A sniffling mass in an Armani suit. Steve didn’t pity him, not after everything he’d done to his son but he knew Rumlow had brought him here to play that card.
Steve raised a hand, motioning for everyone else to stay put in the living room whilst he moved into the hallway towards the front door. He clicked off the safety on his weapon, one hand reaching for the handle. He could shoot before their visitor had time to draw breath if he had too. He wasn’t in the mood to play games tonight.
Was this Hydra? Now he wasn’t under Steve’s protection were they trying to kidnap him for their side again? Or perhaps it was Steve? Come to finish the job and finally kill Tony to get him out the way?
Steve stepped closer, pulling the invitation out of his pocket, “I came to ask you on a date actually.”
Tony nodded, “I am very smart. I’m also impulsive, reckless on occasion and according to my best friend I have the capacity to make terrible decisions for a smart person.”
Steve nipped at his nipple lightly before pulling back, hands working on the ties of Tony’s joggers – which were miles too big and definitely belonged to Steve – tugging them down his legs along with his boxers until he was free of them and sprawled out naked on the table like a three course meal.
It’s difficult in a car and it’s not something Steve thought about beforehand but together they managed to move enough to get Steve’s pants down by his ankles and have his cock standing free and erect between them.
He took gentle care to dry and bandage Steve’s side once they were out, fingers running over his skin softly. Steve hummed happily as Tony worked, planting little kisses along his bicep as he finished the job at hand.
“You pick a direction and you start driving, don’t think too much about it.” Steve told them, “Don’t tell anyone where you’re going until you get there. Communicate by postcards in coded messages. No phones, no emails. Nothing Ross can track. We can’t afford slip ups on this.”
The other cop commanded the room immediately, he was large and imposing. Not in the way Steve was but in a different way. Something subtler and harder to read. It was the eye-patch over his left eye that caused Clint to stall. That was different. His suit was nicely pressed and black, his hands free as he shut the door behind him and went to sit down next to his colleague. His good eye never left Clint, still standing near his side of the table, as his friend fussed about with the file in his hands.
Steve hung there unsure what to do with the sudden display of affection, "What's this for?" He said.
Tony shuffled further along the wall, “Don’t touch me. Please, don’t touch me.” He tucked his knees further up against his chest.
He had worked on the core first, using the palladium that was meant to act as a catalyst in the Jericho to power the reactor and the copper ring to keep the energy focused and central. He next worked out the casing, the palladium was highly reactive and would erode his skin if he touched it, not to mention the chemical mixture was hot. Third degree burns kind of hot. So, Tony spent the next few hours hammering sheet metal from the supplies Rumlow had given him to form a protective circular casing for the arc reactor.
Steve caught his eyes then, brown and soft, crinkled at the edges. The tension was leaving his shoulders and Steve couldn’t remember the last time he had felt this at ease. He shouldn’t have. He had a million and one problems to fix. Hydra. The police killings. The immunity deals. Fury knew his identity. Nat and Bucky were slowly torturing themselves instead of talking.
As soon as the assistant was reaching for the phone Tony breezed past her, heading straight into Howard’s office without knocking, Bucky close on his heels.
Steve sighed to himself, reading over the letter again. T’Challa was right about Hammer, he was ruthless when it came to business and he wasn’t above hefty payouts to swing the vote in his favour. He was also scared shitless of Steve.
“I didn’t.” Steve whispered softly, “I didn’t kill him. He was dying anyway. Cancer. He knew it was a matter of time. He told me on the way to a meeting with Hydra’s leader. A guy called Schmidt. I think he was trying to prepare me for what was about to happen.”
There was another thud as Steve approached the door, this one weaker than the last. Steve watched a hand smack against the pane of the glass, red smears staining it as the hand dropped from view.
He texted back a quick ‘okay’, because he knew he had to and then he was excusing himself from the rest of the group to head to his office. The list could have waited until tomorrow, but Steve knew he would never be able to sleep whilst there was work to be done. Bucky gave him a raised eyebrow on his way out but otherwise he left without too much disruption, the team deserved a night off.
Steve kept pacing, mind turning. How could Hydra know about Tony? Had they been following him? What was the plan now they had him? Steve hadn’t received any demands and he couldn’t help but think Hydra would want to rub this in his face.
Steve had gone to all of them in the past, at T’Challa’s insistence. He had charmed and persuaded his way into getting T’Challa the votes he needed to be able to make a difference in this city. A city they both loved and grew up in. Steve could remember the boy he was, all scabbed knees and bright eyes. A boy who was going to make a difference in the world. Then he had left for college, specialised in politics and realised just how hard that was to do. Steve chose to help Brooklyn with his fists, T’Challa chose to help by talking. They were still working towards the same goal and despite how different their lives had turned out; they had never lost respect for each other.
Bruce smiled, “I don’t doubt it. I’ll let you get to it; I’ll be in the kitchen so shout me if you need anything.”
“It’s a weapon of massive destruction.” Tony bit out, “You’re a mob boss, what could you possibly need with one.”
Steve brushed a hand over the hair on his jaw, “I like cars. When I was a kid I wanted to be a getaway driver.”
Tony was still rocking his hips slightly, riding out the after shocks of his orgasm as Steve slipped his hand out, wiping the mess of lube onto his jeans before moving his hand up to steady Tony’s body.
“I don’t know.” Steve sighed, “I didn’t plan on it, Buck. You’re right, sometimes when I’m with him I forget about The Captain. I’m just plain old Steve Rogers except I don’t feel like I’m drowning. Isn’t that why you liked Nat, after Afghanistan she was the only person who made you feel like that.”
Tony mewled at the feeling, muscles contracting and relaxing around Steve’s finger as Tony pushed back into him. Steve started to work his finger in and out of Tony’s hole, pushing a little further each time at a slow and steady pace that had Tony writhing against his hand. Steve slipped in a second finger, breathing heavily at the feeling of Tony gripping him tightly. Steve pushed his fingers in deeper, listening to the sounds he wrung out of Tony and watching the way he shivered against him, his breath fogging up the polished wood of Steve’s desk.
The room fell silent, the awkwardness in the air settling like a thick layer of snow around them. Steve couldn’t tear his eyes away from Bucky, trying to understand, trying to communicate something to him. Anything. When had this rift between them opened up?
By the time he was out and ready to leave the apartment he felt better. He hadn’t thought about Steve in at least an hour, okay only once in the shower but it wasn’t his fault. His mind was a damn traitor. He shrugged on his jacket, texted Peter to say he was on his way in and he was off.
He stood in front of him, watching those brown eyes see him properly and his hands uncoil from his sides, “We need to take these off.” Steve said gently, fingers tugging on the jacket Tony wore to help guide it down his shoulders.
“I want you. I want whatever future that means we’re together.” Tony whispered between them, pulling back only slightly so Steve could feel his heat, “And right now, I want you to fuck me over your desk.”
Steve tucked the phone into his pocket, stepped into his boots and shrugged the jacket over his shoulders. He spared a last look at Tony, sprawled out on the bed and looking all too inviting for his own good. There was a part of Steve that wanted to forget about leaving, that wanted to climb back into bed and wake him up with soft kisses and see what happened next. That part of Steve was starting to become dangerous to his job. He needed to get his head on right, he had to deal with Hydra, the police. He needed to make sure his family was safe.
Tony had his palm raised, “You heard The Captain.” He added, flexing his fingers over the device of the glove.
Steve nodded. “Ross’ body being discovered with something related to Hydra will prove he was working with them. We just need to shape our own narrative. You get your new unit; we get our freedom. We make sure nothing like this ever happens again. You said so yourself Fury, with Ross being Hydra the case isn’t credible anymore. This is the only way we all walk away from this now. Together. If anyone finds the body, you’ll both be charged along with us. We’re stuck together whether you two like it or not. Your survival and ours depends on us pulling this off.”
Tony sensing something was off, ducked out from underneath the car bonnet and pulled the screwdriver out of his mouth. He looked at Peter and then to Steve, wiping his hands on the rag.
“Fury gave me the day. He has a meeting later, I think. You know me, I’m not good at doing nothing so I thought you could distract me.” Rhodey replied sheepishly.
“I don’t normally bring my work home with me,” Steve said, “Forgive the gym shorts, I decided I should give you my full attention first.”
“Very perceptive.” Steve meant it as a compliment because it was clear Fury wasn’t the average small-town cop. He was good.
“Then you’ll go to jail, Steve. You’ll rot in a cell and never see your family again. Is Rumlow really worth that?”
Steve felt the hairs on the back of his neck stand up on end just thinking about him. He’d been in his and Sam’s unit for a mission in Afghanistan, brought in through Special Ops to act as tactical back-up for an extraction of military intel from a small village in the desert. Steve had hated Rumlow immediately, he was savage and brutal and had no regard of civilian life. He was one of the few guys Steve guessed had joined the army because he got paid to shoot people rather than to serve his country. He was proved right during that mission together when Rumlow shot 17 civilians in order to clear them a path to get the intel back to base rather than try an alternative longer route.
He started the shower, letting the water heat up before ditching his clothes and stepping under the spray. It helped, the warmth spreading across his body as he shoved his hair under the stream. He was feeling progressively more human than before and Tony decided that showers might just be the best things ever invented in that moment.
Tony leaned in closer to him, closing the distance between them until they were sharing the same air, “I would have almost been turned on it if wasn’t for the fact that orange get up did nothing for your ass.”
Steve wanted to laugh, a smile gracing his lips as Tony’s fingers wiped away the stray tear on his cheek, “Tony, I… can I kiss you?”
Buying the garage with the last of his trust fund money before Howard cut him off was a smart decision. A nest egg, as he explained to Rhodey, a way for Tony to make money and keep his hands busy. It was a sound investment and the business was actually doing alright. There was a regular customer base now and he prided himself on fast returns which gained him new customers.
The victory was clear in his face, he had gathered intel on Tony’s friends and identified them as his weakness. It was a smart move; he’d taken the time to learn about Tony’s daily habits rather than rely on Howard as a source of information. Rumlow wasn’t taking chances on this one. He wanted Brooklyn. He’d do anything to get it from Steve.
Tony had moved in a few days before, merging the small boxes of his belongings in with Steve effortlessly. It was almost like they fit together. It was natural to see Tony’s shirts hanging up with his. Their socks next to each other in the drawer. Steve would always get a soft smile when he saw one of Tony’s books on the nightstand and a notebook ready for when he was in bed and an idea suddenly came to him. Steve had given him free reign of the garage too, his own space to experiment and test out his theories. Tony had rewarded him with a heart stopping kiss when Steve had presented it to him, eyes drifting to the cars in the corner with a seductive glint. Everything seemed easier with Tony there, team movie nights were fuller with Tony curled up into him and even their disastrous attempts at cooking together were filled with a laughter and contentment that Steve didn’t think he’d ever get.
Tony sighed, tucking the rag back into his pocket as his eyes found Steve’s, “Well, that’s a conversation I’m not looking toward to. You checking up on me?”
When he was free of them and had kicked his own jeans and underwear off, he stood up to see Tony watching him. His cock was standing proud against his stomach, his thighs big and powerful but that wasn’t where Tony’s focus was.
He was moving against Steve properly then, no more little teasing rolls of his hips. Tony let himself enjoy the feeling of full on rutting against Steve, those hard lines and hot skin against his cock as he bucked his hips against him.
“Your dad’s working with Hydra, right? If Steve knew I let you go alone then he’d put a bullet in me, family or not.” Bucky replied and when Tony glanced over he noticed Bucky’s attention was focused on the window and the blurring streets as Tony drove.
Bucky wasn’t saying it to be mean, he was saying it because it was the truth and Steve needed to hear it. He sighed, knowing that if he ever cared about Tony then the smart thing to do would be to walk away. To stop whatever this attraction between them was before they got in too deep or Tony got killed.
Steve could feel himself grow hotter, blood boiling at the thought of Bucky in this place, “You’ve been waiting for me, I see.”
He winked at Tony playfully before taking a few steps backwards, “I’ll have Natasha show you out. It was nice to meet you, Tony.”
He was wrapping his arms around Bucky in a second, his hold firm despite Bucky’s protests to shrug him off. Steve held him tighter, waiting until Bucky admitted defeat and deflated against him. His arms came up to grip at the back of Steve’s shirt and Steve almost thought he felt him shudder against his frame with the effort of keeping himself together.
Fury was catching up with him now, “It places both our cops in Hydra’s base of operations when the mark was carved.”
Both pairs of eyes turned their gaze on him and at least they both had the decency to look guilty that he had caught them arguing like children rather than the gang members they were.
“And watch them get themselves killed.” Steve finished, “This guy is ex-army. He’s smart and he clearly has no issues with killing cops. We need to know who he is before we go after him. We need to know who we’re up against.”
He expected something more than this. Blood, violence. He expected a gunshot wound or an explosion. That’s how it was supposed to happen. Gunfire and glory, that’s what they thought in the army anyway.
Steve nodded, knowing that if that was really what Tony wanted to do then he’d respect it. He’d honour any choice Tony made, even if it wasn’t one he liked. Steve wanted to keep them separate. The Captain and Tony’s Steve, he wanted to have something to protect when this was all over, but Tony was right. If this was the end, then he should be by Steve’s side.
It was another week before Steve got the call from Fury that said he was off house arrest and was expected to be at the station on Monday bright and early to start work. Steve had felt a freedom in his bones and had a list in his head of all the places he wanted to take Tony now this mess was over.
Tony’s hands were moving then, clearly wanting to give as good as he got, and Steve had to admit he was thankful for the car behind him when he felt Tony’s palm press over his crotch. Steve rocked up into his hand shamelessly, partly to show Tony just how much he wanted him and partly because with every second his cock was getting harder and the friction of Tony’s hand was deliciously teasingly as he rubbed over Steve’s own jeans.
Rumlow chuckled, “You always were smart. I don’t care about them. They can join Hydra or they can leave town. I just need you to topple an empire. That’s how you did it, isn’t it? Killed Phillips, took his place, the start of a new age for Brooklyn.”
“Don’t.” Steve replied, “Don’t tell me I’m not worried about what’s going to happen. I’ve tried everything I can to get you guys out of this. I’ve made deals with cops, I tried to push Tony away, hell if I could make a deal that Rumlow only came after me then I would do it. For you. For this family. So, don’t you fucking dare tell me I don’t care about what’s happening here.”
Steve kicked him in the stomach to stop himself from shouting in frustration. He should have seen it coming. Ross, Rumlow, it was all connected. Steve had been treating them as two separate problems, but they were the same one. Rumlow had played this the same way Steve had and Steve had fallen for it.
“Fine. Our first case will officially be looking into the gang that killed Thor’s brother,” Steve replied, moving towards Tony to investigate the way more skin was revealed between the end of his seemingly too short t-shirt and the line of his joggers whenever Tony shifted, “I promised Thor I’d find answers and now we might be able to give him closure as well.”
Natasha was his family, before he got Steve and the rest of the Avengers, it had always just been him and Tasha. He remembered those days fondly despite the struggle they both had endured before Steve had found them and offered them a home. Natasha was a small strip of a girl at the age of fifteen. Brilliant red hair that grew in matted curls down her back and a smile that invited you in before becoming deadly. They had become instant friends, which was a first for both of them considering how they were raised but they had both been on their own for a while and had both been at a crossroads on where to go next. Clint was a few years older than Tasha, a point she never failed to let him forget, and if he took one look at her bare dirty feet, almost black from the grit of the pavements and decided he was going to give this girl one person at least that she could rely on then Clint figured he couldn’t be held to blame for that. As it turned out, when they had met Steve several years later, they had both gained more than each other to trust and for that alone Clint would always be grateful for the tortured soul that was Steve Rogers.
make it.” Tony spat, “And now, for once in your life, you’re going to do the right thing. You’re going to go to the police and tell them about the Jericho, about Rumlow’s plans, Hydra. Everything. You’re going to stand up as a witness against them and help get him off the streets because you owe me that, dad. That’s the least you owe me.”
And it was. Natasha and Bucky weren’t the only ones healing and it made Steve’s heart warm to see Tony so happy after everything he’d been through. Maybe now he was starting to believe there was a way through this. One small step at a time.
Tony couldn’t help but feel nervous has he made his way up to the porch of Steve’s house with his toolbox in hand. Steve had called and asked if he could take a look at a damaged car and Tony had jumped at the chance of seeing him again. It was stupid and reckless and yet Tony couldn’t help himself.
He sunk his mouth down on Steve’s cock, taking him as far as he could. He enclosed Steve’s thick length in his mouth, making an ‘O’ shape with his lips and hollowing out his cheeks before moving his mouth up again.
Steve sighed, placing a hand on Tony’s leg and squeezing, “Thank you. For everything you’re doing for him.
There was something about Bucky in that moment, so vulnerable and open that Steve couldn’t remember last seeing. When they were kids maybe? Before Afghanistan that was for sure. This was a side of Bucky that Natasha normally dealt with, but Natasha wasn’t there anymore. Even now, the distance between them despite being in the same house felt like miles. Steve could see it eating away at Bucky, and it broke his heart to see his best friend struggle so much.
Natasha was the first to speak, her voice carefully constructed and void of the emotion the sparkled in her eyes, "You want us to go for immunity?"
“The cops want an arrest for these murders. They need someone to answer for it. Fury knows it’s Hydra, he wants it to be Hydra, so I’ve been helping him shift the focus off us and onto them. To protect us. I thought it would be enough.”
The sirens came suddenly and called to him like a final bell toll. This was it; The Captain was about to meet his maker. There might be eyes scouting out the noise and he hoped Rumlow was watching. He needed him to see this. He needed him to know what the end looked like.
He wanted to retreat back to the garage in hopes of avoiding this reunion a little while longer. Tony wasn’t sure he could do it. Go inside and prepare for a fight, with Steve’s family, with Steve, after everything that had happened between them. Would Steve want to talk about it? Would he even want to see Tony now the threat of jail time was over for the moment and the focus had shifted to Hydra?
The news was reporting the start of a turf war for Brooklyn, speculating the rise of The Captain’s enemies to fill his vacate seat. Steve couldn’t have predicted this, Tony knew, this random attack where Clint and Sam just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. Rumlow saw it as The Avengers declaring war, even without their Captain. He was coming for them all now.
He stood back, stumbling with the weapon in his hand as Ross’ body fell to the ground without Tony’s help holding him up. Blood was still pooling out of the wound, so much blood. Too much blood.
“Is that my jacket?” Fury asked with a raised eyebrow. Steve followed his line of vision to the word ‘Fury’ stitched into the right upper breast pocket.
“He wouldn’t happen to be good-looking, sassy and dark haired?” Sam asked with a hint of teasing, “The guy from my bar?”
“I’ll make a few calls.” T’challa agreed, “I’ll get him released within the hour. I’ll tell them it’s for the good of the people, no one wants to see what The Captain looks like when the police start targeting his own men. If they don’t have any proof to place Clint at the murder then they won’t be able to press charges anyway.”
Steve was already awake and had been for some time by the looks of it. He was sat up, leaning back against the headboard with the covers pooled around his waist. Tony couldn’t help but notice that Steve hadn’t bothered to get dressed yet and was still deliciously naked next to him. He was also thinking too hard, Tony could see the worried etched into his features, the look of a man wrestling with too much on his mind.
There was a playful little nip against his throat that Steve shouldn’t have found as hot as he did and then it was like a dam had burst for both of them. The need and desire for each other overwhelming the teasing and slow exploration.
“Here try this.” Tony said offering the glove out to Steve, “The energy surging through that thing should be enough to give you a nice explosion.”
“I want you.” Tony replied, “Not because you’re the perfect guy. Not because you’re an upstanding citizen or the ‘smart’ choice. You see me, Steve. Really see me, in a way not even Rhodey does. The way you make me feel, I can’t even… I’m sure, okay. The sex is a point in your favour too.”
"And you really think we'd win it any other way but together?" She questioned, giving him one last squeeze before releasing him, "You're so loved, Steve. I wish you believed you deserved it."
“I’m coming with you, Cap.” Sam told him, crossing his arms, “If this is the last thing I can do to help you then I need to do it. Besides, Rumlow isn’t going to come easy.”
“If there is, I’ll find it.” Steve replied gently, “I need to focus on Hydra. If I can get Rumlow to slip up, if I can get Ross to focus his energy there first then I’ll have time to come up with something.”
As Sitwell glance across at his guys Steve knew something was off. He could feel it in his gut. Natasha seemed to bristle next to him as the same thought occurred to her and Steve was sure he could sense Bucky reaching for the gun tucked into the waistband of his jeans. Steve’s eyes were on Sitwell though, the twitch in his left eye as he ever so slightly tilted his head that way, as if trying to see behind him without making it obvious. His forehead was shiny despite the cold weather and Steve found it odd that even after being in a warm car he’d still be sweating against the cold of the night air.
Steve could feel his attempt at humour as he rounded the corner, but he couldn’t find it in him to smile. His side was getting worse and he was pretty sure the adrenaline was wearing off, “It’s because you’re… you.”
He needed a weapon of sorts, two guards outside the door and Tony wasn’t so sure he’d be able to take them on with his bare hands.
He opened the condom wrapper with his teeth, rolling it onto his length before coating it in more lube. Tony would say he didn’t need it, but Steve knew he’d be even more sensitive in the morning without it. Steve lined his cock up with Tony’s hole, tip pushing against him gently as Steve slipped an arm under Tony’s body to cushion his head and placed a large hand on his hip to steady him.
“Rumlow came after me anyway, Steve. And it had nothing to do with you. Now, Howard working for him? I can’t sit back and let Rumlow build bombs, Steve. We need to find a way to end this. To bring him down. So, I’m already in this, whether you want to keep me out or not. It’s not your call anymore.”
Steve grabbed onto Bucky’s shoulders, making sure he was looking at him, “This is bigger than us, Buck. This is bad. The cop killings, Hydra, everything is conspiring against us.”
"Before I kill you, I just want you to know why," Steve whispered in the space between them, "why you had to die tonight. Why Rumlow will fall. Why I'm going to enjoy it." He squeezed his finger a fraction, waiting for the whimper from the other man, "You went after him. That's why you're dead. You dared to go after Tony."
Steve nodded to himself, hearing music coming from Natasha’s room as he made it to the next level of the house. Curiosity got the better of him and he headed in that direction, “Get it done and email it over when you have it.” Steve replied before hanging up.
Tony’s hands started on the buttons of Steve’s shirt, opening each one slowly to expose a new piece of skin to him. Tony’s mouth followed his fingers, lips grazed over Steve’s warm skin, over each valley and peak of his chest and abs. Steve was tense underneath him, not used to having all this attention on him without being able to give back. That was good, Tony wanted him to focus on this feeling.
“I kill bad people. People who are a threat to me or my family.” Steve pointed out, “I don’t sell weapons on the black market in order to cause the most destruction.”
Tony sighed, raising his arm out in front of him and aiming at the wall. To activate the reactor he had to squeeze his fingers around the metal casing, it was a crude system but Tony didn't have the time or equipment to create anything a little more subtle.
Tony took the phone with a small nod, “Are you sure we don’t need to go to the hospital for that?” He nodded towards Steve’s side.
Sometimes Steve really hated having to call T’Challa for help. Not that he wasn’t helpful because he was but Steve hated having to rely on T’Challa to get information he couldn’t get himself. He’d been on hold for a few minutes before T’Challa had picked up and had almost blanched when Steve told him what he needed.
Steve frowned at it, crudely done with a knife by someone who didn’t know how to use one. He could see the tears in the skin where the knife at gotten stuck whilst carving.
The angle was wrong, it was too tight for what they needed. Tony was still attacking his earlobe with little bites and the occasional kiss below it and Steve could feel his ragged breath against his skin, god he was so turned on.
But after their activities in the garage, Steve had convinced Tony to take a shower before heading home because they were both a mess and he didn’t want Tony to leave like that thinking he was most sort of second rate hook up.
Steve followed his eyeline, eyes scanning the area which in mere moments had become a hub of activity. He watched as more men flooded into the main warehouse from the smaller outhouses like an alarm had been raised. Steve clocked the heavy guns each one carried and instinctively clicked his own safety off.
Steve shook his head, already reaching for the gun at his hip, "No, you guys can't be seen anywhere near this. You heard Fury; immunity only stands if you stay clean."
“You had a meeting today with Hydra’s new boss. I just need to know who that is.” Steve responded, “If you answer me honestly, I promise I’ll make it quick.”
His hips stuttered at the sudden pool of pleasure in his cock at the words, “Tony.” He moaned; he couldn’t help himself.
“Steve, you know I’m grateful for your endorsement but I’m a Congressman now. I can’t just bend the rules to accommodate the local gang.” T’challa sighed.
The door opened and drew Steve’s attention back into the room. Ross wasn’t what he imagined, he was older and his face sharper than Steve had pictured. Fury was in the room with him, taking a seat on the other side of the table to Steve without so much as sparing him with a glance. He almost looked uncomfortable to be there; Steve wondered why that was.
