"It was that or be a soldier and get drafted into making weapons. I would rather use my skills out there. And also the only way to try to investigate one of their power sources because logistically I don't know how it does it." Tony explained.
“Yes, “Tony sighed as his back finally started numbing. “I sometimes think he’s trying to be a little punk vigilante. But ends up getting his ass kicked a lot. He’s also the one that likes the vintage-looking pictures. What are you thinking about?” Tony asked as Maria looked over at the darkroom.
Edward
“As long as that don’t include me, you can give up on social interaction all you want.” Throwing an arm around Steve’s shoulders, Bucky grinned impishly as the pair started up the street to where they were supposed to meet Arnie.
And of course he was getting hard thinking about that. It was something about how Grant wrote about him. About how Grant imagined him. He would need to be blind to miss that the guy liked him.  Made him feel wanted.
“Yeah, I think you’re right,” Buck agreed. “Hey, Dernier, you want to start searching through supplies? Everyone looks like they could use some blankets, maybe some clothes, and food.”
“I don’t know how to write with this. I’m going to break it,” Tony said around the lump forming in his throat. Tony ran his fingers along the body of the pen as if it would shatter under his fingers. Rising from their place on the loveseat, Pepper and Rhodey moved to wrap Tony in a hug. Leaning into their warmth, the brunet tried to blink away the tears that had begun to gather in his eyes.
Okay, but how is it my fault that the movie made you feel emotions? I just picked it because I will watch Cary Grant in anything. I had no idea it would be about all that. Honestly, though, as soon as it started with Julie saying she was divorcing Roger, I knew it was going to be a ride. And then all the drama around if they would have a baby. And the adoption! Heavens, I wanted to throttle Mrs. Oliver for being so hard on them. But then she got them their beautiful baby girl. My heart absolutely broke, though, when Trina passed away. Poor, sweet girl. No wonder Roger and Julie were on the brink of divorce. I cannot help wondering, though, if adopting another child would have solved all their issues. But, I guess sometimes you just need to tie things up quickly and get the movie over with. I will gladly let you pick the next movie, though. Let us see if you do any better, honey.
Steve asks an unexpected question, and Tony's answer is surprising.
“She’s planning to. We talk about it on our jogs,” Jarvis smiled as he went to make a cup of tea.
Tony rested his feet on the footstool and pulled up Grant’s letter. Tony grabbed a tablet and started writing away.
I think it would be a blast to hang out with Franklin and you. Franklin and I could talk about the sciences and science fantasy until we actually make it to the moon. All else fails I design more impossible things and draw more Robot Women. Just who would we be menacing Grant?
Tony watched that for a moment and thought of winding a finger around one of the curls at the base of Ty’s neck. Tony shrugged after a moment "Whiskey sours all around then?" Tony asked, looking at each person at the table, offering a small smile as he checked for confirmation.
Tony’s eyes definitely nearly fell out of their sockets reading the question in the letter. It arrived early enough he hadn’t even fallen asleep yet.
How bad was the hangover sunshine? I have the feeling that you are aware most of the origins are either Greek or Latin, and because a bunch of scientists worked in those languages. And that sounds like a very pretty bouquet.  I hope you and Franklin ate well.
I bothered to avoid the mistletoe because the context of the events means it was a lot of people I have dealt with prior. Also because that kind of proximity with the sort of possible revelations of last year has made me leery of putting myself bodily near that many people. I’ve become leery of people directly handing me things - even packages and letters - because my brain quickly conjures up the gruesome image of something exploding or being poisoned or tampered with. But Pendragon’s friends I imagine wouldn’t know much about those sort of things, so I might not flee out the window with them.
Steve snorted. “You almost sound like you approve.”
“Either a cute blond artist who breaks his phone so often this is just easier. Or his friend who gets his phone broken by his exes throwing them. They are great guys,” Tony grinned, figuring that would probably happen if Grant or Franklin were to have something like iPhones. “They refuse to let me give them phones. So letters it is.”
“Whatever you want. I’m in an extremely complicated relationship, but we agreed that publicity would be a way to keep the press off the trail. I’ve been into old movies and some kind of pampering since my new trainer is very mean if either of those appeals to you. But I am very open to listening to what you want,” Tony offered as he spun on his stool.
After dropping off the letter, Steve settled down to start sketching different ideas for a possible mural. One of his favourites involved a diner scene, where Americans from all different backgrounds filled the space. And, of course, he was sure to draw a table with Maria and Rhodey sitting chatting over coffee. Edward was happily eating a piece of pie while seated on a stool. Arnie and Michael were picking a song from the jukebox. On a whim, Steve drew himself sitting next to Edward, leaning in to steal some pie.
Edward.
Even if you could send a record, I would not be able to listen to it. Franklin’s family has a radio, but that is about the only device we have. Well, maybe Pendragon or one of his friends would have a record player. So, I suppose I would find a way. I bet you are the type to have a lot of records that you listen to. You seem the sort that would listen to lots of music, dancing around in your garage.
Did you at least give Pendragon a hug? Sounds like he deserves that. And Grant that sounds perfect. I wish there were more spaces like that for you. Would you believe I already am across the country from Obie? Work has us travel enough it’s a little hard to avoid him sometimes.
And sure, I can draw that. Kitt being from around then would probably insist on getting him getting a haircut though, sweetheart. Or at least a really good wash. But can we compromise down to a submarine car and some really cool planes? No? Okay, I’ll try. It would be hell to try to organize traffic with flying cars. It’s hard enough with planes, Grant.
Is it weird that I miss you, even though I never met you? Because I do. Sometimes I expect to turn around and see you standing there. And I don’t even really know what you look like, except the colors of your complexion and a bit about your build. I wish I knew what face to dream about.
“Feeding a super-soldier isn’t exactly easy,” he shrugged. “I get enough to get by. Resources get a bit thin on some of our missions.”
I uh, I have some mixed feelings right now. The actress was phenomenal and I’m….shaken. The guy’s actions and wording felt so familiar. His attitude. I am reminded of Obie and that worries me.
And now that you have my eyes done, you can start on my eyebrows. They are far thicker than what you have drawn. If it would save you from serving in the war, I would get you down to the absolute minute details of my features, like the exact number and placement of my freckles. I want to keep you safe, even though I feel so powerless.
And please share your thoughts, guesses, and cooing and various other noises. It feeds us.
. It was good. Very. very good. Cary could definitely have won awards for that. And yet, somehow the film still infuriated the brunet. But first Tony had a letter to write while everything was still fresh. There was also dinner to order with Jarvis
Still… I think you shouting from the rooftops is going to be my attempt at drawing you this week. I’ve also got some small technical bits I think a flying car would need too.
“Frequently,” Tony answered, looking for the telltale braid Demi usually wore. He found her near a coat rack and tilted her head looking at Tony before she lowered her gaze a touch more.  “Demi, this is Serena, Serena this is Demi. And welcome to Steve mural 3.”
Arriving home on the second of July gave Tony time to write his letter. And the time to send it on the third. Tony grinned, looking over at his gifts again.  He was so excited for his boy to get them. And then he got distracted, staring at even more irrevocable proof it was Steve Rogers sending him birthday gifts as he looked at the photos tucked in the wallet: The devastatingly cute glance over the flowers, and the more candid shot where Tony could almost see the staring from him holding still.
Edward
When the next letter came, Steve was beyond thrilled. He had worried that Edward would get bored of him and stop writing; but, so far the consistent correspondence was nothing short of intoxicating. It helped the blond understand, at least a little, what it must be like for men like Arnie, who were able to go to the clubs and make close acquaintances with each other. It was a little bit like having his own fella.
Grant,
The cologne did not smell stale, as Tony had expected. Instead, it smelled soft, nice, like some flowery smell, and a little fruity. Maybe a little vanilla. Definitely not like it was sprayed several decades ago. On the outside of the envelope was the same writing as before, and Tony was even more confused as he opened the letter.
Steve- 1942
"Shield. It's to do with defence against potentially superhuman or alien threats."
Curling up on his bed, Steve carefully opened the envelope. He peeled the thick paper back to reveal the treasures contained within. And
(See the end of the chapter for
“Part of the effort, one of them is going to the Navy. Or actually, I think he is part of it by now. Maybe coffee? I just worry something weird would happen to it.” Tony slowly rolled himself off the couch not putting any weight against his shoulder, then moved to follow and help.
Sorry.
It was an absolutely miserable day. Everything that could have gone wrong, went wrong. From not getting picked for a job to having someone knock him into a pile of slush to having the laces of one shoe snap -
Tony set the envelope inside Ana’s writing box, tucking it safely in the empty compartment intended to hold unresponded to letters. He thoughtfully traced the edge of the envelope before closing the lid, tapping it lightly. Maybe, maybe he would ask Jarvis how to write with a nib like that. His gaze rose to the mailbox. It seemed innocuous, sitting there with its lid up and flag high. “It was a cute trick,” he mumbled at last, reaching up to lay the flag down once more. Making a last-minute decision, he opened Ana’s box and grabbed the pen. He then went upstairs, hunting for Jarvis. For a moment, as he was about to leave, Tony could swear he heard the flag move, but that was ridiculous. Probably just a trick of the mind. He shook his head before going up the stairs.
Yours. Mine. I want to yell it from the rooftops so all of Brooklyn knows I got a fella all my own. If I could, I would kiss you something fierce right now. It is what my boyfriend deserves. And I would make such love to you. Spend all night whispering in your ear all the sweet names I want to call you and listen to the sound of your heart. Kiss you until all your thoughts were of me and nothing else. Oh honey, just imagine how good it will be when we can finally have that.
Bucky snorted. “Sounds familiar, don’t it?”
So, Steve found himself seated at a table across from the pair without his usual chaperone. Which brought with it a sort of strange freedom. Because, as much as Steve adored Bucky, the man was clearly not at home among the gay men of New York. He would fidget and let his eyes wander restlessly, as though not certain where it was actually safe to look. Steve hated for his friend to be so uncomfortable, and so was glad to give him the night to recover from a double shift instead of coming out with them for who knew how long.
I’m working on a draft of my letter to you waiting for a company meeting to start. So far Obie isn’t in yet but I’d love to imagine it’s because you miraculously intercepted him on the way to his plane and beat him with a 2x4 piece of lumber. I know you didn’t you rogue vigilante. But it’s great to think about.
I was just hoping for some kind of sleep honey.

The 1940 film was almost eradicated by MGM, who tried to destroy all copies of the film so it could not compete with their release. But it did manage to be saved and you can view it on Amazon Prime!
And yes, I was warm enough. Summer in the tenement is always oppressively hot, and it seems like the season is getting started early this year. Honestly, if I am not working, I spend a lot of time lounging around painting in just my shorts and undershirt. Anything else I just sweat through.
“Hallie figures you think you might get blackmailed. Or think someone would hurt them.” She paused. “I have some questions for you that have nothing to do with this. You inherited a ton of both merch and things that might have belonged to Captain America. Do you have anything fun that you know about? Or even just fun stuff from the ‘40s,” Demi asked, cuddling her pillow.
Yours, Edward
“To you, it might be nothing,” Steve protested, “but it makes a difference to me.” After a long moment where the two men stared one another down, George shrugged and allowed the conversation to move on.
But anyway I could go on about jetpacks for a while depending on how you want to fuel them and safety. I’d rather read the Hobbit with you. There’s no harm in reading old favourites either.
Italics- to be translated as french. If anyone wishes to provide translations that would be great.
What if Pendragon does not come home? What if Mark has to go all his life, knowing he had love in his hands and it slipped away too soon?
In which the guys see a movie and it creates a catalyst in Tony's thoughts on someone in his life.
Tony sent it with a doodle of a cartoon tiger stretched out in a cage with its toes all splayed and bored out of its mind.
Hello reminder they are in the war how are you doing? Thanks for keeping up with this so far and we have lots of adventure coming up.
The chapter title is from Keane the song is from their Perfect Symmetry album.
“Got it, boss,” she answered as Tony dried his hands and started towelling himself off. He then carefully grabbed the letter and opened it as he leaned back. Tony read his letter as he turned over and slowly stretched on the couch. The garage was warm enough that his shorts had dried off already, and it was doing wonders in lulling him and helping him wind down.
The missile could wait for him.
If I could pick any time and any place to go, there are definitely painters and thinkers I would want to meet, sure. The moon would be fun if we had a way to survive there. I imagine the view is awful pretty from up there. And I would like to meet Oscar Wilde. Just to thank him. For being visible in a way that gives folks like us someone to hold on to. Because I think it is important for heroes of all walks of life to be visible so that other people, ones who are like them, can gain strength from them. And it is easy to feel strong when everyone is like you. But if you are different? Not so much.
Steve rubbed a hand over his face. “Not really.” While he had been willing to stand his ground, he knew that if George had escalated the situation there would be trouble. After all, the older man was much bigger than Steve.
-Grant
As they came up to the florist, Steve slowed. He usually only managed to buy a single carnation, but the weight of Edward’s coins was heavy in his pocket. It was tempting to simply send the money back, tell the other man thanks but no thanks. But … sending the money was Eddie’s way of trying to be there for Steve during a difficult day. Would it have been so different if the engineer were standing beside him and offering to buy flowers for his fella’s mother?
There are a couple of options for your bath. One is just something that heats the tub itself the other is a circulating system. For your situation, take a bath in a small room that will hold the heat more, bubble bath if you can get it to bubble up, it does insulate the surface of the water. And put something around your tub that will insulate it more. Now if you’re making a place you have a couple of options. One is a circulating system that uses heated tubing to keep the water the same temp you had when you were filling the tub. It uses suction to keep it circulating. The other is heated tubes that just heat the walls of the tub.
The other day, Franklin and I listened to the State of the Union when they replayed it on the radio. It made me want to cry. Here is a man claiming that everyone should have the freedom from fear, and yet how many people actually have that? Freedom from fear only exists if you are wealthy, white, Christian, able-bodied, and only seek relationships with the opposite sex. Anyone outside of that has good reason to be afraid, especially now. Do you think we will ever be free of it? These restraints we have put on ourselves - the threat of the Normal?
Your nightmares, though… Are you sure they are just dreams? That seems like the sort of thing a mind would not just invent. Either way, they seem real awful. And I am sorry you have trouble sleeping. If I could, I would pet your hair and sing you lullabies like my ma used to do for me when I was sick. That helped me get to sleep even when my lungs were trying to come out my throat. It has a way of making a body feel safe to have someone close, caring about you like that. I know we have not known each other long, but … it does not feel that way. It feels like I have known you for years; it is so easy to talk to you. And I would want to do that for you - help you feel safe.
“Captain America was either bi or gay, and he’d had a boyfriend. It completely explains all the blatant pics of Agent Carter and the compass. It was her coverup campaign to make sure he was remembered,” Demi said firmly. “Bucky was in on it too, making sure to play up the best friend part. I think the only one that knew jack squat was Phillips. Because, I mean, look at who Steve Rogers was. The only people who we see talk about his past are Peggy, him, and Bucky. There was a distinct lack of other people. Why? Because they were part of the queer community. The only community after the art community that had more queer people in it at that point were military secretaries. They had to make Steve Rogers seem like a loner to fit.”
Dear Edward,
Tony read the letter and grabbed the nearby notepad, scribbling out his reactions as he went. Tony took a few pauses as he read to go over sentences again. ‘Flustered and enthralled’; Tony nibbled at the pen cap of a handy ballpoint to keep from giggling like some school girl. And he made the guy blush. God. And then there was that amazing sketch of someone’s hands.
“Also you got the Apogee Award!”
Tony blinked and thought about how he would be coming back alone. "Yeah. I will. You also need to fill me in on more art you did with your magic fingers. Make sure I could help spread your name around.”
My ma sends her regards for the flowers. They were very pretty. Pretty, pretty, perttty. Got her bells of Ireland, because she and my dad they came from Ireland. Liek.. immmigrants. From Ireland. And peonies. Poenies? You know. Flowers. And hydrangea. That’s such a weird lookin word. Hy-dran-gea. You ever wonder about where people decide to name flowers? Because, like, do they just look at it and some fella is like “that looks like a hyydrangeon.” And everybody else is all “Yeah Jim that for sure is a hydrangeo.” So everybody just starts callin it that. Wht if someone else called it by a different name before that, but they weren’t as popular as Jim so nobody used that name? Do we just go with the popular name or the first name? Or is the first name not a real name because nobody used it?
“Tell him he can apologize by taking me out to dinner,” Bucky muttered, eyes starting to drift closed as he melted under the blond’s hand.
“If Steve Rogers was not at least 50% gay, I will eat a ghost pepper,” Serena said firmly. “I bet he was completely gay, but the whole Peggy situation makes things complicated. But still.”
Ty’s face pulled into a tight smile. “Why don’t you go get us drinks, sweetness? Make it up to us?” The blond dropped down onto his seat. “I’ll have a whiskey sour.” He turned to talk to one of the women at the table, Tony’s presence already dismissed.
And thanks for passing on that kiss. That makes me feel some kind of tickled that by a wonderful proxy I kissed Gypsy Rose Lee. And I am glad the guys are going with you. Still, I am not the happiest to hear that George to some degree spoiled your enjoyment of the place even by a small measure. And I am so glad for Pendragon. Is Mark his muse? The one who helped him come up with the composition or at least inspired it? He does sound really good to know.
Grant if you want me to handle the more raunchy things I will be happy to help. But really I am much more for going at any pace you want to set. I have a decent imagination but we have time. It’s not a race.
Grant,
“I’m a bit worried about how readily you suggest the illegal options,” Tony said after a beat.
By the time Tony returned, Ty and the others had broken out their brightly coloured little pills. One of the women was even doing a line off the table - or trying to. She kept giggling, causing the drugs to blow across the table. Ty quickly took his drink, when Tony passed it over, before pulling the brunet down beside him. "Thanks, sweetness." He took a slow slip before smacking his lips. "Come on, pet. Share one with me." Ty gave the bottle of pills a little wiggle before popping one into his mouth. He then leaned in and began kissing Tony, tongue moving to breach his lips.
It took bourbon to get to their real topic.
And Eddie… The way they were all so comfortable and intimate. I have never seen anything like it in my life. It was a place where I could imagine myself cuddling up to my fella while we talked about politics and life and art, sneaking kisses whenever we felt like it. And nobody would care. The conversation would just continue, as normal as anything. Never thought it could be like that. And I have never wanted something so much in my entire life. It was … beautiful.
He got word that if he did not choose to enlist, he was likely to face the draft. So, he decided to throw his fortunes to the Navy. By the end of the year, he is going to be assigned to a ship and risking his life for the right to freedom. And Mark … He is just going to have to sit at home, hoping for the best. When he was little, Mark was born duck-footed so bad his toes pointed straight out to either side. So, the doctors broke his legs and he had to wear braces all through his childhood. Means he got an 4-F almost without the doctor blinking. I saw his legs once; they have some awful scarring on them. Mark and Pendragon only just moved in together two months ago, and now they are having to say goodbye.
“Your date seemed to think he was entitled to those,” Jarvis said as dry as the toast on the counter.
He would have to make it seem casual, nonchalant even. But it was worth an attempt. Setting aside the sketches, he grabbed a fresh sheet and carefully planned his response. And then, fighting to keep his hand from shaking, he began to write a letter that would change things, for better or for worse.
As the pair moved to answer Lee’s commands, the brunette pulled Steve back over to the couch. “How has your art been going?”
“Just what would you have added?” Tony asked, watching Demi sit. She crossed her arms and looked up at the ceiling.
“Well, I have ones that I am looking for. I think they are going to make this far more interesting for you Serena,” Tony nodded as he took her hand and shook it.
But they wanted to park the cars higher up. Though the rest of it is actually architecture I really love.
As the lights dimmed, Steve gave a happy wiggle in his seat and nestled down into the cushion. The screen crackled to life as the opening cartoon started - the cheerful background music ringing brightly through the air. Bucky chuckled to himself while Steve laughed with his whole body, tossing his head back so far he nearly slammed it into the back of the seat. But then came the news reel. Images of the battle at Dunkirk flashed across the screen, stark in their violence. All of the laughter was sucked from the room as the realities of war - horrible and unrelenting - flashed before their eyes. And then came the film of Winston Churchill looking every ounce as fierce and stern as ever. Steve sat up straight at the sound of the man’s voice, nasal and slightly slurred:
Grant, I think both of the restaurants are kosher. If not, they serve a lot of latke and matzo ball soup for not being Jewish. But I will happily have pizza with you.
Grant
I’ve told you about my nightmares so it isn’t the easiest thing to get me to sleep. So it sounds like we follow a pretty similar schedule. I might be able to figure out something that might make it easier for your back. But I think making it would still be a little rough on funds. Or not but I wouldn’t be able to send it to you properly. There are so many things I want to help with and invent ways to help you. It's frustrating I have to be here.
Easy Sunshine. You suggested ‘Penny Serenade’ without looking at any summaries. That said it was very good so I am not actually that mad about it.  I think they were on their way to start to solve their problems, but it was running long or else I think they would have talked more before adopting their boy. For our next movie, I was thinking of either ‘Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde’ because I loved the book. ‘The Wolfman’ because monster movies are fun to figure out how they achieved effects. Or ‘Citizen Kane’. Though I am not expecting any of them to be joyous; Abbott and Costello are usually good too, and they have been doing well if we want a laugh.
Tony couldn’t stop the smile at the drawing of the little knight. The very lovely horse and the swamp he swore he could feel the humidity of from his chair. And of course Grant was hiding his face behind the visor.
Shaking his head, the blond turned to follow the stranger’s directions. They were at least easy to follow, and he soon found himself scurrying past the blue tents with their pinup girls and provocative posters.
Tony let his mind shift to Doctor Banner. Bruce would know something about monsters, though so far no one had figured out if the doctor had been able to change back from the mean, green fighting machine. Or fix that yet. In terms of Jekyll and Hyde. If there was a way to bring the doctor back, Tony would be happy to speak to him. Banner’s work on gamma radiation alone was incredible. And the fascinating idea of a rage monster, if that’s what the Hulk was, actually presenting was both alarming and … kind of cool.
Steve frowned. “I’m sorry, Buck.”
Where a plea is made and Doctors are called.
“No, I guess not,” Tony lied as he made his way to the shower to finally clean off the previous night. Did he have to go in today? He’d find out after a shower he figured.
Thanks again to Anna for the preliminary read and we can't wait for her to read the next chapter!
Grant,
Wine and a pile of blankets. You sure do want to spoil me, huh? Not that I would mind. I am bad at taking charity, because of how I was raised, but gifts to show how much you care… I think I can handle that. Especially if it means spending time with you. Nothing means so much to me as getting to just spend time with the people I love. I bet I could just sink into you for hours, barely noticing time slipping away.
I know you have the talent and skill to get a job like that. I am excited for you.
And yet…
Edward.
"Nope. Let's get you warmed up. Sparring with Rhodey will help. I know a few boxers that could keep you in good form too," Maria kicked his ass for the next few hours while Tony already missed her.
Are you suggesting Penny Serenade because of Cary Grant? Because yes. I will happily join you, just to imagine you being a mess over Cary. He’s probably going to be phenomenal. Of course now I forget every book I’ve read. Any ideas Grant?
Sitting in the living room, both men seemed to cling to their glasses as the subject, at last, turned to the subject of Edward and Maria’s deaths. “I had suspected as such. If you were along that night, you certainly would have died too. And the only person who would have benefitted would have been Stane,” Jarvis said, carefully swirling the bourbon in his glass. “If you think there were any bullet wounds or strangulation marks, then it confirms everything I’ve feared,” Jarvis said with a sigh, looking over at Tony.
Edward
Do you want any references? I haven’t actually taken a picture of Jarvis for you, have I? I’m having everyone by since Rhodey is getting some time off at last. I think he and Pepper will probably end up being the shutterbugs this time. He’s been busting his ass so much. The letters from him aren’t as often as I would like.
“Nothing beyond the usual. Are you expecting something?” Jarvis asked, raising an eyebrow over his mug of tea. Tony shook his head slowly, being careful with his body.
February was still brutal for Steve, especially when letters from Tony were just a little sparse. He understood the man had to keep up with his work, especially as Obie’s behaviour became even more suspect. But, it was still hard. Steve still missed him and worried about him. Sometimes he felt so helpless - unable to do anything to keep his boyfriend safe. So, all he could do was try to be cheerful in their letters, encouraging him as best the blond could from so far away.
“Just heard about another family event I wasn’t invited to. You’d think adults would be better than petty teenagers, but here we are.” Jarvis mused as he sat up. “So how is your artist this week?”
, could see them. George had shared a secretive smile with Steve and simply said, “Might as well see that our artwork comes from someone in the family. Got to look out for each other.” Bucky meanwhile was practically sat at Lee’s feet, listening with rapt attention as she talked about her performances. It was funny to see a woman utterly immune to Bucky’s charms. If the smile on Lee’s face was anything to go by, it seemed much more like Bucky was the one being toyed with than the other way around.
I cannot feel my face I am smiling so hard right now.
A few moments later, he felt the warmth of a hand on his shoulder. Bucky had moved to crouch down beside Stevie. “I think you’d approve of this fella, Mrs. Rogers,” he said, his voice far steadier than Steve’s. “The way he makes your boy glow is like nothin’ else. And I know you always wanted Stevie to be happy, whatever that looked like. We just wish you were here to tell him that yourself.”
Steve meets someone new through the letters.
"You are the one with the flight, I am also going to work on some drafts and can block the light from you better here," Tony explained with a grin. There was also the text from Rhodey to read and reply to.
“How best can I make sure Obie gets nothing in a will, Jarvis?” Tony asked in December with screens surrounding him as Jarvis watched the Dr. Who Christmas special. He’d managed to leave the Christmas gift unopened from Steve until after they ate.
“Make it hard to focus when you keep moving,” Morita grumbled then looked at the huddled masses. “Guess it’s time to raid the supplies that were meant for their soldiers.”
Oh dear god. Tony hadn't hallucinated the flag on the mailbox moving.
expects you at dinner Friday night. Y’know how she gets about
I respect that.
“Sure I can,” the brunet declared. “What, you goin’ to come over here and try to beat me to take it, huh? I’d like to see you try.”
Steve- 1941
“You did more than a good job, Arnie.” Steve leaned easily into the hug, careful to not harm the drawings. “Guess now I owe you a favor, don’t I?”
A particularly vivid blush settled on Steve’s cheeks. “Um. For my date. I can’t seem to find where I’m supposed to meet them, though. The photo booth?”
“Boss this is a weird hobby,” Friday quipped as Tony settled into the sketching.
“He’d have to be, to keep a job like that with the economy bein’ what it is,” Bucky agreed. “What else he say?”
In what world are these pictures something you send to a friend?
Nodding, the brunet tipped his head back in a pretense of checking the weather. “Seems reasonable to me. Kind of him, too.”
I uh. I could be happier in other parts of my life.  A person I spend time with, for all that they reassure me of interest and feelings, I find myself reserving myself.  I talk them through discoveries, and they tell me to calm down or it's not that big of a deal.  I have to argue for things that are for my own health and safety.  And I end up under the influence of things I keep saying I am avoiding.  And I am so frustrated by all of this.
“He’s been in California for work,” the blond said simply. “He’s an engineer, and that is where his firm has him working. But we write as often as we can.”
-Grant
“I’ll have to see it. Was that all Mr. Stark?” Pepper asked with a little lift of her voice.
“That’s fair, captain,” Tony nodded. He knew for a fact there was nothing ever mentioned of any omegas with them so he would have to be discreet. “Even if they did, it would be easier to keep me unmentioned.”
The screen had gone to a screensaver by the time Tony emerged from his thoughts.
“It was left-over from my nephew’s gifts,” Rhodey said firmly. Tony bit his lip; like Tony, would be able to stop himself from buying fighter jet wrapping paper if he were to be in a place that sold such a thing. And use it on every gift he would give Rhodey while the roll lasted.
PS- Watching a movie for my birthday. I'd love to talk Angel Street with you. Tell me your thoughts
Tony’s next pick was a musical comedy called
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony- 2007
You did great for it not being your usual style. I cannot say I blame you for your admiration.  Ben is amazingly talented.  I am looking forward to seeing more from you and your art. Everything I see of your work just makes you feel so real to me. That I can find your art more places than my letters. I am so damn happy for you right now.
Finally, after what seemed like a lifetime, Tony was free. He hustled off to the manor to change into clothing more suited to walking around in the freezing 60-degree weather. (Tony was a California boy to the core.) Once wrapped up in a sweater, scarf, and peacoat, he climbed into the back of the car so Happy could drop him off at the appointed meeting place. When they finally arrived at Arthur Avenue, the brunet was out of the car before Happy could so much as shut off the car. “I’ll text you when I need a pickup,” Tony called, slamming the door shut before the man could reply.
And thank you for helping me imagine a future where people like us could get married. Where they could adopt. That would be more amazing than I have words for. Honest, I have hope that the world will someday be ready for that. Imagine how many children will be in good homes, then. And how many families that will build. Sure, they might not all be perfect, but it would be more honest. More real. I would move heaven and earth to make that happen.
Tony rewrote the letter quickly trying not to think of how he’d imagined that Grant had been the one with him last night. It was hitting things that felt too close to cheating for him to be comfortable. He sent the letter and worked on how to bring up at least talking to Ty about why he wasn’t happy. Grab some flowers or something, a new tie clip.
“Morning, Michael. Need a hand with those?” He nodded to the cases the taller man was carrying.
Michael, who was carrying the redhead’s supplies, simply shook his head. “Mornin’ Steve.”
Bucky was surprised how quickly Steve recovered from his illness. It was almost as though the letter had reignited the spark in the blond, giving him a reason to fight through. And it was a good thing, too, as the brunet was able to land them both shifts in a factory. It wasn’t the kindest work, sure, but it at least wasn’t anything that would kill Stevie - especially as the blond was set to painting watch faces. The money was good enough that they’d be able to cover the rent for Steve’s apartment if they pooled their wages, and if they were lucky the factory would keep them on even longer.
Grant, I feel like you’d be the one to reach for me in your sleep and as long as you don’t dig any elbows into me I would like that. I can nap nearly anywhere though. I should probably sleep after I get this sent. Wonder if my dreams have a better image of you than I do when I’m awake.
He looked at Tony, his eyes all sparkly and bright. “That was me,” he agreed gently. And took a little step closer to the omega. “Arnie, Michael, and Buck were seated at the same table. You’ll have to look again when you go back.”
Where there are reactions, publicity stunts and plans to be made.
“Boyfriend and good. We’re getting into summer, so the seasonal depression he gets is improving and he’s out working on murals,” Tony grinned “I’m making a bot so I can write letters by sort-of-hand from anywhere. I’ve also just realized I should probably keep the tech for myself. If I include a routine that in any way records what I’m writing, that could become a forgery bot pretty quick.”
"I don't doubt that.  I just need a bit more time before I want the shit kicked out of me.  Why is she here so early?" Tony asked, throwing a couple slices of bread in the toaster.
“Stevie..” Bucky gave his friend a strained ghost of a smile. “Watch the picture.”
Wishing and hope are all the things we have sometimes, Grant. Don’t give up on that. And don’t give up on me. I think my friend group is way more flexible than you give them credit for. And for getting strange looks about being in my company, so what? I’d get strange looks anyway. You won’t always be starving. And with a bit of grease and less posturing I’d blend in so well anywhere that if you didn’t know my face, you wouldn’t see me.
-Grant
Tony's letter is well received.
Tony combed his hair and mechanically went about putting on what counted for “decent clothes” for the club scene: a v-necked t-shirt, a blazer, and a snug pair of jeans. He moved through the evening as though he were performing the half-hearted steps of a dance that had become so common it had lost its shine. First, slipping into Ty’s car and staring out the window as they drove to the club. Then, breezing past the bouncer and straight up into the VIP lounge. And the night then fell into a blur of substances, high-pitched giggles, sloppy grinding, and too bright lights. But then came the worst part of the evening: taking Ty back to his place.
Arnie laughed a little and pat Steve firmly on the back. “Lee, Carson. This is Steve Rogers and Bucky Barnes. Steve is part of the invalid contingent. You two would get along, Carson.”
It took a little practice before Jarvis and Tony are able to work out something legible. The writing is not as practiced as the hand on the letter, but it is passable enough. When Tony brought the pen back to his lab, the flag was raised. Tony stared at it, knowing for a fact no one had come downstairs. Tony opened the box, finding a letter inside. He blinked. Turned away. Looked back in the box. Somehow, the letter was still there.
The next morning Tony drafted a letter to Grant as he waited for Breakfast to arrive with Demi. “You text him?” Demi asked with a little chuckle as she sipped a mimosa.
“Thanks,” Tony replied, watching how he moved. This still felt surreal. “It’s how I made myself feel better as a kid. Build something, take it apart. Fix it. Make it better. I’d steal things, educate myself on anything I could get my hands on.”
If my family’s friend was like us, I would feel for him. Even history won't acknowledge the full man he was. But, what's interesting is he is responsible for a small tradition my grandfather started. We were given a name after someone in his life - I can't remember if it was a family member or friend of his.
“The Howlies have a knack for that.” Steve shot the other man a wry smile. “If you come with me, I can see that you get food and a blanket. Reinforcements are on their way. Should be able to help get you where you need to.”
Gabe nodded. “Yeah. What landed you in a hydra base here?” Out of the corner of his eye, he carefully watched his captain. After all, it was said Steve could smell a lie.
Steve had known what it was by the smell of it. The air was rank with terror, pain, and the putrid musk of omegas in distress. He had ordered the Howlies to put on their gas masks, just to avoid triggering any rages among the alphas, and then they went in. It was somehow even worse than the scent had belied. Cramped cells, filthy omega bodies, and a nursery packed with neglected infants. Once the Howlies had secured the base, Gabe radioed for the Swiss and medical teams to come in.
Have you made any plans for fall yet?
“Yeah definitely,” Tony squinted a moment watching as Morita came by.
I mean, if a few of the models do want to go at it… I’m actually not sure if I’d want to. But we’d talk. Or at least just figure out a deal for appearances, because that’s what this stunt is about. Once I figure out how to get Obie out of the company and my life, in a position where nothing he says holds any leverage over me, there are going to be changes made, sunshine.
Stopping short, the artist stumbled back into the doorjamb. “That’s kind of you to say. I don’t think I’m much to look at if you ask me.”
Shrugging, the man curled in close to Steve’s lean body. “It’s fine, Stevie. They’ll come back around.” It went without saying that Bucky knew, sooner or later, he would land in the military. And then the women would be interested in him for all the wrong reasons. The men tried to not talk too often about the draft or the war, just because it made Bucky mercurial. “So what did your boy get ya, anyway?”
And then he saw something that made him nearly fall off the bench with laughter. A man sitting on the lip of the fountain was completely caught up in pontificating to his companion some nonsense about the economy and the uncouth younger generation. Had he been less caught up in himself, he might have noticed the large, finely feathered raven that had steadily been hopping closer and closer to him. And, while the man was insisting that “the youth of today” did not understand the value of hard work, the raven managed to get its beak around the chain attached to the very fine silver watch slipping out of the man’s pocket. With a few jerks of its head, the raven managed to snap the chain and danced a few steps away with its prize clanking along behind it. The bird was the picture of joy as its sparkling treasure swung down the side of the fountain, and Steve grinned as the raven spread its wings wide as though it was showing off its accomplishment to the world. Something in the impishness and cleverness of the bird reminded the blond of his boyfriend, which gave him a spark of an idea.
For Tony, it mostly showed in working on project Chronos every spare moment. He had nicknamed the time travel project that after having been inspired by watching the Salvador Dali and Disney collaboration, “Destino.” Which led to yet another way Tony’s love bubbled over into every corner of his life: The List. The short film just one of the many items kept on The List to show Steve when he made it to the future - something of a pop-culture catch-up. It even bled into building a friendship with Happy while talking about classic cars. He couldn’t help thinking of how Steve would be in awe over each vehicle, and maybe even how much he’d get along with Happy. And almost without realizing it, Tony would talk about wanting to take a friend to places like the national parks, art museums, and concerts.
Edward,
“He had to have made a living as an artist somehow, and you don’t get that being a hermit. Why hadn’t more people been called forward? Because something was being protected,” Tony mused as he stretched out on the couch. He glanced at their tidily piled dishes and then the lamp.
“You actually have everything else pretty covered. Jen appreciated the almond milk. And there was almost enough fruit to make up for the lack of muesli. Thank you,” Demi slowly moved out of the pose and kneeled on her mat.
“They must. Especially with how you been fixing things up.” Steve glanced over at the shorter man. “But still. It’s impressive.”
I could talk for ages about my friends; Grant, are you sure we want to go into this? Rhonda’s cooking has made me rethink my stance on faith. And interesting you bring up your friend being Jewish. My grandfather was Jewish. My father had a complicated relationship with it, and I wasn’t raised into it. My birth parents died while I was young. I guess here is where I’ll answer about what lead me to being an engineer.
“Yeah. I have my alarm set. But you support this?” Demi pondered, watching Tony move to the couch.
If turning twenty-one had been a disappointment to Tony Stark, then twenty-two was an absolute bore. He had everything a man his age was supposed to want: influence, power, money. At the snap of his fingers, a jet would be ready to fly him anywhere in the world, where he could party the days away in whatever fashion a young man could possibly imagine. And he was never short on company. Whether it was handsome models, beautiful actresses, ingenious scientists, or calculating CEOs, Tony always found someone (or several someones) to entertain him when he had a need for it.
“For some buff Amazon, sure. You are only in there for five more minutes, Tony. Don’t get too comfy,” Maria muttered as she started pulling on a shirt and hoodie over her top. Tony set the letter aside on a nearby table in a maneuver that would have made him swear like a sailor a few minutes before.
“I accept that proposal.” They shared another quick kiss before Benjamin turned his gaze back towards them. “I’m Ben and this is my companion Peter. Why don’t you two sit down? Make yourselves at home.”
Losing time whether it’s to liquor or sleep is bullshit. The only thing that comes from them is attempts at damage control. I’ve lived it. It sucks. I’ve thought about hibernating the winter away like a bear, but I can’t quite do it.
“Friday, baby you have got to have something new for me here, honey,” Tony asked desperately as he put the letter under the fume hood.
My Eddie,
“Eh, Ed’s an okay guy. Might as well help you both out.” The brunet hesitated. “I’m glad you two got everything worked out alright. You seem a lot happier.”
Watching the omega’s hands, Buck was pleased to see that he seemed competent. “I know how that goes. Sometimes working with my hands is all I can do to keep my head level.” His gaze moved to scan over the huddling masses of pregnant and injured omegas. He frowned to himself, thinking of what would happen to his own omega if she were caught by Hydra.
“Just an observation. There is more to life than what your doctor suggests. Also because I craved muesli, and I had to settle for Special K with a ton of fruit instead,” Demi answered with a frown as she took a deep inhale and pushed herself into a full handstand.
“So since you’re not going to be my employed trainer, are you going to ask Pepper out?” Tony grinned as he watched Maria scrunch her face.
Honestly, you know I would have hit Obie with a piece of lumber if I could. I hope the meeting went alright. Any fun new innovations you and the company are working on?
Grant,
“It’s my hobby. I try to read up as much as I can from the ’40s and memoirs of that kind of thing. My job and volleyball got me before I discovered my love of that era. Otherwise, I might have become a historian,” Demi chuckled before sipping at her wine. "I will look that up later - February House."
On a day-to-day basis, he had loved his job. He loved inventing, problem-solving, showing ideas off and fix-its. He wanted Obie out of his life so he could do that again; to be able to move forward finally. Once home, Tony started a bath, shoved his dirty clothes into a basket, and dumped bubble bath into the water. He could feel the way every muscle in his back was wound tighter than a spring and needed to do something about that before even trying to train with Maria the next day. Tony nodded to himself as he made a plan to do some brainstorming after his soak.
I think you are worth reading, and writing to. It sounds like you’ve been kind of adopted by Franklin’s family. Speaking as someone who’s had two different families pseudo adopt him, do you find that it’s really hard to say no to their cooking? Because my friend’s mom, Rhonda, makes miracles happen. And also tells me you’re a good person. People want to care for you, which believe it or not is a good thing.
Steve: 1940
Edward.
-Grant
And that there was another letter from Grant, which always added another good aspect to a day.
A day in the base.
Travel Times
“Yes ma’am. I’ll uh, I’ll do that. We’ll plan more tomorrow. But yes, I think he’ll like it,” Tony nodded as he shivered a bit. Maria left the moment he started emerging from the tub and waved a short goodbye.
Her eyes widened. “The ginger and the other guy were boyfriends?” She gave a little wiggle. “My specialty is queer art during World War II - it’s what I love. This confirms my theory that Steve Rogers was closer to the queer community than official reports would have people believe.” Serena slid into the cab while Tony held open the door, happily bouncing across the seat. “Today is the best day ever. Do you know what kind of breakthrough this is? What it will mean to the queer community?”
Demi: Sure. If you can get them all on, I don’t see why they’d say no.
It is kind of funny, how you see yourself blending into my world. But we both know there would never be a place for me in yours. My sweet bird, you fly so high while all I can do is watch from the ground.
If you want to think I am gorgeous, I suppose I cannot stop you. But I can start to question your taste. I bet you are the type to wear garish suits and ridiculous accessories, like some sort of flashy peacock. In fact, I could see you strutting around in a purple suit, swanning around like you owned the place. Then again, maybe you do own the place. Seems your style.
I am serious that I can just get Franklin or someone to read it out to me, if you do want to go faster. The last thing I want to be is a burden to you. I wish I could read fast or there was another way to read. Listening to radio programs is something I really enjoy because I can sit and listen while I draw. Sometimes I even draw comics for the stories, because I like them so much.
“Then I wish you luck,” Jarvis smiled then chuckled. “Perhaps he’ll end up like Jack, fixed point and all.”
That night, long after their fine meal and Steve’s consumption of far too much liquor, the blond was unable to sleep. Sitting at the kitchen table, he stared down the glass of water on the table; his thoughts a muddled swirl of alcohol and sorrow and self-loathing. And every once in a while, like a flash of lightning through the thunderclouds, thoughts of Edward would pierce the gloom. Which was what probably led to his somewhat unwise decision to snag a piece of paper and light the small lamp on the kitchen table. The page swam across his vision several times as he wrote, causing the letters themselves to be far less precise than they usually would.
Edward
In the first sketch, the viewer seemed to be walking in from the kitchen, coming through the double doors towards where Steve was sleeping. The angle not only showed off the fine lines of his figure, but also the comics on the wall and the view out the window. Second was a sketch that seemed to be looking down at Steve’s prone figure from the foot of the bed, allowing the eye to move from his toes all the way up to where his face was hidden behind his shoulder. Then was a sketch taken more from the level of sitting at the end of the mattress. It meant that the primary focus was on the way Steve’s ribcage joined his back and the curve of his arms. But, just over the shape of his bicep, one eyebrow and a gently closed eye could be made out underneath the mop of his hair. The final sketch must have involved Arnie standing on a chair, as it was looking down from above at Steve laying out on the bed. In that sketch his face was completely hidden by his hair and shoulder, but Arnie had taken pains to mark out some of the most prominent freckles running down Steve’s back.
“If you think you saw it, I believe you. Are you looking for something to do right now or do you need to be held longer?” Jarvis asked, keeping his hands gently on Tony’s shoulders.
"I will see what I can do. But I mean your art. The costume is marketing itself but you have a lot of talent." Tony explained, definitely making note of the name. He stepped a little closer and nudged Steve with his arm “I’m going to need Arnie’s last name for that. But I’m serious about talking about your art. I want to hear more.”
“Friday do I look like Cary Grant?” Tony asked with a small laugh - just out of sheer silliness.
Hello again.
As the evening oil burned into the early morning, the group finally began to wander off to bed in ones and twos. Eventually, George gestured for Steve to come with him. “I will show you to your room. You need anything to sleep in?” As they started up the steps, the brunet gave Steve a glance up and down.
A laugh almost slid past Steve’s lips. “I will be sure to tell him you send your warnings. Eddie was pretty impressed when I said I’d met you. He’ll be honoured to have been threatened by you.”
“Maria gardens?” Tony asked following behind his dad.
When Bucky dropped the package in Steve’s lap, the blond nearly choked. “What the – Buck! You punk!” He kicked out at the man’s leg, missing entirely.
But, as he looked at the display again, Tony noticed the blinking envelope surrounded by blue. Dum-E had set another letter in the basket. It had taken way too long for him to work out the bugs in that.  It had also been too long since he'd been clear headed enough to code for extended amounts of time.
Grant.  I am becoming an old man at 22. Save me.
Sitting down beside Steve, the sculptor wrapped an arm around his shoulders and drew him into a hug. “I know how much this fella means to you, so I wanted to do a good job.”
-Grant
Bucky hesitated a moment before grabbing his kit and passing them both over. “You work with weapons a lot?” he opted to ask, rather than asking what was really on his mind.
. The zany antics of a sailor trying to win the heart of the cold “Countess” of the swing club in just four days was certainly entertaining fare. Steve’s cheeks hurt from laughing so much, and Tony couldn’t help feeling bad for the poor Countess when she found out her beloved had been bet to woo her. But, as things did at that time, everything worked out for the best. The sailor fell hard for his dame, and she ultimately forgave him. It was not lost on Tony the irony of his choice of film.
But it was a hollow sort of pleasure that had quickly burned out of his system. Because, in the cold morning light, the people were always less beautiful than they had been the night before and the easiness of the booze had burned out of his system. The emptiness of his life always left him feeling unsteady, like he was a sailor coming back to land for the first time in months.
Grant,
I am grateful for Franklin’s pop, though. He is a real good guy, and he did his best to help raise me. Taught me and Franklin how to shave, though I almost never need it. He tries to help us find work, and he told us how to be safe when getting with dames. But it is different, you know? He will never quite be mine.
“Took the better part of three months. I think he’s hiding out behind you watching Ella Fitzgerald.” Tony explained watching Demi frown before tilting her head, then shifting her entire body.
You cannot just call me that out of nothing. I made the most ungodly sound, and Franklin thought I was dying. Honestly, so did I. My heart just about beat itself out of my chest it got going so fast. Hope you will not mind that I kissed all over a page for you. Just imagine that is your face because that is exactly how many kisses I would have to give you if you ever said that to me in person.
“Says I sound charming,” Steve said, fighting back a smile.
“Some writers and performers. Artists. Fun people.” Arnie smiled. “I think you might even recognize some of them, Buck. Come on, it’ll be fun.”
Edward
“Again, that heart of yours Jarvis,” Tony murmured softly before taking a slow sip. He let out a soft hum at the taste before stretching out carefully on the couch. “So I think I need to start distancing myself from him. I’ve never let him in the lab, but I have shown him projects. Maybe I should slowly start there.”
But still! Can you believe it? And if I do well enough, they said they should have more murals for me to do around the city. They are trying to get more up before winter hits, and I told them I would be happy to do as many as they wanted me to. Just one mural pays well enough for my rent, groceries, and a little extra to set aside. If I could do them regular, I might be able to get more art supplies - paint and chalks and such.
Moving through the hall, Steve stood next to the omega as he tinkered on a broken radio. “Want to patrol with me?” he asked in a gentle murmur. “Get some fresh air.”
I’m trying not to make it that long for you to wait for me. Responsibility is a mean, mean thing and I’m trying to be responsible. I’m really stubborn too so we’re going to have to watch for that. I mean Obie isn’t young but he’s still sturdy and annoyingly healthy.
“Yeah. Yeah, that would be fun. If nothing else Grant gets some new art references,” Tony pondered as he sank further into the tub.
The blond thought about it for a moment. “If you go to New York, there’s a couple of my pieces around. I worked for the Public Arts Project for a few years,” he explained. “A couple of murals.”
Dating just for dates and social interaction was interesting. Without substances or the push for sex, everyone did become that much more interesting.  As Tony worked through the calendar starting with May, it became clear this approach to dating led to far more interesting friendships. And requests for second dates. The most surprising was July: a statuesque six-foot three-inch blonde with long, long arms and legs that had tried modelling on a whim. Demi played volleyball, trying to go pro, and seemed like the type who should try acting.
"Goodnight then, Tony," Demi said as she nestled herself into the bed.
Sorry, I have never done something like this before. And I honestly cannot remember the last time I wrote a letter. But maybe you will be patient with me?
Pyrone: This is one of my favourite chapters so far. That during our editing kept getting pushed further ahead. Until now. I was just so excited for Anna to finally read it. And then more people to read it
Tony cradled his shoulder a moment as he stood -  it was still tender from that morning's beating. Maria had been having to correct him less and less, and it was becoming more drills rather than new movements. So that was something. But it also meant she tended to go a little harder on him.
For his own birthday, however, Tony wasn’t sure what to do still. He couldn’t get away with a low key event like his previous year. So, he paced his lab in thought as he waited for the sealer to dry. Tony walked the length of it and back five times before receiving a text.
“It’s over in Cobble Hill. And I’m more than happy to give you as much time as you need.” She hesitated. “I will warn you, this one is considered to be in danger of being lost. The city has not allocated money for its restoration, so it is in rough shape. Probably because the lay of the block changed after the mural was completed, meaning it is tucked back into an alleyway. Most people have no idea it is even there.”
Tony read the note quickly double-taking as he looked at both the message and what was apparently multiple pieces of art all rolled carefully. Multiple pictures of Grant done by his friend. The engineer thought he was getting one, but there were
he thought.
“Is Grant your complicated relationship?” Demi asked as they watched the credits for the next movie Tony had queued up.
“Electronics, weapons, vehicles, I’ve been taking things apart and putting them back together since I was a kid,” Tony answered calmly. “Making things, and fixing them it’s how I put myself back together.”
Yes. Yes, put us in that mural. Grant, I would adore that.
“It’ll look better that way! Trust me. He’ll love it.” Arnie carefully went about selecting the pencil he wanted first. “Come on, Stevie. Light’s a-wasting.”
And February House has seen some changes. People moving in and out. Since the war broke out, things have been a bit … tense. Nobody wants to talk about it, but you can feel it boiling under the surface. Then again, that is true of everywhere. Especially with the draft looming over everyone. For whatever reason, it has made us create even more frenetically. Like we are all trying to get as much art out of our bodies, just in case.
Shuddering through the tears, Steve leaned into the bulk of Bucky’s warmth. He was not entirely sure he believed what Buck said about his ma, but he desperately hoped it was true. That she would support Steve and that she would approve of Edward. Because… there was a very real part of the blond that thought he could fall in love with the engineer. The more he knew about the man, the more in danger his heart became.
“You’re just fine,” Arnie said with a laugh. “Means you look real relaxed in the drawings, so it works out swell.” Taking them off the board, the redhead passed the sketches over. “Figured you might like a couple to pick between. Plus it was good practice for me.”
“I’d appreciate that,” Tony nodded then paused. “It going to be okay with them though?” He didn’t want to fuck with any dynamics but had to be sure.
I want you to be safe too, you deserve every chance to do well. I think you should get some sun every chance you get. It would be good for you I think.
A small smile flickered across his lips. Edward had a way of talking - or writing, rather - that made the tension ease from Steve’s body. He would never admit it, but it was just as soothing as sitting beside Bucky while the brunet read a book out loud. It felt a little bit like home. And the comic! Sure, Edward was not a perfect artist - sometimes his proportions were off and his figures felt a bit stiff - but there was a charm to his style. Steve could easily imagine
When Buck delivered the letter, he had to fight back a smile at the way the blond lit up like a firecracker at the sight. “He wrote me back?” Steve asked, all but flinging himself at his best friend to grab the letter.
His dick was expressing vehement opinions, and what was he going to do about that? Not that this was the first time, sure, but this response was a direct correlation to what Grant looked like. How was he supposed to keep things platonic when everything about those sketches screamed something more?
Once the pair were gone, Steve crawled back into his shorts and undershirt. He then carefully rolled the four sketches up and slid them into a protective tube Arnie had left with him. After all, it would not do for the sketches to come to harm on their long journey. He then quickly wrote out a short note:
A frown worked its way across the thin lines of Steve’s face. “I think that’s for me to decide and not you, George. And even if I did not have a fella, it should be enough for you that I am not interested. I respect you as an editor, and I like to consider you a friend. But if you aren’t willing to abide by that, then that’ll be that.”
Utterly flummoxed, Steve could barely manage a nod. Why hadn’t Arnie warned him that W. H. Auden was going to be there? And then things truly became surreal. As they moved into the parlor, which was dominated by a large marble fireplace, Steve and Bucky came face to face with even more famous faces. Draped out on one sofa, a glass of sherry in hand, was a brunette bombshell with eyes that seemed to simultaneously know all of your secrets and find them laughable. Gypsy Lee Rose. Curled up beside Lee was a little wisp of a woman with a prominent nose and a long, round face.
Steve shot him a small smile. “You sound a lot like me when I was small. Except art instead of engineering. The number of times I’d borrow an art book, study it, and slip it back into the shop… Bucky would kill me if he knew.”
And writing you back felt vital to me. I didn’t want you to think you were unwanted any longer than I had already made you feel involuntarily. I’m glad I made your day brighter. Your letters have been a bright point for me too. Your sketches are beside where I store my pens and letters; they look perfect on the wall.
Because Tony thinks that by not putting his year in his letters he is being sneaky.
Your insomniac engineer
When Steve still hadn’t responded, Bucky frowned. “Stevie?” Going over to the glass door, Bucky gave it a good shove until it popped open. He sighed at what he found. Steve was still alive - thankfully - but he was also an absolute mess. The man was stripped down into his undershirt and his boxers, just sitting in the windowsill staring out at the very stimulating fire escape. His hair was matted with sweat to the point where it looked brown, and the strands clung to his forehead like they were trying to meld with his skin. While the undershirt had probably been white once upon a time, it was now a dingy tan color that Buck really didn’t want to think too hard about. And Steve’s skin. This meschugener looked like death itself: Clammy, pale, rail thin, and utterly miserable. “Should I tell my ma you did die just so she can come over here to beat some sense back into ya?”
Also, if Jarvis is as good as you claim, someday we need to trade. I will send you something Franklin’s sister made if you send something from Jarvis.
I want you to take care of yourself, Grant. I don’t do great around the week my parents died. My nightmares act up really badly unless I drink. And well. It’s a lot of drinking those nights. And use the change for whatever you need okay? I can’t be there like I want to. But I can do this at least, right?
That is how children get suffocated. Put the baby in something then put it on the bed.
Later, with some editing, Tony rewrote the letter with a smile. He threw in a sketch of Grant frowning as he chewed on the end of a pencil; going all out for a single sketch with his hands and shoulders.
And we are in unfamiliar water for me too, sweetheart. I’ve never dated anyone by letter. But I think we are on the right track with the movies and taking the time to share things. And in a way, we do nothing but talk like this.
“That’s because they are the most fun and lead to you seeing your guy sooner.” Demi scrunched her face before shoving her mat back inside a bag he’d hadn’t noticed before now.
Sweetheart,
Maybe a movie or something can help us forget about the month if it’s in your budget. Just let me know okay and we can figure out something else to share or do.  I’ve got a library pretty close whatever is easier Grant.
Grant,
As the brunet leaned in for a kiss, Steve braced one of his long-fingered hands against of the other man’s chest. He twisted away, breaking the contact altogether. “It’s very flattering of you to offer, but… I have a fella.” Steve tipped up his chin and stared the editor down.
Italics indicate when they are speaking in another language. For the time being, assume french.
“Your cereal selection sucks by the way,” Demi muttered, opening her eyes. Tony looked up and offered a small smile as he rested his arms on the back of the couch.
Yours,
Tony sat a minute theorizing about the twenty-one-year-old: Brooklyn, artist, gay as hell. The guy would be fine. He would have made some friends with other artists on his own - maybe even in his art classes. Surely one of them would have snatched up the cute kid, making the letter hopefully obsolete. Tony finished reading it with a small smile; the kid had a way with words. More fight than one body could stand. His first thought was of either an angry kitten or a chihuahua. And if this Grant guy lived up to that, he’d probably punch Tony in the face for that thought.
“Not sure why I got put on medic duty today but here we are. There’s nothing wrong with your legs right?” he drawled inspecting Tony’s arms and neck. He did poke at the healing scratch on Tony’s forehead and examined it with a small squint.
. The detective fiction story he was assigned was a bit gruesome, but some part of Steve relished the chance to draw something different. And the editors loved Steve’s stark use of colours so much that they invited him to do the cover for July as well. Arnie had to ultimately help the blond pick the right shade of red for his work, but it ended up turning out swell. Steve ended up sending Tony copies of both magazines when they were released. February also saw Steve choosing an Abbott and Costello film called
“Perfection, Stevie. Is it alright if I move the sheets around a little for a better aesthetic?” Arnie took a slow step towards the bed but waited for permission before moving to adjust the bedding. By the time he stepped back to the board once more, the sheet was still tucked under Steve’s hip on one side. But the other side spilled off the bed in a dramatic swath. The fabric gathered neatly low on the blond’s back, showing the small dimples there, and cut asymmetrically across his thighs. With his head resting on his crossed arms, Steve’s back was twisted into a rather lovely arc that led down over the hill of his hip and along the slope of his legs. Even his toes were slightly pointed from how he had stretched, enjoying the sensation of it in his muscles. “Now just… stay there,” Arnie commanded.
Nah, see, it does not count if you are not there to share the meal. You would specifically have to take me out for food for it to be valid. Since you only sent me money to get food, it does not count. Them is the rules.
“Yes, you know I do since I am curious how this is relevant to the theory,” Demi answered firmly.
How about this?
It went about as he expected. With Ty half heartedly rocking against him with a well argued for condom; a condom Ty had vehemently argued against. Tony was at least bodily relaxed as he glanced back at Ty, but his mind was flickering through a myriad of thoughts - never quite settling on what seemed wrong. Tony grunted a moment as Ty finally slid in. He was so drained when a thought came to him: it would feel better if Ty did something besides grip his hips. Perhaps it was whatever cocktail of drugs they had had that night, but maybe ... maybe maybe the sex would be better with someone who had narrower hips. A smaller frame.
-Your Grant
“Ready for Jarvis and I to school your friend?” Maria grinned as Jarvis followed with a smile. Maria waved her fingers ominously and Tony couldn't help but grin.
And Franklin being a judge of anything seems dubious to me. But, he sure loves to eat. As long as it is Kosher, he will put it in his mouth.
Tony started up a playlist Friday made of musicians that were playing around in Malibu during 1941. Yawning, Tony sent the letter after a rewrite. In it was also a small doodle of Sir Grant napping on his helmet. The brunet was getting better at both designing and drawing armour of all kinds, which, at least to him, was pretty cool. He’d even managed to do a decent tree the knight was curled up under.

Shrugging a slim shoulder, the blond smiled. “I dunno. Heard the play was real good from some of my friends in art school. When I heard it was gonna be a picture, I thought it would be good to see it.” A wicked smile danced across his lips. “Plus, if it’s as scary as they say, you can always bring one of your girlfriends to see it sometime.”
“Yeah,” Tony figured it was as good of an answer as any. Especially since ending up here his goal had been to trash it. “Was gonna make a hell of a lot of trouble, but it looks like you guys are beating me to it.” Tony finally stood and sighed heavily. He’d been looking at Steve Rogers for at least 40 seconds and he wasn’t vanishing. That really was Steve Rogers. He’d known that voice in his sleep. In all his twenty-two years of life, he spent far too many years listening to Steve Rogers.
“So now you’re accusing me of lying?” Ty narrowed his eyes at Tony. “Is that what this is?”
On the back he writes, “This you yet? Not that I’m eager to go to war, just I want to know.”
I wish so many things. In fact, it almost feels like all I do anymore is wish. I wish I could see the way a smile moves onto your face; I wish I could hear the sound of your laughter; I wish I could show you the places I love best in the city. But the thing about dreaming is that eventually you have to wake up. You have to accept that they might never come true. And sometimes I wonder … how long will it be before you and me have to wake up and face reality. The world you live in is so different from mine. We would get strange looks for walking around together, since you seem to be a posh celebrity and I am little more than a starving artist.
I can only imagine Franklin tripping over himself. Gypsy Lee Rose truly is something else. And every minute I imagine the place, it sounds more and more dreamlike. They wouldn’t bat an eyelash at all at any little affections. Imagine dancing somewhere like that. With whatever music suited the whims of whoever was around. That would be great.

After the standard rewrite and wait Tony included with the letter was a small picture of the wall where he had been placing all of the gifted art. A sliver of the mailbox hanging on the wall near the painting could be seen. He figured it wasn’t a big deal, because it could barely be seen.
"It was started by my aunt, so I’m familiar with it. She stepped down from the role, though.  Does that make you want to change your mind?" Tony asked with a little grin.
“You and me both,” Steve said with a laugh. “Not sure how many more disasters I can take before I just give up on social interaction.”
Moving through the halls, Steve kept an alert eye out - just in case any hydra agents had slipped past the first sweep. “Running with my pack isn’t much of a place for an omega,” he warned. “We don’t have heat rooms or products for it.”
appearing in the newspaper cartoon section and how everyone would love finding out what new mischief the little knight got up to each week.
“So you’re going to write him again as a reward for surviving getting your ass kicked, aren’t you?” Maria predicted tilting her head. Tony watched Maria squint and then slowly get up from her chair. “I can arrange a couple of joint sessions with both of us training you if you go with Happy. It would give you a good transition for it. Just make sure to schedule in some firearms time, and you should be good,” Maria nodded making her way to the front door. “I’ve got some training courses to do, so I have to cut it short today. Have fun with your artist.” She waved and let Friday engage the door lock.
Smoothing down his hair as best he could, Steve went down to the street and walked far enough to catch the trolley. At Pacific Street, he then got aboard the subway, cramming as best he could against the wall to avoid the press of the midday crowd. A quick switch to the West End El, and in a (relatively) short time, he had arrived.
Just need a minute to calm down.
“Got it, boss”
Also, a project finally has a name.
I still haven’t heard anything about the doctor by the way. It’s taking a lot of things to keep me from going stir crazy. So thank you for the new hobby. I don’t know if he’s alive or dead. Still. He is an amazing researcher. I really enjoy how he does his papers. He has this great bleak sense of humour but still manages to be positive somehow?
So, have the murals treated you kindly? I’m going to look for them the next time I’m out there. I also have lots of options for reading and we did talk movies. That said. Have you landed anything new for covers at all yet? Enquiring minds must know.
“Yeah. The fear and the stress, even with the rescue, won’t go away. Because they have experienced it,” Tony kept his mouth shut after for a moment thinking of how many of those that were rescued had the hardest time pack bonding to newer or strange alphas and betas after the war. “Finding bonds after the war with new people would be insanely difficult.  That kind of trauma just doesn’t go away.” For some of these people, Tony realized, the only bonds they’d have are those formed out of shared trauma.
Stopping at the edge of the table, Tony looked at the Grant folder he’d made after the Ty-proving-to-be-an-asshole thing. The lists and files of things he was going to show Grant and introduce him to the new world. His tour guide to the future. Then there was the folder of enquiries he had meant to get Friday to answer. Things he had yet to research but thought would interest his boyfriend. Things that felt a little hopeless once he knew who was on the other side of the mailbox.
And I would love references of you. Have yourself eating a piece of pie. Maybe send me a picture of Ana, if you have one to spare? I can paint her in there with Jarvis. If you would not mind my doing so. Nice thing about a mural this size is that I have plenty of room.
And Tony’s delight at realizing from this, that ‘Rosie the Riveter’ was a bold young Jewish woman who could bake like an angel, made him giggle for days. She shaped the apples into roses when she did her pies Steve had described.
That startled a little laugh out of the blond. “I guess. But I ain’t even sure how to ask him. Or what to say to him.”
Before the lights could come on, signalling the start of the photograph, Steve lifted the flowers so they covered the majority of his face. Only his eyes, which were sparkling with impish delight, peaked over the top of the bouquet. He held as still as he could until the lights clicked off, signaling that the photo was complete. Steve let out a slow sigh and hopped off the chair. Parting the curtain, he stepped outside and waited by the little slot for the photo to appear. And, when he heard the distinct little clang of the metal frame hitting the tray, he nearly jumped out of his skin.
Steve worked feverishly, using his downtime between shifts at the factory and doing little posters for the war effort as best he could. By the end of the week he had finished his project, and while it was not perfect, it was certainly a gift meant for Edward. Steve had transformed the leather jacket into a rather swell wallet. On the front it had decorations and designs lifted from Eddie’s doodles of his robots; Steve wanted Dum-E, Butterfingers, and U worked into it somehow. All of the patterns served to create a frame around a quote Steve had liked when he and Edward had been reading
The boyish woman gave him a devilish smirk. “I should hope so. Question your taste if you hadn’t, hun.”
And your painting is stunning. Franklin’s family is gorgeous. And I’ve got the painting in a frame now. You can’t stop me.
I hate this time of year something fierce. Sometimes I wish I could just go to sleep and wake up to spring. Or just never have to wake up at all.
I’m going to see the movie tonight. So you have to imagine me sitting in the lobby scribbling my reaction on a notepad for the next bit.
As for your question … I’m probably not reading that properly Grant. It could be my lack of sleep, but I’ve read it three times and it’s still asking what it’s like making love to someone. So I’ll answer it in the contexts I can think of.  If you’re meaning that kind of intimacy where you know, it’s shades being drawn and suggestive looking skis. I’ll write about it. But it varies depending on the person and relationship you want to have with them.
Steve had never come alive so quickly in all his life. “A letter?” His voice was practically a warble it flew past his lips in such a hurry. “From…?”
Sitting in the club was … nice. Loud. Smokey. But nice. It was one of the few places he felt free to look around at men and really admire them. Nobody would punch him for staring at their shapely rear or pick a fight for being “unnatural.” Instead, he could just ogle and enjoy himself. The scenery would be better with Eddie in it, some traitorous corner of his mind added. But Eddie was not there. And, if Steve were completely honest, would never be there. Sometimes he wondered if Obadiah were real at all or if he was a cover Eddie had invented to keep Steve at bay. Sighing, he sipped at his drink.
Smothering a yawn, the blond shook his head. “Nah. I should be fine sleeping in my shorts and undershirt. As long as I got enough blankets, I am pretty easy to please. Poor circulation makes it a bit rough to stay warm at night.”
“Is that even a question anymore, Buck?” He rolled his eyes as Bucky ruffled his hair. “Got a bottle of the cheap stuff back in my room. Probably go through most of it, if I can stomach it.”
Take care of yourself, please.
The anniversary of Ma’s passing is coming up soon. October 15th. Usually Franklin and I go to Mass, because it would have made her happy to see me going to church. I pray for her soul. Though, if I am honest, I cannot imagine God turning her away. Unlike me, she was good and faithful. Me … Well. People like me are only really fit for Hell.
And family… Well, that is complicated stuff. I am real sorry that your folks were not the best, especially your father. He sounds like he needed to be caught less on the past and focus on the present. If nothing else, being sick has taught me to treasure each moment I get. Doctors thought I would not make it to adulthood, and I sure had a lot of close scares. So I am grateful for each moment I get. Makes me fight harder to keep going, I think.
“Yeah, I’m going to have to get this coat cleaned so we’re not walking anywhere for a bit,” Tony nodded making a quick call for a cab. “I’ll see about getting the front desk to send it out before we try heading into the bar.“ Tony gave a quick grin as the cab arrived a few minutes later.
“Yeah. It’s a lot of complications I can’t really talk about. Distance, space, time. That I am in a near-constant state of paranoia and fear for my life. But I can’t bring him into this any further than he is,” Tony admitted as he watched Demi nod along. Tony paused the credits to watch at home later.
So, rather than the lavish, brutal party from the year before, Tony settled on celebrating his birthday with a more intimate get-together. Just him, Rhodey, Pepper, and Jarvis. The way it was meant to be, except for the still painful absence of Ana at Jarvis’ side. Two years later, and the grief still felt so raw.
“Darling you don’t even know,” Tony whispered as he read Grant’s letter. He felt a lump form in his throat about the Northern Star comment. He’d always interpreted Cap’s True North comment to be about some unattainable goal, but this... He was his punk’s unofficial moral compass. He’d have to work on maintaining that.
Steve had been right that it would be difficult to arrange to see the movie. But, Bucky was nothing if not a miracle worker. Well, more like a self-sacrificing idiot. Either way, though, Steve was mighty grateful for him. The pair splurged on dinner at the local diner before heading to the pictures, settling in to watch
Fuck.
And it had dawned on him one night while elbows deep in the Shelby Cobra. The safest place to grab Steve would be from the Valkyrie. But how?
A robotic nod was the only response he got.
Sitting in the windowsill, the artist pulled his blankets more snugly around his shoulders. Sure, he was wearing enough layers he should be fine, but with his frustratingly delicate health it never hurt to be too careful. Plus, the shorter days did something awful to Steve’s mind, drawing shadows around his thoughts. It was in one such slump that he decided to write to Edward. Perhaps the promise of a letter would keep him from fixating on a date looming large in the coming weeks.
I wish you didn’t go through that. Neither of us deserved that shit. Neither of our moms deserved it. Been trying not to fall back on the bottle as much. It might be a family curse. Nothing you or your ma could have done would fix it. The same goes for me and my mom. So October and February are bullshit. Throw in December for me and we will have a quarter of the year written off for bullshit. Sounds good.
I seem to keep adding you to every mural I do. Maybe that will just have to be my signature. You and me, caring for each other so much if you only know where to look for it. Guess that officially makes you my muse. Which is why you get a ridiculous little sketch of you acting like my muse. I had to make some guesses about your build, but I figure you have been getting even more toned working with Maria. Something tells me you got real fine gams, babydoll. The kind that would make me stutter. I can only see so much in those photos in the handbook, but I have a strong feeling about it.
“Of course. Just hang on a moment. I’ll walk you to the door, too.” Moving back into her room, she went to her closet to grab the items for Steve. When she returned, she passed them over with a wan smile. “And I know, you’ll get them back to me when you can. Just don’t make me come chasing you down to get them.”
And that was when he noticed the envelope Bucky must have left on his table.
But you are a light to me, Eddie. I am so grateful for you. Sometimes thinking of your letters is the only thing that gets me up in the morning. I hope you are well. And that you are able to find something to bring you joy. God knows one of us needs it.
Some tutorials and reading lead to a picture that Tony wound up liking in the end. Steve smudged with vibrant colour holding a chalk pastel as he looked to be stepping back from a picture. Tony sketched the vibrant grin he pulled up from the Ella Fitzgerald concert and then had fun with the colours. The blues and greens with only a few hints of magenta served as an added surprise should Steve revisit the picture.  Tony sealed the image and looked at the small box he’d gotten to hold the gifts. It was nothing much: copper wire in a couple of different gauges, needle nose pliers, a wire cutter, and lastly a pin vice to make twisting the wire easier. Tony wrote a small note that explained how to use the vice.
I just hope you get to see them, Eddie. Maybe I will have to paint some of your friends into it, just to give you extra good reason to come see them.
Bucky rolled his eyes. Steve was such a diva. “I could,” he agreed easily. “But if I did that, I’d also have to write someone a letter. Tell ‘im you died afore you could read what he had to say.” And because Buck really was a punk, he pulled the letter out of his back pocket and gave it a tempting little wave.
Grant,
Steve chuckled at the way Edward jumped to match his level of weirdness. It boded well for their ability to be friends. After all, what was life without the chance to laugh together? Acting on a whim, the blond grabbed a sheet of paper and did a stylized drawing of himself as a knight, drawn to scale. His armor was dulled and the finery on his horse tattered with wear. The tiny knight leaned into the bulk of the animal as though its black body was the only comfort he had in the world. Around them Steve filled in the background with what looked like a particularly awful swamp. He was, however, also very careful to leave the knight’s helm firmly on so his features could not be seen.
Honey.
“What do you mean, Stevie?” Arnie slung an arm over Steve’s shoulders, drawing him close for a bit of a cuddle.
The man gestured to the parts of the frame laid out. “
And I was sure to pass along your kiss to Lee. She had no shortage of words with George, and I have been making sure Franklin or Pendragon or Mark go with me to February House. Oh! Mark is Pendragon’s boyfriend. They met through letters and only just got together about a month ago. I think you would like Mark. He teaches school, whittles, and loves to sass Pendragon. He is actually quite a bit like if you put my personality and Franklin’s into one person. It is nice.
Steve’s heart ached for the mysterious brunet. Losing your parents was bad enough, but to lose them under such circumstances? And it honestly sounded like Edward’s father was a real piece of work - the type of person Steve would get into all kinds of arguments with. Reading the obvious pain in Edward’s words made Steve wish he could gather him close into a hug. But, that was one of the difficulties of their communication: they could not even share a secret smile across a room. The Brooklynite wondered if they would even meet or if letters would be all they ever had between them. His heart ached a little at the thought of feeling so alone for the rest of his life.
With a frown, Steve began to set pen to paper.
Ps. The count is 150“
Grant,
He was also able to do art for a magazine that had only just gotten off the ground:
Reaching into her bag, she pulled out a packet of tissues and passed them to him. “If you need me to, I can.” Turning, she looked at the mural. “... It’s so sad to see it that way.”
“The initials under Steve’s are EK. They’re supposed to be EK. Because those are the only ones he knew,” Tony said while he dabbed at his eyes. He blew his nose and threw the tissue into an open dumpster. “I need a drink,” Tony let his shoulders slump and watched Serena look over the mural not knowing the story.
Well that’s handy to know. I’m glad he likes the mitts. And I did remember that, or I thought I did, about the proportions of your hands. Something about the hands of someone much taller? I am glad I remembered that. And I appreciate knowing that now, thank you.
Shrugging, Steve shifted his weight from foot to foot. “I guess? Any particular way you want me?”
But, I have taken to heart your advice about Maria. I cannot encourage her in person, as I am on the opposite side of the country. Instead, I have included a drawing she might like. I based it on a story from one of the books in the library about this poet named Sappho and the lady she admired. I felt like it suited Maria, and I hope she likes it. Sometimes all it takes is courage to see a future with someone and act on it, you know?
A bright smile turned her lips. “That is adorable that he would include his friend in the mural. And I am sure you can find out more information about him. Information on Steve Rogers might be classified, but Becca Barnes Proctor will be at the Captain America event in Brooklyn in February. She would probably know who he is.” Serena hesitated. “Actually, you could probably just contact Mrs. Proctor directly for that kind of information. I bet she would talk to you.”
“Oh shit.”
I hope your trip to Vegas is going well. Is it as bright and amazing as everyone always says it is? Franklin always jokes about wanting to go there, but I am not sure I would like it much. What do you think: should I add it to the bucket list or not?
But I don’t mind the thought of having a meal with you too. I would enjoy it.
Why is that so much to expect from the world?
Sunshine, Grant, you can't control your nightmares but you have just made a decision for me. There is nothing wrong with your intelligence.  I don't think you are alone with that difficulty with letters and numbers. But there are ways to make that easier. Including yes, having people read things to you.
Gabe gave a tiny wave before burying his face back into Jacques’ blanket. Steve chuckled softly. “If you need anything, poke your head into the hall. One of us will be along in a few minutes.”
Grant,
And honestly, I am glad you had Jarvis. It sounds like he was a better father to you than your blood father. What is he like, your Jarvis? If I were to ever cross paths with him, I want to know what I am getting into with meeting someone so important to you.
The answer ultimately came the next day. Sitting on his bed, back against the wall, Steve looked at the myriad of sketches strewn across the blanket. He had been trying to draw Arnie and Michael standing next to a jukebox, but nothing seemed to be coming together right. So, he had switched to trying to draw Rhodey, based on the photos Eddie had sent. But somehow, entirely without Steve’s noticing, the drawing became of the engineer instead. He had sighed before simply giving into the urge to draw Eddie in as many different ways he could think of. And by the end of the afternoon, he had more sketches of the man than he knew what to do with.
Tony nodded fervently with each name, his grin growing. “Bucky Barnes went with him and Barnes was tripping over his own feet practically over meeting her,” Tony explained in a way finally getting to share a story he’d been bursting over for years.
The alpha looked closely at the shorter man. “Will … you recover from your time here? Did they hurt you?” Pure concern laced his voice as instincts to protect and comfort surged. There was something about Tony - about his eyes, about his scent - that called to him.
Stepping out onto the porch, Steve pulled the slicker tight around his body. “I’ll be sure to, Lee. You two would get on real well, I think. He’s almost as much mischief as you are.”
Tony watched Demi blink rapidly and momentarily sway. “That’s me yes, you’re the historian Tony’s been speaking to. It’s, it’s my pleasure to meet you. And Steve mural 3? Is this a Steve that I have theories about Tony?” Demi raised an eyebrow. Tony could tell right away Demi was more content to look at Serena and fought back a laugh. Here he was in the impossible position of loving a man he hadn't even found a method of speaking to and nearly everyone else around him was finding love. What the fuck was this shit?
While Steve would not be able to give his fella a leather jacket – the kind of quality Eddie deserved was far outside of the blond’s budget – the thought did spark another idea. While the jacket he was holding was not suitable to be worn, there was enough good leather it could always be made into something else. The idea of buying a fresh pair of pants completely slipped from Steve’s mind as he carried the jacket up to the counter, passing over his meagre collection of coins in return. He would have to ask George if he had any sinew thread he could spare, as that would work best for sewing the fabric. And he could ask Dinah or Winifred to help him with the actual design. Oh! And he could ask Penny to help him tool designs into the leather; she was an art school friend of his with a particular gift when it came to that sort of thing.
“I need to do this or I won’t be able to help them out,” Tony said quietly. “It’s really hard to focus with all of that,” Tony admitted. Too many bad memories associated with the stink of distress.
He wanted to yell at whoever desecrated the mural but it would be a pointless endeavour. It would be pointless to hurt whoever had scraped the EK off the wall. It was him. And he’d waited this long to see it. It was Steve sharing this dream that was timeless and intimate. Tony pressed the heels of his hand against his eyes as he wept. If he wasn’t able to get Chronos to work he was going to have to let this go. He’d never see Steve.
Maria is applying for a new job because she's trained me to the best extent she can in her opinion.  She's going to be out there as best she can. We are working on getting me someone who will keep me in fighting shape. But she did get the means to contact Pepper whether she knows it or not. I put Pepper's number as a reference for her resume.
Mary and all the saints, though, Edward certainly had an imagination! He was clearly a futurist with a wonderful ability to see a multitude of possibilities. A time-travelling stone helping the knight find what he had lost felt … uncanny, though Steve could not put a finger on why. And the Edward of the future, with his quiet advice, made the blond’s heart ache a little. Someone of his own. That felt impossible, if Steve were honest. But maybe, if he were very lucky, his own Lord Kitt would someday be ready for a joint adventure. It was a sweet fantasy if nothing else.
Murals.
My safety has been a mixed bag for a lot of my life. But yes I agree: it is awful. The place is successful so he could afford any number of things I’m keeping busy to try to maintain my head. And well the next easiest option would be Manhattan for my work, I figure. But that is where he stays. I stay here because it’s the farthest I can be from Manhattan while staying in the States. Nothing good happens in Manhattan.
Because, I will be serious with you, honey. I just want to be yours. Whatever form that takes, I want to be yours. The way I feel about you has only grown the more we have written, and it survived the awfulness of last year. I would wait a hundred lifetimes if it meant I got to be with you, Eddie. You have become my northern star.
“Your ma make bread?” Steve fought his second drawer open and found a fresh pair of skivvies.
Also, I get where you come from, in wanting to off Hitler preemptively. Makes you wonder just how much evil in the world would be averted if you had. A woman on the first floor of our building stopped receiving letters from her sister in Bulgaria a couple of weeks ago. They are real worried. Last she heard from her sister, the Jews were being gathered up for something. Franklin’s Ma says that it is never good when a government starts gathering up a single group of people, but especially not anybody associated with Hitler’s government. With each month that passes, I cannot help wondering what sort of evil we simply are unaware of behind enemy lines. Who is paying the price while we sit here, claiming this is not our war to get into? It seems like the whole world is at war, begging for our help, and all we do is wait around for something to go wrong. And I bet it will. The Japanese and Germans and Italians will not just let America sit back and do nothing; that would be a strategic error. Better to strike us while we are complacent and unready. If I were the president, I would already have prepared our defenses and started training troops. Make sure every needful thing was in place so we could be successful.
I don’t think loving those we do is a sin. Love is a decisive motion that is guided by faith and trust in people. Something like that. If we were put here to love then I don’t think there’s a sin in following through on any actions of trust. We should not be guilty of thoughts, only actions. And if they are actions born from kindness, of something good. Then there is no sin to them. The action of loving someone romantically, the decision of deciding, yes, yes this is the person I want, is something that is between themself and the person in question. God and the church have no damn business getting in there.
And if a place serves that much latke and matzo ball soup, I am sure Franklin would be alright. After all, why serve that sort of thing if your primary audience cannot eat it? Maybe if you ever get back to New York, we can go to both places. Matzo for lunch and pizza for dinner. Seems like an even trade to me. Plus we could ditch Franklin when we went to dinner, and I could keep you all to myself for a little bit.
“Good luck finding them,” Tony muttered, clearing his throat. He shuffled a moment and smiled.
And yeah you’re right. So just a touch bushier? Maybe it wouldn’t hurt for you to try to fiddle with them, I’m sure Frankie can offer you some pointers. I’m pretty good at occupying myself, be it sketching out designs, working on time travel, or trying to work on gathering evidence against Obie. Also looking for the wayward doctor who had the Jekyll and Hyde incident. Though not too hard on that last one just in case he doesn’t want to be found.
As Ty loosened up further, he leaned further into Tony. A wicked little smirk played its way around the edges of his lips, and by the time they left for the evening, the man would almost seem to be in good spirits. Or as good as he got, anyway. All Tony remembered was the dull throb of the alcohol and the pills when he woke up the next morning - his body heavy from dehydration.
Eddie,
I also want to meet Leonardo Da Vinci. And yes definitely Oscar too. That would be such a blast. I think there are more heroes waiting in the wings. We just need to give them time, Grant.
“Get someone to teach you perhaps. And I think once you learn, you’d be really good at it. You probably have better than average senses so you could make better shots or know sooner if you’ve caught anything depending on the trap.” Tony mused. “But I think you’d still need rations and all. But being able to supplement it would be helpful.”
Also, I have no idea how to be someone’s fella. The only dates I have been on have been doubling with Franklin. I want to do this right, but I have a feeling we are going to have to figure out what, if anything, we want to change between us. I do not even know how to write dirty letters; would not even know where to start. Just … figured I should warn you.
I’m looking forward to those doodles you’ll make from up there. It’s funny to me, that in all of this, I’ve been the one sending you more art. But it’s fun; it’s something keeping my hands busy. And Grant I will take you up on that suggestion to make Kitt and Grant futuristic. I will also make traffic plans and routes to keep collisions from happening - maybe not this letter though. But I will because if you are planning a new mode of travel, you have got to consider safety. I actually really, really like that idea. Them pinging would help but you have to make sure people actually know how to be careful if something fails.
Trying to decide on a gift for Edward was giving Steve all kinds of anxiety. He knew, without a doubt, that the engineer was wealthy. It showed in the way Eddie casually paid for some movie dates and the size of his garage, not to mention the 1932 Ford Flathead Roadster that was the man’s “hobby” car. Steve, on the other hand, tended to barely scrape by most months and didn’t have a lot of money to spend on gifts for his best guy. Which meant he had to get a bit more inventive.
Though, nothing was stopping him from printing with it. Just more small movements. Tony got pulled from his programming and tinkering by both the familiar clanging and Dum-E going to get the letter. “Yeah, okay now would be good for a break,” he muttered to himself as he looked at the mess of torn paper and nuts and bolts and wiring from messing with the pressure sensors.
What wasn’t helpful was his imagination pondering just how much Grant would bruise up from all the marks Tony wants to leave on his skin. Tony sent the note and drawing before he made his way straight to the bathroom for a shower. And if there were a few groans in there as he stood under the hot water…  Well. That was between him and his hands.
Yours, Edward
Tony bit back a yawn before pushing to his feet, teetering a little before he could start towards his projects. And then he saw it. Movement out of the corner of his eye. Turning his head, Tony stared in abject shock as the little flag on the mailbox completed its upward movement.
Steve’s eyebrows arched at the four different drawings. “You’ve gotten a lot better since anatomy class.”
I should stop.
Steve shrugged. “I sketch when I can. One of the agents does her best to keep me stocked with paper and pencils, at least.”
Sitting, as best he could, at his desk, Steve carefully pulled out a fresh sheet of paper. He typically saved the blanks for his artwork; saved up his money to buy as much as he could when things were steady. But Edward deserved something better than a hasty note scribbled on the back of a flyer or something. Staring down at the crisp white paper, he considered how to respond to the man. In some ways, it was more nerve-wracking to actually respond to someone because it felt more real than those first two letters. And so, while he thought about what to say, Steve began to sketch the familiar shape of his own hands in the bottom corner of the page. Finally, he returned to the top and began to write.
Vegas is usually pretty great, I liked China and Japan when I was roaming them more. I like prefer being on coasts more - being near the ocean instead of landlocked. But with the shows out there it is worth adding to the bucket list. I like gambling once in a while, only because probability is fun math when it’s dice.
“Yeah!” Tony smiled walking to the set and the mats where he had already set up the camera. Beside the mat, Jarvis set up one of his digital cameras in conjunction with Friday. And then the three of them went right into the demonstration.
Love.
Serena finally tore her gaze away from Demi in order to stare at Tony. “February House?” She was practically vibrating with excitement. “That meant he must’ve met George Oliver! Wait, did he know Carson McCullers? Peter Pears?” She drew in a slow inhale before breathing out, “Gypsy Rose Lee?”
In August, Steve finally had good news to write the brunet about. He rushed into his apartment and immediately set to work, trying to keep his hands from trembling with excitement.
“Ah yes. The true family shots. Ana would probably have gotten a kick out of Maria. They both garden. Or at least Maria aspires to.” Jarvis chuckled softly as he slowly moved to the kitchen.
So, Steve was pacing in his apartment, waiting for Arnie to show up with his pen-pal-lover Michael in tow. The blond had asked for the men to come together, much to Arnie’s surprise. Steve would not admit it, but he found Michael’s presence soothing – plus it might distract the redhead from teasing too much. When Steve met the other blond for the first time, they got on like a house on fire. Where Arnie was all flash and flame, Michael was grounded and steady. It created a balance that made Steve feel more comfortable, as it curbed the redhead’s party urges and led to more days wandering museums or galleries. Michael was a math teacher by trade, but it was clear he had an artist’s heart with the way he spoke so thoughtfully about symbolism and beauty. It was easy to listen to him speak in that rich, molasses voice of his for hours as he peeled back the corners of the universe for consideration. He even enjoyed talking science with Buck; the two bandying theories like it was a game of tennis.
Edward
Pendragon says you are welcome. I am paying him back for it by doing a portrait of him and Mark like they are fancy aristocrats. They plan to hang it up in their bedroom, once they manage to get an apartment together. And yeah, Mark is his muse and probably the best thing that ever happened to him. If they could, I think they would get married at the drop of a hat. They will probably have a small get together at one point, where they celebrate their love and all that. A wedding in everything but name and legal paperwork. I know Mark wears a token Pendragon made for him; it is a really pretty necklace with their initials and some lovebirds on it. Pendragon clearly put a lot of time into it, and you can see how much he loves Mark in how much attention he crafted into every last detail.
Tony beamed and delighted in the shade of red he could see Steve turn in the faint lights around the base. There was seeing the man in black and white photos and full-colour paintings. And then there was seeing him moving and in real life colour that just lent to the charm even more. He was so fucked. “So you were just as handsome then as you are now?” Tony grinned a moment. He couldn’t keep that bit of flirtation back.
The brunet sighed. “Can’t. Ain’t got a dame right now. Seems like all they want right now are army fellas. Think they’re real heroic or something.”
She learned it through a friend and is making sure I can hold my own should Obie try to send someone after me. Her name is Maria Hill, and she is kicking my ass.  So, in regards to that, I am happy.
“I am an artist,” Steve defended. “I know pretty when I see it. And I’m seeing it.”
Welcome to even more universe divergences. Where Reed Richards is a medical doctor as well.
“When his phone works. I write letters to be really sure. I just draft them on my phone,” He watched Demi get confused, flip to amused, then settle on a soft little smile.
Nibbling her bottom lip, Serena gazed up at the blond through her eyelashes. “Tony introduced me to two of Steve’s murals earlier today. If you ever have the time, I would be glad to show them to you too. But… apparently, this bar features a mural by him too.” She finally really looked around, noticing how the mural wrapped over literally every single wall. “Oh my… Tony. This is … The entire thing was him?”
I will say, your most recent drawing is the closest you have managed to do of me. Though I usually do not have my hair in quite that much of a mess; Pendragon had insisted I roll around on the sheets. I still am not sure why he wanted me to do that. It made Mark smile, though, so I have the distinct feeling it was probably something that would make me blush if I knew.
“And now it’s yours. She knew how you loved watching her write. There are instructions in there for refilling the ink, though I know you watched her avidly. There are also instructions for ordering similar papers to what she has. She would have wanted you to have this. I have no use for it,” Jarvis said softly, fondly if Tony was being really honest. Tony opened the case to look at the pen: vintage green and black spattering in a beautiful pattern that led to the sturdy nib.
Steve went to the zoo one afternoon, sketching the various animals and people he saw walking around. Tony took his camera with him to Paris, London, and Iceland. It had been tricky to manage photos that looked timeless enough to blend with a 1940s eye, especially given that Steve’s time was at war, but the engineer managed somehow. He had even twisted stories of his actual business meetings to better fit the events of World War II, which in turn led to him doing a great deal of reading about the time period. Tony had the feeling that, by the time Steve Rogers went into the ice, he would be an expert on the conflict and its historical impact.
My dearest sir - no, too formal. Greetings? No, that is even worse.
“Thank you,” Tony nodded, finally managing a proper breath. “The research Steve did for the bar was fantastic. The concerts he listed making his way to see were amazing. I can’t wait to see them knowing what I do now,” Tony said with only a little tremble in his voice.
went wrong. By the time Steve got home - wet and miserable - he just wanted to curl up into a ball and cry. But, he knew his ma would not be impressed by that choice, if she were still around. So, he carefully changed into fresh, dry clothes and lit one of the burners on his stove to make a cup of tea.
“I have no idea if that would even work. But you’re seriously okay with me researching time travel while we’re watching the Doctor Who Christmas special?” Tony chuckled a little. He rubbed at the bracelet that sat just under the cuff of his hoodie sleeve.
“Happy Birthday, Tony,” Jarvis said with a prim nod and a small smile.
I did most of my celebrating before the week of Christmas because I can’t sleep that week. I usually drink a lot to try to sleep, but I was trying to avoid that this year. Safety. So what I did was attend some parties and make sure all of my group got their gifts early. I sometimes decorate for the holidays, but only if I’m hosting. So this year was pretty quiet, honestly.
Tony paused in his writing  a few times as he looked at his couch. Yeah, affection between two men wouldn’t be out of place in the February House. None of them would look twice as he’d pull Grant close and wrap him in a blanket. There might be a laugh as Grant would probably grumble and shift them around so he was the big spoon. A little man with the fire and spirit of a man of at least six feet was how Grant had been described by friends. But Tony tried to shake himself from the daydreams of holding that gorgeous spitfire close. What was it with Tony and impossibilities?
“The comparison has been made a few times in several articles, boss,” Friday answered as Tony blinked rapidly for a moment. Well shit.
Eddie,
Tony pulled out the exploded view of a watch he’d drawn in the midst of a trip. He double-checked it for parts that wouldn’t be available in Grant’s time and adjusted a few lines. Checked again for any dates, which there were none. It was a small enough drawing he didn’t need to fold it. A rewrite of the letter in ink and Tony wrote R46S for the address before setting the envelope in the box.
Tony and his date sat in a hotel room at the end of August watching
Making you that guide wasn’t that difficult, I have a friend with a bookbinding machine, and I do my own picture developing. Some bits of affixing combined with both Maria and I writing by hand took a week - since we see each other for a few hours at a time daily. She was happy to have the project. If you could somehow convince Maria to be less shy about speaking to Pepper in regards to her crush we might get somewhere. You getting the shit kicked out of you less would be great. Though you were looking nicely unmarked for those drawings. Mind you, I couldn’t see your knuckles. Would I have wanted to see those?
Sad hours.
You want to drag me time travelling, huh? Sounds like a lot of commitment, if you ask me. Usually, a fella at least buys me dinner before he takes me through time and space. Plus, how are you expecting to pluck me out of Brooklyn if you do not actually know where I live? The borough is pretty big, after all. A guy could hunt around for a long time before he found me. You do not even know my name. Or what I look like. If you went asking after a short, skinny, blonde guy, people around here would give you funny looks.
“Thank you,” Tony answered both in regards to the toast and getting his watches back from the thief. Tony rested his head against the counter, riding out the wave of nausea. After a careful bit of breathing and some sips of water, Tony carefully nibbled at the toast. “Did you see if we had any mail this morning?” Tony asked casually, wondering if Jarvis had noticed the mailbox at all.
Tony wrote it out scrunching his face a little as he imitated comic sans again. But figured if it would make it easier for Grant it was worth it. Wasn’t like he’d finally gotten used to handwriting with the Conklin pen. Oh well.
"You're welcome Ty," Tony answered, shifting back slightly.  He did not sign up for this. But well. At least he wasn't hiding it. Was the pill an upper or a downer? Tony wondered as he watched Ty continue to play tonsil hockey with the woman. He wasn't sober enough for this.
Tony sat not even able to snap any pictures yet as he read the Italian he didn’t know Steve knew. He closed his fingers trying to focus on something else. Trying to pull himself together. He was so loved, and that was the crux of it. He was loved by a man the world was going to forget existed. He was loved by a small firecracker of an artist that painted one of the largest love letters he’d ever seen in his life. They were going to paint over this man in colours that he’d dreaded for years. Colours that reflected nothing of what he’d truly wanted.
“I don’t think I’ve ever seen you approve of anyone I had ever dated before,” Tony let out a short soft laugh, “He likes you too. Believe it or not, he’s never had a meet the parents’ situation. Grant lost his own parents pretty young so I guess I dodged that one. So he asks about you sometimes,” Tony explained draping his arms over the couch arm and watching Jarvis settle back with the episode done.
P.S. - Yeah, that should work. Thanks.
Steve sank into the narrative as poor Bella, the wife of the newlywed couple, began to believe she was going mad. Items around the house would go missing or appear in the wrong locations, and her husband, Paul, would accuse her of having displaced them. Paul slowly began to push harder and harder on Bella, convincing her she was going mad. By the time Bella began to hear footsteps in the supposedly vacant rooms above hers, Bucky had all but vanished inside of his coat - hiding from the unsettling horror of watching the woman come utterly undone. Steve, on the other hand, wanted nothing more than to punch the husband right in the kisser. The way Paul would go from blindingly charming to absolutely cruel was the worst a person could be, especially as he weaponized it against the woman he was supposed to love.
Do you need any inspiration? Because I think there are some musicians heading your way that are amazing.  All you have to do is ask. And you are going to make Rhodey’s year.
Finishing his prayer, he turned to find Bucky staring up at the chapel’s ceiling. The building was far finer than the synagogue the Barnes family attended. Well, perhaps not finer. Gaudier, Bucky would say, once they were safely on the path to the florist down the street. Steve attempted a smile and simply said, “Yeah, they sure like their gold leafing and stained glass, don’t they?”
Steve hesitated, knowing what Bucky meant. “I am sure he’ll do his best, Buck. Just like you do.” He combed his fingers lightly through the brunet’s thick hair. With his free hand, he folded open the letter and slowly began to read the words. “Eddie apologizes for how heavy the package was, by the way.”
Besides that.  It's been tense. I still feel like Obie isn't as patient as he was. And I think it is safer for Maria to getaway now. There's tension everywhere Grant.
Birthday gifts
-Grant
She shot him a confused look. “The hotel? No.” Her eyes narrowed. “Dr. Stark, if you are trying to get me to a hotel room, I feel it necessary to inform you that I think dicks are disgusting.”
I want to see Maria and Rhodey spar. He’s finally getting a break that will let me see him. He’s been busting his ass trying for a promotion. I think I’ll grab some pictures of them sparring if I can. And you will be better prepared to teach any perverts a lesson. Prepared is the best we can ask for.
Now to finish some more work on the as of yet unnamed missile. He could input the name into the coding later. But what to name it?
Sad hours.
As for your mistletoe exploits, I am curious why you bothered. You seem like the type who would enjoy spending time getting kissed. Was the company at those parties so bad that climbing out the window really was the best option? Not even Pendragon’s friends are that bad, and most of them are art school washouts.
A warm chuckle slid past Arnie’s lips. “Just means sometime you’ll have to do a painting of me and Michael together. We can pose for you and everything.”
Eddie,
“You’ve mentioned that he gets his ass kicked a lot. It doesn’t sound like he knows how to fight very well. We could teach him a bit. I think it’d be fun to make a vintage-looking fight handbook or something. Just don’t make me wear a dress; I would split the side seams so bad,” Maria said - almost blandly.
“Yeah.” Steve resisted the urge to hold the flowers even tighter, worried he might crush them. “Sent along enough for us to get some lunch too. Wants me to try to take care of myself today.”
Sorry, this one letter is so short, sunshine. Was too busy folding paper around the coins to make sure it just seemed like it was a lot of paper in here instead of coins. Unfold it carefully and there might be a surprise.
The rehearsals and drills with Rhodey were repetitive and awful. But getting to see Rhodey and Maria duke it out was fabulous. Even if the two of them as a hand-to-hand duo fighting against him was awful. It was still a fun night.
“It’s because I can’t just hop in any old day and grab him. I need to figure out how to set Chronos for a certain day and place,” Tony said, then wiped at his face then looked at the screen. “Because out of all of time and space I get a guy with a specific expiry date that is super important.”
“Yeah, yeah. Don’t get too fresh with me,” Bucky griped. “Else I will take that nice loaf of fresh bread and eat it myself.”
I have always wanted to have my work featured in a gallery one day. That would be really fine, yeah? Just imagining people coming to see my art. Talking to me about my color choices. Examining the way I use strokes to create feelings. Making a difference in some small way through the mediums I love. It is probably a fever dream, but sometimes dreams are all I have.
Steve playfully rolled his eyes. “I won’t catch my death.”
And if you can figure out how to make Kitt futuristic, surely you can figure out the traffic for flying cars and jetpacks. Maybe they have ways of talking to each other that keep them from running into one another. Like the cab drivers yelling at each other. But with less cursing.
This week I am going to see the movie, as promised. You will have to let me know what you make of it. I am sure excited. Even Franklin is excited, though he was a bit dubious of letting me pick what we were seeing. I had to reassure him that it was your choice and not mine. He said he could trust you better, since the both of you have similar tastes. I was right; you would be menaces together. Specifically, you would team up against me and make me regret introducing you. I would probably laugh so much I would need another asthma treatment. It would be amazing.
“I didn’t know that.”
As an answer to the last chapter. Things are not okay. And mistakes are made.
Steve snorted. “Liberate'' is one word for it. But. Better it’s being used to fix things than the alternative.” Moving out into the hallway, he effortlessly scanned for any change. “Where in the West you from?”
