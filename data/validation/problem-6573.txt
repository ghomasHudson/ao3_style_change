“No, it was Natasha, actually. But I’m guessing she got it from Hill, yeah”, Bucky explained, sitting on one of the chairs and putting his feet up on Steve’s desk, which earned him a very pointed, annoyed look, “So, are you going to tell me about this mysterious person you’re sending flowers to?”
Tony opened his eyes and untangled himself from Steve. Both turned their eyes to DUM-E, who seemed confused.
“Hello, my darling Anthony. I’m your aunt Peggy”, she whispered softly to the baby, whose wails soon turned to quiet whimpers as he watched the beautiful woman with his big, brown eyes, “I’m the one you come to when your father is being terribly stupid. You’ll notice it tends to happen with surprising frequency”, she explained to the newborn baby, earning a faint laugh from Maria and a very annoyed
“Yeah, okay”, Tony nodded, putting his head on Natasha’s shoulder, “Have I told you how much I love you today?”
“What do you mean he messed up? The flowers… Wait, the flowers and the note, they weren’t meant for me?”
“So, doing anything swell in that workshop of yours?” Steve asked and then frowned, as if he was a bit horrified with what had just come out of his mouth.
life, it was hard to find the time to do something fun with his friends, which was why the young hero and his friends had created Game Night.
“Yeah, I guess”, Steve said, closing his eyes and touching his forehead, frowning as if he was in pain.
“The bugs won’t work. He has a device on his person at all times, a watch to be precise, that disrupts all signals. It will be impossible to record anything”.
Steve smiled. “First thing we’re going to do… We’re going to hire the best damn lawyer in this country and we’re going to take a look at your father’s will. Because I know your father was an asshole, Tony, but from what you’ve told me, and what I’ve heard from him, he was all about legacy and names. And I seriously doubt he’d leave everything to someone other than his son”.
“But enough sad stories, tell me more about you guys. Steve talks a lot about you”, Tony added after a while, accepting the drink Sam had just handed to him.
“Just so you know”, Tony started, getting closer to him, “I dropped some oil on that stool right before you got here”.
“No, none of this makes any sense”, Tony replied, gripping his own hair so hard Natasha thought he might rip it off, “That goddamn freak of nature, I’m gonna kill him next time I see him”.
“Tony”, Matthew called, getting the engineer’s attention, “We need to know more about this will. Were you present when they read it?”
“Send an SOS to Avengers Headquarters”, he told the private, who nodded, busying himself with his computer, “Give them our location and tell them we have a super powered female with telepathic powers. Tell them she can control minds so they’ll need to be prepared”.
Steve stood there, unsure on what to do. He was shivering, his teeth clattering from the cold. He hated the cold. It reminded him too much of a time when he and his ma would sit in a freezing living room, trying ― and failing ― to keep each other warm under old, torn blankets the church had given them. He didn’t have much time to dwell on memories, though, because soon enough the mechanic came back, a change of clothes in his hands.
“Listen here, you spoiled little brat. I don’t know what you think you’re doing bringing up this will mess again, but I can tell you right now, Anthony, it won’t do you any good. That will is as legitimate as they come”, his face suddenly twisted into a cold smile, “Your father knew exactly who you were, Anthony. A good for nothing, useless brat who couldn’t possibly be the leader his company needed. He knew you would destroy his legacy, that’s why he left the company to me”.
“Steve proposed the day before”, the engineer said, taking a deep breath, “I said yes, but now… Well, it seems silly to hold onto it. I’m sure he will find someone else to give it to”.
The party went on without any incidents. They ate, they drank ― well, they drank water because Tony wasn’t old enough and Steve was on the job ― and, at one point, they escaped to an empty balcony and Tony taught Steve how to dance amidst laughs.
He was on his way to an interview for a scholarship when he got the call. He took a cab and got to the hospital as fast as he could. Sadly, they didn’t have good news. Sarah Rogers was sick, very sick. As they explained to the young man everything she would have to go through (the chemo, the many nights at the hospital, the physical therapy, the experimental drugs), Steve’s mind wandered.
“Ah, Captain! I’m so glad you could come”, Stane exclaimed in a welcoming tone. Steve knew he was being polite, but, for some reason, every time that man opened his mouth the blond would get chills, and not the good kind.
Tony turned his head and looked at him for a whole minute before sighing and passing the carton of ice cream to Steve, who took it with a soft “thanks”, turning it and drinking the melted bits.
Peter took a deep breath and closed his eyes. And then, after a minute, opened them again, throwing his friends a very confused look.
“We should split up, we’ll cover more ground like that”, Natasha suggested, very clearly trying to ignore the scene in front of her.
“He is not a prince”, he hissed, his face growing redder by the second, “Stark is a spoiled brat, nothing more”.
Steve shook his head. He took Tony’s hand in his and kissed his knuckles. “You’re the most amazing person I’ve ever met. I could never be ashamed of you. Never”, he promised.
He was worried. About Tony. Not angry that Tony was dating a man and hadn’t told him, just worried about his safety.
The worst part about all of it was Rhodes. Every morning they left the Air Base on a helicopter and they would search every inch of the wide, unending desert. And every night they would return without so much as a whiff of the Mechanic’s whereabouts. Steve could tell this mission was taking a toll on the Lieutenant’s spirit. Every night his eyes would grow sadder, his shoulders falling a bit more, his expression a bit darker. He would lock himself in his rooms as soon as they stepped inside the barracks and would only resurface in the morning with renewed determination, marching towards the helicopter as if today was finally the day.
The woman gestured for Steve to sit down and wait. He did so, beside another man who looked to be about his age.
, Steve kept repeating in his mind as he walked faster towards the fridges. He needed a beer. Anything, anything at all to numb the incredible pain he was feeling right now.
Tony didn’t have time to answer. The Imperial March started playing, a sign that Rhodey was waiting for him outside. He smiled at Jarvis and Ana, his way of saying
“Bucky’s right, we’re idiots”, Steve said when he finally managed to stop laughing, flipping the pancakes into a plate and putting it in front of Tony.
“It’s a video game. He’s saying we should free the animals and let them deal with the goblins”, Peter explained.
Tony, on the other hand, had met Steve in a Graphic Design class he once took. The soon-to-be engineer knew pretty much everything the professor was teaching, but noticed that the very attractive blond on his right was looking completely lost and desperate. He offered the young man, Steve as he soon found out, a little help with his project and they hit it off right away. They’d meet between classes to talk about some TV show or some book they were reading and, sometimes, Steve would come down to the labs with a cup of coffee and listen to Tony talk about the Artificial Intelligence he was creating, called “Just A Rather Very Intelligent System”. By the time Tony had finally noticed just how far in love he was with Steve, it was already too late.
“Yes, Tony, a party. Come on, it’s been three years since we beat that giant purple asshole and we should celebrate it. We survived! We saved the world! Let’s party”.
“It’s a 3D sonogram of Tony’s baby. It’s a girl!” Steve replied excitedly, proudly showing him the picture.
This time, a drawing of a small brunette figure making a face at a cup of coffee while holding hands with the blond little man.
Steve suddenly felt a warm sensation around his wrist. He looked down and saw the bracelet Strange had given them emitting a shy, orange light for a moment and then going back to normal once more. The Avengers exchanged a worried look.
Hope you guys enjoy the chapter! (; Remember to leave a comment, I love reading your opinions and thoughts about the story!
Tony wasn’t afraid to say that he panicked a little bit when he heard the news. Okay, not a little bit, a lot. Like, a full panic attack that had him sitting down in the middle of the parking lot at the hospital, just looking like a maniac as he desperately tried to breath. He vaguely remembered a little old lady asking him if he was alright. He couldn’t recall what exactly he replied to her, or how he got inside his car, but somehow he did both those things. It took him a long time - maybe half an hour? He wasn’t sure - to finally calm down and, when he did, it was like he was back at the doctor’s office, hearing the news all over again. A baby. Tony was going to have a baby.
He pushed the old car through the rain, getting absolutely soaked in the process, and cursing all the way to the car shop. He pushed the car inside the open garage and tried to shake himself dry, like a big wet dog.
“Oh, no, I’m so clumsy, I’m so sorry”, Natasha suddenly exclaimed, taking some napkins from the table and trying to clean Bucky’s shirt, now soaked with red wine, “Come on, let’s go to the bathroom, if we wash it now it won’t stain”.
Tony knew he had to go to school sometime. He couldn’t avoid Steve, and everyone else, forever. But he was so
There was nothing on his fridge except for an expired carton of milk and a very old apple. Steve closed its door, sighing loudly. Of course there wasn’t any food; after all, he’d been spending all of his time at Tony’s lately. God, he missed the mechanic. He missed coming home to a smiling face. He missed cooking dinner between loving touches and stolen kisses. And he missed falling asleep next to his mechanic, nose buried on his hair, smelling that scent that was so naturally Tony. Steve had always fallen hard and fast for people, ever since he was a boy. But this… this was ridiculous. He’d known Tony for less than two weeks, for God’s sake, and he couldn’t stop thinking about him, couldn’t stop picturing their life together. He couldn’t help but imagine what their future would be like. And now he wasn’t even sure they would have a future. Feeling utterly depressed, the blonde decided he wasn’t that hungry after all and left the kitchen with slumped shoulders and a lost look in his eyes.
“JARVIS will use his access to the tower to lead them away. You know, turning lights on and off, making the elevator go crazy, messing with the computers, the whole ‘Paranormal Activity’ shebang”, Tony explained, “And with them away, Natasha can get into Stane’s office”, he pointed at said room in the hologram, “and get the documents we need”.
The offer surprised both of them, Steve most of all. His eyes widened comically, as if he couldn’t believe the words had just come out of his mouth.
, jumped to conclusions and spent the entire walk back to base fuming that Peggy deserved better, that Howard wouldn’t treat a dame like her right, and blah blah blah”, Bucky said, rolling his eyes, “I’m telling you, that walk back was the worst thing that ever happened to me”.
The calls came during the night and then again the next morning. Every time his phone rang, Tony would take it and stare at it, fighting the urge to answer it just to hear Steve’s soothing voice again. But he couldn’t. He had to be strong. So every time, with tears in his eyes, he would press the decline button, hoping that maybe the blonde would take a hint. He had just ignored yet another call from Steve when he heard the unmistakable noise of a motorcycle outside his shop. He looked up just in time to see Bucky taking off his helmet. The man looked sheepishly at Tony.
The party was a typical frat party. Lots of booze, lots of people, lots of chances to hook up. And it was there Tony met Steve. He had been in a corner, looking around like he wanted to be anywhere else but there, drinking beer from a plastic cup. Years after, Tony would swear to anyone that it was love at first sight. The minute he saw Steve standing there, with his way too small white shirt, and his blue pants, and his hair looking like freaking Johnny Bravo, he knew he had found the one… The one to spend many nights under the sheets doing things that would make a very experienced hooker blush.
Bucky nodded and got up, shutting the door behind him. He then turned to Hill. “Maria, I need Tony’s address. You have it, right?”
“We’re not sure, yet, but… We think your parent’s accident might not have been, you know, an actual accident”.
He closed the door to the car, turning to her with a curious, yet welcoming look. “That’s me. Can I help you?”
I'm not very proud of this chapter, but it was the best I could do with three hours of sleep and a ton of work waiting for me. So, yeah. :(
“Look, what you did was shitty as hell”, the mechanic replied, sitting down next to him on the clean stool, “I understand your reasons, but it was still fucking shitty. I had to take a lot of shit from a lot of people before and that’s not gonna fly anymore. I really like Steve, but I’m not going to let people treat me like crap. Got that?”
He rang the doorbell, but no one answered. He called Tony, still no answer. Now fully worried, Steve picked the lock and walked inside, gun in hand. He didn’t particularly like using fire arms, but, well, his shield wasn’t exactly portable. He checked the kitchen and the bathroom, there was no one there.
“The Jericho”, Steve supplied, and then explained upon seeing the perplexed look on Tony’s face, “He showed it to me, said it would be operational in a few weeks”.
“Yes, I can confirm that”, Nat said with a smirk, “They didn’t hit it off right away, but Steve once told me that even when they were fighting in the helicarrier, he couldn’t stop thinking about how handsome Tony was”.
“Didn’t you just say something about wrinkled clothes?” Steve whispered in between kisses, his hands holding Tony by the waist.
“Natasha worked for Pepper for a little while. I got her phone and called. She thought my plan to pretend to believe you guys was hilarious and helped me out”.
Everyone turned abruptly to see a dragon-like person, eyes as red as blood, and a mouth full of very sharp looking teeth. They all immediately got up, stepping away from the beast with gasps and yelps of terror.
In a second, the floor flew open, revealing another man. He was tall, with a prosthetic arm, a beard and long hair, pulled together in a bun on the top of his head. But Tony didn’t pay much attention to any of that. He was too busy staring at the pained look in Steve’s face.
“Oh, I know”, Tony smirked, giving him a final peck on the lips, “I ordered Chinese, by the way, so you should probably change”.
“Tony is ingenious. I’m sure he will think of something. Meanwhile, investigate Dr. Beesley’s mysterious disappearance and report back to me. And please be discreet, Agent Romanov”.
He laughed a humorless laugh. “It’s like you said. I was a just a nobody with a criminal record. I was lucky to have that job. Some crazy rich guy who’s ruthless enough to assassinate two people he knew, I could only imagine what he would do to me and my family if I didn’t cooperate. So I did it. I took a ‘bathroom break’ when I saw the car coming. Then I came back, the feed was cut and the recorded footage was gone. Then the cops came, questioned me and left. They didn’t seem to care much about it”.
The dinner part passed without any problems and they actually had a lot of fun. They talked and drank good champagne with Clint, Sam and Nat while Wanda danced with some guy Steve could’ve sworn said his name was Vision and Pietro flirted with a girl who was clearly enamored with him. It was only after the best men toasts ― Sam and Clint had told every dirty little secret they knew about the fake couple ― that Steve finally found time to talk to Tony.
“I understand. I know my word won’t mean much to you, but I promise you, Tony, I’m not like that. I worked really hard to have everything I have and, to be honest, I like using my money to make the people around me happy. But I can dial down a little bit if you think that would help. Just give me a chance to prove to you that I’m different from these people you’ve met before. Please”.
“They are the best damn soldiers we have. They’ll stop her”, Ross said with a confidence he didn’t really feel at the moment.
In no time, Tony’s hands found Steve’s stomach under his shirt, touching every single inch of skin he possibly could. They separated only long enough for Steve’s shirt to be taken off and thrown on the other side of the room. He slowly ran his hands from his neck to the hem of his jeans, working on his zipper, desperate to open it already and just feel Steve’s length in his hand…
Hill huffed, quickly adjusting her expression to a more professional one. “No, nothing at the moment. You do have three very important meetings later, one of them with General Ross. You might want to prepare”.
And it had worked. It wasn’t ideal, and Tony hated it, but he loved Steve and he was willing to suffer if it meant they could be together. Everything worked fine. Until today.
Tony shook his head, trying not to show just how scared he was. There was a crazy man pointing a gun at him. The same crazy man who had shot Obadiah in the head right in front of him.
“You lied to me”, he shouted, turning and pushing Steve away, “you lied to me for three months! You know, when we started dating, all I could think about was how can someone like him choose someone like me? I’m nothing special, I’m barely a functioning human, so why would the captain of the football team, the school’s favorite, perfect student choose me? And now I know. You didn’t. You were stuck with me, just like everybody else. You didn’t want me, you just learned to tolerate me, just like everyone else in my life”.
The engineer took a large bite and moaned in pleasure. Steve turned his back at him, trying to not show just how uncomfortable that moan had made him.
Steve nodded, still looking unsure as they entered the elevator. The restaurant’s hostess, a pretty strawberry blond that vaguely reminded Tony of Pepper, greeted them as soon as they showed up at the door. She had a big, welcoming smile and took them to a table outside. The place was completely empty, which intrigued Tony.
Tony told Steve about college and how his parents had died in a car crash on the same day he had presented his thesis for his PhD. He told him that he had very much wanted to start a second PhD, but was unable to because he didn’t have the money to pay for it. So he had left MIT and opened the auto shop with the help of two very good friends.
Clint had been waiting outside for them, two streets away from the apartment. He looked anxious and asked for answers as soon as he got into the car. Steve explained everything that had happened, skipping the part about Tony’s suit of armor.
Tony should have noticed something weird was going on when, right after the dance with Thor, T’Challa approached him with a plate in his hands, looking far better than anyone had a right to, in Tony’s opinion.
“So, what brings you to Walmart at two am to eat raw cookie dough and ice cream on the floor like a lunatic?”
And as his heart was ripped apart, as his sobs made it difficult to breath, as he fought to keep his eyes opened, unblinking, because he could not
Tony got up and took a step closer to the coffee table, taking all of the remaining boxes and putting them on the floor around it. The others stared at him, unsure of what was going on, until he put one hand on the glass part of the table. A soft, blue light emanated from it and then, with practiced ease, Tony pulled his hand up, making a hologram of Stark Tower appear right there, on the table.
Steve put his hand on the table and got closer to the screen. “They were being mind controlled”, he whispered in awe.
Even though he very much wished to be anywhere but there, Tony had to admit that Natasha really could throw one hell of a party. The engineer walked around the room, smiling at everyone he encountered, trying so very hard to show everyone he was fine. Overall, he was doing a great job. He had pointedly avoided Steve ever since he had arrived and intended to continue to do so for the entire party. He knew he had to face his partner ―
“Perhaps, in the beginning, master Rogers had a different idea of what love could be. Maybe, before you showed up, love had the face and shape of Miss Carter. And perhaps, when fate put you in his path, he realized love was much different from what he believed it to be”.
“Well,” Tony replied, still smiling, “remember three months ago? You were at the Maria Stark Gallery showing your work?” When Steve nodded, dumbfounded, he continued, “I saw you. I couldn’t talk to you at the time, too busy, and then I had to leave because I had an emergency at SI and I didn’t have a chance to talk to you. I knew your name and where you lived, but I couldn’t just go after you like some sort of stalker, so I decided to wait until the next time you were at the gallery. Imagine my surprise when I received an invitation to your wedding in my mail a month later”.
“I know, but, honestly? He’s always around. He’s at every meal talking all the time. He’s at the door every time I try to go running in the morning. He is here on movie nights just bothering everyone with his incessant talking. He’s annoying. I just wish I didn’t have to see so much of him, you know”.
“Our friend from the FBI”, Bucky replied with a grimace, remembering the last time he brought that particular subject up. Tony, however, didn’t seem to be affected by the memory at all, “They’re going to stand by, in case Stane finds out and tries to make a run for it”.
Steve took a deep breath and nodded firmly. “I’m going out with Tony Stark”, then his eyes widened, “Oh my God, I’m going out with Tony Stark. What should I wear?”
“You are the most beautiful princess in the whole wide world and your dress is the prettiest dress in the whole universe!” he exclaimed, throwing her up again, only to catch her immediately after.
“We don’t know, Tony”, Natasha replied, “But we’re not ruling that out. We just think it’s weird that both your parents died in an accident days after the will was changed. It may be just a coincidence, but…”
know better. There is a lot of grey out there. And sometimes there are missions, things that must be done, that the public would never understand. So they have entire teams for it, teams that remain in secret and do their jobs in secret”.
And at this very moment, Tony knew. This was it. It was over. Maybe it should have never happened in the first place. So many times they had tried to be together and then something would come and ruin it. SHIELD falling, the accords, Siberia, Thanos. Maybe the universe was trying to tell them something, show them that it was better this way, that they weren’t meant to be together, that their story would never have a happy ending so they better just stop now and move on. When the realization finally hit him, Tony didn’t cry. In fact, he felt nothing. No sadness, no pain. His whole body was numb, his mind empty. He merely held his coffee mug, the only source of warmth he had at that moment, and looked at Steve.
Tony smiled and pulled his boyfriend down, giving him a quick kiss on the mouth. “You’re absolutely perfect, did you know that?”
"I know, Marcus, you said that...", the other replied, rolling his eyes, "You just need to watch them, man. It's not like you're gonna change their diapers or something".
“That’s all very sad, but it doesn’t explain why the hell you’re using a fake name”, Bucky interrupted, earning a glare from Steve as soon as he opened his mouth.
didn’t exist anymore. All there was now were the memories that never left him alone. Rhodey and Aunt Peggy always tried talking to him, begging him to open up, and he wanted to, God, how he wanted to. He wanted to tell them everything, he just didn’t know how to do it. How could Tony make them understand that the food tasted like ashes in his mouth? How could he put in words the terror he felt every time he took a shower? How to say that he had to take a million deep breaths, fighting off the tears every time he washed his hair because the water falling on his face felt too much like the times they had shoved his head inside a bucket until he almost drowned? But, most of all, how could he tell his best friend and his godmother that the only thing keeping him alive in that moment was the anger that burned inside his chest? That every dream, every wish, every plan he had ever made had been destroyed the moment he saw Yinsen take his last breath, leaving an empty spot in his very soul that could only be filled by one thing: vengeance. He could never tell them all that.
“That is quite enough of screaming, thank you very much”, Margaret reprehended the women, who kept staring at her like she had just grown another head, “Take Howard to his bedroom and make sure to leave some aspirin by his bedside, I’m sure he’ll need it later”.
“I must go”, the doctor said. He turned back to Tony before opening the door, “Be careful with who you trust, Mr. Stark”, and, with that, he left.
“Look, Tony, please, just let me say this. And when I’m finished, if you want me to go away and never come back, I will, I promise. Please”.
They jogged down the corridors and back to the starter point, where Steve and Tony were already waiting for them. They didn’t have time to talk, however, because as soon as they stepped inside the room, the bodies on the floor started to get up. Steve pushed them back with his shield while Tony used his blasters to keep them away. Natasha and Clint drew their guns once more, shooting anyone who dared to come too close.
It was going to be hard… But he could do it. He’d be there for Tony and Morgan, he’d be fun Uncle Steve and just help his friend out in every way he could. It would be fine…
“Doesn’t matter, I still hurt you. And I’m sorry. And I’ll spend the rest of my life making sure that you never doubt my love for you again. Please. Please, forgive me”.
“A little bit, yeah. But I happen to like weird”, Tony replied, taking Steve’s hand and pulling him towards the door, “So, were you actually going to marry him? Because, to be honest, you could totally do so much better”, he joked when the blonde pulled him closer, arm on his shoulders, hugging him.
“He can’t stay. Maybe some other time, right Tony?” Steve interrupted again, looking at Tony with a desperate look on his face.
“Here, you can change into this if you want. My friend, Rhodey, left them here last time he came over. At least this way you won’t freeze”.
“And if I told her, she would’ve told me that we needed to investigate, to confirm, she would’ve told me to wait… I couldn’t wait, Steve”, he replied, looking at him with so much feeling that Steve took a step back, “Those were my weapons, the weapons I designed!”
It took Steve three weeks to finally wake up. And during all that time, Tony did not leave his side. He slept at Steve’s room, showered at Steve’s room and the only reason he ever ate was because Natasha ― and sometimes Vision ― would bring him something and remind him to
– had been right about it all along. After the realization had hit in straight in the face that day, in Tony’s kitchen, he’d tried to put some distance between them. He thought about maybe not answering the phone when Tony called or texted, saying no whenever the engineer invited him to go somewhere… Needless to say, it did not work… at all… not even a tiny little itsy bit. First time Tony had called, Steve had been so happy to see his face on his scream that he immediately picked it up, only remembering he was supposed to be ignoring the man
“Sure. Oh, and, Stevie?”, Bucky called from the door, with an innocent expression, “What’s your boyfriend’s name again?”
But he never finished his sentence for, in that moment, the gates suddenly, and slowly, opened, granting the Avengers passage inside.
Six months after that party ― and a LOT of mind blowing sex ― Tony begun to notice some things. It all started on a fateful Tuesday. He’d had a very bad day, full of uninteresting classes and way too many assignments due next week, not to mention the lovely phone call he’d gotten from his father earlier, in which, as usual, Howard specified every single thing that was wrong with Tony in a very disappointed voice. All the engineer wanted was to see Steve, to cuddle with him on his very uncomfortable couch and watch bad TV while complaining about everyone and everything as Steve hugged him and stroked his hair.
He wanted to say something. Maybe ask Steve out on a date, like dinner at Pop’s, their favorite Italian restaurant, and then a walk around town while they had some ice cream. He was pretty sure he’d be able to romance the pants out of Steve, both literally and figuratively. There was only one problem: Steve had a boyfriend. His name was Bucky and
Suddenly, they heard a scream. They exchanged a quick look before running towards the sound, breaking the door down. Inside the last room was a little girl, looking absolutely terrified. She was sitting in a corner, hiding her head on her knees, crying. In front of her, there was a man covered in blood, with clear shot wounds all over his torso. Natasha quickly leapt across the room, jumping on the man’s back and using both her Widow Bites right on his neck. It did nothing but piss him off. He used one of his arms to grab her and throw her across the room with a loud groan. She fell on a broken bed, immediately trying to get up as he turned his full attention towards her. She drew her gun and shot him. Once, twice, but nothing happened. Then, there was another shot. The man’s head exploded and he fell forward like a big sack of potatoes. Behind him was Clint, pointing his own gun while holding the little girl on his arms, her head buried on his neck as she trembled.
After they were finished with their food, Steve offered to take Tony home, which he promptly accepted. It didn’t take them long to arrive at the engineer’s building ― he hadn’t been joking when he said he lived close by. They stopped at the door, staring at each other.
They were at Steve’s apartment. It was his birthday. All of his friends were there. Sam, Bucky, Natasha, Clint, Thor. He’d invited some of Tony’s friends as well, like Bruce, Rhodey and Pepper. They had beer, vodka, pizza and a huge cake with “Happy Birthday, Dumbass” written in icing, courtesy of Bucky. It was all good, until Natasha came over and started talking.
Tony spent the next week hiding in his workshop, avoiding not only Steve but also everybody else. He just couldn’t bring himself to face them. He knew that, by now, either Clint or Steve would’ve told the others about what had happened in the kitchen that day and, honestly, he didn’t think he would be able to handle their looks full of pity for him. He just wouldn’t. So he stayed at his workshop, asked FRIDAY to tell everyone he was fine and just needed some time for himself, and successfully avoided any and all contact with the rest of the Avengers.
He just stood there awkwardly as they laughed. It was embarrassing, sure, but hey… He’d done worse things before.
Steve thought for a moment, before smiling, “I am counting the hours to see you. No, wait”, he said when Maria turned to leave, “that’s too much, I think. Maybe… ‘A thank you for being the one good thing in an otherwise shitty day’. How’s that?”
“Our friends work for the FBI”, Natasha explained, “If they say you don’t exist then you don’t exist”.
. He sat there for a moment, hands on the wheel, just staring at nothing. A few weeks ago, after such an awful day, Steve would want nothing more than to go home, take a long, relaxing shower and just fall asleep watching old cartoons. That night, though, he found that his usual plans didn’t sound as good as they’d have weeks before. In that moment, all he could think about was burying his nose in Tony’s neck and holding him close. If he closed his eyes, he could almost smell the musky scent mixed with the accentuated smell of metal that exuded from the mechanic’s skin.
“I… Yeah, but… I don’t think it’s the kind of love for marriage”, Steve tried, grimacing at his own words.
I skipped some events here and just mentioned them. I thought it would work better with the plot, after all, you have all watched the movies, you know how things happen lol I hope you enjoy the chapter. I'll try to update more frequently!
“… and only you can save the people from its claws. There is a town not far from here, where you will find food, ale and shelter, but first, you must defeat the beast that guards these woods. Slay the beast and the magic that surrounds this forest shall weaken and you, my brave adventurers, will be able to continue your journey to the cursed Castle of Vania”.
“Tony. I came into this century with nothing. No home, no family, no hope. I was bitter, depressed, angry at everything and everyone. And I didn’t think I would ever fit in here, that this was my punishment: living in a world I fought so hard to save, but never truly being a part of it. I’d accepted my fate like a dying soldier accepts his defeat. Until you.”
Tony huffed with a smile, shaking his head at him, and raised his eyes, looking right into Steve’s blue ones before lowering them to stare at his mouth. He felt him stiff all of a sudden, his breathing getting faster.
In return, Steve told Tony about his mother, her cancer and how he had joined the Army right after her death. He told him about Bucky and the people he had met in Afghanistan: Sam and Nat. He told him about everything he had lived there with them and how they had been giving honorable discharges after a very ugly mission that had taken three of their fellow soldiers and one of Bucky’s arms.
, she thought, shaking her head. After she was done, she turned her attention to the TV and, for a second, couldn’t believe her eyes. It was the evidence; the missing footage. She stepped towards it and watched, stunned, as the familiar car hit the tree. The man, Howard, got out of the car and fell to the ground, dragging himself away from it. Suddenly, a man appeared.
“Before you shoot”, Tony shouted, putting his hands in the air, “Before you shoot… I need to know… I need to know who you are. I need to know why I’m dying!”
“Do you know if the previous will said that as well? Do you know if this clause was added or modified in the second will?”
But it wasn’t just sex. They would do other things too. Every week, they’d rent a movie and watch it while cuddling on the sofa. Sometimes, they’d go out for a walk and have hot dogs at the park, or go to Howie’s and have cheeseburgers with fries. They did many couples thing and so, really, no one could blame Tony for thinking they were, in fact, a couple, even though they’d never said it out loud. Maybe Steve didn’t like labels or whatever, but they were definitely dating. Or so Tony thought.
The people in the screen looked fine, indeed. No head wounds, no blood. The taller man, Lawrence, was standing there, as was everyone else, the radio still in his hand. It looked like the weirdest game of statues.
“Shit”, Barton whispered under his breath, taking his bow in his hands once more and getting ready for a fight.
Seeming satisfied with the answer, the five year old took a huge bite out of his sandwich, pulling his plate closer to his chest when his uncle Bucky tried to steal some for himself.
“Yeah, that’s what I’ve been calling it. It’s crazy, right? I would’ve thought they’d pick some strong, trained types, but they actually picked the guy with one arm and… well…”
Without thinking, Tony stepped out of his hiding spot and shouted ‘Hey!’, getting the attention of the man, who quickly turned around and pointed his gun at Tony.
Steve was sitting in his living room, staring at the black screen on his TV, his left hand covering his mouth and a part of his nose as he analyzed the entire evening yet again. Tony seemed fine before they went to the restaurant. He smiled when Steve complimented him and seemed very excited to go to Mario’s. He was fine at the restaurant too, but, now that Steve really thought about it, he seemed a bit anxious by the time dessert came. But, honestly? Tony was always anxious. From the moment Steve had met him, his mind never stopped working. So the fact that he was a bit fidgety wasn’t really too out of character for him.
“Good. I’ll get inside, hack the computer”, Natasha said with a determined look on her face, “When can we do it?”
Bucky, who had stayed with Steve during the conversation, had been filled in on the plan after the blond had finally gone to sleep. He didn’t much care for it, especially because he knew how good Tony and Steve were together and how much this was hurting Tony, but, when Natasha explained Tony’s reasons he couldn’t help but understand where the older man was coming from.  The couple had gone through so much in the past years, they had worked so hard to forgive each other’s mistakes and move on. And now, when things were finally going so well for them, after two years of being a disgustingly cute couple, they were separated again. Fate really was a bitch.
“Boys, boys, let’s not make a scene”, Obadiah said with a fake smile on his face, “We’re in public”.
“Hey, Morgan, it’s… uncle Steve”, he said, catching himself just in time – he’d almost called himself papa, “How about you give your dad a little kick so I don’t have to call him a liar, huh?”
“This isn’t your fault, Stevie”, Bucky immediately replied, “We were supposed to keep an eye on him. We got distracted. I’m sorry”.
The same thing happened over and over again. Every time Steve and Bucky started fighting over something to do with the wedding, Tony would intervene and bring a solution. They fought about literally everything: the color of the napkins, the food they would serve, the table decorations, the music, anything they could think about, really, was a reason to start screaming at each other. In one of those times, Bucky had even stormed out, crying and screaming
The Director slammed her fist on the table with a curse. “I knew it. I knew that big old bald walrus was no good, I told Howard a thousand times he wasn’t trustworthy”.
, he thought and then shook his head, reprimanding himself for even thinking something like that. What the hell was wrong with him? Did babies fuck up brains too? He’d have to ask JARVIS when he got home. Or maybe Ty would know.
They were about to celebrate their one month anniversary and Steve could not be happier. After that particular night in his apartment, where they spent the night together in each other’s arms and Steve had woken up to a
He jumped down from the bed and found his shoes, trying to put them on as fast as he could. Before he could finish, though, a soldier entered the small room, posting himself by the door, staring silently at Steve. The young artist stared right back, trying to calm himself down.
“Shhh, it can hear you”, the mechanic replied, caressing its hood like it was a prized possession, “How old is it?”
The little man looked surprised at the phone on his hand, then at both his minions, before begrudgingly giving the device to the red headed woman.
“Sweetheart, you’re perfect. I’m not worried about that, I’m worried that they’ll eat you alive. My friends tend to be a bit… overprotective”.
Steve and Tony walked around, talking to some people, drinking some champagne and discreetly looking around for Obadiah. They saw Bucky standing at the bar with Sam. They raised their glasses when their eyes met, as if saying hello, and went back to their conversation. They looked quite natural, just two men talking and drinking, but Tony knew them well enough now to know that they were focused on finding their target. He was starting to wonder if Obadiah had not shown after all, when he heard a voice behind him.
“I ran away from home. Well, not ran exactly. After my parents died, my legal guardian showed his true colors. My father left him everything we had, including the house, the furniture, and any and all inventions I had come up with. I had a robot, I built him myself from scratch. His name was DUM-E. He’s probably been destroyed now or sold for parts”, Tony told them, his eyes suddenly burning as the tears began to fill them, “My guardian threw me out right after the funeral. All I had were the clothes I was wearing at the time, nothing more. I couldn’t afford MIT anymore, so I had to leave there too. My friend Rhodey helped me out, let me stay at his mother’s place for a while”.
Toomes sighed and looked away, pensive. “Think of your wife and daughter, Adrian, and all the shit that you’re going to put them through if you’re arrested for being an accessory to murder”.
“There’s a computer”, Steve said, pointing to the machine. Tony quickly walked over to it and started typing.
“Fine. Now, I need to prepare for my meetings. Hill booked Stane and Hammer this afternoon to pitch their weapons”.
Tony nodded. “Yeah, I get that. Nat and I are the same. Did I ever tell you about how we met?” When Steve shook his head, he continued, “We were both really young. Her mother was friends with my mother and she couldn’t have children. One day, they came back to Russia and there she was with them. Nat was the best thing that has ever happened to me. I don’t know what I would’ve done without her”.
“You guys like laughing? Okay. You”, he said, pointing at Clint, “had to go the hospital once because you had a carrot stuck in your ass”.
“Hey, peanut! Heard you’re a little scared, but don’t worry, uncle Steve is here with chocolate and marshmallows”.
“Already did, boss, soon as Romanoff called. She’s up and on her way to the medical wing, and so is the crew”, the AI responded, “it’s gonna be alright, boss. He’s gonna be fine”.
“I know. But we have to stop her. Maybe with some guidance she could overcome all this. I’m sure the X-Men wouldn’t mind helping her”.
It had been a long time since Tony had stepped on a red carpet, but, for some reason he couldn’t quite understand, it felt… right. When they had first decided to attend Reed’s Charity Ball, he’d felt nervous and insecure, but now, walking side by side with Steve, wearing a tuxedo made especially for him, he couldn’t help but feel like he belonged there. The flashing cameras and the screaming paparazzi did not faze him at all, on the contrary, it all felt natural, like he was coming home after a long, horrible vacation.
“You’re a dumbass who has no sense of self-preservation”, Bucky corrected him, sitting on one of the chair. “So, I’m guessing the date went well”.
Natasha doesn't like gossip, but hey, sometimes it can be useful! Also, Tony and Stane meet up. It's not good.
For some reason, Tony thought the first time he and Steve kissed would feel, well, different. He’d imagined fireworks going off in his head or feeling a sudden uncontrollable passion. Instead, he felt calm; his head completely empty. All he could feel and think about was Steve; his hands, his lips, his warmth. Too soon, Steve broke the kiss, pulling back far enough to look at Tony’s face.
“Of course. Tony is not stupid and he’s very observant”, she explained with a smile, “You and Agent Barnes were now supposed to be ‘spies’, Captain. You were supposed to distract my godson from the real spy”, she said, gesturing towards Agent Barton.
The link is down below but I don't recommend watching it unless you want to know what happens next! But I DEFINITELY recommend watching it after you're done with this fic, cause they are awesome!
Widow and Hawkeye landed close by a few seconds later, the blue light of the repulsor in the parachute slowly dying out.
“What’s wrong with your jaw?” Natasha asked, looking at him with her narrowed eyes. She abandoned the strawberries she was cutting and cleaned her hands on a towel before getting closer to the engineer lightly touching his jaw. “It looks dislocated. What happened?”
. They dated for a year. They kissed, they cuddled. Had Steve been uncomfortable in all this situations? Had Tony forced himself on Steve without knowing he wasn’t welcome?
“Yeah. Sorry, it’s just… This is a really amazing car”, he replied, sounding more sincere, “So, where are we going?”
“Yeah, and we’re only saying this because you’re usually too dumb to notice these things”, Sam completed, earning a nod of agreement from Bucky.
“You”, he pointed at Bucky, “tried to jerk off with your bionic arm and ended up getting it stuck in your penis and Tony had to turn it off to get it off your prick. And you”, he finished, turning to Sam, “forgot to zip your pants after you went to the bathroom and was banned from Taco Bell for walking with your dick out like a pervert”.
If Steve had had a choice, he’d have chosen to go to art school. He would’ve stayed with his mother, happily using his creativity to create beautiful pieces of art and hopefully one day his work would be worth something, at least enough to give his mother the quiet life she deserved. But as it were, destiny had a very different plan for Steve Rogers.
. Steve could understand the need to blame himself, really, he could. He’d done it more times than he could count, really. But, somehow, Tony’s self-blaming was different, deeper, much more fueled with self-hatred and self-doubt. Throughout the entire meeting, as Director Carter talked about the small device Tony had created containing the program needed to access Stane’s computer without setting off any alarms, the engineer remained silent. His eyes were unfocused, cold. He kept staring at one particular spot of the table, not really seeing anything, seemingly lost in thought. Anyone else would think Tony was distracted, but Steve knew better. He could see the determination shinning in those brown eyes. He was formulating a plan and Steve was pretty damn sure he’d hate it.
“Well, I guess now we know where the bodies are”, Clint commented, trying to sound light but not quite managing it.
Steve went rigid as soon as the melodic voice entered his ears. He turned slowly, gulping, and forced a smile.
“Captain America!”, a woman sitting closer to them said, getting up. Soon, others started to do the same.
“Yeah, funny right? We thought they were dating, they thought we were dating…” Bucky explained, with a tilt of his head, “And then Nat and I went to the bathroom, talked about it, almost had sex against a sink and then Pop’s threw us out… What a fun night”.
Steve was pretty sure he had never looked more stupid in his entire life. He just kept looking at Tony, opening his mouth and closing it again.
Steve frowned and opened his mouth to retort, but Tony shushed him with a hand gesture and a roll of his eyes.
Natasha put her gun back in its holster and started investigating the area while Tony hacked the computer nearby.
Romanov hung up before she could reply. Seconds later, a few files appeared on the screen. Jessica put the fork back on the plate, turning her whole attention back to the computer. Whoever that Jarvis was, he was goddamn good. Thanks to him, she had now a current address (he still lived in Malibu), a lot of information about his security company (closed a few months after the Starks died) and… a Stark Industry redacted project. There wasn’t much she could read, but the words
“No, no. It’s not the five failed exams I’m interested in. It’s the five tries. Tell me, Mr. Rogers. Do you want to punish some bad people?”
Tony turned in his arms and kissed him, making everyone else boo them and make gagging sounds. He paid them no mind, smiling up to his partner.
as the blonde hugged him back as best as he could, burying his nose on Tony’s hair and he whispered back
“And Director Carter knows that. She knew that when she put me on this mission so I’m gonna do things my way… And if she isn’t happy about it, well, she can just…”
By the time Steve and Bucky left Tony’s house, it was already dark outside. The engineer had assured them that there was absolutely no need of standing guard outside because JARVIS was more than capable of protecting him. Not only that, but the AI had also hacked all the cameras along the street and was constantly on alert for any possible threats. Steve had briefly wondered if Tony might have noticed a certain blonde on the top of a nearby building sometimes, but didn’t say anything.
Tony put his hands together and then pulled them apart, making the tower bigger and its rooms more visible.
“Alright, Tony”, Natasha finally said, holding her friend’s hand, “We’ll do it your way. But if he asks a direct question, then we’re not going to lie, ok?”
“I’ve noticed that. I’m guessing we might find something on his computer, but it’s password protected and if I try to hack it, he’ll receive a warning right away. His security system is absolutely amazing”.
“You wound me, sweetheart”, he replied, feigning hurt. He extended his hand, ready to touch Tony’s tie, but was stopped by Steve, who grabbed his hand midair with such force that Tony was sure he’d break it.
“Not illegal, per say”, Matthew answered with a tilt of his head, “But unusual. If you’re modifying or drafting a new will, then why not take out the unnecessary clause? Any capable lawyer would do it and Howard Stark doesn’t strike me as the type of man who would hire anything less than the very best”.
“Good, good. I’ll need you to sign these papers”, he said, taking said papers from inside the file he had in his hands and putting them on the table near Steve, “they are just a precaution, to make sure you won’t repeat to anyone what I’m about to tell you. Should you do that, you will be charged with treason, Mr. Rogers, so think carefully”.
“Alright”, Matthew replied, opening his suitcase and fumbling around a little, before finally taking a small card from it, extending it in front of himself. Natasha quickly, and carefully, grabbed it, “If you need help, contact her. She’s one hell of an investigator and she got screwed over by Hogarth once. You tell her we’re going against one of their clients, she’s gonna work his ass off to get what you need”.
“So, you finally managed to ask the guy out? Look at my big boy, all grown up”, she said sarcastically.
Stane laughed a humorless laugh and grabbed the terrified engineer by the shoulders, pulling him closer in a half embrace.
Tony put the cup on the nightstand after finishing it and turned around. “Will you get into trouble? You could call in sick or something”.
And with a nod, T’Challa left, leaving Tony behind with a lemon cake and the feeling that something was very
Steve moaned again, thrusting his hips forward to meet Tony’s hand. The mechanic kissed him again, a slight peck on the corner of his mouth, and very slowly kneeled in front of him, his wet lips leaving a trail from Steve’s mouth all the way to his waist, before finally taking his cock in his mouth, moaning as he did so.
“He is DEAD, it’s what he is! LOOK AT ME”, Harley complained, touching his gigantic dragon face with a painful moan.
Natasha and Clint were the first to arrive. They stepped out of the elevator and looked around. They expected to see Tony pacing back and forth, pulling his hair from his head, panicked at the very idea that his partner of three years wanted to spend the rest of his life with him. They did not expect to find Tony in his closet, an excited smile on his face as he looked through his clothes.
the Director of the world’s biggest intelligence organization, you know”, she said, raising her eyebrow at them.
But two weeks turned into three, three turned into four and suddenly, Tony was very much aware that almost three months had passed without any news about Loki or changes in Steve. Every day that passed, the engineer felt more depressed and even more certain that his love would never remember him. Telling Steve wasn’t a choice, especially now he knew he pretty much hated Tony. So, he decided that maybe, just maybe, it was time to move on. And that very morning, he found out that Steve, albeit unknowingly, had decided to do the exact same thing.
at him, but the rest of his body wouldn’t move. He looked down at his coffee and made a nonchalant sound, trying so very hard to not show his heartbreak.
Everything was ready for yet another Game Night. The twelve boxes of pizza were already in place, accompanied by a huge bowl of M&M’s and a family package of Reese cups. Their phones had been turned off to avoid any distractions and each of them was already seated in their designated places, character sheets already in hand, excited for another adventure to begin.
Steve frowned when he heard Tony’s last name. It sounded awfully familiar, but he wasn’t sure where he’d heard it before. He accompanied the nurse and Tony to the entrance, where the young man was finally able to leave the wheelchair behind. They said their goodbyes to the nurse and walked over to the car.
“Honestly? I don’t know. I mean, Obie, he… He was nice, Steve. He was always on my side, even called my dad out sometimes when he mistreated me or called me stupid. He was the one who inspired me to create the Jericho. He kept talking about how proud my father would be, how all the soldiers, Rhodey included, would be much safer if we have the bigger stick. Because that was my father’s motto: ‘Peace means having a bigger stick than the other guy’. And I believed that”.
At the end of the meeting, when the Director finally stopped talking, an eerie silence took over the room. Nobody knew what to say. It was in that moment that Tony finally lifted his head, brown eyes meeting the blue ones of his godmother.
“Holy crap”, Ned said softly on Peter’s left, raising his hands and looking at them in awe, “Holy crap, I’m green”.
Steve smiled, kissing his mouth and then, gently, his nose. “Pizza first, then. And dessert after. Also, how did you know where I lived?”
“I don’t know. Fury knew him, said the guy was losing his mind. Too much scotch, apparently. If he really was as bad as Fury made him to be, then it’s hard to believe he was the genius behind R&D”, Steve took a deep breath, reading over some papers on his desk, “Okay, I need to read this now. Come back at 3pm if you want to see the weapons for yourself, okay?”
With that, she got up abruptly and left the room, completely ignoring the surprised look on the agents faces when she passed by them, almost running to get to the elevator. As soon as the doors closed, she took her phone out and dialed; consequences be damned.
The little girl screamed again in delight when her uncle Bucky picked her up, throwing her in the air only to catch her again.
“I hate both of you”, Steve replied, taking yet another sharp turn, making Clint yelp as he was thrown from one side of the car to the other, “Seatbelts, please”.
“WHAT THE FUCKING SHIT, STEVIE?! You called and said Tony was missing and then you say you found him and then you go all weird and quiet, turn off your comm and don’t pick up your goddamn phone? I THOUGHT SOMETHING HAPPENED TO YOU!” Bucky shouted right back, putting his gun away and looking exasperated, “Is everything alright?”
“He is. He also wore a shirt that said ‘proud cheerleader for the Ladybugs’ with a picture of a little girl in pigtails one day”, at Tony’s confused look, she explained, “It’s his niece. She won a soccer championship for toddlers. He was very proud”.
Steve watched, amazed, as the baby opened her eyes and yawned deeply, grabbing his finger with a strength he never imagined a newborn could have.
“… and Director Carter told me to bring it to you so you could use one of your reconstruction programs or whatever to see who the guy was”.
“Hey. James Barnes”, the man introduced himself, offering his right hand for a shake, and that’s when Steve noticed he was missing an arm. The blond took his hand, shaking it.
He liked to think that he would have handled the situation a lot better if he’d been prepared for it, or at least expecting it. He thought maybe they would give him the shovel talk, the
“Yeah? What if he passed out because he started remembering and the spell turned his brain into mashed potatoes because of it? Did you think of that?”
to happen, Brucie”, Tony said for the hundredth time, dropping a few pieces of chicken nuggets into a small Moana plate.
“It’s gonna be a long night so… I’ll see you tomorrow, okay? Thank you for the watch”, he didn’t wait for an answer. As soon as the doors to the elevator opened, he ran out, not even glancing back at his boyfriend ―
Soon after that, Tony decided to change tactics. He told the rest of the team they should start having lunch and dinner together, so Steve and he could have some time with each other without it being weird. Everyone promptly agreed and so, for two weeks, the team had every meal of the day together on the communal floor. Unfortunately, that did not have the desirable outcome. After a week, Steve started to show less and less for meals, saying he had to go to SHIELD or that he had plans with someone else. Feeling defeated, Tony called it off and stopped coming to meals altogether.
“I’m sorry for exposing you like that. That wasn’t cool. You should be able to come out on your own terms and I took that from you. I exposed you to your friends when you clearly weren’t ready to come clean. I’m really sorry about that. It was a dick move”.
“No, not really. He left right after. But I was talking to Michael and he said that the whole engineering department got an email, like two minutes ago, saying they’re not supposed to go to one of the warehouses today”.
“Also, do you have any idea how hard it is to masturbate with a huge ass belly in your way? I tried toys and stuff, but…”
“You’re doing it again. Falling head over heels over someone you’ve barely met. Look, I’m all for you meeting new people and dating. God knows you need to get laid. But you need to go slowly, okay? One step at a time”.
“What, and watch you make out with Stevie? No thanks, we’ll wait here”, Bucky said pretending to gag.
“I met someone else”, he explained very calmly, as if he was just telling Tony that he ate a banana that morning, “We’ve been seeing together for a few months now and I decided it’s time to end this, so I can fully be with her”.
, she thought, walking over to it. She took one look at the printed paper and swore loudly. The suspicious departure after midnight, the bag, the lack of clothes on the wardrobe… She quickly dialed for Romanov.
The agent deflated, murmuring something like 'interrogation room 2' just as the elevator stopped at the fourth floor. With one last look at both agents, she stepped outside.
He smiled and sent Steve back a heart, drinking his coffee ― thank God Happy had been smart enough to stop at a coffee shop ― and thinking of how exactly he was going to explain himself to Steve later.
I'm all out of energy bars, but I hear comments are super healthy and they give you that extra energy boost you need, so how about leaving me some?
Steve quickly stepped to the side, opening the door wider for Tony to go through, which he did. He looked around the apartment, whistling.
“Coffee doesn’t count”, Steve and Natasha said at the same time. She arched her eyebrow at him and he blushed and looked away, taking a sip of his water.
Steve sighed and shook his head. “No. You’re not wrong. Bucky and I are SHIELD agents and we’re here to make sure no one tries anything against you. Director Carter was… Well, she was worried”.
Tony was angry; angrier than he’d ever been before in his life. Here he was, completely vulnerable, having his own tech used against him. He’d felt hatred before in his life, mostly towards his drunk, abusive father, but this… This was a whole new level. His blood boiled inside his veins as he looked at Stane’s smirking face.
Tony smiled. “I had no other choice”, he said, and when Steve shot him a confused look, he replied, “Who am I to go against fate, right?”
But Tony wasn’t listening. He wasn’t thinking. He walked with purpose, completely ignoring Steve’s shouts, pushing men and women out of his way. He found Obadiah outside and, before he knew it, he was grabbing the CEO’s arm and pulling him away from the cameras.
“There was a call to the cops from one of the phones in the towers a few minutes ago. Someone named Jarvis reported that Obadiah Stane was in the building with an unconscious victim”.
“Okay. Now, Clint and I will investigate the lawyer’s death. Might be something there that can help us”, Bucky said, “What are we doing about the evidence in his computer, though?”
“So, apparently, they’re very strict about the whole no sex in the bathroom rule”, Bucky said with a shrug.
“Why, though?” Clint asked, closing the door behind him as they left the room, “Why would she make them do this? Just stay there, sitting comfortably in an air conditioned room?”
“Good. I’m glad you like them. So, shall we?” Steve asked, gesturing towards the car. And that’s when Tony immediately stopped, staring at the very expensive, very beautiful car.
Steve stared at his best friend with a weird look on his face. “No offense, Buck, but you’re not my type”.
“We should all calm down”, Natasha finally said, “We don’t know what happened. For all we know, Steve is fine and just got all his memories of you back”.
“And now you die”, the man said. Tony moved quickly, ducking behind the pillar while Natasha jumped on the man, her legs circling his waist and holding him in a tight chokehold. The man yelped in surprise and dropped his gun. It fell to the ground with a loud clank and slid on the floor until it stopped right next to Tony, who, without thinking twice, took it and pointed at the man at the same time as he grabbed Natasha by the hair and shirt with both hands, pulling her forward with every bit of his strength, sending her crashing to the ground with a scream of pure fury. He raised his head and looked at Tony, his face red and contorted in rage, and stepped forward, arms extended to grab the mechanic. Natasha quickly hugged the man’s foot, trying to hold him back. And then, there was a shot.
After a heavy make out session, Tony decided it was time to start working on his device. The engineer was more determined than ever to bring Stane to justice and put Stark Industries back on the tracks. Steve sat on the old couch in the back and listened to Tony as he worked. He talked about putting an end to the weapons part of the company and about pouring all his resources on green energy and medical technology. He told Steve about all his plans, his ideas for making the world a better place, passion dripping from every word. They didn’t even notice the time flying by, and only realized how late it was when JARVIS announced Bucky’s arrival.
So, as it turned out, pregnant people were horny as fuck. Apparently, the increased libido usually happened around the second trimester, according to every pregnancy related website, but it seemed like Tony’s body had other ideas. It’s not like Steve hadn’t noticed the fact that he kept staring at different men and women every time they were out together… In fact, Steve was honest enough to himself to admit that he’d even been a bit jealous of it. So, in a way, he knew Tony was checking out other people, sometimes while making every obscene sounds that should not be allowed in public, but still, the question caught him completely off guard.
“No way”, Clint replied, vehemently shaking his head, “We’re not giving up, Tony! I mean, we’re already half way!”
I thought it might be a bit silly that Steve didn't know about same sex marriage being a thing, but then I remembered my friend who only recently found out about that, so... If it's not very believable, just bear with me ;
“Rhodey said the same thing”, Tony replied, nodding, “But Stane has a legion of lawyers. It’s hard to go against rich people. Trust me, I know”.
“Really?”, Tony asked, wanting to know more, but it was finally their turn to order. The engineer ordered his usual burger with fries and helped Steve choose as well, telling him what was good and what wasn’t. The menu was a big blackboard hanging on the backside of the truck, so Tony had to hold Steve’s arm and stay on his toes to be able to see it properly. He got a bit closer to Steve, pointing to his favorite dishes as he showed them to the blond. Steve stiffened when he felt Tony’s slender hand close on his bicep. He kept staring ahead, feeling a chill travel his whole body, from his neck to his toes, when the engineer got closer to his ear, his chest fully touching his arm now, as he talked in a low tone about the ingredients on every burger. Steve tried to pay attention, God he really did, but it was like his brain had simply stopped working.
“We’ve been searching for fifteen minutes at best”, Natasha replied, not turning around to look at her teammate, “Look, I know this whole ‘mind control’ thing is freaking you out, especially after Loki, but you have your wristband. She’s not going to control you, or any of us for that matter”.
He could hear Stevie’s voice saying them. He could see Tony’s smile hearing them. He could see them, together, happy.
“Okay, I just ordered a shit ton of food, Pepper is on her way with Happy and Rhodey and we are going to CELEBRATE”.
But Tony just smiled at him, pure arrogance and confidence, “I’m a certified genius. I’m MIT’s youngest graduate, with a complete PhD and another unfinished one. I made my first circuit board when I was three, I built a motorbike engine from scratch when I was seven, I created DUM-E when I was fifteen, and I created the world’s first Artificial Intelligence”, he took a deep breath, as if reassuring himself, his eyes still full of confidence, “I’m Tony Stark. And I’m going to tear those assholes apart”.
The doctor in charge had taken one good look at Steve and another at his medical file and quickly stamped a 4-F in his enrolment paper. Steve tried to make his case, but the man would not hear it. Still, the young artist didn’t give up. He lied on his form and tried again. And again. And again. And again. Sometimes he would consider giving up, but then the hospital bills would arrive and he would think of his mother, his beautiful, kind, hardworking mother who had given up everything to care for her only son. His mother, who had worked more shifts than she could possibly handle to put her son through school. The woman who took beating from her drunk husband in order to protect her boy. He would think of her and remember every single that she had done for him and that always gave him the strength to try again.
“It’s breaking my heart too”, Tony whispered to himself, checking the missed call on his cell phone.
“Enhanced female with telepathic powers. No knowledge as to why she attacked the base or how she got there”, Natasha replied, checking her widow bites to make sure they were working properly.
“Well, from the information we have, Howard Stark had a previous will made when Tony was born. Then, years later, he canceled the previous will by making a new one. You were twenty at the time, is that correct?”
Tony just couldn’t understand. He tried, God knows he tried, but he couldn’t seem to grasp why Steve would want to keep this,
“We’re not going to let anything happen to you, Tony”, Steve whispered, kissing the brunette on the head, “I promise”.
Tony smiled excitedly when the elevator doors opened, giving the small box in his hands a little squeeze. He purposefully climbed the stairs and marched to their bedroom, where Ty was waiting for him, according to JARVIS. He stopped at the door, frowning at the two suitcases.
“Uh, ten minutes ago? Is something wrong?” But Steve was no longer listening. He left his drink in a nearby table and started running towards the bathroom.
“Now, you three”, the Director said, turning back to them. Her serious expression broke into an amused one, “Has Tony figured out who you are yet?”
stopped and his mind felt empty. He looked to the side and saw Wanda, her eyes and finger red as the soft mist of the same color slowly twirled around him. He stared at the Scarlet Witch’s eyes as his body began to feel light and relaxed. And that’s when he heard it.
“I’m sorry. I should have told you. It’s just that… After you kissed me and you told me we should grab a burger, I thought, okay, I’ll tell him the truth at the diner and… I didn’t. Because that day I had the best time of my life. You were funny, and smart, and gorgeous, and damn it, Tony, I was terrified that if I told you, you wouldn’t want to see me ever again. So I didn’t. And I should have. I’m sorry”.
, he read. God, what would his mom say if he got arrested? Worse, what would happen to his mother if he couldn’t work to at least try to pay for her treatment? Without much choice, Steve decided the best course of action was to get the hell out of there was quickly as possible.
“A DM is someone who creates the adventure we’re gonna go on. They come up with the plot for the adventure and play every other character in the world”, Ned explained and, seeing Loki’s confused look, quickly added, “They control the narrative”.
“Barnes, here’s what’s going to happen: as soon as JARVIS finds a match, you’re going to take that skull away and then you’re going to come back, take that table and burn it. Got it?”
“He’s fine. I told him you were here waiting for news and he asked me to tell you that you can go”, she said in a gentle tone.
“No playing while we eat”, Morgan chastised them, repeating the same words her father always told her when she tried to bring her tablet to the dinner table.
Director Carter was already waiting for them when they arrived at the small, inconspicuous office building, and she didn’t look happy at all. Steve knew there was no possible way for her to know what he and Tony had been doing just hours before, but seeing her like that, with her icy stare and displeased expression, made him tremble on his feet. They all sat down in front of her and waited as she connected with Natasha.
He buzzed Tony in and then looked around and then at himself frantically. He was wearing a pair of old sweatpants that had definitely seen better days and a colorful t-shirt that said
“But if the entrance is secret, how is he gonna know where to go?” Peter insisted with a frown as he pulled on the hem of his father’s sweater.
Morgan giggled. She pushed Steve’s hands away and, without his support, promptly fell on her diapered butt, babbling away.
“Tony… Tony, I know a lot just happened all of a sudden”, Steve said, kneeling down in front of his boyfriend, “But this is good. Tony, we can fight him. We can get you your life back. What do you say, love?”
Bucky tried to reply, but was laughing too hard to actually make any words come out of his mouth. It was Sam, wiping away tears, that answered the Captain’s question.
With a determined look, Bucky went straight for the stairs. “FRIDAY, get the others. I’m done with this”.
“Tony is very smart but he is also very sure of his intellect. I knew that he would pick you two out right away. He’d be so focused on what he found out about you, so sure that he’s uncovered the truth, that he would not pay a lick of attention to the actual spy. Also, janitors are practically invisible. A sad truth, but a truth nonetheless”.
Tony smiled and, instead of using words, just pulled Steve down for a kiss, holding him tight and letting himself be held by him. The people near them started laughing, and cat whistling and clapping. But suddenly, all the noise stopped and the couple heard someone clearing the throats forcefully. They interrupted the kiss, looking for the source.
“Think about it… Cap comes home after being gone for a month. Soon as he arrived they got some food and fucked off to the room like a pair of nymphomaniac rabbits. And then, the next day, Shellhead comes down and he has a dislocated jaw?” Clint looked at them with barely contained glee. “TONY DISLOCATED HIS JAW GIVING CAPTAIN AMERICA HEAD”.
“Okay. I’m not going to pretend I actually understand the politics behind this, because, honestly? I don’t. But if you think this is the right thing to do right now, then I’m with you, one hundred percent”.
“Do you want to run? Or do you want to stay and fight them? It’s your choice, love”, Steve asked softly, cleaning away a tear with his thumb.
“He may not have chosen you at first, Anthony. But he chose you again and again and again for a year. And he kept on choosing you every time he called this house, heartbroken and desperate, and every time he sent a gift with what I can only assume were very remorseful notes. You made each other happy, Anthony. Perhaps you ought to give the young man a chance to prove his love to you”.
OMG, I promise, the next chapter will be the last one! I really have no self control, a two chapter turned into a three chapter turned into a four turned into a five chapters fic. H E L P
“Yeah, you definitely looked like you were struggling”, the man said, putting his bow back on his back, “What’s going on?”
Immediately, Wanda cried out as she closed her eyes and held her head with both hands, clearly in pain. Tony finally managed to get out of Thor’s strong hold and ran to the glass window on the wall that separated them from Steve. He watched horrified as Cho and the other doctor desperately tried to revive the super soldier while the machine screamed at them. Then, came the sound. A long piercing sound echoed in the room in a never ending loop.
Everybody was staring in silence. The man, Rhodey, was looking at him, an eyebrow raised, waiting for Steve to talk.
“We… We actually had to cancel the wedding, Mr. Stark. Too expensive, you know how it is. We’ll probably just wait a few more years and try them. Sorry for wasting your time, but thank you for being so nice to a couple of strangers”.
“What I’m saying is… There is no way for the company to recover unless I have the best of the best; and that’s you! So I’m willing to pay whatever you want”.
“Tony told me the guy showed him some pictures of a place called Gulmira. Accused Stark Industries of dealing under the table”.
“It’s not a piece of crap. It’s just old and tired. I can make it work, though. You can pick it up tomorrow at four pm”.
First, there was Private Johnson. Good kid, good soldier. He was an overall happy person, his roommates said. Funny, optimistic, always making sure everyone was okay. Which was why it was so weird when Private Smith found him in his room one morning, a gun still on his hand and pieces of his brain mixed in with the blood that covered his once white sheets. Suicide, they had ruled. Strange, but not impossible, after all, the secrecy and isolation required for this mission could take a dangerous toll on some of the more weak minded soldiers. So they sent his body back, gave his family enough money to make sure they’d keep quiet and simply moved on.
“What’s up, love birds. I brought food”, he said carrying a big brown bag and putting it on top of Tony’s table.
“For being a dick to you last night. For introducing you as just my friend. I know that really hurt you and I’m so sorry”.
“The day I met you under the bleachers, with the flowers and the note. Why didn’t you tell me they weren’t meant for me?”
Tony stopped typing and turned slightly, looking at Steve with a raised eyebrow, “We’re in a super-secret lab surrounded by mutilated corpses… I’d be worried if you
“So, here’s what we’re gonna do… We’re gonna go on this double date and I’ll flirt with Steve and you’ll flirt with Bucky”.
With a thoughtful look on his face, Tony took a small flash drive from one of the compartments of his armor, putting it on the closes USB port he could find.
“I’m very much not okay with my boyfriend fake marrying his best friend, but I understand that telling the truth now would make you two look like drunk assholes so I’m going to accept this turn of events and try very hard not to strangle both of you on the foreseeable future”.
Steve stared at the picture on his phone with a smile on his face, completely ignoring the conversation happening around him. He was about to send a quick text to Tony, curiosity eating him up, when the man himself beat him to it, sending him the one piece of information he’d been dying to know for weeks now.
A red headed woman opened her eyes, blinking to try and adjust to the bright light being shined on her. She heard the sound of a train passing close by as she looked around the empty warehouse. Her captors, two tall men and a smaller one, all stared at her with cocky smiles.
So they walked side by side for a few blocks until they reached a food truck parked nearby Charles River. There was a long line to place their orders, so they talked while they waited.
“Yes. I remember because he told the professor to call him that and I asked myself why would a grown man
“I promise you it’s not going to be like that. I…”, he sighed and lowered his voice a bit, “I need someone I can trust, Pep. I’ve never been all that involved with the company and I’m about to make some huge changes to it. It’s going to be a PR nightmare and I’m pretty sure we’re going to lose a lot of investors, not to mention the board…”
The lights were still out. Tony could still hear the man shouting in the corridor, but the voice was slowly getting further away. He needed a plan. He needed to get the hell out of there, somehow.
“I can see that now”, Tony said, nodding with sad eyes, “The minute they read my father’s will, he kicked me out of the house. He had the Jericho, he had SI, he didn’t need me anymore. But then, when he noticed what I’d done to the missile, he came looking for me. At first he tried to apologize, said he wasn’t dealing well with his mourning, that my father’s death had really hit him hard. I didn’t buy it. So he changed his tone, said I designed the Jericho while under a SI contract and so it belonged to them, to him; said I needed to get it working, or he’d make me regret it. So I ran”.
“HEY”, Clint complained from his seat in the front, turning around to glare at the target, “A little gratitude would be nice. We did just rescue you, jackass”.
“You see, master Anthony. Some people are able to choose exactly who they are going to love. Like your mother. She saw your father at a benefit and decided that was the man she was going to marry”.
“OH MY GOD! This again! I was stupid, I fell for the wrong person, I got my heart broken, BIG FUCKING DEAL! It’s happened to everyone. Or do I have to remind you of Connie?” Steve replied before covering his face with his hands, “How many times are you going to remind me of that? I fell in love, I got played, I was sad and I moved on”.
“Steve!”, someone called from behind him. Suddenly, Bucky and Sam were there, jogging alongside him.
hadn’t decided anything. Bucky had just thrown a tantrum saying the beautiful, very expensive hotel they had rented was not ideal and they should just call off the wedding and wait for the beautiful space at the hotel upstate to be available. There was an eight months waiting list, but hey, it was worth the wait. It took Tony less than three minutes on the phone to get it for them at the exact date Bucky wanted. So yeah, that plan had backfired.
Natasha watched the woman’s back, her smile slowly fading into a frown. She quickly took her phone when Evelyn was far enough and sent a quick text to Bucky and Steve.
Steve did not have to be told twice. He turned his head and captured Tony’s lips with his own, kissing him slowly as he pushed Tony back into the couch, taking extra care not to squish his belly. They kissed for a few moments before Tony huffed, annoyed.
“Well, it’s settled then. Let me call my PA and she will be here in a second. Then, we can discuss dates! Excuse me”.
Three months. For three long, unending months, Tony thought about going home. Every night he’d lay down on the hard stone floor, his body shivering from the cold wind that seemed to crawl under his skin, and he’d think about the small apartment where DUM-E was probably wheeling around, beeping with worry, waiting for him to come back. He’d think about lying down on his king sized bed, under his warm Star Wars covers, drinking a hot cup of coffee with lots of sugar and cream while he watched some old TV show. Every single day, he thought about leaving that god awful cave in the middle of the goddamn desert and finally going home. And now that it had finally happened, now that he was finally here… it just didn’t feel like home at all.
This is it, guys. The story is done. It's over. I hope you guys enjoyed it and I can't wait to hear what you think.
Steve let his mind wonder as he waited for the bartender to finish his order. He pictured a house, maybe somewhere outside the city, with a big basement that Tony could transform into a workshop; a big kitchen, too, where they could exchange kisses as they cooked. He smiles just thinking about it. A big yard would be nice too, big enough that the kids could run and play. Kids… God, Steve was already thinking about kids. He shook his head, but couldn’t keep the smile off his face. He didn’t know if Tony wanted them, they hadn’t even discussed it, but it was a nice thought. A family… with Tony. He couldn’t wait.
She walked along the corridor, ignoring the tired agents that seemed to be dragging themselves to their rooms, with her hands inside her pockets and her mind far away. Clint had a point and she knew it. She had been acting, not weird per say, but unlike herself these last few days. The truth was... Stark's story had messed with her head. After finding that box and discovering the diaries inside, Natasha thought that perhaps knowing how Stark had survived all those years, still looking young enough to pass as a thirty something man, would help her understand how Yasha had survived. No such luck. She had been naive to think that she could find closure like this.
“Would you like to sleep over at my place? You know, since there’s probably going to be some very loud sex happening at your place tonight”.
“It’s fine, take as much time as you need, Doctor. It’s not like I forgot too much, I mean, I just forgot one person, right?” he said, trying to be positive.
“Got it”, Clint called, fishing a blue keycard from the floor and carrying it towards Tony with his arm stretched in front of him while he murmured
to the public. She knew exactly what he meant, although it was hard to believe a man she had once called friend would use such thing against her.
“Sorry, sorry, it’s just… She wasn’t right for you, you know. But hey, maybe you’ll meet someone at the party, huh? Try dancing a little with some people and who knows, maybe you’ll find that the right partner was right in front of you all along”.
On his first day in captivity, Tony cried, scared. On his second and third days, he spent all his time looking outside the window, hoping his father would show up with the police. On the fourth, he cried again, convinced that his father, who had never much cared for him anyway, would not pay the ransom to get back a good for nothing son he didn’t even want. Through the fifth to the seventh day, he carefully observed the three men that had taken him, taking notes on what they did and at what time, and memorizing all possible escape routes. On the eighth and ninth day, he managed to steal everything he needed. On the tenth day, he set the small bomb to go off minutes after he was taken from his room for his bathroom break, successfully hurting one of the criminals and confusing the two others long enough to be able to slip past them and into a small hole that took him to the garage, where he hotwired the car and got the hell out of there without looking back. Needless to say, everyone, including the police officers, was very surprised when the eleven year old showed up at his home in a car he’d stolen from his own kidnappers. That day, as Howard proudly told the police, and whoever would hear it, that Stark men needed no one but themselves to get out of a bad situation was the day that Tony learned he couldn’t count on anyone, ever. And he’d lived by this all his life. Which was why it was so strange, and even scary, for him to be sitting there, in the middle of Steve’s living room, listening to all these people eagerly and determinedly planning to take down Obadiah and discussing how to restore Tony as the sole heir and CEO of Stark Industries.
“Real bad flirting, but yeah. And if he was flirting with you, that means he’s not happy in his relationship!”
“Unless her super powers include amazing computer skills, then no”, Tony replied with a sigh, “JARVIS, keep at it. See if you can bypass whatever security they have here. We need more information”.
Tony didn’t know how to react. He remembered when he first came out to his parents as bisexual. His mother thought it was just a phase, something that would pass with time. Howard, on the other hand, almost ripped him a new one. He screamed for hours, called Tony every name in the book, told him he was a disgrace to the Stark name and so on and so on. It was horrible. Then he thought about Rhodey and how terrified he’d been when the older boy caught him in a compromising position with Tiberion Stone. He looked livid. He threw Tiberion out of the apartment and he was so angry Tony actually thought Rhodey might hit him or something. And then he started screaming. And Tony almost burst into tears out of sheer relief.
“He doesn’t like lemon cake”, he repeated, seeming angry now, and then immediately held his head on his hands, groaning.
“Okay. Well, I’m going to take a shower and get ready. JARVIS, can you make sure Tony doesn’t forget our date tonight, please?”
He laughed. “Look at me! I’m hurting! Tony won’t answer my calls or my texts. He probably wants nothing to do with me anymore and I can’t say I blame him!”
“Not exactly in a hurry”, Tony replied, looking at the computer screen, “Look, they just got up and started walking”.
“I don’t know… I’m…” he winced again, holding his stomach, “I’m feeling these weird pains! Do you think there’s something wrong?”
Please, forgive any mistakes, it's almost midnight and this is the only time I have to write D: Hope you guys enjoy the second and last part!!
“Welcome home, handsome! I was starting to think you weren’t going to make it”, Tony said, standing right in front of his husband with his arms crossed.
. He didn’t see Natasha cover her mouth with her hands, pain clear in her eyes. He didn’t notice Wanda on the ground, hugging herself as if trying to keep herself from falling to pieces, while Vision hugged her, a somber expression is his face. He saw nothing but Steve. He heard nothing but his own voice inside his head, repeating the same thing over and over and over again…
He looked down at his watch yet again. Not even ten minutes had passed. He got up, unable to remain seated any longer, and walked towards the receptionist, who sighed immediately upon seeing him.
“I loved it”, Tony replied with a fake smile, taking the watch from the box and staring intently at it, “I absolutely loved it. It’s beautiful, thank you”.
“Nothing relevant, Captain”, he replied, hands behind his back once more, “We’ll start the searches tomorrow at zero six hundred hours. The target is a major contributor to the U.S. Military so they’re focusing a lot of resources on this, not only soldiers but high tech equipment as well. It should help”.
“And now I know! And I had to do something about it! I couldn’t wait, I couldn’t stand here, waiting, watching those people die and be tortured… I couldn’t do nothing now that I know what’s going on”.
“Hey, talk to Bucky, okay? Let me know if I need to make some calls”, Tony said, giving Steve a hug, “everything is going to be fine”, he whispered, before leaving.
“I don’t know what you mean”, Natasha replied with an innocent smile that Tony knew was full of shit.
Tony smiled, “It’s fine. Some things just aren’t meant to be. It’s better this way, terminator”, he turned to leave, but seemed to remember something, turning back to Bucky while pulling on a chain around his neck.
“Sure. I’m going to warn Bucky and I’ll be right back with your food. Text me the address and what you want”, he kissed Tony’s temple.
“No offense, but I was ready to tear you a new one earlier today. But then we talked and I realized you’re a huge dork. You’re funny and nice and, after our date tonight, I kinda think it’d be fun to hang out with you”.
Peter looked at the others with a grimace. “Well… Have you guys ever heard of this really old tale called ‘Empire Strikes Back’?”
The teenagers suddenly looked up in alarm. Peter quickly got up with wide eyes, waving his hands in front of himself, knowing exactly what was going through the god’s head.
“Next weekend”, Steve replied, “We’ll have Dr. Reed’s Charity Ball next weekend. He already sent the invitations. Stane has been trying to get Reed as a client, so he’ll definitely be there. Tony and I will go, we’ll keep him distracted. Meanwhile, you get inside Stark Tower and get the documents”.
He bit his lips as he hit sent. It was a normal thing to offer, right? They were friends, Tony was pregnant, paint was probably bad for him because of the smell and… whatever. He was just being a good friend. That was all. He wasn’t in love with Tony.
“I’m not your boy. I’m going to ask you this one last time, Stane. What the hell are you doing here?”
The shout echoed through the room as the engineer in charge recoiled slightly, taking a small step back.
“I think Pete should probably go first, he has the most experience with those”, Ned said in a joking tone and then stopped, “Wait, do you still have your powers? Like, your Peter Tingle?”
“The only people who knew he was coming were me, his aunt and his business partner. The soldiers only found out when we left for the presentation. Even if someone had tipped off the Ten Rings, they would need at least a full day to move that much fire power to our exact location. It’s not impossible, but it’s just… highly unlikely”.
good morning”, Tony said pointedly looking at Steve’s crotch, “Would be even better if you were naked and in bed with me”.
Jarvis cleared his throat and took Tony’s plate. “Well, some people are worth committing a crime for, master Anthony”, he said, earning himself a kiss on the cheek from his wife.
There was a moment of silence. Clint clearly wanted to say something, but stopped himself when Bruce put a hand on his arm, shaking his head.
Being a superhero wasn’t an easy task. There were bank robbers to stop pretty much every week, crazy villains with even crazier costumes out and about terrorizing the city at least twice a month, and, of course, every year there was a super powerful alien who wanted to destroy the Earth or rule over the people of Earth or destroy the universe or whatever evil plan they’d come up with. In other words, the superhero life was exhausting. Between the crime stopping business, the training sessions and the responsibilities of what Peter liked to call his
Tony knew he had to be strong, but it was hard. Stane knew him too well. He knew exactly what to say, what buttons to push to turn Tony into a scared little child filled with insecurities. He could feel his hands slightly shaking as he tightened his grip to the doorknob, his lips trembling as he thought of something to say… and then, he saw it. From the corner of his eye, he saw a figure. Steve. He was standing nearby, close enough to put himself between Stane and Tony if needed be.
, Steve thought, frustrated. He needed to talk to Tony. Find out what exactly had caused such a strong reaction, so they could work on it.
He sighed, glancing at the shut door of his best friend’s office. “I just want to fix the mess I made”.
“Fine. Focus. This is Stark Tower. JARVIS told us that Stane didn’t change the original design, so this right here is an exact replica, with every room, every entrance and every exit”, he began talking, pointing at the hologram.
Tiberius looked at him and stayed silent for a whole minute before sighing and getting up from the bed. He walked slowly towards Tony and stopped right beside him, turning his head to look at him.
while turning around and hugging Steve’s pillow. He took a deep breath, smelling his boyfriend’s cologne and smiled, eyes still closed. FRIDAY insisted. “
Natasha had met Bucky at one of her classes. He’d asked for a pen with a bright smile and a wink. She arched an eyebrow and lent him the pen, but not without asking why exactly he needed one if he only had his laptop and no paper with him. He blushed furiously and murmured an apology, giving her the pen back. They did not talk anymore after that.
“You… Bastard…” he tried to say, but his mouth moved in a weird way, making his words sound sluggish and wrong.
Steve smiled back at him. “Here, let me help you with that”, he said, taking Tony’s tie and tying it with amazing skill.
“I think he’s saying ‘no muscle relaxants or anesthetics, we die like men’”, Barton replied, making his voice deeper as he said the words. Tony pointed at him and nodded.
Coulson shook his head, “We could, but it wouldn’t do us any good. Stane could come up with a thousand different excuses for why he had those documents in his possession”.
Steve felt like a teenager all over again, falling in love for the first time. He knew he had a tendency to fall fast ― Bucky had reminded him of that so many times throughout the years ―, but this time, it felt different. It felt so different from every other time he had fallen for someone. He couldn’t explain it, couldn’t put it in words, but he knew. He knew Tony would be his last love.
There was still a lot to discuss, and Tony’s doubts hadn’t been completely wiped out, but, for the time being, the mechanic decided to forget his shitty past and let himself enjoy the very pleasant present. Whatever the future held, he would deal with it later.
The agent snorted. "This is fucked up, man. It's a pain in the ass, too! Dude keeps shouting for a lawyer... even talked about calling Tony Stark".
“She is beyond dangerous”, the doctor insisted, not in the least scared of facing his superior, “Right now, she is out there, killing every single man and woman in this island. What if she escapes? Your little soldiers can do nothing against her! The Avengers are the only ones that can stop her now. CALL THEM”.
“A sorcerer, much like Stephen Strange, used his magic to protect this room. She cannot control us, she cannot come through the doors. We’re safe here”.
“I was fifteen”, Tony replied, stepping forward as the line moved, “I’m actually finished with my degree and working on my PhD now”.
“Dude, what was I suppose to do? It would be weird if we had like five friends over for the wedding and no family!”
They walked for what felt like hours through the dense forest, carefully watching every step and sometimes kicking some twigs they found on the way. The forest was strangely silent, no birds singing, no animals running around the bushes, just the eerie silence that seemed to weigh on them with every step they took. Suddenly, Michele stopped and raised her finger to her lips, gesturing for the others to be quiet.
“Don’t worry, Myshka. He flirted with me, so he must want something. We’ll try and see where it goes, okay?”
Steve had never been to Tony’s workshop before. The engineer had always been very overprotective of his space and Steve accepted that without a second thought. He walked down the stairs and came across a big glass wall that simply opened for him as soon as he stepped in front of it. Gun at the ready, he walked inside and just… let his arms fall in surprise.
Thing is, Steve wasn’t blind. He knew perfectly well he was on a mission, thank you very much, but… Tony was handsome. Even when they’d had rescued him ― well, given him a ride really ―, and the young engineer had been all skinny and dirty and aloof, he had noticed how handsome he was. And he hadn’t stopped thinking about the man ever since. He thought about Tony’s sarcastic answers, his warm brown eyes that irradiated strength even when his body was weak, his reassuring smile and, most of all, his courage. It had been so long since Steve had felt this way about someone and, ever since the whole
But Tony wasn’t listening. He shook his head, getting up from his chair with his hands firmly planted on the table. “I’m going, that’s final. I can take care of myself, Aunt Peggy”, he quickly mended when the woman opened her mouth protested, “I’ve taking care of myself my whole life”.
“Imagine if Stark gets suspicious. Imagine if he learns we’ve all been lying to him. He could go to the cops, say we were robbing him”.
“I don’t remember the exact words, but it said that, on the event of both of my parent’s deaths, Stane should become my legal guardian”.
“Pepper, you be here by next week and I’ll not only give you a closet for you shoes, but I’ll ask Janet Van Dyne to take you to every single fashion show in New York for the next year”.
Margaret shook her head with a quiet laugh, kissing his forehead once more before letting Rhodes take him to the bedroom, “I’ll be with you in a minute, Anthony”, she promised, watching both man disappear into the corridor before turning to Steve, a very serious expression in her face, “I received your report, Captain. It seems we’ve both come to the same conclusions”.
“Ok, I’m guessing we’re gonna have to play along with we want to get out of here”, Peter whispered to the others, who nodded in agreement.
“Objectively speaking, there was no reason why Mrs. Jarvis and I should meet. A war was raging outside and I was merely a soldier, unable to afford even a drink at the hotel she worked. But fate intervened”.
Recognition flashed in his eyes and he turned, refusing to look at Jessica and pretending to get something from his suitcase. “Work hours are from 8 to 6 at the company, Miss Jones, I’m afraid you’ll have to set an appointment”.
“Well, Mr. Stark… The captain seems to be fine, there are no injuries, no concussion, nothing that could possibly explain this sudden… forgetfulness”.
When the flowers and the chocolate had arrived, Tony couldn’t help but smile. He was touched that Steve had gone through all this trouble for him. In fact, he couldn’t remember any of his past dates doing something so nice as to send him gifts before a date. But then again, he hadn’t exactly dated nice people back in the day. He shuddered just thinking about them. Rhodey had always said he had the worst taste in romantic partners, but Tony really
The Avengers were all sitting in the Waiting Room, waiting for news about Steve’s condition. Thor, Wanda and Vision had the decency to look sheepish while Tony lectured them on their irresponsibility while Natasha and Barton just looked at him, arms crossed and a petulant look on their faces.
As soon as he stepped inside his workshop, Tony asked FRIDAY to put the whole place on lockdown. He wanted to cry. He wanted to scream. He wanted to break things. He wanted Steve back. The billionaire didn’t have time to act on his impulses, however. He heard the faint sound of the sling-ring being formed before he even saw it. He turned to watch as Dr. Strange came out, looking very upset.
“Holy shit”, Tony swore, getting up from the chair and away from the computer. Instinctively, Steve stepped forward and raised his shield in front of himself and Iron Man. The corpse, however, paid them no mind. It simply started moving, slowly at first, as if its limbs were too rigid, and got up on its two legs, turning its head towards them. There was a big whole in its head, its eye still hanging from the socket, swinging slightly as it walked, one stiff step at a time. It stopped in front of the computer Tony had been using seconds before and started typing something.
A drawing of two figures, a blond and a brunette, pointing at the many spaceships that flew around the paper.
“Oh, come on, Stevie, it was more than that and you know it”, Bucky immediately countered, looking angry, “You were a mess! You didn’t leave your house for almost a month, you didn’t eat, you didn’t talk to anyone! You were a goddamn zombie! I know you like to see the best in everyone, but some people are just bad, okay? And when I found out Tony was lying about his name I got mad because I thought ‘great, here’s another Ophelia to tear him apart’. I was wrong about that, and I’m sorry, but I only did it because I care about you”.
Peter scrunched up his nose, still looking very much worried. Tony picked his son up and sat him on the nearest stool, putting the plate of sandwiches in front of him.
Tony closed his eyes, feeling Natasha’s fingers through his hair. “No one ever wanted me for me, Nat. Every person I ever dated, and almost every person I ever met. Jack wanted my money. Tiberius wanted my company. Sunset wanted my secrets. Rumiko wanted my reputation. And then, there was Steve”, he whispered, tears in his eyes, “Steve knows me. He knows the real me, the me that hides behind a mask every day to face the world. He looked at me, with all my beauty and all my ugly, and loved me for who I am. I don’t want him to be with me because it has to. I want him to be with me because he wants to. And I know that might be selfish, but I can’t, Nat. I can’t”.
“Let’s take a picture”, he said, taking Tony by the shoulders and turning both of them towards the reporters, “Tony… This morning, I filed an injunction against you”, he said in a whisper between the flashes of the cameras, “You’re not ready for this, it’s clear to me, it’s been clear for years now. It’s time for you to understand your place in this world, Tony. This business is about having an iron will and you, my boy, you’re no man of iron”.
The car had broken down in the middle of an empty street. His cell phone was dead. And there was a storm outside, because
“Strange said ‘the beast’, though. So goblins don’t make much sense”, Harley supplied with a shrug, “But we’re gonna have to deal with them to go forward, right? Look, there’s a path over there”, he pointed to the small pathway right across the clearing.
“Tony, please, listen to me. I love you. I have never loved anyone like I love you. I love everything about you. And I’m so sorry that I made you feel insecure and sad, and I’ll never forgive myself for it…”
“Yeah, yeah”, he replied absently and then stopped, looking over at Steve with a raised eyebrow, “So, what’s the last thing you remember about this place? As in, the last time you were here?”
“Come on now, my boy!” Stane exclaimed, turning back to face his godson, “You don’t have much of a cho…”
“Well, if you noticed it was definitely strong flirting because you’re as dense as a wall, pal. So, he flirted, which means he’s not exactly into his girlfriend, right?”
Steve, who was staring at the ground looking miserable, suddenly looked up when he heard Tony’s voice and immediately got up.
Steve bit back a smile as he watched Tony turning his whole body to the side with an expression on his face that said
A week had passed with no changes. Steve still didn’t remember Tony and didn’t seemed bother in the slightest by it, which only made the billionaire feel worse about the whole thing. Tony wasn’t giving up, though. Even though he remained adamant about the whole “we don’t tell Steve the truth” plan, he still tried to make him remember by doing small, simple things that could maybe spark some memories.
“I showed up with a very expensive car, took him to one of the most expensive restaurants in New York. I booked the whole place just for us. And that’s not even counting the huge bouquet of flowers I sent before, or the chocolates”.
And so, for the next hour, they tried to keep themselves busy. Tony worked on his program while Steve and Bucky played cards. Suddenly, JARVIS’ voice filled the room.
“I missed you”, he whispered with his face buried on Steve’s chest as the soldier tried to exit the elevator while holding his boyfriend.
Steve got a bit closer and looked at it, frowning. “A missile? Mr. Stane, I don’t see how my company would need missiles. We’re not going to war with anyone”.
“TONY STARK WAS ABLE TO BUILD THIS IN A CAVE”, he suddenly shouted, turning all of a sudden and putting his finger right on the man’s face, “WITH A BOX OF SCRAPS”.
“Did it say why? Which warehouse was it?” Natasha asked and the curiosity in her voice seemed to please Evelyn, because she half smiled, all proud of herself.
“You don’t know who you’re messing with, boy”, Stane replied, trying to sound menacing, but looking clearly stunned after Tony’s little speech, “You don’t have what it takes to win this fight”.
When Steve was little, he dreamed about being an artist. His mother, bless her soul, was very supportive of his dream and whenever they had any money to spare, which wasn’t often, she would buy him paint and a canvas. Sometimes he even managed to sell some of his art, using the money to help around the house.
I'm pretty sure I wrote and deleted this chapter at least 50 times, but at last, it is finished. At first I thought about going straight to the moment Steve wakes up, but then inspiration came and I thought this would be better.
“Bad news is he left a while ago carrying a bag”, she replied, taking the paper from the tray and looking at the printed map with Stark’s shop’s address on it, “and I have very good reason to believe he’s on his way to New York to kill Tony Stark”.
The man took a step closer to Tony, who instinctively took a step back. “Your mother… Fragile, easy to kill. Just little squeeze on neck, that was all it took”, he smiled when he saw the Tony clenching his jaw, his eyes hardening with the confession, “Your father… I had to punch him… Again… and again… and again…” he said, in a mocking tone.
They sat down at the table and, after a quick look at the menu, ordered their respective plates. While they waited, they talked about their week ― Steve told Tony all about the new recruits at SHIELD who thought Captain America was really swell until he started making them drop and give a hundred pushups; Tony told Steve about the shareholder’s meeting he had had earlier that day and how he had finally convinced the others to green light his new green energy project. When the plates came, they ate and talked about their plans for the weekend ― there was an exhibit at the MoMA Steve really wanted to see ― and reminisced about their first date and the early years of their relationship.
“I’m sure we’ll find him soon enough, Lieutenant”, Steve replied, softening his expression, “Very soon”.
“Do you really like her?” his mouth moved and the words that came out of it surprised Tony, who didn’t even notice he talked until he heard his own voice reaching his ears.
They walked together to the living room, where Natasha immediately sat on Bucky’s lap. Tony gave Steve one of the beers he was carrying and sat down beside him, accepting a peck on the lips as thanks.
“We’re not trying to be assholes here, okay?” Bucky complained, making a face at his best friend, “We’re just saying that this friendship… the way you talk about him, the way you worry about him, the way you’re staring at a picture of his baby… We know you, Stevie. You fancy him!”
They exited the building in silence, constantly checking the perimeter to make sure nothing was amiss, and made their way to next facility, through a short path between tall trees and a lot of grass.
Tony was sitting on the couch, alone, trying to figure out what was happening when Natasha sat right next to him.
He was so tired he almost didn’t see the post-it stuck on the elevator doors. He frowned at the small, yellow piece of paper before taking it.
Steve didn’t even bother to reply and just focused on greeting a bunch of people he had never seen before in his life.
“The target arrived two days ago in a private jet for a missile presentation. He spent the night in this Air Base and we left for a testing area near Kunar in the morning. The presentation happened as planned. The target was supposed to come back with me, but decided to join Beta Team instead. The convoy left at thirteen hundred hours, as planned”.
“The terrorist group has made no contact with neither family nor work relations of the prisoner, which leads us to believe that they are not interested in money. The Mechanic is quite the ingenious engineer and is the sole developer of most of the technology SHIELD uses, including our weapons, communication equipment and espionage gadgets. If this information fell in the wrong hands, it could mean the end of SHIELD”.
Tony huffed, rolling his eyes. “You didn’t rescue me. You spent three months doing God knows what while I rescued myself. The only thing you’re doing right now is giving me a ride. You’re my Uber. And you’re definitely two stars. I’m writing my review right now, takes too fucking long to show up and doesn’t even have fucking candy. Bullshit”.
“Yeah, yeah, totally fine”, he answered, taking a quick look inside before turning to Tony, the door still almost closed, as if he was afraid Tony might just walk in if he opened it a little bit more.
The corners of Rhode’s mouth went slightly up at the last one as he clearly tried to stop himself from laughing. Steve was very used to that reaction and so he didn’t take offense in it.
, Tony thought to himself. He didn’t understand. Steve always loved when he talked during the movies, he said it was endearing and the commentary ― mostly Tony pointing out the scientific mistakes ― always made the movie more fun. Had Steve been lying before? Telling Tony what he wanted to hear but, in reality, hating it? He blinked and shook his head, trying to concentrate once more in the conversation inside.
Steve always greeted everyone who worked for him on his way up to his office, from the doorman and security guard to his secretary and the intern who brought him coffee. That day was no exception. He smiled at them, asking about their families and their work, smiling when one of the guards, Wade, showed him some pictures of his newly born baby girl. When he finally arrived at his office, he asked Maria, his secretary, to please send flowers to the address he had just texted her.
“If you’re expecting your SHIELD friend to come save you, you’ll be sorely disappointed. He’s been taken care of already”.
“That’s a possibility too, but… You know, I didn’t really want to give myself hope before but Steve had flirted with me a few times, so maybe they’re both unhappy and they need a way out!”
“I’m afraid I’m in a little bit of a disadvantage”, Tony replied, trying not to look as terrified as he felt in that moment, “because I don’t think I know you”.
Tony took a deep breath and closed his eyes, ashamed. Of course Nat knew all about that. She had spent years waiting, hoping that one day James’ memories of her would come back. And she suffered in silence, never letting anyone know what exactly the Winter Soldier meant to her.
Steve seemed to finally realize his mistake. He moaned, covering his face, and fell to the side, pressing his face on the couch.
“Uh… I… had a shitty day, thought we could watch crappy TV and eat some Mexican food. Are you… Are you ok?”
“He was being a dick to me because I missed his birthday”, Rhodes explained, shaking his head with a fond smile, “Said he rather go in the
“We understand”, Wanda said with a heavy accent that always showed itself up again when she was tired or upset, “but we will fix this. I offered to go with Dr. Strange, to help with the research. Vision is already there with him. We will find a solution”.
“Let’s hope army regulations are the only laws they’re breaking here”, Natasha said from the front, leading the team into the pathway.
It was a Thursday when things started to get complicated. Tony had slept over at Steve’s the previous night and left the next morning, after some shower sex and a very nice breakfast. Steve had insisted on giving him a ride, but the mechanic had adamantly refused, assuring the blond that he was more than capable of taking a cab. They parted ways with a kiss and a promise to see each other later that night. Steve watched the cab go with a longing smile on his face and, when it turned the corner and disappeared from view, he finally checked his phone.
“Yeah, that one was to die for. I don’t think I’ve ever eaten a cake this good in my entire life. Stevie, which one is your favorite?”
He nodded and left for the bathrooms just as Tony went in search of their dessert. He finally found the waiter across the room and quickly walked towards him.
, he thought to himself. Even though he was scared, Tony knew he had to try. There was no other choice. And so, with a deep breath and hoping to a God he didn’t quite believe in that everything would turn out okay, he left his hiding spot and, as slowly and silently as possible, made his way out of the room and into the corridor. He looked both ways before running and hiding behind the secretary’s desk.
itsy bitsy chapter for you guys. Are you guys quarantined as well? We have "voluntary isolation" in my country right now, but it's pretty much the same thing. I had to stop working because of it so it's been a struggle, especially to pay the bills. I hope you guys are all okay! Stay safe, stay home and wash your hands as if Justin Hammer just kissed them!
And Tony thought about it. He remembered every happy moment he had with Steve, and how much he loved him. They had hurt each other, he knew, but they could get past it. He knew they could. So he smiled and took the flowers from Steve’s hand, holding them to his chest.
Three months. They had been searching for the target for the last three months. Steve had had long missions before. Sometimes an undercover op. or shadowing a target could go on for days, even weeks. But three months. He’d never been on a mission that lasted three whole months. And what was worse… there was nothing new. There was no new information, no tip, not even a bloody sign as to where the target was or even if he was still alive. In all honesty, Steve had lost all hope to finding the Mechanic alive a long time ago and it seemed that his teammates agreed with him. The U.S. Army and Air Force had withdrawn their people and resources after a month of searches with no result, and had even tried to declare the target Killed in Action. Steve guessed the Director had had some very stern words with them because soon after they received the news that Lieutenant Colonel Rhodes was given a sort of leave to continue to search for the target with the SHIELD agents and that no more claims would be made until the target was found ― dead or alive.
They were all down there, having breakfast, just as JARVIS had said. Bruce was making pancakes while Natasha cut some fruit with the dexterity of a renowned chef. Barton was sitting on top of the kitchen island, eating a bowl of sugary cereal.
“LET ME GO, I’M DONE WITH THIS. I’M DONE, STEVE. YOU WANNA HIDE YOUR WHOLE LIFE, THAT’S FINE, BUT I’M FUCKING DONE BEING YOUR DIRTY LITTLE SECRET”, Tony screamed, pushing Steve away from him.
“For Bonnie. Nothing happened, by the way. A kiss on the cheek when we met at the restaurant, but that was it. I promise”.
Steve and Tony entered the bar hand in hand. The blonde looked around for his friends and found them sitting on a big table in the back, Bucky waving his hands like a lunatic. Steve squeezed Tony’s hand, sending him a reassuring, although strained, smile. The mechanic smiled back at him, leaving a quick kiss on his shoulder before they made their way to the back of the bar. All conversation stopped as soon as they got close.
“I don’t fucking care, Stevie, I’m not marrying you. Not sober, anyway”, he added, taking another long sip from his bottle.
Meanwhile, a very well dressed man was standing in front of Tony’s auto shop, staring at it as he smoked his cigar. He stayed there, watching the windows above the shop for a long time. He threw the expensive cigar on the floor, stepping on it with his very shiny shoes before taking a cell phone from the inner pocket of his jacket.
Steve finally looked up at Bucky, and then turned to look at Tony, blinking several times before answering.
Natasha and Bruce were still laughing like crazy when the elevator doors finally closed, cutting the others out of their line of sight.
The agent sighed and did as he was told. Clint was right; being scary had its advantages. Without another word, Natasha stepped inside the room and closed the door.
“Call Sam. He’ll do it”, Natasha replied, looking at her own cell phone, “We also need flowers and a caterer”.
Natasha seemed confused for a moment. “I thought General Solohob was in charge of the export business”.
“Raza said thank you for the armor design, by the way. He found the pieces in the middle of the desert and thought I might be able to help him put it together. We had a little disagreement, I’m afraid, but don’t worry, my boy. I’ll make good use of your little creation”, Stane said, looking down at the small arc reactor with greedy eyes, “you’ve made me the most powerful man in the world, Tony. It’s a pity you won’t be here to see my triumph”.
“There’s plenty to talk about, Tony. I know you have a plan, a different plan from your aunt’s. I’m here, I can help… Just let me in”, he pleaded, holding Tony’s hands across the table that separated them.
Stane, however, slammed his hand on the door, keeping it open. He glared at Tony and puffed his chest, making Tony take a step back. His heart was beating faster than ever before.
Throughout the years, the Brooklyn boys had lived many adventures, from the time they had gotten matching SpongeBob tattoos to the time when they woke up in the middle of a cornfield in Kansas, with Bucky wearing a very small Hello Kitty t-shirt that said “Fairy Princess” and Steve wearing, well, nothing but his underwear. How they had ended up in Kansas of all places was still a mystery to this day. So, really, after seeing the boys do so many dumb things over the years, Natasha didn’t think they could ever surprise her anymore. She was obviously wrong.
“Oh, I don’t know… You’re amazing, Steve. Anyone would be lucky to have such an incredible, kind, handsome man like you. And I know we haven’t known each other for long, but…” this time, Tony grabbed Steve’s hand and squeezed it, looking anywhere but into his baby blue eyes, “… you deserve someone who respects and loves you. And if you think that isn’t Bucky, then you should talk to him. I’m sure everyone would understand”.
“Yeah, I know. Howard Stark was the brains behind the weapons, right? Makes sense that after his death they’d be out of good ideas”, Bucky explained, shrugging.
"... attacked last night by Russian terrorist, Ivan Vanko, who was previously believed to be dead. Sources say that Justin Hammer, CEO of Hammer Industries, not only aided Vanko in his escape, but also harbored the criminal in one of his facilities, where Vanko built the robots Hammer later introduced at the Stark Expo as his own creations".
“Okay. So, we have the will taken care of. Now, what are we going to do about the rest?” Bucky asked, crossing his arms and letting himself fall back on the couch.
Jarvis wrinkled his nose, as if trying to stop himself from agreeing. “Maybe so, master Anthony, but she made her choice. Other people, like Mrs. Jarvis and myself, are victims of fate”.
“Who the hell are these people? They don’t look military”, the target asked, lying his head on Rhodes’ shoulder.
Steve was very much aware of that. He could actually feel his entire face and chest burning red with embarrassment as Tony smiled at him, showing him the drawing.
and then all of a sudden I’d get this really horrible feeling like I was doing something really really wrong. Like I was…”
“Come on…”, he whispered, trying to get closer to Steve, which was, all things considered, not very easy due to his huge pregnant belly. He managed to get close enough to plant a kiss right under his ear and whispered, “Fuck me, Steve”.
Margaret Carter was proud to say that she had lived a very eventful and interesting life. She had become an agent of the Strategic Scientific Reserve in a time when woman were relegated to answering phones and taking messages, quickly proving her worth in every field mission and soon rising to become one of the most prominent agents in the history of said agency. Then, when the SSR ended, she joined her old friend, Howard Stark, and founded the Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistic Division, also known as SHIELD, a peacekeeping organization whose primary goal was making the world a better place and fighting those who sought to destroy it. She had worked hard and relentlessly all her life, always focused on her work as the Director of SHIELD, making no time for love or romance. Margaret had never much cared about such things, had never really dreamed of a white picket fence with a lovely wife and a couple of children playing in the yard, not even when her darling Angie had been alive, God bless her soul. She simply did not have the time or the inclination to love and care for a child as a mother should. And she wholeheartedly believed that until the day Anthony Stark had been born.
By the afternoon, Steve had already made his decision. He visited his ma in the hospital and told her he had enlisted. She cried and cried, which broke his heart, but he knew it was for the best. He couldn’t tell her about the experiment because he knew she would not like that. She’d most likely talk him out of it and he couldn’t afford that. Neither of them could afford that. So Steve held her as she cried, making promises he wasn’t sure he would be able to keep. And they stayed like that, holding each other until nightfall.
“Just discussing what we’re going to order tonight”, she lied flawlessly and without blinking, “Are you and Tony having dinner with us?”
There was blood everywhere, on the walls, on the furniture, on the floor, but no bodies. Steve could hear the wet, squishy sound of his boots every time he took a step, the metallic smell filling his nostrils, making him grimace. With his Shield still up and ready to face any threats that might appear, he walked alongside Tony, and followed closely by Natasha and Clint, until they were in the middle of the big, well-lit lounge.
On Monday morning, he got dressed and turned on his cell phone. He sent Rhodey a text, asking for a ride. His best friend promptly answered
“What kind of documents?” Steve inquired, stepping closer to Tony, who had just sat down on the couch, looking absolutely overwhelmed.
Tony, in his turn, knew his aunt well enough to know that she meant every word. He nodded, agreeing to her terms, and left the room without another word, being closely followed by Steve and Bucky.
Tony also got closer to Steve’s friends. He had insisted they invite the others over for dinner and refused to take no for an answer. Defeated, Steve had agreed with him in the end and invited the gang over, but not before having a very long conversation with them about respect and boundaries. They all came over on a Friday night. They ordered some pizzas and played board games. At first, they were all very nervous and stiff, and made very little eye contact with Tony. By the end of the night, Bucky was standing on the table, pointing his finger at Tony and screaming that he was a freaking thief while the others laughed and told him he was a sore loser. After that, they decided it would be better to stop playing Monopoly.
“Look how hard you are for me, Mr. Rogers”, he whispered in his ear, taking Steve’s hard cock in his hand and pumping it once, making him moan out loud.
“See, that’s what I’m saying”, Bucky interrupted, pointing at Steve, “That right there. You fall too hard too fast and they take advantage of you”.
“Actually, could he do that, but with Malibu’s PD? And maybe get everyone, not just official missing person’s reports?”
nervous. He kept tapping his foot and looking around and then at his watch every five seconds. He knew he was early, but he couldn’t help it. Steve knew deep down that nothing could happen between him and Tony. He knew that, he did, but he couldn’t help the excitement that threatened to burst out of his body.
Steve wasted no more time and quickly threw Tony back on the bed, completely forgetting all about work and tardiness as he devoured the mechanic’s mouth.
He could not for the life in him understand what was so wrong with a clip-on tie. They were easy and simple, nothing like the stupid normal one that he was currently trying, and failing miserably, to tie. It might as well be a new form of torture for all he knew.
“Sorry, auntie. Oh, and, next time, please send a better team? I had to do all the work myself”, he complained halfheartedly.
written on the top. He exited the car, buttoning his suit and walked inside the building. A red headed woman in a suit quickly came to greet him.
“FROM WHAT?” Steve suddenly shouted, making his friend shrink a little. He took a deep breath to compose himself once more before continuing. “Bucky, what were you trying to protect me from exactly?”
Natasha watched him go and thought about sending yet another text to the boys, but decided against it. This was her chance to put the plan into action; so, with one last look at the phone, she closed the drawer and took the small flash drive around her neck, going straight for Stane’s office. She had a job to do. She only hoped Steve and Bucky would do theirs as well.
Morgan took another step and then another and another, before falling yet again on her ass a few steps away from her father.
As they entered the decorated hall, Doctor Reed saw them and waved, softly touching his wife’s arm to get her attention then pointed at Tony and Steve. She excused herself from her conversation and they both walked towards the couple, welcoming them to the party.
“You leave in fifteen minutes”, Fury suddenly said from behind them with a forceful tone, making everyone but Natasha jump on their chairs, “Get up, gear up, and meet me at Deck 03. Go”.
The words kept getting stronger and stronger inside his mind, shutting down the terrible thoughts that had threatened to engulf him before. By the time the bag of M&Ms was empty, Tony was already feeling better and decided to apologize to Steve the next day.
Natasha looked up, surprised, and watched as the man felt to the ground. She stared at the body, lying beside her, and then at Tony, with an arched eyebrow.
It was past midnight when Ivan Vanko finally left his house, carrying a small bag with him. Jessica had been watching him for hours ― thank God for the ‘to go’ box from the diner ― and was frankly becoming bored out of her mind. The man was small and bulky, with unruly, long hair and a moustache. He looked exactly like the mugshot she had on her phone. She waited until he had gotten into his car ― an old piece of junk ― and driven away. Then, she got to work.
Steve must have noticed the uneasiness in his eyes because he quickly asked, “So, you were talking about that clean energy project before… How does it work again?”
“We’re friends”, he defended himself, taking the beer a bit too forcefully, “And as friends, we share things with each other, it’s normal”.
“That’s understandable”, Natasha said, crossing her arms, “Loki was the one who did it so it’s safe to assume he used magic”, she turns to Tony, her voice turning soft, “We should consult with Strange, maybe he can help”.
Tony shrugged and then looked away, touching his chest where, unbeknownst to Steve, the arc reactor was, his heavy weight a constant reminder that the engineer would carry forever, “I guess… I thought maybe I could use some more friends”.
It was almost 7 PM when Tony finally got back home. He had spent the entire day putting out fires ― sometimes literally ― and, every time he thought he was done, Pepper would show up with something to sign or a problem to solve. He was tired. He was hungry. He wanted a hot shower, some food, and a bed ― preferably with 180 pounds of prime American beef right on top of him.
Toomes looked down at his glass before drinking all of it in one go and sat down on the couch in front of Jessica, looking defeated.
When the Captain finally opened his eyes, Tony was sitting right beside him, focused on his tablet, updating his boyfriend’s uniform while softly complaining about Steve’s refusal to
It all happened to me. In a matter of seconds, Steve threw Tony off himself and to the side, where he would be shielded from whoever had screamed at them, and quickly drew his gun, pointing at the door.
“No. There’d never been a sighting of them near Kunar until yesterday. That’s what’s bothering me. They knew we were coming and they knew who was with us. But the thing is, no one knew T… the target“, Rhodes quickly corrected himself, “was coming that day”.
“Uh, I actually need to use the restroom, so… I’ll be right back”, Tony excused himself, throwing a very apologetic look at Steve.
The next building looked very similar to the last one, the only exception being a small plaque beside the door that said
“Taking it out wasn’t the problem, I think the main issue was putting it in”, Clint replied, making Bucky and Sam immediately shout
“Trust me, I’m going to have a full meltdown once we’re back on the Quinjet. But right now, I’m trying to focus on getting the hell out of here”.
“Uh... You’re kinda of famous. I mean, youngest student to ever get into MIT, right? How old were you when you got in?”
The mechanic jumped off the couch as soon as the doorbell rang, smiling when he saw Steve’s face on the small screen. He pressed the button and said
Suddenly, Bucky dropped his fork on his plate, making a very loud sound, “Sure, you want the coconut one. God, Steve, could you be more of a dick?”
“I don’t remember which one, but everybody was super curious. Especially because one of the chief engineers was supposed to be doing a special project there or something”, she stepped back from the table and smiled at Natasha, “Well, enough gossip. I need to go; the others must be waiting for me. Are you sure you don’t want to join us?”
“Lieutenant Colonel Rhodes, at your service, sir”, he said as Steve shook his hand, “I’m happy to see you, I have to say. We’ll need all the help we can get to locate T…”
The plane ride to Malibu was mostly quiet. Steve kept glancing back at Tony from his seat, sometimes completely ignoring whatever Bucky was saying. He was worried about the engineer, and how could he not be? The Tony he knew was talkative, exuberant, filled with endless energy. This Tony was nothing but a shadow of the original. He knew the engineer was suffering, but his lack of communication was more than Steve could handle.
Steve knew he was being weird. A part of his brain, the part that hadn’t completely shut down after hearing the price of a cupcake ― it costed more than his rent, for God’s sake! ―, was screaming at him that he was being weird.
“Well, we’re gonna see him again for the rehearsal dinner, so maybe I’ll do it then”, Steve replied, defensively.
“Wait, you thought we were dating?” They asked each other at the same time, looking horrified with the very idea.
Bucky huffed and was ready to say something, but Natasha beat him to it. “How are we going to get past them?”
“My name is Harold. Doctor Harold Beesly. I work at Stark Industries, sir. It is very nice to meet you”, he said, extending a hand, which Tony promptly took.
“Yeah, but… I don’t know, I’m not very good at it”, Steve replied, sounding a bit sad, “I don’t think I’m going to call her again. It’s just… She’s probably going to say no, anyway, so…”
“I’m never late for work”, Steve tried to reason, but completely lost his trail of thought when he felt Tony’s hot mouth on his neck, his tongue slowly going up to his ear just as the mechanic’s hand found his dick under the black boxers.
“I can’t believe we hung out on my dumpster of an apartment when we could’ve been hanging out here”, he put the pizza on the table nearby and walked to the nearest couch, touching it, “You know, I love how you’re the perfect mixture between fancy rich and Brooklyn broke”.
During her pregnancy, Maria Stark had fallen victim to the newest tendency amongst the rich socialites of California: the all natural birth. She had insisted that little Anthony should be born in their home, surrounded by his loved ones as opposed to a hospital full of loud machines and strangers. She had nearly driven her husband insane with worry and, despite his very passionate speeches about her safety as well as the baby’s, she’d had the final word on the matter. And so, Anthony had been born in the mansion’s master bedroom, with the help of a very competent midwife and under Anna Jarvis’ watchful eye. Margaret heard the unhappy wails of the baby before she and Howard had even entered the room. The ever proper Maria held the baby awkwardly in her arms, looking nothing like the very composed socialite Margaret knew her to be, her eyes dropping lightly most likely from the tiredness brought by the very difficult birth.
“Why is he calling me sir? Has it been three months or three years? Am I old? Rhodey, am I old? Be honest”.
And then, there was the watch. After he opened the little black box and saw the watch, everything seemed to change. Steve couldn’t understand. Tony loved that watch. And he knew his boyfriend had been really upset when the watch was destroyed in a fight with the Wrecking Crew. He really thought Tony would be happy to have one just like it. Of course, it wasn’t the exact same watch, but it was something, right? Steve had gone through a lot of trouble to get him that gift. Even paid a little fortune ― more than he was ever comfortable spending on anything, to be completely honest ― just to put a smile on his partner’s face. He couldn’t understand why Tony didn’t like it. Better yet, he couldn’t understand why Tony didn’t tell him why he didn’t like it.
And try they did. For the next hours, Steve and Tony mingled. They talked to various celebrities about the most mundane things; they talked about business and about the donations made that night. At one point, Tony had been introduced to Dr. Bruce Banner and they’d had promptly started a discussion about something that Steve didn’t understand in the slightest. He stood there, beside Tony, as they talked. Even though he felt completely lost, he couldn’t help but smile at his partner’s happiness. He was so excited, so enthralled by the subject that Steve could not find it in him to separate the two scientists. He listened for a while before excusing himself to get a drink.
“Shh, don’t open your mouth too wide. I told you it’d be painful”, she replied in an ‘I told you so’ tone, “You should eat only soft food for at least a few days. It’ll take a couple of weeks to fully heal”.
She called Jarvis as soon as Tony hung up, desperately trying to reach the butler who did not pick up the phone. She would later find out that Jarvis was busy receiving the most disturbing news in the hospital, being held by his crying wife as the doctor explained his chances of survival. In that moment, however, she couldn’t help but curse the butler as she sat on the plane, worried sick about her darling boy who had sounded so terrified over the phone. She arrived at Malibu a few hours later, taking a cab to the mansion. Margaret wasn’t stupid. Howard and she had been friends for many years, a friendship that had started based on their mutual desire to prove their worth in a world that constantly told them they were not enough. She knew the man’s qualities and she knew his flaws. On her last visits, she had noticed how there was always a glass of scotch attached to Howard’s hand, how fast he lost his inhibition, slurring his words as he talked about lost hope and business difficulties. But, most of all, she had noticed how his eyes always seemed to narrow every time he turned his attention to Anthony.
“All here, Mr. Stane”, the red headed woman said, putting the papers on his desk, “Is there anything else I can do for you tonight?”
“Uh… Steve actually sent them to, uh… Well, he told the kid to give them to the one in the red sweater”.
There had been a camera right there on the crime scene. It should have recorded the whole accident, but it had mysteriously ‘not worked’ that night. The fact that the cops hadn’t bothered to thoroughly investigate the matter told Jessica that some palms had obviously been greased. The missing footage, on the other hand, told her that something must have happened between the moment Stark lost control of the car and the moment they hit that tree, something suspicious enough that they had to get rid of the evidence. And that was a very good start.
The engineer paid Steve no mind and continued to button his shirt, facing the mirror with a very determined look on his face.
“Shhh”, Michele replied, “they’re gonna hear you. So, what are we going to do? You think maybe they’re the evil we’re supposed to end?”
noise. His voice was starting to become hoarse. He hadn’t even noticed he was still screaming. His wide eyes suddenly started blinking and the screams stopped. The room was slowly fading. The voices going softer and softer, lower and lower, until Tony finally passed out, going completely limp in the cot.
“I’m Doctor Abraham Erskine. I represent the Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistic Division”.
He was in the communal kitchen, a place he had avoided plenty these past few months, when Steve arrived, looking a bit sheepish.
“Yep. Pretty good, too. But they shelved the program when it became Stane Industries. In fact, they shelved every single program that didn’t have weapons in it”, Bucky explained, flexing his metal arm, “I was lucky to get one before they did. It could use an update, but at least it’s still working”.
He opened his eyes and took one last deep breath before starting the car and driving away to the mall. His decision was made. All he had to do now was tell Ty.
“Tony”, Steve whispered, taking his partner’s face on his hands, “I could never be happy without you. Even when I didn’t remember you, I could feel something was missing. And even when you told me to go for it with Bonnie, every single second I spent with her I kept thinking something was wrong, that I was doing something wrong. It felt like I was cheating and I had no idea why”.
“Yeah, but he wouldn’t shut up about his goddamn new guns at the fundraiser so I told Hill we’d give him a chance. But, to be fair, Stane isn’t much better lately”.
And so, for the past two years, much to Rhodey’s displeasure, Steve and Tony had been secretly seeing each other. Bucky, and his girlfriend, Natasha, knew Tony only as “Steve’s friend from MIT” and seemed to think nothing of it. Sometimes, Natasha would try to set Steve up with one of her friends, and Steve would politely decline while saying he just didn’t have the time for that. And it killed a little bit of Tony when it happened, but he would stand there, every time, a fake smile on his face as he pretended to be Steve’s very straight friend.
Tony smelled coffee. He slowly opened his eyes, blinking. The other side of the bed was empty, but it was very much obvious that it had been occupied before. He smiled as he remembered the events of the night before. The way Steve had worshipped his body, his mouth slowly discovering every inch of him, his hands memorizing every curve. The young mechanic had been with his fair share of partners, men and women alike, but he could safely say that none of them had ever pulled him apart like Steve had. He had fallen right asleep after hours and hours of lovemaking, too satisfied and tired to stay awake any longer. He could still feel the delicious ache in his body as he moved on the bed, stretching his arms and legs like a cat.
Stane chuckled. “Come on, now, my boy! I wasn’t happy about it. Do you think I wanted to give up my golden goose? I didn’t! You gave me no choice! But then… You had to go and put that stupid code on the Jericho and make everything harder than it had to be. That’s so like you, Tony, always making things harder for me”, he said, shaking his head, “So, here’s what’s going to happen, okay? You’re going to give me the code for the Jericho”.
