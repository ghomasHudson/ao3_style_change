And it should have been easy to solve this issue; easy to let the old fruit vendor know that she was simply mistaken. But his brain conveniently forgot how to speak English at that moment, as it always did when he needed it to do its job the most.
sleep tonight,” he knew that if he could see her face right now, she’d have a gentle smile playing on her lips, full of sympathy and care. This was the smile she usually had right before she gave him one of her light, barely there hugs that always made him feel like he was made of glass.
Steve had expected that the genius would have relaxed after the kid relinquished his grip on his legs. Maybe it was physical contact? Peter did tend to spring up on people, enjoying the act of giving out surprise hugs. But Tony had never been one for jump scares, and maybe the physical contact made the experience uncomfortable for him. And yet, when Peter pulled away, instead to be distracted with the shiny and interesting workshop, Tony still stood stalk still, pale and tense.
like an asshole. Steve was good at sensing that sort of thing.
Because he knew that would. In a heartbeat.
“Nat and Clint are down with the recruits,” Tony explained, lifting his leg in order to tap Steve’s hip and push him out of the line of fire, “Bruce’s in the labs with Thor. They’ll both be a while- the place goes into lockdown when the siren sounds.”
Running a hand through his hair, he lost himself in the doodles for a while. Just rough sketches- Bucky and Natasha curled around one another,  the Icecream parlour Steve had taken Tony to that one time, the view out of his window. They weren’t any good, of course- he never really had been, but it still soothed him anyway. It was nice to let his emotions flow out from his head into his fingers, shaky and rough and his.
At 7, his phone started ringing. And ringing. And ringing.
“Bye,” was all Steve called out, before sliding out into the corridor and immediately pressing Tony against the wall, mouth meeting Tony’s possessively, greedily.
Steve sighed, the succession of beats speeding up just a fraction as the man pulled himself further out of the doze that he’d been in. He turned into Tony and nestled his head into the mess of curls under his chin, and then rested his own hand lightly down against his chest, just over Tony’s. 643 and counting. “It’ll still be there when you wake up,” he murmured.
Steve realised, with a startling sort of intensity, that he was very much in love with Tony Stark. Hopelessly so.
“I…what?” Tony asked, momentarily forgetting his fury in order to stare at Steve in confusion.
But it was bullshit. If Tony fell, Steve would always be there. Without hesitation.
Steve would happily spend the rest of his life right where he was: hands and mouth and body on Tony’s, learning every inch of his skin.
Steve rolled his eyes and hoped Tony wasn’t going to take them somewhere too foolish- anywhere past the state and he was putting his foot down- but then Tony leaned down and curled their hands together and Steve quickly decided fuck it, he’d go wherever Tony took them.
“I know you argue with me,” Steve continued, “but I see the way your hands shake when you do. How you force yourself to move forward even when your body language is screaming ‘run’. I’m not blind, Tony. You’re still—you’re still scared of me.”
He was going to break. He could feel it-- any moment now, he was going to shatter like glass. The tidal wave was coming, and it was about to drown him.
Across the room and sat on his ass helplessly, Steve’s head jerked up, eyes wide and horrified. “I didn’t even touch him,” he whispered, “he just… I was sat here trying to, to prepare myself, and then he grabbed my hand and- and now he’s stuck!” Steve lifted his hand, showing the splayed out palm that Peter’s fingers appeared to be sticking to as if glued in place. He was giggling to himself, clearly unfazed. “I don’t know what I did Tony! I was just sat here and now I… he’s stuck! I didn’t-”
12 hours of sleep beforehand.
“WHY DID YOU LEAVE!” He shouted again, feet turning grass to mud as he slammed the sole of his shoe down on the earth, “WHY COULDN’T YOU JUST HAVE- could have-“
Steve sighed, stepping over a pile of plastic rods which looked as if they had no place in a teenage boy’s room, and then made his way carefully over to his ridiculous boyfriend. “You’re ridiculous,” he said, just for good measure, pressing a finger into Tony’s chest and then scooping up a splat of purple just over his heart. “Why did you even decide to make paint? You’re an engineer. Would’a thought you’d have just built another robot or something.”
“Ugh,” Steve rolled his eyes and then let them shut again as Tony’s hand moved to brush the hairs off his forehead, “long week, more like.”
, do you?"
participate had always been more than enough to satiate him every October. He’d spend hours looking through Pinterest at costume ideas, scrolling Instagram and watching everyone decorate their homes and faces with amazing art in celebration. Plus, even if he couldn’t go out or dress up, there really was nothing better than cosying up with your pet robot and a bowl of popcorn and sitting to watch scary films all night in the dark.
It took Tony a moment, but then he smiled and stuck out a hand like a baby asking to be held. Sometimes Steve had to remind himself that he was dating someone who’d been expelled four different times, because seriously, the boy that was in front of him was so far from any of that it was insane. This Tony Stark was… cute as shit. That was really the only way to describe it.
Steve’s smile dropped off, and he began to shake his head, but Tony wasn’t having it that time. He jumped out of bed at a record speed and headed to the bathroom, giving Steve a thumb’s up before locking the door firmly behind him. Whatever Steve’s problem with Peter was, he could sure as hell get over it, because Tony downright refused to do the changing for a second time when Steve hadn’t done it once.
explain why he never acted like he had any feelings for Steve at all whenever he was around those that weren’t in their immediate circle. The quick covering-up of the hickeys and the careful dates that were never to skate rinks or shopping malls, but secluded restaurants or dark movies. And then of course, just now, how Tony had quietly sidestepped around the term ‘boyfriend’, because he was around different people now, right? These people looked expensive. And Steve… well, he was wearing his smart clothes, but they still probably cost about half the price of just one stupid sock on those guys’ feet.
Tony stares up at him, looking at the scruffy blond hair and slightly parted lips as he breathes softly and evenly, still curled around Tony protectively, even in his sleep.
His eyes closed with a defeated little hitching of his breath. He felt a hand press against his cheek.
Ty was removed pretty swiftly from his vicinity before any punches managed to get landed however, and Steve watched in surprise as a blur of leather jacket and dark hair rushed in front of Steve, grabbing Ty by the neck of his sweater and then yanking him sideways, shoving him into the nearby wall. Sam and Clint were at his side a moment later and he turned in surprise, looking at all his friends as they barged through the crowd and found him.
The call cut, and Steve giggled like a kid into the empty room before turning on his heel and scrambling for the bathroom. Once inside, he briefly despaired over the state of his hair in the dusty mirror, before grabbing his comb and trying to flatten it into place. A quick wash of his face and rigorous teeth-brushing later, and he was about as good as he was going to get.
by how painful that is to think about. How stupidly attached he’s become, not only to the Birdbrain, but the whole damn team. Remembering Clint, sat still and silent on the top of the tower with a half-empty bottle of whatever-the-fuck in his hand and an empty look in his eyes… it haunts him.
“Hey,” he said from across the street, swallowing the lump that had gathered in the back of his mouth, “I’m looking for Tony Stark. You seen him around anywhere?”
, of all things.
“Get out,” Tony told him again, hard and sharp. “
Steve nodded, and then looked at Tony’s upturned palm. He hurriedly pulled out the laser-cutter from his pocket and handed it over. “Don’t be loud, people might hear us.”
Tony looked at him blankly. “Huh?”
And then he laughed.
“Please don’t kill him,” was all he said, looking at her helplessly.
Immediately, Steve pointed to Tony and Tony nodded back over to Steve.  "We're both out," Steve said firmly, "so if it's anyone's, it's Clint or Thor or Bruce."
“Steve,” the familiar voice, with all of the inflections Steve had used to hear in the mornings when the world was easier and softer and Tony still cared about him, spoke up through the room again. The acidity in his tone was gone now, and Tony’s face broke out into a tired smile as he shut his eyes and side. “Oh, Steve. You stubborn, reckless, selfish asshole. I wish… well, for a lot of things. Mostly that we’d been together when this went down. Maybe it wouldn’t all have gone so wrong.” He sighed. “I’m sorry, for what it’s worth. I never gave you a chance to apologize, to even try and fix things. Too angry, I guess. Too bitter. But you know— well, I suppose you don’t, but—I, uh. I never stopped. Loving you, that is. Hell, there were plenty of times when I wished I could. Plenty of times when I hated your guts. But even then, I still… yeah. You’re still my sure thing, Rogers.” He glanced up and quirked his mouth upright, probably remembering every time when Steve had been the one to tell him that, arms wrapped around Tony’s midsection and holding him tight as they laughed together.
“Right,” Steve declared, bending down and taking Tony’s shoulder softly, “come on, love, I think it’s time to stop, for now.”
Steve’s hands stroked across his shoulder blades in a soothing motion, and he slowly rocked the two of them back and forth. Tony just sat there, hating himself, his hands curled tightly into Steve’s bare waist as he forced himself not to break, to sob. Neither of them needed that just then, Jesus.
He ducked his head and pushed his knees up to his chest, feeling his face crumble against his hands. He’d tried not to let himself do this, tried to focus on Tony as much as he could, but it was too much. He was too weak. Everything was ruined and it was his fault, and he knew, he knew that even if they tried to fix this, the likelihood was that they just couldn’t. Because Tony had already been through so much, he’d already done this before with other people he’d been in relationships with, and Steve was now just another person on that fucking list.
Steve didn’t wake her, in the end. He could manage the night shift on his own.
Something dropped out of Tony’s stomach as his mind put together the pieces. “Steve?” He called out again, feeling a tremor in his voice. They
He stopped walking, a billion things in his eyes as they locked onto each other across the grass. Tony tried to take the next step down, but his knees gave out and he stumbled, slipped forward. But it was okay. Steve caught him by the elbow, gentle as he could make it, keeping Tony off the ground and holding him steady. All the air in the world wasn’t enough for his lungs. Tony was
Strong hands pulled at his shoulders, but he held on. He had to hold on- that was all he knew. He had to hold on. If he let go, they’d die. Bucky and Tony and everyone he’d loved, all of them, gone, because he couldn’t catch them-
“I’m not going anywhere,” Tony told him smoothly, fingers stroking Steve’s floppy hair out of his face, “I’m sorry I said those things and then left you to stew over them. I should have been more considerate. I know today was hard. It’s okay now though, Steve, I promise, I’m fine.”
He saw Zeke nod slowly, shrugging. “I think you should be. You’re in too deep, man- running around with Stark, trying to pretend you’re someone. But you’re not. You’re just a nobody. You didn’t even pick the right guy to suck up to, either, instead of someone with actual status you just went to the school whore-“
“It really is. Bit of a mood-killer, but I think you’ve made the message clear enough. How did you say it earlier-
fault. I didn’t know how to cope with it, how to make you better, so I did the only thing I was good at and ran away. You pushed me, but I let myself get pushed. I wasn’t there for you. Then when I found out about Obadiah and Stark Industries, and I just… I focused more on work than I did on
The older man nodded, and heavy silence fell once more. Steve wasn’t even sure where to begin, so he started with an apology. “Mr. Wilson, I am so sorry—”
“I highly doubt that.”
He swallowed sharply and pinched his nose, trying to stop the bleeding. On the bed above him, Tony was silent.
The LMD’s face whipped over to him, the vicious smile dropping off his face. A second later, Tony felt more than heard the low vibration push its way through the room, and finally, finally, the LMD reacted to it. His face twisted and his body stiffened, all of his actions suddenly getting interrupted by the pitch.
“Ah. Right. Yes,” Steve said quickly, looking down and feeling his cheeks get hot.
Tony was angry. Rightfully so. Steve remembered back in 2015, the first time Tony had told them all that this would happen. The previous mission had made him erratic, scared, frightened enough that he’d made some stupid calls. Steve had been so angry that Tony hadn’t just talked to him about it first, and Tony had desperately tried to tell him that he was doing it for them, for the greater good. Steve had just thought Tony was afraid, and acting irrationally because of it. He hadn’t listened.
Tony watched him as he sat in Sam’s spot, his legs crossed and knees just touching Tony’s own on the floor. He knew Tony was smiling, but he looked down as he placed the bowl of water down to his left and the first-aid kit on the opposite side.
he wanted to ask, so very badly- where was Tony’s dad through all that? How did he end up abandoning such a brilliant boy; leaving him to destroy himself, slowly and methodically? How could anyone do that?
, no kicking—I just need to get you to keep still for a moment, alright?” He ducked under another swinging punch and then blocked the oncoming knee that came up to meet him, before shoving Steve away and blasting ten feet into the air. Steve went stumbling back a few steps, eyes going back to Tony. But before he could recalibrate, Tony was descending on him rapidly, arms outstretched, repulsors firing.
“What?”
Tony was quiet for a few more moments, and then, “JARVIS?”
Steve choked again, and Tony waited patiently by his side until he was finished. “It wasn’t just your ass,” he said in the end, a little weakly, “you have a very nice…everything.”
second, and when I come back, you’re nearly brawling in the middle of the fucking living room? What the hell even fucking happened?”
Tony didn’t bother with a speech; he chose instead to just slap Steve lightly around the back of the head and then snatch the cup from his hand, taking a sip before Steve could stop him.
“I really do have to go do a bit of work before I come to bed,” Tony told him with a pulled face, “I kind of left in a rush.”
So, in that moment, he made a decision.
Steve looked bewildered, but he kept his cool. “How is that a—”
Everyone pulled a face. "God, no, we're not doing that," Tony said defensively, "this is a small human, not an agent. They're not going to be much use with him."
but then Steve’s lip tilted upward, and the worries trickled out of his mind like they’d never even been there.
The door was yanked open and Steve watched in surprise as someone’s hand flew out and shoved Tony off the step, sending him sprawling onto the gravel a few feet away.
Steve gawped, shaking his head. “I- I couldn’t possibly ask that-”
Tony snapped, turning to face Steve angrily. “You want me to say it?
“And your intentions
“No,” he answered eventually, body loosening as he shrugged. His eyes went over Steve’s head, meeting with Tony’s, where they stayed for a few seconds. “Just wanted to check in on Tony. You’re coming out tonight, right?”
Tony laughed, and Natasha saw, but she just rolled her eyes and smiled a little, squeezing his arm. “We had a long think about what to get you this year- it was kinda difficult, as always, to buy anything for you, considering the fact you are a billionaire and can therefore buy anything you so desire.”
he feel? He couldn’t really describe it. Like floating on a cloud, high above everything else that mattered. God. Tony was… Tony had given him his voicemail back, and he’d run Steve over to a corner of God only knows where in New York to watch the sun set, and he’d kissed Steve like he was the only important thing in the world-
In his arms, Peter was now starting to chew on Tony’s tie, making little sounds now and then. He seemed unfazed by the two large humans that were pressing him in on both sides, and Tony looked down, watching as Peter beat a little fist against Steve’s shirt in an attempt to grab his attention. Steve glanced at him, giving the boy a tight smile.
Steve laughed, shutting his eyes as he took another drag. It had been what- ninety years, now, since his last smoke? He didn’t even have the craving any more, but it was so familiar, it had almost the same effect as if he had.
Tony just watched him for another minute, gauging his reactions. When Steve said nothing, he leaned back in his chair as far as the cuffs would allow. He looked truly beaten; a look Steve had never seen on Tony’s face before, not since the day they’d met. “I trusted you,” he whispered, short, simple, damning. “You told me you loved me and I
Both of them huffed in amusement, before settling down into a few moments of silence. Tony could still hear the heart-monitor on the other side of the room, confirming what Tony could hear under his own fingers. He knew that he wasn’t going to forget what had happened any time soon. Then again, there were a lot of things that he couldn’t forget. That was, unfortunately, just part of the package deal. Tony could live with it- at least it would only return in his dreams, and not reality.
, I didn’t—I never meant—” His breath hitched shakily as he drew his hands up to his face and shielded himself from Steve. “I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m fucking pathetic, s’all my fault, I—”
“Well it’s gonna have to wait, Steve, it’s not fucking important,” Tony snapped at him, combing his fingers through his hair and straightening it up.
Steve blinked at him. “Then what the hell are we supposed to with him?” He said bewilderedly, “Tony, sweetheart, you have to be rational. That’s the only place for him—”
Steve swallowed. He hated how he always reacted so easily to the things Tony said about him. He
Steve’s mood had been consistently low the past few weeks, although he seemed better when he was around the team than he did when he was only with Tony. But whatever it was that was doing it, it made him more argumentative, more quick to anger, more generally sulky than ever before. He was also starting to look constantly ill; a pallor to his cheeks and a redness to his eyes that shouldn’t ever usually be there. Tony tried to get him to go to medical, to maybe talk about it- sometimes Steve didn’t sleep when the insomnia came around, too busy being plagued by flashbacks and nightmares- but Steve never accepted any help. He only got snappy when Tony pushed.
He heard Sam and Bucky begin to mess around in the other room, and threw a pillow at the door in order to shut off the noise. It didn’t do much good- Sam’s walls were notoriously thin- and he cursed in annoyance, knowing he would only last so long before he gave up completely and went to join them, detention be damned. Once his ass left the vicinity of that homework, it wasn’t going back.
Fine.
"Tony, you can't even come out with me; you made plans with those guys tonight, remember?"
He lifted his hands, raising them in defeat. Suddenly, for some reason, he felt a little shaky. Steve could look... well, he could look scary when he wanted to. Not that Tony was
He turned to Steve and flicked his head. “This way,” he said cheerfully.
He wanted to know the sounds he made when Steve went lower, too.
The dull, droning voice of his teacher went through one ear and out the other as Steve stared blankly out of the window into the corridor and tried willing himself to focus. Monday mornings were a terrible invention; the person with that idea really should have thought that through before they’d gone and decided on it.
In his head, he heard the voice of his girlfriend from back when he was twenty, looking at him in surprise when he’d said no to marrying her. They’d known eachother for two fucking months, but hey- being the next of kin of a Stark paid pretty well, so she’d taken her shot. Then, when he’d rejected her, she’d left the next day. That was it. He’d fulfilled his use, he’d bought her the expensive rolex and the Gucci dress that she’d always wanted, but once that’d dried up, there was no point in keeping him around.
cool of you.”
Tony laughed, then, and it looked fond. He was obviously close to the other boy. “Yeah, that’s Thor. Utterly fucking terrifying if you get on the wrong side of him, but very comforting if you’re a friend. Saved my ass a few times, that’s for sure.”
Tony watched, not registering the greeting Bruce sent his way from the kitchen. The man was preparing dinner, probably—it was a Sunday, so they all ate together. He thought Nat and Clint were probably in the kitchen too, but he didn’t turn to check.
Thor tried to argue it, but his face told a different story, and Steve could see he was already struggling to remain awake. He probably could’ve if he’d shoved some caffeine down his throat, but he didn’t need to. Steve was here to keep watch, and so eventually Thor conceded, making Steve promise to wake him if anything happened. He tucked a corner of Tony’s blanket in under his shoulder absently before he said a quiet goodnight to Steve, the action ultimately useless, but full of obvious affection. “Stay out of trouble ‘til I get back,” he told the sleeping boy, before giving Steve one last nod and stumbling off to his bedroom exhaustedly.
the cold. He fucking hated it.
Steve’s face twisted in disgust. It seemed a little overdramatic considering the nature of their argument, but before Tony could pull him up for the exaggerated glare, Steve’s next words permeated the room.
“That hurts,” Clint said, and Tony opened his mouth to add in when suddenly another muffled set of footsteps sounded down the hall, and Clint’s eyes widened. “Fuck,
Tony’s body was warm next to him, and one of Steve’s hands was lying loosely over his hip. It fit well; he liked it. It belonged there, really. Tony belonged here forever, in bed with him, careless. There was nothing else in the world except them- or at least it felt like it, in that moment in time. If he turned his head just then, he knew what he’d see.
“I know he has,” Steve said, voice dead as he looked down at the floor, “I remember.”
but Tony wasn’t dumb. Of all the things they said to one another- alone and with friends, laughing and joking, when Tony was crying and Steve was curled around him kissing his cheeks and whispering everything he loved about Tony into his ear- it was the things said during arguments were always the bitterest of truths. Steve wasn’t like Tony. He didn’t yell just to yell, spit insults that held no truth to them just to get a reaction. He only ever told people the truth of the matter.
Tony looked between the two of them. “You know, you two are really instilling—ugh,
“Oh, absolutely,” Steve admitted freely, standing up and then smacking Tony’s ass gently as he passed to grab his own toothbrush- manual, because he’d never really gotten used to the strange buzzing feeling in his mouth. Tony laughed, leaning back against Steve’s chest as he gently squeezed out some more stuff from the nearly-empty tube and then dabbed it onto different parts of his face. Steve simply brushed his teeth and watched, until two minutes were up and he leaned over the sink. Tony, however, was still going through his bag of creams and potions, rubbing all of them into his skin one by one. Steve, with nothing else to do at that point, simply rested his chin into Tony’s shoulder and then curled his arms gently around Tony’s body, resting one hand on the other man’s bare hip and his other across the cool ridge of the arc reactor. Sleepiness still hung over him like a comforting blanket and he sighed gently, shutting his eyes and relaxing forward a little. Tony was so nice to wake up to.
Steve could feel himself smiling adoringly over at him, but he didn’t even care. Not even when Bucky smacked him across the back of the head and called him a sap.
Steve stared at him incredulously before it suddenly dawned on him and he gaped, sucking in a large mouthful of the ass-tasting air. “Bucky, did you
Steve was almost about to take him up on that offer, but then Natasha pushed her way through the crowds and swiftly crushed the little invention down against the table. Clint, again, just stared at it in vague disappointment. "Oh."
Steve rolled his eyes and scoffed down some more of his food as Tony and Clint continued to chat over his shoulders. Eventually the two boys seemed to come to some sort of agreement about one punch from Tony being equal to three donuts bought for him or something, and Steve tried to ignore them as they shook hands over his head, holding out the hope that Tony was simply joking and wouldn’t
But he supposed duty called, or whatever.
Thor arose from his tomb of blankets and sweet wrappers, turning to face the voice whose owner was obscured by the wall of blankets. “No, but I
doesn’t want to fuck someone?”
he’d make it perfect. He’d learned a lot about Tony over the years. He knew that the boy liked Metallica, but he also had a soft spot for Frank Sinatra. Steve had a record of that which he’d play. And then Tony loved Twinkies, too. Steve could buy them, and he’d declare it their main course, and Tony would laugh that pretty laugh where his mouth curled up and his eyes crinkled and-
With a small grin to himself, he pressed the button at the front of the big door, and waited to be buzzed in. Thor’s house was grand as well- although admittedly, not quite as extravagant as Tony. He lived in an apartment complex, but not the sort that Steve had used to inhabit. These obviously reeked of money. Steve had seen a fucking pool when he’d been walking up- the thought of having one of those just lounging around his home was just absurd to him, but whatever. Just how the other half lived, he figured.
“I can help.”
Well. That was it, wasn’t it? Really?
Steve laughed. “You’re so fucking weird.”
Down the line, Natasha cursed. “Soon as I cut it, you know the protocol, Steve. The whole building gets put on lockdown and the holding cells are all checked.”
Ah. Yes. Friends. Important friends that were probably still worried about his safety. And things. Right.
“To be fair,” and this time it was Thor leaning over to speak to Tony, one eyebrow raised mischievously, “I’m pretty sure you embarrassed yourself far more than you embarrassed Steve.”
SHIELD agents do the rest of the heavy lifting, while you sit and take the praise for it, okay?” He scoffed loudly and then turned on his heel without another word, marching down the corridor in that stupid swaggery way of his. Steve kept his mouth shut and took a few deep breaths, steadying himself. Rumlow was the least of his problems right now, after all.
Steve woke slowly, as he always did. His hands had torn the sheets in half easily. He could taste the blood at the back of his throat.
what you were… oh, oh fuck, I thought-“
like he meant it- but then again, God only knew what went on in Tony’s head. Steve had known him for a while now, but he was still managing to leave Steve confused with almost every conversation.
He sighed, pushing back the thoughts and squeezing between the crowds. It had been a hard week. But he was glad he had his friends to fall back on- he was glad they were there. And hell- maybe Sam was thinking along the right lines, maybe he
They smiled at each other for another moment or two, before Tony cleared his throat and patted Steve’s thigh. “Let’s go home and watch Peter try and pronounce a hard ‘R’ sound,” he declared, “but stop off at Dunkin’ Donuts on the way.”
Tony frowned. “Steve?”
Tony shook his head a little, head turning to the floor. “I just… don’t ever think I have met someone quite like you, Steve Rogers,” he declared with a confused voice, looking upward at Steve through those stupid long lashes.
“—me too—”
His hands were shaking the next time he looked back to his phone, and he felt Tony gently pull him back down into a sitting position after a second, which was probably for the best.
His HUD picked up the compound a second later, half covered with permafrost and tucked away at the bottom of the biggest mountain. Steve was somewhere in there. Or at least, Tony was praying he was somewhere in there. He was just running on the hope that whatever they’d done with him, they’d done it here and not transferred him somewhere else. In this wasteland, trying to hunt him down would be damn near impossible.
Steve didn’t say anything, and Tony looked up, squinting from the sunlight on his face. “I’m trying to protect you,” he said casually, fascinated by whatever cloud his eyes were latched on, “because if I don’t, then you’ll end up like me. And I wouldn’t wish that on anyone.”
be telling the truth, right?”
“Steve, are you… are you on
Steve grimaced and he tensed, mouth opening to respond with something scathing- but before he even could, there was suddenly a shadow across his side, and looked up to see Thor sidling up to them both. His face was hard.
- you have people. You’ve got all your buddies, you’ve got the Wilsons. And you’ve got me- for when you end up in the deep end and need someone already swimming in there to help pull you out.” He shot off a grin and then pushed the cigarette in between it, before patting his jacket in search of a lighter.
“You’re such an idiot,” Tony muttered above him, and oh, okay, it was
Steve was still blushing, and he shook his head as he wrapped his hand around Tony's waist and pulled him in. "I only sang to him," he mumbled, "you probably would have done it better."
The team slowly filtered out after a while, heading off to various jobs and rooms and meetings and whatnot, until eventually it was Tony and Steve with the communal floor to themselves. They floated over to the living room and then got comfy on the couch sat directly in front of the TV, Tony stacking himself lazily across Steve and then resting his cheek into the warmth of Steve’s sternum. The more relaxed Tony was, the more catlike he tended to become, and so Steve was hardly even surprised when, a few minutes and some gentle hair-stroking later, Tony began to do what Steve could only describe as purring. He smiled and chuckled softly, twirling his finger through a curl at the back of Tony’s neck and then listening to the way Tony hummed deep in the back of his throat, happy and content and already half asleep again. They were watching some movie on Tv- The Princess Bride, it looked like- but Steve couldn’t really say he was concentrating. Far more important things were happening right under his nose.
His cheeks were wet, hands pressed tightly into his eyes as he curled into a ball and shook. He felt cold. In his bones, in his soul- Bucky was talking to him, Bucky was pinning him, but he was saying things that didn’t make sense; Tony was gone. Tony had fallen.
Steve didn’t even consider it. “Not happening, sweetheart,” he said, bringing Tony’s hand close to his lips and then pressing a soft kiss to the knuckles, “I’ve texted all of them. They know where I am, and I’ll ring them in the morning.”
Steve
Caught in the explosion of an IED while in active duty. Steve had been by her side when he’d seen the bomb go off. The look in her eyes - the terror, the realisation, the acceptance – was forever burned into his brain, and not even in seventy years would he ever forget it. He got lucky that day. A foot closer, and he would have been hit by the rubble. On his darker nights, he wished that he had. As it was, however, he’d been unharmed, only there to watch and witness as his lifelong best friend was killed in front of him.
Palming a hand over his eyes, he looked at his clock on the bedside. Since walking off and then moping around, it had been about an hour since he’d left Tony. He should probably call- at least apologize for just walking off like that.
Tony smiled as Steve huffed again, turning around and properly squashing his cheek into Tony’s shoulder. “Don’t be pathetic,” he muttered.
Tony just waited a few seconds until Steve was finished having his small moment of panic, and then positively beamed when Steve looked up at him the next time around. “You better fucking catch me, Stark, I swear to Christ.”
“Wilson, no form of physical violence is considered justifiable in this school, and after this debacle, you can guarantee that that place on the program is being put under review,” Fury snapped at him, and Sam’s face went tight. He sat up a little straighter and curled his hands into fists stubbornly.
His eyesight went a tad blurry at that, but he still managed to spot Clint, half-way to clambering up the left side of the ‘A’ and looking thoroughly pissed. “We had to bribe JARVIS to find you! We thought real baddies had taken you! And here you are, just fucking kissing eachother like gross idiots on the side of the tower! Fuck you, honestly, I’m never playing with you guys again, you’re no fun-”
But Tony had always lived dangerously. And there was no way in hell that he could ever, ever stop loving Steve now.
He knew what it was. Knew what he felt. It had been pretty obvious that he was crushing on the guy since the first day- but he could tell that this was more than that. He knew what falling in love felt like.
Steve nodded, because it was true. Because he didn’t know enough about time travel to even give a hypothesis, and all he could do was hope. “At least there might not be a rift between us when Thanos comes,” Steve murmured, “at least we have the chance of being together.”
With a gentle sigh, he turned on his heel and made his way back upstairs, Tony snoring gently behind him.
“Iron melts at 1500 degrees,” the man hissed in his ear, while Tony’s throat burned, “how long do you think this tin-can will last?”
The man frowned, and Tony could see him making a mental note to start nagging Clint about adding more vegetables and nutritional things to his diet. They all started to drift off in the direction of the changing rooms, Tony pulling off bits of the armour as he went. He had a special mode for training, but the suit weight stayed the same, and his bones were filled with the familiar ache that came post-mission. He really was looking forward to the lavender bath. Possibly with a supersoldier thrown in there for good measure.
Mrs. Wilson was waiting for him when he finally got let out of detention an hour after school finished.
“That’s bullshit,” he declared, snorting loudly and shaking his head. The clock in the corner of the room ticked on, quiet and yet deafeningly loud, and Steve wanted to put his fist through it to shut it up. He pulled an incredulous face and turned back to Fury. “You can’t be serious. Iron Man is… he’s a terrorist.”
They didn’t waste time. Both of them were unsteady on their feet as they exited, desperate to leave the somewhat crushing space of the workshop filled with all that horrible knowledge. Tony had never been afraid of information, but looking through those files had just felt like the potential for a fresh horror each time, and it had made him more scared than he probably should have been. He wasn’t even sure why it had all reacted so badly within him; objectively, he knew that he’d seen worse- more foul human acts, more gruesome scenes of torture. Relatively speaking, it was mild. But maybe because Peter was with them now, and he was a baby, and like Tony had said at the very beginning- he had a duty of care, it just made everything feel so much more horrific. To think of him in that horrible place… it was like a nightmare. One that Tony could only hope to God the kid would never be able to remember.
“Did you even sleep at all last night?”
Tony slammed the door, leaving Steve’s pleading behind him.
Steve didn’t respond. Couldn’t, not properly. Loki didn’t say anything after that, but Steve watched his fingers flex against the steering wheel and the car sped up a few more notches. Were they to be caught right now, the boy would most certainly be getting a hefty fine and probably a revoked license.
not moved from the spot he’d been in thirty seconds ago, “-you just broke Tony Stark. I’m not sure I’ve ever seen his brain take that long to reboot before.”
Steve stepped off Tony’s bike twenty minutes later, looking over to Sam’s house and spotting Bucky just as he pulled open the door and glared over to him.
“Okay, have you got Sleepyhead the Seal? He won’t go to bed without it.” Tony watched Steve look around the kitchen absently, one hand still laying softly atop Peter’s little head as the child sat tucked in Thor’s arms. “I gave you Sleepyhead, yeah?”
Tony eyed him, then looked to Steve with a huff. “Your friend is a freak,” he declared in a whisper that wasn’t really a whisper.
“What the hell are you waiting for, buddy?” Someone gave him a gentle shove forward, and Tony didn’t know who they were, couldn’t really say he cared much either, but they seemed to be wanting to help, so he listened to the last bit anyway. “Go after him before he runs for good!”
“Love you,” he said, a wicked grin on his face as Tony just buried his head into Steve’s shoulder and then gave him a reprimanding nip with his teeth.
Steve replayed the moment in his head. A few seconds. That was all it had been. A few seconds between life spinning on, same as ever, and the entire universe suddenly collapsing in Steve’s hands. JARVIS was saying these things, and objectively, Steve knew Tony was dead. He’d watched it. He’d put his fingers against Tony’s neck and felt nothing underneath, no pulse, no life.
one on my side—you have a hefty kick, I’ll give you that—but apart from some bruises, my statement still stands. I’ve done worse to myself in the lab on my own.”
Tony agreed.
“He needs time,” Bruce told him gently, when he watched Tony bristle in the kitchen one morning, “and so do you, Tony. You both got put through a lot. You can’t expect this to go back to normal.”
“I miss you,” he said softly, and it had been six months, but every time he came down here he still goddamn cried- he didn’t know how he was ever going to look at the concrete slab that marked his mom’s grave and not feel the grief well up so deep and profound inside him- “I miss you so much, ma.”
With a sigh, he palmed a hand across his face and then opened up his phone. He was bored and tired and lonely, and as much as the little gremlin in his brain told him to shut himself off from the world and deal with all his shit alone, the other voice- the one that sounded suspiciously like his boyfriend- was louder, and it told him to do… well, the opposite.
Tony’s horrified, blindingly betrayed face would haunt Steve for the rest of his life.
Steve’s heartbeat was its own sub-division of drug. Fast-acting, calming, an easy way to numb all the panic. And it didn’t cause him liver failure if he took too much of it, which was a nice plus.
Whatever.
“YOU AREN’T MY FUCKING MOTHER, BUCKY!”
Really, it was. They were between classes, just passing by one another. Usually they’d just grin at eachother- occasionally Tony would turn around and walk with him, just to pass the time so he could show up late to his own class.
“Don’t even finish that sentence,” Steve told him firmly, turning to Tony and shooting him his woeful eyes. “I’ll start worrying.”
Tony looked away, back to his usual spot on the wall.
the note attached to the basket had said,
“It’s Tony,” Bruce said with a sad smile “you think he’d ever let you do that for him? It’s a nice thought, but he would never take you up on it.”
He laughed, hoarse. “You. You can’t be serious, Steve. We’ve… all this time, and you want to just—just give up?” He raised his eyebrows, expecting Steve to crack a smile and laugh, agree with him, admit how fucking crazy that was. But Steve didn’t, and something horrible started to settle in Tony’s mind: understanding. “No,” he whispered, “no, Steve, sweetheart, come on—”
really?” Steve countered sulkily, keeping his arms around Tony’s waist as they swayed at the edge of the sidewalk, undoubtedly pissing off a dozen different commuters as they hurried on by. Steve couldn’t care less. “Japan will move on without you.”
And then there was a noise.
“You had no choice because you ran into that situation
Tony looked down at him, managing to hold his resolution for all of four seconds before huffing and then slumping back down onto the bed with a dramatic sigh. “You are the worst,” he declared as he shut his eyes- but when Steve laughed happily and then swooped in for another kiss, he still reciprocated anyway. Unfortunately, his will was very, very weak.
“I’m sorry, by the way,” Tony added, and he looked down at his hands at that. “For what I said. I was… it was childish and stupid. I wasn't thinking right- the morning had just gone shitty and my Dad had been on my ass and then there was
Tony laughed. His shoulders moved up and down in a shrug, and Steve watched as his hand curled around Steve’s own, tugging a little when Tony suddenly jumped to his feet and took Steve up with him. “Does it matter?” He asked with a smile, “I’m not there now. I’m with you. Hey, actually, that reminds me: you eaten breakfast yet?”
“growling and pouncing on anyone who comes near me?”
“Okay, okay, sorry,” he muttered, placing a placating kiss against the nearby skin, “but seriously—there a reason? Not that there has to be. M’just curious.”
She cocked her head over to him and mouthed ‘how you doing?’, whilst leaning back on her chair and twirling a pen in her fingers. Steve just shrugged, rolling his eyes a little. ‘Okay’, he replied.
“You are
“hey, look at it this way—” Steve turned and looked at Loki, who was still hovering at the sidelines, leaning against the counter, “he was alright enough to get here. He’s still conscious. If it were a severe concussion, he wouldn’t have been able to do that. At least he’s coherent enough to understand us. Suggests that it’s probably only a mild to moderate one.”
sound sexy-
Steve rolled his eyes. “Please, could you at least keep this vaguely private? I don’t want Sam’s house getting trampled by half the school wanting to join in or something.”
“Not long now,” Steve whispered. The air was already too hot to be comfortable, and the ground itself was beginning to form ominously large cracks as the world shook itself apart.
“I’ll want you when you’re sad. I’ll want you when you’re angry, or being an asshole, or every time when you won’t be able to tell me how you feel for me. I’ll want you. Because I have done for so long now, I’m not even sure i know how to stop.”
“You kissed him, last night,” Rhodey told him, “he rang me after he left; could barely string a coherent sentence together, he was that excited. I’ve never seen him like that before, with anyone.”
“Hey, so you know like, a week ago when I went to that stupid PR event with my dad at that weird arty museum place?” Tony asked suddenly, pulling away from Steve’s mouth and talking raspily, trying to catch his breath.
“Shut up.” Tony pursed his lips and then huffed, grabbing Steve’s hand from where it was resting on the bed. He squeezed softly, while Steve just stared at him in confusion. “I also kind of understand. When I was on that ship, I did a lot of thinking. About everything we never told each other. About how horrible it must have been to know your best friend killed your boyfriend’s parents. You were caught between a rock and a hard place, Steve, and I—I was
“I’ll pay you twenty bucks to just curl up on the floor.”
Clint nodded wisely. "I made a catapult if you want to throw food at unsuspecting kids."
Steve looked up at him, unimpressed. “Don’t get cocky,” he muttered, sizing up the wall and then taking a running leap. He didn’t have the height Tony did, but if he got the angle right-
“No you won’t,” Tony bent down and swung his legs back and forth against the wall, “look, I’ll help you; just get up to the rafter and I’ll pull you the rest of the way.”
“No, sir.”
Spinning around on his swivelly chair, he looked up at the roof of his workshop and debated going up to the communal floor for a break. He’d been looking at screens for about two days straight by that point, having cleared off a bunch of investor’s meetings and R&D discussions in order to try and further their case on AIM. He knew that Natasha and Clint were doing the same on the ground, but the trickle of information they were getting back to him just wasn’t enough. Tony needed answers. He needed solid facts. Better the devil you know than the devil who sent you a small baby and then left with no instructions on how to look after him.
Steve blinked groggily, eyes moving between Rumlow and Tony, who was now clad in all that beautiful red and gold. “Suit came fast,” he muttered, realising his words were a little slurred. A lot of blood was on the floor around him.
Lurching sideways with an uncoordinated thrust, he vomited across the rug beside the bed, hacking up nothing but bile and spit as his stomach convulsed inside his midsection. He couldn’t breathe, think, hear. It was too quiet. It felt like death. Like the end of the world.
enjoy Steve looking after him. Just a little. When things were tough at work and when all the thoughts of the day were piling up in his head, unable to find release- when he was stressed and tired and the world was just a little heavier than usual- Steve was there, offering him a hand. Giving him a kiss. Showing solidarity. And it was indulgent, but it was good, and Tony liked to let himself have it a few times a month.
“Well, I’m glad you were just making out with your boyfriend as opposed to dying horribly,” Thor said, patting Steve on the shoulder fondly and then turning to Bruce, “now we can return to our jenga game in the cafeteria!”
Steve blinked rapidly, before the light dawned. He looked back down at Peter, whose legs had now also apparently attached themselves to Steve’s arm like Velcro. He was chewing his rattle, drool curling down his chin as he smiled up at Tony.
His phone rang, and Tony nearly jumped out of his skin, splashing coffee everywhere as he jerked. The scalding liquid stung where it stained his arm, but he ignored it in favour of reaching for his phone and looking at it through tired eyes. When he saw the caller ID, he ended up dropping the coffee entirely in his haste to answer. “Steve?”
Tony feels the ever-constant desire suddenly light into an inferno at that point. Steve’s mouth looks so delicious and soft, and his eyes look even bluer than Tony had ever though they could and he just wants to… he wants to do
There. North corner of the night sky, getting steadily closer, a white-bright light that told them of Carol’s arrival. And on her shoulders, a ship. Dark, no lights, all of them gone out. She was bringing it closer, intending to land it on the grass out in front of them. Steve choked, rushing forward, hearing the rest of the group follow behind him. They should’ve brought a fucking med-kit, a stretcher,
Oh God. Steve’s stomach plummeting to his shoes. “And I left him there,” he said dumbly, head falling forward into his hand.
One: if it was severe enough that Steve had actually hit him, then Tony had quite clearly fucked up monumentally. God, Steve was close to tears. Tony had done that to him. No wonder Steve was feeling angry.
It’s… it’s what Tony had drawn up, all those months ago on scraps of paper- except this was undeniably Steve-like in style, and altogether a lot more neat than his had ever been. Pages and pages of neatly filled lines; some crossed out, some cramped additions. Doesn’t like 4th July fireworks down at the bottom or just caves in the top corner of one particular spread.
"Tony, he's not our responsibility- we can take her back and then guide her toward some of the better decisions she can make, give her more options than just dropping him at the feet of some superheroes," Steve tried, but Tony shook his head again, lip curling in distaste.
“Don’t,” Steve rolled his eyes, “there will be no leaping in front of fast-moving vehicles any time soon. Promise.”
Three days, 9 hours and 3 minutes ago, Tony had been in the kitchen making lunch while on-call with Rhodey, and Steve had come in to make himself some toast, and Tony had kissed him absently in his form of greeting and then gotten on with arguing with Rhodey over the best Star Wars film, and Steve had watched him until he’d gotten bored and stood up to wrap his arms around Tony’s waist and kiss his neck, and Tony had grinned at him and called him antisocial and then stuffed the wooden cooking spoon in his mouth and asked him to tell him if it was too spicy.
“All those dreams?” She stormed on mercilessly, “any one of them might be the scenario we chose to re-enact for you. Perhaps the first one- the morning after date night? Choking him to death whilst he stares up at you and just wonders
He took a shallow breath and then winced as it sent fire through his chest. The wall he was currently sat against offered no comfort, either, and he couldn’t even call anyone to ask for help, because the bastards had his phone.
treating me like dirt every time I do my fucking job!”
When Steve came down the next morning at 7, Tony was nowhere to be seen.
Tony was tired.
Everyone laughed, and Steve felt a consolidatory pat on the back from Sam. “Well, at least you didn’t fall asleep this time.”
God, how the fuck could Steve be so
Steve blinked, swallowing down the lump in his throat as Clint rested a hand gently against his shoulder. “I’m glad you are,” he said, making sure his voice was firm, “there’s—I was told by the doctors, straight after getting the serum, that, uh, I have higher blood pressure than normal people, so if you hit an artery, it’ll kill me faster. Don’t bother engaging in hand-to-hand. You just gotta find a way to get me while my back’s turned and—” he licked his lips and gestured to the side of his neck where his jugular lay, looking at Clint’s horrified expression and wincing. “Just in case,” he whispered with a small nod.
Steve looked at him in confusion for a few moments, before the light dawned in his eyes and his mouth dropped open in delight. “Oh!” He said again, much happier that time, “oh yeah! So does that mean we’re already married?”
“More than would be considered normal, yes,” Natasha said with an absent shrug, as she shoved her fork into the pasta, “but you get used to it. Anyway- tell me a bit about yourself, Steve. Where you from?”
No. No, none of this was okay. But Steve had to push through it. Hell, seeing as he was here, supposedly spilling his guts to Tony, he might as well—you know—
“Calm down, both of you.” Clint sat up off the floor, wiping his face and then pulling Tony’s arm hastily. “We need to get out of here. Now.”
“I don’t really mind, Tony,” he said in wry amusement, and Thor pointed upward.
He did actually look down then, hair blowing in the wind as he blinked back the sunlight from his eyes. “There was no one there for me. When she died, I mean- there was no one. I lost Jarvis with her too, and he’d been the only other person in my life who even remotely gave a damn, and it broke me. I never got fixed.” He shrugged, shoving his hands into the back pocket of his jeans and then pulling out a cigarette, jabbing it in Steve’s direction. “
“Yeah, but see, that’s the thing.” Steve leaned forward and rested on his own knees, suddenly coming no more than an inch away from Tony’s face and looking at him with a smile. “It was how I
“You’re not my mother, Steve,” he snapped angrily, “go back to bed.”
He starts writing.
With a short sigh, he bit the bullet and then dialled Tony’s number. It couldn’t hurt to ask, and if he was busy, then Sam would get home in an hour or two anyway. Steve could handle himself just fine, thank you very much.
It was easy to drift in and out of sleep- the night was late and Steve was tired, and by the looks of it, Tony was too. He lay out on top of Steve, snoring gently with his cheek pushed into Steve’s chest. He remembered what Fury had told him—never any guests, and a house like Fort Knox. Tony kept everyone at a distance, these days. Constant vigilance.
on you, just out of curiosity?” Steve asked lightly.
The next few days were hell.
Bucky nodded. “Got that right. I swear to God, running after you is costing me a fortune in gas.”
“Did you…” he said quietly, looking at the homescreen blankly and then up to Tony, who just nodded. He kept his hand around Steve’s.
But Steve couldn’t think about it right now. He couldn’t.
Steve smiled, but then pushed Tony away gently, which was not what he wanted at all. Tony went, though- pouting the entire way, mind you.
He was selfish and foolish and he just wanted everything. But he’d settle for anything- anything at all that Tony was willing to give. That wonderful, broken boy.
Steve watched Howard’s shoes come forward, stumbling a little. He could tell from voice alone that the man was off his face. On what, Steve couldn’t tell. “Was. But we finished early, then Obie was acting like a faggot and saying he wanted out of our deal so I bailed on him. He always argues like such’a little bitch when he’s drunk.” Howard clicked his teeth and Tony said nothing. Steve didn’t hear a single spring in the mattress creak. The boy was being unnaturally still.
Steve just nodded wordlessly. Judging from the lack of injuries on Tony’s body, Steve figured he must have won it.
He sunk back into the wall, suddenly unsteady. Steve was going to break up with him, for sure. Because Tony was a fucking insensitive dick and absolutely deserved it. God, he’d implied Steve wasn’t
Steve had just hit him.
Not really Tony’s area, after all.
Steve stopped as he got to Tony’s shoulder.
It was a Sunday. He wasn’t exactly going to be doing anything worthwhile today anyway. And he was tired.
Tony hummed in his ear, and Steve leaned his head back until it was rested against Tony’s chest, looking up at the cloud-scattered sky and feeling, for the first time in what may well have been years, utterly weightless. No heaviness dragging him down- no thoughts reminding him of everything he’d lost. In his palm was Tony’s hand, and in his pocket was his mother, sending him love, always.
“S’gonna keep you nice and warm,” Steve explained as he tugged Tony’s arms through the sleeves of his own oversized shirt. Tony went willingly, relief surging through him as the dampness all over him was replaced by the soft fabric of Steve’s clothes. Soon enough, Steve’s arm came back to his back and hugged him gently, a hold that would have been easy to slip out of if necessary, but firm enough to remind Tony where he was. Tony, exhausted by that point, slumped forward and buried his head into the crook of Steve’s neck. He felt shaky; the last dredges of terror still flitting around his brain like a plague that just wouldn’t leave. He still hadn’t opened his eyes.
Eventually, they ended up at the bottom of Steve’s street- Tony gradually slowing down until coming to a standstill outside Steve’s house once again. Steve couldn’t help but pout- he’d sort of wished for that to last a little longer.
Steve curled his hand around Tony’s wrist quickly, looking up at him with a raised eyebrow. “Then why’d you look so shocked by it, hm?”
He wanted Tony. He wanted Tony to make this better, to sit with him, rock him back and forth like a child in the way he only did when Steve was completely distraught, with his hands around Steve’s neck, his jaw, a soothing voice in his ear saying,
His mom had been one of his best friends. Steve had loved the month of December more than anything, mostly because of her.
"nuh uh," Tony shook his head vehemently, glancing down once more as the baby stirred a little bit, "she left him here, in the cold, out in the streets of fucking New York. She's not getting him back now."
Tony stayed in the office and didn’t take Pepper’s advice.
Steve coughed in shock, and Peggy chuckled a little as he blushed crimson. “What the- oh my
“That’s not the fucking point,” Tony hissed, hands balling into fists, “it doesn’t matter, I still flipped my shit at something ridiculous and I just – I just want to say that it won’t affect-“
The penny dropped. Tony’s eyes shifted, dragged themselves over to the corner of the room where he knew Peter’s crib lay, and where he knew Steve’s thoughts had settled. Were he anywhere else, at any other point of the day, the statement might have thrown him. Too many variables to consider, too many doubts and fears to cloud his vision.
Tony paused, and then shuffled sideways a bit, jerking his head. “Then practise,” he said with a nonchalant shrug, “Pete still needs his hair washing.”
Tony just huffed, making a small humming noise that was neither an agreement nor a refusal. Steve figured that they’d have to work on that particular one- but that was okay. He knew these things took time.
He finds it difficult to tell people he cares, and show others that he loves them. Sometimes even physical touch or people handing him things makes him uncomfortable, so the Avengers moving in proves difficult at the beginning, because… well, he just isn’t used to that much casual camaraderie and contact being thrown around. Totally new ball game. And it scares the shit out of him.
He shut off his phone and grimaced, grabbing his coat from the side of his bed and then getting to his feet quickly. Luckily Mr and Mrs Wilson had left for date night, so the house would be empty until around 10 the next morning. Well- Sam was there, but he slept like the dead anyway, and it would take an earthquake before anything woke that guy up.
And in another universe, Tony would waver. He would agree, and then he would kiss Steve’s tear-tracks and work out a way to fix this, to let them be together, the way they had been in the beginning. They would live true to their whispered promises in darkened rooms and stay with one another forever- because the only way Steve would be able to stomach eternity was when it was Tony who was taking him through it.
He wondered whether he was still unconscious, maybe. This… this wouldn’t even have happened in his wildest dreams. God, he was convinced he’d ruined things irreparably between them even before he’d gone and slept with him for information. Tony had always been too good for a guy like Steve, so when they’d split, Steve had had to live with the gutting acceptance that Tony wouldn’t ever come back. He’d have no reason to.
Tony had just left Steve to it after that. He was pretty sure he actually hindered the process a little with his distractions, but that was a fifty-fifty thing. Steve didn’t
“Yes.”
have too many zips, you’re right, but I also really like you and have done for six years, I’ve always just been too scared to tell you?” Tony shrugged sheepishly. “But there. Offer’s on the table. Hey! Kill two birds with one stone- the hospital trip can count as our date, and then if you decide that actually I’m not evil whilst we’re there, we could maybe go for a second one sometime?”
Closing his eyes and once more reveling in the silence and lack of terrifyingly familiar hisses or whines that had always haunted his birthday before, he brought Tony’s hand to his lips and kissed the knuckles there.
Thor nodded, and all of them sat back down on the couch, Steve sitting close to Tony and taking his hand, tracing lines over the back of his palm. He knew Tony liked it when he did that, and about five minutes later, Tony pulled a pen out of his pocket with a tired smile. “Can I get a doodle?” He asked.
Rocket, unlike the rest of them, had lost everyone in his family. The whole damn lot of them.
- and yet it was Tony who was the most fragile. The weakest link. And he hated that Steve knew that, now. That the whole damn team knew.
“Japanese,” he blurted, watching the way the other man frowned, “I can… Japanese. Mandarin. Spanish, French, some Swahili. I’ll learn some more. I will, I swear, don’t kick me off.”
Steve’s lifted a hand to try and block, but he was just a second too slow and his head snapped sideways with a jerk as Tony’s knuckles rapped across it, eyes going wide as if somewhat surprised. A moment later, finally giving up the fight, they rolled backward and Steve went limp under Tony’s grip with a small exhale of air.
Steve paused, head jerking up a little in curiosity. “…Am I being threatened by an artificial intelligence?”
Tony breathed in sharply, the hand not holding onto Steve’s clenching impossibly tight against his side. Steve made a soothing noise in the back of his throat and leaned forward, taking the balled up fist and trying to smooth it out before he ended up straining something. Or punching something.
“Understood,” JARVIS answered in the end, “and Sir, I... I consider you family too.”
Well. He had obviously been in a hurry to get back down to the basement, because he was holding his fucking shirt in his hands and leaving his bare midsection right on display. Steve genuinely didn't think it was purposeful- he was only wearing one sock, too, and his belt was hanging unclipped around his waist. He'd probably just been rushing.
Mr. Wilson looked at him for another second, and Steve wondered whether he really was going to have to just get out and walk.
Tony laughed again, edged with tiredness and gone too fast. Steve let the conversation die out, just concentrating on the feel of Tony’s warmth; the steady rise and fall of his chest as he breathed.
clarity.
The grounds were silent, and it was deafening. Steve shut his eyes and brushed a hand over his cheeks, swatting away the droplets gruffly. He wanted, more than anything else in the world, to just be able to hear his mom’s voice. Once more. Wanted to hear the happiness she always carried with her, even through her illness, even through her trouble. She’d never stopped sounding happy.
Tony didn’t want to think about that. It was making him feel kind of sick.
Tony smiled at him, his hands wrapping gently around either side of Steve’s neck while he leaned down to kiss him. He felt… well, he felt a lot of things. Relieved, mainly, that he hadn’t ruined all of this. Glad that Steve had confided in him. A little horny, but that was just a constant whenever Steve was around, so he couldn’t really count that.
Tony flinched like he’d been hit as it sunk in, sagging in his seat and looking so,
“Eurgh, do you two mind? We’re all still present- keep it in the bedroom, please,” Clint threw a pillow at them and they broke away, Tony searching irritably for the stupid little bastard as he rolled quickly over to the shelter of Natasha.
Bucky was just looking at him with a mixture of anger and despair. Steve wanted to punch it right off his stupid face. He wished he didn’t care so goddamned much about the bastard- it would be a hell of a let easier to actually go through with it, then.
“Tony,” Steve reached forward and took the hand that Tony was fisting into his own hair, gently prying off the fingers before he could hurt himself, “Tony, sweetheart, calm down. Just breathe. It’s okay now. It’s done. Everything is fine.”
Tony’s eyes were wide, and he knew the man was regretting everything he had just told Steve. But there was no going back now, and the waterworks were open, and damn it, why did they always do this to each other?
The adult count was down to three, and Tony Stark was starting to panic.
Regardless, whatever reason that convinced him to take the boy home, it had happened. To Steve’s pleasure, the teammates adored Peter. Bruce enjoyed playing with Peter and the boy’s Avengers figurines, allowing the boy to defeat him every time. Natasha allowed her motherly “Auntie Nat” persona to shine through, something Steve hadn’t known existed until their stay at Barton’s home. And Clint treated Pete as he would any of his kids, sneaking blueberry waffles across the table despite the Captain’s insistence that Pete had already had more than enough.
After Peter had finally gotten his shoes on, it didn’t take long until the unlikely pair hit the streets, the boy’s small hand wrapped in a death grip around Tony’s three fingers. Those big brown eyes were flitting every which way, trying to take in every sight of the busy life that was Midtown Manhattan. And Tony couldn’t blame the kid for attempting to choke the life out of his calloused fingers. To any human, the busy life of New York was overwhelming, much less for a kid whose only family remaining had been murdered by giant scary robots less than a month ago.
“You can
Silence followed his unfiltered comment, and if he listened closely enough, he swore he could hear her sigh, which she had probably tried to cover with the palm of her hand to the receiver.
“Mr. Tony,” Peter whined, dread plummeting deep in Tony’s stomach, “There’s too much butter.”
okay with this? No issues?”
It took a few seconds to recover from being caught off guard before Tony could process the question. As he thought on how to answer that, he squirted a bit of the shampoo into his hands, rubbing it together in his hands. Reaching for Peter’s head once more, and ever so gently scrubbing it in the brown locks, he answered, “I guess because it’s my name.”
When the team had first started living at Stark Tower, the citizens had gone haywire. There was an excitement in the city, everyone keeping their eyes wide open in hopes of catching one of the Avengers doing mundane, everyday things. The Whole Foods business had skyrocketed across America when Thor had been spotted eyeing the olive bar at the Whole Foods on West 24th street. The Starbucks on 7th street had never ceased to be crowded after Tony Stark and some unknown man (Bruce) were spotted buying a coffee and some green tea. And of course, the media flipped their shit when the adonis of a man, Captain America, was spotted running in Central Park at the buttcrack of dawn a few days after moving into the Tower.
“He’s not- did you kidnap a
about to get in the way of whatever is going on with that lady friend of his that he’s visiting.”
? I thought you liked buttered toast?”
No one gave them a second glance, so Tony hesitantly allowed himself to be proud of not fucking up something as simple as dressing Peter for the day.
The silence was finally broken by a long sigh, full of unhinged frustration. Tony grimaced in his luck. Berating it was.
They went to sleep that night, Tony staring straight up at the ceiling as Peter slept on his chest, breathing deeply and twitching with a dream. The word “Dad” rang through his head, bouncing around as if a happy, yet anxious animal. He falls asleep to Peter’s breathing, a smile lightly on his face.
As Clint left in his taxi, Tony felt a very small flutter of something not quite like fear in his chest. Like the first rain drop of a forecasted hurricane, or possibly akin to the feeling before going down the hill of an outrageously tall roller coaster. He had ignored it however, chalking it up to some odd sort of separation anxiety, which he didn't even question because what was one more issue on his already long list?
Steve just smiled wetly, leaning forward and pressing his lips to Tony’s forehead. “I know,” he whispered, “I know. I love you too, okay?  This… this isn’t because of that. This isn’t because I blame you, or I think it’s your fault, or anything. This is just me, trying to do what’s best for us. I need you to understand that.”
Tony laughed loudly and ran a hand through his hair, sending the boy one of the most condescending looks Steve had ever seen. As he walked forward, he caught the tail end of Tony's conversation. ‘-Reed, when you manage to bend the laws of thermodynamics to your will, please do come back to me with that, but until then there is absolutely no way-“
With Tony at his back and New York in front of him, Steve sat on the roof and watched the Sun setting over his city.
They messed about for a few more minutes in a way that only the worst kind of cringey couples could do, but Tony didn’t even care. Not one bit. He kissed Steve whenever the opportunity arose, and said ‘I love you’ about seventy times, and never even let go of him for more than a few seconds. By the time they were both ready to fall asleep, Tony was exhausted from the sheer deluge of happiness alone. He was still wearing Steve’s shirt, with Steve forsaking clothes altogether, and the two of them were facing one another, nose to nose in the bed.
“Want me to pull up his file, Stark?” Was the answer Brock gave him, his grin a mile wide and lined with teeth. “He was a plant. A trap. A honeypot. God, most of us thought it wouldn’t even have a cat’s in hell’s chance of working, because, I mean, surely the great Tony Stark isn’t
… But also, admittedly, kind of cute. Tony was going to tease Steve senseless when all this was done.
(This one has avery casual style to it,, like I wrote this on my mobile so I mean most of it was written in text-talk and had to be edited into something a bit more professional lmao apologies folks.)
“I’m gonna be so good to you, Steve,” he promised softly, nodding once and then swallowing, “I swear to you.”
Steve nodded sullenly, looking out of the window. It was true and he knew it- the social services that had taken on his case after his mom’s passing had been reluctant to let him stay with the Wilsons at all, wanting instead to put him with what they deemed ‘a more suitable family’ somewhere over in fucking
“I was sat here first.”
Not even a second later, Steve heard the door fly open. He had the good sense to roll under the bed as quietly as he could, holding his breath and feeling uncharacteristically afraid. He wasn’t sure why- Howard Stark was a pretty scary man, and he looked like he packed a punch, but he also had no idea Steve even existed at that point, so there was no need to try and stop his breath hitching. Maybe it was because of the way Tony acted around him- the fearless boy, the daredevil, the best fighter Steve knew- scared shitless of the guy Steve was in the same room with. It was a daunting thought.
It was the same old Goddamn story- almost every time a big product launch was underway for SI, a rival company would try to dig up dirt in order to put the stocks at risk. Old, boring tactics that usually just involved taking recycled material everyone had already seen before, and Tony was at least 90% certain Hammer Industries had something to do with it, because the whole damn thing stank of Justin’s creepiness.
“Kay,” he muttered, nodding, “I… yeah, alright. Cool.”
Steve was thankful for Tony every day. For keeping him sane, for holding him steady. Tony was his Godsend. He was ridiculously smart and brilliant at what he did- which, to Steve’s delight, turned out to be weapons designs. He’d equipped the whole of his team with new gear by the end of the week and fixed all their broken tech whenever Bucky sat on it or Clint dropped it. Everyone loved Tony, and if Tony was happy to run his garage by day and then create weapons for all of them at night, then so was Steve.
Tony smiled softly, nodding his head. “That sure will come in useful. Thank you, Steve.”
Five months. He’d gone five months without an episode like this. He’d thought it had…. He’d just thought it’d been getting a little better, that was all. But apparently not. His brain still went into Total Shutdown mode from the most harmless of events. Like water.
“Tony?” Steve asked, and he blinked, pulling himself out of his own head as he smiled and chucked the little sleepsuit in Steve’s direction.
He cursed quietly and sat up, running his hands through his hair. His clock read at 1:12am. It had been hours since he’d last seen Tony. Anything could have happened to him, and it’d be Steve’s fault. And he could try and say that he was a terrorist, that he’d killed innocent people, but the crux of the matter was that he just didn’t believe that any more. Somewhere along the line, his mind had changed.
Inside the observation deck, Steve stilled. He felt like even the air in his lungs stopped moving for a moment. Tony couldn’t be telling the truth, could he? SHIELD would have no reason for that. They had on-site engineers and scientists developing weapons for them, and contracts—
He watched in utter bewilderment as Tony moved forward suddenly, staring at the floor as he made his way over to the door Steve was currently stood at. However, he didn’t get far- Bucky reached out and tugged at his arm, holding him in place by the sleeve of his jacket.
“Noted, Troy,” Steve rolled on his heel and turned back around without another word. If they pushed him down the stairs right then, it wouldn’t very convenient, but he just had to hope they weren’t keen on trying to make a scene.
“What’s he got?” Natasha asked, cocking her head over to Steve. The man just shrugged, a little bewildered.
Steve just shrugged smugly and held his arms open. “Well, no one’s stopping you from staying here,” he said, although Tony raised a disbelieving eyebrow.
“I thought I told you to stay put, Rogers, not steal my jet and follow me.”
Thor’s hand clapped against his shoulder again as he nodded in agreement, and he promised he’d order Steve some food before walking off over in the direction of warmth and burgers. It left Steve alone in the half-darkness, a small smile on his face as he turned back to look over at his mom.
his brain supplied easily,
, can I?”
Steve rolled his eyes fondly, but didn’t reply. Just opened his palm a little further so that Tony could trace his patterns into the skin there.
Tony stared at him, mouth opening and closing wordlessly as the rest of the team began to jog out of the room and over to the armory. The words rung in his ears, like Steve had screamed them out to him.
Tony wanted to end it with an I love you, but he figured he didn’t really have that right. They hadn’t said it before now, and it was unlikely Tony would be able to in the future, so it most certainly wasn’t his place to do that now.
Steve felt like the universe in all its entirety was pressing down around him. It was one thing to hear it from Natasha. It was another thing entirely to hear it in Tony’s voice, on Tony’s face, looking at a projection of the man he loved while he wasted away on some sort of space-ship in the endless galaxy.
“Yeah, you do.”
, Peter's eyes drooped and he fell back to sleep. Steve was the one who pointed it out, nodding over to Peter and then fading out into a hum, which then became silence. Blissful, beautiful silence.
Steve laughed with no amusement. “Thanks. Glad to be another of Tony Stark’s mistakes.”
He launched himself forward once more. The voice was weary and faint, trembling. He was pretty sure it was Rhodey, and the man sounded injured. He couldn’t see much, but the orange flames from the tree that had somehow caught fire cast a faint shadow across the slope, and he spotted a tiny wooden cabin tucked in at the centre of it all. He moved in that direction, gun raised, calling the names of his friends once more.
“Yes,” the scientist breathed in the end, and something big and cavernous burst open in Steve’s chest at the confirmation, “you could… you’d eliminate the double-crossing of timelines. But Steve, you can’t do that. You would cease to exist—”
He’d known getting electrocuted hurt. He’d experienced it a few days ago, after all. But the pain that lanced its way through his body the moment that he made contact with the metal was like something he’d never even felt before. Like icy fire surging through his bones, ripping straight through his frame. The tightness that he’d been feeling in his heart suddenly became less of a squeeze and more like a crushing sensation, clenching down on his heart like an inescapable vice. He felt himself get flung back as every single muscle convulsed, and the air rushed over his body like an afterthought to everything going on. He vaguely felt himself hitting the floor a second or so later, the sensation secondary to the burning agony in his body. Something was crushing on his chest and the world was darkening, and he couldn’t breathe-
“Which one of you creeps is feeling my ass?” He yelled.
Then felt it like punch in the gut when Tony smiled back at them and said “Just a friend- Steve.”
Tony Tony Tony Tony, why did it always come back to him? Steve could barely go a day without something happening that involved that stupid boy.
say he was alive.
God, he’d had a whole plan. This Christmas had been supposed to be good. He’d been
Tony could be so much more.
But that didn’t matter. It didn’t matter that it hadn’t been his fault, that he survived when she died. She was still gone. She was still not coming back.
“I don’t care what you think- I certainly need
It couldn’t be true. He knew it couldn’t be true.
“I didn’t just try, I succeeded,” Steve informed him cheerily. The sun was just starting to bathe the surrounding area in a watery light, and there was still the bite of nighttime in the air. The breeze pricked his cheeks and made his eyes water, so he shut them and was back to dozing off not even a few seconds later. They’d already packed the night before, so once Steve managed to wrangle him into the passenger seat, it wasn’t all too long until they had to set off again.
something I could do about it. I could save them if I tried. But I just… don’t know how.”
“Let’s look at what we know,” Natasha began calmly, resting her hands flat against the table and eyeing them all. “48 hours ago, someone, most likely this woman, dropped Peter on our door. We don’t know why, or how she’s related to him. This morning, we find out that he’s enhanced, and also that she’s dead. A targeted hit.” She took in a breath, shutting her eyes for a moment. “So, we can infer that either this woman already knew she was being hunted, and left him with us before Peter could get caught in the crossfire, or she was hunted
“Thought she was dating Justin?” Sam asked over a mouthful of pasta, whilst Steve tried to invest all his interest in a spot of peeling paint in the corner of the room and not the fact that some girl had the hots for Tony.
“Glad though I am of your faith in sir, I must disagree. Tony’s possessions now extend only to the items he has in his car and on his person.  It may be a while before I have access to any other more sophisticated systems.”
Steve turned away and walked off, and he knew Clint was staring at his turned back in despair, and all he could think was
okay so due to the fact that I am notoriously terrible with timelines and also am British, i fucked up with the scheduling of the school holiday in America and stuff, which has resulted in steves birthday being the 12th of september. just roll with it.
No - if he was dead, it wouldn’t be an angel escorting him upward, that was for sure.
There was a pause. Then, “Sir has everything arranged in the event of his death. His will is indisputable. Ownership of the tower and all his assets will pass to Captain Rogers. The company will be left with Miss Potts.”
Somehow, looking at the excited boy as he swooped down and smacked a large kiss against Tony’s cheek, Steve doubted that. “Sure, Tony,” he said through a small laugh that was hidden by his hand- and Tony grinned back at him for a second, before ducking low and dodging another of Thor’s kisses. “No, leave me alone, you brute, I don’t want your love!”
Steve nodded, tapping his comm. “Thor? I need you on the outside, keeping them away from civvy buildings.” Tony heard Thor’s confirmation through his own comm as he approached the large metal skeleton of the SHIELD compound. He quickly switched back to Steve’s comm. “We need to find out what they want.”
Steve couldn’t really say he understood it- but he bumped his knee against Tony’s and smiled in support, and then felt it grow bigger as Tony mirrored it back at him. The others began to start their own conversations, but Steve remained with his eyes on Tony; caught in their own little world as he so often found himself. It seemed as if everything else just ended up melting away whenever Tony was in a room, until all Steve could see was him.
“Oh, I don’t doubt it.” Steve rolled his eyes. “Go to sleep, Tony.”
The new voice rang sharply in the interrogation room, and it took a second for Steve to realise that it was
Steve nipped Tony’s skin again with his teeth in chastisement and then groaned petulantly, looking up at Tony with a truly adorable pout. He harrumphed and set his chin down against Tony’s reactor, the simple glance turning into a melancholic & longing gaze as he pulled out the full power of his dumb puppy eyes.
“It was hardly a mistake,” Tony said, his voice cold and damning, “Or if it was, then it was about a hundred successive mistakes. Starting from you knocking on my door by mistake. Then moving on to you telling me you were a PI by mistake. Then telling me you still loved me, again, by
“I hate you,” he whispered to Steve as the man walked beside him, “You and your training exercises. I feel like I’m getting drowned by my own sweat in here.”
Steve just looked at him blankly, before pulling a face and punching his friend in the arm. “When the fuck did you become such a sap, Barnes?” He asked with a grin, whilst his best friend just rolled his eyes and then punched him back. “I mean, it’s all well and good for
“Yeah, well—” Tony huffed loudly and slumped into Steve’s chest. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Steady and firm and healthy. “Shut up.”
“Sometimes I just get distracted! You know I do, and I usually come back to them later, can you just relax about it-”
Steve bit his lip. Tony sounded too easy going, too nonchalant. Steve felt like he wasn’t being told something. “Please?” He asked again, “please, just tonight? To ease my own mind more than anything. I don’t… this was all my fault anyway, and I couldn’t stand the idea that-“
He kissed her forehead and then tossed a tub of icecream her way, which she plucked from the air easily. "It comes with the territory," he admitted with a shrug.
“We should probably go to class,” he said in the end, hitching up his bag and then starting to march off over to the exit.
Steve was selfish and tired enough to take it. Desperately, more than anything else in the world, Steve yearned to just touch him. Trace his fingertips across each mark on his face, kiss them better, say he was so, so,
Steve laughed gently, cheeks flushed pink as they both shuffled silently back to bed. With the care of someone handling a petri dish full of lethal bacteria, Tony delicately placed the sleeping baby back onto the couch cushions, tucking a blanket around his small body and then sitting back. He turned to Steve with an exhausted smile. "Good job," he commended, "Cap to the rescue, just like I said, see?"
