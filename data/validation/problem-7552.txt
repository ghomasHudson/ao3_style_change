Dr. Strange said. He began leading the way down the street. The two SHIELD agents shared a look before following.
. He just needed time to realize. And those stupid Avengers were distracting him.
*chants* angst, angst, angst, ANGST
Abram just trembled beneath her hand.
Steve made sure to put on his stern Papa voice.
he made sure his tone allowed for argument from Steve.
Tony finished, closing in on MODOK, dodging his blasts. He fired a small missile, knowing it would miss but definitely get his attention.
Clint just shook his head, smiling knowingly.
Fury stood, effectively silencing the room.
he shouted over his shoulder. It was that time of year again. The Avengers all knew by now that seeing Tony at all was a rare occurrence in October. The man practically worked non-stop for a month straight.
he asked, cleaning the dirt out from under his nails, bored.
Steve placed the tablet on the bedside table and looked around the room. At some point Pepper and Rhodey had shown up while Steve was engrossed in the conversation with JARVIS. Julie knocked and walked in again, introducing herself before washing her hands. Clint watched her with sharp eyes, Natasha watched in that way that looked like she wasn’t, and Thor visibly made himself more menacing with his stance. When Julie turned around from the sink she balked.
Clint held his hands up in surrender.
He rasped. He could feel the palpitations starting, and he clutched at his chest unconsciously. Tony felt like he was spinning, but Steve must’ve been carrying him, because he was suddenly looking up at the robotic arm that could replace the wiring. JARVIS monitors had activated, because they were a steady stream of loud beeping in his ear.
he started.
Strange looked at the ground in… shame?
Matt was bouncing his leg up and down anxiously.
she started, voice sharp. She cleared her throat, softening her tone.
Clint looked down at the flyer Phil had handed him.
Steve watched Tony stir, slowly coming to. When he opened his eyes he looked at Steve and winced.
Tony was ready. It hadn’t been part of the plan to have a heart to heart that day, but it definitely worked in his favor. Clint’s guard was down more than usual. He seemed slightly less hypervigilant than usual around Tony, and it had to be a subconscious trust thing. Granted, slightly less hypervigilant from the great Hawkeye still meant very hypervigilant, but this was Tony’s best chance for revenge. Tony was going to break Clint’s winning streak in their scream contest this year if it killed him. Well, not literally. Probably.
When they came back the next day, Bruce promised he’d bring Tony’s tablet so he could work, despite Steve’s protests. He needed to look at some possible alterations to the arc reactor that might fix his newest problem. Maybe JARVIS could help him come up with a whole new mechanical organ. He could just replace his stupid, problem-causing heart.
she whispered.
She did jump this time, when Thor pulled her in for a hug.
he trailed off. Steve knew what he meant anyway. Someone was going to get killed if this kept up. All it took was the right slip up in the field, and the team could be dropping like flies.
Steve asked. He focused on not hyperventilating. Steve knew he should have kept Tony home.
Tony turned to Steve.
Do I make everything somehow at least slightly angsty for Tony? Yes, yes I do.
‘Sorry,’ Tony formed the word with his lips. Bruce could almost pretend he could hear a voice to accompany the movement, and it made him feel a little better. Tony smiled when some of the clear tension left his friend’s shoulders. Maybe Bruce was more comfortable lip-reading than signing. ‘Want to join me in the lab? I’ll show you my prototype comms.’
Tony had tried to warn Hawkeye, he saw the opening Clint had left but his shouted warning was too late. He scanned the battlefield, and Tony was the closest to his fallen friend. He landed beside Clint fighting off three bots that were closing in. Iron Man knelt down, pulling Clint’s shaky hands away from the wound to inspect it. He couldn’t do much with enemies still everywhere, so he scooped the man up and took off for the nearest empty rooftop. The man was already too pale.
They heard the girl in the kitchen greeting a newcomer, and this one must be a friend because the girl kept talking a mile a minute as she led him into the dining room.
but Tony stopped him with a finger in a ‘wait a minute’ gesture.
Steve got another email, and the sudden panic that gripped him made him not want to open it.
The office was cold. The armchair beneath him was lumpy. The questions were kept simple, thankfully; Frank wasn’t sure he could have processed anything more. His one word answers came across more like grunts than words, but Officer Storm took it all in stride. Maybe this wasn’t her first rodeo. If a man losing his whole family could be called a rodeo. Frank shuddered, a sob ripping through the numbness and thrusting him back into reality. They were
he looked like he wanted to say so much more.
He jumped up and threw on some sweatpants. If Tony was asking for him and not Steve, this couldn’t be good.
Strange actually looked apologetic.
He pointed towards the door.
Natasha said.
He shrugged.
, Tony thought to himself.
he said sarcastically. There was no malice behind it, and he placed a kiss on Steve’s nose to make it obvious.
Steve thought JARVIS sounded anxious and angry. The stirrings of anger were beginning in the back of Steve’s mind, but they were easily drowned out by panic. Tony was still breathing and his pulse was fast and uneven.
Tony shot back.
the AI answered drily.
JARVIS dutifully replied.
Tony stopping behind her automatically gave control back to his own legs, which he definitely should have thought about because he immediately started to crumple, stumbling forward and catching himself on a tree before he could fall. Unfortunately, he caught himself with his left arm, which made the pain lance up his side.
He left the lab before Tony could say more. Pepper and the Avengers’ PR agent had set up the interview on
Dr. Strange shook his head, making a pained expression.
Loki said. No one responded, and he knew when he was even less welcome than usual.
Just as he said it, Butterfingers rolled away carrying the rest of the beer.
Steve said. He was still shivering.
He kissed Tony on the forehead and when Tony looked into his eyes the mask slipped a little, something was causing Steve pain, which was the last thing Tony expected. Worry, anger, disappointment; all of those made sense to Tony. Pain seemed random.
Everyone shrugged. Normally JARVIS would’ve answered, but Tony had probably forbidden him from using text to speak to them. Speak of the devil, Tony entered the room ignoring all of them. He went straight to the coffee pot, drained it, then started another. While it was brewing, he turned to face the abnormally crowded kitchen.
Steve sat forward on Tony’s other side, catching Tony’s attention.
Steve kept cooking.
Tony’s voice was scratchy. He wondered how long he’d been asleep here.
He finished his coffee and set it on the counter a little too hard.
Tony said flatly.
Steve and Strange looked at each other. Strange took a deep breath, and looked nervous.
Fury looked at him blankly. He couldn't read Fury for the most part. He had been working for the man for years and he still couldn't read those damn facial expressions.
The problem was that lately she had been opening up. It was easy to control oneself when you remained mostly isolated and only showed your surface emotions. Other than with Pietro, Wanda had successfully remained emotionally distant from the world for the last several years. That was until Vision. He had wormed his way into her heart when she wasn’t looking, and now she felt volatile. She had never known love like this, and with it her walls came crumbling down all together. Suddenly she was an open book around all of the Avengers, laughing and crying with the smallest provocation. Vision had convinced her to let down her guard a little, that she could feel without destroying, but she had no practice with happy mediums.
Anyway, this is classic spooky vampire castle shit, so get in the horror-Halloween spirit!
That broke Steve and his face crumpled.
he started, all dry humour and sarcasm.
Steve squeezed him in a tight hug.
Bruce was starting to really believe Tony had lost it. He looked down to do as he was asked but, he couldn’t.
Tony asked. That was the last thing he had expected.
he whispered before drifting off to his dreams.
So Wanda had tried to ignore the headache, which did feel somewhat better after a nap. The tower had been too much, though. There were loud noises everywhere, and strobe lights in some rooms, and fog machines blasting. With no Vision there to calm her down when things felt like too much, it had been a perfect storm to her raw nerves. Wanda flopped onto her bed with a loud sigh. She hoped they’d all forgive her later. She closed her eyes, and drifted off to sweet, sweet silence. Tomorrow she’d apologize.
The villain laughed darkly, gesturing with his right hand at the pile of suit parts. The red ring on his ring finger shot out a beam and Tony watched in horror as his suit just disintegrated. There went any chance at an escape plan. “What do I want from you? I want you to suffer.” He spat the last word and lifted his left hand with a thrust, the white ring on his thumb shining bright. Tony lifted off the ground as though someone had thrown him, but halted midair as the Mandarin swiped his hand towards the wall, where Tony was flung hard into a wall. He heard a suspicious crunch that was probably a few more of his unbroken ribs, the pain a sharp stabbing in his side even after the impact confirmed the suspicion.
Steve gave Clint a look.
Tony Stark had foiled Morgan le Fay for the last time. First it had been back with Merlin and Doctor Doom and the whole Excalibur nonsense (
Fury had inspired the idea, and he normally would never suspect the supernatural, but he had exhausted any scientific explanations for just how shit things had gotten. His family was behaving out of character and shooting each other, highly improbable accidents were happening all the time, there had to be a cause. With that in mind he had JARVIS pull up a log of every injury or mistake in the last few months and a log of each individual Avenger’s activities including purchases, enemies fought, items touched, anything. It was a lot of data but Tony was confident he could figure out a pattern.
She nodded, taking note on her clipboard.
Also, come check out my tumblr
He took a shaky breath.
Bruce asked Steve.
Steve thought he had been prepared as he approached the woman, but when her hood and masked pulled back to reveal Natasha, he realized he hadn’t been. She was gasping in pain, and he could see the newly forming fangs from where he stood in front of her.
Clint snorted, and Natasha smacked him.
he explained, tapping his fingertips on the reactor.
he managed, but his voice cracked. He turned away and walked more quickly towards the others. He was done with this conversation for now.
She turned and glared at Tony,
Steve chuckled warmly. That was a good sign, right?
Clint teased as they all filed out, probably headed for the cafeteria.
The three SHIELD agents could tell from Tony’s glances that he was embarrassed to have anyone but Steve see him like this, so they motioned for Thor to follow and left. Tony let out a moan as soon as they were gone, grateful for the privacy to vocalize the pain. He’d rather Steve didn’t have to see this, either, but he also needed Steve for his sanity. Strange disappeared in a sudden implosion of the air around the space he had been occupying, and Wanda was the only one who didn’t jump at the large CRACK.
That was just completely unfair. Clint liked old things to decorate his room. Lots of people liked antiques. Granted, he did pick the stranger looking objects typically, but only because it reminded him of his carnie days in a good way.
Tony huffed out a laugh then winced.
Tony decided maybe more questions would distract him, although he was sure it would be prolonging the inevitable.
Strange looked at him like he was trying to read him and Clint resented that.
Tony sighed heavily, Steve was right, plus he didn’t need more disappointment from Steve right now.
He glared at Clint with bloodshot eyes.
Tony pulled on his sweatpants fairly easily. But when he went to raise his arms to slip on the t-shirt, his ribs and clavicle argued and he cried out, dropping the shirt. Steve caught the shirt and pulled Tony into a gentle hug in one swift move. He gently brought Tony’s arms into the shirt and pulled it over his head, thankfully not saying ‘I told you so.’
Tony snorted loudly.
Tony made a noise somewhere between a laugh and a sob.
Natasha and Bruce walked over to talk to Dr. Strange, conveniently leaving the two to quarrel in peace. Thor had already moved to stand off at the sideline, looking like his mind was very far away. Phil moved forward, an awkwardly jerky motion as he tried not to lunge into a hug, but still wanting the physical contact desperately. He wasn't one for public affection, at least when SHIELD agents who were under him could see, as it undermined his
Turns out the 26th floor is one of the Stark industries conference room floors. There were no meetings scheduled today, so he luckily would not have to worry about explaining his odd attire and appearance to any employees or stock-holders. Tony used to remember where everything in the tower was, but 62 floors took up a lot of space in his mind. Since the Avengers only really used the top 10 and he knew the bottom 3, there was a lot in between that he just didn’t bother with. He might remember Pepper mentioning that there were some cafeteria floors and some display floors for his cars, but who knows. Originally the idea had been to rent out space to businesses, but, once the whole Tony is Iron Man secret was out, no sane business owner really wanted to conduct business in a tall supervillain target.
Tony ground his teeth and closed the file he was working out.
he explained.
When she looked at everyone’s pained expressions she sighed.
Tony had been predictably correct. The next morning, every news station across TV and radio was talking about Captain America’s engagement to Iron Man. Steve decided his morning run was not worth it when he saw the crowd waiting right outside the tower. He decided to ignore Tony’s ‘I told you so’ smug face when he returned from the lobby and headed to the gym to use the treadmill. Tony was still in the kitchen watching another news channel an hour later.
Peter giggled as he nodded in excitement.
Steve closed the message, not wanting to deal with that train of thought until Tony was asleep again.
So this is my first muti-chapter fic on ao3, I don't know if I've mentioned that. The whole fic is already written, but doing formatting things is take AGES. So they'll be posted as I finish them, no promises on dates.
he murmured.
It would be too suspicious if Coulson heard JARVIS asking Clint to go to the lab.
she motioned. They obeyed, laughing.
Clint watched the glass shattered, and noticed what was happening immediately. Waving his hands around wildly until everyone was looking at him, he addressed the room. ROOM SILENT, CORRECT? He signed, mouthing ‘Am I right in assuming you all hear silence?’ Clint had opted out of his hearing aids for the day, so he hadn’t noticed the unnatural quiet. When everyone looked so concerned and lacked a reaction to the shattered glass, he thought about Wanda’s shout. She must’ve mistakenly cast a spell on everyone there. Chaos magic had been known to do stranger. When everyone nodded in response he continued. W-A-N-D-A CAST SPELL US ACCIDENT, he gestured from the elevator to the group of people. ‘Wanda cast a spell on us. Presumably, by accident.’
Steve was flushed with anger and it was adorable. He got that pink hue so easily.
I tried to capture a glimpse of the overall weirdness of being stuck in the hospital, both as the patient or the visitor. I've been both, as well as staff, and hospitals really feel like another universe sometimes. This one was going to be all fluffy and nice, but it's me, so it turned into a bit of a continuation to hurting Tony.   ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ It's still mostly just avengers being a family for each other, I swear.
he tried again, gentler this time.
he glanced at Natasha.
he sounded far too gleeful.
Tony leaned back in his swivel chair, mockingly considering the AI’s words.
the medic commanded.
Turns out Tony should’ve been worried about himself instead of the man. As soon as Tony’s hand touched his shoulder to wake him, the stranger sat up, wide-eyed, gripping the armour’s wrist with enough strength to dent it. The alarms in the suit were immediate.
Steve was done with this conversation. Tony’s attitude was spoiling his good mood.
Bruce said. Damn, they noticed.
The camera took dozens of pictures rapidly, zooming in on various parts of Tony and different monitors. Steve watched in awe, seeing JARVIS’ meticulous cataloging of everything Tony-related in action for the first time.
Tony let the armor fold back into the suitcase so he could investigate his own damage. The dizziness was getting worse, so he plopped down completely, butt hitting the ground painfully.
...What was the point of having his amazing car collection if he didn’t get to drive them? A night alone on empty highways was peaceful.
his voice was shaky.
After they had left, Clint let Phil rub his shoulders for another minute or so before shrugging him off.
Steve pushed off the wall, heading towards his room.
the medium continued.
Thor boomed, holding out a mug towards Steve in the manner of giving a toast. Steve smiled tiredly at him. Sometimes, Thor liked to deliberately be over the top with his language, and they all knew it. He could blend in just fine when he wanted, but the shakespearean vibe was part of his charm.
YOU WANT PLAY FIGHT? Steve asked Natasha. He didn’t know if there was a sign for sparring, but he mouthed the words ‘Do you want to spar today?’ He was determined to try out as many of their usual activities as possible while trapped in the silence.
Bruce’s lips were pressed together in a thin line. The bursts of air coming from his nostrils were audible, and a bead of sweat had formed on his temple. Tony felt his own heart rate pick up. If Bruce transformed in here, anything of value would be destroyed.
Phil said,
Tony absolutely beamed at him. It had been a very long and difficult project, trying to figure out some of Steve’s interests. The man was so easygoing and not picky sometimes that it was impossible to tell what he actually liked and what he just didn’t mind. Tony wished Steve was a little more outspoken, but he also appreciated the little mysteries he had to work to solve about Steve. It kept the man interesting. His next project was trying to figure out the supersoldier’s favourite painters and art styles for a wedding portrait, but that was still a secret.
Tony tried to keep his voice calm. Morgana enjoyed fear, especially from men. She was more likely to release him if he could appeal to logic.
Tony gaped at them, confused. He shook his head.
Bruce asked from the corner.
Jessica woke up in the dark. She tried to sit up and promptly hit her head. She looked around in the pitch black, feeling the small box she was in.
Tony clenched his unbroken hand into a fist as his face darkened.
Peter tried to make his voice deep. Tony’s grin was so wide it hurt. They were all laughing silently, watching the scene unfold. Peter was so cute it was hard to remember the subject matter.
he added wryly.
Tony moved an arm upward to rub circles into Steve’s back.
One corner of the room was much darker than the rest. All the ceiling lights near were burnt out, and the reactor’s aura was the only thing shining into the darkness. Tony held one gauntlet up, repulsor at the ready. That was when the smell hit him.
That was the crux of it all, wasn’t it? Steve wanted the world to know how important Tony was to him, but Tony kept blocking his attempts to talk about their relationship to the press. Everytime a question about his love life came up, he would open his mouth to answer only for Tony to divert their attention with one of his latest scandals. Reporters would shout loudly over each other for a chance to get the great Tony Stark’s comment on something controversial, and Steve’s responses would be dead on his lips. Tonight was going to be the end of it. Steve had made sure of his plan. It didn’t matter this time how much Tony tried to talk him out of it. The world would know about his feelings and his sexual orientation.
Clint flew the Avenjet while the rest of them rode in tense silence. The Avengers were not used to feeling so powerless. Tony held a bowl in his lap, and he had a sickly grey tint to him. Every so often they could hear him hiss in pain, but he was staying abnormally quiet overall.
Steve tilted his head patiently.
stupid.
Clint burst into a fit of giggles at his own joke, which no one else thought was that funny. Phil rolled his eyes.
Tony forgot his own very valid fears when the words hit him. Steve wanted to marry him! How many times had he dreamed about this very moment? The fact that they were on live television faded away and Tony needed to keep breathing. Steve’s face was so hopeful and nervous, and that made Tony want to burst out laughing. Did the man honestly think Tony could ever say no to him? He cleared his throat.
Peter shook his head and his face was red now. The tears finally began streaking down his cheeks. He knew Wade was never scared, and he wanted to be brave like him but he just wasn’t, okay? New York was huge and full of scary people who did horrible things. He would know, his parents had to fight the scary people all the time.
he said behind him.
She laughed ruefully.
Steve nodded.
JARVIS asked. Natasha scooted away without a word. Everyone looked at each other awkwardly before starting conversation back up, talking about ways to keep Tony away from his suits while he recovered. Steve tuned them out and looked at the tablet.
Tony and Clint have a yearly competition in October to see who can get the other to scream first. They called their schemes pranks, but Steve thought they bordered on cruel torture sometimes. If only the two would put this much energy into plans against enemies. Sure, Tony was a sore loser after losing the last three years, but it was really Clint's fault for being such a sore winner, okay? Tony was out for blood this year. Revenge for his losing streak would be oh so sweet.
Clint didn't really want to say it out loud. He felt stupid. The others seemed like they had dealt with some real shit and here he had been in a fucking cloud of darkness he could have stepped out of. He sighed.
I'm sorry Tony, I just love hurting you. I threw in some Tiberius because he's one of my favourite Tony enemies. The whole close friend gone sour deal is just a good trope. Warning for being bound and feelings of hopelessness.
Phil raised an eyebrow,
The pain ripped through him as something made contact with his side. Tony’s movements were outside of his control, his muscles twitching painfully before the current ceased. The haze of pain left him confused as to where he was for a moment.
he called behind him, blasé.
They cried together in silence until they could produce no more tears. Bruce’s exhaustion eventually got the better of him and he fell into an uneasy sleep, upright in the visitors’ chair. Steve spent the night watching Tony breathe. His chest moved up and down at a constant pace because of the machine. Up and down, up and down. Steve found himself lost in memories of Tony laughing and good dates they’ve had when Julie came in to check on him. He was grateful that she didn’t try to make small talk, she just quietly went about her job and left. The intrusion had broken his reverie though.
The process was the same, and yes, her hair definitely defied gravity, it was cool. She didn't show any emotion though and Strange didn't say anything, he just looked vaguely uncomfortable.
Tony taunted,
the title was said with so much venom.
his voice was amplified and deeper, to match the strength of Morgana’s.
Clint bit his lip.
the slightest gasp from Steve made Clint pause, Steve was no expert at hiding emotions like a SHIELD agent.
He shifted into a more comfortable decision.
But no. One of the solid, comforting facts of Dracula’s existence had been shattered by Tony Stark and the Avengers. Captain America’s blood was still the primary goal, but he needed the genius dead. It had taken him longer than it should have to realize the real danger of Stark’s discovery. The mortal could potentially ‘cure’ all of his kind, returning them to the weak state of humans. While maybe once upon a time, in the early days of being immortal, Dracula would have welcomed the opportunity to be rid of what he thought was an evil curse, centuries later, he knew better.
He responded fondly.
Tony rolled his eyes.
she challenged.
It had been nearly a decade since the last time he used the doll. His life was comfortable, he didn’t need to. The money was running out, though, and in retrospect he maybe should’ve invested some of it, but now it was too late. He could pull out the old costume and doll for one last mission, then he would invest it properly this time and swear off hurting people for good. The only logical target was the richest man in the world, of course. Tony Stark.
He turned as they continued walking and scanning for a good spot to set up camp.
she explained gently.
Your friends explained what cannibalism is. I resent your calling me a cannibal, she said matter-of-factly.
Phil stood alone in the room, letting the day wash over him. He understood what Clint was going through, how terrified he was of losing any of the Avengers, though he’d never admit it. Clint’s real family had never really been there for him, and the first couple months at the tower, Clint closed himself off to avoid getting close to anyone. These people were the only people who have ever cared for him; watched his back; could be trusted. He knew that Clint was furious at the fact that he couldn’t help right this very instance, so he had to get some of that frustration out. He’d be alright when he came home to collapse next to Phil tonight.
Tony didn’t even notice Thor, too busy sprinting to his boyfriend’s side. Thor waited patiently off to the side, until Tony was on his knees trying to wake Steve. Natasha and Clint were too far away to stop the god.
Nobody really liked it when Steve’s voice deadened like that, but they understood the necessity. They could all hear the change after this much time on a team with him. Dr. Strange cleared his throat.
Bruce shook his head,
Clint feigned obliviousness, still pondering the choices.
The hunched green man, who up close looked even more like a zombie more than a man, turned to snarl at her.
Krupp’s gravelly voice rang out as he apparently told Mr. Marcus a story. Jessica recognized the name Prospero, but wasn’t sure where from.
JARVIS answered before Tony could speak.
Tony woke slowly. He didn’t want to open his eyes. The soft pillows and warmth of his blanket were so enticing. A smile played at his lips as he reached over, eyes still closed, to feel for Steve.
Tony pried his eyelids open, heart monitor beeping beside him. He had never felt this weak in his life, and his chest ached. Little snippets of what had happened came to him slowly, and not in order. Steve just watched the man figure out everything, expressions of confusion, fear, anger, realization, flitting across his face clearly. When he finally turned his head to look at the blond, he seemed pretty lucid. He was so thankful that Steve looked fine and not like a vampire.
She looked sternly at each of them.
(See the end of the chapter for
The words were met with stunned silence.
he commented casually. Tony still felt the cold ache originating from his center, and he couldn’t resist squirming. He almost wished for the sharp pain of an open wound instead.
Steve cleared his throat.
The email would’ve slipped through the cracks if Tony hadn’t told JARVIS to monitor for every single phrase that could possibly be construed as a threat. The email address that sent it was a meaningless string of characters, and the subject was an inconspicuous
He reached the door, throwing it open before Hulk hit him from behind. The doorway was definitely weaker than the other parts of the wall, because Hulk crashed through it behind Tony slamming into the building across the street. The suit crashed through glass, and Tony squealed to a halt on the linoleum floor of what appeared to be a children’s clothing store. He silently thanked the universe that it was nighttime, so no one had been in harm’s way. Standing with a wince, he began the march outside towards the Other Guy. Hopefully the others got here soon, because Hulk was clearly furious, and the armour had never had to stand up to a truly antagonistic Hulk, only an irritated one. Bruce had told him once that the Hulk’s strength was correlated to his anger levels.
They stood there for a few moments, just inhaling each other.
There's some moments that could have been smutty, and allude to sex, but I didn't write any here. There just isn't time for it in these short chappys when I'm writing a new one every day.
noises. Everyone watched silently, fidgeting, except for Clint and Natasha of course. They don’t fidget.
He bit his lip with worry.
Tony flew over the remaining distance, dodging the few minions who took to the air or jumped at him. 30%.
He closed the door behind him with his foot, and the sound alerted Steve to his presence.
he added before leaving without any further explanation.
Tony felt his mouth snap shut, hit teeth clicking together. He looked at Peter, then at Steve, and back again.
Tony looked at him petulantly for a moment, contemplating continuing his list of ways to sabotage Loki anyway. Steve just raised an eyebrow at the man, knowing what he was probably thinking. Tony huffed, giving up.
Tony finally managed. When no further explanation came, Clint pressed it.
was all he managed.
Steve whispered. He ran his fingers through Tony’s sweaty hair where his head lay in Steve’s lap.
They were two weeks into Tony’s experiment, and things were going fantastically. Tony hadn’t slept a wink since the first injection and he felt better than he’d felt in years. In fact, the team was starting to get suspicious, especially Steve.
She lowered the clipboard.
It took a moment for Tony to realize he was falling, which was alarming in and of itself. The pain of his burned skin scraping against the wall as he started sliding downwards would've made him scream if he had the breath in him. He was free falling now and it felt like forever and instantaneous somehow, and when Tony slammed into the hard ground it was his right side that he landed on, and it felt like his rib cage just shattered.
‘Like this,’ he mouthed, placing the familiar part of the comm in his ear as usual. Steve could see where the extension went now, and followed Tony’s lead. The comm had an arm that ran around the ear and stopped at the temple, where it was attached to a little white rectangle piece that hung in front of the eyebrow. Tony turned away so Steve was facing the comm unit in his friend’s ear, before making an exaggerated movement to press a small button on the temple. A small screen appeared in front of Tony’s eye, and it reminded Steve vaguely of google glasses.
He sighed.
Something was very wrong. The girl had no sclera or iris, just purely black orbs for eyes. It was disconcerting on its own, but Tony had met stranger kids who often ended up with Xavier and the X-Men. No, the eyes alone were not the issue. She stared at him blankly, and his fear response was illogical.
JARVIS informed him.
Tony shouted again, stepping away from the crates and slowly continuing his circle around the main reactor.
he asked instead.
Strange shook his head and chuckled.
Steve stared at the genius in shocked horror. What was he talking about? He caught Tony when his eyes rolled backward and he crumpled suddenly.
Steve stood to shake her hand.
He had to believe that. Mr. Doll still wanted the money, right? He wouldn’t get it if he killed Tony.
Before the bastard left him, Tony felt a prick of a needle in his arm, and something injected into his system. Tony was alone. He could see the handle of whatever was sticking out of him if he lifted his head, but he was too tired to inspect it further. Whatever Osborn had injected felt like a vague acid-burn spreading through his veins. He took deep, shaking breaths, trying to ignore the terrible sensation, but by the time it reached his heart, he was sobbing. He was no longer Tony Stark; he was merely a pulsing mesh of different pain sensations. Nothing was worth this pain.
And that right there was Agent’s
she let out a light laugh, as if this were everyday for her.
Tony lifted his faceplate.
Loki replied snidely. She shot him a scathing look, but softened her expression when she saw his own. He actually looked vaguely apologetic.
Steve whapped the side of his head.
Tony’s eyes fluttered open at Steve’s panic, he caught Steve’s wrist, noticing the tubes in his hand.
When he made it to the top, he craned his neck, trying to see as far as possible in all directions. The position was awkward because he had to hold onto a branch with one hand for balance, unable to just stand up straight on a branch. There were woods in every direction into the horizon. He could make our the winding opening in the canopy of leaves that must be a river. They could follow the river and hope for the best. There was usually civilization near rivers. He wondered what country they might be in. Not a lot of places were left in the world with forests this large.
The castle reminded Steve of Dracula’s, all cold and dimly lit. Not that there were any sources of light around, but physics didn’t seem to apply here anyway. Natasha and Steve easily took out the patrol gargoyles they happened upon in the hallway, so they hoped Nightmare still didn’t know they were here.
It sounded more tired than harsh.
This was definitely the worst headache Tony had ever experienced. He couldn’t think straight. He tried to lick his cracked lips, but it was useless. He had no more saliva. There was no way he could be sure that the crash he heard outside the door was real. He angled his head to look at the door. Holding his head up was too much work. The door swung open, or he hallucinated the door swinging open, and the hopefully real Steve was back-lit. He looked like an angel.
Once everyone had cocoa in their hands and was settled into the couches, Clint jumped up.
I know, it's very late. I'm so sorry. Life got busier because I just started a new job at a comic book shop.
When Tony came to, it was after eighteen hours straight sleeping. He could breathe and move again, was no longer dying, but his body was so sore. He shifted with a groan, shakily sitting up a little in the hospital bed. When he forced his heavy eyelids open, Steve was right there to greet him.
He pulled the reactor out, making the decision for her. The addition of the familiar shrapnel in the heart pain was too much. He gasped with a whining noise. The arc reactor fell to the floor as his vision went black.
The trust that had taken them so long to rebuild after Civil War was shattered again. Steve couldn’t even meet Tony’s gaze anymore, and being around any of Tony’s friends made him want to curl up and die. There were so many secrets and lies between them all for the Illuminati, and it wasn’t worth it. Following their plans to destroy other worlds… What had he been thinking? Tony never learned or grew wiser, his mistakes just did more and more damage. He regretted who he was to the core.
he said softly.
It wasn’t really as if Steve could sleep while Tony was being held captive, and who could blame him? He knew he’d be better off if he did, seeing as it was going on 48 waking hours now, and even super-soldiers needed sleep, but he just couldn’t. Every time he closed his eyes he saw Tony falling, the arc reactor dark. If he kept his eyes closed for too long he started imagining the torture that the Mandarin might be doing to Tony. He silently cursed his imagination and his own experiences with torture for fueling it.
Strange spoke up. Clint nearly jumped out of his skin at the volume. Strange broke the circle of hands, and was looking at Meryll sharply. They seemed to share a silent conversation through looks alone, before she inclined her head, conceding.
The two men shared a silent conversation of facial expressions. Tony must’ve gotten the response he wanted because he let out a whoop.
Steve sighed while he watched Tony put his clothes back on.
Steve agreed.
Tony made a shooing motion, already bored with this. The vague threats with no name were always so boring, plus they never ended up getting past security. He pulled out his tablet and the newest specs for Natasha’s stinger upgrades were up, so he started working on those.
Tony reached the cave opening first, peering inside. It was too dark to see much, so he cupped his hands to his mouth.
There was no more Tony Stark. He was sadness, grief, regret, angst, emotional anguish incarnate. Far away, in another time, his knees hurt and his cheeks were wet with warm, sticky tears. Every painful memory of his regrets flashed before his eyes and they each felt like another sword through his center. The pain was unbearable, and he wished he’d just die already.
Phil studied his boyfriend’s face.
Clearly Norman had a hiding place that not even JARVIS knew about because if the stiffness in Tony’s muscles was anything to judge by, he had been unconscious for several hours.
The isolation with no view of the sun made it impossible to tell how long it had been since Ty had left. He wondered idly if the man was even still in the building, or if he’d just went home, confident in his own success. Tony kept nodding off for unknown lengths of time, which added to his disorientation. It was deeply worrying that he hadn’t urinated in a long time.
The relief Steve felt was dizzying.
Tony heard the Mandarin approach before he turned to see him. He didn’t have time to move before the foot connected with his side, sending him sprawling onto his stomach. The blood that welled up came too easily, he had to spit it out to keep from drowning. There’s no way he was in good shape internally. Tony wasn’t so sure he’d make it out of this alive by the time his friends came to the rescue. The Mandarin laughed.
Tony felt tears streaming down his face but couldn’t grasp where he was. His head hurt so much, and his mind seemed to be in a fog. He tried to chase a thought down, something about not saying something, when he went back under.
he was so earnest, Tony could not be blamed for laughing. Steve only blushed deeper.
Alexi stepped out from behind the Mandarin, and Natasha didn’t even blink. How many times would her husband’s face be used against her? She knew what had to be done and she’d do it again and again; she didn’t know why they thought this would do anything to weaken her. She took him down at the knees and was ready to snap his neck when he spoke.
Tony said aloud.
Steve’s voice brought Tony’s head around. The blond was sitting in the uncomfortable chair beside his bed. He looked exhausted, though Tony was sure he probably didn’t look much better.
Slowly being bled to death was not one of the ways Tony wanted to go out. Maybe an explosion, or some kind of disintegration ray, something cool, but not bleeding out. It sounded terrifying; there was far too much time to contemplate the coming death.
Tony stepped up behind him, hands fluttering around, not knowing what to do. He decided on rubbing circles in Steve’s back as he dry heaved a couple of times. Wiping his mouth with some toilet paper, he stood up and grabbed his toothbrush out of the shower.
Steve asked nervously. Tony realized he hadn't actually answered yet because he'd been too busy planning.
Natasha slurred slightly, leaning seductively on the counter, eyeing him up and down.
Tony whined, squirming under his touch. Tony managed to grab a hold of the back of Steve’s neck, tugging him up to kiss him roughly. As Tony bit down lightly on Steve’s lower lip, Tony undid Steve’s belt then shoved off the clothes with his feet. He was not having any more of this delay.
he tapped on the arc reactor,
he began his usual rambling.
he managed.
he admitted happily. JARVIS lowered the lights again, and the two men held each other until they fell asleep.
he hated Octobers.
His shit-eating grin was begging for a smack. Peter giggled gleefully, enjoying their little collaboration.
When she returned, she was being followed by a slightly darker skinned girl in a gold head wrap. Given how tight it was to the head and that there was no hair poking out underneath, Clint guessed she was probably bald or had a mohawk. In his periphery, Strange reacted to her visibly, though subtle enough that most lay people probably wouldn’t notice. It was just a slight tensing of his shoulders, something that would’ve been hidden if the man were wearing his cloak, and Clint wondered if it was a tell Strange had all the time. Maybe he could come play poker at the tower sometime.
The stranger looked at him curiously, but unfortunately showed no recognition of what Tony had said. There went the hope of the man knowing English. It was clear, now, that the man was not Terran. He resembled Terrans well enough to be mistaken for one, but with his eyes open, Tony could tell better that the skull shape was slightly different. The eyes were further up away from the mouth, the mouth was wider, the cheek bones were more steeply tilted, and it moved it’s head in a jilted manner that was very alien. The stranger reached out towards Tony.
Steve looked ashamed at that memory,
Steve’s face swam above him.
Peter groaned.
Tony’s voice was strained, his own erection untouched so far.
he was concocting a strategy. Thor always turned right to spin if you got behind him. If Steve could get him to go for the turn and manage to roll and pop up in front of his left, Thor would be wide open. He’d have to be very fast. Speed was his friend against a bigger opponent.
- the practice of eating the flesh of one's own species.
He stood so heroically, it was easy to forget he was in a t-shirt and sweats instead of his armour and cape.
The armor thudded loudly as Tony dropped to the ground to watch Steve apparently lose his mind.
he asked through gritted teeth. If they were gonna get out of this, someone had to be put together enough to fly a ship. Hopefully they could find a ship.
It's about time we made it to the evil mastermind of the whole fic. TW for torture in this chapter, but I don't think it's super graphic. If you have specific torture triggers you want to avoid like method-wise, you can ask me in the comments and I'll let you know specifics, just don't want to spoil it for everyone else.
JARVIS lit a path past the main elevator to a back one, and through the hallway on the opposite side of the floor from the gym to Tony and Steve’s room. When they got into the room, Clint sat Tony on the bed and stripped him. Tony just stared ahead unseeing, having completely turned in on himself. Clint hoped he wasn’t just in their beating himself up for more things that almost certainly weren’t his fault. Unfortunately, Clint knew him; he probably was.
That earned a laugh from everyone.
Standing above him, smirking, was Clint.
He couldn’t even imagine finding Steve in that state.
Tony looked like it pained him to do so, but he also looked grateful when he saw that Clint was taking this seriously.
Phil sat up quietly, careful not to wake his sleeping lover. Hopefully Steve and Tony weren’t up yet, because he wanted to talk to JARVIS beforehand and see what kind of damage control could be done. He silently moved to the bathroom to shower before tackling the newest Tony-problem. As he stood straight again from undressing, there was Clint in the mirror reflection. Phil smiled wryly at him and shrugged.
Tony yelled at the top of his lungs. It echoed through the lobby over JARVIS voice announcing Natasha’s victory.
he started trying to scoot himself over toward the tent with one leg, on his butt, and only the opposite arm to balance. It was stupid. Clint jumped up and was over to the tent in minutes.
He asked finally.
Coulson’s tone was all business and brooked no argument, but they all knew that it really meant he was relieved that Tony wasn’t dead and that he had faith in his recovery.
Tony huffed.
Clint stood up a little too quickly and his chair clattered loudly as it tried to topple but regained its balance. The others gave him quick glances but no one said anything thankfully. Everyone was feeling off their game and Clint was sure he wasn't the only one desperate to get out of there.
There was a frantic note to his tone.
The nurse shook her head.
He wasn’t really expecting a response, already turning his thoughts to other topics while he drained another glass. The silence that settled into the room made him look up, confused. Everyone was staring at him.
Tony scoffed.
nervous. Tony was going to say yes. All Steve needed to do was ask. The question was really a formality; Steve and Tony had been promising each other eternity for awhile now. Tony wasn’t ashamed of being with Steve. They were only a secret because Tony thought the public couldn’t handle Steve being with a man. That was all.  The knock on the door forced him to give up on the internal pep talk.
They waited tensely, taking down the creatures around them half-heartedly. With enough force, they were all pretty easy fights, but it would have been a lot for one person to handle. Strange had definitely made the right call to bring a team. Tony watched Strange gasp and start levitating upward, hands scrabbling at his neck like he was trying to breathe.
He asked.
Clint exclaimed a bit too animatedly, causing him to bump Phil’s drink out of his hand. Phil leveled an irritated look at the archer, who scrambled away with a blush to replace the drink.
Before Steve closed the door behind him, he heard the man call out.
She turned to face Tony and she started pressing buttons on of the monitors.
Steve really didn’t want to talk about the ice.
Steve asked, already knowing the answer but trying anyway. They couldn’t risk a passerby getting their hands on the tech. When Tony didn’t deign to answer the question, he moved on.
Peter gasped.
his AI asked, not subtle at all in his judgement of Tony’s plan.
he said sadly, and he sounded so far away. He was no longer looking at Tony, but at the ghosts of his past.
The rascal even made it as far as the hallway before Steve caught up to him, scooping up the squealing bundle.
he yelled as loud as possible just as Clint screamed and suddenly he was falling backward.
Bruce asked, a slight laugh behind his words. At their silence he decided to press on.
Coulson said calmly and quietly.
Steve took a steadying breath through his nose.
His tone was harsher than he wanted, but he was trying.
The night of the opera was better than Frank could’ve imagined. Sure, his cheap suit was nothing compared to what the other patrons were wearing, but he felt good. An usher showed him to his seat, where he was going to get to watch an actual opera. The story was beautiful, and Maria’s character was the love interest for a tragic hero, but she secretly was toying with him while she pursued another man. It was devious and lovely, and Frank laughed louder than he should at the jokes, but it felt good. Maria definitely looked right at him during one of her parts, and he knew then, this was the love of his life.
the Mandarin asked quietly.
and try as he may to hide it, there was that hurt in his voice again.
Tony backtracked awkwardly.
he coughed, tasting copper.
Steve panicked, bringing one hand to Tony’s forehead, the other gripping Tony’s harder.
JARVIS spoke loudly. Tony startled away from the precipice of sleep, and fell gracelessly into a heap on the floor. He groaned.
Dr. Stein walked in a moment later, flipping on the lights to full capacity. Tony scowled in disgust.
Peter and Clint yelled in unison.
he spoke while chewing, sending flecks flying. Tony wiped a fleck of popcorn off his face.
TROUBLE SLEEPING? He signed at them.
Tony was far too weak for the motion to have any effect besides tiring him more. He looked down himself at the reactor’s light flickering. It came back dimmer each time, and he knew it would give out soon. The offending hand moved from Tony’s shoulder to directly on top of the reactor, and Tony could actually see the light being sucked into the man’s hand. All of the back up reactors were already drained. Tony was going to die down here. He should’ve listened to JARVIS. He just never suspected any danger in his own basement.
Sharlene sniffled.
he muttered.
Tony felt sweat pouring down his face, which was weird. Maybe he’d been working harder than he thought? That seemed unlikely since apparently MODOK was content to let his grunts do all the dirty work before he’d even join the fight, always ducking back and hiding when one of them got close to him.
He met Tony’s horrified gaze.
He spun the chair around in excitement.
she glanced over at the blushing man, only causing his blush to deepen.
he pulled out his government ID with his other hand while Zelma tentatively shook his outstretched hand. She stared at the ID for a moment before looking back at the stranger with wide eyes. Phil dropped her hand, gesturing for her to sit down again. She looked conflicted, but after a calm nod from Heather, she slumped back into a chair.
Tony heard the lab open, but had no interest in lifting his head off his work table to see the intruder.
Steve shook his head fondly. Thor brought enthusiasm to everything he did.
Steve whipped around to see the sorcerer collapse into a heap on the ground, wax figure safely cradled in his hand. Wanda seemed to take this as her moment to give in as well, because she glowed brighter for a moment, whispered
He hissed into the man’s ear.
There had to be a way to catch MODOK off guard. He was so quick to calculate all the probabilities of when and where each of them would strike, acting accordingly. The AIM scientists were all rounded up, so all that was left was this monstrosity. Cap’s shield was easily deflected by MODOK’s hand and he quickly swerved to the side to avoid Hulk crashing down on top of him. He even fired a repulsor blast at the knife Black Widow threw, and Tony never saw anyone beat Natasha in a battle of reflexes.
The humorless laugh that escaped him was almost a sob.
Steve stilled Tony’s roaming hands.
An hour later they were still trying to kill off these annoyong AIM goons and MODOK. The underlings were easy enough to incapacitate, but there were quite a lot of them. Tony could not for the life of him understand why any of these people wanted to follow a murderous floating head/computer thing. Of course he understood the more complicated parts of what MODOK is and what his motivations are, but why would people keep joining AIM? They were just signing up to be MODOK’s slaves and sacrifices.
Now that they were moving, Tony could see some of the obvious damage, and she was limping.
Tony rolled his eyes, leaning down to kiss the supersoldier before walking towards the mouth of the cave.
Steve gasped in surprise, pulling Tony into him and holding on tight for a moment. The mention thrust him back to 1939 when the historic performance had been the talk of the nation. Marian had been such a big deal, paving the way for African American singers, and she got to sing at the Lincoln Memorial. Steve’s mother had followed the woman’s career closely, always reminding Steve that until the blacks were treated right, the immigrants had no hope. She had died only months before the Lincoln Memorial performance.
Tony gave a jerky nod.
The sudden flurry of movement behind Steve startled both of the men playing cards. Steve managed to keep Tony from falling out of his bed when he tried to jump up, realized he was connected to too many things, and then got dizzy anyway.
Peter demanded, Tony nodding in agreement behind him. Steve sighed, moving to face the audience.
Natasha was perched on the edge of the kitchen counter beside the coffee machine.
Steve placed a hand on his husband’s shoulder and gave a tight squeeze. It grounded Tony, reminded him that he wasn’t alone in his anxiety. It also had the added side effect of shutting him up.
Everyone turned to look at Bruce, who was looking anywhere but at them.
he agreed easily. They took their time walking back towards Steve’s old neighborhood. The sun was slowly setting, the sky a gorgeous array of orange and pinks. Tony inhaled the crisp autumn air and allowed his current happiness to chase away the lingering bitterness about his childhood for the time being. He had a great life. The love of his life had married him, they adopted a wonderful son, and his team had become his extended family where he never really had a real one. Life was good.
Tony scoffed. Steve forgot to mention volunteers. Plenty of people will volunteer to do things for Tony Stark just for the chance to see him and the Avengers in real life.
He took off without looking back. Clint would not last long and there were a lot of bots left. Doom’s weapon also looked nearly completed. This couldn’t be how the Avengers went down, not to Doom of all people. They’ve fought much stronger. Tony needed to end this
JARVIS scanned the man beneath him, and his own neural electrical activity changed the moment he claimed to stop releasing pheromones. That was the most confirmation he was going to get, and he needed to get to his creator ASAP.
Matt Murdock’s voice floated through.
Steve asked.
Tony responded quietly. He was proud of the way the bitterness stayed out of his voice. He merely sounded bored. In truth it had hurt when he suddenly couldn’t get a hold of his friend. Nobody likes to be ghosted.
She left them in the too bright waiting room.
he stopped, the tears flowing freely now. He took a shuddering breath.
He turned to Strange,
Bruce replied,
He was always embarrassed to ask.
So as far as his co-conspirators knew, the plan was to feed Clint a drug laced pumpkin pie, then when he was tripping, scare the shit out of him with an air horn and strobe lights (in case Clint wasn’t wearing his hearing aids). It was nice and simple. Clint usually ate a whole pie himself, so it wasn’t even unusual to make several different pies. When the rest of them were eating pie around him, it would hopefully help the archer disregard any suspicion.
Steve cocked a brow at Tony, smirking.
he started as he touched Steve’s arm.
he whispered. He had prepared a little speech for this, where were the words now?
That was what brought Tony and Bruce here now, test tubes of their own collecting samples as well as large bags to pack away and tools they wanted and snapping photos of what they couldn’t carry with them. A lot of the objects reminded Tony of Chitauri technology crossed with Asgardian tools. He couldn’t pinpoint what exactly led him to believe that; he would have no way of pointing to any one trait that made him think of aliens and Asgardians, but it was currently a working theory.
No, he had to focus. He tore his gaze away from the hopefully not dead Tony, and glared at Dracula.
he lectured sternly. Clint couldn’t possibly be expected not to laugh at that!
he managed.
How could someone do something like this to someone like Tony? All in the name of  him being Captain America, ‘unsoiled’? The idea of Steve being with another man was so frightful to someone that they’d poison Iron Man just to stop it? It was completely illogical and  crazy, but that was the point. Steve was terrified in this very moment, and it was coupled with a rage and illogical desire to beat the waiter to death. Such violence wouldn’t help Tony survive, and it would do zero good for the world, but the idea of it alone helped assuage some of Steve’s fear. Fear could truly turn the gentlest of men to inhumane acts. It shouldn’t have been such a surprise to Steve, he had already seen it played out in the war, but the shock of it was real everytime he faced that reality. Tony would be okay, he had to be, but Steve would be haunted by this forever.
Clint tried, slumping into the kitchen chair in front of him.
Foggy countered, not unkindly. He wasn’t really close to Jessica like Matt was, probably because he didn’t have the whole hero thing they had, but he still liked the woman. She was crass and blunt in a refreshing way when one spends their days in stuffy courtrooms.  Matt wasn’t thinking clearly though.
The bad Microsoft Word Art at the top said
Clint snatched one, examining it closely.
The rest of the interview went by in a blur for the two of them. Tony wanted nothing more than to get Steve out of those clothes so he could show him how much he really appreciated the proposal. While he wasn’t necessarily against jumping the man on TV, public indecency was frowned upon and whatnot. When they got home, Tony couldn’t even strip immediately like he wanted, because the Avengers were waiting with a banner and surprise party. Tony and Steve grinned their way through the congratulations, making sure they spent a proper amount of time enjoying the party, but they both just wanted to be alone.
The Palais Garnier Opera House was haunted. A Punishing Phantom lurked in its hidden depths, and disappeared anyone he considered guilty. This could be stagehands abusing dancers, patrons who beat their wives, once even a conductor who had driven one too many harried musicians to suicide. The phantom of the opera left little notes with his verdicts on each victim with a hand drawn symbol in blood. It resembled an angry human skull with no bottom jaw and four elongated prongs in place of teeth. When the Opera House finally shut down, the symbol of the phantom was sometimes spray painted on the boarded up windows by local teens, always daring each other to go into the
The slight rustle in the leaves above Clint only happened during a breeze, so he thought nothing of it. Just once, he heard a sudden rustling noise, but when he looked up, a bird was flying away into the night. There was no reason to expect anyone out here. It was an impromptu trip. So when the branch just behind him made a cracking noise, he moved on instinct, decades of training taking over in an instant.
Natasha asked, always seeing things in a different light than Steve.
he hated needing Stephen Strange so much, but his desperation overrode his pride.
A younger woman, probably 18 but seemed like a child to Steve walked in wearing scrubs.
Steve did as he was told, anticipating what was next.
Tony thought they were gone when Thor stuck his head back in.
Tony hadn’t been to the basement in awhile. The temperature was chilly down here, kept cold to help the arc reactor avoid overheating. It was the first of its kind to power an entire building, and Tony was cautious with it. As long as he could safely say that the reactor had been powering his home with self-sustaining energy for five years straight, then he may be able to convince the world to switch to the cleaner energy source. Of course, that also required Tony to trust the world not to weaponize it, but that was a bridge to pass later.
She gave him a pointed look. Steve looked at Tony and back at her, his hesitation clear in his face. She pointed to the clock,
There were so many questions running through Tony’s head, but he knew he was probably going to fall asleep again soon. Apparently having an alien suck out your body’s energy really took it out of you.
he asked tentatively, suppressing a flinch when Bruce raised his hand. He knew Bruce would never hurt him.
Tony squeezed his hand painfully with the sudden show of pain. Steve couldn’t help the distressed sob that escaped him. Tony was comforting him when Tony was the one suffering. Steve brushed the sweat soaked hair away from Tony’s forehead.
Tony put the car in park, and made sure to make his moments slow as he exited the vehicle. The last thing he wanted was to scare the poor girl. He approached with his hands raised, so she knew he didn’t have a weapon. Maybe in the light, she’d recognize him from TV.
Coulson held up a hand to stop Steve.
Steve put a hand on Tony’s shoulder, firm but not painful.
Morgan whirled around in surprise.
Steve took them without a word, wrapping himself in the blanket and sipping the water.
He asked quietly.
he moaned. He knew Steve needed to talk and the others would want to see him. Plus, Tony wanted to know how Steve had apparently watched him in hell and knew he was going to have some explaining to do about Morgana, but he couldn’t do any of that right now.
Coulson jumped in.
He looked down at the child pointedly, ruffling his hair.
She asked Peter.
Steve entered his keycode to the lab, seeing Tony immediately. Tony was facing away from the door. Not wanting to startle the genius and get a repulsor blast to the face, he took his phone and flashed his flashlight until Tony noticed.
He gestured to the fire he had created with his genius,
Clint cut him off.
The small circles Steve was tracing between his shoulder blades helped. He waited until his shuddering breaths that came with silent crying returned to a more level cycle.
Steve sighed, glancing away before looking back at his love’s already drooping eyelids.
Warnings for self-hatred and suicidal ideation, mentions of 616 events where characters die and get seriously injured, but it's comics so none of it is permanent. Everyone is alive at the end I swear.
his voice bemused,
Natasha replied as she jumped from halfway down the stairs, landing in a roll. Her calm demeanor and tone were only skin deep because neither of her friends looked too good right now, but luckily there weren’t many guys left. The man who had shot them heard Steve’s running and turned on him, but Steve deflected the shot. He was about to fling his shield when Natasha reached up and snapped the man’s neck from behind, smiling grimly. No one had heard her.
Steve stopped short. He jumped up and ran to the bathroom, making it to the toilet just in time to wretch.
The vampire was predictably unconvinced. Just the idea of two bags of his blood filling at once made Tony feel a little nauseated. It had to be psychological, he hadn’t lost enough yet to feel anything.
God, it was like pulling teeth. Clint growled in frustration, tugging at his hair for a moment.
Tony started without looking away from Steve,
Tony was thinking the same thing, and he spotted the perfect solution.
The last goon went down, and Tony’s landing was rough, as he took a knee immediately. How many times had he been hit. He lifted the faceplate as the woman approached him.
Tony could hear his breath going more and more ragged, and the pain just kept getting worse, he didn’t know how he was going to get out of this one. He was able to hit the latch to lift the faceplate, but it was a struggle. As he got weaker he allowed himself to slowly sit, then lie down, the metal joints of the suit creaking and scraping as he moved with no power. He looked over as Clint fell, but there was nothing he could do and his vision was starting to go black around the edges. He kept pushing it away, focusing on breathing and the pain just to keep himself conscious. When the smoke and cape came in a swirl around him, he saw the Mandarin and was too tired to feel fear. Maybe Steve could save him. But when he felt his body jerked away from the scene with the Mandarin gripping his arm, the world feeling like it disappeared for a split second then came crashing back in another, it made his stomach twist. He
Steve looked up at the sound of JARVIS’ voice.
Tony looked disbelieving, but he pressed on.
There was no response over the calms, but Steve could hear the screams of Dracula stop, and Vision was already beside the jet by the time they were properly in the air. The jet bay opened to allow him entrance, and without a word he took Tony and zoomed off. The rush of air behind him nearly knocked Steve off his feet. He had never seen Vision that fast.
JARVIS remained silent, and Tony knew that meant he couldn’t come up with a better plan.
Tony said. Steve leaned in and they kissed gently. They would have plenty of time for passionate kisses.  The rest of their lives, in fact.
Abram shook his head.
He knelt down on one knee, making their eyes the same level, as she was still sitting.
Steve turned, surprised.
The man wasn’t even afraid of spiders! What the actual fuck!? He swept the screen away with a scowl. Maybe Clint had fooled them all. He was actually more of a genius than Tony and just played a dimmer character all these years. If Clint was actually a genius, the only use Tony really was was his money.
The woman in the crystal ball swirled and blurred, before morphing into a man Clint didn’t recognize.
and his shaky voice gave him away. How did this go south so quickly? He stared at his hands, betrayed by his body yet again.
the man responded smugly.
Clint pulled him up onto the sidewalk into a kiss, savoring the small whine he elicited from Phil as he pulled away.
Natasha said quietly.
After everything that had happened in previous Octobers, Tony no longer let his guard down. Really, he never let his guard down at all anymore. They had far too many powerful enemies to be even remotely careless. So Tony always had the suit. Steve had been furious, well really all of them had, when they found out Tony had injected himself with untested nanobots for his bleeding edge armour design, but in the end it worked so they got over it. Personally, Tony thought people had been far too caught up on the ‘risk’ of it all, it was his tech for god’s sake. They should trust his tech more.
she paused for a moment to look at the chart.
he squeaked. She smiled at his obvious fear. With a single upward sweep of an arm, both her and Tony disappeared, leaving behind a stunned silence.
Coulson spoke the same way he gave mission reports and debriefings. Clint was grinning at the man the entire time, snickering occasionally, and Phil was expertly ignoring the man.
Bruce sat in medical, waiting. It was all he could do. He needed Tony to be alright and he needed it like he needed air. He knew logically that he hadn’t actually done anything to Tony, but he needed to see Tony alive to believe it emotionally. Plus that was his best friend in there. He needed him alive because he needed his best friend. Bruce felt the tears well up again, and he dropped his face to his hands. Tony was so good to everyone. He never deserved anything like this. How many times was Bruce going to sit in a hospital waiting with baited breath to see if Tony makes it out alive yet again? This was the second time in the same month. Bruce had to watch as so many of his team members were hospitalized over and over, especially Tony. It was never Bruce. He was too invulnerable as the Other Guy. Just once he wished it would be him instead. If anyone deserved it, it was him.
foe warily.
he explained.
But she stopped when she saw his face,
Tony spun on his heel, making to head back towards the couch where Clint was engrossed in yet another video. The two had somehow ended up on the topic of Bigfoot towards the end of movie night, and had been arguing about it since. The world spun just a bit further than he expected, and Tony stumbled, landing half standing, half in Phil’s arms against his lap. He looked up and met the agent’s gaze and winked.
Tony went straight for the elevator, looking back impatiently when Bruce walked too slowly for his liking.
He couldn’t actually be walking away, right? He was joking, he had to be.
The basement didn’t even have cameras, that’s how sure Tony was of its security. JARVIS was able to use infrared down there, but it had seemed like a waste of power to have full camera capabilities down there when only Tony could access it.
He didn’t need to be told twice. Not that he could stay awake if he tried.
The way the archer’s head whipped around with a wide grin was a little scary.
She walked out the door, an excited looking Julie met her in the hallway and followed.
Tony was staring at him petulantly, and Clint was reminded of a toddler in trouble.
Tony snorted, and Steve was so thankful to have him back. That sobbing shell of pure pain had not been his husband.
Tony had been a lousy patient but he always is, and  he wasn’t particularly worse than usual. In fact, he had been a little better than usual under Dr. Stein’s stern rules and that’s probably another reason SHIELD had wanted her. That’s not it either. It had been difficult to get to see Tony, they had only been allowed because they’re the Avengers. If Dr. Stein had been a different doctor, Steve might have had to wait. What was it she had said? Something about immediate family… That’s it. Why wasn’t Tony his husband? Why weren’t they married yet? What were they waiting on? They lead too dangerous of lives to wait around a long time to get married, and if Tony would have him, Steve certainly knew he wanted Tony for the rest of his life. There was no one else for him at this point.
he trailed off, pointing at the elevator. Clint wolf-whistled after him.
It was two hours into their hike that Steve began to notice Tony’s discomfort. He kept adjusting the weight of his sack, grimacing when nothing seemed to help.
Steve had no chance to ask what that meant or agree before Strange was suddenly gone.
Tony interrupted.
Bruce took off his glasses, rubbing the bridge of his nose. He looked immensely disappointed.
he lied, sauntering towards the bar so he didn’t have to look at any of them. The lack of response behind him told him no one bought it. Tony poured another glass of bourbon, and a shot. He threw down the shot, set it down, and leaned heavily on the counter, dropping his chin to his chest. Just leave it alone, please, someone change the topic, he thought desperately.
Steve sighed. Something to dwell on later, he guessed. He pulled out his phone, sending a mass text to everyone to update them, including Pepper and Rhodes. He vaguely wondered if Thor got bars in Asgard. His phone buzzed in his lap.
Steve said loudly over the bustle, and Dr. Nicholson looked at him sharply. A shock with the defibrillator brought Tony back to a normal rhythm, and Dr. Nicholson ordered him sedated for the time being.
Bruce asked, genuinely interested in magic, something he knew so little about.
She glanced over at Clint and Phil.
he murmured, sleep already dragging him away.
The universe hated Tony. It was the only logical explanation for the irony of the whole thing.
Bruce yawned. Phil noticed that as he cleaned his glasses he was very carefully meeting no one’s eyes. He was understandably wary about whatever this situation was that he had walked into.
Frank stared at the hand, not really processing anything. What was he supposed to do with a hand? Oh. He reached out, allowing her to help him to his feet, shakily.
I got a little carried away with this one, so it's the longest chapter by far. That plus starting a new job is why I've fallen a little behind, so I'm sorry about the late update! Hope y'all are still enjoying this, I'm loving writing it.
Tony narrowed his eyes.
Tony ground out. He tried to give Steve a reassuring smile because the man looked so miserable and Captain America should never be that sad. Steve Rogers should never be that sad. He knew it was more of a grimace and it was hard to breath. The pain was growing with every second and he was dying.
) She was finished with this thorn in her side and would show no more mercy.
he thought because it was easier than thinking about the fact that his family was…
Tony spoke quietly, misunderstanding the reason for the distress.
Natasha teased him.
It was a good point. Tony looked at Steve’s gorgeous, sad eyes. He had made Steve sad, again. Hurting Steve was never his intention for anything.
Tony made a swiping motion through the air, and all of the interactive holograms disappeared. Tony walked over to stand face to face to Steve. BUT YOU BEST BE READY FOR REAL DEAF EXPERIENCE, he signed. NO TECH HELP UNLESS EMERGENCY. Tony looked far too smug, probably thinking about Steve’s finger-spelling earlier. Only Tony would somehow take a good idea and make it a personal challenge. Steve scowled after him as he left for his lab.
He stuck the needle into Tony’s left arm, and connected him to an IV bag, where Tony could see his blood beginning to drip into. He walked around to the other arm and began the same process.
Tony muttered. Remembering an accident that happened once in the lab, he suddenly had an idea. The flurry of movement caught Clint off guard, and he watched with interest as Tony pulled out his cell phone and quickly disassembled it, holding up the battery in triumph.
Tony opened his eyes in time to watch the agent hang up. He noticed Tony watching.
The laugh that escaped her was humourless.
he demanded.
They ended up on tuxes with each other’s usual colour schemes. Tony wore a light blue vest, with matching pinstripes on his pants. The tux jacket and bowtie were black with a blue shimmer that you could see only when the light hit it right. He thought it looked perfect with his engagement ring, and he used one of those blue tinted mascaras to accentuate his naturally long lashes. Now that he knew Steve had a thing for it, he finally had an excuse to start exploring some of the more feminine parts of vanity he’d always wanted to, but he’d start slow. There was the public to consider, of course.
Phil pulled into a spot about two blocks from the house on the flyer.
she snapped.
Steve explained from the doorway. He had a tray in his hands.
He remembered the suit shutting down, them barely making it through.
Tony groaned again, cradling his arm.
Strange takes care of business and Steve and Tony find their happy ending.
he called out. Tony had his head ducked behind something, so Steve couldn’t see his face. Steve saw a hand wave him off.
Tony rolled his eyes. Nothing dangerous could be down there. What would it even be living off of anyway? It had not left since appearing, according to JARVIS, and there was nothing down there as a water or food source.
Clint absolutely did
he drawled. They both knew that Natasha was a great spy, but Clint could pull off a con like nobody’s business. The older man laid down beside the archer on the bed, and they turned to face each other.
He seemed to mull their options over for a moment before shaking his head dejectedly.
Bruce asked.
Bruce asked.
it came out as a whisper.
he looked Bruce in the eyes.
Norman Osborne gets a hold of Tony and is determined to get the information he wants. He will not take no for an answer, and Tony would learn that the hard way.
Clint made a loud pop on the ‘p’ sound.
Tony sighed.
the shithead singsonged.
Natasha was keeping pressure on the wound, but it was difficult while Clint writhed beneath her.
Tony placed a hand on Steve’s shoulder.
Please comment with your thoughts on the existence of Bigfoot, or any other cryptids for that matter. I love cryptid talk.
she wrote. After assuring Sharlene that she would call when she found the man, Jessica escaped the drab motel for her car. She examined the map on her phone, noting places the missing man may have stopped between here and his home.
Steve was making this worse. Why was he so bad at this?
It was a good assessment on Tony. Natasha read people well, and Steve was glad she had never been assigned to write a file on him. He didn’t think he’d like what she’d have to write. Steve let the story wash over him, thinking about what it must’ve been like being Tony and thinking that no one should be bothered by the knowledge that he was dying. The genius had come along way. It was no small feat that the man now allowed them all in behind the public Stark mask. The battle to remind him that he didn’t need to face things alone was ongoing, as it was for a lot of them, but Tony had made tremendous progress.
Steve closed his eyes, took a deep breath, and when he reopened them he looked much calmer.
The applause erupted when Steve stood. Tony met his eyes, confused.
Natasha sighed, looking at the floor as she remembered watching Tony die slowly while he kept it to himself.
His head ached. Tony wasn’t sure what they drugged him with, but he hoped it wasn’t too dangerous. Pepper knew better than to take coffee from another employee before giving it to him. She knew any food items had to come through high security clearance personnel before it could be handed to Tony. It was only a logical policy to have given his history with assassination attempts as well as… yep, you guessed it, kidnappings!
Sure, Clint had a lot of scars, like anyone in the hero business that didn’t have special healing factors, but Tony’s scars weren’t normal. The skin around the arc reactor was all scar tissue, jagged and pink, with longer scars here and there jutting out like hands on a clock. It had never really occurred to Clint before just how much of Tony’s chest must be missing. A lot of the sternum was probably gone, which meant the ribs there were probably a little more free floating than they should be. That or wedged against the metal. There’s no way his heart and lungs weren’t being pushed out of the way by it, misplaced. He knew how big the reactor was, how had he never thought about this?
Steve admonished, but his voice was amused, not angry. It was a habit Tony had tried and failed to break many times. Tony laughed and waved it off.
in unison.
Tony actually chuckled, and it seemed like this was getting easier.
Natasha punched him in the stomach, knocking the air out of him. He gasped and coughed, unable to move away from her or bend over in pain.
until Bruce shook him. When had he gotten dressed?
He didn’t sound worried at all. Steve decided then and there that he hated the smug bastard.
Mr. Doll seemed to be satisfied with the number of injuries for a while, occasionally digging around in the wound again. Once, Tony had stopped breathing altogether for a whole minute, twitching with the effort to take in air, but unable to and clutching at his chest. Steve had had a moment of terror thinking that might be their final moment. Tony had held his gaze, eyes wide with terror as they all heard the monitors screeching their alerts. When he finally gasped and arched up off the bed suddenly, Steve had nearly fainted with relief.
Clint broke the silence.
Tony had a lot of experience with being captured and tortured unfortunately. He was kidnapped a few times as a child, a side effect of being the child of a famous billionaire. Then there was the kidnapping in Afghanistan which was done by this guy’s men, so what’s the worst that could happen?
He looked at Tony, who was crossing his arms tensely in an attempt to stop fidgeting,
he whispered. He was afraid of someone else, more so than Natasha. She could fix that.
JARVIS intoned from above.
Tony and Steve hadn’t succeeded in their nap either. Dr. Strange studied each of the Avengers like they were interesting paintings, and the room was awkwardly quiet. Tony refused to believe that Strange didn’t make everyone uncomfortable on purpose. He saw through it. Stephen Strange acted just a bit odder and just a bit more mysterious than he actually was so people would let him stay isolated. That was Tony’s hypothesis anyway; it was similar enough to Tony’s antics when he didn’t want people getting close. He had yet to have the chance to test the hypothesis (his plan was to get the sorcerer drunk).
Tony took another look at the roaring beast, his quiet and meek friend transformed beyond recognition, and had a sinking suspicion that Hulk would have no trouble crushing the armour like aluminum foil if he really wanted.
He looked up at Steve,
Steve whispered in his ear and kissed Tony’s neck, biting just a little. Tony hissed but otherwise continued what he was doing.
Tony kept focusing on his breathing. It helped. He nodded for Steve to continue.
he managed before going back to sleep.
she repeated calmly.
Tony startled awake at Clint’s outburst, and Steve could punch the archer, Tony needed to sleep. The genius reached down and took another bite of pizza as though he hadn’t just been asleep.
JARVIS interrupted Steve’s punches.
he mumbled, and Clint’s heart broke. After all this time together, Tony still felt inadequate for Steve. It didn’t matter to him that he was Steve’s world and that Steve would love him no matter what. Tony still hated himself. Clint could understand; he still felt he didn’t deserve Phil, and at least Phil wasn’t an American icon.
“The time is 11:02 am and you have been in the workshop for four hours and thirty-eight minutes.”
Midmorning on Monday, Pepper walked into Tony's office without knocking, carrying a medium-sized shipping box. “Tony, why did I get a package addressed to Pepper 'best assistant anyone could ask for' Potts? This is not the right size to be a new pair of Jimmy Choos. Also, still the boss.”
big a deal, right? Just terminology, labels, a grasp at permanence...
“Shh, shh...” Steve shifted them, lying more on his back and letting Tony rest the back of his head on Steve's bicep. “Better?” Tony gulped air a bit. “There you go, just breathe.” His pinned arm cradled Tony's side without holding him down.
; the half-hopeful, half-terrified look on his face gave Steve some hope that Tony's thoughts were tracking in the same general direction as his.
Ye Gods, this chapter has been a bastard... Actually, this is only half the chapter, I was having so much trouble, and the damn thing was getting so long, I broke it in two. The other/next part should be up soon, it's mostly written already, thank you for your patience with my easily-distracted muse.
Steve cupped his cheek, turning his face back. “I would be happy to brag about you to whoever. I'm more than willing to tell people. What do
Steve cupped Tony's jaw in his hand. “Awake, asleep, or drugged up in medical, I'd rather be with you than apart from you.” He dropped his hand, scooped up his sketchbook and pencil pouch, and headed towards the elevator. “You going to work on those upgrades for Nat's Bites?”
I am lucky enough to be your first everything, I promise I'll make it amazing...” He went back to kissing Steve, molding their bodies together.
, though maybe not directly.... “Hey, JARVIS, is Pepper available?”
He didn't even have to think. “Breath play. Nothing where I'm drowning, or suffocating, or...” He pulled in on himself, wrapping his arms around his ribs. Steve sat up a bit more, hugging him gently, and he took a deep breath just to know he could. “Umm... Humiliation? I grew up being teased, bullied, it's very much not a turn-on.” He thought for a minute. “Nothing else is coming up now, but I, ah, I'm pretty sure I'll be thinking about this a lot, so there will probably be a list at some point. Oh, no, wait, one more definite no. No piss or shit.”
Tony shuddered, but took another long, slow stroke, out and in. “Holy God, and
Captain ran his hands over Tony's body again, a little faster, a little rougher. “Oh, yes, pet, I will definitely do that. Do-” He faltered a little, then resumed. “Do you prefer any type of pain? Sharp or hard or-” He broke off, his hips lurching up raggedly, jostling Tony in the best way.
Barnes gave him a strange look. “No, sir. Why would I?” Tony gestured pointedly, and Steve held out his wrist, Bucky bending over to scent him deeply. Tony could see the moment it registered; Barnes’ face drained of blood, all his muscles going tense. Tony had to give him credit, though. His scent might have soured with fear, but he was calm and composed as he straightened up and turned to face Tony, his spine straight and his chin up. “I know you’ll do what you have to, my Lord, but please. Not in front of Steve? Don’t make him have that memory.”
Steve covered Tony's hand with his own. “I'm fine with that. Honestly. I-” He smiled softly. “I'm perfectly happy with it being just in the family for now.” He couldn't help the grin. “We're gonna have to be careful not to touch each other that much, though, or smile too much at each other, or... Hmm, maybe we just shouldn't be out in public together for a while...” Tony, who had been looking more and more miserable with each 'can't', stared at him, stricken, at the last thought. Steve laughed and swooped in to kiss him. “Hey, you know, I'll be fine, it's less hiding than I would have had to do in the 40s.”
*A*A*
Until Steve's hands grabbed Tony's hips, and they flared with pain. Tony flinched, and Steve pulled his hands away, looking worried. “Oh, sorry! Wait, what?” He scooted up on the bed, forcing Tony to shift to sitting up too. The blanket fell away, revealing a hand-shaped bruise on each of Tony's hips. Steve reached out, but drew himself up short of touching. “Oh, wow, did I do that to you? Jeeze, Tony, I'm sorry, I didn't-”
Good option two, the one Tony hardly dared even hope for, was that Steve might actually be interested in a real, actual relationship with him, Tony, Stark the Fuckup. Of course, Tony being Tony, he knew that he'd end up screwing it up somewhere down the line, but maybe, just maybe, Steve might give him half a chance first. And Steve did seem like the kind of guy who would try to be friends with his exes, so once it didn't work out they could probably go back to what they had now, right? Then again, if he really spectacularly fucked it up with Steve, that would probably fuck his relationships with the rest of the team, too, and all of that was far too valuable to risk just to fulfill his stupid adolescent crush. Suppress and deny, that was the Stark way, and he could practice it with the best of them. Don't upset the applecart, that was best.
! Ha, oh, you totally deserved that!”
Tony meant to bite lightly at the side of Steve's neck, but it quickly turned almost primal. He growled into Steve's ear. “So hot. Seriously, you, doing this, might just be the hottest thing ever. But don't hold me to that, the night is yo-oh.” Steve had stopped moving, and Tony realized that Steve was pulling at his shirt, and he was pulling at Steve's shirt, and they were just going to get tangled... He dropped his feet and took a step back, taking Steve's shirt with him. Steve got Tony's shirt over his head, but when Tony caught a glimpse of the arc reactor's light, he had a moment of shock, of horror at his strange cyborg nature. He took another couple of steps back, quick and light, pressing both shirts to it like he could hide it.
Steve went last, but instead of hugging Tony, he sat down heavily on the couch next to him and gazed into his eyes. “Tony, you have always been the best thing about coming to the future. I have had a lot of regrets in my life, and I don’t want this to be one of them. If this is my last chance… Tony, can I kiss you? Please?”
Y'all should also know that I originally planned to be posting the sequel today (Musie hasn't been as cooperative as I'd like), but there are at least two more chapters to this before I can even talk about the sequel, and probably four or five in total before this part of the story is done. (The Christmas story was meant to be a one-shot, but it maaaay turn into a chaptered. I'm... not good at short stories.) And there is definitely a third part, after the Christmas story, which involved plans and endgames and fun stuff like that. So stick around, it's gonna be a wild ride!
Clint, Steve, and Thor all exclaimed and crowded close, but Strange stayed back, wiggling his fingers in arcane (Tony assumed) gestures. Tony raised an eyebrow at him, and his drew together in response. Well, that wasn’t good. Strange nodded ponderously. “I’m sad to say, it’s definitely a curse, and very likely to get worse. Nothing is jumping out at me here regarding ways to remove it, unfortunately. I’ll have to research it further. Where did you say you acquired it?”
, you want to kiss me. Because I want to kiss y-” He was cut off by Tony's lips latching on to his, and Holy God, it was good. Skin-scorchingly good. Steve had no idea kissing could be this good. Tony's tongue was exploring his mouth, coaxing Steve's tongue into his own mouth... Their arms were wrapped around each other, pressing their chests close, and their jocks... Steve never wanted this moment to end, but he also was desperate to get to the rest of it, his body screaming for it... Tony broke the kiss, and Steve took a moment to pant for breath. “Well, I guess that answers that. Wow.”
And the Hell of it was, he knew that, at least for now, they couldn't really be any more public than they would have been in the 30s and 40s. Steve knew he was going to want to kiss Tony, there among the art, but there would be plenty of other people there, with video cameras on their phones, and, well, that just didn't bear thinking about. So it would still have to have the mask of
Tony rolled over just enough to look at him. “Need? Maybe, maybe not. Want? Like you wouldn't believe!” He grinned ingratiatingly.
Even without looking, he could tell Tony was grinning. “I'm glad you like them. I'm very proud of them, myself.” That broke him out of his daze enough to glance over and grin back. Tony was very clearly watching his face, rather than looking at the art, but Steve found he didn't really mind. “Wanna get closer to one of them?”
There was a long silent moment, then Tony heard himself say, “Welcome to the club!” He felt a smile (oh, god, please don't let it be the manic grin, please, not the manic grin...) stretch across his face.
*A*A*
Bruce, on the other hand, could be counted on to be dignified. “Well, I for one say congratulations. You both deserve happiness, and if you're finding it together I couldn't be happier for you.”
I'm not dead yet!
The alpha chuckled, a sound that did funny things to Steve’s insides. “They didn’t show you any portraits? Typical… I’m Duke Anthony, your betrothed.” He stood and held out his wrist to be scented. Steve nosed up against it cautiously, and was relieved to find he… well, he very much liked the scent the other was putting off, and he was sure it wouldn’t be a hardship to smell it the rest of his life. Duke Anthony cupped Steve’s cheek briefly and smiled. “I would very much like it if you would call me Tony.”
him to keep at MIT.
“Wha-?” Steve's head jerked up and around, and he caught sight of the shiny red cock jutting out of the hologram in front of Tony. He instantly turned bright red himself. “I- Oh, my God, Tony, did you really-?” His sweatpants were definitely developing a suspicious bulge. “Wait, fantasies involving me? From before you met me?” He squirmed, caught between emotions.
They moved along to the second floor, which held all the most recent stuff, and Tony had to dive into a discourse on post-modernism and the reflection on art
Steve acted without thinking. He needed to remind Tony that he'd been claimed, that Steve had chosen
Tony wisely stepped out of his way, but followed after him. “Well, that just won't do. First of all, if we're going to be seen in public together, you're going to have to do better than off the rack slacks and the same t-shirt as every damn SHIELD grunt. I'll take you to my tailor, he'll be ecstatic to work with your proportions.” He snagged a couple of white cardboard containers and a pair of chopsticks, and flopped down onto the couch. “Second, I have preposterous amounts of money, you should help me spend it. Seriously, I could probably afford to buy two or three small nations. JARVIS, get Steve set up with a debit card and a Black AmEx, both linked to my personal account.” Steve, clutching egg rolls and chopsticks in one hand and more white cardboard in the other, sat hesitantly on the couch, and opened his mouth to object. Tony pointed the chopsticks at him. “Believe me, I will never notice your withdrawals. I hardly pay attention to mine until we get up to medium-sized vehicles. JARVIS?”
Steve chuckled, and was amused to hear how... evil it sounded. His voice was more growl than speech. “
But Steve was distracted. “Did... Did he say 'afternoon'?” He took a better look out the window, and realized it really
Tony shrugged carelessly and flopped next to him, thighs pressed against each other. “Well, it was supposed to be dessert last night, but we got a little distracted...” He sighed happily at the memory, and stuck two fingers in the cake, pulling off a chunk. He shoved the chunk in his mouth and talked around it. “Befide, we're phil felebrathing.”
This time Tony let the subject be changed. He found himself at a surprising loss for words anyway. Now that the rush of adrenalin from hearing that word, from
Tony mustered up a shaky smile in return. “Here I am. Blech. Yeah, that wasn't fun.” He scrubbed at his face, but the feeling of Obie's breath on his skin wouldn't go away. “Dammit, I'm not going to be able to get back to sleep.”
There was too much space between them. Steve drifted closer. “No, actually. I thought there might be something up with you. You were awful quiet all evening. You ok?” Oh, sure, great, go all mother hen on him. That's awful romantic, Rogers!
Tony grinned at him, hoping he wouldn't notice the uncertainty under it. “But you had a good time?”
, and then
*A*A*
Steve grinned. “Believe me, I plan to try. Tough with this one, though.”
Steve obediently turned over, swinging his leg high over Tony's head, and settled back against the pillows, legs spread wide and jock leaking pre-cum all over his stomach. His voice was low, almost hoarse, barely recognizable to himself. “Like this?”
Tony waved a hand carelessly. “No, no, this is why I built a proper AI, so you could take this sort of initiative. I'm very pleased.” He started opening containers.
*A*A*
And the penny dropped. So did Rhodey's jaw. “You. You're going to- Seriously? After all this time?”
Tony looped his arm around Steve's. “That's alright, I have to get ready for work anyway. C'mon, I'll clear out a couple of dresser drawers for you.”
Clint, for instance, turned out to be an excellent cook, knowledgeable about nearly every major cuisine Tony could name, but usually just experimenting with whatever they had on hand, and making it delicious every time. Steve had a good grasp of the basics of cooking, the cheap-and-filling stuff from the Depression and the War, and Clint was teaching him the fancier and more complicated types. He would usually intersperse those instructions with lessons on history or geography or current events. Sometimes, if Bruce had wandered up from the labs, he would chip in a hand or a factoid. It was friendly and cheery and tasty, and Steve always looked so proud when the rest of them praised a new recipe.
, it was somehow even harder to grasp than the part where they were fucking like bunnies in spring, Captain America actually wanted to date
for the evening. He ran his hands up and down Tony's back and ass a few times, then grabbed him by the thighs and stood up, as smoothly as he could manage. Tony groaned in pleasure, and tangled his fingers in Steve's hair even as his legs wrapped around Steve's waist. Jesus, Mary, and Joseph, but Steve loved to be able to do this. To pick up a full-grown man, and carry him across the apartment like a child (nothing like a child, Steve loved Tony's goatee and his very adult erection, oh, God, their jocks were rubbing together again, that would probably never stop being amazing), made him feel
“Aw, c'mon, what if we get Dr. Foster and her friend to-”
Tony was perfectly happy with that, until his stomach grumbled. “Dammit, Rogers, what the Hell? You've got my body expecting food on a regular basis!” He pushed himself up and back to sit against the headboard.
“Tony.” It was firm, very Captainy, and Tony could hear echoes of every order Steve had ever given. It made his knees weak; he sagged, just a little, against the reassuring bulk of Steve's torso. “Tony...” And this one was softer, almost fond. “You want this, yes?” Tony found he had no words, so he just nodded enthusiastically. Steve grinned. “So do I. Oh, I want...” This time he leaned down, reclaiming Tony's lips, sliding his tongue into Tony's mouth, and Tony fell into it again.
Steve was breathless with the perfection of the moment. He pushed aside all the implements on the bed and laid down on his side next to Tony, pressing his front to Tony's side and covering everywhere he could reach with kisses. “Oh, baby, oh, pet, so gorgeous, so perfect, my perfect pet, my beautiful baby...” He kept that up until Tony's blinking slowed, until he got his breathing under control and opened his mouth to speak.
Steve had a natural talent for adjusting to new situations. Secretly, he suspected that was part of why he'd taken to the Serum so easily- he just... adapted, and made the best of the new circumstance. So he thought he was dealing pretty well with preparing to freeze and/or drown to death, and then waking up 70 years in the future. (The future itself was a whole different story. There was a lot more to adjust to there...) When he'd been at the SHIELD barracks, he'd been friendly enough with the others that they probably thought of him as an actual friend (though he hadn't let himself get close to any of them, he wasn't ready for that yet), and when Stark had invited them all to move in to his tower, he'd agreed more from a logistics and tactics standpoint than anything.
. “I believe Captain Rogers has expressed a fondness for this film, Sir.”
Without any instruction, Steve's feet brought him closer, close enough to see Tony's face, barely illuminated by the city lights and the arc reactor glowing through his shirt. How to ask? How to even bring up-? Damnit, he was no good at this! “Is this about my announcement at dinner? Were you, um... hoping to come out first? Or planning to never come out? Or-” Please not the second one, please not the second one...
He looked startled. “Excuse me?”
Tony wriggled a little, as if testing something, then hmmed. “More?” Steve nodded to himself and removed his hand. Set four was not quite as hard as set three, but was aimed at his thighs instead. Tony jumped and sucked in air with those, but didn't say anything, so Steve kept going, sets five and six continuous and scattered across Tony's back and sides. By the end, Tony was panting, but with lust, and his jock was dripping onto the bed. He nodded raggedly. “Yes, please. That. Please, yes.”
Tony groped for words for a moment. “I- The- The part where-” He staggered back a couple steps, til his ass hit the dresser. “The times I'd wake Pepper, she always just said, it's fine, Tony, it'll be better in the morning, and then she'd hug me and go back to sleep, and you're all dressed and shit...”
Tony faked outrage. “Excuse me? I think I was pretty forthcoming last night...”
They were both grunting and groaning and making little half sentences, all “pound my ass” and “so fucking tight”, and every noise drove Steve to new heights of arousal, new depths of desperation. He shifted his grip to Tony's shoulders, trying to pull him closer, then dragged his nails down his back. Tony yowled and clenched around him, thrusting back at him with equal need. That was enough to trigger his next orgasm, his thrusts turned to twitches and jerks for a minute or two. Now Tony's hole was so well lubricated that Steve started to worry he might slip out, and so he regained his grip on Tony's hips, which just gave him the leverage to shift their position around a little...
He finished cleaning up, tossed the washcloth into the hamper, and sat down tailor-style on the bed. Tony was still sprawled on his front, his back from shoulder to knee an abstract painting of red welts and bruises in yellow-green and blue-purple. What Steve could see of his face was stretched out in a blissful grin, his visible eye dazed and unfocused. (Steve's fingers itched for pencils or paints.) Tony gave a happy sigh. “You are going to kill me. I'm serious, I have a heart condition here, you know.
*A*A*
been too quick. But, really, the orgasm had only taken the edge off his lust, it would be fine, he just had to- “I guess we can-” Tony started to shift away.
, Tony Stark, Merchant-
Tony shuddered, wanting nothing less than to talk about it, but his mouth opened anyway. “I- I was trapped. Couldn't breathe. Couldn't-”
Oh, that was promising. “Sure, JARVIS, I'd love to talk to him.” The screen lit up, and there was Tony, opening his mouth to say something. He froze, mouth gaping slightly, eyes glazed over, just staring, for a long moment. Steve was mostly amused, but a little concerned. “Tony? Did you want to talk to me, or just stare at my body?”
go to Farber's lecture on n-space reversals, didn't you?” He led Bruce through to the dining room, still peppering him with questions, and the rest of them trailed after.
He was startled into laughter. “Well, you know, now that you mention it...” He gave Steve a quick Elevator Look. “But I did want to say... So, I know I promised you nice suits and a classy meal, but I was hoping you didn't want that
There was a small part of Steve that wanted to break out in delighted laughter at the ridiculous little dance Tony was doing, but the rest of him was miserable. It was as bad as he'd feared. He would be another notch on Tony's bedpost, maybe a few pages or a chapter in Tony's eventual memoirs; worst case, Tony really would push him on people, expect him to jump into bed with them, just to prove something. He summoned a smile. “Well, I'm glad you're pleased with yourself.”
Stephen sighed. “Hello, Mr Stark. Now will you explain what’s wrong? I assume it’s to do with the rather noxious magical aura around you?”
He was just settling into his rhythm on the heavy bag when JARVIS broke in again. “Captain? Sir would like to speak with you.”
Steve blinked as that processed. “I- Wow. Um, you're welcome?” He flashed on Tony's usual 'beer with dinner, scotch in the evening, every single day' routine, and frowned a little. “Tony... Do you usually drink every day?”
When they'd eaten enough to make an actual dent in the leftovers, Steve decided to put into effect the next part of his plan. He nudged Tony with a shoulder. “Hey, go grab the lube and come here.” Tony looked as if he might ask questions, but he disappeared into the bedroom and came back a moment later with the tube in hand. He stopped just out of Steve's reach, eyed him suspiciously, and opened his mouth. Steve grinned and patted his thighs. “Sit, sit.” Tony grinned back and started to sit facing him, but Steve shook his head and made a little twirling motion with one finger. “Facing the tv.”
Tony grinned at them, deliberately showing more teeth than the others would find comfortable. “So very nice to meet you both. And we’re going to be seeing much more of each other. You two will be staying here in Hattan after the wedding. In fact, tonight, after this Bacchanal, I would like you to help me accompany Earl Steven to his temporary quarters, so I can discuss your new roles with you.”
have anything to hide, so if people find out, they find out. But we don't ever have to officially announce anything if you don't want to or don't think it's a good idea.”
Steve thought for a moment. “Not really. Why?”
Tony woke up slowly, a little confused as to why the emptiness of his bed made him upset. Then he rolled over, and smelled Steve's pillow, and remembered one of the best weeks of his life, and that he had an actual date today. Not that he could be nearly as PDA as he wanted to be, not after this week of having their hands all over each other whenever they were home. He spent a moment cursing the newfound sense of maturity and propriety that had him keeping the relationship... quiet. Subtle. He was Tony Stark, he didn't
The Ewoks' creepy little song roused him just enough to push himself to sitting up. He let Steve lead him to the bathroom so they could brush their teeth, and then to bed. He curled up on his side, Steve wrapping around his back and tucking them in, and then he surrendered fully to sleep.
Tony made a sound something like a laugh. “Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. Just a lot on my mind. Genius and all, remember?” Oh, god, please let that mean that he really was thinking about- Well, he was looking an awful lot, right?
Tony had barely cleared the bedroom door before he was peeling off all of his clothes, leaving a trail behind as he headed for the bed. Steve just used his free hand to tear his shirt off, the shreds drifting down to join Tony's clothes, and Tony's brain exploding in lust overload. They both scrambled onto the bed, the rest of Steve's clothes disappearing somewhere along the way, and Tony pulled him down for some heated kisses.
Steve poked thoughtfully at the remains of his cereal. “I, ah, I guess I hadn't thought about it yet. Umm, but now that I am...” He looked up at Tony through his lashes. “I think I was already thinking of us as partners. We run this team together, don't we?”
Steve let go with both hand and mouth, and sat back. “Tony? Everything alright?” Tony nodded, but he was panting hard, and his eyes were black as midnight. Steve moved up to lay beside him on the bed. “You sure?”
enjoyed yourself. Good.”
Tony's orgasm ripped through him like the Hulk on a rampage, flinging his limbs every which way. He yowled with it, a nearly inhuman sound, and his eyes flew open in shock and pleasure. He landed on his stomach, his limbs twitching, again and again, in aftershock. He gulped air, blinking furiously as he tried to figure out what the hell had just happened.
Tony grinned and tucked his hand into the crook of Steve's arm. “I would be delighted, good sir.” They turned toward the elevator, which opened immediately.
God, he loved making her blush. “You're pretty amazing yourself, Tony. Take care of yourself, ok?” He laughed again as she closed the call.
The Internet was... instructional. He'd already had the 'the Internet is full of porn' talk from Tony. And Clint. And Nat, but she'd been more helpful, helping him figure out how to tell which Google links were blue videos, or written smut, instead of what he was actually looking for. (Clint had mentioned Safe Search, but Nat dismissed it as a crutch.) Granted, that was a bit harder to discern when your search was 'want to kiss my male friend', and he'd stumbled across some
was it happening? Steve's thoughts were whirling.
There was the usual round of yummy noises and compliments to the chef, then Steve finished his beer in one long gulp and set the empty bottle down hard enough to chip the glass. Five pairs of eyes focused on him, curious, and he took a deep breath, then very obviously tried to be casual. “So, I learned a new term this week, and I think it applies to me. Bisexual.” He snagged Bruce's still-unopened beer, popped the cap off with his thumb, and started gulping it down.
Tony's breath caught, his heart pounding. “Ohhh... yesss...” And then he realized that Steve's cock, which had gone partially soft inside him, was getting hard again. He clenched experimentally, and it sprang to full hardness. “Oh! Oh, my god, really?” He was grinning in sheer delight. “Damn, gotta love that Serum! Mmmm...” He squirmed, exploring the feeling of being forced open, liking it way more than he would have expected. He started to seriously work his hips, fucking himself for real on Steve's cock.
Steve felt his jock, which he had only just gotten under control, twitch at the very notion of it. “Well, now that you mention it...”
Steve cleaned himself up a bit, then took the warm washcloth back to the bed, knelt next to Tony, and slowly, gently, carefully, wiped up all the various bodily fluids he was coated in. He even rolled him onto his side for a moment, to wipe up the streaks on his front. Tony made a few happy mumbles, but was completely limp and pliant. Steve felt a warm glow in his chest that he'd gotten Tony to this state.
Tony hugged him around the shoulders briefly. “No, no, of course not, it's far too early for that.
Steve turned to give him a long look. “You really think I'm getting back to sleep tonight either? What part of 'not ignoring this and leaving you alone with your misery' did you not understand?”
When the staff was sufficiently cowed, he finally let himself retreat to his lab and close the door. He had about fifteen new ideas bouncing around in his brain, and he put in a good solid couple of hours drawing up blueprints, making notes, and generally being a genius. But then his happiness bubbled up again, and he
powerful.
He came back to himself lying sideways on the couch, Steve still kneeling on the floor, but now with his cheek on Tony's hip, as another black and white movie was starting. “Ug, JARVIS, I cannot deal with any more of this. I need explosions and hokum. Give me
“Hey now.” Steve grabbed his wrist, but held it lightly, just keeping him in place. “Nothing to be ashamed of here.” Tony dropped his eyes, and Steve stepped up close, putting a finger under his chin to lift it up. He gave a soft smile (number 12, I Really Care). “First of all, I knew it was there, you've had it as long as I've known you. Second,” he slid his hand around to cup Tony's cheek. “I think it's beautiful. Not just for itself, not just because it's keeping you alive, but because it came from your mind, and I think you might have the most beautiful mind I've ever known. I-” He broke off, giving Tony a kiss as gentle as the previous ones had been wild. “I don't ever want you to hide it from me.”
Bruce realized he was scowling at the chemical-formula-filled notebooks they had retrieved in yesterday’s raid. Some of these notations were symbols he had never seen used in math or chemistry before, and at least a few equations seemed to introduce energy sources he couldn’t identify. All in all, the whole thing had him more frustrated than was safe for the lab, or indeed the building.
) backside, then hopped to his feet with a manic grin.
Tony tried desperately to pull two thoughts together. “I- Um, I... God, I don't know, I've never-” Was he blushing? He hadn't blushed since puberty hit! “No one's ever asked...”
” His face was absolutely appalled.
Steve leaned in to kiss Tony's temple, then snagged the rest of the waffle. “Complimenting your mind and calling you weird is romantic, so noted.” Tony made a scowly face and looked like he wanted to object, but when he opened his mouth, Steve just fed him some waffle and grinned unrepentantly.
Tony shifted one hand to wrap it around Steve's jock, and he abruptly realized how close he actually was to orgasm. “Oh, God, yes, please, I'm gonna, I need to, please...” Tony gave him a few quick strokes, thrusting in and out of him in the same rhythm, and Steve orgasmed so hard he actually thought he might be dying. His whole body spasmed and jerked, random nerves firing impulses in every direction, and he was distantly aware that he was clenching around Tony, and that Tony was crying out, and, OH, spurting into him, and oh, my GOD, that was another orgasm, hard on the heels of the previous. He completely lost consciousness for a second or two, then drifted for a timeless time in the space between conscious and unconscious.
of dirty thoughts rushing through his head, til Steve coughed a little. “Tony? Did you want to talk to me, or just stare at my body?”
“Tony! Tony, baby, wake up, it's just a dream!” His eyes snapped open, and he tried to bring up his hand in repulsor-firing position, but he was still trapped, he still couldn't breathe- “I got you, you're ok...” His head swiveled to the source of the voice, and his eyes locked on to other eyes, the bluest blue made even more blue by the arc reactor. The corners of the blue eyes crinkled a little in a smile as Tony tried to process who- what- “Hold still, baby, you're all tangled in the blankets, let me get you there...” Steve. Steve was... here! Tony went completely limp, and let his partner-
Steve took a deep and appreciative sniff of his food as the waitress set it in front of him, barely managing to not moan and creep the poor girl out. He took a careful bite of fettuccine carbonara, rolling it around in his mouth, and stifled another moan at the taste. “God, you know all the best restaurants.” Tony grinned and nibbled on his lasagna. Steve looked down at his food, then up at Tony through his lashes. “You know, I was colorblind growing up?” Tony leaned in, intrigued, and Steve nodded. “Half of that, back there, probably would have been wasted on me as a kid. 'S part of why I work mostly in charcoal and pencils. I'm starting to think I need to pick up oil paints, though. Those Rothkos....” He sighed in appreciation.
(See the end of the chapter for
noon or just after. He shook his head. “Wow, this is some different way to live. Sleeping til noon, eating take out all the time...” Which of course redirected his attention to the food. And there was a lot of it. One container of just bacon, another of just sausage,
Steve was being magnetically drawn toward Tony, and he barely caught himself before touching him. “Really? Because you seem pretty agitated to me. I kinda think...” Oh, wow, he was really doing this. He was going to kiss Tony Stark, and judging by the sparks he was already feeling, it was going to be amazing. He mentally crossed his fingers. “I
Tony couldn't help leaning down to kiss him before turning and perching on his knees. It brought all his attention to his bruised ass, and he was suddenly kind of nervous, which he covered in his usual way. “I'm not so sure I'm buying this 'never had sex before this week' line you're pitching. You seem pretty- ah!” Steve had slid a hand between his thighs and Tony's ass, and now there was a finger pressing at a muscle that was tight but surprisingly accepting. “Mmph... Pretty sure of yourself. That's-” And the finger was pressing into him, probing, relaxing the muscle all over again... “That's some pretty advanced stuff you're doing...” He let himself sag, legs falling open, head and shoulders falling back against Steve's chest, pain transmuting to pleasure somehow. Steve made an approving noise and added another finger. “Ohhh... That's good...”
the time. “For instance, there's some other terms I found this week, that I think apply. I'm pretty damn sure I'm a Dom, and I think you might be a bit of a sub.”
Tony perked up a bit at the last question. “Oh, and there’s a brain behind that pretty face, excellent. As to why, well, I had to get very close to smell it on you. If no one else has got that close?” He raised his eyebrows and Steve shook his head. “Well, then. As to why the scent is so faint, well, I fear that my speculation may lead to a punch in the arm, so let’s move on. This Alpha, this friend of yours. Do you speak more of a servant helping his lord, or is this true and lasting love, and I only in the way of it?”
! Besides, I don't get viral or bacterial infections anymore.” He went back to fussing with the eggs. “No, I... I just... How much of, of last night and all of this, is because I'm, you know,
Tony pouted (though Bruce suspected it covered some fairly strong emotions). “See? Freaky!”
Steve sighed happily and fed some broccoli to Tony. “First picture you showed me when I moved in. Of course I'm fond of it.”
Steve stifled a yelp as he spun to face the presence that had been behind him. “My Lord Anthony!” He pressed a hand to his heart. “You startled me! Ah, yes, of course, anything you wish, sir.” He reached out as if to take Tony’s hand, but pulled back before he could complete the motion. “This way.” He slipped through the crowd like a fish through water, and Tony hung back a step or two just to admire his intended’s grace. Steve stopped in front of two serious-looking men in Brooklynn livery standing stiffly near the wall, and threw a nervous smile all around. “Duke Anthony, this is Captain James Barnes and Sergeant Samuel Wilson. Bucky, Sam, this is Tony, my husband to be.” Both men bowed and murmured a greeting.
Steve licked delicately at the underside of Tony's jock, enjoying the way his hips lurched upward. “Oh, I've only just begun.” He swirled his tongue around the seam between head and (now fully-hard) shaft, then dipped it into the spot from which pre-cum was starting to leak. Tony's hand clenched in his hair, and he whimpered. Steve closed his lips and slid all the way down Tony's shaft and back up. When he whimpered louder, Steve tried that a couple more times.
For the next one he used mostly blues, palest right in the middle, where the arc reactor was, darker along his arms and the underside of his chin, almost fiery deep in his eyes. He even added cobalt and deepest indigo in the shadows of his own hands, hinting at the bruises he'd just barely started leaving. He was just turning the page over again, imagining a scene he wanted to create, when JARVIS broke into his reverie. “Captain? Sir is on his way upstairs. If you were planning to meet him...”
He mimed being shot. “You wound me! Can't I just be happy, and share that joy with you, my faithful assistant-”
He barely noticed when he flipped to a fresh sheet, scrabbling in the pencil box til he found the right one, thinner, finer lines to capture the layers of innocence and mischief on Tony's face when his lips were stretched around Steve's jock, the way his hair fell so carelessly across his eyes. At some point, he sat down on the floor, under the window where the light was good, but the urge to create was on him now, and he hardly noticed anything else.
. I was thinking I could just order Chinese, and we can watch movies on the couch.” He gave Steve a shaky grin.
....? You know what, never mind. Yes, fine, Mr. Stark, I'll arrange that press conference for you, sir, will there be anything else?” She twisted her lip in a way that usually meant she was trying to frown to hide a smile.
Strange lowered his hands and opened his eyes, and Tony gave him a hopeful smile. Stephen shook his head sadly. “This curse has taken hold of you. There is nothing I can do for you, I’m sorry. But...” He frowned, looking annoyingly wizardly.
Steve looked outraged. “What, so to reassure me, you bring up your ex? I can't believe you would-” Without warning, he pounced, covering Tony's body with his own and kissing him like they were the only two people in the world. They started to rub up against each other, but then Steve's stomach rumbled, and he pulled back and sat up. “Much as, God, I would
, he let his eyes close and his head fall back, trying to adjust to... everything. After a moment, the need to squirm overpowered everything else, and he gave in to it. Steve gasped, and his hands flew up to clasp Tony's hips. Tony snapped his head down to look at Steve. “OK? Are you? Is this?” Wow, he could hardly form words...
exploding, and he felt as though he was turned inside out and washed perfectly clean.
Tony was already starting to float away a little. The burn of being stretched wide was the same high-proof mix of pleasure and pain and just plain
Tony tried to laugh, but he was pretty sure it came out kinda wrong. “Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. Just a lot on my mind. Genius and all, remember?”
Tony nuzzled closer, then lifted his head from Steve's shoulder to peer at his face. “Hey, you have any plans for today?”
Which is why it was such a surprise when his orgasm hit. It exploded from his belly like a Jericho, sweeping him under in a wave of white heat. He felt breathless, storm-tossed. He was also distantly aware of Captain's hips jerking raggedly upward, and warm drops hitting his back. And then he was aware of nothing at all for a long, blissful moment.
paying that much attention.
Tony flopped onto the bed, half-upright against the headboard, and started pulling things out of the bag, lining them up on the duvet in front of him; it was mostly the cheap aluminium containers that reminded Steve of nothing so much as pie tins. Steve sat warily, on the other side of the containers, watching him. Tony shrugged. “Well, technically it gets delivered downstairs, and one of the staff brings it up and leaves it on that table.” He cocked his head thoughtfully. “Of course, I haven't even ordered from them in months-” he raised an eyebrow “-including this weekend. JARVIS, did you do this?”
Steve knew his team well enough to know they would all be awake and hungry soon enough, so he adapted his plans to that, and got out a whole rasher of bacon, and an 18-pack of eggs (such luxury, meat
Thor nodded, but he also frowned even more deeply. “And here on Midgard there must be a special name for this? And an announcement? On Asgard it is the way of things... One may take any lover, without regard for gender or even species. Indeed, I have shared pleasure with male and female, Asgardian and dwarf...” He paused and chuckled. “And, just the once, a centaur...” He gave a happy sigh.
Huzzah! I've finished something, so you get a Christmas present, my lovelies!
“God, how are you so perfect?” Tony gave him a sticky kiss, then fed him maple-dipped bacon, and if Steve licked his fingers a little too, well, nobody really minded that...
Steve thought about it for about two seconds. “Honestly, that sounds pretty great to me.” Plus, it would hold off the worry about reporters for a little longer. And then there was the other part... Would it be pushing-? He
She started to wave the screen away, then paused. “You too, Steve. Oh, and Steve? If he breaks your heart, let me know, I'll help you plot his painful demise.” He was startled into a laugh, and when the call ended he thought maybe he had another to add to his funny little family.
“God yes.” Steve kissed his ear, then down his throat, while his hands shifted to Tony's thighs. He lifted and pulled, and Tony automatically lifted his calves and hooked his ankles together around Steve's back. Steve turned and strode toward Tony's bedroom. Well, it was more of a stagger, really, as the motion caused their cocks to rub against each other in the most amazing, distracting way.
Steve knew he was bright red as the elevator started moving, and he found that he didn't have a single thing to say, but after a moment, Tony took pity on him (or just couldn't help himself) and started rambling. “So, it's not much of a plan, but I figured, my favorite deli's up near Bloomie's, we can pick up some subs and take them to The Park, and then just walk down 5th to the museum. And we don't have to stick with the Rothko. There's the whole rest of the museum, we can totally go mock Warhol for being shallow and pretentious, or find an emerging artist to support, or-”
. Ohhh, he was
Tony shrugged and leaned against the wall of the elevator as they descended. “Enh. I was thinking, Clint keeps bugging me about crazy trick arrows, maybe I'd mock up some prototypes of some of them, we can see if they actually work in the field.” He strolled out of the elevator and over to the workshop door, punching in his code. “You might as well make us some coffee. Machine's over there.” He gestured vaguely, his mind already on fuel ratios and specific densities. Within moments, the air was full of the scent of brewing coffee and the sound of pencils moving on paper. The cup of coffee that appeared at his elbow was perfect, just the way he took it, and something in his spirit settled, letting his mind roam free.
Steve smiled fondly down at him. “Do you need me to carry you downstairs?”
all that spunk in there with him, making the whole situation slicker and hotter and... “Just gonna fill you up... Make you ride my jock all night, til you're so full of my cum you can't even move...” God, the
He covered it up with an exaggerated sigh. “I tell ya one thing, though. I really, seriously,
They spent a little while cleaning up, drinking ridiculous amounts of water, and generally getting back to themselves, then, as
The elevator pinged and let them out on the ground floor, and Steve smiled as they headed out, no longer arm in arm, but still close enough that their arms brushed against each other. “This is great. I mean, even if I hate it all, I'm glad you're taking me to get familiar with artists I missed, you know? It's thoughtful.”
Tony fluttered his eyelashes. “Aww, Cap, you say the sweetest things...” Steve laughed and kissed him again.
Nat grinned too. “Ooh, we should have buttons. Or shirts? I could rock a 'Bi and Proud' shirt...”
Pepper made a strangled sound. “No, Tony. You may have made some mistakes, everyone does, but you have done so much, for all of us, for the world… You have more than apologized, I promise. And I… Oh, God, I’m going to miss you so much!” She lurched forward, throwing her arms around his neck and pressing her cheek to his. “I swear this company will always do you proud.” She pulled herself back and turned away, wiping at her eyes.
Steve sat up and grinned. “I definitely like this plan. Show me more of this rich man's life you lead.”
to use the Internet, but I don't always think about
“Oh, pet, I do like it when you beg.” He decided to alternate sensations, and to start with the one that seemed the most intimidating, so he picked up the carpet beater and positioned himself for a good swing. He gave two smacks on each ass cheek very lightly, one-two, one-two, aiming to spread them out a bit, then a second set with a bit more force, and a third set hard enough that Tony yelped and jumped. Then he set the implement down and rested his left hand on the small of Tony's back.
Steve sprawled out on his back, feeling utterly boneless. He was a little surprised at how much he'd liked spanking someone. (Be fair, Tony
Steve, already stepping through the bedroom doorway, paused, then hurried in so he wouldn't have to look at Tony. “I, ah... There is no 'rest'. This is everything.” He opened Tony's (frankly massive) closet, and saw that it was nearly full of really awfully nice suits. Feeling slightly ashamed, and bothered by it, he made quick work of hanging the garment bag and dropping the duffel bags on the floor of the closet. He set the knapsack down more gently, but still in a corner, out of the way.
be negative reactions, but there would be more that were positive, and the negativity would blow out like a hurricane making landfall. Really, truly, no one would care that he was “with” a fella, and he put on a burst of speed as his excitement and joy bubbled up again. Screw it, he had every right to be giddy about this date!
Of course, Steve was always adorable watching Disney movies, and pretty soon Tony was watching him way more than a movie he'd seen a hundred times already. The way the light moved over his face, the way his expression changed with every emotion... Tony told himself he could be happy just like this forever. The team, all hanging out together, Steve close but not too close, not risky close, and if Tony was out to the world, well, he could start picking up men as well as women when he was out on the town. He would just have to be very careful to never go for tall, built blonds. He could do that. The first minute he realized he was interested in Pepper, he'd taken leggy redheads off the tasting menu, and he'd stuck to that pretty well to this day. (The only exception being Nat, back when she was posing as his PA, and no one could blame him for that. I mean, seriously. Nat. He got a free pass on that one.)
Rhodey was peering at him a little, clearly suspicious. “And still I can't help feeling there was something in
! You two are together! When the hell did that happen?”
Tony's voice was low and rough. “Oh, God, yes, fill me, feels so good, please, more, deeper...” And Steve tried his best, stretching his fingers wide to stretch Tony out, exploring as deep as he could... “Please, yes, ok, god, that's good, that's better than good, that's enough...” Steve could barely understand, lost in a haze of lust, but he felt Tony pull away a little, and so he started to pull his fingers back. Were they done? Was this the next step? What-? Tony's head lifted, and Steve met his eyes, those dark eyes even darker now, but with white-hot fire deep within. “Enough fingers. I need the real thing. I- ohhhh” Steve pulled his fingers out, quickly at first, until the sensation shot right to his jock again, and he nearly went off,
When he turned, Tony was leaning in the doorway, looking disbelieving. “What, seriously? Everything you own fits into little enough luggage that
Tony seemed to feel about the same. “Steve. I want to.... Oooh, I promise I want to be a gentleman, and take you out to a restaurant where they'll make us wear ties, but right now I need... Oh, I need you.... Please... Bed. Bedroom. Can we-” Steve's hands were moving automatically, scooping Tony up to carry him so they didn't have to stop kissing. He was amazingly glad of his enhanced balance, what with the distraction of his jock, brushing against Tony's ass with every step, and Tony's jock, a hot stripe across his stomach. Oh, good God, and now Tony was biting his neck, and how could biting possibly be that sexy? Was Tony talking? “So hot. Seriously, you, doing this, might just be the hottest thing ever. But don't hold me to that, the night is yo-oh.”
Countess Sarah gave a proper little sniff. “I think you’ll find, my Lord, that our son is stronger than he looks.”
Tony yelled and knocked the hand away, scrambling backward in the pre-dawn gloom of his bedroom, distantly relieved that he could even move.
Steve tried to remember what words were. “Good. It's good. You're... Oh, God, you feel so damn good... You're so warm, so hot, so tight... Please, will you, can you...” He ran out, and tried to use his hands to show what he meant. Fortunately, Tony got it, and started to move in earnest. Steve felt like his whole body was burning up, a bonfire building to a forest fire low in his belly. Tony's hips under his hands were his only anchor to the world- He exploded. His entire body turned inside out and burst out of his jock, leaving nothing but blissful fog behind.
, in the open air! He was actually going on a real, actual, proper date! Finally, after a lifetime of waiting... He felt a little silly, twenty four years old (or ninety two, but who's counting?) and excited about a first date, especially when they'd already been having mind-blowing sex for, God, was it really only a week? Should he be worried about how gone he already was for the genius?
He was treated to a dizzying view for a moment as Rhodey waved both hands around. “No. No, I want no details whatsoever. I mean, obviously I'm very happy for you, but I don't need to know about the existence of certain people's love lives, much less all the dirty things I'm sure you get up to with- Oh, God, I'm never going to be able to look at him the same way, dammit Tony!” He brought the phone back to his face so he could give Tony a hairy eyeball. “You. You are a bad influence on everyone around you, and I don't know whether to be horrified or proud. Also, on behalf of the American people, if you break his heart, I will break every bone in your legs and leave you to your fangirls.” He sighed and grinned fondly. “That said, I really am happy for you. And I'll watch the press conference, I promise. But now I'm going back to sleep. Good night, Tony.” He hung up before Tony could respond, but Tony was pretty pleased with the conversation anyway.
Steve was wrung out, pliable, almost dazed, by the time Tony steered him out the doors (he didn't even notice the sculpture garden!) and hailed them a cab. He sagged back in the seat as Tony gave the cabbie an address, then blinked and seemed to come back to himself. “I... Wow. That was... There's been so much...” He stroked the cover of the sketchbook.
Steve was content to let Tony steer him up the stairs and into the bedroom, where he leaned in the doorway and watched Tony bustle around, shifting armloads of fabric from drawer to drawer until a whole column was empty and standing slightly open. In the midst of it, Tony glanced at him out of the corner of his eye. “I really do want to get you more clothes, you know, nice clothes. You've got an amazing body, you should be showing it off more. And I can clear out more space for you whenever you need it.” He moved on to shifting things around on the top of the dresser.
Pepper's eyes popped open, and her jaw dropped. “Steve?! Tony's sleeping with
The next time everyone was gathered for dinner, Steve knew he had to do it. No matter how much his heart was pounding, or his breath coming short. He downed his beer, hoping it would help, then, when everyone was suddenly staring, blurted it out. “So, I learned a new term this week, and I think it applies to me. Bisexual.” He snagged the nearest beer and downed that, too. Had his heart stopped, just for a moment? Oh, god, please don't anyone freak out...
Tony jolted in his seat when he heard Patrick Stewart. King Richard already? Wow, did he need to get his head on straight... Pun once again fully intended. Not tonight, this was a team night, but maybe in a few days he'd go down to the Village, go to a club, pick up some pretty twink and have his way with him. That'd clear his head, right? Robin fumbling with Marion's chastity belt did nothing to help his frame of mind, but at least it meant that the movie was over, and everyone was collecting themselves and wandering down the hall to their bedrooms. Thor and Clint were debating cheerfully over some detail, but Tony couldn't care less. He barely managed a civilized goodnight before he fled upstairs to his own suite.
Tony's tone aimed for casual but ended up kind of dismissive. “Yeah, but not nearly as much as I used to.” Steve's frown deepened, and Tony's shoulders tightened. “Look, I've got it under control, and knowing you you'll notice if I don't, so can we not do this, please, Captain Grandma?”
“Oh, God, yes, fill me, feels so good, please, more, deeper...” Holy crap. Tony knew he could say some dirty things in bed, but this was so much more. He needed so much more... “Please, yes, ok, god, that's good, that's better than good, that's enough...” Steve paused, withdrew a little, and Tony managed to raise his head, and look at his face. He was sure Steve's expression mirrored his, wild with lust and need. He licked suddenly-dry lips. “Enough fingers. I need the real thing. I- ohhhh” Steve drew his fingers out slowly, almost teasingly, as Tony pushed himself upright.
*A*A*
The kiss was good, so incredibly good, but Steve had
“No.” Tony had to cut him off. “No, nothing like that, it was probably overdue for me to come out, I really do want to tell the whole world, and all that. I just...” He tried to come up with an excuse, but Steve was standing
Tony beamed at him. “Moved in less than ten minutes and already ordering the robot butler around. I'll make a rich man of you yet.” He leaned over and took a bite from the egg roll still in Steve's hand, and they spent most of the picture feeding each other bites from their chopsticks, then, later, from their fingers... and directly from one set of lips to the other. Steve was amazed to find that something could be both romantic and deeply erotic at the same time.
Tony was glad of his years of experience with formal events, as it meant he could navigate this one by rote, greeting nobles and courtiers as if they were long lost friends, rather than the leeches and vultures he knew them to be. His mind was not on any of that, though, but on the Omega he had left upstairs. For such a small person, his scent was surprisingly robust, cinnamon and clove and nutmeg, and Tony had honestly only been seeking a deeper taste of it when he’d discovered… the other thing. That was the part he was hung up on, as he supposed he should be, but not for the reasons others might assume. He was an Alpha, and his promised mate, the Omega that would be

“Tony...”
surprised at how very much
to share with
In a related note, yes, there will be a press conference. And you know the reporters will have stupid questions for one or all of them. In fact, if you know a stupid question they might ask, please leave it in a comment, or send me a message. If I like it, and/or can think of a funny answer, I might use it when that bit comes around.
Tony nodded reluctantly. “If we must.” His eyes started to gleam. “Hmm, you know, I think we'll need eggs and bacon, to fuel more escapades later....” He clambered out of bed, doing his best to ignore both the erections demanding his attention, and dug in the dresser for sweatpants and t-shirts, then tossed one set at Steve and put on the other set. “The shirt might be a bit small, and half the team will probably figure out that you slept up here just by what you're wearing, but if I let you go down there naked, then Thor will think it's ok to walk around naked, and I so do not need that image in my brain.”
He felt it building, one last, glorious moment, but his artwork was not quite complete. He curled down to murmur into Tony's ear. “
Tony bounced to his feet, then staggered a little as his fresh contusions made themselves known. “You always need food.” He tried to look stern, failed, and shrugged. “Lunch sounds excellent. And I made sure to get enough for leftovers, I knew we'd want them.” He walked gingerly toward the door.

Marco pulled out a tape measure, but Steve was just gaping at Tony. “A tuxedo? I mean, I know I said-”
as sitting on his bruises, and now Steve's hands were leaving his hips to roam over his thighs, his belly and chest... It would almost be soothing, except that every place where Steve's skin touched his felt like it had been lit on fire. He became aware that he was whimpering and writhing in Steve's lap, but Steve was making encouraging noises, so that was alright. (Encouraging! HA! Those were the sexiest fucking noises Tony had ever heard, little gasps and moans, stifled as if the only other option was to blow out Tony's eardrums. A thought darted through the fog, that he would be happy to be rendered deaf if the last thing he heard was Steve's full-throated sex noises. Definitely floating away now...)
Something in Steve's demeanor changed, sharpened, and he got up and
Steve pressed his chest to Tony's back, resting a hand lightly on his hip, just rubbing little circles with his thumb. “Can what? Forget about it? Ignore this and let you try to deal with your misery alone? Do you think I'm the sort of person to do that?” He kissed gently at Tony's hair.
Steve straightened up, got a grip on Tony's hips, slid his jock most of the way out, and slammed it back in again just as roughly as he wanted to. He grunted, and Tony groaned. He did it again, a slow slide out and a harsh thrust back in, and Tony arched up and back, into him, every line of his body begging. Steve lost his mind a little at this point, his body taking over, driving deep into the willing heat that surrounded him, pounding in with frantic need. The orgasm that crashed over him broke his rhythm, but only for a moment, before lust drove him onward, inward, as if he could climb entirely inside Tony.
He flinched a little. Oh, no, was she sore? Had he broken some code by not asking her first? Stall for time, Rogers!  “Excuse me?”
Steve lifted his chin out of the way. “Mmm, yeah... Wait, no.” He stepped back a little. “You are a very tempting man, Tony Stark, but we both need food, and then I'm pretty sure you have a job to go to.” He turned to the door, but held out his hand. Tony took it, feeling like a teenager, and let himself be led down the stairs to the communal kitchen.
big favor from me. You're not dying, are you?”
Tony shifted, hovering his ass over Steve's cock, and reached down with one hand to grasp it and guide it in. He made a pleased noise when he noticed that Steve had thoughtfully lubed it up, too. As the head of Steve's cock pressed against his entrance, he locked eyes with him, then let himself sink down. His eyes widened with the nearly overwhelming combination of pain and pleasure as it seemed like his entire lower half was stretching around a behemoth, but he kept his gaze locked on Steve's; peripherally, he was aware of both of them panting with leashed desire, and he wanted
He cleared his throat, but Tony didn't seem to notice. “Tony?” He jumped, and turned wide-eyed to look at Steve. “Sorry, did I startle you?”
Ironically, days 3 through 5 were kind of awesome. He’d woken up without the urge to pee, since his bladder had apparently turned to marble overnight, and he spent a blissful few days with less and less of a need to eat, or really even sleep. The unfortunate trade-off to that, of course, being that his every waking hour was spent preparing for what came next. There was also the imponderable mystery of why the arc reactor hadn’t changed, even as the stonework inched up over it.
Thor gestured broadly from the other armchair. “Indeed, friend Clint, I am always eager to hear your renditions of the tales of Midgard.”
Even JARVIS sounded happy for him. “She's just finished up with a conference call, Sir. Shall I put you through?”
!?” She started to picture it, and had to shake her head sharply before she got some completely inappropriate images in her head. “Wow, I- He- Good for him. Really. I just... Steve.” An absolutely horrific thought occurred to her, and her head snapped around to look at JARVIS' camera in the corner. “Oh, God, he's not, like, going to make out with Steve on national tv, or propose to him, or anything like that, is he?”
When he pulled the finger most of the way out, Tony felt a moment of disappointment, but then there were
Steve knew the noise he made this time should have been embarrassing, but he was picturing it, Iron Man using... was that a bull-whip? On him, and that was taking pretty much all of his attention. “Yeah.” His voice was definitely hoarse. “Yeah, I like that idea.” He shifted a bit, trying to ease the growing pressure on his jock, and his empty stomach made itself known. “Right now, though, I think we need lunch. Are there Chinese leftovers?”
Well, if the single-tail whip wasn't a good idea, this multi-tailed one might not be either, but better to know that sooner... He swung it, and was surprised to see how much the tails spread out across both buttocks. Tony reacted much better to it, too, grunting in interest and rocking into it a little. Steve upped the intensity a little for the next three, then again for the next set-of-four. Deciding to push it, he really put his arm into the last set. Then he lowered his arm and put the other hand on Tony's back.
always talking, but Thor was much louder. Steve's first real clue was one night, when he was making dinner, and he realized that he was hoping awful hard that Bruce would drag Tony out of the labs tonight. Somehow, it had become the highlight of his day, that moment when Tony showed up in the kitchen doorway.
that made you decide to do this just now...”
Steve smiled back. “You know I will. Have a good day, Pepper.”
*A*A*
She rolled her eyes. “Boss. Technically, since I'm the CEO, and you're just a department head, I'm your boss now.”
Tony laughed and climbed into his lap. “Well, I am dirty. Utterly filthy, even.” He demonstrated with a kiss that should have set the sheets on fire.
Overall, Tony knew the blows were getting harder as they went. He was also vaguely aware that there were different types, cupped palm vs flat, sometimes the edge of the hand or the fist, but after the first few it all registered as
still, and just breathe... Tony was clearly impatient, pushing up against his palm, and Steve closed his eyes, refocused, and concentrated on exploring Tony's most private place, learning the shape and the feel of it... When his finger was sliding easily in and out, he withdrew it almost completely, then gently added a second finger. This was tougher, until Steve remembered the lubricant in his other hand. He squeezed out another drop, guiding it with his knuckles, and, OH! His fingers were delving deep, and he could feel every clench and flex of Tony's body, every gasp and whimper as Steve opened him wider and wider...
Steve rumbled happily, and took the cake plate from him. “Cake for breakfast? You're so decadent.” He scooted up against the headboard.
Tony licked his lips, buying time. Really, no one had ever asked him like that, like he was allowed to give his own answer instead of what they expected to hear. “I-” Why was it so hard to breathe? The worst he could do was say no, right? It would be ok, c'mon Stark, you can do this... “I want you. I want to date you, I want this-” he gestured to their naked bodies “-all the time, god, I want to take out billboards and tv ads telling the whole damn world that we're together. I want anything you'll give me!” He was gasping and, greatly daring, he pressed his face to Steve's chest, sucking in the scent of sweat and sex. “I know I'm going to fuck it up, and I'm already sorry, you can quote me on that later, but if you'll let me, I want to try in the meantime.”
Oh, Tony
She rolled her eyes and deliberately turned away from him. “Clint's right, Bruce. I think the extra cumin really balances it well. Maybe next time marinade it longer?”
When he came back to himself, the credits were just ending. He rolled his neck to kiss sloppily at Steve's jaw. “You know, I think I might be pretty fond of this movie too...”
Tony rolled his eyes, but he grinned back. “I think a course of private study could be arranged. But not when there are Jedi. Get up here.” Tony lifted his head up just enough that Steve could sit, and then Tony put his head on Steve's thigh, resolutely facing away from the massive hard-on he didn't have the energy to do anything about. Steve started running his hand through Tony's hair, and it was incredibly soothing, especially combined with a well-loved movie and a well-loved body. (He was massively sore, but in a
Bruce took a couple of steps closer, keeping his voice low and soothing. “I’m sure we can figure it out. Can you be more specific than ‘freaky’?”
Tony grinned nervously. “Well, it's just... I'm, ah, holding a press conference. On Thursday. Which is, you know, the eleventh...” Rhodey gave him a squinty look of confusion and impatience, and Tony fidgeted. “You know, Keith Haring Day?” He waggled his eyebrows significantly.
a drink since you kissed me!”
Stephen sighed. “There is one last possibility. But the chances are so slim...”
And now he was thinking about
Tony affected a long-suffering air. “Yes, grandma.”
, Tony?” Tony lifted his head and gave a wicked grin, but before he could respond, Clint waved both hands. “No, no, I do not want a single solitary detail. Besides, check this out!” He flopped down on the sofa. Nat went and sat next to him, and Steve sat in the armchair closer to them, settling Tony on his lap sideways. (Being very careful of all his new injuries, of course.)
Because he knew, if he stopped for more than two seconds, his mind would tumble into a morass of sorrow and regret, a catalog of all the reasons he had these days to stay. He wouldn’t admit it aloud, even now, but he loved these people fiercely, and he had had plans, dammit! Science to do with Bruce, a million questions to ask Thor, pranks with Clint, being catty at galas with Natasha… The many, many, dirty, naughty things he wanted to do with Steve… (Yeah, alright, America’s Golden Boy was as straight as one of Clint’s arrows, and wouldn’t be interested in someone as blood-soaked as Tony even if he wasn’t, but a former Merchant of Death could dream, couldn’t he?)
Steve flopped down in the middle of the big couch. “I think Clint said something about Robin Hood? That sounds pretty good to me...”
did not think about the moment, every time, when Steve would catch sight of them (him? Could it possibly be him?) and break out his own beaming grin.
They were in the bedroom now, and wearing far too many clothes. Steve needed to touch Tony, taste his skin... take his own shirt off? Why was Tony pulling away? Was he...
“Oh. Well, then.” Tony tried not to let his disappointment show. The night didn't have to be completely over yet, right? “I guess we can-”
Steve chuckled, loving this oh-so-subtle exercise of power, making
*A*A*
Tony smirked. “So if I get you to move in here, does that mean you'll make me breakfast every day?” His barely-awake brain caught up with his mouth, and his whole body tensed. “Um. I, ah, don't have to have said that. If, ah. I mean, I know we're probably already moving awfully fast for you, we haven't even had a real date, we can take this at your pace-”
Nat just rolled her eyes a bit. “And here I was actually going to get him to eat some breakfast. Thanks, you two.” She patted them both on the head and set about making two mugs of coffee.
Steve didn't actually need to work out to maintain his muscles, the Serum took care of that. But he did get restless, itchy under the skin, if he didn't keep active enough. So once Tony had gone down to the public levels, Steve went down one level to the team gym, and started his usual routine: ten klicks on the treadmill, a full circuit on the weight machines SHIELD had specially designed for him, a round of push-ups, sit-ups, and other isometric exercises, and then working out with his special heavy bag until his muscles really started to burn.
Tony forced himself to break away again. “Steve. I want to.... Oooh, I promise I want to be a gentleman, and take you out to a restaurant where they'll make us wear ties, but right now I need... Oh, I need you.... Please... Bed. Bedroom. Can we-”
He could tell it had been fantastic just from his face? Well, he supposed he was grinning pretty wide. He squelched the grin, but that just redirected the mischief. “And what exactly is wrong with fantastic sex? Should I be ashamed of being a healthy adult with a sex drive?” Oh, how he loved to wind Clint up. He always had the best reactions... “I thought Americans, in the 21st century, would be more enlightened than that.” Like that. He couldn't keep the laughter in any longer. “Oh, your
Clint snorted. “Nah, there's only one good answer to this. JARVIS, Disney, and then Mel Brooks.” Nat cheered and pulled him down onto the smaller couch, and Thor laid claim to the other armchair, leaving Tony nowhere but next to Steve on the big couch. He could do this. He could be the cool buddy. He would not screw everything up. He focused on settling into his seat without encroaching on Steve's personal space as JARVIS dimmed the lights, and soon they were all singing along to “oo-da-lally, oo-da-lally, golly what a day.”
As the laughter died down, Tony looked around without meeting anyone's eyes. “Though I have been thinking about something. It's the end of September, right? So... National Coming Out Day is in just a couple of weeks. I'm thinking, press conference, big announcement, et cetera, et cetera. I can do it alone if you guys don't want to-”
- calluses...) slid into him, all the way to the knuckle in one smooth move. Steve cried out, mostly in surprise, and tried very hard not to clench hard enough to break Tony's finger. He knew those muscles were fluttering anyway. “Ohh, fuck, Tony, that's amazing. God, I-” He panted, adjusting to this whole new world of sensation. “I, yes, go...” Fortunately, Tony  interpreted  that correctly, and started to move the finger, shallow thrusts in and out, twists back and forth... Steve became aware that he was making a low noise somewhere between a groan and a whine, and clenching his thighs rhythmically. “More, I, I'm good for more...”
Tony couldn’t help a laugh. “No, sir, I know my way around an Omega’s bed. I have been thinking of his security, though, after the wedding and the bedding.” Had to play this right, make sure it was framed in terms Howard would appreciate. “Surely we don’t want to devote too many of our own people to such things? But his own Guard, who have come with him, and would have no purpose back in Brooklynn? Perhaps one or two of them might stay...” He risked a glance at Howard’s face, trying to read his thoughts on the matter.
*A*A*
She warmed all the way back up, past her usual friendliness, to a welcoming smile. “Alright, then. I'll tell him to tone it down for a couple weeks, and I'll get working on that press conference. I know I don't have to tell you to watch out for him.”
way. Like he was there for Steve's pleasure, to be stretched wide and fucked silly whenever Steve wanted, which was a way hotter thought than he would have expected.) He dozed, mumbling most of the lines with the characters but not
*A*A*
Steve clutched the towel closer around himself. “Who are you? What are you doing in here?”
Steve gave him a raised eyebrow as he finished chewing a chunk of melon. “Of course I do. Isn't he?”
Of course, being bitten just made Tony make a keen of pure pleasure, almost a shriek of surprise, and even if Steve hadn't been close, he was pretty sure that noise would have driven him to orgasm anyway. His hips snapped up, lifting them both off the sofa, as his world whited out. When he came back to himself a little, he realized he was licking the swiftly-forming tooth-shaped hickey in front of him. He shifted to nuzzling the back of Tony's head, inhaling the scent of shampoo and sweat and
Tony blinked a few more times, and mustered up a smile. “I'm here. I- Hi. Did I wake you?”
Steve had, in fact, taken the time while Tony was processing to finish dressing. “Well, I don't know that I think much of her as a girlfriend if that's the way she reacted. Are you going to finish getting dressed, or are we going downstairs like this? 'Cause I'm pretty sure if Clint sees this, he'll have something to say.” Tony shivered at the thought, and finished putting his jeans on.
Tony laughed. “Pretty sure that was my social set. So very sorry the ultra-rich have nothing better to do with our time than breed increasingly tiny pets. Probably should have gone for that solving world hunger thing first, eh?” He took an ostentatiously large bite of his sandwich, just to watch Steve roll his eyes and try to suppress his grin.
But when he got to the top of the stairs, instead of turning left toward his bedroom, as he intended, he turned right, into the living room. His feet took him directly to the bar, where he snagged the nearest decanter and glass, and poured a couple fingers of amber liquid. He tossed it back, centering himself on the burn in the back of his throat, then refilled the tumbler and wandered over toward the window. He pressed his overheated forehead to the cool glass, and stared out unseeing at the city. This was no good. There was no way he'd be able to work with Steve like this. He would just end up embarrassing himself. He needed a vacation, maybe. A week or two on some tropical island, seducing golden-tanned cabana boys, yeah, that'd clear his head...
“No.”
Stephen shook his head. “Unlikely, but yet on the list of possibilities I will investigate. Stark, I will contact you as soon as I may.” He waved his arms again, making a portal, and disappeared through it.
She smiled, and nodded approvingly. “Alright, then. I'll tell him to tone it down for a couple weeks, and I'll get working on that press conference. I know I don't have to tell you to watch out for him.”
? You're a virgin?”
Steve's hands flexed, pinning him in place. “No, hold on, just give me a minute...” He panted for breath for a moment, then ran his hands down Tony's thighs, up across his pecs, around the edges of the arc reactor...
*A*A*
Steve kissed him again, then pulled back, eyes twinkling. “I would love to move in with you, if you actually meant it. I- I would be honored.” His smile softened for a minute, then turned wicked. “But I'm not going to make you breakfast every single morning. Just because we're living together doesn't mean I'm a good little housewife.”
Inwardly grinning, Steve closed his teeth gently around the base of Tony's jock, and Tony went perfectly, tremblingly still. Steve, ever so slowly and just hard enough for Tony to really feel it, dragged his teeth up the length of Tony's shaft, his lips gliding along in their wake. Tony was making high, needy little noises, all of his muscles clenching and flexing without actually moving. Steve's teeth opened a little for the head of Tony's jock, then closed sharply a millimeter past it. Tony gasped and jumped, looking down at Steve with wide, wild eyes. Steve suspected that the grin he flashed out was positively evil, but he was having
Tony looked confused. “Never been with a guy?” Oh, God, was he going to have to explain? He could feel Tony pulling away. Oh, God, no... “Never been with
Tony laughed back. “Excellent strategizing, Rogers. See, this is why I-” Woah, hey mouth, this is brain, we are so not going there, thank you very much. “I keep you around. Because you plan ahead. But maybe save cooking the bacon for last?” He immediately busied himself with getting out more coffee mugs, and the sugar and cream and whatnot.
“Tony!” Steve sat bolt upright, staring at him. “Tony, it's ok, you're home, you're safe, it was just a dream, breathe, Tony, breathe!” Tony realized he was panting, his breaths shallow and shaky. He blinked a few times and ran a hand through his hair as he tried to get his bearings. “There you go, baby, you're ok now.” Steve gave him Smile Number 15, I'm Here For You, and laid his hand gently on Tony's knee.
Tony shut down his office for the day, picked up the box that had been sitting behind his chair all afternoon, then thought about the conversation he'd had with Pepper, and realized that he really should let Rhodey know what was coming up this week, just to save the poor man a heart attack. “Hey, JARVIS, put me through to Rhodey, would you?” JARVIS acknowledged, and a moment later the line was ringing.
When Tony finished cleaning his jock, he kissed it, and Steve felt a glow in his chest. He had to try... “Good pet.” More tension drained out of Tony, and Steve found he could barely keep his eyes open. “Sleep now?” He had just enough energy to wrap an arm around Tony and pull him close, before sleep pulled him under.
She managed to scare up a laugh. “Yes, please, JARVIS. And in the meantime, could you see if Steve is available?”
”. It seemed to focus on the 1960s and 70s, and as they wandered through, they learned how buildings in those tumultuous years had re-centered the people who lived in them and the work that they did. Tony was more than willing to dive deep into the cultural nuances of time and place for each of them, complete with witty asides and occasional reminiscing (aka gossip) about this architect or that photographer. Steve found he understood the upheaval and change far better through this concrete lens than he ever did from a SHIELD briefing, and, maybe more importantly, he discovered that he and Tony shared a passion for The Commons, for a space where anyone, rich or poor, young or old, could go to enjoy nature, or art, or music, or any of those things that made life worth living. He also ended up with another entry in his catch-up notebook, the name Frank Lloyd Wright, whom he was excited to learn more about.
When they had eaten everything in sight, Tony cleaned the bed by the simple expedient of dumping all the trash in the insulated bag, and tossing the bag in the direction of the door, then rolled onto his stomach and reached over the side of the bed to open The Drawer. He glanced over his shoulder. “So, I was thinking, easiest way to do this, give you a selection, right?” Steve was a little surprised at the abruptness, until he realized Tony had probably been thinking about this the whole time they ate. Tony's hand dipped down, then brought something up to lay beside him on the mattress, over and over. Steve automatically identified them (or tried to) as they came up: a cane, a paddle, something he thought might be a riding crop, a short whip, a thing like like the whip but with many tails...
Of course, he was also clearly going back to his default state of 'lost in thought'. “Yeah, dinner, good, see you then.” The connection cut abruptly, but Steve suspected he'd have to get used to that.
Steve gave a happy shiver, and said nipples perked up. “Oh, yeah, lots of sex. But Tony, pet, there's so much else...” Tony squirmed. He had so many thoughts and emotions happening he felt like he might explode. Steve set the cake aside, licked his hand clean (oh, and Tony wanted to be the one doing that... from the way Steve was watching him, he knew, too, the bastard), then reached around, caught him by the hair at the back of his skull, (so like and so unlike Obie grabbing his shoulder...) and pulled him around so they were face to face, Tony straddling Steve's thighs. “Hey, we're not going to do anything you don't want to, but let's talk it out, ok? Just be honest with me.”
The gym's screen-wall lit up. “Hey, babe. Ooh, sweaty. My favorite!” Tony grinned at him, and Steve grinned back. Tony pointed over Steve's shoulder. “And Barton. Don't make those vomit faces unless you want to vomit for a week. Hey Nat.” He waved a little, then refocused on Steve. “Anyway, MoMA's got this retrospective on Rothko right now, I was thinking, tomorrow, early lunch, all afternoon looking at art that will either bore us to tears or make us think crazy deep thoughts, late dinner? No fancy clothes required!” He waggled his eyebrows.
him, but with eyes sort of half-glazed, and in absolute silence. Tony was
Captain's left hand grabbed him by both wrists at once, at the same moment that his right hand came down across both ass cheeks. “No more thinking.” His wrists were pulled out, until he had to balance on his elbows instead, and then Captain's palm stilled over the wrists, pinning them in place. Captain's other hand smoothed over his ass and thighs. Tony shivered, and relaxed as best he could. “There you go, that's better.” Captain gave him one light smack on each ass cheek, and Tony twitched, working to convince his reflexes not to jump up and fight back. “Oh, you are going to have so many gorgeous bruises... All this tender skin...” The next smacks were harder, but not by much, and he moaned as sensation flooded through him, actually starting to understand the appeal of this part. “Alright, pet. Now, first and foremost, this is to see how much you can take, and what sorts of things you like, so I may just keep going until you yellow. Are you ok with that?”
threw at them. That sounded awful good to Steve. “You must vow to discuss your troubles with one another, lest they fester within and poison you, and then us.”
At some point, an assistant barely old enough to grow facial hair (but golly was he trying!) brought out a book of fabric swatches finer than anything Steve had ever owned before, in an array of colors, and showed them to Steve. He cast an uncertain look at Tony, who smiled at him and gave him a nod, as if to say 'go ahead', so Steve pored over the book, running reverent fingers over wools and silks he'd probably never have gotten to even touch without Tony in his life. He wanted Tony to be proud of him, pleased with his choices, and so he took his time selecting colors that worked well together, and that would compliment the colors Tony tended to wear.
Tony shrugged a little. “Nobody wants to deal with my misery, didn't figure you'd be any different.” He curled in on himself, away from the warmth and comfort he didn't dare let himself get used to. “Really, I was just going to go back to sleep, you should do the same.”
gesture very freely with his hands, which drew the eye, and he
Steve wanted it, wanted Tony's mark on him... “Mmm, yeah...” But dammit, he was the one in charge here, he had to be responsible. “Wait, no. You are a very tempting man, Tony Stark, but we both need food, and then I'm pretty sure you have a job to go to.” He saw his reluctance mirrored in Tony's face, but he stiffened his... spine, and took them both downstairs.
