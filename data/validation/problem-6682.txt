Tony's beautiful eyes were glassy as he nodded, dipping his head to brush his lips across Steve in a soft kiss. "It's okay, baby," he whispered. "I understand."
Tony shrugged, sweeping his hand along the row of machines. "Could be. This stuff's all used for processing blood samples and things like that, so—"
"Papa, are you okay?" Peter called as he landed on the debris-filled street. But he'd barely taken three steps towards his papa when the man JARVIS had identified as Dr Strange—who was for some reason wearing what looked like one of Uncle Thor's capes—went flying by, strapped to a large hunk of asphalt.
"Well…" Tony trailed off as he glanced at Bruce, who simply shrugged. "Based on the many-worlds interpretation, we can't just jump into another universe and start messing around, but we could potentially take a peek into those other universes in order to find the exact way of how we can win."
With a sort of half-smile, Carol hurried over to Ma, whose eyes were puffy and red-rimmed from crying. Steve had seen her down in the emergency department shortly before he was discharged, but after a few minutes he had asked her to return upstairs to be with Peter. Neither Steve nor Tony really trusted anyone else to care for him besides Ma and Sharon.
"Probably due to the extra weight," Steve said as he removed his helmet, letting it drop onto his lap. He should've realised that a lot earlier. "Are you all right?"
"I'm not sure the presence of the entire team is necessary, Director, if this is more of a diplomatic meeting than a true mission," Steve said as he squeezed Tony's hand, once again reading Tony's mind. "Would you concur?"
"Because we weren't a threat to him," said the antennae lady, who seemed to have finally decided that she was done jumping around like a freaking kid on a trampoline.
"My dad did have to go to work," he said, rather petulantly. "He didn't want to, but they didn't give him a choice. They never give him a choice."
"Gaahh!" Steve screamed as the third bag finally went flying, landing in a mess of spilled sand and shattered canvas. He stumbled forward, his breaths coming in short, stuttered gasps as he frantically glanced around the gym, searching for another punching bag.
"Please, honey," Tony pleaded. "The 1940s may have been good for some things, but not for stuff like this. In fact, they really freaking sucked for stuff like this."
"Master Peter is currently enjoying his third bowl of Lucky Charms in the kitchen, Captain," replied JARVIS. "However, Mr Stark is still asleep. Would you like me to wake him?"
“I got the call about thirty minutes ago,” she says, barely above a whisper.  “The dad said the kid specifically asked for the appointment with you because he recognised your name.”
And little did Tony know just what kind of rollercoaster they were stepping on. One that over four years later, still hadn't stopped.
"So, is this actually it, then?" Steve asked, his heart quickening as he watched Alt-Steve and his team rally behind Thor, invigorated by his arrival.
Tony tipped his head forward, thudding against Steve's collarbone as Steve's arms wound around his waist. "I'm just thinking, what if we're coming at this from the wrong direction?"
"Oh my God," Steve whispered, his hand clutching Tony's to the point of pain. "This Thanos… he killed Thor?"
"Mmm, well… he hasn't tried to steal any of your food, has he?" Tony asked. "'Cause if he has, then I'm gonna—"
Shrugging, Peter moved his knight, splitting two of Uncle Bucky's pawns. "It's okay. Girls are… complicated. Way too hard for me to figure out."
“Steve,” Steve says.  He tips Tony’s chin up to look at him.  “I’m not Captain America down here, right?  Not now.”
Peter inwardly rolled his eyes. "Am I always gonna need a bodyguard, though? I mean, I don't mind going places with them most of the time, but… well… Gwen and I, we'd kinda like to be able to—"
A second later a holographic map of the U.S. Eastern Seaboard appeared, the Compound, Tower, and D.C. buildings highlighted in red.
Tony's jaw was tightly clenched as he crept along the side of the massive spaceship, trying to make heads or tails of its design. The inner circle was still spinning, as he could sense the vibrations through his armoured feet, which likely meant that it was tied into both the ship's artificial gravity and the life support system.
He waited until Pepper had disappeared around the corner before placing his hand on the fancy doorknob, sucking in a deep breath.  He knew it wasn’t normal to want to avoid speaking with one of his highest-ranking employees, especially someone that he’d known his entire life.
And then, just as Peter felt like his lungs were about to explode, he suddenly heard words speaking directly into his mind, the very words that he had tried so hard to bury far, far down into the deepest recesses of his consciousness.
That plus the fact that lately it seemed like Uncle Thor was the only member of Peter's family who even remembered how strong he was, and let him use his strength, made him even more likely to want to listen to him. Uncle Thor never seemed to go out of his way to baby him, which Peter really, really appreciated.
It had been about a week or so after they had all returned to the Malibu house from Afghanistan. Peter had been helping Steve get accustomed to life in the twenty-first century, while Tony had been spending nearly all of his time down in his garage workshop, building the first of his eventual army of armoured suits and plotting his revenge on the Ten Rings. Steve and Peter had made dinner that evening, and, after practically dragging Tony upstairs to eat with them, Peter had then proceeded to beg him to watch a movie afterwards, telling him that he hadn't seen him more than a few minutes since they'd been back.
Rogers blinked, clearing his throat as he nodded, those intense eyes of his almost boring a hole through Tony's skull.
"Yeah, it was that book that I showed you," said Peter. "Your whole family is in it. The one that Ned asked you to autograph?"
"Oh, I'd be careful about that if I were you, Falcon," Papa warned. "Don't go getting your hopes up too high."
“No!” Steve cried as he bolted upright, panting and shivering and covered in sweat.  He glanced frantically around the area, confused as hell as to where he was, when he felt a pair of calloused hands gently take hold of his shoulders.
"We could all head out to Indiana for awhile," said Uncle Clint from his perch near the window. "I'm sure my sister-in-law wouldn't mind having some extra farm hands for a few days. You'd probably have to sleep in the barn though, the house isn't really all that big."
Reaching for the bag of homemade trail mix that he and Peter had made the day before and a bottle of Powerade, Steve shoved a handful into his mouth as he unzipped the special pocket that Tony sewed into his uniform, looking for the small sketchbook and pencil that he always carried with him. He opened it to the front page, to the sketch of Tony and Peter that he'd drawn from the very first photograph he'd ever taken of the two of them, only hours after Peter had taught him how to take pictures with his new phone. Steve's throat tightened as he examined it, which he attempted to remedy with a big sip of his Powerade. Even now, after taking literally thousands of photographs, and sketching and painting dozens of drawings, this little drawing was still one of Steve's very favourite sketches of his beloved husband and son.
"Tony, I said I understand." Steve cupped Tony's cheek in his free hand, pressing a soft kiss to his lips. "I'm not going to let anything happen that might hurt Peter, all right?"
And, based on what Carol explained whenever she touched base from her travels—which always seemed to be when Rhodey was around, now that Tony thought about it—none of the other planets in the universe were faring any better.
"Holy shit, that's so fucking sexy," Tony said on a gasp as Steve began kissing Tony's neck, working his way down to his chest to the mass of scars that decorated the skin over his sternum. During his recovery in Wakanda, Steve had asked Shuri to repair just about every single remnant left behind from the injuries that had led to Tony and Steve's fateful meeting, except for the scars created by the arc reactor. Steve had asked Tony's permission to leave them alone, of course, but even if Tony had wanted them removed, all it would've taken was one look at Steve's pleading blue eyes and he would have relented.
"Eh. I'm not as bad as I seem," Bucky said as they got to their feet. "Just don't tell anyone, okay?"
"Do you want me to call Helen?" Bruce asked Tony after he'd handed Steve a cold pack for his nose. "I mean, Peter seems like he's okay now, but—"
To his credit Tony did at least make an attempt to hide his eyeroll, although it was not entirely successful. "Ah huh. And how'd that turn out for ya there, hmm?"
Steve grinned then, a wide, toothy grin showing all of his perfect white teeth, and Tony literally felt his heart skip a beat.
"Hey, Dad!" Peter called as Dad finally landed a shot right below the Hammer suit's neck, sending it crashing towards the floor.
Which, Peter realised, he probably already was. He just tended to keep it tucked away better than Dad did.
But Tony pressed his fingers to Steve's lips, cutting off his self-deprecating rant. "Damnit, honey, when are you gonna realise that this team knows you better than you think? They all know what you're feeling, and even more so when you try so hard to hide it. And you know you can't hide anything from me, don't you?"
Tony wasn't sure how much time had passed before Steve finally moved again, his fingers still curled into Tony's hair as Tony dotted his hip and side with kisses.
“Yeah, Dad, I can do that,” Peter said softly.  “Just as long as you don’t freak out if Steve tries to kiss you or something.”
Bucky grinned, his eyes flicking over to Sam, who was sitting with several of their teammates. "Nah. Pretty sure Sam is though."
He also hadn't ever had a single original idea in his life. Pretty much everything Hammer Industries had ever produced was a knock-off of one of Tony's designs, such that Tony had even been forced to take him to court a few times over the years for apparent patent infringement.
Finally, just as Tony let out another pleading whimper Steve began to move, his lips brushing all across Tony's forehead and cheeks as his fingers skimmed down Tony's arm to intertwine with his, pressing their joined hands into the mattress. Tony's eyes fluttered closed as Steve's lips found a particularly sensitive spot on Tony's collarbone, sucking a mark into his skin as he snapped his hips forward with a loud groan.
“I’m not anything,” Steve cuts in.  “Well, nothing except late.”  He brings Tony’s hand to his cheek, closing his eyes as the realisation hits him like a blast to the chest.
"There you go," he murmured once the tie was properly in place. Then he picked up Peter's suit jacket, holding it out so he could slip it on and brushing his hands across the shoulders to smooth it out.
"That was so yummy. Thank you," Peter said once he was done, smacking his lips as he downed the last of his orange juice. The whole time he'd been eating, Grandma had sat in her chair across the room, a pair of glasses perched on her nose and reading a dog-eared novel. "But you didn't need to sit in here with me. I know you probably have a lot of other things that you'd rather be doing."
“Oh God!” Tony cried as he rushed over, barely catching himself before he grabbed onto Steve’s shoulder.  He stopped with his hand in mid-air, his heart nearly tearing in two when Steve let out a soft, frightened whimper.
Instead of answering, Steve twisted his fingers, finding the magic spot inside Tony that made the pleasure shoot so hard across his body that he felt he might short-circuit.
"But then you remembered that this was your first date in like, ever, and freaked out, right?" Bucky asked. He patted Steve on the back, grinning slyly. "It's okay, Steve. It happens to the best of us."
"Copy that," Natasha said as she headed for the door. A moment or so later Gwen Stacy appeared, rumpled and dishevelled with her face lined in tear tracks and her left arm wrapped up in a padded sling. Steve stood to his feet as she stepped inside, followed by her father, his hand resting protectively on her uninjured shoulder.
"So, I was thinking," he said as he pulled the truck back onto the street. "It's been awhile since we've had one of our coffee dates, so why don't we have one of them this morning, hmm?"
It was completely awesome, and Peter had a strong feeling that he’d just discovered his new favourite bookstore.
Pursing his lips, Bruce carefully covered him with a blanket as Tony's helmet retracted and he leaned over him, his face twisted in anger.
"Nope, I guess not," Tony said from where he was sprawled out on their bed, wearing only his fluffy bathrobe and looking thoroughly debauched. He let out a groan as he pushed himself up on his elbow, eyeing their closet warily. "S'pose that means I have to get dressed now, huh?"
"I didn't tell you 'cause I thought it would just make you sad!" Peter exclaimed, followed by such a junky coughing fit that Tony's heart almost dropped to his knees. He really had no business trying to get Peter upset.
And, because that apparently wasn't enough, both Dad and Papa had also been directly involved with the collection of evidence in preparation for Hank Pym's trial, as well as giving key personal testimony during the court-martial of General O'Brien and his lackeys.
As always, I can’t wait to hear what you think!  Got any theories about what’s going to happen next?  I’d love to hear them! 😊
A reality that really slammed home the day he received a phone call from a doctor at the hospital, telling him that a baby had been born earlier that night whose mother had named him as the father.
Brock is proof that Steve can no longer trust his ability to read people.  Steve was so enchanted by Brock’s bad-boy good looks and his smooth-talking charm that he quickly became blind to all of his flaws, unable to see just how awful Brock was until his sick Ma had to scream it at him over the phone one night.
"Then I will take him out!" yelled Thor, letting out an almost feral growl as Thanos drew closer. "And I, Thor Odinson, god of thunder, will finally have my revenge!"
"Okay, but I fail to see why we would need such a feature," said Rogers, a deep frown forming between his perfectly-shaped eyebrows. "Unless—"
Tony shook his head, forcing himself to not rise to the bait. He and Steve had had way too many arguments like this in the weeks since the attack at the lake. "No, I'll tell you what it tells us," he said through clenched teeth. "It tells us that HYDRA had your blood samples because you told me yourself that the SSR scientists practically bled you dry after your serum procedure, so there was probably enough of it to go around to every goddamn research lab in the world at the time. Now, I have little doubt in my mind that whatever they used to make the original Winter Soldier and the stuff that he ended up stealing from Howard was based on the serum in your blood, but you're acting like you personally did it yourself! You had absolutely no control over what those scientists did, and therefore have absolutely no reason to blame yourself! All you did was volunteer for a dangerous experiment because you wanted to help the U.S. win a goddamn war!"
He was just on the verge of sleep again himself when he heard Peter enter the lab, his jovial, "Hey!" to the guard bringing a soft smile to Steve's lips. How he had missed the sound of his son's voice!
"Pardon me if this seems out of place, Captain," O'Brien started, his voice dripping with false sincerity. "But there have been a few members of my parliament who have raised… I suppose 'concerns' would be too strong a word, but owing to the lack of a better one let's just go with that, shall we? They have raised…
And trying to come to grips with the fact that he was falling head-over-heels with none other than Steve Rogers, the man he'd always sworn up and down that he hated.
Steve dropped his chin to his chest, his fingers tightening around Tony's. "I'd really rather that he didn't, especially if something were to go wrong. But I'm not sure that I'm up for fighting with him over it either. He's been so distant lately, and I just…"
Instantly, Steve backed away, his entire body violently shaking as he watched Tony gather Peter into his arms, his eyes shooting darts in Steve’s direction as he cradled Peter’s left hand in his own, his pinky finger grotesquely bent and starting to swell.
"You two ready to go?" he asked as he looked between Sam and Bucky, both dressed in uniforms that Tony built for them. Tony had even managed to sandblast the red Soviet Union star off the upper part of Bucky's prosthetic arm, which now sported the same big
And right on the heels of those thoughts came the guilt. Peter had been planning on sitting his dads down the day after their anniversary dinner—that day—to tell them about the HYDRA files that he'd decoded. He had been hoping that they both would've been in a good enough mood to appreciate what he had done without getting too upset about the fact that he'd done all of it behind their backs.
"Tony got word that one of the defence drones fired about fifteen minutes before they were gonna leave to come pick you up, милая ошибка," said Auntie Nat. "And since JARVIS couldn't give them a concrete explanation of what the drone tried to fire at, Steve decided that they should go and check it out in person."
"He's already got three of the stones, guys, which makes him the most powerful creature in the universe," Bruce continued. "The Power Stone, the Mind Stone, and the Space Stone. The Space Stone was inside the Tesseract, just like Thor said. And Thanos just crushed it in his hand like it was nothing. Heimdall, Thor's guardian, was able to send me here just before the ship broke apart, but… guys, he's coming. Thanos knows there's another stone here, so he's on his way. And if we don't stop him, then—"
"It does not have to be right this very moment, Captain," T'Challa assured him. "Once the conflict is over will do just fine."
“Yeah, sure.”  Now that the confrontation was over and Obie was gone, Tony was starting to feel like he needed to do a bit of his own decompressing.  And if he was feeling that way, then Steve had to be feeling it a hundred times worse.  He gave Rhodey a quick hug, clapping him on the back.
Finally, after several minutes had passed and not one, but two Meridian pilots had been "scared the hell off" by some display of strength or valour or peacock feathers or whatever-the-hell else the Langaran pilots did up there while they were patrolling, Tony cleared his throat.
"Okay, so… you wanna tell me what's going on?" he sheepishly asked. "'Cause you seem to be kinda upset, and—"
"We're here, Tony," Natasha's low, raspy voice suddenly said from the secondary viewscreen as Barton strolled into view behind her, scratching at the back of his neck and yawning, looking like he'd just woken up from a nap.
"Thank you," he whispered once they broke apart, their foreheads pressed together. "And I'm sorry I've been such a jerk lately."
“All right,” Steve says evenly.  He twists the cap off the bottle, taking just a big enough sip to wash the lingering sour taste from his mouth.  Then he sets it down and looks at Tony, who’s still trying his best to avoid Steve’s gaze.
"Yes, I am," Howard said warily as he glanced at Pym, who was adamantly refusing to meet Howard's eyes. "But dare I say that I believe you knew that already, given that you're accompanied by my colleague here?"
"Tony!" Pepper exclaimed. "What has happened? Where's Steve, I thought it was your anniversary dinner tonight?"
Tony rolled his eyes. Leave it to Steve to still be worried about him while he was out in freaking space. "Yes, honey," he said. "Someone would have to get past eight separate people all carrying big-ass guns to get at me, so I'm fine."
"All right Bucky, go ahead and put on the glasses, and then just sit back and try and relax, all right?" They had decided a few days ago that Sam would be the one to verbalise the trigger words, thinking that he would be the person least likely to be viewed as a threat by the Winter Soldier.
And then before Steve could react, there was a flash of bright red light and suddenly Peter was there, dressed in all black and looking down at him with such malice in his big brown eyes that Steve's heart literally skipped a beat.
"Steve, I told you not to worry about that," Tony said with a sigh. "Rhodey's up there with him now, okay? He wanted to make sure that Pete heard what happened from one of us instead of someone who didn't know him."
"Well, that's actually what I came in here to tell you," said Natasha. "Thor got here about a half hour ago, and he's waiting to talk to us whenever you can break away for a few minutes."
“Nope, don't you even try to tell me that it doesn't mean anything,” Peter cuts in.  “Especially when I have never, not once, ever seen you look at
Steve clicked his heels together, offering the general a salute and wishing he had the courage to cross his fingers behind his back.
"Sure, thanks." The mint felt cool on Steve's tongue as he pushed himself up to his feet, giving him a slight burst of energy as he gathered up his cowl and shield. The five of them exited the jet to find Agent Maria Hill waiting for them, along with two men that Steve recognised from the SHIELD base up at the Compound.
"You didn't connect his oxygen properly before he went to sleep," Tony said, low and tight. "The hose—it wasn't fastened the way it was supposed to be, so when Pete moved in his sleep, he—he—" A single tear snaked its way down his cheek. "Oh gods, I can't lose him now. Not after—not after everything—oh gods
Steve hadn't been hit that hard since… well… not since the fight against Bucky, back when he was the Winter Soldier. And not even Bucky had packed that much of a wallop.
"Yes, I would agree," answered Dr Strange. He stepped to the side, indicating the spinning golden circle. "After you, Captain."
Steve stepped out of the bathroom then, proceeding to strip out of his clothes and into a pair of the loose pyjama pants that he usually wore to bed. Tony had gotten him a few new pairs for Christmas, including a pair designed after Tony's Iron Man armour which were Tony's new favourites. Steve always looked amazing in blue, but he looked pretty damn good in the Iron Man red too.
"Great!" said Steve. He stepped back three paces, nodding at Tony as he readied his shield. "Whenever you're ready, sweetheart."
"You're going bonkers, is what you're doing," Peter said. "And yeah, I know I'm not eighteen yet, like eighteen is some magical number when suddenly everything's gonna make sense or something, but I can still see that you're not good, Dad. And you haven't been good for a long time now, and it—it scares me. And it scares Papa too, he's just gotten better at hiding it."
“Um…” tearing his eyes away from Papa’s image, Peter checked the monitor.  “His heart and respiratory rates are elevated like he’s stressed, but other than that he’s okay.”
"That's true," said Steve. "But according to Peter, while you and I were hooked up to that drug, both of us were led to believe that the other was dead. So maybe this is just another version of that."
"Great idea, babe," Tony said as he landed about ten metres away from Thor, facing him and pointing to his arc reactor. "Thor, charge me up!"
"What exactly is this stuff?" Peter said as soon as he'd stepped into the hallway. He reached behind him, relieved to find his mask still attached to his suit.
Tony smiled. "Well, you'd be the perfect person for that." Then he pressed a soft, lingering kiss to Steve's lips, frowning at the bathroom door once he pulled away. "Don't you think Pete's been in there for awhile?"

"Peter!" Dad cried, his right foot planted firmly on the chest of a huge bald guy who was covered in weird tattoos. Dad's bottom lip was trembling, his face the same horrible ashen color that it'd been when he finally found Papa in the HYDRA bunker in Georgia, while Peter's knees were shaking so badly he was surprised he was still upright. With his arms firmly pinned to his sides, even if he could've tried to flip out of the guy's hold he likely wouldn't be able to get the blaster out of the way first, and while Peter knew that Dad's nanotechnology was as top-notch as it could get, he still wasn't sure if his mask would be able to withstand a point-blank shot from the guy's blaster.
Steve's heart was in his throat as he silently counted the seconds down, finally ordering Bucky and Thor to back off just as Thanos was about ten paces away. Less than a second later, Thanos raised his arm, the red Reality Stone glinting brightly in the gauntlet as the entire plain transformed into the same apocalyptic landscape as before, revealing the yellow Soul Stone glowing beneath the surface.
It was all so bizarre that it was almost impossible for Steve to wrap his mind around it, but at the moment, he didn't really care. Peter and the rest of their missing teammates were back, Thanos and his endless armies had been defeated, and after scaring Steve half to death—again, Tony was going to make a full recovery.
"Yeah, I think so," Tony said shortly as he scanned the blurry floor for his glasses, finally locating them about four metres away. They weren't broken, thank the gods. Tony did have a spare pair hiding somewhere between his office and the house, but finding both the time and the patience to look for them while at the same time not being able to see a single goddamn thing wasn't something he felt like doing at the moment.
After all, keeping over twenty million people content under martial law for the last twenty-eight years hadn't exactly been easy, but Tony had a strong feeling that it was going to be even harder for him to convince them to choose to give up their power, even if it meant the betterment of the entire planet.
"Yeah, well, right now you don't get a say in the matter," Tony said, probably a bit harsher than necessary when Steve frowned. He tugged on Steve's hand, halting him as they reached the living room. "Look. I just can't have you going somewhere without me being able to keep track of you." He paused, wincing. "Okay, that actually sounded kinda creepy, but you know what I mean. I can't—Steve, I just
Suddenly one of the largest missiles that Steve had ever seen appeared from somewhere off his left wing, hitting the enemy aircraft square on its underbelly barely a second before it would've impacted the nose of his X-302. Steve cried out in shock as he yanked hard on his stick, managing to avoid the worst of the resulting explosion just in time as he scanned the skies for the aircraft that had saved him.
Because no one should ever have to go through what he had gone through ever again, and if Peter had the chance to prevent it, that meant he also had the responsibility to do so. If he didn't, well, then it would be like letting the bad guys win, and everyone knew that the bad guys weren't ever supposed to win.
"Uhh, far as I know your girl's back in New York," Uncle Bucky said, obviously confused. "It's only her dad that came with us. Why?"
A loud knock on his door startled him, and he quickly slid on his glasses as he glanced up at the clock. It was nearly 2330, well past the curfew time, so—
"You know, Gwen, that's a great idea," Mr Harrington said as he shot to his feet so fast it was like he had sat down on a pushpin or something and started running towards the exit. "'Cause I just remembered that I forgot to turn off my coffeepot before I left this morning, and… oh boy, that'll be the third one this month already, and… um… class dismissed!"
"Okay, okay, I get it." Tony scrubbed his palm down his face. "Look, I gotta get going now, but I'm gonna be coming out there as soon as I can this afternoon, okay?"
Tony smirked as he pointed to the smaller central engine bell tucked down underneath the larger dual bells of the regular engines, noticing that Mr Muscles's fierce glare had been almost entirely replaced with an aura of boyish excitement.
“You are!” Tony yelped, gasping as his heart suddenly seized.  He grunted, pressing his palm to his chest.  “Pete,
"I love you," Steve whispered, his fingertips trailing down Tony's temple and cheek to his lips. "God, I love you so much."
Now that Ned had brought him up, though, Peter had to admit he was pretty curious as to what the former surgeon had been up to in the last several months.
"My numbers are matching right up with JARVIS's," Steve said a moment later. "Looks like we're good."
"Attention all Langaran air support aircraft," came the stern voice of Colonel Matthew O'Brien, commander of the Langaran Army Air Corps. "As of 1426 hours Langaran standard time, which by my watch was exactly three minutes and sixteen seconds ago, a ceasefire has been brokered that calls for an immediate halt of all hostilities between Langaran and Meridian forces in anticipation of a permanent peace treaty. All aircraft are hereby ordered to stand down and return to base immediately."
"He's joking, babe," he said gently. "You know Bruce's sense of humour has a tendency to be a bit too on the nose sometimes, right?"
"If you remember correctly," Tony muttered, chuckling as he poured a fresh cup of coffee. "Like you somehow wouldn't?"

In fact, it seemed like most of the file had been written by a kindergartener since it read more like a fairy tale than anything else, with lots of references to peanuts and peaches and wild horses and "gates marking the sea", exactly none of which was helping Peter figure out where HYDRA was keeping his papa.
"Thanos will have no shortage of people gunning for him," Gamora added. "We will not allow him to leave that battlefield alive."
Even his left arm, which had been aching practically non-stop ever since the attack up at the Compound, felt a bit better by the time they arrived at the banquet hall.
"That's true, your papa is pretty nice. Must be those old-fashioned manners." Ned rolled his eyes, leaning closer. "I think my mom has kind of a crush on him. She's always talking about how good he looks in his uniform and stuff."
"Look, I know you can't stand the guy, but you gotta admit that the stuff he put out was always way better 'n yours. I mean, the military didn't even give you the time of day until he pulled out of the weapons business, so—no—no—that's not what I meant, just—yeah, yeah. Don't worry, I said I'll get it done, which means it'll get done. Yeah, yeah, I'll let you know."
A pause followed, just for a heartbeat or so, but still long enough for Carol to shoot Steve a very confused side-eye.
"Well, you know me," Tony said. He propped himself up onto his elbows to watch as Steve got dressed, pulling up zippers and fastening buckles as efficiently as only a military man could. Once he had finished pulling on his new boots and fingerless gloves, he picked up the cowl, holding it in his hand as he turned to Tony, a sheepish smile on his lips.
It didn't help that Sam wasn't there to reassure Steve that things would be fine again someday. For how much Tony liked to joke about Steve's "giddy optimism", for Steve, ever since he'd met Sam it had been him that Steve had turned to whenever he needed to hear some encouraging words. Sam had understood what it was like to be a soldier, and the various struggles that soldiers faced when trying to adapt to the civilian world, and Steve had been missing his blunt but always truthful ways of seeing things terribly lately.
Steve paced nervously in the living room of the penthouse, waiting for Tony and Peter to join him.  They were heading out to dinner to celebrate a late anniversary of Steve and Tony’s first date, but, if Steve had his way, this was going to be far, far more than just a simple celebratory dinner.
“Dad, seriously, you don't have to worry about whether or not Steve likes you,” Peter said as they stepped onto the penthouse elevator.  “All you need to do is not screw things up.”
He could not afford to screw up his relationship with Tony.  Not when it was the only thing keeping him anchored.
And, just like Steve had promised Tony when he'd confined him to bed, once he was well, he found his unfinished armoured suit waiting for him in his lab, right where he'd left it.
Tony flinched, stamping down the whirlpool of panic swirling deep in his gut.  “Yeah, I’m thinking you’re right, but… there's still something that doesn't quite fit.  Pierce just isn’t smart enough to come up with something as big as this, and neither is Rumlow.  There has to be someone else in the background, pulling the strings.”  He huffed out a sharp breath, pressing the dog tags to his chest as he started to pace back and forth.
"And then this goes here, and that goes there, and then this thing should fit there, and… yeah. That just might work."
"Hmph," muttered Steve. He slumped down next to Tony, obviously pondering something by the way his eyebrows were twitching.
Tony could still feel the imprint in his throat left behind from his heart, and the deep, visceral ache from his knotted stomach as he and Steve had clung to each other's hands, waiting for Peter to emerge from the portal. If he'd been able to think a bit more clearly in that moment—impossible, of course, but hindsight was always twenty-twenty—Tony wouldn't have been as surprised that it took Peter a few extra seconds to step through. As much as both he and Steve believed that their boy was reckless at times, which Tony supposed came with the territory of being an enhanced teenager, Peter did usually take at least
Hot tears of shame pricked Steve's eyes, and he turned away, hoping that Tony wouldn't notice. It was bad enough that he had tried to convince Tony to stay behind in New York with Peter, using the lame excuse that Peter always hated the both of them being gone at the same time, but to keep harping on him the way that he'd been, well, no wonder Tony was getting frustrated.
"Okay, so then maybe, just for the sake of argument, we should assume that the particles aren't constrained by the Planck Scale and just go from there," Bruce interrupted. He stood up from the van, nearly tripping over one of his shoelaces that had come untied before turning to Scott. "Now, you said that the Quantum Realm is like its own micro-universe, correct?"
"And that right there is the main reason why we're all here," Sam said. "Because we are a team, and we don't leave our teammates behind, no matter what. Whatever it takes, right?"
"Nah, I'm used to it," answered Steve. "I'm usually awake before dawn to go running, so…" He pushed himself up to his feet, reaching for Tony's hand once he stood up.
"Mmm," muttered Tony, once again cursing the fact that Steve could read him like a book even in the near-darkness. Like Steve, Tony always—usually—slept bare-chested, so as to maximise skin-to-skin contact with his beloved.
"Fine," Tony said with a playful pout. "Then I'm gonna go find Pete, make sure that he remembered to shower. Somehow I doubt that Sam would appreciate all of his hard work being ruined by a stinky teenage boy."
"Thank you, sweetheart," Steve mumbled after a few minutes had passed, barely able to move his jaw enough to speak. He realised a few heartbeats later later that he needn't have bothered as Tony was already asleep, his hand cupping Steve's shoulder and a light smile on his full lips. Carefully, Steve shimmied down on the bed just enough to grab onto the blankets, pulling them up over them before pressing a final kiss to Tony's forehead and closing his eyes.
"No!" Tony managed to choke out, startling as Steve's fingertips glided across the bare skin of his waist, his hand coming to rest in the curve of Tony's hip. Tony was still shivering violently, his lungs gasping for air that seemed far too hot and way too thin as he kicked at the blankets tangled around his legs, trying to shuck them off.
"Am I ready to meet an actual prince? Hell no," Bucky answered, smirking slightly. "But someone's gotta make sure that you don't trip over your tongue, so here I am."
“And how many times have I warned you about appearances, Tony?” Obie continued, like he hadn't heard a word Tony had said.  “For a man in your position, appearances are half the battle in maintaining a good public view of the company.  And you being seen around town holding Captain America’s hand here is just not compatible with that view!”
“There's a spare office two doors down from here,” Tony said quickly.  “Take as much time as you need.”
"Yeah, he's pretty sweet," Peter said as he turned another page, this time showing Cashew nibbling on what looked like a crust of bread. "I like to feed him sometimes too, but don't tell my grandpa, 'kay? He'd think it's a waste of food."
"Agent Romanoff is inquiring if you would like her to stop by the floral shop on her way home with Master Peter," said JARVIS. "To order Miss Stacy's corsage for the dance?"
"Yeah, well, it's not like he's seeing me at all at the moment, is he?" Tony snapped. "I can't even manage to get out of here before the damn lights get cut off, and all the government cares about is whether or not I've completed the simulations for the next phase or not. They don't give a
Either way, the clock was ticking, and Tony hated the sound of ticking clocks. They always reminded him way too much of a countdown.
"Damn, these guys are sure on something today!" Bucky exclaimed over the comm as Steve launched into yet another dive, trying to shake the surface-to-air missile that was tailing him. He'd already managed to shake two of the things, the second one just barely, but they just kept coming, launching every few minutes from near the Meridian border.
The only people who would be that stupid would be bad guys, and Peter highly doubted that Gwen's father was a bad guy.
"What, you don't think Rhodey could use some pointers?" replied Tony. "'Cause I've heard some of his sweet talk before—I mean, not
"Five… four… three… two… one… Captain Rogers is passing through the barrier, sir," said JARVIS. "Expect reentry in approximately three minutes."
There was a short pause, and Tony could almost imagine JARVIS tilting his head in thought, if in fact he had a head.
"Well, we're not gonna make you sleep in your van, if that's what you were thinking," said Steve. He jerked his head towards the hallway that led to the three guest suites. "There are two other families staying with us that you might run into, but it should still be plenty quiet."
"Copy that!" said Sam as he and James fell in behind Tony, taking up position behind Thanos' lines. "It's time to take this asshole down some notches!"
"And the government knew back when you were at university that they were gonna ask you to start designing space-capable aircraft?"
Tony disconnected the call before Gwen could respond, which he regretted a few seconds later but quickly brushed off. The Stacy girl was nice enough, but Tony wasn't sure he'd be able to talk to her again unless Peter's condition changed, which at the moment didn't look like it was going to happen anytime soon. He'd have to get Steve to do it.
Which only made Tony even more determined. Because if there were other versions of him and Steve out there who had also just gotten their son back, Tony felt like he owed it to them to try and help.
"I guess I'll take that as a 'no'," Bucky said once Steve had finally finished coughing and rinsed out his mouth, his throat still stinging from the soap. "Look, it's not like we're gonna have to work all that closely with him or anything."
And Tony knew that Steve felt the same way, especially since he often lamented about the fact that he had missed out on the majority of Peter's childhood.
Gwen giggled. "Well, in your line of work, I'd say just give it time. Who knows what you guys will run into next."
Even if it couldn't even come close to repairing the gaping hole in his chest, where his heart had been carved out by a golden glove embossed with six colourful stones, and then smashed until it was nothing but ashes.
Tony sniffed, contemplating.  “Okay, so you think HYDRA’s been behind all the instability in the region over the years?” He asked.
Steve gave a nod, still clutching Tony's hand. "All right. And where are we on that? Have we been able to uncover a photograph yet?"
And Tony loved every single second of it, just like he knew Peter did as well.  Peter was everything that was good and decent in the world, and he deserved to be loved by as many people as possible.
Pulling out the handlamp, Howard flicked it on, shining the bright beam of yellow light directly towards the door of his office just as Maria appeared in the doorway, letting out a surprised gasp as she threw her hand up to cover her eyes.
"No!" Peter exclaimed. "Dad, there's no way that Mr Stacy is in with HYDRA, there's no way! I swear, you have to believe me!"
“Goddamn asshole,” Tony muttered as he stepped into the elevator, bouncing impatiently as it made its way down to the garage level.  The fact that Howard never once brought Tony to school or picked him up was the very reason why Tony absolutely insisted on doing both for Peter every single day.
And the fact that Peter tried so hard to put on such a brave face about it made it all the more heartbreaking.
"Well, yeah," answered Tony. "I mean, Obie had been drilling it into my head pretty much from the very second I found out that my parents had been killed that I had to keep on doing what Howard had been doing, or I'd end up being an even bigger disappointment to him than I already was."
It was treason, pure and simple, and it was enough to make Steve want to find a wall somewhere to punch through.  Just like he had down at the VA hospital in D.C., the day he’d found out Bucky was going to lose his arm.
He’s lucky he even can afford it at all, given how desperate his situation was after his abysmal failure in Athens.  If it wasn’t for the semi-decent health insurance plan he was offered by the university when he was hired, it likely would have been at least three years before Steve could’ve saved up enough money to afford his surgery.
“Yeah, okay.  But why the hell do you know his first name already?  Did he just tell it to you or something?  What kind of guy is he?”
"Oh no!" he cried as he immediately launched himself at it, managing to grab it just before it would've shattered against the wall. StarkPhones were durable, and Dad had made his even more so since he'd already managed to break so many of them. But not even Dad could build a phone that was completely Spider-Man proof, and especially not when his bedroom walls were reinforced so he didn't accidentally crash through them during his occasional sleepwalking or otherwise sleepy walking incidents.
Which, based on his previous experience, was usually a waste of time, but Tony supposed there was always a first time for everything.
"Because as far as we know, the space phenomenon was a single occurrence, whereas in this case, our assistance is being requested by the head of state of another country," Fury said firmly. "Another country that might prove to be an invaluable ally if such another space phenomenon were to occur."
"I hope so." Sharon huffed out a sharp breath as she bit her bottom lip, lowering her voice even further. "I'm not really allowed to talk about his family, but… let's just say that he needs a pretty expensive operation, but there's a lot of mitigating circumstances out there that are muddying the waters. It just sucks because he doesn't deserve any of it, you know? And yet he's still the one that's suffering for it."
"Птер!" shouted Uncle Bucky as he practically tossed Gwen through the hole he'd made in the wall, ducking just in time to avoid being slammed by the fire monster's arm as it swung, taking out another huge chunk of ceiling that blocked the hole he'd just made. Peter could hear the sound of sirens appreciating from the distance, both police and fire, but he had a sinking feeling that not even the strongest fire repellant would be enough to put out the monster, who was still growing larger as it consumed every bit of metal that it came across.
Besides that, Tony could probably guess what she would say anyway, so there was no point in wasting her time.
Unfortunately, his ability to point out just how grateful he is when Tony does simple things like that hasn't yet caught up to that awareness.
"I love you, Tony," Steve said once they were curled up together on their bed, with Tony's back pressed up against Steve's bare chest and his head tucked under Steve's chin. He pressed a kiss to Tony's cheek, his voice trembling ever-so-slightly. "I love you so much, I can't—"
Peter sighed, allowing his stiff body to relax against Papa's as Dad kissed the top of his head. "Papa said all that a lot better than I could've, Pete," Dad said quietly. "All we want is what's best for you, and you know that you're more than a bit biased here."
"Copy that," Tony said, circling back towards the far section of the bunker just in time to see what he hoped was the final suit crash down onto the ocean-drenched rocks.
"Well, I'm thinking that some hot cocoa sounds pretty good when we get home," said Papa. "And then it should be close enough to bedtime to call it a day, hmm?"
"I know, little guy, and I'm gonna take care of it for you." Steve had just shifted his leg to step off the bed when he felt a cold, metal hand grip his shoulder.
"Yeah," Scott said as he picked up another sandwich half. "So… ten months ago, I was, well, I was inside the Quantum Realm. Um… Hank, Captain, you know of Hank Pym, so… well, ah, anyway, that's probably not all that important. Um… not too long ago, Hank discovered that one of his old partners, this professor guy named Bill, had been taking care of a child who had been hit with some kind of experimental quantum blast, a blast that ended up killing her father. Long story short, this girl, who's not really a girl anymore, but that's not really relevant to the conversation either, so… Anyway, this woman now requires regular treatment with these quantum… particle things in order for her to stay healthy. So the day that Thanos happened, I was inside the Quantum Realm collecting the particles, and Hope, my—well, my—"
“Eh, not too bad, JARVIS,” Peter said.  He flung his backpack onto his bed and kicked his shoes towards his closet door, setting his new book set down onto the round table in the corner and staring at it like it was an unearthed rare treasure.
"I'm gonna choose to not answer that question," Steve said, relief evident in his voice. "I love you so much, Tony. You've made me the happiest man in Langara today."
Laying back onto the freezing cement floor, Steve closes his eyes, trying to concentrate on Tony’s footsteps.  The rhythmic
Tony had just opened his mouth to offer his own quip in reply when Thanos suddenly emerged from a battalion of Chitauri at least five warriors deep on all sides, carrying some kind of double-bladed weapon that was almost as long as he was tall. Tony's upper lip curled into a sneer as he watched the ugly purple beast meander his way out onto the battlefield like he owned the fucking thing, the Space and Reality stones still glowing brightly in the golden gauntlet that covered his entire left hand and forearm.
Peter's heart started to thud as he and Ned approached the house, the pulsating beat of the DJ music loud enough to rattle the windows. He knew Gwen was already inside since she had texted him while they were en route, and he was very much looking forward to seeing her. This was the first time that they'd been able to get together outside of school or the watchful eyes of their parents, and Peter was both very excited and really, really nervous. So nervous that it had taken him almost an hour to decide on what to wear, and then at least another thirty minutes to wrangle his curls into something that he considered more respectable than just having them hang in front of his forehead.
"So, you two wanna get some drinks?" Ned asked. "The punch is awesome here, it's even got real strawberries floating in it!"
"Right." Tony huffed out a sharp breath. "But then Pete came along and saw what I was doing, and he decided to take it about a hundred steps further."
“Maybe for you,” Schmidt spits out as he rips the cap from his head, tossing it in the general direction of the deck.  “You may have won this particular race, Rogers, but that does not mean that you are superior.  I have been an Olympic champion four times, so no matter what you accomplish, you will never be as good as me.”
expecting his heart to do that silly teenage fluttering thing as soon as he laid eyes on the man.  His own expertly groomed goatee aside, Tony’s not usually one to be attracted to guys with facial hair, but there was something about Steve’s blond beard with just the slightest touch of strawberry that went so perfectly with his chiseled jawline and gorgeous cheekbones that the very second they locked eyes, Tony was struck almost speechless.  Combine that with Steve’s slightly wavy blond hair, his piercing blue eyes that almost exactly matched the clear blue water in the pool, and the way he somehow managed to pull off that dark green plaid button-up shirt that for all intents and purposes no man under the age of seventy should ever dream of wearing… well…
“Yeah, let’s hope,” said Tony as he accepted a quick shoulder clap from Colonel Rhodes.  Then he handed the colonel the papers he got from Pepper, waving at them dismissively.  “You wanna look through those right quick?  Make sure nothing’s missing?”
"Yeah, it does," agreed Phillips. "But based on what you've told me this plan of yours is pretty much foolproof, isn't it?"
A second later the repulsors fired, immediately sending Peter shooting backwards towards the bank of sharp rocks. He managed to adjust the course just before he would've smashed against them, but then shot straight up over the top of the row of buildings.
"Honey, are you seriously trying to tell me that that kid's been calling you Papa for the last couple weeks or so, and you've been confused as to why?" asked Tony. "Steve, come on! It can't be that big of a shock to you."
“Oh, nothing,” Steve says, waving a dismissive hand.  “It’s fine, Lorraine.  I’ll keep the appointment.”
"Think the fever just broke again," he said as Steve set the tray down across Tony's lap, sitting down next to him. "So you're just in time."
The tiny cot where Steve lay completely naked and curled into a tight ball, just like Tony had found him after their first night together.
"Are they a couple?" Gwen whispered, her breath on Peter's neck sending a flurry of warm fuzzies throughout his body. "Your Uncle Clint and Auntie Nat?"
"I know that, Dad, and that's exactly why I wanna do it too." Peter's eyebrows knitted together as his huge brown eyes filled with tears. "I just… I
"So, was all this stuff just hiding out somewhere all this time?" Tony suddenly blurted out. "'Cause I gotta say, I can't believe there were only ever two doses of it made, so—"
"Um… thanks for that, Mr Harrington, but I'm sure we're gonna be so well-prepared that we won't have to worry about any of that. Yeah." She sucked in a deep breath, shooting Peter a brief grimace. "And on that note, why don't we call it a day?"
"Unless the Meridians somehow managed to get their hands on the design," said Uncle James. "Which, while not technically impossible, would be pretty damn difficult without help."
Like he always did, Tony didn't leave until the school’s doors had closed behind Peter and the six perimeter security guards had taken up their sentry posts.  Satisfied that his son was as safe as possible, Tony drove back to the Tower, bracing himself for the incoming barrage as soon as the elevator doors opened on the topmost floor of Stark Industries.
"But, you were right." Steve swallowed hard, choosing his next words carefully. "I can't—I can't do this on my own. Not anymore, so… Sam and I, we made a plan, and I'm gonna—I'm gonna try and work on this."
"Thank you, Captain," said Stacy. "Mr Stark, please let us know if there's anything else we can do for you."
As they approached the closed door to Obie’s office, Tony’s footsteps instinctively slowed.  He gulped as he felt Steve’s hand cover his own, glancing up to see his man’s gorgeous blue eyes looking down at him.
"No, not exactly," Steve whispered, biting down hard on his bottom lip. "It was—oh God, it was even worse than that! It was—it was—"
"I will be happy to, Captain," JARVIS said. "Oh, and I also have an urgent request from Mr Stark that you telephone him as soon as it is appropriate for you to do so."
All of Peter's emotions that were bubbling just beneath the surface finally boiled over, and he cupped Gwen's cheek in his hand, hesitating only long enough for her to nod before pressing his lips to hers in a kiss. It was absolutely
With a semi-contented smile, Tony took his husband's arm. As much as he often liked to tease Steve about his 1940's chivalrous behaviour, most of the time he secretly loved it. Just another way that Steve always made him feel cherished.
Finally, when it became clear that the gears inside Obie’s head had ground to a complete halt, Tony continued.
"Yes, but the pager's really too old for Hill to be carrying," Natasha said. She paused, looking intently at Steve. "Bruce and I both think it belonged to Fury."
"All right," Tony said as he inhaled a deep, shaky breath, patting Peter's back. "As you've probably figured out by now, we've got a situation down there. Can you think of a plan?"
"Neither can I," Tony said, suppressing his own shudder. "I was so scared and out of it that I thought I was hallucinating when you came sliding down that sand dune."
Steve thinks.  He quickly scans the surrounding forest, taking out three more guards as he races by.
Peter was shivering so violently that he was nearly vibrating out of his skin, so Tony rubbed his palms up and down his back as he held onto Steve's terrified gaze, barely able to risk blinking in the fear that Steve would just up and disappear.
Steve huffed, his bright blue eyes piercing under his cowl. "It's still too dangerous. The timing would have to be—"
"Potential biological weapons aren't really either of their areas of expertise, Steve," Natasha said gently. "I'm sure if any of the SHIELD scientists have questions that either of them can answer that they'll be looped in right away."
"Because—" Tony started, the rest of his words dying on his lips as Peter raised his head, looking up at him with his huge, doe-like eyes. There was no way Tony could tell him what he'd seen, it would scare him half to death, and the last thing that Peter needed was even more stress and worry for his dads piled on top of his skinny shoulders. No matter how strong those shoulders happened to be.
"Whew! Crisis averted." Tony pecked him one final time, then stepped into his armour and grabbed Steve's waist. "Shall we, babe?"
"Oh!" Steve breathed, fighting the strong urge to jump for joy. "Oh, Tony, that's—that's incredible! Does that mean we'll find out the rest of the mission parameters as well?"
Despite his nervousness, Peter was able to fall asleep rather easily. Staying asleep, though, turned out to be a problem, as a steady flow of nightmares had him crying out in fear pretty much every hour on the hour. Horrible dreams of Papa's aircraft exploding on reentry in a massive ball of orange flames, or of General O'Brien overpowering his guards and arresting Dad for treason, sentencing him to death by firing squad without even the pretence of a trial. They eventually got so bad that the adults started taking shifts with him, thinking that he'd be able to sleep better if he knew that he wasn't alone.
Tony had to admit that Sam's statement seemed almost a bit too optimistic, but he wasn't about to say that in front of Steve.
He was cut off as his climax slammed into him like a missile, the intensity of it stealing his breath as he came all over his stomach, barely aware of Tony's lips peppering kisses across his neck and chest.
"Tony, you told me yourself that your house was a mess the last few times you were there, and I'm sure my ma's friend would appreciate the business," added Steve. "She's an Air Corps widow too. Her husband was killed about a year ago."
And then, once Steve and Carol were back and all of the dust had settled, he and Steve would be finally able to get Peter his operation, and then they could finally go
“I believe this brief article might be helpful, Master Peter,” JARVIS piped up.  “I have translated it from its original Russian for you.”
"Sam said probably in a couple of hours, but you know how Pete gets when he's at stuff like that. As long as he has a running supply of food, I could see them staying until they close for the night."
It was Peter, but then it wasn't really him, it was him as a Winter Soldier, and—he was—well… I was alone, and he had me prisoner, and he was beating the hell out of me, is what he was doing, it was some kind of test or something…" He looked up, meeting Tony's worried eyes. "It was one of the scariest things I've ever seen. Almost as bad as seeing you lying on that hospital bed with your chest gaping open, and I guess… I just want those images
"First, allow me to introduce Wong," Dr Strange said, indicating an Asian man standing over by the destroyed staircase's railing. "He and I work together here at the Sanctum."
"Yeah, I'm enhanced, I guess you'd call it," Peter answered. "And so's my papa and some of my uncles, but my papa's been hurt real bad so my dad and the rest of the team needs my help." He huffed out a sharp breath, pressing his forehead against the window. "Can you please just let me out of here? Please? I promise that my dad will be able to help both you and your brother once all this is over, but that's not gonna happen unless I can get out of here."
Tony scoffed, shaking his head. He knew that Peter and Steve had spent quite a bit of time discussing strategic planning since Steve excelled at it, so the barely-still-rational part of him had to assume that Peter wasn't completely flying by the seat of his pants.
"Don't you even think about trying to go slow now," Tony warned as he rolled over. "You know I can take it."
“Goddamn taxis!” Tony yelped as he finally got the stupid sunglasses onto his face.  He swiped a tear from his stinging eye and drew in a deep breath, wishing he’d thought to bring some coffee along.  “Buddy, what the hell are you talking about?  And who the hell’s Steve?”
There had been so many nights over the past month where Tony feared that he might never see Steve again, and now—now he was right there, right in front of him.
"Yes, but right now that doesn't matter," said Nebula. "We must get the human back to his people. See how many of them are left."
"I'm sure you'll figure it out soon enough," Peter muttered as he headed down the hallway, already tugging his shirt and undershirt over his head to reveal his Spider-Man suit. As soon as he stepped outside he hid his clothes behind the a/c unit and reached behind his neck, unfolding his mask and pulling it on. After losing at least three of his masks over the summer, Dad had finally decided to just sew the thing onto the back of his suit, which offered a bit of extra padding around his neck when it wasn't in use.
“Ah, probably not as much as you all sacrificed for the lot of us, Captain,” said Fury.  “And thank you, by the way.  I was a Marine in my former life, so… I know a bit of what it’s like.”
"Yeah, that's fair," Tony said with a nod. He turned to Thor, eyeing the massive axe in his hands. "You're sure you can bury that thing in Thanos' neck this time? Preferably right under his chin?"
"No, little guy, I'm not positive," admitted Steve. "But you and I are gonna do whatever we can to keep him from getting to that point, all right? When I was growing up, my ma and I didn't always have the money for me to see a doctor, but since she was a nurse, she knew all kinds of good tricks to help me feel better."
"Ah, make a note to remind Pete and me to ask Lang about the whole giant-wannabe thing, will ya? Once this is all over?"
“Good.”  Dad pressed a kiss to the top of Peter’s head as the doors opened up into their penthouse apartment to the sound of JARVIS welcoming them home.  “Does pizza sound okay for dinner?”
"I'm really sorry about your mom, Tony," Steve murmured. "She sounds like she was a pretty amazing lady."
"Agreed," said Fury. "And let's hope that nothing else goes down. We haven't even finished dealing with the whole HYDRA mess yet, and I always hate having to deal with two crises at once. It tends to make me extra cranky."
Steve shrugged as he took a sip of his drink, swirling the hot, minty liquid in his mouth before swallowing and trying hard to ignore Sam's pointed look. Tony had always told him that he was an easy person to read, and it was times like this when he really wished that he wasn't.
as the twin engines on Carol's aircraft suddenly flashed orange and she took off down the runway, lifting off about five seconds later. Steve's heart thudded as he watched her clear the first guard tower and go into an immediate series of tight barrel rolls.
And if her dad was even starting to soften a bit towards Peter, then maybe they really would get to go out sometime soon without their superhero bodyguards, and Peter would finally get the chance to kiss her. Spring break was in less than two weeks, and if their upcoming trip to Italy was as relaxing as Dad was hoping it would be, then maybe even Papa would finally be able to calm down a bit too.
"Look, Captain, please forgive me if I'm way outta line here, but I know you and Mr Stark lost your son in the snap," Scott quietly continued. "And over a year ago, you guys helped me get my daughter back from what seemed like an impossible situation, even after I tried to break into your house. And so I'd just—well… if this crazy idea could somehow work, then… I guess I'd just really appreciate the opportunity to do the same for you. And for everyone else who's lost someone, or someones."
"Oh, I highly doubt that," Dr Strange said, with a rather sinister-looking smile. "But suffice it to say that I'm not interested in a competition."
And curiosity, piqued by the diagram Steve had caught a glimpse of in Peter's notebook which had then led him to spend quite a few hours in the computer lab over the last couple of nights. He had been extra careful with his queries, avoiding any mention of Project Phoenix or Howard Stark and instead focused his attention on trying to figure out why the other civilian science contractors mentioned in the files were no longer with the Air Corps.
"Only a bit of your influence?" Tony asked, his stomach already growling at the delicious smell. "Only a bit?"
He felt Steve smile against his skin. "As much as I hate to admit it, you're probably right. How 'bout I take a rain check for tonight, then?"
"January the first," said Ned. "But it was originally published anonymously. The novel didn't officially carry Mary Shelley's name until it was rereleased in 1823."
But Tony didn't really want to think about that at the moment.  Not when his own heart felt like it had been carved out of his chest with a soup spoon.
“Oh, and whatever it is that Obie’s going on about, tell him that he’s just gonna have to wait until this afternoon, yeah?  I got some other stuff to work on this morning.”
"Stevie," said Uncle Bucky. "'Cause I'm pretty sure if he were here right now that he'd say the exact same thing."
that son of a bitch try and play that card, that disgusting, barely-veiled homophobic card meant only to question Steve's authority and embarrass them both.
"You are?" Peter exclaimed, immediately clapping his hand over his mouth. "I mean, not that that's bad or anything. It's actually pretty awesome when you think about it, and—"
Gwen let out a giggle as they arrived at the doors, prompting Peter to make an attempt at a smile. Her laugh was one of the things that he liked about her the most.
Despite the fierce battles they had fought, the Avengers were overall a peacekeeping force, not a government-controlled enhanced army, and Peter knew Papa would never allow them to fall under any sort of government control.
Peter scowls.  “C’mon, Dad, don’t do that.  Don’t try and pretend that I’m still a three-year-old kid who doesn’t know what’s going on.”
Tony was so completely fried that he could practically smell colours, so he knew he wasn't exactly in the best mindset to process all of the weird-ass things that had happened in the last few minutes. That's why when Mantis suddenly began to disintegrate right before his eyes, Tony just assumed it was just some kind of funky remnant effect left over from the Reality Stone, or something like that.
And, peering more closely at Image Papa’s face, Peter could see that he was just on the verge of one of his breakdowns, and was trying desperately to keep it contained long enough for the group counselling session to end.
"I don't want to tell him anything that will upset him more, Tony," said Steve. "He's too fragile, and it's not fair to him to be worrying about me when there's nothing he can do about it."
The sound of footsteps heading towards the door caused Peter to jump back. He was just about at the end of the hallway when the man stepped out of the room and squinted in Peter's direction, his arms laden with colour-coded files. Almost immediately Peter felt the ice-cold shiver race down his spine that he'd come to recognise as his Spider Sense, which either meant that it wasn't working correctly, which had never happened, or that Mr Toomes was a criminal.
"I gotta get up," Steve said, the words so automatic that they almost seemed fake as he felt a set of sharp incisors break the skin of his right forearm, causing burning hot pain to shoot up the limb like an arrow. "I gotta get up!"
"I'd like you to go to our room at the barracks," Steve said. "Ask Sam or Carol or Colonel Rhodes to open it up for you if you need to, but… at the back of my sock drawer there's a small, black box that's got your ring inside it, and—and I'd really love it if you could find it and put it on for me. I want to imagine you wearing it when I look at the picture of the three of us."
Tears had flowed freely down Steve's cheeks as he'd watched his sweet, brave son pick him up off the freezing concrete floor, whispering comforting words as he slung his papa's arm around his shoulders and attempted to carry him out of the bunker, only to fall victim to the same mind-scrambling visions a few steps later.
Steve was in every way the quintessential 1940s gentleman, and while it had first thrown Tony for a pretty big loop, as he just wasn’t used to being so…
A sharp flash of anger shot through Tony as he watched Steve gulp out of the corner of his eye, his rigid posture not wavering even a millimetre.
"I know it, baby," he whispered against Steve's lips. "No one's ever been as good to me as you. No one."
"Mmm," Steve moaned as Tony hit a particularly sensitive spot on the back of his head, trying to not think of what he'd like and managing to think of nothing else. He squirmed as he felt Tony grin against his forehead before pressing his lips there, lingering just a bit longer than he expected.
Obie’s bushy eyebrows knitted together.  “Well… yeah.  But two whole weeks?  You really need that long?”
"Go and see your kid, Tony, that's an order," Phillips said. "Tonight or tomorrow night, I don't give a damn which, but I'm not going to authorise those simulations as ready until you do. Is that clear?"
"Loud and clear, Tony," answered Bruce. "And, thanks. Now I can maybe go take a nap before the little old lady who runs one of the pubs here tries to get me to eat more of her lutefisk. Yeesh. I'm sorry, but that stuff is nasty!"
"It was Mr Stacy that stopped it," Peter cut in, still coughing. His entire body was shaking, either from adrenaline or fear, he couldn't quite tell, and his mind was so foggy he was surprised he could still speak. "He came inside and distracted it just long enough for it to stop—"
As much as Tony would enjoy seeing his precious boy's smiling face after working so damn late yet again, it wasn't worth it for Peter to miss out on the rest he so desperately needed. The boy needed all the sleep he could get, and Tony could no longer afford to be selfish about it. Not if he wanted Peter to make it to his twelfth birthday.
“Everything looks good here,” Peter said as he queued up the readings.  “Whenever you're ready, Papa, we can start.”
"Mmm." The fact that Peter couldn't even seem to look him in the eye just reinforced that something else was wrong, but unfortunately now was not the time to be delving any deeper into it.
None of the leads that he and Bruce had managed to find in the HYDRA documents had amounted to anything, and while Natasha and Clint were already planning raids on a few newly uncovered coastal HYDRA strongholds, Tony wasn't holding out much hope that Steve would be found in any of them.
Hill shook her head. "Unfortunately, all of the researchers involved with the project were killed in the explosion, and most of their computer systems are trashed. I've already asked about the availability of any potential off-site backups, but so far we haven't gotten anywhere."
"Oh boy," Peter muttered as he was suddenly yanked off his feet. He shimmied up the web rope, the suit diving and swerving like a wild bronco trying to buck off its rider as Peter climbed up onto its back.
Tony was not the kind of drunken, fucked-up father that Howard had been.  He was breaking the cycle of shame.
"What?" he managed, watching in awe as the axe began zig-zagging its way across the plain, taking out every single group of war dogs in its path. Steve ducked as the axe passed over his body, gulping in relief as he pushed himself up onto his elbows just in time to see Thor land on the ground, surrounded by crackling bolts of lightning. As the lightning faded, two more beings landed on either side of Thor; a huge raccoon standing on its hind legs and holding a rifle, and a… tree.
"Eleven," Steve answered. He checked his watch, a replacement for the one Killian stole from him down in Miami. "And it's only half past eight now, so that would give us a good ninety minutes or so."
Peter gave a nod. "That's good," he said as he turned to Steve. "And you're not afraid of going into space?"
"One year ago, we lost," he began. "We lost friends, we lost family. We lost a part of ourselves." Steve paused, his eyes flicking to Tony, who gave him a nod. "Today we have a chance to take it all back. Today we have a chance to take back the worst loss the Avengers, the world, and the universe has ever suffered. We're ready. We're trained, and we know the mission. Most of us are going somewhere that's familiar, but that doesn't mean we should know what to expect. Be careful. Look out for each other. This is the fight of our lives, and we're gonna win. Whatever it takes."
Returning to the Compound, they found Uncle Sam and Uncle Bucky finishing their dishes in the kitchen after their own dinner. After showing them the ice cream, and sending a picture to Peter's dads, Peter and Gwen got to work on their dinner. Gwen turned out to be an excellent sous chef, something Peter probably should've figured out a lot sooner when she pointed out that she and her mom were tasked daily with feeding four hungry boys and men.
"You doing okay there, hon?" Tony asked once Bruce was out of earshot. He frowned as soon as the words left his mouth, reaching for Steve's hand.
Steve gasped, fear hitting him in the chest like a spear. Thor had seen Thanos up close, had already fought against him and lost. And if he, an actual god, and Hulk, the strongest creature that Steve had ever seen couldn't beat him, then how in the world could Tony and Peter?
"Help!" Peter screamed as he attempted to zigzag, his heart jumping into his throat as the crack zigzagged right with him, finally catching the heel of his left foot. Peter screamed again as he was pulled into the freezing water, his arms and legs flailing as he attempted to break free of whatever it was that was holding him, dragging him down, down, down towards the very bottom of the lake.
It was a completely understandable concern, and honestly one that Tony had had more than once since Peter's admission. He had always assumed that nothing bad could happen to Peter while the Air Corps still needed him, but while that assumption was likely a valid one, it would also cease to be valid as soon as Steve passed through the atmospheric barrier carrying the tesseract.
—without the enclosing dome, of course.  To Peter, it actually looked more like something one might find in an extra-fancy dentist’s office, which, while not exactly what he would find relaxing, he supposed it didn't matter as long as Papa was comfortable.
A loud groan of pain and fear worked its way up from Steve’s lungs, only to jam in his throat, resulting in a brief coughing fit that left tears streaming down his face by the time it was over.
"Yeah, I got it," Sam said as he expertly landed the jet, killing the engines once the wings were folded in. "All right. After you, Cap."
“Only if you remember,” Peter said as Tony opened his arms for a goodbye hug.  “Are you gonna try and take a nap today?”
"And that's what gave you the knowledge to design an aircraft that can fly into space?" Steve asked. "Astrophysics is the study of space and stars and how they relate to each other, isn't it?"
Obie frowned as he downed the last of the Scotch in his glass.  “Yes, as a matter of fact, I do know.  I ordered all the trials suspended around six months ago.”
Tony sighed, burrowing further into Steve's side as Thor grew louder and his gesturing grew more and more animated. He supposed it was a good sign that Thor was back to telling stories again, as for a long time he had been just a shell of his former self.
"Oh no," Steve groaned as he grabbed his shampoo and soap out of his locker. "You really think Phillips has it figured out too?"
Tony gulped, the intensity in Steve's blue eyes so profound that he almost couldn't look at him. No one had ever looked at Tony like that before, like he'd literally hung the moon, and it was more than a little frightening.
"I'm afraid it's too late, Captain," JARVIS said, so smugly that Steve gritted his teeth. "Mr Wilson reports that he will be up shortly."
So dangerously close, in fact, that as she shifted the stack of books to try and set them down on her desk one row over, the laptop proceeded to do just that. In a flash Peter shot forward, leaping across another desk and managing to catch the computer just before the corner would've hit the hard vinyl floor.
“Please?” Peter said, blinking up at Steve.  “Didn't you tell me you wanted to learn how to play chess?”
"Even if they wanted to I doubt that they could fire it again," said Tony. "Something like that would require a ton of energy, which they wouldn't be able to generate again so soon."
"Comes with the territory, Pete," Dad said. "But let's get this over with, yeah? 'Cause I am beyond sick and tired of this asshole's ugly face."
"Once I build it," said Tony. "And I still have to build and test mine first, so it's probably gonna be awhile."
Steve was quiet for several heartbeats, trailing his thumb along Tony's knuckles as he tried to come up with something reassuring to say. He didn't want to put so much stock into dreams since they were… well…
Somehow, no matter how weird or outlandish Phillips’ coaching techniques might have seemed at the time, they always ended up being useful.
"Oh, just some school stuff, nothing too exciting," Peter said, keeping his eyes trained on his cutting board so Papa couldn't see them.
"So instead of accepting whatever mission HYDRA tried to give him, he just shuts down instead," Steve said in a rush, tears welling in his blue eyes. "Oh my God, Tony. He's only a child, and yet he's just so strong! They were using Loki's sceptre on him, and he was still able to resist it!"
Carol's smile deepened. "Air Force. My friend Maria and I were two of the first women to fly test aircraft."
"Yes, sir, I do," answered Steve. "I guess I'm just unsure as to the exact point of the question. Mr Anthony Stark is one of my instructors for the X-302, so—"
"Thank you," Steve whispered as he followed the corporal into a grand outer office that was at least twice as large as Steve's barracks room.
The man gave a jerky nod, prompting Steve to ask, "Who did this? Who gave you those orders? Why would they want you to attack Peter, he's just a boy!"
Draining the rest of the lukewarm coffee in his cup, Tony picked up his tablet again, looking back at the lines of code he'd been studying earlier.
"Eh, I nailed it, it was easy," Peter said with a shrug. He grabbed onto his polar bear, hugging it to his chest. "When're you guys coming home?"
Peter let out a heavy sigh. It'd all fallen on deaf ears, just like he'd feared. "Yeah, I do. I'll go and get it."
Grandma brushed the hair from his forehead, tenderly patting his cheek. "You are a lot like your papa, young Peter Stark. You have a strong heart, just like he always did. Even before he was tall and strong."
"Uhh, I hate to interrupt, but we really need to get going here," said Sam. "We're still only about halfway through this."
"Thanks, Dad!" Peter said as he gathered snow for his next snowball, his bright red nose and cheeks framed by the bright blue hood of his parka only enhancing his sweet, cherub look. More giggles ensued as he searched for Steve's hiding place amongst a clump of trees, finally launching his snowball when Steve attempted to move around behind him.
"Well, I'm surprised you can't still hear Bucky with all the whooping and hollering he was doing," Wilson said, laced with amusement. "Guy's gonna scream himself hoarse before he even gets out there."
They held hands for the rest of the game, through Uncle Thor's shouts of glee every time the Rangers scored and Uncle Clint's curse-filled lament when a last-second opposing goal caused them to lose the game. The walk back to Gwen's house afterwards was way too short, and as he brought her up to her front door and gave her a goodbye hug, Peter could hardly believe that they had actually made it through a date without something terrible happening.
Ned's eyes went wide. "Um, no!" he said emphatically. "Dude, I don't have a death wish, thank you very much! Black Widow is like the most badass of badasses, there's no way I'd wanna piss her off!"
"It would appear to correspond, sir," JARVIS said after a short pause. "However, I am still unable to visualise anything located at those coordinates."
Tony let out a groan, scrubbing his palm down his face.  “Yeah, J, I know.  But you heard me right.”
"Thanks, boy," Tony said as he took a sip, earning another beep as DUM-E returned to his corner, patiently waiting for when Tony needed him again.
how he had imagined their first kiss would be, standing in the middle of a dark and stinky boys' bathroom during a school dance, but somehow, in all of the craziness that was his life at the moment, it seemed to be just perfect.
"Mmmhmm?" Tony murmured as he kissed that spot again, smirking when Steve let out a shudder. "You say something, honey?"
Steve thought, since Tony had recently outfitted the entire building with their defence drones, complete with a long enough range to target the competition site if necessary. That plus the fact that all of their teammates were also planning to attend the competition were the only reasons why Steve was able to be so calm about it. After the committee meeting, Steve was not at all looking forward to returning to Washington D.C.
“Like I said, we’ll talk about it while I bring Steve back,” Tony said.  He gave Peter’s shoulder a gentle squeeze, leaning down to kiss him on the forehead.  “I’ll be back in a bit, so don't burn the house down or anything.”
“Ah, my darlings!” Mags cries as soon as Tony and Peter step through the door.  “It’s so good to see you!”
“You had a bad dream, honey.”  Tony pressed a soft kiss to Steve’s forehead, his fingertips gliding up and down Steve’s spine.  “A pretty lousy one, from the sounds of it.”
"Young Starkson!" Thor exclaimed as he pulled Peter into such a tight hug that Peter's back cracked. "It is so, so good to see you again!"
He also happens to notice that Steve only waves with his right arm, keeping his left one down at his side.
"Daddy!" Peter shrieked as he buried his head in Tony's shoulder, his hand gripping Steve's like a vise. "They can't—they can't have me! No matter what—I won't—I'm not gonna let them!"
For a moment, Steve was again too stunned to speak. Their team had been talking for months about removing the Tesseract from Earth because Thor had believed it too dangerous to have that many of the infinity gems on Earth, when all along there was another one located only a few miles away from their home.
"Yes, my king," said General Okoye. With a click of her heels, she nodded to her fellow warriors and began marching towards the armoury as T'Challa turned back to Steve.
Mr Rogers gives him a wide smile, one that Peter just happens to notice causes Dad to blush.  “That’s very kind of you to say, Peter.  It’s nice to meet you too.”  He starts to cross his arms, then stops, hooking his thumbs into his belt loops as he jerks his head towards Peter’s bag.  “So, it looks like you’ve brought your swimming stuff with you?”
"Um, it is okay if I watch the game with them, isn't it?" Peter asked gingerly once Uncle Sam was out of earshot. "I don't have any homework since tomorrow's the last day of school."
Hammer," Tony said, dripping with false sincerity. "What exactly did HYDRA promise you in return for not only betraying your country, but also torturing a U.S. citizen and kidnapping a minor? 'Cause I'm guessing that it'd have to be a pretty damn good offer since there's no way in
"Yeah. So?" answered Tony. He bit down on his bottom lip as Steve's deft artist's fingers worked their way underneath the pants and Tony's boxer briefs, still deliberately avoiding his already straining erection.
The machine shut down like the ebb of an aircraft engine after landing, fading into an eerie silence as the entire crowd, including Steve and Tony, held its collective breath.
After making sure that Peter ate a few more bites of popcorn, Tony shuffled across the apartment into his lab, face-planting onto the couch as soon as he crossed the threshold.  The tears started only a couple of heartbeats later, spilling down his cheeks almost before he realised they were there.
"They should be here in a few minutes," Peter said, just as Papa's truck pulled into the parking lot. "Or now, I guess." He forced himself to attempt a smile, earning a quirked eyebrow from Gwen in return.
It was how all of Grandpa's visits went. He would show up sometime around mid-morning, huffing and puffing from walking all the way from their house to the hospital, sit down and debate with Peter about some aspect of the new project, and then the moment that Peter contradicted him about something or pointed out something that they'd already discussed, he would clam up and fall asleep.
"Just my parents," Ned said, shooting Gwen a knowing look. "Geez. Must be nice. Hi, I'm Peter, and my parents are Iron Man and Captain America, but to me they're just my dads who make me clean my room and take out the trash."
"I am perfectly capable of completing both tasks at the same time, sir," protested JARVIS. "Please stand by."
"Yes, sir," the cadet said, rather warily. Steve shot her a harsh look as she sat back down, hoping it would be enough to keep her from poking her nose where it didn't belong.
"Steve, honey, please stop telling me thank you, yeah?" Tony said as he kissed Steve's knuckles. "I love you, all right? I love you so much, and you will never have to thank me for it. Not
Steve's expression immediately darkened, his arm tightening around Tony's shoulders. "I'm not sure if—"
Pepper Potts, Tony’s assistant, was waiting for them when the elevator doors opened on the executive floor.  Tony had introduced Steve to her and her fiancé Happy, Tony’s Head of Security, the previous day, when they had gone over their strategy for that morning’s confrontation.
"Steve, Bruce's already spoken with M'Baku," James said. "From what he said, the entire royal family was snapped, so he and General Okoye, well… they've got a lot of their own stuff to deal with at the moment. We can talk with them again later."
And, even better, Peter didn't get sick either, finishing out his school year with straight A's, his position at the top of his class firmly in hand.
“Uh huh.  See ya tomorrow!” Peter called as the door closed behind him.  Then he shoved another huge chip into his mouth, licking his lips.  “Mr Reeves comes in here almost every day, and today he even brought me these chips!”
"Okay, honey, I can do that," Tony whispered. "But I'm not gonna count it as official-official until you can put it on my finger yourself, okay? This'll just be like a practise run."
Since the Iron Legion was developed mainly for the protection of the Damage Control convoys, Tony had been storing their schematics and other information on a dedicated Damage Control server, one that apparently either Quentin Beck or whoever he was spying for was able to find and hack into using the coding patch that Beck wrote for JARVIS all those years ago.
"Trying," Tony said, gasping as Steve curled his fingers inside him, brushing against that magic spot that made stars dance in front of his eyes as the pleasure coil in his gut wound tighter and tighter. "Oh fuck, Steve, I'm ready. I promise I'm ready.
"Come in?" he said, his belly swooping when Sam walked into the room, followed directly by Bucky, Ma, and Sharon.
"Even though you don't ever actually use the microwave," Tony said, raising an eyebrow. "Something about not wanting your food to be blasted with radiation?"
Tony watched them head towards the elevator, his mind already swirling with everything that he needed to get done before Steve left. He'd just finished a brand-new uniform for Steve a few nights ago when he couldn't sleep, a replacement for his traditional red, white, and blue Captain America uniform. This latest model featured upgraded Kevlar throughout the chest and abdomen—where Steve always managed to take hits, no matter who or where he was fighting—and some extra cushioning in his left boot to support the foot that HYDRA nearly destroyed beyond repair in their quest to study Steve's ability to self-heal. A shiver raced down Tony's spine as he recalled the stomach-flipping grotesqueness of Steve's poor foot, and how long it took for Steve to recover from it, with Tony worrying the entire time that HYDRA might've managed to push Steve's body beyond the regenerative limits of the serum.
"Hopefully Dad'll be done with all of his government business by this afternoon so we can both come and pick you up after your Decathlon practise," Papa added. "And Uncle Bucky's gonna come over for dinner tonight, so I thought we could all watch a movie afterwards as long as you don't have too much homework."
Since the dinner with his ma, Steve and Tony had been working almost nonstop trying to put the finishing touches on their plans. Along with spending almost twenty-four total hours building the containment vessel for the tesseract, which was now under guard, Tony—with Peter's help—had also designed and built a set of what he called scramblers, small machines that when strategically placed, would neutralise any possible government listening devices that happened to be hidden around Ma's house. Knowing that Peter and Bucky and Sam would be able to speak freely while at Ma's was a big load off of both Steve's mind and Tony's. The last thing that Peter needed was more to worry about while Steve was out in space.
"We are currently in the midst of a developing crisis," said Dr Strange, sounding grim. "It's not overselling it to say that the fate of the universe is at stake."
“Mmm, been up past midnight loads of times,” Tony grumbled.  His beautiful plush lips curled into a smile as Steve set the computer on the bedside table and settled in next to him, draping his arm across his waist.
"Tony, are you there?" he pleaded as his nanite cowl disappeared, pressing his fingers over his ear. "Tony, please come in!"
"Yeah, yeah," muttered Peter as Dad backed out of the driveway and drove away, wondering how in the world he was going to be able to deal with an extra-anxious Papa for the next four hours.
Tony snapped. He took Steve's face in his hands, preventing him from looking away. "Goddamnit, that's exactly what's keeping you from seeing the problem! You keep thinking you have to hide it, but you don't have to! This isn't the 1940's anymore, Steve, it's not unacceptable for a man to admit that he needs help!"
And Steve would be forever grateful to both Clint and Natasha for agreeing to become the twins' official guardians. Given Pietro and Wanda's unique mutations, there was no telling what the government would have decided to do with them had the team not taken them in. And by having Clint and Natasha at the Compound with them full-time, it gave them the stability they needed to try and rebuild their lives.
"No, honey, nothing's too good for you," Tony said. He brushed Steve's lips in a soft kiss before squeezing his eyes closed, biting down hard on his bottom lip as Steve let out another wanton moan. "You only deserve the best."
“Should be,” answers Natasha.  “All I have to do is figure out how many different sizes of sparring gloves we would need and I’m set.”
"Exactly zero, Senator," answered Tony. "Just because I halted production didn't mean that I reneged on any of my company's contracts. Stark Industries has never broken a contract made in good faith, and it never will. And if you don't believe me, I'm sure there's a few Colonels or Generals sitting behind me who would be happy to vouch for me."
, DUM-E reappeared, whirring and warbling like R2-D2 on steroids as he motored back to his corner, seemingly unharmed by the particle experiment. Peter breathed out a sigh of relief. While he trusted his and Dad's calculations, the first experiment with a new piece of tech was always a bit nerve-wracking, and even more so when it involved people. Or beloved bots, as it were.
"Eh, it was more like I wanted to prove that I was nothing like my father," Tony said firmly. He tapped his fingertips on the table, giving the sprawling mess hall another anxious glance. Steve had insisted that it was okay for Tony to join him in the officer's mess for dinner, and they had even talked very pleasantly with his teammates Captains Wilson and Barnes for awhile, but Tony still wasn't quite comfortable sitting in what he'd always felt was a forbidden place.
"Tony?" he said as his eyes flicked between Peter and Tony. "What's going on? What's wrong with the boy?"
"Well, I can't say I'm too sorry for that," he said softly. "But, honey, there's still a lot more stuff that I've got to tell you, and—"
All of the pain Steve’s endured over the last three—or even four—years, both physical and otherwise, has all been for nothing.  He’ll have no money, no endorsements, and no way to help Ma.
“Tony, that doesn't mean that you don't need sleep,” Steve says gently.  He takes a small sip from his water bottle, grimacing as the ice-cold liquid hits his very empty stomach.  He suppresses another shiver, trying to keep his teeth from chattering.
"I love you," he said as he leaned forward and buried his nose into Steve's neck, almost too choked up to get the words out. Steve smelled like shaving cream and the hospital soap that he'd just used to wash him, but underneath it there was still that lingering scent of vanilla that Tony had always loved.
The harsh beep of one of his monitors broke him from his spiralling thoughts, and Peter rolled his eyes as he slumped backwards, trying to take deep, even breaths as he fought the almost overwhelming urge to cough. His heart was racing, thudding madly against his ribcage, and the last thing that Peter wanted was for Dad and Papa to show up while he was having yet another one of his choking fits.
Peter held his breath as he studied his father’s face, his expression morphing from disbelief to fear to denial and then back to fear, all within about three seconds flat.
"Clint, watch it!" Steve shouted, raising his shield just in time to block the shot that came from somewhere off to their left.
sure?" he asked, quirking his eyebrow into what he hoped was a pleading look rather than whiny. He shimmied his hand down between their bodies to curl around Steve's cock, the loud moan that rumbled up from Steve's chest sending a ripple of pleasure down Tony's spine. "Seems like you could use a hand here or something, so…"
"I think we're pretty much set here, Captain," Sharon said as she handed the last of Peter's monitors to Sam. Bucky was already sitting out in Sam's car with another load of equipment, having been discharged from the hospital two days prior. He and Sam had just finished moving into the house that Sam had found after the attack, which was thankfully only a five-or-so minute drive from Ma's house, but Sam had repeatedly assured Steve that once the mission got underway they would both be at Ma's as much as possible.
“Copy that!” Natasha says as she takes off, heading directly for the jeep parked next to the tower.  She flips over the back, landing directly into the driver’s seat.  “Let’s hope they left the keys!”
"I'll be waiting!" Fury called as they exited the room. Tony wrinkled his nose, tightening his grip on Steve's arm.
"Maybe not all of it," Bucky cut in. "Stevie, there was a ton of stuff in there and Peter didn't have the energy to go through it all, so he just did some quick searches for a few keywords that we've been wondering about."
"Oh, I'm fine. You don't need to worry about me." Steve bit down on his bottom lip, shifting on his feet. This wasn't how he'd planned to apologise, but he may as well just go with it anyway.
"Because he's a Stark," Steve spat out, his stomach giving a violent lurch as he clenched his fingers around his superwater bottle. "There's really no other reason. I've been doing a lot of digging lately, and that's the only reason that I've been able to come up with that makes any sense. They're using Peter to both punish Tony for what his father did and to keep Tony in line."
Steve's back was ramrod straight, his shoulders perfectly level as he arrived outside of General O'Brien's deep mahogany office door, the placard tacked to the front embossed in pure gold. Steve had been to the general's office a few times over the course of his Air Corps career, mainly for commendations on his performances during particularly difficult patrols, but this trip felt different. How could he have not noticed the vast differences between even his rather ordinary barracks building and the positively grand Headquarters building that housed all of the main government leaders? How could he have not noticed that in all of his years of service, Steve had never seen any of the ten or so men who ran their country's government actually anywhere near a field of battle?
"Yeah, and that's really saying something, considering that you're not even in Langara at the moment," said Tony. "Aren't you somewhere over the ocean right about now?"
But for someone who was used to risking his life pretty much every single day, somehow confessing to Tony the truth about knowing his son scared Steve badly. Almost as much as the thought of losing Tony.
"It's okay, Tony," Steve said. "I'll be all right… eventually. I just…" He paused, looking up at Tony through his lashes. "Do you think we could go check on Peter? I know JARVIS said he's okay, and I promise I won't wake him up, but… I just—I just wanna see him with my own eyes, so—"
It hurts so damn much! It just doesn't seem real, like I'm in some neverending nightmare. I mean, I walk into the living room, and I keep expecting to see him there, reading a book or watching a movie. But he's never there! Or I go into his room, and it looks exactly like he left it, with his Legos scattered across the table and his Norse mythology books open on his bed, like he's gonna be home soon. But he's not! He's never coming home again, and I just—I just can't accept that, Nat! I just can't!"
Steve closed his eyes, allowing his body to relax into the mattress and reveling in the closeness of his beloved husband, the husband he had been so close to having to say goodbye to only moments before.
"You look really nice too," Peter said. "You know Dad's not gonna know what hit him when he sees you. He always loves it when you wear your super-fancy uniform."
Peter was still grinning as he hung up the phone, placing it on his bedside table for Ms Sharon to pick up later. Then he shook his head, wiping the happy tears from his eyes as he tried to calculate the actual odds of Steve and his father getting together.
"Hold on, honey, just give me a sec," Tony said, grunting as he reached over to the bedside table for their nearly-empty bottle of lube. He quickly squeezed a generous amount into his palm before taking hold of their cocks again, his free hand sliding down Steve's back to squeeze his ass.
"Thank you." Steve's jaw twitched as he tugged on Tony's hand, drawing him into a tight hug. "Please don't hide stuff like that from me again, sweetheart," he murmured. "It's always better to handle this stuff together, isn't it?"
A few rows in front of Tony sat George Stacy, his wife, and their three boys, who had all expressed their profound sympathies before the start of the competition, with Stacy reaffirming his desire to help in any way possible multiple times. Tony had managed to be polite while he thanked him, a feat that had required a lot more energy on his part than it probably should have. Even though he had finally let go of the notion that Stacy was a HYDRA agent, Tony still didn't trust the man.
So when Peter had asked him if Thanos had snapped his fingers and Dr Strange had said yes, that must've meant that—
"My Uncle Bucky loves trivia, like me, so he helps me practise for Decathlon a lot," Peter explained. "That's one of the funnier gems that we came across earlier this week."
Which meant that his pissed-off, I'm-Iron Man-so-don't-fuck-with-me voice was more like he was screaming into about a dozen bullhorns, scraping along Peter's already frazzled nerves like Papa's favourite cheese grater.
"I know, Tony," Phillips said as he shoved a tissue into Tony's hand. "And once this works all of Langara will know his name. And yours."
"Okay, but are you sure?" Gwen insisted. "'Cause they're taking my dad to the hospital, so why doesn't Peter just go with him? He's probably got smoke inhalation, and burns, and his arms and fingers are bleeding, and—"
Tony's lips curled into a smirk as he kissed that sensitive spot under Steve's jaw, smirking when he shuddered. "Soon as the kid goes to bed, honey. After that, you're all mine."
He felt Steve smile against the back of his head. "I might've heard that a few times in my life, mo grá."
“In order to avoid detection, such an endeavour will require several hours, sir,” JARVIS said.  “But I do believe it to be possible.”
"S'okay, sweetheart, I've got you," Steve said as he slipped his hand between their bodies, curling his fingers around Tony's leaking cock. "Come for me, Tony!"
"Sure, little guy, it's okay," Papa said, a sort of sad smile on his face. "Long as you're back up here before bedtime, okay?"
Then again, Bucky had been joking about he and Tony having sex after their first date so maybe just a kiss would be okay. But then again Steve had only ever kissed one other person and that had been over ten years ago and definitely not all that memorable, and Tony had a son so he was obviously more experienced in sexual matters than Steve was anyway, so—
"The Avengers have no plans at the moment to add any new members to our team," Steve cut in. "And if that time ever comes, we would decide on it as a team, for the team."
After starting the dishwasher and making a huge pot of hot chocolate, complete with marshmallows, Peter and Gwen gathered up a bunch of blankets and headed up onto the roof of the main building. They set up their makeshift camp in front of the telescope, with Gwen sitting between Peter's legs, leaning against his chest. Taking turns with their stargazing, they were able to identify Venus and several constellations, taking plenty of notes in their notebooks for their Decathlon finals coming up in a couple of months.
"They are," Tony said, so flatly that Steve's blood ran cold for a moment. He traced around the rim of his cup with his finger, his beautiful brown eyes filled to the brim with fear. "They… it's like they were just sitting there in the background of my mind, biding their time until we were able to destroy HYDRA, and now—"
Tony grinned, pecking Steve's kiss-swollen lips again before sliding off his lap and hurrying over to his workstation. He and Steve had had sex in the lab often enough that Tony now made sure to keep at least one bottle of lube in there at all times, especially after he got caught in the hallway once by Peter during one of his middle-of-the-night snack runs. Grabbing the bottle he found in his top drawer, Tony squirted some into his palm and dropped to his knees in front of Steve, slowly stroking him as he trailed his lips along the inside of his thighs, sucking more marks into his skin.
As soon as he heard the sound of Uncle James's retreating footsteps, Peter laid back, trying to make it look like he hadn't been listening. About three seconds later Uncle Bucky rapped on his door.
"Oh yeah, I did," said Peter. He gave Tony a sheepish look. "That okay? I know we were supposed to work some more on the repulsors later, but—"
"Okay, now you're really worrying me," Gwen said, her pretty face etched with concern. "You sure you can't give me a hint or something? You're not sick, are you?"
They left for home the following day, taking off just after the sun went down in the hopes that the children would be able to sleep on the jet. Steve's heart was nearly filled to bursting as he, Tony, and Peter took over the largest couch in the back, Tony tucked up against one side and Peter against the other, both of them sound asleep. They were so alike that they even made some of the same faces as they slept, with Steve taking plenty of mental notes so he could sketch them out later. The little sketchbook that he always took on missions still had a few blank pages left, and Steve wanted to get them filled before Peter decided that he was too old to cuddle.
"Definitely," Peter answered, even though he had no idea if Dad would let him go or not. "There's no way I'm gonna just sit home and cry. That'd be like letting them win."
"Do we have to?" Tony asked, mentally kicking himself a second later when Steve flinched. "No, no, honey, that's not what I meant. I mean, do we have to
Setting his water glass down, Steve padded out into the hallway and towards Peter's room. While JARVIS had said that he was doing fine and Steve had no reason to believe the UI wasn't telling the truth, he still preferred to see for himself. With so much uncertainty surrounding them—gods, aliens, other dimensions, Peter's health, and Tony's ongoing obsession with hunting down and destroying the Ten Rings—Steve felt he could never be too careful when it came to either of them.
Peter shook his head, clapping his free hand over his ear. "No, no, no. They can't have me, Daddy, they can't. I'm not gonna let them!"
If nothing else, it would serve as a decent distraction, something both he and Peter could use at the moment. Hearing that his girlfriend was going to be spending the entire upcoming summer on another continent had stung him badly, and anything Tony could do to help Peter cheer up he figured would be more than welcome.
"Oh, I'm fine," Peter said automatically. "Same old, same old." He grabbed his notebook, tearing out the pages of new code. "I wrote these this afternoon while I was waiting for you guys. More layers of encryption for JARVIS."
"Yeah, well, I've just had a lot on my mind, okay?" Peter snapped. "In case you hadn't noticed, the liberty of my entire family was kinda at stake until only a couple days ago."
Tony's head snapped back in surprise, and he gave it a hard shake, crying to clear it. "Wait, you saw…
Lifting his head, Steve glanced around the jet. The twins were sitting with Natasha and Clint on two of the middle benches, their heads tucked together as they softly talked, while Sam and James were manning the cockpit, each taking two hour shifts on the controls to help ensure they would both be as fresh as possible once they landed in Wakanda.
"Um… you don't have to be scared of my dad," Peter said, rather tentatively. "He doesn't—he doesn't hate you. He doesn't even dislike you."
was—no matter what, was still enough to relax some of the iron-rod tension in his limbs, and despite his churning mind, he found himself actually starting to drift off.
"Yes, I do. I'd appreciate it, though." Steve dipped his head, brushing his lips across Tony's in a soft kiss. "Be careful, please."
"Yeah, and I s'pose having a kid on the way doesn't factor in there at all, huh?" said Chester. "Say, you and Sarah pick out any names yet?"
And it wasn't just Tony, everyone else was there too. Gamora, Nebula, Scott, Sam, Bucky, Wanda, King T'Challa. The tree.
Fresh anguish welled up inside Tony as he imagined his poor husband stuck down on Earth, no doubt worried sick about him and Peter all while fighting against the Chitauri and whoever else Thanos had managed to coerce into following his mad ideals.
About three seconds later a bluish holographic model of something that resembled a catalytic converter appeared in the open space next to Peter's bed. Tony's eyebrows knitted together as he walked slowly around it, running his fingers along his unkempt goatee as he tried to figure out how the thing was supposed to look.
Then maybe, just maybe, with the Tesseract returned to SHIELD’s control and all of the HYDRA moles flushed out from their hiding spots—
“All right.  So now all we have to do is figure out who Pierce is reporting to,” said Tony.  He curled his fingers around the dog tags, squeezing them into his palm.  “And then figure out where in the hell they took Steve.”
"Tony," Steve whispered, so reverently that tears pricked Tony's eyes. One hand glided up his back to his neck, his fingers weaving into Tony's hair. "My sweetheart, my beloved husband, you don't owe me anything. Not a single damn thing."
In fact, it was way too similar to the look Bucky's eyes held when he attacked Steve on the Project Insight helicarrier, as the Winter Soldier.
But at the moment, all Tony cared about was what she was carrying in her right hand.  A large, steaming mug of coffee.
"All right, kiddo," Sam said as he got to his feet. He stepped up next to the bed, placing a reassuring hand on Steve's shoulder.
Tony should’ve known that he’d needed to compose himself a bit more before stepping inside the store.  Peter’s perceptiveness aside, he should’ve realised that Steve would know something was wrong the second he laid eyes on him, which would then cause his mind to start working overtime.  Steve, for all of his wonderful attributes, seemed to believe that anytime Tony was anything less than content, he needed to step things up and make him so.  Tony had tried explaining to him a few times that sometimes he just needed to let his grumbly mood work itself out, but Steve never seemed to get it, and would bend over backwards trying to pamper Tony until he admitted that he was better.
"No, no way in hell would he joke about something like that," agreed Sam. "Wonder who it is? Gotta be someone pretty damn smart if they've managed to hurdle over all the military scientists this late in the game."
Gwen only shrugged, hugging her stack of books closer. "They haven't been picking you up from school. Ever since school started it's been one or both of them waiting for you in the afternoon, but for the last week it's been someone else."
"Okay, but that still doesn't explain why you didn't tell me?" The adrenaline coursing through Tony's veins was starting to wane, seeping from his body in spades and leaving him feeling like a wrung-out washcloth.
I can’t wait to see what you guys think!  Please don’t forget to hit the kudos button and leave me a comment! 💗
"And you've got me. You've got all of me, now and forever," Steve said softly. He trailed his fingertips down Tony's temple and cheek to his mouth, tracing his full bottom lip. "But right now I wanna make you feel good. Are you gonna let me make you feel good, darlin'?"
"Sometimes exciting isn't all it's cracked up to be though," said Gwen, almost like she'd read Peter's mind. "I mean, I know my dad's not an Avenger, but he still has his fair share of shall we say,
He remained there for over an hour, until the water started to run cold and his skin was screaming in protest. Avoiding the mirror, Steve carefully toweled himself off and threw on some clean pyjama pants and a t-shirt before making up the bed with fresh sheets, tossing yet another set of torn bedding into the trash.
While Papa had indeed been upset about having to get another cast on his foot, the surgeon had at least been able to take out most of the metal pins from his healing bones, which meant that Papa could now bear some weight on his left leg as long as he didn't do it too often. He of course had been pushing the "not too often" part ever since he'd gotten home and kept refusing to use his cane most of the time, but as Dad had pointed out, he wouldn't be Papa without trying to push against his limits.
He was Captain America, for heaven’s sake, and Captain America didn't give in to bullies.  No matter who they were.
Even though Papa would never want Peter to miss out on something because of him, as Dad had said when Peter brought up the subject a few nights ago, especially since it would mean disappointing Gwen as well. And while Peter knew that Dad was right, it still didn't help him feel any better about it.
But Peter didn't really have the patience to wait for diplomacy, and neither did Dad. They both wanted answers
"Um… I don't think I get what you mean?" Steve asked. A second later Tony let out a loud snort, tipping his forehead against Steve's arm.
"I won't if you don't," Tony shot back, his palms gliding up Steve's back. "Don't you dare try and be some kind of superhero now, you got that? This is just another mission. You just do all of the same fancy flying that you usually do and let JARVIS take care of the rest, yeah?"
The fact that their engagement announcement and subsequent wedding plans served as the perfect distraction to those few people who still wondered if Dad should’ve been up there on that trial stand next to Obie was the proverbial icing on the cake.
"Likewise, Captain," replied T'Challa. He glanced over at Tony, who instantly straightened his shoulders. Tony had met a few different heads of state during his years as a weapons manufacturer, and while many of the palaces owned by those rulers had been far more extravagant than this one appeared to be, none of the others had had half of the amount of stateliness that Tony was sensing from this particular king.
"I also know that when Thanos snapped his fingers, the effects rippled across the entire universe," added Carol.
This is not his first Championship meet, the State High School finals, or even the Olympic Trials.  This is the Olympics.  The very pinnacle of elite swimming competition.  And while Steve knows that he’s as prepared for this race as he’ll ever be, it’s still impossible for him to pretend that it’s ‘just another race’.
"No, Peter, it's not nothing," Gwen said with a sigh. She ducked down, forcing Peter to meet her eyes. "You got upset like this earlier too, at lunch when Ned was talking, so don't try and tell me it's nothing. I want to help you."
He had just managed to find a hallway that appeared to lead towards the garage when he heard a rather gruff male voice coming from the slightly open door of a nearby room. Peter decided that it was likely Liz's father's office or something, and was just about to continue on his way when he suddenly heard the man mention his name.
"Knowing her, I'm sure it is," Steve said as they arrived at the door to Peter's room, slightly cracked open as per his usual. He rapped his knuckles three times on the doorway. "Hey, little guy, can we come in?"
this thing just doesn't wanna give up the ghost!" Clint grumbled as he fired yet another electric arrow at the monster, managing to hit its arm just as it was about to slam into Tony. Tony quickly doubled back as the creature roared, hitting it with his repulsors but still not managing to cause enough damage to destroy it.
—but they still happened far too often, and nothing they tried seemed to completely help him. Whether it was therapeutic massage, white noise, a new sleeping medication concocted by Bruce, or one of Thor's ancient Asgardian slumbering chants, nothing was able to keep the demons at bay for longer than a few nights, leaving them right back where they started and completely frying Tony and Steve's nerves in the process.
A flash of movement along the far right side of the lake caught the corner of Tony's eye then—either a person or an animal, he wasn't quite sure—drawing his gaze away from Peter just long enough to miss him hitting the surface of the water so hard that the impact echoed across the lake. Tony cried out in panic as Peter promptly disappeared beneath the rippling water, with Steve releasing his rope only a split-second later to dive in after him. Tony immediately spun the boat around, nearly capsizing it when an eerie, ear-splitting cracking noise suddenly cut through the air, raising all of the hair on the back of his neck.
"I'll always be here," Tony said on a moan as Steve tightened his hold, sending bolts of electric pleasure shooting throughout Tony's body. They were pressed so closely together that Tony honestly couldn't tell where he ended and Steve began, with Steve's chest like a hot brand against his back. "Shit, honey, I'm—I'm getting close!"
"Colonel Phillips and Mr Stark are down prepping the equipment in the procedure room right now," said Carol. "It should only take them about an hour or so, and then…" She paused, biting down on her lip. "Colonel Phillips did tell us that if the Phoenix mission hadn't been successful, there's no way we would've had the necessary power to complete the procedure."
"Oh, now that smells amazing," Steve said as Natasha set the pie down on a cooling rack, right next to another identical pie.
"You're welcome." She tucked Peter's blankets up to his chest. "I'm very sorry that I upset you, my dear."
"Nah, it's okay," Tony said quickly. "I'll be the first to admit that Pete's unique abilities have come in pretty handy lately, and you know he likes to feel useful, so…"
"So you think I should make the width of the containment vessel five millimetres instead of four?" Peter asked, marking a note next to his brand-new drawing. "That'll end up making the whole thing about ten percent heavier, which'll—"
Tony's jaw dropped into his lap. He wasn't sure what he'd been expecting Steve to say, but it sure as hell hadn't been
"Thank you," Steve said softly. With a final look at the pager, Steve turned to leave, nearly slamming into a blonde-haired woman who was standing about three metres behind him.
"Ah, whenever it is it won't be able to stack up to these babies," said Rogers. "Pretty sure we've hit the jackpot with these."
He reread the sentence again, trying to jog his memory, letting out a loud groan as the thought parked itself on the tip of his brain and refused to budge. He raked a frustrated hand through his hair as he read it for a third time, slowly.
"Now remember, I want you to rest as much as possible," Steve said as he touched Tony's cheek, relieved to find that his skin was already a bit cooler. "You promised."
"We're just gonna work on homework and eat dinner," Peter said a few seconds later. "It's not that big of a deal."
"I think that's fine, sweetheart," said Steve. "And then if it comes down to it, I'll—I'd like to talk to him personally again before—"
Tony scoffed, but nodded anyway. "Yes, Captain," he said with a smirk. "Probably the only way you'll let me leave the kitchen, yeah?"
, Tony. And as soon as Captain Rogers and Captain Danvers get back from their mission, the entire world will know as well."
Dr Strange had told them only a few minutes before Thanos showed up, and Peter was nearly strangled to death in the battle that followed. Dr Strange had said that he'd viewed fourteen million, six hundred and five possible outcomes, and that the Avengers had been victorious in only two of them.
“No, I’m not.”  Slowly, Steve takes the bottle from Tony, placing it on the floor.  Then he cradles Tony’s hand between his own, trailing his thumb across his knuckles.
Of course, no one had seen fit to tell him anything yet, but Peter could sense it anyway. He could hear it in the way all the adults had suddenly started whispering as soon as Colonel Phillips's press conference ended, when they had all been talking normally only a couple hours before. He could see it in the way Grandma's and Uncle Bucky's eyes glanced in his direction when they thought he wasn't looking, their faces all twisted and worried.
Steve's heart was as full as his stomach as he stood up so Tony could take his turn, whispering something into his ear that made Peter giggle, even in his half-asleep state. Steve's heart nearly swelled out of his chest as he watched Tony tuck Peter's fluffy blankets up over his shoulder, like he was still the tiny eleven-year-old kid that Steve had first met in that hateful Afghanistan desert.
A world record that still stands, actually.  If Steve was able to take one miniscule victory from his Olympic debacle sixteen months ago, it’s that Alexei Shostakov didn't even come close to breaking his world-record time.
Rummaging around in the bathroom, Tony found a small can of shaving foam and a brand-new razor, no doubt courtesy of Happy since the razor was the exact same type that he used. Steve's beard was so long and matted that Tony had to use scissors first, clipping away the smelly, filthy whiskers before lathering Steve's cheeks and chin with the foam. It took Tony almost an hour to finish, as careful as he was to not press too hard on Steve's broken cheekbone. But once he was done and had rinsed the last remnants of the shaving cream away, Tony's breath caught in his throat as he looked down at his husband, his eyes still glued to Tony's face.
The screen blinked, displaying the photograph of a female Level 12 Agent who was a personal lackey of SHIELD bigwig, Alexander Pierce, with the next photo one of Pierce himself.  Tony scoffed as Pierce’s cold, lined face came into focus, rolling his eyes as he muttered, “Figures” under his breath.  He had only met the man once, not too long after the Chitauri invasion, when Pierce had invited the team to D.C. in order to give them his thanks in person.  Pierce had no sooner stepped inside the massive conference room where the team had assembled when Tony’s suspicions were piqued, and he’d decided not three seconds later that the man reminded him way too much of Obadiah Stane to ever be considered trustworthy.
It made sense, Tony had to admit, and even more so given Steve's lack of relationship experience. He just wouldn't know how to play the stupid mind-games that some people enjoyed when chasing a prospective partner.
"Oh, and having Thor's giant axe embedded in his chest didn't have anything to do with that, right?" retorted Tony.
what the hell? I've only been talking to you for like the last ten minutes and you've barely even acknowledged my existence," Ned said, popping the chip into his mouth. "It's like you're always in space or something lately, what's going on?"
he said, the words so garbled they were unintelligible as Tony bobbed up and down, licking and sucking just the way he knew Steve loved, his free hand sliding under Steve's ass to tease at his crack. It had only been a few seconds, but he was already so close he knew he couldn't hold on any longer. "
"So, that was fun, hmm?" Bucky said once they had finally returned to the hangar. "Nothing like getting shot at every ten seconds to get your heart pumping a bit?"
"Yeah, I bet. And I thought my brothers were bad," said Gwen. She bit off part of a shrimp, chewing it slowly. "Speaking of my brothers, they keep asking me when you're gonna come over again. Especially Simon, he seems pretty smitten with you."
"Indeed, Captain," said JARVIS. "I can assure you that neither of these young men were aware of the final product."
"You know I'm not really supposed to be telling you this stuff though, right?" Tony added. "So I'd kinda appreciate it if you'd keep it a secret until Colonel Phillips makes the announcement."
Steve smiled against Tony's neck, sending a bolt of pleasure down Tony's spine. "You're the genius, sweetheart. I'm sure you can figure it out."
"Tell them my dad will buy the tickets," Peter said. He'd offer to drive the three of them as well, but knowing his dads, they'd probably say no.
I can’t wait to see what you think!  Please don’t forgot to hit the kudos button and leave me a comment!  💖
"All right," Peter said once everything was up and running. "JARVIS, no one comes into this room except for me, understand?"
"I'll make sure that he does," said Tony. He offered Sam his hand, which Sam gratefully took. "I can be pretty persuasive when I want to be."
“I don't want you just sitting there and staring at me,” Peter cut in.  “I’m fine, and I know you probably have work to do, so… just please go on and do it.”
"Oh yeah? And how long did you and Sam wait?" Steve demanded, regretting the question almost as soon as it left his mouth. "Wait, you don't have to answer—"
"It was ten months ago," said Steve. He, of course, knew exactly how many days—even how many hours—it had been, but didn't feel that was a necessary addition to the conversation. "Almost exactly ten months."
And, one of Tony's absolute favourites, watching as his husband and son worked together in the kitchen to prepare their meals, listening to their goofy, never-ending banter while he sat at their table finalising the designs for whatever latest thing Colonel Phillips was asking of him.
A point he had experienced again after the snap, on the day he feared he had not only lost his son, but also his husband. The day that he punched his shield.
"Definitely," answered Peter, watching carefully as Papa pinned the pretty purple violet to his lapel. Dad and Papa had asked Grandma to be in charge of organising the flowers for the wedding, and Peter had to admit that she had done a wonderful job. The arrangements of violets, daisies, and lilies that flanked each row of the chairs set up outside by the lake were really pretty, as were the various bouquets that she'd had placed as centrepieces on the round tables set up near the buffet area.
And Tony, being the incredible man that he was, instead of berating Steve for waking him or tearing the hell out of his expensive designer sheets, had simply gathered Steve close, holding his head against his chest as he ran his fingers through his hair.  Once Steve had felt able to release the iron grip on his limbs, Tony had led him into the bathroom, right into the hot bath that JARVIS had run for them.  They’d ended up staying in the steaming water so long that Steve fell asleep, his back pressed up against Tony’s chest and his head resting against Tony’s neck, not waking until JARVIS announced that it was time for Peter to get to school.
"I didn't get a name," Sharon said. "But that also meant that I didn't want to risk asking for it either. I've had Captains Wilson and Barnes in here with Peter for most of the day today because I felt it was in Peter's best interests, so if I was wrong about that, I apologise."
"This is the last part, sweetheart," Steve said. He suppressed a shudder at the memory of being sealed up inside that scary metal thing that had felt way too much like a coffin for his comfort.
"God, I've missed you so much, mo grá," Steve rasped as he kissed down Tony's jaw to his neck. "It's been so long, and I need you so badly. Le do thoil, an féidir liom tú a bheith agat?"
"Yeah, I'm not sure how much of it is just the temp though," Tony muttered under his breath. He pressed his lips to Steve's cheek by his ear, whispering, "Gotta get you in there, babe. Doctor's orders, okay?"
The whole team was there. Even Gamora, Nebula, and Rocket, the three remaining Guardians of the Galaxy, were there to witness the experiment.
The team had been able to rule out most of Western Europe thanks to both Fury's connections and Pepper's popularity as the Stark Industries chief executive officer, leaving Africa, Antarctica, and the coastal regions of the mainland U.S. left to search. Fury had already started working with his connections in Africa, and while Tony wouldn't put it past HYDRA to have a base in Antarctica, there were far too many other bases and outposts scattered along the coastal areas of the continent to really be able to hide another.
But Steve had told Tony that he was in love with him, and Tony had told Steve the same. And despite his nearly crushing anger and hurt, he still was.
There was a pause as Dad turned away, typing furiously on his keyboard as Peter struggled with what to say next. He hadn't planned on getting into yet another argument, especially since his long-awaited weekend date with Gwen was supposed to start tomorrow. But he just couldn't stay quiet anymore. Despite everything that he and Papa were trying to do for Dad, none of it seemed to be helping, and he was only getting worse.
"It would've been a waste of parts!" Thanos snapped as he swung his massive fist, sending Nebula sailing backwards right into Gamora's arms. A second later Dr Strange conjured up a set of long, red ropes, wrapping them around Thanos' hand in an attempt to force him to open his fist.
"Yeah, that's exactly what they're doing," Steve said as he turned to King T'Challa. "Your Highness? I really think we need to keep them in front of us."
I screwed up so bad!  I should’ve never left you like I did, that was not the right way to handle that at all.  I love you, and Pete loves you, and we both wanna help you get the help that you need.”
"Mmm. Love you," Peter mumbled as his eye closed again. Steve's heart swelled to the point of bursting then Peter smacked his lips, his arms tightening around his polar bear.
Sliding his arm into the right side steering gimbal, Dad jerked his head towards the opposite side. "Get your hand in there and close the top around it. This was meant for one big guy, so we gotta move at the same time, yeah?"
Peter shook his head, almost daring his mind to disprove what JARVIS was saying as he reread the page.
The entire drive to the bookstore, Tony had been psyching himself up for telling Steve about what happened, preparing to ask him to accompany Tony to Obie’s office sometime in the next week and inform Obie that there was no way they were going to bow to such disgusting demands.
"Well," Tony said, his voice cracking on the word. He cleared his throat, trying again. "Well, I have a feeling you might be right about that,
The voracity of his thought both surprised and ashamed Peter, but not enough to want to take it back. Besides the fact that he had been forced to suffer with a repairable condition for most of his life, he had also had to watch the government constantly tease and torture his own father because of him, running him so thoroughly into the ground that before Papa came along, Peter had been honestly worried that Dad might just drop of a heart attack one day from all of the stress, and that would be it.
The woman gave an almost mechanical nod as she pressed her right palm against Steve's window, filling the cell with the bright red light that he realised a second too late meant that his mind was about to get even more scrambled.
"Eh, now's fine, I got a few minutes," said Tony. "And if I see anything funky I'll just set up a quick meeting with Beck and go from there. Sound okay?"
"God, that's so hot," Tony breathed, his palms landing flat against Steve's chest as Steve cupped his cheek, bringing their lips together in a bruising kiss. Any fear that might've been lingering in the back of his mind about Peter was quickly forgotten as Tony's hands moved around to Steve's back and slid down to slip underneath his t-shirt.
"As a grandma should, yeah?" Tony said sadly. "Pete never got to meet my parents either, but… I know my mom would've loved him. It's not fair that he only had me for so long. Well, me and Rhodey. Rhodey adores him, loves him as an uncle, but it's still not the same, ya know? Obie had the chance, but… the asshole just never took it."
"I love you," he whispered, first into Tony's hair, then into Peter's, pressing kisses to both of their heads before tipping his own head back and closing his eyes.
“It only counts if you're a Jedi Master, Dad,” Peter said as he stepped out of the car.  He hesitated before closing the door, shaking his head a couple seconds later.  “Have a good day.”
"Not quite, but at least it's a bit better now," Peter answered. He pecked her quickly on the forehead, brushing his thumb across her cheekbone just as the bell started to ring, nearly causing him to jump out of his skin. He cried out as he slapped his hands over his ears, barely able to regain some of his composure as Gwen took his elbow, guiding him into their classroom.
And then there were Steve’s nightmares.  And the daytime flashbacks, which, as much as Tony hated to admit it, were getting worse almost by the day.  It was horrible for Tony to watch the man that he loved suddenly become so consumed by thoughts and visions from his life as a soldier.  Horrible to have to just sit there helpless as Steve clamped his hands over his ears and dug his fingertips into his scalp to the point of drawing blood, all while begging him to please,
As soon as O'Brien returned the salute Steve turned on his heel and headed for the exit, his mind racing at MACH-1 as he headed back towards the barracks. Colonel Phillips had informed him that he could take his usual place in the patrol shift once he was done meeting with the general, but he needed to change first. There was no way he could comfortably fly while wearing his bulky dress uniform.
"Okay, that may be," said Steve. "But if Thanos happened to get his hands on the Time Stone, couldn't he then do the same? Couldn't he rewind things to the Battle of New York, for example? Change things so that the missile hits the city instead of his fleet." Steve's heart swooped as soon as the words left his mouth, remembering his horror as he watched Tony fly through the portal carrying that missile on his back.
Tony gasped as the house came into view. Steve had obviously arranged for it to get a new paint job and some new landscaping as well, as it looked almost brand-new as Sam pulled into the driveway.
"Okay, fine," Peter said instead. He fiddled with his blankets for a second, trying to decide if he should ask. It'd been awhile since he'd needed Dad to help him fall asleep, but… the nightmares had just been so bad lately, so…
And the last thing that Steve was aware of was the sound of heavy footsteps crunching along the rocky path, right before he felt a burning hot
The fact that the company’s stock tended to drop if too much time passed between unveilings was a secondary issue, but, according to Obie, only barely.
Wanda's eyebrows knitted together as she looked Peter up and down. "How would you be able to help the Avengers?"
"Are you gonna have your new car there at the Tower?" Ned asked excitedly. "Are your dads gonna let you drive yourself to school now?"
"Copy that, JARVIS." Steve stuffed the rest of his protein bar into his mouth as he readied his finger over the trigger.
"You're not sure if we can really trust anyone in a law enforcement position right now," Tony finished. "Right?"
"As long as you don't forget to get some sleep," Steve gently said, even though he knew it was pointless. The few times that Steve had had to substitute on the overnight shift, Tony didn't sleep a wink the whole night. He never liked it when Steve had to fly in the dark.
, don't go!” Steve cried.  He reached his hand towards Tony, gasping when Tony backed away.  “I’m sorry!  Oh God, I’m so sorry!  Please!  Don't… don't go!”
"There, there," Grandma said, patting his back. She held out a glass of water. "Take a drink now, okay?"
And while it wasn't much, it was still enough to give Steve the proverbial kick in the pants that he needed to give his team what he hoped was an encouraging nod. Then he raised his own shield and planted his feet, preparing to fight.
“Okay, so… what do you want me to do?” Tony asks as he circles around again.  “I’m pretty sure I can take whatever might be in there—”
"No, but you only missed Ms Warren saying your name three separate times before she finally got your attention," Gwen said gently. She leaned closer, lowering her voice. "And with how well you can hear, that's saying something."
"That's my boy," Steve said proudly. "That does still mean that you need to stay out of our room until Dad's feeling better though, okay? We can't risk you getting whatever he's got."
"Yeah, 'cept the funniest thing about that is that it was actually true," Peter said. He suppressed a shudder, thinking about how different everything was now only nine weeks out from Project Phoenix. Not only had both Langara and Meridia recently held free elections for the first time in thirty years, but the entire overall mission of the Air Corps had been changed to reflect their new world. Instead of roughly ninety-eight percent of the focus being on military hardware, Colonel Phillips had presented Dad and Papa with the task of developing a commercial airline system, complete with airports placed at strategic areas around the planet, new passenger airliners designed to ferry people to the different areas, many of which had already begun to build various attractions and temporary housing units, and even some smaller aircraft to provide interested citizens the chance to learn how to fly without being required to join the Air Corps.
A slow smile spread across Tony's lips as he burrowed further into Steve's side, breathing in the delicious vanilla scent of his skin. Warm fuzzies flooded Tony's body as he recalled how tender and loving Steve had been with him the night before. They had started out with a bubble bath in the huge sunken tub in the master bathroom, complete with glasses of champagne and several of the chocolate-covered strawberries that Steve and Peter had dipped earlier that day. Once the water had grown too cool for their liking, Steve had lifted Tony from the tub and carried him to their bed, where he'd proceeded to make love to him as passionately as if it had been their very first time.
“Yeah, it does,” Peter agreed.  “The only question now is, who’re they being sent to?  ‘Cause it’s definitely not our guys.  Steve told me that his entire team was almost taken out by one of those explosions, and his best friend even lost his arm!”
“Hey, Mr Rogers!” Peter exclaims, jumping to his feet as soon as Steve steps out onto the pool deck.  “How was your day today?”
"No, it's code for 'your papa is hungry and wants to go and eat large quantities of pizza'," Tony retorted. "Which is exactly what we're gonna do!"
"Oh God, Pete," Tony gasped as he pulled Peter into a tight hug, burying his nose into his green-apple-scented curls. "Buddy, you're so young, it's just so goddamn wrong that you're having to deal with any of this in the first place."
“Mmm, we’ll see,” Tony says.  Then he smoothes the curls away from Peter’s forehead and plants a kiss there, just like he’s done ever since Peter was a baby.  “I love you, buddy.”
"I think that's a great idea," Peter said. He gave Dad a big hug, then reached for Papa, burying his nose into his neck. "Promise me that you'll listen to Dad and actually rest, okay? Even super soldiers need to heal."
“And why do you think this guy…?” Tony broke off, cursing internally for already forgetting the guy’s name.  “Um…”
And knowing that his husband, who Steve loved more than life itself, was literally willing himself to waste away because of it, was only pouring massive amounts of salt on an open, festering wound.
"Yeah, especially since everyone else is waiting in the living room so they can gawk at you." Tony clapped Peter on the shoulder, giving it a slight squeeze. "C'mon Casanova, let's not keep the lady waiting."
Steve exclaimed, so loudly that the cadet up in the front of the room shot to her feet, standing at attention.
Whatever it was, it wasn't good for Dad to try and keep it all bottled up. The three of them had already been there, done that with Papa, and it had been an unmitigated disaster.
Actually, now that he thought about it, Tony often had various books strewn about his workplaces at home, as did Peter, and actually Steve often did as well, but that was because he still felt more comfortable with books than electronic references, not because he was a genius.
"Oh my God," Steve whispered, dropping his head. "No, no, no, this can't be happening. This can't be happening!"
And, since the weather had been absolutely glorious since they'd arrived, topping out around thirty Celsius every day with plenty of bright sunshine, Steve's most common state of dress had been a pair of swim trunks, tight, ab-outlining t-shirt or sexy-as-hell, shoulders-bearing tank top optional.
The dim image of the Georgia coastline suddenly appeared on Peter's laptop, not much more than waves crashing against rocks and the occasional seagull.
"That's what I thought," he said. "So why don't I go make us something to eat while you tell me more about this idea of yours?"
Sam gave a nod, stepping up right next to Peter while Bucky leaned in, whispering something into his ear.
"Yes, because Peter is half-god, like he said. But it still nearly ripped us all apart, and that was just one of them," Gamora said grimly. "And like Drax said, Thanos isn't interested in using the stones to better himself. He's only interested in his goal."
Steve thinks as he slams his left arm into the water, bringing it down across his body as his right arm follows suit.  His tricep muscles feel like they’re on fire, his feet and ankles nearly numb from their efforts to propel him through the water.  It’s what Phillips likes to call the ‘wall before the wall’, that dreaded tightening up of Steve’s muscles that always occurs about twenty to twenty-five metres from the end of the race.  Steve scrunches his nose as he turns his face to his left side and takes his final breath, pulling as much air into his burning lungs as he possibly can to fuel him for the final stretch.
"The point is that we can still keep this from happening to anyone else," Peter said, as firmly as he was able. His chest was feeling tight again, and the last thing he wanted was for his heart monitor to start beeping and get Dad even more worried.
There have been plenty of gold medals won over the years because one swimmer out-touched a competitor.
For twenty-eight years and a few months, General O'Brien and his administration had been playing both sides against the middle, keeping both the military and civilian populations oppressed by a constant state of war, all because he wanted to gather and keep as much power as he possibly could.
"Yeah, yeah, I got some stuff set to move in about twenty minutes 'bout a half a kilometre from here. Don't worry, I said I'd get it moved and I'm gonna get it moved. But now all the convoys are at a halt because someone got a little too interested in the numbers, so until they start moving again, there's not really much I can do. We just gotta wait it out. Shouldn't be too long, though, Stark's too damn impatient for the delay to last too long."
he imagined Tony saying, complete with the infamous Stark scowl that Steve had witnessed multiple times on all three of the Stark men he'd known. "
It was Brock Rumlow, the very same man who had tried to hold Peter hostage inside a Washington D.C. SHIELD building during the Chitauri invasion. And all this time, Steve had thought he had died during the Battle of the Triskelion.
"What's wrong?" Gwen asked as they stepped into the lunchroom, her voice laced with concern. "Are you okay?"
"Me either," Peter said as he let out a huge yawn. He had been stressing all day about Dad and Steve, wondering if Dad was gonna keep being a dummy about things or if he'd suck it up and make up with him, and now that Peter knew they were okay all he wanted was to go to sleep.
“Yes, we did,” Steve murmured into Tony’s hair, his tears wetting the strands.  “Oh God, Tony, this—this just means so
Steve's heart gave a painful lurch. "Um, with all due respect, Your Highness, as you may have noticed, our team is not currently complete. One of Thanos' minions managed to take both my husband and my son prisoner aboard one of his smaller ships, so I don't believe that we should underestimate what we're about to face. Based on what Bruce has told us, Thanos will not rest until the Soul Stone is his."
you, Barton!" Tony called as Steve made a very poor attempt to adjust himself. "You think you're so damn funny, don't ya?"
"Mmm," Tony moaned against Steve's skin as he reached into Steve's bedside table, searching for the bottle of lube that hadn't seen the light of day for months and handing it to Steve. Steve's hands were shaking as he flipped open the cap, pouring a generous amount on his first two fingers while Tony shucked out of his pants, throwing his head back with a guttural groan as Steve slowly pressed his slick fingers inside him.
"I hate to say it, Tones, but she does kinda have a point," Rhodey said from his spot on the other end of the couch. "If there really is a fortress out there that we can't see but Peter can, then no one's gonna know the best way to get in there than he is, and—"
Steve's belly gave a hard swoop at the mention of the bunker, and he swallowed hard, prompting Tony to grab his hand.
“I love you too,” Steve said as another tear trailed down his cheek.  “So much.  Tony, I can’t even tell you—”
"Do you have to call me Stevie?" Steve grumbled as he slid into the seat next to Bucky. "Makes me sound like some singer in a band or something."
"Now wait just a minute," said Clint. "So you're telling me this is just another one of your Asgardian bedtime stories?"
"And why was that, sir?" Steve asked. He was only barely clinging to his temper, and the fact that his stomach was now almost continuously growling wasn't helping.
Peter shook his head, closing his eyes. "No, I can wait till we get home," he said, stifling a yawn. "Just tired."
"See, he's not dying," Howard said as he poked Peter again, causing him to grimace beneath his mask. "You can't be dying if you're still ticklish, and he's definitely still ticklish."
"And what I also know," she continued. "Is that the sins of a father should never be passed along to his son." She glanced up at Steve, her eyes softening slightly. "And I also know that I've never seen my son so happy in his entire life, which he assures me is mainly the doing of both yourself and a certain young man with whom I'll be shortly making my acquaintance."
"I'll give you a little while longer, okay?" she said as she adjusted the alarms on his monitors. "But only a little while."
"Come in?" he said, expecting to see either Natasha, Bruce, or James, or even Nebula, the blue android-like girl who had accompanied Tony on the ship home. She and her sister were staying in one of the guest suites at the Compound and had mainly kept to themselves since their arrival, aside from Nebula's occasional check-in to see how Tony was doing.
The fact that Steve was apparently living through history in the making yet again was never far from his mind.  Discovering that HYDRA had been embedded inside SHIELD ever since the late 1940s, and had managed to trickle down into every single part of the organisation had led to several changes that Steve was still getting accustomed to.
"No, I've been here about a half hour," Dad said. "You just looked so cute laying there that I didn't want to wake you."
And as he drifted off, his fingers intertwined with Tony's and Tony's warm breath against his neck, Steve knew without a doubt that he was loved, and that Tony had his back, no matter what.
He’s wasted so much time languishing in despair over HYDRA and Bucky, when he could’ve been taking Natasha and Peter’s advice and asked Tony out on an actual date.
"I know," Steve said softly, his cheeks blushing an adorable shade of pink. "But the Mediterranean is clear and warm and sunny, nothing like the water that I was… frozen in." He didn't say frozen in
Tony gave his head a hard shake, trying to find some shred of sense in the nonsense conversation and failing completely. "Oh, well, then I'd say that'd be pretty good practise for fighting against Thanos, don't you think?"
"Yes, sir!" he said firmly. He cleared his throat as he pushed down on the throttle, resuming the speed needed to exit the atmosphere. "JARVIS, can you please recalculate our exit points?"
Especially when he knew that Peter would much rather be able to see his own father than some person he'd only just met.
"Steve," the voice said again, this time a bit louder and more insistent. Once again, Steve ignored it, remaining locked in place on the ash-covered ground, staring bleary-eyed at the remains of what used to be—
"Hey, kiddo," Ms Sharon said sadly as she came into the room, a telephone receiver in one hand. "It's your dad."
At Peter's insistence, they had called the hospital to check on George Stacy, whose wife had informed them that he had suffered only a broken pinky finger and a mild concussion and would be discharged the following day. Mrs Stacy had also thanked them profusely for both the security guards who were watching her children and what she called, "Peter's life-saving heroics," saying Gwen had told her that Peter had risked his own life to save her husband, and that if he or they needed anything at all to let her know.
"No," Steve repeated. He stepped back, leaning against his tall supply counter and crossing his arms. "Now, can you tell me how long it'll take to get the security drones up and running?"
"There have been no attempted firewall breaches since you implemented the new security protocols, sir," said JARVIS. "It appears you have scared them off."
Grandpa shook his head, laying a wrinkled hand on Peter's shoulder. "Ah don't worry about me, young man, it's you that we should be worried about. At least that's what Tony's always saying."
"No way I can say no to that," Steve wheezed, practically growling as Tony undid his belt and pants button, working his hand inside Steve's underwear before he'd even pulled them off.
"Good," Steve repeated. "Now, why don't we eat while it's hot, then you can explain to me what this contraption is?"
"Ah, yeah," Peter said after a short pause. He honestly had no idea even what day it was, only that he was due back at school soon. "Yeah, I'll be there."
"Yeah, I saw that firsthand with the tesseract," Steve said, remembering how the cube literally burned the Red Skull into ashes right before his eyes. "Okay, so, what are you suggesting we do about this?"
Thor reached for the last taco on the platter, breaking it in half. "Well, then it is settled. And I thank you again for allowing me to share in your evening meal with you, my wonderful friends."
"Peter, it's okay," Steve cut in as he reached for their joined hands, peeling Peter's fingers away from Tony's and wrapping them around his own. Tony's face was ashen, his beautiful eyes glassy and tortured as they locked with Steve's.
that it's almost unbelievable that people back then survived at all." He grabbed onto Uncle Bucky's hand and led him into the kitchen, showing him a book he had found at the library on early nineteenth century medical treatments.
"Oh, thank you!" Steve rasped, grabbing onto the counter as his knees threatened to give way. He had been trying so hard not to give up on the possibility that Tony and Peter might come home to him, but now there was actually a real chance, he found he could barely keep himself upright.
"No, no, little guy, it's okay," Steve said. He pressed his palm to his chest, over his thudding heart. "I think I just lost track of time is all."
"Which means all those other dudes are probably the ones searching for the stone then," said Sam. "Right?"
He definitely hadn't missed the way Anthony's eyes had looked him up and down, lingering just a second or so too long on his lips. Steve may have been a stranger to intimate relationships, but ever since his serum procedure he had most certainly experienced his fair share of getting checked out.
"Nuh uh, sexy man. I get to go first tonight," Tony said. He tapped Steve on the shoulder. "On your back for me, okay? I've been wanting to get my mouth on you all damn day, so you're just gonna have to let me."
He could build all of the tech that he wanted, but not even his most advanced drones or suits or nanites could deal with anything having to do with time, and it was starting to make Tony feel like he was slowly being backed into a two-sided triangle, stuck in a corner while facing down an invisible army against which he had no defence.
"Don't worry, Tony," he said softly. "Your secret is safe with me." Guilt sparked in his gut, just for a second before he was able to squash it down. Steve was very adept at keeping secrets, but it didn't take a Tony Stark-level genius to figure out that keeping a big secret from someone you were trying to begin a relationship with was probably not the best idea.
"Oh mo grá, I love you. You feel so amazing, I love you so much," Steve said as he brushed his lips across Tony's cheek, skimming his hand down Tony's arm to intertwine their fingers, bringing their joined hands up next to Tony's head. Tony's eyes fluttered closed as Steve's lips found that spot at the juncture of Tony's neck and shoulder, sucking another mark into his skin as he snapped his hips forward with a loud groan.
“Well…” Tony trails off, glancing around.  “I’m guessing this was like their trial area, kind of like a mini pocket dimension, but the fact that it’s still here and the Tesseract isn’t is what’s got me worried.”
"Well, I'm just sorry that we didn't know what was going on," added Papa. "Maybe we could've helped?"
"I could ask you the same goddamn thing!" cried Dad. He pressed his armored foot harder into the bald guy's chest. "'Cept I would've been a bit more polite about it!"
"I'll drive," answered Steve. With how little sleep Tony had gotten the night before, he didn't particularly want him trying to drive in the busy Midtown morning traffic.
Tossing his stuff onto a chair by the cool-down pool, Steve puts on his goggles and dives in, ignoring the now-annoying dull pain in his left shoulder as he takes a few long, easy strokes to cajole the lactic acid from his overworked muscles, his grin so wide it’s threatening to split his face.
"He wasn't, obviously. He'd just never slept that long in one stretch before, and I didn't know how to handle it. Pretty sure he didn't wake up until he'd finally peed through his diaper."
"Better security will help us all sleep better, babe," Tony cut in. "And I'm working as fast as I can, so—"
As soon as the monitor went blank Peter flopped backwards, so hard that he nearly bounced off the side of his bed. He felt bad for snapping at his dads since he knew that they called him because they missed him and didn't really need the added stress of thinking that Peter was mad at them, but
"Ah, you're just a big wuss!" said Dad from somewhere off to the side. "Lutefisk isn't near as bad as you keep saying!"
It was the same way that Dad had always been whenever Peter was sick as a little kid, and when Papa had been in the hospital after the Malibu house bombing and the Project Insight mess. He just couldn't rest when someone he loved was sick or hurt.
"No matter what," Tony said firmly. "I swore to him before I even brought him home that I'd do whatever it took to keep him safe. And I knew I'd make a million mistakes, and I have, 'cause hey, it's me. But I also knew even back then that Pete was something special. That someday, he'd blow us all away."
As soon as he hung up the phone Peter grabbed his notebook, flipping through the pages until he found the big question mark he'd scribbled there earlier. Of course it made a lot more sense for them to use an element to power their new satellite system that didn't require frequent replacement, and based on what he'd learned from Grandpa before everything started going to hell, the vibranium would work perfectly.
"Ah, no," Steve said, the dread he'd been trying to stamp down suddenly welling back up. Thanos' absence from their battlefield could only mean that he'd chosen to follow the Time Stone first, which meant—
“Um…” Peter added, doing a double-take as he checked the readings on the monitor.  “Ah, yep!  Everything looks good here!”
And Steve had been so distraught when he'd realised that he had lost his ring that Tony had made him a new one as soon as he was able to come home, sliding it onto Steve's finger just like he'd placed his original ring during their wedding ceremony.
"You make it sound like just some little thing," Steve said into Tony's hair. "But you always end up doing the most of any of us, and I don't think we ever appreciate you enough. And for that, I'm so sorry."
"Well, before you go diving in headfirst you just think about how your ma might react once she finds out you're lusting after a Stark, okay?" Bucky said, not without a hint of snark. "The guy may be good-looking but he's got enough baggage for a trip to the moon and back, so… maybe that'll be enough to help you think twice about it."
“This entire area is now under our purview, Captain, as you would call it,” says Thor.  “And so it is good, as Young Starkson absolutely insisted on accompanying the team on our return.”  He shoots Tony a rather funny look.  “In fact, he hardly slept at all while we worked.  If you ask me, he is quite the stubborn young lad.”
Steve impatiently bounces his legs as he sits in the corner of the on-deck room, waiting for his race to be called.  It’s already been over twenty minutes since he completed his warm-up, and while he bundled himself up as soon as he got out of the pool and still feels relatively loose, he knows that the longer he waits, the better the chances that his shoulder will tighten up.
“But I thought—”  Steve clamps down on his bottom lip before he can say something else wrong.  “Nevermind.”
"Okay, Tony, why don't you tell me what you need before you break something, hmm?" Rhodey said from his chair against the back wall. He had just returned to the Control Room after briefing Colonel Phillips on the situation, which had only lasted all of about three minutes because Tony still couldn't fucking figure out how to fix the goddamn problem.
I know this chapter is a bit shorter than the others, but I felt this was a good stopping place 😉  The next chapter will post by Friday, February 5th 😊
"Oh, just a little something I thought we could hang in our bedroom up at the Compound," Steve answered. He stepped back so Tony could get a closer look, and Tony couldn't help but feel a bit misty as his eyes swept across the practically life-like portrait of himself, Steve, and Peter, all sitting around the bonfire up at the Compound. The three of them were all smiles, with Tony's head resting on Steve's shoulder and Peter busy pulling apart an especially gooey roasted marshmallow, his huge brown eyes innocent and happy.
The penthouse was dark and empty as the elevator doors slid open, a painful contrast to the levity that had filled it just that morning, when the three of them had left for work and school.
It was Brooklyn, the street where he had grown up. And according to the newspapers being peddled a few metres away, the year was… 1924.
“Oh, yeah.  Sure,” Tony says, turning his gaze downward.  “Well… before we left on this mission, I had JARVIS download all of the files he could find on the Tesseract, and… according to what I’ve been able to find, the main theory on how the thing works is that it functions as sort of a doorway between universes.”
"Well, I suppose if you've gotta have a reason then that one's decent enough." Tony brought Steve's hand to his lips, kissing his knuckles. "Ready to go see our kid?"
"I was gonna ask him to marry me," Uncle Bucky sputtered, tears now flowing freely down his face. "I'd already bought the ring, and made the dinner reservations, and—and now… now there's just no way—"
“And he hasn’t been off by a single penny yet,” Steve said, his fingers firmly tucked around his belt.  “He’s a pretty smart kid.”
"I need some air," Peter suddenly said, standing to his feet so fast that he jiggled the coffee table housing the game, causing it to scrape across the wood floor and send an eerie shiver down his spine. Peter shivered again as his arms pebbled with goosebumps, and he wrapped his arms around his front, glancing down at Gwen and hoping she'd understand. "I'm okay, I'll—I'll just be back in a bit."
"My papa is the leader of the Avengers," he said evenly. "But the whole team works together. My dad designs and manufactures their equipment, Papa plans their missions, my Uncle Sam—"
Tony shrugged, running his tongue across his bottom lip. "Eh, I can understand the guy wanting to be with his kid. And that feeling of being trapped into something that you're damn good at even if you know it's not quite right… you know, I've been there, done that."
“Yeah, baby, that’s it.  I wanna see it,” Tony rasped into Steve’s neck, his thrusts already starting to falter.  “C’mon, Steve!  Come for me!”
But while a bit of salt could improve the taste of something, too much would effectively ruin it. So as much as Steve had been tempted, he knew that he couldn't abandon his team now. Not when literally the entire universe was depending on them.
In fact, Tony had reiterated to Peter just that morning that he could buy whatever he wanted so long as it was something he knew he’d be allowed to read, an instruction Peter had been all too happy to agree to.  He had also promised Tony that he would do his homework at the school before heading over to the bookstore, a pact that so far he hadn't broken once.
Davis's slimy smile wavered just a bit. "Yes, well I'm sure that's true. I do have some questions for you, Captain, regarding how you came to be enlisted in the Army back in 1941." He pretended to shuffle some of the papers in front of him, folding his hands over the stack.
"Oh, shit!" Peter cried as he dropped down, curling his fingers into the damp sand and spreading it over his body up to his neck. He held his breath as the machine flew overhead, letting it out in little puffs when its course didn't alter even a millimetre.
Tony waved an impatient hand. "Yeah, yeah, enough about that. What exactly did Pete design you to do?"
Steve thought with a firm shake of his head. He couldn't afford to think like that. Not now, not when everyone was looking to him to lead the most important mission he'd ever led in his life.
, once we get home, you are going to be grounded until you're at least eighteen! And maybe even longer!"
How many hours had passed since he had last seen his father? It'd been when Dad had dropped Peter and Gwen off at their restaurant for dinner before the dance, so only about twelve hours, give or take a few minutes. Was that really long enough for HYDRA to grab him and transport him down here? And if so, where was the rest of the team? Were they all here too?
After they went and visited Peter, of course, which, despite his overall exhaustion, Tony couldn't help but admit he was very much looking forward to. Without the worry of getting to the hospital and then leaving again before curfew hanging over him, Tony's shoulders already felt at least three tons lighter.
“I am the luckiest guy in the entire world,” he added.  He brought Tony’s hand to his lips, kissing it over the ring.  “Thank you, sweetheart.”
Clipping Steve's ID to the front of his shirt, Tony made his way swiftly towards the mess hall, handlamp in hand just in case the lights went out before he was able to get back. Being so close to curfew the mess hall was already closed for the evening, with only the cleaning crew still inside as Tony filled a bag with enough food for his own personal army, knowing that as he healed Steve's appetite would be even bigger than usual.
If anything, Howard started drinking even more, leaving him even more vulnerable to the near-constant whispers from Obadiah Stane.  Whispers saying that unless Howard did something soon to “protect the company”, it was going to be yanked right out from beneath his feet.
Steve Rogers, the skinny, asthmatic kid from Brooklyn who never went a day without getting picked on by bullies is now not only a Summa Cum Laude graduate from Camp LeHigh University and in a relationship with a great guy, he is also an Olympic champion.
Steve had told Tony several times that the complete elimination of HYDRA had been the original mission of Captain America during the war, and that he fully intended to see it through.
In fact, he'd even told Steve that before their first time, he had always kept his shirt on during sex.
"Yeah." Tony leaned back, raising his arms over his head to try and stretch out his tight shoulders. "Well, I'm gonna keep poking around down here, see what else I can find. May as well have as much evidence as possible for the court martials, right?"
