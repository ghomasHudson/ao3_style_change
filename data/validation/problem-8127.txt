"Yeah, shame about Rex, though."
"I'm in hell," said Tony to himself.
"...Pietro," she said, softly, a hint of panic in her voice.  "...I need to see you in the bathroom.
People sort of seemed to be enjoying themselves. Banksy was positively hyper and Donner hung on his every word. Boswell seemed content by himself. Rhodey was finishing pouring out drinks and half stuttered an apology when he accidentally elbowed Sam as he was offering Pepper a glass. Sam laughed, clearly amused at how he pushed the Alpha just outside of his comfort zone.
"Oh!  Oh, geez!  Oh my gosh, Beth and Daston are upstairs, should I--"
"Just lock this room and leave me with loads of water. And some food. And I'll be fine," Steve said. It was all he could think to say. But it wouldn't be fine. It would probably be agony.
"My designs?" repeated Tony.
It occurred to Tony that his birthday was only a few weeks away.  He'd be turning 93.
"I guess...I guess it is supposed to be fashionable to turn up late to a party," Steve murmured, his resolve totally non-existent at this point. Perhaps Tony was a 'bad influence' sometimes but Steve had a high sex drive (presumably because of the serum) and was almost always up for it.
Tony's stomach twisted.  Right. That guy. The one he'd smashed into the wall.
Tony wanted Steve.  Steve was looking up to him, and Tony knew, right then, that he could take him if he wanted, as his omega... that they were
. It's just this... this hot, homey mess.  If your smell were a painting, it'd be a Normal Rockwell. Seriously.  You're so...
Tony mulled over his can of Tecate.
Tony answered.  "What'd you want, Happy?  I'm on a hiatus right now."
Building and wearing suits made him feel safe, grounded in reality.  But it wasn't just that.  Tony was always improving them, trying to predict the next thing he'd need.  When the suits failed him, he took it personally.  He expected them to be invincible and all-purpose.
He was lost enough in thought that he wandered into the living room and kitchenette in his towel, forgetting all about DeSoto.  He winced a little at the way those big, chocolate--brown eyes turned to him, and he resisted the urge to cover up his arc reactor.  He had grown used to wearing a towel slung low on his hips around Steve. That was how he'd worn towels before Afghanistan. Afterwards, he had always worn them under the arms.  But Steve had turned the arc reactor into a thing of beauty. Also, it was no longer slowly killing him, so he felt a bit more comfortable about it. But he didn't like when strangers ogled.
"Fuck!  Get the reactor!  Get the reactor!" he yelled, clawing uselessly at the other man.  Trying to bite him, trying to find some vulnerable spot.
He was watching Donner go and he felt powerless. He felt useless. George had told him last night, they'd saved 1,781 kids in total. But the number wasn't registering. All he could see was Donner walking out that door and back into the arms of a man who was going to hurt him again.
He took a look at his handiwork.  The tulips were properly obscured by a wall of enormous orchids.  He gave a little nod to the flowers and then flopped back onto the couch with a wince.
"But... but what if I could help him? Help him get better?" Steve asked.
Oh no. No, no, no.
He tried to obey the order, but it was easier said than done.  His dander refused to go down and he couldn't help that. Especially when it looked like they were all getting into the back of the same vehicle, an old Soviet cargo truck, the back covered with a black tarpaulin, two benches facing each other.  He had a weird idea that he'd sat in the back of a military vehicle like this before, him and a bunch of guys, laughing, on their way somewhere in Europe.
“Hey, I’m not on shift right now.  I think it’s Sitwell’s turn to keep tabs on the Iron Man.”
His phone rang.  Tony reached blindly into his back pocket and turned it off.  Tony had a lot of well-wishers but really, there were only a precious few he gave a shit about, and right now, his attention was thoroughly fixed on Steve.  He hated when Steve was coy. Well... loved it and hated it.
It had been two hours since Steve had left.  Unbeknownst to either of them, they'd returned around the same time.  Upstairs, Steve downed three glasses of water straight away, a little sweaty from the heat and the sun, but content with it too.  The best workouts were ones that left him worn out; he felt better already. Steve headed down to the workshop as he finished his fourth glass of water, knocking once before he stepped inside.
Sure, he never had a dad but he could appreciate the embarrassment of a supposed authority figure walking in on them. Steve liked the private to stay private, and all that.
Tony's mouth flooded and Steve leaned forward; Tony couldn't have pulled away if he wanted to.  He swallowed, gripping Steve hard, Steve jerking and twitching in his mouth.
"Oh, God..." Steve slumped down and soon slid down to the floor, bending over himself. He could hear footsteps. Friend or foe? He couldn't tell. His senses had gone haywire. He breathed out slowly, trying to focus. Steve lifted up his head, his vision fuzzy. It took a moment for it to clear.
now. You're the insight into the country's favourite sweetheart."
"Oh."  Steve's shoulders slumped.  He looked over at Aria.  "...what are you looking at?" he demanded defensively, eyeing her.  "If it ain't Ella Fitzgerald, who is it?  Who's the entertainment? Is it that Avicii guy?  'Cause I don't know who that is."
"Yeah, yeah, yeah.  ...so the bonding glands, those don't heal, once they're broken?"
Tony staggered away with a lot of good-natured good-byes to the other Alphas, letting Steve drag him up to the room, feeling dizzy and content.
"...what the hell are you doing here?  Steve?" asked Tony, looking to Steve. He had a moment of panic.  Had Steve
"But they're not dying quickly enough and they're leaving more men like them behind. He literally said I needed to be
"Yes, I know Tony, thank you," said Pepper distractedly.  Her heels clipped down the stairs and she punched in Tony's code: 1009.
to do something, and I did."
Also I want to reassure everyone that before we go back to our regularly scheduled drama and angst, the party is lots of happy fluff, which I suspect we'll all need post-Infinity War.
"Stark," repeated the soldier, brow furrowing.
And there, next to Steve, a clean-shaven man, no hat, with a sharp, intense, familiar look.  Bucky.  Undeniably Alpha and undeniably handsome.  Tony had debated showing Steve the picture at all, but it hadn't felt right to keep it from him.
Tony turned.  Vanko was lying, unmoving, on the ground.  The drones were standing there, silent, their arc reactors still shining, and Tony realized something suddenly.  Vanko had gone down too easily.  And the words he'd mouthed:
"We should get Tony and Steve upstairs. The sedatives will be wearing off soon," Gleason said, hands on his hips. "Do you think some of your boys could help Steve up?"
Tony looked over at Steve.  "...you don't have to coddle me," he said, suddenly serious.  "I don't want to think about what happened. It's fine, okay? I'm fine.  ...can you take my collar off, though? My hackles are, like, burning..." He reached past the squirrel hood and scratched violently at his neck.
Steve slowly moved to lie down with him, Tony's arm warm as it wrapped around his shoulders. Steve ended up curled on his side, hand on Tony's chest. He studied the curve of the arc reactor under his t-shirt intently. In the sunlight it was hard to make out its glow.
"Sir?" he asked, confused, glancing up from that first pleasant drag of the cigarette.
?"  Tony had never seen Pepper's residence.  It was a mystery to him.
"Yes."
"Ah-ah-ah-ah!" protested Tony, scruffing Steve's neck.  "No running... you gotta come downstairs. Remember? Interview?  Come on..." He was already hardening again. He hoped that the interviewers were betas, otherwise it was going to look like a fucking Renn faire, what with all the swords and tents.
"I'm doing this as much for him as for me.  Steve's a good omega. He's...
"Hold your horses!  I'm working on it," said Tony.  "...in about fifteen seconds, you're gonna hear a loud click and the doors are all going to come unlocked, okay?  You guys go on without us, we're about four or five minutes from the central stairwell."
...he really wasn't supposed to tell anyone the coordinates.
"How the hell can you tell if you're compatible--" began Tony, but stopped.  He hadn't known a goddamn thing about Steve when they bonded. They'd been scent-mates.  Independent of higher brain function, their body chemistries had been compatible and they'd bonded based purely on scent.
The door beeped and a third man walked in.
He walked home from his run, having sprinted out too far and actually gotten tired (his heat had drained him). Steve's phone started ringing in the back pocket of his shorts as he headed home. It was Phil. Steve thought about it before he finally answered with a sigh.
He only cracked an eye open when he smelled an omega passing by.  She was in post-heat and her scent was absolutely cloying. "Hey, can I get a drink?" asked Tony, snagging her.
Bucky stared curiously at the omega.  He felt like he might have spoken to this man before.  He seemed vaguely familiar.
He walked over, grabbing Steve's head playfully and kissing his hair.  "You look like you've seen a ghost. Come on, buddy, you're on leave. Try to relax, will you?  Don't look at those old papers, they'll depress the hell out of ya. A night of dancing will do you good."  He swept the newspapers off the table with one arm, the other thrown over Steve's shoulders. "You gonna get dressed, or should I just take you out like this?  Don't make me do it, Steve..." he warned teasingly. One of his hands slid teasingly over Steve's shoulder; Steve was in a thin undershirt and his boxers.
" he hissed.
Steve wasn't sure if he was capable of taking this kind of talk seriously.
Tony had to admit that the idea of Steve in collar and/or naked was, to him, extremely sexy.  He felt guilty because he knew that collars were demeaning and old-fashioned. But Tony had grown up in the seventies and eighties.  When arranged bonding had been outlawed, he'd already been thirteen. His family lived on Long Island (more specifically, in the Hamptons), in a posh, rich, conservative neighborhood, and collared omegas were common.  Even after arranged bonded had been legally forbidden, most kept their collars, as a matter of habit. Being a teenager on a cusp of puberty, a thirteen-year-old Tony had been fascinated with them.  In his neighborhood, collars were made of precious metals and often had gems; they sparkled in the sunlight. When Tony thought of omegas in collars, he didn't think of the locked chains of the twenties, but of pleasant, attractive pool boys bringing him lemonade.  He couldn't help but find them arousing. He'd occasionally beat off to the idea of Steve wearing one, maybe just in the bedroom, but never suggested it, because he was well-aware of how fucked up that would be.
"I...I don't know."
Steve crouched on the opposite side of the street.  There were a couple of cars parked outside... Mini-Coopers.  A bit stereotypical, in Tony's opinion, but whatever.
The lumpy package turned out to be a long piece of metal.
Sam frowned a little.
had been real. But that wasn't important right now.
He didn't bother saying any of the rest.  How everyone thought Steve was triple-bonded and how Tony felt like a loser who couldn't keep his omega in check or protect him, how he felt like Steve's side fuck, how much he resented Bucky, how hard monogamy was for him and how much he missed women, and how he hated how
?  People were fucking scared of him.  Everyone thought it was
Tony sighed with relief when Steve pressed a cold, wet cloth against it.  "I got it," he said, waving Steve away, taking the cloth from him. Tony didn't like people touching the back of his neck.  Not even Steve.
"No, not Sam...speaking of, how is he?" Steve asked. "I haven't seen him for over a month."
"Hey.  Cap.  It's okay," he said, putting on a brave face for the omega.
Tony limped up to him and sat beside him, pressing their shoulders together, shivering.  One of the nurses wrapped a blanket around him and began trying to clean the cut on his lip.  Tony didn't take his eyes off Steve; he groped for Steve's hand, found it, and clung to him.
Donner heaved a tiny little world-weary sigh, like the weight of the decision was crushing him.  Rhodey decided to let up for a while. He sat down into a chair, grabbing himself a bottle of tequila from the bar, knowing full well that Pepper was probably cursing him for spending more money.  (Tony had been the one to book the room, on "Richard Emmett's" behalf.)
He stroked Steve's hair.  "...but, if you really want to make me feel better..." he added, still joking, trying to recapture the mood.  He gave Steve's head another little push.  "My research tells me you probably have to be a little lower than that to do it right."  He put his hands behind his head, watching Steve, still smiling encouragingly.
"Mhm?"
"Go for it, Tones."
"Excited about the party, Phil?" asked Tony.
"...oh.  Right," said Tony, breaking away reluctantly.  He hesitated.  Logic was telling him that they were better safe than sorry, at least until he could get a legitimate vasectomy and stop relying on one that he'd gotten at a shady clinic for virtually nothing at all. But instinct was telling him to screw logic, screw his omega, fuck him bareback, take him and knock him up, give him twins or even triplets--
.  It came automatically, naturally.
"It's good that no one's gotta known about Barnes," he said, trying to stay positive for Steve.
"Donner! Donner, get back over here!"
"I'll them know," Happy said, pulling out his phone to quickly send off a text (to presumably Pepper). Steve imagined her and Aria would be catching the plane back with them. Steve couldn't
"Brooke, you are-- you're stunning, and if I wasn't-- I totally would. Don't get me wrong. But I can't-- I just can't stoop down to his level, just because he's being a dick--"
"My mommy and daddy said monsters hide under beds," she said and then pulled Tigger's ear from her mouth.
Before the serum Steve had been a runt. He was weak. No one thought he'd be wanted. Even after Bucky had bitten him it was like Alphas could smell how
"I wish I'd done a lot of things differently too," Steve whispered and sat up a little, but didn't pull away. Their faces were close. "It was hard waking up and having almost everyone I knew just not...being here anymore. But the hardest thing was realising that in the forties I wasn't really living at all. All the pain I went through to get here. It was worth it, just to experience this."
"Please. Just let me go, I didn't mean to cause any trouble. I swear.  Call my Alpha.  Call Bucky, he'll come pick me up and I'll never bother you aga--"
You know... Captain America." It looked like saying the words physically pained him.
"It was in the design all along."  Tony began laughing, giddily.  "I discovered-- no-- I
"It's okay, Steve, I got you," he said softly, grabbing a bottle of water from under the bench and thrusting it into Steve's hands.  "You're okay, I'm here, it's all over, mission's over... you're okay, baby..." He would have given anything to take the suit off, but it was an impossibility.  And besides, even if he could have, he didn't trust himself, not one bit. He knew he would have killed Natasha earlier if she hadn't had Steve's shield. He wouldn't have even thought twice about it.  His stomach twisted a little; he hoped that didn't end up on the mission report. He didn't want to look like some sort of crazy Alpha that lost his damn mind over an omega in heat. But this was different, this was his mate...
"Are you throwing one of your crazy birthdays, Tony?" asked Banksy.
Tony held up his, automatically, but then lowered them.  He wasn't going to shoot some defenseless girl; she was holding no weapon.
Tina was a middle aged woman dressed in a suit that probably fit her better a few years ago. Her features were soft but her eyes steely. "I think he has a platform to speak from that no other omega does. I think he proved the stereotype is wrong and that I think his disappointment in how far we've come in 70 years puts us to shame. I think that with Captain America now we finally have a real chance at equality."
Both of them looked up in alarm.
Steve tried to playfully nip at Tony's fingertips as they traced his lips.
Steve made it three minutes before it felt like his lungs were going to burst and he had to rise up. It was useful information and he logged it away just in case he ever find himself situation which meant he'd be stuck under water for so long. The water felt good and he didn't really want to leave it. He knew he'd pissed Tony off, he could feel it. But Steve wasn't going to regret being honest with him...he couldn't just pretend everything was okay when it wasn't. He wasn't going to enjoy watching Tony slow destroy his own liver.
Steve looked over at the roses. His chest felt strange. He moved to sit up with a grunt, his limbs stiff from being in a cage for four days.
Steve jumped out of his grasp once they got to the top, spotting the guards Sam and Tony had dealt with earlier a little way off. His eyes widened a little to see one of their heads completely caved in. Well,
"Alright, alright... that's swell.  Thanks, Aria."
Still, he would only have one chance to talk to the guy with the whips.
, read the text across his face.
"You're creeping me out, Tony."
"Mm'k," said Tony, arching up into Steve, feeling his slickness.  He pushed himself, pushing up, sighing with satisfaction. Steve sheathed him so nicely.  His knot was tight and bulging around and he was looking forward to plugging Steve up. He looked up to brush a hand over Steve's face.  "This is your heat, so anything you want special, you let me know, okay?" He leaned forward to kiss the corner of Steve's mouth. "I'm your Alpha.  I'm going to take care of you." He bit Steve's lower lip, jutting his hips upward, trying to get more of himself into the blond. Steve was in his lip, legs wrapped around him, and Tony could feel his knot at Steve's entrance, Steve's body stretching against him.  Steve's erection was touching his stomach, rubbing against his skin. "Good boy," he murmured into Steve's mouth, not wanting to break their kiss. His tongue licked around Steve's mouth. It was new all over again. They'd been having sex for seven months but this was far more intense than anything from before.  And the promise of more of it to come, harder, was thrilling. Tony had never had an omega in heat and he couldn't fucking wait.
"I mean, it kind of was my fault. Half the reason I'm here is to kind of piss him off," Steve admitted and Donner almost laughed. They shared a brief, awkward smile. Donner still looked terrified.  His laugh was more of a coughing "heh, heh."  Steve got the impression he didn't laugh much.
Tony squeezed Steve's hand comfortingly, knowing that Steve was obsessing over Donner's fate.  "Hey. It's only a couple more days until Rhodey'll bring him. He'll be okay, Steve. We already booked the meeting with Gene and a hotel room and everything.  Don't worry. ...you gonna draw this?" He touched the orchid's dark petals.
"About twenty every year," Lola shrugged, slurping down more pineapple juice. "I try to avoid it. I don't like watching. It can get pretty vicious."
"Oh my God," said Natasha, a hand coming up to her face.
"Tony!" snapped Maria warningly.  "Downstairs.
Tony was vaguely aware that there was nothing Steve could do about being accidentally double-bonded but he was too manic to stop.  He vaguely remembered Pepper telling him how Alphas got aggressive during their mate's heats... well, why not? After all, there was another threat, another Alpha,
"Yeah.  I'll play some loud music and work on one of the cars... I'll be fine.  Seriously, I just... I hate cigarettes, that's all. Really. I'm fine," insisted Tony.  He didn't add he was probably going to drink a lot. He assumed Steve knew that. "Go, Steve.  Stop being a stereotypical omega and trying to nurture me. I'm a big boy." He walked around the car and put an arm around Steve's waist.  "But don't ask me to come out with you on any more crazy trips. Until that WSC meeting, I'm officially on hiatus. I just wanna work in the shop."
Tony was immediately impressed.  "You made that?" Tony had a natural reverence toward anyone who worked with metal.
"Do you have any idea what you're doing?  Hm? You think these children
He gave Carter a sharp nod, then yanked open his door and rolled out.
"The hell is this?" he asked, turning it over.
Back in the observation room, Natasha waited to make sure Steve was really and truly gone, then tilted  her head to Fury.  She lowered her voice a fraction. "He really doesn't trust you. You should probably work on that."
He reached up to rub the back of his neck vigorously, but his hair refused to flatten.
another kind of question?  ...no, ha, it's probably insensitive but, I gotta know, I'm dying of curiosity--"
it didn't feel wrong. Should it have?
"Maybe you should just take him home," Aria said, watching Tony with a strange expression on her face.  "Don't get ketchup on your suit, Steve!"
Karpov opened the door to the garage.  It was chaos; there were people running all over the place, some in fatigues and others in lab coats, some carrying guns and others hauling notebooks and computers.
"Yes, sir."
"Not in person," said Tony.  "I think we've been at some of the same UN deals maybe, like, twice?  The king seems like a nice guy. I don't know a thing about the prince.  He's a younger guy, your age, I guess. I mean... not ninety, like, late twenties," sputtered Tony.  He began laughing. After a moment, he shook himself out. "So the deal is, supposedly, that the Wakandan bodyguard is all omegas because the king is supposed to choose a mate from them.  That way, his queen can protect him, get it? The queen died a few years ago, before you were unfrozen, and it was like Princess Di levels of mourning... oh. That was also before you were unfrozen.  Never mind."
"Steve.  Steve, focus.  You've got that interview--"  Tony was starting to think the interview was a crappy idea.  He was all for dispelling myths, but there was no myth to dispel here.  In pre-heat, omegas were bonkers. Maybe not as bonkers as they were in full heat, but still.  "--so go get dressed in something comfy and go downstairs and grab a glass of OJ, okay? You can run later."
"I knew that," said Tony quickly, feeling stupid.  He thought it had been a great theory.
She fixed him with her piercing, serious gaze.  "...you're not
It was all good news, but Steve couldn't appreciate it.  The conversation with DeSoto had left him feeling depressed.
"I'll get back to you before December," Gleason promised. He offered a small wave and then he was off, seeing himself out of the door.
"He's bad," added Vigor, who seemed more nervous than his sister.  "We can take care of you; you don't want Fletch. He's bad."
"I have n-nothing to do with Heirloom; he called me and I just t-told them where to find him."
"White Russian.  It's a breakfast drink.  You want one?"
He stared at himself in the mirror. The light in the room was ghoulish. It was around five in the morning. Steve didn't recognise himself.
Gleason held out a clipboard for Steve to sign a paper that would let him access the samples SHIELD had taken from him in the jet.
, you know?  I'm Tectonic but you can call me Trey, that's short for Tremell and only my real good friends call me that, but you and me, we're buddies, right?  We're omega
Impossible, though, right?  That man had fallen to his death, apparently, decades before Tony's birth.  Tony wracked his brain.  A photograph?  Book?  Magazine?  Newspaper article?
Steve tossed his shirt on the floor and then flopped down on the bed, spreading his legs wide and tugging Tony up between his thighs.
"They're gonna wanna take a statement before you go into full blown heat," Mac warned him gently. "They'll probably have Agent Hill waiting at your house. I'm guessing you don't wanna do it here."
to warn him; he
"My mom got it for me," began Tony, voice even, forcefully controlled.  "It was my favorite toy. I had it 'til I was five. Then, the day after my fifth birthday, Dad threw it in the trash.  Said I was too old for it." He paused again. "Aaliyah fished it out for me and gave it to me that night. She was one of my nannies.  She said to me-- well, it was a long time ago, but something like,
"Oh, it's fine, I've seen worse.  But thank you," said Gleason as he made toward the front door.
"I don't think they have Hertz here," said Tony.
"Goddamn.  I mean, the design's impractical, but I gotta hand it to them for flair."
"You're fine," Steve assured him softly.
"That didn't go so bad," said Tony loudly.
Steve shook his head. He never wanted Donner to hear the details of what went on in that room. He hated the thought of him feeling responsible. If anything, it was Steve's fault. He shouldn't have... he shouldn't...
Phil closed his door, walked around, and put an arm around him, leading him over.  Clint must have only arrived recently, because he was still in full SHIELD garb: black pants and shirt, a bulletproof vest, a hip and thigh holster, heavy combat boots.  The only thing missing was his archery glove.
"...where do the bad omegas go, though?" asked Tony suddenly.  "I don't think any of these guys are capable of murder, either.  They're a bunch of stiff, rich suits. If they wanted someone killed, they would hire someone else to do it, right?  ...but if they don't off them, what do you think happens to them? They can't just put 'em back into auction, not if they already have a mark on their neck and a history of being noncompliant."
Tony had guessed, correctly, that the news had leaked that they were buying a collar and social media was buzzing with rumors.  Plenty of people had outright dismissed the idea that Steve would ever do anything so degrading. Some were hopefully guessing that it was either a publicity stunt or that it was part of Steve's whole equality crusade and he was about to do some sort of dramatic gesture against collars and the companies that sold them.  And still others were saying it was about time that Tony finally got his omega under control, that he was finally taking charge and putting Steve in his place.
"Six.  Stand down.  Deactivate."
And Tony understood just how much courage it took to take that chance.  Especially when, like Donner, you didn't even have a suit of armor.
Steve swallowed down the lump in his throat and replied one-handed:
No. He wasn't dreaming.  He was definitely awake.  It was early, pre-dawn, but despite only having slept for a few hours, he felt wide awake.
here.  He's in cryo.  He went really peacefully.  ...thought you might want to know that.  But if anyone asks, you have no idea where he is, okay?"
"Yeah.  Figured it out a week or two ago.  I can take selfies and everything now," said Steve.
"Karpov's," he said.
"No, my dad sold me.  I had two older brothers who were Alphas.  Dad was an Alpha and Mom was a beta. Dad figured she'd cheated and they broke up and everything over that.  They
"Agent Carter, probably," Phil filled in helpfully.
"If this is a date, I'm getting a bottle of Malbec," he informed Steve.  He set the menu aside, paused, and then reached across the table to entwine their hands.  "...I've only been here once before," he said, looking up at the strings of lights over the courtyard.  "Years ago.  I was with a girl named Beth.  Didn't work out.  I always liked this place, but, ah... I'm... you know, the thing is, I'm not really known for being a charmer so much as a playboy, and this place sorta seemed... overly... you know.  Romantic.  And I haven't done romance in years.  I sorta thought about taking Pepper here, maybe, if she'd ever agree to a date.  We could be like, y'know... those guys."
"Take all the time you need," said Fury, a hint of maliciousness in his voice.  If Steve weren't his omega, Tony would have liked Fury's attitude.  The guy was a bad ass and Tony admired that.  But when directed at Steve, it was different.  Tony fought the urge to bare his teeth; he watched as Fury, Coulson, Natasha, and the others left, closing the door behind him.  They left behind the manila folder on the table in front of the sofa. Tony eyed it curiously.
The thought popped into Tony's head so suddenly that it took him a moment to realize it made absolutely no sense.  A headache flared up behind his eyes and he rubbed his head.
He couldn't stay focused long enough to come up with any alternative explanation because he got a strong whiff of Steve's musk and his mind was static again and he was grabbing Steve's hips and fucking him as hard as he could (wait, when had he gotten hard again?) and he could hear a phone beeping somewhere and his thrusts were in time to the alarm, it was wonderful, magical, and Steve was practically trying to swallow his hand, the two of them were covered in sweat and semen and Tony's knot was aching wonderfully with the tug of Steve's body and he wasn't even sure if he had any semen left to give him but he didn't care about that because he was coming undone all over again on top of his omega with breathy laughter and happy little growls and nips of pleasure.
"I don't know, Tony.  Just keep biting him there and you won't have to worry about it," said Clint, the faintest hint of amusement in his voice.
Tony grinned a little.  "This year, actually, no... Steve and I are going to England for our anniversary in June."
"Tony," he whined, throwing his head back. "
Jasper Sitwell sat in an interview room looking nervous. He was sweaty, his forehead shiny, and he kept tugging at the collar of his shirt. He shifted and squirmed a little in his seat, swallowing down the water from the plastic cup with a shaky hand. Sitwell didn't look good. He wasn't good at this. That's what HYDRA valued about him; he was expendable.
Steve had to reach up and grip the arm to stop Tony from pushing him off entirely. He was so focused on his task. "Tony." His voice was strained and shaky. "Tony, my-" Steve let out breathy noise of pleasure and threw his head back as his Alpha fucked into him. His neck was exposed just perfectly for Tony to lean down and mark him as his hips drove in and out at a pace Steve honestly hadn't known he was capable of.
Tony had been pretty serious about Steve taking his shield everywhere with him from now on.  Tony carried his suit around and look at how that had worked out for him in Monaco.
Pepper frowned.  "Well, no, but that's not what I'm asking.  Aria needs to know where you want to--"
Pepper's ears turned red.  "No!"
"Please," Steve nodded. He handed it to Kate. She jabbed the needle into his leg and squeezed down. "-dinner with the president."
"You're too young to understand this right now, but someday you'll be old enough... so I thought I would put it on film for you. I built this for you."
"Plus one of the guys on the board was sent to a conversion camp as a kid that messed him up real bad.  I think they're got every right to be a bit more militant," said Phil petulantly. "Anyways, the Horseshoe Society is pretty much run by just the one councilman, Jeffrey Walker, and he hasn't been very active lately."
He couldn't say he had too many regrets.  He wished he could tell Pepper he loved her.  Wished he could hold Steve, just hold him, cuddle him.  But other than that, he was satisfied with his life.  The big stuff, like the company and the suit, he'd passed on.  It would be okay.
"I'm already bonded!" he called across the expanse, sensing Tony's aggression.
Pepper shoved a can of coffee grounds at him.  "Breathe."
. He winced as his jaw smacked into the floor.
Steve was missing.
"War fatigue.  We called it war fatigue," said Steve, crossing his arms.  "But I don't have it."
he thought as he tore open a foil packet and rolled a condom down over his erection.
The screen showed the cover of a magazine. The photograph on the front was oddly touching, yet harrowing. It was Tony in his armor standing in the ER, with Steve cradled in his arms, Steve's head tucked against his chest. They both looked bloody and battered, not the look they'd exactly been going for. Tony's faceplate was off and he was looking down at Steve in the picture, his eyes full of concern. Like he was looking at his world. One of the news crews must have taken it. It was touched up a little, the blurriness hidden with Photoshop and the bright fluorescent lighting of the lobby dulled down a fraction. But the feeling in it was still raw.
"No, Steve.  I'm fine. Thanks for walking me up," said Tony, who had let Steve literally tuck him in.  Steve was still fussing around with the pillows. "Go for your run. Just wake me up an hour before it's time to leave, so I can grab a shower and clean up my face, okay?"
He sighed a little.  "C'mon.  Let's get up," he said.  He was pretty sure there was a box of old Chinese food in the mini-fridge down there.  Granted, it was a few weeks old.  But it was in a fridge.  Tony wanted to wolf it down and get back to work.
Tony looked down and drew a heart in the fog on his arc reactor, then looked up at Steve with a grin, watching him peel off his workout clothes.
He didn't know what bond the omega was talking about or who Tony was or why he was acting like they knew each other.  Perhaps he had mistaken the soldier for someone else.
There was something about the way that Tony called him ‘baby’ that made Steve's heart skip a beat. He realised they'd suddenly pressed closed together, or rather he'd hidden his face in Tony's chest. The awkwardness from before had seemingly dissipated. Steve swallowed.
Beth, who was hovering nearby, gave a loud scoff of disapproval.  Pepper's phone chimed; she looked down at him and groaned. "Arcadia just tweeted about you, Tony.  It's not flattering.
But the prospect of seeing Steve sad was so much worse.
Obadiah had been unbonded and resolutely believed that bonding made Alphas into fools; he discouraged Tony from getting "chummy" with any omegas and Tony had spent his life seeking out the company of beta women without question.  But if Howard had lived, he might very well have been introduced to some poor, unwilling, brainwashed omega, someone like DeSoto.
, he copied down.  ...
He tore his attention away from Steve to put in his contacts and give his beard a brief trim.  Tony's vision was good, good enough that he didn't necessarily
"How am I supposed to do anything with you and your company constantly blowing up in my face?  I mean,
"If we did, we'd both go insane," said Tony.  "I'm here to pick up Malick's dry-cleaning. Any idea if there's an in-house service?"
Damn it, omegas could be so fucking manipulative.
.  He was... you know... respectable.  Steve was

Steve wanted to be childish and tell Sam he didn't understand. He was into alphas exclusively and he'd only lost Riley, his partner, less than a year ago. Sam still had his bite mark on his neck, and he wasn’t ashamed of it, even though Acers were rare, and rarer still in the armed forces. He wore it with pride and ignored any of the jeers he got from fellow SHIELD agents. Sam didn't care what they thought of it; it was the only piece of Riley he had left. The proximity mine had done away with the rest of him.
"Did Tony buy you?" One asked.
"Tony. Tony I'm gonna- I'm gonna..." Steve clenched around, his insides squeezing at Tony's cock, trying to milk it. And then he came, crying out Tony's name as he came over his hand and the sofa beneath them. He shuddered in pleasure, lips parting and hips rolling back as he rode out his orgasm just right.
amazing."
omega."  He got a bit of a glassy look.  "Although I do think Stephanie would be a nice name, if it were a girl.  Gideon Jr. if it's a boy."
"Why could you feel his arm?" Sam frowned.
"Okay... okay, no, I feel better... oh, my God, I don't think I ever drank that much... I threw up way more than went in... okay... I'm good now... I'll read the report, Steve, okay, but... but if you can hurry up and text it to me... email it, I mean... just send it... I... I have a big night planned, I'm gonna donate it.  My badassium.  I wanna donate it to--"
This interview was different than anything Steve had done before; it was a nearly hour-long interview about some very personal topics, airing live, and Steve could honestly say he was a little nervous.  He was grateful to be holding Tony's hand.  There was no real tenderness in the gesture; it was for show.  But when Tony and Steve strolled on stage together, Tony was smiling and nodding.  Since the expo he'd been a recluse, barely showing his face in public. Aside from going out with Steve, Tony had holed himself in his shop and been keeping himself out of the public eye.  Maybe because Steve had only ever seen Tony in his own territory, or from across a private, romantic dinner, he'd never appreciated just what an incredible actor Tony was. Tony and Steve dropped into a leather loveseat.  Boswell was behind his desk, but Banksy was sitting cross-legged in an armchair near them. Tony was still holding Steve's hand, and he placed their hands on his thigh, where they would be most visible for the cameras.
Fury heard him.  "I need someone I can trust.  We both know SHIELD is at least partially compromised, that there are spies within it.  And I don't know a damn thing about MI-13... I trust Wisdom but I don't want this mission on either of our records.  It involves exposing some HYDRA agents, which means if HYDRA has infiltrated MI-13 as well, then they're damn sure going to corrupt or alter the files.  They'll protect their most important moles. I need to ensure that that drive gets to me without anyone interfering with or copying it, and if you're the one who holds onto it, I'll know it doesn't get messed with.  Oh, and happy anniversary."
Jorge laughed appreciatively, even though it wasn't clear how much he understood.
"Who turned off the lights?!" Steve demanded, voice louder now. No one knew what to say.
"...oh, boy, well... we're all on probation and under house arrest.  Clint and Natasha disappeared together to some safe house, I don't know the details.  Me and Phil, we're confined to the base. They're, uh, they're bringing us up on some pretty... some pretty rough charges.  But I think they'll be dropped. Fury is spitting mad but he's fighting for us. You know how he is. ...I think everyone's just... glad you're back."
"Of course, SHIELD wants you under observation for your future heats, until we can confirm your safety.  Sorry, Agent Rogers. I've requested to be assigned to that detail. Thought it might be a little less embarrassing for you if it were me."
He wondered if there were other parts on the two of them they didn't know about.  Both of them were woefully undereducated.
He beamed at her, then added, "I don't got candles."
"Eve's been partially successful, though, hasn't it?  There are a few who are semi-functional?"
"Captain Rogers," repeated JARVIS.
There were three of them outside the door.  The girl, the one they called the witch.  A man with a gun, and in front of him, Bucky.  No. The
"I'll... put it off.  For now," mumbled Tony unhappily.  He looked over at Steve, who glanced up at the same time, and their eyes met.  "...maybe you could... talk to Gleason about one of those implant things?" he suggested awkwardly.
The line went dead.
"Congrats on the show, by the way. The third omega hosted show though? That surprises me. I heard about Ellen. I thought there would be more..."
missile, I ought to be able to go--"
"...forty years, wow... how time flies when you're having fun, am I right?  ...let's hear it for DJ AM... thanks, Goldstein, you're a doll... I just want to tell all of you that I love you, you're all amazing, look at you... I look out and I see a crowd of beautiful people... and also Rhodey... ha, ha, no, I'm kidding, he's gorgeous too... isn't he gorgeous, everyone?  ...you know, I like to think that this is exactly what my dad would have wanted, right here... men, women, whites, blacks, Alphas, omegas, all mingling together, all enjoying themselves... are we enjoying ourselves? Are we having fun, guys?"  Everyone cheered affirmatively.  Someone handed Tony a drink; he took it with surprising delicacy in his metal gauntlet and sipped it, the mic still in his other hand.
Tony pushed away the blankets-- he was sweating-- and sat up dizzily.  "Look, Steve, I need a drink.  I'm just gonna run down to the liquor store real quick and grab something, okay?"  He leaned forward and kissed Steve's temple.  "I'll miss you," he added.  The words sounded gooey to him but he couldn't help but utter them; they were true.
must be your mate.  He's an unruly one, isn't he?  Very handsome, though. ...take off that collar, Stark, I'm not going to have Alphas making asses of themselves in my class.  Oh, Eric! Hi there! Good to see you again!"
Tony grinned.  "It
"Tomorrow we're meeting with some jewelers," said Tony.  "Bulgari, Harry Winston, and Cartier are the three we have to choose from.  I'm guessing none of that means anything to you, does it? They're all very posh.  Hermès, Piaget, and David Yurman have put in bids, too. Basically everyone wants Captain America wearing their collars.  And FYI, now that the jewelry industry knows, the story that we're buying is going to break probably in the next forty-eight hours."  A pause. "Personally I am a very big fan of Bulgari. Although David Yurman has some charity foundation he's always on about so maybe you'll wanna look into that.  I don't really care. Did you know both Cartier and Harry Winston owned the Hope Diamond at one point? But I think diamonds on collars are tacky. I think we should go for something more... y'know... masculine, I guess.  Like maybe enameled gold or something."
A woman who was passing by looked scandalized at Steve's words.
had been done to him sunk deep into Steve's bones, down into his very core.
"It would be tricky, legally.  The camps are all for underage kids.  I feel like offering a safe haven for underage omegas is setting ourselves up for a lot of lawsuits saying we're kidnapping them or something," said Tiberius thoughtfully.
It was weird, for Steve, to be going back into Tony's workshop after everything. Steve had only been down here a few times before to a deliver a message or hand over a smoothie. Pepper went down far more frequently than he had. Maybe Steve had been a little jealous at times, she got to 'see the magic' as it was. The first time Steve had properly seen the suit in action was actually on the track in Monaco.
Tony turned to Steve.  "Listen, Steve... I don't know if... if this is a bad idea, but what if
Tony pulled away the slightest bit.  "Is that good?" he asked quietly, breath ghostly over Steve's erection, fondling Steve's balls with one hand through his slacks.
Steve nodded numbly. "Sure. Lead the way."
He placed a call to Dr. Ludheim.  "Do we know the soldier's activation words? ...what do you mean, they're in a
"...Steve's your family now."
Phil leaned in to Steve softly.  "We'll speak later, Captain. I'm going to take the Bartons.  ...thank you." He gave Steve a small nod.
" asked Steve indignantly.
"What about in the future? What about after you retire?  You don't plan on being a soldier forever?" Banksy asked, looking at them all doe-eyed with his head resting on his hands.
Pepper scoffed a little.  "Well, that's a bit of an exaggeration.  ...he drinks, too," she added.
The soldier wasn't sure who was escorting who.  He was walking in front of Karpov, but Karpov's hand was touching the small of his back lightly, guiding him.
"Let me guess.  They told you that the reason you didn't have a knot was because of the hernia."
"Your father said you could do it," said Fury.
He had a very vague idea that they had been bonded and then gone to war and the bond had gone away and Steve had been absolutely furious with him, but...
"Steve! Or should I say Captain? Pepper told me about- well, should I say? I think a congratulations are in order!"
The mark on Steve's neck had healed over into two distinctive, shiny pink scars that looked, to Tony's untrained eye, quite healthy.  One of the ovals was familiar, his own bonding mark, the grooves inviting him to sink his teeth in. The other slightly overlapping mark was Bucky's.  Yet... his was there. Unmistakably, it was there again, like it had never been screwed up.
"Oh, for
"Ew.  Continue."
Tony stared at Happy.  His mind was moving sluggishly.  He processed what Pepper was saying.
Across the room, Tony had gotten up, dizzily, and Steve felt a heavy pang of relief that he was okay, mixed with desire to go to him.
? What the actual fuck?
Karpov appeared.  "Breakfast?" he offered, ignoring the soldier.
"Well we don't really have the--" began one of the scientists.
"Just a 'mega going into heat.  He might be sick, I dunno, he's pretty disoriented.  It happens."
Rhodey walked over to the door and opened it.  "Come on," he said. "Just trust me, man." He held out a hand.
"You can come with me, but I'm still going Tony," Steve breathed. "They're sending me because I'm the best person to go. Dissecting a base isn't just about strength, it's about tactics and I'm
hurt- they said it wasn't broken. I bend stuff the wrong way all the time in the suit and I'm always fine.  Y'know they call me the
Tony contemplated this.  Classified?  His mind wandered to Project PEGASUS.  "...any weird stories out of New Mexico?"
The headline jumped out at him: WORC AND HORSESHOE SOCIETY LOBBY FOR CAPTAIN AMERICA'S RELEASE.  Below that, the article continued:
"I'm..."  Fuck.  Creativity wasn't his strong suit.  Not unless it involved soldering together metal, anyway.  "I'm... Steve," he said after a moment.  It was the first name he could think of, aside from "Virginia," but he didn't think Death would be fooled if he lied and said his name was Virginia.  "Steve... Buchanan... Stark," he said slowly.  "From Sycamore, New Hampshire."  He had no idea if there was a town called Sycamore in New Hampshire but he felt like lying was definitely the best option here.  He stuck out the hand that wasn't pulling down his shirt.  "Nice to meet you," he said, a bit more confidently.  As Obadiah always said, 90% of presentation was confidence and bullshit.  He wasn't going to let Death intimate him.  He had his pride.  After all, he was a Stark, and not only that, but a Stark of Sycamore, New Hampshire, home of the Fightin' Rams.  (The more details he invented, the more credible his story seemed.  He was trusting that Death couldn't tell he was lying but it was possible Death might call him out.  It was a chance he was willing to take.  After all.  He was a Stark.  Of Sycamore, New Hampshire.)
Tony waited until he'd left the room and closed the door behind him to crawl on top of Steve, pressing him into the bed.  "Oh, fuck.  We're so screwed.  We're so screwed.  ...should we just stay apart when your heat comes?  Do we even know when that is?  Can we call Coulson and find out?  You cycle with him, right?  Oh, fuck.  I don't want kids.  Oh, fuck me.  ...we don't want kids, right?  Oh, fuck."
pop-up books for kids like that."
"Yes, yes, lots of Alphas and omegas want to know about the knotting process.  The knot acts as a sort of... think of it as a cork in a wine bottle. That's your body trying to keep in the semen you've released.  Can you take it out? Yes. It can be painful, but it's certainly possible. The best method is to get some lube or oil, whatever you have on hand, and massage around the base, gently working it out.  You don't want to tug it straight out; that can cause tearing to the omega. You want to do a sort of hip shimmy--" Richard gave a demonstrative wiggle. "--and use your hands to ease it out."
Bucky beamed.  "You're welcome," he said.
"I can walk... it feels okay right now," said Donner, climbing painfully out of the car.  He offered a hand to Steve.
Steve had thought he'd be able to keep Tony from running off, but he was sorely mistaken.  Shit.  He'd made his way toward the stairs and before Steve could stop him, he'd already announced himself to the crowd, who had roared in approval, and then been sucked into it and disappeared.

He felt confused.  "...Karpov."

"A pleasure," said Tony, nodding to him in lieu of a handshake.  He moved to sit, automatically pulling out a chair for Steve. He could feel the eyes of the Dora Milaje boring into him; they seemed hyper-aware, like at any moment someone might go crazy and just start to stab the king over and over.  Tony found their attentiveness unsettling but both of the Wakandans seemed not to mind. Tony couldn't help but notice every one of the Dora Milaje were unbonded omegas, and happened to be rather desirable ones.
"Come on," Howard's fingers curled over his elbow. Steve looked up into the man's dark eyes. They were so familiar. "We're going to be late."
"...okay.  Thanks. I mean-- seriously, thanks," said Doug, voice cracking.
"These waffles are dry," Steve said, staring down at the plate with what seemed to be genuine concern.
"Because Bernard's the one that attacks cars and keeps almost getting run over," said Tony.  "Now turn up the radio, shaddup, listen."
"Oh." Steve blinked. No one had actually directly asked him about it before. "Tony's mark is there now, like
"Surely it will increase the rate of success?"
"Hello?" she said into the phone.
Suddenly, his vision started to go. He walked into a pile of boxes, knocking a few over, and realized he was screwed. He fumbled for his phone, but couldn't see the screen.  StarkTech phones had no buttons and required one to be able to see the "keypad."
"I don't think they had much of a choice.  Scent-mates," said Pepper.
Tony had let Natasha lead him to the cafeteria even though the smell of food turned his stomach.  "Steve really likes the muffins here," Natasha informed him..  There were only two occupied tables; one with a large group of men, presumably new recruits, who were behaving because of the other table, where several officers were having an intense discussion over their dinner.  "Carbs are supposed to settle the stomach, you know.  Go ahead and pick one."
"Assholes," proclaimed Tony as he leafed through a tabloid, days later.  Happy, Rhodey, and Agent Mackenzie were reading over the same one.
"Your sister isn't a dog, Cooper," said Natasha.
Tony strode down the hall, wanting to put some distance between himself and the bodies of the guards, distance between him and the room with the chair... Steve was hurrying after him.  He could feel Steve's hurt and anxiety and regret, and knew Steve wanted to fix this, but Tony just wasn't in the mood. He was still trying to quell his panic from that fucking room.
"If I grabbed Pepper, you could grab Happy," he said with a forced, wry smile.  He maneuvered them around so he wouldn't have to watch her dancing. The last time they had danced was after he came back from Afghanistan.  His shoulder had still been stiff, and he'd been weak. She had been nervous, wearing a backless blue dress, and they had gotten so, so close to kissing... and then the moment had passed and they'd gone back to drinking.  Tony would probably regret that for the rest of his life.
"Coulson.  Go with him," commanded Natasha.
Tony shuddered on top of Steve; Steve caught his lips and nudged at his tongue, almost tentatively.  Tony pushed back, dominating Steve's mouth, satisfied and secure in his authority.
"Quick, Steve.  It's too late for me.  Save yourself," advised Clint.
"Yes," said Donner.
"Technically," Steve said. He wasn't even sweating, not a hair out of place. He was perhaps a little breathless (which was abnormal for the super soldier) but that was all.
A woman in cat's-eye glasses and springy hair suddenly shoved between them.  "Hi, Mr. Stark, my name's Annette with Vanity Fair. Can I borrow you for just a sec?"
Shimmer's smile wavered a little.  "...Charlotte," she said softly. Neither Tony nor Dan heard.
He strode across the store, ignoring all the glittering jewelry around them; they were about two-thirds of the way across the room when a woman approached them.
Steve helped Tony undress them both, humming contently when they were pressed together. Steve curled his arms around Tony's shoulders and pulled him closer, dragging his teeth lightly along Tony's jawline as the other's fingers grazed along his side and then back up to his throat. Steve shivered when Tony's fingers lingered there  and he remembered when Clint told him that some people like to be strangled. That there was always someone who was into 'anything and everything' nowadays.
"Ah, well, we can't all meet Steves and Pipers now, can we?" said Gene with a winning smile.
"...I love
"Well, this is our first heat together, this might be the yooj.  I don't know yet. I'm hoping it's not, though. Anyway, he punched a hole in the wall, I smashed an orchid over his head, he grabbed my throat, said some more Russian garbage, then just sorta passed out.  Right now I've got the Mark 6 holding him down. It would actually be pretty delightfully kinky if I weren't scared for my life."
"He made me have a miscarriage," blurted Steve.
"Mhm. I just want the ice. Mph. Please," Steve murmured and squirmed on the sofa. He was still in his jeans and shirt, his waistcoat open. The tie had been taken off at some point downstairs; Steve himself didn't remember doing it.
Natasha watched the whole ordeal with a smirk on her face and stepped between them, 'accidentally' spilling her drink on one of the Morgans. "Oh my God, I'm so sorry," she said. "I didn't see you there."
Danielle leaned her hip against the countertop that was littered with Banksy's things, most of which consisted of hair products. "That's not what he asked you," she pointed out, voice deceptively soft.
A shadow passed over Kerry's face, a brief look of disapproval.  "He's on the phone," she said, pointing toward one of the cubicles in the back.  "...with Luke," she added, a note of disgust in her voice.
Steve recognised the main doctor (Richards was his name?) as they stepped into the room. There were only two other doctors; they almost looked nervous. But there was no Fury in sight- not yet, anyway.
The three SA leaders looked peeved by this knowledge.
thought Tony.  It was easier to fret about barium and badassium then think about SHIELD's lousy test; he'd seen what they'd put Steve through and he was admittedly worried.  He thought using Schmidt was a low blow.
She giggled again.  "I
Tony could understand why his father would have been eager to put Steve on the Avengers team.  Yes, Steve was noble and stubborn and strong and well-trained... but also, Tony was certain that Steve was right, that Howard had done it to make others uncomfortable.  As a sort of prank, just to be difficult and subversive.  Worse, back then, no one had known how to suppress heats chemically; it was only halfway through World War 2 that that particular technology had become available.  Before that, an omega who went into heat was pretty much forced to suffer through it, and was a target for Alphas to prey on.
"...he can't just take a bunch of personal days," added Tony, trying to cover up his worry with annoyance.  "My birthday's in a week and in the meantime we have, you know, a lot of statements to give, and also, you heard JARVIS, I'm drinking eighty-six ounces of chlorophyll a day.  I'm sure as hell not blending that much kale myself."
Tony's morning wood was making a small tent in the sheets. Steve had had this thing inside of him; it really shouldn't have intimidated him. But he still found himself blushing a little, his cheeks turning pink. He looked up at Tony. His Alpha definitely wanted him to do this. Right. Okay...
mate.  ...who seems like a little bit of an asshole, to be honest."
"Mine was similar," offered Natasha quietly behind Fury.
His heart leaped.  Karpov!  "что мне делать?" he asked.
"Warm water's never bothered me," Steve murmured. Cold water did though. But being cold in itself bothered Steve (no prizes for guessing why).
"No.  You're not a freak.  You're amazing," murmured Tony, reaching up to touch Steve's cheek.  "...thanks," he added, grudgingly.  "...I didn't mean to fight him, I just... when he said that... I snapped.  Steve, you're perfect.  You're better than perfect.  And we both know, even without the serum, the real you... you're a fighter.  You're a leader.  They chose you because of your spirit.  You're the most badass omega ever.  That doesn't make you a freak.  It makes you a fucking
"I told you to stop about three martinis ago," said an Alpha next to his disapprovingly.
The journey wasn't long. Charlie landed them comfortably. And then they were back in the car with Happy driving them. Charlie gave Steve a small smile as he stepped off the plane. "Good to have you home, Cap," she smiled. Steve offered her a small nod in return.
let some other Alpha take him, and he was reassuring Tony that he had nothing to worry about?
"Sure," agreed Tony, scratching his neck.
"Hey, Jarv," said Tony.  "Call Rhodes on behalf of Steve, please."  He loosened his tie and began unbuttoning his shirt.  Inside the house, Tony tended to shed off his formal attire like a lizard shedding its skin, dropping the clothing everywhere, something that was clearly a source of annoyance toward Pepper.  "Also, our anniversary plans will need rescheduled. We're not allowed anywhere except Canada and England, apparently."
Tony's voice got soft.  "I don't talk about what he did to me.  But it..." He gestured vaguely to his neck, then reached between the seats to find Steve's hand.
"Glad to hear it," he said.  "...and how are you, Mr. Stark?  I should have known Steve would bring one of his Alphas along."  He smiled again.
"Since bonding?" finished Eric.
The magic of the super serum.
"I can have clothes fetched for you, Captain."
. She's not available now but what if she--"
Tony's goatee twitched a little with a hint of what might have been a smile.
DeSoto shrugged. "And? You're with Mr. Stark, and he's a lot older than you."
Pepper had been pretty strict with them about leaving before 8:30 am and getting to the studio no later than 10.  As usual, Tony had opted to ignore that. He'd also opted to ignore the folder Pepper had dropped off in the shop about the show.  He didn't need to know anything about the show. He'd grown up with it. The show that came before it had first aired in the 70's as
He crouched behind the overturned vehicle, head throbbing.  The world was so loud it was quiet.  Tony could hear nothing but his own blood rushing through his veins.  And suddenly, there he was, up close and personal.
Tony shrugged expansively.  "Dunno. Give him to 84, or Status Alliance, or something.  They can probably help him out. Maybe he can get a job as an actor who plays Steve in movies... I mean, the guy's a dead ringer for him."
"Heard you went into business with a Jew.  Is that true?"
"What! Nooo! Cap can't leave!" Cooper protested and then promptly grabbed Steve's leg, supposedly holding him in place. He gave Steve a determined look, one that could make men talk in interviews. "You're not going
Steve was in a trance. He'd even whimpered slightly when Tony sucked a mark into his skin, leaving his trace there. Claiming what was his. Steve felt himself shiver. He felt hot and cold all over all at once. He felt
Tony groaned, meeting Steve's eyes; they locked on his, bright and eager, then flicked down briefly in submission.  Tony's cock throbbed in response. The jewels on Steve's collar sparkled, matching his eyes perfectly, and Tony reached up with one hand to hook a couple of fingers into the collar, to tug Steve down for a brief, sloppy kiss before letting him continue.  Leading Steve Rogers around by a collar on his neck... Tony was willing to bet a hell of a lot of Alphas, both in Steve's time and his, had dreamt of this, and Tony felt smugly superior in getting to be the only one who was allowed to.
"Who was that guy?  He had my design..." moaned Tony, leaning back.  His body had started shaking.  Shock was setting in.  Tony's body wanted a million things at once.  He wanted to scream and run and fight and also to sleep and also to fuck something and also to eat something and also to throw up.  In the end, he didn't do anything; he let Pepper drag him up to the hotel room, where the police were already waiting, along with the Minister of Defence, the head of RAID, the head of GIGN, and a guy Tony vaguely recognized from two years ago.
He looked up; he was turned on again, wanted to fuck Steve again, but also liked Steve like this, filled up, stretched out impossibly with the--
"I told you, Stark, I'm a pilot."
The possibility that they were scent-mates lingered and it bothered Tony.  It seemed like a crack in his intellectualism.  A primal marring on his otherwise flawlessly evolved brain.
Karpov slammed a fist on the table.  "
"I-- I mean-- what?"
"What will it take for you to leave him alone?" he hissed.
Karpov was fine with that plan, since it was a win-win for him.  If he succeeded then that was good for HYDRA; if he failed, he could blame the witch.  He was sick of babysitting Strucker's brats.
Tony sputtered into his coffee and blinked.  "I think I'm probably fine. The suit absorbs most of the impact."  He hesitated, then added, almost defensively, "I'm not an omega."
He almost shuddered at the memory. It was a different time now, Steve reminded himself. He didn't need protection. Not now he could protect himself.
Steve whimpered through gritted teeth; it fucking
work, Tony."
Tony smirked a little as stagehands began shooing the WSC people offstage.
Tony had  commandeered some tools and gone to work on the generators.  Whoever had set them up had not done a fantastic job. In fact, they might have been Amish or something.  Tony may not have been the star of the show (every time he looked around, Steve had a small fan club trailing him) but he sure as hell wasn't going to let himself be useless or idle.  Also he refused to work in a place that lacked both plumbing and tunes. He wanted music, at least.
"Maybe there's like a home...for the omegas whose rich Alphas reject them, or something like that. Somewhere where they're cared for but hidden away," Steve suggested. Before this he would have thought such a thing was ridiculous but now he wouldn't put it past any of them.
He ignored her.
The crowded parted like the Red Sea for Moses as Steve moved through it, Arcadia, Taylor, and Trey floating after him.  He caught a glimpse of Tony in the crowd, holding a martini, his arm around the waist of a young Asian woman wearing an eye-popping pink dress that matched her fingernails.  Tony, like Trey, was wearing sunglasses indoors; he was having an animated conversation with a man who was possibly some sort of actor and who Steve probably should have known, but didn't.  Even though everyone at the party was part of the Hollywood elite, Steve had heard of only a few of them. Most, like Trey, seemed to find this incredibly refreshing.
"I'm sorry, Alpha.  ...may I-- may I get you coffee?"
, anyway.
"Hey, Rex, whatcha reading?" called Lola, clearly not trying to be unfriendly.
"It's not marriage, Tony.  You can't call instincts old-fashioned.  Pair-bonding just... happens."
Rumlow put a hand on Steve's arm, perhaps trying to be comforting, then repeated, "Give me your phone, I'll try again."
"Right," Steve deadpanned. "Thanks." Just because they were agreeing to do this didn't mean they had to be enthusiastic about it.
Steve tried to follow Tony out but Natasha pushed him back into the room, saying things like "he needs time" and "he needs to process." But all Steve knew was that Tony was hurting. He could feel it- like a knife in his gut. It was a piercing kind of agony; Steve was trembling and he couldn't breathe.  Even now, flung sixty-five years into the future, Bucky had followed him and was
, looming over them at all times, even when they were alone... until he fought Bucky to the death and established his rightful ownership of Steve, he was always going to feel this way, paranoid and betrayed and overly defensive.
"As sure as hell hope not," Steve breathed. "Has anyone seen Tony?"
When Tony heard Steve ask if they were expected to kill people, he panicked slightly.
No. He wasn't.
Steve's body was heavy on top of Tony, but Tony loved it, craved more; he wrapped his arms around Steve's waist, dragging him closer; Steve was grabbing the edge of the bath, anchoring himself to it, his entire body focused on the act of pushing himself down into Tony, burying Tony's length into himself.
Steve swallowed and stared down at the black carpet that lined the gym floor. "I think that whoever did... wants me to know they're coming. Not necessarily HYDRA. I don't know. I don't think I'm safe, though. Or Tony is. This isn't
"Oh, sweet, simple Barton.  MD5 hashes are easy to crack open.  Don't worry, I'll redo your security system once I'm officially on board.  So I wanted to ask you some quick questions.  Is now a good time?"
Fury gave Steve a look.  "Not 'til next year.  We're still analyzing the data we recovered from the Cuban base.  Why don't you focus on tango lessons with your mate or something?"
Tony decided to just shut up for once and focus on washing his omega.
"You may," Steve smiled subtly and took the offered hand. They didn't really bother with leading; they just kind of swayed together, Tony's arms around his waist and Steve's arms around his shoulders. The music was a little slower now so they could dance slow enough for it to be sweet, their noses almost brushing.
Steve smiled weakly. "Yeah. Actually."
"We have the function. I think it's at...Bublé's house? Someone with a voice like his, anyway," Aria said and patted his arm. "It's a shame you can't get drunk Steve. After all that, you really deserve to."
He picked up another letter with his free hand and tore it open with his teeth.  "
Tony's mania was increasing; he was the same jittery, overly-excitable creature he'd been in Monaco just before the race, and he didn't wait for anyone to agree to anything; he tossed Natasha the cables, shoved a sledge hammer into Steve's hands, and then spent the next twenty minutes on the floor of the shop bending pieces of metal yanked off one of his cars into a series of small clips and rings, murmuring excited notes to JARVIS, who was keeping a projected lab notebook up in the shop that was utterly incomprehensible to anyone but Tony.
"Then why's Fury being such a dick to us?" demanded Tony.
now, huh?"
Steve was already hard; Tony kissed his shaft, running over it with his tongue, tracing the vein on the underside up to the head, where he flicked the edge of Steve's foreskin before running over his head.  Steve's cock was wonderfully familiar to him even though it was so completely different him his. Uncut and without a knot, Tony had come to appreciate Steve's anatomy in a way he never expected to. With his hands, anyway.  This was only the second time he'd ever gone down on Steve but from the sounds coming from above, he was doing a good job.
, he wrote, then paused, thinking, trying to flush out the idea that was just on the tip of his brain.
They spent the rest of the day screwing in the kitchen and it worked well, really. Food and water were always at hand and so were copious amounts of pills. Steve even delivered food outside of Phil's tent along with more ice when him and Tony managed to separate for brief moments. They broke off a few more pieces of marble and the surface of the counter actually cracked when Steve rode Tony on top of it, but aside from that the damage was minimal. As the end of the day finally came crawling around Steve felt far less needy and desperate than he had before.
. His throat fluttered around Tony's cock but he didn't budge.
Steve went to get changed himself. Steve wanted to look a little smarter, ideally. He swapped out the t-shirt for a button-up, and then grabbed his phone, firing off a text as Tony stepped out of there bathroom. He smiled at the sight of dark hair plastered over Tony's forehead. "Much better."
. He had to get out. Steve couldn't breathe. He couldn't think. He just got on his bike, foregoing the helmet, and
"Fletch is in room four.  He was Trickshot before he came here," said Vim.
Donner whimpered.
Pepper sighed and rolled her eyes, but turned her seat around, her back to them.  Tony knelt and began unlacing Steve's boots for him, a look of concentration etched on to his face.  Dr. Gleason caught Steve's eye and, with his gaze, looked down at Tony, and back up at Steve, smiling.
my mate. Nothing will change that. Okay? He already took so many years of my life; they were wasted on him. I'm not letting him take you away too," Steve murmured. Maybe he believed Bucky had actually loved him he would have felt differently, but right now all Steve could remember was pity.  "And I'm also not going to let HYDRA use him to hurt us."
"...I feel old, though," he said after a moment.  "I can't believe I'm in my forties. I don't
Unsurprisingly, Boswell's passing left a splash on the headlines, but so did Banksy's speech.  Steve had not appreciated what a closed little secret the beginning of their relationship was; people seemed genuinely shocked that Banksy had been force-bonded in the first place.  Also unsurprisingly, most of them focused on the negative, not the positive.
"No, I'm really him," insisted Tony.  He pulled down his t-shirt to show the arc  reactor. The bartender's eyes got wide and she stopped laughing.  "And I
But before he could remember, the previously limp form scrambled to its feet, knocked him over, and tore off.
She couldn't have been older than ten. She was an omega, dressed in the same uniform the other kids had worn. The girl must have presented early to end up at the camp so young. She was clutching a teddy that looked like Tigger from Winnie the Pooh and was sucking on one of its ear, her eyes wide and timid. She waddled into the tent, keeping away from the sick. And then plopped down on the ground, ducking her head to see Tony on the floor.
. "F-fuck..." he panted, eyes rolling back as he rocked his hips, riding his orgasm out lazily. "Tony... oh,
He froze. There was a tight feeling in his chest, almost a cold sensation. He looked down at himself. Was this...was this Tony? Fuck. It was. "Sure, he can want to sleep with his best friend but the minute
"...uh... I was gonna take a break from Iron Man for a while," said Tony tactfully, reaching up to try to smooth down the hair at the back of his neck.  His fingers brushed his scar and the hair bristled even more.  He gave up and his hand dropped down.  "...maybe later," he mumbled grudgingly, wanting to give Steve
... wanna mate you..."
"Go on," Steve said when she hesitated, drawing her gaze back to him instead of the disapproving officials around her.
"Yes," said the asset.  The blond looked surprised at his response.  "I know. Colonel Karpov says we all have a role to play in making a better world, and that most are supposed to serve and to follow.  This is especially difficult for Americans because their minds have been poisoned with capitalist lies about individuality. But he says once you'd had a few pups you will naturally fall into your role and be content."
Tony wondered whose idea it had been.  Steve's, obviously.  Pepper and Happy were betas; they wouldn't have sensed it; Steve must have told them, asked to be locked away so Tony couldn't take him.  Tony had to admit he felt a little hurt.  He liked to think he was someone who could control himself.  Who flirted a lot, but knew when to draw the line.  Who could be trusted.  Then again, the effect Steve had had on him was so profound, he honestly wasn't sure.  Besides, who knew what Steve would have done in the heat (ha!) of the moment?  This was one of the hardest parts of omega rape trials: the question of how in control an omega was when they were in heat.  For some, heats were so intense that they destroyed any ability to think clearly.  They couldn't give consent any more than if they were piss-drunk.
