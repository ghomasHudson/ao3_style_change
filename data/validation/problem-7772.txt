going to come as soon as Steve touched him, and so he needed some self-restraint.
The anger still simmered just below the surface, ready to burst at any moment. He still couldn’t believe what Bucky had done- felt utterly fucking mortified at the way he’d treated Tony after the guy had literally dropped everything to come after him when he’d called. It was the most
Thor opened his mouth as if to argue, but something stopped him, and then he just nodded once. With a delicacy Steve hadn’t even known Thor to possess, the boy slipped out of Tony’s space and then helped him lie back down on the couch. Then he turned to Steve. “Thank you,” he breathed, and they felt like so much more than just two words when Thor looked at him like that.
“Please don’t,” Steve said, and then for good measure, he repeated, “I need to see Reed.”
Safe. Warm. Alive.
“Not from what I’m hearing.” Tony watched as the man scrambled hurriedly off the couch and then walked over toward the kitchen, his face breaking out into a happy smile as he set his eyes on Peter. Tony handed him over as soon as he came close enough. “Just listen to him, Steve, he’s definitely saying Bruce’s—”
“Tony, I promise, it’ll be fine.” Steve leaned down, catching his mouth in a light kiss. “If I need backup, I’ll call for it. What with your above-atmosphere Quinjets and a suit that can reach Mach 5 in the time it takes for me to blink, I’m sure there won’t be a problem.”
“Now you’ve really fucked it,” Tony told him quietly, looking up at the ceiling as Fury began to turn a shade of deep puce.
of his fingers as they hit the surface. He’d used to cut them into precise slices, when he was little. Or at least, his mom had. A rather random gesture, yes, but she’d always made sure he got four equal quarters with the sharpest knife in the cupboard that she’d never let him use himself. For a few months, he hadn’t wanted the skin at all, and made her cut that off too. She looked at him like he was mad, but done it all the same.
Oh God.
It had been… it’d been so long. Months. Steve had been abusing him for months, and Tony had taken all of it. He’d taken Steve hitting him. Steve insulting him. Steve- Jesus Christ, they’d been having sex almost every night, how much of that had Tony actually
He tapped his hand rapidly against the hard surface of his phone and then took another breath. Fine, it was fine, he was just antsy. Nothing would happen. The likelihood was slim to none, and he knew that. He knew the math, the statistics. He just wished his brain would fucking listen to them for once.
“We need to get him to his lawyer before he calls in the press and blows this up,” Steve waved at the injury on Tony’s forehead, “the last thing SHIELD needs is the whole world condemning them for torture practise. I know this is against protocol, but we don’t have time to get permission from the top brass.”
“There we go,” he whispered to no-one, to nothing, his smile tasting salty on his lips, “that’s better, ain’t it, ma?”
a gentleman,” he said, taking the outstretched hand. Steve didn’t seem fazed by the teasing, however- just smiled at him and then pulled them over to the elevator.
And History changed.
Later. Unfinished. He’d never made it home to put the lid back on.
Ten minutes later, and there were no more steps to take. Tony was ready to sleep. His mouth tasted like toothpaste and yet he still wanted it to taste like Malibu instead, feel it burn its way down his throat. He had no idea why tonight of all nights was so bad. Objectively, he’d gone through worse. It was probably that stupid Goddamn cocktail. The stupid fucking advertising manager. His own stupid fucking self.
Padding forward, he made his way to the living room. The TV was on, but turned down to an almost silent volume, and the couches appeared empty. Far off to the right, the windows of the tower glistened and tapped with the sound of rain against their panes. It was quiet. Peaceful.
“Has this happened before?” Steve asked quietly, just as Thor pulled out of his parking spot. The other boy glanced at him, and then turned back to the road.
Tony looked up at him. “Steve, have you just been out there climbing trees in your spare time today?”
Tony was silent for a moment, just looking up at him, like he knew that his fate was now hanging in the balance of his next words. There was a new gash, this one right on the middle of his forehead. It matched with the bloodstain on the table. Steve figured Rumlow must have smashed his head against it.
“If anyone had a problem, it’d be them leaving, not you,” Steve said simply, before pushing open the door and then leading Tony in. “Hey guys- Tony’s here.”
He jerked upward, staring at Tony through blurry eyes before something harsh caught in his throat and he choked, hands extending of their own accord. Tony was crouched on his haunches by the bed next to Steve, but he still managed to catch Steve as he fell straight off the edge and into his embrace, arms wrapping tight to whichever limb he could hold onto and head burying itself into the warmth of Tony’s pulse point in his neck. “I’m sorry,” he whispered hysterically, taking in a small breath just to breathe Tony’s scent in and get the aroma of death and fear out of his nose, “I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m-“
Steve froze. Looked at Fury, who looked back at him with a steely glare. They faced off for a few moments whilst Steve tried to process what the man had just said, but it didn’t quite go in. Eventually, he came to a simple conclusion:
Another pulse. Another flash. Tony was flat on his back again, but scrambling upright once more. God, his chest was aching. He couldn’t breathe. He had to keep going. Underneath him, Steve still wasn’t responding.
And just like that, Tony’s interest had been piqued. “What things,” he pressed, sitting up further onto his elbows and raising his eyebrows questioningly, “dirty things? I like those sorts of things.”
“Awww, come on, don’t do that!”
For instance, Steve was about to get into some of his own right about now.
Steve simply gawped at him. He wasn’t sure what else to do. Tony… Tony had really meant that. Steve knew when Tony was just blabbering for the sake of filling a room with noise and when he was telling the full, earnest truth. It was always in his eyes. The sincerity. The raw soul of him. And that was here, now, as Tony kept his hands curled firmly around Steve’s and he nibbled at his lip.
“So you
found ways to be happy, no matter what the circumstance.
Steve just shrugged, sitting back so that their shoulders were touching. “I thought it was sweet. Sort of. How did you meet them?”
Steve gave him a look that just screamed
Anonymous asked:
Steve dropped into the driver’s seat and slotted the key into ignition. “Pepper got in touch,” he explained, “said you weren’t doing too great.”
But just sitting in Tony’s workshop and waiting was slowly driving him insane. He had to do
“Take it back,” Tony mumbled, feeling the warm insides of Bruce’s thick jacket as it insulated him, “Bruce, you’re gonna—”
“Please, Steve,” he added when the man continued to remain stationary in the middle of the room.
I will get them together in the next chapter i promise. also, i apologize for the....messiness of this? idk i didnt really like it but... i just wanted them to bond over their shared trauma man so sue me.
Likely that Stone would press charges and it would become a police matter.
The way Tony spoke Italian was absolutely beautiful to Steve’s ears. No idea what he was saying, of course, but it didn’t matter. He would listen to Tony speak like that all day if he could. He’d even heard some words slip out last night- mostly ones he could understand- muttered curses and compliments, slurred from breathlessness, but just about audible, and making Steve even crazier. He didn’t know what it was about them, exactly. Maybe it was just because they came from Tony. But to him, they sounded like some of the most beautiful things in the world.
Steve just shut his eyes, sinking further into the softness of Tony’s faded Guns ‘N’ Roses t-shirt. He curled his fingers around Tony’s, his small and bony ones being nearly entirely encompassed by Tony’s long and agile ones.
The Baxter Building’s official hours were from 9 to 5. When Steve arrived, it was 4:45. This did not stop him.
getting hurt, whatever it is- I dunno what's happenin' in his head. But I know he likes you a lot. Because I only see him lookin’ that happy when he’s been around you, or he’s thinkin’ of you. Which means he’s gonna want you to stay away from him, obviously.”
He just so happened to pull up into the school parking lot at that moment, and Steve took the chance God had given him to get the fuck out of there before Bucky killed him. “Oh look we’ve arrived, thanks Buck, see you later!” He laughed loudly and undid his seatbelt, opening the door just as Bucky began pulling up on the curb. He fell out of the still-moving vehicle with a slight stumble, laughing even harder as Bucky stuck his middle finger up at him through the open passenger door.
the deal with that?” He asked sweetly.
Steve just shrugged smugly and held his arms open. “Well, no one’s stopping you from staying here,” he said, although Tony raised a disbelieving eyebrow.
“Except for the fact that I am not.”
“Hey, hey, shhh,” Tony’s arms snaked around his shoulders, pulling Steve’s shaking body up against his own. As much as Steve wished the tremors were faked, they were not. This… this was all true. “It’s okay, Steve. I know. I get it. It’s been—it’s been hell for me too. Every day, I’ve missed you. I didn’t deserve to, and I knew that you’d be better off without me, considering—well—everything that I was doing, but still, I wanted to find you. Apologise. Just see you again.” He curled a hand through Steve’s hair, the motion so familiar and soothing that Steve sunk deeper into Tony’s embrace without even meaning to. Bucky was still on tour with Sam, Peggy was dead and the anniversary would be coming up in a few months, and no one had touched Steve like this ever since he had left Tony the first time round. He wanted to cry and scream and rage and mourn.
Steve grinned, kissing his forehead. “Good,” he said, bouncing up the stairs again, “now let’s get you a spare change of clothes.”
“This is just Home Alone but with higher stakes,” Tony told him drily, rolling his eyes and waving around him. Rhodey shook his head and began to rebuke him, but Tony kept talking. “Christmas time, stuck at home, evil villains threatening us, creating traps out of arm-chairs and stove-tops? Macaulay Culkin called, Rhodey-Bear, and he’s asking for royalties. God, I can’t believe this.” Tony sighed. “You know, I blame Thor for this. Stupid stuff happens whenever we let Thor pick the holiday activities.”
Bucky was playing something obnoxious on the radio, but he turned it down and then turned to them all. “You have fun, kids?” He asked, leaning over the back seat in order to press a hello kiss into Natasha’s forehead.
, but at least this was going to be fixable. At least HYDRA hadn’t—they hadn’t done something irreversible. They hadn’t taken him from Tony completely.
When Room 7 loomed into view, Steve took a deep breath and then gingerly placed his hand around the doorknob leading to the observation deck. He turned his head just a little to the left and noted the next door along. Should he go through that one, he’d come face to face with Tony, inevitably sat shackled to the table in the interrogation room. As it was, Steve would be one the other side of the two-way mirror, blessed with invisibility.
Tony had been dangerously close to breaking point today, and Steve knew that if this kept up, he was going to get sick. His heart was already weak, for God’s sake- he didn’t need this stress, and Steve should absolutely not have allowed him to leave that morning without putting up more of a fight about it. He’d known that Tony was on edge. It’d been obvious from the moment he laid eyes on the other man. He should have done more.
Tony didn’t speak for a moment, but then he smiled lopsidedly. “I’ve seen better days, Winghead,” he murmured, “but I’ll live.”
He listened half-heartedly as she and Sam talked, but his mind was on other things. For example- the phone he was currently texting Tony on from under the table. And what he was going to do for his birthday on Saturday. And whether or not Tony would like his friends. And whether or not Tony would like the party.
“And I’ll make sure you don’t starve to death down there, won’t I?”
But hell. It was Christmas. And Tony had been creating plans ever since June, a lot of them far more intricate and over the top than this. Steve should be grateful he’d settled with a Christmas cracker. At one point in September, he’d been thinking more along the lines of a boat-based confession.
Tony chuckled. “Even?” He asked.
“I’ll see you ‘round, Steve Rogers,” he said, revving up the engine, “please don’t get into any more fights.”
to come,” he tried, but Tony just rolled his eyes and then pulled the most incredulous face he could muster as barged into the elevator next to him.
“No no, Rogers, don’t you dare-“
He looked behind him again, just for a second as he sprinted up toward Thanos, and privately thanked Wanda for being brave enough to do something he never could.
“Text him and tell him you’re okay and you’re with me, but I’m not driving you back,” Bucky shook his head, “Steve, the situation was dangerous for both of you. Just because he was having a crisis doesn’t make the things that he did to you okay. It might excuse them, but it doesn’t mean you should put yourself back in that environment again.”
Steve had lost his job, his apartment, his life as he knew it, and he didn’t even care.
He glanced down. Tony was asleep in his arms.
“She’s terrifying,” he informed Steve, who had just become perfectly aware of that fact, “more so than I ever could be- so I’m gonna go with the more human approach here.”
been in the kitchen right when Peter had started getting antsy?”
“Yep,” Darcy said, before Steve nudged her back, harder, and said “no” loudly.
He looked at Natasha, tears starting to slip down his cheeks. “Do whatever you have to,” he whispered, “I don’t care. Just… just make sure it’s out of my head. Please.”
you guys distracted me, I knew he was coming, holy shit, get down here and help me hide!” Clint hissed, looking around wildly at the half-opened suitcase and then kicking it back under the bed.
“This isn’t for you, Stark, didn’t you hear? Team training session, remember? Now get over yourself and listen to Cap,” Clint had called out, grinning over the lip of his mug.
They were both quiet again; Steve watching Tony in concern as the boy seemed to drift off a little bit- but a moment later he was back in the room, shooting a smile Steve's way. "Anyway, Rogers- tell me why on earth you bought a horrible vegan icecream when you quite obviously do not enjoy a single taste of it."
“I’ve got him.” Reed’s fingers squeezed reassuringly around Steve’s arm, and Sue didn’t say anything more as they made their way into the elevator. Steve heard her sniffle. She hadn’t known Tony well—at least not as well as Reed had. Maybe it was Steve who was upsetting her. He could imagine that watching someone fall apart like this would be difficult to watch. She must pity him.
Peggy turned the handle and walked in, looking around the room until her eyes settled on him and she sighed. “In all fairness,” she began, sitting gingerly on the edge of the bed, “I didn’t do much wrong besides stand there and watch the events unfold.”
“Sir,” JARVIS said once again, and the whole team looked automatically to the ceiling, “it appears social services have arrived at the tower and are requesting entry into the penthouse.”
Tony frowned, watching Peppa Pig as she and her friend tried to learn how to whistle on the screen. "Is Steve around?" He asked, hearing their negative grunts this time.
It’d be fine in the morning. Things always were.
Well. He obviously must have done, because it was
whilst looking at the watch
Tony… look at what I did—”
He grabbed an apple from the fruit bowl and chewed on it as he walked away, watching Peter while Peter watched him, hands still reaching out, trying to grab. It was only because Tony was the one who'd actually held him since he'd arrived here, though. Babies probably just... imprinted, or something, What the hell did Tony know?
Tony’s voice was filled with laughter as he pushed weakly against Steve’s chest, “I really have to go.”
Famous last words.
God, Steve had missed him.
But it wasn’t enough. Thanos was too strong. With a deep growl, the Titan threw Steve off his back, sending him hurtling into unforgiving rock and then finishing it with a punch to the face. Steve’s vision swam and the world blackened for a few moments as he faded out of consciousness.
He looked down at it, realising he’d moved to the bed. Calmly, he dropped the apple on his bedside table and then crossed his legs.
Right. So wherever Iron Man—
He couldn’t respond. His mouth wouldn’t work, his whole body was frozen up. He wanted to tell Steve to put it back in, put his heart back into his body, but he couldn’t make the words come out. Instead, he just twitched his fingers, the ones that were curled around the reactor. His eyes rolled shut and the world around him started to go dim as unconsciousness took hold, the only thing he was able to feel was Steve’s weak hands clutching his shoulders in panic and confusion.
“Tony,” he declared, numb.
The line cut out pretty quickly after that, and Steve remained seated at the table, staring into space ahead of him for a good minute before slowly standing up and making his way toward his bedroom, undoubtedly to fetch his computer.
The man got across the road quickly. His ballet shoes were hanging off his neck and-
He leaned up, kissing Tony’s forehead. “But whatever you do, you have me. And if anyone could pull it off, I know it’s you. You’re the smartest guy I know. You’re resourceful. You have contacts and friends everywhere. You could make it. I absolutely believe that.”
“You’re a genius,” Steve answered his own question before Tony could. It was... it made sense, he supposed. The phone tracking. Science club. The designs that covered each section of his room and the equations he’d sometimes seen scribbled over the back of his hand that he’d assumed were just revision notes.
Steve didn’t say anything for a moment, and Tony could sense his discomfort from across the room. But then he shrugged, trying to claim indifference. “Fine,” he said, just edging on snappily, “night.”
They were in the middle of a fucking
of his own clothes, everyone probably would have just let it slide. Tony honestly hadn’t done it intentionally- he was just tired and a little shaken from the lovely morning nightmare that had served as his wakeup call, and Steve’s clothes were soft and big and smelt really nice.
“Don’t let anyone else sit on your right,” he felt himself whisper, which he felt, somehow, was not what he had been intending on saying.
Then he made the mistake of trying to sit up on his right elbow, and suddenly the pain became a hell of a lot worse again.
Tony stopped again, and Steve knew what was coming next. The fall from grace- the descent into madness that inevitably came whenever you lost someone. He swallowed heavily and tilted his head, kissing Tony’s shoulder in the best offer of support he could manage. There was no way to make this any easier except showing he was there, really.
God, this was a mess. What the hell was Tony supposed to do now? What was
“You should be resting,” she said immediately. No beating around the bush then. Okay.
Steve nodded rapidly. “I know. I’m sorry. I was… I was panicking, I didn’t think.”
“Best one yet,” he responded simply.
“…I fell over,” he replied sulkily.
Steve looked at him for a good, long while before tentatively closing his fingers around Tony’s wrist, terrified of the answer he would receive from it. But it was okay. There was a pulse. Tony was alive.
“Yeah,” Steve laughed quietly, “yeah, she was terrifying if you got on the wrong side of her, for sure. And God forbid you didn’t take out the trash when she asked- you’d think I just got up and spat all over the window or something.”
kinda hungry.”
“Yeah,” she told them, “I, uh- don’t have an excuse. I just don’t want to have him in my room tonight.” And then she turned tail and swiftly walked away, not looking behind her as she hopped into the elevator. Tony and Steve looked at one another, faces creasing.
He curled his spare hand around Steve’s neck, biting on his lip hard enough that it drew blood. Hot, panicked tears were starting to crawl up into his eyes. “Please,” he whispered, vision going blurry and darkening around the edges, “please, wake up, come on, for me Steve.”
He looked down toward his chest as he felt Tony stir, and gently ran his fingers through the dark head of hair beneath him. So soft- longer, now, than it had been before. He tilted his chin and pressed a kiss into the curls, and with a soft hum, Tony settled back into him. Complete trust.
It barely took ten minutes for Steve to set the whole thing up.
Steve had just nodded, unable to do much else as Tony had limped his way back out of the room, not looking at Steve as he’d gone and then leaving him to the quiet of their empty room. Considering the way his evenings had usually gone in the weeks before this, it wasn’t a particularly welcome change.
DUM-E rolled back over to him and dropped the ball on the coffee table with a metallic clink. Steve grinned as he picked it up. “You should install Heelys on this guy,” he commented as he threw the ball gently.
“Buce! Buce! Buban!”
“Hey, love.”
The meetings had been boring and tiresome and interspersed with sly comments that Tony had been too damn tired to even respond to properly, the MIT opening had been okay until a bunch of protesters showed up and told him he was a bloodthirsty killer who needed to give up Iron Man and spend the rest of his life in jail, and he’d been so on-edge for all of it that he’d ended up nearly clocking Happy in the cheek when he’d tapped Tony on the shoulder.
“Please,” Tony lurched forward, trying to catch one of their eyes. The amount of times Tony had ever begged in a situation involving his work-life were so few and far between that Tony could count them on one hand, but in that moment, he didn’t care. He didn’t give a shit. “Please, there’s a child in there. He’s just a boy, they’re going to take him, please, please don’t do this. His name is Peter. He’s just a baby, not even a year old. Please, I’ll do anything—”
“No time like the present,” Natasha shrugged, and then paused, eyes widening a little. “That… that was not a pun. If any of you mention that ever again I’ll break your fingers.”
He put the tablet down back on the desk and then shifted nervously on the stool where he was sat. Steve just watched, waiting for something. The oncoming anger. The yelling. Tony telling him that he’d done what needed to be done, and he’d fixed Steve up, and now Steve needed to get out of his life, for good this time. It wouldn’t be any less than what he deserved.
“He’s just doing it to get a rise out of you, Steve,” he muttered next to Steve’s ear, eyeing up Zeke with distaste while the boy just laughed at them both, “believe me, he’s not worth that. Just leave it.”
Steve opened his mouth, but then they both heard the door open quickly and the footsteps of someone running into the room, and both of them froze in their vent.
“So you shoved him.”
It was Thursday by the time he finally made the decision to go visit his mom again. It had been too long since his last visit, and in a way, he thought it might just be nice to see her again. To talk to her in the way he’d used to, even if there was no one to respond now. He thought about asking Bucky or Peggy or Tony to come with him- but they were all busy or out of town, and Steve didn’t want to bother them. He could do it alone. He had every other time.
He reached Sublevel 5 a few seconds later and opened up the heavy door as quietly as possible. When he stepped into the long metal corridor, more corpses came into view, and Tony took a minute to process the level of damage that had been done here. He often forgot just how much harm Steve was really capable of- how the soldier could see bullets as they flew past and decapitate people with a single punch. But here, in front of him, it was made startlingly clear.
“I’m not having a fucking episode, Tony, Jesus, yes, you can touch me.”
Tony disappeared up the stairs a few seconds later and Steve turned to the cupboards, analysing their contents critically. He could feel the gazes of his team-mates staring at him. “He’s okay,” Steve assured them all, knowing the question that was on the tips of all their tongues, “he’s doing better. It was just… a lot, I think. Been a stressful few weeks.”
. The weight of Steve’s movement as he reached up to grab his mug of coffee from the shelf, how far away he was from Tony, how long it’d take to reach him if he got angry. All completely stupid, ridiculous calculations that he forced himself to try and stop- but it just happened. Reflex.
Tony caught his eye from the reflection of the mirror and then smiled. “Perv,” he muttered.
“How can you even
Steeling himself, he stepped away, pulling out the zippo lighter that he’d found in the pocket of another HYDRA corpse. There was enough jet-fuel, pine-tree branches and clothes-polyester to blow a building apart. It would surely catch the attention of any search-party or JARVIS-based drone that was on the lookout around these areas. Which, by this point, he really hoped there was. Otherwise they were
Tony scoffed, removing Steve’s hand to speak. “Believe me, this would be my pleasure. I’m pretty sure Fury’s out for my head this week anyway, so I need somewhere to lay low. Don’t sweat it, Rogers, I’ve got it all sorted.”
. You are…you are the last thing that I would ever feel any sort of embarrassment or shame toward. You’re the damn smartest decision I’ve ever made. Why the fuck would I ever regret that, or want to hide it? That’s the fucking thing-“
Steve rolled his eyes, picking up all the groceries. “Yeah, well, I’m not exactly known for my self preservation instincts.”
Bruce frowned. “Try not to,” he said, placing his hand on Tony’s shoulder, “it’s going to come back with time, but until then, we’ll be fine without you. You don’t need to worry.”
of October, and Tony cried, and said yes about a hundred consecutive times. It had been perfect. They had been perfect.
He wheezed, looking around the empty room. He could feel the tears on his face. Fucking pathetic.
The door slammed open beneath them and they heard Clint scream “NOT ME, PLEASE, STEVE AND TONY ARE IN THE VENTS, GET THEM INSTEAD!”
good with robots. Robots were his specialty, thank you very much, and he wasn’t about to be killed by one in his own home.
So he stayed still and buried his head back into the pillow, drifting off into a lazy half-sleep.
"Okay, so I'm not the only one who's seeing this, right?" Clint blurted, pointing a finger at the small mass cradled in Tony's arms, "there is definitely a baby person there."
God—he just wanted to make sure Tony wouldn’t do something he’d regret. Steve had made sure not to react to Tony’s words, but hell, the man’s admission earlier had scared him.  Tony was without doubt the strongest man that Steve knew, but sometimes the amount of responsibilities piled up on his plate would be enough to topple God himself. Steve just wanted to help.
He got to his feet and left for the corridor slowly, glancing out of the window and seeing Peter and a few of his little friends chatting outside. Peter caught his eye and grinned cheekily, and Steve just rolled his eyes. No doubt the kid felt all smug after his stupid advice had ended up actually helping a little bit. He threw a hand and waved lazily, and then continued down the corridor with a shake of his head.
Right.
. And it wasn’t like the final piece of them had finally fitted into place- Tony would still feel totally, utterly complete if it was just him and Steve together for the rest of their lives. But… But maybe it was just like the cherry on top. The egg-sheen on a pastry that made the whole thing shine.
His phone rang again, and he gritted his teeth together as he checked the number. It was unknown, so he just rejected it, seeing as anyone important to him would have been established in his contacts already. However, as soon as he rejected the call, the phone rang again, same number. Steve sighed irritably and lifted it to his ear. “Who is this?
“Happy birthday,” he said in a tone that might have been considered cheerful, to no one at all, and pretended that he couldn’t feel the cool absence of a ring banded around his finger as he poured the liquid down his throat.
He blinked. Fine fine fine fine fine.
“Do you want a star, Steve?” Tony asked suddenly, after a few seconds spent staring.
It becomes obsessive. He revises it every night, adding and removing and keeping a constant ear out for JARVIS’s quiet words of ‘Miss Romanov has had night-terrors for nights in a row. Medium Risk,’ or ‘Doctor Banner watched a news-reel of his Hulk form tearing through a Hospice and this is the third day he has gone without food- immediate risk’. It rarely happens, but Tony had been caught out the first time. It wouldn’t happen again.
“Thor?” Steve blurted in surprise, and the boy’s head jerked over to him, eyes going wide before they registered it was only Steve and relaxed, “what are you doing down here?” He looked down at his watch. If Thor had managed to get all the way down to the bottom of the hill in the two minutes that school had ended, and been there for long enough to light up, then the guy must’ve goddamn sprinted.
“Sorry,” Tony muttered, hands holding tight to the steering wheel, “I know it’s… a lot.”
Tony gaped in betrayal. “What? We’re not even having sex?”
“Just out of curiosity, what exactly did you do?” Tony asked, shoving his hands in his pockets and leaning his head back against the wall. He looked absolutely casual- he probably made this trip on a weekly basis, after all.
, Rumlow.”
get mugged, all I hear is that Steve went out and suddenly found himself at your house, with you refusing to let us see him. Then you swan back in here and he’s wearing your jacket, and don’t think I fucking know what people like you do to people like him, Stark, I’m not fucking blind-“
He trailed off into a sharp inhale as Steve moved again and started sucking on his neck, and Steve grinned a little against his skin, letting his hands move from Tony’s shoulders to his chest to his waist before stopping at his shirt, giving an experimental tug. They were home alone, as per usual whenever Steve visited Tony’s place- he’d said Howard was on a 2 week business trip- and so that meant they had the whole house to themselves, for the whole night.
He stepped into the machine and looked to the small control panel, trying to find the one that would shut the chamber door and catapult him back in time. They liked to overcomplicate things, did the Tescillians. A lot of buttons for relatively few actions. He found what he was looking for a second later, however, and without a second thought, he pressed down on the panel.
He smiled, glancing back to Steve and then picking up the Christmas cracker between them. “I suppose I ruined the surprise with my delirious pain-babbling,” he began clumsily, suddenly realising that he’d just kissed Steve, and Steve knew exactly what Tony wanted, and he was trying to play that off but he was pretty sure Steve could see him blustering, because Steve was good at reading him, always had been. “But for the sake of showbiz, let’s pretend you don’t know what goodies are inside this otherwise innocuous Christmas cracker.”
On the surface, nothing seemed wrong. Steve was fine. A little ragged, maybe, but fine. He acted in the same way, smiled at Tony no differently, scolded Clint no less.
Tony smiled at him and then took his spare hand into his own, pulling them both back into the living room smoothly. They didn’t share many words as Tony settled them both into the couch and pulled the blankets up over them, and for that Steve was grateful. Tony must have been able to tell that he wasn’t feeling quite up to normal conversation. He was really good at spotting things like that. Instead, he pulled his arms around Steve’s slim waist and then tucked himself close, grabbing the remote and then switching the TV on to some of episodes of
Tony blushed, beginning to smile- right up until he heard Steve's voice snap at the archer. "Don't be stupid, Clint."
“Tony, you can barely see straight, you’re not even using the right language—”
“I love you,” Steve said, not fast at all, nor blurted. The words were calculated, thought out. Steve wanted to say them. “I love you so, so much.”
He shook his head. “I’m fine,” he muttered, “I just… I think I need to go home.”
Uh oh.
But rather than frowning and pulling him up on it, Steve just blushes a little bit deeper, and Tony watches his eyes flicker down very briefly, before dragging themselves back up immediately and only making the blush go even darker, and at this rate Steve is going to be a motherfucking tomato, or his cheeks are going to burst open from too much blood rushing around in them.
"Well then, Steve Rogers, you don't know half as much about me as you think you do, then," Tony stuffed his hands in his pockets and leaned back against the lockers, turning his head sideways to look at Steve through red-rimmed eyes. Steve hated how he could still look so good, despite his obvious lack of sleep and schoolyard drug abuse. It was just unfair.
“The quinjet is equipped with seven heat-tracking missiles and an inbuilt double-barrelled machine gun,” JARVIS reeled off, and the weapon-areas of the cockpit lit up as he spoke. At that same moment, the speaker-system crackled to life above Steve’s head, and the familiar tones of Tony’s voice filled the vicinity.
The Thing hadn’t actually managed to make it that far into the city; Iron Man was doing a good job of herding it away and keeping it close to the coast. But Steve got the feeling that it wasn’t actually the city it wanted to destroy. Most of its attention was focused on fighting with Tony, trying to land whatever hit it could, and as good as Iron Man was, the thing was getting in a few heavy blows. Steve couldn’t be much help; none of the missiles were landing anyway, and if Steve got too close then the robot was just going to swipe him straight out of the sky. JARVIS had already had to dodge a few potshots being sent his way.
This pause was long, stagnant. Steve told his arm to extend, stretch out, grab one of his sweaters from the closet. The arm managed to perform the task almost perfectly.
Thor didn’t waste another second. He stumbled backward and then sprinted after the LMD that was making its way up the stairs, his hand extended and summoning Mjolnir into his grasp. Tony turned back around, watching Steve flip back onto his feet and then leap into the air, his foot snapping out into a front kick. But Michael moved with unnerving speed, slapping Steve’s leg out of the way as he stumbled out of the danger zone. Natasha was hot on his heels, however; an arm snaking around the LMD’s neck and attempting to hurl him over her hip. Tony grabbed Bruce’s arm and looked at the other man, his eyes clenched shut and his breathing coming in steady. Tony needed to help the other two- but first of all, he needed to stop an oncoming Hulk Incident. They couldn’t afford that- not unless they’d expended all other options.
Steve raised his eyebrows at Thor and then shook his head, bumping their shoulders together. Now the storm had passed, he felt like he was more grounded to Earth again, and he realized quite how cold he truly felt. He was aware that they probably looked like total messes; stood shoulder-to-shoulder in some tiny graveyard, both of them about two sentences away from straight up crying- and yet Steve could only feel strangely grateful that at least he wasn’t alone in his melancholy. Thor was right here with him, standing steady, and showing Steve a part of himself that quite clearly never came out very often. It meant a lot.
“Yeah, because I’m voluntarily going to share a home with Wilson.”
, JARVIS!”
But then they rang again, and he heard Sam shrieking something that sounded a lot like ‘your room’s closest!’ from across the hall-  which really didn’t leave Steve with a lot of other options.
“Don’t worry about it,” Tony waved off the apology instinctively, sliding his feet back to the floor and standing, “no big deal. Don’t blame your friends for worrying- I’m not exactly known for being nice.”
They’re just fine with that. In fact, life could throw pretty much anything at them, and they’d probably do alright with it.
“You’re not angry,” Steve eventually declared, confusion laced through his voice, “why aren’t you… aren’t you gonna…you should be angry.”
to be. There couldn’t have been any other reason you hadn’t noticed how I reacted to it.”
Steve looked horrifiedly at the boy squirming excitedly in his hands for a few seconds, before sighing in relief and placing him back down on the floor, where he instantly began running back to the tv in the living room, still full of energy in a way only kids that age were.
Three hours ago, Tony had been lying on the floor of the sidewalk with a hole in his head, while Steve held him up in his arms and begged him to wake up.
Peter gurgled in response, fat little legs poking Tony's midsection. Still glaring suspiciously, Tony set the coffee maker to work, one hand keeping Peter from tumbling off the counter as the other grabbed for his mug. He needed a damn big caffeine fix this morning.
Tony jerked to a stop, eyes sliding away from Steve’s. He clearly had been trying to think about anything other than that. “Yeah,” was all he said, voice a little too rough to be casual. He stood at Steve’s side, med-kit in hand, and looked down at him, face creased in concern. “So, you fancy telling me what the fuck is going on?”
“Huh, you ever considered the fact that maybe if you’d given more of a shit about your fucking boyfriend I wouldn’t have had to go haul ass down here to pick him up in the first place?” Tony asked, cocking his head, and Steve knew that look- he was gearing up for a fight, he was getting battle ready- “Who the fuck thinks it’s a good idea to send someone who doesn’t know where the fuck they’re going or what parts of the town are safe off to get pizza? On his own? Whilst all your fucking phones are switched off? I’m not the one who fucked him over today,
“What do you want?” Hawkeye snapped at them, his arrow still drawn, ready for whatever. “What did you come here for? Not just to piss us off, surely?”
Steve’s eyes widened in surprise at the aggressiveness of Tony’s words, and his hand reached out, tugging him back the same way that Tony had done for him a few seconds previously. Zeke was staring at him, his mouth a little agape as Tony stepped back and continued to glare unwaveringly at him.
“Man, no offense, but are you blind? Did you not say the way he was looking at you when he came over with all your stuff last week? Don’t be dense, that boy would get on his knees and
“You weren’t exactly looking like it.”
Tony steeled himself and then stepped over the first body, making his way down the stairwell. “I can’t wait,” he gritted, “Steve needs me. I’m not going to just sit around.”
It was hard to believe, even now, months on, that he had this. That not only did he get Tony for himself, but that he had influence over him. Not in a twisted or manipulative way- God, Steve would never- but just… it meant so much. That Tony had given him the power to hurt him, because he trusted that Steve never would.
Steve shifted, then, slipping back out of the covers. Tony briefly panicked and thought that he was going to walk out, but instead he headed over to the desk, bending down a little and pulling open one of the drawers. Tony watched him pluck something out and then turn back around, fist closed. He got into bed again and pulled Tony’s hand up, placing the sobriety coin into the flat of his palm before closing Tony’s fingers around it and covering them with his own. Tony just stared intently at their hands, feeling the cool surface of the coin against his sweaty skin. His hands, he realised, were shaking.
“I… assume it is something to do with him being unsure of the nature or boundaries within your relationship, after everything that happened.”
But he was tapping, and he was slurring his words a little and
He refused to stay in the hospital after the third day. Apart from his Brain Fucking, nothing else much was wrong with him, and a hospital was a dangerous place to be for someone as bored and inventive as Tony Stark could get. The team made a few half-assed attempts to keep him in, but were fully aware they were in vain, and eventually they just let Natasha go start the car as the rest of the team escorted him out of the building.
There was a long silence; both of them standing off at the door, hands held firmly in pockets or against door-frames. Steve held his resolve for all of three more seconds before huffing irritably and pulling Bucky forward into a tight hug.
And that was enough. That was all it took.”
as he said “oh,” very quietly and then looked down, his hand slipping dejectedly off Tony’s lap.
Tony paused for a moment, before returning the smile and walking over. He still hadn’t put on any pants. He needed to get his head straight before heading out today, otherwise things were just going to be a fucking mess. With as much nonchalance as he could muster, he walked into Steve’s open arms and then shut his eyes when he felt Steve wrap himself around Tony’s midsection and bury his head into Tony’s shirt. His hands were warm and firm against Tony’s back, and he leaned into the hold, his head bowing as he curled his forearms over Steve’s shoulders and sank into the other man. Steve’s fingers rubbed gentle circles into the knots across his back. “Maybe you should take a day,” the man murmured, “stay in. The work will still be there tomorrow.”
They were getting in the way of everyone walking by as they stood in the corridor. And listen- Steve didn’t
A scared, seventeen-year old boy, who just needed his friends to be there for him, not fucking cause him even more Goddamn grief. Fuck, Steve was supposed to be the one comforting him right now, not the other fucking way round. What was he doing?
“Yes I do.” Steve nodded firmly, and atop his head, the ears jiggled with enthusiasm. It might have been funny, had Tony any brain power left to expend upon the sight. “You made a mistake, you said some things that hurt me. But then I refused to try and resolve anything, and rather than explaining things to you in a calm manner and letting you arrive at your conclusion in a healthy way, I walked off and left you to stew in all those thoughts of yours. And that was my mistake. I… I forget that you’re not like everyone else, Tony. I forget that you would actually listen to me, and I’m sorry for that.” Steve seemed genuinely earnest when he said it, and that in itself was enough to make Tony feel like his cognitive functions were going into meltdown. He had about a dozen different hormones buzzing through him right now, his body’s preparation for the inevitable sadness, and now they had nowhere to go. Because apparently the events of this night were not ones that would end with a breakup.
Tony stared at them for another few seconds, before a smile broke out on his face, and he looked at Clint, eyes sparkling. “Thank you. I’m going to savour the fuck out of these for
“Steve?” Tony’s face fell a little, and Steve realised the emotion must have started to leak onto his face. “You okay?”
“You’re making this sound way worse than it is,” Steve argued weakly, knowing full well that he was blushing like an idiot now.
“Thank you,” he said quietly, looking up at her. She curled an arm through his and walked them both up the steps. That was a great thing about Natasha- people got out of the way when she walked through a crowd. It was probably the face- the combination of strikingly gorgeous and utterly murderous was always one to strike fear into the souls of even the toughest teenagers.
He noticed Tony looking at him blankly, and couldn’t help feeling like he was going about this wrong. “I’m just… glad you’re okay,” he said, and Tony’s answering face wasn’t exactly comforting.
“What?” Steve said in bewilderment, and then there were more faces, concerned, yelling, and he blinked and he was somewhere else, shit, how had that happened? Hospital. White. Heart monitor. Was he dying?
Clint paused, surprised for a moment. But like a shark sensing blood in the water, he quickly latched on, breaking out in a dangerous smile again as he twirled his spoon around his fingertips. “Wow, okay then Cappo, don’t blow your fucking top, I was only joking. Maybe just shuffle a little bit- the stick up your ass must have been pushed a little further up this morning.”
Steve glowered at Tony, who just smiled innocently back and threw on his spare coat. Fucking idiot looked great in denim, too. Fuck him double.
“Bruce is right. I’m not having sex in hospital.”
Steve didn’t know how to carry on the conversation after that, so he quietly left, took up position back on the rooftop. That was where he stayed most days, now. Just waiting for Carol to bring Tony back home. Tony would know what to do about all this. Tony would fix it.
“Shut up, grumpy sod,” Peggy poked him with her foot and rolled her eyes, “he’s happy, look at him.”
But dammit, the opportunity was just too good to miss.
“Did I kill him,” he choked out, tasting the bile on his tongue and sensing the revulsion that quickly consumed him, “did I—Tony. Did I kill Tony?”
“Do you have him, Rogers?”
Tony gasped, because air wouldn’t come, air never fucking came properly any more, and his heart just hurt, like a constant pain where Steve and Clint and Natasha and-
. Tony deserved to get put on trial for his crimes and serve justice for what he’d done
“The Wrecking Crew appear to have begun a raid on Wall Street. They’re currently in the National City Bank, and reports are coming in saying they’ve got hostages.”
Steve pouted. “We can be quiet.”
“I’d say you could make it up to me, but I’m guessing your walls are pretty thin, and as much as I’d love to put Wilson through something as traumatic as that, it’s not quite the impression I want to make on his parents,” Tony mumbled against Steve’s mouth, his hands dropping from Steve’s neck to his chest, pushing him down until he was lying flat-out on the bed.
"Stevie we can go to the lake near which we dream of having our house !"
"SHUT UP !!" Shouted the couple in question .
They were in Tony’s workshop in Malibu, yeah, you read that right ‘Malibu’ . Tony had to complete the building but he also had to attend a business meeting with Viastone, Ty Stone’s company so he dragged Steve to Malibu .
His eyes glistened with the little un-shedded droplets that hung to his lashes, he closed his eyes, making the lashes collapse and allowing The tears to go free.
"You forgot we were coming with you guys for dinner" Clint said giving Stevie and Tony a hand to stand up.
"Tony listen, I don’t care whatever you were doing but be here when we call you" Steve growled as all the worms disappear and all of them take a sigh of relief
"Natasha Romanoff" she replied curtly
Unbeknownst to him, Steve Rogers witnessed everything.
"Then don’t attend The Praemium Imperiale" she sighed
Steve came to an abrupt stop as they reached the main hall "Holy shit, this is where they do the award ceremony !?"
"And he was still in shower"
It would be the first time they see her.
—-x—-
Steve reddened a little as he laughed it off "I am a fan…my brother doesn’t likes it though he says that ‘it’s not how brain-washing works’" he explained with air quotes
"Of course not"
"So, I —like any normal person— was looking around and accidentally read a poem"
"You’ll have drunk episode like last year" her lips pressed in a thin line "is that what she thought ?"
"I was drunk" Tony defended
He couldn’t help but wonder ‘what would steve’s speech be like ? Is he humorous like Clint or poker faced reader like Nat ? Or he gives speeches like he behaves ? Stuck up with a rod up his ass Tony rolls his eyes, definitely the last one…
he stopped in his tracks "
"Ahhhhh !!" Steve's shout echoed
Tony turned to look at Steve "Before I make Mr. Roger’s neighbourhood joke— Steve ?" Tony’s mouth went dry as the blonde blinked rapidly and nodded
"He’s been texting me all morning"
"Tony" Steve gave a warning in ‘Captain America is disappointed in you’ voice
He was the adopted son of Tony and Steve Stark-Rogers , who'd dare to hurt him ? Turns out many people would love to hurt him.
Tony looked up, finally looking into his eyes "I’ll hurt you" his voice wavered
"I was waiting for you to notice me but you were too busy ogling a certain someone…" he looked at the red-head beside him
"She-She is in the incubator"
If looks could kill ? Natasha Romanoff would be six feet under
"Yes ?"
YAY ? No.
"Haha you are funny Rogers"
"Seriously ? You ask that right after giving me a heart attack ! And I here thought you were a Boy Scout, helping people with conditio—"
"Am not Tony, I maybe good at sports but I am an average student, I try to save everyone and try to be better but never succeed, I am too attached to the past, to Bucky to move on and all of this" she said animatedly moving her hands "still feels like a dream a dream with people , ideas, technology and houses much more better and accepting than before but still doesn't feels like home 'cause I left my home when I went in ice, I left Stevie Rogers behind, I thought I lost my heart too but you made me realise that it's still here, within me and won't go even if I became a capsicle" they chuckle wetly "three thousand times.Tony my point is I am not perfect even with being myself but you, you are. I maybe perfect in being captain America but I failed to be Stevie Rogers but you succeeded in being Tony Stark and I envy you for that so, don't change who you are for someone who doesn't understands you"
"Are you alright ?"
"Steve" he tried the name "I am Tony Stark—"
"Easy big guy, you just gave birth" he said with a fake grin
He knew where this was going, he wanted this, hell he wanted this ever since he met Tony…but does it mean the same thing to Tony as it does to Steve ?
" the said man looked at him with baby blue innocent eyes
Warnings: NONE
“Sounds perfect.”
"Yeah, AIM Academy, those bastards. God, I hate ‘em. Boo, AIM Academy!” He yells out, to no one in particular. “You suck!”
“Back atcha, big guy,” Tony says, and lets out a long, heavy breath when he feels Steve lean in and press a kiss to his forehead.
By the time Tony lets out a loud sigh as he stirs his mug, Steve’s shoulders are shaking from his efforts to keep his laughter inside.
“You’re lucky I love you.”
“Yeah? Well don’t.”
“You, uh--” he clears his throat, feeling uncharacteristically hesitant. “You cold?”
“Otherwise, we’d be having words. Maybe with feelings.”
“Probably not.”
“Ass.”
Summer of Stony prompt #20: “Wait a minute. Are you jealous?”
,” Natasha hisses.
“Yeah?” Steve asks, voice as soft as his eyes are hopeful, and really, he has no business looking better than anything Tony’s ever seen. “Shit, okay, that’s– oh man, I’m actually feelin’ a little lightheaded again…”
“But they’re here,” he hisses, fidgeting in his seat.
“He's my baby, of course I was! So fuck you.”
“We’re not buying a dog.”
"You are actually hopeless, y'know that?"
A hushed silence falls over his tiny passengers, every eye suddenly aimed his way expectantly. Even Steve looks impressed.
“Steve,” Tony says softly, and watches his boyfriend take a deep breath before meeting his eyes.
“You done?” He forces the words out, and feels relief when they come out smooth and calm.
Steve Rogers has to die.
,” he says, “you’re the loveliest, baby.”
“I don’t mind. But you’re the only one I wanna start the day with.”
“I--”
“Worth it. What’s your excuse?”
“Love you too, darling.”
“You don't even go here, how do you know just know these things? Why am I just finding out about this now?”
“What?” Steve breathes.
“That sounds about right,” she ribs him, tossing him the balloon she’s just finished tying up and laughing when it manages to hit him right on the forehead.
and the
“I really do,” Tony says. “But in case you don’t,” he points to where Rhodey’s still sitting and glaring at him, “I spilled my coffee all over the table-- and all over my friend-- the second I heard your voice. Sorry, honey bear,” he calls out, but Rhodey just flips him off.
“Uh huh,” she nods, and then points to the trees framing the path they’re walking. “Twees!”
“I’ll even let you rip this sweater off me.”
Warnings: NONE.
Tony revels in the thrill of anticipation that runs through him even as he feels his face grow warm. “Knock yourself out then, soldier,” is all he gets to say before warm lips are pressed against his own, and the world beyond their bed falls away. Steve kisses him slowly, tenderly, with so much love, it almost brings Tony to tears, and as he cups the blond’s jaw with trembling hands to deepen the kiss, he hopes Steve can feel just how much Tony loves him in turn.
Steve writes.
“Yes, ma’am.”
“Rhodey? Out looking for parking. I think.”
He’s a little shit.
Steve feels dizzy from relief, from the sheer amount of love he feels for this man, and can’t help the kiss he presses to Tony’s soft, tousled hair, only managing a strangled “good”.
“You just wanna get me outta this thing, dontcha?”
And yet, for all that he’s done that, he has yet to actually
“Nope, can’t fool me, big guy,” Tony replies, even as he inches his head just a little bit closer to Steve’s. “I’m onto you.”
“Wouldn’t want it any other way,” Pepper hears Steve say, and smiles into the cushion she’s curled into. “I can’t… remember the last time I was this happy.”
“My godfather spoke highly of your dad,” Cap says.
“Yes it does, just– look, turn your head like… like that. Do you see it?”
The voice is low and warm, with an undercurrent of amusement that relaxes Tony immediately.
“Tony...” Steve starts, but Tony shakes his head, rubbing his cheek against the head tucked into his shoulder.
“Tony, you know my Ma’s always happy to have you. I bet she’ll make plates of French toast when she finds you here in the mornin’,” Steve grins softly. His hair’s already tousled and matted from sleep, and really, Tony thinks as he settles in next to him, that’s an unfairly lethal combination.
“Hmm?”
“How’s that for lovey-dovey?”
Which means that Tony’s not hearing
Warnings: NONE.
Steve rolls his eyes, but returns the smile. “Please don’t call me that,” he replies, and holds out the container. “But here, I, uh… made you these.”
There’s a cool, whisper-soft touch on his cheek.
“Yeah?”
“Much obliged.”
Blondie laughs. “Sure do,” he nods. “I’m not a crazy creep or anythin’.”
“Did I wake you?”
“Sure it’s not… If it was, though, I’d be winning.”
Towards
the best plan, but I…” Tony looks up at the ceiling, and swallows to keep his voice steady. “I hate that we had to do this. I hate that I had to be the one to hold you. I hate… I fucking hate that I’m gonna have nightmares about this-–”
“You wouldn’t.”
The pain in his voice is almost worse than Tony’s own wound. “Better me than you, though, right?”
“No.”
Warnings: NONE.
“I do,” Tony nods. “So quit trash talking our new apartment. It’s a fucking palace, okay?”
Tony moves past the table, laden with plates of steaming food and ice cold beer bottles, and steps close into Steve’s space. “Well, ain’t you a sweetheart,” he purrs, wrapping his arms around the blond’s neck to press their bodies together.
“You’re hopeless,” Steve sighs, but he knows his smile-- the one that now matches Tony’s-- says otherwise.
Rhodey blinks. "B'cause..."
“Sorry,” he whispers against Steve’s shoulder.
“Is there any way we can, y’know, skip the scans?” the brunet asks when Steve turns back to him, fiddling with the edge of one sleeve. “I’m… not a fan of small spaces.” He sounds anything but cocksure now, and even though he’s pretty much a stranger, Steve feels a warm rush of protectiveness sweep over him.
Steve raises his eyebrows. “You sure? ‘Cause that’s a mighty big task. I was kinda expectin’ you to already have a place in mind.”
“Now stand up, smooth out those damn wrinkles, and get the hell out. Coulson, go with them.”
Instead of the panic that Steve thinks he should be feeling, he sighs, dropping his pencil atop the sketchbook in his lap. “What is it now?”
“Maybe you’re not around when I do,” Steve mumbles, looking adorably shy even as he squares his shoulders.
“Not my fault you came home in full regalia. Feels like it’s my birthday too,” Tony winks. “Besides, I like to keep you on your toes.”
,” he winks. “And let’s do this out in the quad, yeah?? Can’t even breathe in here without Hair Bun over there glaring daggers, Christ...”
“Adorable isn’t what I’m going for, you know.”
Fucking ferris wheel. Fucking glitch...
“Yes?”
“I didn’t mean…
“Why not–”
Summer of Stony prompt #17: “I’m sorry I punched you in the face.”
“Yep,” Clint pops the ‘p’, and gets up from his stool. “Gotta go round up the gang, meet us in the living room in five. We’re all getting a blast from the past– Tiny Tony is gonna be gold.”
“If I don’t mind,” he scoffs, and grabs Steve’s coat to kiss his cheek before Steve can do anything else. “There’s more where that came from if you’re good.”
From the corner of his eye, Steve sees him crack his knuckles. “Yeah,” he says.
“Well, she
“Um…”
“Rogers--”
“Steve...”
“Get lost,” Tony waves him off, but Clint doesn’t miss the way he brings his hands to his chest after that, tapping a steady beat against the small reactor.
“What, a fella can’t look at his sweetheart whenever he wants, or does he need permission now?” Steve continues, blue eyes bright with humor and so much genuine admiration, Tony’s cheeks begin to burn in an all too familiar blush.
“And.. the rooms are kinda small. The tub can barely fit the both of us, and the kitchen counter’s about as long as my leg–”
Tony knows he could end it all, if he really wanted to. But underneath all of Clint’s jokes, there’s genuine curiosity and interest that Tony knows is born from all those years of knowing each other and living with each other, and fighting against the world with nothing but sheer will and trust in each other’s abilities. It’s more than a little touching, Tony can admit somewhere in his head, and, well… If it’s on tape, it can’t be that bad, can it?
“And kick some ass, baby.”
’. “What are you do–”
Steve feels the hammock rock as he laughs. “Fine, fine. Truce?”
Steve wakes to whisper soft words spoken against his skin, feels Tony’s lips brush the edge of his shoulder, hands skimming his spine tenderly. He buries his face further into his pillow, once, twice, before turning to face the brunet.
"Hey," Steve protests, hands raised up in protest. "it wasn't
“They’re
"Good morning,” Pepper calls out, but Tony doesn’t even turn to her as he heads straight for Steve, who puts his coffee down just as Tony steps into his space, resting his forehead on the Captain’s chest.
“I love you.”
“Until then...” Tony whispers. “Merry Christmas.”
“Language!”
“Honey,” Tony scoffs, and tells himself not to feel so giddy at the way Steve’s cheeks flush at the name. “If you think I don’t have a dozen other ways to get there–”
“Tony.”
Steve’s lips quirk up into a tiny smirk, and with the aviators covering his eyes, as well as the familiar leather jacket framing his broad shoulders as he revs the motor of the veritable monster between his legs, he looks like something out of Tony’s wet dreams. “Scared, Stark?”
“Lucky for you, I’ve got the next best thing,” Tony digs inside his coat and pulls out his phone. “Go nuts.”
, why does it sting?
“There, there,” he coos, ruffling the blond’s hair. “You’re so easy, but okay, I’m done. Now go find me a damn shirt.”
! Take it away, Dummy!” he yells, laughing when his robot beeps and whirrs and rolls this way and that.
“Sorry,” Steve chuckles, all sleep gone from his mind as he wraps his arms around that warm, familiar waist. “So, you were sayin’?”
Warnings: NONE.
“Maybe I’d believe that shit, if you did too.”
“And thank you for the dinner, too.”
“Just ask me now!” Steve yells from across the room, and Tony almost trips over his own feet as he stumbles to a halt.
“I’m sorry, what were you saying?”
“I thought you’d all like ‘em,” Steve rubs the back of his neck bashfully, only to huff out s chuckle when Natasha leans over to ruffle his hair.
Rhodey leans back into his seat with a grin, all thoughts of schoolwork clearly forgotten now. "That you have feelings for Steve?"
Tony tries to keep his calm. “Can you at least try, honey pie?”
"And his hands," Steve slips his under Tony's shirt, caressing the warm muscles on his back.
“Tony. Stark.”
She’s absolutely
"What are the odds that you'll forget this even happened?"
“You give me plenty of workout, baby,” he purrs, and then– “Hey, no, hon, TV doesn’t go there.”
* - * - * - *
Steve opens his eyes at the sound of Tony’s voice, lifting his head from his pillow just enough to send the brunet a smile. “Hi.”
“I could let JARVIS know?…” Tony says, and Natasha’s almost certain she’s the only one that takes his wide-eyed look for the pleading it is, the others distracted and unfocused around her.
“Really? ‘Cause it sure sounded like you were busy chatting up a storm with Daisy.”
Steve keeps working out until his shoulders and arms and legs grow deliciously nicer and thicker than ever, until he goes from being the baby of the bunch, to being the tallest of them all.
“I take back the square watermelon promise.”
“I don’t snore, you ass,” he mutters, poking the blond’s side not-so-gently even as his own lips quirk up. “I’m regretting all of this already.”
“‘Kay?”
“More than you think, I’m sure.”
“Not like I do it on purpose,” Steve mutters through his smile.
"Just one?"
“Yeah?” Steve whispers, eyes wide and happy and the most perfect shade of blue that will ever exist, and Tony knows he’s going to remember this moment for as long as he lives.
"Hi," he breathes.
“Impossible.”
“Thanks,” the brunet grins.
Tony can only shake his head, because Steve has a ring, a ring for Tony, a ring that Tony’s never known he wanted so much. He doesn’t care what it’s made of, for Christ’s sake!
“‘M tired,” she mumbles, and sighs when Steve cups her cheek, nuzzling into his palm.
“Sorry.”
“If you shoot this tree down,” Tony tells him around half a mouthful of popcorn, “I’m kickin’ you out.”
“I’m not.”
“I don’t believe you.”
Steve rolls his eyes even as he grins. “I get a little impatient sometimes.”
Steve can’t help the fond laughter that leaves his lips. “Tony, come on. You’ve got class in four hours.”
“What about me?”
- - - - -
Then again.
“What?” Steve says absently, eyes never leaving the storefront window.
“That was pitiful.”
“I love you, Tony.”
Tony looks doubtful. “Looking less and less likely the longer I sit here, Spangles.”
“Under the speed limit the whole time, actually,” Steve replies.
“Yes, sir?”
Steve furrows his brow thoughtfully, and the sight is so familiar, that Tony can’t help but press his lips to the side of his little blond head. “Tony?”
“So nice catching up, Brock,” is what he says instead, “we should do it again soon.” He throws them a peace sign as he walks away, and if his legs and fingers are shaking, he can only hope he’s far enough for them to miss it.
“Dunno.”
“Uncle Clint’s just jealous, huh?” he teases, only to catch the mischievous gleam that enters Barton’s eyes.
God, they haven’t even kissed and he’s already fucked.
"I love you too, sweetheart."
"Where are they, Rogers–”
“Well, thanks for that,” Blondie says. “I hope you have a nice day.”
Tony would laugh at the dazed, distracted tone of Steve’s voice, but when he looks down at the tiny bundle nestled in the carrier between them, he knows he sounds exactly the same. “The wall can’t be that interesting.”
“Want to spend the rest of the night answering questions about what kind of toothpaste Captain America uses--”
“It’s just-- it’s my thing,” Tony says. “I’ve never... he knows it’s just something I do.”
“Let’s get out of here.”
“Shit,” Tony sniffles, buries his face into Steve’s neck and takes a shaky breath. Then another. “Shit, shit, shit.”
“…That was unnecessarily expensive, wasn’t it?”
“He snuck into the basements and found some old home videos, so…”
by the time they leave.
Steve longs to know what it tastes like, but he will his body to stay still. "Is that..."
,” Clint cackles, and jumps up from his seat. “Nat, babe, get me out of here, I’m dying. Bruce, buddy, come with.”
“Steeb!” Barnes whines, and Tony can’t see him, but he can hear him tapping on Steve’s jacket incessantly. “
He sees Natasha and Bruce next, and Clint a couple of feet away, then he steps further into the room and finally… there’s Steve, stopping mid pace, right in front of the floor to ceiling glass windows that give them the best view in the city.
“Tony–”
“You always like this, Mister Stark?” Steve asks, still grinning.
From the corner of his eye, Tony sees Steve’s eyes widen. “Carter–”
“Hey, wh--”
“Hmm?”
“Bossy, bossy, bossy,” Tony tuts, and hopes to God no one can see the blush he can feel growing across his face when they turn to face each other on the dance floor.
“What mood? I’m in a hospital--”
Steve just closes his eyes, tears leaking from the corners to land on the light blue bedcover. His breathing is ragged and hard, like he’s still the shrimpy little boy that shared his cookies with Tony on the first day of second grade. “What am I gonna do, Tony?” he sobs. “
“Wh-- Tony, getting knocked unconscious is
“That’s a first,” Tony chuckles, reaching for his mug, but as he leaves, he tells himself to check up on the guy later.
“You happy?”
"I had a dream about you.”
Steve nods. “Yeah?”
Favorite food?
, he hears Steve scoff, so clear he can almost swear it’s real.
They’re gathered on the couch in the middle of the afternoon– and it’s rare that they all get time off like this, so they take advantage of it, settling in to watch a movie– except Tony, because he has an interview and photoshoot with TIME, and Pepper, who’s going as his buffer even though
“And… moment over.”
They’re both gasping when they pull away, and Tony lets out a pathetically happy little sigh when Steve rubs his nose against Tony’s in an eskimo kiss.
“Only because you’re not in here with me,” Steve says softly, grinning when Tony rolls his eyes.
“Tony...” he says, whisper soft, and it seems to jostle Tony out of his head, because he reaches out and takes it gently from Thor’s tiny hands. His movements are more than a little as he opens it, only to let out a quiet curse a moment later. “
“‘Kay,” she replies, and waves the kitten while making airplane noises the whole way there. “Daddy?”
A soft pat on his knee makes him look down, however, and he finds Natasha’s bright, green eyes looking up at him.
“It won’t-- it won’t be... easy,” Tony tells him. He can barely believe what he’s just heard, but he’s always been too selfish with the things that he loves.
Steve just rolls his eyes, pokes Tony’s side, and relaxes further into the hammock. “Don’t make me laugh, Shellhead, else we’re gonna fall off this thing.”
Stony Christmas prompt #31: "Why is all my furniture on the roof?"
“I’m sorry,” Steve sighs, dabbing at his nose a second later. His hair is slightly sweaty and tousled from sleep, but he’s still the most beautiful man Tony’s ever seen.
“Shit,” Tony blurts, breath catching in his throat as he’s suddenly only feet away from his mother, from the first time in years. “Shit, fuck,
“Tony--”
"Mhmm?”
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
“Uh-huh.”
“–but you need the big clincher, Rogers. Tit for tat, y’know. They vote for you, you get rid of those fucking disgusting burritos they serve for Taco Tuesdays.”
“Does Pepper know?” he turns back to his best friend, who’s looking down at the magazine with a grin. “Tony--”
Tony blinks, his cheeks flushing the most charming shade of pink Steve’s seen, and buries his head in Steve’s shoulder. “You fight dirty, Captain.”
“Well, they probably have better things to do, huh?” Tony grins at the blond’s blush. Up close, he can see every sun-kissed Irish freckle dotting Steve’s cheeks and nose, every shade of blue in those eyes he’s been in love with for years.
“I panicked and tossed her in the dumpster behind the gym.”
“It means a lot, that you were here.”
“Nope, shut up. I just– I’m happy just… being with you,” Tony says shyly, cheeks a rare, pretty shade of pink. “Don’t get me wrong– you and me? We’d make kickass prom kings. But I also don’t… I don’t give a fuck anymore, babe.”
“I’m sorry,” Steve says softly, and almost steals the breath from Tony’s lungs when he reaches out to touch his arm. Even through the lab coat and the button up he’s wearing, Tony can still feel the warmth of his skin like a soothing brand.
“Probably could’ve dropped the ball a little better than that, huh? Sorry.”
“I made burgers.”
“‘M not tiny,” he mumbles, head finding it’s familiar perch on Steve’s shoulder. He closes his eyes just as he registers warm, familiar arms around his waist, and feels better than he has all day.
“I am,” Tony says. “Might be more from the company, though.”
“He’s got a mouth on him,” Red says.
“Uh huh, sure you can’t,” he replies, and to his surprise, feels his eyes already growing heavy. “You’re doing this on purpose.”
“VIbranium, yeah,” is the last Steve says before he cups the back of Tony’s neck and brings their lips together in a slow, tender kiss. It’s a little salty from his tears, and there’s still a faint trace of chocolate from the cake they’d eaten hours before, but it makes Tony’s toes curl in his socks nonetheless.
“Nat’s gonna kill me,” Clint whispers, pale like Tony’s never seen him. “Shit, shit,
"It’s not like it’s a lie,” Tony shrugs, “I'll drink to it and everything. But Steve... He's never tried to change me. God knows he deserves someone who's not fucked up--"
“I like the sound of that,” Steve groans, hips rocking up to meet the brunet’s slightly thrusting ones. “Seems like–
“I’m reading–”
“To meet Jarvis,” Tony smiles at him over his shoulder, but almost stumbles when Steve pulls back.
He’s left with the brunt of crowd control on their way back, but it’s worth it for getting to see Steve hulking around the hundred pound fir over his shoulder like a sack of potatoes.
“Tony…”
Warnings: NONE.
Tony licks his lips. “You walked right into it, Cap.”
“Lookin’ forward to it,” Steve smiles back, then pretty much
“Thanks,” Steve mutters, but there’s a smile on his face when they make it halfway to the other side without another incident. “I think I’m gettin’ the hang of this.”
“Get some rest,” he whispers into Tony’s hair. “
Dark eyes furrow in confusion. "Wh-what're you... hi."
Stony Christmas prompt #27: "So... can we go eat now?"
“Hey.”
,” Steve says, grinning like he’s having the time in his life, and Tony doesn’t think he’s ever seen anything more beautiful.
“Just like Dummy, bud.”
“Yeah, I’ll try.”
"Tony—" she tries again, but he shakes his head.
fault.”
“You’re such a goner, Rogers,” is all she says, but as Steve starts setting up the camera for the next group, all he can think about is the feel of Tony’s lips on his cheek.
But Steve does.
"Still can't believe you insisted on doing this yourself, Cap,” he says, lips quirked up into that smile he can never help but make when Steve’s involved. “I can't believe you managed to drag me into this, too-- Tony Stark doesn’t pack, honey bunch.”
“You’re right, what was I thinking?” He murmurs. “You and me and Pep and Brucie-bear and Point Break can knock it out outta the park, hmm?”
“Steve--”
It feels good to be back! :')
“Night,” Tony finishes. “Arabic, yeah, I know.”
“Funny guy,” Steve rolls his eyes, but moves a hand up to tip Tony’s chin until their eyes meet. He has time to catch the brunet’s smile before cupping the back of his head to bring him in for a kiss. It’s slow and soft and lazy, Steve’s favorite kind, and neither of them pull away until they’re gasping for air.
he was knocked out of the trance.
"Yeah, I toned it down, won’t wanna traumatise your audience would ya ?" It was meant to come out as a joke but the look in her eyes made a shiver run down steve’s spine as he awkwardly replied "yeah" and let the silence slip in again.
Clint huffed and crossed his arms over his chest "not my fault that he can’t make time for us"
him to no end— No. just getting laid. But he is a scientist…it’s his professional responsibility to unravel mysteries…
"How apart are the contractions ?" Tony's ex and Steve's doctor, Stephen strange asked.
Tony coughed "
"Not really, you moved" Tony swears he would’ve kissed the smirk off the blond—
Steve shut up at that and looked away from Tony, towards the stage
Steve pulled back from the hug, still grinning but with a glint of mischief in his eyes "I couldn’t have done it without you and that’s the truth and that’s what I am gonna say in my speech" he pointed at his study table where the speech lied, marked and changed a few thousand times "better start believing it" he put his hands in his pocket, his grin turning into a smile, mischief of his eyes turning into adoration in no time "you did your best"
Tony’s shoulders slumped as he crouched beside his husband, he cupped his tear streaked cheeks and caressed them, Steve closed his eyes and leaned into the touch "tell me what’s wrong…we’ll work it out…please" It was plea barely above whisper
"Nope" He popped the ‘p’ "sit somewhere else"
"Do something !" He bellowed at his husband
Tony pulled back "Steve…I love you" he whispered as if he was telling a secret, A secret only meant for Steve’s ears. he cupped steve’s cheek and wiped the tears "please don’t cry"
“Chill-ax I don’t do spies, too old fashioned, Romanov told me”
"Honey bear gonna be there ?"
Tony wore a white tee which was thin enough to make the arc-reactor's light visible, a red and golden jacket themed on his superhero persona, ironman, a gift from Stevie and lastly a pair of jeans.
A silent ‘oh’ formed on his face as the situation dawned on him.
"But we didn't mind skipping dinner" Nat smirked
Stevie sat on her bike and patted the place behind her, where Tony shakily sat and fastened his hands on Stevie waist, the position was intimate and both of them were flustered like idiots. they had shared a bed while sleeping but every touch still makes them blush, an eleven year long crush does that to you.
"Hey Pepper ?"
"Bucky I am running late"
Steve straightened his tie for the millionth time as he looked in the mirror with a grin. He had to look perfect for tonight, he has been working for this for 8 years now, he won’t let anything. absolutely anything, ruin it.
"Tony" she raised her eyebrow
"Yeah" Tony sighed "I am sober now" he flashed a smile to assure her.
Bucky gasped and clutched his heart mockingly "so much hate ? What did I ever do to you !?" Silence followed as Steve kept looking in the mirror but didn’t spoke a word, it wasn’t hard to see that something was wrong.
"You are on my seat"
"Thank you, Buck" he hugged back and patted his brother’s shoulder as a show of camaraderie "couldn’t have done this witho—"
"A tower, a beautiful, magnificent, self-sustainable tower"
The team —or at least whatever they can be called without Ironman and Thor in there— groaned and suited up to fight the villain-of-the-week.
you diluted it a lot in the movie. So, don’t tell me it wasn’t
"Right, so, I was calling Steve to come down to the lab—"
"Language" Steve scolded lightheartedly but didn’t let the smile off his face
"Me too" Tony’s doe eyes met his "may I ?" Tony made a gesture towards Steve's half filled glass
"1 hour 30 mins" Tony said looking at his watch
"Very" The blue-eyed stranger gave a smug grin
"You are" he said looking in her blue eyes
"Why are you sitting here, you aren’t a winner" The blonde quizzed
"Tony ?" no attention
"Thanks Sharon" Steve grinned, proud of himself
"Oh" Tony formed "you don’t need to work for me if it makes you uncomfortable"
"Shoo let me read"
"Nothing ? Thought Tony stark was a genius" Steve’s smirk widened
—-x—-
"Tony you can’t have 38 out of 46 floors as labs, your company needs marketing, sample production, PR dedicated floors too” he sighed “you are killing this project, if you want a hq then it needs to have everything not just R&D”
"Please"
"Where's the helmet ?"
"What ?" Steve’s mouth silently formed "this is about my poem, right ? The one
Tony smirked “even if I have blue schnapps ?”
"And that’s why I love you"
Thick skull.
He pushed the thought behind and kissed back as he felt Tony’s lips on his own.
He checked Steve's dilation "8 cm" he announced "hold on a little more" he encouraged the soldier
"Ooh I like it, are you jealous ? Don’t worry honey, I am exclusively yours"
Natasha headlocked another one of the worm thing-y to death "where the hell is Tony" she panted. Damn this villain was better than the others, Nat would definitely enjoy roasting them to death
"You know whatever that was, wasn’t about the accords"
He kept his head down and continued walking making sure that he didn't bump into someone and remained unnoticed, two things that he should've done the moment he entered this school.

the same man who tried to ask him out a few months ago
The ceremony started with Peggy giving a speech about importance of the event and its history and involvement with Maria Stark…
—-x—-
He curled his fingers around The hem of his shirt and took a deep breath, he lifted the shirt making the dry blood stuck to his shirt, tear his skin. Tony’s other hand immediately clamped his mouth to suppress the shout which got muffled as his eyes glistened with tears, he immediately dropped his shirt and took off with his drink, the bottle, not the glass, and walked down to his lab.
"Can’t"
"It wasn’t worth it" Steve found himself agreeing "It wasn’t worth losing you"
“Oh yeah” Tony leaned near him, his breath mingling with Steve's making Steve's breath hitch “then do I get to keep 38 floors R&D”
Steve huffed an amused laugh “No Tony”
“Hey harls ! I was planning some shakes and burgers after school, will you be free ? And then we can go to this park and maguna and Petey pie will be there so we can also go to that carnival you wanted to go to — harls ?"
"I do…I wanted to hear you say it” she pauses “Tony he'll have to accept you for yourself and I don't care how he sees you, no one does except him, in m—our eyes you are perfect the way you are cause you are Tony Stark, no one can be you ! it's hard to be you and you are already accomplishing it and if you are worried about not being athletic and stuff, no one can be that perfect"
The day their four year old daughter asked his husband about the guy in the picture with her dad, Tony told her that it was her brother, a brother who was far away and Daddy can’t bring him back.
"What ?" He let out a indignant squeak
"I cann— "
"I will make you call him !"
"Figured"
"Steve ?"
Let's just no one messed with Harley after that day.
"YOU DON'T KISS YOUR BEST FRIEND !!!"
"Yeah ?" Steve asked confused, how was this relevant ? Wasn’t this supposed to be a lecture about the designs he recently delivered to Ms. Ferrari’s law firm for their new building ?
"Go on"
"He is 10 cm dilated" Dr.Palmer announced "operation theatre now !"
The audience and V.I.P seats started filling in, the winners will sit beside Tony once they have gotten their awards.
"What the heck Steve ! I got a heart condition here !" Tony said dramatically clutching his reactor
Tony nodded slowly "It wasn’t worth it"
painter”
"I am never riding that thing again"
“How do you know I like them !?” Steve looked at him angrily “if you’ve had spies on me or something—“
“lunch as gonna-be-friends then ?" He proposed, Gotta love a challenge.
he paused, completely, no tear left his eyes nor did his body shake "blue eyes ? C'mon tell me I won't be angry, alright ?"
"No." Tony knew
"Yeah, you are missing the point. Don’t interrupt the genius Pepper" Yeah, he heard that eye roll too
The Praemium Imperiale
Tony rolled his eyes "Ugh drinking with a few friends" he flipped them off
"—and call me when it’s done, ok ?"
I confess : Steve is hard to write.
"Think of it as a date" Tony proposed before he could re-think that idea.
They never discussed what it meant
"Yes, tell him not to text me about this anymore because I already did a favour for him"
"Everyone else’s busy"
Steve's lips into a line
He’s pretty Sure there are even tabloids about the last one, should he send links to Steve ? No one rejects Tony Stark.
Tony rolled his eyes
"You directed ‘Red Room’ ! It was amazing, Is that what you are getting the recognition for ?" He asked tilting head slightly towards ‘Romanoff’
Clint gives a triumphant grin and turns on a chick lit that Steve couldn’t care less about, he has bigger things at hand, like how Tony slowly and stealthy empties his bucket of Popcorn into Clint’s already empty one as an apology, for not being around.
Suddenly they feel hyper aware of their proximity, breath, heartbeat, wind, leaves of the tree and their lips on each other.
After going at each other like a couple of rabbits, Tony decided to cheer the blonde up so, he brought him on a date in some world famous restaurant .
"Cut the crap Tony"
"Still hilarious"
" he pressed
Tony pushed a glass towards him as they stood beside each other, Steve took the glass but didn’t drink, he looked at Tony, he was aware what this conversation was about and he wanted Tony to start it.
Amount: About $135,400
"Mr. Stark"
"I met him 5 minutes ago Nat" he rolls his eyes
"You have millions to your name, take day off"
Steve made a face at him "stop imagining that"
he puts the parchment down
"Wait ! WHAT ? There is no CRUSH !" No use, she already hung up.
"N-now ?" He asked stunned
"I got important work to do so tell me you assigned a top notch architect on my building and then excuse me because I swear this place gets smellier every time I arrive" Tony said coolly as he sat down in front of Fury
Steve was unconscious on the bed yet beautiful, the light was falling on his face perfectly as his eyes scrunched up from brightness, he blinked twice and tried sitting up, Tony held him down.
"What ?" Steve looked at him astonished, no one except Natasha…or maybe clint knows that and it’s not like he leaves it lying around the house, just his room and tony won’t know unless..…
Tony sighed and massaged his temples in frustration "hypothetically speaking—"
"Wh-Where's She ?" He hiccuped
"I am Margret Carter and I will be conducting the practice of your ceremony" she gave him a professional smile and asked him to sit with other winners until they begin.
"Tony" Steve punctuated "I don’t think it’s a good idea, I don’t mind being friends though" oh
Tony sighed and turned towards Fury "change him,I want an replacement"
Bucky patted his arm and left Steve alone to give him space
Tony let out a breath of relief. and panicked.
"Steve ? What are you talking about ?" Tony tried to join the dots, seriously he did
He scoffs "As well as ask him to have sex with me"
Steve hoped with his whole heart that Tony was joking as he followed the brunette out of the lab
A nudge on his shoulder distracted him "what ?" He mumbled distracted
"You just wanna hang out now so that you don't have to stick around your old man" she spat while reading her copy of 'Call me by your name'
"Bold of you to assume that I'll let you"
"Why not ?"
"Who are you ?" Tony looked at her annoyed
“I don’t get drunk easily” Steve said marvelling at the beauty of Tony’s bar
"Good to see you to gorgeous" he winked at her only for Peggy to roll her eyes. She did look gorgeous in her sleeveless blue sequins gown, Her hairs tied in a bun accented with a blue flower
"She didn’t wanted me to but how can I miss the award show that you organise ?” Tony huffed
was absorbed in the classical Indian dance presenting in-front of them
Peggy swatted his arm pretending to be offended, making them both chuckle and ending their light hearted conversation.
"I was scared" Tony mumbled apologetically, leaning his forehead on steve’s, his one hand on steve’s cheek and other rubbing the nape of his lover’s neck.
Steve bites the corner of his lip, and looks down at the plush puppy in his hands. “It’s been perfect. I’m havin’ a great time.”
“It was the afternoon--”
Civil Union Fest Prompt #22: “Have I entered an alternate universe or did you really just crack a smile?”
People aren’t things, Tony, so no.
end up making it worth your while.”
He doesn’t even complete a whole round before he’s bored out of his mind, paintings and sculptures he’s seen only minutes ago already fading from his memory. The champagne glass hangs upside down from his swinging hand, and he can’t even muster a fake hum of interest at anything anymore.
It rang in his head like a bell as he stared and tried to make his brain start working again. Maybe it had been the joint efforts of both Jane and Jan earlier, but… he could see it. He could see the way Tony was looking at him and as much as it confused him, he knew that wasn’t how you looked at someone you were friends with. You just didn’t.
Tony scowled, but nodded a little, a hand coming up to rub self-consciously over the glass. God, he hated that thing sometimes. But it was a small price to pay- considering everything he’d done to earn it.
Tony laughed, gentle and tired. “Then how will you kiss me?”
“I think we should stop looking for Bucky.”
“Well,” Steve said as he turned his head and looked up at the ceiling, “that was a fucking mess.”
“I fucking
He was letting himself be happy
“And I will keep coming back and trying until one day I succeed,” Steve gritted out, shaking his head as he watched her. “This isn’t about me wanting to kill myself. If that were the case I’d have just picked a bridge. This about me wanting Tony to live.”
They stayed there, up on the roof for another hour, until the sun was well below the horizon and the skies had turned dark. Neither of them wanted to move, but eventually Tony persuaded him that it was probably for the best, if only to keep his friends from worrying. So they’d made their way back to Tony’s bike practically melded to one another- neither wanting to let go, even for a second.
Steve, bless him, didn’t even pause for a moment, muttering “If we keep it up, we get to kiss eachother into the next year,” into Tony’s jaw.
“…Nothing-”
A pause.
Steve looked down at his phone blankly, feeling the words sink in like a punch to the stomach. He’d been sat on his bed staring at his phone for almost an hour waiting for Tony to reply, worried sick about whether he’d got home okay- and although he felt the palpable sense of relief upon seeing Tony’s texts, he also wished viscerally that he’d not looked. Seeing that in words just hurt.
“Love you,” Steve said with a smile, kissing his nose, “love youuuuuuuuuuuuuu.”
Which was why he woke up at 10-past-midnight, gasping for breath and clutching so tightly at the sheets he thought he would rip them.
, wiped off the map—”
No. They wouldn’t have moved so fast, surely. That would make it too obvious. And of course, he couldn’t even be sure there was any truth to Tony’s words in the first place. Steve had to remain as objective as he could here. The fate of the whole goddamn world might depend on it.
_____
Bucky means well, he really does. He's just... going about it badly.
Steve would take anything over this. Anything.
There was a short pause, and then he heard Tony ask “Barnes?”
He glanced up, eyebrow raised at Tony. Treacherously, Tony heard the heart monitor he was still connected to begin to speed up a little. Dammit. That was the downside to doing all this while still technically being bedridden.
He could go a few more hours without sleep. It was fine. “I’m in,” he said with a grin around the room as everyone else agreed and then argued over showing times. They eventually settled on going to the soonest one, and by the time they’d all squished themselves into the AvengerVan (Clint’s terminology,
a place to call home until you and The Avengers… why would we ever want to go anywhere else?”
“Please,” he asked softly, in his stupid terrible tired little voice, and
Tony hummed, fingers poking absently at a couple of petri dishes before Bruce smacked his hand away and then got back to whatever he was typing up on his computer. Tony quickly settled down into some work of his own- Clint’s sticky arrows were decidedly Not Sticky enough, and Tony had been trying to work out which formulae would work best for
, alright, yeah, that was good. That was really good. Tony knew he should probably loosen his grip on Steve’s shoulders, but hey, the guy seemed to be enjoying it just as much if the noises he was making were anything to go by.
honest with himself—he wasn’t even sure whether he’d ever quite stopped loving Tony in the first place. He’d crushed it down, pushed it away, but looking at him now, everything just came right back. Every feeling, every butterfly. He couldn’t stop it. No matter how much he looked at Tony and hated who had become, he still… he still-)
“Brought you a friend,” he began the conversation with, nodding over to the computer he’d set on the table. Tony glanced at it, and his face broke out into a smile.
She didn’t say a name, but he got the feeling he knew what she was talking about and felt his heart jump a few paces faster automatically. “I… what do you mean?”
The man was pink-cheeked, tamping down a bashful smile as he looked at Tony. He was leaning forward, closer than usual. And his arm was raised, bent awkwardly above them.
It was soft and silent and perfect, and Steve let his spare hand trail aimlessly over the soft curls of Tony’s hair as they lay there on the thick grass in the dead of night. Honestly, they probably needed to talk about a few things that had changed tonight.
The next time he woke up, he felt a little more like himself. Mainly because his head was fucking throbbing, and he could think in a clear train of coherent thoughts, which was nice.
might not even survive it, given the sudden steep drops, ravines, ice patches and a pitch-black night to contend with. But they couldn’t wait until morning, and they couldn’t go slowly. This was urgent.
What Tony was not used to, however, was sleeping peacefully and then being woken up by a high-pitched, perpetual screaming noise to his immediate right. That was something he could firmly say he'd never had to deal with in his life before.
"What do we do?" Steve hissed, his frown deep. He was still looking at Peter as if he was seconds away from exploding. "Do we even know how old he is? How much food he needs? God, I knew this was a bad idea- what if he wants... like, breast milk or something? Do we have any of that?"
It took 2146 beats to finally send him to sleep, but he drifted off with the assurance of it resting under one set of fingers, and the AA coin resting in the other. Both of them promises that he had to keep.
Steve shook his head, and then hissed when it sent a jolt of pain blaring behind his temples. “Don’t apologise,” he muttered, palms putting pressure on his closed eyes, “apologising is my job.”
God, Steve loved him.
Goddamn it.
Against his better judgement, he found himself typing a message back. He kept it short—again, there were now other, more pressing things on his mind. A simple
Tony and Steve looked over at each other. The tension seemed to turn up a few notches higher. By this point, they were both very familiar with AIM’s work.
That threw Steve for a loop. He checked the clock, and then raised his eyebrows in surprise. Wow. He’d been doodling for a longer time than he’d thought.
He shrugged, huffing in bewildered amusement. ‘If you want,’ he replied nonchalantly.
been there, and Tony had been so blinded with rage and trauma that he was beating into Bucky in a way that might not have been fixable if he caught the wrong place, and Steve couldn’t let Bucky die and he knew that Tony wouldn’t want to kill him, not really—so Steve fought him.
Because then they’d just make each other worse, and it’d be bad for Steve, obviously.
Steve shut the door with his foot, reminding himself to get Tony’s key and lock the car seeing as JARVIS couldn’t do it any more. “Tony will get you somewhere better soon,” Steve assured him.
“Alright, robo-cop, that’s enough of that talk,” Tony groused, cocking his gun and pulling a face. “Hey, babe!” He called over his shoulder.
Tony rolled his eyes and opened his mouth, undoubtedly to brush it off, but Steve didn’t let him. “You pulled me out of my office and you put me on a plane and told me to trust you. Then you took me to see Niagara Falls.” He smiled at the memory and watched Tony do the same in front of him, both of them remembering the cool spray from the truly beautiful view and the way they’d held one another as they stared at the sight for what seemed like eternity. It was a day that Steve knew he’d never forget, and had made him happier than he’d ever been able to expect, especially considering the week he’d had.
It didn’t seem to faze the kid much; his fist balled up, but that was about all the reaction they got out of him. Steve shook his head fondly and leaned over, kissing Tony on the tip of the nose before turning away back into the direction of the bathroom. Tony was pretty sure he heard Steve repeat the little pet-name Tony had just said through a small breath of laughter, but he wasn’t sure, and a second later Steve’s ankle knocked the door half-shut, shielding him from view.
“Let’s just say Sir watched terminator a few nights ago and I got some useful ideas.”
In the end, he decided to just go with the latter. He’d done stupider things before, and it
“Yeah.”
They wound up the session after that, everyone having said their fill. The evening was dark and damp as Steve made his way back to the car, the parking lot still filled with abandoned cars, years old. There was always going to be a different area to clean up. The echoes of human life that remained, even after death.
He was cut off when both Steve and Bucky launched projectiles in his direction- a pillow from Bucky and a bottle of antiseptic from Steve. When he turned back around, Tony’s smile seemed as if it was sticking to his face a little bit. He glanced over to Bucky for a moment before turning head down again. Sensing he wasn’t exactly in the mood for jokes, Steve shot Sam a warning glare. Sam seemed to realize, though, and quickly held up his hands. “Okay, okay- just go gently on me, Tony, alright? It’s my first time with Advanced Trigonometry.” He batted his eyelashes, and Tony chuckled quietly.
Tony made a tutting noise down the line. “Trying to reject my invitation, Rogers?”
Loki sat there blankly for a moment, before a smile broke out on his face. He laughed, shrugging in defeat. “Touché,” he admitted, “but what else is a fucked up 17-year-old with a broken family and a boatload of undiagnosed mental health problems supposed to do?”
He imagined what it would be like for Tony, to be able to go out on the streets, hand in hand with Steve, kiss him around whoever he wanted to and never have to worry that something terrible would happen because of it. “What’s your plan?” Steve asked quietly, sitting up and leaning his elbows onto his knees, staring intently up at Tony. Because Tony was a genius, and Tony would have a plan. Of course he would have a plan.
,” Tony said his name in exasperation, eyes pulling themselves open and head tilting upward to look at him, “it was not your fault. Please. It happened, it wasn’t the most fun I’ve ever had in my life, but it’s over- wallowing in guilt isn’t going to reverse time and stop them trying to take me. What are you going to do about it now?”
. “Are you hurt, Tony, did he—
“Whoah whoah whoah whoah whoah-“ Bucky raised his hands, frown marking his face as he turned to Steve, “you were drinking last night?”
The whole room was fraught with the kind of tension that gave Bruce a feeling that sooner or later; someone would throw the first punch. His whole body thrummed, ready to snap, stirred the other guy up, so he stayed close to the window in case he needed to jump off.
"Soul-bonding isn’t what you think it is. It is not sacred, it not glorious, and it sure as hell isn’t eternal happiness." Tony managed through what felt like a mouthful of sawdust, of chalk, of razor blades. He hated to destroy Steve’s naïve fantasy but he had to.
Loki took the bait and wandered over to him with a smug look on his face. He pressed the blunt end of his staff to the back of Steve’s head, pinning him back down to the ground.
He'd gotten used to the morning visit, shield personnel always came to monitor him since his arrival two months ago and lately they had been trying to recruit him. This was the second time Fury came himself. Captain America; that was all he was to them, and they expected him to just bounce back and save the world just because they send him to session after session of therapy. Never mind he had just lost everything, lost an entire world!
Pepper smiled encouragingly. Tony had been distant since the battle of New York. She had waited for him to open up about it.
On closer observation, one perceived bits of gold scattered throughout the blue eyes. Like sunlight sparkled on the ocean wave, the gold in his soulmate’s watchful gaze. He felt like he could stare at those eyes forever. His hands, his arms, and his soul-everything wanted to reach out and crush his Omega against him. He wanted to kiss his soul-mate, wanted to touch him. He wanted to worship him. The moment stretched before he realized the Omega’s intelligence eyes were guarded, calculated. Steve couldn’t read anything in his expression.
“You gonna stop me?” Tony didn’t even think, just hissed like an angry cat. He didn’t need a stupid Alpha approval, not after Howard and not after Obie.
Omega is tricky not only as they being branded as the lowest caste they are also the minority (1/8 of the population). Most of them had less muscle mass and shorter than Alpha or Beta. And their heat also makes them less desirable as workers compare to Alpha and Beta. After the World War 2 Omega right and Omegas had worked hard for their place in society but they had yet to reach equal status.
How could the shy and visibly uncomfortable Doctor Banner seemed perfectly fine and at ease around Tony after the man acted like an asshole by commenting on the 'green beast' problem without caring about Banner's feelings and how much it could hurt him?! It was ridiculous and Steve couldn't understand it.
Iron Man continuously blasted broken debris off the turbine engine. It's bad, but still fixable.
His heartbeat faster-Captain America the man he never wanted to meet in a million years, stood tall, strong, and breath-taking… no, not breath-taking!
“The cell is just…” Fury tried to explain.
He could smell the faint scent of blood from Tony that he didn’t smell before he was… mind control? Steve forced himself to push his worry aside, there was a more important thing. The Alpha knew if he looked he would see blood on Tony’s knuckle.
In my mind: Natasha disguise her-self as a high level beta (near alpha enough to attract the Omega in Tony but Beta enough to made Tony less wary of her) in iron man 2 because Tony is less wary around beta and had more female beta lover than Omega or alpha-especially the male one.
A dangerous glint in Bruce’s eyes, he let out a humorless chuckled “I was in Calcutta. I was pretty well removed.”
Steve stepped back a few steps before vaulted a barrier into the place where the control panel was. He snapped the front of the control panel and looked at all the wires and switches in bewilderment. 'Was this happening?' He groaned to himself.
Note: Ch 10, ch 11 and this chapter 13 and ch 15 is co-write by Kathryn and me.
After birth, she didn’t produce any milk. At 10 months, after visiting the GP every week with a child covered in eczema, Tony was diagnosed with a dairy allergy and it was testing. Maria hated that the baby was problematic.
Bruce huffed a laugh, tapped away at the monitoring programs on his screen.
Tony and Natasha: high level Omega. One with strong will to controls any alphas. Natasha even harnesses her caste and uses it as a weapon
“Of course, you did.” Steve said, voice devoid of emotion despite the dark color in his eyes. “That was why you kissed me like that.” He netted, angry that Tony shook off the kiss like a canine shook off the rain while Steve had continued to shiver even now.
Everyone else treated Bruce with kid gloves, and it got to him. Bruce was uncomfortable around everyone. What he needed was someone who WASN'T AFRAID OF HIM, DIDN'T PITY HIM, AND RESPECTED BOTH HIS GENIUS AND HIS POWER WHICH HE KNEW BRUCE COULD CONTROL. BRUCE NEEDED a friend who understood his plight and that was what Tony was being!
Pepper and Clint: Mid-level alpha.
It was easy to get Maria’s pregnant. What they didn’t expect was what happen after. A full on nine months of Hyperemesis gravidarum hit her like a brick wall. Once, on the second month she spent 6 hours vomiting and having chest pains and subsequently breathing difficulties. The family’s doctor called an ambulance and she was rushed off to A&E, continuing to be sick in the ambulance on the way. She spent the night being pumped with fluids.

Like that would work, no-one could hate Tony Stark as much as he loathed himself.
More than half then richest, most successful men in the world are Alphas. Which why parents and bosses and society respected/prefers Alphas.
“Do it!” Cap replied instantly, tired from fighting for so many hours. Tony could hear the relief in his voice.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Make your move reindeer games." Tony intoned through the helmet.
“Well, damn.” Tony seared through a piece of metal that was blocking the blades with his laser.
But he was a protector with the capabilities to do much better than Rogers could and as much good as the rest of the team. He had been around as Iron Man for as long as Captain America was around in WW2. He was a show-off, but he also had handled a lot of things and had proven himself more than capable again and again BY THIS POINT.
The last part made his stomach churned…
There was nothing to do but pray, pray that his other half would come back. For what felt like the longest time, nothing happened. Desperately he prayed. “God Almighty please saves him. If you spare him I would ask you for nothing… not even him.
He worried about how Pepper felt being an Alpha to an Omega who couldn’t get over his fear enough to let her see him without a shirt on since he used to trust her enough to put her hand inside his chest before Obie’s betrayal.
I can't get enough and I can't get my fill!
Not wanting to hear Fury spewed bullshit, Tony projected his voice over the man’s rants. “I'm sorry, Nick.” Tony moved the monitor towards Fury which showed plans of the weapon, tore apart Fury’s lies. “What were you lying?” Tony asked with mock horror.
Gritted his teeth, Steve’s hand shot out grabbed the staff before ripped it away from his head. He then flipped and kicked Loki in his face with his knee and sent him flailed backward, "Not today!"
“JARVIS, what was going on?”
Howard seemed dead set about having a child. Even though Maria knew she would regret it, she felt like she should honor her soulmate wish. After all they were soulmates, his wish should be hers as well. She could leave the child to the help. It wouldn’t change a thing except it might bring the some of the old Howard back. If only she knew…
It was a difficult birth. Very, very difficult. Maria spent 48 hours on a bed, where she endured contractions, screaming. The nurses kept wiping her brow and feeding her ice and telling her to push, push, and push. Maria was scared, the pain kept coming and radiated everywhere. It’s omnipresent and Maria’s panicked over it being the death of her because nobody did anything, there was too much risk, too much risk of the baby’s life. “Oh, god. It feels like I’m being torn apart.”
‘So what, you’re hardly the only one, everyone knew what a monster I am. The Merchant of death who grew rich on the foundation of millions of innocent’s death, the biggest killer in America.’ Tony thought.
Tony felt Steve’s grip on him loosened. “Be safe.” Captain America steeled his jaw and headed back into the ship. He had an archer and a spy to find.
Tony was with Pepper, had been with Pepper for more than 2 years and would… continue being with Pepper. He needed to remember that. And he had been the one who broke Steve’s heart and fantasy he didn’t have the right to miss him.
He encouraged Maria’s modelling and went to the fashion show she was in despite his busy schedule. Howard made her feel like the most beautiful woman in the world. He would ask waiters if they’d ever seen anyone as gorgeous as Maria. He was everything she wanted in a lover despite being old enough to be her father and his womanizer past.
Tony's skin warmed and hummed with quickening the blood. His tongue caressed, explored, branded and excited, expressed stark passion and seared desire on his giddy senses, set Steve and his wits spun even faster.
"JARVIS has been running it since I hit the bridge." Tony interrupted, looked up at Steve. "In a few hours, I'll know every dirty secret S.H.I.E.L.D ever tried to hide." Tony smiled grimly, looked between Steve and Bruce.
Tony seemed to be mumbling to himself. "I gotta get this superconducting cooling system back online before I can access the rotors and work on dislodging the debris." he surmised, looking around to figure out the puzzle. He tugged on the stuck rotors, fruitlessly.
"The guy's not wrong about Loki. He does have the jump on us." He commented.
End Flashback
“You know, you may not be a threat, but you better stop pretending to be a hero.” Steve’s voice as hard as iron.
Steve pushed the heavy door to the port-side aside. He looked around at the destruction, seeing S.H.I.E.L.D operatives in full oxygen masks shot fire extinguishers and cowered from the shower of sparks, largely unable to do anything.
Which meant Steve was fine that Fury intended to blackmail him into submission and endanger everything he worked so hard to achieve. The hurt and anger of being betrayed rose in him. Anger had ridged his cheekbones with a slash of crimson like his flesh was on fire.
JARVIS pulled up the location ‘Stuttgart Germany, 28 Coolins, Straza’ and Tony repulsor blasted his way toward the scene.
And the brutal aroma of the Omega unfurled around Steve; so dark; so deep, it threatened to drown him; the rich, enthralling, allure that had to be illicitly addictive. Dangerous, demanding; the Dominant Omega Tony Stark.
If it wasn’t his so-called past self in the painting, Tony would fall in love with it. He remembered his dream, Steven’s soft gaze when he gazed at him. The bond pulsed in his brain, memories came unbidden. Steven’s proud face when captured Anthony’s likeness so well. He… Anthony was beside himself with excitement when he was told the painting was finish. Steven had captured more than his likeness. He had captured his… Anthony’s love for him too.
“Doc. Banner put down the scepter.” Steve’s voice calmed and even, trying not to anger the man.
Steve heard an “Uh-oh.” over the speaker and the sound of crunching metal. ‘Tony, no!’
The statistic that never got mentioned was that 2% of soul-bonded couples had broken up or divorced since the early 17th century. Every case highly publicized in the news because people believed soul-bonds were sacred and everlasting and wanted to know what went wrong.
A broken gaze from Steve, and truly, something in the gaze froze Tony to the core. It spoke of a pain so deep, so stark. He wondered if he had gone too far, being too cruel.
It was one long second before Natasha texted back “He looked tired but he seemed okay. He and Pepper break up seemed very amicable.”
Maria Stark foundation had helped many people years before Afghanistan. Scholarship, building facilities, helping poor people and sick patient helping farmers and increased food supplies in poor countries.
What made him jealous was how friendly Tony was with Bruce and Thor especially Bruce. They got on like house on fire. It drove Steve insane. He got hot ashes jealousy. He was never this jealous not even when he was with Howard. Tony even called he and Brucethe Science Bros. He treated them like they were his pack and not just a necessary evil that he tolerated. He even nicknamed Bruce Brucie-bear and Thor point break.
“Mr. Stark.” between labored breaths she said the words. “You’re the best man, I ever got and I don’t just mean the sex.” Her blue eyes glimmered with love and adoration.
“Yep, I noticed,” Tony said sarcastically. Jumping on the piece of metal to clear the blockage. Once he cleared the debris from the engine turbine, Tony boosted his thrusters and shot down into the rotors. With every ounce of his willpower, Iron Man pushed on the rotor until it scraped along the edges, using his feet boosters to propel him faster. After a few more rotations, Tony had the rotors going at a normal speed. The Helicarrier began to level out. Steadily, it went faster and faster and soon was reaching critical speed.
Because of course, the best way to make Bruce felt comfortable was to remind him that everyone on board except Tony thought of Bruce as nothing more than a monster, a ticking time bomb to be feared or given special consideration lest he wreaks havoc. And he thought Captain America supposed to be brilliant and fight for the underdog and all the craps Howard spouted out. Talk about fraud and propaganda.
“Because he is my soulmate.” he murmured, he couldn’t even drag his attention from his soulmate to his cousin.
Tony’s stomach flipped over like pancake at Steve nearness. He flipped it straight back again. It was bad enough he kept having wet-dream about having sex with Captain America while in bed with Pepper. This whole thing made him felt dirty like he had been cheating on Pepper every single night. He had to get this to stop. He and Pepper had something special together, and he would not let a stupid bond stood in the way!

“Phase 2 is S.H.I.E.L.D used the cube to make weapons.” Steve said, his jaw and hand clenched, his posture stiff from barely controlled his anger. He gave Fury a hard stare.
Tony became involved in veteran’s affairs after Afghanistan. He made advancement in prosthetic limbs for the wounded and invented new armor for soldiers. This reminded Steve of Howard so much that it hurt.
She mostly forgot Tony even exist... only paying him attention when he was paraded out for social events. Otherwise, it was up to the nanny and Jarvis to look after him. And that was before Howard lost interest in his wife and started cheating left and right. After that, his mom started to spout poisonous words and treated him harshly.
If the file and video were true, which he hoped with his whole being it wasn’t, then Tony Stark was everything Steve loathed. He even endangered other people at his birthday party and kicked Lieutenant Col. Rhodes around the house for trying to stop him over two years ago. Col. Rhodes was said to be his best friend and had endangered his job to vouch for him in court and had looked for him even after three months during his kidnap in Afghanistan.
Tony let out a small frustrated sound. "He was out of his league. He should have waited. He should have...” he trailed off, voice hard with frustration that had no available outlet.
Anthony Edward Stark, 30 years old. ‘Only four years older than me… biologically’. He worked as a consultant to SHIELD for free and operated in a suit of armor called Iron Man. Despite the name, the suit was a high-tech prosthesis made of gold-titanium.
Through the bond, the force of emotion flowed between them like an impossible two-way river, sheered and untrammeled joy sang in their blood and bones.
At the age of 16, he could feel nothing but hatred in Howard’s eyes every time he fixed his father’s mistakes or improved his father’s work. That was when he was forced to face the fact that he would never win his father’s love. Hell, he would never amount to anything to Howard other than a cash cow and being his punching bag. And God did it hurt! To Howard, he was just something to be manipulated and gained from.
The tension flew out the window when the computer beeped the signal for locating the Tesseract and they turned to it, for a moment just staring blankly at it.
Tony didn’t say anything more but he kept looking at him like Steve was the punch-line to a joke only he could hear; there were anger and hatred in those beautiful, intense eyes.
“Stupid woman.’’ Howard spat leaving his soulmate looking shattered.
"Divided and conquered, yeah, it was great." the brunet’s hands moved as he said it trying to work through Loki’s crazy. "But he knew he had to take us out to win, right? That's what he wanted.” Tony said in silent contemplation. “He wanted to beat us, he wanted to be seen doing it.” Tony emphasized the words to himself as well as Steve. “He wanted an audience.” Tony continued, his eyes met Steve’s. He paced, their eyes never left each other even as his genius mind almost audibly raced.
Captain Asshole’s lip twisted into a slight ugly snarl as he glared down at him. Rogers used his superior height and bulk for intimidation this time; an outdated alpha move that would never work on Tony Stark. Iron Man had faced a bigger and far deadlier enemy than a subpar super-soldier. If Rogers was a villain he wouldn’t last 6 seconds fighting Iron Man. Tony hated himself for finding Roger’s eyes so hypnotic.
“Steven.” He heard James called, he sounded panic. “He is a notorious omega and isn’t a good fit for an honorable man such as you.” James informed kindly. “Everyone knows he sleeps around, behaves like an Alpha and thought himself too good for any Alpha or marriage.”
That night, she let Howard brought her to bed. He transported her into a realm of hot delight and ecstasy. He drove into her deep and true, she clung to his body and they fell into a rhythm as timeless as the beat of their heart. It was a night she would remember her whole life. Being with Howard Stark was unlike anything she'd ever experienced. Her attraction to him was absolute, and she realized that her desire for him was inexhaustible.
With their eyes still on him, he leaped down and landed not a few feet from the pair. Tony watched as Rogers and Thor stared at each other like gunslingers. Steve begin “Now, I don't know what you planned on doing here…"
Suddenly Steve wasn’t looking at the laughing playboy anymore. Tony’s eyes became cold, powerful and dangerous, pinned him with such focus that all other external distractions were no more than white noise-IRON MAN. And wasn’t it fucks up that having that sharp, bright white, fearsome intelligence focussed on him with lethal intent sent a thrill up Steve’s spine.
No one was better for Tony than Pepper. She was the best, always had been, and always would be.
“Sacred…?” Tony laughed, but it was bitter and guarded like he was nursing some feeling deep down inside and was afraid to let it loose. “No, it isn’t. It is poison. The sweetest poison that poisons your mind, make you believe in fake feeling and unrealistic dreams before slowly eating at your soul.”
Watching them from the driver’s seat. "Is that another Asgardian?" Natasha called over the sound of thunder outside. She hadn't gotten a good look at their intruder.
Rogers looked away, rolled his eyes. It annoyed Tony so much, that the Captain America behaved like Shield lapdog. Didn't he heard what Tony and Banner said, some leader...
“This way, Mr. Stark.” Bruce replied. He led him down a barren corridor, walked companionably by his side.
“Close it." He heard the brisk and resign order from Clint. His heart stuck in his heart, refused to beat as Natasha thrust the scepter into the machine's center, the fiery glow above her brightening as it drew nearer to the portal.
Tony had never asked JARVIS because of the thought of… but the fucker must, at least, had enough footage to put together a cohesive picture of what he had gone through in there and at the most video and audio of him being strapped to a table and screamed in agony, delirious with pain. Just the thought of someone saw him under such a vulnerable position made Tony’s blood boiled.
Natasha pointed Loki’s staff into the circle of magic surrounded the ray pointed up into the heavens, pierced the bubble and pushed it forward into the center of the device where the tesseract pulsed worryingly.
The image of Tony in Steve’s dream piled onto the Omega. His hair was brunet instead of black, his eyes brown instead of oceanic blue, and his body short instead of tall, but Steve knew with unshakable clarity that people knew the sky was blue and the grass was green that they were simply different versions of the other half of his soul.
(See the end of the chapter for
Seventy years, the man who introduced himself as Nick Fury, leader of an organization name SHIELD told him.
Worse, Tony was stunned by Roger’s alpha smell that his breath came out short, never had he met an alpha with such strong pheromone, washing over him in a wave of desire. Rogers practically screamed alpha hormones. The serum must have strengthened Roger’s smell just as it made Rogers beyond the alpha stage.
Thinking about dreams… brought back the memory of his first dream, of Steve calling his name sweetly, his eyes full of love and adoration. ‘SHIT! NO, don’t go there, never go there!’
"Thanks." Bruce smiled sadly before glanced away, unable to look at Tony. Tony frowned "But the last time I was in New York I kinda broke... Harlem." The guilt was thick in Bruce's voice, but it also as if Bruce was gauging his reaction. Like he was worried a mere reminder of what the Hulk had done would make Tony recoiled from him. In truth, Bruce should be the one who recoiled from him, The Merchant of Death.
But something didn’t add up… Something was clawing at his brain…
His affair were publicized in the news because people believed soul-bonds were sacred and everlasting and wanted to know what went wrong. There were even a discussion about it on Television.
“Stop crying!” Howard yelled. “All I did was broke your stupid little toy car.” He said meanly. “Did you made this stupid thing?!” He said with distaste, holding the car in his hand. “You called yourself a Stark!” he threw the car at Tony’s arm which would surely bruise. “I tell you to stop crying, you pathetic Omega! Why couldn’t you be strong like an Alpha!”
Steve could hear the next thing Tony said with his better than most hearing "That's the guy my dad never shut up about? Wonder if they should've kept him on ice." The words cut at him like bitter blades. How Tony could say that?!

Loki slowly rose from the ground, his rage turned into mirth as recognition coloring his features, "The soldier." A laugh passed his lips as he used his scepter to stand, "the Man out of time."
“I'd like to know why SHIELD is using the Tesseract to build weapons of mass destruction.” they could hear the warning in Bruce’s voice and knew better than to lie.
Tony couldn't tell if this was a good thing or not or that he was waiting with bated breath until Steve began positively beaming and Tony sighed in relief. "I can't believe this." Steve was saying laughingly.
Steve nodded, even though he knew Tony was half lying. “You’re a strong and forgiving person.”
"I think Loki is trying to wind us up, this is a man who means to start a war, and if we don't stay focused, he'll succeed." Steve looked over at Bruce and then back to Tony. "We have ordered, we should follow them." He said, squared his jaw and straightened his spine.
could get on one bed, immediately took the drink Tony gave and downed it, weirdly he started feeling tipsy as soon as he gulped it “What is this thing ?” He quizzed
The blonde visibly tensed "winner in the painting category, you are sitting in my seat, move."
Tony noticed the sudden change in posture, he wasn’t an idiot, well, he was for saying that but…he’ll uh manage ?
"B-but wasn't she born a month later ? She should be fully developed !?" Tears threatened to spill
"Yeah, well apparently. . . Hold your inner fan girl in"
"Tony !" Yup, he messed up "it is very important to me !" Steve was… blushing ? "Is that why you were behaving awkward ?" Steve asked meekly "I am sorry Tony ! I-I get that working with a team member that lo-likes you can be very—" blah blah blah Tony didn’t hear ahead.
Yup, the title is a reference to ‘I Found’ by Amber Run

"Long enough"
he clicked the call button and let the phone ring...

Tony wasn’t sure that he was supposed to read this—ok who is he kidding, he is very sure that he wasn’t supposed to read this.
Steve nodded "I know" he took a sip, he wished he could get drunk "it was because we didn’t trust each other"
Calling Pepper ? Yeah, that’s a good one.
Tony let out a bitter laughter and raised his champagne "For mom" he toasted.
"You are not the one who's a pregnant super soldier!" He snapped
"I knew he wouldn't be able to keep it in his pants" Fury sighed looking at the Now family
he closed his eyes again and fisted his hand.
Asking that question still feels like a border that they shouldn’t cross yet.
"Book me in"
He slowly walked back to his room, tears prickling his eyes
What he didn’t expect was that Tony would talk about Siberia and the accords as soon as he reached there.
"Well, look at my baby bro getting all amazed over fancy pieces of glasses" Bucky teased as Steve huffed
Tony looked at the blonde weirdly ‘does he not know that Peggy’s my cousin ? We both are famous people’ Tony rolled his eyes ‘where does this man lives ? Under a rock ?" Peggy will kill Tony for causing any disturbance so he moves a seat anyway "happy ?" He mocked the blonde
"Boss wants you in his office though" she gave a sympathetic smile "hopefully he doesn’t cuts your joy short"
"What’s wrong Tony ?" He can honestly hear the frown from three states away
"Tony" Steve cut his rant off "
"Would love to" Steve gave him a sincere smile and Tony couldn’t help but grin back.
She backed off as bucky stepped in, he rubbed his hand on the other's arm "it's alright" "you're ok" "we love you" "she'll be out" he muttered as the pregnant soldier leaned on his chest and breathed out "I am horny, give me Tony" he whined
"Steve, I love you" Tony said as Tears pricked his eyes
"Hey Steve" Sharon greeted as he settled on his desk "heard about your win, congratulations"
he shook his head to stop the flash back. Leaving behind a trail of tears on floor he finally reached the school med faculty.
Tony paced outside the operation theatre as Natasha sat on the hospital's sofa, expression: stoic, Bucky was muttering ways to kill stark in Russian as he watched the other pace around. The rest of the team was sprawled around in the waiting room and the corridor as they wished for their friends' health and good.
Tony lay awake on the bed facing away from Steve, curled into himself but not crying.

Strange is a neurosurgeon but when he heard of captain's pregnancy he studied day and night, just for the moment to be able to help in the birth process.

Late Saturday nights, who doesn’t love those ! Staying awake till 6 in the morning, having fun, playing games, getting drunk and then sleeping in late till your body
"No. You don’t." Steve growled "Talk to me"
But Steve did expect that, he expected it because he knows something that others didn’t,
"You got brother ? James Barnes ?"
Tony Stark, people usually scramble to follow but this adorable-sexy-blonde didn’t.
He swallowed deeply "No…yes ? Kinda, Was waiting for you to get showered"
Steve nodded shakily as he felt the water make its way down his thigh
Tony looked back at Natasha perplexed as she stood up to go to the stage for her speech, she mouthed ‘

He dropped the screwdriver down on his desk as he scrambled to call Pepper for paperwork of handing over a few islands to steve
Tony handed him a glass
"Aw Romanoff, Miss me ?" The red and golden saviour blasted a few of those son-of-bitches "we can make up for the lost time, let’s go to the beach ! It’s a date, darling" Tony Joked
Tony asks him softly, because he’s covered in blankets but he still feels cold and he’s too drunk and aching and sad to sleep alone tonight.
Flame Guy- Cass- stepped forward with a small shrug. “Oh, nothing, actually,” he admitted casually, “we were just hired to draw you in here and keep you there. Our employers told us where abouts in storage you guys were keeping the energy field, and that all we needed to do was put you on that side of it, and viola.” He turned, clapping his colleagues on the shoulders. “Well done guys. This was executed perfectly. Chinese food is on me tonight, ‘kay?”
“What?”
Sam was already at the table as Steve sat down, and he was going to town on a bowl of cereal as his hand tapped quickly against the screen of his phone. “Mornin’” he greeted through a mouthful of Lucky Charms, “did you know Bucky and Natasha went on a date last night?”
Thor, the magnificent man that he was, had indeed prepped the coffee machine for him, and Tony sighed with satisfaction when the cup touched his lips. Nothing better than three shots of espresso at four in the morning, and that was just a fact. While he sipped, he distantly heard the sounds of the TV behind him, and once he had gotten half-way through the cup, he turned to glance into the living room.
Pushing his card in the door and opening it with a sophisticated swish, Steve slipped through quietly, shaking off his hair as he did so to try and dislodge some of the raindrops. He was wearing a SHIELD uniform after his Cap one had been destroyed, and it felt a little too tight, a little uncomfortable. It obviously hadn’t been designed by someone who knew his body as intimately as Tony did- knew the lines and divots he’d traced with his hands countless times.
Tony flipped him off on autopilot, but Steve was just nodding his head in agreement, and Tony knew it was already a lost cause. “Tony, you can stay with me for the first few games. The rules really are simple, I’ll teach you them on the way. For now- I declare Bruce as the first seeker. You’re not allowed to leave the top five floors of the tower, but every place above that is fair game. Everyone has two minutes to hide.”
Her chair went back to four legs as she grabbed her notepad and then began to scribble quickly on it. Steve frowned in curiosity, watching her for a few seconds until she lifted up the pad and showed him a very bad stick-figure drawing of what appeared to be Tony, with a massive downturned face. There was an arrow coming from him, leading to the words
“Did I imagine it?” He asked Sam, once Bucky had closed the door behind him and emptied the room of all guests.
Steve’s fingers choked at his collar and his body moved in preparation to reel back for the final blow, and there was lots of yelling coming from different places and Tony didn’t think they were all from Steve, and suddenly there weren’t hands on his shirt any more but instead the sound of outraged yelling and static electricity, and he was falling, falling, his head hitting the-
Steve sniffed, leaning in against Tony’s uninjured shoulder and letting his fingers grip softly against the other man’s neck. He made sure to keep his touch impossibly light- the images of what he’d done before were burned into the back of his mind, and he couldn’t rid himself of them.
“Some things are out of my control,” JARVIS responded, and Steve had forgotten he’d even asked a question until he heard the answer what felt like a lifetime later, “and I will regret that for the rest of my existence.” His words resonated, and their sorrow sat, as still and poignant as the final note in a ballad. Steve wished JARVIS had a physical form that he could turn his back on, but the computer was everywhere. He was as inescapable as this new world that Steve was now trapped in, the world without Tony. “But Captain, you must know that I will not allow another human under my care to come to harm when I
And of course, in response to Steve’s sudden surge of affections, Peter had gotten the chance to properly bond with him for the first time, leading to instant attachment—predictable, really, seeing as it was Steve and he was impossible not to fall in love with, no matter what age you were. Peter now asked Steve to pick him up for cuddles as well as Tony, he always crawled over to Steve on the couch (probably because the guy was a human heater and Peter, much like Tony, was attracted to the warmth of his cuddles) and, obviously, Steve absolutely doted on him in return. They were adorable together, and sometimes when Tony saw Steve holding Peter up to eye level in his huge hands and brush their noses together just to watch the little boy giggle, he had to do a double take in order to not think about how similar the two of them looked.
“Thank you,” Steve whispered, curling inward a little again, like a scared kid. “Thank you.”
He wondered what kissing Tony would feel like. Taste like. Would his hair be soft? Undoubtedly. Would the kiss be hard, light, chaste, dirty-
Immediately, Steve felt whatever good mood he’d been working to sour, and he yanked his hand back irritably.
Steve just nodded, wrapping his arm around Tony’s waist. “Think he’s still shaken up by all of it,” he explained with a heavy feeling in his heart, “it was a really close call. He must’ve been terrified.”
Tony licked his lips, fingers tapping a staccato rhythm against the cot. But when he looked back toward Steve, his gaze was resolute. “Without a doubt,” he murmured, head nodding. “I want to marry you more than anything in the world, Steve. These last few days— they’ve only cemented the idea of it all.”
for me,” he explained reassuringly, “it’s you. Whatever we do will be good. It’ll be amazing. And we don’t have to—”
“Not Sam,” came a familiar British voice, and Steve frowned, sitting up as Peggy told him “open the door and let me talk to you, Steven , or I will sit here and wait until you need to pee and then ambush you instead. Your choice.”
Thor licked his lips, holding his posture for another moment before just shrugging and then slumping back down again. He looked so relieved, and there was gratitude deep in his eyes as he patted Steve on the shoulder.
They laughed nervously at each other as Steve took Tony’s hand in his own again and then started pulling them out into the enormous corridor. He hoped he remembered where the fuck Tony’s room was after all this, honestly.
. “They don’t know language, so I don’t really speak it, per se,” he began, and Tony was almost appeased until he added, “I can just sense the emotions behind what it is they’re trying to say. And he wanted the glowing man and the singing man, which I assume is you and Steve.”
“Okay,” he stammered, not looking Steve in the eye as he opened and shut his mouth, checking for fractures or breaks, “okay, okay, I’m sorry. Sorry. Okay.”
(That smile stayed on his face for the rest of the day, and it only grew bigger every time he heard that metal clink against glass.)
It took a split second for Steve’s stomach to plummet right down to his shoes. He froze up, feeling a horrible tightness start to wrap around his heart, and his feet had stumbled down the steps before he knew what he was doing, hand almost going out to reach for Tony before he stopped himself in fear. “What do you- I don’t understand, what do you mean, ‘breaking up’? Why would you want to do that?”
Not in this state.”
“I...Yeah- I’ve got this, Thor, you go back in if you want.”
you to do, if ever this… if ever I hurt him again.” He stared at Clint seriously, his jaw tight. “I can’t let him go through this again.”
“Oh, well excuse me for having other things on my mind, Steve,” Tony responded curtly, looking at him with an incredulous face, “and it’s not like I just sit here and do jack shit, you know. I’m working to keep this whole fucking building running, usually running your errands for you-”
- no, for fuck’s sake, not dead, just busy.
“Sorry you had to meet me,” Tony whispered, gaze dropping. “You would’ve been so much better without… God,
“Hey!” someone called from behind them all, and Steve turned only to watch Clint, Natasha and Sam begin to retrace their steps and walk back over too, faces concerned. They must have spotted the standoff as they’d been walking out and come to see what was up.
She laughed sweetly, patting his cheek. “See, this seems to be proving far more effective than any of the other methods,” her voice was full of delight and triumph, and he wanted to spit at her again, but his face wasn’t listening to him. He couldn’t stop crying. It was all he could see, right there, right in the front of his mind, his hands around Tony’s neck-
how much I’d like to continue this, believe me- but you’re drunk, Tony, and I’m not gonna-”
He felt Steve’s eyes on him as he sat himself down on his desk and took a steadying breath, pulling open one of his drawers. He was sure there was a bottle of whiskey stuffed in there somewhere which might help ease the complete agony that his head was currently in.
dangerous. It’s just better for everyone if y-“
Steve blushed sheepishly. “You, uh. You seemed very pleased with it. I didn’t want to step on your moment.”
Steve could hardly believe that. “He’d tried to have you
“Ooooh,” she said, shoulders jumping excitedly, “now
Steve just clenched his jaw. “Not enough, obviously. Still beat my ass. Tony said he would find ‘em, but… I don’t know if he will, now.” He couldn’t help but throw Bucky a slightly bitter look at that. Goddamn idiot had put his foot in it as always, and ruined everything with Tony. Not to mention the chance of him finding the fuckers that took his stuff.
He had to move, but he couldn’t. His limbs wouldn’t listen. He wanted Tony, but he couldn’t get him, he was too far away, too angry, and for good fucking reason. Steve didn’t deserve him. Steve never had. And who knew? Maybe Tony
Steve wasn’t sure what it meant that he looked at that image and thought
, it felt like the sand-infused mudwater that he’d been half-drowned in years ago, over and over and over again, choking the life from his lungs, burning him from the inside out whilst everyone had laughed and jeered and gripped his hair as they dunked him-
The tension in Steve’s muscles was full of anger, need for a fight. Tony knew he wouldn’t stop until he got one, and won it.
“In my defence-“
child.
The man eyed him, but then apparently decided it wasn’t worth the hassle to question him and just rolled his chair over to a different computer, where he pressed a few buttons. It only took a moment. “Says here that Agent Rumlow signed into interview room 7 earlier. Don’t think they’re planning on keeping him there long though.”
He didn’t quite manage to avoid Tony’s eye, though. Drawn like a magnet, he did it all the fucking time- couldn’t help himself even if he wanted to. His gaze locked into Tony’s, just for a moment, and when Tony registered him, he smiled just that little bit brighter. Waved slowly. He looked… not blissed out exactly, but something close. Unbothered by the world, maybe. Steve could only think about how horribly vulnerable Tony must be, whenever he was like that.
Tony grinned, and made a kissy face up at Steve. “Not if I got you first, asshole.”
“You’re an idiot, you know that?” Bucky asked him, “have you
“Hey Tony,” Steve said, turning to the other boy with a smile, “I think you should have that arm-wrestle with Sam now. I’m feeling in the mood to watch him get shown up.”
Sam nodded, and then changed the topic over to the match results from yesterday. Steve allowed it to wash over him, grateful of Sam’s presence that morning. Grateful of Sam as a whole, really- the boy and his family were a Godsend.
Bastards.
and Steve had been sat on the couch sketching and now- now Tony couldn’t feel him breathe. His heart wasn’t beating.
“Fuck, Tony, you’re gonna kill me.” He planted Tony into the sheets and gripped the washcloth like it was the only thing tethering him to the world. “We’re gonna clean up, and then we’re gonna snuggle, and you’re not going to say things like that for the next few hours.”
“We are not the men we were,” Steve told him, “we are people with scars, and wounds, and pains that linger with us. You went through something terrible, and today you were very suddenly reminded of that. But you don’t have to apologise for that, or suffer through it alone. You’re not gonna get better if you’re treating it like it’s something to be ashamed of. It’s not. It’s just… it’s proof that you made it out. That you’re still here.” Steve’s face lightened and his thumb ran delicately over Tony’s cheekbone. “I for one, am incredibly grateful for that.”
Steve nodded and thanked him before getting out of the car and making his way into school. Everyone was already in class—second period would be English, which was easy enough to get through without using much brain power. His friends would be in that class too, which was going to be interesting. Sam would probably have informed the others by that point, and so he figured he’d be getting grilled by them for most of the day. Over time, they’d come to care for Tony as one of their own, and so it wasn’t just a matter concerning Steve any more. It impacted all of them.
“Why?”
He caught his breath and waited until the pain died down a little, pulling his bloodied hands away from his face and wiping them against his jeans. He couldn’t believe things had gone to such shit in the space of about five minutes- his good mood had evaporated entirely, and left only sour frustration in its place.
The gym teacher sat him down on one of the chairs outside the Principal’s office before opening the office door and stepping inside, presumably to explain to Principal Fury what had just happened. One by one all the rest of his friends were put into seats too. They all sat in a row, blood trickling from various injuries. Steve felt bad, but he hadn’t even noticed any of them had even gotten involved. “You shouldn’t have jumped in,” he said shortly, “I had it.”
“A grown-ass man who never got to actually be a kid,” Steve raised an eyebrow, and looked back out on to the horizon.
And then he woke up again.
Nights were mostly just spent curled up either on the faded brown couch watching TV or up in bed, doing roughly the same but with some more added heavy petting. Steve made a mental note to buy new sheets for the owners upon their return, and all cushions with farm animals on them had been hastily piled into the corner on the first night. There was something intensely off-putting about locking eyes with a smiling cow caricature embroidered onto a pillow while you were balls deep inside your boyfriend- although it had made Tony laugh very hard when Steve had mentioned it, so he figured it wasn’t a total loss.
Steve just sighed. “Do you ever run out of those things?”
Steve swallowed, suddenly feeling absolutely awful. God, he’d just gone and assumed the worst of Tony automatically, not even bothering to take into account Tony’s reasons. Fuck. He’d made a mess of this.
They raced down the hill, turning sharp around the corner and then slowing down, just so Tony could swerve near Zeke and stick his middle finger up as the boy waited by the bus stop at the foot of the hill. Steve looked back, watching Zeke yelling something unintelligible behind them, and laughed harder. He just wished there’d been a puddle to drive over.
Thor grit his teeth, sending Steve a despairing look and then glancing back to Clint with a shrug. Both of them knew that Steve wouldn’t change his mind on this. Not when it came to Tony. In fact, he was pretty sure everyone on the team knew that. The others would be expecting Steve to be searching for him, undoubtedly. Under other circumstances, he might have been a little embarrassed by that, but as it was, he couldn’t find it in himself to care. He just wanted to find Tony as quickly as possible.
Steve didn’t care enough to analyse Loki’s words, instead just snatching some of the bandages up and then tearing at the casing. “Thank you,” he said earnestly, turning around just as Thor enveloped his brother in a bear hug. Tony was frowning in discomfort, his good arm holding his bad while he lay flat on the couch. “Okay, I’m gonna close this cut on your cheek up for you now.”
“Good,” Steve said earnestly, before pausing for a moment and looking down. “But Tony- I feel like I should warn you, I’ve not… I’ve never done any of this before, okay- never been in a relationship, never even kissed anyone. I’m probably gonna fuck up all the time, I don’t- I’m no good at this stuff-“
, God, what’d they been thinking—
She smiled warmly at him, reaching out to shake his hand as if she hadn’t just given him a very ominous threat less than a second previously, and then stepped back out of the still-open door again, heels making their clicking noise underfoot as she walked away. Rhodey watched her for a moment, before nodding once.
Jesus fucking Christ, how could anyone be
Tony just hummed and waved a hand. “Don’t need it,” he said, which was true. He was working on a research-high, and it was keeping his body and mind constantly moving. “You about to go on your run?”
“Okay,” Tony said eventually, breaking away and looking down at him with a small smile. His hands framed Steve’s face as he tapped the door shut with his foot and then kissed him once, twice, three times. “Tell me what you want, Steve. Anything at all.”
Tony looked at him incredulously, before it faded into hurt. “Do really think that little of me?” He asked, voice quiet.
“Don’t apologise,” Tony looked at him, frown creasing his forehead once more, which he seemed to do a surprising amount when looking at Steve, “you don’t belong here, though, that’s for sure.”
Natasha frowned. “I didn’t,” she said, while Bruce and Thor shook their heads too. They all turned their heads to the living room on the other side of the penthouse, eyes narrowing. “CLINT!” Natasha yelled in irritation.
Things settled down, after that.
“We told him to look after the civilians in the front buildings first and foremost. There’s no one on the other side, and we can’t afford to spread him too thin in case they get behind him and start killing innocents.”
"Oh, believe me Steve, you do not know my world," Tony told him with a small little laugh. "That fact does not leave this conversation, alright?"
He opened his mouth, trying to tell her he felt a bit sick, but the music drowned out his voice, and suddenly he was being dragged into the middle of the crowds before he could stop himself. As soon as he took the first step, he knew he was fucked. Whatever had been in his drink was strong- too strong for someone who’d never had more than a few sips before in his life, and he felt the world spinning out of control almost immediately.
They’d almost made it to the restaurant Tony had been leading them to. Almost, but not quite. Because when they turned the corner and tried to cross the street, Steve heard Tony’s name get called out amongst the general hubbub of the streets, and felt Tony spin next to him.
“Asset,” he blurted out as soon as the word came to him, but by that time those three had moved and instead it was Steve again, sat in a chair by Tony’s said and letting his fingers linger faintly against Tony’s hand. It felt nice.
But God, he’d never do what Ty had done- a shitty movie and then copping a feel in the back of the cinema? So fucking trashy. And cheap. Steve might be broke as shit, but if it was a date, then he’d put some Goddamn effort into at least making it nice for Tony, Jesus-
“I hate you so much,” Steve said grumpily, “and I really hate being carried.”
Steve just rolled his eyes and then stepped sideways, letting their shoulders brush together lightly once more. Thor didn’t speak up for a little while, and his body remained unnaturally still. A droplet of water slid slowly down the centre of his nose as he remained stoically staring into the same spot on Sarah Rogers’ grave.
desert,” Steve yelled, lifting his foot and slamming it down into Tony’s thigh. He felt the vibration of his own bone cracking through his body and screamed in pain, hands covering his head as he curled into himself in a pathetic attempt at cover. “You
Winter wrapped around New York like a cold sheet, and Steve became used to the feeling of numb fingers and cold limbs every time he left the Wilsons’ home. All his friends thought he looked hilarious decked out in his five layers, two pairs of gloves, a bobbly hat and a thick woollen scarf, but he was not perturbed by their teasing.
“Damn right there is,” Tony sighed and then kicked sullenly at a broken table-leg, watching it roll into a crack in the room. “But there always will be. Such is the nature of a genius billionaire playboy philanthropist.” He smiled drily and then cocked an eyebrow at Steve, who flushed in embarrassment and prepared an apology for their earlier ’conversation’. But Tony waved it off before he could begin and then stood too, hands bracing his knees for support.
“No,” Tony said, a little too fast. “Well- I mean, yes. But in all fairness, I did have an aircraft land on my head, so-
They remained there for a good few minutes or so, Steve fitting himself in between Tony’s legs as he sat on the counter up in front of him. His mouth felt delicious, skin soft against Tony’s, and the occasional hum of pleasure from low in Steve’s throat sent little shivers down Tony’s neck every time. Tony had kissed a few people before; again, this was mostly at StarkInudstries events while drunk. The people involved had always been older, and always just been looking for a way to kill time, so it’d never been particularly life-changing. But kissing Steve felt like finding Nirvana. He just
“If that transmission was sent from somewhere, we can follow the signal back. I can go find him,” Carol said firmly, lighting up her fists and nodding her head. “If he said day thirteen, then the message is five days old. Universally speaking, if it only took five days to cross the distance, it cant be that far away. I can get to him.”
They both jumped out of the Jeep, turning to look up at the farmhouse ahead of them. Steve glanced sideways and gauged Tony’s reaction slightly nervously, wondering what he was thinking. But it didn’t seem to be anything bad—if anything, Tony looked pleased. He chuckled quietly and then shut his eyes, taking in a deep breath. “Fuck, it’s been a while since I couldn’t smell gasoline every time I inhaled. Is this what it feels like to breathe non-polluted air?”
He asked, and Tony’s hands got tighter against the sheets, shaking and desperate. Steve wanted to tell him to stop holding them so tight, it’d hurt him. But he didn’t want to tell Tony to do anything, not ever again. Because then Tony might listen to him, and all Steve would ever wonder would be ‘does he want to do this, or is he simply too scared to say no?’
JARVIS would have. But JARVIS was… offline.
Tony walked down the path, hands shoved in his pockets. Steve just watched from the door, noting every glance behind him Tony made until the moment he rounded the corner and disappeared from view completely.
“Were you legal?”
Rocket grunted. “I dunno, we heard about a bunch of warlocks who managed to use the stone without exploding into a thousand little pieces by sharing out the power between them, and then we tried it. Amazingly, it worked. God knows why. Maybe we were just too stubborn to die.”
In answer, Steve threw down a letter Natasha had written up earlier at her apartment. “That’s a letter from Tony Stark’s lawyer,” he said sharply, for once in his life the lies falling easily off his tongue, “you know—one of the eleven that he has on his roster, with more successful cases between them than the rest of all US attorneys combined? We don’t know how Stark managed to get a message through to them, but he did, and now they’re demanding we allow them to represent him unless we want them suing us for breaching about a dozen different human rights laws. We’ve got mere hours to get a confession out of him before they can arrive and run rings round us. So I suggest you let me through, unless you want the downfall of SHIELD itself to be on your conscience.”
And Steve just couldn’t contain it any more.
Later on, though, when Steve was sat with him at lunch and rifling through his bag in search of his sketchbook, Tony noticed the box of chocolates were unopened. Which, for anyone else, might not have been odd. But Steve ate like a starving man and never ever saved his food for later. He always ate what was in front of him.
in my spot.”
It took another two minutes, but finally,
Distantly, he heard Clint ask ‘what’d I do?’ behind him, but the man was no longer Tony’s centre of focus. He leaned both hands on the kitchen table and looked solemnly at Peter, who was now sucking the crayon idly as he scrunched up the corner of paper with his fist. When the boy noticed Tony,  he broke out into a gummy smile and held up his arms expectantly.
“How is this the right call- what if he comes back up there and sees I’m missing and then completely breaks down, huh? I have to go b-“
Needless to say, dinner got burnt.
Tony rolled his eyes and hoped Steve wouldn’t be able to see the blush of embarrassment. “I’m not nervous,” he tried, but when Steve just made a disbelieving face at him, Tony huffed. “Alright, I’m a
He didn’t want them to split up. Divorced parents were a pain in the ass, according to the girl who sat next to him in math class. She was always talking about what a hassle it was, moving all her stuff from one house to another every weekend.
“Long morning, huh?”
THIS IS LONG AS FUCK but basically I asked around a few places to see what people were interested in, and a lot of you came back to me with like. Friendship dynamics and stuff, so I figured??? Let's give it  a go? But it ended up being 20k, whoops. My bad.
This time it was Clint who laughed, and Tony who pulled the face. “I think we should engage in other activities first,” he argued, beginning to kiss Steve’s neck in an attempt at conviction.
“How are we supposed to get through
Steve watched, still a little dumbfounded by the whole situation as Tony vaulted over the reception desk and began trawling around underneath it. “Are you- uh, is that allowed?”
Above him, Tony sighed. “Okay. So that was a lie. I’ll let you down right now if you want me to, I’m not an asshole, and I’m not going to force you to go the hospital, but I really think you should. And. Also. The date thing. You should do that too. Because I’m an asshole and my jacket probably
Steve looked at him blankly, and then folded his arms. “How much sleep have you had in the past four days?” He asked with a cocked head.
Clint sighed, stepping forward and then taking Peter from Tony’s arms. He rolled his eyes and made an exaggerated face at the boy, who responded with what sounded almost like an affirmative noise. “Look, you adults go argue this out with one another, but I’m gonna get this little guy some breakfast and continue with Peppa Pig. Come on, chuckles, let’s go eat.”
Certainly a nice way to wake up, Steve thought, breathing in sharply as Tony dug his teeth into the soft spot just under Steve’s jaw. He moved his hand, curled it into Tony’s hair and gripped, just the way he knew Tony liked it, and heard the pleased little grunt he got in response, the man’s thigh shifting so it pressed down between Steve’s.
“Nothing,” Steve shrugged him off viciously, turning away and hoisting his bag a little higher on his shoulder. “Nothing, Clint, just… just leave it, alright, I have to get to class.”
“I’m gonna clean all this blood off your face,” Bucky told him with a roll of his eyes, “God, I feel like we’re in middle school again.”
There were yells from the door, and then Steve watched in confusion as James pushed through his friends and jumped out of the door. His face was serious as he looked over Steve’s shoulder to Tony, and when Steve turned, he saw Tony’s face go from angry to mildly confused. “
Tony made a noise. “Like hell you will,” he said, uncrossing his legs and jumping to his feet. “My bike’s outside. You just gotta promise not to fall off- that would be beneficial to absolutely nobody-”
, Steve.” Tony’s voice crackled through the speakers, “who’s—what even… fuck, nevermind, questions later, just get in, come on. Do you know whether you were followed?”
The guy nodded, obviously relieved as he backed away and walked off quickly. Steve was just left there, more than a little confused. “What in the fuck?” He asked Natasha after a few moments.
Steve realised he was talking about Rhodey and Natasha. He nodded his head. “They’re okay,” he said, “I’ll… what about Tony? What happened to him?”
Tony gave a tiny shrug, tearing off another small chunk of toast. His face was empty. “Dunno,” he said, “probably. Got nowhere else to go.”
#2 stony
goddamn video. Steve pulled a face and left that comment alone, but they were everywhere, plaguing his notifications. Tony’s PR manager had told him to just let it lie, and that it would fade away in a week or so, but still. It hurt, seeing them come for Tony like that, all for something he’d not even had a damn say in. It made his skin scrawl and his heart seethe with anger.
talk to myself.”
“You didn’t,” Tony was quick to correct him, squeezing Steve’s hand reassuringly and shaking his head, “Steve, I’m fine. Look at me. Not a scratch, I swear. Okay, well, maybe a
“What’s going on?” Steve asked, trying to soften himself when he saw how Tony was tensing up in front of him. “You’ve been acting strange since last night. One minute you were fine and the next—”
It hurt like a punch to the gut.
Steve bit his lip and looked down at his now-bare finger. The anger was burning down inside him- that ring wasn’t
“Tony, you don’t… what are you doing,” Steve asked weakly, gripping on his hair, “why are you… how do you even know my name? Why are you being nice?”
Wordlessly, she pulled out a Hershey’s bar from the inside of her jacket, whilst Steve simply tutted disapprovingly. Bruce, however, didn’t seem to mind consuming jacked goods, and quickly snatched it from her hands in delight. “You are my favourite, Romanov.”
Steve watched his face flicker for a second, eyes dimming. And then before Steve could even ask, Tony was shutting down and closing off, stepping a little bit out of Steve’s space as his real smile left and then came back different. Brittle.
So sue him, he was
“They’re here,” Bruce declared, and Tony watched his two friends scramble to their feet and nod to each other.
Steve turned to face him and backhanded him across the face so quickly that  Tony didn’t even see the hand fly.
lost for a moment. He just turned his head away from Rumlow slowly, staring at the wall, jaw tight enough that Steve wondered whether it might shatter. His eyes were glassy. Rumlow just laughed and laughed and laughed, beginning to stand in his seat, walk over to Tony’s side where he stuck out a hand and grabbed Tony’s chin, forcing him to look up at Rumlow as opposed to the wall. This time it was Steve who flinched.
With an anxious sigh, Steve did.
“Cut that down. Turn off the heating systems and divert power to thrusters.”
His face was black and blue.
He’s just tired. And sad. It would be so much easier.
He’d get up soon. Probably.
Tony watched, as surprised as he had been the first time he’d watched Steve kiss the ugly thing that had been shoved in his chest all those years ago.
“Right,” Steve said quickly, “okay.”
He wiped a hand across his face briskly, sucking in a sharp breath as he composed himself. A million things to do, and here he was, sat crying on the floor feeling fucking sorry for himself. Steve was right; he probably needed to go to bed. Busy day tomorrow and all that.
“Paul,” Steve leaned forward and leaned his head into his heads, shutting out the rapidly approaching migraine and just focusing on breathing, “please… please, can we just talk about this tomorrow? I know I let you down. I know. I can’t tell you how sorry I am for that, after everything you’ve done for me. But I… I can’t do this right now. Please.” He looked up, hating how weak his voice sounded, how he could hardly see through the wetness pooling in his eyes. “Just let me see Tony.”
“You wanna do some experiments?” Steve asked smoothly, making Tony laugh once more.
He’d tried. He’d never stop trying to help. But that was all he could do now.
Steve looked around at all of his friends- at their soft faces and open smiles as they slowly continued the conversations they’d been having before Steve had joined them again- and felt something soften a little bit inside him. He smiled tiredly back at them and felt Sam’s hand pat his back, felt Natasha’s shoulder rest against his.
“They don’t trust me to walk. But I’m pumped full of meds, and nothing’s topsy turvy anymore, so I should be clear to sign off today.”
--” another hiccup “
“You’re such a fucking meatball,” he says. “Who does this, Steve?”
“It’s not me I’m worried about,” Tony says through clenched teeth, nodding subtly at the tiny bundle in his arms.
“I think he’s serious,” Tony says, more than a little eager to have those eyes on him again.
“Bribing ‘em early, huh?” he asks Mr. Rogers-- Steve, is it?-- who responds with a gorgeous grin, thick arms crossed against his deliciously massive chest.
“Yeah?”
“Wh–really?” Steve asks, voice more than a little breathless.
March Prompt #30: “I thought I could manage. I can’t. Not without you. Not ever, not like this.”
“Uh, no. Corner, please.”
“Dey’re sleepin’.”
“Come to papa, babies,” Tony begs, pressing his forehead against the glass.
“Don’t forget the baby monitor.”
The chaos in his mind grinds to a halt as he registers the weight in his arms.
“I, uh, had a training session that got away from me.”
“Wanna name cat, Papa?”
“All of them?”
“We did,” Tony says. “For god knows how long. Much as I hate to say it, though, it looks like we’re gonna have to leave the rescuin’ to the rest of the team. They’ll be here soon, just watch.”
“Hmm?”
“I won’t lose any more good men out there–”
“Glad I could be of use.”
“I’m gonna need you to come back, right now,” Tony snaps. “Come on, chop chop, Cap, I need--

“It’s not so bad,” Steve shrugs. “I’ve got you, you’ve got me, and this is a pretty damn good chow mein, dontcha think?” he holds up one of the white takeout cartons sitting in their makeshift table– another box holding some of Steve’s art supplies.
“Yeah,” Steve replies, and how he can look so at ease with a burn on his leg, Tony has no idea. “But I think this is kinda throwin’ a wrench in our plans.”
Tony smothers the ridiculous urge to run after him, and takes a long swig of coffee instead. “Alright, Pepper pot,” he gives the woman his most winning smile. “Hand ‘em over.”
"One thing," he snarls, and lifts his index finger. "Before I left, I told you to do one thing for me."
“Great, see you back here as soon as they’re out, yeah?”
“Are you doing what I think you’re doing?”
“I want to go,” he’d told Tony. “Besides, an artist needs as much inspiration as he can get, right? I’m sure I’ll get into a good school with what I end up learnin’.”
“Maybe because she’s barely taller than our knees and I see a lot of zeros on this thing, Tony, and she’s two?” Steve whispers. “What the hell is she going to do with
“So, I found this waterfall…”
“Daddy?”
“Only if you want to, obviously,” Steve says shyly, fiddling with his ridiculously big fingers, and Tony buries the urge to reach out and intertwine them with his own. “I know my Ma would love to have ya.”
“Obviously,” Tony rolls his eyes.
“They’re cute,” she says. “
“No, stop–”
Tony scoffs. “That’s boring.”
Sam sighs. “You’re blind.”
“’mbul’nce?” Tony mumbles, and then with one loud grunt, he opens his eyes.
Blondie smiles. “No problem. Doctor Romanoff apologized, and said you’d be here as soon as you could.”
"You're so fucked," she breathes. Tony nods but can't look her in the eyes.
the time.”
The Captain sets his jaw, squares his shoulders, and just like that, the moment’s turned serious again. Red grabs Bucky by the shoulders, pushing him back towards the shadows, but whatever they might have been saying is lost when the Captain crouches down in front of Tony. He rests his elbows on his knees, and yeah, his arms are even more gorgeous up close.
It’s usually his favorite room, because even though it looks a lot like every other part of the Tower, the living room is everyone’s space. Most of the time, he can come down and find Bruce reading a book in the corner chair, or Sam and Bucky shouting at each other over Mario Kart. Sometimes, he comes in and finds Steve sketching close to the large, glass windows, and Tasha sprawled on the floor with a puzzle laid out in front of her.
Stevie smirks.
No one knew who initiated the kiss it just happened, late indeed but it did.
Peggy squeezed his shoulder slightly "I believe in you little brother"
"Well…" Tony teased "are you getting the award for directing my biopic ? I won’t be surprised"
He curled his fingers in ward
"Tony" still no attention
Steve closed his eyes and nodded, he felt the brush of Tony’s fingers on his hand as Tony took his glass away.
Tony looked at Steve again who immediately looked ahead
“Did you just imply that our love is Stockholm syndrome ?” Tony said offended
He sat in his class, feeling stares make holes in him like people are trying to make stories, brewing up tales on how his t-shirt has blood on it.
his pops' voice soothed the pain a bit, he took out his phone, his fingers trembling over the caller ID
Steve who with his hearing skills heard this and snapped " I am glad he couldn't keep it in his pants !"
The red-head raised a brow "you really have a bad memory Tin-Can"
He tried to rub the memories away and he got torn
“You bore me Rogers”
"I love you too" Steve smiled sadly, holding Tony's hands. The pregnancy was neither planned nor normal the chances of either the moth— err father dying or the child were high
