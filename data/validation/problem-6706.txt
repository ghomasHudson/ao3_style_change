Tony stares at the bag, at its sharp, irregular bulges. “You brought me a weapon.” He feels a dull, mechanical
You think he probably does know. Privacy is the relic of a fast dying world and Karim is, in his way, very much a futurist.
The tide is coming in, numbing his limbs, making him sluggish and dull. Taking him to itself. “I don’t understand,” is all he can think of to say. He swipes a hand across his mouth and finds that he’s shaking his head, a steady wobble of incomprehension. “I don’t
“A good point, well made,” Iron Man concedes. There’s a pause. When he speaks next, his voice is low, as if he’s speaking to himself. “Christ, I shouldn’t—” He breaks off abruptly. Then: “You really want this?”
“Well, yeah, but not like—” Iron Man cuts off. His voice when he resumes is a little stilted. “Sorry. The last thing you need right now is me perving all over you.”
Sleep has burnished away all of Steve’s softness. His jaw is clenched; his frown carves deep lines about his mouth and brow. He looks implacable. Unyielding. You try calling to mind his eyes, the way they look when he smiles, but the darkness has leached the color out of more than just the room, and you find you can no longer remember their shade.
Thank you so, so much to everyone who's commented, new and old. You've kept this story burning like a flame for me, even when RL made writing impossible. I haven't always had spoons to respond, but please know that every comment is read and reread and loved and... You guys are just the bee's knees, the cat's pyjamas, the... penguin's Honda Civic? The point is you're great and ilu and I just wanted you to know ❤️
He reaches around behind himself, searching for the entrance into his body, but the muscle there is clenched and unyielding. He presses in anyway. It
Slowly, thighs trembling, Steve sinks to the floor. He flexes his wrists, testing his bonds. They’re not so tight, really. He could probably slip them if he had to, even like this. He might not even need to dislocate his thumb to do it, and even if he does, what’s one momentary pain compared to this prolonged agony, this death of a thousand cuts?
Tony curls his hands inwards, nails biting into the flesh of his palms. Reopens the floodgates of his anger. Maybe, if he’s lucky, just
Iron Man comes back. Steve permits himself to be wiped down. The gentle friction of the washcloth sets something glowing inside him, a warmth that is nothing like the burning heat he felt before. He arches a little into Iron Man’s touch.
toes, you amend as your sense of proprioception comes back online. Memory arrives in discrete fragments which gradually mass into a coherent narrative.
.” The words collapse into a moan as one of Iron Man’s hands sneaks around the curve of Steve’s ribs, dragging warmth up his sternum and then down again towards his belly.
It’s like a match to gasoline. In the space of an instant, the world is remade in red and gold, in hunger and desperate, searing heat. He’s already starting to sweat, his cock hard enough to punch through steel and his pulse throbbing in his veins but all of that pales beside the sudden, overwhelming awareness of his own emptiness. He needs— needs—
Before Steve can pull away, Iron Man’s hand slides forward to catch Steve’s, squeezing in reassurance.
Fingers stroke over the place where Iron Man had tapped out his refusal, soothing Steve, gentling him. Iron Man shifts his weight once more and a hand presses lightly against Steve’s chest, holding him down to the mattress.
It’s practically Pavlovian, the way just the mention of Tony’s name sends tiny flames licking through his belly. Inside the staunch, unyielding leather of his boots, his toes make a valiant effort to curl.
Steve feels his body begin to respond, feels the flames of arousal rekindle, feels his dick begin to fill, but it’s not like it was before, not something maddening, not an affliction, just another part of the totality of the experience—the smoothness of Iron Man’s skin, the fullness in his mouth, the taste of salt on his tongue.
“It’s—” Steve starts to say something banal and inadequate, like, “it’s good,” or “it’s fine,” but the words won’t leave his mouth.
“I wish I could. I really do, but… Mr Stark’s coming back soon and there are some things I really need to see to and if things aren’t, you know. Urgent, anymore…”
Five and a half years ago and you’re sloppy with drink, shivering on the sidewalk outside a burning flophouse. Only minutes before Steve was walking out of the door and out of your life. He begged you, he shouted at you, he even hit you, to no avail. You can’t stop drinking. You can’t be the man he wants you to be. You’ve known that for a long time, and now Steve knows it too.
But even when it came to crushes—and Steve has had more than his share of those; it’s not impossible to like and admire someone without wanting to nail them to the wall, whatever some of the guys back in the mess hall might have thought—Steve’s impulses were pretty much indifferent. It was as if liking someone and wanting them were two completely different mechanisms. He held a torch for Peggy for years, but when his time came, she featured no more frequently in his fantasies than Jane Russell or Clark Gable or Gabe Jones of the Howling Commandos, and rather less frequently than the young woman he knew only as “Martine,” with whom he passed a few electrifying nights in Marseilles.
How long has this been building, and all without his noticing? He pops the top button of his jeans, hoping to relieve the pressure, but all he can think about is Tony’s mouth, the elegant line of his mustache, the sharp and almost startlingly deep dip of the cupid’s bow—about how that mustache might feel against his skin, about what it would look like to have those lips stretched around his cock.
Times Square is a war zone, all twisted cars and ruined buildings and shattered infrastructure. You’re ripping through news footage and security feeds while Spider-Woman reads you in, but the damage is too great—too many blindspots for even your many-faceted eye. Luke’s out cold, she tells you. Wolverine is down. And Steve?
Steve slides his hands up Iron Man’s thighs, enjoying Iron Man’s intake of breath. Iron Man’s legs are hairier than Steve’s own. He decides he likes that. Tony probably has a lot of body hair too, given his Italian heritage.
It takes you a moment to process what he’s saying, because the way he’s saying it— Like it’s a deadline, like it’s some kind of ultimatum, rather than a kindness, than one final courtesy…
You’ve taken out Sentry and everything is, for once, unfolding exactly according to plan. You lead the rest of your pursuers on a wild goose chase with a remote-piloted suit of armor (and try not to count how many friends and colleagues have turned out to hunt you down) while you run your hacker to the ground at Wembley Stadium. And there you are, face to face with the man who’s made you a murderer, only it turns out he’s not a man at all but just some kid who’s been pointing you like a gun at his daddy issues, and he’s just telling you about the dead man’s switch he’s implanted in your brain when—
Except that that wasn’t Tony. Of course it wasn’t. It was Iron Man who said that. It’s just that it sounded so much like something Tony would say. Tony’s the one who’s given him so much, after all. Did Iron Man do that on purpose? Or is it just coincidence and crossed wires again?
then that must prove that he’d been drugged after all, and he thought he could cry from the sheer relief of it, and he took a step forward, and—
“Sorry,” Rogers says, “I— Sorry.” He moves back, a little, but he’s still too close, Tony can feel him, the heat and solid presence of him and so damn
The paper is thick and unlined—apparently torn from the pages of one of Steve’s sketchbooks, just as the pen must have been borrowed from his desk. He wonders—smoothing out the creases on the page—where Iron Man learned to use a fountain pen. Maybe it was something he had to pick up, in the course of his work for Tony Stark?
But you can’t both stay here, and if you leave… Such a public concession—a tacit admission of wrongdoing. From a strategic point of view? Unthinkable. To cede Avengers HQ to him, give up the home ground before the battle’s even begun—how could you possibly afford it?
“You want to?” Iron Man echoes. He sounds faintly incredulous, and at the same time—and this can’t be right, but—at the same time, almost wistful.
.” It comes out harsher than Steve intended, but he doesn’t know how to take it back; speech is enough of a struggle as it is.
“You’ve done a lot for me. I’d like to do something for you. I think I’d enjoy that,” Steve adds, cutting off Iron Man’s half-formed protests. “I think you would too.” He licks his lips in what he hopes comes across as invitation rather than nerves. “If you don’t want to, that’s fine, but it’s something I’d really… Yeah.”
Tony had called it. Steve could think of a few choicer words of his own, most of which involved far fewer syllables.
again. Somewhere beneath the layers of heat and noise, Steve is surprised to realize the sounds are coming from his own mouth. He hardly even knows what they mean, only that he can’t stop making them. It’s part compulsion, part imperative.
emblazoned on billboards and buses, the Stark Industries motto marching along the bottom, rendered into blocky Cyrillic type: Меняем мир ради будущего. Changing the world for a better future.
when Steve set him right, that was the thing. And sure, maybe Steve’d been a little short with him, or, okay, maybe more than a little, but you didn’t go around accusing a guy of something like that,
“Though I’m sad I wasn’t there for the start of this, whether it counted or not,” Iron Man continues, voice husky even through the modulator. “It must have been quite the sight.”
Then he sits up straight and puts back his shoulders, features settling into a smile like something out of a toothpaste ad. “Oh, you know,” he says. “A gentleman never tells.” And winks.
You shut your mouth. Let your mind split. It was only out of habit that you remained so long in one place—you are so much more than your body now. One fragment remains in bed, timing the rolling of your hips to Maya’s thrusts, receiving and processing the really very pleasant sensations of heat and pressure around your cock. The rest of you is…
Slowly, Tony turns his head to look at the place where Steve Rogers is holding him, and it’s like seeing with split vision.
For answer, Steve reaches out, clumsily seeking out Iron Man’s hand. Capturing it in both of his, he raises it to his lips, kissing first the back, and then the palm.
He could work out more, he supposes, but the thought of more of those endless, dreary exercises, barely even effectual… He could watch a movie, or—or listen to another of those radio things Tony had told him about—
“My mom was born in Mexico. Typical story. Poor kid makes it big off of some kind of talent, family buys their way to the states, the kid works their ass off and lives a happy life for awhile. My mom was no different. She played the Oboe amazingly.” she stopped to laugh. “Of all things, the Oboe. My abuelo, that’s grandfather, found it in a market for cheap. He cleaned it up as best as he could and gave it to my mom. My mom learned by listening and could mimic any melody she heard. It took her to California when she turned 14. And from there all across the United States to different orchestras. She went back home in her 20’s and she helped the whole neighborhood come up and got married to my dad. He and my mom never really got along because she yearned to travel and he wanted to stay home and monitor the stupid farm. My mom convinced him to give the farm to one of his nephews.They moved to Florida, where I was born when my mom was 26. She and my dad never got over the fact that he lost his farm and a part of himself. They fought and eventually broke up. My mom kept living. We moved all over then. I basically lived out of a damned hotel room or a tour bus, but my mom saw that wasn’t a life for a young kid, so she bought an actual house here when I was 9 and really settled down. She played in the Philharmonic, taught lessons in her spare time to unfortunate kids, did concerts for schools and gave up so much more for me. She met Christopher, Nora’s dad when I was 15. We got along surprisingly well and for the first time in a long time, I felt like I had a real family. I got good grades, stayed out of trouble, graduated and went to Columbia. It was the summer before my junior year.” Marcellina paused for a moment to take a few more drags. Her dark brown eyes settled on the window to the infant room for a moment before she breathed out and leaned back into the hard wood of the bench behind her.
Steve’s next. He leans over the bars and kisses both of her cheeks. Tony grumbles that he’s a showoff. “Goodnight Angel. I love you.” The dads leave the room together, hand in hand, and gently shut her door.
“How in the world did you get these so fast?” Steve asked, reopening the beige file and looking it all over again to be sure he wasn’t wrong. Sam shrugged.
Steve opened his mouth and paused, drawing his lips into a thin line before finally speaking.“I was talking to Sam and I realized I’m not getting any younger.” He said. Tony’s mouth twitched up and his eyes looked up at the ceiling before looking back at Steve. Steve resisted the urge to roll his eyes, because he knew Tony was going to make a wise quip about him being old, but decided against it. 3 years of dating made his body language crystal clear to his partner. “We should have a baby.” Tony flinched visibly, eyes going from wide with surprise, to squinted curiously.
“I don’t know what this was to you,” Steve continues, gathering together the ashes of his anger, fanning them back into flame—anger is good, anger is
Eternal thanks to everyone who helped me through this chapter. It’s been a fucking year I’ve been working on it and I literally cannot remember everyone who answered my sporadic, sobbing pleas for help on Discord, but please know that I love you. Extra special super duper eternal thanks to Fourth-of-Foxes and Antrodemus for truly excellent beta-work; all mistakes, flaws, and imperfections are entirely my own.
Except he can’t imagine that, can he, because that would mean imagining Iron Man’s face, and he doesn’t want that—to dream up some kind of phantom to fill the gaps. Because maybe—just maybe one day Iron Man will take off his helmet, and Steve doesn’t want to look at him in that moment and see only the
“Yeah,” Iron Man agrees, tugging gently on Steve’s testicles as his other hand glides up and down Steve’s shaft. Steve wonders if anything in his life has ever felt this good.
“Because I’m just saying, I may not be a genius myself, but I’ve got one on speed-dial, and I’m sure he—”
Steve opens his mouth to give some appropriately sarcastic reply—“Never better,” or something like that, but the words never leave his throat. Instead, he makes a small, choked sound humiliatingly like a whimper.
Which is silly, really. Drawing is a skill like any other. He learned it once, and he can learn it again. It could be nice, to have something he really has to work at.
Steve wets his lips and reaches for words of reassurance but finds none. He feels one of the tears finally spill from the corner of his eye, darts out his tongue to taste the salt as it trickles down his cheek.
In fact, from a strategic standpoint, Stark was probably the best possible person to be stuck with. Steve had hobnobbed with some big brains in his day—Abraham Erskine had certainly been no slouch in that department—but he’d never seen anything to match Tony. If they really
“It’s not enough,” your mouth cut and bleeding with the truth of it. “It was never going to be enough.”
of his, they’ve never really been what you might call… particular. Gender has never been a factor, for one thing. Good looking guys, good looking gals, it’s all pretty much the same when the need is upon him. If he chose to pass time exclusively with the dames, that was mostly a matter of convenience. He isn’t sure what the army would have done if they found out Captain America was a queer, and an occasional sex maniac at that, but he never thought it worth the trouble of finding out. Not when there were other options available.
Oh, he knew there was information about his friend he didn’t have—things that, sure, a lot of people might find important, like a face or a name or a history. But he’s not ‘a lot of people.’ He had a secret identity himself back during the war; he can understand the need for a little personal compartmentalization. He knows Iron Man is brave and clever and thoughtful and funny and kind. That Iron Man is someone he can trust, on or off the field, someone who will always have his back, someone who
“Hey, what’d I say about overthinking things?” Iron Man says, gently chiding. “My fault, really. We were getting a little off track. Let’s see if…”
Anyway, to hear Wasp tell it, Tony didn’t have much trouble consoling himself for Steve’s absence—consoled himself, by all reports, quite thoroughly with red hair and a hip-to-waist ratio that, if Steve takes Wasp’s gestures at face value, seems biologically unsound.
Flash forward and you’re trying to strip—you’re still mostly dressed, you haven’t even taken your socks off, and what a fucking joke, to have laid waste to your entire life with your jeans around your ankles and your feet encased in an outsized pair of Sal’s hemp fiber and organic cotton socks—but you keep getting sidetracked by your own hands. You can’t see to stop staring at them. These are the hands of someone who could do this. This is the way the tendons arch as they flex.
There is a man who has made himself over a thousand times, standing in a bedroom with his heart in his throat and the future in his hands.
Fabric slides across his cheekbones, his shut eyes and the bridge of his nose. It feels expensive, smooth and cool as water.
“Anyway,” Iron Man is saying, “I’d better leave you to it. Got enough of my own to be getting on with, lucky boy that I am.”
part of you snarls, and for a moment you think you might hate him, for being that honorable, that unthinkingly trusting—for giving you this opening you can’t afford not to take.
So many choices, over the years—so many moments, so many potential turning points. Nothing ever really
“Great,” Steve manages. “J-just need—” He angles his hips, trying for something he can’t quite name.
This, though. The violence of his reaction. It feels like something on a different level entirely, or—
Like it was nothing more than a transaction. Like they were strangers to each other. Strangers, or less than—a stranger, at least, might have been moved by kindness. Compassion sitting in for affection, for genuine care.
He pictures it now, Iron Man’s naked torso, his muscles firm but the flesh overtop tender and untouched, pale as a kept secret. Flecked with pearly scars. A constellation. A history.
He has no words for what he needs. No words at all, only the picture on the screen—only that slick, obscene glide of flesh, in and out, in and out, the smacking impact of bodies and the tinny sound of the blond man’s moans as Tony—God,
It isn’t long before the pounding is joined by a rapid counterpoint, faint but getting louder. Steve lets his head loll onto his shoulder.
The sound of sudden movement from Iron Man’s direction brings Steve’s head jolting down to stare at him.
“Oh, well.” Steve can hear Iron Man shift his weight from one foot to another and then back again. “I can always clean up when I get back to my room.”
Steve, who hasn’t made love to you since Extremis made you new. Steve, whose face twisted, whose head turned aside:
? He needs release, he needs solitude, he needs not to be alone, he needs to know how to fit inside his own skin—
“Jerked off in the bathing room? I thought you’d prefer it to me walking around with…” Tony made a dismissive kind of gesture.
you hear? Not a single, solitary goddamn thing,” and Steve doesn’t understand where it’s all coming from, the anger in his voice, the curdling disgust—
Slowly, Steve sits back in his chair. Beneath the leather of his gloves, his fingers are tingling where Iron Man touched them. He shuts his eyes and passes the offending hand over his face.
That’s what he tells himself in the wake of his first round, except that thinking about how it didn’t mean anything to jack off to Tony means he’s thinking about
The shock of the name sends arousal zinging down Steve’s spine and he whines around Iron Man’s cock.
He pauses behind Steve’s chair. Steve tenses, half-expecting Iron Man to reach out and touch him again, but Iron Man only says, in a voice that somehow manages to be reassuring even when flattened and twisted by the voice modulator, “Safe as houses, Cap,” and moves on to his own seat.
“I’m flattered,” Tony says. “I had no idea you were keeping such a close watch on my comings and goings.”
He tilts his hips this time so Iron Man’s cock hits him at an angle, and there they are, the first bright sparks of pleasure, and not much deeper to go to hit the place inside him that makes the world go molten—
The pain of the air entering your lungs is sharp, lonely and cold, like the keening of wind through desert places, but it no longer threatens to bring you to your knees. You can live with this, or at least, you can learn.
A sudden burst of pleasure rips you back into your body. You are small and limited and human again. Maya is grinding down, squeezing around your cock like she’s trying to milk the orgasm right out of you. You gasp, a strangled sound, and she pulls up again, shoving back the hair that’s fallen into her eyes. Her eyes are bright, face flushed almost dark enough to disguise the red stripe of the wound across her cheek. She is unspeakably beautiful.
“I bet I can guess its expression though.” Steve pulls an expression of ludicrous shock and dismay, nostrils flaring, mouth open with the corners downturned.
“How could I not be?” Iron Man returns lightly. “Here I’ll be, nose back to the grindstone, and there you’ll be…”
He casts a longing glance towards the exit. Thor is already gone. Giant-Man and the Wasp are deep in conversation. As Steve watches, Giant-Man pulls open the door. Wasp’s smile lights up her face like the Rockefeller Centre Christmas tree. She pats him on the cheek and sashays through the doorway, Giant-Man at her heels. The door closes with an audible click.
Tony steps down out of the armor, trying not to feel like he’s losing a major tactical advantage. Rogers isn’t going to attack him—Tony trusts him that far, at least—so firepower is irrelevant. The lost inches in height are— well, Tony’s always favored brains over brawn, and as for Tony’s battle-worn appearance—the creases in his suit, the sweat-rumpled mess of his hair—Rogers isn’t exactly looking funky fresh himself. He seems to have leaned pretty hard into the whole ‘FBI’s most wanted’ aesthetic, actually, though he wears it irritatingly well. That beard is really—
“It’ll only be a little while. Just a few more days, and then I’ll be back.” He has to believe that.
He leans across the table. Steve knows he must look half crazed, but Iron Man doesn’t seem to care, just slides a gauntleted hand across the tabletop so that it rests inches away from Steve’s own.
The first time he comes with Tony’s name on his lips is excusable. He tries, generally speaking, not to fantasize too much about people he knows personally—it’s always seemed somehow like a violation. But it was, after all, Tony who was the unwitting trigger, and the need always comes on him so fast when it first comes, and so it was really only natural, by the time he reached his room, achingly hard, almost trembling with desire, that his few scattered thoughts before he came, shatteringly, over his hand and stomach, were all of Tony.
Steve ducks his head and takes a breath. “I just wanted to say thank you. For—” He shakes his head. “You know I’ve never actually told anyone about this before? I mean, Erskine was dead, and it was such a…” He grimaces. “…a personal thing, and it’s not like anyone thought to ask, so. Thank you.”
A few days. Maybe a week. You’ve checked the logs: Steve hasn’t been back to the tower since your confrontation at the hospital. No doubt he’s avoiding you—which is, you remind yourself as your heart clenches like a fist in your chest, something to be grateful for. A mercy for you both. But if you make it clear that you’ll be elsewhere, well. That should give him time to gather his things. Make his arrangements. As neat a severance as you could hope for.
, at least not anymore, but he doesn’t think Iron Man’s likely to split hairs in this particular situation. He knows Iron Man enjoyed himself last night, in spite of his scruples, and now that Steve is fresh and clear-headed and more than eager, well. What objections could there be?
“Repulsor,” Iron Man says. “Turned it almost all the way down. Not too much?” he adds, with a touch of anxiety.
It’s only when he pauses and sits back to assess his progress that he realizes that the face taking shape beneath his unpracticed pencil—he used to be
“Yeah,” he says, a little more color in his voice. “Yeah, that’s it. You’re doing great.” His spare hand strokes Steve’s flank as Steve draws breath in shallow gasps and blinks away stars.
He needs something… physical, yes, definitely physical, but this is the wrong kind of physical. It’s as if there’s a winch set just between his shoulder blades, slowly winding tighter and tighter. He needs…
say, and for a moment he’s almost pathetically grateful at the way his mind keeps sliding away, drawn like a magnet to images of Tony—Tony, sleek and suave on the cover of a magazine—Tony, lurking in the kitchen at the tail end of some sleepless night, eyes underscored in blue, “Couldn’t sleep either, Cap? Hell of a night for it.”—
“Cap,” he says, and even with his eyes closed he can feel the way Rogers leans in after him, swaying into the sound of Tony’s voice, hungry and yearning.
,” Steve says. The word comes out far too vehement. “I mean, not yet. I…” He looks away, cheeks burning. Here’s Iron Man offering to do this extraordinary thing for him, and Steve can’t even figure out what he
Iron Man is sitting bolt upright, palms flat on the table. “Are you all right?” It’s hard to tell through the vocal distortion, but Steve thinks he sounds a little hoarse. “It’s not— It’s still working, right?”
He thinks of Tony’s hand stroking his brow, of the softness of his voice as he bent to murmur poison into Steve’s ear. If you didn’t listen to the words, it could almost pass for tenderness.
You stood in front of the mirror then too, the night he left. Touched yourself like you’re touching yourself now, smoothing your hand over perfectly engineered muscle—dry, then, and now gleaming with sink water and borrowed sweat. Back then you dragged your fingers across your collarbone, palpating the skin that Steve flinched from, that Maya will never kiss, that she’ll scarcely even touch.
Iron Man makes a long, drawn-out sound, low and guttural. “S-see, I don’t think you’ve been paying them enough attention. I think they must be feeling awfully n-neglected. M-maybe you should go a little harder. Have you tried pinching them? Some people like that. Some people like—”
While searching a local department store for a gift for Bruce’s upcoming birthday, his eyes wandered over to the children’s section. He looked over all of the cute little clothing sets. T shirts, dresses, little pairs of shoes.
“Hi! I’m Alexa. I’m the door girl for right now. You’re…” she paused to look at a slip of paper taped to the edge of the desk. “The Stark’s right?” she asked, head snapping up curiously. The pair looked at each other, then back down. Steve nodded in affirmation and her smile returned. “Okay! It’s my job to take you to Ms. Honey. She’s making lunch. C’mon.” Alexa easily hopped out of the chair and trotted past several doors with a hop in her step. “Ms. Honey! The Starks are here!” Alexa called in a peppy, singsong voice, entering a large kitchen while passing various kids zipping by with toys and a few sitting at the kitchen table. A woman with long brown hair speckled with gray strands, looked up from the stove, holding a spoon in one hand. She turned and smiled, setting the spoon on the counter.
“Yeah, she seems to really like whoever she meets. Hopefully, she’ll calm down soon. She’s kind of on a bender since she normally goes out to play around this time. Do you think you could keep your eye on her for just a second? I’m going to get something for her to do and try and round up Natasha and Tony. Peter nodded, shooting to his feet.
Steve watched her sleep for a moment, mulling the question over in his head as she rose and fell with his breathing. “I don’t think her sister will let her forget. I don’t want her to forget either. Her parents are a vital part of her identity and who she is.” Tony yawned and nodded, cuddling against Steve’s shoulder.
So, they waited. Tony and Steve decided to sit out back on a swinging bench, Steve’s head leaned into Tony’s shoulder.
It was 2 AM when Steve jolted awake to Ellie screaming at the top of her lungs. He quickly pulled the blankets back and
“Tony! We’re ready for you!” Steve calls. The genius is by their side in a moment, still chewing. Steve tucks Ellie into her crib for the first time. He pulls the lavender, mermaid patterned blanket up to her chin and pets her hair.
Ellie copied him and mumbled. “Nariz.” Steve chuckled at her attempt to parrot him, but couldn’t resist the eye roll he felt coming on at Tony.
“What did I miss?” Pepper asked, walking up to them holding a bunch of drinks. “You sent me off to get drinks and I missed all the fun, didn’t I?” The team (minus Peter) cracked open their beers and toasted to Steve and Tony being parents. The couple couldn’t help but give each other a little kiss, which sent Ellie into a whining fit because she didn’t get any kisses. Steve peppered her chubby cheeks in kisses, followed by Tony, who made loud dramatic muah sounds every time his lips smacked against her face, sending her into loud squeals and laughter. Steve watched Tony’s eyes soften as Ellie looked up at him with twinkling gray eyes. Everything was perfect.
“I- well you see...It’s complicated Pete. Excited is not exactly the word I would use for how I’m feeling about it.” Tony stuttered, letting out a breath he didn’t know he was holding. “Steve is excited to be a dad.” Steve was beyond excited. He was elated. Ever since he had received Marcellina’s blessing of sorts, he’d been texting her nonstop to ask her opinion as they built up her wardrobe and toy collection. He was determined to be a good dad, and the impending beach trip and official foster hearing had put him on edge. The star-spangled man with a plan was a star-spangled mess.
“I think it’ll all be okay in the end. I think...we’ll figure it out as we go and that’ll be that. I just... don’t want to repeat the mistakes my father made.” Tony commented. Steve turned his head to plant a kiss among the soft, dark curls on Tony’s head.
“Peter! Can you bring the kid over!” Tony called, waving from underneath the umbrella. He waved back and turned back to the toddler who was still looking for shells.
“I completely forgot. She’s teething.” He mumbled to himself. “Her back teeth are coming in and chewing on the apple must’ve hurt.” Natasha rolled her eyes.
“Being a big brother isn’t so bad!” he exclaimed to her as he used his arms to propel himself through the water. When Ellie got squirmy and bored, they changed activities, and instead started collecting seashells. Ellie excitedly toddled close by, picking up the brightly colored shells and bringing them back to Peter every time she found one. He’d ooh and ahh and tuck it into his pocket for safekeeping.
“I can think about it.” He whispered, enjoyed the soft touch of his husband. Steve quickly pulled him into a hug, causing Tony to squeak, as he mumbled thank you’s into his hair.
“I saw you wiped out pretty hard there kid” Tony stated, chuckling as she walked into his waiting arms.
“It’s fine Pete. She would’ve fallen eventually. It was only a matter of time.” Peter plopped himself down on the towel and stretched out, slightly relieved to have Ellie back with someone else that could be responsible for her. Tony fed her some orange slices, a handful of pistachios (only because she fussed when he wouldn’t share his snack with her), and a half a ham and cheese sandwich before she climbed up onto Natasha’s chair and tried to take her book from her.
She and Peter spent the remainder of the afternoon playing in the waves, building sand castles (more like Peter the building sandcastles and Ellie knocking them over mischievously), collecting more seashells (which Ellie was quick to run over to one of the team and offer them as gifts) and of course, she was covered in sand, small pieces of seaweed and red syrup from where she’d shared a snow cone with Peter. But, it was getting close to time for her to have dinner and get into bed, and he was sure that Peter needed to be home soon.
“You might need this old man.” Tony interrupted, offering her pink backpack. Steve blinked at him for a moment and chuckled as his cheeks pinked visibly.
“No way, she totally wants the red shiny car, right Ellie?” He said, offering the plastic car to the toddler, who looked at them both in confusion for a moment. After a second of mental deliberation, she quickly crawled over to Tony and reached for the red car, gray eyes shining excitedly. Tony smirked triumphantly and gave the toy to her. Steve pouted slightly, setting the ball back down on the floor with a huff of air through his nostrils. Ellie excitedly rolled the toy over the carpet before giving it to Steve, beaming expectantly.
“Dada!” She copied again, smiling so hard they could see both of her dimples. Peter flinched and looked to Natasha for help.
Steve nodded grabbing one of the slices from the stack and taking a bite. “Yes please.” He mumbled around his mouth full of pizza Tony tsked, grinning.
On June 12th, Steve started his day like any other. He took a short run to the park and back, had a hot shower, dressed in a red short-sleeved button up and jeans, made the bed, and cooked a small breakfast of bacon, eggs, and toast. After he washed the dishes, Steve checked his watch. It was only 9:30. They weren’t supposed to leave until 10:45. Steve pursed his lips and went to the couch and went through the bag he’d packed. There were diapers, wipes, a few toys, a pacifier, a tiny jacket, a blanket, and the infamous brown stuffed rabbit. Steve plopped himself on the couch and turned on the tv to entertain himself, setting the bag by the edge of the sofa. Tony came into the main door, still dressed in an expensive suit from a meeting he’d had with Pepper. He kicked his shoes off and sauntered into the kitchen area.
“My father was a marine, so of course I chose to follow his footsteps after I got my degree... I blame myself for the fact that Nora has to be in your care. If I had not been so damned stubborn and just waited. Two weeks after I signed my papers my parents died and now Nora is in this situation.” Her view of the stars blurred as the tears from earlier welled up again. This was the right thing to do. She knew that. It was just...hard to let go.
“I did. I gave her a toy. Per…” he paused as he put her shorts aside and thought for a moment. “One of the child-rearing books I read, it helps keep toddlers still because they like to squirm around.” Tony grunted in acknowledgment, as he watched Steve easily removed the soiled diaper and delicately redressed her. The blonde pulled her up and set her on her feet to adjust her dress. “There. All done.” He stated proudly. Ellie leaned forward and planted a sloppy kiss on Steve’s forehead, making him beam. He cooed at her picking her up and rubbing his nose on hers. “You’re so sweet!” he whispered to her as he peppered her face in kisses, making all her giggle wildly and try and wiggle away.
“Alright. Here, how about…” she got up, setting Ellie on the floor and picking up a few spare toys from around the room. A car, a few soft blocks, and a ball that looked like it had fish swimming on it. “These should be good. If you need me, I’ll be right here.” She said, gesturing to the carpet. The two men slid down onto the plush flooring and looked over the toys in question.
Someone familiar shows up on the front steps of Avenges Tower, leaving Tony and Steve to handle a tense situation and realize the two of them might be more of a target than they realize.
Thanks, guys for the continued support! I decided that for now, we're going to keep it to one chapter per week because school is kicking my ass. I may post another chapter this week because my birthday was Saturday and I had some extra time to get more ahead in my writing. I also just want you guys to know that there are three more works I am in the midst of putting together that are based off this fic that I just can't post yet, including one with a lot of StevexBucky and Peter being a really cute older brother (is that a spoiler?).
“Okay, so, we’re going to the park. Maybe we’ll get ice cream, maybe not. We’ll get lunch for sure. And then...well we have time. We can either come back here or take her back. I wanted her to meet the team, but I don’t know if she’ll be tired, and I don’t want her to be overwhelmed by a whole bunch of new faces, so we can hold that part off if need be.” Steve explained simply,  eyes darting up at the ceiling as he thought, and then back to the hazel pools of Tony’s.
“The medication they gave her this morning must’ve worn off...I’ll go up and get her some more.” Steve mumbled, shuffling over to the elevator. Tony and Bruce sat back down, both looking a bit sheepish.
“How long do you think it will take them to realize she’s not choking?” Clint asked, leaning his head on his hand while he watched the chaos unfold in front of them. Natasha snorted and mumbled something in Russian under her breath.
“So, do you want me to get the door, or do you need a moment?” Tony said pulling him from his thoughts. Steve pinked slightly, chuckled awkwardly, and reached for the handle himself, opening the door with a squeak. The pair entered, coming up to a desk where an older looking girl, maybe 10, sat quietly in a green t-shirt and pigtails with a crayon in one hand, and a marker missing a cap in the other as she doodled on a piece of paper. She looked up to acknowledge them and flashed a friendly smile.
“Yeah,” Iron Man confirms. “You already told me all about your cycle and Mr. Stark. If anything, it’s a compliment to my skill, that you’re already too distracted to filter your thoughts.”
The hands release their grip and begin to move, skimming his flanks, flitting over his chest and biceps.
He’s still breathing hard. His face, he knows, is a wreck, sweat and tears running down to meet the mess on his cheeks.
“It’s a plan, then.” There’s a smile in Iron Man’s voice. “The shoulder massage from before. How was that?”
to tell. It’d never seriously occurred to him before, to confide his secret to someone else. Not before the onset of this terrible cycle.
“That wasn’t an invit— Just. Shut up.” Tony rubs his hands over his face. “So this is a thing. I’m harboring an internationally-wanted fugitive while he waits for his ride to show. That’s just great. Really fantastic.”
He cuts off on an indrawn breath as Steve swipes a finger through the mess on his cheeks and brings it to his mouth.
Even as he's speaking he can see the shape of it all, looming before him out of the darkness of his own ignorance, out of the salt and ashes of his best laid plans
Steve spreads his legs wider and gives Iron Man a plaintive little tug. His eyes beneath the blindfold have begun to tear up.
“…huh,” Iron Man says finally. “Well, that’s good. Right? In general, I mean. I thought it was going to be something much worse. Not to minimize… Just. It sounds like you’ve got things pretty well in hand. Oh. Hell. No pun intended.”
Steve, who you haven’t spoken to in— It must be days, now. Steve, who stood by and said nothing as you remanded yourself to federal custody, who couldn’t even be bothered to come and visit you in your analog prison before the Trojan lurking in your brain executed and broke you out again. Steve, who even now is probably strategizing how to
Except, of course, that it wasn’t a blow. The armor just needed recharging. A small, simple thing, eminently reasonable. It wasn’t that Iron Man
Steve smiles, helplessly, and rolls his head to one side. “Sorry I didn’t… didn’t warn you. I should’ve… I’m sorry.”
There’s a faint chinking sound. Steve looks down to see a crack in the side of his glass, starting just beneath his thumb and radiating down, jagged as a fork of lightning. Looks like he’s got some pent-up energy to work off. What else is new.
Orgasm takes him with a wordless cry, takes him over, a searing pleasure that tightens in his balls and spills through his cock, his release pulsing hot over Iron Man’s hand and Steve’s own chest. His rhythm falters; it’s all he can do to keep from collapsing, but it doesn’t seem to matter, because he can feel himself squeezing down around Iron Man’s cock and Iron Man is shouting and thrusting up and then he, too, is coming, warm and wet and perfect, buried deep inside.
so gorgeous and so good, how is this even happening, can barely believe I’m awake that’s how good you are, just like that, so gorgeous, you’re like a dream—”
Thanks to cptxrogers for cheerreading and wynnesome for betaing, both on very short notice! Y'all're rockstars. I did a bunch of rewriting before posting, so any errors are most certainly my own.
“That’s not the issue here,” Iron Man says, a little sharply. “This is about you. Do you still want… what you were saying over the phone?”
His gaze is intent on yours, his expression unreadable. “Give me time to pack my bags, is that it? How long do I have? A week? Less?”
“Everything you ask for, anything you need, I want to give it to you, I want you to have it, have it, take it, god,
You, too, have been dreaming of war. The difference is that when he dreams, his nightmares are all of the past, whereas you—you dream of battles yet to come. These days, when you close your eyes, your enemy wears only one face.
the whole thing was just a joke—ill-considered, sure, but it did seem like the sort of thing Tony Stark might find funny.
“You should feel good,” Iron Man says, voice hoarse but ringing with conviction, like he's stating one of the fundamental truths of the universe. “You deserve to feel good everywhere, in every way a person can.”
—” His voice goes weirdly fervent on the last word, in a way that jolts right to Steve’s cock, but all Steve can picture is the darkness of Tony’s eyes, the ruddy flush staining his cheeks, the desire writ plain in every slack line of his face.
Steve shuts his eyes. Lets his arms fall limp. What’s the point in pretending? He’s not going anywhere.
He feels the touch of something cold, an echo of that earlier desolation. Surely there’s no way— He can’t have been reading things that wrong this whole time, thinking Iron Man didn’t mind, thinking maybe he even wanted it, being there with Steve—that was real, wasn’t it? He’d scarcely even thought to doubt—
Outside, footsteps grow louder and then quieter again. There’s the sound of a door opening, then a door closing.
But this time, far from filling Steve with frustration, the words sweep over him in a wave of heat, lighting prickling fires beneath his skin. It’s not just the meaning behind the words, though that too has changed—permission, now, when before it felt only like denial. It’s the way Iron Man is saying it, like he’s desperate for it, like the very idea of Steve taking his pleasure in that way has him on the verge of coming apart.
“Oh,” Steve says, feeling vaguely ashamed. “That’s right. No touching your face, you said. I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have asked.”
Tony’s face, which is still currently making sad-puppy “why are you eating all the bacon” eyes at Steve, undergoes an interesting transformation. His gaze drops, then darts back to Steve, lightning fast, a flush blooming slowly in his cheeks. His teeth drag over his bottom lip, color flooding in their wake.
Tony, with his movie-star good looks and those ravines he has in place of cheeks, Tony with the charm in his smile and the warmth in his manner, with those clever hands and cleverer wit and the shadow in his eyes hinting that there was so much more to him than he ever let anyone see.
You choke on a laugh, because yes, you love him, holy Christ, you love him, love him so much some days you can hardly breathe with it, like it’s too big for your body, like your beating heart could burst right through your skin, and—
“The Care Bear Squad didn’t have anything like this when they attacked me today,” he says, but his tongue feels thick and clumsy in his mouth.
“I guess I just forgot,” he says, slow, like he’s answering a question. “The way you do that. Just…” He spreads his hands, taking in Tony, the coffee table, the tools, the holodisplay. “Make it all yours. Make it into your world.”
Rogers may have abandoned his shield, but apparently he doesn’t need it, at least judging by the way Tony’s words ricochet back at him, striking him square in the chest, right where the arc reactor once lived.
Steve can’t hold back the full-body shudder of relief. He yanks the shirt over his head and tosses it heedlessly onto the floor.
(A thought could have you back in the Tower. No one would ever know. You were the one who designed the security after all.
There are a lot of things Steve likes about the twenty first century. There are a lot of things he misses.
His hand flies to his lips. “Jesus.” He takes a few aimless, stumbling steps and catches himself against the edge of the desk.
Steve shivered with the absurdity of it. Imagine, making up a thing like that. God only knew what else was churning away in that degenerate brain of his. All the sins of Sodom and Gomorroh, perversions Steve couldn’t even begin to imagine—
“Hey. Good to see you made it to out from the lab.” Steve teased, swirling the brush through a cup of dirty paint water and sitting back and stretching his arms as his bright blue eyes took him in. Tony sat down next to him and eyed the work he’d done. Each unicorn was a little different than the last, with different eye and mane colors, and they all seemed to vary in size. He gestured to it.
Tony set a cup of juice down in front of her and nodded in the direction of the hall. “Want me to go start the bath?”
“Yeah, that might be a good idea.” The spindly teenager was off before she even finished her sentence, running as quickly as his feet could carry him across the warm afternoon sand. Natasha looked down at the girl in her arms and chuckled, setting her book down and turning her to sit on her lap. “Did you say dada? Are you feeling talkative?” she whispered, smiling down at her. Ellie blubbered into a string of giggles, turning in Natasha’s grasp as the guys ran sprinted over, all of them wide-eyed and flushed from the summer sun.
“Maybe I am being a little too uptight.” He replied, cheeks pinking as Tony nudged him playfully. The engineer carried his plate over to the sink, chugged the last bit of his coffee, and eyed the time on his watch before turning to his lover.
“What if that was her first word?” Tony guessed. Steve looked at him eyes growing wider at the possibility.
“Well, what about you?” Pepper inquired, tilting her head a bit. Her well manicured nails rapped against the glass of her cup, making light tinkling sounds, almost like bells as she adjusted the way she was sitting across from him. Tony shrugged a bit as he swallowed.
Thanks for reading another chapter! We're getting close to the good stuff, and then I can start adding in more characters. However, it'll be a couple more before Peter, and a bit before Bucky. I finally got around to making a tumblr that was marvel themed! Yay! Because of that, I have chosen to add little chapter additions that will only be on my tumblr. They won't be imperative to the story, it'll be more like a little post-credit scene of extra fluff or something, that way you don't have to read it if you don't want to. The tag I'm going to use for information about the story (I'm going to be posting a whole timeline and explaining the stories I've chosen to write that will eventually branch out from this one) as well as these little postcredit scene-esque additions will be #hmhthecall in case you miss an excerpt and it ends up lost in stuff I'm reblogging.
“Nope. I’m not sharing.” He huffed, a protective hand settling around her stomach. Ellie looked back at him in confusion.
The smile is back in Iron Man’s voice, but there’s something else there too, that twisty, half-ironic edge that has been appearing more and more frequently over the past two weeks. Something’s off here, and Steve knows he should put a stop to this until he can find out what it is, but he’s so terribly selfish in his need. All he wants is Iron Man’s hands back on him and—
With his eyes shut tight, Steve has no way of knowing what he looks like, but judging by Iron Man’s hissing intake of breath, he must be quite a sight. Well. He can be self-conscious later; right now, he just needs—
He feels a faint stirring of interest in his nether regions, and files the thought away for later examination.
Iron Man gazes back expectantly. The New Yorker in Steve does the answering with a few expressive flicks of the wrist.
He stares down into his lap, kneading the palm of one hand with the fingers of the other. Iron Man says nothing, only waits for Steve to continue.
he should be beyond embarrassment by now. “I know. But Rostro, he said— Called you ‘Tony Stark’s wind-up toy’ and I—”
“Sure,” Iron Man says. The habitual cheer in his voice sounds a little forced. “Let me know when you’ve worked out the kinks.”
Steve’s eyes flick down to the bottom of the note. Iron Man has scribbled something there—presumably his initials. But from the careless way he’s written his letters, the M a collection of loose bisecting strokes practically on top of the I, it could almost as easily be a row of Xs. That’s a shorthand Steve remembers from his own day—kisses enclosed for a sweetheart, far across the sea.
“Promise me,” Steve says. Almost unbidden, his hand on the table scoots an inch or too closer to Iron Man’s.
And now he might lose that, all due to an out-of-control side-effect of the very procedure that had let him earn his place here in the first place. That wasn’t a choice. It might be a joke, if Steve could bring himself to laugh about it.
But then, would that really be so bad? Iron Man is his friend, after all—someone Steve can trust. He may not know much about the man beneath the mask, but he knows that much—knows too that whatever else he looks like, the man beneath the mask is tall, and has piercing blue eyes, which is… which is very…
Iron Man hesitates a moment before clasping it and pulling Steve upright. They stay linked like that for a moment, hand in gauntleted hand as Iron Man’s eyes flicker restlessly over Steve’s face and body.
Iron Man’s voice is softer now, as if thinking out loud to himself. “But where else could he—?” And then, with a throb of worry: “Oh god, I didn’t lose him on the way?”
“Three—” and Steve squeezes hard just as something presses upwards into the stretch of skin behind his balls and his world falls apart in a burst of pleasure that sets the sky ablaze.
Probably not couldn’t. Iron Man must be able to shower somehow. He certainly didn’t smell like someone for whom hygiene was an issue. He smelled… nice. Really nice, actually, now Steve comes to think of it.
“Just like that,” Iron Man praises, as his finger circles round and presses in again, a gentle but unmistakable intrusion. “All coming back to you now?” There’s something in his voice that’s more than an idle question, but Steve doesn’t know what to do with that—can’t
He tosses the book onto a side table and rakes his fingers through his hair. Enough reading for now. He’ll just find something else to pass the time. Something like…
God, this is hard for him—so agonizingly, unbearably hard. You’ve seen this man deliver impromptu speeches that could rally an army on the brink of desertion, and here he is, sputtering out false starts like they’re being cut out of him, like every word has a price paid in blood. He’s torturing himself, trying to make things right between you, and there’s no
He reaches for the nightstand, scrabbling one-handed for his cell phone. He can feel himself clenching tighter around his finger as he moves, and bites down against the soft, desperate sounds that keep working their way out of his throat.
“It’s Natasha’s source. Not mine. I couldn’t tell you, even if I—” With rare tact, he cuts himself short.
He’s just about to yank his arm away when he hears a soft, wordless sound and looks up and sees Rogers’ face.
He gets kind of into it, the cooking. Roasted chicken breast with mashed potatoes and broccoli on the side. It’s not… strictly necessary, sure, but it’s healthy, and a nice distraction, and even if spending that long in the kitchen
Steve is sitting by the side of the bed. His mouth is thin and tight, his posture hunched. He’s still wearing his uniform. You wonder distantly how long he’s been there. Then you remember that you’ve got actual superpowers now, and you reach out with your mind and call up your medical records. You’ve been out for eleven hours. Apparently it took thirty-seven minutes of continuous CPR to restart your heart.
—the burn and the stretch, the slow cramming of foreign heat into his empty places. Has he ever been this empty; has he ever taken it upon himself to be full, and the answer is no, of course, no.
“Yeah, I’ll take you out on a big boat. How does that sound?” Tony added, patting her back. Ellie continued to frown and leaned her head on Steve’s shoulder and popping her thumb into her mouth. “It’ll be great kid.”
“Steve, you do know Tony would do anything for you, right? And I mean anything. The man adores you. He’d find a way to watch the kid if both of you were gone. Plus you’ve got a whole team of people. We rarely all get called out together.” Sam offered, taking another long gulp of water. After a second of silence as the world awoke around them, he set his water bottle down and stretched his legs. “Look Steve. We only get so long in this life to do what we want with those we love. I think...the two of you could be damn good parents, and if that’s your dream, why not go after it? At least think about it man.” Steve leaned back into the bench and sighed.
out of the bedroom, startling Tony as well. Ellie was standing in her crib, holding onto the bars and her rabbit as she sobbed. Her cheeks were glistening in the dim light of the rabbit-shaped night light on her dresser.
“Fine. We’ll alternate. It’s your turn next time.” Steve said simply, scooching past Tony and walking into the nursery. Thankfully, Steve had thought ahead and purchased a changing table, which he had customized with little prancing unicorns around the base. “I’m gonna change your little tush, and then we’ll have lunch and you can meet some of our friends.” Steve singsonged at her, tickling her tummy. Ellie squirmed in his hold, eyes twinkling with happiness.
“It’s been nothing but smooth sailing. She hasn’t cried even once. She even took a nap without a fuss, we didn’t even do anything but sit her in the car. She’s an angel.” He bragged. Bruce looked at him skeptically taking a bite of his grilled cheese sandwich, still holding her little hand in his.
“We could plan something in case of an emergency. Other than shield missions, I don’t do much. I could watch the baby most of the time. And if I get called out Natasha loves kids. And Clint has plenty of experience. We can figure it out, together. Just...can you think about it? Please?” Steve asked, giving him a pleading look as he used his thumb to caress Tony’s rough palm. Tony could not say no to that look. He crumbled under the pressure and huffed.
“Tony Stark.” he declared. They shook hands, staring each other down as if in some sort of competition.  “This is my partn-”
“Thanks babe. You got up pretty early huh?” Tony asked, standing on his tiptoes to grab a mug. He put in a k cup and started the machine. Steve leaned against the arm of the couch
“Language. We’re in the company of” he paused to turn his face back to Ellie and smiled again, “The cutest little angel I’ve ever met in my whole entire life!” Steve tossed her up again for good measure, catching her securely in his hands. Ellie’s laughter slowly died down as Steve rubbed her back, blue eyes shining affectionately. Tony yawned loudly, ruining the moment and Steve couldn’t help but roll his eyes.
“I thought you’d never say it.” Steve rasped. Tony looked up and smiled slightly when he noticed Steve actually crying. He sits up and pulls Steve into a tighter hug. They stay like that until the sun comes up.
“I’m...thinking about it.” Tony said. Steve stiffened visibly. “That does mean we’d have to consider a lot of things. Having a baby in the tower means a lot more than a toddler or an older kid. It means baby proofing, cribs, diapers...all of that. It’s a daunting task.”
Tony waved him off. “Ellie is the most even-tempered kid I’ve ever seen. I’ve never even seen her cry.” Clint rolled his eyes, already annoyed with him. Steve sets the plate down on the table and held his hands out.
“You gonna...look at those some time in this millenia?” Sam teased, a playful smile blooming on his face.
Tony nods his head back to their bedroom. “Let’s go back to bed. We can just put her back in the crib once she’s asleep.” Steve nods in agreement and follows Tony back to their bed. The couple climb in and snuggle up under the minky, soft blankets. Ellie nuzzles into Steve’s chest and cuddles her rabbit in one of her arms.
Right now, Steve reads tension in Iron Man’s clasped hands, his upright posture, the subtle tilt of his head. By the looks of it, Iron Man is almost as eager for this meeting to be over as Steve is himself.
“You think you’ve been drugged?” Tony said, and his voice was so careful, as though he was afraid Steve might break if he said the wrong thing.
He snorts and releases Steve’s chin—withdraws his hand, wiping his fingers on the taut-stretched skin of Steve’s cheek.
“Right. Yeah, just let me… uh,” except you can’t actually think of what else you might need to do, so you gather your clothes, tug the towel more tightly around your hips, and open the door.
Except there’s your answer right there, baked into the question, because this is Steve Rogers, and he never gives up, and he never, ever lets go.
(yeah i had to change the projected length sorry not sorry but also kinda sorry. honestly if this happens again i'm going to start running out of chapter titles. but at least next chapter featuring the long-awaited return of Tony Stark? sure been a while since we've seen him, huh? wonder what he's been up to? probably something relaxing. i bet he's doing great 😎)
,” and his hands are still in motion, wandering, trembling and erratic, across Steve’s abs, his thighs, down the curve of his back, like Iron Man is desperate to touch Steve but can’t settle on how, like he’s trying to touch him everywhere at once. His words are coming faster now, earnest and clumsy. “Just take it, what you want, whatever you want.”
It even has the virtue of being true, although ‘ideas’ might at this stage be a generous description.
in the back of his brain, the slow grind of pistons starting up as whatever gear was knocked loose at the first sight of Rogers, battle-stained and entirely out of context in Tony’s hotel suite, clicks wearily back into place.
He lets his hands roam over his own chest and imagines it’s Iron Man’s he’s touching. Imagines the way Iron Man would gasp and quiver and moan. At being touched. At being
. It’s an almost surreal kind of pleasure, like he’s being massaged by beams of midsummer sunlight. He lets his eyes flutter shut and imagines himself
Or, no, probably he wouldn’t have. But Iron Man certainly doesn’t smell like someone who hasn’t washed his chest in months. Anyway, no one could wear something like that all the time, large and inflexible as it is—no matter how well-fitted, it would chafe beyond bearing—
Steve makes a clumsy attempt to catch at Iron Man’s hand. The fact that he succeeds is, he suspects, as much due to Iron Man humoring him as to Steve’s own efforts. He brings Iron Man’s hand to his lips, rests the back of it on his cheek. A shiver goes through him. Iron Man’s
The silence between you pulls long and thick as you turn away. You place your hands on the bedpost, fingers laced, and rock on the balls of your feet, let yourself lean until your knuckles go white with the pressure.
“Well, yeah he’s going to be your dad.” Peter quickly corrected, “But I’m not sure what you’re supposed to call them.” Ellie grinned back, wiggling out of Natasha’s hold so she could brace her legs against the woman’s strong though and stand up.
“You really need to start sleeping more.” Steve chided, leaning his head into the downy mess of Tony’s hair. He just mumbled something quietly and dozed off. When they arrived, Steve tapped Tony to wake him up. The loving couple headed straight in. The desk clerk handed them a sign-out sheet to fill out, and once it was completed, she paged Olivia, who carried a rather upset looking Ellie out on her hip. The young blonde smiled sadly.
“I just looked into something I thought you might appreciate.” Sam pointed out. Oddly enough, Steve went for the unknown file, out of pure curiosity. Opening it slowly, he skimmed quickly over the first page of information, his azure eyes shooting up quickly to eye his friend before darting back down to the papers in his hands. He had to clear his throat before he spoke.
“Alright. I’ll be right back.” And with that, she disappeared quickly out of one of the doors. Tony looked at Steve in confusion as he sat down next to him.
“Thanks. We’ll see you tonight.” Tony replied, nodding and heading out after his boyfriend. Ellie leaned her head on Steve’s shoulder, still looking exhausted and irritated. Tony frowned a bit as the two of them closed in on the car.
“One of the thing’s I’ve always dreamed about, was having kids and a little family of my own.” Steve said simply. Sam raised his eyebrows curiously.
“Steve really wants to. He’s been totally spaced out, just thinking about it. He even bought the nonexistent kid a toy already.” Tony answered, enjoying the cool spring breeze against his neck from the open window. He took a long sip as he smiled fondly to himself, thinking of Steve sitting on the bed with that rabbit in his hands and the dreamy gleam in his soft blue eyes.
On the way home, the team dropped Peter off (to Ellie’s dismay) and picked up pizza for dinner (to Steve’s dismay). Sam and Clint helped unpack the van and carry everything upstairs, while Tony got Ellie upstairs. She whined the whole way, pausing every now and again to tiredly fist her eyes or let out a yawn. Tony ran his hand up and down her back, shushing her as they rode the elevator up to his and Steve’s floor, but it didn’t manage to do anything for her fussiness. He carried her into their kitchen and grabbed a small plate, fork, and a sippie cup.
“Papa” she repeated casually, looking between them as she waited for a response. Sam cocked a brow at her.
“Baf.” Ellie echoes, raising her arms. Steve scoops her out of the high chair and carries her to the bathroom. Steve bathed her among melon scented bubbles, making sure to get the sand and seawater residue out of her hair, and the crimson pizza sauce off her cheeks. He lets her play with toys as he rinses her off with the shower head.
It had been a few days since they’d met, but Steve could not keep Ellie off of his mind, to the point where it kept him up at night. It was 12 AM. He couldn’t sleep and Tony was down in the lab tinkering with Bruce on god knows what, and no amount of tossing and turning was putting him in the mood to drift off. Steve climbed out of bed. He slipped his slippers on and headed straight for the nursery.
“Why two?” Steve questioned, furrowing his eyebrows in confusion as he takes another bite of his post run breakfast.
Of all of the various fights and wars Steve had been a part of, never in his life was he as nerve-wracked as he was at this very moment. As they drove, Steve changed the radio station 6 times, sucked in deep breaths and held them for way too long 4 times, tapped his fingers on the wheel each time they were stopped by a light, and checked his watch 9 times (and yes, Tony was counting). Steve got out of the car first, nearly vibrating with anxiety. He visibly flinched with Tony shut his door and the shorter man rolled his eyes with a small smile on his face.
Natasha sarcastically raised her eyebrows and she smirked when Ellie politely reached out to her. “Ellie would like you to share.” She demurred, gently taking the toddler from his arms before he could protest, leaving Tony to pout. Steve busied himself, taking a sandwich from the table, removing the crust, and taking out an apple from the fruit bowl on the counter. He sliced both into tiny pieces and carried the plastic plate over to the table as Natasha smoothed Ellie’s brown hair and affectionately smiled at her. Ellie stared curiously at Steve watching him bustle around the kitchen. “Do you see Steve? He’s fixing you a snack!” Natasha pointed out in a high pitched voice as she bounced her on her knee. “That’s Clint, and this is Bruce.” The toddler’s gray eyes scanned them as Natasha pointed red, well-manicured nails at the two men. Bruce gently reached out to take one of her chubby hands and she babbled at him and giggled.
“We were so happy. And damn surprised. My mom was in her 40’s. Sure, Chris was only 37, but never did any of us imagine they’d have a kid. But there she was. 6 pounds of fury. She came out screaming her head off and kicking, almost like she wanted to make up for 8 months of silence. Chris was upset he didn’t get to be there, but he never put her down when he got home. He adored Nora. He and mom both. They agreed to raise her catholic for mom’s sake, and bilingual, also for mom’s sake. She gets that passive, go with the flow mentality from Chris. She was an easy baby. It only took her a month to sleep through the night. She ate well and was always nothing but smiles and so cuddly. She loved to cuddle and watch soaps with mom. “ She smiled fondly and tilted her head to look up at the stars.
Steve felt Ellie suddenly flinch in his lap and looked down at her in confusion. “What’s up little one?” he asked quietly. She sniffled, gray eyes filling with tears. Tony looked at her with wide eyes.
Strawberry Fields Adoption Agency was a small, homey building in upper New York. As they stood in front of the pale yellow door, Steve adjusted his blue flannel button up and took some more deep breaths. Outside there were colorful flowers blooming along the foundation, a few kids toys scattered along the front yard, bikes lined up against a fence, and chalk doodles decorating the concrete in various pastel colors, making it very obvious that quite a few kids of various ages shared the home.
“What do you know.” Steve all but whispered. Tony laughed quietly, pushing his feet against the concrete to propel the bench backward. The crickets chirped nearby as a cool breeze blew over them.
“Light, right.” Quickly, Peter handed over the flashlight. Tony clicked it on and looked inside the suit, sighing when he noticed the issue.
“Yeah, you have to say hi to Peter, look.” Steve pointed at the couch where the teen was lounging. He quickly sat up, slid off the couch, and leaned his back into it to get down to her size. She quickly waddled up to him, grinning widely. “Say, hi Peter!” Her gray eyes locked with his and she beamed,  awkwardly falling into his arms and wrapping her arms around his neck.
“That’s not how you do the Heimlich on a baby you have to pat their backs!” Tony argued, patting her back a bit harder, sending Ellie into confused wails as she held her cheek.
“One for Tony and you. Plus, a certification from an adoption panel.” Sam grinned smugly as Steve gaped at him, eyes wide. “All you have to do is find your little match, do some visitation with a social worker and foster for a little while, and then you can legally file to be official parents.”
“Yeah right, one shitty diaper and you’d be throwing up and wanting to back out.” Tony teased, deflating his young mentor. Peter huffed and stood up, pouting at Tony.
“Well, I don’t want to ruin the surprise. Ah, here they are now.” Just then, Ms. Honey and a tall woman in a black military jacket, white dress pants, perfectly shined black shoes, with her hair perfectly slicked back into a bun and sharp brown eyes rounded the corner. Ellie instantly bolted over, beaming even wider.
“Alright, love birds. I’m going to get a cavity if I keep looking at all this sappy snuggling. Let’s eat.” Steve rolled his eyes.
“I think it’s good” Peter mumbled, head low as he looked at the tiny screws around the heating coil. Tony looked over, turning the desk chair in his direction.
Steve sat Ellie down on a pink towel and began doing his best to brush the loose sand from her skin. “No, thank you for keeping her entertained. I appreciate it.” He shot a wink at the teen, who giddily, skipped off to gather his belongings. “Now for you Missy. Did you have fun with Peter?” he asked as he began stripping her of her damp swimsuit and swim diaper. Ellie squirmed, happy to be naked as Steve did his best to wipe the sand and syrup off of her skin with baby wipes. He redressed her in a pink bow tie tank top and tiny jean shorts and did his best to pull her sandy curls up into a high ponytail as she wiggled and fussed. “El, what’s wrong?” she whined at him and reached out.
Tony nodded his head in understanding as the pair took a couple seconds to look over to Ellie’s crib. The toddler was completely tuckered out and lying on her stomach with her face tilted awkwardly to the side. Her red blanket had begun to wrap around her legs, and surely enough, the brown bunny was tucked into the crook of her arm. Steve tiptoed over, unwound her from her blanket confides and re-tucked her in. Both he and Tony left as quietly as they could, but not without placing a goodbye kiss on her forehead.
“Alright Nat, hand over the kid. I have to hear this for myself.” Tony demanded, holding his hands out. Natasha rolled her eyes and gently handed Ellie over. The guys crowded around him, all blinking at her expectantly.
“Are you excited to be a dad?” He asked, leaning against the workbench as he faced his mentor’s back. Tony froze, caught off guard by the random question.
“They’re going to scare the shit out of her if they don’t stop.” She grumbled, standing to her feet and sauntering over to easily pluck the toddler from their grasp. Ellie continued wailing, snuggling her damp, beet red face into the safety of Natasha’s neck. “She’s not choking.” She declared, rubbing Ellie’s back in soothing circles and bouncing her gently. “She must’ve bitten down on something hard. She’s holding her cheek for God’s sake.” Three pairs of eyes blinked at her in recognition. She turned so they could get a glimpse and surely enough, her tiny hand was still pressed against her chubby cheek. Steve sighed hard and ran a hand down his face.
Marcellina heaved a sigh. “I know it is. I hate that I can’t be the one to give it to her, because I’m stubborn. I have to be gone for the next six months, down in Quantico. I know that the foster parent decision will be made long before those 6 months are up, so I do ask that you send me pictures at least.” She handed over a card with her name and number printed in simple black ink on a pale pink background. Quickly, she checked her watch and stood to her feet. “I have to head out if I want to make it to my plane on time. Can I also ask...that you allow Ellie to use her spanish more? Maybe you guys have a friend or something who could help her practice, but my mom wanted her to be bilingual.” Marcellina physically bit her lip in apprehension as she looked between the couple. Steve stammered. He couldn’t think of anyone he knew that spoke a lick of spanish. Russian? Yeah. Italian. Yes. Spanish? Not one. Tony nodded.
“Of course Mr. Stark.” The teen replied, scurrying off to dig through one of the storage cabinets nearby. Tony sipped coffee from a SI mug and turned his chair around so he could pull some plans up on his hologram screen.
“Damn, you even had time to sit down and stare off into space.” He chuckled and took a deep breath before uncapping a bottle of water and taking a long sip. “What’s got you all serious?” Steve leaned back and straightened his legs, flexing his calf’s to relieve the growing, post run tension.
“Whatcha got there Steve?” Tony questioned as he sat on the bed and peered over his shoulder. “Need a teddy bear to sleep now?”
“Woah, Woah kid, she’s about to cry Steve.” he rushed out, reaching over and opening his arms for her. Steve stood up, also looking panicked as he handed her to him. Tony patted her back as the tears finally spilled over and ran down her cheeks.
Steve eyed the two files sitting plainly on the wooden table at his favorite diner. He picked at a piece of bacon on his plate, tearing a piece off between his teeth, chewing slowly before letting out a small breath. Across from him, Sam sipped coffee from a red mug and cocked a brow at his best friend, before nudging the envelopes closer to Steve.
“Hey, no worries. Like I said, if your cycle’s giving you trouble, I’m happy to lend a hand.” His voice is warm and light, like he’s making a joke, but that’s—that’s not
Iron Man makes a glad sound deep in his throat and sucks hard and determined, hard enough to pull Steve’s climax right out of him. He doesn’t even have time for a warning before he’s coming in hot pulses down Iron Man’s throat.
“Politicians, shareholders, the public. Yesterday a woman came up to me in the street, can you imagine? Telling me some sob story about her son, about how he’s paralyzed, about how Extremis is the only thing that can fix it, about how she should get for free what everyone else has to pay for.”
He moves behind Steve and crouches down at his side. Puts their faces together and holds out his phone, the camera open and switched to selfie mode. Steve sees Tony—the impossible, inhuman perfection of his features—and an old man. A few decades younger than he usually looks these days—early 60s, maybe—but still with face weathered, lined and unlovely.
There’s a faint crunching sound. Tony glances down at his hands, still safely encased in his gauntlets, and realizes they’re gripping the arms of the chair so hard that the wood has begun to splinter.
God, when was the last time he’d picked up a pencil? Could it really have been all the way back before Rebirth? He can’t remember drawing after that, although he knows he’d thought about it sometimes, in the very worst nights of the war—retiring the shield, going back to art school, when everything was over and Captain America was no longer needed.
The realization of Steve’s vulnerability seems to hit them both at the same time. Steve lets out a choked little sound of need, just as Iron Man asks, with some anxiety, “That okay?”
Your brain is a mess of signals, fight and flight both blaring at once. You can feel the undersuit readying to push its way up through your skin. You suppress the instinct—this isn’t that kind of fight, but god, it
He pulls away, pulls out of Steve and every nerve in Steve’s body screams in protest. Steve reaches out, blindly.
The tiled walls take his groan and echo it back to him, full and reverberant, shuddering down to the bone.
Another half beat—and is Steve wrong in reading hesitation there?—before Iron Man replies. “Of course.”
Besides, he hates to think what Wasp might say if she caught a glimpse at his attempts to capture her most recent costume. Probably she would laugh. Hopefully she would laugh. Wasp laughing is really the best-case scenario here.
Tonight, the effects feel different. Weaker. Steve barely has time to shudder through the unnatural feeling of change before that feeling is gone. He feels haler, a little, but his joints are still aching.
Rogers dips his head, then glances back up at Tony with the sort of wry look on his face that would, in a fairer world, be illegal. “Just one?”
He twitches his shoulders and rubs a hand over his face. “It’s— Usual channels, I suppose. I haven’t really looked into it. It’s not like they’re packing anything worth writing home about. A few military grade guns. IEDs. If you set aside the domestic and international terrorism it’s kind of below my paygrade, to be honest. Why—you got a lead on their supplier or something?”
Steve’s stomach clenches. There’s a forceful quality to the words, and he isn’t quite sure how to take them, on the back of that strange, charged silence. Is Iron Man relieved on Steve’s behalf, or his own?
“That’s a little nicer, isn’t it,” Iron Man is saying, and Steve forces himself to smile, as if he wouldn’t have let Iron Man stuff his head into a burlap sack if that’s what it took.
Maya just shrugs. “I needed it. Seemed like you needed it too. And honestly,” and here her face twists; you watch her wince as it pulls at the wound in her face, “I figured, what does it matter? I’m a wanted felon. You’re an international fugitive. I had a life, you know? Before? I had friends, but I sure as hell don’t see any of them here now. Don’t see that
“Hey.” The mattress dips beneath new weight; a hand curls across the top of Steve’s knee, rough and warm and unspeakably
“Stop that,” Iron Man says, nudging him in the chest with an outstretched toe. “I’m trying to apologize here—”
It’s two months ago. You have seen the future, its ugly, sneering face, and the future has beaten the ever-loving shit out of you.
Steve has raised his own hand in unconscious sympathy; now he shudders, feeling his own breath across his knuckles, the promise contained within dampness and heat, while in his mind…
.” Now Iron Man’s the one tugging Steve closer. “Look. The whole point of this is to help you feel good, yeah?”
