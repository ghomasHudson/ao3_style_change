The two dirty cops walked away quickly, leaving Tony alone with his kidnapper.
. He was dating one of the most powerful crime bosses alive.
This is the end of Part I. I have chapters 5 and 6 written, so I should still update next Monday. I'm thinking this story will be between 8-10 chapters.
But for now, I hope you enjoy :)
Also, I just wanted to say thank you SO MUCH to everyone who has given kudos, followed, or commented on this story. Seriously, it helps me keep writing and encourages me to finish this (which I will!)
Once Tony woke up in the hospital, Steve struggled keeping his hands to himself. Half of the time, he wanted to lightly run his lips along every bruise, scar, and stitch so that Tony knew he was still beautiful. So that he knew Steve still wanted him,
Then everything went black.

Steve only hesitated for another moment before leaning down to kiss Tony squarely on the mouth. “I’m going to hold you to that. Please, please don’t leave the house. Please wait for me.”

As much as Steve hated to admit it, he had a point. Before he could try to find another reason to object, Bucky spoke again. “I’ve already talked to Nat, she and Sam will come over at seven when you and I have to leave, then Bruce and Clint will come over around noon. Then you’ll be home to take care of him.”
“Oh shit, Steve, you’re bleeding!”
Tony jerked awake just in time to make his stop, pushing his way past the throngs of students and passerby’s. The faint stench of dried up whiskey hung in the alley as he climbed the metal staircase to his apartment, bringing back unwanted memories. He forced them down, swallowing down the conditioned fear that accompanied that smell.
The man’s eyes traveled to Tony’s basket, and he jutted his chin towards it. “I see you’re stocking up.”
Thor’s booming laugh was surprising enough that Tony almost scrambled out of his seat. “The good doctor is right, Man of Iron. The Avengers are in good hands, you both have done a fine job looking out for them. It is time to retire.”
That was
Natasha smirked and leaned back in her chair. “Guess it’s time to live up to your promise, Captain.”

told everyone that he wouldn’t tolerate another interruption. “Sam, you start.”
Tony preened, just slightly. “Yeah, I’m a TA in the Engineering department at MIT. Working on getting my third doctorate right now.”
“Harley?”
Steve paused before answering, trying to decipher what his gut instinct was telling him. Tony might be young, but seven years truly wasn’t that big of a difference. Considering his growing feelings were

After all, the only time Tony had gotten a real reaction out of the mob boss, whether it be desire or anger, was when he flaunted his body, dangling it right in front of Rogers and then snatching it away, and yet he still hadn’t attempted to take what was not offered. His safety was one variable Tony couldn’t risk leaving to chance, he had to know.
to make weapons, and had left behind his home, money, and family because of it.
Thank you to everyone reading, I hope you enjoy this chapter.
A few moments of silence before a new voice entered the mix. “Steve, you have a date?”
Steve shook his head, “His last name is Stark.”
Steve felt his own grin turn predatory. “Since you asked so nicely…”
Unfortunately, before he could attempt it, the door opened again to reveal Natasha and Sam, the latter a little bruised up himself with a bandage above his right eyebrow.
Instead, Tony grew increasingly frustrated as Rogers stared down at his fucking phone the entire time. Tony didn’t mind being ignored at first, somewhat glad that those piercing eyes weren’t currently focused on him, but as the afternoon drew on, and Clint and Sam’s arms filled up with bags and boxes, irritation crept in.
Tony’s hand sped up and down his own length, twisting on every pass over his head. His other hand traced along the expanse of Rogers’ chest, ghosting across his nipples and splaying his palm out across the mob boss’ stomach. Tony wanted to lean forward and lick the water droplets off of Rogers, but managed to keep his tongue to himself, if only just barely.
Sam raised an eyebrow and waved at the file. “You know this lunatic?”
Tony and Bruce would stay behind at the warehouse, tracking their team’s movements and providing support where they could. With Tony’s final Thesis Defense coming up, and Steve’s singular focus on keeping him safe, Thor opted to stay behind as well.
Thanks again to my beta @MugiwaraLexi
Steve was inclined to agree, but he found himself looking over at Tony, who was immersed in the file. His boyfriend had given his enthusiastic consent to joining the Avengers, but that was mainly to find and punish those responsible for Hydra’s kidnapping. This was an entirely different ballgame, one Steve wasn’t sure Tony wanted any part of. They were talking about murder here. Steve had no intention of letting Zemo get arrested. His file suggested that he had friends within the system to get him off on any and all charges.
Happy Monday!
He let out a self deprecating laugh and ran his free hand over his face. “It didn’t help that he caught me with a guy when he came here to try and talk some sense to me. He had suspected I was gay before that, but I guess it’s different when the evidence is right in front of your face.” A shiver ran down his spine as he fought to keep from touching the scars that Howard’s rings had left. “He basically told me that if I didn’t get my ass out of Boston and stop all of this shit, then I would never see another penny from him.”
He hummed, his body instantly responding to the surprising meal. “Wow...thank you. Really.” Tony chewed and offered his hand. “I’m Tony.”
“I need you, Tony. Please.” He begged, his voice cracking with desperation.
Let's just all remember that Tony is not Laura...
They both made eye contact, worry giving way to laughter. Sam set the food down on Tony’s lap and pulled up a chair to sit beside the pair on the bed. “Well...yeah. He’s the
Steve swallowed thickly, as if the movement was painful, while Tony watched his Adam’s Apple bob up and down. He was stoic for another few seconds, then his shoulders slumped down heavily, the
The sputtering in response was pretty good for his ego.
In his thick accent, Pietro held out his hand for Clint to take. “Yes, we can trust you.”
Steve’s eyes widened, and he took a step back with his palms up. “It’s okay, I’m not going to hurt you. You’re safe,” He assured as gently as possible.
Steve froze. “Excuse me?”
The Winter Soldier flexed his metal arm, letting the light from the fluorescent lamp gleam off of it. “One.”
That was when Sam decided to enter the room, hands juggling a tray full of food and a tumblr of coffee. “What’s going on in here?”
Then Tony blinked in confusion and looked to Rogers for an explanation. “I formed the Avengers about a year after I took over as Captain of the Commandos. I needed a personal team around me here while I sent my father’s team to handle our business south.”
“Then don’t play the idiot, Stark. You know that the Commandos are the ones who put SI under investigation three years ago. I put in the work, kept the feds off my back as much as possible. But thanks to the fuckin’ Captain and his cronies, we lost one of our biggest Clients.” He let out a cruel laugh that made Tony want to cringe backwards. “And when I try to pawn
He could practically hear the other man grinning and patting himself on the back on the other line. “That’s my boy. Now outside of the whole ‘Steve is the center of my universe’ thing you’ve got going on, how’s everything else?”
They both laughed together when Pepper nearly pushed him off the bed. “Okay, first, your best friend is right here. We competed for the title, and I won since I have to continue dealing with you on a daily basis. Second, Jim will be so excited for you. Do you want to give him a call?”
“I know, Steve.” Tony brought their lips together sweetly, careful not to take too much before he had to leave for dinner. “I believe you.”
Happy Monday y'all! I know you were hoping Tony would meet back up with Steve and Bucky last week, so I hope this chapter makes up for it.
He managed to shuffle out to the kitchen table without any help, and collapsed into one of the chairs. Bucky glared at him for a few more seconds before scoffing and depositing himself onto the couch in the living room. Peter and Thor took seats on either side of Tony, eyes wide and earnest and ready to learn. He fought the urge to snort at the eager Avenger, but buckled down to walk him through the advanced material in front of them and answer any questions. If Thor really wanted to learn, then who was Tony to deny him?
, something connected with the back of his head and all he saw was black.
Tony shrugged, then remembered it wasn’t a video call. “Nothing’s going on, like I said, everything’s fine. I’m just being paranoid.”
“He’s
Once Sam left the room, Natasha made herself more comfortable, digging under the covers alongside Tony. He wasn’t going to lie, he really loved the casual comfort she was offering. “Tell me a story.” Tony asked, leaning back and closing his eyes.
About ten minutes before his demonstration was set to begin, something happened that was most definitely not part of the plan.
“No.” Bucky growled, “Don’t give me any bullshit about trust. You know you need to get over that.”
“Welcome back to the land of the living, Mr. Stark.” The man with the accent was back, gleefully reminding Tony that he had been kidnapped by a bunch of lunatics who wanted him to build weapons.
“I have a pen pal over in a country called Wakanda. She and I have been in touch for about five years or so, and we bounce ideas back and forth off of each other. Wakanda is known for its store of Vibranium, the rarest metal on Earth.” He chewed on his lip and played with the edge of the blanket. “She was kind enough to send me some, and I was able to manipulate it with a steel alloy. I know how attached you are to your shield, Cap, but I was thinking you might want to try this on for size.”
Natasha gave her affirmative and spent the next few minutes digging through all of the desks, stacking them neatly into a large pile before her watch chimed, signaling the end of her time. “Gotta go.”
“Like a fungus, surely.”
“I’ve asked everyone else to give you a wide berth for now, I didn’t want to overwhelm you. The Avengers are the only team members I allow to live here full time, but most of them are out on mission anyway. When you’re ready, I can begin introducing you.”
about these things before you just decide them. I can’t have someone trying to dictate my life, Steve, assuming that they know what’s best for me. Not again.”
The thought of having Sam and Bruce come anywhere near Tony had Steve shooting up and straightening his back. “I don’t…”
“Think about it, you fucking genius. SI has been a thorn in your side just as much as the rest of us, even more so, and now you’re ready to take them down. You and Steve...you’ll go the distance, you know? And you’re helping the Avengers along the way. I don’t believe in destiny or any shit like that, but the universe has a strange way of bringing people together.”
Steve coughed, keeping as close to the truth as possible. That was the trick to lying. “I joined the army right after high school with my best friend Bucky. When we got back, we ran around, getting into trouble with our friends until I decided to move here.”
A heaviness settled over Tony’s eyes, and he had the feeling that he should probably be bothered by the Avengers’ take on his relationship with Steve. However, the more he thought about it, the safer he felt. He
“JARVIS’ primary function is to keep me safe,” Tony explained, suddenly looking a little shy. “And he can do so much more than a regular computer ever could. I was thinking...if all goes well at my thesis defence, maybe I could integrate him into the Avenger’s missions?” He was quick to throw up his palms. “Only if you’re okay with that, of course.”
Tony had rolled his eyes and asked why the Commandos seemed so attached to bird names.
“That’s who Clint is to me. A year ago, I got myself tangled up with some bad people. Clint tried coming in to break up the party, but they just went after him too. We can handle ourselves, trust me on that. But when you are out-manned and out-gunned...sometimes there isn’t a way out.”
Rogers stared at him for a few, eternally long moments, poised like a snake. Tony refused to drop his gaze, waiting to see what Rogers’ next move would be. Unfortunately, he didn’t expect the swell of fury suddenly lighting up behind his kidnapper’s eyes. Rogers surged forward, his large palm covering up the entirety of Tony’s neck in a show of complete domination. Tony’s back hit the mirror with a harsh crack. Fear overcame his quick-lived confidence with ease and he looked off to the side in an attempt to stave off Rogers’ anger.
Silence stretched on between them, and Steve wasn’t sure what Bucky had hoped to accomplish. It wasn’t the first time Bucky had mentioned retiring, but anytime Steve offered him an out, his best friend would refuse, always reminding him that they would be together ‘till the end of the line.’
He led him to the bathroom so he could take a look in the mirror, and Tony blinked in surprise. He looked at least a few years older, and sharper than he had in a long time, if you overlooked his injuries. “I wasn’t sure about his offer at first, not until the first agent came sniffing around.”
“But I don’t want you to worry about that right now, okay?” He whispered against Tony’s temple, his skin warm and tender at his lips. “Just focus on getting better.”
“Steve found me in a run down motel in Salem. I thought that was the end of the line for me, that the General had found me.” Bruce shrugged and held a hand out to help Tony up from his chair. “But he just told me what a big fan of my work he was, and offered me protection.”
Sam laughed, shaking his head. “Can I get you anything to eat? I was going to make some breakfast.”
. His. And someone had taken him. Someone had
That earned him a round of protests and questions from almost everyone in the room, but Steve wasn’t having any of it. Suddenly he was using this voice that Tony had only heard a sample of back at the apartment. “This is not a
“Love you too.” Tony replied faintly before hanging up the phone. He tapped it against his chin, wondering what the hell could have happened last night for Steve to be acting like that. It wasn’t like his boyfriend was keeping things from him, Steve
“Stevie!” Bucky called out, grasping at his shoulder. “Are you okay?”
It took Tony a few thoroughly embarrassing moments to remember his poorly ingrained manners. “I, er, thank you. I...you didn’t have to do that. I was fine with just the regular coffee…” His cheeks warmed again, and he wasn’t able to keep looking up at the man’s expression, which was hovering between amusement and something that resembled worry.
I want you. But sweetheart, this is only our first date. I want to do this right. So, I’m going to bring you home, walk you to your door, kiss you good night, and then I’ll pick you up for our next date tomorrow.” He kissed Tony again, softly this time. They both hummed at the contact, and Steve’s eyes fluttered. “Does that sound okay?”
He nodded, burying his face into Steve’s chest. “Yeah, I know.” Tony pulled Steve’s arm around his shoulders and spun around towards the laptop. “JARVIS, wait until you hear about Steve’s art classes. He’s fantastic.”
A rush of anger poured over him as she held out her hand. “Hi, I’m Pepper. Tony’s best friend.”
Each one of the Avengers groaned in unison, and Nat started pushing the archer out of the room a little harder than necessary. Tony waited behind with Steve once the debrief was over, buzzing with excitement over his first mission. “So, are you finally going to explain how the hell you know an F.B.I agent?”
Bucky’s brow furrowed.
He waved a polite goodbye to the committee and slung on his backpack. Tony squared his shoulders, ready to meet Steve, who was sure to be waiting outside by now, and stepped out into the hallway. As he walked past the bathrooms, the faint observation that the building was suspiciously empty flitting across the back of his mind,, a hand reached out behind him, forcing a rag into his mouth and over his nose.
He breathed out a ragged sigh, nodded to himself, then turned back to the twins. “Come with us, we’ll figure out how to help you in the morning.”
Sometime during the drive over, he had completely shifted over into “The Captain” persona, and he wrenched out of Bucky’s touch, skin still crawling at the distance between him and Tony. The moment that Tony had mentioned the feeling of someone watching him, he knew something was wrong. Tony was a genius and surprisingly intuitive. If he didn’t feel safe for any reason whatsoever, then he wasn’t fucking safe. Steve ignored his right hand man for a moment and directed his attention at Clint. “Hawkeye, give me your report on when I asked you to observe Tony.”
“Not you.” Steve rolled his eyes. “His helper bot, DUM-E. Tony made him a few years ago along with another robot, U, that’s already at the lab. Speaking of which, I need someone to call Peter Parker, one of Tony’s students. The school knows he’s on medical leave for now, but Peter can pick up any work he’s missed and bring it to our place. Plus, I think Tony will be happy to see him.”
...won’t try something like this again, but I do need you to be safe, Tony. I know you’ll be an asset to Bruce on the mission, but can we at least set some sort of time frame? I won’t be able to concentrate knowing an Avengers operation might jeopardize your future and your safety.”
“Widow, I want you on surveillance. Check every traffic camera and restaurant security from here to the University, whatever is available to find out the license plate on that truck. I need targets and I need them now.” He turned to look at the archer. “Clint, check the streets. Find a list of witnesses and see what you can get out of them.”
Thor’s smile was practically beaming, and he looked over at a disgruntled Bucky, who nodded with a frown. “You’ll rest after though, right?”
“What is the meaning of this?” Zemo hissed, arms stretched out to grasp his comrades wrists.
to be alone. Being alone meant that Hydra could come back to get him...wait, not Hydra, Hydra was dead. Fucking blown up, his own doing.
The man spread his arms out wide and accommodating. “Only the best for our resident engineer. We can’t have you working if your dead.”
Dear fucking God, yes, Tony wanted to touch it. He just barely held back a whimper, but couldn’t stop his hand from reaching down and giving his own cock a slight pull. The relief was instantaneous, so he gripped himself tighter, just the way he liked it. Rogers moved forward slowly, keeping his darkened gaze on Tony. When he was close enough to touch, something feral and needy in the back of Tony’s mind demanded that he feel the wet skin, so he didn’t bother trying to keep his hands off Rogers. The mob boss sucked in a pleased hiss when Tony’s fingers skimmed across his abs, then pressed closer to give him more room to work with.
Bruce shook his head and waved him off. “If something happens, Tony, I’ll make sure to let you know. Sleep well, and let Thor drive you to campus tomorrow.”
Tony raises an interested eyebrow.
“Protect me? Steve, I’m fine!” Tony shook his head, throwing Steve’s hands off of him as he stepped back into the bedroom. “Is this about me thinking someone is watching me? It’s stupid! I’m just being paranoid!”
The back of his neck warmed significantly, and he pawed at it. Tony stepped forward, cursing again as he tripped over his worn out sneakers and catching himself on the black marble counter. “Uh, right, sorry. Sorry.” Tony huffed out a breath, fumbling for his wallet, held together by scotch tape. “I’ll take a large black coffee with one, no, no, two shots of espresso.”
“I’m fine.” He promised, and proceeded to slam the door in Bucky’s face. Tony resisted the urge to groan as he relieved himself. He was still in pain, but it was manageable. He wasn’t about to complain though, and have Steve running back and try to usher him back into bed.
Maria Stark hit that point once Tony became too wiley and unpredictable to show off at events. When he was younger, one smack to the head or a threat of further pain from his father was enough to keep him in line at all of the fancy dinners and fundraisers Maria put on. However, as he got older, Tony grew a set of balls and fought against
Tony stood up abruptly, suddenly needing space between him and the mob boss. “I-I’m tired,” he announced, hating the fact that Rogers could see his flushed face and rising chest. It was no secret that he wasn’t unaffected by the man’s nearness. “I want to go to sleep.”
Tony squeezed his eyes shut and burrowed into Rhodes’ side. “I-I thought I was dying all over again. I couldn’t...I couldn’t breathe.”
Thinking about Steve’s crystal blue eyes, closed in ecstatic pleasure as he grunted into the back of Tony’s neck, his large hands splayed across Tony’s stomach and chest as he held him place. The hand on his cock tightened and sped up desperately as he thought about what it would be like to have Steve recklessly pounding into him with utter abandon and...
Clint sighed. “We’re just a few blocks north. We have some hitchhikers…”
“TONY! NURSE! NURSE! SOMETHING’S WRONG!”
“Yeah, yeah, I guess you’re-” Tony paused when Thor’s eyes flickered behind him, and whatever he saw caused all of the blood to drain from his face. Thor’s hand reached out quickly to grab onto the front of his jacket, but before he could, someone else’s clapped him on the shoulder.
“Don’t say shit like that, Buck. It’s just asking for the universe to prove you wrong.” He followed his not-so-superstitious best friend outside with his mask tucked away inside his pocket and started north. Ten minutes later, they met an anxious looking Natasha leaning up against a brick wall next to an alleyway, and Steve scowled at her.
Steve didn’t move for a long few seconds, and Tony could almost see the wheels turning in his head as he put all the pieces together. “You’re Anthony,
Steve was looking at him with an odd expression, some kind of cross between amused and fond, something Tony couldn’t really understand. “It’s good to see you too. Did the second shot of espresso get you through your class today?”
Steve spun around, eyes scanning through the spectators before landing on a tall, thin boy with messy sandy blonde hair. As soon as their eyes met, he jumped up in recognition. “Steve?”
Steve had. A month ago, Joseph had let himself into Steve’s room, pacing slowly along the line of expansive, bullet-proof windows as the fading sunlight crept away. He wanted his son to begin thinking about the legacy he one day hoped to leave for the Howling Commandos. Each generation grew their family in different ways. How would Steve measure up?
Bucky pushed himself to his feet and held out his hand, determination and trust carved out openly across his features. “‘Till the end of the line?”
However, for those who had the displeasure of watching her tear apart one of Zemo’s warehouse, they might see her almost having...
having Tony so close. Tony’s hands slid over his hair, gripping tightly and yanking Steve’s head back. His normally cerulean blue eyes were completely blown and glazed over, and Tony knew his own had to match in turn. “Clothes-“ Tony choked out and ground down again to increase the pressure against his cock. “They need to be off, like,
All he needed to do was wake up.
“W-Why?”
Steve turned on his heel to face his best friend. From the way Tony’s entire demeanor changed and shut down

to him that he’d been able to meet Steve and his team. The Avengers had become his friends, and Steve...he was Tony’s rock, his true north. His father and Obie wanted to erase the type of person Tony had become, to discredit all that Steve, Pepper, Rhodey, Bucky, Bruce, Clint, Sam, Nat, Thor, Peter, and Harley had helped turn him into. And that was such utter and complete
He could stay.
Bucky crossed his arms over his chest, “For two fuckin’ hours? Try again."
Of course Steve would place some kind of blame on his two friends. He had trusted them to keep Tony safe, and he ended up being taken by Hydra. There was only one problem...It was complete and utter
Thanks for reading y'all! I'd love to hear your thoughts. I always appreciate all of the kudos/comments/messages. You guys are wonderful.
Steve watched Natasha prowl in front of the three younger men. Their eyes were wide and terrified. They must have heard rumors about the Black Widow. Good. Maybe the Avengers’ reputation was climbing quicker than he thought.
But Tony had Steve, and the Avengers. He trusted his friends to get him out of this mess, one way or another. Maybe he could talk to his dad before he changed the will, anything to keep him from returning to SI, where someone was
Tony shrugged, looking between the two. “There was nothing you could have done, and the only thing to do now is move on. You know how I’m going to do that, don’t you?”
Thor grinned, absurdly proud of that fact. “Aye, it is a grand tradition. Strong names for a strong family.” His mouth twisted into a tired frown, a look that didn’t belong on his face. “My brother recently found out that he was adopted, which makes him no less of my brother in my eyes, but Loki did not see it that way. He grew angry and rebellious, and began making trouble back home. After a particularly nasty fight with my father, Loki disappeared one night, and came here to America.”
He spun around, eyes wide in disbelief as he watched the ex-army Captain America look alike from this morning, the subject of his shower fantasy, walk towards him. “Steve?”
It had started off like any other, really. He had stayed over at Natasha’s place, but they had gotten into a fight because he apparently used the last of her

hurt, and he wasn’t ready to wake up yet. The light persisted. Why was Steve trying to wake him up? Didn’t he know that Tony was exhausted?
He could see the moment Rogers caught onto the cruel scheme, because his lips twisted downwards into a confused frown. Tony slipped underneath the mob boss’ arm, careful to keep eye contact until he turned away.
“You heard me. She’s been calling, checking up on you. Stevie doesn’t want her to visit.”
Once the introductions were out of the way, Steve steered him to the couch and pushed his shoulders so that Tony had no choice but to sit. Everyone else remained standing though, and Tony finally couldn’t bite down his frustration anymore.
Regardless of that trust, as soon as Tony had JARVIS in his hands, he would feel about a thousand times safer. He would finally know where exactly he was, and his AI’s primary protocol was his safety, so if Tony was actually ever in any real danger, JARVIS would do everything in his power to protect him.
speaking, and something was very, very wrong. When they reached the warehouse and stuffed themselves into Steve’s office, his best friend dropped a huge fucking bomb on them.
I'd love to hear your thoughts. Kudos/Comments are greatly appreciated!
related to numbers, knew no bounds.
Tony took a deep breath and nodded. “Yeah, okay. Thanks Pep.”
Red swam into his vision, and could practically feel the Captain taking over. He straightened in his seat, tilted his head side to side, cracking the joints in his neck loudly, and slammed the passenger side door, forcing Natasha out of the way. Steve’s fingers curled into a fist and he beat it against the dash. “He’s going after Tony.
Bucky drew up to his full height and scowled at the hovering students. “Alright munchkins, scatter. We’ve got this handled.”
“Yes,” He answered immediately, ignoring the rushing in his ears. Might as well go for it. He hadn’t had a date in...dammit, had it really been
She laughed brightly, tugging him over towards the couch. “So it went well?”

The younger man smiled sweetly. “Then you’ll have me.”
“Get your ass back to work.”
Tony leaned down and picked up a particularly heavy-looking mechanical hammer from the bottom rack and set it down in front of Thor. “That, my friend, is your new favorite toy. It’s biometrically altered, so only you, and me of course, can lift it. It scans the fingerprint then distributes the weight accordingly. You’ll also find different settings where it holds a max of about five hundred volts of electricity, more than enough to kill someone, so be careful with that sucker. It can also rebuild itself into an axe when you hit the right combination.”
After his short-lived fight with Steve, the four of them spent a few hours drawing up a list of who could possibly want their hands on Tony Stark. The shitty thing was that the list was very,
Before he could dive into it, Bucky covered Tony’s hand with his own flesh and blood one. “Remember that conversation we had before?”
Bucky chanced a look at Steve while Sam was telling his story, and
Tony immediately sat up in his make-shift hospital bed, dismayed to find that he had been strapped down. “What the fuck did you do?”
It was...new.
Steve let out a strangled cough, cheeks flushing as he frowned down at his boyfriend. Pepper and Rhodes each covered their laughter decently well, but not well enough to avoid a disapproving glare from the blonde. “There definitely won’t be any of that, anytime soon, Tony.” He couldn’t find it in him to really be upset though, considering that Tony was feeling well enough to joke about their sex life.
because of one of SI’s bombs.
The three separate groups would get into position, and when the bar closed to pedestrians, all of the Avengers would strike at once. They would take down a major sex trafficking ring in one night, and make the city a safer place for tomorrow.
“And you’re going to help me do just that, Stark.”
Natasha spoke up first. “Ready for your signal. Should be in and out within twenty minutes once we get this party started.”
. And they were as horrifyingly evil as before. If Tony didn’t do what they wanted, they were going to kill thousands of people. But if he did...there was no telling what kind of damage they could do. New York was still hurting from the devastation Hydra brought a few years back. Tony suddenly wished for the Captain to reappear and save the day again. He stopped them once, he could do it again.

Isn't that what his dad used to say when he had one too many glasses of whiskey? (Which was ALWAYS). He couldn’t show weakness to these people.

The Avengers seemed to have sensed his hesitance, because they all turned their eyes to Tony. The young genius looked up to see everyone looking at him, and didn’t hesitate to flash a handsome smile at Steve. “Well, it's a good thing that I just finished with everyone’s new gear.”
Please enjoy!

“Stevie?” Bucky called, interrupting his inappropriately timed daydream. Steve’s fingers twitched with the instinctual desire to pick up his pencil and sketchbook and trace the lines of the man’s face, which he forced down, along with his interested half hard-on. “What are you looking at?”
He obeyed silently, fiddling uncomfortably with a stray piece of circuitry he left in the pocket of his hoodie while the man disappeared. He returned a few seconds later, sitting down and pushing the coffee and both blueberry muffins in front of Tony. “Eat.”

“What? Why not?”
He was spun around roughly, and all the air was punched out of him when his gaze fell upon
Steve sucked in a breath, eyes disbelieving. “You...really?”
Stane leaned forward so close that the pungent smell of cigars and ash filled his nostrils. “The fuckin’
Steve looked around for a moment before grinning down at him. “Why don’t I give you a ride?”
“You did the right thing, Nat.” Steve praised softly. “Let’s go talk to them, and if I like their story, we’ll bring them back to the warehouse.”
So, here he was, counting down the minutes until he could afford to buy groceries while he stepped onto the bus. Now that the caffeine from earlier that morning was no longer in his system, the migraine inched its way back between his temples. Tony leaned his head back against the cool window as the bus filled up around him. He didn’t live too far off campus, but it was a long enough trip for him to get in a quick power nap.
, not my keeper. I should be there with Bruce, not locked up at home.”
“You are not fine,” Steve insisted, cutting off any of Tony’s further protests. “You’re hurting, love.”
A faint cracking sounded on the other line, and Rhodey muttered under his breath. “Well, just be careful, alright Tones? Pepper told me about how one of the New York gangs showed up there in Boston.”
Sometimes he
Steve in there, looking at him with expectant amusement. “Be safe. I’ll see you tomorrow night.”
Steve cupped his free hand around Tony’s face and leaned down for a chaste kiss. “Graduation, and then you’ll be free to start up your own company. Our intel should be ready by Monday, and we’ll move out against Zemo that evening. We’ll be back in time Tuesday to celebrate you completing your third doctorate.”
“Stark,” Bucky cut off with an annoyed huff. “Yes, you can get your greedy little paws on my arm.” He took a deep breath, rolling his eyes upwards in an attempt to pray for patience (which, okay, rude), before meeting Tony’s eye. “You said you can make it stop hurting, right?”
They spent the next thirty minutes or so chatting and walking around the store while Tony picked up items here and there, his hands never able to be completely still. The younger man didn’t talk much, but Steve had a feeling that would change once Tony felt a little more comfortable around him, something he fully intended to pursue. He learned that Tony earned his undergraduate degree in mechanical engineering, then a masters in physics, and two doctorates in biomedical and civil engineering. Currently, he was working on completing his third and final doctorate in computer engineering.
His boyfriend was quiet for a few minutes, and before Tony could open his mouth again to tell Steve to forget it, he sighed. “Coulson is helping us investigate, but it’s slow going. There are only a handful of people who even knew of your kind of talent, sweetheart, and they’re all at the heart of the company. They’re pretty much untouchable for people working inside the law.”
. I, I need-“
praise him for his work. But after the mess with Hydra in New York, and Tony blatantly refusing to follow in his father’s footsteps, Obie turned away from him too. The young genius was sixteen when he realized that his godfather was only interested in the money Tony could make for him.
was always at the forefront during Avengers missions and meetings, and Tony was more than a little interested in seeing Steve come in and out of it. His voice was deeper than normal, and something in his tone demanded obedience. The low timbre had a way of seeping into the fear receptors in your brain, causing the listener to be instantly on edge and alert. If Steve were to go in public, around people who didn’t know him, the aura he produced would send them reeling. He always tended to give off those ‘
Tony pulled out his phone again to give it a quick peek. If Steve returned to the house and didn’t find them there, then surely he would call right? The pit in his stomach that had only grown since this morning was aching now, and he wasn’t sure what kind of explanation would be enough to fill it. He loved Steve, and Tony trusted him. But this was...this was just nuts.
Tony snorted, taking stock of all of the wires and IV’s running into his body. “It doesn’t sound like you’ve given me much incentive to cooperate here.”
Thanks for reading! Again, I really love every comment that I read, and y'all are wonderful. Have a wonderful weekend!
He blinked at the man’s sleeping form as he paused at the edge of the bed. Rogers really thought he could just slip into bed beside Tony and everything would be fine? What the fuck? Sure, Tony was grateful for his phone and laptop, but it didn’t mean that he was comfortable with Rogers taking over his space. Especially his fucking bed.
Tony hummed, drawing out of his lust-filled haze like he was sixteen years old again. “Yeah, missed you though.”
“Yes. If Tony wants to be a part of the Avengers, then I trust him.”
“We’re ready, sweetheart.” Steve told him, holding him close to his chest and whispering in his ear. Tony took a deep breath and brought the bomb to his lips, using the voice command feature and smearing a trail of his blood onto the scanner. The moment he did, Bucky tore it out of his hands and threw it into the room with the dead Hydra leaders.
S Rogers 3:47PM:
Tony’s eyes flickered up to the mob boss’ relaxed face to confirm he was still asleep, then brought his gaze back down. Tattoos littered the smooth skin, and Tony found himself reaching out a hand to trace the patterns. Of course, when he realized what he was doing, he snapped it back, mortified that his body tried moving without his permission.
Steve rolled his eyes. “We’ve got plenty of time before I need to take over your responsibilities, old man. I’m perfectly happy watching you scare your enemies into submission. I’m planning to ride that wave a little longer.”
He might have been Tony Carbonell for the past three years. He might have changed his name, lost his fortune, and kept away from the family business as if his life depended on it, but none of that changed the fact that he was a Stark at the very center of his core.
The chef scooped out a portion of the Saltimbocca di Pollo alla Romana onto Tony’s waiting plate, then stepped back to give him some space. Tony kept his eyes on Rogers as he tried the pasta and chicken, humming when the spices danced along his tongue.
Stane’s eyes widened in bewildered fear before Tony’s words sunk in, and his lips twitched upwards into harsh laugh. “
“Since I’m officially on the team and everything, I want you to start calling me by alias when we’re on a mission. So, try again.”
“I’m okay, I’m okay.” He reassured, melting against the hands that flitted over his face, arms, and chest to check for any obvious injuries. “Cap, seriously, I’m good.” Tony soaked in the comfort of his boyfriend’s closeness and grasped Steve’s jaw. “It’s
When Tony’s sweet, caramel brown eyes opened again, he squinted at each of their faces as he tried to make sense of the room. “Rhodey? Pep?” His voice was rough and sounded unnatural.
The younger man chewed on the inside of his cheek, a faint blush rising up the back of his neck. “You...well you stopped. Do, do you not want me?”
Stevie had mulled over the information for a few minutes, then crouched down to the ground, where the twins were huddled up. Bruce had done a preliminary examination, and there were a few cracked ribs that were taped up, but no broken bones or head injuries were apparent. He told them that the Captain would decide where and how he would treat them further.
Tony panicked. Steve didn’t understand. Hydra
Chapter 9
“You really, really should not have done that.”
Tony practically threw his groceries into their designated places in the pantry and fridge before pulling out his cell phone and starfishing onto the bed. The ringer on the other line only sounded twice before she picked up. “Hello?”
Natasha and Clint stood at the front of the conference table Monday morning, flipping through the projector slides and detailing out Zemo’s operation to the rest of the team.
Both she and Bucky raised their eyebrows in surprise, then looked at each other as if Steve had gone crazy. He shrugged, a small smirk dancing across his lips. “What? I have a soft spot for kids. Come on.”
“Yeah,” he frowned. When the papers reported Hydra had taken credit for a recent bombing, he hadn’t wanted to believe it. Especially considering that the gang had somehow gotten hold of SI weapons when they were back in New York. “Hydra’s back, and I’ve been hearing a few rumors that they’re in a gang war with this group called the Avengers.” It was times like these when he missed the Captain and his Commandos. Tony had practically worshiped them when he still lived in Manhattan.
“And your son? Where does he fit into all of this?”
“Yeah, yeah.” Tony grumbled, stuffing his things into his backpack. “I’ll let Point Break try his hand on driving on the right side of the road.”
threats? Do you know the kind of lawyers my family has, Point-Break? They were serious, I’m...I’m…” He sucked in a haggard breath, and his knees gave out on him, but luckily Thor was right there to hoist him back onto his shaky feet. “I’m trapped. There’s no getting out of this…”
“You’re good for him. You helped him get back to his old self.”
“I know.” He said fondly, backing up towards the door. “That’s why I’m taking advantage now.”
“But,” Tony argued, the noise coming out of his throat sounding dangerously like a small whine. “But, I could do a systems check again? Or confirm that all of the security cameras will be down once they move out? Or, I don’t know, verify the weakest entrance points?”
“Fuck.” Tony ran an agitated hand through his newly cut hair. “
. Suddenly he wanted to do something besides work a job. Steve found someone who he could focus all of his ridiculous pent up energy on, and goddammit, Tony just took it all in stride.
Tony scoffed, “Isn’t that a basic requirement to join the Avengers? From what I’ve heard, all of you are masters at holding grudges.”
Pepper lit up, clutching her hands together. “Such a gentleman. Please make sure Tony remembers every single detail about your date so that I can live vicariously through him. Have fun!”
A flash of hardness worked its way into Steve’s handsome features. “Tell me what to do.”
“Your family is sure into Norse mythology, huh?”
I’ve disabled the location features on both your phone and laptop. Sorry about that.
“Fuck.” Clint swore, and Sam smacked him upside the head.
“I do.” He insisted. “Steve is angry he left me in the first place, but he isn’t mad at you two, not really. He just needs a little help directing his anger in a new direction.”
“Copy,” Steve clipped. “Soldier, can you give us a potential timeline?”
Tony’s cheeks visibly flushed, and his caramel brown eyes widened in confusion. “You really want to uh...hang out more?”
But his intensity was getting on Tony’s last nerve. Whatever promises he made fell short whenever Tony remembered that he wasn’t here by choice. Sure, Rogers said that he just wanted to get to know him, for a chance at something more between them, but it had only been a few days, and he already missed his friends. Surprisingly enough, Tony also missed his work.
Steve had to catch him pinching pennies.
Peter’s eyes were wide with excitement as he nodded. “Yes!”
Happy Monday everyone! I hope you had a wonderful weekend, I know I did! I got back from beach where I got a lot of writing done! I've written up to chapter 8 so far (I think this story will have about 16 chapters?) and will continue posting on Mondays until I've finished the story. Once that happens, I'll move to updating twice a week.
more. His vision was brought to light by his own son, Joseph, who integrated the use of assassins into the gang’s repertoire. After years of building, training, and executing an elite team, the Commandos were officially the gang to turn to if a hit was needed. Simply no one else on the Eastern Seaboard could execute a hit as flawlessly as Dum Dum Dugan, Gabe Jones, Montgomery Falsworth, Jim Morita, and Jacques Dernier. Despite their reputation and imperceptible signatures, the police were never able to find enough evidence to convict the Howling Commandos on any charges, whether they be murder or any of their drug related crimes.
his parents wanted for him. Once his mother couldn’t parade Tony around as the perfect son and the perfect heir to Stark Industries, Maria started ignoring his presence altogether. He was eleven when his mother ceased to be anything but a roommate.
Bucky cursed loudly. “Are you telling me that your boyfriend is
He chuckled as he remembered, resting his hands back behind his head. “I tried to stay out of it, but one of them smashed a bottle on a table and came after me. I barely had time to blink before Steve twisted the poor bastard’s arm back behind him and snapped it. Didn’t take long for his buddies to find out who the real threat was. They jumped us like fleas on a dog, and Steve just...became this other person. The sweet, homegrown boy I was just talking to turned into this badass super soldier, tearing through these guys like it was nothing. Five minutes later, they were all groaning on the ground with broken wrists and dislocated shoulders. Then the smug bastard sat back down, ordered another drink, and turned to me with a smile.”
In an instant, Tony flinched back and covered his chest with splayed hands, knocking back against the porcelain.
Steve agreed, and determined that once they had a handle of his current movements and a location where they were keeping their victims, he and Bucky would go after Zemo and his closest associates, while Sam, Clint, and Natasha would perform the jailbreak, taking out as many members of the Masters of Evil as possible.
“None of this is your fault.” Steve insisted vehemently, letting a hint of his “Captain” voice seep through. That earned him a wide-eyed gaze from Tony. “You were only trying to make your father proud of you, that’s it. The blame falls on whoever is selling SI’s weapons to terrorists, and them alone.” He reached out to grip Tony’s chin lightly, willing him to understand. “I will find out who’s behind this, and I will make them pay. No one will ever hurt you again.” Steve sealed his promise with a kiss, binding them together the best way he knew how. He left delicate kisses along his cheeks, trailing upwards with delicate precision.
Steve twisted onto his back, letting his hands rest across the back of his head. “Sure is. He’s sleeping now.”
(See the end of the chapter for
He looked at Tony expectantly, flexing and unflexing his metal hand. “Well, get on with it, Stark.”
Steve grit his teeth, but bit into his food just the same. He was silent for a while as he drove on, but it wasn’t uncomfortable. He got like this sometimes, quiet and brooding as he deliberated over an important choice. Even Tony, who was known for his incessant banter, knew better than to interrupt when Steve closed off from his friends.

But none of that was Tony’s fault.
him, like he needed air to breathe.
?” Bucky asked sharply, leaning over the console to see the headline.
She instantly jumped to her feet and reached out to jerk Bruce up to his feet, causing the rest of the Avengers to lean back at the aggressiveness. “Everything went fine. I grabbed the cash and a stack of paperwork like you asked. I’ll be headed to count it after our debriefing.” She took a deep breath to steady herself, and Bucky straightened in his chair on Steve’s right. “But when I started uploading the information from Zemo’s computer to Bruce, he found something.”
He shook his head, “Yes, he’s from Norway. Now how the hell do you do that thing with your eyebrows? Nat can do it, and I’ve always wanted to.”

The corners of Steve’s lips twitched as he watched his boyfriend. “I couldn’t agree more.”
tendency to give his partners (technically only two partners, because after the second one dropped out from a nervous breakdown, his professor’s stopped pairing him up) whiplash. But it was Friday, which meant he just needed to get through his eleven o’clock class before he could hop on a bus to take him back to his run down apartment and pass out for two days straight.
, Steve?” If he hadn’t been so blindingly frustrated, he might have seen the way the others stiffened as Tony advanced on their friend. “I don’t need a fucking babysitter. I need you to tell me why you dragged my ass halfway across town for me to just sit here while you go off and do God knows what with your friends!”
Part I: Tony, Steve, and Bucky are teenagers. This part will be 4 chapters long.
“How are you feeling, Tony?” She asked, as beautiful and deadly as he remembered her.
Tony worked his magic, and Bucky covered his back while the three of them got the hell out of there. They made it with time to spare, but Tony had passed out by the time they got to the van.
“Yeah, Doc?”
“Why do I…” Stane looked at Tony like he was an idiot. “Did you just fucking forget everything that happened before Howard cut the damn cord?”
“WHERE THE HELL HAVE YOU BEEN?”
“What are you trying to accomplish here?”
what he actually wanted. And he did, he wanted Tony.
to break the tense silence, Steve spoke up. “Why does it look like you haven’t been taking very good care of yourself?"
“I did, now you’ve got to wake up or else I’m going to call Brucie-bear and show him first.”
Hands carded through his hair, sending tiny shards of glass from the car’s windows sprinkling out onto the concrete floor. “I know it does, Mr. Stark. We have a doctor en route. He will help with your...injuries...and then you will help us.”

The Captain raised his shield outwards, narrowing his eyes.
Tony nodded, resting his head back along Steve’s collarbone and biting his lip. “So, do you think…”
The man in question appeared at his side, staring out at the coastline with a wistful expression, giving Steve everything he needed to know about how the meeting went. “Assholes.”
“Steve?” He asked cautiously.
Bucky chose then to end his call and step up beside his best friend, metal arm covered by a sweatshirt and gloves. “Bruce and the others are on their way. Do we have anything else?”
Tony opened and then closed his mouth, grimacing when he found it was parched. Steve didn’t hesitate to grab the water cup from the counter, toss a straw into it, and hand it to Pepper. When she pulled the drink away gingerly, Tony was able to swallow normally. “What happened?”
They grinned at one another for a few moments before Tony coughed awkwardly, realizing that he probably held on for way longer than was strictly necessary. “So, what are you doing in Cambridge?”

When Steve knocked on the door the very next night, Tony was in the middle of mussying up his hair on accident. He wasn’t nervous. He
“Like I got hit by a car.” He joked, or at least, thought he was joking until he watched Steve stiffen, and remembered. “Oh fuck, I can’t believe I haven’t asked this yet.” Tony pushed up to his elbows, eyes furrowed in panic. “Are Sam and Bruce okay?
The man shrugged. “Indulge me.”
Monocle Man sputtered in fury. “Something of yours?” He turned towards Tony again, his eyes widening in understanding. “Oh, fu-”

“He’s right, Tony. It might be a tad barbaric, but in Steve’s eyes, you
Tony hummed, happy and warm, and let sleep overtake him once again.
“Cap, Thor confirmed that Tony’s back at the condo for the night.”
When Bucky, Natasha, Clint, and Sam approached his desk warily, sliding a 4x6 photograph in front of him, Steve saw red.
“I don’t blame you. I did, for a while.” He admitted, and Tony felt his heart plummet. “After the accident, I wanted Stark Industries to crumble. I stalked your family for months, gathering as much intel as I could to put whoever it was that was behind the Hydra arsenal away. When I did, and the police didn’t fucking do shit except an investigation that didn’t go anywhere, I pushed Stevie to get the fuck out of New York.”
“You’re the one who has to tell Steve.”
Then he was being ushered into a van, and all he remembered was a distant roar in the background before he let the darkness take him.
Until he wasn’t.
designs.”
Natasha smirked, “You want to help us find the rat.”
the people responsible for hurting Tony. For hurting the man that his best friend in the world loved. Because judging by the way Steve was looking at him, Tony was now a part of the Avengers’ lives, for better or for worse, and the Avengers were family. They protected their own.
He was herded into stores he was vaguely familiar with, practically ambushed with managers and associates climbing over themselves to help Tony pick out something to wear. Apparently everyone in this town knew who the Captain was, and were eager to please him and the man on his arm. Tony tried to hold back a scoff of annoyance and failed.
The shower helped calm the frayed nerves that had been stretched thin over the past few days. It had been nothing short of a roller coaster of emotions, and Tony was looking forward to not being dragged in every which direction. He could relax and have his favorite meal, just for tonight, right? Then deal with...everything else tomorrow.
“Don’t be an idiot, Stevie.” Bucky admonished, his Brooklyn drawl leaking through his words. “You’ve already missed enough, your professors aren’t going to be so understanding much longer. Come on, what would Tony want?”
The potential relief from the pain seemed to be enough to get Bucky down from his oversensitivity, and he gruffed out his acceptance. Tony breathed out a sigh of satisfaction and walked back over to the cart, where a blanket was covering the last piece of material. He looked over at Steve and couldn’t help the nervous smile that danced across his lips. “And, last but not least, our dear Captain needs something special.” Steve stood up and walked over to the front of the room, eyes dancing with excitement.
“Thank you both for speaking about the attack, I know how difficult it must have been for you.” Steve told the teenagers earnestly. They were good kids who’d been through an ungodly amount, and his heart ached for them. He wasn’t sure what all he could do for them, at least not without talking to Tony first, but he did want to help. Besides the addition of the Maximoffs, Clint and Sam’s report was pretty standard.
As Steve stood up and put a hand out to stop him, Tony side stepped out of his reach. “And you don’t have to worry about me. I can take care of myself.”
It was completely and utterly unfair.
“Sam, why aren’t you at the warehouse?”
” He implored, and Steve knew what he was trying to say. Sam and Bruce were family too, and he needed to remember that they didn’t set out to hurt Tony. He needed to trust his friends, just like they trusted him.
Tony could feel his eyebrows practically disappearing into his hairline. “You’ve got to be kidding me. The rest of the Commandos are fine just blindly following a man they call ‘The Captain’? The entire US police force and FBI is terrified of some nickname?”
That led him to an entirely different issue. Could he live with being involved with a mob boss? Tony already knew that Rogers had no issue with murder, as he’d gunned down a man who’d betrayed his family. Sure, the guy had been hurting children and obviously doing some really shady stuff, but what if his punishment was how Rogers dealt with every person who stepped out of line? Had the mob boss killed anyone innocent?
His lawyer, Matt Murdock, had informed him the next day at the reading of the will that Howard and Maria had managed to update their will
He practically jumped out of his skin when the door flung open to reveal an extremely irritated Bucky Barnes. “Goddamnit Stark! You’re driving me fucking crazy, just get yourself in here.” He stalked back inside, leaving the entryway open.
His boyfriend split his time between the Avengers warehouse and MIT’s engineering lab. Someone was always with him, whether he was collaborating with Bruce, or throwing ideas back and forth with the others on exactly what they would want in their weapons. At the MIT lab, Clint or Steve often accompanied him, and they’d spent a lot of time with Peter, who they’d become particularly attached to, and Harley, the new transfer student who Tony had taken under his wing.
going Point-Break?”
Steve’s head snapped up. “
Steve’s chest rumbled happily at having Tony so close, and he snaked his arms around his waist. “Coulson and Clint have been together for a long time,” he started. “They met back when Natasha got herself mixed up with the Russian mafia, and Coulson was a special agent. You’ll have to ask Clint how that relationship even started out, but I know he saved Coulson’s life on a case. After that, they were pretty devoted to one another. When he and Natasha joined the Avengers, I was against having any form of law enforcement aware of our...activities, for obvious reasons.”
Feeling confident, Steve leaned forward, capturing Tony’s mouth with his own and slotting himself in between his legs. It was tentative at first, but Tony’s lips molded to his own immediately, and his hands snakes up and around Steve’s neck and entangled themselves into his hair.
(08/02 minor clean-up edits)
“At ease, soldier,” Tony told him seriously, because it always seemed to work wonders. Immediately, some of the tension left Steve’s shoulders, but he his jaw was still tight. “I’m sorry to ruin any plans you might have had, but it’s important.” He gestured towards the couch. “Come on, sit down.”
She waved him off, “Focus, Tony. So, are you ready to get back into the swing of things?”
And the crowd went wild.
. If Steve thought this was important, then it was important. They stared each other down for a few more tense moments before Tony let out a breath and nodded warily.
Dear God, it hurt to say his name. Hurt to even think it. The worst part was that Steve didn’t even know if he was alive or dead. He had to fight to stay on his feet when Sam described Tony’s injuries from the crash, at least the obvious ones, and he bit his tongue so hard that it bled when he thought about how much pain the love of his life had to be in.
Sam snorted across the living room, careful to keep his voice down for the ones sleeping on the couch. The Avengers were scattered around in various positions and states of consciousness with empty pizza boxes lining the coffee table. Bucky and Natasha were draped across one another in the loveseat, while Sam sat alone in his laz-e-boy chair. Thor, Steve, Tony, Pepper, and Peter were curled together on the couch, snuggling into the comfortable leather while Bruce, Clint, Wanda, and Pietro leaned against their legs on the floor.
different from how he felt with the other Avengers, he trusted that this
” Her voice took a bit of an airy tone, so Tony flickered her in the ear. “Ow! What was that for?”
It was safe to say that Steve wasn’t handling his kidnapping well.
Thor, on the other hand, was loud and boisterous. He was eager to learn and quick to give praise. They settled into playing a few games of dice and cards when Tony found two sets of each in a cupboard. He detailed his presentation for tomorrow, and let Bruce question him so that he would be fully prepared to defend his AI. After a few hours at the Avengers’ warehouse, it became increasingly apparent that this would be the end of Tony’s mission.
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony blinked a few times and stretched, wincing as the movement caused a dull ache to flare up. Before he could think to look for some of his medication, a soft knock sounded at the door, and it opened slowly to reveal Steve. “G’morning,” Tony drawled, exhaustion clear in his voice.
Tony’s eyebrows shot up, and he looked up at his rescuer carefully. “Uh, what?”
“We can’t call Cap, he’ll be busy with the bar.”
“That’s it, look at you. I can’t wait to touch you, Tony. I’m going to make you scream, make you beg. You’ll be writhing by the time I get you worked up, by the time I get my mouth on you. Can you picture it? My mouth, my lips, my tongue, sucking you dry?” Tony whimpered at the filthy whispers Rogers spun next to Tony’s ear, his sweet breath so hot and deliciously close. His hand made a dirty slapping sound as it flew over his length. “Or maybe we’ll start with you on your knees. Your gorgeous mouth wrapped so tightly around my cock, your throat opening up to take everything I gave you. Would you like that?”
Tony chewed on the inside of his cheek and stuffed the piece of circuitry back into his pocket. “I-You didn’t have to get me anything to eat. The coffee is more than enough.”
With Clint’s help, he was repositioned to the side of the bed where his legs could hang off the side and touch the floor. Clint ran his fingers through Tony’s hair, sorting through the curly strands. “Cap asked if I could give you a haircut too. What do you say? I promise not to shave it all off.”
Bruce was anxiously pacing in front of the warehouse doors when Clint buzzed him on a private communication line.
“Bruce, what did you find?” Steve asked, a sickening feeling worming its way into his stomach. He had already pushed up from his chair, leaning his knuckles against the wood in front of him.
And now, it seemed like they finally agreed that he was.
Howard was the worst, no surprise there. He was jealous of Tony’s exceptional mind, for his prowess in engineering, computers, and robotics. At the age of four, Tony had already built a completely functioning circuit board. When he excitedly rushed to show his father on Christmas morning, Howard sneered, wrenched the device from his hands and threw it into the roaring fireplace along with the slowly burning logs. Howard watched as Tony’s eyes filled with tears at the act of cruelty, and chastised him for being weak by putting his cigarette out on Tony’s arm.
Thirty minutes later, they pulled up to a decent sized condo and Steve shouldered Tony’s overflowing backpack again before taking his hand. Tony wanted to rip it away and demand that Steve explain what the hell they were doing here, but it would be like talking to a brick wall.
It's funny, because I don't usually like to READ angst because it makes me nervous, but I can't seem to stop writing it....
Wet tears pooled against the fabric on Steve’s chest, and he continued reassuring Tony with soft musings, professions of love, and promises of safety until he felt steady breathing, indicating that Tony had finally slipped under again.
“I need you to trust me for just a bit longer, Tony. Please.”
Tony had heard enough. He closed his eyes, counting how long it had been since Stane had taken him and comparing it to the time he knew it took to track his cell phone. The Avengers couldn’t be far behind. And then the man who was the source of so much pain, who betrayed him and killed his parents, would
Tony swallowed heavily. “Like you did me. I didn’t want to be here, and yet…” He gave a light wave of his hand before dropping it onto the table.
Tension swirled around in the room, and Bucky watched him with darkened eyes. He didn’t say anything for a few long moments, and when he did, the soldier crouched down in front of Tony so that they were at eye level. “We will protect you, Stark, and find whoever brought your name to Hydra. You don’t need to worry about that.” Bucky hesitated for a moment. “But everything you’re feeling right now? That anger and heartache? It’s only going to hurt you. Your parents are shitty people, and they hurt you in a way no parent should ever hurt a child. But that bitterness is going to hold you back from living your life, from moving forward.”
Tony didn’t even try to stop the pleased smile that played at his lips, though he did turn in the passenger seat so that Thor couldn’t see him. “Thanks, Steve. I feel prepared.” He squirmed a little bit. “Did everything go okay last night? Thor said it did, but I’m still worried.”
cursed.
slowly seeping out of him like a deflating balloon. The cold hardness in his eyes was replaced by the familiar soft cerulean, so full of love, affection, and guilt that Tony was momentarily floored.
“I’m the boyfriend, I get to see it first.”
“Stay out of that mess, okay? I need you safe while I’m over here.”
Thor nodded his understanding, wincing a little when Tony squawked. “
to. He saved our lives, one way or another, but never expected anything in return.”
Steve didn’t move underneath the covers with the young genius, choosing to rather sit on the edge of the bed and tuck Tony in. He moved his damp hair out of his eyes, promising himself that he would ask Clint to give Tony a haircut tomorrow. Steve leaned down and pressed a light kiss to his temple, whispering, “I’ll be right outside the door when you wake up. Call for me, and I’ll hear you. I love you.” He didn’t get a response back, because Tony was already blissfully asleep, and Steve was able to breathe for the first time in a week.
