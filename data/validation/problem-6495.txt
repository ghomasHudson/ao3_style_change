The journey up to Steve’s floor felt like a decade as Tony watched the man engage in breathing techniques to stop himself from vomiting from the pain.
The next morning, Steve and Tony kept making sneaking glances in the other’s direction. Their work came second to instead shooting looks across at each other when they felt they had waited enough time since they last looked. The rest of the team could only roll their eyes and pretend they didn’t notice.
Steve nodded in understanding before he pushed Tony’s hands out the way as he was taking too long and unbuckled his own belt.
Looking up, he was about to open with his usual “Hi, what can I get you?” When his voice suddenly lodged itself in his throat.
“Is it really a good idea to put me and Stark together on this one? I heard Romanov had something she wanted help with and I really feel I’d be more suited for that.”
Steve peered down at his lap for a moment and swallowed thickly. For a brief moment Tony thought he’d screwed it all up and had missed his only chance with Steve but suddenly the man looked up at him and grabbed his hand.
They suddenly jumped as the silence of the room was harshly disrupted by the nurse bustling in with his latest dose of pain killers. His bright smile and conversation dissipated the heavy atmosphere of the room and allowed Steve to shake off these bizarre thoughts about his co-worker and place them, once again, to the back of his mind.
Tony stood up after a moment and, with a cocky smile to disguise the genuine emotion, announced, “Enough of the soppy stuff. It’s time to party!” The guests cheered and within minutes the music was blasting and people were already getting drunk.
The director left the room with the others following quickly. Steve, the last to leave, turned and gave an unsure wave to the scientists remaining in the room. He signed,
Tony shivered, “Sounds like that really shouldn’t be lawful.” He mouthed Steve’s bottom lip to try and elicit the noise again.
The detectives glanced back and forth to see who would have enough guts to complain in front of the other. Eventually, Steve couldn’t risk Stark painting him in a bad light so intervened first.
His muscles clenched and his brain suddenly stopped functioning as the orgasm hit him full force. Closing his eyes, he fell forward and rested his head against the man’s broad chest and the soldier held him up while chuckling gently.
The voice from the floor commented bitterly, “I don’t know what’s worse. Being arrested or having to watch you two flirt while it happens.”
It was happening again. He had been sat reading over a case file after dinner when he happened to check his social media only to find the majority of the office had embarked out for drinks after work without him. He’d already quashed the feeling of isolation and abandonment once today so another time wasn’t about to happen. Steve was a strong person but even the strongest of men could only handle so much social exclusion. He snapped the file shut and placed his face into his hands, rubbing his skin vigorously.
Steve was woken up by gentle touches on his abdomen and he blinked his eyes open to peer down at whatever was causing the tickling sensation. He saw Tony’s fingertips ghosting across his skin and paying particular attention to the serum-faded scars that littered his right side in particular. The soldier frowned until he looked down at Tony who was resting his head against Steve’s shoulder and was touching the scars with reverence and curiosity.
“I’m not… We’re not... Anything.”  The detective stuttered, uselessly. He’d known Sam since back in his army days and never once had he ever been able to slip a lie past him.
Steve was still floundering from being interrupted during his big reveal so luckily Natasha was there to step in. She lifted a file, “I needed to look back at an old case to check if it was related to the Parson case I’m looking into now. Steve said he had the case out recently so helped me find it.”
Fury didn't have time for their petty bickering so interrupted, "I put you two together for a reason so stop complaining and do your damn jobs!” On that he turned and marched out of the meeting room to his office across the main room where all their desks were arranged. This left Steve and Tony standing p beside each other peering at the ground awkwardly. Their eyes met as they both began scanning the other.
"I'm afraid I don't know. Cap is a bit of a free spirit." He struggled to explain his friend's paranoid behaviour. But was it paranoid if he really was being watched? "You tell him where to be and you just have to trust he'll be there."
Lying on his side, injured shoulder in the air, he was able to balance the cell on the side of his head and fold his arms again. The caller must have heard his breathing because they began speaking.
He needed a taxi to take him home so he could re-disinfect his wound where his sudden movements had ripped the healing area a little in the edge. He had all the first aid supplies he would need for this simple process but most importantly, home had bed which is exactly where he'd want to be.
"How do you know it's him?" Stark asked, sipping his coffee and nodding down in attempted neutrality at the newspaper.
It was only after the initial adrenaline rush was over that Stark looked around to gauge who was injured. His eyes instantly stuck to Steve’s hunched over figure sat leaning against a wall. Nat was crouching beside him administering first aid and reminding him to breath. The darker haired man rushed over and gasped at the sight of blood trickling from Steve’s side.
This was not the plan. This was not the plan. Why couldn't oblivious targets act how he wished for once? Don't they know they're part of a bigger picture?! Well, no they don't and that's the point.
As it happened, Tony did not actually know where Steve lived but thank the Gods for their extensive employee database he had access to.
He rushed up the stairs and was nearly at his door when there was a click of the lock and he mentally cursed his life. The old lady from across the hall shuffled out with a warm smile. He tried to smile back but the wound was draining all the happiness from his heart.
Despite what the others kept suggesting, Tony had actually fully realised his feelings towards Rogers had developed beyond mere friends. He wasn’t as emotionally stunted as they all believed. Stark lifted his fist until it was only millimetres away from the wood of the door but he couldn’t bring himself to knock. They’d been back from the mission for over an hour now and Steve had occupied Tony’s mind for every second of that. The Captain had sustained some hard blows and, from where he was watching from the relative safety of the suit, Tony knew the man would be left pretty beaten up. It took every fibre to his being to stop himself running straight to Steve’s room as soon as he was out of the suit.
His dark car was hidden several roads away in a back alley away from prying eyes. The streets were silent at this time in the morning with only the sound of a busy road far off in the distance. He skidded around the corner and smashed straight into his own car. He flew over the hood of the car, hurting his side as he made contact with his definitely moving vehicle. The brakes squealed but it was unnecessary as the assassin already had his hand-gun out and was wrenching the passenger door open. Gun first, he leapt in.
“He doesn’t want to do it.” Tony was trying not to raise his voice at Fury but he wasn’t particularly good at keeping a level head.
Natasha's red hair hung around her bowed head like a veil; it shielded her face from the same around her. Behind the cover her eyes were rapidly scanning an article with her knuckles tight around the easily ripped paper. The further she read the increasingly negative her reaction became which was exactly why Tony was so confused when he entered their shared kitchen of the tower.
“So?” Nat encouraged as she flipped through some random files. He eyes scanned the irrelevant information in an impressive display of her acting skills.
“Wait! Is that a break up?” He shouted after the man, raising his voice to ensure the leaving man could still hear him. His arch-nemesis just addressed him by his name and he wasn’t about to let that be ignored, “I’ll just set my Facebook profile to ‘it’s complicated’! ... Yeah? Steve?” It was only when he turned to get into the car that he realised he’d driven them both there, “Do you not want a lift?” After a few moments of silence he murmured to himself, “Okay, a clean break. I totally get it.”
The room was large but felt warmer than the corridor due to the warm colored woods, rugs and bookshelves lining the walls. Would could imagine the room before the furniture but it wouldn’t have been a pretty sight. Behind the desk was a large window that overlooked what would have originally been the work-floor as it was a huge open room that, even today, had rows of tables and equipment lying around.
“Yeah but I can also see how upset you are that your date went wrong. You can’t expect me to believe that you don’t care about this!” Nat lectured in between sips of soothing tea, “You like him and if I were you I wouldn’t ruin it by clinging onto his mistakes. Stark has never been in a relationship that isn’t just sex so he doesn’t know how to act either.”
“I just don’t feel like Stark takes it seriously… at all. He’s always cracking jokes when he’s supposed to be working and messing with people. That's without mentioning how he flirts with everything that moves!"
Tony followed the man’s lead and shuffled around awkwardly until he could look into the blue eyes, “I can’t stop thinking about stuff. The case, the precinct, this… situation.” He glanced down at the space in between them. There was hardly six inches of space separating them and making them two individual forms.  Tony frowned at the direction of his thoughts and mentally pushed back against them. His feelings for Steve had been growing rapidly over the last few months but he knew that Steve could never feel the same for a jackass like him.
They entered the lab and proceeded to fall into an argument and Steve knew he’d regret participating in it later. Steve said stuff he knew he would regret and Stark gave just as good as he got. When the soldier finally left he felt like nothing had been sorted or established. The only thing he knew was that he didn’t like Tony Stark and that Tony Stark didn’t like him.
She left to fetch water and towels to mop him up while they waited for the doctor to come and make his assessments. It stung as she wiped away the majority of the debris and softly she apologized every time he took a sharp inhale of breath.
The taller man tried to make conversation a couple of times over breakfast but failed after a couple of sentences as Tony was proving to be an unwilling participant. The two ate their breakfasts and drank their coffee in an awkward silence. Steve kept glancing up at his companion, worried he’d done something to upset the man.
“Oh no,” Clint cackled out between laughs, “I’m not laughing at Steve. I’m laughing at you.” He suddenly went deadpan, “I think you need to think carefully about what you’re doing. You’re Tony Stark, playboy extraordinaire. If you hurt Steve in anyway you know we’ll be all over your ass.”
"What the fuck! Are you okay? What was that?" Tony rambled out, shocked at the piercing sound of gunfire. The genius had only ever associated that noise with bad news, following which he'd usually have to run away. There was a slight sound of quick movement on Steve's end.
"Eh, with you moving up in the world why would you come visiting a little nobody like me?" Steve joked again, chuckling.
Footsteps approached, Bruce was running back to find out what held them up. Luckily, he hadn’t yet transformed into the Big Guy so he was able to fetch his friends.
“Look out! Shit storm coming to land!” He watched as Hulk, Clint and Natasha all peered up and dashed away from the falling debris.
They exited the office and headed further along the dingy corridor until they came to a another door that allowed them access to the production floor. Tony used the journey as a chance to question Steve slightly more.
Steve had always read that when people woke up in a hospital the sound of beeping machines, nurses shoes squeaking or the voice of a crying loved one was always what greeted them from unconsciousness. For Steve, it was the sharp smell of disinfectant that let him know where he was. He could also feel a hand grasping his tightly which reassured him since he had yet to figure out why he was in hospital.
Already regretting his brains inability to keep quiet, Tony lowered his head to prevent Steve from getting a good look at his face, “When I asked for your name you said ‘Just Steve’... it was a joke.”
The gun was hot in his hand but he didn't have time to wait around. He dissembled it quickly with a few swift movements and slipped it into the dark duffle bag before slinging it over his shoulder. He needed to get out quickly before someone walked in to find a master assassin packing away his weapon. That would be a little more than just awkward.
Despite the crackly quality to the recording, the voice was still undeniably dripping with charisma as it spoke, “Thank you, Detective. I’m very much looking forward to seeing you again.” You could nearly picture the eyes roaming up and down Stark’s body, or at least Tony could.
Steve’s mouth fell open as he gazed around at the flashing billboards and modern cars. Blue eyes took it all in thoroughly but a part of him was still in disbelief. His tongue darted out to moisten his dry lips, an anxious habit he’d never managed to break.
Deciding he needed a distraction, Steve ripped the blanket from himself and, without consciously thinking of it, found himself padding down the stairs and into the shared floor of the tower in hopes of finding something to keep his mind off the dark.
The soldier nodded even though he knew Tony could probably read the nervousness in his face. The inventor turned to the crowd.
However, at this moment the homeowner strolled back into his living room, forcing Clint to shuffle back the hide most of his body around the wall. He kept his eyes glued to the person though. He was definitely the target. Who could forget that blond hair and bulging muscles from the ID picture. The man was wrapping his forearm in bandage while wincing. Clint now had the evidence to suggest this man was the assassin he'd beed hired to kill. He pulled his handgun out of its holder and waited.
Tony felt pleased with himself as he drank down every trace and worked Steve through his orgasm. The soldier laid back with his eyes closed and chest heaving to catch his breath.
Despite the doctor’s uncertainty regarding the re-establishment of his leg, Steve knew he’d jump at any opportunity of potentially getting his leg back and getting back to the war with his men. He’d felt bad leaving them. Besides, he had just been told that his body was still fighting a possible fatal infection so surely his sickly body could use all of the help it could get.
He was in pain but he didn’t feel much different physically. The fog in his brain made it harder for him to work out what had happened and the men on beds either side of him were both asleep and not a nurse in sight. He swallowed thickly but his dry throat made the action uncomfortable.
The shorter detective lowered his mouth further down until his lips brushed the base of the shaft, taking the whole of Steve’s impressive size into his mouth before humming encouragingly. His own member was pressing up with increasing discomfort as Steve’s reactions were doing all sorts to the heat in his lower stomach.
"That'll be fantastic." Sarcastically, his words flowed from his mouth. He turned away and began to leave but first threw over his shoulder, "Hopefully that won't inconvenience his majesty too much."
The genius sat opposite him and stared at the soldier until he realised that he wasn’t about to be thanked. Frowning he confronted the man, “I do a fucking good deed and you act like I’m still just trash that someone left on your lawn.” He was used to praise and reward for his actions. That’s how Pepper had taught him to behave himself.
Stark smiled as if he knew something Steve didn’t, “Come on, let’s catch up. They have no chance without us.” Despite his words, he held Steve for a couple of moments longer and peered up into his blue eyes.
Steve felt a squeeze around his hand just before they walked through the door which caused him to peer across gratefully to his partner. They smiled before dropping hands and entering the room. Today wasn’t the day to reveal their relationship when it was all so new.
A nurse hissed as he was brought to her. Her inhale of breath didn’t reassure Steve in the slightest.
The power shut off with a dull winding down tone. Tony, who’s chest Steve was currently laying on, tightened his grip on his partner aware that it could trigger a bad reaction.
Steve took the boy by the hand and led him out of the door whilst signing to Tony to find the mom because he had just decided that he was taking them out for ice cream. Turns out the boy had wasted no time in telling his new friend about how much he loved strawberry ice cream. Tony found the mom easily and led her back to meet Steve.
He was mulling over the lack of danger in the room when his eyes fell upon Steve sprawled, on his stomach, on his large king size bed completely naked. Tony blinked rapidly, realising that this was the very first time he’d seen his crush completely without clothes and he definitely wasn’t disappointed. He blinked a couple more times before snapping himself out of the trance and running over to the man to check he was actually breathing. The man was littered with bruises and scratches so there was nothing to prove he was still alive. He held his cheek close to Steve’s mouth until he could feel gentle breath. Relieved, he nodded and backed away. He closed the door gently, ensuring that the click of the door handle wouldn’t wake the man.
The man burst in with Steve only inches behind him. The scientist peered around and began to ask something.
"When is he going to do it?" He asked, turning straight back to business, "Does your Cap know we are waiting on him? We can't infiltrate the laboratories until Professor Wright has been dealt with."
“I believe so, Sir.” Rogers responded gratefully. He always forgot that in this day and age it was no longer a character fault to be a gay man anymore. The other detectives and staff would undoubtedly follow Captain Fury’s lead of acceptance and support.
We find out how Steve’s assassination panned out but he definitely will not reveal that information to Tony Stark.
“Well, maybe you need to be the one to break the ice?” Nat suggested as she shuffled the pages to pretend to be searching for a certain detail.
“And I’m sorry for how I acted afterwards... I realise now that I had completely misjudged you and it was so wrong of me.” He flushed in his shame.
The clouds had dumped the worst of the rain in the 10 minutes they were running and the sun was now beginning to win over. The two men stepped back out to the street.
“Didn’t think?! You didn’t think?! That’s your problem, Stark! You never think through the consequences of you actions!” His face was flushing red with passion and he went to snap some more but stopped himself, “I can’t… I just can’t deal with this.”
30 minutes later they were a decent way into Dirty Dancing. Steve said he liked how it was closer to his time as it was set in the 60s and when the dancing scenes came on he would hold his hand to the speaker to feel the beat. When they weren’t signing or feeling the beat, the two men would sit with their fingers interlocked.
Steve rolled his eyes again, a motion a found himself expressing several times a day when around Stark,
Steve couldn’t help but grin. He stepped over to his husband and grinned down at him until Stark grabbed hold of his tie and tugged gently to bring them closer. Steve followed along, pressing their lips together but he couldn’t control his smile.
Natasha was in a bad mood. Not only did she have 4 more weeks before the only person she actually liked in this precinct returned from his recovery but also her case had essentially gone belly up as she had wasted so much time following a false lead. It wasn’t easy to make Natasha Romanov feel like the fool but these crooks had successfully done so. She directed her scowl at her dark coffee as she leaned against the counter in the break room. Little did she know her day was about to be made significantly brighter by hearing a single piece of information.
He squinted into the technology and managed to get his fingers amongst the wires and pistons. He found the solution almost immediately; a wire had gotten wrapped around the mechanism that pushed the leg back into a straight position after it bent to take a step. He wiggled them apart and re-tested the movement. It was now smooth like it was designed to be but being this close up Stark could identify several components that could be altered or upgraded. His mind was already whirring at potential changes he could make in his lab and the thought of having such a worthwhile project excited him.
Steve answered, They offered to get a translator but it would take them a couple of days to get the person cleared or whatever they do so I said not to bother. Agent Coulson has learnt the basics but I’m asking questions about the mission and he’s answering with the question “where is bus stop”. I prefer writing it out anyways. Much more personal.
A couple of mornings later, Tony was actually on time for the first time in his entire career. He sat at his desk waiting for praise from his co-workers. Despite this, they ignored him in an attempt to deflate his over-inflated ego. He crossed his arms and pouted in defiance.
He snatched up the phone and answered before his mind could keep track enough to preplan his speech, "The genius Tony Stark speaking?" He'd meant it humorously but his tone had definitely not conveyed that intention and he was partly glad when he heard the slurred, slow response.
Tony rolled his eyes and slouched back in his chair. The rest of the team looked just as surprised at Tony’s sudden ASL skills. Steve could see that they were bombarding him with questions but instead he turned to face Steve.
Opening up the computer on his desk, he did everything in his power to distract himself from the empty desk which stood cold and dull across the room; they hadn’t yet managed to replace Steve as most the applicants hadn’t managed to fill the large shoes Steve had left behind him. The flashing of an email icon on his screen drew his eyes away from the desk and back onto his work.
A fat raindrop splattered in the corner of his eye as he peered up into the increasingly dark storm clouds. Large puddles spread across the street, constantly rippling from the torrent of water descending from the sky. He hoped it would ease up soon as it was making the butterflies in his stomach increase tenfold. These were not exactly ideal conditions, especially for a newbie.
Her eyes slid up to his, "Well, in that case, you're looking at the handy work of our latest teammate." Natasha folder her arms and leant back in her chair to watch for signs of shock and astonishment which didn't come, "You're not surprised?"
“I’ve only been on bed rest for a week and a half but by this point, any face would do.” Despite his sarcastic comment a slight smile was beginning to spread across his face. Company was company, “Please, come on in.”
He jabbed a finger in Tony’s direction before turning on his heels and marching over the the light switches.
He tried not to take offence, he really did, but Steve was a loyal friend to him. To hear the man getting slated before even making an appearance was frankly insulting. Stone cold he stared into the man's one remaining eye, "He has never once let me down when I've needed him. Regardless of the situation." He turned sharply and strode off towards his quarters.
“Uh, yeah… I came to visit our brave and gallant hero!” He exclaimed in an unconvincing tone of enthusiasm.
Steve looked grateful that Tony’s presence allowed him to stop running and when he stopped the soldier whipped his hand away as though nothing was wrong. The genius wanted to roll his eyes at Steve’s macho antics; the remanence of his former military training was still firmly drilled into him.
“I came round like two hours ago but the house was all locked up. It waited for a while but got pretty soaked through in the rain so used the spare key you gave me. I was starting to worry about you since I know you were supposed to finish three hours ago.” Sam Wilson rushed out to explain.
At the briefing the next morning, Steve strode in as though nothing had happened. Tony surreptitiously eyed his walk and leg in an attempt to assess what happened with the man’s broken prosthetic. From Tony’s untrained eye it appeared as though SHIELD had quickly replaced or repaired the tech. It wasn’t exactly like they could have Captain America running around on crutches during a mission. He wasn’t sure if it was his over analysis or reality but it appeared as though Steve was walking with the slightest limp.
“Good. You’ll want to get as much peace as you can right now since I’ll soon be telling the team that you kept me awake all night with your moaning.” Steve could see the cheeky smirk as Tony laughed at his own sexual implication.
Barton picked up his speed as he got closer to the building and slipped down the alley way next to it. He peered up, whilst shielding his eyes from the rain, at the metal steps ascending the side of the building. He found a trash can abandoned nearby and used it as a boost for him to jump off. His fingers snagged the rusty metal of the ladder and proceeded to haul himself onto the first level. Clint huffed out a breath.
He pulled out the needle and injected himself instantly. The pain medication began to thrum around his body like angel tears or something. He yawned as morphine always made him sleepy so dragged himself to his bedroom where he collapsed down on his bed and drifted off instantly.
She only managed to say, “Captain Rogers…” before a couple of men marched in to sedate him. Instantly springing to action, he threw them against the wall but they tore straight through which revealed the set up. He leapt through the hole he’d punched with their bodies and marvelled at how the prosthetic leg caught his shifting weight. The old leg would have buckled under the pressure of the leap and his quick movements but this one was close to natural.
So I've already got 11,000 words for this story but have just realised that I hate the direction it's going in so I'm changing it! Be patient more is coming!
Tony’s eyes followed after him but he didn’t move for a while longer. Could he possibly be destined to hurt Steve?
“And can this individual confirm your whereabouts and lack of contact with the media?” Fury asked, his disposition unchanged and his tone unflinching. This caused Steve’s gaze to shoot up in a mix of surprise and confusion, “Well? Can he?”
“The storm has caused a power cut.” The soldier provided but had to confine in Tony further when the engineer frowned and leant his head in confusion, “I... I have a lamp I keep on by my bed but there’s no power...” He recognised that he sounded pathetic but he’d only just avoided a panic attack so had no energy to maintain a macho exterior. He’d never been so personal with Stark.
“This is going to be a messy one.” Her Scottish accent was somewhat soothing to him, “Can you open your eyes, dearie?”
Steve was just glad Tony would be able to get his sexual tension out with someone. Even if it wasn’t him. He kissed him gently.
Despite some of his past actions and mistakes, Tony wasn’t stupid but actually quite the opposite. He knew that Rogers would begin to interweave truth with lies to  blend them together and conceal better. It was a typical charade that all Detective’s are taught to be aware of during their training as criminals could be just as smart as the Detectives questioning them. Although, Stark was smarter than most as he had finished school early and entered the Academy a couple of years early so he hoped he’d be at an advantage.
When the door closed behind him over an hour later, Tony blinked in the bright winter sun and felt blindsided by the experience. The building seemed too good to be true but every piece of legitimate paperwork he had requested Steve had produced quickly and without hesitation. He’d taken copies to double check at the station but he knew by now that he wouldn’t get anything on Rogers from that. The criminal must have some contact in the government to acquire such authentic documents or maybe he had really just fooled the US government as well as he did with Tony today. The only difference was that Tony walked into that building knowing that it would all be an illusion whereas how many people set up fake charities?
Steve’s soft smile shifted across his lips as he watched Tony finish off the translation and begin fielding questions.
He hadn’t opened his eyes yet as the rocking of the stretcher jarred his body, sending shots of increased pain through him. The panicked voices of the men saturated the usually quiet air. For some reason it brought to mind a swarm of bees gathering in defence of their hive with their buzzing being extraordinarily loud.
Steve smiled and nodded before burying his head into the crook of his partner’s neck. He was too sleepy to plough through a conversation right now. They hadn’t exactly slept much since being together.
“Good afternoon, Deputy Rogers.” Tony smiled while giving a lazy salute in his partner’s general direction.
Steve remained mostly silently throughout the briefing and Tony was similarly quiet as he spent the majority of the time covertly watching the other man. The rest of the team easily picked up on the strange tension that had subdued the pair’s usual dynamic of bickering like children.
The blond man then left. He packed his things from Tony’s room and left the tower. The genius didn’t try to stop him or convince him otherwise; he could see that Steve had been hurt one too many times to just throw out a promise he didn’t know if he could keep. He wouldn’t ask for the man back until he could be certain he could stand by it.
Steve managed a chuckle, despite the humor coming from a man he never thought he’d like, “I guess I could probably try another few hours.”
Quite an argument had been woven around the situation and Tony just wanted to please Steve in anyway possible, “I’ll do it if it makes you happy but if you even have an ounce of a second thought let me know and it’ll be like it never happened.” He felt unsettled as he agreed it.
But she knew that mentioning this to Clint would be a mistake. He was surprisingly protective over his mentor. He would kill Stark before allowing the man to get his grubby hands all over his Assassin-Mother.
The soldier sat opposite Tony but turned his chair to face the area where Fury would be talking to avoid eye contact. Miscommunication was running rampant as Steve thought Tony pitied him for his leg and Tony thought that Steve was just being a cold ass despite his attempts to help him.
He squinted at her for a moment, trying to assess whether he was supposed to understand anything she was saying, "Good thing you don't work in a team because you're a terrible communicator... Oh wait, you do." Stark teased lightly.
“Firstly, I want to welcome back detective Stark.” Fury began when he made it to the wooden podium. He rested his large hands against the sides of the tower and leant forward, “We also wish Detective Rogers the best in his further endeavours but I’m sure Stark will keep us up to date with his progress.” He nodded in an uncharacteristically soft movement.
With a nod Stark took off to join the others. Moments later Steve was following on foot and he’d be there shortly now that his leg was working smoothly. Thanks to Tony’s quick adjustments, the mission was a success as Steve had managed to get in there and manage the team like he knew was best.
Steve looked away as the heat of his embarrassment increased, turning his cheeks bright beet red, “I’m sorry. I really should have said something instead of just attacking you like that.”
He leant forward until their foreheads touched and he took a deep breath, “I got to a bar and I couldn’t stop thinking about you. Every person I looked at were just so unattractive just because they weren’t you. I love you and the thought of being intimate with anyone who isn’t you just isn’t right. And I know you don’t like sex and I’m perfectly okay with that. Snuggling with you is a thousand times better than a night with a stranger. You’re my everything so don’t feel like you need to sort me out. You are enough.” He allowed their lips to bump together before they kissed properly. He ran his fingers through his partner’s hair, “I should never have agreed to it in the first place.”
Suddenly, he stopped and peered around at the unfamiliar world around him. Could so much change in his short time abroad? His chest was heaving more due to the sudden surprise rather than physical exertion.
His new leg was made of wood and leather so was heavy but with Steve’s new strength it didn’t pose much of a challenge for him. The joint was rudimentary and hard to manoeuvre but Steve didn’t want to complain. The doctor promised to develop a high tech prosthetic to make it easier for Steve in the field and he knew that technology was always offering new opportunities.
In shock, he took an eager step forward to feel the world on his new, pain and sickness free body. However, with his first step he suddenly collapsed onto the ground. People swarmed him to help him up but not before he’d gotten a glance at the stump that remained begrudgingly on the end of his right thigh. He sighed heavily but realised that with his health now intact he could cope with an amputated leg as the rest of his body was fit enough to adapt.
The trees around them rustled in the light summer breeze which, while pleasant against his warm cheek, made it harder to listen out for enemies nearby. His unit followed closely, copying his lead. He had successfully navigated the majority of this French forest without being spotted or fired at which meant that he was counting the mission as 99% completed. Just the last stretch before they are in the clear which led to their camp. He could almost taste the cots and fires around the corner.
“And when I became interested in you I knew that you often disregard those rules.  If you weren’t who you are I wouldn’t have… become interested in you. I like you for you even if that means you sometimes go against my morals.” He explained in a stuttering and unusually ineloquent manner.
Steve laughed softly, he rubbed his hand through his hair, “Never been the type for that much clothes in bed actually.” He flushed as he suddenly realised how that sounded, “Anyway, why didn’t you just tell me?”
The team had moved in only a week ago and Steve could tell that Stark didn’t want to invite him but saw him as a side effect of having Bruce, Natasha and Clint. If he had any other option he wouldn’t have moved in but, as a newbie to the 21st century, he had no choice.
“A freak?” Tony cried out, he leapt off the couch to instead kneel in front of Steve. He grabbed his his hands in his, “You’re completely normal! You’re asexual.”
Fury looked down on the man with his cold eyes, “I think it’s about time you got back to saving the world, don’t you?”
It was the sheer frustration of not knowing that forced Stark’s eyes open and he had to lift his head a fraction to see the other man. An eyebrow raised as he was confronted with a sight he wasn’t particularly prepared for:
Clint licked his lower lip as if forcing himself to take the time to breath and not snap back, "I'll send him a reminder."
Tony stood and nodded in response. Rogers came close to him and rested a gentle touch against his lower arm and a smile grew on his lips. The cop was looking down at the contact in confusion until he looked up into the blue eyes and his heart skipped a beat. Back at the office they often played games about who had arrested the most attractive criminal and Tony knew that the day he got the mob boss would be the day he would win and would never be beaten.
, Tony pulled the man out of bed and dragged him through to the kitchen. He liked to make eggs for them in the morning and Steve always loved his cooking.
It was several sweaty hours (and several drinks) later, Steve was having the best time. He and his new friend were dancing, drinking and they’d made out a few times but Steve wouldn’t be telling anyone about that tomorrow. The feeling of being relaxed and free was strumming through his body when suddenly, he felt someone tap on his shoulder. He span to see Detective Stark smirking up at him with his arms crossed. The taller man open and closed his mouth several times, goldfish-like.
Steve was just finishing up in the gym. He’d removed his prosthetic leg and was stretching out his muscles on the mats. Sweat glistened across his exposed back and torso. He hardly even noticed the scars marking his skin now that so much had happened to him. His brain was too busy dealing with the present rather than the past.
"Oh shit. You're on a job right now?" Everything was clicking together for the genius. "Where are you? I'll come and get you."
He took one step into the room and froze, frowning at the usually emotionless spy. Seeing her expressing anything just felt so wrong. He stepped towards her quietly and, despite her usual ability, her anger had clouded her senses meaning she was unaware of his presence until he was only a meter away.
Then Tony moved. The energy he had repressed since the case being unlocked meant that he couldn’t stop so he leapt forward to lock their lips together. Steve’s body reacted immediately, leaning forward into Tony’s embrace and kissing him back with passion.
Steve’s ears followed the sound until his eyes adjusted to the room and he noticed Tony huddled at the table with a small flickering candle and some sort of science text spread open. The genius was squinting against the low light to read his paper but his eyes were currently looking concerned in Roger’s direction.
Stark’s head lifted minutely from the pillow but barely wasted a glance on the damage, “Don’t worry, someone will come and repair it today.” The genius lowered his head back down and closed his eyes, “You’re not seriously getting up now, are you? You’re body probably needs a rest after last night. Not to mention, I’d appreciate another couple of hours.”
“Until recently everyone assumed you were a prude but I saw the way you were grinding with that guy.” He said with a chuckle, “I’d like to say we had bets placed on this but nobody believed this could happen.”
Moments later a nurse came skidding around the corner; clearly responding to Stark’s frantic calls. She peered down at Steve and smiled to him. He prepared to tell her that he was deaf so couldn’t understand her when she suddenly raised her hands.
"In there." Steve pointed so Wright would enter before him. Positioning was key in an operation like this.
Tony's eyebrows furrowed. He remained silent for a few seconds to allow for the Spy to rectify his statement but only silence filled the room.
Steve leant back to distance himself from the fumes. As he was doing it, he had to repeatedly remind himself that this guy had been murdering innocent people and planning to murder many more to test his drugs and nuclear weapons. Shield had dug up more dirt but Steve honestly didn't want to know it all. He’d rather do his job and move on.
Steve, not fighting, stated dully, “Tony, this is an abuse of your power. If Captain Fury finds out about this you’ll be in serious trouble.”
Without even opening his eyes, Steve rolled them dramatically but couldn't help the way the corners of his lips twitched up, "I thought I'd shaken you off my tail."
"Wright!" He cried, already tugging the man towards the corridor leading out of the large hall in simulate urgency, "Quickly! Your wife. There has been an accident!"
Creeping up the stairs, he moved silently but with efficient speed until he met the only lit window; it wasn't exactly bizarre that it was alone as it was past 3am. He peered inside and haltered. The room was small but definitely didn't look as he'd been picturing inside his head for an apparent assassin. A small couch and coffee table sat in front of a small television which was positioned beside a large bookcase stuffed with novels. A baseball cap, sporting the local teams colors, was hooked over the top edge of the case. There must have been a mistake.
The questions went on in a similar vein for a while longer until they were nearly at the end. He answered about his recovery, the mission, his team and, obviously, his deafness. Tony’s translations were growing slower and Steve himself was beginning to feel weary as they were approaching an hour. He permitted a couple more questions before they left and he was forever glad that they did those extra.
Steve slapped away his hand and bitterly spat, “Stark, I’m fine. Don’t start acting like you care now.” Shakily, with Natasha’s hands supporting him, Rogers pushed himself up onto his feet whilst leaning heavily against the wall. Tony peered up at him from where he was still kneeling on the floor, unsure of how he could ever make this right.
Steve couldn’t help but allow his mouth to twitch slightly. A doctor once told him that he wouldn’t live beyond the age of 12 and now here he was nearly 70 years later. All it took was a little help.
Steve adjusted himself in the seat, clutching his side, "What about you though? I thought you'd sold your soul to a corporation?... Oh no, are they after me?" He joked, darkly.
“Tony, I’ve been in the hospital before and Nat was the only one to visit. What’s different now?” The raise of his eyebrow brushed a sense of guilt onto Tony’s conscious. Despite them being equals in position Tony had always felt like Steve was destined to be a captain and therefore somehow deserved more respect than himself.
With his lights blaring, Tony darted through traffic to try and make up for the time he’d wasted contemplating Steve and the man’s physically ability to just sit in a cop car. Detective Rogers was a very competent and intelligent officer so Tony rolled his eyes at the protective moment he just experienced. Steve was definitely hiding the fact he was gripping the side of his chair as Tony’s vigorous driving was knocking with his wound. He, however, had begged to come so as a man of honor he would not complain to Tony. The ten minutes it took for them to get from Steve’s apartment to the crime scene was a decade in Steve’s mind. Their brakes screeched to a halt, smoke emanating from the rubber.
The spy slipped out the door and was out the building in mere minutes. Tony peered around the room and sighed. He really wished Cap had at least stayed for a little while.
"Of course it was, dearie." Her watery eyes peered up and down his body. Making a clear comment of his outfit. She winked.
Steve was barely awake when his cell began chiming beside his head. He was tempted to just ignore it with the fuzz of morphine still present in his brain but something about the call felt urgent. He picked it up, opened the call and placed it beside his ear.
Steve’s eyes struggled to follow Tony’s lips as they moved at an impossibly fast pace but amongst the silence he could see, I love you. The billionaire stared deep into his eyes.
He didn’t know whether he was pleased they didn’t have work tomorrow or wished they were forced together to allow him to apologise.
"That's Clint. He's always been a primadonna. You get a paper cut and he'll already be calling 911."  The large man sighed against the soft pillows behind his back, "He puts on a tough exterior but he's soft as a puppy on the inside."
“Okay, will I need a notepad?” Characteristic cheeky smile in place, Tony settled down on the bed opposite his new partner.
He decided to breach the topic that night at dinner but now he just have to decide about how to go about it.
“Steve?” Fury asked without much conviction. Rogers was the best detective they had in New York and twice as dedicated than any other officer. The idea of him actually leaking information to anyne was practically laughable. In fact, some staff at the back were stifling a chuckle at the thought of Steve doing anything that wasn’t 100% by the book.
"Doctor Aaron Yepsem." The name flowed off his tongue easily. He was essentially a professional liar and had become adept at it over the years.
He passed a (probably wrong) latte across the counter to a woman in a business suit before sliding back up to the cash register. He allowed himself a second to wipe the counter before glancing up at the customer to get their order.
He dropped back into his seat panting while his side protested it's existence, "Clint. I should have known. You literally tried to kill me, you little shit." He used to hate swearing but after so long surrounded by murderers and assassins you tend to just pick it up.
Steve frowned and peered up at the Detective as though he was gazing at an alien with several heads, “Why?”
Tony knelt down in front of his teammate, his hands hovered over the metal leg as his eyes scanned the device. It was more advanced than most you’d find in public use as obviously SHIELD had obtained the very best for one of their key weapons. Tony hoped that he’d be able to get a proper look at it soon as he was very much intrigued by its inner workings.
He wasn’t focused enough to try and not look pathetic when he scurried over to the low light of the candle and get as close as he could. Once he was situated by the light source he could feel the nightmares of the war drift further away and he could try to respond to Stark as a normal person.
As always, Tony fell off first and was snoring within minutes. Luckily, Steve couldn’t hear it to complain.
His mind briefly flicked across the fact that the amputation would have pretty much been a death sentence for him either through infection or through his inability to continue his career.
“Are you a registered charity?” Tony had been presented with the lie so now he just had to work at unwinding it even if it meant testing each stitch one at a time.
It was only 20 minutes later that Tony emerged from the bedroom, his suit from the night before was creased as he’d not taken it off and he looked pretty disheveled from being up most of the night. He paced over the where Steve was sat at a table with a newspaper in front of him.
Tony’s mind wasn't able to follow what happened next but the next thing he was able to process was Steve’s lips on his. He’d turned and his back was leaning against the door which he was grateful for as the shock of it made his legs wobble. Steve’s large hand cupped Tony’s cheek and he used it to pull him closer. The blond man’s other hand was resting on the door beside Tony’s head so, for a moment, Tony’s world was Steve and Steve alone. It was intoxicating.
They sat mirror image, each at one end of the bed facing each other with their legs crossed underneath them. Steve looked unsure, despite Tony’s regular reassurances that it was totally normal, but Tony’s enthusiastic eagerness to learn helped dispel the worst of the anxiety.
Tony's phone buzzed a deep monotone as the assassin hung up on him for the last time. He peered down at his phone almost in shock. Maybe Cap was right, maybe he really didn't know him at all.
“It-It wasn’t me.” The man declared in an attempt to fix the damage done to his rapidly decreasing reputation. “I didn’t do anything.”
“Thought you’d give me a couple of days to settle in before you stopped by to say congratulations on the new job?” Stark smirked back. Despite Steve’s reputation he’d never been scared of the man even though he probably should be. It wasn’t everyday that you came face to face with a criminal alone in a dark alley.
"Wait, you know each other?!" Clint cried. Slightly disappointed that he couldn't just have a cool thing to himself for once. Someone always had to steal his thunder.
Clint was mad, steam coming from his ears mad, but he hadn't tried to murder Tony yet so it was a vast improvement on what he had expected. The archer paced the floor of the bedroom as he ranted, face going a slightly more alarming shade of red every second.
It seemed so bizarre to see such a large man, who usually stood over 6 foot and as a solid mass, collapsed on the bed in the dull apartment completely limp. One hand was still splayed over the bullet entrance hole but the life-saving pressure had been released a significant time ago. The man's eyes were closed but, in his unconsciousness, he seemed completely free from pain and worry despite the smears of blood on his handsome face. It had managed to spread everywhere; all over the assassin himself but also the dark bedsheets had been stained with it and a hand print shaped mark decorated the wall.
Tony got the feeling in his chest that he’d been played which he knew was almost certain before he entered but nobody like for it to be made so blatant.
Clint gave a huff, "I always said he was good." The spy undoubtedly knew that Steve only dumped the body here as a slight fuck you to Shield and their pushy demands. He'd slipped in undiscovered while hauling around a body. If that didn't give cause for Shield to up their security then what would?
He watched Tony for some time. His heart was swelling up with love and admiration as he glanced down at the gentleness of the other man.
Steve, on the other hand, wiggled out of his lover’s grasp to instead reach up and switch on the row of lights that still adorned his large kingsize bed. The bulbs released a warm yellow glow that chased away the darkness.
She had to physically restrain herself from rolling her eyes, “I’m pretty sure Steve would be more than happy to see you.”
Of course Steve knew about mines. They learned about them in basic training and it was difficult to be in the army for even one day without seeing the damage a mine could do. However, all the learning and knowledge behind mines goes completely out of the window when you trigger one.
Steve sent him a scathing look and pulled his arm away to continue pacing, "I'm currently running from a murder and you thinking helping people will convince me to join your band of Merry Men?"
Tony looked up at him but went back to mapping the pale wounds across the man’s body. He didn’t speak to allow Steve to explain.
“Please, let me come.” Begging, he needed out of his small apartment. Tony couldn’t exactly refuse an invalid, could he?
Every single head in the briefing room snapped around to stare at the confessing detective. It may not have been a confession over the leaked information but it certainly was a nugget of information that many of the employees in the room found more interesting. Under the weight if their gaze Steve lowered his head so his gaze could follow the gaps in between the tiles. He wasn’t ready to see the judgement in their eyes. He thought he already knew what he’d see: disappointment and disgust at the precinct’s most successful detective being homosexual.
“No seriously, look.” Stark pointed in the direction of the bar they were scouting out. They both watched as the old man with white hair spoke the secret entry password and entered the bar. They shared a look before jumping out of the car and running as fast as they could after the man.
He tried to imagine the sounds but whatever he could imagine would be miles off. He didn’t even though what ‘sound’ sounded like as he’d been deaf since birth. Suddenly, he realized that Stark was talking to him. How could he understand? But it then clicked that the man was signing at him and he’d just unconsciously read the symbols.
“Look, I just want to say-“ Tony began for what felt like the one hundredth time when the crackle of the radio interrupted him.
Tony rolled his eyes but knew that Clint wasn’t blowing him off. Dark brown eyes pleaded with the man, “I just want to make sure I’m making the right decision.”
Striding back to his desk, Tony was already thinking of the challenges that would lay in store over the next few weeks. He really wanted Steve and knew that anything to get more information would help.
Looking around, he realised that he wasn’t in the same place that he’d usually fall asleep on base. The golden light that streamed through the window also told him that he wasn’t his usual waking up time. It was suddenly that the radio piqued his interest as a crowd cheered over a baseball game. Slowly, it dawned on him that he had been in attendance on that day. He peered around suspiciously with the realisation that this could be a Hydra trap or something.
There were plenty movies out there that Tony liked but now that Steve didn’t want to watch Die Hard he wanted to watch them even more on principle. How could he be deprived of his favorite movie? He mumbled curses under his breath hoping that Steve couldn't see his lips.
When he looked back up to his partner he was shocked to see the man had a microphone in hand and a cheeky smile on his face.
They both perched on the couch together after Steve had provided coffee for them both. The fact Steve was still injured hadn’t occurred to Tony, in his moments of awkward social interaction, until Steve winced before lowering himself gently onto the cushions.
"But now we have to deal with a body." Natasha rolled her eyes. She complained as though it was a inconvenience but not a hardship.
Natasha nodded and peered at the man. She then turned to Clint with a slight smirk on her lips, "Your Captain is a genius. Not a single wound."
Clint suddenly burst out laughing and Tony couldn’t have been more angry. The inventor continued, “Don’t you dare laugh at him!”
He stood, braced in his 'stand-to-attention' military pose, with tight shoulders and cool eyes like stone. He wore his all black outfit he usually saved for when he was out working but today he was aiming for professional with a side of Don't-ask-me-anything. All in all he made a pretty impressive sight.
“What happened?” It wasn’t very often Steve turned up on her doorstep a mess; it had only occurred once in the whole time she had known the man. Her detective skills led her to believe that Stark had somehow messed up again since he always seemed to be doing that.
“Tony pretended to arrest me in front of a room full of people.” Steve mumbled out as he tried to dry off his shirt even though it was unsalvageable. She frowned in confusion, “It was an abuse of power and humiliating.”
Tony stepped away from the board and squared his shoulder in front of where Steve was sitting, “Look, Mr Perfect. I know this isn’t your case but if you could take your head out of your ass for once, that’d be great! The rest of us have cases too.” He folded his arms and mentally prepared himself for the backlash.
"He's a cocky bastard... I like him." Stark declared after a beat of silence from the team. It was clear the assassin didn't like Shield which was a quality the billionaire looked for in friends. Nobody mentioned the fact that Stark hadn’t been hiding his crush for the assassin very well.
“Nobody has to know. It can be between just you and me.” Stark stated, wiping their sweat and mess off the floor.
A smile began to curl up Barton's lips as he gazed up at his new mentor. This day could only get better; not being dead, getting a mentor and free breakfast!
Slowly Steve allowed his grin to grow comically large as he flicked the switch and the long row of string lights lit up immediately. Even in the morning sun he could see the little bulbs were powerful enough to keep the flashbacks at bay.
The nurse left after checking his vital signs and explaining everything she was doing all the way through. As she talked him though each of his injuries she didn’t draw attention to the constant tears. She placed a button in Steve’s hand and told him to press it if he needed her. He nodded gratefully.
He opened his eyes when he felt Steve’s lips pressing against his. The kisses were less frantic and desperate but had instead become gentle and fond. He felt Steve card his fingers through Tony’s short hair and it sent a gentle shiver down his spine.
He was about to close his eyes when he heard a snuffle of a snore from behind him. Turning to face the usually empty side of the bed, he realised that Tony Stark, a man with which he shares a mutual hatred, was sleeping beside him in bed. The soldier frowned slightly until the pain-distorted memories of the night before came filtering back: Tony had helped him up to his room and refused to leave until Steve was asleep. However, it now appeared as though the man had taken on the burden of being babysitter in case Steve needed anything in the night.
It immediately dawned on him that he hadn’t opened his eyes yet due to them being scrunched up in pain. It hadn’t even occurred to him to attempt to do so on the journey in. With what felt like a Herculean effort, he wrenched his eyelids apart to peer up at the woman.
Tony smirked and stated with a wink, “Nice to know I have this effect on you. Can come in handy…” He trailed off suggestive and Steve immediately knew he’d gotten himself in trouble with this one.
The ding of the elevator opening was like sweet music to both their ears and within minutes Tony had settled Steve on the end of the nearly made double bed. He didn’t have time to take in the room as he couldn’t take his eyes off the man writhing in pain.
“Uh, it’s partly my fault because I decided he-“ Steve began to explain when suddenly he heard the familiar clicking sound of handcuffs and his arms were being shoved behind his back, “What on earth?!”
It took a moment for Steve to compose himself enough to answer, “No, it’s just... I broke your wall.”
Meanwhile, Steve lay sound asleep in his bed after another dose of painkillers to fight back the annoying aching of his shoulder. At least everyone at Shield would be off his back... or so he thought.
They bid their farewells and headed off in their different directions with identical bags in their grasps. The doctor hadn't asked Steve's name as he had predicted. Nobody ever wanted to admit they didn't know who the other man was. He’d bet his life on that fact more than once.
Blue eyes glistened as he nodded and Tony nodded. Somehow, despite their agreement, they were both disappointed.
During the weeks, he had been learning to walk on a prosthetic leg which turned out to be more difficult than it appeared. He fell several times everyday and had even broken a metal leg during one particularly bad tumble.
“I don’t need anything.” It came as an automatic response to the man. The accent twisted a slight sense of anxiety into Steve’s stomach and the sudden idea of him being assassinated by the enemy popped into his head. He swallowed thickly.
Scenarios began to flash in from of his eyes: Steve could be lying bleeding on the floor or collapsed in the shower. Panic raised up as Tony began considering more possibilities: He could have been kidnapped by someone wanting revenge or being murdered by them right now. With that in mind, he swiftly opened the unlocked door and burst into the room. Belatedly realising that he was definitely defenceless.
The voice spoke again, "Do you really not know who I am?" When Steve again didn't comment the caller sighed, "Didn't you ever get taught that a conversation has to involve two people? Unless you want to get carted off to an insane asylum for talking to yourself... it's Stark. Tony Stark... Iron man from the Avengers."
He leant his head to rest on top of Tony’s and placed a gentle kiss against his hair. They linked their fingers together again now that they’d finished signing as both of them were more than happy to sit together in companionable silence until they drifted off to sleep.
"Welcome, Doctor. Enjoy your night here at Wright laboratories." The man opened the door to grant the guest access.
He then spoke. He knew Steve couldn’t hear it but wanted to get his thoughts out there without judgement or potentially scaring Steve away.
Steve took the cup and stood for a moment. The silence encouraged the awkward tension between them until the mob boss finally said, “Okay then... Thanks for the coffee, Marvin.” The tall man spared a glance for the name tag. He turned and was gone in seconds, the ringing of the bell over the door was the only thing that proved that Steve had even been there.
“Look, I’d appreciate it if you don’t talk about Steve like that... He’s not comfortable with sex. He’s asexual.”
He spotted the moment Steve slunk into the precinct and couldn’t help but grin at the fact that he had beaten the man into work for the first time, “Ah! Rogers, I have the file for that arrest we did the other night. I need you to sign it for me.” He watched closely as the man dumped his bag by his desk and dragged his feet across the room to Stark’s desk. He signed lazily which was unusual for the tall and obsessive man.
“I spotted you before you had even stepped through the door on your first day.” He smirked, something sparkled in his blue eyes.
Captain Fury pressed pause and the click cut through the tension of the room which that last line of the tape had cultivated. The whole Detective squad was gathered around in the briefing room huddled around the small tape player.
“You don’t need to.” Tony answered, he was accidentally displaying his softer and more vulnerable side again, “Anyways, that’s all I wanted to give you. I’ll hit the road so you can get back to bed.”
Steve smirked slightly in response as he recognised her from a couple of cases he'd worked in the past.
They were just scraping up the last morsels of their dinner when Tony coughed slightly and knew the brief silence was perfect timing. Steeling his nerve, he began,
Tony's eyes darted back and forth between Natasha and the words for a couple of moments before asking outright, "And this is so terrible because?"
Flushed as a beetroot, Steve opened and closed his mouth several times in a display of hesitation that nobody had ever seen from the man. A slight wave of doubt accompanied the raising chatter of rumors as people, for the first time, had to consider that Steve Rogers may have not kept information prevalent to the case confidential. For the first time, people hypothesised that there may be more to the man than first assumed.
Suddenly, the man began to turn as though to check on the supposedly sleeping genius so Tony allowed his head to drop and opened his mouth just a touch; he’d been reliably informed by many bed partner’s that he slept with his mouth open. There was a moment of silence as Steve must have been looking across at him but it dissipated quickly as Steve continued dressing. He had to perch on the edge of the bed to get his pants on but was gentle to ensure he didn’t wake up the secretly-awake man.
"Why would you need me?" His grey eyes scanned the area outside the car. If this was a trap he was taking people down with him. His fingers twitched in an instant desire to grasp his blades, "You have... her. What's her name?"
Nobody had time to question the men on their sudden behaviour change as within the hour they were being suited up and shipped out to the emerging battle scene. They’d been informed and prepared to face a giant globular monster that had landed only an hour ago with intentions to destroy the human race.
“I’ll call a medic when we get up.” Stark murmured, as he’d never seen someone in so much pain. They hadn’t been on a mission in almost a week and it was the middle of the night so the genius couldn’t figure out who or what had hurt the soldier. What he did know though was that something inside him wanted to crush whatever had hurt him.
The team rushed over in time to see Stark rip the debris from the body and catapult it behind them. He lifted the limp body into his arms and sobbed over the man.
It was getting close to the time and Barton was beginning to get mildly anxious. No matter how much he trusted Steve there was always the risk that the assassin had decided against helping Shield.
There was only a slight moaning sound from the speaker of his cell making Stark panic and curse when he noticed Natasha wasn't already on the helipad waiting. He called one of the medic people at SHIELD and told them to get ready to jump aboard when he briefly landed as there was an emergency 150 miles away.
“What is up with you? I haven’t heard from you in weeks, you didn’t even notice my bike outside and you jump me?” He demands, crossing his arms.
“What do you need? A doctor? Hospital? Shall I get Bruce?” Chaotically, Tony began hovering over the man in desperation.
At this point, Tony was laughing so hard he could feel the unfamiliar ache in his sides. Tears stung the edges of his eyes. If anyone had told him 1 year ago that he’d be turn the lights on and off in an argument with deaf Captain America, who was his lover, he would have called bullshit. But here he was experiencing the strangest argument of all time.
Tony raised an eyebrow and had to wonder whether it could be considered normal to get slightly turned on by such an image. There was no denying Steve was a good-looking man but his body had never had such an instinctual response to something the other man had said before. The detective sighed and realised he didn’t have time for any of this, especially contemplating his sudden attraction to his colleague.
Suddenly, the man flipped around and threw a Russian throwing knife at Clint's arm making him drop the gun to grab his wound. Noticing his target moving, Barton swiftly whipped out his trusty bow and arrow, aiming them for the now standing man's heart. The target raised his hands in apparent surrender.
He chuckled to himself as it sent before leaning his head back against the headrest and slightly drifting off as the vehicle carried him home.
Was this a trick question? It felt like a trick question so Barton asked, "Is this a trick question? I use a gun because that's what you're supposed to use, what everyone uses, it's easiest and quickest."
If he wasn’t being forced to keep Tony, the boss of the coffee house probably would have fired him on his first day. And Tony would have agreed with the decision. However, he could only hope that Steve had been too distracted to notice him
Steve was still stood by the switches. Eyes squinting in Tony’s direction, he huffed out a breath and slammed the lights off again. By now, Tony had begun to feel the tension loosening from his shoulders. He smirked slightly, realising that his ability to talk to Jarvis gave him an advantage.
Natasha was a night owl and Steve had to thank God for that fact as he ran through the rain and looked up at her apartment window, lit by a soft yellow glow. Once at the entrance he buzzed her and she answered immediately,
Steve slumped against the pale wall as the blood continued to ooze between his fingers despite the pressure he was applying to the wound. It was like a torrent of crimson flowing straight out of him. He grunted as he reached down to pull a small hand pistol from where it'd been strapped against his leg. The blond took a breath to steady himself before stepping away from the wall, forcing himself out the door and aiming down the road.
Clint burst out from somewhere at the back, “Who’d have thought someone would actually have the ability to tame Stark!” The room vibrated with the chuckling of the crew and Tony couldn’t help but smirk. It felt good to be back.
Not much ever manages to silence Tony Stark but his mouth hanged open and he blinked rapidly as his brain raced to catch up.
“I’ve got him,” Tony answered before Steve could even begin to reply, “You’ll probably be more use to the team until we catch up. Let them know we’re on our way.”
The boss stood from behind his desk and strode over to the cop, he held out a large hand and offered a reassuring smile, “Detective, I’m so glad you could make it. We’ve been looking forward to your visit for some time.”
The mission had started and Steve still hadn’t met Tony Stark or Clint Barton. He’d met Natasha and Bruce on the landing strip when Coulson had arrived with him. They seemed nice enough and he was eager to know what they could do in battle after hearing such good things. After many years of commanding a squad, he knew the importance in having the best team possible.
Aggravated, the genius burst out, “So what?! People wake up with hard-ons all the time! It doesn’t mean you’re actively out to get some. Besides, I can deal with it myself.” Tony has been managing pretty well with just himself for the last couple of months.
“D’you mind a slight detour to the hospital on the way home?” He tried to smile but the ache of his ripped stitches was beginning to wear through the hum of the feel good adrenaline. He internally cringed knowing that his doctor would be less than pleased to find he’d ripped his stitches for the second time in a week and a half. In his defence, what was he supposed to do while at home? A workout only seemed reasonable at the time.
After a minute he whispered against Steve’s lips, “You should really take a guy out to dinner before getting so touchy but for you, I’ll wave the rule.”
Cap huffed a laugh while exiting the room once again. He called back, "What would I gain from that? I could have just killed you while you were sleeping. Tip one: Never make a job harder than it needs to be." He entered back with all Clint's equipment in his arms and a large duffle bag to conceal it, "And I'm not being rude but I'm more of a lone wolf these days and it's already 2:30pm so if you wouldn't mind eating up then getting out."
It was the same as every other fancy event he'd ever snuck into. Dim lights, a posh orchestra and champagne flutes floating around on silver trays carried by staff. Hundreds of people stood around talking and munching delicately on 'nibbles'. He glided between them to further integrate himself in the group. His fingers snagged a glass of champagne as he passed. Pain medication and alcohol were probably a bad idea but there were certain decisions that Steve didn't reflect over. Besides, he’d probably look out of place to wander the function without a drink in hand.
Almost as though he knew Tony was his only viable option, Steve sighed and sat down on the curb to began pulling up the leg of his pants, “My leg... they tried to repair the damage from last night but something isn’t right.”
Steve struggled to gather his thoughts as his emotions were flying all over the place. He had to wait a moment before he was able to sign. A stinging in his eyes almost distracted him but he pressed through.
“Tony, I don’t feel anything about sex. I never have. The thought of it and the... the doing it just make me uncomfortable.” He groaned at himself, “I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have even come here and done this to you. Why’d you ever want to be with a freak.” The word freak had been ingrained deeply into his mind as so many people he’d either told or been in relationships with had rejected him and called him a freak. He didn’t know how to fix himself but he wished he could.
Until that day, he’d just have to endure more interrogations and meetings with a dangerous man that somehow made his heart flutter.
The older man leant against the door of the car with a soft look on his features, “You’re my partner. It’s my job.”
Bruce chimed in, “They were clearly confident enough in their set up. I doubt this is their first inspection. If anything the wire just adds credibility on their part.”
Except maybe from Nat. She’d given him an almost identical understanding smile when she’d found out his dislike for sex within a few days of first meeting. She’d been the first person he’d told in such a long time but she made him feel so at ease. His thoughts snapped back as Tony leant in to kiss him.
He snuck in the front door and luckily didn't run into any familiar faces but he still had 3 flights of stairs to climb so wasn't getting his hopes up yet. He'd been pretending to work of the military (which he did used to) but said he was more a paper pusher than a fighter (which wasn't and isn't true).
Once they stepped out the bar and into the pouring rain Steve snapped, “How could you do that?! Not only did you humiliate me in front of the whole bar but you abused your power as a police detective!”
“You’re upset?” Tony sat on the edge of the bed and cupped Steve’s cheek like the other man often does for him, “Oh, baby. Don’t be. I couldn’t go through with it.”
"There is nothing wrong. He's just drawing unnecessary attention to himself when we need him alive and preferably unarrested. But wait, "Suspicion dropped itself over her sharp features, "Why were you calling him?"
Steve was visibly upset, he kept his eyes down on his food and Tony knew full well that not looking up was a defensive technique he employed. He knew he had to dispel this nonsense but he didn’t even know where to begin. Maybe subconsciously he was missing hearing someone’s voice, hearing them say his name, feeling like he couldn’t engage in group conversation without interpreting for Steve. But he didn’t want to believe that he could leave Steve because of that. He wanted to believe that he liked Steve more than any of those assholes that would dump him because of his deafness.
The touch, his smile and purred words went to Tony’s head as the criminal said, “I’m especially pleased that you could make it. It’s always a pleasure, Detective.”
Tony could see that Steve was resisting the smile that was trying to wiggle onto his lips. But the man resisted it valiantly.
As he stood, he looked up at Tony with tears welling up at the bottom of his blue eyes and his partner quickly wrapped up the interview.
Steve appeared to pick up on the cop’s unease, “Sorry for being so candid but I felt like it would probably be a good place to start for your tour.”
He continued typing then peered up again when a detail of the case (It happened to be the criminal’s red car) made him think back to that moment where he was taken completely by surprise. Detective Stark frowned when he noticed Steve had disappeared but his belongings were still scattered around his desk. He shrugged it off and forced himself to stare at the screen until the case was completely written up. It was going well until five minutes later he realized he needed the file of a similar case they did last year. He sighed and headed towards the file room.
He suddenly snapped his mouth shut as the door opened. Both detectives leapt over to a nearby pile of cases and grabbed whatever one was on top. Deputy Coulson entered, looking confused at their presence in the room, “What are you two doing in here?”
“What happened?” Tony enquired, his voice was quiet but, with him supporting Steve body, they were close for the soldier to hear him perfectly. Unfortunately, Steve opened his mouth to answer at the exact moment the foot of his prosthetic leg touched the ground: a controlled scream was Tony’s only answer. Instead of pushing the matter he simply hurried their pace towards the elevator as panic sank into his stomach.
It was in that instant that Steve knew that today had been his last day with both his legs. However, he also knew that he was lucky it hadn’t been his last day alive.
He couldn’t understand why he was feeling so down as he loved his job, his colleagues and helping the citizens of New York. The other detectives were all at their desks or in the small kitchen area chatting before they got down to work. He could feel Steve’s absence and he knew that everyone else could too despite his senses being especially heightened toward the missing detective.
It was light when he woke up as the blinds weren't even pulled down which didn't help his pounding headache. It took him a moment to remember where he was; at which point he was surprised that he'd even woken up at all. Clint scanned the small bedroom before frowning when he noticed he was on his target's squeaky bed. He wasn't dismembered or disembowelled or anything else beginning with 'dis-' and he wasn't even tied up. Instead he had the majority of his clothes stripped off and hung on the radiator over in the corner, a thick blanket holding him down and a glass of water and a pill beside the bed which he assumed would ease his head pain. He wouldn't consume either though. He may be a rookie but he wasn't stupid.
“Bet you weren’t impressed.” She smirked as she crossed her arms and stuck out her hip. Her red hair moved slightly in the breeze of the old fan that Steve had propped up on a wonky shelf. He would comment on the way it made her look like someone from a shampoo commercial but he wasn’t quite sure if their friendship had exceeded that boundary yet. She was hard to read.
"Barton," Fury snapped. The sound of his footsteps getting closer made the spy roll his eyes. If only he were hidden in the eye-patch blind spot so he could sneak off, "Where is he?" Booming voice echoed around the inside of the corridor. Did he really not have an indoor voice?
If Steve had to pick one word to describe the time since Tony left it would be emptiness. The penthouse suite was dark and suddenly felt cold and abandoned. His heart was fluttering in a way which, pre-serum, he would have enquired at a doctors about but now it was just causing his stomach to churn violently. He wished he’d skipped dinner.
The machine hissed as it opened and as the smoke cleared, Steve could see the faces of all the onlookers and scientists peering down at him from their glass tower. The experiment could read the eagerness in their faces at his emergence. He couldn’t pay attention to them for long, however, as the clearness of his lungs and looseness of his muscles suddenly captured his attention. Peering down he could see his new rippling muscles and could barely believe that after years of being the little guy he was finally not. There were still scars across his torso and thighs from the mine explosion weeks before but they looked old and mostly healed thanks to the serum. It would be easy to believe that years rather than days separated Steve from the worst day of his life.
Steve shrugged and began to walk back into darkness of the alley, “I like you. It’s fun to play this cat and mouse game.”
“Steve, you can’t be serious!” Tony was pacing back and forth at the foot of their large bed. His hair was ruffled from running his fingers through and he looked thoroughly confused. This wasn’t what a person expected to be confronted with within 10 minutes of waking up.
He’d always though that he knew Steve Rogers. He’d practically been raised on Captain America stories as a kid and had glamorised the man his whole life. How had his father not mentioned that Steve was an amputee? He was missing close to his whole leg and the genius had never even suspected a thing.
“Well,” Natasha hesitated, considering Steve’s privacy and state of recovery, “You know where he lives.” She stated before striding off to her next task.
Steve frowned but it transformed into a slight smile as he followed Tony’s gesture to the piles of cocaine and drug money stacked up on a table. Some of it was scattered on the floor from the raid but there was certainly hundreds of thousands of dollars strewn around the area.
When the fireworks started some time later everyone joined them on the balcony but the men continued grasping onto each other tightly and they knew that they’d never want to let go.
“Steve!” Tony screamed as he shot towards Steve hoping that he’d at least be able to push him out of the direct line of impact.
“Out of everyone’s butts, I’m glad it was your butt.” Tony whisper in response knowing that he was taking a risk.
"I'm sorry," The friendly doctor shook his head as though trying to force memories back, "Have we met before?"
The billionaire froze with his fork halfway to his mouth. Blinking, his mouth opened and closed while his mind suddenly went blank for signs. More than ever he wished he could speak. Eventually his brain caught up.
The next thing you know you’re either dead or wake up in or on your way to a field hospital. That’s if you didn’t bleed out in the minutes after the explosion. But one of the worst things about mines is that they were incredibly difficult to spot amongst the grass, mud or foliage which made it a death trap for newbies and experienced soldiers alike. It was impossible to outsmart a landmine. This was a fact that Captain Steve Rogers found out very quickly after he heard the familiar click of a mine detonator.
Eventually the man sighed and padded back through to where he'd come from, the bedroom Clint assumed. Barton waited a while before slipping the many locks on the man's window. Quietly, he encouraged the window to slide open which allowed him to climb inside. The smell of the room, like cotton and workout sweat, hit him suddenly but it was the opposite of unpleasant. He crept to the bedroom door and peeked inside to where the man, surprisingly to Clint, was knelt praying beside his bed. Eyes closed is ideal for murder.
Steve was rummaging through some old case files in the old data room, where they stored stacks of boxes full of old cases, and working through some negative feelings when he jumped at the sudden presence of another voice. In the surprise, he dropped the box of files on the floor, scattering the papers everywhere. He tried to grab the fluttering sheets helplessly before they got strewn too far.
He fell back against his couch and winced as the stitches berated him for his sudden movement and so carelessly too. He breathed through the sudden stab of pain and instead grabbed for an old case file that he’d managed to wrangle from Captain Fury’s reluctant hands. He flicked through the folded and rumpled pages, many marked with dark brown rings, and sighed at his state of utter inactivity. He was a giant blob of useless energy; he couldn’t work, get out or head to the gym. Even the slight movement he could achieve was scolded by the bite of his healing wound. He dropped his head against the back of the couch and permitted himself to waste some of his overly-abundant time by peering up at the smooth white of his ceiling.
“Grow up will you, Stark.” Steve huffed, wishing he had never brought up a subject which allowed Stark to go on a boasting spree. As if his ego needed boosting any more.
The two detectives nodded eagerly. Steve was raring to go but Tony was excited to get back out there with the man considering how well the last chase ended. Within a couple of days they were all set up and ready to move into the hide out.
Steve's gaze slowly slid across to where his friend was standing patiently, "I don't doubt I could do it. Although Agent Barton has an unrealistically high opinion of me." The ex-soldier responded, still not relaxed from his position.
“It should do. The chip is reading all the signals your leg would have received and is relaying them to the prosthetic so it moves exactly how you remember.” Tony shrugged from where he was watching it all unfold. He’d never particularly liked Steve Rogers so if you had told him 6 months ago that he would spend days working on a prosthetic for the man then he would have called you a liar. Somewhere and somehow between then and now, his opinion of the soldier had completely flipped. He could identify with the man’s pain and his struggle with his prosthetics as Tony had had issues with the Arch reactor several times before.
The other detective acted flirty and put on doe eyes, “Did you just call me ‘Tony’? You’ve never actually called me by my first name. Does this mean we’re official? Wait, on the marriage certificate are we going for my last name or yours because quite frankly Mr Stark-Rogers is obscene.” He didn’t want to try and figure out how he knew Steve had never used his first name but hearing him say ‘Tony’ felt right.
’ which made Tony laugh for 2 hours. Steve would teach Tony new signs and pretend not to know curse signs. That’s without mentioning the lazy mornings in bed which would turn into lazy days in bed doing nothing but making love and signing to each other; Tony particularly enjoyed hearing about Steve’s upbringing 70 years ago. Tony didn’t even realise the smile that had emerged onto his lips until Clint threw a cushion at his face.
The door she stopped at seemed to appear almost out of nowhere on the wall since they’d been walking such a long stretch with nothing. Natasha took one last distrustful look in Tony’s direction before opening the door and entering.
"Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the dance floor for their first dance, Mr and Mr Stark-Rogers!" The DJ announced.
“Come here.” The soldier ordered. Tony obeyed as he climbed onto the bed until he was straddling the thighs of the taller man. He could feel the cool silicone of the prosthetic under his legs but his attention barely noticed it; he was far to distracted. Steve leant up to kiss Tony while his hands removed Tony’s last article of clothing, his shirt, and demanding hands explored the tight form underneath.
There was no noise from Steve aside from the rustling of his clothes and the wind until the man finally stopped running. Tony could practically hear the frown in his tone, "You realize  that I am an assassin, Mr Stark."
He looked up to give a nod of the head to Tony but the man had vanished. Steve chuckled to himself as he shook his head and closed the file. Typical for Tony to be so cocky and self-assured; what if Steve was secretly a ‘love ‘em and leave ‘em’ type with no interest in pursuing their relationship further.  Despite ranting this to himself, detective Rogers knew he was too much of an open book and everyone knew he was looking for a committed relationship.
“You don’t go doctor?” Tony used rudimentary signals to accompany his words but Steve seemed to understand.
Steve, however, was faster thanks to his new prosthetic and managed to catch the Tony by the elevator. He grabbed the man’s hand and pulled him back towards the bedroom as he placed luscious kisses on his lips. Tony went willingly as Steve’s mouth put him into a trance.
Steve’s heart was racing, he could feel it coursing through his ears. Saliva was like glue in his mouth as he couldn’t seem to swallow properly. Fingers tangled in his blond hair, he pulled at the strands in frustration.
He was stood in front of the other man was now another dilemma, how to wake a dozing, deaf super solider? Would a tap leave him with a broken arm? He was yet to learn how reactive Steve was when waking up. However, out of desperation, he gently tapped his foot against Steve’s. It worked a charm; the soldier leapt up from the chair, nearly hurtling straight into the smaller man. Only his strong arms stopped Tony, and the items he held, from tumbling to the ground.
. Steve didn’t want to admit that he was beginning to lose patience; his whole life he’d prided himself on being patient and calm but the concept of having to sit through another Die Hard movie again made him want to be blind instead of deaf.
“Targets are inside the house. Move in!” The voice ordered. Somewhere in the back of his mind Stark realised it was Hill but his mind was already focused in on the raid.
"The beginning I know but it's a bit blurry." He gave a shy smile and uncertain shrug until it pulled his wound causing him to stop and wince.
Shaking his head and handing back the towel, he said, “I think I need to head home and think some more about this.”
The doctor then began to explain his new invention: a super soldier serum. In depth, he explained its potential and what the good doctor hoped it would achieve. There was great stress placed on its restorative abilities and how it will completely transform Steve’s body and remove any trace of the infection currently threatening his life. As the doctor talked Steve drug addled mind slowly grew clearer and he could follow easier.
Steve nodded, his eyes lighting up, "That must have been the one!" He laughed warmly, "I'm only briefly stopping over in New York before heading off to Europe but I never thought I'd actually bump into someone! What a small world!"
Clint smirked, "Aren't you supposed to be more subtle to a one night stand?" He fluttered his eyelashes.
"If you're dead I'm going to find a way to bring you back to life so I can kill you." Stark huffed under his breath after he broke down the door and rushed inside. He was quickly followed but the medic who was instantly on Captain searching for a pulse.
There seemed to be some sort of commotion as Tony stood and talked to someone in the crowd. People were looking behind them to see where in the audience the question was asked from. Steve frowned in confusion as in the hubbub nobody was telling him what was going on. He tried to watch to see what was happening but before long it became apparent.
Steve could taste himself on Tony’s tongue and the idea almost made him hard again. It was having a similar effect on Stark who was moaning at the feather-light pressure his dick was receiving from simply their torsos being pressed together.
He sighed, “Look, just listen okay. You’ve reacted badly to this but you’re not understanding what I mean. I don’t want us to break up, I don’t want you to start a relationship with anyone else, I don’t want a thrupple.” Tony chuckled as it was a word he’d taught Steve only a few days before, “I just want you to be happy and as healthy as possible. Sex is a normal part of life and it’s important you release that tension.” Tony was about to interrupt but Steve placed a finger over his lips, “All I’m suggesting is that you go, every few weeks or so, find someone in a bar or call whoever and just enjoy yourself. It doesn’t need to be more than that.” His eyes were pleading.
"And yet you travel around the world hundreds of times a year and interact with thousands of people." He defied his logic.
Quickly, Tony’s eyes glanced up and down the corridor to check that they were alone. He stepped closer to his friend to ensure he could keep his voice low. The last thing he wanted was to be overheard by a stranger.
It was one week later and Steve had decided to turn in early. He’d spent a couple of frustrated days alternating between trying to make do with his malfunctioning prosthesis and having to use his crutches. Him throwing the leg against the wall (which was all fixed now) and turned out to do more damaged that he’d intended. The leg was struggling to deal with the damage and the shoddy repairs they’d done last minute to ensure Steve would be able to fight that day kept failing.
Steve was low-key hiding in the evidence room when he heard the door open and a couple of people walk in. He ducked down behind the shelves in order to avoid confrontation; he had only revealed his sexuality mere hours ago and, despite a majority of support, the large man still feared the backlash of such an announcement. He listened carefully to the conversation as many people came to the room in order to get some privacy for secret conversations. Steve only prayed the individuals were not about to start gossiping about him.
The assassin slid down and pulled the blanket up. Tony couldn't help grinning as he left to find where he'd put the man's painkillers.
He was contemplating this when he noticed that Steve was beginning to stir so he dropped a kiss on the man’s forehead. It made him think back to the first time he woke Steve up and the man had been so defensive. This time, Steve’s eyelids fluttered open and he smiled.
“Whoa, whoa! You two went on a date?!” Eyes growing wide, she demanded information, “And you didn’t tell me?!”
The noises of the medic tent finally broke through the din and he heard nurses, glass bottles and pained cries. He’d been in to visit plenty of times but, luckily, never for anything himself.
Stark's 180 was so suddenly he could have received whiplash and, despite his desperate attempts not to, his face blushed red. The man began to stammer and stutter as he headed off towards the coffee machine to pour himself a cup and more intentionally avoid eye contact with a master spy.
The static sound of the microphone being turned on caused Tony’s heart to drop; why did they even allow Clint to be best man? Mostly because he and Steve had agreed that Bruce would not want to give a speech and Thor would be himself and nobody would understand his Asgardian references. That left Natasha or Clint and the former had claimed head bridesmaid.
“If being a detective doesn’t work out for you, which it appears to not be going so well, don’t be tempted by barista work... that was probably the worst Americano I’ve ever had.”
At this point, the tears were streaming down Steve’s cheeks but he didn’t care to stop. The mix of relief and pure happiness was just a perfect tear triggering concoction. Although, he didn’t doubt that the pain medication probably had a hand in it.
They were further down the corridor now, almost deep in the belly of the huge tower block. They continued rushing forward until they reached one of the semi-lit laboratories.
Tony didn’t have time to consider why a simple hand job had sent him reeling so much but he was maybe beginning to admit that he might have a major crush on Captain America.
“A new one. I made it.” Tony stepped forward slightly, “May I?” He held out his hand to request the prosthetic.
Without being able to see, Steve already knew the dark haired man was rolling his eyes, “Yeah, I know… but just because I’m pretty open about my sexuality doesn’t mean I know everyone else’s business. It’s such a stereotype that all non-straight people know each other!”
“How have we come so far?” Steve asked, watching their legs touching and Tony’s hands joined around his shoulders.
Steve raised his eyebrows, “Have you ever been shot?” On Tony’s head shake he continued, “Then you have no idea how bad it hurts… but it is definitely getting better.”
“Tony?” Steve asked in shock. However, the shock he felt today was much more pleasant than the distain he would have felt a couple of weeks ago when they first met. Their relationship had somehow transformed during that time.
The taller man grasped the other’s hair to guide their lips back together. Their teeth clashed as they rushed to get closer and deepen the kiss.
The soldier fired back quickly while tucking himself back under the blanket, “And I’ll just tell them that you climbed into my bed unprompted.”
He struggled to see the keyhole of his apartment in the shadows; he leant to the side to allow the streetlamp to light the keys path into the hole. The darkness of the outside is mirrored inside the building as he has to remind himself that for Steve’s first few weeks at his new job he would have to work late in order to catch up with everything the other precinct was in the middle of.  Dumping his bag, he entered his home and kicked off his shoes and began to head towards the kitchen before remembering that Steve liked to keep the shoes in line; a remnant of his experience in the armed forces. With the tip of his toes he tapped them gently until they lined up beside Steve’s running sneakers.
The soldier turned his head to watch Tony’s interpretation but the genius only chuckled and pointed his attention back to the boy. Steve frowned and peered down at the blond kid.
He released one last exhausted sigh before looking squarely at Captain Fury to block out the reaction of all his colleagues and friends. His tongue was clumsy as though his body was fighting him to prevent him making this revelation, “On the night in question I was at a friend’s house… all night.”
The billionaire was about to question the man when the music kicked in and his jaw dropped. How could he suddenly be dragged back to 5 years ago by one simple song.
“Yeah, but I also now know that on top of those things you’re kind, caring and compassionate.” Steve smiled down at the man.
They were both staring at it in an awkward silence and both pretending that their hearts weren't pounding at 100mph whilst resisting the urge to peer across at their colleague. A single bed was shoved into the corner of the tiny box room with a single blanket and pillow. The house was on its way to being derelict and the sound of rats in between the floorboards was less than comforting. Their eyes traced the object in uncertain anxiety. When they'd accepted the undercover case they hadn't exactly been given details about their accommodation; all Fury had done was apologise for it as the options were limited with such short notice. They didn't realise just how bad he actually meant.
It was 10 days later when Tony began to feel the urge. It was easy to keep under wraps for a couple of days but eventually he had to admit that he was damn right horny. Now was the challenge of bringing the subject up to Steve as the other man hadn’t mentioned the deal since it was first agreed. Tony subconsciously hoped that Steve would take back the offer and be possessive over him. He could then go about with his usual relief plan of jerking off in the shower while thinking of Steve. He had checked multiple times with Steve if it was okay to think of him when jerking off since he was so cautious about crossing any boundaries. Steve had reassured him that he was more flattered than anything else.
He waited a minute or so before following to reduce the blazing obviousness. Several eyes followed him across the room; these people were detectives! Of course they notice when two of their colleagues slip off into the secret-conversation room.
He hissed through his gritted teeth to steel his nerves before knocking on the door. His stomach did a flip as he listened. However, after waiting a couple of minutes, he knocked again but slightly harder. He listened again, brows furrowed so hard that they almost met in the middle.
Tony chuckled gently. He wasn’t about to tell Steve about all the places he had done something sexual. His reputation for being promiscuous wasn’t completely without basis but he wasn’t ashamed of that. It did make him laugh, however, at the idea of him getting with Steve Rogers especially with all his preconceived ideas of the man. A few months ago he would have never even been able to imagine Steve doing anything even remotely naughty within the precinct confines.
The reminder of his job title snapped Tony out of the trance as he was suddenly thrust back into the realisation that he was currently working a case and the extraordinarily attractive suspect was flirting with him but he must resist his charms.
Tony laughed and he was surprised when a slight noise of laughed came from Steve. Their eyes met and they smiled.
Clint shot him a look before rolling his eyes, "It's Shield so its different and why would they want anything to do with you?" Suspicion colored his tone. He'd never managed to fully school himself around Steve as he could read him like an open book anyway.
Tony always knew that Steve was stubborn but he was struggling to believe that the man could tolerate the incessant buzzing and calling for a full hour especially when the man’s neighbors were becoming so distressed by it. The man really was a model citizen so surely wouldn’t allow his fellow inhabitants to suffer like this.
Steve could only smile as Sam had forced him to come along to most of the events at the veteran’s centre after he got employed there and he couldn’t deny that they definitely helped him more than he had been expecting. Not to mention that communication was definitely key in his transition back to civilian-hood.
The men wrapped up their conversation and left the room leaving Steve ducking out of sight. Slowly he rose and clicked his back from the awkward angle. He sighed and continued sifting through the files he had been browsing. He knew Detective Stark had a reputation for sleeping around and being a ladies man but he didn’t realise he liked men too. Steve worried that it was because people viewed him as being old fashioned and conservative that prevented Stark from divulging this. He always felt out of the loop when they all did fun things or hung out together. He was always unaware of them doing things until he saw them posting about it on social media during the night. Even though he only had a close relationship with Natasha he wished they included him more. The thought that his team didn’t actually like him broke his heart slightly.
He'd gone out and left a murderer, more specifically his murderer, alone in his apartment? Barton could have done anything while the man was gone.
Tony squinted into the darkness until he could make out Steve standing only a few meters away. He suddenly knew that his ruse in the shop had been unsuccessful and Steve seemed to know what he was thinking.
That was it. Steve wasn’t about to let this guy get away.  He leapt from the passenger side to run to drive the vehicle, ignoring the stinging pain.
Still grasping Tony's hand, Steve led them through the streets in the direction of their sanctuary: the tower.
"No... Well, most people know me. I'm a household name. It was just unusual to find someone who didn't recognise me immediately."
"It had better be a strip dance..." Tony grumbled as he was dragged onto the dance space. He glanced around uncertainly as their friends gathered around.
Tony nodded at Steve to confirm that his condition had been met so they followed Nick out towards the media room where they held all of their broadcasts and interviews.
The man smiled slightly, “Your reputation precedes you. You don’t think we hear of what happens on the field? No, many talk of Steve Rogers and all you’ve accomplished. Your resistance to this infection and all your sickness before display your body’s strength and preservation. We need a leader who knows what’s its like to be the little guy. We need you.”
Tony’s heart suddenly ached for the man. He knew phantom pains, knew what it was like to live with technology to assist your living. His own archreactor reminded him daily of what he went through all those years ago. Doubtless, Steve’s amputation gave him physical pain and the emotional pain of being transported back to the trauma of it happening. Stark couldn’t help but ponder how it happened.
"These are pretty strong so they-" The billionaire froze as he stepped in to the guest room and the emptiness of the bed leapt out to him. The blankets were strewn across the floor and the pyjamas were discarded while clothes from the open wardrobe were missing.
Tony knew he didn’t need to reply. Instead he dropped a soft kiss on the other man’s blond hair and could feel the familiar squeeze around his heart as Steve began to drift off unheeded.
“I really hated you too. I didn’t think you’d done anything worthy of praise. I didn’t know your past.”
“Yeah, it just means you’re not interested in having sex. It’s totally normal and valid so you’re not broken and you’re not a freak.” The squeeze he gave Steve’s hands was so reassuring.
“Fine but we’ll be watching you carefully.” The boss replied as he strode for the door, “Now come on, they’ve been waiting for hours.”
Another customer laughed out of awkwardness, “Ah, that was awkward as hell... Anyways, do you know where my latte is? I ordered it twenty minutes ago.” Stark eyed the man with a frown before bustling off to make his shit attempt at a latte.
The rush hour chaos had passed some time before and by the time the cafe had recovered from the influx of customers it was dark outside. Tony was cleaning up for the night when he began to haul a bag of trash out the back to their industrial sized garbage cans. The door of the cafe clicked closed behind him and he was wielding the bag into the can when a large figure stepped out from the inky darkness.
He could hear the archer lowering his bow, “I know you won’t take any of my advice but at least think about it, okay?”
The face that was revealed behind the heavy door was unexpected and Steve was sure his surprise reflected on his features, “Tony?”
Steve had felt like he’d trapped Tony in their relationship as he hadn’t felt comfortable to disclose his asexuality until they’d been talking for a few weeks and were on a date. He felt this especially since Tony had always had such a playboy reputation so he clearly craved and needed sex. It was integral to his character. He’d seen the papers and blog posts about the man pre-their relationship and didn’t want him to have to change for him.
Steve merely chuckled and, with his free hand, held onto his husband's hand, "I worked it out. I know the reference."
“What’s wrong?” Tony asked while handing him his jacket and buckling up his own belt. He could sense Steve was already retreating back into his head where he would panic about what had just happened and their relationship. He didn’t know what they were but he knew that he wanted something more.
A couple of weeks later and Steve had begun to work through his anger towards Erskine about lying about the possibility of his leg being fixed. But, he also knew that if the doctor hadn’t lied then he probably wouldn’t have been here at all; almost everyone was in consensus that his infection would have taken his life.
He had hardly finished his sentence when a clap of thunder rocketed through the city and echoed around the buildings. As if it was waiting for that cue, the rain then descended in a thick and steady sheet; the heaviest rain Tony had ever witnessed. Suddenly, running seemed like the only option.
"Don't worry. You'll be out before you know it." The director replied whilst grinning at the serving Tony just got dealt. If Steve was going to teach Tony a lesson then he'd gladly put up with his weird, super paranoid, evasive techniques.
The conversation had risen, fallen and collapsed into nothingness repeatedly. It was only a couple of days since Tony had upset Steve in the club and hadn’t yet managed to form an apology for the unintentional hurt he had caused. Rogers, while liking to think of himself as the bigger man, hadn’t even attempted to engage in any of the conversation Stark desperately attempted. He was happy to boil in his own pile of misery while peering out the window of the car aimlessly.
“Did you want to take this candle back to your room? The back up generator should be running soon but the storm is tampering with it.” Stark offered.
Tony’s hands ghosted Steve’s body appreciatively. He had always known the man had a good body but feeling it properly for the first time was a completely different experience. Steve’s muscles shifted under his touch in response to the sensation.
"That's a relief or this would have been a waste." He returned back with a steaming plate of pancakes and bacon, "Although, I'd have to applaud you for sticking to a cause you believe in."
It took a few minutes more before they broke out of the forest and picked up pace as they headed towards the hospital tent. He could hear people they passed by mumbling his name or calling out to him. Captain Steve Rogers was a popular man on base and everyone knew him or had heard of his heroics, despite his small stature, so it was quite a scene to see him being hauled into base on a stretcher.
There was a second of hesitation before Steve turned to face the other detective and answered, “Not really. You?”
In the end they managed to stop laughing and stop messing with the lights but both of their stomach muscles cramped from the exertion. They smiled at each other as the tension had been diffused.
He was rummaging around the dimly lit cupboards when he heard a soft groan that made him freeze. If someone had broken in again he’d absolutely flip. Hand holding a packet of tea, he didn’t move and a further groan permeated the room. He darted up as quickly as his bruised and aching body would allow and followed the noise.
“Tony!” Steve groaned with increasing intensity in time with his pants for air. His grasp of Tony’s hair got tighter.
Being defensive definitely wouldn’t help the conversation but he went there anyway, “What? No, why should there be a reason?”
"I can't do it." Natasha leant forward, her chair squeaking as she moved, "I've already been given a mission and besides you'd probably need a specialist for this."
Passing it over, Steve pulled himself out of the bed so he could sit on the edge. It felt somewhat intimate to be in a room with Tony while he was topless. He silently thanked the Lord that he’d chosen to wear pyjama pants to bed tonight as he often didn’t.
Tony had to blink a couple of times as he followed Steve’s signs; in the man’s frustration he was accidentally signing faster and faster. It dawned on Tony for the first time that Steve had been slowing down his ASL. He probably didn’t need to do that now Tony knew it pretty well but the sudden pace change gave him whiplash.
Seconds later something sharp hit the back of Clint's neck. It felt like being sung by a wasp. His steady fingers automatically dropped his weapon despite his minds protest. The world began to spin while the carpet zoomed up to his face. He landed heavily with a deep outburst of breath. Darkness began to creep in on his sight but the last thing he saw was this assassin peering down on him with pity.
"-Starrrch?" The voice wavered. Stark could imagine the owner's eyelids slipping closed despite significant resistance, "Pluze, come."
“As much as I enjoy your company, I’ve always got the impression you only talk to me when you have to.”
The comment Stark made about him being nothing more than some experiment hurt him but he didn’t want to admit it. He’d never seen himself as a hero despite being labelled it many times by those during the war and the press of his day. He knew that Doctor Erskine chose him for more than just his desperate situation but he’d never unpacked the reasons why.
He nodded to her and they bid their farewells allowing him to let himself into his own apartment. Nobody blinks an eye at his 4 door locks, not in this part of the city anyway. He closed the door behind him and resealed all the locks before he rushed to the table by the door and dragged the large bag out from underneath. He'd learnt from several unpleasant experiences to always keep your emergency supplies near the front door and a smaller bag in your bedroom too.
Steve dumbly repeated the same action with his mouth as his mind struggled to form any kind of coherent sentence. The dance partner shouted in his ear to check everything was okay. It was rather bizarre for Tony and Steve to be stood stock still in the middle of the dance floor essentially just staring at each other with everyone else dancing around them. The taller man just waved off his concern though. His mind was suddenly vacant of his strong-minded plan to show his colleagues that he wasn’t such a prude and, in fact, was capable of having a good time. He could identify with the proverbial deer caught in headlights and Tony Stark was the driver of the 12 wheeled-truck barrelling full speed in his direction.
They were currently alone in the office as both were working after hours to get their cases finished. Tony was writing up the undercover assignment while trying to not allow his mind to make their kisses the only thing he wanted to think about. He struggled to recall what time they made contact with the target on their latest case but he could describe the exact way Steve's lips felt against his own. He glanced up quickly at the other man typing away at his desk oblivious and probably nonplussed to Tony's thoughts. He decided to reside himself to the fact that the taller detective was simply too good for him.
“Big deal?” He cried, “You just got shot!” His hands began to flutter over Steve’s well-toned body helplessly knowing he couldn’t do any more than Nat had already administered.
He scolded himself again, “Stop it.” He sniffed and buried his face into the pillow, “Oh, Tony.” He groaned out.
Steve steeled his resolve and spoke. It was the first time he’d shown Tony his deaf voice. The words were distorted and difficult to make out but Tony recognised them immediately.
He hesitated with one hand against the cold metal of the door in a mental conflict he was sure the hospital had witnessed many times. But for Stark, it wasn’t death or illness that lay behind the door but rather a pissed off colleague that he liked more than he wanted to admit but didn’t know how to pacify. Surely, this blunder, worse than all the rest, couldn’t be rectified by someone as socially inept as Tony Stark. All he knew was that he wouldn’t be willing to forgive quickly if the roles were reversed. Although, Steve had always been the more moral of the two and usually took the higher ground. By the time he had actually convinced himself to enter the room he was half sold on the idea that maybe it should be Steve apologising to him but even he could tell that was his usual behaviour of trying to back out of every awkward social setting in which he couldn’t use defensive humor coming into play.
Steve couldn’t hear the man edging forward over the intensity of the pain and only realised the other man’s presence when an uncertain hand touched his shoulder. Unprepared for the contact, Steve jumped in surprise and it triggered a fresh wave of agony that sent him withering on the floor.
He began to step away but his shoe lace was under his stationary foot, causing him to tumble forward beside the man. He knocked the satchels over too. This was, of course, an elaborate act in which Steve had untied his lace hours ago in preparation and had plenty of experience in fake falling. His reaction of pain was genuine, however, as the sudden awkward movement pulled at the stitches in his shoulder. Blood was undoubtedly soaking into his shirt under his blazer. He needed to wrap this up quickly and scarper.
"I thought he was supposed to be good? Is he dead?" He asked seriously. "But why was I not informed immediately?"
The rain didn't lighten up and after a few minutes Tony began to feel the effects of the frantic sprint through the cold rain so tugged on Steve's hand to pull him into an abandoned doorway. The space was tight so the rain was mere millimetres from touching them and their bodies were pressed closely together.
Doctor Wright was passing through the crowd quickly as if looking for someone. His wife: he overheard the older man asking a group if they’d seen her. A perfect opportunity for Steve to swoop in. With one last tap of his pocket to ensure he had the liquid, he marched towards the host, pulling a panicked look upon his face. He needed to get the man out of the public space before the man's goons noticed and followed.
Steve had lived his whole life believing that he is a freak and an outcast. It’ll take more than a few months with someone who truly loves him to re-write all of the lost time but eventually it’ll happen; eventually, Steve will wake up in the arms of the man he loves and will know, without a doubt, that he belongs there and, moreover, that he deserves to belong there. Luckily for him, Tony is there to accompany him on this journey and remind him one hundred times a day that he is loved, he is safe and he is not a freak.
It was soon after that he could tell Steve was coming close due to the way he was struggling to control the bucking of his hips. Stark pressed his hands against the firm hips to try and steady the other man.
“It’s only us.” He muttered as his fingers began fumbling with Steve’s belt, “Nobody else in the building.”
“You need to go?” The golden haired man asked, leaning his head to the side. The puppy-like action pulled on his heart strings.
He didn’t remember being moved but when he woke up next he was in a different room and it must have been night as darkness shrouded his surroundings. The soldier, heart beating heavily, peered into the darkness as an uneasy feeling in his subconscious told him that something lurking in the blackness had awoken him. Eyes struggling to adjust, he squinted.
Coulson was beginning to look over at them suspiciously so they swiftly closed the fake searching-through-files task and retreated back to their desks. Steve felt like Natasha had so many more questions to ask though so he would probably be called back in the room within the next few hours. As they left, however, a thought arose to the man and he turned to her to ask,
“We may have kissed once… or twice… or…” He broke off as his embarrassment became debilitating, “But that was all!”
"Okay, we have a pulse but barely. We need to get to the nearest hospital stat." The medic instructed again.
Tony peered up at him with a smile, he had always been able to read through Steve’s attempts at seriousness, “Are you pulling rank on me, Deputy?” He purred seductively.
The coffee was steaming hot but, due to his attention being sucked elsewhere, he periodically slipped on the caffeine even though it burned his tongue slightly. He’d probably notice it in a few hours when he tried to eat or drink anything else. Almost compulsively, Tony checked his watch every few minutes to ensure that time was passing in the right direction; the last 45 minutes had felt like the longest of his whole life.
"Almost as though I didn't want it to be found." He grumbled, pulling his duvet over his head. He had no idea what time it was as since returning home his internal clock had been constantly out of touch.
“Anything eventful happen on the case?” She said, purposefully with her eyebrow risen, for what felt like the one hundredth time.
The contact of Tony’s fingers with the warm metal of the belt was like a bullet as Steve was immediately on his feet and nearly knocked Tony completely off the couch in the process. The genius was half on half off the floor.
A smile ghosted across her lips and Steve could tell she was dying to say ‘I told you so’ as she had been claiming that Stark had a thing for him for months! She peered around to keep an eye on Coulson before whispering, “I knew something had happened! You two have been so weird around each other since coming back!”
The spy sighed and shook his head. This was either going to go really well or be an absolute travesty. He didn't know which to place his bets on.
Tony scowled down at him, “We’re not flirting.” Swiftly, he pulled up the unhurt man and tightened a pair of cuffs around his wrists. He didn’t want to stop and consider whether they really were flirting because that would be the second time in an hour he noticed he liked Steve more than he did before.
Tony realised it was now his time to make his apologises and explain his actions, “I should have thought it through and considered what it would do to you. I regret not doing that… I’m sorry.” His natural instinct had him wanting to make a joke to lighten the mood but he had nearly lost Steve once already so didn’t want to risk it again. He had always been criticised for acting like he had no heart and he was ready to prove everyone wrong.
Steve's eyes turned impossibly colder at the insinuation that Clint was not at a level where he could command them as a unit, "Yes but unlike with the rest of you, I actually know who he is."
"Yes, of course he does. He just chooses not to use it." The ‘out of respect’ and ‘I wish you’d get the hint’ remained unspoken.
"So what do you need me for anyway?" Cap asked, turning away from the sitting man and up to Fury. "It won't take long, right?"
"What did you expect?" Steve challenged while eyeing the genius suspiciously, "For me to break down in tears? Start shaking in shock? Look, Mr Stark, I understand that you don't know much about what I do but I've been unconscious for weeks before and much closer to death more than once previous to now." He forced himself to sit up slightly, "Yes, I'm good at my job but sometimes it's impossible to get out without a few scrapes and bruises."
He jumped in a cab and was at West’s in only a matter of minutes; not long enough for him to chicken out of attending a gay club alone anyways. He peered up at the bright, neon sign for a moment, the music could be heard from outside, before taking a breath and stepping inside. He pushed to the bar in order to find something that would halt the anxious feeling in his stomach.
“Impossible.” Rogers muttered against the other man’s lips. The taste of beer was still dancing across Tony’s lips. He leaned in to deepen the kiss again but Tony’s witty mind was interrupting Steve’s intention.
Tony’s humorous persona dropped as he realised that Steve really was upset by what had transpired inside. He whipped the handcuffs off and hurriedly put them away.
Thor was next and, not as adept at reading body language, he barrelled towards the newcomer with all intentions of giving him a bracing hug to solidify their relationship as brothers in battle. However, Clint managed to snag a finger in a loop of his armour to tug him back. The blond was confused but accepted it as yet another bizarre human social convention. He slipped into a chair at the table next to where Bruce was standing.
“Sir, I am placing you under arrest!” Tony barked, having just appeared behind his colleague and Steve’s eyes rolled instinctively. He then directed his comment towards the guy Steve was talking to, “I’m sorry, sir, but this many is a highly dangerous criminal. We’re been hunting him down for months.”
It was at this point in the night when Steve started to sob. It was all made worse by his feelings of lack of control over the situation. He felt like he’d created a lose-lose situation: Tony goes out for sex and he could find a new partner or Steve asks him to repress his sexual energy and Tony eventually gets bored and leaves!
Tony, now sprawled out on Steve’s soft king size bed struggled to keep his eyes open as Steve cleaned them both up. He hadn’t thought about his come creating a mess of both of their torsos.
The assassin peeped open an eye and peered out from under his blanket. It was beginning to get dark. He'd slept the majority of the day again. Tomorrow he promised himself he'd get back into a routine and start working his shoulder muscles. Perhaps some physical therapy would help, he mused as the man on the phone continued talking.
She was waiting by the door by the time he had managed to climb the several floors to her apartment. Natasha had predicted the state of the man and held out a towel for him to dry himself upon entry. He loved her friends but also she wasn’t willing to allow her couch to get messed up. Her flaming red hair was tied up in a messy bun to keep it from her face as she prepared for bed.
There was a sound from somewhere in the large warehouse and the man silently cursed for jinxing himself. If he died today his eulogy would state how much of an idiot he was. His light eyes scanned the area before, keeping crouched low, he slipped out the emergency fire exit that was close behind him.
It wasn’t clear to the other colleagues in the precinct which man started the fight but all they knew was 10 minutes after Rogers had been called into the briefing room both men were on the floor wrestling out their differences. Unfortunately, neither man heard Captain Fury storming into the room until he made his presence known. The other detectives in the office pretended to be oblivious to the event but secretly a few of them had just won an office bet: Rogers and Stark would fight before the month was up.
"Yeah, I went to get some this morning. Do you eat it? You're not vegetarian or something?" He asked as he backed back out to the lounge and through to the kitchen.
He could hear a groan escape from his lips without him being aware he made it. Some of the stretcher barers bent down to be closer to his head and one of them murmured,
Tony knelt in front of him similarly to how he did a week before. From such close proximity to the man’s perfect body the inventor could see the scars ranging in size littering the torso. Lifting the man’s pant leg, he rolled it up until he had full access to Steve’s amputation site but he could tell by the way Steve clenched his fist that the man felt vulnerable being so exposed. Tony rested his hand on the other knee to reassure him of his purely good intentions. Hadn’t Steve learnt by now that something about that first night tonight had changed the way they viewed each other?
The two men jumped out the car and darted towards the house at full speed. They could hear the van, carrying their back-up, close behind them. Charging the door, Steve led in first and shot into the first room on the right with Stark close behind him.
Within 24 hours, Steve was being prepared to undergo another procedure but this time with the hope of recovering what he’d lost or at least maintaining his life. They had to speed through the beginning stages as the infection in his leg was fighting against them.
“Did I do something wrong?” Big brown eyes grew impossibly larger. He didn’t want to be told that Steve didn’t like him but he couldn’t live his life not knowing.
His muscles were accentuated by the tight shirt he wore. Steve wasn’t vain by any means but Bucky always told him to wear it when heading out and Steve trusted his best friend’s opinion. The less said about his tight, tight jeans the better. He grabbed his trusty, faded leather jacket and keys before slipping out the door. Slamming, it felt like a solid certainty which he couldn’t take back.
The genius just frowned in response but pressed the mug into the man’s hands. Kneeling down on the floor beside Steve, Tony gently lifted the thin material of the vest to reveal the injuries. He hissed at the sight of the dark purple bruising that radiated across Steve’s ribs and lower. Gentle fingers ghosted across the stain until he applied the cooling pad. He managed to restrain a smile at Steve’s sigh of relief.
He coughed to clear his throat, “You didn’t go to medical afterwards?” He didn’t know how Steve managed to get out of it since he never did.
Steve didn’t know why he wanted to cry but he knew he wasn’t about to let it happen moments after his life was saved.
Steve loved working in large parties. People saw so many faces and consumed so much alcohol that they'd struggle to remember their own name let alone his face. He also had the added bonus of being a blond white man in a sea of blond white men. He mingled around seamlessly until he set eyes on his gray hair target.
The sound of a car being launched through the air and crashing into a building broke the air around them and they snapped apart.
"I know my training is impeccable because I learnt from the best." He reached out to rest his hand against Steve's arm effectively halting his movement, "But that's the point. You're the best and we need you." He had a strong sense of deja vu as he recalled several times where he'd been begging the larger man before, "You'd be saving people."
"Jarvis? Where in the tower is he?" He asked quickly. Cap was injured so the last thing he needed was to be wandering the tower freely. He could collapse at any moment.
On this, Stark looked Steve directly in the eye but the man’s butt sprang to his memory so he had to look back down at the surface of the table. He cleared his throat as he realised that he just proved Steve’s point so was now in a pretty sticky situation.
The bar was dark when a damp Steve arrived mere minutes before 8 o’clock which made it harder to scan the room for his date. His stomach tightened when at first he could see his fellow detective anywhere in the long bar. He felt awkward walking up and down the room peeping into the booths and tables so came very close to leaving when he felt someone tap his rain-soaked shoulder.
For Tony Stark the smell of a hospital was somewhat like an itch that just couldn’t be scratched; it was hugely annoying and wouldn’t leave until you dealt with it. That’s without mentioning how the smell would often draw his mind away from whatever topic he was ruminating over at that particular moment: usually something related to the latest case he was working on. Luckily for Stark, however, his father had been a famous inventor so his inheritance ensured that he could usually have at home doctor’s visits or medical care. He wasn’t rich but was wealthy enough for luxuries such as that.
Absent mindedly, Tony’s fingers stroked through the light hairs on Steve’s head, using his fingertips like a gentle comb. His lips twitched up slightly when he heard a hum of contentment radiate out from the reassured man. Smiling, Tony peered down at his companion and felt his heart squeeze. Fighting this feeling would be hard but he didn’t want to pursue any kind of relationship with the man before he figured out if Steve liked him back.
He had a feeling he'd woken up before but forgotten it like when you wake up during the middle of the night but can't remember it the next morning. However, Steve could swear he'd woken up several times but, he cracked on eye open, he wasn't in his bed.
Steve huffed a laugh, "Of course they do but sometimes they want someone reliable. Who they know will do the job. Anyway, I have to go now, Mr Stark. Please do not contact me again."
The mock look of offence was almost realistic but Clint couldn’t sustain it and laughed, “I hear wedding bells.”
They pulled apart when a beam of light hit them. Shocked, they glanced up to see the sun breaking through the storm and sending rays down on them through gaps between the buildings.
"I didn't lose him. He walked out!" Tony puffed his chest and began to defend his honor as it really wasn't completely his fault. If they should be blaming anyone then it should be Cap himself for being an idiot.
As if scolding himself for being a terrible nurse, Tony leapt up and rushed to grab Steve's drink. He carefully brought it to the man's lips. Steve tried not to notice how intently the billionaire stared at his mouth.
“Woah, woah, woah!” The man called out. His voice immediately registered as familiar to the detective making him slow down, “Steve!”
“Rogers.” He replied, “Stressed?” The man’s hair was sticking out at strange angles from the frequency that he had been running his hands through it.
Unsure of what was happening, Steve stood blankly in his bedroom as Tony hurried around the room whilst he assembled extra blankets and pillows until the bed looked not too dissimilar from a nest. Finally he placed the candle on Steve’s bedside table and instructed the man to climb back into bed which the soldier did obediently. Moments later, the genius sat down on the other side of the bed; he was sat up leaning against the headboard and his science journal on his lap but he peered down at the other man.
“Hold on, Cap! Not far now. They’ll set you right.” The voice was young and optimistic but Steve could hear the doubt trying to break through. They thought he was going to die. He thought he was going to die.
"Doctor Yepsem!" He forced familiarity into his voice as he marched forward with his hands stretched out ready for a handshake, "How long has it been?! Too long!" He hoped his enthusiasm would wipe over the vagueness.
Phantom limb pain (PLP) refers to ongoing painful sensations that seem to be coming from the part of the limb that is no longer there. The limb is gone, but the pain is real.
“D’you think Captain Fury was serious when he said we are the team’s best detectives?” His voice was low and tense. The opinion of his Captain had always meant a lot to him; a habit which had stuck from his military days.  It didn’t help that he was hoping to become a Captain someday too.
Despite not seeing the other man’s face, Tony could hear the laugh in his voice. It would have been almost undetectable if Tony wasn’t so familiar with his voice from so many interrogations, “We actually run a charity here. We offer work to down-on-their-luck civilians and veterans. It’s mostly just making little things that then get sold to pay their wages and keep them afloat until they can get established somewhere else. It gives them wages, good references and a reason to get up every morning.” They made it to the floor where tens of men and women were sat at the tables making anything and everything from lamp shades to baskets. Steve glanced at the Detective solemnly, “A program like this would have really helped me a lot when I first came out of the military.”
It was completely by chance that Tony Stark was just coming home after a very successful date; so successful that he wasn’t getting home until nearly 3:30. He froze when he noticed what looked like a pile of clothes on the shiny floor of the lobby as his mind leapt around for possible explanations.
He raised his left hand in the air and flashed the band of metal in the harsh light of the precinct. With a smirk carrying through his tone, he called back to his friend, “I think it works both ways...Nobody thought I’d manage to bag a respectable man like Steve!”
Steve had barely looked at him the whole time which wouldn’t have been unusual if they hadn’t embarked on their relationship for the last month. Previously to properly meeting Steve he would have been more than happy for the man to just keep out of his way. He knew that Steve was upset that it had taken him so long to decide on their relationship. He clearly imagined it would only be bad news.
Clint looked shocked and turned to face the other man, "His house? How should I know where he lives?"
Steve had to duck his head to hide the grin that was blossoming across his lips. He didn’t want Fury to notice and get suspicious but he just couldn’t control his happiness. Finding out that Stark also wanted to take their relationship seriously was hugely gratifying. He’d always pegged Stark, as most people did, as a ‘love ‘em and leave ‘em’ type and he recognised that Tony often played into the reputation he had developed.
“25, actually… but not Steve. I had no idea he liked guys. We’ve never had the kind of relationship where we sit and talk about our sex lives.” There wasn’t really need for him to explain his awkward relationship with the other detective. From day one, Steve and Tony had never seen eye to eye.  Steve was silently nodding along to that statement, “Actually, we’ve never really talked about anything outside of a case. I barely know him.”
There is a nsfw scene in this chapter but before it starts  the sign ‘=======‘ is used so feel free to skip that part if you’re uncomfortable.
It said, No, I tend to heal faster than most people. Besides, it’s always frustrating trying to describe pain and injuries when we can’t understand each other.
“Then don’t. Come for me.” Tony purred. He took Steve into his mouth again and with barely a touch the soldier came.
"S? Your real name starts with an S?" He cried out in excitement, ignoring the sighs coming from across the line, "Does Clint know it?"
“Did you just call yourself a ‘good-“ Steve started chuckling when Tony cut him off by capturing his lips in his. Needless to say, no more talking was done for a very long time.
The work he was putting into regaining his ability to walk kept him busy in the day but nighttime was completely different.
Steve held his neck to stop him moving back and kissed him again, “Thank you for making it feel all so okay.”
The quick pick up at SHIELD ended up being significantly longer than he'd anticipated but for the better as word had gotten around that Iron Man was on a mission and someone had procured him a high speed jet. It allowed them to reach Delaware twice as fast but that still wasn't fast enough for Stark.
The Avengers were more than shocked when they found someone waiting for them in the conference room the next day. Did they have a guest to their briefing? They all shot each other suspicious and alert looks.
It was over an hour later when the last criminal had been taken off the scene in the police van and the injured thug had been transported to hospital. Rogers and Stark were left behind and began making their way over to the unmarked police car they’d been staking out in. It was once they got there that Steve spoke.
“This… situation isn’t so bad.” His eyes traced the other man’s face, “At least we both… We both- Um.” Steve stuttered as his eyes locked onto the way Tony’s tongue darted out to moisten his lips rapidly.
Steve barely looked up at him when he left. Sighing, Steve was ashamed of himself for acting this way but he could practically see Stark’s thoughts forming. He knew that the man was only trying to be nice to him because he felt sorry for the poor cripple who needed help. Steve threw the newspaper aside despite its innocence in the situation. One thing he knew was that Stark hated him 24 hours ago but now is acting differently due to him being perceived as an invalid and Steve couldn’t accept that.
Suddenly,as Steve watched on, the criminal threw a heavy punch at the other detective then ran towards an alley with Stark on his heels.
Cars surrounded him and a man in a dark coat and an eye patch approached him. Immediately Steve was suspicious as he’d learnt from the comics of his youth that the men with eyepatches were usually the villain of the story.
Suddenly, the taller man’s fingers froze and he moved his head slightly to the left as though to observe Tony through his peripheral vision. Like a goldfish, he opened and closed his mouth several times before the fully phrased sentence tumbled out with less grace than usual.
The tuxedo was tight but not uncomfortably so. It was just enough to accentuate his body shape but still able mask the light padding covering his shoulder. He really needed to stop pulling it and actually allow it to heal. He rolled his eyes as he thought of how pissy Clint would be when he found out he wasn’t resting it.
“Detectives Rogers and Stark, you team up to stake out the drug-lord Stark has been tracing.” Fury barked out from the podium in the meeting room. The two detectives glanced across the room at each other sceptically; while each of them had been working in the New York police precinct for some time, they had never been given many assignments together as the majority of the team assumed their personalities would conflict. This was assumed correctly.
"You know full well I still don't know who they are so how am I supposed to know what they want from me?" He asked, verging on defensive. People have wanted stuff from him a little too much for him to completely trust...well, anyone.
“Have as many sexual fantasies as you want at home, Rogers. I know I’m just too damned gorgeous but for now can you focus?” Tony mocked effectively snapping the detective out of his own head.
The door clicked closed behind the man and Tony allowed himself to drop his head against the table, disheartened. After over 6 months of tracking the gang leader, the detective was still no closer to an arrest and Steve Rogers seemed to know that.
Tony ran his hands through his sweat-stiffened, greasy and blood clotted hair; it stuck up in filthy tufts and transferred some of the grime onto his bruised hands. He licked his lips, the taste of salt transferring to his tongue, as he hovered outside Steve’s room.
"I was just checking the weather... I mean, I was asking what time... Okay, the truth is that I wanted to know if he really didn't know me or if that was just a front he put on." His shoulders drooped a little instantly telling Natasha that A) The assassin really didn't have any clue who Stark was and B) Tony's ego really was that inflated and fragile.
Steve tried not to look disgruntled, “But nothing happened after that. It has just been kind of awkward since then.”
For over a year, he had silently lusted for this Adonis but, since allowing himself to actually get closer to Steve, his feels had only doubled. Not only was he a walking Greek statue but he was actually super kind, intelligent, funny and lovable. Tony rolled his eyes as he caught his train of thought wandering... Did he seriously call Steve loveable?
“Rogers, Detective Stark.” The two criminals shared a nod, unspoken communication appeared to pass between them, before she turned and left the two men alone. Tony’s stomach flipped at the sight of Rogers in what must be one of his finest suits as he had to do a quick double take at the way it nipped in at the man’s slim waist.
“Oh, God.” Steve murmured as Tony’s hand never strayed from massaging his dick through the thin material.
Clint knew one last ditch attempt to convert his mentor, "You'd still be free, Cap." He slipped in the familiar nickname, "You'd have to report maybe once a week max. You'd be given assignments then you can go and come back when it's done. Nobody will be on your back and no corporation will own you."
The billionaire jumped when Steve finally spoke as he didn’t know the man had woken up yet, “It was a mine.”
She clearly could read the upset in his voice as she had already buzzed the door open before saying, “Come up, Steve.”
He watched as Steve inched forward to pull the prosthetic up onto his lap so he could begin assessing it. It was sleek and didn’t seem to hold even half of the technology of the SHIELD one, no wires were on display. The light metal was cool against his fingers as he silently touched the leg.
The steaming cup was done in record time and he’d taken extra care to ensure it was exactly right since this was the man he was trying to fool with his masquerade. Carefully, he placed the Americano down and slid it across whilst trying extraordinarily hard not to spill it. He coughed and lowered his voice to call, “Americano for Steve!”
It was almost as if Steve could read Tony’s rapidly firing thoughts as he gently eased the other man’s hand away from the scar tissue and onto his shoulder. Now was not the time for reliving trauma. Tony didn’t try and explore the scars further as he knew from his own experience how triggering it can be.
“Here,” Stark insisted, picking up the candle and his documents. Gently, he encouraged Steve to stand and follow him as he led them up to the floor a couple above.
Steve huffed a laugh, “I know you think that everything I can do is a result of the serum but I was a Captain before the serum. I led a large squad and had a reputation for helping out and doing what I could.” Tony could sense that Steve was glossing over the details of his heroics, “So he thought it would be worth testing the serum on me. Besides, I was a guy who couldn’t exactly say no since the alternative was death by infection. He said that there was a chance the serum could restore my leg but it didn’t... I don’t think he really believed that it could but maybe my belief was all it took to seal the deal.”
There was a moment of silence, they stared at each other until Stark filled the gap, “I always pictured you sleeping in a full pyjama suit, buttoned fully up.”
It was an old, red brick building with a small door on the side to admit visitors and due to Tony’s extensive research on Steve, he knew that it had once been a shoe factory. The windows were small and high but looked liked they had not been replaced since the original factory as they were thin paned and grimy. The detective strode up to the door and realised that there was nothing to indicate that the building was currently in use as no signage had been put up so Tony knew it was one of those ‘you know where to go if you’re in the know’ situations.
Slipping back into the coffee store, he called his colleague, Clint, to see what he thought of the whole situation.
The inventor had finished the fitting but he remained motionless aside from the minute movements of his fingers. Steve’s breath hitched at the fondness of the action and it took him a moment to register when Tony finally told him to stand and try it out.
“You can’t sleep either?” The shorter man broke out. His heart speed up slightly as he awaited a response.
This time Clint did have to bite down on his tongue. Stark struggled to pretend it didn't annoy him too.
“Aw, shucks. I should have known you’d side with him.” With a sigh he pushed off the boxes and knelt down to begin clearing up his mess until Natasha placed her boot on a document he was collecting up.
Tony continued to learn his way around Steve’s chest through his fingertips and promised himself to commit it to memory. They shared in the companionable silence for some time before Tony spoke again.
At that, the hero couldn’t stop himself and a tear dropped from his eye. It escaped over his lashes and fled down his cheek. He couldn’t even bring himself to wipe it away. Tony’s face floated behind the nurse, his eager to please eyes open wide as he watched. A genuine smile was brightening up his face.
Steve and Tony were standing opposite Fury with each a different expression on their face; Fury looked weary, Tony was angry and Steve was just plain worried. The deaf man tried to read the other’s lips as they argued and he could only hope that Tony was representing his point of view well.
“You’ve really fallen for him.” She commented, softly knowing that this was information that Steve had probably been subconsciously denying for weeks.
“But if it’s the last thing on your Want To Do list then it’s still on the list. The last thing on the list is still a thing to be done...” Clint’s words remained with Tony long after the spy had dashed off without even saying goodbye.
Steve nodded which made Tony continue, “But, for now, how about another movie and we get snuggled under that blanket?”
Steve kicked down the door, sending it reeling back into the wall, and they shot inside both shouting, “NYPD! Stay where you are and drop your weapons!”
Eventually, with a slight smirk, Tony reached up and pressed his lips against Steve's. The man responded instantly, pulling Tony impossibly closer and deepening the kiss. He carded his fingers through the short hair and the other responded with a contented moan.
However, he dropped his hand to rest on Steve’s waist band and, upon Steve reaching out for Tony’s own belt, he touched the other man through his pyjama pants. Their mouths parted as Steve’s breath hitched and his fingers clumsily rushed to undo Tony’s belt. It took him a moment but eventually he released him and managed to get Tony out of his skinny jeans.
Before Tony’s sleep heavy brain had time to realise Steve was closing the small void between them, pressing their lips together gently. Before he had even recovered from the initial surprise Steve was already pulling back with red embarrassment tinging his cheeks.
Steve wanted to slam his head against the wall. Surely if he pursued Tony last time then the man knows Steve is interested and therefore should be the one to act next? Steve can’t even tell whether Stark likes him or was just looking for someone to mess around with. He’d always viewed the other detective as slightly promiscuous so wouldn’t be surprised if the other man actually had no real interest in him.
“Really really. I’m done messing with you Steve and I realise now that when I have in the past was a huge mistake.” His cell started ringing, breaking the well cultivated atmosphere between them. He glanced at it, assessing the urgency of the call before apologising and picking it up.
“I like you, Steve… It may not have always been this way but now I’ve gotten to know you I really like you.”
Steve knelt up and crawled to the edge of the bed. Tony stopped so they were face to face; with Steve kneeling they were nearly perfect height. The soldier reached up and cupped his partner’s cheek in his hand and smiled softly when Tony automatically leant into it.
The end of call tone murmured into Tony's ear and he pulls the cell away to peer at it as though it had personally offended him. Most people he called wanted to be on the receiving end of his conversations so this man was a new mystery for him to solve. During the duration of the call it was almost as if the assassin had forgotten himself and actually enjoyed the interaction until he remembered he was going for the distant non-contact relationship so hung up.
There was a beat of silence where everyone glanced awkwardly at each other. Tony’s brows twitched but he’d committed this far so roared on,
“I wanted to go but I don’t know if he’d appreciate my visit… He’s so much better than me.” If being stoic wouldn’t work then he’d have to attempt sharing his feelings and being friendly to her in order to break her cold exterior.
“Please,” Tony scoffed as he led Steve towards the exit. Patrons were watching fascinated at the opportunity to catch a glimpse of a dangerous criminal, “Everyone knows Nick loves me.” Every knew that Nick certainly did not love Tony. He could barely go a day without cursing the rule breaking, meeting ditching, know-it-all detective, “Besides, I just couldn’t wait any longer to see you in a pair of handcuffs.” He purred flirtatiously not realising that Rogers took the responsibility of policing with a touch more importance than he did.
Steve smirked and the music span to allow him to start with the chorus, "If you like Piña Coladas and getting caught in the rain. If you're not into yoga, if you have half a brain. If you like making love at midnight, in the dunes of the cape. I'm the love that you've looked for, write to me, and escape."
The man laughed too, "It's surprising who you see in such a large city. Almost like because there is so many of us crammed in you're bound to recognized someone!"
That night, he slept easier than he had in weeks. However, little did he know that within a handful of months he’d end up under the ice and have to endure the longest sleep of his life.
Steve played along, humming out a moan twice as loud and twice as guttural. Tony reacted straight away, pushing the other detective up against the shelving unit behind them and kissing down the man’s neck. Pressed so close together they could feel the swell of the other’s arousal pressing against the confinement of their pants.
Once on the metal steps he glanced over the edge, a three floor drop, and jumped. He braced for impact and rolled to lessen the force. Nevertheless, he had to shake himself off when he stood up. Peering back up he sighed; he was getting too old for pulling stunts like that. The moon shined down on him from above the large building.
Before he knew it Steve was being lowered into a casket-esque contraption with no promise he’d even make it out alive
The harsh lighting caused the gang leader’s swollen cheekbone to glisten as he rose from the table and left. The image of the criminal’s ruffled blond hair that feathered over his forehead would stay with Tony for longer than he thought would be necessary.
The man came immediately and his hand was almost on the cup when Tony, maybe due to the thrill of being so close to fooling him or maybe due to stupidity, said, “Or maybe I should have called ‘Just Steve’.”
They were content and they knew that, as long as they had each other, everything would be okay. They’d faced challenges before but anything that came at them now would only be easier since they could fight it together.
Steve moved his mouth away hesitantly, “Is this- Is this really the place?” He sighed out when Tony began sucking against his neck in a hint of what was to come.
Fury continued, “Everyone will be getting a course of ASL sign language to aid communications but maybe for now you try to keep the one sided arguments to a minimum, Stark.”
“I was with Barton all night,” Tony gestured across to the shorter detective, “He needed help on a stakeout and since me and Rogers weren’t making much progress on the Jensen case I offered.”
"How did you do it?" Steve had only just placed the cell to his ear when an unfortunately familiar voice burst out. "I've been trying to figure it out for days. The autopsy came back clear but there wasn't a single mark on him." Stark barely breathed as he enthused rapidly.
“If you would take your job seriously then neither of us would be in this position of me babysitting you in the first place!” Growling, he managed to enunciate through gritted teeth.
"Is this the 'specialist' you found? He looks like an Action Man." He scoffed, doubting everything from Cap's abilities to his intelligence. He span back to gaze at the large man.
The movement drew Sam’s attention to the man’s neck and his eyes widened the second he clocked the dark bruises growing across the side. He frowned before his eyes lightened with realisation, “Who is it? You didn’t say you’re seeing someone! You usually tell me everything… Too much really.”
The crowd was parting to let a small boy through to the front. He must have only been 8 or 9 but was brave enough to come right to the front and stand across from where Steve was sitting. His tiny Captain America costume melted the man’s heart.
He had to consider the possibility of this being a hallucination when he spotted Steve Rogers sat on the couch in a vest and gray sweats. The blond head was resting against the back of the couch and his eyes were closed. Tony’s eyes noticed that the super solider’s arms were clasped around his midsection and would shake when the man groaned. The oversized popsicle was clearly trying to ride out some pain. He was about to turn and leave when he remembered his own remanence of the mission was paining him too and he hadn’t noticed Steve in the medical bay with the rest of them afterwards.Fury always ensured that Stark got seen to by medical professionals despite his attempt every time to run back to the lab.
"If I'd known you like to be the dominant type I would have come more prepared. Although contrary to popular belief I'm not a massive fan of phone sex." The voice commented offhandedly.
“Dr. Abraham Erskine, at your service. I represent the Strategic Scientific Reserve and I have a proposition.”
The first to enter was Dr Banner. He walked in confidently before his insecurities caused embarrassment to crash down on him when he realised he was the first. All eyes were on him. The Doctor instantly read the stranger's body language and recognised it immediately as something he often displayed himself: A don't touch me message. Instead, the scientist gave an awkward wave and introduced himself quickly. It seemed the assassin had no preconceived ideas about him or The Other Guy which was rare but definitely a relief. He hated walking into a room and being identified only by being 'that guy who broke Harlem. You know, the green one'.
“So that is fine in times of need but not to leave the head space?” Tony summarised whilst scratching his beard.
There was so much food it was practically a mountain of calories being placed on his lap for him to devour but his stomach was grumbling demandingly. He lifted the fork hesitantly, "Is this poisoned?"
In chapter 2, Tony hinted at an argument the boys had had where Steve turned the lights off to stop it. Here it is!
Stark froze in a moment of blind panic as subconsciously he had hoped that Steve would still be under sedation from the operation to remove the bullet from his side. At least nobody was here to revel in Stark’s awkwardness for the next few minutes.
“Fine. Yes, I’m pretty sure he meant it considering how if you put our arrest numbers together it’s higher than the rest of the team’s put together… But you’re still a couple behind me, for the record.” He added the second bit afterwards as though it was merely an afterthought and not something constantly spinning around his mind; Steve was always doing better so Tony would jump and any evidence which proved they were equals.
Open mouthed and wide eyed, Stark stood stock still staring at Steve’s scarred and damaged stump, “What the fuck. What the fuck? What the fuck?” His eyes flicked between the amputation and the twisted prosthetic leg that lay distorted on the carpeted floor.
“Help,” The soldier managed to vocalise through his clenched jaw. His face was red and veins were prominent on his forehead.
The popcorn bowl fell on the ground, tossing cornels and popcorn across the plush carpet, as Tony shifted to get his body closer to Steve’s. His hand rested on Steve’s hip and the soldier was more than happy for it to stay there.
The backpacks were heavy on their backs, stocked with supplies and water. Steve could hear that further back in the unit someone’s pack was making a slight noise that echoed each step. It distracted him for a moment; perhaps it was a button colliding with a tin mug strapped to the outside of the bag to save room, maybe it was the dog tags of a fallen soldier clicking against others man’s on his chest. Steve shook his head and forced himself to concentrate but it was hard in the heat of summer with sweat dripping down his spine. Perhaps if he had had a better night’s sleep or drank more water today then it wouldn’t have happened but whatever led him to the mine must have had a plan for him. Maybe, one day, he’d even call it destiny.
They passed throughout the rest of the large building without incident and most of the rooms appeared to be either staff rooms, offices or rest rooms. If Tony didn’t already know how crooked Rogers was he may have been tempted to drop all suspicion against the man as it seemed squeaky clean.
Steve met up with the team and headed down to the lab for a quick catch up on Bruce’s attempts to track down the tesseract. Steve hoped he could do it; the man deserved a win after everyone had just been talking about him turning into a giant green monster all day and the scientist had definitely heard what they had been saying. Steve had already decided that he liked the awkward and uncomfortable scientist as they had both faced adversity throughout their lives.
Rogers passed back behind the slab of wood and lowered himself down onto his own chair. Pinching his lips together for a moment, he shrugged, “It didn’t seem in character for you to refuse especially since you’ve been spying on us for months now. I know how it works, intel is intel.”
They walked home hand in hand while their conversation kept them distracted from the sodden shirts and drops dripping down their faces.
They kissed and neither knew how long for but they split as their lungs became desperate for breath. As they parted the billionaire suddenly realised that his hands had snaked up onto Steve’s naked torso with his fingers caressing the hardness of his abs. He felt slight bumps which were the light scar tissue left over from the accident. He dropped them awkwardly and Steve chuckled.
She leant her head, “He can’t do all of those things and still be a good detective?” She challenged, "Besides, he's never flirted with me."
The sudden pressure had Steve’s knees weak making him grab hold of the shelves behind him to stabilise himself.  He breathed deep as Tony’s tongue began to circle the head, bringing out every trick he knew to provoke those sounds. Successfully, he noted smugly.
“Is it okay if I kiss you or... where are your boundaries?” Tony asked hesitantly. He didn’t want to fuck this up.
“I could ask the same thing.” The man stepped closer until Tony could almost feel his warm breath against his cheek. His eyes were even more beautiful up close and they didn’t seem angry, just weary. Tiny drops of rain were collecting on his pale hair in perfect little pellets.
Steve realised it was meant as a light, joking comment but the idea of his colleagues all whispering about him being a prude behind his back felt like a slap to the face. If he had been more sober he would have controlled his expression but unfortunately the hurt and upset translated onto his face extremely clearly. Stark didn’t get a chance to clarify his statement as Steve had grabbed the hand of his friend and rushed off through the crowds. Stark dropped his head into his hands as he realised that he had most definitely fucked up.
Did he feel as though someone had dropped his body from the 10th floor of a building? Yes. The aching had penetrated right into his bones and the wound itself pulled at the stitches with every step or mere movement. That's without mentioning the weariness that caused him to blink heavily every couple of seconds.
“Really? Well, I guess I wouldn’t blame him. If you go too long without seeing this face you get withdrawal symptoms.” He chuckled lightly but his dark eyes traced the lines in between the tiles on the floor. Over the years he’d become proficient in the art of disguising his emotions but sometimes, when his brain was working double pace, a slight twitch of the mouth or eye would give him away. He shifted his stance.
