A guilty knot lodged itself in Steve’s throat, choking him. “We need to get out of here. I’ll explain everything later.”
Steve leaned down, pressing his mouth fleetingly against Tony. The pressure of a mouth on his split lip made Tony shudder, a shiver running down his clumsy limbs. “I just need two little words,” Steve whispered against Tony’s mouth. He pulled back, still close enough their noses could touch. “Say it, Tony. I know you want to. Stop fighting.”
“It’s Star Wars.” Tony corrected automatically, but he was already trailing after Steve to the TV area.
“OK, OK. I’m sorry.” Steve made to take a step forward, stopping when Tony hissed involuntarily.  “I’m just going to stay here. I won’t touch you, just tell me how you are feeling. You don’t look right.”
Maria hummed and slowly pressed the edge of her nail into centre of the hive. The movement was the same as what she did to the blistered on her fingers from her cigarettes. Maria always laughed when she popped her blistered but Tony didn’t know why because it wasn’t funny at all. He whimpered as the pressure increased. Her nail cut into his skin, pain spiderwebbing across his back.
Steve dropped down on the bed, clutching the picture and staring down at it intently. This was a romantic picture; he and Tony were in a romantic relationship. Steve looked around the room, still holding the photograph tightly. He and Tony were sharing a room, sharing a bed. Heat flared across his cheeks, his mind reeling. It had only been seconds ago that Steve had even realised that there was something more to how he felt about Tony than friendship. This was too much, too fast. Panic scratched at his throat and he swallowed, shoving the photograph back onto the side table. His fingers had left little bloody prints along the silver edge of the frame and Steve cursed, rubbing at it only to smear the blood into faint pink strips.
Tony blinked pale blue eyes at him, barely able to focus. The whites of his eyes were bloodshot, his pupils blown wide. After a few moments, he seemed to realise that Steve was crouched next to him and a sad, crumpled smile unfolded across his face. There was a fine layer of dirt covering Tony’s skin, emphasising the lines that appearing in the corners of his eyes as his expression lifted.
Steve opened his mouth, another question unfurling across his tongue only to stop as pain shot through his side. He inhaled in surprise as it rippled through his body, the shock of it sending him stumbling across the bedroom floor.
“It will keep you safe.” Tony retorted sharply. The A.I. was watching him, eyes narrowed ready for a fight.  Despite his fierce expression Steve couldn’t help but think how small and very alone he looked in the otherwise the huge, empty workshop. Who did the A.I. talk to when Steve wasn’t here? Did any of the other Avengers come and visit, did they think of him as Tony or was he just another machine to them, to be used and left behind?
To the right was a small en-suite. Steve rummaged through the bathroom mirror, smiling as he found a familiar first aid kit. He gingerly pulled his uniform off his shoulders, leaving the bodysuit half hanging off his hips. The nanobots were all but gone, a few remained twitched across the bullet wound, working hard to drag the torn skin together. Steve knew without them he would have been dead a long time ago but the sight of them still made his skin crawl with unease. The rest of the wound was a gaping red hole, swollen and infected looking. Spiderwebbing out from the wound were dark angular lines, poison running through his system. Steve stared down at his torso, his jaw clenched. He just didn’t understand why he wasn’t healing. Even a base-level human would have clotted.
“His blood tests came back clean but his weight loss is very concerning.” Doctor Carter was saying, “Are you sure he is eating fine?”
Steve’ eyes flickered down, remembering the tight, dark navy Commander’s uniform he was wearing. Tony’s gaze followed the tight lines of the suit, humming appreciatively. Steve looked at him with a raised eyebrow and Tony shrugged awkwardly, his cheeks glowingly faintly pink.
The boy took a step back. Panic flared across his face and he raised his stick wobblily. “How did you know my name. Are you with them?”
Ever since he’d got his own room, there had been a rule that Peter had to knock before coming into his parents’ room. They didn’t tell him why, other than it was rude. Peter wasn’t exactly sure why it was rude and often forgot.
“What?” Steve turned to look at him. Tony’s jaw was tight, his eyes turned away from Steve. “no, why-“
His body was humming, vibrating with renewed health. He breathed deeply in relief, almost smiling. Steve had been vaguely aware of Tony moving around him, tweaking the nanobots that were holding his wounded body together, tracking his vitals. At points the pain had been all-encompassing, swallowing him whole and taking him somewhere cold and dark and far away. Tony had been at side throughout it. There had been many times during the Avengers when they would stay with each other while one of them was injured. This Tony was made of sharp, unfamiliar edges but he had stayed. Steve hadn’t thought he would ever get that again.
“Let’s see if we can’t shave off another minute, shall we?” Tony said instead and his stomach flipped with familiar terror laced adrenaline as he plunged downwards, a bullet into a war zone.
Steve sighed, “I just want to help you. This isn’t you.” The words rang true as he spoke them. He hated seeing this pitiful version of Tony almost as much as he had hated the maniac who had replaced his friend in the future. Neither were Tony, they were insults to the man he knew. “The Tony Stark I know is a hero, a role model.”
He stared up at the ceiling blindly, his fingers tapping agitatedly against his clothed stomach. He had slept badly ever since he and Steve had opened his father’s study; disrupted sleep giving way to full-blown insomnia. Tony suffered from disturbed sleep patterns fairly often, his brain too busy, too fast to let him rest. But this time, he felt different, more unsettled than usual. The fragments of sleep he had managed were filed with distorted memories, childish monsters:  his mother crying, blood seeping from beneath the door of his father’s study, his bones cracking, piercing through his hands and feet. Tony woke up covered in sweat, gagging as if the injuries, the blood was real. Even when he wasn’t dreaming, he felt wrong, imagining there was something under his skin, sickness churning beneath the surface, threatening to seep out if he let his guard down.
Tony smiled, a small, weary thing that flitted across his face. “I can’t tell you how much I have wanted to hear you say that.”
Tony pulled a face. He was leaning casually against the wall, one long leg crossed over the other. “You’ll have to be more specific, I’m afraid.”
Tony stepped closer, footsteps loud against the polished floor. The liquid metal around him was blurring, disintegrating. “You tried to kill me, remember. The violence, the possessiveness. It’s not normal.  That is what we do to each other.”
Doctor Carter hummed, “I agree. I believe that Tony may have some issues with his digestive tract. It would explain his weight loss, the pain in his abdomen, and his upset stomach. I suggest we refer him for some more tests. Have you ever heard of a Sigmoidoscopy?”
“Don’t worry, baby.” She would say, smiling soothingly when he cried. “I’m here. I will look after you.”
Bucky, Sharon and Sam were waiting, weapons ready. Bucky held out his shield, offering. Steve smiled at them, a feeling of rightness, of hope, inflating his chest. It felt for the first time in a long time that he was making the right choice. Steve took the shield, swinging it into the place over his shoulder.
“You either join me willing or I make you.” The Hydra Supreme growled, ignoring the choking, soundless cries escaping Tony. “I’d say I don’t want to hurt you, but we both know that some part of me always wants to hurt you.”
Steve was shaking his head again but his expression was soft, fond. It was easy to convince him to take a break for a couple of hours.
“She was mind controlled.” From behind him, another figure approached. His was voice was weary but familiar. Bucky. Steve turned to face his oldest friend, his expression darkening, frowning at what he saw. The man stood before him sounded like Bucky but he was wearing Steve’s uniform, covered familiar red, white and blue.
Peter didn’t know why he was asking those questions; every time he did he just shook his head and crawled into his Daddy’s lap and made himself as small as he could. Peter wasn’t doing a very good job of looking after his Daddy because his Daddy kept looking like he was going to cry.
The last comment slipped out before Steve could stop it, a final note in his stream of consciousness. He snapped his jaw shut in embarrassment. He didn’t even know why he had commented on that. He had known for a while that Tony was bisexual, he had heard enough about Tony’s relationship with Tiberius Stone to draw conclusions about Tony’s dating history before the Avengers. But despite knowing, Steve had never seen Tony’s relationships with men personally. The carousel of admirers in and out of Tony’s bed had always been female only. Steve didn’t know why seeing the blond-haired man in Tony’s bed had bothered him so much.
Maria met Jarvis’ eyes, “He’s got a delicate stomach, I don’t want him being sick because we’re forcing him to eat when he doesn’t feel like it.”
‘T.O.N.Y?’ Tony mumbled through his fingers. The way Tony said his name made Steve imagine it an acronym. Steve nodded, releasing Tony’s mouth. A quirked smile lingered on Tony’s face, his eyes curious, full of ideas despite the situation. “How was he?”
“Good work, lookout,” Steve said, presenting his fist. A small hand bumped against his knuckles excitedly. “Right all we need to do is get there.”
“Is that what this is about it? You’re angry at me because I said you didn’t have to come out today.”
Peter stumbled away from door, almost falling over his pyjama trousers in his haste to get away. He shoved his fist into his mouth to stop the scream that had caught in the back of his throat from coming out. His papa had hit his Daddy, he’s Daddy had been crying and on the floor. It was just like Amy had said. A sob escaped him before he could stop it and he glanced over his shoulder sharply, expecting his Papa to be there.
“Didn’t you hear? I drank away my company.” Tony mumbled, chin still tucked down into his chest. His tone was scathing, dripping with self-loathing. They had reached the end of the alley and bright fluorescent lights flooded the main road, illuminated Tony’s sunken, haggard looking features. Tony came to a stop and looked across the road, his mouth twisted unhappily, his face crumpling like wet paper. Steve followed his gaze.
“Take your t-shirt off.” His mother said as soon as the front door closed. She was watching him, her face was back to pale, marble neutrality, the fading impression of happiness lingering in the glow in her cheeks and the pinch of skin at the corner of her eyes. Her eyes were dark, intent and Tony shivered under their focus, shying away from her attention. “Tesoro, let me see.”
Tony stopped vomiting with a gasp of relief. He turned around stiffly, his eyes streamed and laughed at Steve’s expression. “Gees, even my conscience is disgusted with me.”
Peter threw himself desperately into his Daddy’s lap, pressing his face into the man’s soft t-shirt and fisting his hands into the material.
Clint cringed, “You know, I think Nat needs some help,” he gestured to his left, already inching away. “I’m just going to go.”
Maria smiled at Doctor Carter, gesturing for Tony to take a seat as she finished a series of soft-spoken pleasantries. They had seen this doctor thrice now, more than any other doctor since Doctor Everette. The doctor weighed Tony, tutting disappointedly and then got him to lie down on the examination table, pressing his fingers along the concaved lines of Tony’s abdomen and asking him to say when it hurt. Tony’s stomach always felt a bit tender, sore from the still constant fluctuation between diarrhoea and constipation and he wavered, unsure which parts of his torso were meant to be sore.
He sat up straight on the chair and stretched his arms. God, that felt nice. He looked over at DUM-E and told him to make some coffee for him. The bot soon returned with a cup, looking quite excited because it had been a while since he was asked by his master to make him something. But when Tony looked inside the cup contained something which looked like coffee but smelled nothing like one. The engineer sighs.
When Peter came out he saw Tony looking outside the balcony he ran up to him and hugged him. The brunet was startled at first but then he smiled and hugged back, wrapping his arms around the small boy with care. The boy nuzzled deeper into the hug.
“Where’s Bucky?” Steve asks, looking around for his metal armed friend. Natasha tells him that he was in his room. That he didn’t want to come out until Steve came back.
“Thank you for doing this, Tony.” Steve told him with a genuine, heartfelt smile. A smile that conveyed so much love and affection that it earned a blush from the omega.
“Alright, good. Then, I’ll see you later okay.” And with that he started to ride off, still looking back at the brunet as he did.
Little by little Bucky starts to brighten up. Turning back into his old self day by day. And after the end of the first week he was even able to vividly recall his past memories with Steve now. And he was getting along with the rest of them team too. Well, excluding him of course. Bucky was simply expressionless when he was with him. Well, he'd just have to work on that later.
Steve reached out to caress his brother’s face. Trying to comfort him. He wanted to touch him. Wipe away the tears, the blood, the pain. Anything to lessen the distressed expression of his beloved brother.
After dinner Tony helped Peter with his math homework and later on the two of them drew pictures together in his room. Laughing at each other’s silly drawings of animals that had no resemblance to the real thing. Tony concluded that he wasn’t very good at arts either.
It may not be clear but if one looks closely at the billionaire it can be seen that he looked a bit nervous and quite anxious for the impending meeting with SHIELD and the US officials on the topic of the Winter Soldier.
“Good morning, Peter. Did you get enough sleep yesterday? I know that project of yours must have kept you up for quite a while.” He said taking out a carton of milk from the fridge and pouring it into a glass.
It hit Steve right there and then that this Tony doesn’t even know his own name. He looked completely and utterly lost. What’s going on here?
“Boss, your face is all red. Are you sick? Do I need to call an ambulance?” Happy says, all ready with his phone. Tony could see the nearby hospital’s ambulance number on the screen, just waiting to be dialed if needed.
“I heard from one of the teachers that you got into a fight again.” Steve said looking down at his brother who was now glaring at him, already propped up on the bed with his elbows.
“I’m just really worried about Bucky.” He started. “I know he’d done a lot of bad things in the past but that wasn’t him. He was being controlled by Hydra all that time and now that I finally found him and have in my grasp I can’t lose him again, Tony. I just can’t. He’s all I have left of the past.”
To that retort Steve grabbed Tony’s face, digging a finger onto the injured part on the side of his lips, blood oozing again. That earned a painful moan from the older male who was trying to squirm away. Pulling at his hand.  A silent struggle to get free.
“A year, huh. Peter, well, I think he’s doing well. He’s a great kid you know. He never fusses and does everything I tell him to." He paused. 'But sometimes I wish he would act a little spoiled as well.”
Steve sighed. “If something is bothering you tell us. Let us know and we will help you however we can. I'll do my best to help you too.”
He stood there for another five minutes or so trying to calm his nerves. Gathering enough courage to finally knock on the damn door. He heard a scuttling sound from inside as if Steve was currently busy with something or someone. Tony felt weird and somewhat angry at the thought that Steve would have someone in his room right now.
Steve had just finished his football practice for the evening. The girls from the cheerleading team were clamoring over to the players who were covered in sweat. Offering them drinks and clean towels to wipe themselves.
“It seems that the rainy season will be longer this time.” The weather forecast said through the radio. Steve found himself letting out a relief triumph on hearing it.
He spent some time to upgrade the repulsor of his armor as well as tweaking his teammate’s weapons for better performance in the battlefield. He didn’t feel like doing a whole new upgrade for them right then so that should do for now. He had been working for a whole five hour and his shoulders were starting to ache. He figured it was a good time to take a break.
Tony was furious at first but then he let out a sad sigh, looking down at his feet. “I guess he doesn’t like me, huh?” He says clutching on his hand as he quietly walked away.
“Alright, fine. If you Avengers think you’ll be able to handle Barnes we’ll leave him to you for the time being. But on two conditions. One, if he ever goes out of line we’ll take him in. No questions asked. Two, he is not to take even one step out of the tower without at least one of you with him. Is that understood?”
“Steve, you okay?” Tony asks as he sat beside him, bringing his arm around for a comforting pat on the soldier’s back. The blond nodded, sitting up and looking straight at the brown of Tony’s eyes. His eyes were red and had bags under them. He looked so fucking worn out that Tony just wants to bring him into his arms. Take him home, feed him some delicious food and sent him straight to bed. The guy deserves it.
“It must be Bucky, right?” Tony says sounding a bit sad but before he could explain himself Tony cut him off saying, “I made a program to help you locate the Winter Soldier based image recognition using the collective network of CCTVs across the world . It’s almost ready so just wait a little more days alright?”
“I was pretty good.” He admitted with a smirk. “I even set a record. But during a competition of freshman year, when I was just about to pass the front runner, he put his foot on my line and I tripped. I had no way of passing him and winning the race after that. It was sad that he cheated to win the race but there wasn’t anything I could do to really prove it. So I just left the place as they were giving away the medals.”
“So, my name is Tony. Your omega and Peter’s other dad. . .” They were all seated on the common room couch.
“You seem happy.” A voice said from behind, startling him. Dropping his fork onto the floor with a clang. His whole body tensed up and he could even feel his hair standing up on end. He looks back to see a dark figure standing a few feet away from him.
Happy came back with ice cubes which he took from the champagne bucket wrapped up in a cloth and handed it to Tony who hurriedly took it and ran into the elevator.
“Tony?...Um, what are you doing here? I mean..” He started, not knowing how to really continue his sentence.
As soon as they realized that it was just an act the rest of the team laughed as well. Clint came up to Tony, strangling him playfully.
“Is that so? That’s really too bad but I’m happy for you. Your cakes deserve to be eaten by everyone.”
"Very mature, Barton." She jabbed him at his side earning a painful groan. "At least you got the mentality of a 12 year old."
He was lucky he caught him just before the Avenjet took off. Steve was dressed in his Captain America gear and currently doing some last minute check and Natasha already in the pilot seat, ready to go.
“It’s a secret.” Peter giggled and ran back to his seat just as the bell rang, signaling the end of the break.
In the next few seconds he felt his body swaying slowly to the ground with a thud, his vision blurred of the passersby. Images of some people running to help him. That was the only thing he remembered before waking up to his son’s tear stricken face.
“These days, thoughts of Tony keep rising into my head. I know that just looking at things like pictures won’t make me feel he’s. . .but Tony said he would return soon.”
The next day the family went to the forest to help Peter look for the capsule. Peter had told them that it was somewhere in the old mansion and since the place was quite big they all decided to search different corners of the place. They searched for over two hours but there seem to be no sign of the capsule. Steve and Tony decided to take a short break as they sat on the middle of the once grand stairs and watch over their son who shows no sign of being tired as he kept up his search.
Whenever his boss was with the Captain the backseat would be filled with constant chatter and laughs. It was rare for them to be with each other and be so quite unless they were having their occasional fights but they didn't seem like they were having one so what's going on?
“I look really happy there, don’t I?” He asked Steve, turning to face him but the blond alpha kept silent and looked away, not giving him an answer.
Tony was surprised when he felt Steve embrace him into a warm, heartfelt hug instead. But that didn't make it any less a heart pounding experience for him.
Bruce put down whatever he was working on and turned around to face him. “Is this about the rainy season return story?”
Steve and Natasha didn’t come back for the next three days. Tony was starting to feel restless with all the waiting. He would keep walking back and forth in the common room as his teammates watched him do this for hours on end until Clint got fed up and forced him to sit down. Even when he was in his workshop he couldn’t concentrate either.
This is good. Good for everyone. Steve will walk down a clear path. I won’t drag him down anymore. For my little brother who is so kind to his brother.
“Open your mouth, Tony.” He commands, gently grabbing his chin up. Tony opened his eyes to that, staring up at him before he obliged, opening his cut upped lips to show the inside of his mouth.
But Steve couldn’t take it anymore. The constant arguments, Tony getting into fights, being injured, him being worried for him all the time. The ever growing distance between them. And his patience finally snapped.
“Hey! Be careful man!” Tony had shouted at the guy who apologized and quickly ran away. When Steve lends him a hand he found that the brunet’s hand was bleeding. He told him to get it treated by the school nurse but Tony declined saying it was only a scratch. Steve had then offered his mother’s hand embroidered handkerchief with his name woven onto it for Tony to wrap his wound. Tony refused it again but then reluctantly took the offer. Steve had just finished wrapping it for him when he was called by his mother to take a picture together and that was the last time he saw Tony.
He thought back to yesterday’s events. How the hell did he end up forgetting everything? Even his name. It felt so surreal. To have no memories whatsoever. He examined his body for some sort of injuries but there were none.
“Yeah, that’s right. And I was the one who liked you. For all three years, we were classmates and coincidentally our seats were always next to each other. Tony, you were bright, cheerful, cute and an amazing person overall. You were a genius. Coming up with incredible inventions and earning a number of awards even at your age. Not many people could do that even most alphas. I would always watch you with pride as you walk away with the prizes.”
Peter was by himself, searching for the capsule again. He had taken a detour into the forest instead of going straight home. Looking around, turning over boxes and digging through broken shelves. And finally founds the box which was a small brown treasure chest.
“No, I’m not. Not in the least. I wish I could do so many things for him. Like normal parents can.” He said. He sat down on the empty chair, feeling worn put.
He took out the plate and proceeded to the microwave to heat it up. Then with the steaming plate of spaghetti in hand he pulled out one of the dining chairs. He proceeded to shove food into his mouth, letting out a satisfied moan.
“But you also had a part of you that was distant and hard to approach and a defensive aura. Maybe that was because you were the only omega in class filled with betas and alphas but I liked that about you too. Yeah, I liked you a lot.” He continues with a pleased sigh.
His hands wandered to his chest, his stomach and finally down to his pants, undoing the button and zipper. Loosening it down to his knees. He gently played with his nipples with one hand, the other rubbing his quickly hardening cock through the fabric of his underwear.
He’s so close whenever he touched him gently. Whether it was for comfort or when he was treating his wounds.
Tony watches Steve ran, excitement clearly shown on his face and wonders if he should just shove away his new found feelings.
“. . . um, are you alright?” Tony says reaching out to give a comforting pat on the shoulder but as soon as the taller brunet noticed the gesture he slapped it away harshly. Tony swiftly retracted his hand with an ‘Ow!’, blowing at his stinging hand. Bucky took this chance to go inside the room and closed it behind him. Not even a word of apology for his action.
Steve hates to see him like that. “God, Tony. Please don’t do that. It wasn’t your fault, Tony. How you reacted was totally normal. I’d be more worried if you weren’t.” Steve says as he brought him into a hug.
This is so awkward. At least say something! I’m being a welcoming host for you, you know. Show some gratitude. Even a small smile is fine. Just do anything other than glare at me. He thought, annoyed.
“You’ll keep this quiet if you don’t want me telling Steve about your pathetic feelings for him. He’s too good for you. Besides you won’t want me to be taken away from him again, am I right? He would be so devastated. You don’t want him to be sad, right?”
That night Steve brought out some of the videos he had taken of Tony and two of them watched it together. It was a video where he was already pregnant, being visibly heavy with Peter even just by look of his round belly.
Tony brushed passed Steve, bumping against his shoulder rather harshly as he did and closed off the workshop door as soon as he got inside. Telling Jarvis not to disturb him unless a world threatening danger occurred.
The next few days were spent like that. Waking up, eating food together, and seeing off each other to school and work, Tony helping out wherever he can.
I got up from bed at the sound of my 6 A.M alarm clock, yawning as I stretched up on the bed. It was another warm morning in Marvel, a quite little town located in the country side of New York with only around a thousand houses.
Tony’s cheeks were warm and he turned slightly on the bed at the cold touch of Steve’s hand. The alpha’s heart pounded loudly in his chest, scared that he might have woken him. But then Tony simply turned to the side, unconsciously pulling up the blankets to cover half of his face as he slept on.
It was a merry night. Being with friends who knew him well felt like coming home again after a long road trip. It was somehow calming. A few more drinks down the throat Bucky finally brought up the topic of Steve’s family.
The rest of the team was anxiously waiting for the news about Barnes. They were all present in the common room of the tower, sitting on the couch and waiting for their friends to come back. As soon as the two of them came out the elevator they bombarded them with questions about it.
It was getting late so Tony and Steve put Peter to bed and watched their son sleep. Looking safe and comfortable.
Tony absentmindedly rubbed the back of his neck and closed his eyes. He tried to remember something, anything but his effort only gave him a headache. He opened his eyes and stared at the rain dripping on the floor of their balcony wondering what exactly was happening with him.
When Steve came back they huddled on his bed, sat close to each other and shared the blanket. Tony had a pillow he was holding onto as a kind of body pillow. He just liked having something to grab on.
He watches Bucky pulled out a knife from the drawer. Waving it around and playing with it. Walking closer to the him with every step he took, a cynical smile on his face.
“It’s. . .nothing in particular.” He told her, proceeding to do his job with a spirit he hadn’t had since forever.
After another fifteen minutes ride they finally reached the tower’s parking lot. Steve came out first followed by Tony on the other side and made their way to the elevator.
“Yay, daddy fixed the heater!” Peter cheered and ran over to the heater to warm up his cold hands. “So warm and toasty~” He sighed happily.
“Perhaps if things continue. . . It’s all right if things continue like this and I don’t get my memory back.” Tony proposed.
The ride back to the tower was kind of awkward. Awkward for Tony that is. Now that he had realized how he truly felt about Steve being alone with him made him unnecessarily flustered and fidgety.
“Nothing but the best.” Steve says proudly. Tony smirks. “I guess I’ll leave you to it now. Goodnight, Tony.”
Steve nodded. “I was nervous, so goddamn nervous I almost put it off. But I pulled myself together and went to New York to meet you. You had grown up into an amazingly beautiful person. I hardly recognized you. After a quick exchange of greetings you handed me the handkerchief. Me, who was already a nervous wreck, simply took it with a hasty ‘thank you’. It was awkward. I managed to stutter my goodbye, turning away, and ready to head back.
“Tony! Come meet Bucky.” Steve called out to him, waving with a huge smile as soon as he saw him. The guy looked beat up and his exhaustion showed but that smile of his makes up for all that. Tony nodded returning the smile, walking up to them.
Wait, that was none of his business. Steve could bring a girl or two to the tower if he wanted. Tony’s got no problem with that. But, geez! Maybe he should come back another time.
He quickly took it off again, feeling like he didn’t deserve to wear it with the way things were at the moment.
Tony nodded. There was no reason for him to go out anyway. His memory was blank except for that of yesterday’s events and he’d just brought himself trouble going into town with no memories. It was better to stay at home.
That made him went even redder. “I knew it. I’m red like a tomato, aren’t I?” He asks worriedly and Happy dumbly nodded.
Peter’s lips curved up into a smile, holding his chin up on his palm. “I was hoping the rainy season would come soon.” He replied looking at Wade and giving him a cheerful grin.
“No, I’m not, Bucky. The UN and SHIELD have granted us permission for you to stay with us and recover.
“I want to feel what it felt like to like each other once more.”  He confessed, his voice soft. Steve gave him a reassuring squeeze.
“Yes, from the standpoint of science and me as a doctor, it is quite impossible.” Bruce said and the blond nodded solemnly. “Do you want to see Tony again?” He asked.
“Is that so? How is it then? Any symptoms?” The doctor asked. He was smiling like he expected a positive answer.
He suddenly got up, realizing that he hadn’t been in the garage. That was the only place he hadn’t checked out.
“Good job out there, Steve.” She said. “Here’s a towel. I just bought it a few days ago. Just for you.” She purred, grabbing at his biceps in a teasing manner.
Giving him another beautiful smile she handed him one of the chilled drinks in her hands and proceeded to lean on the wall beside him as she opened hers.
Tony scoots over to his side and slowly leans on Steve’s shoulder. It surprised him at first but Steve soon brought his arms around the brunet and pulled him closer to his side as they watched the rest of the video in a comfortable silence.
Tony went back into the house and went into his room; his and Steve’s room to be exact and saw a velvet red box near their family photo on the bed’s side table. Curious, he opened the box and inside was a beautiful silver wedding ring with his name written in neat cursive on the inside. Without really thinking he put on the ring in his finger and it fitted him perfectly. He stares at it for a while still not believing that he was already married and with a child to boot.
“Good morning everyone.” Steve said as he walked into the room with a radiant smile. They greeted back a bit confused but happy for the guy at the same time.
“What?” He managed to say after a while. “You think I’m Tony’s lover? Oh my god, you crack me up.”  He held his stomach, keeling over from laughing so much. His other hand coming up to playfully slap the blonde’s shoulder.  “Good one, little bro.”
“Steve!” Tony scolded with a frown. “Couldn’t you have at least held that in for a few more seconds?” He says exasperated at the super soldier who was laughing out loud by that point.
“Then, shall we go on a walk?” He held out his hand for Tony to take. Tony obliged and took it, getting up from the bed.
And with that the case was done and a deal was made. Even though it didn’t go exactly as he wanted it to the odds was still in their favor so he was happy about that at least.
“Working hard as usual I see.” Steve says as he set down the cup and snacks on the free space of the table Tony was using.
“But that’s what our relatives were saying before during the funeral.” Steve could feel Peter’s grip tighten around his fingers. Looking like he was about to cry again. Steve bends down to cup his son’s chubby little cheeks.
“Not cool, man. Not cool. That fucking hurts!” Clint hissed as he was helped up. The super soldier apologized again. He suggested taking him to the infirmary but the archer shook him off saying he was fine, it wasn’t needed and made his way to his room to get patched up. Bruce got up too, following him and signaling his teammates that he’ll take care of it.
“But papa, this is such good news. Why can’t I tell anyone?” Peter asked, not getting the situation.
Without giving a reply Steve and Peter took one egg each on their plate and started eating their breakfast.
The brunet had his sight away from him. One hand supporting his chin. His clothes were covered in dirt and specks of blood, torn at the sides. His whole body was covered in bruises and cuts. His face was especially fucked up.
Just as dad was setting the table the doorbell rang. I told him I’d get it and ran to the door. When I opened it I saw that it was Mrs. Madeline, the owner of a cake shop in town. She smiled at me and said, “Happy 16th birthday, Peter”, and handed me the cake box.
Steve looked like he didn’t particularly want to tell him. He felt that it was too soon but he couldn’t say no to Tony when he looked at him like that. With those big puppy brown eyes and trembling soft lips, so he nodded slightly. Giving in to his request.
And to think he told him this just before they got to watch the movie planned for that night. Way to ruin the mood.
“You both look totally disheveled like you had a rough sexy night. Also I saw you enter Cap’s room and I guessed you never left~”
Looking closely he could notice that the brunet's ears were bright red but he decided not to comment on it at the moment.
Tony was surprised at first. His body gearing up for escape. But the guy seemed like he was just worried about him and simply wanted to be close. He doesn’t seem like an alpha that would mindlessly attack an omega. So he let his guard down again.
On his part Tony had opened his doors for Bucky. Letting him stay in the tower with the rest of them and find ways to help him recover. And now here he was, trying to fight on his behalf against SHIELD and practically the country for Bucky who seemed like he didn't even like him from yesterday’s action.
Tony didn’t remember them at all or anything about himself. They took him back home with them with Tony giving them a cautious look, being alert of their every action.
“Don’t come to this room anymore.” He managed to choke out, voice hoarse. “Don’t come near me anymore. . . Please, I beg of you.”
Steve remembered how upset his mom had been. To be the reason her son had to give up college. It had taken a long while for his mom to accept his decision.
Tony then saw a first aid kid held in one hand. Couldn’t he just be left alone? He doesn’t need to be treated. He can do it by himself. Later. When he feels like it.
“Bucky! Open the door. It’s me, Steve.” He says standing outside. He heard a scuffle of footsteps and with the press of a button the door opened revealing a tired looking Bucky Barnes dressed in black jeans and a grey t-shirt.
“But you know, a funny thing happened. Just as the medals were being awarded the stadium lights went down. It became completely dark and there was total confusion in the stadium so I guess that part made me laugh at the end.” Steve chuckled.
‘You’re one to talk. You take advantage of his kindness for your own immoral feelings.’ Ty’s words were ringing in his ears.
Tony breathe a sigh of relief, slumping back on the chair as soon as all the rest of the personnel went out. With this Bucky was safe under their wing.
His whole body trembled in ecstasy when he finally released his semen all over his hand. He brought it up to his eyes, breathing roughly as he stared at the liquid dripping down his fingers. His vision started to became blurry with tears that were now brimming in his beautiful brown eyes.
They gave the both of them an amused look. “I see the two of you have made up. That’s good.” Natasha says with a small smirk.
He got out of bed, taking the utmost care not to make any sudden movements or noise. He crept up in front of the blond alpha, staring at his form.
Peter was looking out of the classroom window and up towards the vast blue sky. He did that for a long while since the start of his break time, catching the attention of his classmate, Wade Wilson, the boy who sat next to him. Wade approached the smaller boy and stood beside him, doing the same.
“Steve, write something for me.” He told him that time. Grinning at him as if they had been close friends for a long time.
After breakfast and some cake, I head for school. I took out my bike from the garage and paddled out. But as I looked back to the forest stretched out behind our home there was a sudden impulse and I felt myself cycling towards it instead. “A quick detour won’t hurt.” I told myself. I rode through the silent forest. The very path I would often take a walk with my parents. Gazing over at the old abandoned house, the one where we would often sit down and took a rest.
Wade raised an eyebrow at him. “Don’t people usually hate the rainy season? Ya know, cause you get all soggy and drenched, and you have to sit in class with a wet underwear if you don’t have a change of clothes. And I really hate the smell of stinky wet socks in class. Totally ruins the mood.” He complained.
“It may be burnt but everything you make, you make it with love so it always tastes good to us, right Peter?”
“It’s nothing. You don’t have to make a big deal out of it.” He quickly replied, looking away to hide it.
I wanted to sleep a bit more; I had been working on a project all night. But today is a special day. So, I got up. Went to the bathroom to freshen up and head down for breakfast. When I got there dad was already in the kitchen preparing what I could perceive was scrambled eggs and toast for breakfast. He looked fresh out from the shower. He must have already showered after coming back from his usual morning walk.
“What are you trying to do?" He stutters on his words, a bad feeling crept up from the pit of his stomach.
“My brother’s incompetence. I was always the first one to notice it.” He said as he leaned forward. His fingers intertwined in front of him as he brought them up to his lips. Eyes cast down as his lips curved up into a small, genuine smile.
“No, that’s not true at all. Daddy didn’t die because of you and, I’m not going anywhere. I’ll always be with you. All right?” He guaranteed, giving a shaky smile.
Steve and Peter went to the forest to look for usable junks from the old abandoned mansion in the forest. It was something Tony did a lot as well before. Looking for junks he could recycle to build something amazing. Peter had also followed the trend. Whenever he had a school project he needed to do he went scouring for stuffs there.
“No, of course you can. I’m really happy you did. Thank you, Tony.” He let out a satisfied sigh. “I’ll be back soon. Have fun at your meeting.” He tells him with a smile.
“Oh, sorry. Did I bother you? I didn’t mean to." Steve says rubbing the back of his neck in a sheepish manner, smiling.
The little happy memories he had of his mother came rushing to him. The time when she would take time off from her busy schedules of going to places with Howard or organizing charity parties, simply to spent time with her son and teach him how to play the piano (Her amazing talent which she hadn’t pursued after getting married with his father). She would be so happy. The only time Tony would get to see her tender loving smile and know that even if she doesn’t always show it she had loved him dearly.
Two days later Tony finished the program and told Steve about it. Using it they soon located the soldier and that night Steve and Natasha made plans.
“Frustration? What are you talking about?” He asked. Worried clearly shown in his gaze, his posture, his whole body.
He slowly caressed his son’s head, still feeling a little short of breath. Not noticing his brunette fellow worker, Peggy, who had helped his son find his father when she heard him cry. She quietly faded away into the background, careful not to disturb them.
The radio then started to tell them about the weather forecast. That the rainy season has finally come. It would start in a day or two. Steve felt himself smiling wide on hearing that which caught Peggy’s attention.
“You’re a sick bastard, Ty.” Tony commented, glaring at him as he unconsciously rubbed his hand which was starting to bleed again.
“The sides of your mouth are cut and bleeding a bit but the rest is all right.” He pulled out supplies from the first aid kit and began treating his injuries. “It’s gonna sting a little but please bear with it.” He said as he applied the antiseptics.
With great difficulty he reached up for the first aid kit at the top of the kitchen shelf and patched himself up as best he could with his good hand. Then with a rag proceeded to wipe his own blood from the floor along with the tears he couldn’t help but shed.
Steve, who was sitting on Peter’s bed took a peek at their interaction from the corner of his book and found himself grinning. It had been a while since he saw Peter in such high spirits. He wishes things could stay like this forever.
He wiped the blood dripping down the side of his mouth, panting. Staring down at the guy groaning in pain at his feet.
“Everything’s gonna be fine, Cap. Leave it to me. I’ll get it done. And after this meeting you won’t ever have to worry about Bucky being taken away. He’ll be right where he should be, with you.” Tony felt hurt saying that part but he quickly shook his head. “I promise. So, stop being all gloomy and shit, it doesn’t suit you.”
Tony noticed that Steve had forgotten to put on his helmet again so he shouts out to him. “Your helmet! Put it on!”
He had totally forgotten about the meeting and where they were, getting swept up in his new found feelings. He hastily shoved the super soldier off him with a 'oof', stood up and adjusted himself.
He also found a bunch of broken household stuffs like toaster, fan, heater, etc. Feeling like there wasn’t much else to do he started tinkering with them. And after some inspection he understood the working and carried on to fix it with the tool box he found in the garage. He didn’t know where the knowledge came from but once he started working, it was like he knew exactly what to do and how to do it. It was amazing really. Where was all this information coming from?
Maybe he was taking this too seriously. Steve was brave enough to tell him about it even though he was sure Tony would be hurt by it. He hadn’t hidden it from him. That would have been a hundred times worse.
“Uh huh. I don’t care what really happened and I don’t want to know either. Let’s just get the meeting started.” With that he walked towards the conference door, punched in a number and entered the room followed by the officials and Tony and Steve in the last.
“But I treated you coldly over the past few days and stubbornly ignored you even when you wanted to talk to me. I feel so terrible.” He says choking up at the end, burrowing his head in the crook of Steve’s neck. Loosely returning the embrace.
“After that I trained like crazy and sprinting was all I could think about. There wasn’t a reason for you to like someone like that.”
Happy thought for a while and ran back to the car. Just then Steve looked back, noticing that a certain brunet wasn’t behind him. “Tony? What are you doing standing there for?” He furrowed his brows at him.
If you had told Tony Stark that he would become best friends with Steve Rogers he would fully deny anything like that could ever happen, like in a million years. He’d laugh it off and might even add that you’re insane to say something as unbelievable as that. Or even to get your head checked for getting that crazy idea in the first place. But fate and chance sure changed that for him.
That night Steve went down to Tony’s lab to bring him a cup of freshly brewed coffee and some snacks like he always did. It felt good to go back to their usual routine. He saw him working on advanced things he barely understands like always. Steve smiled to himself as he approached him.
But with a quick step to the side Tony avoided it easily and gave the guy a taste of his own fist instead. A hard one on the nose.  Tony felt the bones cracked under him.
He imagined Steve’s voice. The way he would usually scold him with a gentle tone that always seem to rile him up. That deep, husky voice speaking lewd things into his ears.
Tony then showed Bucky to his room which was located the nearest to Steve’s. He thought it would help since it doesn’t look like anyone else would be able to handle him well. Steve was the only one he recognized and the rest of them were complete stranger to the guy.
great at housework. He was a good dad that took good care of his kid. Tony wondered how exactly he was able to land such a jackpot of an alpha. He considered his pre- amnesia self really lucky.
Steve's mouth was warm, the caress of his lips softer than Tony could imagine and he opened his mouth with a low moan.
“That’s nice of you to say, Peter and I’m glad I was able to keep my promise to the end. I’ll be going then.” Saying that she got onto her small delivery truck and went back to town.
They wore their jackets and went to the forest. It was a beautiful full moon night so there was no need for a flashlight. They walked with ease into the forest, side by side. The rays of the moon lighting their path.
“If that’s what makes you happy. I’ll do it.” He spoke with his back to his brother. His voice low, barely audible to the ears. Fingers clenched so tight that the veins were clearly visible on the back of his hand.
“Oh my gosh, really? You two don’t look alike at all!” She gasped in surprise. “You’re brother seems really scary. I often see him getting into fight around the campus.”
Tony was on one of his all-nighter inventing spree his stomach started to growl. He asked Jarvis what time it was and was told that it was already 2:30 in the morning. He bent over and opened his secret snack container but found it empty. He then decided to just get something to eat from the fridge. Maybe there was some leftover of Steve’s or Bruce’s cooking. Well, that is if Hawkeye didn’t get his hands on it first.
Tony smiled fondly at it. It was small gestures like this that made him fall even more for the blond super soldier. Steve would make such a great boyfriend.
“It’s getting cold, isn’t it? My hands are freezing.” He said, his cheeks tinted pink with embarrassment.
“Yes, I did. The truth is I’m thinking of moving to the city to continue my business so I’m closing down my shop as of today.”
Tony Stark, the omega son of the wealthy businessman, alpha Howard Stark, was Steve Rogers’ beloved mate. They got married at the age of 24 and had a beautiful baby boy named Peter. They had a great life going for them but like most things in this world, it didn’t last long. Due to a sudden, incurable illness that had befallen Tony, he died at the age of 29. Leaving his alpha and barely five year old Peter behind.
Steve sat up to look at Tony’s face and found it to be filled with tears. Staining the beautifully bruised face of his brother. There was so much pain in those eyes. Seeing that made his chest painfully clench inside him.
It was a figure sitting near the huge backdoor of the mansion, soaked by the rain and shivering. He was only in a simple white t-shirt and jeans. The brunet blew warmth into his hands as an attempt to keep warm and buried his face in between his arms in a bundle not noticing the two figures a few feet away from him.
He looked over to Steve who had come with him for the case. Tony noted that he looked just as anxious if not more. He looked dead tired too. He had just found his supposedly long dead best friend just a day ago and now he could be taken away again. He also knew how tired Steve was. He hadn’t gotten a wink of a goodnight sleep because as soon as SHIELD had heard of the Winter Soldier’s capture they had wanted to bring him in and answer for his crimes.
Just as he was handing over the sharpie someone knocked Tony over and he fell down with a thud. Steve sent a deathly glare at the offender who looked taken aback.
“Okay. . . .I really want to see daddy.” Not knowing what else to do, the alpha hugged his child in an effort to at least give him some comfort this way.
“Tony~ Aren’t you going to treat that wound of yours?” Tiberius casually remarked as he watched the blood flowing along Tony’s hand. “You’re hurt, buddy.”
Steve met up with his friends for a drink at their local bar. They were having a sort of reunion as old members of the same regiment in the US army. They had all came to meet him from the city. There was Bucky, Sam, Natasha and Clint. Smiling and drinking merrily as they sat around the table at one corner of the bar. Everyone seemed happy to see each other.
“I didn’t like you?” Tony asked as they took a seat at the entrance steps of the abandoned mansion they were before.
Happy, Tony’s friend and driver, watched the exchange through the rear view mirror of the car. He could feel the awkward atmosphere seeping from behind.
Tony helped Peter took a bath one afternoon and finally asked Peter what the key around his neck was for to which he was told that it was for a time capsule which he and Peter hid a year ago. That his papa didn’t know about this secret capsule. Tony then told him that he wished he could see it.
He returned the embrace with all the love and comfort he could channel through the hug. Steve’s arms tightened around him and they stayed like that, just holding onto each other.
He thought back to the time Steve told him the big news of his parent’s murder as he occasionally took a sip of his coffee.
“Here’s your room. I hope you like it. I just left it with the basic necessities since you seem like a simple type of guy. You can later decorate it to suit your taste.” Tony says with a grin, feeling quite happy with his choice.
“Tony, do you think it’s gonna be a girl or a boy?” The Steve in the video asked Tony who looked up at the camera with a smile, gently caressing his middle.
After they locked up the house they head off to town. Once they reached the place they were spotted by Wade who gave them a cheeky grin and ran up to them.
“Your father was the same. Hitting on Steve every chance he got. Back then I was just a soldier. I couldn't  do anything to someone as rich and powerful as him so it felt great when I finally got to kill him in 1991. But I have to say, killing your mother was quite boring. She was so easy to kill. I just gave a squeeze on her neck and she died."
“Hey, Tony?” Steve says looking at the brunet who was sitting at the end of the seat, as far apart as he could manage in the car.
Tony looked down at the little boy who was still hugging him, looking up at him as his eyes shone of admiration. Tony found that quite adorable. This child must have really loved him, clinging onto him so tightly.
Steve rode his bike which he got as a parting gift from the US army when he sent in his resignation years ago. It had served him well through the years and especially now as his main means of transport to work. After serving in the army for three years and getting severely injured during a battle, he came back, moved to Marvel town and started working at a small furniture firm of their little town.
“Oh, you poor creature. Desiring something which you can’t ever hope to attain.” Saying that Bucky picked up the fallen knife, forced open Tony’s palm and slowly dragged the sharp knife across it.
That woke up the soldier in an instant. Steve couldn’t help but laugh at his best friend who was sprawled on the floor, looking as shocked as can be.
Tony then felt the shift of his bed as Steve got up. Dragging his shoes along the floor as he approached the door.
As he was prepared to leave, Steve gave a once over look to the grumpy brunet huddled on the bed. “Does anywhere else hurt? Anything?”
Tony rubbed his sleepy eyes and dragged himself up to the communal kitchen. It was quiet and the only source of light was from the small bulbs which were dimly lit all around the tower. It seemed like everyone was in bed except for him who was wondering in the night like some nocturnal animal seeking for food.
Our house is a located on the outskirt of town which is the only house close to the forest. It is pretty far away from the actual town but we like it here. The quietness and surrounding of the place give offs a calm and cool atmosphere. I know that my parents were actually from the cities but I’ve been living in this place for as long as I can remember. I prefer it from the bustling city life.
They stumbled into the kitchen together and greeted their friends already there a ‘good morning’ in unison. Tony pulled put a chair to sit on while Steve made them coffee.
When he saw Tony he had found himself blushing, his heart pounding loudly in his chest. Tony had grown up to into a beautiful omega. With his dark brown locks trimmed neatly, wearing an elegant grey Armani suit that hug his figure snuggly and a sunglass in one hand. He had even grown a beard which was a good look on him. Tony may have done it to look mature but Steve finds it to be quite adorable. Everything about him was perfect in his eyes. Everyone walking by was also mesmerized by his beauty, betas and alphas alike. And when Tony caught his gaze he felt like his heart stopped.
"That's because Steve actually take cares of what he eats unlike you who eats take out 24/7." Natasha chided. " It's amazing you haven't bloated up." Clint stuck out his tongue at her.
So when Steve had confessed to him about Bucky being alive, brainwashed to work under Hydra as the Winter Soldier and how his best friend had killed his parents Tony didn’t know what to do. If they were their previous antagonistic-selves he would simply beat the crap out of the guy and kick him out of his tower. Maybe even quit the Avengers altogether. He would just have more reasons to hate the guy. It would have been so much easier to hate him. But Steve was his best friend now. Which made it so much harder.
Tony called Steve and Bucky to his lab and told them about how they would start the recovery process with his latest invention which would help the second super soldier to regain memories from his past and also to slowly remove Hydra’s mind control over him. A device which he made with Helen Cho's help.
“Our old man and mother love us the same. And raised us to think of each other as brothers. But I’m just trash. I fully realize my unorthodoxy.” He thought to himself.
“Because no one else knows about the promise and they will think that Tony is a ghost. They might get scared of him or hurt him. We can’t let that happen.”
Tony gently brushed away the bangs of Peter’s hair away from his eyes with a smile. He then noticed a small key that hung around his neck tied to a thick black string. He reached out and took the key in his hand, feeling it for a while but then put it down, pulling the blankets higher to cover the child’s neck.
When he entered the room it was filled with Tony’s scent. Not the scent an omega gives out during heat but his usual fluffy and sweet one. It was a nostalgic smell.
“I wanted to apologize.” He started getting the blond’s attention; he then turned to look him straight in the eyes. “Steve, I’ve been an insufferable idiot the past week and I’m so sorry for the way I behaved with you. I was just so mad! And even though it wasn’t your fault I put all the blame on you when it was actually my fault. Please,... forgive me.” He says with glassy red, tired eyes.
I placed the cake onto the table as dad also wished me a happy birthday. He then told me that he’ll give me my present when I get back.
Soon realizing his action Steve’s eyes widened in shock, his cheeks going red. “Oh god! Clint, I’m so sorry.” He grimaced as he ran to him.
He walked over to his sleeping form, kneeling down by his side to take a closer look. He couldn’t help himself from wanting to touch the man before him and soon found his hand reaching over to caress the brunet’s cheek. He couldn’t stop himself, he really wants to feel him if only to assure himself that this Tony was real and not just some illusion he and Peter were seeing.
“But you know, I couldn’t just forget you like that. I wanted to see you one more time. So, I dialed your number I got from a friend and asked you if you could return the handkerchief I lent you at graduation. Saying that it was an important memento from my mother. But that wasn’t true. It was important but I had a few more of those. I didn’t really need to get it back but I didn’t know what other excuse I could use to meet you. And above all else, I was so glad you still even remembered me.”
Peter sent him a smile as a way of showing him they were harmless and held out his hand for Tony which the brunet took after a quite contemplation.
Tony tries to call for his armor but got his face slammed roughly onto the table. “I know that movement. You were trying to call your armor, weren’t you? You shouldn’t do that. Not if you want you pretty little face all messed up.” Bucky says snickering creepily.
Steve and Tony took Peter for a walk in the forest in the afternoon. The little boy held onto each of his parent’s hand, laughing happily as they went along.  Getting back into a kind of family rputine they had before.
Steve took that chance to explore his omega's mouth, deepening the kiss. Tony enthusiastically returned the action, leaning further into his alpha.
“This is problematic. You’re not the type of person to lie and I was the doctor who pronounced him dead.”
He turned up the radio and listened to whatever song was being broadcast like usual as he got to work. Pulling up the blueprint, selecting the wood, taking the measurements, cutting out the design and so on. After working on the project for a good three hours Steve decided to take a break. He pulled up a chair outside the workshop and sat down, watching his home which was barely recognizable from that distance and the thick green forest beyond it. It was a calming sight.
At that moment Steve found his best friend to be quite….adorable. He shakes his head. That’s not something you think of your best friend, let alone a man. He was brought back to reality when Tony pokes him on his side.
The guy yelled, running at him head on. He brought his fist into a tight grip as he aimed it right at the brunet’s face.
Starting from getting each other’s back, from serious quarrels to playful banters, spending their off time together doing whatever came to mind (Tony’s mostly, which included getting Steve to watch all the fan favorite movies ever made. They would have their separate movie nights for that) to sharing their own inside jokes the two of them were now undeniably the best of friends.
“I’m sorry, Peter. I’m so sorry.” He felt pathetic. He couldn’t even do a simple task like this for his son. It made him want to cry.
Steve suddenly grabbed on his shoulders, opening his mouth in an attempt to say something, looking all serious. But all that came out was, “There are a lot of movies we’re behind on since last week. Mind if we get back to them?”
When he approached the hanger he saw Steve and the rest of the avengers who were already present and a new face which was James Bucky Barnes. He felt his chest tighten at the name. This person did kill his parents. But as Steve had said, he was controlled by Hydra so he shouldn’t just hate the guy. That’s just not fair.
Unfortunately, even after a week had passed Tony showed no sign of regaining his memories. Since he was asked not to go out by himself he was stuck in the house, feeling bored as heck while Peter was in school and Steve busy at work. There was nothing interesting to do. He flopped down on the couch and groaned in annoyance. It was raining again so he couldn’t even venture into the forest for a little sightseeing.
“I’m good, a bit sleepy but I’ll make it.” I told him, smiling. It must have been a shitty attempt to hide my tiredness as he just stood there and stared at me, looking at me with those worried blue eyes of his that I tried to give him a bunch of other reasons to no worry so much. But then he stopped and gave a soft sigh.
“He won’t listen to what the likes of me has to say. And also, because that’s just how he takes out his frustration. Just let him be.”
“More like they had a make-up sex to me.”, Clint commented with a cheeky smile. Tony choked on his saliva.
He entered the dark room, feeling around the wall for the switch. As soon as the light came on he found it to be filled with junks. There were some old baby cradle, a baby walker, toys, and outfits. There was also a beautiful silver Audi R8 in the middle of the garage which really stood out from the rest.
“So, what’s this ridiculous idea of you Avengers holding the Winter Soldier instead of giving him over to us? You know the bastard had been a pain in the ass for centuries. He needs to be taken in.” Fury says looking dead serious. All the other people in the room nodded their head in agreement except for Tony and Steve.
“Stop it! Stop ignoring me like this.” He growled, aggressively pulling at Tony’s shirt to make him look. Jerking him to his side.
“It’s part of the job. I can handle it.” The billionaire simply replies. Seeing his determination the agent finally gave in.
Tony didn’t give an answer. He staggered to pick up his bag pack from the ground and brushed off the dirt.
“Dr. Banner said I’m doing better now. Don’t worry about me, Peter.” Steve assured him. Peter looked unsure but then he couldn’t help hiding his excitement and quickly agreed.
“That’s not coffee a human being drinks. That’s motor oil; I can’t drink motor oil, DUM-E.” He says tiredly. He hadn't been able to have a goodnight sleep ever since that night nor was his appetite any good. His face was visibly tired and his eyes red with dark circles. He got up as he put the cup on his desk and went to the counter to make one himself.
Tony found himself tracing the skin that Steve had touched. His shoulders…his arms…his neck…his lips.
“Tony, please. Don’t avoid me like this.” Steve had told him one evening after they had just got back from some Avengers business they had to take care of. The super soldier had stopped him as he was making a beeline for his workshop.
On the fourth day Steve finally came back and he wasn’t alone. He and Natasha had brought back the Winter Soldier with them.
God, everything hurts. Why couldn’t the person who killed his parents be just some random Hydra soldier? Why did it have to be Barnes, Steve’s best friend since childhood? It was so complicated he can’t even laugh about it.
Steve watches Tony buried his face onto the pile of ice, standing still beside him. The brunet was like that for a whole two minutes now. Was he alright?
Bruce Banner, the beta doctor, is one of the most eminent doctors that were transferred to this little town. Ever since Steve moved here he had been his regular patient, helping the blond with his rehabilitation and other issues. He had been a good friend to both the alpha and his mate before the latter passed away.
He was secretly glad that Steve had decided not to go after him. He seriously couldn’t handle the super soldier right now. Right now he fucking needed to be alone. He had to get his emotions together because at the moment, they were all over the place.
Tony licked his lips, it tasted of blood. It probably got cut when his face was slammed on the table so roughly like that.
He had looked so pained in the last part. Barely choking out the words. It made Tony’s resolve even stronger. He may not like Bucky but Steve, he did. Quite a lot to be exact.
“That’s not fair, Cap. You always take his side. Just because you got the h-!” Clint was cut off abruptly by a pan flying straight to his face, knocking him down from his seat with a loud thud. He groaned in pain caressing his face with his hands, rolling on the floor.
We have sooooo many assignments this week I seriously had no time to properly write fanfic updates. Sorry in advance if this wasn't written well enough. I promise it would be better next time.
Steve agreed that it was a good idea to give it a try so everyday they would strap the metal armed soldier onto the machine and he and Bruce would check his progress.
He learned that Steve was an ex soldier who had an early retirement, working at a furniture firm. A person who was handsome, kind and understanding
“I’m really starting to like you and Peter. So, if I can be with the two of you like this then that’s enough. To live as your omega, being part of the family.” Tony said leaning on the alpha’s shoulder with a charming grin.
He had missed this. Spending time with Steve like this was what he always looked forward to, the highlight of his day. He loved the warmth that Steve gave off when he sat close to him. The way their shoulders would occasionally bumped against each other, the way Steve would sneak a glance at him, smiling ever so slightly. It felt great.
With that they went out the room. Tony couldn’t stop feeling flustered on the fact that he had spent last night sleeping on the same bed as Steve. But Steve doesn’t look like that bothered him at all. Yeah, he was over reacting. It’s normal for best friends to sleep on the same bed. Totally normal.
A chuckle escape from Steve’s as he gave one last look at the brunet before he went into his kitchen to prepare said snacks.
“What’s wrong with that?” Tony thought. “To me, who has no right to ask anything of him. . .this is the only comfort I can get.”
He his eyes caught a pair of beautiful robins hopping along the balcony of the house. They must have come here to use it for shelter from the strong down pour.
“Archer, are you alright?” Thor asked looking down from his cereal bowl as Natasha simply says ‘that’s gonna leave a mark’ as she continued polishing her guns. Bruce smiled nervously.
There was going to be a parade in the town. During these times it was always Tony who took Peter out for this kind of occasions. And Steve, knowing perfectly well that his son wanted to go suggested after lunch that they should go too.
Tony came out of the room, dressed in his navy rock band t-shirt, a grey jumper and black cotton jeans. He went around the house, checking it out. He found it to be a cozy house, neither too big nor too small. Things were kept clean and simple.
“Well, we did have different mothers so it can’t be help if we don’t looked alike.” He commented. “My mother remarried Tony’s father.”
“You work hard by doing vigorous training and I work hard doing these stuffs.....I was starting to think I won’t get to see you tonight.”
Steve ushered him towards his bed, motioning him to take a seat. He was soon joined by the super soldier who looked like he was at a loss for words. “So, what can I do for you?”, he finally asked after some time. Scratching the back of his neck in a nervous manner.
“Tony.” Steve said, staring right at him. His voice deep and commanding. But gentle at the same time.
“Good boy.” He said, his voice shaking. “And it seems like daddy doesn’t remember who he is. Anything about you or me or that he had already died once.”
Wanda was about to scold them but was cut off by Wade, “If Pete said something amazing happened then it happened. He won’t lie like you piece of shits.”
This was it. The only time he’ll ever get to see Tony again. He should at least tell him about his feelings even if they get shot down on the spot. In the end he chickened out and instead nodded, proceeding to sign the shirt.
“Alright then. Promise to get at least some sleep during breaks, okay?” He told me to which I nodded in reply.
Steve could recall the day of their graduation when Tony came over to let him sign his t-shirt. He had been going around to his classmates to get them to sign something in his shirt as a sort of remembrance.
“What? I’m not totally avoiding you, am I? I listened and followed all your orders during mission and worked well with the rest of the team so I’d like it if you leave me alone, Cap.” Tony scoffed. “I got work to do.”
Steve cracked an uncomfortable smile. Grabbing her hand and gently pulling it off of him as he thanked her for the towel.
“What do you want, Steve?” Tony mumbled. He was spread out in his bed with a physics notebook covering his face.
“It’s alright. But if what you are saying is true then when the rainy season ends Tony will disappear. Right?”
Could the blond alpha and his son be speaking the truth? Did he really suddenly lose his memories during their walk? They didn’t look like bad people or the type to lie. Instead they were quite friendly and thoughtful in their ways.
Luck came to him in the form of a set aside plate of spaghetti located at the bottom corner of the fridge, neatly wrapped up with his name written on it. It was Steve’s handwriting. It was written like this,
"If there's no more problem to point out I guess we can call it done?" He eyes the director. " Are we done,Fury?"
“What? I’m not. . . I just felt like looking out at the view. The wind feels great. It’s so refreshing. You should probably scoot over on your side, way over there and feel it too. You’ll love it.” Tony replies, laughing oddly. Pointedly looking out the window with one hand on his chin.
“Thank you for that, Wade. But choose your words a little kinder next time.” Wanda told him and the class commence.
For a second, Steve’s eyes landed on Tony’s soft looking slightly chapped lips. He then let out a chuckle on seeing Tony’s trembling self and shook his head with a fond smile.
“You were probably finished college by that time. Graduating at the top of your class again. I just knew it. And after a month of my retirement my mom passed away. I ended up leaving New York and moved here, to Marvel town and bought my current place, found a decent job, settled down permanently. And me as I was, who couldn’t properly control my own body and having panic attacks; I didn’t want to worry you with my problems. You were better off without me in your life.
After he returned with a hot, edible cup of coffee he sat on the couch and looked out at the night view. He felt as if everyone was feeling quite happy down there. Families spending time together, the kids smiling and laughing as they hold on to their parent’s hands. Group of friends who were out drinking, some playfully chasing each other on the streets.
Their whole interaction was being observed by a very bored looking brunet, standing on top of the school’s terrace. His back was against the railing, the wind blowing gently in his direction. From Tony’s perspective the guy looked pretty happy to be with a gorgeous cheerleader who worshipped him.
Steve had smelled like soap. Had he just got out from the bath? The smell was lingering in his room.
“Just a slip of the hand.” Steve says avoiding his gaze. Yeah, right. He didn’t believe him one bit. “I, ah, SHIELD wanted me for a covert operation so see you later, Tony.” With that the blond hurried out the room. Tony tilted his head utterly confused.
Steve was at work, whistling along to a song as he assembled the furniture parts together. Peggy watched him from the sideline, wondering, who was the one that made the alpha so happy these past few days?
Watching a whole week worth of movies in one night was NOT a good idea. When Tony got up his whole body ached like he’d done a strict training session the other night. He had forgotten that he never got back to his room that night and fell down from the bed screaming when he felt someone shifting under the blankets.
“Of course you weren’t, Nick. I was just giving our mopey Captain a shoulder to lean on. He’s like this cause you guys are hell bend on capturing his friend.”
“Mr. Banner, why is dad not able to go places with many people? Is it a disease?” Peter asked as he sat down on one of the benches outside the clinic, waiting for his dad as he watched Bruce tend to the plants he had grown around it.
That evening, Steve came come with a bunch of groceries and cooked up a feast which was greatly enjoyed by everyone. Tony even told him that if he was this good at cooking he won’t make another attempt to cook ever again.
“Things aren't as simple as that, Stark. Did you  not tell us that he was brainwashed by Hydra? You don’t know what he would be capable of until it can be confirmed that he had fully escaped their mind control.”
Tony’s brain short circuited. What the hell was he up to? Was Steve trying to kiss him or what?! He’s getting so close!
“If you are his lover, can you please tell him not to behave so recklessly?” Steve told him. A stern look adorning his face. “My brother may act tough, and I don’t mean this in an offensive way but he’s actually pretty weak. So I'm worried about him."
If anyone saw how the two of them had treated each other on their first meeting they also wouldn’t believe it either. They were polar opposites. Like fire and ice. Always repelling each other, never able to agree on anything without starting an argument first. But it happened anyway. As time went by and they really got to know each other, not just what they show on the outside but how they really were on the inside as well. They both found that they weren’t so different from each other.
Bucky’s face contorted into something malicious of sort but it quickly faded before the blond could notice it. “Not at all. I’m just glad you found friends other than me.”
After Tony sent off Steve and Natasha to freshen up from their tiresome mission he offered to show Bucky his new place in the tower. Giving him a quick tour while he was at it to get him familiar with the surroundings.
Suddenly, Peter dropped the tin box he was holding onto to gather his things, too astonished at the sight before him, making a loud racket. Steve turned around trying to ask what happened but soon became speechless at the sight.
Steve came around to stand in his line of sight. “Tony, I thought I told you to stop acting like this. Getting into fights, hurting yourself.”
Tony laughed; it felt good to do that. His heart finally felt like a weight has been lifted. Steve wiped away his tears with the soft stroke of his thumb, smiling at the brunet ever so sweetly. Tony couldn’t help but blush on receiving such an intimate gesture from Steve.
The girl looked at him in awe at the way the blond was talking about his brother. Such affection in his tone.
He remembered strong hands that touched him so gently and his whole body shivered, tingling all over.
Steve smiled. “What? It was an important question to me. I didn’t want to watch them by myself. I enjoy it best when I’m watching it with you.” Hearing that made Tony happier than it should.
That earned him a chuckle from the super soldier which the brunet returned. And with one last look Steve went inside the Avenjet and took off. Tony watched for a while until there was only a speck of black dot in the sky and went for his meeting. The rest of his day went unbelievably boring. He wished Steve was back already.
Tony couldn’t believe it. He used to be pregnant with a baby boy inside him. He felt himself touching his stomach as he watched the rest of the video.
As Peter looked around for materials, Steve looked up at the rain and closed his eyes, wishing for something that was unlikely to happen. But he still wished for it anyway.
“Peter said he was hungry and well, you see, I tried to fry some eggs for breakfast but they got burned so I just grabbed some sausages from the fridge. I guess I’m not really good at cooking, am I?” Tony said a blush adorning his face, hiding his gaze from Steve. His fingers were nervously pulling at the sleeves of his jumper.
One side of the common room wall was filled with family photos. There were also shelves packed full of books of various kind. For a family where every member was men the place sure was neat. He searched around for the man and his son who had introduced themselves as Steve and Peter.
Steve almost lost his balance, swaying to the side but was able to adjust himself in time and stopped the bike to put on his helmet as he turned around with an embarrassed smile. That brought a laugh from the omega who desperately tried to hide it behind his hands. He felt his whole body shaking from trying to keep himself from laughing out loud.
They were making their way back to the house. The distance between them seemed to have lessened after their short 'date'.
“It’s okay. Starting today, let’s help daddy remember everything. Everything about you and me, okay?”
Steve came barging into his room. This time he didn’t even asked him for permission. He stared at Tony’s beaten form sitting on the bed.
“Good morning, Mr. Smith.” Steve said as he entered the building with a smile. He hung his jacket on the wall and got into his work clothes which was a dark blue jumpsuit.
Steve stared at him and let out a sigh. “I want to; though I don’t think it can actually happen. But Peter believes it. So, that’s what matters.”
Tony was frozen in his seat. He didn’t know Bucky had such a side to him. They had done everything, every test. That he was probably almost 95% sure that the mind control Hydra had on him was removed. He had even remembered about his past and being all friendly with the others. He was slowly but surely becoming the ‘Bucky’ Steve knew since childhood. The fun loving, girlfriend seeking guy who always stood by his best friend, Steve Rogers in a fight.
Steve grabbed the kit from the bed.  Then he leaned over to gently pat Tony’s soft dark brown hair, smiling and walked out the door, closing it behind him.
This alpha had a great body. Muscled and toned just right, not too muscular but not thin either. The perfect set of body parts assembled together to form the perfect specimen. His eyelashes were quite long and thick, lips that look chapped but soft to the touch. His blond hair looked so fluffy that Tony wanted to touch it badly. As far as looks were concerned, this guy was totally his type.
He then propped himself up on his elbow, trying to get out of bed. He stopped in his tracts when he saw the blond alpha sleeping at the end of his bed. Sitting on the floor with his back against the bed. He was breathing slowly, his head titling to the side.
Tony’s eyes widened a bit at that. Then a smile starts to form on his lips. “I missed you too, idiot. You really forgive me?”
He sat down on one of the nearby benches and she followed him, settling down by his side. Showing a smile which was all teeth. He wished she would just leave him alone.
“Why are you staring at the sky like you expect an airplane to come crashing down?” He asked after a while.
Steve could still picture it clearly in his eyes. The way Tony would look so engrossed in his notes as he jots down a bunch of difficult looking mathematical equations. Not caring about the lessons going on. Like he was in his own carefree world. He had often caught himself staring a tad too long at the omega when that happens.
Bucky answered by dropping the knife he was holding straight onto the top of Tony’s left hand, leaving a wide slit on the side of his palm. Tony winced at the pain, his blood oozing out.
“Who is?” The guy asked with a shitty smirk. He step forward and grabbed his wrist, leaning into the brunet’s space.
The room fell silent. Just the ticking of the clock and Tony’s whimpers. It was  agonizing. Just the two of them in this dimly lighted room, a heavy atmosphere surrounding them.
“That reminds me. Are you and that senior, Tony Stark, really brothers?” She said sweetly but Steve could see, hear the disgust in her tone.
He heard a deep sigh. “Big bro.” The voice said. “Tony, I’m coming in, okay?” The door creaked open and in came his younger brother.
“Ah, not really. I was just . . . remembering something.” He told her with a shy smile, looking out at the view again.
Tony’s little brother Steve was really nice and a capable guy overall. He gets pretty good grades even though it’s not as good as Tony’s. The top player in the school’s football team since freshmen year. A person admired by both the juniors and seniors. A feat which was not easily achievable.
“Yes, I really do.” He said, breath shaking. “Because I couldn’t make Tony happy at all. In this condition, I only burdened Tony. From the beginning to the end. Even just for once I want to make him think that he was happy to be with me. That is why, if he does come back, I want him to have those memories. . . .Dr. Banner, you haven’t asked me about my body at all.”
“Thank you, Mrs. Madeline.” I said, taking it in my hands, grinning. “You brought it quite early today.”
“Will you at least forgive me for this, god?” He pleaded softly in the quiet of his lonely, dark room.
The wrist he had taken hold of was the injured one. The place where Steve had patched him up just last night. He winced in pain as Tiberius hardened his grip on it.
“Something smells burnt as well as delicious. What are you guys making?” He said, still in his pajamas.
“No! We did not!" Tony exclaimed, horrified and embarrassed. "What the fuck, Clint? How the hell did you deduce that?” He says raising his eyebrow in a mocking manner.
She may have not been a very good mom but she was the only one he got and it made the truth about her death even sadder. To die in the hands of a cold blooded killer.
Soon enough, touching himself through his underwear wasn’t enough anymore. He slipped his hand inside, directly massaging his now dripping, hard cock.
He looks inside the fridge and winced a bit with the bright lights coming from it. He looked around and found lots of food but they were all in need of a being cooked before one could eat them and Tony didn’t feel like doing it. Besides, cooking wasn’t one of his fortes. If it was gonna be like this he wonders if he should just sleep it off.
He looked around the photos hung around the wall. It was him posing in all of them. The wedding photo, the family photo, another where they were celebrating Peter’s birthday. Everything looks legit.
“That is my shield.” Hydra Supreme said lightly, one pale eyebrow raised. He seemed unsurprised by Steve’s presence, more amused than anything. He had started to move around Steve, circling him. In his hands was a baton that fizzed with electricity as he twirled in, blue sparks flying around him.
At some point, there had been a press conference; Tony standing in a smaller version of his father’s suit as he held up his circuit board to the flash of a hundred cameras. Howard had been stood next to him, grinning. Tony had tried to smile too but his mother’s pinched, pale face was staring at him from the side of the stage, and Tony felt off-kilter as if he’d been caught doing something wrong.
“Chaotic scenes continue throughout San Francisco following the introduction of a daily fee for Stark’s extremis 2.0.”
Inside the viewing room, Steve felt his heart stop, straining as if it would break into two. He could see the pain, the momentary doubt in Tony’s eyes, the desperate desire to be loved. The Hydra Supreme saw it too, his mouth twitching with victory.
Her hand skimmed across his forehead, pushing up his curls gently. “Oh dear, you’re burning up.” She exclaimed, her voice rising like a musical scale. “Do you feel too hot, tesoro?”
The doctor smiled, the movement making his moustache curl in a happy white comma. Maria was almost vibrating behind them, fingers interlocked so tightly her knuckles were bulging and white with blood loss. She made a noise of distress as the doctor packed away his thermometer, snapping his stiff leather bag shut.
“But this isn’t my suit. I don’t wear anything like this. And why do you keep calling me Commander!”
Tony nodded and when the coffee came, he did as he was told, forcing himself to breathe through his nose to stop himself gagging at the bitter taste. The pills were big, hard to swallow and they got caught in the back of his throat, leaving his mouth powdery and sore. He had to try a couple of time before he managed to get the correct timing of taking the pills in his mouth and gulping down coffee to make everything slid down his throat.
Soon, his doctors’ appointments started again. With the confidence gained from their trips to the nutritionist and dietitians, Maria looked further afield. Tony would watch her as she sat curled up in her favourite chair in the living room, a yellow-pages balanced on her knee and her index finger sliding down the page, caressing the various names of doctors until she found one she liked.
“No!” The Hydra Supreme gurgled from the floor. Tony’s bullet had caught his neck but his healing factor had already started to work, his words torn out from his ruined throat. “How did you…”
Outside the room, stretched a long, unbroken corridor. Like the bedroom Steve had woken up in, it was white, sterile and cold. Steve followed it as it wound lazily upwards, spilling seamlessly onto an enclosed walkway with floor-length glass windows. Steve stopped and stared. Before him, stretched a huge shimmering blue expansion of water, the edges of waves highlighted gold from the sun. In the distance, a city sprawled out across two uneven coastal land masses, connected by a familiar, red bridge. What was Tony doing in San Francisco? He couldn’t remember Tony ever having any ties with the city. Steve didn’t remember Tony mentioning any property here. How had Steve even got here?
Tony hadn’t even noticed Steve until he spoke to him. He glanced over, snorting at the filly pink apron Steve had tied around his waist. Steve was holding out a spatula, his whole attention on Tony.
The room sharpened into focus; shadows retreated to reveal a small, bare, white room. Steve’s first thought was that he was back in a jail cell but the room was too luxurious, too expensive. The cotton sheets beneath his skin were as fine as silk, almost slippery as he moved. The thought luxury had Tony written all it. And Tony would never let S.H.I.E.L.D. get their hands on his A.I.s. Steve must be in Tony’s personal custody. The thought made Steve feel cold.
It took a few seconds but Steve slowly realised he recognised the room, remembered the neat little bedroom with the two picture frames in pride of place next to the bed. He had been there recently, fallen asleep with another, different Tony resting in his chest.  Steve’s hands clenched, leather twisting in his anger. This was calculated manipulation, a way to disarm Tony, to confuse him with memories of kindness and love. Steve had seen tactics like this before, they were always accompanied by violence, with fear. A carrot and stick to force the victim into preferred behaviour.
Steve raised his hands in surrender at the boy’s surge of anxiety. “Whoo, hey. I’m not with anyone.”
The picture got put on the fridge so everyone could see it, right next Papa’s favourite fan letters and a photograph of his parents from when they were younger. They were kissing each other, hands curled up around their partners' cheeks and their hair illuminated gold by the fireworks exploding behind them. Peter had always liked that photograph: it made him feel all warm and lit up inside.
The doctor smiled at Maria easily. “It’s quite common in children this young. It can be hard for them to explain their symptoms. Tony is lucky he has such a dedicated mother.”
“There’s something else, you’ll need it to get into the Triskelion.” Tony gestured to a small black band resting on the table. “It’s a hologram generator. It will work with your suit. Make you fit it.”
“Please don’t let them take me.  I don’t want to go back.” Tony sobbed, fingers clutching Steve’s suit as if he expected the man to abandon him at any moment.
JARVIS, always one step ahead, had queued up the film and the familiar brass notes of the main theme filmed the darkening room.
The white-haired man rested one of his big hands on Maria’s shoulder, his voice for the first time coming sharp, firm. “My medical opinion is that he is fine and you need to stop worrying.”
Steve broke away for a second, forcing himself to look down at Tony. “I’m not him. I’m not your Steve.” He said; he had to say it. Had to make sure.
“I broke the ropes and crawled out the window. The bad men didn’t think I would do that because it was so high and they had taken my shoes but I did. And I cut the fuel lines in their truck so they couldn’t come after me.”
“It shouldn’t still be able to do that; I wonder if each section has a power source?” Tony said, nodding to the robot arm twitching under Clint’s bow. As if on cue, the arm gave a final splutter and went limp and dark. Tony made a noise of irritation and lent down to pick up the arm, fingers skimming over the metal plates.
“Oh, the cabinet at the back, that’s where he kept all the stuff from the war.” Tony gestured to the thick imposing oak dresser at the far side of the room. Dust had settled in a fine layer and the dark wood looked ashen.
The paper towel was back and for a moment they sat in silence until Peter found his voice again. The horrible squirmy feeling in his stomach had settled down a bit and he thought he understood what had happened. His Papa hadn’t meant to hurt his Daddy, it had been an accident. “But you were shouting again.”
Steve sat up carefully, flexing and stretching gently. He had been laid out across Tony’s bed, left alone to sleep. The wound in his side was radiating heat, hardened by the nanobots but the pain was reduced, the injury smaller. Steve poked at his side gingerly.
“His vitals are spiking!” Hands pressing him down, medical gloves covered probing fingers. Steve could feel the prick of a needle in the crook of his elbow, hear the beep of machines.
“Tony,” Steve asked slowly, “I jumped to a time where we were together, romantically. When – when does it happen?” Steve wondered if Tony could hear the longing, the impatience in his voice.
Peter shook his head. He didn’t have the words to explain. There was just a horrible, awful, desperate feeling in his chest that hurt really bad.
Tony was glad he was so tired otherwise he was sure he would have screamed like a little girl as Steve’s hand landed on his shoulder. Instead, he jumped slightly, an unbidden shocked noise catching in his throat, scrapping his oesophagus raw as he forcibly swallowed it down. Steve watched him carefully, waiting for Tony’s response as the silence lingered between them.
Tony tried to turn at the sound of his name but he was unsteady on drunken feet. He lost his balance, falling to the ground, his elbow catching hard on the concrete beneath him. Steve leapt out to his feet, moving to Tony as quickly as his aching body would allow.
“You should know there is no straight answer to that question. But whatever we are, I can’t imagine him not being here with me.” Tony looked up at Steve, his electric blue eyes dark beneath the heavy sweep of his eyelashes. “I want you with me.”
Steve spun around sharply, he hadn’t heard the door opening or the booted footstep of the Hydra agent entering. The man stood before him seemed to be struggling not to cringe in the face of Steve’s fury, his mouth quivering nervously as Steve stepped forward.
“Whoo!” Whoo!” Steve called hands out in front of him warily. The rest of the kitchen had gone silent and Tony could feel the other Avengers staring at him, watching. “Sorry, I didn’t mean to startle you.”
“So righteous.” Tony hissed, “I used to admire your conviction, your unwavering sense of right and wrong. Before I understood it was just arrogance.”
Steve faltered, realisation making his understanding of the man before him shift again. This Tony was like sand, impossible to get a grip on. Impossible to understand. “You want to make a serum for your Steve.”
Steve placed Tony on his feet quickly, crouching down next him and resting his hands reassuringly on Tony’s shoulder. The boy looked like he might collapse at any moment, terrified shudders were running through him and tears had left long wet runway down his pale face.
It's been almost a year since I updated this. Very sorry to have kept you waiting! Please feed me comments, it keeps me motivated to write.
His Daddies room was down the hall from his. There was a bathroom between their rooms with a tub big enough to swim in, but it didn’t take him long to run past that and to his parents’ bedroom door.
“I want to sell him the serum.” Tony corrected, “I want him in my debt. By my side, at my feet. Either would work.”
“Steve, you’re looking better. Love the suit.” Tony’s voice was a drawl, familiar and warm but with an undercurrent of something darker, sharper than Steve was used to. He sat in his soiled sheets as if it was a throne, the light fell directly onto him, illuminating his face.
Doctor Everette disappeared as quietly and unremarkably as all the doctors before him but his legacy was long-lasting. The test had revealed a multitude of allergies: eggs, lactose, fish, red meat, almonds. His mother was ecstatic at the news, vindicated. Tony spent hours with his mother at various dietarians and nutritionist. He would sit forgotten and bored in the corner of the examination rooms, swinging his legs while his mother chatted amicably to the health professionals, laughing together as she took notes and made plans. Like Doctor Everette they were all captivated by her beauty, by her dedication to Tony and his complex health problems and praised her selflessness, making sure Tony knew how wonderful his mother was. She glowed under their praise, a sunflower feeding off their worship.
There were two photos, framed in narrow silver. The first picture he had seen before held longingly in the hands of the red-eyed Tony – the picture of him and Tony from their early Avengers days, laughing into the camera.  The next picture was new, Steve hadn’t taken this picture yet. It was Steve and Tony again, taken at night with the faint sparkling shimmer of fireworks flashing behind them. Steve had his arm around Tony’s waist, holding him close and Tony had his hand cupping Steve’s cheek, holding him steady as they leaned in closer to kiss.
“Take a breath of the gas,” the nurse repeated and pressed the nozzle into his mouth. Tony breathed through the nozzle shakily as another stab of pain ripped deep inside his guts. A tear escaped, sliding down his heated cheek and into his hair.
“I know you hate crumbs in the sheets but you look like you could do with dinner in bed,” Tony said a plate held out in offering before him. Steve’s stomach made a sudden loud growl, ignored hunger making itself know. Tony laughed at the sound. “I brought extra. I know how much you can eat.”
“Stay still, it will over soon.” The nurse cooed and her hand pressed down hard on Tony’s shoulders. Tony stared up at her, wet-eyed but whatever she saw in his face made her turn away, lips pursed.
“Only a little. It might feel like a little scratch.” Doctor Everette’s face appeared in Tony’s eyesight. The man bending down to smile at him. “You can be brave, can’t you Tony?”
Peter skidded into the kitchen at a run. Neither of the adults in the room saw him, they were too busy focused on each other. His Papa was looming over his Daddy and both of them were scowling and shouting. It was going to happen again.
Steve looked up. Tony eyes had moved, shifting away from Steve to focus on the screen, on his Steve. The other Steve, the old Steve was walking up a set of stairs, each step slow and painful looking. “I made an extremis strand just for him.”
Daddy ran his fingers along Peter’s scalp for a moment and Peter looked up to watch his familiar face as he spoke. “No sweetie, I’m not going to leave him. Amy’s parents had a different situation. It wasn’t an accident when her daddy hit her mommy. Your Papa would never hurt me or you on purpose.”
Steve wasn’t sure how long he stood silent and unmoving, staring at the screen. At some point, the video feed went dark. The comatose Tony and the Hydra Captain America disappearing like a bad dream. But Steve found he still couldn’t move.
The nurse had taken them to a private room with a little attached bathroom. Tony’s relief at the privacy of the room hadn’t lasted long as the nurse had given Tony laxatives. Tony hadn’t known what a laxative was until the little pink pills had left him curled up in tears on the hospital toilet, his guts twisting and spasming in agony as they emptied. Later, the nurse had returned to take his clothes and shoes and Tony had been left to wait in a thin paper gown, shivering and stiff with cold and embarrassment. Tony’s previous paediatricians often lifted his t-shirts to feel his tummy and listen to his breathing and heart but they had never stripped him completely. Tony felt small and horribly scared. He had wanted to ask why they had taken his clothes, to ask what was going to happen next but hadn’t quite dared.
They came to a stop just before the atrium. The single exit out of the triskelion required them to leave through the atrium: a huge, open space crawling with Hydra agents.
Tony could still feel the phantom touch of her hand on his shoulder squeezing hard, her fingernails biting into his skin in warning. He shivered and shook his head, stomach churning.
He propelled them both towards the room’s back wall, slamming Daddy against the wallpaper hard enough to make the dark haired man gasp. Peter whined nervously, his thumb coming up his mouth.
“Sometimes adults shout at each other, it’s not always a bad thing and it doesn’t mean they hate each other, or they’re going to hit each other. We were shouting but Steve wouldn’t have hit me, no matter how angry he was and no matter how loud we shouted. I’m sorry we scared you.”
Steve sucked in a sharp breath of recognition. His own face stared back at him. His features, worn, withered away by age.  A vision of himself fading away. The man in the video took a right down a side street, his back to the camera once more.
“I have to leave,” Steve said. It was the truth at least. He didn’t quite know when but he could feel that he had another time jump coming. There was static across his skin, prickling across his tongue. He would be gone before morning.
Not knowing, what else to do. Steve opened up the first aid kit. There was a SHIELD engineered clotting agent for operatives in the field. It would do in a pinch. Steve poured the agent onto his wound with a wince.  It seeped out like foam, sealing the bullet wound under a hardened white cap. Over the top, Steve placed a thick gauze pad, strapping into across his torso. He sighed in relief and leaned over the little sink, his fingers leaving pink marks on the porcelain. It would hold. For now.
There was a flutter of movement at the corner of the room, drawing Steve’s attention abruptly. Someone else was in the room with Tony.
Even the anger they inspired in each other had been a clue Steve was too blind to see. A lot of superheroes had been for the SHRA but none of them had enraged Steve in quite the same way as Tony. Steve had told himself it was because Tony was his best friend. That Tony should have known better and Steve was so angry because Tony had betrayed him. But Sharon had betrayed him, shot him on those courthouse steps and Steve had barely given her two thoughts. Tony had always been different.
His parents never turned him away from their bed and Peter liked wiggling up between them, feeling them curve their bodies around him. Daddy always made sure Peter was curled up against Papa because he was worried the arc reactor would hurt Peter. But Peter didn’t think it would, he liked the arc reactor, he liked the cool metal and the warmth from the blue light. After he’d had bad dreams in his own bed, he liked going to sleep with the arc reactor’s light burning into his eyelids, keeping the nightmares away.
Maria was wearing a dress of pastel sunshine; the hem shimmed her knees in a pin-straight line and the sleeves stopped neatly at her elbows, perfectly tailored to never crease. Despite the wait, she looked as fresh as when they had arrived, her flower sweet scent enveloping Tony as she bent down to kiss his sweaty curls. The familiar caress of affection made Tony flush with a rush of remembered humiliation and pain.
Tony laughed, breaking the steely intensity of his expression. He shrugged, “Well you have something I want. Don’t worry, it won’t take long now.”
“Get out. We’re done here.” Tony told them flatly, not even bothering to glance at them as they stumbled uncertainty in movement.
He started walking again, straight out into the road. Steve lurched after him, grabbing Tony’s arm and dragging him backwards as a car horn screeched angrily past them. He pushed Tony back, almost throwing him against the wall.
Tony went silent, mouth hanging out. “But I thought you came from just after the SHRA? I arrested you.”
“What did you do to me,” Steve asked him breathlessly. Tony ignored him, his features sharp, intent as he examined Steve. Steve reached out, grabbing Tony’s wrist. “Tony, what did you do to me.” He repeated; his voice hard.
Beneath him, Steve stiffened. His hand dropping away from Tony’s face so abruptly, Tony nearly fell over.
“Sorry for the mess.” Iron Man said, a gauntlet hand rubbing the back of his neck sheepishly. “I really wasn’t expecting company. I mean, I hoped, but I didn’t think it would work.”
The muscles in Steve’s jaw twitched, spasming in anger. “Do not compare the two.” He snarled, his hand came out, finger jabbing into Tony’s chest. “I took the serum so I could serve my country. You got an entire city addicted to extremis so you could make a profit.”
Steve made a noise of frustration. His anger spilled over and he grabbed Tony by the arm, reeling him in. Tony seemed amused rather scared, tipping himself forward into Steve. Steve’s fingers dug into Tony’s bare flesh hard enough that he could feel the heat of the bruises already blossoming beneath his fingers. “Stop messing around. What are you playing at!”
“I am.” Steve agreed easily, lips twitching at the awe in Tony’s little voice. Even with his injury, they made fast progress now that Tony was off his feet. The sun was searing, heat prickling Steve’s fair skin but Tony unwittingly provided a little shade for his neck and head. His little feet were swinging gently, heels bouncing off Steve’s uniform.
“I should have known!” The AI snapped, “I helped him. And now Manhattan is trapped in the darkforce dimension. Steve is the ruler of Hydra; the Hydra Supreme. He has a team of superheroes working for him. Those of us that he hasn’t captured are scurrying like rats, hiding in shadows. And I… I can’t even touch anything.”
The test was over minutes later, leaving the skin across Tony’s back hot, prickling like he’d rubbed stinging nettles across it. He slowly levered himself upright, lilting to one side dizzily. His mother and Doctor Everette didn’t notice him. They were stood close together, laughing. His mother was radiant, glowing as if she was full of sunlight, her eyes dancing. Everette was mesmerised.
Outside San Francisco was a faraway stack of lights and sound, its dark shadow cast across the churning sea.  From Tony’s haven the city looked calm, a slumbering giant. Steve wondered what it would like close up. He pressed his hand against the glass window, suddenly weary. Tony had been strange from the moment Steve had woken up, colder, crueller, cruder. But he had also protected Steve, healed him from a near death experience. Tony had their picture from when they were younger. He had even confessed that he wanted Steve to be by his side. Steve had been so grateful, so willing to ignore the warning signs as long as Tony still wanted him, still valued him. As long as Steve could believe that there was a future in which they could become friends again.
Steve shook his head. “Another you gave me nanobots, but that didn’t last. It’s started bleeding again.”
“I’m grateful for the first aid, but I’m really getting sick of people stripping me while I sleep.” He mumbled, throwing his legs over the side of the cot. They were in a workshop, a shinier, more polished version of the one that at A.I. had created. It gave him a strange sense of déjà vu, seeing a similar layout, the close but not quite the same placement of electronics and tools.
Tony nodded, his fingers twitching with unspent energy. “I think if we put the cube back together, we can fix him. I have everyone looking for the shards.”
“I know,” Steve squeezed Tony’s hand again. He struggled to form the next sentence, unused to putting himself out there, to trying to vocalise his feelings. “During the SHRA, I thought that we were done, that we had been through too. That we had made too many mistakes to ever recover. I know that’s not true now. I saw what we can become, how much we care about each other. I know this isn’t the end.”
Tony shrugged, “Mess it up. It sucks anyway.” He threw himself onto a huge leather couch, sprawling out across it like a cat. “I’m telling you because you asked me if we were friends.”
“Anthony, answer Mr. Jarvis,” Maria told him softly. Her eyes peered over the edge of her sunglasses and she took a long drag from her cigarette, releasing the smoke slowly in a small perfect plume.
“Trust me, as much I like the idea of playing with you. I’m not making this up. Think about it, Steve, you appeared out of thin air in the middle of a park in San Francisco. You have a wound you can’t heal from. You’re in a different city. Look at me, I’m not the same Tony you left behind right.”
Peter didn’t know why but as Daddy leaned into the hand on his cheek, pressing the bruise against Papa’s fingers even though it must have hurt, he decided he didn't need to worry so much.
“Osborn,” Steve repeated the name like a lightning rod. His mind itched. A memory of Tony, grinning up at Steve through his lashes, eyes dancing mischievously flashed through his mind. Steve shook his head, “Where’s Tony?”
Tony looked down into his coffee cup; it was still nearly full. The once steaming liquid had cooled to something tepid in his hands. His strained, bruised eyes stared back at him from the surface of the coffee, haunted-looking. “Bad dreams.” He told his reflection with a grimace.
The shock on Tony’s face disappeared like a mask falling away. He mouthed Steve’s name once again, his lips twitching, twisting: a smiling snake.
Steve let himself fall, knowing there was nothing he could do to stop the move. He could almost feel the time bullet dragging him onwards, keelhauling him at the red-eyed Tony had mockingly called it. Steve slammed hard to ground. He choked on dusty, hot air, blinking as floating light danced in his vision.
“Yeah, yeah… if you want.” Steve said carefully, “Can I stay here with you for a little bit. I brought your drink.”
“Fuck,” Steve hissed. He couldn’t believe how hard he was, closer than he’d thought possible considering all they had barely started. He had never felt this out of control with anyone else.
Tony rolled his eyes at Steve’s obvious uncertainty. He turned away from Steve. “F.R.I.D.A.Y bring up today’s news feed.”
Tony looked at him, expression soft, warm despite the wetness at the corners of his eyes. Steve reached out, cupping Tony’s face so his thumb could brush his tears. Tony’s eyes blinked shut slowly and he leaned into Steve’s hand, rubbing against him like a cat. The heat in Steve’s chest spread, kindling low in his stomach. He could barely breathe, his gaze laser-focused on Tony’s face in his hands.
“That is correct. It is Monday 16th March 2015,” the soft female voice replied. Steve’s wandering thoughts snapped back to the present, panicked.
Steve growled; his heart was racing, blood pounding in his ears. He swung them around, dropping Tony down onto the cot he had woken up on. Tony yelped in surprise; eyes widening with shock. Before he could say anything, Steve was on top of him, parting Tony’s thighs so he could press his hips down hard into the dark-haired man. They both groaned at the sensation, Tony’s fingers scrambling, clawing against his bare shoulders.
Steve held his Captain America uniform like a long-lost friend, resisting the urge to press his face into the hardened Kevlar. It felt like a lifetime ago when he had last worn it, he’d been a different person.
Steve touched his wound gingerly. It was hurting less, the throbbing fire in his side, cooling down to a fever instead of something that was on the edge of consuming. He supposed it made sense, a wound less aggravated now that he was being summoned. It still wasn’t healing though, still energy sapping and bleeding sluggishly. It might have slowed down but it would still kill him eventually.
Jarvis didn’t reply, standing still next to their table. He was frowning again, mouth moving as is he wanted to speak.
“I don’t believe that. I don’t want to believe.” Steve told him, his fingers flexing into desperate fists. “I believe I can make up for my mistakes and so can you.”
Doctor Carter snorted, settling down back at his desk. “You’d be surprised.” He glanced over at Tony, an afterthought, “You can come down from there now Tony. I think we have everything we need.”
Steve stood up, stepping closer to the suit. He remembered a previous Tony’s off the cuff comment about wearing the suit for months on end, not being able to take it off and face himself. And even before then, Tony had always used the suit to hide his weariness, his injuries, his humanities. Steve sometimes wondered if Tony preferred to be thought of as a machine. Uneasy prickled up the back of Steve’s neck. “Tony, let me see you.”
Tony hummed. His gaze slid down Steve’s body, “You can tell the wound in your side isn’t normal.  It’s not healing like a bullet wound, right?”
“Don’t worry, I have something to settle your stomach,” Maria told him soothing, reaching in her pocket. She popped open the lid of a little orange pillbox, spilling out two little white pills into her hand and dropping them into Tony’s outstretched palm. “Take your medicine and drink all of your coffee and it will help. OK?”
They clashed hard, the grating sound of metal hitting metal echoing around the atrium. Every hit was sending warning tendril of pain through Steve, leaving him sluggish and distracted. He was struggling to react fast enough and every now and again the baton would hit him, a jolt of electricity zapping him. One electric blast to the neck left his crying out in pain, falling to his knees. He struggled to get up, to move again. When Steve looked up, the Hydra supreme was waiting, the baton thrust under his chin warningly. “I won’t ask again, where is he.”
Tony glanced between Clint and Steve. The sleep-soft look in Steve’s eyes had been replaced by something by something blank, distant. Despite Tony’s gaze, Steve continued to look straight ahead, the muscles in his jaw twitching. There was a barbed comment on Tony’s tongue, building up into existence but before he could say anything, Steve had stood up and walked away. Tony remained on the couch, crossing his arms and tried to subdue the crawling, sting of embarrassment prickling across his skin.
“We should do something fun,” Tony said finally, voice airy. He gestured at Steve to follow him, already starting to walk away from Steve. “Your miserable looking face is really starting to bore me. Keep frowning like that and it will stick you know.”
“Jesus.” Tony hissed, straining against Steve’s grip. “Don’t say things like that. Or I’ll come in my pants like a teenager.”
Tony reached into his pocket, holding out a sad looking photograph. It was the same one he had been looking at in the park when Steve had first seen him. “You are,” he said as he handed it to Steve.
He smiled uneasily at Steve, “It’s fine. I just don’t want you to be disappointed. I don’t know how much he kept.”
“Jesus Christ, Tony!” Steve ran a hand through his hair in disbelief. “What happened to you? This isn’t you! You used to care about people, you used to want to help people!”
Peter gnawed at his bottom lip thoughtfully, he wasn’t sure JARVIS even had a colour. Maybe he should just draw a red dot like the sensors in the walls, but that didn’t feel right either. In the hopes of inspiration, Peter upended a carton of crayons, fanning them out across his paper to fully assess their different merits.
“I mean, the science is a little bit questionable admittedly,” Tony said dismissively, uncaring in the face of Steve’s panic. “But by science or magic, here you are.”
Peter struggled against unconsciousness, rolling sleepily towards the warm body next to him. A hand came and petted his hair and Peter opened his eyes to smile up at his Daddy, knowing who it was from the way he ran his fingers gently back and forth against Peter’s scalp.
There was a billboard, stood proudly atop of the building facing them. Giant red letters facing out to the city. At first, Steve thought it was Tony’s logo: ‘STARK Industries’. But on second glance, he realised it was wrong. It didn’t contain Tony’s name. The A,R and K had been removed, replaced by new letters. ‘STANE Industries’.
Steve lost time, finally submitting himself to the throbbing, unrelenting pain in his side. Darkness crept at the edges of his vision and when he blinked, he was lying flat on his back, somewhere new. He shot upright, fists swinging.
There was something wrong with Tony’s face. Steve frowned, trying to understand what he was seeing. The slits of the Iron Man suit exposed Tony’s eyes, a tiny window beyond the armour. But the skin around Tony’s eyes was different. His eyebrows looked strangely blue, his whole face seemed blue in fact.
Steve frowned, shaking his head. “What? No? I’m not benching you. I just thought, well it’s just doombots. We don’t need the whole team. We can handle this without you if you don’t feel well.”
Tony nodded, trying to understand. He knew what drinking was, Howard ‘drank’. If his mother always had a cigarette in her hands, his father always had a drink. He had made Tony drink whiskey once, shouting that Tony needed to stop being a sissy and start acting like a man. Tony remembered the feel of Howard’s big hands holding the back of his head, keeping him still as he’d worked his thumb between Tony’s lips and pulling them wide as if Tony was a fish on a line, gasping breathlessly. The whiskey had made Tony gag and he had cried, squirming to get away but his distress had just made Howard angrier. His father had pressed the tumbler into Tony mouth, glass bouncing off his teeth painfully and cutting into the delicate sides of his mouth.
“Looks like you need a few more tweaks before you’re roadworthy,” Tony told him, fingers skimming Steve’s sides, measuring the wound lightly. The strange monster under Steve’s skin flexed, rippled at Tony’s touch like a dog wagging its tail.
“That was really smart,” Steve told Tony and the child beamed up at him, his smile bright despite the grime and bruises littering his face.
Tony snorted, ignorant to Steve’s tortured internal monologue.  “He can’t. He doesn’t feel the way I feel.” Tony said a strange watery smile flitted over his face: embarrassed, longing.
Sam nodded in agreement. There was a tension in the air, the feeling of anticipation that always came before a mission. “We have to stop him before he gives Osborn the register.”
Steve called his name and Tony waved at him over his shoulder. “I’m going to put the suit on. I’ll meet you there.” He snapped over his shoulder and darted downstairs to get his armour. Steve’s voice trailed after him, confused and frustrated.
He rubbed his eyes, the strange split-second dream of Tony calling out him, begging his for help lingering list cobwebs. Steve decided it was a fever dream, probably some sort of twisted expression of his own conscience. He just wasn’t sure if he was imagining Tony calling out for his help because of his experiences with child-Tony or because some part of him could only imagining Tony asking for him if he had no other option. Steve grimaced, dropping his hands from his face.
When Tony had been very young, he had been barred from his father’s study and most other places his father frequented. His father saw no use for a baby or a toddler and had made sure Tony was neither seen nor heard. Tony’s world had been his mother and Jarvis. He had been squirreled away upstairs and transported through the back corridors of the house. He had learnt early it was best to keep away from his father, to be a shadow in his own home.
Sharon stared down at him; her face was perfectly blank, doll like. Clutched in her hand was a strange-looking, still smoking gun.
“Well, maybe he should,” Steve told him, realising that there was some truth in Tony’s words. He should have told Tony how much he meant to him more often.
“Here let me get you a drink, you must be thirsty.” Steve moved over to the entrance, his back to Tony as he poured a glass of water. “The pod was a clever idea by the way. It made you nearly as good as new.” He turned, smiling back at Tony, a predatoriness lingering at the sharp edges of his mouth. “Well nearly. It will take a while for you to regain control of your limbs.”
The doctor ignorant of Tony’s thoughts merely smiled at Maria's words, reaching out to cup her gloved hard reassuring. Maria’s eyes glowed, her mouth curling at the edges.
“How convenient.” Steve snapped, and gingerly pressed his fingers against the wound again. It remained normal this time, feeling firm and clotted under his fingers. But he could tell he wasn’t healed. It felt hot and painful like a fresh wound and that it itself was unusual. If F.R.I.D.A.Y.  was correct and he had been here for at least eight hours, he should have healed almost as good as new. The bullet wound on neck had faded to a faint, tender red scar that would be gone completely by nightfall.
“But who will look after you?” Steve asked softly and before he could help himself, he was back to holding Tony’s face, his fingers tangling into Tony’s unkempt wild curls. Tony leaned into his hands once again, body going soft, limp at his touch.
The extraction team was waiting for them as promised: two automated iron men suits – one built extra-large for Steve. The suits wrapped around them and shot like comets into the air, taking them far away from the Triskelion and the Hydra Supreme.
“No.” Tony hissed, breathing whistling through his teeth. “I know you, the real you. Steve would never join Hydra. He loved me.”
She smiled and the expression stretched taut across her beautiful face. “Close your eyes, Anthony,” she told and then she was reaching down and wrapping a blanket around him, tucking it tightly around his legs and arms and right up to his chin. Tony wiggled uncomfortable, quickly overheating. Her hands were firm, holding him still, biting hard into the narrow delicate bones of his arms.
Tony didn’t look unconvinced. He was trembling, body turned away as if he was about to run. He was, Steve realised, so scared, profoundly and deeply terrified. More scared than a stranger recognising his name should have made him.
Despite Bucky’s harsh words, there was a small amount of surprised, grudging respect in his voice. It was hard not to respect Tony, for his absolute commitment to doing what he thought was right, to not just throwing himself on a live grenade but pulling the trigger in the first place.
Steve swung his gaze back to Tony, his expression fierce, burning with feeling. “So, you need to keep trying. People need you. I need you.”
“If you press the button on the side of the band it will stop,” Tony said, arms held tight into his sides.
The roar of an engine shot through the quiet air, drowning out the lazily chirping crickets. Tony twisted, a noise of panic escaping him. He gripped Steve’s hair, tugging painfully. “Steve, Steve. It’s them. There’s here! They’ve found me!”
Peter glanced up to see Amy staring at him curiously. Her face was smudged with red felt-tip pen so bright it almost matched her hair.
He nodded his head at her and waved at Tony before he was gone, stepping out of the room with sure, happy footsteps.
Steve stepped forward, desperate to know. “You said it wasn’t what I was thinking. Then show me, Tony. Take me to him so he can explain.”
“You shot me!” Steve said before he could stop himself.  Sharon recoiled; she looked stricken, blood draining from her face. Steve’s hand had automatically gone to his side, stuttering when his fingers met smooth, unblemished skin. He kept patting his side, seeking something. There should be blood. His mind was fuzzy, he couldn’t’ remember why he thought there was blood.
Tony threw himself off the bed, trusting that Steve would catch him before he fell. Steve did. He wrapped Tony in his arms a with a relieved sigh, holding the man a fraction too tight against him. Tony’s fingers dug into his shoulder, biting down hard enough to hurt. He pressed his face into Steve’s neck, shuddering in relief. “I knew you weren’t Hydra; I knew he wasn’t you.”
The crowd image changed, replaced by a video of Tony in his sleek silvery suit hovering over the crowd. He was smirking, white teeth sharp and predatory in his face. The crowd pressed towards him, they weren’t fighting like the last video, they were happy, adoring. And yet Steve could see the edges of desperation straining their eyes, the fear in the shakiness of their hands. They worshipped Tony but were scared of him.
“There was nothing immediately identifiable. However, we will go over the footage in more detail and be in touch with you with the full results in the next couple of days Mrs. Stark.”
Steve hesitated. “I’ve got another idea.” He pressed the button on his wrist band, a wave of Hydra black swallowing his suit. Tony’s eyes widened, betrayal creeping at the edges of his expression. He was getting ready to shout, to fight. Steve slapped a hand over his mouth, just in time to muffle Tony’s scream.
“Going off without the team is! That’s not how we do things and you know it. You pull this shit again and I will bench you!”
Tony pulled his t-shirt back down but didn’t get up off the examination table. His mother and the doctor were absorbed in their quick-fire conversation, his mother prompting the doctor when he started to trail off into silence. Tony was tired and happy to stay lying on the table. He was always tired lately.
“Are you sure, you’re OK?” Tony asked after a moment. He sounded tired, uncertain and Steve felt another stab of guilt.
Tony narrowed his eyes suspiciously but Steve just smiled, pressing his advantage. “We can finish watching the Stars War.”
The cigarette was an almost permanent accessory, but she rarely inhaled instead holding it delicately between her fore and middle finger until it burnt down past the filter. Sometimes when it was just the two of them, she would hold up her hands and spread out her fingers for him, grinning mischievously like she about to perform a magic trick. Tony would get flashes of small, unhealed burn marks hidden on the inside of her knuckles; little bubbling blisters that she would press the flat edge of her fake nails into until they popped and liquid spilled down into her palms. It felt like a secret shared just with him.
The pain in Steve’s side was starting to subside, fading to a familiar, deep ache. He pushed himself upright, blinking in confusion as the room came into view. It was a workshop, or it had been a workshop. Now it seemed part hoarder’s madness, part junkyard. It looked like it had been neglected and Tony never neglected his tech.
The beggar was wearing what once might have been a nice suit. It was now covered in stains, hanging off his frame as if he had lost a lot of weight too quickly. His trousers were torn, one pale knee flashing through the hole in the material with every step. Shaggy, unbrushed hair hung limply over his face, hidden beneath dirt and unkempt facial hair. And yet, despite his appearance, Steve recognised him instantly.
Tony sniffed, held still as the doctor made a series of sharp little scratches across the bare skin of his back. It was a small pain, nowhere near as bad as his cramping, upset stomach or the burning in his throat after he threw up but it was also worse somehow, the pain in his back and his mother’s hands holding him down. His chest hurt, locked up tight with a feeling he couldn’t identify. Tears pooled at the corners of his eyes, falling to the floor beneath the examination table.
Tony tutted is disapproval, gently pushing a strand of hair out of Steve’s face. “Don’t lie, Steve. I saw the footage, the look in your eyes. You wanted to hurt me. It must have felt so good, finally managing to shut me up.”
“Oh yeah.” Tony nodded violently. “He’s the best superhero ever.” Tony peered at Steve’s discreetly from beneath his lashes. “You know, you look a bit like Captain America. But your suit is wrong.”
Tony had been born a sickly child and stayed that way. Undersized and thin for his age. At three he could still fit as easily as a toy doll into his mother’s lap. She was humming a tune, each note rising and falling with the movement of the chair. Every now and again she would break out into song, a whisper of Italian that stroked across the top of Tony’s head. “Dormi, Dormi bel Bambin.”
Tony, it was always Tony. Steve couldn’t sense the other man, but he could hear him, swearing and cursing as he circled Steve. The pain in his side was too much for a moment, stealing Steve’s words and leaving him gasping voicelessly like a fish on land.
The morning after another sleepless night Peter wondered downstairs, the floor was cold beneath his bare feet and he curled his toes up trying to keep them warm. In the hall he carefully avoided the splits in the tiling. After a while he gained some confidence and leapt over multiple stones, swinging his arms back and forth to gain some momentum. He kind of knew how kinetic energy worked, his Daddy had explained it once, but mostly he just liked the giddy feeling of almost flying across the floor. Peter knew he shouldn’t be having fun, not now that his family was going to get a Divorce but sometimes it was hard to remember since everything seemed so normal.
“In fact,” Steve drawled, rocking forward. His body pressing hard into Tony’s flattening him against the wall. “I’m almost looking forward to it.”
Steve’s fingers had crept up to rest against his mouth, tracing the heat Tony had left behind.  He sighed as the door closed and ran his hands through his hair. Maybe he should just tell Tony what was going on. Obviously, they were on good terms here. Maybe he could help. A childish, weary, part of him rejected the idea – he would most likely be moving on again soon. There was nothing Tony could do. Steve was so tired, he just wanted to rest, to sit down. And He didn’t want Tony to stop looking at him like he had hung the moon.
“Yeah, I’m just tired. It’s been a hard day” He made himself relax, drawing Tony to him and holding until the other man relaxed against him with a sigh. Tony’s eyes drooping, his fingers running up and down’s Steve’s arm, petting him, comforting him.
Tony smiled weakly; he was glowing, shining with a faint, watery blue light. “Go, you need to save Tony.”
“And me? What can I do?” Steve asked, feeling for the first time uncertain, doubtful. He was in pain, weakened, exhausted and he might disappear at any moment, pulled away again through time. “Am I here to fight him or find the cosmic cube?”
“Yeah,” Tony pulled a face, “For the record, I preferred it when you running backend. At least then I always knew where you were.”
Steve conceded to Tony’s demands without another word, troubled by his thoughts. He strapped the band to his wrist, swallowing as it clicked into place, a blue like flickering on. Static electricity raced across his limbs, a cold finger running up his spine. Like tiles being tipped over, the blue of the suit was swallowed by a wave of black. The Hydra symbol sat proudly, sickeningly, on his chest.
Something out the corner of Steve’s eye snagged at his attention. A flash of movement out of place in the sluggish writhing of the crowd. He glanced up. Across the road, a glimmer of red sparked in an open window. A rifle’s laser.
“You’re drinking again?” Steve asked horrified. He had seen this before, seen how it nearly destroyed Tony.
Tony blinked up at Steve, his eyes wide and shocked. He was holding himself, arms curled defensively across his chest and rubbing at his bicep where Steve had grabbed him. “I don’t think hallucinations are meant to be so corporal.”
Steve hissed. He tried to flex, to fight against Tony’s hold but he was unmoveable, a mountain against his strength. Tony grinned, amused and then like a shadow he was gone, leaving Steve abandoned, a broken toy on the floor.
Maria laughed, one hand coming up to stroke his face, her skin soft and warm against his cheeks. Her eyes were dancing, full of energy.
“Whoo! What did you do?” one the of the men asked, even as he stomped down hard on Steve’s bent leg.
“Yeah, I don’t think so,” Steve said and charged forward. The Hydra Supreme smirked and ran towards him.
