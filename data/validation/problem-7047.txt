“Alright, too far," Tony snapped, stepping in front of Tony, "One, I do not hide behind Howard. Two, you can talk shit about me all you like, and how little of a threat I am, but you do not have the authority to treat Steve, my soulmate, like that. I could legally sue you for harassment, and given my rise above you, I would easily win that court case and leave you and your shambling corpse on the street."
Steve smacked one of Tony's flanks, not moving otherwise just yet. "You are in no position to tell me what to do. This is punishment remember? So I will move when I choose to."
"I'm sure I'd like a surprise more." Steve grinned, picking out his clothes for the day. "I always prefer those surprises--" he purred, kissing Tony's cheek as he dressed.
"We'll go and see all of them, whichever fish you want. And since its winter, I think they have the penguins there now, too." Steve grinned, loving how cute Peter was when he was excited about something. "And we can go to the interactive museum too, if you want."
"Look Cap, thanks for coming and helping and everything, but that's something I really do NOT want to talk about right now. I just... want to be left alone for a while, alright?".
"Thank you," Tony murmured, hands trailing over Steve's ass, "This'll be our little secret, then. Your boyfriend will never have to know how much you like being bent over my desk. Might call you in more often."
"No, you cannot do experiments on your sibling," Tony said over him, rolling his eyes, "He or she is going to be looking up to you, Pete. For advice, how to behave, stuff like that."
"That's a good boy, such a good boy," Tony soothed, waiting for Steve to be spent before taking Steve's and his own condoms off, tying them and throwing them away.
He sighed when he realized he couldn't drag his Papa, opting to hop down the stairs and cling onto Tony instead.
," Steve reiterated, moving off of the couch to fetch another gift in the back of the tree and bringing it towards Tony and Peter. "I have a little surprise myself." He grinned.
"Love you, too..." He noised softly at the kisses, running hands down Tony's back gently. "But you've done so much for me. I could never hope to do as much for you."
He stood to tug the lacy cami off, pulling the blond down for a kiss. Steve kissed back happily, tilting his head to deepen it.
"Goodness..." The blond said softly, continuing to rub his back and soothe him. "Once you think you're done, then you can say what you are wanting, okay baby?"
"You can pick your after school stuff too, pipsqueak. Papa and I can find a bunch of stuff for you to do," Tony hummed, rubbing Peter's back.
“I’m a boring old man, Steve. I would just like the team having dinner in the Tower, maybe some wild karaoking…” Tony says.
. Still, he’s thinner than he’s ever been before, stronger than during his teenage years but maybe leaner than he was. He has days where certain foods upset his stomach and he had to take up training on the Compound’s treadmills to build up his resistance again.
If someone had tried to tell Tony that this would be the kind of easy and fitting conversation he’d be able to have one day with Steve Rogers Tony would have either laughed in their faces or completely blanked at the idea. Not even during his best times with both the Avengers and Steve had Tony been able to bring down his walls and open himself up to this kind of effortless companionship with any of them. Not even Bruce, who for a while Tony had considered his second closest friend.
And those major feelings mix with a thousand others in his heart: he shouldn’t be alive, not after Thanos, so how can he allow himself that type of happiness again; if things with Pepper didn’t work, if the one person Tony has loved with his whole being wasn’t someone Tony got to keep how can he think he will ever get the opportunity at love once again?
Thor doesn’t actually come into his room but Tony catches a glance of him twice through the glass walls of his room.
“Obie was the closest thing I had to a father after Jarvis and to this day I still don't know if he ever cared about me,” Tony declares as he holds a glass of untouched scotch on his left hand.
There is a part of Tony, however, a part that terrifies him like no other, that shuts things down to protect himself. Protect himself from what? From Steve. It’s the part of his mind that still conjures nightmares of Siberia, of Steve’s shield against his chest, of his icy eyes cutting through Tony like he has never been anything Steve can respect or protect.
Everything is dark and quiet and Tony gets an uncomfortable chill down his spine roaming the halls of the building, or sitting at the kitchen table to have a quick snack, or looking out the window as the sun sets behind the trees in the horizon.
“Thanks, J,” Tony says after clearing his throat and this time there is no doubt, he’s blushing. “Send them up.”
Rhodey sighs behind Tony and Tony takes a step towards the right of Natasha again so he can stop giving his back to Rhodey and instead can look him in the eye.
Pepper’s face breaks and she inhales harshly, not a full cloud of air but an interrupted process, like her lungs are resisting, like it hurts trying to fill them up but she’s pushing through the pain. Her lips press together, so hard they turn white and she closes her eyes as she starts exhaling through her nose, also intermittently.
He tosses and turns and thinks of Steve. He huffs and goes to the bathroom for a glass of water and thinks of Steve. He checks his email and closes his eyes tightly and thinks of Steve. He falls asleep and wakes up much too soon thinking about Steve.
He can feel his mind go fuzzy and he knows he’s falling asleep. He tries to fight it by opening his eyes but they close again of their own volition.
Tony has changed everything by coming back because he has helped Steve change. He’s been helping him even before he knew it but now that he’s truly with him Steve is more himself than he’s ever been since before the ice. He’s maybe more himself than he’s ever been.
Steve’s head shoots up from his lowered position and his eyes are wide when they settle on Tony’s form. His eyes and nose are reddened and his cheeks are wet, tears still making their way down his smooth face. His mouth is opened wide and Tony wonders if it’s because of the surprise of having been caught crying this way.
“Hey, lovebirds!” Clint shouted to them, startling them both and pulling them out of their little bubble. Tony and Steve turn around at the same time to face the group again. “Sam and Bucky are going to leave now and you two, Nat and I are going to that Italian restaurant that I love so much, Nino’s. Is that okay with you?”
Tony’s hands find leverage in the table’s edge and he bends his elbows at the same time that he does his knees, and with a little jump he hops on to the table.
There’s only one way he can find out if what he feels for Tony is real or not: he needs to be with Tony, to spend time with him and get to know him as a person who’s really sharing space with him.
Natasha steps into the elevator, Tony following her, and tells JARVIS to take them to Tony’s and Steve’s floor before turning to the man and with a hand resting near her heart she innocently says, “I’m not implying anything at all. I totally believe that Steve
Clues? Coordinates? How is Tony supposed to know? And if he did know, doesn’t Steve think that would be the kind of thing Tony would share from the get-go?
He wakes up disoriented when he feels himself being moved but he’s too groggy to open his eyes fully.
“If he’s not talking to me or Valkyrie I doubt he’d agree to see someone, a psychologist, I don’t know,” Bruce guesses.
And Tony has known for a while that what they share is love, that isn't really surprising. Their love has been real since before their first kiss and Tony has worked day in and day out to show that that love exists within him. Steve has worked on it too, and Tony has felt it so thoroughly for months and months.
Steve turns his head to the left to meet Tony’s eyes. He holds Tony’s gaze for around 5 seconds, as if trying to read something in them that Tony isn't sure he can project. Finally Steve moves his eyes way from Tony’s but only long enough so he can lay his body down next to Tony’s. As soon as he’s settled in his new position he captures Tony’s gaze again.
For the first time since they all got settled into the conference room, Tony’s gaze fixes solely on Steve. He’s leaning against a table, his arms crossed and his legs too, a defensive pose if Tony’s ever seen one. But there are no enemies for him in this room, only allies. Or at least, there are no enemies for him in the room at this moment.
He can’t not tell the team because he knows that if they were to find out, even if it wasn’t through him, that this was not what Tony wanted they’d be as upset as Steve is at the idea of not giving Tony what he truly desires.
It’s a little harmless fantasy Steve has been nurturing for a while, since he started getting to know who Tony was through his best friends, his AI and his bots.
This time, because Steve is actually saying this to his face when he’s not passing out and he can properly hear it, Tony is able to ask, “What are you apologizing for?”
She takes two steps towards him and he takes one in her direction. Steve has to follow him with one of his hands still on his waist and the other hovering over his left elbow, ready to catch him if he falls.
Tony has a minute where he all he can feel is disappointment flooding his every pore. This time there was no question, no yes or no possible answer. Steve was the one who made sure of that.
“Everything okay?” Tony wonders as he rests his hands on Steve’s shoulders, walking forward a bit so he can place himself between Steve’s thighs. The position makes it so Steve has to look up at him as he thinks back to the picture adorning Tony’s phone screen.
“I don’t think it will hurt,” Steve says. “Right now Clint is probably the one who can understand Thor best.”
Steve sighs and he’s started crying again. His voice keeps being steady, however, and his breathing doesn’t change. There are just tears falling steadily from his eyes as there are words falling from his lips.
After another half hour has gone by Natasha stretches her arms above her head and cracks her back, letting out a groan of satisfaction.
The conversation has taken such a turn it’s almost dizzying. This was supposed to become a fight, if anything. A heated argument rooted in Steve’s irresponsibly made statements to the public that have put the Avengers in an uncomfortable situation, in a precarious state.
Tony is facing the room and he must be seeing every one of their friends there, including Pepper, Rhodey, Peter and Happy, but Steve is not looking in the same direction Tony is. Steve only has eyes for Tony. He only has eyes for him and his amazed face, mouth opened in surprise, his cheeks a little rosy-colored from the exhilaration of it all.
“I found the picture on FRIDAY’s server. I hope you don’t think I was snooping or anything like that,” Steve explains. “I just think it deserved to be displayed. You both look happy.”
He wants to make it through and that’s what stubbornly keeps him in bed, first on his back, then laying on his right side and then turning to the left.
Tony’s been feeling restless and unsettled the days previous to her scheduled arrival and it didn’t really help that Bruce left only two days ago to Norway to visit Thor.
Pepper walks over to the empty side of the bed when she’s done changing and she starts laying down in bed. Instead of positioning herself next to Tony Pepper continues moving until she can lay with her body pressed to his side and she can rest her head on his chest, her ear to where the reactor would have been once upon a time.
Natasha walks towards him and stops to stand right behind him. She rests her hands on his shoulders and leans forward to kiss him on his left cheek.
Steve has lost count of the number of movies and shows Tony has made him watch with him, some good, some bad, some life-changing. Star Wars and Tony’s enthusiasm over Princess Leia. The Lord of the Rings and Steve’s wide-eyed astonishment at its everything. The Powerpuff Girls and their unapologetic love for them despite the team’s constant teasing about it.
“I saw this coming a few years back,” Tony muses out-loud. “I had a vision, but I didn’t want to believe it. Thought I was dreaming.”
It only took Tony three steps to place himself in front of Steve. Now that they were so close Steve noticed that Tony was shorter than him, shorter enough that his face would fit perfectly in the crook of Steve’s neck if they were to hug.
Tony takes a step back but he doesn’t second guess it much when he keep a hold on Steve’s hand to pull him along behind him as he exists the room.
Tony’s very unsubtle way at distancing himself from Steve. Tony’s very obvious attempt at pushing him away.
It was cold outside. Really, really cold. The kind of cold you could feel in your bones, the cold that set home in your joints and your crevices and only a scalding shower could get rid of. Snow was falling outside Steve’s little apartment, covering every Brooklyn street and making everything, even the horizon, look white.
“I know,” Tony says as he tucks a strand of Steve’s hair behind his air. It immediately breaks free again. “I know, Steve.”
“Oh, sure,” Tony replies instantly and Steve starts getting to his feet as soon as he hears Tony’s response.
“I felt like the Accords were something that was dumped on us, like we didn’t have a choice in the matter. How could they be the best decision for us when we didn’t even have a say in them?”
He’s not sure how to explain it because the feeling of that possible last goodbye when they slept together after so many months apart left him feeling warm inside, like for the first time in his life he was doing something right. The second time, as soon as it was over, had him shivering and adrift, like there was something wrong in their slow caresses and their deep kisses.
Tony moves towards the left arm of the couch, not to put distance between him and Steve this time but to rest his back on it and still be able to face Steve.
Tony’s left in just his boxers in front of Steve, who starts folding the clothes up and wrinkles his nose.
“Spot on, Captain,” Tony says and he regrets it the instant it leaves his mouth. He’s well aware of his defensive retreat into sarcastic and douchebag mode when he’s nervous, but it’s been a long time since he’s felt the need to engage it while in Steve’s company.
When she has seemed to calm down again she continues running her hand down her face until she makes a fist to rest her chin on, her knuckles grazing her lips as she speaks.
First it was during the war when he obviously never had time to go sightseeing and even if he’d had it he would have never felt up to it in that situation. All the downtime he had was spent with the Commandos, playing card games and laughing boisterously, or sleeping, catching up on days without proper rest, trying to will the nightmares away.
“And that’s a good thing, of course it is,” Tony says, keeping his voice calm even though Steve’s own tone is rising. “We
They’re attuned to each other now, whether they like it or not, and Tony thinks that, as much as he hates the situation, there could be worse people to be stuck with on a stranded ship moving across the universe with no real aim or direction.
Rhodey arrived yesterday afternoon to spend the weekend in the Compound and, as he promised, he’s not there for work. He’s there to simply be with Tony, to share time together like that haven’t been able to do in a long time.
“And,” Tony continues. “I don’t know if I said it but… I’m here, too. I’m here if you want to talk.”
It’s something Steve once mentioned in passing in a conversation about what happened during those days when they had to fight Thanos separately.
As Tony bends down to close the dishwasher door Steve clears his throat. Tony incorporates and closes it, pressing the button to turn it on and then looks at Steve. He’s standing in front of him, hands in his pockets, his expression concerned.
Tony can more or less guess where the rest of the team is right now because, for a band of heroes, gods and former assassins they are pretty reliable when it comes to routines. Steve has probably gone on his run already and is most likely taking a shower, debating the best way to get Tony out of the shop and into bed (which, no, he has to finish the upgrades to the suit and he will not rest until he can increase the intensity of the blast of the left repulser without compromising the stability of flight); Clint and Natasha must be at the gym, sparring and being generally and awesomely scary; Bruce is either in his lab or in bed after an entire night of being in his lab and Thor… Actually, Tony has no idea where Thor could be, Thor is the most unpredictable of all of them. He could as well be climbing Mount Everest or snorkeling in the Great Barrier Reef for all Tony knows. (He once disappeared for a week and came back with tales of his great backpacking experience through Europe. To this day, they still have no idea how he did it without any money or even with whom.)
“He would have loved seeing you with the bots,” Pepper interrupts Rhodey. “He loved it when people treated them like humans too.”
Steve finally turns back to him, although only with his head. His body is still facing forwards, creating an invisible barrier between him and Tony.
It was only after he formed the Howling Commandos that Steve stepped into a leadership role and, if asked, he would never deny that he had his difficulties, especially at the very beginning, with being the head of the troop. It took him a long time to not second guess his every decision and, at times, he still did every time he closed his eyes. He got better at everything that being a leader entailed but it took practice and patience and support -a lot of support- from his friends and comrades.
Tony thinks that even if he had been to do so physically he would have never found the mental strength before.
Steve isn’t touching his bed and though his eyes are still closed Tony can imagine him being a respectful distance away, not wanting to crowd Tony, maybe not feeling ready to close the invisible barrier that exists between them since that fateful day in Siberia.
They’re partners, and when the time comes again they’ll have each other’s backs in all battles and wars.  Even the ones they fight with themselves.
If Steve has never willingly shared the full range of his emotions with Tony before it feels wrong that he’s witnessing this while Steve sits there, unaware of the audience.
So Tony decides to go for the simplest and shortest answer in the hopes that Steve will fully understand.
Tony had completely forgotten she was here for a minute and although a lot of Natasha’s whole being resides on making herself invisible and unassuming whenever she desires to be it makes Tony feel unsettled even to this day. Especially because this time he doesn't think it had been her choosing to blend into the background. Tony had simply been completely enraptured in Steve and oblivious to the rest.
At one point during the evening Natasha makes what to anyone else could seem like an offhand comment but what Tony knows is something Natasha has been building up the courage to say for a long time.
Time moves quicker than Tony consciously realizes and even though it feels like nothing in his life ever changes at all, it slowly becomes obvious to him that everything is always constantly changing.
Steve’s back and shoulders are so rigid Tony can almost feel their tension from across the room. Steve’s hands are balled up in fists and they rest next to his thighs on the bed. His posture screams defensiveness and tiredness and it hurts Tony’s heart.
“Yeah,” Tony confirms with a small nod of his head. “But that’s not really what I came here to talk about.”
“I thought Natasha would have told you we talked about it,” Tony says. “I told her I didn’t mean it. I never really wished I was dead.”
A silence stretches between them for a minute or two, so comfortable Tony is reluctant to break it but there’s something he wants to say.
Tony looks at her, at her clean face that shows the bags under her eyes and the soft lines of worry on her forehead, and asks her, “So you and the Doc…?”
He knows his question was stupid because of course they went without him, he is under no condition to be doing anything but rest at the moment and he knows he would have only been a liability but…
Avoiding Tony means Steve has to avoid Pepper and Rhodey too because the pair of them haven't left Tony’s side much at all since he came back.
But then he thinks of Natasha. He thinks of every version of her he has ever known. He thinks of her when they’ve been at their best, two complex and layered people that don’t always understand the other but still love each other the same. He thinks of her when they’ve been at their worst, when he’s felt betrayed by her and she’s probably felt disappointed by him. Tony thinks of Natasha and the fact that she’s family. Imperfect and complicated family, but family nonetheless.
Tony thinks about the question and realizes that while any other night the response would be an affirmative, this once he had just lost track of time. To tell Steve the truth would mean talking about how much his conversation with Natasha has really affected him. To tell Steve the truth would mean talking about this, whatever this is, whatever it is that it’s building between them and that can’t Tony can’t help but rethink over and over again.
Tony feels like everything is moving in slow motion, even if he knows it’s all his brain. His brain trying to process the image of Steve eagerly taking off Tony’s underwear. His brain trying to process Steve’s breath on Tony’s dick. His brain trying to process the image of Steve licking his lips as he gazes upon Tony’s dicks, balls and ass.
Natasha finds Tony as he’s preparing dinner for himself one day. Steve called just minutes before to regretfully tell him he wouldn’t make it for the meal but he’d be bringing dessert over later. As his plans for the evening had evaporated Tony had opted to make a quick salad and plant himself in front of the TV to watch some mindless reality show.
He doesn’t do it on purpose, he doesn’t seek out Steve’s t-shirts each morning and ponder carefully which one to take. It feels more like an automatic and effortless action.
Tony had been surprised, at the time, about Natasha’s siding with him, not so much because of the cause he was preaching for but because it was Steve defending the other side of it and Tony could have never predicted Natasha standing by his side and not by Steve’s.
This is probably the first time Tony’s said Steve’s name and it shouldn’t matter as much as it does but there’s something that feels transcendental about it.
There's also discussion of depression during this chapter, similar to the themes we've had throughout the story already.
Tony looks at each and every person in the room as he asks the question. Bruce still hasn’t left his stupefied state, Steve is looking at some indistinct point across the room and Natasha’s eyes, when they meet his, reflect the same kind of confusion Tony is feeling.
Steve’s head shake is almost imperceptible but Tony manages to catch it, probably because of how focused he is on Steve’s every movement at the moment.
"We should, but I doubt he's going to listen to me." He sighed quietly, petting Tony's hair. "He thinks I lied to him. And that look on his face... He looked so betrayed..."
"Pay attention to me," Tony laughed, starting to run his fingers through my hair, "How long will it take for the paint to dry?"
"He's going to give us looks every time we call," he laughed, tipping his head back, "Clint's going to call me like 'bro, give his asshole a rest' and--"
"It’s not dumb. I get what you mean..." The blond whispered to himself since Tony had already left. He was right, it made it seem like it was something they had to do. Steve never meant it that way, but is that what it had evolved into? He didn't want that.
wanna talk about Peter right now?" Tony shot back, raising an eyebrow, "And I can run much farther than ten feet, I just refuse to increase the pain on my arthritis."
"That's why we are going to try and pull you away from that mentality. That's the only way we are going to be able to help."
"Hmm, not just yet." Steve said thoughtfully. "I mean, we have all day to fit in all we can. We should spend it wisely…"
"He's not Steve Rogers anymore, but yes, he lives here," Tony replied slowly, wracking his brain for
"They keep happening, love." He said quietly, pulling Tony in gently and stroking his hair. "Is it nerves? Is that why they keep coming back?"
"Oh my god, you're so cute," Tony snickered, smiling fondly at his snores, "Jesus Christ, I'm so in love with you." He sighed and laughed again, putting a hand through his hair.
"I know, one last thing," Tony soothed, rummaging through his medical cabinet to grab a band-aid, "Then we'll go sleepies, I promise."
"Pep?" Tony croaked, sitting up from Clint's warm lap. He poked his head over the couch, a weak smile on his tired face, "Hey you."
"Gotta beg for it, sweetheart," he purred, flicking the top button of Steve's dress shirt open, "Definitely gotta beg."
"Holy hell, you don't know the half of it, Stevie," Tony groaned, "I don't think I've had as much sex as we've had in the past three days than I've had ever."
"Didn't try to keep it from you." He murmured softly, looking back. "It just didn't ever come up in conversation..."
"I got you," Tony murmured, slipping in a second finger once he felt Steve was adjusted, "You're doing beautifully, sweetheart. All relaxed for me."
'Gee, thanks.' Steve scoffed, an amused roll of his eyes and chuckle leaving his throat as he leaned against the car.
"Anything that you want to do. Sir." Steve continued with the word, breathing lightly against Tony's lips. "Or I can do what you want me to. Whatever your preference is, Sir--" he purred.
Bucky observed the scene of his friend laying on a pile of blankets naked in a chamber meant to keep whatever was in it from hurting what was outside it, looking towards the blond in concern.
"I need your cock in me, Sir, please," he begged, grinding onto Steve's lap, "I need your thick cock so bad, fingers aren't enough--"
Tony snorted and rolled his eyes, pulling out the box of Steve's gifts out from under the bed. He quickly put the condoms in the toe of the sock-- 'for the not-so virgin Virgin,' to which Tony had howled and promptly bought a box--and tucked the paints in after those. He wrapped the new paint brushes in a tie and slipped them in, tucking the various Christmas candy around it until the stocking was completely stuffed. Tony put tissue paper on it to try and hide the goodies, setting to work on Peter's stocking.
"Yeah, you are going to have to try harder than that to make up for this." Steve said sternly. "You are lucky I make sure your paint is washable and I have the ultimate recipe to removing stains. But this... This is unacceptable, Peter."
"We should gets Daddy a shark dolly," he announced, once they started to move onto the jellyfish room, "He likes sharks."
"If it means I get to be with you and do things like this with you,then I would love to 'date' you, Tony." He said with a small mewl from the small bit of friction from their hips.
"...I'll text Bucky in a bit and see if it’s okay first. Then we'll ask Peter if he wants to." Steve whispered back, a pink tinge on his face that hasn't been there in quite a while.
"It'd be nice if she could, wouldn't it?" He said quietly. "She's an angel, though. So she can't really help in that way anymore."
"Lots and lots." Steve nodded. "Any free time she got that wasn't spent resting, she cooked or baked. And she left me most all her recipes she could."
"You are baby, you are, more than you know," Tony whined, shivering under Steve's lips, "God, baby, you don't know what you do to me."
Steve smiled back at Tony, giving his hand a squeeze. He glanced back at Peter and Sammy in the back seat happily before buckling in and starting the car.
Steve reaches out to touch the light, but is halted by a hissing sound. The face of the body started to come off, slowly rising and then just breaking off completely. Steve worries at first and grabs the face that had fallen off, only to find that there was an actual face that had been hidden behind it.
"T'was the night before Christmas and all through the house, not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse..."
"They should be in the dresser. That's where I put them when I do laundry." Steve replied with a hobble into their room to dress as well. "If you've worn them, then lord knows where they could be. You are like Peter and his shoes." He laughed to himself.
"Thank you, Sharon. For this opportunity," Tony smiled, squeezing Steve's hand, "You don't know how much this means to us."
"Well good think I'm tall, huh. I'll help you out." Steve assure with a grin, setting the boy down once they reached Peter's room.
"You are the last out of the two of us who would need to worry about that." Steve answered with a soft sigh. "Hell, you aren't even
"Well, I can be a slut, so Peggy can deal with it or I'll explain how kinky you really are in bed, and how I use slut to my advantage--"
The two sat on the bench together, speaking a bit and getting out all unsaid things before just sitting in companionable silence. Steve could feel his friend's sadness and grief starting to well up inside the other, although it couldn't be seen in Bucky's expression. They had spoke of this, knew this is how it should play out. Bucky had been beside him from the beginning, and Steve knew he wanted his friend in that same spot beside him at the end as well. The blond reached a hand over onto the brunet's, weakly patting the hand in unspoken comfort.
"Yes, yes. You get kisses too, Mister." The blond grinned, smooching the baby's cheeks as well. "Does Daddy want kisses, too?"
"Tony, you'll end up getting bruised at this point if I keep going." Steve pointed out with a hum. "Are you sure?"
Tony gasped, putting a hand on his chest. "I would love nothing more," he grinned, a smirk tugging on his lips, "It's gonna be interesting when you start to play with me, Steve."
Tony nodded, swooping over to his husband to give him a quick kiss on the lips before heading off with Sammy to the nursery.
"I know you're only seven, but you'll keep getting older and I don't like it." He hummed. "I wish you could stay my little munchkin forever. So I can snuggle ya."
"That's why he thought we always argued." Steve said with a chuckle himself. "I explained the whole soulmate situation to him so he would worry about thinking we'd separate." He hummed, a question striking him.
Steve chuckled at that. "He's like 'I'll show ya gross. I'll just touch your face!'." He said dramatically, to which Sammy garbled happily.
"Such intelligent eyes. I'm sort of glad these have been staring at me." He hummed, directing towards the desk. "Lean over the side please, Tony."
As if on cue in comes Bruce, his supplies from today's work overflowing out of his hands onto his bed.
"I... Sure. I've only done that one other time though." He pointed out softly, leaning with the touches. "Let me know if I do something wrong?"
Done up to his satisfaction, Tony grabbed his welding mask and put it on, taking a second to attempt to completely block Steve out.
Omigosh! Thank you guys for sticking around and reading my fic! I know it was a little slow on posting, but I hope you guys enjoyed it~
"Pepper, look, its a really long story, and honestly I don't think you would believe me." Tony responded with  careful sigh, earning a stern look from the woman. "He is a captain though, although he doesn't look like it right now. He's sort of a 'Little Mermaid' case."
Steve huffed a small laugh, a bit bashful of how close Tony was getting though the only just met. But it felt right, though. Must be how soul mates worked.
"JARVIS, turn it off." Steve sighed, wrapping arms around Peter. "Bubba, it’s okay. It’s just a movie. It’s okay. Shhh..."
. Gentlemen, you've given me more than enough to work with," Tony mumbled, eyes darting around the room while he ran a hand through his hair, "I can assure you that the case will easily be solved."
Tony shrugged noncommittally, giving Steve a sheepish smile before giving him another kiss, happily trotting down the stairs to the lab. Sitting at his lab table, Tony stretched his fingers before bringing up his latest project. The blond sighed softly, watching Tony as he headed down to work with wistful eyes. He gave himself a stretch then headed out to start on cleaning up around the house for the day.
He sat down at the top and put Peter in his lap again, letting the boy drag him down the slide another ten times.
Steve's cheeks were flushed as he looked back at the other, lightly biting at his bottom lip as he nodded up to Tony.
"Lil brotha!!!" Peter cheered happily, grabbing Tony's hand and trying to drag him toward the garage.
"Well, if he wasn't, he definitely is now. Nat's biggest turn on is talking about other guys fucking her really hard," Tony laughed again, "Alright, too far, anywhoosies--" He smooched Steve's cheek, easily settling down into his warmth. He tangled their legs together, reaching up to play with Steve's hair.
Steve's chest hurt a bit hearing that, taking a deep breath before speaking. "Peter please, we need to talk to you, baby."
"Sometimes it takes a while for the initial shock to completely pass. Once that happens, you'll know. Grief all comes in stages." She explained, petting at his hair and humming softly.
"Jealousy doesn't look good on a seven year old," he laughed, "But we need to move the bassinet, and we can't exactly tell Sammy to play by himself while we do that, so..."
He hobbled over to the closet, rifling through till he found his bathrobe--the red one he wore when he first met Steve--and pulled the tiny container out of the pocket. He put it in his pajama pocket, hobbling back over to Steve and collapsing on the bed next to him.
"Hey, it's nearly eight," Tony murmured, checking his phone, "Do you wanna get him bathed and in his pajamas while I turn down his bed?"
"I don't plan, I improvise," Tony laughed, smooching Steve's chest, "All I know is you have the stamina of a racehorse, and I wanna see how many times you can go before you collapse." He grinned cheekily up at Steve, smooching his jaw.
"Hey now, no beating up your Papa," Tony called, coming over to take Pete off his shoulder, "What do you have to say for yourself, young man?"
"Alright, alright, sheesh. Tony, control your small child there," Clint teased, setting his gift aside.
"I'm the older one. I should be threatening to put toys away,” He lightly pressed a kiss on Tony's head, nuzzling his hair, "I won't do it again. Promise."
Being the cranky child he was, Peter rolled his eyes, scooting off the couch to sit in front of the TV with no reply. Steve sighed softly, glancing at Tony before going to sit beside Peter.
The next few days were brutal. Finances had to be put in order, the funeral had to be attended to, emotions had to be put in order, and by the end of the week, Tony was just happy that he could relax with Dummy and Steve, sort of back to their regular routine, now that all the guests had left.
"Love you. Love you, love you, love love you--" Steve grinned wide and content, flopping slightly over Tony and kissing at skin tenderly.
"They're hot as fuck, but given the wobble in your voice, I think it'd be best to cover them up for the time being," Tony murmured, scratching at Steve's scalp, "Other than the absolutely delicious feeling of aches, I'm good. More than good. I'm amazing. Are you okay?"
"I'm not trying to pick on you, sweetheart," he soothed, "It's kinda in the parent job description to tease the kids, but if it makes you this upset, I'll stop, okay?"
Tony stilled at that, and nodded, finishing dressing his wound before standing, quietly wrapping his arms around Steve's neck. "Can't get rid of me that easy, Stark-Rogers," he chuckled weakly, tears brimming in his eyes.
"I know you are sorry, buddy. I'm not angry about it, okay? People get cranky when they're tired. Daddy is one of them." He chuckled softly, cutting up Peter's pancakes and eggs before presenting the plate to the boy. He brought over a plastic fork and a glass of juice as well for Peter before sitting down with his own food.
He helped Sammy out of the stroller and pulled the baby to his chest, kissing his fine hair lightly.
“Steven Grant, why does U— my precious baby— have an egg?” Tony emphasized, gesturing to the brown and tan shape beside U.
"That's it. Just like that," Tony murmured. He shifted his knees up, giving himself a better angle to thrust up into Steve.
Peter was still open-mouthed from his place on his bed, taking a millisecond to absorb it all before leaping onto the hammock, cheering as he swung, gasping loudly as he noticed more things around the room.
"I don't even know if I could, pipsqueak," Tony sighed, hand on his chin as he looked over at his worktable, "Maybe. I'd need Bruce to come over and help me synthesize some biomass for it, but it would take a while to perfect it."
Tony's head went up, startled at Steve's shaking him; he smacked his head on the bottom of the machine, groaning in pain.
"Hmm... I don't want ya sick again..." He sighed, leaning into the touch. "Don't want you sick. Just don't like not getting to be close to you like normal."
"C'mon, Peter. Baths aren't bad." Steve pointed out, patting Peter's back gently. "I would think they'd be fun. Plus they are relaxing and warm."
"Okay." He let himself be led by Steve, grabbing his keys and putting on slippers before heading over to the other apartment.
"Even Captain America and Iron Man get scared sometimes. It’s just a sign we are human." Steve soothed softly. "And accidents happen. That's okay."
He did as he was told, slowly bending over the desk. Tony flicked open his belt, pushing his jeans to the floor and looking back at Steve with doe eyes.
"Well, I'm actually hungry, and I know you're going to fuck me senseless again, so there's that," Tony purred, a smirk on his lips.
"Look at you, baby," Tony cooed, tossing his sweats and t-shirt off the bed, "All nice and done up for me. Such a good boy for me."
With a stretch, he checked all his messages from the others and headed downstairs with a yawn, seeing both Tony and Peter in the kitchen.
"You son of a bitch, you made me laugh on purpose to break character," Tony grumbled, leaning up to smooch Steve's lips, "Fine,
"Hey there, Petey Pie!" Pepper giggle, hefting the boy and pressing a lipstick-marked kiss on his cheek. "How you doing cutie? Ready for Christmas soon?"
"It's elementary my dear Rogers," Tony hummed, tipping his chin up, "Only the most complicated puzzles are the ones worth solving."
"Artificial Intelligence. Like a butler, only hella smart. His name's JARVIS, Jay for short. He’s in prototype stage, and can only do basic things, but I like having the company."
"Mmm... I think I'd like to have you inside, if you don't mind that." He offered at a whisper. "Love when you're in me. Feels so good."
Not caring that tears were streaming down his face, Tony removed that last brick, the one that Howard had personally placed in his pocket. With a ragged breath, Tony completely bared himself to Steve, embracing his emotional nakedness.
Tony paused mid-kiss and pulled back, heart thumping in his chest. He quickly pulled out his phone and turned on the video, propping it up so it was pointing towards Sammy.
"It'll-- I might have an attack, but it's very unlikely," Tony lied, already feeling a panic rise at the prospect of reliving that video again, "C'mon. You go get your laptop, and I'll set Pete up with his homework, okay? That way, if I do flip, I can sleep it off before dinner."
The blond keened at the attention, leaning into it and moving to run his hands all along Tony's chest. He tugged Tony closer to him with his legs, wrapping around the man's waist. Tony kissed at Steve's breastbone while working his jeans, having him lift his hips up to get them off.
"Shh. Not your fault, babe." Tony lovingly kissed Steve's forehead, rubbing his arm. "We needed to talk about it eventually. It was best without Pete around."
"Shhh," Tony leaned up to kiss at Steve's neck, quickly pulling his fingers out so he could undress himself, slicking his hardened cock up before easing himself against Steve's entrance. "Relax, babe," he murmured, "Try and relax as much as possible, okay? It'll hurt a little bit, but I'll wait for you to adjust." He slid in, massaging his thumbs into Steve's lower back.
He then wrapped an arm around Tony's waist and pulled him to his side protectively. "And this is my husband and soulmate. Peggy, this is Tony. Tony, Peggy."
Oops. Tony did forget. His face dropped. He didn't think he had lost track of time that badly. He just gets lost in his work when he hit a breakthrough, and time just fell out of the equation.
"Don't make me feel like a prostitute," Tony laughed, "Don't thank me for sex, love. You can thank me by returning the favor
Tony was leading him to where he would get to sleep while he stayed in the man's home, a spacious room with a special sleeping rock called a bed.
Tony looked out the window, a happy purr in his throat. "We should go for a walk. In the sunshine. Ooh-- there's a little bakery I wanted to try, they might have fresh scones this early--" Tony made eyes up at Steve again.
"You're welcome, but don't talk with your mouth full, baby bear." Steve murmured, setting his and Tony's bowl on the table as well. "Just think. Eventually we will have four eating at the table."
"Uh, yeah. Yeah, just--" Tony sputtered gently, trying to carefully lift his soaked shirt up enough to show the other the reactor. The blue of its light illuminated the dusk lightly, reflecting off the merman's eyes which gazed in admiration.
, alone time," Tony sighed happily, flopping down on the couch and pulling Steve over him, "I almost want to take a nap. A huge nap. Catch up the past five months."
"I didn't know that. Well, lucky Daddy and I were born right before the 90s." Steve explained softly. "We have proof we are soulmates, too."
Steve kissed back hard and desperate in reply, hiccuping slightly against Tony's lips to keep himself from tearing up.
"Please what, darling?" Steve breathed, slipping in another finger and thrusting them in and out in a rhythm.
"Trust me, I know you are." Steve laughed, getting a playful smack. "But it doesn't sound hard. Sounds like the stuff I would do normally. I just find it odd being paid by my boyfriend to do things." He hummed in thought.
"We're married. We're allowed to be saps. It comes with the union." The blond grinned, earning an eye roll from Clint.
Steve and Peter were working on rolling up crescent rolls when Tony came back downstairs, giving an appreciative smile seeing Tony in the wife beater.
Steve showed up at Tony and Bruce's dorm that night at seven. He felt out of place in the Rosen dorms. It truly was more focused around the science majors. The number of labs he saw on his way just to Tony's dorm made his head spin. He supposed that if he was invited over again, he might be able to get used to it. If he was invited again.
"Well, that's why we're soulmates, dummy," Tony chuckled, closing his eyes, "Literally made f'each other."
"I'm going to the store for some parts, be back soon, might wanna check on the boys," He got out in one breath, stealing a kiss from Steve with a huge grin before dashing off to the garage.
"All right. Since you seem to think you're getting something in it." He teased with a grinned, taking the stocking and heading off towards his art studio.
Tony laughed, smooching Steve while still panting hard. "Rest, it seems I've worn you out already," he breathed, curling up to his chest.
"C'mere, Peter." Steve chuckled lightly, helping the boy out. "There ya go. You need help with the rest? Or do you got it?"
The blond peeked an eye open, blinking sleepily as he felt Tony move. He nuzzled the top of Tony's head lovingly.
The second piece Tony didn't remember. It looked like he was sleeping, but his face looked completely peaceful and relaxed. This piece's canvas was a calming blue color, the lines slightly darker and flowing softly on the canvas. Both of the first two pieces just blew his mind. With how he had felt lately, he didn't think he had ever been able to make such expressions.
"I think I can handle it. Though, it would be easier for you to just come along quietly. But without a fight, it’s not as fun." Steve smirked, leading to his motorcycle. "There she is. My old Harley." He said with a soft smile.
"Are yer legs tired?" He asked, sitting down on the blanket and tugging Sammy into his lap, "Wanna read?"
"You alright, Tony?" He asked softly, reaching to soothe Tony's bottom. "Now then, how would you like to earn your extra credit?"
Tony was trying to hide the majority of his upset, but some of it still showed up on his face. He sighed before speaking in a low whisper.
"I don't want to hear about your sex with short stack," Bucky snorted, putting the first drawer in and starting on the second, "But while we're on the topic, Clint's home tonight, if you wanna try your 'escapades' again. Considering last time, Pete was throwing up everywhere."
Steve gave a small whine as Tony pulled out, nerves twitching as he was still on his high. When he felt he was good to move, Steve turned to his side, wrapping arms around Tony and kissing gently at his husband's face with a happy hum.
"That was the day your Grandma passed away," she explained quietly, "Your Papa was so distraught..."
"What is this about Superman?" Steve asked as he entered the room, glancing down at the boy in amusement.
Peter gave a quizzical look. "Explains why ya look alike. You've never told me about him, though." the boy pointed out.
Tony's words got lost in an unintelligible string of moans. He was completely focused on the pleasure rocketing up his spine, but he could feel the pain slowly start to overtake him.
"Then best hurry up and open it," Tony replied with a smirk and a raised eyebrow, "I hope you like it, babe."
Steve went silent for a moment, ears twitching as he could hear footsteps from a distance coming towards the lab. He scented the air, stomach growling from the incoming smell of something warm, sweet, and savory getting closer with the sound. It intermingled with a familiar scent that matched the lab’s own, making it clear who it was.
"Well, they're really good Steve," he said, cradling his half of a sugar cookie, "I'll have to see if you can make my mom's Italian Wedding cookies. I never can get the dough right."
"You are such a cheeseball," Tony snorted, leaning back to kiss Steve's cheek, "Once we get out of here, clothes and couch snuggles. M'too tired to make the bed." He smiled lazily, tracing shapes on Steve's chest with his finger.
"Breakfast." Steve nodded back with a small smile, kissing Tony's lips softly. "What would you like for breakfast? Good morning, by the way."
Steve chuckled to himself, just continuing to pet Tony's hair as the other slept. Steve did not speak, but thought. Sent nothing but loving and comforting thoughts to Tony through the bond to aid in a good rest.
He let his eyes glaze over slightly, sinking back into Steve's warmth. He yawned and closed his eyes for only a second, easily falling asleep.
"Really? I need to fix that." The blond smirked, kissing at Tony's face and whispering 'I love you's throughout. He tugged the other close and ran his hands along Tony's back.
His eyes began to fall, tiredness creeping up in his body. When his eyes finally shut, he was in that familiar dreamscape once more, hands still barely holding to that chair as the humanoid figure was the closest it had ever been in their encounters. Before Steve could attempt to say anything towards the figure, a voice came from the form. The voice spoke in a husked baritone, warm and soft. Steve stilled at the familiarity of the voice, the form speaking to him in a voice he had not heard in so long. It tugged at his heart, hearing the words spoken so calm, so reassuring.
Sorry for such a late update. I had been going through college and had lost A LOT of motivation to write anything...
She reached out a hand carefully for a shake, holding Peter in her other arm. "It’s nice to meet you. And your family!". Peggy turned to Steve with a serious look. "We'll all have to sit down and you two tell me how all this happened. As long as I'm not intruding on anything? I know this visit is a surprise one. I apologize."
“I believe I should know what I would agree to before I decide to or not, Sir." Steve answered, shifting slightly in his chair and crossing his legs gently.
"Oh my god, sap," Tony snorted, shaking his head, "You're going to be the death of me, I can tell." He sighed happily, kissing at Steve's chest.
Tony preened under the praise, going up on his tiptoes to properly kiss Steve, full on the lips. He hummed happily, wrapping his arms around the blond's neck.
"'m sorry, Papa. I'm sorry I was so mean to you." He croaked as he apologized. "I thought that if I could be tough with you, I could be tough with Flash."
"Have we ever told you why we wound up together?" He asked softly. "How that, even though we are quite different, we work well together?"
"Nobody does. I used to be sick all the time when I was your age." Steve hummed, backing sure Peter didn't fall off his stepstool. "Luckily though, my Ma was a nurse, so she knew how to take care of me."
"We may have more in common than originally thought, Rogers," he mused, trying not to flush at the satin rubbing a reminder into his skin, "Also, water."
"Yes sir, sorry sir," Tony babbled, stumbling a bit as he was tugged by Steve, "Love your lessons, sir--"
"Hi," Tony mumbled, leaning into Steve's warmth, "Steve's told me a lot about you, but I never saw a picture so I didn't recognize you."
Tony plucked Peter's and his aprons off the rack, tying the little one around Peter before donning his own.
Tony nearly cringed at the workload he just put on himself, but he stuffed it down, offering Peter a smile instead.
He smooched the boy's cheek, only genuinely smiling when he got his first cup of coffee in front of him.
"Good night, Steve. Sleep tight." Tony whispered back, kissing the top of Steve's head at the sandy blond curls.
Steve glanced back at him, surprised. "Jeez, is Howard part Bloodhound or something? That's crazy." He teased, "We'll just have to keep you control for a few days at some point."
"Ah, the young Mr. Stark." Schmidt said unamused, shaking Tony's hand quickly before pulling out a handkerchief to wipe it off, "If I remember correctly, your father still holds that title, yes? Haven't heard any of your exploits in the media for quite a while, even."
Peter made a gross noise and stuck his tongue out too, shrieking when Tony leaned down to blow a raspberry on his cheek.
“Oh, let me tell ya. Steve is such a cuddle bug. Just a big ol’ puppy,” Tony said with a shit-eating grin, just causing Steve to flush even more and earning a raspy laugh from Bucky.
"If you say so." He chuckled back, cooking the French toast and some scrambled eggs. "So we keep my apartment for pretending we are good kids." He joked. "We keep it PG to PG-13 there. Just kissing and cuddles."
"Hmm... You love it when I touch you, don't ya?" Steve whispered with a purr to his tone as he continued his touches. "Love it when I take it slow, just lettin' it all build up?"
"He is right. Time for boys named Peter to be asleep. Especially when they are sick." Steve agreed, kissing Peter's forehead.
Grinning, he stepped back to grab another toy; first, he fixed the cockring portion, then slipped the plug portion in.
"Yeah!" Peter said enthusiastically. "I love going to Uncle Buck and Auntie Natasha's! Uncle Bucky always lets me check out his arm and put magnets on it and Auntie Natasha always bake real good!"
Today was their third meeting since they agreed to actually, well, meet. Tony had taught him about the small things first, like shoes that covered their feet like armor and cell phones which let them communicate with humans, even if they were far away. Today though, Tony was talking about robots.
"Anything you need for me to do for you?" Steve asked softly, trying to keep his mind on track regardless of Tony wearing glasses. "If not, I'll probably just end up doing things around the house."
A big pallet was made on the floor, tons of blankets to make everything comfortable. Tony pulled away from Pepper to lay down on the pallets, pulling Steve to his front and latching onto him.
"Not a problem, babe." Steve answered with a dopey grin on his face, causing Natasha to groan with a smirk.
"Don't question it, you'll do fine," Tony snapped, knuckles white as he roared into the garage, "Upstairs, my room, I'm so fucking angry--"
"And you are sweet." He answered back with a hum. "Sweet, kind, and caring to me always. I got so lucky. So, so lucky." He said softly, eyes shutting for a moment.
"I've always wanted to be a bartender. I'd have been good at it. I guess you'll just have to guinea pig my drinks. You and anyone else who wants one,” Tony joked.
Steve rolled his eyes playfully, grabbing the bag of things and heading into the bathroom to try out everything. As he went through the bag and its contents, trying everything on to find that things fit perfect and comfortably, there was a small flutter of nervousness in his stomach. He still had an unsure feeling of Tony liking it or not. He wasn’t one to constantly admire himself in the mirror, but turning his back to the mirror, Steve couldn’t help but flush at how damn attractive he looked in a plaid skirt and white button down. The panties were
"I'm still sorry. For all I said. It stirred you up to come here, I know it. I upset you. And I'm sorry." Steve hummed, kissing Tony's cheek carefully and wrapping arms around him. "I love you and I didn't intend to get you upset." He soothed.
"Too bad, pipsqueak. Didja think coming to cuddle us would entail you staying up longer?" Tony laughed.
Tony trooped up to the boy's room, not surprised to see it cleaned. He turned to go back downstairs, but against his better judgement, opened the boy's closet. Tony looked around for a second, laughing at the footprints on the wall and shelving.
"Anythin' for you. Any particular way you want it?" Tony hummed back, moving to be propped up over Steve.
"So needy." Steve mused with a playful smirk, slipping two fingers in off the bat. "You don't even need to be stretched much at all. Still pretty open from last night, hm?"
"All right. Back against the wall, head facing the side, and arms apart just a smidge." Steve instructed, helping adjust Tony just a bit. He stepped back to see how it would look before moving to trace the outline with an ebony pencil.
"Don't get salmonella," Tony laughed, kissing Steve back nonetheless, "You've got a pile of french toast with your name on it, and coffee's in the pot. Pipsqueak and I'll clean up in here, then get ourselves ready, right champ?"
"Yeah, yeah," Tony grumbled childishly, still pouting, "Whatever." He barely suppressed the smile on his lips, huffing with a tiny 'hmph'.
"Probably because, other than my roommate, you are the first human being other than my parents that I've ever really gotten to talk and hang out with.".
"How come we can't take 'im home today?" Peter asked curiously, lightly touching one of Sammy's curls.
“No, no, my bad, I should have had the music down lower so I could hear you," Tony winced, pressing his hand to the blood flow, "I'm
"Oh, baby let me see." Steve said in concern, rushing over to Peter and looking at the slight, bleeding cut on his knee.
The first piece was from their first session. In it, Tony wore a gentle and warm smile. The canvas color was a light and inviting yellow. The line work was in a darker yellow, the strokes light and vibrant. Tony didn't believe he was capable of such an expression. It surprised him.
"God, you're beautiful," Tony breathed, leaning up to kiss away the spit and come off Steve's lips, "I wanna-- wanna have you in me, please--"
Steve looked at himself over once more in the mirror carefully, turning quickly when he thought he heard shuffling in the bedroom.
"No problem, munchkin." Steve grinned, kissing Peter's forehead. "Go hide it by the back of the tree so Daddy doesn't find it until tomorrow, okay?" He whispered, watching the boy run behind the tree.
“Please," Tony groaned, arching into Steve's touch, "Please, baby, rough me up, desk, anything, beggin' you--" Tony moaned loudly, whimpering under Steve's touch.
Sammy grinned his toothless grin, raising his arms in victory. Which, inevitably, caused him to fall back over onto Steve's chest, at which he promptly burst into tears.
"That does not sound good," Tony deadpanned, letting Peter down to start making his lunch, "That sounds awful."
"Clint, man, I've missed you, dude. You and mama spider," Tony laughed, "Which reminds me-- Clint, Steve Rogers. My soulmate. Yeah, that's right, that hot mess is
"I juuuust might think you're handsome, too. And the cutest thing when you're all flustered like this." The brunet admitted, hoping Steve couldn't feel how rushed his heartbeat was. "Did after the first few times we met and still do honestly, despite the circumstances. Wish you didn't have to go to the length you did, but I am glad I have more of a chance to do this."
"You know what." Clint said quietly with a touch of concern he tried to lessen in his tone, eyeing Tony and crossing his arms.
Tony happily took the baby back and made noises at Sammy, grinning when he babbled the same noises at him.
“Bless you," Tony mumbled, crawling into one of the dining chairs, "I want it black, if you don't mind. As much raw caffeine as possible."
"You and Sammy are just as important as the other, Peter." Steve explained gently. "He just requires a bit more attention right now until he is able to do things himself. It makes it a little more difficult to have just time with you, but I'm trying bubba. I'd like us to just have us time. I always have ever since we adopted you."
"We can work on that tonight, if you want. Get it done and ready since Christmas is the day after tomorrow." He hummed quietly, kissing Tony's face gently. "He'll be happy with everything for sure."
They continued with this until twenty was reached, Steve softly soothing Tony's bottom, red and sore.
Peter nodded softly, letting Tony scrub him up. His eyes were still a little puffy, but by now it was mainly from needing sleep. He about nodded off before Tony's voice chimed in at him.
clothes," Tony laughed hysterically, crouching down to take Peter out of the clothes, "You got the wrong pile, sweetheart."
Steve's face tinged slightly pink at that, Natasha snickering next to him and Bucky looking highly unamused.
"I think I'm in good shape for a couple more rounds," Steve purred, getting up onto the desk and crawling above Tony. "And don't you roll your eyes at me, mister. I love when we just get the chance to be sweet on each other." He explained, leaning down to nip playfully on Tony's bottom lip.
Steve looked around carefully before leaving his cavern, swimming almost all night until he reached the grotto told to belong to the Warlock Johann.
"Tony, I need to speak with you about your current progress in my class." Steve said almost sternly, sauntering into the room dressed in suit pants, dress shirt. A pair of glasses framed on in and a ruler in his hands.
"Pray tell what always has you so very, very distracted?" Steve asked, crossing his legs slowly. "Because if you keep being distracted, you could go on the verge of failing my class."
..." Steve breathed, snaking his arms to the nape of Tony's neck to play softly with hair.  "Y'can move, baby. Please.".
"Well I mean-- I'll be good in a few minutes." Steve sighed softly, nuzzling at Tony's hair sweetly. "So how is it going to go down this next round, huh? Seemed you have a plan."
"All right. All right Just--" Steve cut himself off with a growl, almost animalistic, and switched gears completely. He grabbed along onto Tony's hipbones, pulling the man to him and making is thrusts progressively harder and deeper.
"And I want to give you everything, Tony. Everything I can give." He answered sweetly, eyes fluttering closed. "I love you so much. I just want to take care of you... Keep you safe and loved..."
"I'm going to guide your hand for now, okay? At least until you get the hang of it and what feels good." The engineer explained carefully, moving the blond's hand downwards. "You want to grasp it gently in your fist. A nice, in-between pressure that you are comfortable with. Slick is always good to have, but sometimes the body produces something that can be used as it."
"No, no. You are little Pete, and you will always be little Pete," Tony laughed, taking his seat at the island again.
Steve couldn't help but snort a laugh at what Tony was saying, an amused smirk directed towards him from the brunet as they walked. He didn't know what this place held yet, but he knew that with his loved ones with him-- with his Tony beside him through it all--, it all would be okay. He was finally home.
'I'm happy you like it. Wanted to show you I appreciate all you've done for me, y'know?' The blond hummed, looking over at Tony fondly. 'You go out of your way to help me with so much, I can't ever possibly thank you enough, Tony. Really.'
Tony nodded softly, grabbing one of the pillow off the bed and putting it on the floor, kneeling down on it. He looked up at Steve, a begging look on his face.
He gave Steve a lazy kiss before tucking his head down, easily falling asleep, surrounded by his lover's warmth.
"I just don't want to end up scarring the kid somehow, y'know?" Steve sighed, nuzzling Tony's neck. "He's only six. And I don't want to make him move rooms, though. It’s not fair to make him leave what he knows just so we can have a roll in the hay. Seems selfish..."
Tony gasped softly, wrapping his arms and legs around Steve, smooching every piece of skin he could reach.
"We'll stay in the guesthouse," Natasha decided, grabbing her boys, "C'mon, you two. Let them have their peace."
The blond looked over from where he had been playing almost a game of fetch with Dummy, eyebrow raised.
The blond looked back at him defensively for a moment, then glanced at Tony's chest before speaking softly.
"Oh, poor dear." Peggy said concerned. "It especially doesn't look good when I was asking for you using your unmarried name." She hummed.
Peter sniffled and nodded, reaching out his arms to Tony. He smiled softly, trying not to wince as he moved from the floor to the couch, letting the boy curl up in his lap.
"Ooooh, how're y'gonna take care a'me, Steeeeve," Tony hummed, nuzzling at Steve's neck, "You know I'll always complain."
"Okay, okay. I'll stop. Let you rest, love." Steve said warmly, kissing him gently. "Get you some rest."
"Loving seeing you all needy like this, Stevie. You boyfriend probably does too," He continued, slipping a finger inside Steve, "I bet he's fucked you under the bleachers, in the janitor's closet--"
He carefully pulled out the paper on top, smiling fondly at the careful etchings of him, Peter, him and Peter sleeping or playing--
"No. No objections. None at all." The blond breathed, wriggling slightly under the touch. "I hadn't known you even had such desires towards me." He murmured, feeling Tony gently teasing at the skin around his groin.
Tony got oddly quiet for a moment, before picking up Steve's right hand, kissing over his palm and ring finger, spinning the tiny silver band.
He stripped out of his pajamas and pulled on the black pair of frilly panties, slipping his sweats back up his legs. With a shiver, Tony grabbed the leather paddle from the closet and set it on the desk, only deciding at the last moment to slip on his glasses.
"I get to have my own drawing stuff? And then we gonna watch a movie togetha? Is Sammy gonna watch too?"
"I know, I'll play with you in a minute," Tony laughed, going to find a place in the shade to set up.
"I'll explain when we get home," Tony murmured to the boy, who nodded and clambered back up into Tony's lap, snuggling up to him.
Steve gave the boy a soft smile, petting at his hair. "They're angels, baby. My daddy's been one since before I was born and my mommy's been one for eight years now."
Tony sat down on the floor and stared up at the pieces. He felt terrible. Tony felt like a horrible person for what he had done. He wanted to talk to Steve. He wanted to apologize for how he acted, wanted to explain everything that happened, wanted to tell Steve that he--
"See? You're okay," Tony soothed, gently bouncing the boy on his knee while Sammy nibbled on his teether.
"Yes sir." Peter said softly, clinging to Tony and not yet looking over at Steve. Wetness started to build up at the corners of his eyes when he finally did look to Steve, lip wobbling softly.
The first few tries was almost like watching a fawn trying to stand on its own, but eventually they got to standing and taking baby steps. About halfway through, Steve had tapped on Tony's shoulder. The blond had been looking down at his legs the majority of the time, a confused look on his face. He tilted his head in questioning, holding up three fingers.
Steve scurried around the kitchen, thinking of what to make. He settled on simple Macaroni and Cheese. It would take long enough for the boys to get a cat nap and it was a comfort food, which they could really use right now.
"Alright. Manly things." Steve said in a deep voice to sound tough, only leading him into laughing. "Okay, alright. No feelings talk. Gotcha."
"Your smile is pretty great, too. And your laugh? Makes me want to laugh along with you." He explained, shifting in his seat a bit more comfortably for the both of them.
Tony tsked and rolled his eyes, quickly drying himself down. "Let's get into some warm sweats and sleep," he murmured, already walking towards his bedroom.
"Thank you all for coming. We really appreciate it." Steve said with a smile as he saw them out. He let out a relaxed sigh as they left, heading back up to the bedroom after finishing cleaning up.
"I know, that's the part that worries me," Tony muttered, "What's gonna happen when Peter starts ballet again? He's going to be gone for a couple hours, and Sammy's gonna get fussy."
"I know, next time, I want you facing me," Tony murmured, tucking his head under Steve's chin, "If you want a next time, that is."
," Peter hiccuped, tears streaming down his face, "Unca' C'int wuz talkin' 'bout his doggie an' how he m-misses her, an' I jus' wanted t-t'add her to the fam'ly, buh Unca Buck y-yelled at me f'dwawin'--"
“All I'm saying is I'm sure as hell not taking a black light in their room," Tony laughed, "Hey, I don't mind it. Clint taught me sex and gave me The Talk, it was uncomfortable as hell, but hey." He shrugged. "He's family. So basically, it’s your brother talking to your brother-in-law about our sex lives. Which isn't surprising to me."
"He might be saving those things. Tony did say we were going to try some stuff on our honey--" Steve covered his mouth and said no more, hiding his grin from Clint's prying face.
"Schmidt. I know that name." Tony strode forward, hand outstretched. "Tony Stark, CEO of Stark Industries," he introduced, "A pleasure."
A voice without a body? Peculiar. But it helped watch over Tony and keep him safe, Steve hoped. This helped the blond relax more from the initial defensiveness, giving Tony a small smile.
"Babies are messy..." Peter murmured, staying snuggled up to Tony as Steve walked over and petted the boy's hair.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Steve glanced back at Tony to see the man trying to hide nervousness before turning back towards the woman he presumed to be Ms. Potts. He straightened his posture and gave the woman a respectful nod in greeting.
Tony looked up at Steve fondly and drew him into a lazy kiss, gently licking at the seam of his lips.
"You make me very eager when you start talking about it. So yes, very eager." Steve huffed, fingers fumbling as he worked to unbutton his shirt. "Sorry for the roughness so early in the game."
"You's can't color yets Sammy," Peter told the baby matter-of-factly, scooting up to Steve's side, "You's can't use my cwayons."
Tony grinned, carefully removing one of the slats on Bucky's arm to straighten it before replacing it, flicking his welder on.
Satisfied, Tony smacked the crop against the top of Steve's ass, immediately leaning down to kiss the blooming red.
"I know you are, sweetheart," he murmured, "But I also know you love that boy. I don't ever want to hear that you've been having sex with him on campus again, understand?"
He could feel his body weakening. Age was finally catching up and moving him towards the end of the line, he knew. Steve knew it wouldn't be much longer, but he had some things to do before he could let his body give in.
"I'm gonna go work," he said over his shoulder as he escaped the room, deciding to hide in his work.
"Oh, do you?" Steve said with a smirk, leaning with the smooches. "That's a two-way street, y'know. You just might wear yourself down before we hit my limit."
Tony laughed, leaning over to smooch Steve's forehead. "I don't mind if they're the end of us," he mumbled, trying to put on a brave face, "It's worth it. They're worth it."
"I know you do, baby, but you shouldn't run around nakey anyway, even if it’s just Papa and I," Tony chuckled, scooping Pete up and setting him on his hip to take him downstairs.
The blond thought for a moment, his stomach deciding to answer instead with a loud growl. Steve gave a bashful grin, placing a hand over his stomach.
"Take care of that kid. Lord knows I've spent enough years protecting him from Howard," he murmured, "He's a good kid, Steve."
"Kissing me more ain't gonna make me believe it anytime soon," Tony murmured, bumping their noses together, "You know that, right?"
"Okay." Steve said simply. "I was just teasing. But if it...affects you like that, then I won't say it." He smiled softly, kissing Tony's hand quickly. "Promise."
"Didn't know I wasn't allowed." Steve breathed, eyeing Tony carefully before moving to pull the man into a deep, wet kiss.
Tony laughed softly at his lover's cries, slamming their hips together until he felt Steve tighten under him.
"What applies under good, exactly?" He asked with a curious undertone to his voice, remembering not to look back.
"Don't make me look silly, Daddy! What would Auntie Peppah think?" Peter giggled, closing his eyes tight as his head was tilted back at the water.
"You know how I feel about the ice, Tony." Steve pouted, wobbling as he followed Tony along towards the shower. "Well, we had fun while we could."
He let Steve adjust before slipping in a second one, leaning down to kiss his neck and scissor him open.
be here anymore," Tony shouted back, angrily rifling through his drawer till he got his hand up into the back, feeling for the little latch that released his blade. He drew it out with a steady hand, shucking his sweats to his knees before sitting on the edge of the tub.
"I'd like to see you in some sometime." Steve hummed, stretching his neck out a bit more when Tony nibbled. "I'm curious as in who wears it better?" He purred.
"Fair. This school does allow the occasional physical punishment in the form of a spanking," he explained, "It would be over fairly quickly, your slate would be wiped and we'll go back to our normal routine."
"I don' feel unlubbed," he whispered, rubbing his nose into Steve's shirt, "I jus'-- I don' wanna be left b'hind when y'bring Sammy home t'morrow--"
"I didn't mean to bruise you." Steve said, truly apologetic, "I actually was trying to rub to make you feel better, not to bruise you."
"Hey kiddo, you're startin' to repeat stuff, hm?" Tony smiled, brushing the boy's fine hairs aside, "You understand things?"
Their vacation came and went at a reasonable pace, getting in as much needed 'alone time' and relaxation. Most of the time was spent going at it like rabbits, but hey, it was relaxing to them.
“We come bearing gifts!” Tony announced, and Natacha wrinkled her nose as he Péter and Ian trudged up beside her, bringing with them winters chill, and dumped their burlap sacks full of pine cones, twigs, and crystallized knobs of sap on the table beside her.
She was very good at keeping her thoughts to herself so no one noticed how bad she felt, not even Péter.
He couldn’t help but be suspicious. The woman was clearly nervous and wanting to leave the shop as quickly as possible. She was also wearing a shawl much too thick for late summer.
“Does he know you’re twelve?” Bucky growled, and there was something so nice about it she had to bite her lip and look away as he continued to rant.
"I can’t. It’s not that I don’t want to it’s -" Natacha began, her brow furrowing in what would have been a glower if she weren't trying so obviously to remain polite. And that was the kick of it all really. Natacha was trying very hard to be a woman, and bluntness was not in fashion, was it?
He swung the door open, only for young James to come falling in. The boy landed with a squall, looking very affronted at the floor. He looked up, face heated with temper and embarrassment for a moment before his eyes met Tony and froze. His face contorted for a moment and then he was scrambling up off the floor and hurling himself against Tony. Tony staggered back as the unexpected weight unbalanced him, and he narrowly missed being trampled by Artur and Maria as they came hurtling in only a few beats behind. Both were out of breath, red faced and babbling their voices ringing in Tony’s ears but he could not have cared less.
But Tony could tell by Stefen’s expression even as he asked it that it wasn’t the case. Stefen still refused to desert the army, desert Austria, when he still felt he could save it somehow.
Tony watched Natacha leave with Artur and Maria, loath to let the trio out of his sight and staunchly ignoring the irrational urge to get up and follow them. He was irrationally grateful when Bucky ‘s impatient pacing drifted toward the door of the hall. He stopped and leaned against the doorframe with a sigh, head angled in such a way that Tony knew he could keep an eye and an ear on the hall.
He’d walked that line himself not long ago. He was still walking it in truth, but he could not say he found acceptance as easy as he once had. How could he, when the want of something was opening up inside him begging for fulfillment?
“I know who she is," Willamina had grumbled in reply and noticing Tony she'd muttered under her breath, "I never liked the woman myself. Terrible snob."
He felt a small smile forming as he leaned toward her, making a show of looming as he crossed his arms imperiously and waited.
But he hadn’t done that. Couldn’t, Steve thought, his chest burning, because he’d failed Tony and the children and they’d all been busy fighting for their lives.
“When we get there-” Tony whipped around to find Bucky looking at him, his shoulders hunched near his ears.
“Well you see, I’m not alone. My brother Péter is here with his group.” Natacha interrupted his silly braying with an apologetic smile.
It was far past time they got another of their electives underway and Tony thought that a little engineering lesson wouldn’t go amiss what with the puppets and boats in their future, but to get the right materials he’d need to go into town and since Hammer had already made it clear Tony wasn’t to use up Harold’s time with ‘frivolous nonsense’ he supposed he was going to have to hike it. Town wasn’t far by automobile but it was too far otherwise not to make a day of it. For that he’d have to take the children with; which in turn meant they were going on an outing. Tony had grand plans for the bikes he’d seen in the garage gathering dust (and for the ride along seat they were going to have to make for Sara) and by god they were going to have some clothes they were free to ruin if it killed him!
“You saw what they did!” Steve snapped, taking a lunging step forward when Tony would not let go. His face was close enough for Steve to see the lines of tension around his mouth, the steely determination that had replaced the fear that Steve couldn’t shake from his memory. He remembered the way Tony’s eyes had looked on the stairwell of that apartment, flinching away from every sound (flinching away from
Please, Stefen, please… he thought in a jumble, but all that came out of his mouth was a mess of hitched gasps as his fingers clawed at the man’s back.
Steve swallowed thickly, thinking that he’d blown himself wide open and made a fool of himself, but Tony hadn’t left him. He laid down beside Steve and wiped away the tears and mess, told Steve he’d been wonderful. Called him love.
He felt Stark's smug grin from across the table but he looked up to confirm it anyway and grit his teeth, remembering what Natacha had told him about Tony encouraging them to question their authorities.
Wake up Stark. Look at the data, that voice scolded darkly in his pounding head. There he sat in the room Stefen had given him, among the tools and furnishings that the captain had paid for! Oh, and not just mere trinkets like the ones Charlotte wore. Stefen had let him transform this old room beyond recognition, Tony thought as he curled his fingers against the cool concrete. Even if Charlotte booted him out the door tomorrow, this house would always bear the marks of Tony Stark having been there because Stefen had wanted it that way.
Young Cameron was probably the one to thank for that, Tony noted as he entered the room the younger boys shared to find the hall boy assisting James with his trunks while Ian supervised Artur.
Still, Tony could understand the public’s propensity to propel man into myth. Eighteen, nearly eighty pounds soaking wet, and so small you could step on him the skinny recruit that no officer in less desperate times would have handed a gun let alone stamped for approval, had saved the lives of his battalion and that of his commanding officer Oberst Philips. A David facing off against the Goliath of the Italian forces; proof of the superiority and strength of good German blood.
? Steve hurled himself over the girl. When he looked back up a man, boy really, had run up and was grabbing the girls shoulder.
Bucky's fingers stilled on the table top, raised and curled like a finger to a trigger, his face pale.
Wordlessly Steve grabbed the open kit and knelt down with it in hand. He knew he was pushing his luck, knelt practically between his legs, but Tony had invited him in and Steve wasn’t above taking advantage of the opening. It was an incredibly intimate position, but for the first time the proximity didn’t inspire the ever-present hum of want beneath Steve’s skin.
Ian stirred back to life and tugged on his father’s arm, insisting with more than a hint of petulance. “I already know how to swim Father.”
“It would have been remise not to ask, but I am certain of the validity of the Generals letter from Mr. Frank. It troubles me that Germany intends to march upon Poland and use such cowardly methods of subterfuge to defend their actions.” Thor’s meaty fists tightened at his sides like he wanted to hit something.
aryan sensibilities. Bucky caught her eye just as she was finishing up her goodbyes and begging off joining a would-be beau in the parlor room. He raised his glass to her in a silent farewell. She’d be followed no doubt, but that was the plan and Jann was very good at taking care of herself.
Steve’s whole body went cold. There was an intense pressure on his wrist. He looked down and realized detachedly that his hands were clenched into fists, the nails biting into his palms, and that Tony was holding him with a vise like grip.
A chill went up Steve’s spine and he shivered. Being soldiers, they had all at the very least heard whispers of proposed solutions to the Jewish Problem. Steve wasn’t a fool and certainly not a misinformed one. The reports coming out of Dachau were all the same. Torture. Starvation. Strange experimentation. Prisoners were dropping like flies. They had to get Lukas and Dr. Leshnerr out of there soon.
“And don’t think I haven’t noticed this Herr Stark business. I told you to call me Tony or Antony if you have to. I knew a Herr Stark and he was beastly.” Péter laughed again full bodied and wiped the last remnants of wetness away from his eyes.
No. It didn’t matter what Tony would do. He wasn’t there, and if Steve didn’t take control of himself soon he would be carted away to a sanitarium, stripped of everything he’d ever worked for, every bit of it earned with his blood. His children would be left defenseless all because Steve couldn’t keep his head in order for a few weeks on his own.
“You steal from the Nazis. You don’t see me having a conniption about it. Relax Captain. They let me look at the file, which was their first mistake.” Tony tapped the side of his skull and shrugged with a smug smirk. “Strong memory.”
Steve was gearing up to remind him why it mattered to him that his children had the opportunities they’d never had growing up when Bucky reappeared holding his letter in front of him with such a subdued expression that the thought fled Steve’s mind.
They were led inside to wait in the hall, and Steve tried not to think about the water they were dripping on the polished floors. The rabbi when he came, greeted Luzzato by name and the two men hugged like brothers. He had warm smiles for their companions. His eyes filled with concern when he spotted the injured man hanging off Steve’s shoulder and he called something in Hebrew down the hall, where two others appeared a moment later to come help relieve Steve of the burden and disappear with him inside. The rabbi motioned for Ester and the others to follow the pair, but frowned at Steve and his family as Tony and the others drew up close to his side. As Luzzato took the rabbi aside, presumably to explain their presence, Steve put his arm around Ian’s shoulder and waited.
But he needed the proof first, and how it burned to know that it was right there. A picture was all it would take.
The children continued their lessons as well as their mandatory hours in the German Youth programs and Tony’s evenings were split between trying to set a plan for the future, and doing his very best to arrange a path for that future to involve the eight people he was very certain he did not wish to live without. That included coming up with creative ways to combat the toxic waste they were ingesting every weekday afternoon at their programs, so needless to say, time seemed to fly by until thoughts of the strange pair of twins who had landed on their doorstep had all but faded.
Stark!” Nik demanded in harsh reply. “Think about your future. It will be very short, I guarantee, unless you step very carefully. You need to stay out of sight and slip out of the country the first opportunity you get or the reality is you will eventually be caught. Do you understand what I’m telling you?”
They’d been sitting in the silence and dark for quite some time, just breathing and thinking about what they’d just done, so that when the radio crackled to life with a burst of unexpected static they both jumped in shock. Tony’s heart was thudding so loudly within his ears he barely caught the first few words of the transmission.
Steve continued to try and struggle his way out of the crate only to have Magda shove him back. A frustrated snarl ripped passed Steve’s lips as she shoved him back, again, and held him down. She was a head shorter than him, healthy, strong, and desperate to stop him. But she wasn’t Steve, she wasn’t desperate to save her children. She couldn’t stop him. Nobody could stop him.
“Don’t tell me you drank all the coffee?” Stark called out as he entered the kitchen with Péter, startling Bucky out of his internal panic. Everything was fine. Stark was swooping in and sucking all of the air out of the room, flirting indecently with Stefen like no one had eyes or ears, as usual. He must have heard Stark’s pocket change. He wasn’t going crazy again. Bucky had people to look out for and Stefen had enough crazy spilling out the cracks in his head for both of them.
He thought back to the moment he’d first seen Stark. Something in him had snapped tight at the sight of the monk at Peggy’s piano. He hadn't had the energy to do much but order him out, though he’d spoken with more force than he’d intended, judging by that flicker of fear he’d seen on Stark's face before the strange monk had covered it with senseless prattle and a confident smile.
When Stefen’s eyes met his once more they were guarded but held a familiar gleam of challenge and Tony chuckled.
What was inside that box made Bucky’s throat go dry, his thoughts grinding to a halt. Laying artfully against the dark velvet interior was a necklace. Its chain was beaded with coral, an unusual red so dark it was almost ruby. It was ornamented with an even row of flat gold coins, polished until they sparkled in the sun streaming through the window of the shop. They were true gold, Bucky could tell without having to test them, because he’d seen those coins before.
Tony heard the sound of someone spitting violently and turned. He saw Péter hesitate, saw the war going on in his eyes and the long horrible moment of consideration that held him back even as Tony and his siblings fled.
Tony answered, Stefen nodding in that distracted way that told him Stefen was already three steps into a plan and hardly hearing him.
“The bullet went through, I think. Did my best to keep it clean.” She recounted, struggling for breath as Bucky examined the open wound. It was clear, no fragments from the bullet.
Though it certainly didn’t make his job easier Tony could see the boy’s point. Fourteen was too old to be taught at home and he was sure that Péter would have rather enjoyed being at a public school with other boys and girls his age than coddled and cooped up at home, heart condition or no.
Turning the knob and pushing into the little back bedroom he expected to find an empty room, or Péter there with no sign of his sister, the confirmation of his worst fears. Instead he found the peculiar sight of Natacha crouched beneath the window in a coat two sizes too big, wind chaffed and hair falling out of its plait. Péter loomed over her with his hands fisted in her coat like he was about to shake her. The window was open behind them, a muddy scuff on the sill telling tales along with the horrified expression that flashed over Péter’s face.
When the countess had stormed from the room and then the house like a cold wind, Hammer and Julia scattered. Charlotte had followed more sedately after, not quite able to hide the surprise or the flash of vulnerability in her eyes when she discovered him within hearing distance. But she nodded regally and continued on her way, pausing for a moment to glance in the hall mirror. Tony had watched her tidying her appearance, her armor, with new grudging respect.
“Vati!” Artur extracted himself from Tony’s arms so fast he all but trampled Maria to do it. She could not seem to decide if she wanted Tony or her father yet. She clutched at Tony with her cold mittens, eyes wide and overwhelmed as she simply stared at her father and her brothers as if they might all just be part of a mirage. Tony scooped her up and pressed a kiss to one wet cheek.
Steve held his gaze silent and still, then turned and stepped out through the door without a backward glance.
Natacha blinked slowly, allowing the tears to sting her eyes again. If she couldn’t stop them, she may as well use them. Crying girls made men look the other way.
’ even listening with half an ear. Instead he watched Tony’s back, keeping his eyes and ears open for danger.
“We should go. Tonight. Fuck, we shoulda gone ages ago,” Bucky cursed, pacing the floor after Coulson had been shown out.
"He was sick all over the washroom." Harold grunted as they dropped Steve's heavy weight into the space where Virginia had pulled back the covers, and the woman was smart to immediately rest both palms against Steve's shoulders and push him downwards, as he immediately tried to raise himself back up again.
“There's always gonna be a war. You don't always gotta be in the middle of it.” The coffee sloshed as he picked up the cup to take another sip, droplets over spilling the porcelain rim. “Ever since we were kids” he finished with a slurp and a mutter.
The crowds had followed them from city to city, as word spread from the festival of the famous hero with the seven singing children with voices like angels. Even these gadje could see that they were
"Well Spider, what do you think?" She'd asked. "Are you ready for action, or do you want to go back to your day dreams?"
Poland.” Tony instructed helpfully. Aleksy opened her mouth to try again, when Tony heard a distinctive and biting voice mutter in crisp French, “Idiot. If you can’t learn you should give up now and don’t waste anyone’s time. “
It was exactly the wrong thing to do though because Bucky’s eyes snapped to him as soon as he moved and Tony knew in an instant what would happen. If Bucky was a cornered dog, then he was about to bite.
Tony taught them an old school rhyme he’d been taught as a boy, making a game of it at first of who could be the loudest and follow him as closely as he pranced about the hill top, until there was no more thought of laws against music or their father’s disapproval.
He doesn’t waste anytime opening the door to his room and ushering Tony inside. It gives Tony no time to get nervous or insecure because before he can consciously realize it he is inside Steve’s room and taking a seat on the very edge of his bed.
He could start it, he supposes, but there’s also something in him that doesn’t want to have to do that. Maybe it’s an echo of the pride he used to wear like an armor for years, or the desire to feel as needed as he has needed Steve. Be what it may, Tony doesn’t take the leap and the conversation fades before it could even be began.
“Yeah, should have thought about that,” Bruce apologizes. “But I— I guess first I wanted to know if it really was something worth celebrating.”
The man eyes the coffee pot from his place and is trying to will his body into moving towards it when Natasha says,
From his vantage point from above Tony Steve offers him his hand so he can get to his feet. Tony stares at it for half a second before caving and grabbing a hold of it, Steve taking most of the brunt of his weight and pulling him up. The move leaves Tony only an inch or so away from Steve, their hands still together and their chests almost but not quite touching.
He finds himself unable to tear his eyes away from his and Tony’s hand, looking so normal as they rest on the table between the two of them. It’s not the first time Tony has grabbed Steve’s hand and held on to it for a long period of time. Steve has learned since Tony’s comeback just how touchy and affectionate he can be. But it is the first time Tony has done it in front of other people and Steve’s brain is already giving the action a thousand possible meanings.
Bruce’s voice is nothing more than a whisper now and he starts shaking his head gently while he runs his hands through his dark hair.
“That doesn’t mean I don’t spend hours and hours everyday thinking of what we could have done differently. What if I had listened to you? What if we had all fought together? What if Carol had been there with us? What if… Just so many what ifs.”
The times that are the worst, though, are the times when he catches a quick glance of Steve through a window, or their paths nearly cross walking different directions in a hallway, or he encounters various things that remind him that Steve is here and yet he’s not here with Tony at all.
Nebula’s face subtly lights up and Tony’s surprised to recognize and understand the expression instantly.
“God, I missed you too,” Tony replies, and then he reattaches his lips to Steve’s after taking a deep breath.
As soon as the screen turns off and Steve can no longer see light coming from it, he puts his phone back into his pocket.
Tony shakes his head and he also finishes his drink so he can focus all of his attention on Steve. He moves the mug to the side and Steve promptly imitates him. This leaves them both one in front of the other, nothing but the table between us.
In those days, it’s cooking together and bantering, creating sweet dishes that will serve to soothe Steve’s sweet tooth and salty treats that will fill Steve’s grand appetite.
The impact must have been harder than Tony anticipated because Steve lets out a light grunt as Tony’s body meets his own but he doesn’t hesitate to put his arms around him and support him.
“I have to go to SHIELD now,” Steve states. “But I’ll be back for lunch. I know Rhodey’s still here and maybe… We could have lunch. You, me, Pepper and Rhodey. Together. I could apologize to them too for these past few weeks.”
“How can I make it better for Clint when his whole family is gone? And I don’t even know where I’m supposed to start with Thor… Thor, who I would have sworn was unbeatable.”
He feels hot and clammy as if his whole body was submerged in lava. He tries to take off his jacket but his limbs won’t cooperate. They move too slowly, too clumsily, his commands foreign to his every nerve and muscle.
U is the one who reaches him first and Steve immediately feels the corners of his lips tugging up as he pats U’s robot arm. Dummy and Butterfingers are only a second behind and they surround him and start pulling at the waist of his uniform even though there isn’t much give to the fabric.
Tony continues on as if he hadn’t heard Steve’s comment, “And I’m sorry for how much that must have sucked. I know it was wrong but I needed some time to figure some things out.”
“Do you have time to have dinner with me?” Tony asks, pretty sure already of what the answer will be.
Tony stands up and Natasha motions for him to start walking in front of her. Exiting the kitchen, he starts making his way down the hallway leading them to the elevator when he hears a very distinctive giggle coming from behind him. When he turns around, Natasha’s lips are pressed tightly together but her face is slightly red from what Tony can tell is amusement.
Tony decides to turn his body to try and get a glimpse behind him when just turning his head does nothing to help. He moves very slowly and carefully, first turning his waist and then getting his legs to follow. Finally he rotates his shoulders to rest his weight on the left one instead of on the right. When he stops moving he finds himself in the exact same position he was in before only this time facing in the opposite direction.
Steve meets Stark’s best friends during his funeral, the one they are holding more for the public that for Stark’s real loved ones.
Steve chuckles and Tony knows he too keeps updated on things like that, even if not with the upmost intensity that Tony does.
“If I’m going to be completely honest I can understand how it happened,” Tony confesses. “When I came back… You don’t know the way Pepper and Rhodey were talking about you. You helped them both a lot, you know? You shared their grief even when you weren’t necessarily grieving me and you were the example they needed that they could get through it all.”
Pepper takes him as her date to a Maria Stark Foundation gala and she walks him arm in arm around the room for the whole night. They chat with various politicians and shake more hands that Steve can count and sip from their champagne flutes as they watch various people take the stage and accept their awards.
And then, as if the universe feels like it owes him something, he feels a pair of familiar arms wrap around his waist and a chest press into his back, seeping warmth into his skin.
Oxygen is running out and neither Nebula nor Tony know if they’re going to be waking up tomorrow or if their bodies will finally give up on them, but Tony still bids Nebula good night as he’s done for the past three weeks.
It’s not true and Tony absolutely knows that but something in him still feels afraid about it, something in him is still postponing the moment of truth.
Biting her bottom lip, she pulls her hand away and sets both of her hands on her lap. She’s sitting rigidly on her chair and while they’re not more than 10 inches apart it feels like thousands of miles are separating them.
He stands up, forcing Tony back a little bit so they don’t collision as Steve moves. In just a few seconds Steve’s face has transformed and there’s something familiar about his look but also something completely novel. This is Steve’s
Tony feels somewhat more relaxed hearing the hesitation in Steve’s voice towards the topic but it’s still a big and scary step to take so he inhales deeply before nodding his assent. With one of his hands he makes a vague gesture giving Steve the go ahead to be the first one to talk.
He smiles and says he’s fine. He turns back the conversation on Tony. He abruptly gets up and almost slaps his forehead in feigned realization at having forgotten this or that thing he should be doing.
Tony thinks he maybe will take him up on that offer. He also thinks he will be making it back to Steve sometime soon.
Tony extends his arms, reaching out towards Steve and beaconing him closer so he can touch him. Steve reads Tony’s silent plea and he scoots closer towards him, resting his hands on either side of Tony’s face, holding himself over Tony’s body. Finally, Tony’s hands make contact with Steve’s chest and the smooth, unblemished skin there. Steve’s so soft, his skin feeling like heaven under Tony’s fingertips. He’s warm to the touch and he gets warmer as Tony’s hands explore his upper body.
Steve is standing in front of the sofa where Tony’s seated and it looks like he must just have come through the door. He’s wearing his thick, leather jacket and its shoulders look a little damp due to the light drizzling that has been going on outside for most of the day.
“I just…,” Steve starts saying, his eyes looking up to the ceiling. “There’s so many things I want to say, so many things I want to talk about… With you. I want to talk about them with you but…”
And now, he gets to live his life and share his bed with a man. A man he loves. A man that -hopefully, maybe, one day- he will be able to marry.
“It wasn’t really the partying,” Steve explains, looking a little more alert. He runs his hand through his hair, making it spike up funnily and awkwardly until he fixes it with the fingers of his other hand. “Well, it was, but only in a way.”
Other times their being together is the product of carefully organized planning: shared dinners when their schedules -mostly Natasha’s, Bruce’s and Steve’s- allow it, movie nights where none of them pay much attention to the actual movie,…
In all of his avoidance of the issue, the overthinking, all the confusion and the self-doubt Steve has definitely made a lot of mistakes, all of them unwillingly and without malice.
They only take a couple of steps each before they find the other blocking their path. The hallways in the Tower aren’t narrow but it feels like they’re trapping Steve at the moment, so close to Tony their chests are touching.
Not all the remaining Avengers have come for remembrance to DC today. Natasha, Bruce, Rhodey and Tony stand behind Steve in a gesture of unconditional support. Clint never responded when Natasha knocked on his door before they all had to leave the Compound in the jet. Thor still isn't replying to any of Bruce’s messages and calls.
Tony calls him a couple more times and even has JARVIS tell Steve he wants to meet with him but Steve always leaves the Tower when this happens. He even ponders if it would be easier if he went to stay at SHIELD’s base for a while, knowing Fury would give him back his all quarters no questions asked. He discards the idea quickly, realizing the one thing he can’t give up is the place that has become the closest thing he’s had to a home in years. It would be a fatal blow to his sanity.
It surprises Tony when he realizes he’s drifted in and out of consciousness a couple of times. He doesn’t fully fall asleep but he loses time and his train of thought enough that he’s not aware of when Steve wakes up.
Tony stands swiftly, leaving his projects behind and following Natasha as she cuts a path towards Bruce’s room.
Now it’s Tony’s turn to look at Steve defiantly and with one of his eyebrows raised. “You don’t need to rub it in, you know?”
He’s already out of the room and stepping into the hallway that leads to his room when Steve calls out to him.
There’s not a place where their bodies -from shoulders to thighs- aren’t touching and even though Tony is obviously the weaker one in this situation and he can barely stand on his own, he’s not entirely sure the tremors quaking his body are his own.
Steve turns his waist so his torso and his head face the direction of the sound. His eyes find Tony’s rapidly and even from this distance Tony can make out Steve’s Adam’s apple bobbing as he swallows harshly.
“That’s my business card and you’ve got my cell number in there,” she informs him. “I would love to meet to speak more in a different setting.”
Fear has always made Tony bolder, more prone to spectacle to cover up his vulnerabilities in front of other people, but this time fear is making him silent, because everything where Steve is concerned has a way of surprising Tony like that.
“Look, you don’t have to interact with me in order to be friends with them,” Tony explains. “I don’t want you to cut ties with them just because I’m suddenly and magically back.”
Tony opens the door and nearly has his feet run over by DUM-E’s wheels in his excitement. Steve chuckles slightly from his place with the other bots when Tony stumbles a little trying to avoid bumping into DUM-E.
Tony doesn’t feel quite ready to step back into SI work yet but involving himself in the organization his mother started makes him feel a little more at peace, a little more grounded.
“No, Tony,” he answers slowly, making Tony feel like he’s being mocked or treated as if he was an unruly child. “It’s not about that.”
“So,” Steve whispers, his lips so close to Tony’s that every word is practically traced with his tongue over them. “I feel like I’m going to have a lot of fun with this new revelation and now that you’ve pointed it out, I can finally realize how much I love you in my clothes.”
Pepper’s arms wrap around his waist and Tony brings one of his hands up to her long hair, burying his fingers deep in it, feeling the smooth strands with his fingertips.
“We can call the restaurant for take-out and in the time it will take to get here it’ll almost be lunch time,” Tony explains.
Natasha follows his permission and walks into the room, directly walking to the bed’s right side and looking down at him.
The color is different from the redness that had been there before from the crying. This time it’s a little more subtle, more pink than red, it looks softer on Steve’s features. Tony prefers this color a lot better than the one before.
Steve and Tony are sitting in the Avengers’ common living room, no one else from the team around, as reruns of Friends play on TV but they are not really paying attention. They’re positioned so Tony’s back is to Steve’s broad chest and the blond has been thumbing the hem of Tony’s t-shirt for the past 10 minutes. Tony’s t-shirt that is
“All I know is that I feel like I’ve left him alone when he needs me most. Valkyrie says he has completely isolated himself, only letting Korg in when he needs him to bring him things. We’re all going through this, but at least we’re going through this together.”
FRIDAY wakes Tony up really early in the morning or really late at night, depending on how you look at it.
So he lets the moment pass them by as he has done with other moments before too and he pretends he isn't dying to read deeper into Steve’s gaze to know how he feels about it.
They get Carol to point them in the direction of specific people, be them from Earth or not, that are still around and could help them even just a little bit.
Tony takes a couple of steps forward and brings himself closer to the glass walls but he makes no move to enter the room yet. He doesn't want to stay outside much longer while Steve is unaware of his presence because that seems like prying on a very private moment but he wants to make sure that he doesn't take Steve completely by surprise and unsettles him.
Steve starts moving towards the couch, a little hesitantly, Tony notices. He sits down very close to to the left armrest, leaving ample space between his body and Tony’s. It feels cold and wrong to Tony but he doesn’t push the issue and he remains seated where he is.
He moves to bring his lips closer to Tony’s again but Tony puts his index finger on them, smooshing them a little.
The event is the biggest Tony has ever participated in and that’s saying something. It’s still the most silent he has ever heard the Washington DC streets being.
Tony bunches up the sleeves and pushes them up his forearms before he realizes he’ll have to wear the coat too and pushes them down again.
She delicately puts her hand on top of the one Tony still has on the table. Tony looks down at them and then looks up at her face. She looks concerned, her forehead not quite set in a frown but still carrying tension. Tony moves his other hand away from his chest and tries to smile reassuringly at her.
was a different person, Tony would be able to ignore the situation and pretend to be asleep until it truly became a reality, but they’re Steve and Tony, even after all this time apart, so that means there’s no other option for him but to open his eyes.
“Things seem easy for a while and then something -anything- happens and we’re reminded that nothing is easy anymore.” Steve’s speech has no clear beginning or order but Tony parses through it easily enough and understands each of its nuisances and meanings. “I’m slowly coming to terms with the fact that I couldn't help the people that are gone but it’s so much more difficult when I feel like I can’t help the people that are still here.”
“That’s so sweet,” she tells him. “I can just imagine all the little kids dressing up as Captain America even then.”
He’s been quietly drawing for a while now, tapping along to the music that’s playing from the speakers with one of his feet. The playlist Tony has decided on today is slower and more melodic that his usual choices; a mix of English, Italian and French ballads that Steve finds himself humming along to.
“I’m sorry if that was inappropriate and if I overstepped but I just… I just…” Steve takes a deep breathe and opens his eyes, focusing his gaze somewhere over Tony’s shoulder. “I want to help. I want to help you, Tony. And I want us to be okay. I know that’s an utopia because this is not something we can just be okay with but we deserve to at least not feel this bad.”
A bead of pre-come runs down the size of Steve’s dick and reaches his hand. The touch is drier than what Steve generally prefers so he moves his hand away from his dick and brings it over to his mouth. He quickly gets his palm wet, running his tongue precisely through it, and one by one he  puts his fingers inside his mouth, wetting them as well.
“But you’ve been avoiding me,” Tony says and this is an statement so sure of itself that Steve knows he can’t deny it any longer.
“He’s drinking. A lot,” Bruce elaborates. “I got him to let me into the place he’s been living in so I could stay with him but… He must have said five words total in the time I was there. I could tell he was angry I was visiting but he just… He didn’t say anything. He hasn’t been showering, he hasn’t been outside in weeks. He just drinks and eats and sleeps.”
He’s just sitting down, not even a minute having gone by since he sent the selfie, when Tony sends back his response, two texts, one right after the other.
“The second is that relationships either end or they are forever,” Steve notes. “There is no in-between. You either die with someone or you die without them.”
When he opens his eyes the blue of them seems almost multiplied, like all the tears he cried cleaned away a layer of dust that had been accumulating there for months.
They stay in silence a couple of minutes, Steve obviously waiting for Tony to say something -most likely something incendiary- and Tony refusing to speak.
Tony doesn’t move for a few minutes, even if the position has to be killing his back, until his stomach rumbles.
“That actually sounds like a perfect plan,” Steve agrees making Tony’s face break into a small and soft smile.
Tony brings his hands to his face, covering it completely with his palms. He tries to regulate his breathing by exhaling and inhaling deeply through his mouth. Getting over nightmares will never be easy but Tony’s had enough practice by now to know the things that work better for him.
His attention is not set on the warmth or the cold or the dampness or the dryness of the air, anyway. His attention is nowhere and everywhere all at once.
“From what I can tell, that was already your third cup of coffee.” Damn spies and their spy-senses. “You’re not going to have a fourth one, Tony. Go to bed before Steve has to drag you himself.”
“She’s always needed me to be someone else. Or well, not that. But she’s definitely needed me to change certain aspects of myself. She wanted me to be more reliable and less reckless. She needed to know I would be content with stepping aside and prioritizing us over… Well, the world. And I couldn’t do that even though she deserved it. Just like she couldn't become less strict or demanding just because I needed her to.”
This time Dobas couldn't miss the ice in his voice but the problem was Kurt had never been good at guessing when his charm had run out.
He pressed his lips together, frustration pooling in his stomach. There was no way to prove to her that Stefen was a good man other than the fact he hadn't called the gestapo on him with all the many chances that Tony had provided. He could only imagine what she must be thinking. She only knew Stefen as a German officer, and nowadays a German officer was a like the siting of a crow. An omen, a bringer of death.
Bucky spit into the snow. He watched the warm saliva disappear into the mound and looked back up at the old farmhouse standing atop the hill. It already seemed to have a desolate air about it, as if the house had been changed by all that it had witnessed.
Péter said his father preferred to be alone. That was if the captain was even having a nightmare! For all Tony knew he was having strange sex with one of the maids.
It was not that he thought Stefen would willingly choose to betray him.  But the harsh reality was that Stefen had a family to protect and if pressured, Tony would want him to do what was necessary to protect the children. He wouldn’t fault the man if it came to that, but logic said Tony could prevent the issue altogether by just keeping silent.
“Stark!” he called again, when he’d reach the closed door. He paused only to confirm the muffled sound of an engines roar behind it, before he hammered his fist against the metal, calling, “Tony!”
“Yes, Damn! We’re meant to fade in two more platoons by the end of…” Dvořák sputtered, overwhelmed by the unexpected turn of events.
" A dark voice growled behind them and Péter jumped. He hadn't heard Pietro walk up to them, but he was towering over them now, his hands crossed across his chest, looking as if he was considering shoving Péter into the water and trying to strangle him.
"Would you care to walk with me? In the garden," Steve added as if Tony couldn't have assumed that on his own, and Tony was halfway tempted to tell him no, just to see that flustered blush of his once more, but with Stefen it was just as likely to aggravate and send him on the defensive.
“Before you even say it, you can’t lock him up.” Tony drawled and Steve glared at him. Tony continued, “He’s nearly fifteen Stefen. Older than you were when you went to war. Did anyone ordering you not to go stop you?”
“I wouldn’t change it Stefen, but there was much I did in my search to find acceptance, far before I was truly ready for it. I’m not without bruises. I would have that different for you. Very different.”
“You can’t keep turning them away.” Charlotte said, but Father sneered over her, disgust dripping from every word.
He finished his food and was loading his bowl with more when Stark interjected into the silence once more.
“Be careful out there. I’m not there to pull you out of trouble if you don’t watch your back.” Steve warned, mindful of Agent Coulson's warning of the phone lines being monitored. They wanted Striker’s men to focus their energy on watching Bucky and the other decoys, but it didn’t sit well letting Bucky stride into danger even if he’d volunteered for it.
Tony’s huff of laughter was watery but he nodded slowly in agreement. Good, Steve thought with relief. This was good. Now-
He made light of the fact that none of the books he’d read on the subject had included exact measurements and insisted on testing out each batch on himself. The first round burned his tongue and left him with a horrible stomachache.
He unfolded his napkin and looked out at the children. He was startled to still find eyes on him. It had been so long since he'd seen another face at the opposite end of the table.
“Eleven and determined to be every bit as strong as the fellow he watched carrying trees on his back during
Tony froze up, wanting to tell her that it was over and that everything would be fine now, but he knew better. They all did! Why were they all ignoring the obvious? Hitler would never be satisfied with this small slice of Czechoslovakia. He’d said as much in all his grand speeches about Germans inheriting the earth. What did people think was going to happen here?!
“Forgive me, General Schmidt, but I thought we were going to skip the small talk.” Steve replied, surprised at the neutral quality his tone kept.
"There's only been one clinical trial done, on rats, by an English Doctor during the Great War. I performed a similar trial on rodents at the abbey with Dr. Banner. If there have been human trials in the preceding years I never heard. I wasn't exactly in a position to keep up with it."
“Tony’s recently come from the monastery.” Stefen explained, but it didn’t do much to clear up the confusion of their host or those close enough to hang on their every word.
Time marches on and so does the war abroad. Safe for the moment in Italy, Steve and Tony try to find a way out of Pola which is easier said than done. Some things are okay, Steve is not one of them, but Tony makes like the English, keeping calm and carrying on.
It took only a single ram of his shoulder to bust the lock on the old door, unfortunately giving the old man sat on the pot on the other side a horrible fright as Deiter stumbled inside, nearly falling on top of him. The old man let out an undignified shriek which devolved into irate curses as Deiter hurried to exit, already puffing on his whistle to sound the alarm.
It struck Steve then that she’d only been a baby when Bucky had left for Budapest. She had no real memories of him besides the stories he and her older siblings would tell. A fault, he thought with a cringe, that was as much his own as it was Bucky’s.
He was suddenly without a shadow of a doubt, that this had been the single worst miscalculation of his life. Because there Stefen was standing waist deep, water streaming down face and neck to run over the dips and curves of his chest.
“I can’t take any more tender footing. The Führer doesn't want his failures discussed at the dinner table. Like a woman with fashionable senses. What horse shit!” Göring took a wet gulp of his schnapps, then gestured at Steve, speaking far louder than necessary as he complained about Wehrmacht leaders hiding behind their failures.
"You can't go." She answered. He made a low aggravated sound in his throat and turned away from her sharply. Something hot sliced through her chest like shame and she found herself grabbing at him, face twisting in anger at the unfairness.
Upon first arrival a lieutenant so and so met them in a small envoy of open cars, and drove them to the main building in a cluster of long square buildings doing their best to blend in with the coastline. Inside the base was just as utilitarian, and it wasn’t until they were escorted to an area of meeting rooms clearly set aside for the big brass that things began to get a little more ostentatious. The furnishings were comfortable, and the windows provided a picture-perfect view of the sea and the rest of the base sprawling around it.
“Fine but I want uncle Bucky to help me then!” James declared already pushing his brother away. Ian looked embarrassed. “Ian can help Péter.”
“What’s going on?” Dvorak snapped, and both the woman and the doctor jumped, startled, but then Fischer realized who it was and looked relieved to see him.
"Yes, if you would, Charlotte. I'd like to marry you. If you'll have us." He took a breath, letting the air in his lungs settle him. "I know it's asking a lot. It's not your ideal... well, anything. But I'm asking anyway."
"Oh, I love this one." Charlotte murmured, a wistful gleam in her eye. "It was their mother's favorite. Did you know?" She asked Tony who shook his head, staring thoughtfully at Natacha who had joined hands and was walking together with Maria.
He tried to be quiet as not to disturb her but when his foot left the last stair she looked up. When she saw him standing there at the bottom of the stair her wrinkled face spread into a smile. She lowered her hands to her lap, and Tony saw that it was a little photograph that she held between her palms. It looked wrinkled and bent around the edges, as if it had known frequent use.
And then like someone had flicked a light switch everyone was moving, the room emptying out like a water bucket with holes as the servants paused to give Father their well wishes and then rushed off to see that everything was set for his departure.
He relaxed at the sight of one of the private’s in the squad currently on guard rotation escorting a young boy and two women burdened with baskets likely containing their dinner.
Steve had done his part and gotten his family safely to this point. They had done well for themselves amidst the group of Jews being escorted by the DELESAM to the immigration office in Genoa.
Tony cut her off before she could finish. She must be getting so tired of saying his name  like that, he was certainly getting tired of hearing it.
Ian wouldn’t have to do anything with Gisela Keats, besides race her to the sweets trolley after training and it would all just be fine.
There was water pooling in the front hall, flowing down the steps like a flooded sink over words painted in bold letters over the stone.
What in god’s name had he been playing at? Tony had been in the water teaching the others for at least an hour and James had expressed absolutely no interest in joining them.
“What? You think this fine house and that uniform you wear means nothing? It means you are a Nazi!” Pietro snarled and Péter was sure they would have come to blows until Wanda's hand shot out and gripped his in a death grip. Péter and Pietro both froze, staring at her.
“Father has so many important matters to worry about as an officer. I don’t want him to have to worry about me, or my brothers and sisters so much.” Natacha said. “I am the woman of the house and now that I am better, he needs my support more than ever, so that he can be free to serve the Reichland.”
“Without a sled?” Ian asked, frowning in contemplation and Tony had given him a tired wink before taking up the lead again and trudging along.
He’d been in the garden, playing happily with Maria, whacking bushes with a stick turned rapier singing with the gusto of ten boys.
"Company Leader Hoffman, sir." Zimmerman faltered over the sentence as Rogers stilled, anger written in every line of his stiff back. “About a new propaganda tour, sir?”
It’s strange. Some days I feel as if I am a million years old, and other days I feel younger than I ever have."
Stark was teasing Ian now and every time he moved that sound came again. The soft clink and subtle rattle, like beads sliding together. Like -
"You didn't." Tony countered, not moving from the doorway. He'd let Stefen in when he was good and ready.
"Just breathe." Tony urged him and Stefen complied, breathing in and out in shuttered gasps at first until his breathing slowed, deepening with each breath.
“Alright?” Tony gaped at him, unsure if this was more teasing or if Stefen really had just said that.
"Do I even want to know why you have those?" he squeaked and Farkas gave him a stern look as he placed the folded garments within Tony's arms.
He was on his way to the closets where the maids kept their cleaning supplies when a movement at the corner of his eye caught his attention. He couldn’t say what it was, just a shadow likely, or why a prickle of apprehension went up his spine but Tony got the distinct feeling that something was wrong.
"Come on Stevie, don't tell me you can't make it through two repetitions of ten." Bucky's hand slapped down on the floor in front of his face, commanding Steve's attention and he glared at the offending hand, then up at the smirking face of his best friend, who was sitting cross legged on the floor in front of him, chewing on a licorice stick.
It was damn stupid to admit to anyone how unstable he was. A complaint from Stark to the authorities was all it would take and Stevie would have a one-way trip to the mad house. It had happened to other soldiers who couldn’t hack it after the war ended. Schmidt would probably stamp the damn papers himself.
“You won’t feel pressured?” Tony asked, eyeing the other two men hovering nearby with a skeptical glance.
Had he said thank you? He doubted it. Six days later and he was still barely able to say much of anything, it was exhausting just staying awake for a few hours each day. But slowly he was healing. It was exactly as the woman had said, nobody came for him and though he sometimes heard their voices drifting in from the outside, neither of her parents seemed aware of his presence there. He was alive and he was healing and that was all that mattered. As soon as he was strong enough to brave the elements and venture his way back to his family he’d go.
“What is it? What have you heard?” Stefen, now jacketed to Tony’s satisfaction, barked impatiently at Grig.
"Pepper, my dear, I'm a man of the cloth." Tony placed a hand over his chest in mock offense. "My heart belongs solely to God."
“Steve. You should get used to pronouncing it Steve from now on.” He replied woodenly, getting up without looking in Tony’s direction. He should clean up the glass before one of the children hurt themselves.
Tony was sorely tempted to slide back under the covers and ignore every bit of good sense he had that told him to get moving, but he knew better than to tempt fate any more than they already had.
“Is everything alright Captain?” She asked tentatively, eyes searching between the two of them curiously.
Charlotte folded the letter and placed it within a cream envelope just as her maid Milthede returned with Stefen in tow. His steps were hurried as he entered the room, ignoring her stalwart companion’s disapproving stare as he swept past her. Charlotte smiled to herself, glad for the older woman’s continued loyalty. It wasn’t much, all things considered, but she’d always have that.
Steve waited while Coulson considered his answer. They both knew how he answered would decide a lot.
1. There really was an early conspiracy in the German army to kill Hitler headed by Hans Oster.  Captain America wasn't involved but this is an Avengers AU so of course he'd be knee deep in that mess. ;)
Tony had worn the fine white jacket and matching slacks that had come in one of the many boxes Stefen had delivered, along with a fine eye popping red vest he’d fallen in love with the moment he’d laid eyes on it.
Soberly Tony glanced from one child to the next, being sure to meet each eye as he said, “In light of what you’ve given me the opportunity to learn about myself I’d like, going forward, for this classroom to be a place where you are safe to educate your minds without fear. I’d also like it to be a place where you do not have to fear educating me. In fact, I hope you come to relish it. Now… is there anything at all you’d like to ask?”
The last words had barely escaped Tony’s mouth before Stefen’s hands tightened their hold and drew him into a kiss, his mouth claiming Tony’s with an unbearable sweetness that made the monk shudder from head to toe, a lump of tangled emotions burning behind his rib cage as he brought his hands up to clutch desperately at Stefen.
Bruce’s mouth tilted upward in a familiar half smile, soft, understanding and faintly sad but no less genuine for it and replied, “See you, Tony.”
It was the same one he’d first arrived in and clothing donated to the abbey was notoriously undesirable, this one more than most. This suit looked like it had been coughed out of the belly of the clothes munching monster that inhabited the place where fashion went to die.
Vonkov’s mouth had fallen open in a silent O of astonishment. Tension thrummed tightly throughout Steve’s body as he stared the man down and he saw a hint of fear behind his eyes. The table wasn’t so wide that Steve couldn’t reach him before he was stopped and Vonkov realized it.
It was hard for Tony to concentrate on the children’s lessons that day, or not to worry that he’d not heard anything more about the runner who was supposed to collect tonight’s message. Stefen had said only that he would meet Tony at midnight in the garden, though how Stefen expected a man to sneak into their garden in the dead of night Tony didn’t know.
“Good. There’s going to be a broadcast on that date and time. Will the radio you built be able to pick it up?” Stefen asked and Tony was nodding almost before he was finished speaking.
He was a Jew, and one day he was going to get caught. When he did he’d take her family down with him.
Ian was all seriousness, all innocence and earnestness, as he informed Steve that everyone messed up and did things they weren’t proud of, but it was never too late to do the right thing.
Stefen was just as confused by this as he ought to be but Tony did not drop his gaze, staring intently as he continued.
Staring up at the beautiful display of exploding lights in the sky made him think of Tony’s tower again.  It would be great, he thought, to build a place where everyone really could be the same, where people didn’t worry so much about the things that made them different. In a place like that people would have less room for petty thoughts and more room for the curiosities of the universe. Péter had always thought there was so very much to be curious about but his father had never appreciated curiosity very much.
"We have it so the preselector reduces regenerative signal radiation to the antenna, in addition to increasing sensitivity and selectivity," Tony was explaining with nervous hope as he turned the black dials, static crackling in the headset he'd given Steve to wear.
"I’m glad you made it.” he said just as quietly in return, reaching up to smooth the rumpled shoulder of Tony’s jacket. A painfully banal gesture, but it allowed him to feel Tony’s body without making contact and smell his aunt’s soap while scent and body remained intact. Neither was guaranteed to last any longer than the other, and Steve needed the reassurance of both.
Tony stumbled to a halt the world spinning around him and nearly fell backwards, knocking over Harold, whose arms shot out to catch him.
Tony blinked, taken aback by the order as Bakhuizen heaved, lifting Stefen up and shouldering him towards his bed.
“How does he know it’s them?” She asked, wiping up the splatter with her napkin. Steve stared at her. She sounded tense. Not out of the ordinary given the subject matter, but something about it bothered him.
Bucky didn’t know how the hell she could know that since she’d been with them all evening and even he had lost track of Stefen’s movements, but he didn’t doubt her. But just what the hell was Stefen doing in the damned garden, when they had a rebellion to organize anyway?
A hint of a blush dusted her pretty face and she sipped her drink again, lips parted around the thin glass as she kept her gaze on the crowd. “Now, really, you can say all the pretty things you like but next time there's a waltz, Captain, I expect results.”
He’d thrown up. She wrinkled her nose at the sight of the bile and discolored acid, stark against the lingering snow.
“I thought about that in the beginning… It’s my own fault for not… Tony it’s not that simple anymore. They watch everything. It’s too late for me to send them abroad without suspicion.”
The commotion drew Charlotte and Pepper who appeared in the doorway of the captain’s room and immediately broke into shocked cries of their own; but Tony’s attention had been captured by the hot air pushing against his face as it rushed into the cooler hall. His brain stuck on the startling discovery of Bucky, the housekeeper, and Stefen’s fiancé all gathered within the captain’s room, where a roaring fire filled the fireplace, and the drapes had been drawn tight across the windows to create a cocoon of heat.
Drabarni - a regional term for the clan healer & wise woman. Revered in her clan for her knowledge in magic and all things spiritual.
Steve looked down at his soup trying to judge how much more of it he would have to swallow to appease his overbearing head of house before he could call the meal to end. He stirred it, watching the cream smother the tiny bites of cucumber and slowly loaded his spoon trying to ignore the way his stomach rolled in protest as he swallowed.
"Spider!" Kitty noticed him first, brown eyes widening at the sight of his crisp uniform. "We didn't think you'd come back. You look like you're here to arrest us."
“I don’t want the children to see me hurt.” He frowned at himself and reached for a jar resting beside the mirror. The bruises on his neck and jaw had faded to a translucent yellow but Steve had always been meticulous.
“Yes.” Tony heard himself say, the breath shuddering out of his chest as if he’d been squeezed and Stefen smiled in relief. Beautiful, Tony thought. The man was going to be the death of him.
Péter didn't know why she resisted making friends when months ago joining the league had been all she could talk about. Her bedroom was still covered in clippings and magazines lauding a woman's role as wife and mother, and nobody scored hirer than she did in the eugenics classes the girls were all required to take.
“Oi, I’d keep your heads down if I was you.” Jack Harrison warned from beneath the bed of the truck. It was followed by a loud clanging sound and a curse, presumably as the thick fingered lug banged his even thicker skull on something down there.
No, at best Tony would be pointed back the way he'd come. There were other options of course, but they too almost did not bare thinking about, at least not at the moment. Right now there was nowhere else to go, nowhere truly safe, and no better chance than this. Tony squared his shoulders, clenched his bags tighter and recommitted himself to prying open the stubborn gate.
"Alright back, give it room!" Tony warned, making sure that Péter had scrambled back as the trunk finally gave way. They watched, panting for breath as the tree toppled over with a shower of snow. From the other side of the fallen pine Péter grinned at Tony, his cheeks bright with exertion. Tony flashed him a brief smile, sharing the momentary high of accomplishment. But there was a ways to go yet and they needed to move quickly.
Steve nodded struck by the sudden urge to touch Sam, to snatch hold of his coat sleeve and keep him there.
He startled when Virginia kneeled down by his head (when had she left?) And rolled his shirt sleeve up and began to attend to the abrasion etched across his forearm just like she'd done that very morning. She'd done it up the way Peggy had shown her, cross bandage and all. His stomach rolled with grief and he shifted away from Frau Hogan, hiding his face with his uninjured arm.
Huh. Bucky searched his face as if the clues to his change of heart could be etched there, despite the openness of Steve’s expression he found nothing forthcoming. He wasn’t a hundred percent certain what had brought it on but he was sure now that Steve really was serious about the decision.
As if called by the thought the kitchen door opened, and Hortense appeared, still in her boots, with broom in hand to sweep the ash and spilled flour from the floor.  She looked up as the dairyman approached with his crate full of jugs. He saw the moment when her gaze moved past him to the truck and found his.
Dvorak didn’t carry the same worry that Becker and the other conspirators carried. Even when he was finally caught, Rogers wouldn’t spill his guts about any of them. He was the worst sort of idealist. A loyal one.
“Father?” The boy’s voice wavered as his father looked down at him with a startled frown but Artur gulped and bravely continued. “Did Sam do something wrong? Do you not like him anymore?”
He’d been so passed out they could have dumped him from the back of the truck and made off with his last coin.
And gone was Tony’s hope that anything he’d said to Captain Rogers that one afternoon on the terrace had registered.
“Plans change Captain. We got a credible tip that the Germans have been mobilizing since February.” Carol replied, her grip tightening on the wheel in her frustration. “The brass is worried the Germans are about to beat us to the punch, but there’s still a chance to save Odinburg and his parliament if we send a small team. The HMS Avenger is leaving with a detachment from Scapa Flow in less than a week for a mining mission in the Vestfjorden. Your team is on it and you have to get there with enough time to prepare. Lucky for you I’m a damned good pilot.”
Charlotte Shrader was a perfect match for Captain Rogers because she knew him. He was a man who carried the world on his shoulders and war in his heart. His apathetic approach to their relationship might have broken a lesser woman. Charlotte was made of stronger stuff.
Down in the drive Tony hugged his siblings one by one, lingering longest with Péter whispering in his ear before he stepped back. James thought he would turn to go, but at the last moment he turned his head, finding James where he stood in the window as if he’d known he would be there and James flinched.
“Then you are just incapable of following orders?” the captain snipped, clipping his words and Tony smiled serenely at him.
"Vati, what's a Krampus?" Sara asked, her brow furrowed in confusion, and Péter's eyes lit up with eager delight as he prepared to launch into some undoubtably horrifying story about the Christmas demon, but Virginia shut him down with a click of her tongue and one of her warning looks.
Ian had been doing his best to keep the others focused on their work until he’d noticed the delivery boy.
Over at his desk Rogers savagely ripped the paper away balled it up and then tossed it aside, before starting again with a fresh sheet and an intense focus.
One of them, penned with a short but delicate feminine script (clearly intended for Bucky) and the other one bore military insignia and the last one...
Péter seemed to shrink as his father bore down on him, realizing too late how woefully unprepared he was for the consequences of his words and Tony felt a stab of pity for him. The boy had earned it, but there were always those who took it too far and they all knew the captain's temper. The trouble with having war under your skin was never knowing when and where it might erupt and Tony was very afraid that Péter was about to find himself in the line of fire.
"Even if it's their job?" Péter challenged, a hard edge to his tone that made Tony wince, suddenly terrified of the consequences behind all their words. As if he expected the S.S. to come pouring out of the trees.
What sort of man threw that away? His mind flashed to the salacious accusations Hammer had made and wondered. He thought back to the words he and Stark had traded at his departure. He remembered the determination that had set over the man's face, and the way he'd wished him luck with a creeping sense of unease. Deiter had not known him long enough to say he knew definitively what Stark was, or what he had shared with Major Rogers while in his employ, but he'd seen the way he loved the Majors children, the only true innocents in all of this.
“Sound proofing?” Joshua inquired curiously, proving that he had a solid grasp of architectural design. “When Virginia said the Captain was looking for workspace, I figured it would be for his painting.”
He wanted nothing more than to grab Susann and confront her about Frau Neumann but Natacha looked like she was having fun.
“I can’t imagine what you’ve got in your head Tony, but I believe with his assistance transferring your estate should be manageable.”
It had only been just under an hour by the time Tony made his way downstairs with James to join the others for breakfast, but to him it felt that hours had passed and he was flirting with the idea of canceling the children’s lessons entirely for the day and seeing if his body wouldn’t be more agreeable to a mid-morning nap than it had been to a nights sleep.
“Perhaps, but what makes Hitler’s Youth any different? You dream of a better world. A pure Germany for all German peoples, stability and prosperity for your great nation. Your youth does not preclude you from longing for a place in the world or a willingness to create change with action. If anything it gives you courage far beyond your years and that is powerful. The Führer knows. He commends you for it every day, doesn’t he? And so do I.”
“You can’t protect me from the truth!” Péter yelled, his voice echoing within the stone walls of the workshop and they both winced. Lowering his voice slightly Péter thrust a finger in the direction of the boat and continued. “It doesn’t matter whether or not you tell me what that’s for, it’s here! He put us in jeopardy the minute he decided to fight them. I’m not scared and I’m not mad. I’m glad he’s fighting them.”
Loss of appetite, nausea, deranged digestion - the symptoms ran through his thoughts like numbers, like they could be calculated into a sum, some definitive diagnosis that would reveal the way to treat Stefen -diarrhea, thirst, hectic fever, tenesmus – think! What
"The baroness will be with you soon, Major." Charlotte's butler had said when he’d left Steve sitting in the parlor, so here he sat, waiting with all the foreboding of a tenant at their lord’s doorstep. He shifted uncomfortably in his seat, feeling at once too big for the sofa and as if it were too big for him. The urge to stand and pace ate at him and he bit the inside of his cheek to keep himself still. The clock above the mantle clicked on.
He’d asked James about Stark during their outing while they’d gathered firewood when the others had been swimming.
Much had changed in the Rogers household since they’d returned from Vienna. Stefen’s fears that the children would be drawn into attendance in the Nazi Youth had proved correct, almost before they’d walked in the door and it mattered little how against it he and the Captain were. The Reich grew stronger, the call to arms blared on and war marched ever and ever closer. Sometimes Vienna felt like a beautiful dream to Tony. In many ways it was. A beautiful dream of happiness and togetherness that he’d never expected to taste in his lifetime. A hopeless dream that had carved itself a space in his body that would forever ache with emptiness.
Tony's strained yell floated down the hall, echoing through the house, as he called for Natacha to hurry up. A moment later he was yelling incredulously at James, who apparently hadn't even begun to get ready.
Ian looked up at him still nervous but curious now and Stefen lifted a brow, the corner of his mouth turning up in a small but genuine smile.
Tony had run for the abbey and had practically screamed the walls down before Nik had agreed to fetch the police. He’d been told by a cold eyed altogether too bored officer that Yinsen had been arrested and taken to prison for abducting him and would likely face execution for the crime. Tony had insisted there had been no abduction and Nik had provided proof that Tony’s father had intended him to be committed to the monastery in the event of his death and an investigation had been launched; but the whole thing had been muddled from the beginning what with Hughard arranging it all in secret and Obadiah frantically searching for him after the riot that had taken the lives of Tony’s parents. By the time Obi had managed to get everything cleared up it had been too late.
"-Yes, and I chose the sanctuary of God. May I come in or is it custom to leave your guests waiting outside?"
They were switched around and resettled within minutes, Tony the last to board after handing little Sara into her father’s arms and watching as Stefen secured her. There was such an air of eager anticipation brimming within the group that Tony could not help but grin, his body thrumming with new energy.
Through the reflection in the window he eyed the black car, and the agent sitting at the wheel who had set aside all pretense and was watching him unabashedly now.  Time to go.
“When their studies are complete. As I said, they will not waste away their summer,” Rogers answered stiffly. Then he held the whistle to his lips and blew four sharp shot trills. Almost immediately footsteps could be heard pounding throughout the upstairs rooms.
The dream of stopping this war before it began, and going home to his family, it was over. Just like Clinton had said.
Péter thought Tony was the best teacher they'd ever had and he knew his siblings agreed... but Natacha was always so concerned with the rules now and Ian wouldn't know how to break a rule if it killed him. The little boys were just little. James and Artur would never try and hurt Tony on purpose but they could both be bull-headed, and sooner or later they were going to say something they shouldn't and someone was going to ask where they got their ideas.
Dr. Erskine had come to the house when her Baka got sick. He'd left medicine. She remembered her mother tucking away the little brown bottle in her drawer.
“Sir, I have express orders to take you straight to the general, Sir.” The corporal answered nervously.
"I've been out for coffee with Miram Svader and his cousin. They're both surveillance police. Do you know them?" she asked in a seemingly harmless fashion and Steve felt his hackles rise, but took a breath to keep calm.
He resisted the urge to cast his eyes about nervously to see who might have overheard. It still felt dangerous hearing it said out loud, even though they were at the table alone and Tony was just one unidentified man seeking refuge among many. One homeless Jew among many.  He took a deep breath. Met Bruce's eyes – relieved that they were just as soft and unjudgmental as every time before – and nodded, before looking back at the lumpy potato he was holding between his hands and trying not to maim himself as he sliced away a section of peel.
As much as he didn’t want it to end and he wasn’t looking forward to a night rattling around their rooms all by himself, it wasn’t like he was keen on going to a ball hosted by Nazis either.
“Stefen, you have seven children.” his eye’s twinkled at Steve as he drained the rest of his glass. “Got to keep up with them somehow, right Cap?”
“Your father set aside exactly Five-hundred thousand marks at the bank of Berlin, which was to be metered out in donations to St. Péter’s Abbey for every year that you remained in residence and given to your mother’s kin should you die an untimely death.”
“No Maria, it’s over then under. You have to alternate.” Natacha said from behind them, and Tony turned to observe where the others were working to rope the beds. Natacha, Péter, and Ian were holding up the square frame while Maria (with Sara trailing behind her) worked underneath, weaving the rope through the large holes Tony’d painstakingly drilled in the frames to form netting.
“Another beer Hedy and a plate of –” he began to order but Hedwig just cut him off with an indulgent smile.
Steve glanced out the window once more, at the German Chancellery rising high above the rest. It was empty now, save for a small guard of only eighteen S.S. soldiers. The bulk of Hitler’s elite fighting force was on the Czechoslovakian border, which was the entire reason for his absence from Berlin.
’ with the fervor of someone who’d had their honor besmirched and Tony was still refereeing the ensuing squabble when a voice called out from the hall.
“Stark!”  he hollered, dropped the whistle, his feet turning towards the workshop almost ahead of his thoughts.
“When Antony returns I will get to the bottom of it Tiberius,” Nik ended the man's protest before it could begin, but before he could dismiss the younger monk there was a great clatter as something heavy and metallic fell against the cobble stones and a voice that sounded a lot like Antony's hissed  a violent curse.
Bucky laughed as Péter received the sort of glare from his sister that someone would bestow upon a bug they wished to squash.
Virginia loosened his grip, tutting at him as she patted his hand gently, her gaze heavy. Steve thought she might have guessed the truth.
Two days of this hell, of rattling around like a marble in a tin can, while Magda risked everything driving the farm truck to its limits as they crossed the country and up into the mountains.
They walked along the beach, about forty minutes to Steve’s estimation until turning inward and heading deeper into the city. There was a part of Steve who still recognized the beauty of his surroundings, even in the warm Mediterranean rain Nice was a city of beauty that was hard to rival, but it was spoiled by all of the signs of war – there if you knew where to look for them. The blacked-out and boarded windows to hide residences at night from bombing aircrafts. The residences standing empty, men off to the front lines and those left behind moving further inland for safety. The stillness of everything, as if the city had lost all its life and vitality.  What had Luzzato called it? Oh yeah. A damn waste.
Hughard had believed Tony could change the world. Apparently.  But Tony would never have a chance to ask his father if what the abbot had said was true. It didn’t matter, he realized. It didn’t matter what Hughard Stark had believed or didn’t believe. What mattered was that Tony believed.
The urge to figure Stefen out, what made his mind tick, all the things he kept so readily behind locked lips had never faded. And now? Tony desperately wanted to pull him apart like a theorem, undo all of his tight corners until he understood him.
"I do not. But I've been instructed to guard the Major's children as if they were my own and it is a task I take very seriously."
Ian’s stomach began to sink into his toes even as his heart tried to climb its way up into his throat.
While Nigel was distracted gushing at Tony Steve made good his escape, nodding apologetically to both as he hastily murmured, "If you’ll excuse me? I’m being called."
It wouldn’t hurt just to see, right? He pressed, the key releasing so pure a sound he shivered with delight.
Beside Stefen Bucky and Charlotte watched on, the later with an expression of dubious curiosity and the former looking as if he was holding his breath.
Hammer swallowed backing away from the man with a fearful step and Lt. Stevens turned away.  He nodded briefly to Tony and the others before he followed after his comrade not looking back.
Also fun fact about Leopoldstadt, the district that he and Bucky lived in as young men is a sister city of Brooklyn. It officially gained “twin-city” status with Brooklyn in 2007 due to its high percentage of Jewish inhabitants before the war and similar social and cultural development. :) we did that on purpose (obviously) because we wanted to maintain some of their MCU "Brooklyn boy" aesthetic.
It had always been enough, so it was not that Stefen had languished or pined away for the unattainable… it was more that he had been lonely in the knowledge that one day Bucky, the closest person to him, would find someone and Steve would fall behind.
He dragged the sled free and wiped a bead of sweat from his brow, glancing back up the side of the mountain. He wasn’t as good with math as Péter so he couldn’t tell how many feet he’d managed to slide down but he was surprised at how much distance he’d managed to cover in such a short amount of time. It would have taken him hours to manage the same on the winding road. He trotted back to the edge of the ledge, his belly squirming when he realized how close he’d truly come to sliding off of it. It had been very close, very very close, and Ian’s legs began to shake so badly he couldn’t quite reach the edge. He stood there, frozen and shaking, unable to stomach the thought of moving let alone getting back on the sled.
“Go back to sleep. It's gods piss in the morning.” Bucky mumbled from underneath his arm and Steve snorted into his hands. Bucky had never been a morning person, especially when he’d had something to drink the night before.
The person with her, a man, stomped about, flicking his torch left and right. Steve could see the beam of light roaming this way and that through the threads of the blanket. He couldn’t hope that the man wouldn’t investigate the mound of blankets in the corner. Steve had the element of surprise but that was all. He'd have to rely on that, and what strength he could muster. It might work, presuming the other man didn’t have a weapon.
‘Why, Mr. Stark was looking through our records for information on an Isiah Carboni’ they would say, and from there it was only a short trail to the truth of his birth that not even Hughard’s money could completely wash away. It was a risk he’d had to take, but it still left him feeling jumpy. It had been over twenty years since he’d left Pola and he needed something more to give the solicitor than one old address.
“Did you know what she was doing?” Steve interjected, his eyes settling on his daughter who was still kneeling on the floor where she’d obviously landed after her climb. His tone warned Péter not to test him. He could hear how wrong it was – too
Tony had asked, wondering how they were going to keep seven growing children fed, who were not at all accustomed to rationing.
And Stark just kept looking at him with those eyes of his, seeing too much. When he extended his hands Stefen understood what he wanted, but it wasn’t any easier to let go.
Captain,” the man’s lips turned up in a stale smile. Steve bristled, “It only occurred to me that, there was a reason for brother Filip’s pence. I learned that forgiveness is a luxury, sometimes hard earned. Brother Filip would always give it to me if I worked for it.”
“The list of names. It goes without saying that you are to show this to no one. The magazines are only to be sent to those listed as subscribers. No one is to be added to that list accept through myself or James and we will always do so in person.”
He scowled, making his way toward the kitchen doors. He no longer felt in a party mood. He stumbled over the step and into the kitchen, uncommonly cool what with no preparation for tomorrows meals and the fire in the ovens long since put out.  Tony thought half a second of going to his room, and then to going outside and finding Julia or any one of the other young women who had ever sent him a flirtatious smile. Women whom would be happy to share his bed and weren’t engaged to be married!
“You said you were out hunting with your pa?” Dagmar questioned him after Ian had taken a few more gulps of the hot drink and some of the blue had faded from around his lips. Ian nodded and the balding man grunted, his eyes flickering over Ian’s strange attire. For the first time he considered what he must look like in a handmade wool vest that was little more than a blanket with a hole cut in it, bound tightly around him with burlap. Leg and arm warmers made of fur rug.
Steve had never been more serious about anything else in his life. He couldn’t give Charlotte or Tony what either of them deserved, and he couldn’t give his children all that he ached to but he could give them all this. Safety and a home where they could be together. He could give them this one small gift.
The metal was cutting beautifully without signs of developing faults or abrasions. Sparks flew past Tony’s face, the skin that wasn’t covered by the oil stained kerchief he’d tied over his nose growing flushed from the heat the cutter was giving off.
The sound of piano keys tinkled through the ball room as the guests, their dinner plates cleared away and their wine glasses refilled, soaked in the first round of entertainment for the evening. One woman in sitting at a table a few feet from where they’d set up the piano seemed to have taken particular interest in the music. She looked to be approaching her fifties, with a touch of grey woven attractively through her fair hair. She watched Tony as he played with an unnerving focus, her mouth curling into a small smirk when Tony looked up to catch her staring.
Steve knew he was right, but it didn’t stop the fear creeping up inside of him. Still he did as Tony asked, taking a few more deep breathes before nodding his readiness. Tony opened the door and Steve stepped over the threshold, holding himself back to let Tony catch up even though the urge to get to the music room was still pricking at his skin like needles. Tony brushed his hand briefly against his in encouragement but thankfully he did not force them to linger any longer than that.
Steve had never felt carnally for him, though he could honestly say he loved Bucky more than he loved himself and it was a feeling amply returned. Maybe Steve could have loved Bucky as a lover once, but it hadn’t happened that way. They had been brothers first and foremost and Steve didn’t need Bucky’s body to have his heart.
“Tony!” Péter tugged on Tony’s jacket harshly for his attention and pointed at the tall man who had melted out of the shadows to accost them. Tony looked but rather than be alarmed like Péter expected he just looked annoyed.
"Maybe, but you're not thinking about the cold, anymore are you?" Péter didn’t answer, but his face spoke volumes. They continued walking in silence, warmed somewhat by the spirits but keeping close together for additional warmth.
He’d worked through the night, but it was still too early for breakfast so Tony had given himself the grand tour again, moving through the rooms of the house feeling largely like an interloper as the staff went about preparing the house for another day. He made his way down to the kitchens, out to the garage and the gardens, and eventually back to his quarters to wash before breakfast.
Tony encountered the first snag since leaving the house that morning while trying to direct their attendant with the luggage. There wasn’t a hotel grand enough in all the world to provide enough beds for seven children and three adults so it was quite obvious that they’d have to share. Less obvious was how to pair off.
“French,” Natacha insisted stubbornly but she glanced from Pepper to Tony, her eyes narrowed, unsure if he were teasing her. Tony eased up.
"Your Da ever warn you about sour faces?" Bakhuizen teased, ruffling the James semi-dry hair, leaving it in spikes. "Come on, we're going to need to get those snares in if we want to eat before sunrise."
It was only for a second but Steve suddenly felt a rush of Deja vu. Of being on one end of a weapon and the snarled terror ridden face of an Italian on the other.
“But I think you are wise Frau Greer, in that a father does not like to think of his daughter pursuing motherhood – no matter what her age. We’ll just have to forgive how seasick your father looks, won’t we Natacha?”
"I have to run, but you mustn't worry for me Captain. I am hardier than I look. I will see you all again soon."
