Tony's gaze travels up from where he's been staring, transfixed, at a knot in Butterfingers' mane. (He'll have to brush that out later. Or cut it off. Depending on severity.) They haven't talked in what must be hours, and it's strange to hear the man address him so suddenly. His mind already begins to associate Rogers' low baritone with a feeling of comforting familiarity, which is, frankly, scary.
really, for the lack of a better word. While there's still clear outlines of muscle visible through his shirt, the shape of him is different, his edges less angular.
Tony sees him glancing at the mirror and schools his expression to suppress the smirk threatening to overtake his features.
He's returned from his run and finds Tony in the kitchen, putting used dishes in the washer. There's two half-empty cups of coffee on the counter waiting to be put away. He points at them, inquisitive, "Visitors?"
Steve laughs when he sees him bite his lip, obviously hung up on the thought.
“I figured it out. Nebula will tell you. It’s about
Tony gasps in feigned outrage. "Nick, I'm wounded, really." As Fury steps closer and Steve moves to shake his hand while the man's good eye burns a hole in his profile, Tony speaks up again.
Not for Tony, whose jaw clenches with the crushing force of grim determination that Steve knows can move mountains. Not for Tony, who has a bright, livid shine in his eyes that means he has something to prove to himself and the world.
Peter nodded, but after a moment, his forehead creased with a frown. "Does she know you are leaving?"
He has noticed. That's obvious. Why hasn't he said anything, though? Tony would've probably been hurt in his pride, but at least he'd have known, right? He could've done something about it. So Steve– Steve wouldn't have to get any ideas, like suddenly realizing how maybe Tony isn't actually all that attractive anymore, how all that prowess and pretended youth is gone and has left him with a jaded and tired old man whose quirks and shortcomings are no longer painted over by some pretty/handsome façade that would make him easy on the eyes if nothing else.
"I'm sorry, you think it's a lot? I had some of our best sex with someone who isn't you
Shamefaced and squirming because he’s just realizing the full scope of what living here really is like. They’d certainly have their own, private space for this sort of thing in first, Steve is aware. Well, not here. Welcome to reality.
"I can tell, you know?"
do, Steve lies with him and cradles his head against his chest, stroking the greasy strands of his hair in what he hopes is a comforting manner.
. The eight arms of the emblem stretch across each of their chests like the star once did. A caricature. Five skulls for five men. Tony doesn't know why he ever assumed there would be just one.
“Yeah?”
A lot less thrilled about this than he expected to be.
Steve moves his left eyebrow up in an unambiguous manner and says, “I’m sure they do when Captain America asks
He doesn't bother to look away, his eyes intently focused on Steve's face as if he's looking for something. Then, he drops his head to his chest, pauses, and sucks in a shuddering breath as he raises it again, eyes swimming.
There’s nothing but snow,
Steve could tell all of them still had preferences, like how Bruce and Thor would more and more often be found together just as Nat and Clint had their own thing going on (although Natasha seemed to have also taken a liking to Ms. Potts, but Steve didn't have enough insight to make an educated guess on the true nature of their relationship).
,” he barks, dragging one of the alphas back by the shoulders while Bucky and, after a moment, Natasha dash out of the crowd to help. He growls at the assailant, daring him to challenge his position; as expected, the younger man backs away, albeit reluctantly. With the help of his second-in-command, the others settle down without much fuss.
. Tony’s tight like a vice around him, his body rocking back and forth with Steve’s every thrust. It’s good, and unusual. They usually don’t take this time when having sex, rather tending to come down fast and rough, pushing and challenging one another as they always do. It’s no surprise that replacing the urgency with something of a gentler nature feels like an entirely new level of intimacy.
“I hate you,” he repeats, a hiss this time, and his body slumps, limply dangling from the metal framework of the shelf he's tied to.
Stark’s nostrils flare, his stinging, blue gaze reduced to a dimly flickering one. His eyes are indeed brown, underneath whatever tech usually shields them from sight. A pity, because they’re exceptionally pretty; chocolate, hickory and umber. Big, reminiscent of a deer’s. Of prey.
The closer he gets to the glove that accommodates the infinity stones, the more restless he gets. They're emitting a steady, dim glow, all in their respective places where Tony first put them. It's not that he's in awe of their power -- no, not that. He's far past that. He's
He's only shaken out of his trance once the front door slams shut. Steve takes a steadying breath to combat the sudden dizziness. Then, he searches for Tony outside the kitchen window, quickly finding the man walking down the small jetty all the way to the end and taking a seat there.
This morning, they'd gotten a horse for Tony at Red Rock's smith, a greying man who keeps the animals around for company rather than their use. His attachment to each and every one of them and the lack of business competition meant that the price would burn a hole in any other man's wallet, but with Tony being who he is, money isn't an issue. Rogers seemed mildly bemused when Tony paid up without complaint, but didn't ask questions. Tony decided he liked that.
"Well, to be frank, 'm not sure it is so secret after all, seeing as it even serves as gossip for the washing maids." He laughed at his own words, only continuing after he had recovered from a series of hiccups.
I mean, I am… this is tragic."
" Tony barks. "The real Steve. My Steve. Where?"
He was still favoring his left leg, but now too, the man approached him with intent – as much was obvious when he requested, "If it please you, I would like to join you for King's Landing, Sir Rhodes."
Said boyfriend squeezes his dick to the point of discomfort–ow, what's up with that–effectively jolting him back to the current moment in time. Tony's erection hasn't flagged at all, which is a small miracle considering his brain is occupied with everything but his carnal desires right now.
Next to his head, the wall is now branded with a fist-shaped dent. A mark that belongs to Steve, the wrong Steve, the
and how is that anywhere near the truth? Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, yadda yadda, but that doesn't make it make
In the first week, Fury makes good on his promise and sends a team to search the house and its perimeter for any anomalies – the agents are turning over every rock-slash-object around the house (quite literally, to Tony’s immense dismay) while a few lab coats carry out all sorts of scientific tests, hoping to come across a trace of anything that may indicate Fury's suspicions to be true.
When they do, word gets around spreading like a bushfire. He's akin to the dirty secret whispered behind lockers in high school corridors and it gets increasingly difficult to ignore how everyone's trying with all their might not to notice when he slips past them in the hallways.
Steve’s eyebrows wander up to his hairline. Well, shucks.
, and although the gaping hole he leaves in his wake will take time to heal, his smile and easy humor do a lot more for all the people in the room than a forced, sober goodbye ever could.
The guilt in his eyes gives Tony pause. He nods through a sigh. Steve disappears to do as he said and Tony takes a walk around the house as well, not expecting to find much.
After Lord Hammer had, fortunately, lost interest in her existence, he began to joke and jest with the people around him. They all were of his own entourage, household knights and other members of his court – all but the quiet, brooding Lord Von Doom who was a whole other kind of unpleasant and seemed hurt in his pride after having been denied his request to attend Lord Stark's private festivities.
Tony. Just Tony would be enough.
In the beginning, it overwhelms him, this airy light-heartedness he isn't used to from anyone. It dies, somehow, somewhere, when you grow older – but this young Miss Stark certainly still has it, and lives it with her whole being.
Nothing was ever coincidental. The last
Lord Stark cared for excitement and extravagance, and this tournament was nothing if not that.
The hymns written about this war did not do justice to the sacrifices made, but songs seldom spoke of horror and blood.
Once he's taken a last look around the property, he makes sure to close the safety lock on the door and push a bookshelf in front like they do every night, and then he crawls into bed next to Tony. His sleep seems not to be fitful for once, breathing deep and expression relaxed. He's sleeping on his side again instead of his back–Steve notes the development with a smile. Carefully, he lodges himself in the space behind Tony and curls an arm around him, making sure not to stir his bad arm that is propped up on his side.
a Steve Rogers, why would–"
Steve doesn't hold it against him. Then again, he's also not surprised when he sees the man drive up to the compound a few days later, nervous energy hidden behind a smirk and a fleeting mention of ‘oh yeah, and I’ve solved time travel, by the way’ because that’s just who Tony is.
What?
He isn't lucky.
Stark looks away, but Steve sees him worry his bottom lip. “It’s, ah, not. Not about that.” His blush darkens and he clears his throat, stalling. “I can’t, with– with everyone. It’s humiliating.”
“If I don’t make it, tell them it’s time. It’s always been time. There was never enough of it. I tried everything and it still caught up with me. But they can, they– Strange said there’s a way. This is it. Time. Time’s the way. You just need to figure out the specifics, if I can’t.”
Now that he's no longer preoccupied, his empty stomach grumbles as if on command. Steve exhales, mildly annoyed. Downstairs, the unlit corridor seems to swallow the other end of the staircase whole in a way that shouldn't be as eerie as it is, and Steve lets the idea go. His appetite is gone and he'll survive. Tomorrow is another day.
Maybe the prospect of imminent doom is all it takes.
"Hurts, Steve," he says, an unspoken plea for a relief that Steve can't give him ringing within the words. He swallows roughly, fingers spasming around Steve's wrist and then falling away. His voice shakes, reduced to the barest wisp of air between teeth, "It hurts so much."
is all sorts of flattering and mind-boggling.
"I promised myself when I walked out of that bunker–" He shakes his head, eyes hardening. "I keep breaking you but I'm the only one who can keep you from destroying yourself. Strange paradox, isn't it?"
Tony thought it a little strange that Steve would be squeamish about this particular thing, so he's been giving the matter some thought. Although he hasn't hinted at anything of the like as of yet, Tony figures it might be that for all that he can stand the heat no problem, his skin in a way responds to external sensations with the same intensity all his other senses do and is thus more sensitive than average.
Time flies by, Tony muses, when you’re constantly scrambling not to lose your grip on the last thread that holds you–your sanity, your sense of self, your everything–together.
and got off on it. He was so utterly wretched, and they weren't anywhere near done, had barely even started, and Steve just–
"I'm not him, Steve," he says, gently, almost. Maybe Steve's imagining it, but there's the tinge of regret in his voice. "If you're staying? If I'm going to have to remind myself of that every time I look at you? You might as well do the both of us a favor and try too. Just, please– don't make it any more complicated than it has to be."
"I'm done, I'm ready. Steve, I swear to
Lord have mercy. Tony thought they were done with that now.
His body sinks against Steve with a soft thump, exhausted to the point he's slipped into a state between sleep and consciousness where their unspoken rules have no meaning. Steve's only a warm body Tony is instinctively leaning toward because keeling over the other side would mean ending up in the water.
They've been riding for half a day. Even with breaks in between, it's the longest Tony has ever spent on horseback, and his body keeps him very aware of that fact with every movement of the animal underneath him. His legs are cramping and his ass is already numb, making the whole affair a rather painful endeavor.
was to be taken literally or not, because his disappointment would be immeasurable if Steve decided its meaning was to remain PG.
Could have, but Steve refused. They didn't grasp his reasoning–that it felt plastic, unnatural, fundamentally wrong to hire a person for an act that should be the opposite of all these unwanted qualities.
Except Steve has other plans, because when Tony sits up and starts working at the buttons of his shirt, the other man takes hold of both his wrists and decidedly peels his fingers off. He leans over him as he brings their hands up next to Tony's head, pressing them into the mattress alongside his body.
The other Lord had barely drunk a sip at all and wore the look of someone who believed this interaction to be beneath them. In spite of it, he returned, "And I presume you are in the know of one particularly earth-shattering example?"
with nothing but the look in his eyes and a twitch of his chin.
It starts snowing. Flakes light as feathers, at first, and then the wind picks up and the crystals become pinpricks in Tony’s face. The rock and vegetation disappear, swallowed by swirling gusts of white, and with that his last points of orientation are gone.
And he thought he'd built up a tolerance to trouble in the noplaceville that is Red Rock. Apparently, no such luck.
Whichever way you look at it, he's still a guest in this place. A guest reminding of someone loved and gone, and that doesn't make the matter any easier.
“You throw that at some poor bastard? Boom. Well-done mincemeat. Just need something to light the fuse.”
Tony shivers as another surge of pain shoots through him, seething hot in his veins. The truth tastes like rancid milk in his mouth, sour and left standing for too long. All the pieces were right there all this time and he never figured out what to do with them–so in a way, it’s his own fault. He could’ve prevented this if he’d stopped and used his brain for a damn second. He could’ve saved his Steve, and he failed. (The irony of being concerned about his own safety while Steve was the one in danger all along doesn’t go past him. It’s a cruel one.)
Tony narrows his eyes at himself and stares harder, like that might change what he's seeing entirely.
Steve tries not to be that hopelessly pessimistic most of the time. Really, they manage well, for the better part. The wounds, for all that they are still fresh and ever-present, don't sting unless they accidentally happen to press right on them.
The only time he ever sees himself naked is in the bathroom mirror, and that one's only waist-high and somehow less intrusive. Plus, most of the time he's in the nude around here he is preoccupied with other things, i.e. Steve and his often respective nudity.
When he managed to draw his eyes away from Tony and looked over, the rest of the team was lounging in different poses all over the bed; Clint with his head on Nat's stomach, Bruce flopped over Thor's front, one large hand resting on his back.
Steve realizes, pulse spiking.
Tony cards his fingers through the hair at the back of his skull. Strangely enough, it's too short to play with like he usually does. And come to think of it, the shape of it's different at the front too.
They eat their food in silence. Steve dares to say he's never felt so out of place, so much urge to fill the silence with words than right now – and Tony, who always knows something to say, who so expertly fills time and space with the spoken word and knows to bend it to his will and forge a blade with it like nobody else he's ever known, doesn't say anything.
He's on the floor, breathing heavily, braced on his forearms. Except, the floor isn't concrete anymore; it's turned soft and slightly damp. Something tickles his nose, and Steve moves his head to the right only to be met with the same sensation again.
"You're too much like him."
Tony swallows. It's impossible to ignore just how close they are; he is acutely aware of every sensation and every single point of contact. Legs entangled, Tony's backside against the man's groin, chest hair tickling his skin, breath grazing his neck. Their bodies are slotted together perfectly, and Tony allows himself to savor that moment and the belief that this is how they're meant to be.
Tony is just about to finish his meal (he’s only eaten half, but that’s about what was to be expected) when Steve decides now’s as good a time as any.
Steve decides to do them both a favor and complies with the request. He unceremoniously shoves Tony onto his stomach and kneels between his legs without ever slipping out all the way. Tony groans at the sudden pressure on his cock that’s now rubbing against the mattress beneath him.
He’d happily spend a few restless nights if it was Tony’s sleeping form curled up right next to him. (Only that their time’s run out and they have no way of knowing if there’ll be any more nights to spend at all, after this is over.)
"We'll see about that," he says instead, trying for casual but matter-of-fact.
Tony looks – puzzled. And that can’t be. How could their timelines be identical in excruciating detail and differ in this major event, one that, in his world, changed the team in a substantial way?
There’s a throbbing ache in his left shoulder, the fabric torn where a particularly stubborn zombie dug its teeth into his flesh as he made his escape from the body shop, unable to wait out until the group lingering at the door was gone. Tony didn’t,
Without preamble, Tony grasps the armrests by his side and lifts himself up. It's just enough for Steve to press his cock between his cheeks until he finds give. And he always does; even after a day or two that sees him only using the man's mouth, he'll come back to find him barely requiring a stretch. On a usual business day, Tony will be slick and yielding without fail because Steve has found he likes to indulge in his heightened libido now that he has someone to stoke the flames of his desire.
Tony's body shook around him violently on the next thrust in, and Steve stilled as a momentary feeling of horror shot through him. The other man whined in response, inching back to take slip more of him inside – the reaction had been a positive one. Steve resumed his movement and aimed to hit that same spot he had brushed previously, and there: Tony twitched again, fingers clutching the sheets spasming, and moaned an obscene sound that made arousal flare up with renewed vigor in every cell of Steve's body.
The other man stops stirring the unappetizing contents of the stew cooking on the stove, snorts, and returns to his task.
After the second snap, Thanos returns.
Steve chuckles at the shameless display of need but humors him, folding his body over Stark’s to bridge the space between them and get a better angle before he begins fucking into him in earnest. Stark yelps, unprepared, as the first few thrusts crowd him into the mattress – then, he begins to meet Steve’s movements with his own, their bodies colliding with sharp, wet slaps. There’s a possibility he isn’t even fully aware of it: a litany of small, guttural
"We need some space, both of us. I guess I should've listened when you asked me to leave in the first place but I'm…selfish, and when I was offered that opening, I didn't have the willpower to walk away. But I realize now that it's not fair to you, me piling my–my being here on you on top of everything else."
question. Or the
Maybe in just a moment, he’s going to wake up.
Tony takes a step back from the ledge, looking back up from where he's been studying the artfully crafted stone circle at the bottom of the abyss. Steve is still eyeing the Skull warily from where he's standing, shield clutched in one hand and his body strung taut, as if he's expecting his former nemesis to whisper "Hail Hydra" in that gravely voice of his and attack at any given point in the next minutes.
When Tony wakes, it’s with a ragged groan that violently rips Steve out of his trance where he’s been sitting next to the bed all these hours, only moving away for a change of clothes and to get a fire started.
“No.”
This isn't how it's supposed to end.
wells up and spills over his lips next, varying in pitch and volume which seems to directly correlate with how hard Steve’s thrusts come.
Instead, after battling with himself and finding his self-control sorely lacking, he fumbles for the phone in the second drawer from the top. He flips it open and discovers–because of course he should be that lucky–an unread message blinking at him from the notification bar. The rational thing to do would be to delete it, or maybe throw the whole phone across the room and hope it breaks (which is a distant hope at best, these things are bricks) but he finds himself frozen and his breath catching in his throat.
contently when Steve gasps and snaps his hips forward reflexively.
These days, there is little they can’t do without facing consequences. The other governmental corporations will give them a slap on the wrist if anything at all, because the reality is–they need Hi-dra more than it needs them. Hi-dra keeps the peace within the city, as much peace as there will ever be. They’re what’s standing between them and chaos, uprisings, the lower-class scum. If AIM and the like were to decide they didn’t need Hi-dra, chances are Hi-dra would get rid of them instead.
Tony double-taps the arc reactor and nosedives off the edge.
Rogers pulls the door close and pushes the flimsy lock in place, a last gust of cool air carrying into the room before its kind is locked out entirely. Tony looks away before his gaze can linger, and returns to poking the humble beginnings of the fire crackling in the fireplace. He adds a few smaller chippings of wood just to be safe, watching as they’re consumed by the flames.
, he's an equally famed and ruthless gang leader running from the law, Tony ends up… not doing that. Perhaps the outlaw story is too much of a fitting allegory, only difference being that he hasn't committed murders in the typical sense and is now running from himself and his guilt.
This was a trick question, she realized. James Rhodes was impressively impassive when he set his mind to it, but he had never been one to prefer a comfortable lie over a discomforting truth.
Making quick work of it, Tony slathers some shaving cream on and grabs the smaller razor from his side of the sink, opting to get the fine-tuning done outside in the big bedroom mirror. It's a lot easier to spot the wayward hairs when he gets a closer look without the bathroom sink between him and the mirror.
, damnit) rounded pectorals that have lost the privilege of being referred to as such a while ago, because the picture you associate with the word isn't this. Steve has pecs, the Adonis. Tony, well. He's scraping by, so to speak.
a voice says.
The mirror shows them from the side; Tony drinks in the image presented there. Steve’s an unstoppable force behind him, skin glistening with sweat, muscles rippling as his hips piston back and forth in tandem with the grunts forced out of his lungs. His face is a colorful blend of emotions directly aimed at Tony.
As loose as he is, he doesn't need much prep.
Tony bares his throat to give him better access, his breath stuttering for a moment. "Ah, no," he says, the secrecy deliberate. "Not quite yet."
“This,” he says, pointing to it with his other hand, “is your most valuable possession. I can’t
He pats the mare's neck as they ride; she's got a dark chestnut coloring and goes by the name of Butterfingers. Tony doesn't see how that's a fitting name for any horse, but then again, he's witnessed Rogers calling his strawberry roan
It's serene out here, despite Maria's (
And it's this, out of all things, that gets a genuine reaction out of the man. He jerks back like each word is a punch and each punch hits the same broken bone. An open fracture, bared to the world.
Bruce precedes Thanos; he’s traumatized and fidgety and Tony wants to ask
. Of course Stark wouldn't do this in his own motherfuckin' backyard, he'd rent a whole industrial compound somewhere far away where he thinks nobody'll find it. And then
Ultrasounds, Tony realizes, are outdated.
"Are you gonna get a move on?"
Tony always assumed that, whatever she is or isn’t, her organism doesn’t operate like any living being he knows. (He can’t help but wonder, but knows better than to ask.) Her otherness becomes all the more evident as he watches her seemingly unbothered by the lack of sustenance while his own body withers like a neglected flower as the days pass.
Natasha, who’s in charge of monitoring the omega’s every move, smirks at Steve in passing, a quick flash of teeth that goes as soon as it came. “This is going remarkably well,” she comments, in a tone that indicates she finds that fact to be suspicious rather than pleasing. Steve halts in his step and urges her to elaborate the thought, always trusting her instincts above all.
Steve swallows against the tears climbing toward the surface. "I'm sorry," he repeats, and believes it a little less than the first time. Tony lives. How can he be sorry for that? If he hadn't taken action, Tony would have turned days ago. But as it is, he is still here, crying and breathing and in
Tony, in an annoying and borderline sadistic way. He chooses to deny himself instant pleasure for something so small and insignificant, because he thinks it might go some way toward helping Tony.
Surprisingly, his expression turned out to be one of thoughtful contemplation and not, as Steven had feared, hurt irritation. And, surely enough, he shared his youngest touch of genius a moment later.
Nobody, and especially not an outcast first-class, speaks to or about his people like they're sheep to be herded into a dark place and forgotten about until there comes such a time when they might prove useful in some way or another.
Steve slicks up his dick with one hand and uses the other to grab a fistful of Stark's hair, unceremoniously pressing his face into the mattress and deferring any further comments. Dirty talk would be fine if everyone in the bunks around them wasn't able to hear what is only meant for Steve's ears – at least Steve tells himself it's about holding up (relative) peace and quiet instead of keeping Stark's words and sounds just for himself.
The air is cool against his heated skin, and Steve’s fingers suddenly teasing against his hole are slick and unexpected. Tony gasps into the pillow and pushes against the finger.
He meant to get a head-start on dressing up for dinner for once, but he should be able to get a quick shave in. After all, it is their monthly scheduled date; this is the one that, even when all others get canceled for one often super-heroing-related reason or another, will remain. It's
And then Tony thinks that same thought again and this time it creates a little spark that sets something aflame inside of him.
Steve spends some time searching for a dustpan and then cleans up the mess of broken glass on the floor he caused in his surprise. After, he makes himself comfortable in the living room while he waits and anxiously watches the clock as five, ten, fifteen minutes tick by.
"Don't mention it," Tony says, disappearing on the other side of the door as he pulls it close gently.
There is no time. People think they will always have it, until they suddenly don't. It's a cycle, and everyone falls prey to it. Tony thought he had time, to assess every aspect of this strange bond he's forged with this man, to sneak clandestine glances, to turn over every piece of information he has and doesn't have in his head before he takes action – and it almost cost him everything.
The shrewd glint in James' gaze insinuated that he had hoped for a scenario like this. Few people could play Natalia Romanova for a fool and survive, but Rhodes seemed to have meant only to embarrass his friend, which she figured she could excuse. It had been amusing, after all.
Rogers descends the stairs, rubbing the back of his neck with a somewhat contemplative frown gracing his features. It seems he has also discovered the latest problem they’re faced with: arrangements regarding sleeping spaces have to be made.
They don't move and don't talk for a while. There was a time when that would've made his skin crawl with discomfort–he's never liked silence, and his
“Why you love how I–? Because you’re a gullible idiot with bad taste, I thought we established that already,” he quips, just about keeping himself from sticking his tongue out like a kid refusing to eat his greens.
There is a small space inside it where his fingers don't touch his palm and vice versa.
"...yeah?"
Steve settled down for the night not even ten minutes ago. The noise pulls him out of long-awaited sleep and back into sobering reality, where hushed voices are all around and someone in the front calls for the people’s attention. He figures it’s just another unscheduled count; they’ve been getting those more and more frequently lately, almost like the guards could sense something being in the air despite their general cluelessness.
"I think it is," his voice that sounds alien to him says to no-one in particular. "I think I did all I could."
is nice, being reaffirmed in that knowledge is even better.
Stark knows he means trouble from the very moment they come face to face. Why else would he be strategically obstructing his only way out of the dead end at his back?
Rogers shook his head. “From the Irôc Isles, originally. I,” he paused, swaying a little on his feet. “I have not been there in a long time, so that may explain why I do not sound like my people anymore.”
"I'm sorry," he sobs into Tony's hair, because he'd do it all over again if it was to save him.
Steve releases the skin on Stark's neck that he's bitten multiple marks into, temporarily marking the omega as his. He slings an arm around the other's chest, now stained with the man’s own come, and carefully rolls them both to the side, making sure to face Stark inward.

(See the end of the chapter for
Well, here's hoping.
The sudden, unbearable need is frightening. He isn't a stranger to this, touching himself with thoughts he shouldn't be having in the midst of the night, but he feels even more depraved for it – out here where there's nothing to shield him, nowhere to hide.
something that Steve realized was a choked sob only a beat later. The man was glaring daggers at him from over his shoulder, and there were tears in his eyes – not caused by pain or something of similar nature, but ones of ecstasy, of overwhelming pleasure and, as it seemed, of frustration.
"We'll need more lube here, Clint," Bruce said from somewhere to his right.
Donna has moved to her bed at the bottom bunk, cradling her boy close. She nods at him in approval when he searches her gaze, questioning. "Go. An' keep it down a lil'. I always try t'hold his ears close 'n all, but it ain't that easy."
Tony is tired of waiting for an epiphany to strike.
The attack is sudden, and it gets ugly just as fast. Steve can’t even contemplate what might’ve encouraged the group to move to this part of town, can’t allow himself to be distracted for even a moment if he wants to retain even the sliver of a chance to get both of them out of this alive.
For a moment, Steve dares to lean into the kiss, give it his everything as if he were somewhere else, sometime else, with another Tony altogether in front of him and the knowledge in mind that it'll be their last kiss in this lifetime.
Compliments tailored to his emotional and personal values? Psh. Hell no. Tony'd choose having his guts rearranged over that any day.
After all, they were getting front-row seats to a lewd and live performance of something no one on the outside would ever be privy to.
He's so full and he's been ready to burst practically since the beginning, so when his cock drags against the rough cotton of the bedsheet with every push–well, it's over quickly.
all of this adds up to how big of a favor Steve’ll be willing to give in return eventually, so logic dictates he can’t not do it.
He waits, expecting something else, but Nebula doesn’t react, doesn’t even spare him a glance. Tony decides not to look a gift horse in the mouth, and eats.
Tony knows there's not one particular moment from which he’s done everything wrong there was to be done wrong. Habits and Just-This-Onces are accumulative, and these are the results of a long-term study. One he had no idea he was doing, but here he is anyway.
Lord Stark bared a tight smile. "I am not my father," he returned sharply. "And I would like to offer you a place in the Iron Guard, as long as you promise to refrain from rendering them all useless to prove any future points you may see fit to prove, Miss…"
Looks like he’s going to be sporting a mark of ownership for the next week or so. Tony would pretend to be annoyed, but they both know he’s going to be flaunting it until someone will make him cover up because the implications apparently are too much for the gaggle of 12 year olds that the world calls Earth's Mightiest Heroes.
They were still far from the finish line – in the literal and figurative sense, seeing as Tony, for one, would only get to come once Steve would get to fuck him in earnest – but it wasn't as if anyone could even think to raise a complaint.
Yet somehow, it happened, and it kept happening, and it wouldn't stop happening. They had their ups and downs, probably more so than the regular couple, but Tony for one is giving them both a pass because they've got quite the shitload of baggage each but been putting the work in and coming out victorious regardless.
"So," Steve says, clearing his throat to break the silence. "What's Fury thinking about all this?"
have any time to spare, and Steve’ll be damned if he allows death to rip him out of his hands now of all times, by virtue of something so banal as blood loss or poisoning when he’s had to endure the worst of it already. Steve won’t allow it to happen. They made it this far; the suffering will pay off. It
And then, the body in his arms moves and his voice sounds like he hasn't been asleep for a while now. “I don’t care,” Tony snaps, and there’s some of that fire again. “I just wanted a choice, Steve. You didn’t even think it appropriate to let me get a word in before you put me on the fucking chopping block.” He spits out the last few words, and Steve just about has it in him not to flinch.
In hindsight, Tony thinks he should’ve known.
It’s a word Steve has often been on the receiving end of coming from Tony, and on any other day, it would lead to a half-hearted argument that ultimately deescalates into bickering for the sake of it. But today is far from an ordinary day, and Tony’s voice has lost any airy lightheartedness it ever carried, familiarity replaced with fear in the face of Steve’s countenance and what it will be forever associated with in his mind.
He puts his gear down by one wall and observes Tony as he throws his own backpack onto the counter at the back, proceeding to browse through the various cupboards and otherwise promising looking furniture. The few scraps he finds he pockets securely in his rucksack, and when he’s done stripping the place for all its worth, he grabs his water bottle to first take a few generous gulps and then clean off the worst of the blood.
you want to protect him, I get it. But if Tony Stark has orchestrated a secret experiment to kidnap Captain America from another dimension and is now trying to pass off his appearance as a mere coincidence, I need to know."
Carol was hard pressed to admit that her words held truth. Lord Stark may rule over his land with genuine kindness and treated all its people like equals, but with that there unfortunately came no guarantee of safety or extended leniency for deeds frowned upon within its borders.
So, with Steve being
“Well?”
She only paused for a moment before her feet carried her toward one of the rooms, at the entrance of which she promptly remained frozen in place. Unable to avert her eyes from the sight she was greeted by, Carol observed.
Maybe to someone else that would be frightening, carrying a love to this devastating extent, but Tony and he have always been more. And if there’s something Steve won’t ever come to regret, it’s loving wholly and truly.
Things change when Steve gets to the uncomfortable part. He’s only halfway into explaining how their Tony decided to experiment with the scepter without so much as informing or consulting the team when the Tony present cuts in.
Steve keeps his promises–that much he should know by now. They've been acquainted with each other for a while, after all.
Rogers has put up a makeshift tent, a large cloth that is strung up on the trees above and the main purpose of which seems to be giving the impression of shelter rather than actually providing some. Tony can think of a few ways to improve it, but he doesn't take action. It wouldn’t matter anyway anyway, because the temperatures don't allow for sleep to come, tent and fire or no.
“Not like I planned it,” he shrugs.
It's scary to a degree, because in the end, this is testament to the grip Steve has on him, the power he has over his emotions and the ease with which he could turn that against him. Tony only entertains that thought for a moment, and then he makes the conscious decision to abandon it because he loves Steve and he
"Your mother?"
Above him, Steve smiles. The claws of the device hug the reactor, and the voice that comes out of his mouth is Obadiah's, "The golden goose had one more egg to give."
At the crusted blood sticking to the corner of his mouth, at the long eyelashes brushing his cheeks and the lack of them on the damaged side of his face, at the gray in his hair and the faded laugh lines around his eyes.
Thinking about possible outcomes naturally also comes with another, rather unpleasant realization: if the Tesseract doesn’t magically return him to the world it’s taken him from on its own, he’s stranded here for good. Tony probably wouldn’t hesitate to tamper with the thing, but Steve has a feeling the risk wouldn’t be worth it. There might not be an army of Chitauri anymore, but he very much wants to avoid any repetition of that time SHIELD tinkered with the Stone back in 2012 and unleashed Loki on an unsuspecting New York. They have better understanding of it now and
"What're you doing?" Tony croaks, tracking his movements.
for a while now.
Twice.
Feeling clammy, he pushes the blanket off of himself, draping it over the armrest of the chair. Then, he pauses. Blanket. Which blanket?
It was nothing but sheer luck that Bruce Banner's travels had led him to Hattam on the day the Lord's messenger rode up to the town square and announced that they would be hearing out applicants for the position.
Tony stills. Thinks. After, he turns around, scoops up some water with his non-trapped hand and unceremoniously splashes it into Steve's expressionless face.
The knight uttered a sound of surprise. He’d already assumed the man was not hailing from Mar’vill, but it was only now that he was able to fully place his accent. “Well, I presume thanks are in order, then. I understand you are from around here?”
But the sky he’s looking at is dark and veiled in clouds, and Tony
A wizard steps out of a glowing portal and Tony thinks that maybe he should’ve stayed inside.
"You want, uh, water? OJ? Multivitamin? Cherry? Any fruit juice at all, really, you name it. Or– something alcoholic? I don't think I– There's beer, if you want. You
He does an inventory of the various aches in his body–there’s his ass, for one, but his hips and waist and shoulder are some of the main sources as well. He’s definitely marked as Steve’s now, that’s for sure. With an incredulous little chuckle, he pulls his sweats back up and hobbles up to the bathroom.
What? Steve isn't the only one with ulterior motives here. Today was supposed to be their night out, and Tony was very much looking forward to getting dinner, having a relaxed conversation with and simply enjoying the presence of his boyfriend all the while being constantly reminded of what will be waiting for him once they're home.
As he rides out his orgasm, he buries his face in Tony’s neck and places a kiss to his shoulder blade lazily. Tony hums happily into the pillow, reaches down to intertwine their hands once again, holding on as the first waves of a glorious afterglow wash over them.
ever since Tony removed a spring and his fingers nearly got caught in the jaws of the thing. God knows another injury is the last thing they need now. Leaving Tony to his own devices requires a lot of willpower, because Steve would much rather do it himself than have his gut twist uncomfortably every time the man gets parts of himself in potentially hazardous places. With proper instructions, Steve could probably get the issue resolved in a minute or two, but that isn’t what this is about anymore, not really.
Steve’s in a uniform that looks like it hasn’t been in the wash or patched up in a hot minute. There’s a smudge of dirt across his clean-shaven cheek. His expression, though mostly smooth and neutral, says he feels put out about something or other. And his voice, now that Tony replays the words in his head, sounded more piqued than playful.
Bruce instructed the man lay him out on the raised cot on the far side of the room so he could determine how much damage was done. As he carefully unwrapped the bandages, Anthony squirming with discomfort, he looked at Rogers still on the other side of the table and inquired, "How did this happen?"
"I'm so beautiful for you, Steve, just you," he moans, and it takes nothing more to make the other man lose himself, his movements erratic as he crowds Tony into the mattress.
Except – when he's climbed up the ladder, Steve hears him, clothes rustling, breathing hard and sounding broken little gasps that are probably suppressed whimpers. He smells him, too, and it's not the scent that carries everywhere but the one you just get up close, arousal spicy-sweet with musk underneath that Steve knows means he's wet and dripping with it.
He wouldn’t have minded staying awake, really.
Thanos, the tyrant called himself, a giant of eight feet in height and almost half as wide at that. James had assumed his flaming sword to be nothing more but a silly rumor, but as they came to a stop upon a hill above the swamplands, he could make out the madman in the midst of the battle, slashing left and right with a blade engulfed in flames that was nearly as tall as himself.
and the paint on the exterior is chipping, worn down by weather and time. However, all this is secondary information to the one characteristic that catches Steve’s attention and that he knows has made Tony pick this place above all other readily available ones–there are no windows. No windows, and the gate is sturdy, able to hold back a great number of bodies and even more when reinforced from the inside.
He's entirely unclothed, his all layers abandoned at the foot of the mattress. His skin is flushed and glistening with sweat, erection having taken on a purplish color and curving against his stomach. One of his hands is shoved between his legs and the other in his face, clamped between his teeth to keep the noise at bay. His hair sticks to his forehead and doesn't even stir when he whips his head around, gaze frantic until he determines who's just invaded his privacy.
go a little over her head still, Stark genes or no. Steve doesn't know how anyone could have a conversation like this in a way that'd make a kindergartener understand.
Something heady flutters with excitement in his stomach; just a moment, just an
Steve hums in agreement, signaling his understanding as he presses a last kiss just underneath Tony's jaw and then comes up again. Tony blinks at him, tilting his head a little to study the man above him. Steve is still going steady, rhythm an impeccable pattern that you'd probably be able to measure with a metronome.
He allows himself to think it now: this was an act of love. A cruel one, but who’s ever thought love to be tender and selfless? At its core, love is an ugly, feral thing. Selfish, too–Tony isn’t wrong about that. But if he’s lucky, he’ll get the rest of his life to prove to Tony that it can be much more than this. It can be more than this (blood, flesh, bone) because it
Nervous tension leaves the man in a shuddering breath. Steve hurriedly sheds his coat and then swings one leg up next to him, nudging him to make his intentions known. Stark moves over, but he's still taking up too much space with his legs spread apart and, well, they'll have to change things up in any case. The bunks here– missionary just doesn’t work that well.
Steve nods stiffly, and he continues.
"Is this everything? Have you– asked for this before and I rejected you? Because I cannot recall for the life of me."
Once everyone's dealt with, he makes to move toward Stark's sleeping quarters – and is promptly held back by Donna, who looks at him with a tight-lipped expression and motions for him to settle.
Nothing can distract him from the miserable condition of his existence anymore. Every waking minute is filled with the echoes of thoughts about one of two things: water or salvation. Sometimes, he dreads both. What if he lives? What if he dies? What if it doesn’t make a difference either way?
And Steve is
When he sees the arrangement of the six stones buried in Tony's armor, Steve realizes what he has to do.
The man appeared stunned for a moment, but chuckled in amusement and then took her hand when she offered it for a handshake. His grip was firm but not uncomfortably so, and the thoughts reflected in his eyes were of the opposite nature than Hammer's had been, who had brimmed with judgment and disdain for her people.
Steve's frozen in place and observes with gradually widening eyes as the other man leans closer, slow enough to think it through, slow enough to give him an out. Slow enough for both of them to realize what's happening long before their lips meet.
Of days when love was true
, and it hadn't mattered how slow or careful he'd gone because Tony would be too tense and wound too tight for them to really get anywhere. It was never going to work unless he was relaxed to the point of being completely boneless, but super-soldier or no, Steve only had the two hands and he'd always go between working Tony open and trying to comfort him at the same time, which just wasn't enough.
"Who--
He figures Tony’s given him the benefit of the doubt until the moment he picks up the knife–and he can hear the wooden handle groan with the force of his grip–because it’s only then that his expression truly transforms into one of pure, unadulterated terror, an emotion that washes over Steve colder like the ice once did those many lifetimes ago.
Tony gasps as he comes down and finds Steve shallowly fucking into him, riding out the last waves of pleasure. His pulse is still knocking against his throat and there's a pleasant blur to his sight, a little bit of cotton softening the edges of his every sensation. He groans as Steve slips out, and blinks in wonder at the lacking trickle of spunk he's been expecting.
Is this what your life flashing in front of your eyes looks like? Because if so, it's a lot more anti-climactic than he'd hoped it'd be.
Point being, they studied those paintings together and came to the conclusion that they weren’t perfect. Masterpieces, sure, but there’s no true golden standard that every single one of them can be compared and held up to because that’s just… not how art works. (Tony is pretty sure there's a metaphor about ideals of beauty somewhere in there.)
) but he realizes the feelings are useless and trivial at this point. Tony forgave him. Tony is gone.
It's decided that three of them should be enough to get the job done quickly without getting in each other's way, and so with a last moment of heavy silence, they leave the room.
“These stay on,” Steve tells him, resolute. Stark is about to open his mouth – probably to argue that, well, he could blow them all up like this too, so what’s the difference anyway – but Steve doesn’t allow him to get a word in.
Never let it be said that Tony Stark doesn't go the extra mile and/or is cheap.
A deafening rumble from above shocks the both of them out of their embrace. They tumble backward, jumping apart, bemused at the sight of their surroundings.
Tony grins – definitely earnest and most likely raunchy – as he looks up to get a look of actual Steve and not just his reflection. There's things the mirror just doesn't manage to capture. The heated gleam in his baby blues, the shade of his lips, the tinge of pink high up on his cheekbones.
His being turns staccato, his lips twitch, hiding a laugh or a sob. The metronome gets stuck halfway to horizontal, loses the secure
He leans in for a kiss, winding his arms around Steve's neck as he does. It's slow and intimate but ultimately innocent, and he backs off a bit to see Steve look back at him with a fond little crook to his lips that makes his eyes crinkle.
Maybe he's spotted the not-tears in Tony's eyes, or the way he's frowning at his too-big reflection in the too-big mirror, or just the cloud of general misery hanging in the room that is concentrated especially densely in Tony's vicinity.
Tony is alone.
claw its way up his windpipe and past his lips. This would just be the cherry on top, wouldn't it? Crying like a hysterical high-school girl at prom night because he doesn't look the way he imagined he would.
animated and explicit tales of how Asgardian warriors would celebrate their victories in battle had caught the rest of them a little off guard to say the least.
Steve chuckles and lets him have the last word.
Steve produces another handy gadget from his arsenal, bends over Stark who's still indulging in the sweet relief of air, and grabs a tuft of the man's hair to forcibly expose his neck. Once he jams the small needle into the skin, Stark jerks away and falls onto his back, flailing as his strained muscles fail to keep up.
It was a tall man, with bright hair and a shortsword in a sheath swinging from his hip. The steel blue chestplate identified him as one of the castle’s knights that had previously stood guard at the hall’s entrance.
He's figured it out.
He swallows, licks his lips. Have his eyes been burning the whole time?
was a lesson. This is something else. Maybe it’s the universe’s good intentions gone bad; maybe there was an attempt to make something right, to bring two lost souls together through a glitch in the matrix.
The glare Tony shoots him is probably supposed to come off as chiding, but the willful curl of his lip gives his amusement away.
With the next sign of no, James felt at a loss. Only… He hesitated, taking in the picture of his friend's clenched jaw and downcast eyes. There was a possibility that revealing this to him would only serve to upset him more, but he could not simply leave it at just that. Anthony was visibly hurting, and he would be damned if he did not try to ascertain what was troubling him with all his might.
Believe it or not, Tony isn't actually so vain as to check out his reflection every other day, and even less so with all clothes off. Especially out here, in front of the large, floor-to-ceiling mirror next to their walk-in closet, he'll be much more often caught only having a brief, final look at himself before leaving. It usually happens before events that call for a more fancy dress code, and he'll give everything (tie, collar, cufflinks, shirt buttons, jacket fit, pant seams, shoe polish, hair, face, ass) a quick once-over to make sure all's in order and ready to go.
. Right. Tony snorts.
She spoke only to Maria, whom she returned home to as night fell. Her lover and wife-at-heart greeted her with a kiss almost as soft as her smile, and she could read Carol like any open book.
He rips the arc reactor off his chest and presses it into Steve's palm in a gesture that tells so much more than words ever will and causes Steve’s heart to shrivel and morph into something ugly inside his ribcage.
At first glance, it appears unchanged. It's been a while since the ceremony they held for Tony, but he remembers that day as if it was just hours ago. Courtesy of his eidetic memory. Or maybe that very event driving home the reality of Tony's death was what made the memory stick to his thoughts like duct tape; it could've been both, for all Steve knows.
This is so different and dirty and wrong that Tony almost comes right then, when Steve's length drags past his prostate and the pain enmeshes with a sudden surge of pleasure.
Time isn’t, because Earth comes into view in what could only have been hours. It’s unreal. This blue, blue planet is the most beautiful sight Tony has ever had the fortune of laying his eyes on.
"It took us some time, or, well. It took
Tony lies there so very still and quiet he could’ve been gone with the wind had they not all already been by his side.
Rogers has just bid him a goodnight and disappeared upstairs, and that last tendon of restraint in Tony snaps.
"How're ya feelin'?"
A stranger in the saloon catches Tony's eye. Everything kind of snowballs from there.
Tony should’ve left, then, but he’s never been one to listen to the
Except, Steve doesn’t let him.
No single man wanted to be handed a poorly balanced sword and turned into laughing stock in front of the whole guard during a sword fight amongst the best of them.
That space he carved out for Steve is tainted now–wrong, it's all wrong, everything is
James was positive this was the first time Anthony had been caught quite so unawares by someone else’s words. It was amusing to witness.
Inferiority in numbers and armament he can excuse, negligence and ignorance less so. Their writing appears intentionally vague however, so it's to be expected they'll fall into the latter category. Which presents him with a host of additional problems, most of which related to the blood in this suit he's supposed to be wearing for their visitor later this evening.
Steve's barely visible, satisfied smile tells him he's been waiting for his resolve to break. What a vicious, evil, cruel man. And he wants to marry that guy. Yeah, Tony's a bit of a masochist, who knew? Everyone he's ever shared a bed with, sure, but that's not the point.
The ensuing silence drags on for the better part of ten seconds. Tony glances at the clock on the screen, about to remark that 1 am isn't late enough to justify the silent treatment, and then recalls that JARVIS couldn’t respond even if ordered to. Tony sighs and rubs his eyes, the burnt skin on the back of his hand pulling uncomfortably. Someone should remind him not to play with fire without J around to babysit.
Tony wonders whether there's a place like hell, and if this is it.
“I love you,” Tony says through a sigh of defeat, his voice no more than a whisper but so entirely earnest Steve’s heart clenches.
Strange, to have the thought of
"Whatever you want, sweetheart," he answered, smile maybe a little too fond for the salacious things that had happened and would be happening. He looked pointedly at Clint, who snorted when Steve added, "I aim to please."
be the conversational topic is taking a lot out of him. Steve already knows he's going to cave eventually and feels the heady thrill of wanton anticipation zap through him at the thought.
"Nothing, big guy. Just… thinking."
Maria is the first to come bolting into the room, barely even taking note of him as she makes a beeline for the refrigerator. She now seems to have accepted his presence without so much as a moment's hesitation, which is a huge step forward from the distrust he's been faced yesterday. Steve files that away as a positive development for the moment.
Once dawn broke, their small party packed up and prepared for departure. It was then that James once again found himself in the presence of Steven Rogers, whom had resided in their camp ever since the battle.
more, runs deeper by nature.
The look Bucky shoots him is especially sceptical, and everyone argues over whether or not it's a good idea to let him go alone (it probably isn't) but in the end, Steve puts his foot down. He's going to get it over with, one way or another.
" Tony heaves out, breath uneven, unable to hold off any longer.
It was rough, frantic and without doubt more about creating an outlet for their feelings and frustrations than it was about the sex. Tony ended up bent over the conference table, fingernails scraping over the surface and scrambling for purchase while Steve shoved him up against it.
Tony comes first, his spine bowing in pleasure. The metal gleams beautifully in the light overhead. Steve follows.
This might just be the least shocking development this evening, he thinks, a little giddy. His doctors, nosy SHIELD medical staff and even Pepper told him it would happen if he kept going the way he did. He expected his heart to protest his lifestyle sooner or later. But never like this. Nothing in the world could've prepared him for this.
She shoves the sheets of paper into his hands, and Tony grabs both and regards them in turn, silence dragging longer as he studies them and Maria shifts on her feet in anticipation of his reaction.
Spring in Italy comes with pleasant warmth: the days are slow, the weather is magnificent and his company–Steve and then
Steve is about to inquire what she's referring to, but she goes on to elaborate on her own. "Papa always said the same thing," she grumbles. "I thought maybe you might be smart like Daddy."
She would not hear of his grievances; his mother, a wet nurse, had been entrusted with Lady Maria’s infant son, and there was no dismissing the honor which lay in caring for the Stark heir. With his mother making for a vital role in the Stark household, they enjoyed many privileges; early mealtimes, warm baths every third day and an expansive bedchamber all for themselves were novelties few of the castle's staff would ever experience.
They would have to repeat it come another day, but he decided to let this sobering information go unmentioned for the time being. He moved to the adjoining room to store away his remedies, taking inventory of the ingredients left as he did.
It felt uncharacteristic for the Lord to go to these lengths to hold a formal renomination ceremony for the Captain of Guard, seeing as he typically refused to take part in all dated civility simply out of spite.
He did not bother to conceal his wonder; the unspoken language was quite remarkable. Everyone of importance was required to be taught in it, and Bruce did so with genuine delight. It was not after long that he began suggesting possible improvements of his own.
The Lord halted in his step, a sensible amount of distance still between them. He regarded her curiously, and his lip twitched as if he did not know whether to smile.
They already took the arc reactor, what more could they want? (Lips against his neck, an ache deep inside and the bruises on his hips remind him:
Steve, surprised at the sudden emergence of Tony's voice, turns around to see Tony standing in the doorway to his bedroom, fingers wrapped around the edge of the frame in a white-knuckled grip.
Everything narrows down to the simple reality that
Between the pillars of the archway, a gust of sand grains carried by the winds beginning to pick up velocity transforms into a vortex of white and blinding light. With a flash, the movement ceases, sand raining onto the ground and revealing the shape of a… woman.
"Well, I may have overestimated my abilities a tad and consequently been thrown off that devil of a horse during a, uh, vault over the river," he allowed, eyes narrowing when Rogers lifted his eyebrows urging him to go on. "I
Why Steve? Why does he hold that romanticized image of Tony's person when actual perfection is looking back at him from the mirror every day? That's a severe case of rose-colored glasses. If anything, he's the one out of the two of them that should be told all these things.
Or rather, Tony
Tony opens his mouth, stunned, and closes it again when the other man promptly goes back to his drawing. He bites his tongue. The man's devilishly handsome, intriguing
Still, the physician had no use for bystanders whose only purpose was to further trouble his patients, whatever the reason or however they may relate to one another.
from day one, but he would've never thought them ending up in this position was even a possibility – there's millions of reasons why it shouldn't have been.
Tony doesn't say so, because Steve doesn't like to hear these things no matter that they're joking in nature, and he figures he probably wouldn't manage much but incoherent babble anyway. He instead enjoys the glide of Steve's mouth around him, all-encompassing when he swallows every last inch and teasing when he licks stripes along his shaft and over the tip.
Then, there was Steve and him, and if Tony thought there was one thing more unlikely than a wormhole opening up and an alien army coming down upon New York, this was, without any last shred of doubt, it.
Until the very moment she found herself at the full attention of the subject of her scrutiny, that was.
Steve drops the weapon, the impact upon the hardwood louder than it has any right to be. Tony twitches, but his gaze follows it to the floor and then travels back up to Steve, who does his level best to remain still.
She grins. “Guess what?”
“Your scars are beautiful,” Steve says, his breath a fluttering caress over the marred, ugly skin. Tony shudders for no particular reason, swallows as he returns his gaze that is as earnest and loving as it is blue.
In the same way he's been nonchalant about the rest of it, like they've done all this a hundred times before, Steve also doesn't glance at the wet spot Tony's cried into his shirt or acknowledge the mortification coloring his face a dusky red after the deed is done.
Usually, he’d go out of his way to make sure Stark’s secured and restrained even in his sleep; he’s still an outcast first-class to most of the eyes and ears around here and the people don’t like knowing he’s running around freely. After all, it’s not his place: he hasn’t earned it, hasn’t gone through the months of hunger and horror that everybody in the tail end remembers but doesn’t speak of, a nightmare endured in silence.
"You're allowed to be. Sorry. I didn't think it was gonna be that much," he answers, and he does sound sorry. A little guilty, almost.
Their gasps and the wet slap of their bodies, the slide eased by Steve’s copious amounts of come, are the symphony of their pleasure, a filthy thing that makes Tony think
Lord Stark was a man of olive skin, raven hair and not very much taller than her. It was with a frankly large portion of astonishment that Natasha caught sight of his right hand, all scar tissue and long since healed burns.
"I'm sorry this happened to you, alright? Parallel universes fucking suck. If there's a way for you to get back, we'll find it. But I can't–I can't have you here. You–"
But Steve has no intention of hurting Tony like this, today. He just wants to make it good. It is the morning of a fateful day, after all.
When he looks at Tony, there must be something in his eyes, because Tony clenches his jaw and avoids his gaze, looks at the floor. His dark lashes brush his cheeks as he looks down. God, he's pretty. (Objectively speaking. Epitome of objectivity, right here.)
Stark's fingers have a clawed grip on the ground below, his face resolutely pressed into the dirt to ensure Steve won't be able to see him or his possibly telling facial expressions. What he doesn't seem to be aware of is that to be regarded with this fierce defiance is more satisfying than any of these other, minor details could ever be.
Rogers hangs his head and huffs a breath, not a scoff but not a simple exhale either.
Then, they leave.
Tony can't help but scoff. "Whoever we're dealing with here had no problem getting undetected into the 82nd floor of one of the safest buildings on Earth. Do we really think a lock is going to keep them out?"
As afternoon blends into evening, crickets chirp and seagulls cry. Some nights, they find a bite to eat in a cozy restaurant in a sleepy, little town nearby. The staff is always delighted to find him ordering in fluent Italian, Steve loves to watch him have animated exchanges with them, and the food takes Tony back to the brighter days of his childhood. More often than not though, they'll stay in, cooking and existing just by themselves. Night falls quickly and fireflies swarm the patch of wildflowers next to the patio, their lights mingling with the bright dots of faraway neighborhoods on the other side of the coast.
“Steve–honey, ah– “ He trails off into a moan. “I need–I need you to–“
Steve nods. “I’ll see what we can do about that,” he says, and points at Stark’s makeshift workstation in front of the operations room when he’s regarded with an inquisitive gaze. “Keep going.”
His back is pressed flush against Steve’s front, no space left between them except during those little instances when his hips hitch forward an inch or two, only to come back pushing against Steve’s groin again.
Tony makes a mental note to not make the mistake of underestimating the man's unfailing ability to prove even God himself wrong.
Once he isn't preoccupied with the repeat action of lifting the fork, chewing and swallowing anymore, Tony returns Steve's not-so-clandestine glances. "What is it?" he asks in between two swigs of red, his lips hitching upward when Steve blinks and clears his throat, almost a little bashful.
Why the Lord considered it his duty to host these men whose favorite pastime was taking his name in vain, Natalia could not determine for the life of her.
He nods. It’s not like he knows much about childbirth, especially in this world that continues to defy all limitations he’s ever thought the human body had, but he supposes it would make sense, for someone of Tony’s age and medical record. Or, well– Steve has no way of knowing if that applies to this Tony too, but he’d wager it does, seeing as the events in both their timelines are largely similar.
Biting his lip–and biting it bloody–Tony rises back up, feeling Steve’s gaze burning holes into his skin. (There’s the matchbox.) The back of his neck heats with a pleasant shade of humiliation that comes from being watched in one’s pleasure.
Steve doesn't know what he needs. A
Steve chuckles, but the noise gets stuck in his throat when Tony finally turns to him, his expression devoid of humor. "I can't convince her to stay in her room forever. She already knows something's up,” he says, scratching the back of his head.
If Steve thought he'd known bliss before, he was wrong.
timeline. He's still not entirely in the picture about the extent of the space stone's powers, and considering what it once did to the Skull, the possibilities seem virtually endless.
Steve pushes the response that comes to mind away, swallows the words on his tongue before he gets the chance to voice them.
"We agreed, right?" Steve speaks up suddenly, words cutting through the quiet. When Tony looks up at him, he exhales a long breath that turns into small clouds of steam in the cold. "Whatever it takes, Tony."
," he says quietly, voice choked with tears.
His voice has dropped a few octaves, and Tony has to swallow. His own cock is at half-mast, standing against his thigh untouched.
Anthony was glaring daggers at Sir Steven but did not respond, opting to allow his body previously propped up on his forearms fall back onto the cot, energy reserves leaving him through a shuddering exhale. With a grimace accentuating the lines in his face and sweat slicking his hair to his forehead, he looked even worse for wear.
He stuffs the flask back into his saddlebags and throws a look over his shoulder, casting a glance at Rogers who's sitting on a tree stump on the other side of their small camp. They've put it up a sensible distance from the herd at a row of pines that provides some shelter from the wind and allows their fire to keep burning.
After she had sent young Monica to sleep – her daughter of eight years only obeying after having a thorough exchange with Carol about her day's work and the mean boy from the fish market – Maria inquired what was on her mind, a hand on Carol's thigh and another caressing a cheek as they lay in their shared bed.
How's he going to make up for all that? Tony's head is reeling as he goes through everything they've planned for the near future. Maybe they can squeeze in a spontaneous trip to a private island of his. He'll even let Steve choose which one, and then he can take that opportunity to hopefully make Steve forget about this whole incident in whichever way the man may want him to.
The Captain of the Guard was a straight-faced, level-headed and at times almost unpleasant man, but nothing and no-one could match his sense of duty or escape his watchful eye, not even a snipe snake hidden away in the undergrowth. He was nothing if not a master strategist, his mind half a dozen steps ahead at all times and his title most deserved.
Having arrived at the hut, they dismount. Rogers looks at him briefly over their horses' backs, his hands still gripping the saddle.
As soon as his attention was called for, however, he looked up at the King, imposing in his dark robes and strongly contrasting crown. He was sure he would find out soon enough why it was that Anthony wore a satisfied smile and the King a mildly disgruntled expression.
Without another word exchanged, they make for the door. Steve levers it open almost effortlessly with the crowbar Tony hands him without having to be told, their work as seamless and efficient as ever even (especially) with a threat breathing down their necks. Being outnumbered and in over their heads has never stopped them before, and it isn’t bound to now.
While Tony, more frantically than he likes to admit, rummages for his flask in Butterfingers' bags, Rogers comes back up to standing and approaches from the side. His nose wrinkles minimally as he watches Tony take two, three, four gulps from the beverage. Tony catches himself on the last one and wipes his mouth with the back of his hand. Rogers, who is somehow looking impartial but also judgemental, is regarded with a narrow-eyed look.
She had joined to dine with the Lords and Ladies in the great hall of the Iron Castle upon request of Lord Rhodes.
"What about the reservati–"
After a minute, Maria has emptied her bowl and jumps back up, almost tripping over her own feet as she speeds off down the hallway. Steve's really getting curious about this boat thing now. He asks Tony, who's still intently focused on the coffee machine but swiftly turns toward him upon hearing his voice.
It takes him a second to spot the bruises – they’ve mostly faded like the rest, but they’re there, splotches of yellow in the vague shape of handprints against olive skin, and the implications make Steve pause. Only for a moment in time, though, because it’s not something he wants to think about and it definitely isn’t something Stark will want to talk about, so he shoves the thought aside, locking it away with so many others that came before it.
Some men take this display of fear as cue to break out of the rows and finally pounce at the man, who hisses and curses and does everything in his power (kick, bite) to keep a hold of his one last possession: dignity. The stink of his distress is thick in the air, only increasing in potency with every passing second. Steve decides to put an end to it.
Steve seems to see that too, because he chuckles and hangs his head in (temporary) defeat. He's quick to look back up though, and the tight, determined line between his brows hasn't faded. It's maybe even more prominent now, after Tony's used his wording to try and strip the moment of gravity.
Something in his voice has shifted, his attention turned inward, contemplating. Tony can't place it, the sudden change in the atmosphere, but it has him shoving all his
He nodded. “Yes, thankfully.” James outstretched his hand for a formal introduction, “Sir James Rhodes, Iron Guard.”
He sits up, puts his book away and takes the offered pages from her hands. After he's skimmed through them, the thing he's feared from the get-go proves true: this goes over his head. Sure, he gets the baser concepts, but he doesn't know where he'd start to test these calculations for their mathematical accuracy.
Most of it is easy to comprehend. Some of the very scientific segments that talk about additional chromosomes and pheromone communication go over his head somewhat, but he definitely gets the basics. There’s some parts that describe certain reproductive organs and their functions in great detail and Steve fights off the blush that threatens to creep up his neck. He’d probably die of mortification if Tony decided to return and find him turning pink because he got an explicit lecture on the birds and the bees.
Steve sits up, rubbing the sleep out of his eyes with mild surprise. He didn't expect to sleep through to sunrise, but it must be around six in the morning already, seeing as fall has the days getting shorter and shorter at a rapid pace.
"I need a second opinion from you, JARVIS. Are we dealing with a Steve Rogers here, yes or no?"
As much as it hurts to draw a line in the sand, it's for both of their combined sanity.
Steve nods and motions for Tony to lead the way. He seems glad not to be forced to continue their conversation any longer, which Steve can’t really blame him for. This isn’t how anyone would want to spend their day off.
Tony sounded a choked-off groan somewhere up top, and Steve redirected his attention to rub a hand down his side, coming over to stroke up his heaving back. "You're so gorgeous like this, Tony," he told him, voice coarse. "My fella, doing so well. 'm so proud of you."
"I want to be right here. With you. Right now.
But there is more, he can tell by the tone, so he remains silent. Everything he can do is listen, for once, after he has failed to do so before.
As gently as possible, he pries Tony's hand off the wound dressing. The resistance is minimal, not because Tony doesn't want to escape his hold with all he is, but because he doesn't have the strength to do so. Struggling seems to have drained him of what little energy he had; the fight leaves him, his body slumps and his eyes squeeze close as if he is surrendering to whatever he thinks Steve'll do next.
gulps in the way he seems to treat many things including his privileges as a free man. Greed is a disease that deserves to be expunged. His chest is heaving violently as his heart and lungs–both presumably mechanical–work at transporting oxygenated blood back into the deprived areas of his body.
needed.
The Steve who belongs in this universe; who's died like his Tony has. (It's not that he needs to remind himself of that fact. He thinks of it every day)
“This is just for you,” Steve says, meeting Tony's backside with a push of his hips. “Always. Just you. You do this to me, Tony.”
have a knack for the arts," he grins. "But, you know, I– don't think l'll be able to go with you next year."
A gust of pulverized drywall sends his lungs into a coughing fit and his mind to a sandstorm in the Afghani desert. His heart and airways compete for the number one place on the pedestal: for just a moment, it's a tie between them, both equal sources of agony.
The young knight would have not much cared for the passing of the old Lord had it not been for Anthony’s beloved mother, who had sat and died right at her husband’s side.
this was an acid trip. Would leave a hell of a lot less questions unanswered."
A vivid image of the Red Skull’s ghostly form flashes in front of his eyes, and Steve shakes his head quietly to himself. No.
"That is not a no," Tony points out, helpfully.
He moves forward and puts a hand on Peter’s shoulder as he pushes past him. When he kneels down next to Tony's unmoving form, Steve chokes back a sob at the sight of him; seeing it from afar is different. Half of his face and neck is singed, the skin open and blistered. The armor seems to have melted and merged to accommodate the Stones – it's scorched all the way up his arm, the red and gold indistinguishable.
Thing is, he's always liked most parts of himself. Sure, he's had to come to terms with the arc reactor and successive scarring, and about every other dude wants another inch or two on his dick, but all in all, Tony's been fine with what's been looking back at him from the mirror.
Steve stifles a yawn then and there, but stays awake to see Tony’s back rise and fall with each breath and tread his fingers through the dark strands of his hair that’s streaked with silver and curling at the ends.
, Tony tells himself, and he’ll get to drink again. It has to be like this, or there won’t be any left at all tomorrow. The tomorrow that doesn’t exist here, because they don’t have a point of reference like planetary rotation as they are, floating on this spaceship that Tony is starting to despise.
His stomach lurches because he thinks,
“You didn’t answer my question,” she states, unimpressed by his awkward attempts at explanation.
The procedure doesn't differ from how he's handled the other stones, but then, right as he's about to put it in its original spot, something
Grim determination threw dark shadows across the ridges in his face and when he pulled his helm's visor down, their eyes locked, silent gazes speaking all the words they could not say.
He should know that, shouldn't he? Steve shouldn't have to tell him that. And he does know, he is in possession of the objective knowledge that relationships are about people and not about whether you're in the same league aesthetically because it's a relationship and
Steve sighs contently as he sneaks an arm up Tony’s chest, placing his hand over the spot his heartbeat is strongest. He buries his nose in the crook of Tony’s neck and breathes in, tries to somehow burn the distinct smell into his memory. He’d keep and preserve every sensation if he could; Tony’s scent, the feeling of his heartbeat, his skin against Steve’s.
Steve bursts into laughter behind him.
Within seconds, they're on the bed, Steve gently guiding him onto his back. Tony's patience snaps as he watches Steve settle between his legs, still fully (unfairly) clothed. He's being deprived of his rights here, and that just won't do.
It's nothing like a heat. He's not running hot, he's not writhing in his sheets, sweating and soaking wet in more than one sense. He can be around people without stinking the whole room up. His scent changes, but only the alphas notice, and even Hill walks a little closer when she bumps into him in the hangar one afternoon.
One day, Tony catches him reading the sequel to the ghostwhisperer book and, clearly suppressing a smirk, suggests he order something Steve might actually want to read. But the thing is, Steve likes it. Not just the book but all of it, this whole bookcase with its strange, cobbled-together assortment of genres. It's like – the quote from that movie, with books instead of the box of chocolates. Never know what you're gonna get.
The other man uncrosses his arms and heaves a long-suffering sigh, shaking his head in defeat as he does. “Fine, so I’m gonna ask questions and you’ll just answer, how about that?”
There was a slap and a shrill, reactionary
He doesn’t know it, can’t remember ever having smelled something like it and yet it’s… doing things to his hindbrain. Something in him shifts, coiling tight and urgent in his gut as he, almost subconsciously, opens his mouth a fraction to inhale more of the smell and pander that sudden need for it within him.
He’s too busy blinking away the blur in his eyes to be self-conscious about the speed with which he flees the scene.
Although he tries to hide it, he's still noticeably hurting–his body and mind don't quite agree about the state of the limb that isn't anymore, and Tony finds himself in the crossfire most days. He bears it like the rest, with steely resolution that hardens the lines in his skin, and Steve admires him more every day.
. I wasn't dreaming."
He thought he would be different, when it came down to it. Steve thought he'd hold onto his calm rationale even faced with his greatest nightmare, but it turns out he's still every bit as human and flawed as the rest of them. Maybe more so. After all, the serum enhances everything, good and bad. And Steve's devotion to Tony knows no bounds, but neither does the depravity that comes with it.
His very being strived against the prospect of causing Tony harm, and that was quite enough to make him stop his ministrations as soon as he heard a muffled, pained grunt uttered by the other man.
Tony bites his cheek and stores the bottle away again.
As it so happens, every man who spends his time in the company of drunken travellers, vagabonds and supposed outlaws eventually gets caught up in a bar fight, no matter whether he'd like a part of it or not. And as luck would have it, Tony's confronted with the worst of them, because although he isn't small by any means (maybe on the lower end of average in height), he is no match for the seven feet tall giant named Tommy who comes barging at him for no apparent reason but the fun of it.
Steve can't even think to protest – she's resourceful, that's a good trait to have. If Tony wants to make some notes on her work later, well, he'll have to get his own paper.
Something he
Tony nods and that's that. He moves to leave, and so Steve follows.
The man keeps running straight onward, and Steve has to admit he doesn’t know what he expected, but it wasn’t for Stark to jump right at the building blocking his way. It’s the miniature thruster embedded in his boots that gives him the edge to push himself back off the façade of the building, but the core strength lies in his own body. It’s an astonishing performance. He leaps right over Steve where he’s standing, rolls, and keeps on running.
Tony has never been in the habit of looking over his shoulder–paired with ignorance, that is what landed him in Afghanistan after all–and he would've never called himself paranoid. Overly invested in security, plagued by nightmares about an obscure threat from space and somewhat obsessed with keeping an eye on everything that happens everywhere? Yes. Paranoid, no.
She flops onto the sofa next to him and turns the sheets of paper in her hand around for him to see. Steve squints – advanced high school algebra, he'd say.
Even the act of balancing the bare steel on one's palms would require extreme caution and a certain
"Fucking
Romanoff plucks an unassuming piece of paper out of her pocket, feint-ruled and folded once. She slides it to him over the table. Steve nods, not having looked at it. "Consider it done."
If Tony dislikes how quickly she's taken to Steve, he doesn't show it. Maybe for his daughter's sake. She hasn't made it apparent that any of it weighs on her, this sudden involvement of his in their lives; children often cope differently with loss, so while it isn't surprising, it still makes Steve fear he might be doing something wrong for the whole duration of his time with them.
"She knows, Anthony! Gods, how are you not bothered by this?"
He automatically begins to shake his head to himself in response to Steve's words, small, almost unnoticeable movements that in spite of their nature don't go by Steve even for a moment, perceptive as he is.
Stark shudders, then tenses when Steve's fingers slip further down between his cheeks. Or tries to, since the muscle relaxant prevents him from doing much of anything but helplessly clench and unclench his little, furled hole.
It's yet another in a long series of repercussions that Steve knows he may never be fully forgiven for. But since he's already brought this upon Tony, he can at least handle it right.
"Yeah. It's, ah, Carbonell," Tony is quick to answer, aiming to snuff out any suspicions they might have. "Rogers figured I wasn't pulling my weight, hence here I am. Taking over new duties."
“–always will,” Steve finishes for him, lips twitching up and down as the pretend smile clings to the corners of his mouth with all its might but is overshadowed by the force of his breaking heart.
Tony keeps hiding and goes on a much-needed vacation to one of his numerous private islands. At least that's what his wonder-working PR team makes the public believe.
In the mornings, Tony drags himself into the kitchen. Steve will be there reading the paper and Tony will cast a glance at the ceiling. "I can confirm Captain Rogers is currently in the right place," JARVIS will say.
Then, in a placating tone of voice that seems to be his attempt at softening the blow, he says, "With all due respect, mister, but I think you might not be quite cut out for that sorta work. The weather can get pretty nasty, and with the terrain up there, it ain't exactly what you'd call hazard-free."
It's Tony. Tony, whose mouth falls open and whose eyes widen comically when he catches his gaze. When their eyes lock, he stumbles backward, pushed by an invisible force. As if he's seen a ghost. Or a dead man walking.
Through the deafening screams, he hears them, more and more zombies gathering outside the door and demanding entrance. The blood makes it worse, Steve knows; they're drawn to it like sharks. It’s welling up in fountains of crimson from Tony’s arm, the same way the tears do from his eyes, so much so he can’t tell where exactly he’s made the previous incisions.
brushing his hardened nipple and hearing Steve’s sharp intake of air.
Steve opens his mouth, but Tony holds up a hand and his jaw snaps close again. “I get you don’t get it. It’s difficult to– Look, uh, there’s a lot of science involved JARVIS is gonna get into later, so just– take my word for it right now.”
It's dark out.
The other man hums in approval, one hand trailing up to rub over his sternum and then reaching over to twist one of his nipples with just enough pressure to hover on the threshold to pain. It's delicious, especially once his other hand travels down his abdomen and starts rubbing over his stomach while deliberately avoiding Tony’s hard-on.
Anyway – it's serene out here, with the lake, the winds stirring the almost barren trees and the sing-song of the birds that gradually dwindles as many of them travel south as fall progresses.
damnit, and he needs something to hold onto, but apparently the whole frenzy has made him forget where in human anatomy the asshole is located because he can't get Steve's dick inside–
Only for a few moments, because then Steve pulls out, and Tony wrinkles his nose at the sensation of come trickling back out with it. Thoughtful as he is, Steve has collected the butt plug from where they abandoned it on the bed, and makes to push it back inside. Tony gasps as the cool material stretches the oversensitized ring of muscle at his entrance.
There's hands everywhere, voices in his ear, close, overlapping. One of the blurry shapes emerges from the mass. The man leans close and his hand comes up to lay over the arc reactor, and Tony’s heart pounds violently against his ribcage at the idea of being robbed of the device keeping it alive.
Steve gives an affirmative. They agreed upon this already and besides, they both know there's no real possibility that particular scenario will come to pass. Even if it did, Steve would have her out before they could pluck a single fingernail.
Anthony saw him off with a grin bright as the early morning sun, although his arm must have still hurt as he waved him off.
Clint, perched on Steve's other side and immediately obliging by Bruce's request, was a lot less subtle about his enjoyment of the situation and his position of what he'd dubbed "Almighty God of Lube And Other Things Slick And Slippery". (Following that proclamation, Thor especially had needed a minute to curb his immediate, hearty laughter.)
The gist of it is, he's tired, irritated and properly jetlagged when he returns to the compound. It's evening in New York and the five hours he's slept on the plane have left him only more exhausted, which is fine by him because he absolutely plans on crashing in bed in a few minutes.
– Tony feels something curl tight and hot in his chest – maybe he, too, has found himself wanting. And this is where his feelings go, whereas Tony drowns them in drink because while everyone copes differently, this is where their differences truly come to light. Rogers turns the bad into something good, while he only knows to destroy.
Steve chuckles, a warm sound that goes right to Tony’s heart and makes a home for itself there. A hand comes up to brush the wayward strands of hair out of his vision and then winds around his waist alongside the other one, neverminding the fact that he’s messy with his own come.
Hell, this isn't even his universe. He needs to stop.
The hesitation isn't unwarranted. Tony is usually the one to call it quits on their lovemaking sooner rather than later because his body oh-so-kindly reminds him–in multiple places, not just his ass–that he isn't cut out for prolonged bouts of this sort of activity anymore. Said activity being fucking like rabbits, that is.
If he carries the stupid flip phone everywhere from that point onward, stares at it like it holds the answers to the universe and wonders if the message was a perversely casual ‘Happy birthday’ or another dirt cheap apology, then that’s nobody’s business but his own.
From a purely unbiased perspective, Bruce shared Captain Rogers' opinion; often times Lord Stark would behave foolishy at best and recklessly at worst, and this appeared to be one of his most foolhardy endeavors yet.
He's magical like that. Or maybe there is no magic. Maybe Steve has just learned to read his moods and thought patterns like Tony has learned, studied and picked his apart in turn until here they are, still understanding new things about each other but running like clockwork most days. Snapping together like a well oiled pair of cogs. (And why does that sound like it's got double meaning? Tony is trying to be sappy here.)
They turn left at the next crossroads and the trail there is wider, enough to fit two riders comfortably next to each other. Tony pushes his mount into a faster trot to be on one level with the other man, trying not to let his discomfort show as Rogers looks over.
In the last moment, Tony remembers himself. He wrenches his gaze away from the man's lips and passes Steve's face by, burying his face in the crook of his neck instead. Steve finally comes back to himself and slowly winds his arms low around his back, fingers curling into the jacket when Tony buries into him.
Stark goes on to say that they should execute the maneuver as planned but send someone in there with him to get to the control panel that lies underneath the floor plating right past the first gate – they just need to make sure he gets there and rewires some of the switches to deactivate remote control of the doors, and voilá.
Tony knows she'll quickly run herself ragged at this pace, and he's going to need to come up with something if he wants to reach the cabin today; their ascend to the plateau will take another four hours if the words of the ranger who'd seen them off at the foot of the mountain held any truth.
As luck would have it, it's once again on them to make or break the universe. Although they're very much aware of the impact of their actions this time around, which Tony isn't sure is a positive development anymore. Not after what the Red Skull told them was needed to get the Soul Stone.
He tries to keep away from it, but even before his resolve breaks, there’s part of him that knows this is an exercise in futility. His willpower only reaches so far, and this past month has already tested his self-control to the limit. There isn’t much left in him.
Next to him, Bruce and Clint moved to repeat the process from before, working with a practiced efficiency. Steve smiled gratefully at them when he caught their gazes by happenstance along the way. They still had about two thirds to go, and the both of them had been a great help so far – he really was thankful, considering him and Tony would get the most out of this.
When the barricades they've put up are to their satisfaction, Steve's gaze involuntarily travels to Tony, taking in his picture more closely than during the perfunctory once-over he allows himself to take immediately whenever they've entered a safe space. Tony's caked in blood just like he is, but that isn't a particularly disturbing sight anymore and he seems fine aside from it.
Tony wakes up.
And yet.
He shifts on the chair and realizes his mistake a little too late. The movement sends another spike of discomfort from his raw asshole up his spine. Because he let
"Oh, child," he laughed, but taught her anyway. Later, she would know that it was because he, too, craved for someone to listen to his words and wisdoms.
She had been following her heart's wants ever since, and she would not stop now. If she were to marry a man and give up her love for adventure in favor of a quiet life hidden away in a homestead somewhere, she might die of unhappiness. This was not what her mother would have truly wanted for her, she was sure.
Steve's stoic expression turns into a frown. It's almost--confused? No, can't be. Tony pushes further because he's never known when to stop, and desperation doesn't help. "It won't work, you
The compound crumbles and the earth seems to open up and swallow what's left. Steve is expecting to see his end, here, as he faces Thanos with bitter determination and a broken shield.
"Nothing," he says, "I just love you."
He'd be mush. Dead. Muerto. Whatever.
There might not be a real danger here (right now), but Steve still feels better turning his own back to the exposed side of the bunk, able to protect Stark’s naked body from the prying gazes of curious individuals.
A blind man would have known this to be Anthony’s handiwork.
Steve doesn’t know if it’s idiocy, a fear of death or megalomania (or all three) that has gotten Stark so convinced being more machine than human is an existence worth striving for. Whatever it is–and it doesn’t concern him, Steve is only here to complete his task–makes him feel almost a shred of sympathy for the man when he catches up to him on the rooftop.
He forces himself to redirect his attention to Steve, whose hands now move up Tony's stomach, a sure, familiar touch that Tony leans into despite himself. There's nothing sexual about it, not really, even though he definitely qualifies as stark naked and his nipples are hard but that's only because it's too cold in here and he should've asked FRIDAY to turn the heat up ten minutes ago.
They arrive at eight on the dot next morning, in trademark, inconspicuous SUVs with only the eagle emblazoned on the side of the vehicles indicative of their sender.
Tony gives one last smile, maybe to soften the blow, and turns to enter his bedroom, shutting the door carefully behind him. Steve's left standing outside in the empty hallway, not ready to make himself move just yet. He watches the sliver of light shifting through the crack underneath Tony's door flicker and disappear, leaving the hallway a shade darker than before.
The words receive the desired response: Steve huffs a sudden laughter, and something in Tony that isn't Steve's dick swells and tingles pleasantly with the sound. Eventually though, his laugh trickles off and leaves only a subdued smile–Steve is aware he's only deflecting.
“Say, do these guys do deliveries?”
"I love this," Steve says, squeezing again for emphasis. He looks pointedly at Tony through the mirror, and so too sees him open his mouth to argue, because he is quick to keep going after that. "I love every single inch of this, of you, and no pound of fat
Tony can’t even crow ‘I told you so’ because the fear lodged in his airway threatens to choke him. Instead, with one trembling hand fumbling for the phone in his pocket and the other instinctively cradling his stomach, he prepares for what’s to come. He struggles to open the one single contact the phone came with, the simple task exacerbated by the sweat coating his palms, the unread message flashing at him and the prospect of imminent doom.
"Sprained," Bruce stated, finally, the injured man's breath of relief audible from the other end of the cot.
ways of being woken up, but that is just another in a long row of things that Tony doesn’t and will never bring up to Rogers in person.
right alongside
The man explained it would be impractical and also dangerous to leave them here – the rock slopes that surround the area are steep and prone to avalanches, which is why finding and returning the herd to the plateau as soon as possible is of such high importance. Tony,
Steve's too good to him, sometimes. Sometimes he's also irritating, and stubborn, and stoic and all those other things that annoy the living daylights out of Tony, but today – well, it's one of their more harmonic ones. Even now, Steve is smiling faintly, the crook of his lips a little sad perhaps, but underneath, it's patient and reassuring and everything else he knows Tony needs without having to be told.
Tony tries not to let the decreased caloric intake get to him too much. His body doesn’t care.
Steve always yearned for it, for something like this, but he doubts he could've coped with losing Tony if they had been as close as these two were. He barely does as it is.
"That's little dramatic, J," Tony comments as the first verse of a vaguely familiar song begins to waft from the speakers.
It takes Steve a moment to pull himself together, but his expression still belies the barely contained laughter.
Not one to intrude on a scene not meant for him, Bruce turned away, averting his eyes and blocking out their voices.
"I'm sorry, I shouldn't have–"
The knowledge that the hidden barriers he's putting up are futile when it comes to Steve doesn't bring the once standard-issue dread with it. Incredibly, Tony has learned to accept that the whole package-deal of a stable relationship includes letting your significant other in, inviting them to figure you out and vice versa.
At the first touch of his hand to the swell of his ass, Stark whimpers and instinctively presses back against it. Steve flares up with want, needing to elicit that sound again; he thumbs the swollen pucker of his hole for only a moment before he pushes a few fingers in, the slide easy with the only resistance being the one when he moves to pull them back out, the slick-coated insides working against him.
Steve kisses his forehead, and Tony shoves the thoughts away to regard him with a curious look. Out of all the places he expected to be touched first, this wasn’t one of them.
Tony smiles, stupid and more lovestruck than is warranted at his age, at his currently non-existent reflection in the fog-covered bathroom mirror. He tucks the damp towel around his waist and drags a hand over his mouth, noticing stubble in places it's not supposed to be.
Only almost, though. This could arguably be considered the worst week of Tony’s life, and he does smell the part when Steve buries his nose in his neck and breathes in. No matter how bad, though, it can never be worse than the scent of rotten flesh. Soon, he’ll make sure to help Tony to a proper wash, so they can get rid of at least the temporary marks that have been left.
Then, he sits back down and gives four successive knocks to his desk. Tony, stretched out on the chaise longue in front of the windowed wall, twitches but ultimately doesn't move. Instead, he buries deeper into the heap of furs he's wrapped himself in–Steve doesn't always like it but he has to admit he gets more done when his gaze doesn't get drawn to Tony's naked skin after every other page.
Anthony liked to talk. Whether he loved to hear his own voice or could simply not keep any one piece of information to himself was a mystery yet to be solved.
Doesn't matter the amount of objective imperfections, 'cause at the end of the day, you're gorgeous and brilliant in spite of them all. And when I say you're perfect,
The journey back to Earth, Tony realizes, is bound to take longer aboard the Benatar. The ship is in good enough condition, but the distance between the Milky Way Galaxy and this one is immense and possibly even greater than the human mind fully comprehends.
With Sir Steven's words, the Lord shuddered violently and desperately bucked into the other's hold, his mouth falling open in a long-drawn
The highlight of the following day's tourney was, without doubt, the last of the challenges, which was held to decide which knight of the Iron Guard would follow in Lord Rhodes' footprints.
Incredibly, Tony appears alright with leaving it at that. He lies back down.
Steve snaps his fingers. The sound makes Tony flinch. The
Not that Steve's ever really been on one (well, there was that weekend in Prague, but it'd been a business trip that Tony dragged him along for so he never counts it), but he figures this is what being on vacation must be like.
Bucky halts and Steve follows suit. They regard the scene, far enough away from the action so nobody will notice their presence for the time being.
Tony’s face falls. He’s glaring at Steve, but he can see his own expression in the mirror regardless. The undiluted horror communicated by his widened eyes and gaping mouth would be comical to look at were the situation not so very dire.
when you're the most perfect thing I've ever had the fortune of laying my eyes on. It's just, it doesn't make sense. Everything–"
dick. Tony isn't a religious man, but sometimes he wants to send a prayer up there and thank whichever higher deity has gifted him with this flawless co-creation of nature and science.
Tony had been so determined to let Steve fuck him (had gotten that heady, glazed-over look in his eyes whenever he talked about it that drove Steve crazy) he didn't let up until Steve caved, on the condition that they'd take some weeks to prepare him for the main event best as possible.
After having a dozen internal arguments with himself and losing most of them to his brain's rationale, he finally calls the number. Steve doesn't even get a chance to second-guess his decision before the person on the other side picks up at the second ring.
one, Steve just needs some imagination–he might as well give himself some peace of mind in other ways, starting with an uncomplicated way to verify Steve’s identity. Steve is resigned to JARVIS controlling and monitoring every aspect of his schedule by now, but there's got to be a more elegant solution.
Burning but alive.
Having listened in on some of the many conversations around her, it appeared quite clear that these men had been barred from attending the Lord's private dinings not without cause.
By the end of the day, it’s good as new.
The man's answer, to Tony's surprise, is much less hostile than he expects. He huffs a low breath, half sounding of interest and half of amusement. "Just lookin', huh? And what's it you're lookin' for?"
) but the moisture on his stomach and the fantastic fullness he’s feeling are testament to it: he’s blacked out for the time it took Steve to come.
When it was time for their parties to part ways, Lord Rhodes was the opposite of bewildered to find Rogers fall into line with Anthony's guard. It seemed like the natural order of things, if anything at all.
"Perfect. But it always is, with you."
moving, and everything that was of importance before evaporates into hot air instantaneously. The push is slow and tortuous and the stretch overwhelming in the best possible way, and Tony allows a satisfied groan to slip past his lips as he relishes the feeling of being split open.
The brunet’s expression transforms into one of feigned suffering, and then he says, “I haven't had to utter that sentence in about four decades, but– I don't know two of the nine words that just came out of your mouth."
“Figures you'd be hungry after that performance,” Tony teases, smirking because he can’t help it. “Stud.” Steve rolls his eyes at him and presses a quick peck to his jaw, which is when Tony is blessed by a sudden stroke of genius.
"Play it again, J."
After a long and tiring fight that cost many a brave man his life, Anthony too was gravely injured by a wound in the abdomen. He seemed to understand it as his duty to perform one last heroic act, fending off the burning steel in the tyrant’s hand with only his armored forearm to distract his opponent long enough to bring up his own sword and stab it clear through the titan's throat.
Tony smiles as Steve nuzzles into his neck, about to question what made him return early, and then sounds a surprised little huff when the other man presses their bodies together and there's a telltale hardness straining against his low back.
He can't bring himself to look at Steve. There's a knot lodged in his throat that's making it hard to breathe. With every second Steve doesn't answer, his palms get progressively sweatier.
One look at him sufficed to determine what caused his pain: the ankle of his bare right foot was swollen with dark bruises underneath a makeshift bandage haphazardly wrapped around it.
Most of the people are strangers to him, but he makes out flashes of familiar faces in-between. There's Peggy in her younger years, curls in her hair and red on her lips, Jarvis in his later years and one of his fanciest waistcoats, Ana with this small, subdued smile she used to smile out of pride and then -- Maria, just so very much like he remembers her, prim and proper and
A true understanding of the power and meaning of devotion comes only with suffering and loss beforehand.
Refused to take up residence in the castle. The proposition itself, well – Peter did not have to ponder it for long.
Strangely, in this moment of soul-crushing anguish, everything he can think of is,
Steve doesn't react beyond the obvious, only straightens to pull Tony closer until there’s no space left between their bodies. Tony hums as he feels Steve’s bulge press against his bare ass.
Quickly, the other man clasped his hand. “Rogers. Steven. My pleasure. I am aware Strange does quite live up to his name, but I had the sense he might be the only one who would still be able to help a man in a condition as dire as Lord Stark’s.”
"I can't lose you," Steve rasped, seconds away from coming undone inside Tony, breath hot against his skin. "Not you, Tony. Oh
It was a welcome change.
Tony lets himself drop down on a rectangular block of stone on one side of the arch, supporting his elbows on his thighs as he buries his face in his hands. When there's movement to his right, he lifts his head, one hand moving up to fist his hair.
Steve smiles tightly. The thought is bittersweet. He wonders if this Tony’s daughter is a Morgan too; wonders if she’ll also grow up with a loved one missing. He doesn’t dare ask. “He did. He does. After he came back from space, he and Pepper–”
He can’t help but feel wrong for it, slipping into this man’s clothes that are like a second skin on him, like taking his place could be just that easy. There’s certainly no profound message attached to this gesture, especially since Tony’s provided him with the clothes without making a big deal out of it, but the thought still leaves a bitter taste on the back of his tongue.
It's why Steve is surprised to find that today, this isn't the case.
"So, tell me, how's this little adventure treatin' you, Mr. Carbonell? Everythin' you imagined it'd be?"
He shakes the thought when Tony turns to him, his forehead creased in a contemplative frown before he sighs and hangs his head, gesturing for Steve to come along as he heads down the hall, into the living room.
In every childhood memory he could recall, Anthony Stark was right there alongside him.
and the ground beneath him is pure ice.
"I'm beginning to think you might be smart
Steve buries into Tony’s chest, his grip crushing. Tony lets it happen, disregards his own bewilderment to comfort Steve with slow, steady strokes up and down his trembling back.
Steve only notices the long, blissful groan after it's slipped past his lips and he has to bite the inside of his cheek bloody to cut himself off, curb the noise that betrays just how much he's ached for something like this.
Tony lifts himself back up, relishing the emptiness in the knowledge that being filled again will be all the more satisfying. “I think you like the way I am when it's just us. You like me in the workshop and, uh, I guess in bed, because I'm at my most–natural there, and…”
"Check for me, please?" She sighs and does half an eye-roll. "Daddy says he needs ten more minutes. That's
"I want," Tony says, voice so hoarse he has to clear his throat before he can continue. "I want you, right now, inside, I–"
Peter squared his jaw. He may not be able to relieve the Lord of all those thoughts and somber what-ifs, but he could lift one worry off his mind.
When Anthony detached himself and leaned back there was a knowing glint in his eye. Steven's lopsided smile belied that he had long since been convinced.
“Beautiful.” Kiss.
“And you need to get off your high fucking horse! I’m a notorious, good-for-nothing drunk – Congratulations, Rogers, you got to the bottom of it! Doesn’t mean you have the right to treat me like an
Tony hears himself whimper as Steve’s fist finally tightens around him, pre-come easing the slide as he begins jerking him in deliberate strokes. The picture in the mirror is absolutely filthy, and even
Steve chuckles and leans back, hand in his hair. He almost wants to cut in with a sneering comment along the lines of
