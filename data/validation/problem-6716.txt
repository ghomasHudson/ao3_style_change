The other Steve, the one who had spent all week reliving the loss of his dead lover whose face this new version of Tony wore, he was….well, detached wasn’t quite the word for it. It reminded him of the first time he’d opened Natasha’s file to find the section usually devoted to fingerprints blank except for a brief note:
As if the awkward gesture towards his surroundings reminded May that their reunion had an audience, she peered suspiciously around the room. Tony took a huge bite of his apple fritter and tried to appear as unthreatening as possible.
“Surely you are aware that I recognize the signs of Dominant deprivation. I suspected a few days ago; during the conversation the three of us had, you sometimes seemed anxious not just for Talia, but
“But he’s not…look, even during our scene, he acted out. He mouthed off, tried to push me away. That’s what he does, Natasha, that’s how he asks for reassurance because he’s still learning to differentiate between negative and positive attention. Right now, he’s not just trying to please us. I think—I think he might be saying goodbye.”
“Over here,” Rhodey called, crawling out from behind a bit of digital scaffolding that had done a masterful job of concealing his location. “Wanted to give these fools a chance before I started pickin’ em off one by one.”
“Really, it’s not a big deal. I’m sure it would take a lot more than being tied up to cause any lasting—”
Clint had tried to turn that particular exercise into something fun by tossing berries and Runts (which, as fruit-shaped candy, he argued were completely interchangeable with the real thing) into Tony’s mouth every time he got a question right. But some of it just…well, it wasn’t particularly fun to chat about. Like when they’d had to talk about how Mark II had died.
Now, Steve was in fact grinning and humming showtunes under his breath even as Domen read the note aloud, which was somewhat damning evidence. But he was going to have stern words with Natasha for ratting him about the skipping thing.
The prospect of his first dinner with Stark and the rest of the Avengers, to be held that evening after May’s shift ended, was daunting enough. To make matters worse, the whole thing wreaked of some kind of after-school-special domesticity. While Peter wasn’t so jaded as to be able to pretend that hanging with some of the most famous superheroes in the world wasn’t appealing on some level, building anything beyond a professional relationship with the lot of them was ultimately a child’s dream. Besides, if Peter had learned one thing in the past few years, it was that his childhood had effectively ended at the same moment he’d accepted the full reality of his transformation. (Great power, great responsibility…sometimes he really hated how well-spoken Uncle Ben had been. Couldn’t the guy have left a bit of wiggle room in there? Like with great power comes great responsibility…except during SAT season?)
“It’s attention-seeking. Submissive 101, really,” Natasha finished thoughtfully. “I should have seen it sooner…the punishment I gave him during our scene, it was very obviously helpful. He responded just like every other sub I’ve ever had who finds release that way: sincere apologies, catharsis through crying, followed by intense contentment. But the second he was up out of headspace even a little he was insisting he would never need that kind of attention from a Dominant again. He’s fairly comfortable admitting he likes and maybe even needs the sexual submission, but he’s not ready to consciously admit that it’s not enough.”
I think that's it, but as always, feel free to let me know if you have questions, concerns, or think any additional tags need to be added.
Steve has never been one to hear and see people who aren’t there. Sure, he’d resented the fact of his utter isolation when he’d woken to find himself in a new century, but he’d never followed someone who looked like Peggy down the street, or seen members of the Howling Commandos everywhere he went. The one time he’d thought there was an exception—Bucky, because it was always Bucky—it had instead transpired that the world had stubbornly refused to be done with both of them.
Your questions and comments continue to delight, inspire, and challenge me. Two scenes in this particular chapter were inspired by readers: the discussion about regional distinctions in D/s practices came from a comment from dixiehellcat. Bruce being the one to start trying to take on Tony's food issues was inspired by ihearttwojacks. I love hearing all of your thoughts and feelings and predictions! (There's at least one #AskStrange response in the works too, so remember that that's an option if you'd like to get some insight from the Doctor rather than or in addition to myself!)
Steve was always careful of his strength, he had to be. He could send a regular man through a window with the equivalent force most people could use to playfully shove someone—losing control just wasn’t an option. But Alex…he played dirty. He pulled on the ropes to gain leverage during illegal holds; he pulled hair and gouged eyes; he ‘mis-aimed’ spears in ways fully intended to take advantage of the fact that Steve wasn't wearing a cup. None of it was enough to make a dent in Steve’s strength or stamina, but the kid just. Wouldn’t. Stop. Didn’t know when to give up, when to stop running his mouth, when to realize even his best efforts were more of an irritation to Steve than an actual threat.
“Let’s sit. We can use this time to get to know you a little bit better, and then you can take home as much food as you’d like for Peter. I think you mentioned he particularly likes roast beef, yes?”
“Oh please, you already have plenty of that. Anyone who has ever seen the two of you in public can see how gone you are for each other. No, listen. Tony is terrified of the bloodwork because he wants to know you’re really choosing
He sat down on the edge of the table and offered the little black disk to Clint. The other man splayed his palm out, but when Tony tried to drop the magnet into it, Clint caught his hand and threaded their fingers together, just as he had that day in the kitchen with Barnes. (The part of Tony’s brain that had felt permanently aroused since his little experiments the other day was practically doing somersaults to remind him how strong and competent Barton’s fingers had felt that day, how much manual dexterity Clint would have to have to wield guns and especially bows the way he did.)
“I don’t hate him.” Bucky raised his eyebrows and crossed his arms across his broad chest. His posture had lost all of the loose easiness that subbing for Natasha had brought to it, and that sight on top of everything else made Steve ache all the more.
“Are you not up in the playroom for check in right now because you can’t or don’t want to be, or because you needed me to come get you?” Bruce was holding out a banana, but he wasn’t remarking on Tony’s coffee intake (which had been higher than the agreed-upon limit for days now) or asking what else he’d managed to eat. All of this suggested Bruce was probably trying not to be overly Dominant right now, and Tony’s mind didn’t quite know what to do with that, with anything that had happened over the past several days, really.
Actually falling asleep had required hours worth of reading on JARVIS’s part (they’d moved on from JARVIS sharing innocuous world news to his reading Tony a novel the evening prior, and it was working pretty well), but Tony had, eventually, managed it. This meant he was particularly pissed off to be woken what felt like only minutes later by having the covers ripped away, exposing him to the cool night air.
None of this made it any less surprising when the two of them walked into the playroom, Clint radiating smugness and Tony…Tony’s expression was one Steve didn’t recognize, something dark and promising.
Ah yes. The team does spend a rather disturbing amount of time on this topic. Perhaps I should show you, as they tend to get a bit sloppy for my taste.
“I want to watch you get yourself ready for me.” It was close, so fucking close to the very first fantasy Tony had ever had about being in a Dom/sub dynamic with any of them that the curl of arousal that wound itself around Tony felt just a little bit like fear. How could Steve
Traditional orientation science argued that before the spike in hormonal levels at 14, there was no way of accurately predicting a person’s classification. And it is true that there is a lot of dubious pseudo-scientific discourse around orientation predictions (somewhat comparable to some of the ‘theories’ that pregnant people refer to when trying to predict the sex of their fetuses.)
“The journalling isn’t designed to get you to work through your problems all on your own, Steve; otherwise you’d have no need for me. It’s just a place to start, and an opportunity to push past some of the initial temptation to resist or sabotage the process that you seem to experience when asked something you aren’t expecting.”
“It’s illegal to publish pictures, video, or even written accounts of anything that happens at Clayton Park,” Steve explained in a quiet voice, gesturing to a statue of a young woman situated in the very centre of the park. “Keera Clayton saved the life of a submissive in severe deprivation by Dominating him in a public space. It was illegal back then, for people of colour to Dom white folks, and someone took a picture that resulted in her arrest. When the sentence was vacated and she was freed nearly twenty years later, she declined all compensation. She asked that the money be put towards a sanctuary for all Dominants and submissives instead, so that everyone would have somewhere to go to practice their orientation in the light of day without risk of harm or exposure.”
Which was, to be fair, rather the point of the damn daily check-ins. Bruce had explained it the first day they’d done it, calm even as Tony was practically vibrating off the exam bench with nerves.
“All this production over lunch, Brucie bear? I know I’ve got some issues with food stuff, but you don’t actually have to be afraid to give it to me, you know.” To prove his point, Tony ducked his hand over the wrap and made to steal an olive, but found it quickly pushed away. “Okay, see—”
, his brain working the way it could when unencumbered by fear or self-hatred or anything. When a hand he recognized immediately as Bruce’s trailed lazily up Tony’s calf, Tony tipped his head back and sighed blissfully.
Steve was only a couple of steps out of the elevator when his own voice echoed through his living room. The sound was tinny and distant, emanating from a single device rather than the multiple, perfectly-balanced speakers of the floor itself, but there was no mistaking what the words were. Steve had practiced them so many times over the weekend that he could have recited them backwards while standing on his head.
“There’s a separate entrance and a screened-off area for underage folks or others who don’t want to witness sexual play over there, but otherwise yeah pretty much. This is one of the only affordable ways for low-income people with some kinks, like exhibitionism, to be able to practice safely without harming anyone who doesn’t want to be indirectly included.”
“Stop trying to figure out where I am or I’m gonna hang up, man.” Then Rhodey sighed, something deeper and more frustrated than his usual annoyance at Tony’s antics. “I had hoped it would take longer for them to do this. I wanted to be back in the Tower by then so I could be sure they weren’t, I don’t know, rushing you or something.”
“I have to go to work, Tony! The CEO can’t just stop showing up mid-week with no explanation. Do you have any idea how many meetings I’ve postponed already, not to mention the conference call with our Canadian branch—”
“So. You’ve gone a bit nuts then, that’s cool,” Bucky drawled. “At least you look good in yellow.” Steve glared down at the bright elbow-length rubber gloves on his hands, then back up at Bucky. He hucked a second pair of gloves at the other man, raising his eyebrows when Bucky opened his mouth to protest.
“Really good. Not—not like the high, it’s not, I still feel aware of my problems and my myriad of character defects and all that. But I just feel…steady. Even the aftercare, it was nice, but it didn’t feel as necessary this time. Is that, am I making any sense at all?” Bruce reached over for his lemonade and handed the cup to Tony as he considered his answer. It was nicely flavoured, something herbal (basil, probably?) cutting the sweetness, and Tony look several long swallows.
On principal I refuse to devote any mental energies to Wade Wilson. He once attempted to ‘ship’ me with my own cloak I am too distracted by even attempting to consider his orientation to attend to the rest of this question.
Truly, he didn’t know what he’d been expecting, but the blank emptiness of what he knew had been Tony’s workshop in the previous iteration of the compound left Peter breathless. He nearly turned right back around and sprinted for the elevator before the doors had closed, but a faint whirring noise echoed through the otherwise empty expanse of the room.
“Yeah. Yeah it is.” Pepper turned away from the holoscreen of about thirty open documents that floated in the centre of the table with clear reluctance.
He’d never scened sexually with Bruce, he realized suddenly during the short walk from the sunroom where Tony had spent his assigned ‘free time.’ There had been the milking, which had been right on that boundary, but otherwise Bruce was an unknown entity to him in this regard. And now Tony was going to learn him in front of the others, or at least, that was what he’d requested.
But this was Dummy, who in every conceivable universe would always be the bot who’d save Tony’s life, who even now found out some version of Tony wasn’t dead and showed up with a
Steve wanted very badly to use the spray bottle on Bucky as if he were a poorly behaved cat. If the thing had been filled with water instead of vinegar he definitely would have done it. He settled instead for thrusting a package of toilet cleaning brushes at Bucky, paired with his most menacing scowl. Bucky outright laughed even as he saluted Steve and crossed the bathroom to kneel down in front of the toilet.
As for Stark’s food issues (CW for disordered eating, forced overeating and starvation), I shall share this directly since I doubt he will ever be able to spell it out clearly for the Avengers. Life as the child of a wealthy, popular family in the 70s and 80s meant that Tony Stark was frequently provided with multi-course meals too rich and plentiful for a child. However, ‘politeness' dictated that he clear his plate. Since that point, Stark developed a disdain for large, sit-down meals, preferring to ‘graze’ or avoid eating altogether, particularly during periods of high stress or emotional turmoil.
ETA: All of what you see in this chapter would have been preceded by a LOT of negotiation and discussion on all of their parts. I included bits and pieces of that, but by no means the entirety of those conversations. If you want to see more, that’s certainly something I (or the Doctor) can provide.
Natasha, who had been absent from the Tower that morning, was the only one who met Tony’s eyes. But where the others appeared defeated, Natasha was in intel-gathering mode. It was the same as Tony had always known it to be, a hint of seduction (plump lips, slightly hooded eyes, open posture) masking the sharp way she studied every inch of her target. The only difference was the hint of a frown playing at her lips; unlike his Natasha, she didn’t seem to want to be looking at Tony this way.
Heat flooded Tony’s belly. After so long without, he was almost dizzy at the sudden possibility of being able to freely have sex with any member of the team that he chose. He was tempted to say yes before even hearing the alternative and wasn’t entirely sure what stopped him.
“Jesus. He’s…” Tony was pretty interested to know exactly what Bucky thought he was, but it was also a bit of a relief to know he wasn’t alone in being robbed of the ability to finish sentences. He opened his eyes to find that Bucky had abandoned his chair in favour of kneeling next to the bench, watching Tony with wide, unblinking eyes. When his gaze connected with Tony’s, he smiled. “You’re gorgeous like this, sugar.”
When Tony had let himself imagine it in his own universe, he’d always thought kissing Steve would be all brutal, consuming heat: beautiful and near-blinding illumination, but fleeting and wholly destructive, too. (It was unsurprising, really, that when they’d finally broken completely apart the world had followed shortly thereafter.)
Sunlight gleamed through the wide windows of Steve’s bedroom. They’d neglected to shut the drapes fully the night before, and while JARVIS was equipped to handle such things automatically in the penthouse, Steve typically preferred to handle small household tasks on his own. It had snowed sometime during the previous night, and frost was creeping up the corner of one of the panes. Steve normally hated all evidence of winter’s arrival, but this morning the light was bouncing off the snow, painting Tony’s half-uncovered form in brilliant patches of crystallized light.
The first scene of the chapter is another dream/flashback sequence involving the early stages of D/s Tony and Steve's relationship. Story-typical warnings for that one; Steve is in no way doing anything non-consensual, but Tony is deeply uncomfortable with being a submissive and resents his body and mind for needing the things they do. If you want to skip that, just start reading after the italics.
It was a list of miscarriages. Maria and Howard Stark had lost five children, the last roughly 4 months before Tony would have been conceived.
“Tony’s fine,” he grinned. “And I don’t want you working for SHIELD either, Kamala—can I all you Kamala?—not officially. You way too young, for starters.”
Thank you all so much as always for your wonderful kudos, comments, and questions. Please keep them coming while I am over here hiding behind my hands. I won't be able to manage replies to comments from last chapter possibly until Sunday (it's my partner's birthday) but they're definitely coming!
“Shh, shh, you’re fine. And so is Bucky, I promise. Something’s been brewing with him for a while, I think, and I promise we’ll help him get that sorted soon. But for now let’s finish up here, hmm? Ten more.” Tony wanted pretty desperately to go after Bucky, but there was no way to focus on anything else when the strap descended again, this time against the tops of his thighs. He wailed, Steve’s name the only recognizable language amidst a sea of formless pleas and cries  and apologies. “You’re so close, Tony, we’re almost there. This is almost over. All that’s left now is for you to forgive yourself. Let it go, sweetheart.”
“I don’t want to work for SHIELD,” she said at once. Then her eyes went impossibly wider, as if she was appalled by her own daring. “It’s not, I mean, no offense Mr. Stark—Iron—Ton—ugh!”
to do anything. If it’s something you want to focus on, though, I would suggest doing some reflective work on the idea that the Solider’s reappearance might actually represent a kind of growth or evolution on your part. Maybe try to think about what it is the Soldier seems to need and want, and what it might be about your current context that is encouraging you both to seek those things out. We talk again in two days, yes?”
Bucky consented to change into a pair of swimming trunks easily enough, but he showed little interest in scrambling into the water the way most of the team had already done. (Tony  was certain the pair of them were being watched extremely closely, but he felt oddly grateful for their willingness to let him take the lead for now.) So Tony all but pushed Bucky into a lounge chair, and proceeded to clamber into his lap.
“Fine.” Bruce arched a brow and jabbed his pen toward a chart on the wall beside them. It listed pain rankings from 0-10, and had definitely been custom made for the Avengers. Ten listed items like ‘a building fell on me’ and ‘I lost count of the gunshots.’ Five included ‘I’m pretty sure just the one bone is broken’ and, with no other explanation or framing, the name ‘Loki.’ “Look, that’s not fair though. Chronic stuff is different. Like even if something is an eight for me, if it’s always or often at eight then that’s not cause for alarm the same way as it is for something acute.”
“Steve. I think I know what this is about,” Sam says, the gentle balm to Bucky’s aggression. Steve pushes down the horrible urge to laugh. (Oh Sam. I don’t think so.) “I know what happened with Peter was upsetting. But you really did a fantastic job handling it, you told me even May was impressed. You gotta let yourself off the hook for whatever build-up you missed leading up to it and just focus on now. What’s he up to today?”
“You’ve been up this whole time. You know, none of the documentaries or the obnoxious videos they showed us in school ever mentioned what a goddamn troll you are.”
Peter had seen the armour so many times lately—in his dreams, in street art, in cheesy made-for-TV movies that always got Tony so, so wrong—that it had started to take on a kind of surreal quality. He’d forgotten the way the red and gold gleamed in the light, and how much the harsh lines of the faceplate had somehow come to feel nearly as comforting as looking into Tony’s own face.
Bucky’s quick-thinking had bought them a reprieve, providing a glimpse of Tony’s intentions without pulling him fully out of headspace, but they all knew it was a matter of time after that. Once Tony’s brain had started really working on something as important as their looming conflict with Taskmaster there would be no slow sink back down into the depths of subspace. They all held on tighter while they still could. They hand-fed Tony all his meals that day; by dinner he was up enough to grumble a bit, but Steve didn’t need Bruce’s careful charts to be sure Tony had taken in way more food than was typical for him since the scene. And his satisfaction seemed more than just physical; Tony emerged from subspace with a contentment that seemed to both delight and astonish him, like he’d been given something he’d needed his entire life without ever realizing.
“JARVIS said you’re working on getting your caloric intake closer to what it actually should be for your metabolism. I went the old fashioned way and just quadrupled what i would usually get for your order. Now tell me, what had you looking so pissed off when I got to SHIELD?” Steve sighed and took a massive bite of one of the stack of hot dogs. (It really was delicious.)
have to lose you in the field…you honestly think I could hear that and feel anything but fucking elated?”
He’d assumed the water question was for the aftercare portion of the proceedings (he’d done a bit of reading, and baths seemed pretty common), but that turned out to be their first stop. Natasha stripped them both with more gentleness than he’d known her capable of, then drew a bath into which she added a small disk she told him was some kind of oil. It smelled like ginger and some kind of citrus, and even if Tony himself was a bit bemused by starting out this way, his body was certainly happy to find itself surrounded by warm water and calming smells.
“Oh. I. No, I just thought having a prop would make me feel less foolish. Also they never give me enough ketchup for how much food I order at these places.”
“I need a job.” Phil’s eyebrows rose slightly, betraying his surprise. And to be fair, it was a slightly humiliating thing to admit, but Tony could see no other way forward. The Avengers (plus Pepper and Rhodey, neither of whom could risk having their work connected to Tony until he came out) were the only ones who knew Tony was here. If he was going to fill his days with something, they were the only ones who could help. Tony shivered again—was the heating in the whole damn Tower malfunctioning?—and laid it all out as plainly as he could.
“I really liked London. One of my only missions to go absolutely perfect from top to bottom was there. I ended up with about an extra week to just hang around with Nat. We did the whole cultured thing, went to a bunch of museums and shit. I hadn’t told her, yet, that I had hearing issues and problems with reading, but she’d already figured it out, and she made sure to take us to the museums on days when there were ASL guides taking groups through. It was the first time I'd ever gotten to do something like that and actually understand what was happening.” Clint stopped speaking abruptly, as if the memory made him a bit more emotional than he’d wanted to get. Tony made a point of turning away for a moment under the guise of finding a different coloured pencil for Clint to use to chart the coordinates.
“That’s a great idea!” Tony enthused. He strode over to Steve and, without warning or ceremony, stuck a hand into Steve’s front left pocket. He shook the loose change he’d recovered with a rattle while Steve tried to get his heart to restart. “Drama, c’mere girl!”
“Contracts, not unlike the ones we have here for non-workplace power exchanges. T’Challa sent over some samples.”
“From the sounds of it, they didn’t come together again as quickly. I was the first one back—cut my trip short when I found out that Tony was taking on all the clean up himself. Is it possible that his didn’t, and that maybe that had a kind of ripple effect where the whole team was delayed in getting back together?”
For someone used to treating masturbation mostly as a necessary act of self-maintenance, it required deliberate attention to slow things down. Tony let his hands linger in places he normally avoided—his neck, his nipples, his chest. Even the upraised skin where his scars remained didn’t feel shameful or ugly today, not with Steve watching him wide-eyed focus, as if even the act of blinking was an unthinkable distraction.
The sanctuaries, while facing minor attempts at invasion, never incurred the same degree of damage in this verse, no. Loathe though I am to admit it, this is in large part because the Titan never got the chance to collect the infinity stones. He was eliminated from play early on thanks to the Ultron technology.
“You seriously hate Stark that much? I know he tried to kill you, but he also gave up a lot to bring you and everybody else back.”
Tony had answered ‘no’ to experience with about seventy-five percent of the list, but except for a couple of hard nos, most of the ‘willingness’ category was currently blank. He scanned the table again. The stuff around pain was kind of intriguing, but without any context beyond playful hand-spankings, imagining how he would respond in any kind of detail was next to impossible. How was he supposed to know if he’d prefer crops or whips or canes? How much would be too much? He thought fleetingly about trying to order some of this stuff and experimenting on himself, but he suspected pretty strongly that trying to hide that kind of experimentation would be way more difficult than hiding the kneeling had been.
“I do not want to borrow—how did you—” Peter sputtered. The girl grinned again, that same clever twist of the lips that had been the only warning of what was to come in the library. This at least had the effect of cementing his conflicted responses into something specific. “Why did you do that?”
“I’ve never found it advisable to plan on leaving General Zabu’s company one moment before she intends it,” Angzata offered, his voice lowered to a conspiratorial whisper. For the second time, Steve couldn’t help but bark out a laugh.
Steve was the closest he’d ever felt to flying without having been in an actual scene. Tony sat on one of the new kneelers they’d bought for the playroom, curled at Bucky’s feet while he read aloud. The books had been a last-minute addition to the playroom, something Clint had grabbed out of the library as a temporary filler for the empty storage slots under the bed in the aftercare area. But then Tony had remarked on never having actually seen, let alone read, most of the books he owned, and Bucky had taken it from there. Instead of hiding from the impact his Dominant voice had on Tony (on pretty much anyone with an ounce of submission in them, really), he had chosen an activity that allowed him to play to that deliberately without crossing any boundaries he wasn’t ready to breach. Steve had never been more proud of him.
The awkward, weighty silence that followed was only broken when Rhodey began a slow descent onto a large, flat expanse of land punctuated by large warning signs bearing US military symbols and several large, nondescript crates
Excellent, I love an orderly list of queries! I shall aspire to be equally methodical in my responses.
He wasn’t entirely sure what he expected to greet him when he stepped out. Phil naked and on his knees, perhaps, or ready to present Steve with any number of tools suitable for a highly intense scene. All of them involved an interaction between a submissive and a Dominant, because Steve was a True, and that was how everyone always thought to bring him comfort.
“If anyone here is being babysit it’s me, Talia. Though I’m glad to hear you visited a Dom.” And it was true. The woman was definitely still pissed, eyebrows furrowed and lips pursed, but the painfully tight, strained look her features always started to take on after too long without subspace was gone. She knew it, too, because she didn’t even bother arguing with Steve beyond a soft snort, and the woman was the type to claim the sky was purple and not blue just for the sake of it.
The pieces came together quickly after that. Natasha, below Steve on the chain of command, had received word of Spiderman’s injuries first; she had been watching him outside official channels. That in itself was not entirely a surprise; she had alluded to some kind of knowledge of the man when she’d urged Steve not to corner him during their last Community Day. The piece of the puzzle that he’d been missing at that point, however, was where this knowledge had come from, and where exactly her sudden investment in a relatively minor player in Queens was coming from. His eyes found Tony, whose immediate transformation at Natasha’s news was so complete that Steve could barely recognize him as the same man who had been kneeling contentedly at Bucky’s feet no more than two minutes ago. The colour had drained entirely from his face, and he was gripping his left arm with his right.
“Why would we do that? It was supposed to be a gift, Tones.” Tony had in fact financed plenty of his own gifts before, and was about to point this out to Rhodey. “We all make good money, and gift-giving is kind of a big thing for Doms. If that’s something you think you might need practice with, though, we could always take over more of the financial stuff for a while.” This was nothing less than a horrifying prospect (seriously, what was the use of being a billionaire if the people around you still felt the need to pay for stuff?), and Tony shut his mouth with an audible clack of his teeth.
“Death may end a life, but not necessarily a relationship,” she’d said. “I’d like you to do some thinking about what kind of relationship you would like to have with Tony—your Tony—how you can hold onto your bond without denying the fact of his death. Spend some time, no less than say half an hour, journalling on this. Just put pen to paper and write whatever you’re thinking, don’t stop to edit or critique or second-guess. You don’t have to share all of what you say with me, but I will expect to discuss some of your thoughts during our next session.”
The implications of this cover-up are, of course, wide-ranging and extensive. Howard Stark obtained countless honorary degrees, has dozens of buildings and other public spaces dedicated in his name, and is a frequent figure in history, political science, engineering and science textbooks the world over. His company, meanwhile, will almost certainly face investigation to determine the scope of its involvement in the deception.
“I believe the UN would be amendable, but you truly believe you could persuade your own government of the value of such a program? I am not unaware of how they speak about our orientational practices in your country, Captain.” She didn't bother repeating any of the hateful, bigoted language that often got circulated in those conversations under the supposed banner of concern, and nor did Steve seek to clarify. They were both entirely too aware of the ugliness of the world.
Tony didn’t go into Howard’s notes looking for it. He wanted that made clear, even if he never re-told this story outside his own head. Originally, he’d been creeping around this corridor only because a comedy of errors worthy of a sugar-high Dummy had prevented he and Steve from gaining access to the Tessaract for several days. One time there had been too many people around; during another attempt everyone present in SHIELD HQ had been evacuated and searched because Pym had found out about the missing particles. (Thank god Steve had apparently learned some subterfuge since his days of hiding sensitive intel in vending machines; no one had suspected the two new guys.) As a result of Pym’s (admittedly justified) paranoia following that episode, a lot of the more sensitive tech had been moved to a new location: a private but rarely used laboratory of Howard Stark’s.
this, I need to tell you and I can’t, the words won’t, I need you to…to punish me, to help me. Please, I’m begging you.”
Tony, though, Tony was in his element, and it was a delight to watch. He flitted from person to person, armed with knowledge from briefing files on the attendees that Pepper had prepared for him to ensure that he didn’t make any mistakes rooted in the small differences between their universes. (Steve never would have thought of doing something like that, which was yet another reason he was glad to have her on their side.)
1. In order (except for Wilson, about whom I will share a short vision instead): The bombing of the UN still occurred (though the events that followed were, obviously, significantly different), so
“Tony wants to, and I quote, ‘explore all options up to and including moving to that hippo sanctuary he knows he won from that guy at the—”
He really considered Coulson next. Phil’s dual role as his partner and the team’s handler was certainly a potential benefit, but it also meant that if he wasn’t convinced by what Steve was saying, it could backfire on Steve on multiple levels. Too risky. The previous night he had begun to give up on all of it, resigned to letting the situation just explode in their faces and dealing with the fallout when they were at least all on the same side again. That night, though, as he watched Tony eat garlic knots from Thor’s hand, it hit Steve fully why it was that he’d started to feel so scared.
An interesting question which is catching a significant omission on Stark’s part. The events relating to Aldrich Killian and Extremis which occurred in his universe took an extremely different course in the D/s universe. While being extremely candid about other aspects of his background, Stark has not yet shared anything about this period of his life with the team (with the exception of his slip regarding not wanting to fail Ms. Potts ‘again.’)
It wasn’t that Peter didn’t like Sam. In their limited interactions he had in fact proved to be one of Peter’s favourite members of the team. He was funny and a little less socially awkward than the rest of them, easily filling gaps in conversation without ever resorting to meaningless chit-chat. He had also been one of the only ones, in those hazy days immediately following Tony’s not-death, to focus less on trying to convince Peter to accept what had happened on the battlefield. Instead, he’d asked if Peter had a favourite memory of the man he wanted to share, confessing that he hadn’t known Tony particularly well and that it might make Sam himself feel like less of a fraud among the other mourners to know something other than the basics.
Steve didn’t remember getting dressed. He had to have put on more than the boxers he’d been sleeping in, but the entire block of time between realizing who would be on the other end of the line and actually making it into T’Challa’s offices were just gone, as if he hadn’t even been conscious. (His hand trembled when he picked up the phone, and he was painfully grateful the rooms were empty.)
It was a little after three in the morning by the time the Avengers were all collected in varying levels of wakefulness. Tony stood in the centre of them all, trading good-natured jibes with Bucky, who was insisting that Tony must not be tiring his dominant out properly if he still had the energy to work out in the middle of the night.
“Alright, Tones. I can see we’re not going to manage to avoid a punishment in these next few days. Which shouldn’t surprise me, really, I’m a new Dominant for you and you’re under intense stress plus doing the usual boundary-testing stuff, and—alright. C’mere buddy.” Tony had heard the words Rhodey was saying, but they hasn’t really sunk in until his friend had sat down on his bed and patted his lap, the expectation clear. That was around the time Tony had realized he was really, really screwed, because Rhodey had never been the type to decide on something and not follow through. Which hadn’t stopped Tony from trying to persuade him otherwise, but Rhodey was as immovable as ever, and eventually the tension and anticipation of what was coming grew worse than Tony had imagined any punishment could be, so he’d laid himself across Rhodey’s lap. “Pants off and underwear down, Tony.” They’d specifically negotiated punishment protocols when Rhodey had taken over his care, but he'd still whined in embarrassment and fear. Rhodey helped, though, reaching down to undo Tony’s belt and assist him with sliding both them and his pants down to his knees. It hadn’t felt as weird as it should have felt to be bare in front of Rhodey, and when he’d started bringing his hand down on Tony’s ass, all thoughts were pretty much emptied out of his head.
more than they wanted his stuff. Steve had helped get him there once, with persistence and gentle reassurances and, eventually, the comfort of submission. But this wasn’t his Tony, and therefore it was neither Steve’s right nor his responsibility to step in. So he tore into the takeout and curled up between Bucky and Natasha with every intention of enjoying the movie and the familiar presence of his family.
The sound of the battle should have been piercing, a roaring, calamitous combination of sounds that heaved and shook the ground. There was nothing but an eerie silence, fractured only by a sudden, gasping sob.
Tony could handle Pepper. He was not quite so sure about the rest of the team, who were bound to be just as pissed, plus maybe inclined to see this as some kind of violation of their Dominance. But other than a couple of weirdly intense looks from Bucky, nothing seemed out of the ordinary. They all ate dinner together, and then went their separate ways so that Tony could have his Thursday evening to himself like usual. (The rest of the team so often came up to breakfast on Friday looking a little hungover, but since he was the one kicking them out he could hardly be put-out that they apparently partied without him, right?)
“I was thinking about blowing Rhodes’ cover first,” Phil murmured, gesturing to the digital scaffolding on the screen.
“Tony,” he wheezed. “If this whole thing is going to work, then there are going to be two absolutely unbreakable rules. The first is that you need to call me Tony.”
Before I sit down to write individual chapters, I then outline those to give myself a sense of what the major pieces of those are going to be. So for this most recent chapter, for instance, I knew I wanted to intercut the Steve/Sam Tony/Peter stuff; I also had a general sense of Peter’s background and what to expect from him in terms of the tone of the conversation.
Tony was not only calling Steve, he was seeking Steve out, asking for his help and his company. Steve was grinning like a jackal even as he shoved his arm in the wrong sleeve of his jacket. (Domen was pretty clearly trying not to laugh now, and that didn’t bring his spirits down either. Tony had
He didn’t come back to himself until Phil touched his cheek some time later, smiling fondly. Clint was gone; it was just the two of them. It hit Tony again, that same sense of terrible gentleness he’d sensed in Phil a few nights prior in his office. Phil’s power as a Dom didn’t come from the threat of physical pain or punishment. What was terrifying and wonderful and so very fucking hot about him was how he could deconstruct your entire being with no hint of anything but overwhelming tenderness. After what might have been minutes or hours of sucking Phil’s cock with all his previous impatience abandoned, it returned now with a vengeance. Tony abruptly wanted to come, and wanted Phil to come, more than he’d ever wanted anything. His eyes watered, then widened with betrayal as Phil (when had he even gotten up?) tied his wrists behind him with a soft beige rope.
Later, Steve wouldn’t remember making the trip to Coulson’s floor. It passed in a blur, Steve somehow both intensely embodied and entirely outside of himself. Every part of him hurt, but he also felt dulled to all of it, sort of akin to the way that being in the immediate vicinity of an explosive muted your hearing for a while.
“She’s a llama,” Tony corrected absently. “And she probably wants your wristwatch, the little thief. Drama, c’mere. If you can sit still for half an hour I’ll let you run wild with the silverware later.”
Finally, Steve is still struggling in this chapter and takes it out physically on a SHIELD agent. They are sparring and the agent is given plenty of opportunities to tap out, but Steve certainly will later consider it an inappropriate use of his strength.
“I suppose congratulations are in order. When I am asked, I will honestly be able to say that your bloodwork indicates you are without a doubt, Tony Stark.”
Steve…Steve felt like he was reacting as two people at once. The first was a Cat-10 Dominant aware of a submissive in crisis. The instinctual response alone would have been enough to raise the tiny hairs on the back of Steve’s neck and curl his hands into fists, even if he knew nothing more than that. And he did, of course, know plenty more than that; he didn’t know much about this particular version of Tony, but it was still, well, Tony. He was alone and hurt and afraid, and if he really was some version of a submissive then Steve had the capability to make those things better. He was
“No, the wedding. We should do it all here.” Watching his team’s reactions to this proposal was somewhat like a character study all in itself. Natasha, Phil and Bucky began to survey the space from a security perspective—plotting out obvious sightlines, methods for securing or blocking off particularly vulnerable areas, probably planning where they could stash a weapon or fifteen. Clint, while likely undergoing similar mental gymnastics, was also smirking widely, amused by the challenges that were making the others hesitate. (Rhodey, who Tony would never stop reminding people was just as inclined towards mischief as Tony himself, just slightly better at hiding it, wore a nearly identical grin.) Thor, with all the overconfidence of a god, surveyed the land like it was another territory he now ruled. Sitting next to him, Bruce’s expression gave little away. Tony carefully didn’t look in Steve’s direction, not yet.
“What if I come with and I order Rescue to hover outside the window instead standing guard inside?” Tony offered. Pepper, too, had registered the pregnant pause. She glanced at Steve, seeming to confirm they were on the same page. It was nice even in the midst of his confusion to feel like Pepper and the Avengers were finally working together on the same team. He shrugged; Pepper frowned, then glanced again at Rescue.
For a guy so frequently reminded that he was out of time, Steve felt like he was swimming in the stuff these days. The future he’d fought so hard to preserve was here, laid out before Steve in an endless expanse of unsoiled promise. (He hated it. Hated everything about the idea of a future that didn’t include Tony Stark.)
“While all of us have endured much, none of us has faced the loss of a child. They are none of them cowards, but I believe they fear to witness too closely the wounds that loss has left behind. And perhaps they wonder if you truly wish to remain with us, if we shall ever be enough to make up for the absence of one you held so close.” Thor sat down on the bed next to Tony and sighed heavily. “I confess I myself have wondered this.”
“I’ve only woken up seventy years in the future once, Dr. Domen,” he volleyed back, genuinely confused by the observation. She paused midway through a sip of water she’d been taking, almost like she was choking back a laugh.
“I know, I just…God, Steve, he was so fucking sweet when he went under for me. Just as responsive as Bruce said—the way he reacts to praise especially is just unreal. It’s enough to break your heart and make you want to…” Even Steve had limits, and hearing in detail about exactly what praising Tony made Clint want to do would have been dancing right on the edge of that boundary. He cleared his throat, loudly, and Clint flushed. “I wanted—needed to take care of him. That’s all.”
Tony wondered suddenly whether or not the name Ty Stone would be familiar to the Rhodey of this world. Had he, like the other version of himself, seen Tony at his lowest romantically as well as in other contexts? Was this where the protective streak came from? Or was it the submission thing? Or both? Whatever it was, that particular tone in Rhodey’s voice, the one that promised to rain fire down on anyone who so much as looked at Tony the wrong way, made him inappropriately giddy for a couple of seconds.
“Like I said, your point is still well taken, Bruce. But whatever his reasons are, right now Tony’s boundaries are extremely clear. So I think we respect what he’s saying he is and isn’t willing to take on right now, and we come back to some of the reasoning behind it at a later date. Agreed?”
Tony looked from the maze, to Clint (who was still trying and failing to hide his glee), and back to the maze again. He’d seen this kind of setup before, some kind of trendy thing Pepper had made the SI people go to as a bonding exercise—
“Even the air is enough to make ‘em sting right now, but Bucky knows his limits. Go ahead if you want to.” Tony made a few steps toward the super-soldier, but couldn’t quite convince his hand it was safe or appropriate to bridge the last of the distance between them until Clint slid in behind him, interlaced his fingers with Tony’s, and pressed them to Barnes’ back. The skin was warm to the touch, whether from the whipping or a side-effect of the serum (or both). Whatever oil Clint had used caused their fingers to slip easily over the welted spots, but from the way Barnes hissed and whimpered it still hurt like hell.
“You are in fact one of the richest men in America, yes? Go get some. Or have someone buy some for you.”
Phil came into the sleeve by the fourth strike, then sobbed his way through the rest of the set from a combination of overstimulation and frustration that the sleeve had won another victory over his own self-control. Steve’s orgasm was almost an afterthought to that moment, to the deeply Dominant satisfaction of watching his sub overcome by pleasure in a way that had not quite been forced, but had also not arrived entirely on Phil’s own terms.
If Tony had been told a few hours or days ago that Clint’s entire idea for a scene revolved primarily around talking, he would have been both outraged and horribly disappointed. Now Tony wasn’t sure if he’d even survive. He dug his fingers into his thighs and tried to decide whether closing his eyes to picture the scene or watching Clint’s intense expressions as he spoke would be better. He settled for a kind of hooded stare.
For once, Bruce took him at his word without additional questions or verification. Natasha delivered one last stinging blow, then dragged her hand across the heated skin of his ass before trading places with Bruce. She was sweating slightly with exertion, and had removed her dress at some point, so she stood wearing only the deep green lingerie Tony had gotten a peak at her earlier. He grinned at her, and she winked back before accepting the bottle of water Rhodey had gotten up to offer her.
Both Peter Parker and Harley Keener, however, remained a presence in his life. I have witnessed firsthand the fact that both mourn him deeply. Colonel Rhodes and Ms. Potts have been charged with their care in his absence (not legally or officially, but via elaborate ‘Care and Feeding’ documents Mr. Stark ensured were part of his will), and they are both doing the best they can. Truthfully (and I hope I can trust you to keep this quiet) I do feel I owe Stark as much protection as I can give to those he considers his own, so I am doing what I can for both boys from a distance.
He must also have phoned ahead to warn the restaurant about super-soldier appetites, Steve realized, because the servings of stew that were presented to them were less bowls than they were tureens. Once Steve had made his way through more than half of it and was floating on a happy cloud of sweet potato and habanero, Bucky sat up in his chair and his expression turned serious.
“Please, Sir,” he pleaded, unsure if he was allowed to just sink down onto his Dominant the way his body was screaming out to do. Steve didn’t give a verbal answer; he lifted Tony bodily by the hips and eased him down onto his cock all on his own. His precise control over the speed of Tony's descent was incredible. It felt like he sank down by millimeters, and by the time Steve was finally fully seated, Tony was very nearly sobbing. “Holy god, Steve, Sir, you’re—fuck you’re big, you feel—pleeeeease Steve I need it, need you—holy FUCK Steve!” he swore as Steve lifted him again, then slammed him back down onto his cock, viciously spearing his prostate.
Tony reacts to the news of Ultron's alternative trajectory. With a little help from Steve, Talia and Masdee begin thinking about their future.
“Where there was an altercation that left Tony more wounded than I had realized until our check-in the other day. His Steve’s shield partially collapsed his sternum, which had been artificially reconstructed following the surgery to remove the arc reactor. It’s fine,” he rushed to assure the suddenly terrified, “I’ll run follow up scans if and when he’s willing, but other than being cautious with the entire area the same as we were with the other Tony’s reactor, I don’t see any lasting physical damage.”
Eek! I hope no one is too upset about the identity of Peter's love interest. I adore MJ and Zendaya, but since the multiverse gives us the options to right a lot of wrongs, I felt like bringing Gwen back (and racebending her, because why not?) might be a fun twist. Her band name, Fridged, comes from a term used to describe the phenomenon by which women are often killed off or brutally harmed to provoke character growth in other characters (usually men.)
“It’s the reverse, actually. No one could tell you what debriefing was when you asked because what everyone needs after a mission is unique, specific to who they are, or exactly what happened during a particular battle. Some of them need to relive it; they sit and tell me every detail they can remember—every scream, every drop of blood, every life they took or changed forever. Others need me to serve as a kind of judge; they tell me every error they made, what it cost them or the members of their team, and then they accept whatever decision I arrive at regarding punishment or reward. Sometimes they can’t say anything at all, and so it’s me who does the talking, telling them whatever I think they most need to hear whether it’s analysis of their technique in battle or reassurance and support. It can involve orientational dynamics, but it also doesn’t have to. So the question you should be asking yourself, then, Tony, is what do you need?”
Tony was sprawled victoriously across Clint’s couch, eating a kohlrabi like an apple and watching some kind of adult cartoon featuring a talking horse. They’d finally escaped the 31st floor, and had even made out a little in the elevator, but Clint had halted things before they’d gotten more than PG, citing the innocence of the robot llama they had constructed as a condition of their release from the last part of the escape room. They’d settled in to watch television and munch on the truly odd assortment of things in Clint’s fridge; they’d debated ordering something in, but Tony had been more amused by the thought of piecing what Clint had together in some bizarre semblance of a meal. Next to him, Clint was pouring a can of red bull into a single-serving container of Fruit Loops. (He was a beautiful disaster of a human and Tony was halfway to loving him already.)
Dummy on my case about stealing all the food he pretty clearly made for you.” Tony muttered things about conspiracies and overfeeding and something about his jeans not fitting; the latter was particularly absurd given that he was narrower, especially at the waist, than their Tony had been. But Steve still made a mental note to get JARVIS or Pepper or someone to ask if Tony wanted to order some new clothes.
“I told you we’re good, Brucie. You don’t have to—well, whatever this is.” His ’s’ sounds came out muffled and clumsy from the lollipop, which just gave this whole thing a new level of absurdity.
“We’re already on step one of the plan for the day, Tony; we’re watching television. Admittedly, it would be a lot more useful as an exercise if these fools had explained, and if they would kindly desist with the chatter before I’m forced to write them both up.” Clint grinned and mimed zipping his mouth closed, but Natasha cocked her head and stared at Coulson, who cleared his throat and stood, beginning to clear their dishes.
“Nothing for SHIELD, or the Avengers, or SI,” Steve had explained, handing him a tablet. “Just something fun. We can send Dummy down to the shop for any supplies that you need.”
Some small part of Tony was already mourning for the beginning when all of this had been new and sparkling and exciting. He’d been uncovering not just a potential relationship, but an entire world behind it, filled with tantalizing opportunities for discovery. But mostly the prospect of trading in the shiny newness of it all for something a little less volatile and unpredictable felt wonderful. They reminded him of the brief times he’d imagined a life after Iron Man in his own world, except where the visions of settling down with Pepper on a farm or whatever had always remained vague and elusive, like trying to hold on to a dream after waking up even as it was already slipping through your fingers, this was solid. Real.
“Just got mixed up on the days. Been a long week.” He never used to lie, either, especially not to Bucky. But there’s no way to explain that the combination of an eidetic memory and years worth of treasured moments means Steve’s constantly in a feedback loop, always recalling something like it had just happened the day before. Their first kiss, the first time they’d held hands in public, the first time Tony had used Steve’s name instead of a nickname…he remembers them all. Today it had been four years since Steve had first been granted entry to Tony’s workshop.
The next day, Steve cornered Natasha in a conference room at SHIELD HQ after a briefing. She was his second, and incredibly adept at reading other people, whether strangers or those closest to her. Natasha was his last and best shot, a fact which she proved by not even needing to ask why he’d asked her to stay behind.
“It’s interesting that you mention wanting to go back to your past, and that you compared everything unfavourably to that period in time. I wonder if that might be a pattern worth exploring.”
Bucky had thrown the bedroom window open wide first thing; a light breeze carried with it the sounds of lapping waves, seagull cries, and the rustle of palm-tree leaves. Tony had drifted in and out of a contented half-consciousness for most of the morning. This time, though, he was pretty certain he was awake for good, the need for caffeine and food (in that order) finally overcoming his desire to stay for as long as possible in this suspended space between waking and dreaming. He started to make experimental movements, checking in with his body in a way that was practically instinct by this point.
“I think the idea of not having to grieve the other Tony publicly makes me feel an incredible sense of relief.” Pepper nodded in silent encouragement, which was good because Tony was rather too stunned by this statement to so much as blink. “It’s…everything with him, especially between he and I, it was so intensely public. I loved him publicly, I lost him publicly, practically every second we had together was filtered through a hundred people’s cameras and tweets and news articles. When I thought about getting the chance to mourn him with only the people who knew and loved him best, that felt really freeing.”

anywhere than at Talia, whose rapt gaze alternated between the window of the plane and the woman standing next to her.
” Masdee seemed to struggle with herself for a moment, but then she crossed the small space and wrapped a hand around the back of Talia’s neck. The agent stared up at her for several seconds and then flushed again, averting her gaze. “I’m sorry. I…well, I don’t know what people would have said if you’d asked them what they expected for my life when I was a kid, but no one would have ever said I’d get to see something like this, I guarantee you. I…thank you.” Masdee’s grip tightened, her dark skin a stunning contrast to Talia’s caramel tones.
“I…isn’t one way we’re trying to keep the romantic stuff and the submission stuff separate supposed to be that you don’t date the same person you scene with in a week?”
But this morning…well, he’d definitely lingered longer than he had to, even with Dummy the wake-up bot chirping happily and clumsily digging through Tony’s clothes in a misguided attempt to dress him. (Tony was all for encouraging his bot in secret, he’d missed Dummy way more than he wanted to admit these last couple of years, but he drew the line at being offered a pair of dark washed jeans that he could tell from a glance would look like they were painted on. Bad enough that they might not fit at all, but even if he
Phil did not like being made to wait, and Clint still thought his plan was awesome, but Natasha was able to distract both of them by beginning an epic rant about how her other self had never redacted her ‘Iron Man: Yes, Tony Stark: No’ report which, somehow, ended with yet
looking at Peter precisely that way. Ned turned his head, and Peter’s heart went to his throat looking for any sign of submission from the other boy, any indication at all that this wasn’t all in his head. Instead, Ned pointed to a beefy looking guy across the street who was exiting the 24 hour gym on the corner.
“Good, good boy,” Steve crooned. “Keep your legs spread wide for me, now. I want to see, Tony. I want to see all of you. You asked me not to let you hide, remember? Now slide it in for me, nice and slow. We’re not in any kind of rush here. Just like you weren’t the other day, when you held Phil’s cock in your mouth, just kept it nice and warm for him.”
done something out of care brought comfort to Peter. (So like the other Tony again, the way he’d shied away for so long from comfort and affection if it was offered too directly. It was almost eerie.) The kid gaped, his mouth hanging open as the snow in his hair slowly began to melt and drip onto the floor underneath him. Steve wanted to offer a towel, or some of the ample leftovers from their dinner. Hell, there was a hundred things he wanted to do for someone Tony considered his own, but he stayed silent just like the rest of the team, not pretending to be ignorant to the scene in the room but too afraid of stepping in and shattering the thin, shaky ice Tony and this version of his child stood on.
Despite that one moment of weirdness, Peter spent most of the weekend so delighted by his reunion with Ned that he forgot to give Gwen and her performance much thought until it came time for decathlon practice on Monday. They were scheduled to be practicing for the interview portion in pairs, but Gwen—Peter’s assigned partner—was nowhere to be found.
“Kill the music, JARVIS. I uh…I didn’t know if you did this, in your universe, or if you’d want to. I can go.” The bots all beeped in protest at this offer, and Barnes placed a comforting hand on You’s strut. The bot, who at least in Tony’s own universe tended to be the most withdrawn and task-focused of the three, wheeled closer to Barnes as if drawing comfort from the touch which…Tony was way, way too hungover for the realization that his own bots had apparently replaced him with James bloody Barnes.
Just because they couldn’t be everything to each other, though, didn’t mean they had to be nothing. Rhodey had been determined, right from the moment this Tony had arrived into their universe and had looked at Rhodey like he was the only sure thing left, never to fall into that trap again. And now, instead of fighting Tony’s existing partners every step of the way, they’d invited him to stay. He still had little concrete information about what precisely that would look like, but for the first time in nearly a decade, with Tony’s hands clutching desperately at his own, Rhodey had
to it, maybe even moreso than—than.” Than their Tony, Steve filled in with another quiet growl. Had Bruce forgotten just how lovely their Tony had been when he’d been fed? The way his sinful tongue would play with their fingers, how he’d go quiet and soft and peaceful, accepting his submission without a fight the way he so rarely managed? They were some of Steve’s favourite memories, and the comparison rankled. “He ate more than I’ve seen him manage since he got here, and he was relaxed and responsive. So fucking responsive. I couldn’t help it, I swear I would never have done it if I’d known how he would respond. Or how I would. I didn’t do anything, when I realized we were both…aroused I left, but then he looked so hurt and now he’s not here.” The air felt like it was sucked from the rom as Bruce stared around at all of them with thinly-veiled desperation. “Please. I wasn’t trying to manipulate him or force this kind of reaction. I know he’s not a sub.”
“STARK!” Taskmaster spat, casting his eyes around the room in a panicked attempt to locate the ‘real’ Iron Man amidst a sea of nearly identical armours. Seconds later, he found Tony himself leaning against the bar in jeans and a Captain America tee shirt, entirely unharmed. (Steve breathed his own sigh of relief at the sight. Knowing that this Tony didn’t need the arc reactor to keep his heart functioning safely hadn’t made it any less unnerving to watch someone take it from him.) Taskmaster made to move in, but in seconds Tony had tapped the glowing reactor on his chest; while the Bleeding Edge armour emerged to cover him, those same crescent-shaped shields Tony had used so effectively during his little showcase in the gym encircled his enemy, sparking menacingly. Next to Steve, Natasha stepped out of her own armour, her Widow’s Bites trained unerringly on Taskmaster’s jugular.
Pepper paced the entrance to Avengers Tower until one of the security guards on duty, a twenty-something army vet named Henry who had been invalided out after an injury to his left leg, came out to gently inquire if she was actually going to enter the building or not.
“Some degree?” Pepper asked. The piece of cucumber dangling from between her fingers looked especially delicious, and Tony took advantage of her distraction to make a lunge for it. Across the room Clint made a harsh grunting noise that Tony couldn’t easily interpret. Cap seemed a little startled too, though he hid it slightly better than Barton by taking a handful of snap peas from the tray on the table.
“’Tis not so simple as that, mine Clint,” he declared sadly. Phil, though, seemed to finally be on drunk!Clint’s side, because he too was on his feet. Steve looked dubiously at Phil and blocked his exit from the kitchen.
Having retreated safely to his quarters, Peter went through the motions of finishing his meal, then washed up in the ensuite bathroom. It was full of the kinds of skin and hair products that Aunt May would probably lose her mind over, but he stuck to the basics of his routine-- a quick wash of his face with drugstore soap followed by brushing and flossing his teeth. When he re-entered his room, he cast an unwilling glance toward the Spider-Man suit that he hadn’t worn once since downloading the AI Tony had sent over from the other universe into it. Peter stared at it every night and felt the pull of temptation to put it on. He already knew what a relief it would be to hear Tony’s voice again, to be able to seek out his support and hear his terrible jokes and mine his almost encyclopedic knowledge.
Tony had barely managed to suck down a cup of coffee and take another for the road before Dummy had all but shoved him into the elevator, so it was maybe not all that outrageous that his brain took a good forty or so seconds upon entering the workshop to realize that he was not alone. James Barnes was there, listening to some godforsaken country western number and
The penthouse was quiet and looked to be entirely empty when Steve peered tiredly out of the elevator.
She, too, sounded young…Tony stopped admiring the tech long enough to look, really look, at the people in the room. Not one of them could have been older than fifteen. He continued to watch, grinning as they bantered with one another. But there was support and gentleness, too; when the counterbalance on one of the kid’s attempts at a search and rescue assistance bots went awry, the others were quick to offer reassurance and suggestions for the next trial. The room sparked with the kind of energy that no one, not even Tony, could reproduce, a heady cocktail of youth and innovation and community.
“Hate you? You think I could hear you say something like this, that you’re happy enough with your life outside the armour that you can let Iron Man go, that I’ll
Seconds later, Tony’s world was upended as Steve flipped them over, looming over Tony precisely the same way he had on the morning they’d come closest to this, before the alarm to assemble had gone off. Except this time Tony was stripped bare under Steve’s gaze, and Steve was taking full advantage of that fact, surveying Tony with such singular attention that he felt himself squirm under the regard. The wool-silk blend of Steve’s pants rubbed up against his naked thighs as Tony moved, and he huffed out a breath of surprised arousal at the way it felt to be on the other side of the clothed-in-bespoke-formalwear/naked dynamic.
“I do. To be crass, SHIELD and myself personally have a tremendous amount of power and influence in the current climate, and we rarely ever spend that currency. I’d be happy to do so for this if it was something you both wanted.” Masdee nodded, tracing a finger across the smooth glass of the table in thought. It was an unusual gesture from her or from any members of the Wakandan army who tended toward rigid postures even in more informal moments, but then Masdee was not just a general here and now and everyone knew it.
“It’s an honour and a privilege, sweetheart. Come pull your pillow closer to me, hmm, and let's get started with something simple, something I know you love.”
“Though I am quite enjoying our current pursuits, I am in fact quite hungry. Shall we partake of the fine Midgardian tradition of summoning food to appear at our door?”
loss had all but torn Tony’s mind and heart in two; as the boy had lay dying, pleading for his life (
“There were. And you had enough evidence about how the serum worked to suggest that if you did something like eject yourself during the landing, you had a strong shot at survival. But you didn’t even give SHIELD your coordinates, did you? Because whether you attempted the ejection or not, the bottom line was you didn’t want to be found. You didn’t want to have a chance.”
He’d been asthmatic before the bite, she knew that from stories. He didn’t ever seem to struggle with it these days, but whatever was in the goddamn Thor juice (and how dare he get her stressed to the point where she was referring to it that way, even internally!) was wreaking havoc on his damn system. And MJ officially felt out of her league. Even then she’d still tried her best to keep Peter’s condition on the DL. After multiple assurances from Tony Stark’s AI that she would monitor Peter, MJ had sprinted back to the main building with the intent of sneaking in and finding the inhaler Peter had said he had ‘probably’ packed. Except then she’d been met at the door by a stony-faced Steve Rogers, Sam Wilson, and Bucky Barnes.
them to see. Wanted to remind them that he was Iron Man in this universe or any other. Their Tony might have had most of the things he himself had dreamed about, and several things Tony would never have even thought to ask for, but
Tony’s good intentions, however, didn’t stop Steve’s shoulders from stiffening, or prevent his hand from drifting away from Tony’s thigh.
Also, the portrayal of Christine Everhart is also very much a nod to dixiehellcat's wonderful Wordsmith verse!
Well, that was actually fairly easy. Tony had liked a lot about last night: Steve’s crop, his tortuously wonderful glass toys, the way he fucked like a machine…
kind of doctor even if you do seem to have upped your skill level in this universe. Look, let’s just…can we skip the check-up and get right to the science lollipop please?”
“I really am happy for all of you, Steve,” Domen told him as she folded the note back up with care. That seemed like rather more showmanship than was necessary, but when Steve cocked his head in question…was Domen
“Well sure but they’re also—no, no, stop. I am not debating which Star Wars vehicle would be a better choice for my make believe world where things are easy and stuff just gets handed to me. That’s not my life, Mr.—Tony. And pretending that it is for a day or a week while you use me to make yourself feel better about being rich or whatever, that’ll just make it worse. Please, I—I appreciate what you did with the bills and everything, but please just go.”
Hearing it now when it had already been so long was almost his undoing. They’d kept their distance from one another, he and the other Pep, after their breakup. And when he’d seen her after the Snap Pepper had taken to wearing sneakers almost exclusively, always prepared to run or hide or rush to assist a member of the team or a civilian. (She’d worn her Suit, too, and she was just as amazing and incandescent as Rescue as he’d long thought she would be. But Tony would have traded that, would have traded just about anything, to see her in a crisp suit and a towering pair of heels again.)
The documents were, as Coulson had said, quite preliminary. There were half-finished profiles of potential members, a mission statement that was a disjointed mess, and incomplete designs for some kind of deep space facility called The Peak. (That last one made Tony shudder. If the Battle of New York had made him wary of space, his full on Lost in Space experience post-Titan had virtually guaranteed that Tony would have zero interest in ever returning. Still, maybe there was a way around that somehow? He didn’t have to physically be there for the program to work, did it?)
“Hmm.” When Clint spoke again, it was in the closest to what Tony had learned was his Dominant tone that Clint had ever directed at him. “If—
“That why you hate him?” Bucky volleyed this accusation back at him with the airy tone anyone else might use to ask if Steve had used the last of the sugar or changed the television channel without asking. That only made it hit harder, knocking Steve in the gut and nearly doubling him over.
how much I strive toward punctuality—” She brandished a tube of mascara with the same ferocity he had seen villains and heroes alike wield knives and longswords, and with no less of a sense of deadly intent.
Rhodey grinned and reached over to ruffle his hair. He, at least, was apparently still willing to touch Tony even though those touches didn’t mean what the team had thought they did that morning. Tony let himself lean into it, just for a moment.
“Sure, I mean, it’s possible. I made a lot of the same fuck ups here as in my own world, so I get it. But then maybe you’ve got it all wrong.” Bucky was already shaking his head, and Tony wagged a chiding finger at him. “You have to consider all the potential options if you want to be scientific about this. Is not equally possible that what’s remarkable about those similarities is that no matter what’s been done to you, in every universe you always find your way back? To Steve, to yourself, to pretty much everything that made you who you were, you always come back. Which, really, is the best middle finger to HYDRA I can imagine, and I’m pretty sure I have flipped off at least a few of their membership by now.”
“JARVIS you devious little shit. You’re seriously going to make me reverse the polarity on this thing?”
Like a good futurist, he simply knew now what was going to happen next. There was no way to change it, even if the past decade of fighting and clawing and scratching his way to survival hadn’t made Tony weary beyond measure. He was a part of the Stones, could never have existed without them, probably should never have existed at all. The best he could hope at this point was that when the gauntlet came to him (and it would, he knew that now regardless of the team’s current plan to have Bruce/Hulk handle it) Tony would make it count.
“So maybe we turn it into some kind of competition where they each lead a small team,” Phil had proposed, looking like he was one step short of rubbing his hands together in delight at the prospect of playing with the Avenger’s pressure points to improve their performances. (This
“I mean, and seriously, to not even tell the team? I get not wanting to spread the news around and make ‘em a target, but no one but Nat even knew? What kind of a douchebag does that, anyway?” Clint took an angry gulp of his beer, scowling at it when it emptied as if the beer had somehow been on the whole ‘conceal other-Clint’s wife and family from the Avengers’ plan too.
Many events that followed still aligned roughly with the MCU. Thanos’s arrival, for instance, and the Avengers’ eventual loss, played out essentially the same. However, because Stark had neither a wife nor a child to cling to in the aftermath of that loss, he was not content to wait five years before attempting to correct what Thanos had done. (Scott Lang was luckily removed the quantum realm much earlier in this version of events.)
An excellent question! Professor Hulk did indeed exist in Stark’s original universe. However, I’ve always suspected their union in this form was in many ways a sacrifice. It was one Dr. Banner felt was necessitated by the urgency of attempting to undo the Snap, but not necessarily a choice he might otherwise have made.
Peter barely spared him a glance. His eyes were fixed on Steve as if might develop some kind meta-human ability to burn through him with a glance. Sadly, such power proved elusive, but eventually Steve seemed to realize something was wrong. He jogged toward the pair of them, a furrowed look of concern creasing the usually baby-smooth spot between his eyebrows. Peter abruptly hated him more for the show of care. How dare he bother when Steve, like Tony, was just going to abandon Peter too?
“Rhooodey, come on, make him quit it,” Tony whined. Rhodes levelled a thoroughly unimpressed stare at his friend without missing a beat.
A rare few seconds of silence greeted this pronouncement. He didn’t dare look at Pepper this time, but Tony did revel in the sound of a long exhale from behind him, like someone had let out a breath they hadn’t realized they were holding. It didn’t even matter which of them it had been.
Thank you all, as always, for your wonderful kudos, questions and comments about this series. I absolutely love hearing from you in all forms!
“It’s a little bit tied to the non-sexual submission stuff we worked on the other day, especially our conversations about money. You do need to learn that the fact that you’re rich doesn’t mean we want or need you to always be the one paying for stuff. But more than that, honestly, I just want you to blow off some steam. Take a little vacation from everything, even the orientation stuff. It’s been an intense week, and I want you to just take our credit cards and buy anything you see that you like; I know there are places loyal enough to you around here that they would shut their stores to the public for an hour. You and Rhodey could make a day of it. Make it part of a welcome thing for him too, get both of you something pretty.”
. It was the first time since his carefully constructed and heavily fortified mental dams had shattered that he’d felt much of anything beyond the haze of grief and regret and pain. Boredom wasn’t exactly the feeling he would have chosen to take their place, but pretty much anything was preferable to how he’d spent the past couple of weeks.
In under three seconds, Natasha had her deadliest blade aimed at Taskmaster, hovering unerringly just above his jugular. Steve hesitated briefly, wondering whether or not he would need to step in before she actually did the other man serious harm, but there was a reason Natasha was his second in command. He’d long since learned that she was usually the most in control precisely when she appeared just on the edge of losing it.
Steve smiled, because he couldn’t help it. It felt so good to hear Tony babble again. Despite the gut-punch it had been to walk in here and see his former lover on the screen, it was even reassuring to know that Tony was committed to this too, that they were in it together no matter how impossible the task they had been set was. (He’d made the right decision coming up here.)
Coulson’s hands found Steve’s, cradling the battered knuckles and scraped palms without pressure or judgement. And he waited. Steve had been the one to call for radio silence, so only Steve would end it. (He loved Coulson and hated him in almost equal measures in moments like this.)
“JARVIS, unlock storage vault 19B and have it brought up from the sub-basement to the workshop level ASAP. Key its access to P. Coulson, override code 9204112. And have it delivered by one of the service bots, we can’t have anyone knowing he’s here. In fact, Blackout conditions for all but the team, please.” Coulson moved through this workshop with maybe even more ease than Tony himself, ordering JARVIS around and digging tools out of the wrong damn places, and was Phony some kind of neat-freak or had the team
“She’s fast as hell,” he observed aloud, “but her powers aren’t particularly well-controlled yet. And look, back up about thirty seconds. She’s not just paying homage to Carol, she’s mimicking a bunch of her moves—some others too. Shit.”
“Uh…six, maybe. After the surgery things got better, but after Siberia…it got worse again. The shield collapsed parts of the artificial sternum they made to hold things in place once the arc reactor was gone.”
“I’m fine,” Peter repeated. “We have what we were after. We know he’s safe and healthy and—and not coming back. Nothing else to discuss, really. So I’m fine.”
“The Ultron program was never intended to be the be-all end-all of global security. It was intended as a part of something bigger, a whole system designed to monitor, contain and engage extraterrestrial threats before they become local problems, which is when they would become SHIELD jurisdiction.”
“I’m going to get you changed back into something more comfortable. Is that okay, sweetheart?” (Fuck. His Pep had never gone in for nicknames, not even when they were together. Even though he knew there was no romantic future for himself and this version of her, he wanted to fold himself inside that naked affection in her tone and never, ever come out again.) He swallowed around the lump in his throat and nodded, sitting passively as she raised his arms and unzipped the SI hoodie, replacing it with an oversized sweater his other self must have lifted from Rhodey (though it felt differently shaped than his Rhodey-handoffs.) The pants followed; Pepper encouraged him to lie back on the bed, slid off his sweats and replaced them with a pair of soft gingham pyjama pants. Then she’d crawled into the bed, positioning herself behind him so that when he slid up toward the headboard he could rest his head against her chest and let her wrap all her limbs around him like an octopus. It was an encompassing, nearly-suffocating hold, and the only force in the world that felt capable of grounding him right at that moment.
Even the distant threat of losing Tony finally seemed to do it for Natasha. Her feet came back to the floor and she sat up straighter in her chair, looking Steve directly in the eye with the kind of intensity he usually only saw during SHIELD and Avengers missions.
Content Notes: A few things going on in this one to be aware of. First, the chapter features a non-sexual punishment of Tony by Rhodey. (The guidelines around punishment were negotiated before and are entirely consistent with Tony's expressed limits, but if you don't want to see him punished by anyone but the folks he's in a romantic relationship with, you'll want to skip starting from the paragraph that begins, "To be fair" and pick up again after the paragraph that ends, "respective plans for the day.") Second, the chapter features depictions of MCU characters actively grieving Tony's loss. (That's harder to avoid or read around, but let me know if you want to try.) Finally, the chapter ends on a fairly substantial cliffhanger. That's not normally something I warn for, but I know a lot of us already have enough anxiety on our plates these days, so if you want to wait to read this one until the next chapter is also posted, that's totally fine. I did try, actually, to get the next chapter written and ready so I could mitigate this issue by posting them on the same day, but I just couldn't do it. Sorry team.
Those days were supposedly behind him now. He’d told May about Spider-Man, and not only had he miraculously survived that conversation, but Peter had also somehow managed to find himself officially committed to some kind of mentor/mentee thing with Tony Stark. (Who, it turned out, was not the Tony Stark of this world, but Peter tried pretty hard not to think about that very often because the whole thing was weird enough without any kind of multiverse shenanigans to consider. Plus whenever he let his mind linger too long on the other universe it sort of made him hate the other Peter, which was pretty outrageous given that Peter wasn’t even totally sure he wanted Stark around.)
“So all the Doms here are…what, service Doms?” Again, Bruce laughed, the motion sending a bit of hair flying forward. For just a second, Tony ached to brush it away, which was weird. Had it really only taken one day of this version of the team being touchy-feely with him (
“It…really you. Banner try explain, dead-not-dead….Hulk not understand.” Hulk hung his head with this admission; he wasn’t nearly at the intelligence level of the Hulk-Bruce combo that Tony had teasingly called ‘Professor Hulk’ one or twice, but clearly he took pride in Bruce’s efforts to teach him about the world. He didn’t want to have to confess to failing.
T’Challa. Sam. Scott. Nebula. Bucky. Carol. Steve. Wanda. Thor. Shuri. Bruce. ClintClintClint. Their names tasted like the sweetest honey on her lips as she whispered them soundlessly to herself. They’d made it. They’d done it. They were here, and by some absurd miracle so was Natasha. It was finally over.
“Shh! And yes, it talks. That’s the AI that Tony installed.” While Ned was moaning in wordless glee at this development, Peter gave in to the somewhat reckless urge to take a picture. The scene was ridiculous, the sleek brightness of the mask clashing horribly with Ned’s robot pyjama pants and his worn Nintendo shirt. But he couldn’t not have a record of this moment, when the two parts of his life that had once felt irreconcilable were coming together with such easy joy. Far from being offended, Ned started mugging it up for the camera. He pretended to shoot webs from his middle fingers, then made a show of pushing his desk chair across the room while pretending it weighed roughly the same as a car. Peter cackled and captured it all, their antics growing steadily more absurd (and loud) until Ned’s Mom called them to the kitchen for breakfast. On a whim, he sent one of the images to Tony. He captioned and deleted and re-captioned the picture several times before deciding to send it without commentary, but Tony seemed to recognize it for the ‘thank you’ it was all the same.
It would have been easy, Steve guessed, for Rhodes to use all of that creativity, and the rapport and history he had with both versions of Tony, to isolate the two of them, forming their own little world full of inside jokes and unconditional, unwavering trust. He could have turned himself into the ‘good cop,’ or at the very least refused to take on any forms of Dominance that would make Tony remotely uncomfortable. Instead he pushed the hardest, demanded the most of Tony precisely because he could. It was humbling in the best of ways to watch, and Steve couldn’t quite stop himself from letting his hand linger on Rhodes’ shoulder for just a couple seconds longer than something strictly friendly. The other man grinned back .
It wasn’t low stakes, though, at least not for Steve. He held his breath for the close to a minute that it took Natasha to put Tony on his knees and slip the ball gag into his mouth. It was a good choice for a beginner—small, breathable, not something that would make him drool or cause him discomfort if worn for several hours—but he still found himself on edge, awaiting a sudden show of panic or anger.
“Food.” Unlike their first real meeting, when Steve had been struck by how little Tony had seemed affected by his Dominant register, this time the other man seemed to go from half-comatose to standing at full attention at the mere hint of Steve’s command. “Food,” he repeated, “then a bath, then sleep.”
If you need a redacted version or have questions, feel free to let me know. As always, take care of yourselves!
And then they’d met Kala. He was a Polynesian artist with a small shop near Clint’s old apartment. He’d agreed readily to the exclusivity clause, in large part because it aligned neatly with his own policy of never making any design more than once.
Content Notes: The first vision takes place immediately following the scene in Chapter 48, and as such the warnings from that chapter for sexual content still apply (though this one is slightly less explicit than the main chapter.)
good. You worry so much about being good for us, being submissive enough, when the truth of it is we can barely keep up with you. That’s…Tony, waiting to orgasm like that, denying yourself that way while you wait for your Dominants’ approval, that’s deeper submissive behaviour than I would have dreamed of expecting from you at this point. But we can’t just…we need to talk about this, okay? How did it make you feel, that kind of submission?”
“What’s the Iron Legion?” The question came not from Steve himself, but from Bucky. He was propped on a truly obscene pile of pillows on the floor next to Tony, and had been halfway to a lazy, shallow form of his own subspace mere seconds before. Steve was fairly certain he was nowhere near that headspace now, but there was no telling it from just looking at the guy. Bucky stayed sprawled across his pillow tower, his head lolled to one side and all his muscles lax, looking for all the world like he was asking something as inconsequential as Tony’s favourite colour or celebrity crush.
“Yeah, I know. I know you need that so badly, hmm? Want to be raw and open, nowhere left to hide from me. From any of us. I’ll still teach you espionage, I swear I’ll show you how to lie to everyone else, but not from us. Never from us. Next time we do this I’m starting you off right away with a spreader bar, keep you nice and wide and open for me.” One of Clint’s fingers trailed down, circling Tony’s hole and rubbing up against his perineum with the same unhurried air with which he’d touched Tony’s cock. It was maddening. His hips rose, an invitation and a plea and a demand all at once. Clint ignored it all, settling his hand back around Tony’s cock. His only concession was to bring his other hand into play, reaching beneath the first to roll Tony’s balls idly and flick and tug lightly at the sensitive skin there. Tony was alarmed and awed to realize he was near tears.
Steve kept closer to the source of the noise, which turned out to be Tony’s bedroom. His hand was on the door when the indistinct noises turned into a word.
This Stark’s life is in full alignment with the events of the MCU up until the superhero Civil War. He and Pepper Potts never reunited as more than friends following their ‘break.’ As such, Stark's recovery from those events was more incomplete, because he had very little in the way of support.
Sam let the silence between them linger, his gradually slowing breathing on the other end the only indication he hadn’t just disconnected the call entirely. Not so long ago Steve wouldn’t have been able to sit in it, he would have pressed and prodded until Sam either forgave him or exploded. It was still hard, and patience would never be his strong suit, but it was impossible to argue with the results when giving Tony the space he’d asked for had ended so positively for both of them just a few hours prior.
Phil provides a hands-on lesson about the value of honesty, and Tony learns why no one messes with Dom-Coulson. With a date with Tony finally on the horizon, Steve is a giant sap.
Despite Tony’s fears about the murmured threat of multiple orgasms, Clint didn’t seem to be in a hurry after that. He wouldn’t even let Tony do anything about his hard-on, which didn’t abate much even as they sprawled out on the playroom bed.
An interesting question worth exploring from the limited perspective of Stark himself. They did, indeed, inform Stark he had done well numerous times, but as you’ll see, that doesn’t mean they’re not working through the implications of the scene themselves.
Tony continued to casually complain about Clint Barton—Hawkeye!—the same way May used to complain about Ben leaving towels on the floor, as if this was nothing but a domestic squabble. Which Peter supposed it would be, even if to an outsider watching Tony Stark invent new state of the art weaponry for the Avengers was about as far from mundane as things got. Eventually, though, the novelty started to wear off enough that Peter didn’t feel like he’d miss something by retrieving his backpack and unpacking his web-fluid supplies.
“I’m going to need more information,” he said cautiously. Thor shook his head, his eyes downcast. “Thor. You’re putting yourself in my hands, yes?”
It seemed morbidly indulgent to let his mind linger on that particular set of memories, honestly. On any given day a good portion of Steve’s mental and emotional energies were devoted to keeping those kinds of thoughts safely contained, unless it was one of the times he was allowed to retreat to Tony’s room. (He choked at the realization that he would never be able to do that again now that the new Tony had officially moved in. It would never smell like
Instead, he hadn’t made it two steps back toward the bed when JARVIS announced Thor’s arrival. He stepped into Steve’s…well, technically Tony’s, bedroom without knocking or even waiting for Steve to pass along his permission to JARVIS. This was odd in itself. No matter how comfortable Thor had grown with them all, he had still spent much more of his life as a Prince who observed strict protocols on behaviour and etiquette. He didn’t look quite like himself either. Thor was the only one of them who tended not to bear physical signs of tiredness, even after a week as intense as the one they’d had, but he certainly appeared weary now. His head hung, nothing like the proud posture that Thor wore as naturally as breathing, and his long blonde hair hung dank around his shoulders as if he hadn’t bothered to wash it in days.
my other active series tomorrow. Hooray! Here's to (hopefully) being back on a regular posting schedule after a couple rough weeks.
“What, that’s all it takes to knock me off my mantle?” Tony clutched his chest as if mortally wounded.
know him this well? “This is one of my favourite things to do with a submissive,” Steve explained, maybe because he saw the question on Tony’s face, and maybe just because he wanted Tony to know. “I like to watch you overwhelm yourself, force you to participate in taking yourself down.”
“No,” Steve said simply. He didn’t explain, didn’t apologize or justify his apparent desire to have Tony naked while Steve himself was draped all over by sumptuous, clinging fabrics; whatever hesitation he’d had left had vanished the moment Tony had consented to this, and the thought made Tony’s toes curl and his gut clench. Still, maybe because Tony was a contrary bastard, or maybe because he’d always made a habit of pushing every version of Steve he'd ever known, some part of him didn’t want to go down too easily.
) “How’d you sleep? Bruce said you refused the sleep aid and the pain meds. Wanna tell me why he offered pain meds in the first place, Tones?”
There was zero pain, which was pretty unsurprising. Before the scene, Bucky had sat the team down and explained that he’d been working through what the emergence of the Soldier aspects of his personality meant. Building on a suggestion from his therapist that the Soldier didn’t solely have to represent trauma, Bucky told them that he’d come to realize that in many ways, the Soldier might be the Dominant aspects of his psyche.
What followed was the frantic pre-mission action Tony had once been all too familiar with. Everyone departed to their own floors to suit up, then trailed back to the penthouse muttering about lost arrows, Widow’s Bites still sized for Thor from the previous training exercise, and whether or not anyone remembered why Thor would have stored his mystical hammer under the couch. There was a weight to this preparation; this team knew what it was to come home from a mission minus one member, after all. But there were also jokes and aiding with zippers and exchanges of power bars while Coulson briefed them on the specifics. The threat itself was relatively benign—a gang of giant and genetically manipulated owls the science team of a major corporation had attempting to use to deliver mail ala Harry Potter had escaped and were spewing questionable foam everywhere—but the birds had dispersed enough that the authorities were requesting the presence of the entire team, including Rhodey who was going to ditch a meeting to join the team uptown. None of the Avengers seemed to fully realize what this meant until Phil caught sight of Tony out of the corner of his eye and stopped mid-sentence.
“You did seem to very genuinely enjoy the bondage—the ritual, the technique, all of that seemed right up your alley.” Tony nodded. Playing with the rope had been fun, and he was already excited to learn to do more advanced stuff with it. “At times, though, it felt almost like you were offering it to Thor, and to Bucky to a lesser extent, more as an act of service than one of Domination.”
“I have to hope that he would have at least tried,” Phil said eventually, after giving the matter a great deal of quiet deliberation. “That’s part of what a handler’s job is supposed to be, anyway; not just making sure you’ll all be in fighting shape, but ensuring your health and wellness of the battlefield as well. It’s…I find it almost criminal that the lot of you weren’t assigned another handler after his passing. From the sounds of it your Captain Rogers was in no position to lead the team on his own. Whether intentionally or not, I think all of you were set up to fail. And I’m very sorry for that.”
Two weeks after the events of the previous chapter, Talia begins to test boundaries in Wakanda while Tony makes several surprising discoveries in the Tower.
“Of who, the Board? We’re convening at 10:00 anyway, and honestly I don’t want to see them before that.”
“There’s more than one way to be submissive in relation to clothes. Lots of subs like bein’ naked, and it does help your Doms to be able to see you like that, but sometimes it’s just as fulfilling to see your sub in clothes you chose for them. The underwear was all Barton, but the rest is stuff I picked. Should be comfortable to exercise in.” Tony groaned, loud enough to be clearly audible even over the shirt he was busy sliding over his head.
“But isn’t it equally possible,” he mused aloud, “that he just needs it that badly? From everything he’s said it’s not like submission doesn’t exist in his own universe, it’s just not something he ever practiced before. And with everything he’s been through,” Phil waved to the rest of the chart, “it’s conceivable that we’ve just gotten really lucky, that he needs to be cared for in precisely the ways we desperately want to care for him.”
Okay, so this chapter was a beast. It was over 7,000 words long, and every time I tried to edit it down it somehow got longer. (What can I say? Wordy author is wordy.) It was also a particularly challenging one to write in a number of respects. So I would particularly love to know your thoughts!
need the submission, Tony. You’ve responded to it strongly since basically the very beginning, when I would imagine the levels of subtonin in your system were all but insignificant.”
“I find myself unworthy of our partnership. For weeks now, I have watched all of you grow closer to our submissive, and I have…yearned. I know it to be unfair. My other self, he harmed Tony in such an intimate, personal way that of course it will take time. But I had hoped that following our date, we might be moving  forward, and I feel instead as if we are standing still. When I learned that he had been spending so many of his evenings with you, and now his morning with the son of Coul, I felt…not angry, precisely, but—”
For all the work and anticipation that had gone into getting them there, Tony and Rhodey’s entrance into the mansion was somewhat anticlimactic. Tony waved at the team, threw a grouchy glare over his shoulder at his friend, and stumbled immediately toward the kitchen in search of coffee. Steve arched a brow at Rhodes, concerned, but the other man laughed and rolled his eyes.
That was all the provocation Tony needed. He was loose after sucking Phil for so long, and the other man’s cock slid its way into his throat with ease. With his hands bound he couldn’t toy with Phil’s balls the way he wanted, but he drew off his cock a few times to suck and nip lightly at his sac. After a while Phil rocked his hips, enough to cut off Tony’s air for just seconds at a time before withdrawing. The last time he did, Tony moaned extravagantly, hoping it would be enough to communicate permission and encouragement to Coulson without actually needing to speak. Phil took the hint, the pumping of his hips becoming deeper, more deliberate. When he came, it was with a grunt and a curse followed by an immediate collapse backward onto the bed.
“I like her,” declared Shuri’s voice over the video-chat, just as youthful and irreverent as Steve remembered. “Brother, may I keep her?” T”Challa said something off-screen that made Shuri roll her eyes and mutter something about broken white boys. “Keep talking, snarky white girl.” Talia grinned.
“That was different,” Natasha protested. She was sprawled in a makeshift hammock she had fashioned in the corner of the room, which threatened to spill her over the side any time she breathed too deeply. “The other Tony never chose to leave. This one might.”
“Okay, so we’ve decided then? We’re going with the independent leatherworker, Kala Ipo. Everyone raise your hands one time so that we can make this official and close this tumultuous chapter please.”
“I don’t, Steve, really. But I’m not on full vacation like the rest of you, and since we don’t know when or if I should be pleasant for scenes like this, might as well get that stuff done.”
“I want to. It was never that I didn’t want, well, pretty much anything you want to give me.” Tony couldn’t quite help but snort, which lead to Bruce reaching out to touch him for the first time in the conversation. It was a hand pressed to the small of Tony’s back, nothing in the grand scheme of things, but it felt like sucking in the first deep breath after nearly suffocating. “It’s true, Tony. I panicked because of my issues, which we can talk about later and at length if you want, but which are mostly about the fact that I’m still grieving too, and moving on is different in the abstract than it is in the material. I was scared and a little bit sad, and guilty because I never would have done something like that if I’d known the effect it would have on us both, not without talking about it first. But none of those reasons mean I don’t care for you, or want you, and none of them should have lead me to leave you alone after you’d just hit subspace for what I’m guessing was the first time. I am truly and deeply sorry.”
The takedown of the deflector shield was the closest Natasha came to causing real damage to Tony. Thor fared little better. When he took to the air Tony followed immediately, the remaining energy shields followed and attached themselves at his back and shoulders. When Thor shot a cautious bolt of lightning, the shields absorbed and reflected the energy back immediately. Tony followed up by turning his hands into what looked like overlarge canons; the repulsor blasts that issued from them was powerful enough to send the demi-god hurtling into one of the cushioned walls clear on the opposite side of the gym. In true Thor fashion, he laughed uproariously, too busy being delighted by the prospect of a challenging new sparring partner to care about any wounds to his ego.
He couldn’t agree or disagree, not yet. But he could ask for the one thing that his mind was becoming increasingly fixated on the longer his head was practically in Phil’s lap.
“It’s not your fault, Tony.” Bruce wasn’t one of the people who had laughed, Tony was pretty sure, but nor was he hiding his amusement particularly well. “Bucky has always had a particularly—well, powerful Dominant voice, especially for a Switch. Add to that the fact that you’re not used to your system responding to vocal aspects of Domination, and, well…”
“Gonna last long enough to actually let him tie you, buddy?” Clint teased, sprawling out on the large bed next to Natasha. Thor whined.
. He’d told Bucky as much the day it had happened. How had Steve turned into this mess, a man who lived in his memories and couldn’t manage to give voice to the reality of his present? Was he really this far gone?
Thank you from the bottom of my heart for reading, and for your comments, kudos and questions. They mean even more to me right now. I hope you all stay well and safe.
“Okay. You need to shut up right now,” he snapped, throwing his safety goggles onto the bench. Tony blinked.  Peter felt terrible but also almost outside of himself with irritation, because Tony had just suggested the coolest thing Peter had ever heard in his entire life, and it was his damn fault Peter couldn’t even enjoy the moment!
version of himself, a prospect that just increased the risk that somewhere down the line, Tony would fuck up and they’d all be caught out. Eventually, they’d unhappily settled on having him step fully in to Mark II’s shoes, picking up his life roughly where he’d left off.
Peter is momentarily baffled. Then he remembers that Rhodey had asked Peter for a copy of the code containing AI Tony. In the fog of hurt and disbelief he’d felt after receiving Tony’s missive, Peter hadn’t given it much thought. If he had, he would have assumed Rhodes was double-checking the source of the code, making sure there was nothing malicious or fragmented in there. Instead, it sounds like AI-Tony is now running War Machine. For Peter, who hasn’t been able to put on his own suit since installing the new AI, it’s nothing short of outrageous.
Bruce padded into the room somewhere around Tony’s fourth cup. He wore a pair of faded, soft-looking jeans with a black and white striped v-neck. The latter was more stylish and playful than anything Tony had ever seen either version of Bruce wear. He watched appreciatively as Bruce went through the motions of making himself a cup of tea.
“So, just to recap.” Clint was drawling in that way that most people read as amused or even callous, but which the team had long ago learned meant he was attempting to mask the strength of an emotional response (usually anger, but sometimes fear made Clint sound this way too.) “Tony was accidentally taken into some version headspace, maybe for the first time in his life, and then promptly abandoned. He immediately proceeded to drop, as did Bruce I can only assume.” Bruce nodded tightly, all the muscles at his jaw clenched. “Phil kind of accidentally brought Tony out of the drop a bit, but he’s still upset enough by the whole thing that he’s hiding from all of us. Oh and he may or may not have been experimenting with other forms of submission for days now, without anyone but Nat figuring it out.”
“Tony and I have his check-in to handle. If it’s alright with Tony I would like you to remain here for it, Natasha, so that I can keep an eye on you while you put some ice on that knee. After that I’ll send Tony on his way, and we’ll have Clint come down for his own check-in, and we'll discuss punishment for the two of you.”
“What? You think she has some kind of memorization similar to Taskmaster?” Steve asked. Tony sighed, peering back at the screen and wishing desperately that he were wrong. But he wasn’t. The copying was nowhere near the picture-perfect recreations Taskmaster had been able to manage. It was more akin to the countless times Tony had seen his own movements in the armour mimicked by people he passed in the street.
at Steve for days now. He held himself stiffly, all military bearing except for the way his arms were wrapped around his own midsection, as if he were recovering from or preparing for a blow. There was stubble on his face, too, and this version of the guy had always been clean-shaven; his sudden resemblance to his counterpart’s post-Civil War aesthetic made Tony want to sob. He ached to curl up at Steve’s feet and beg for forgiveness until his knees ached and his throat was hoarse. He wanted to run from this room and never have to meet Steve’s hurt, bewildered gaze ever again.
He tried to edge his way out of the kitchen. It shouldn’t have been hard with so many people, really, but Rhodey had always been good at noticing precisely the things Tony wished he wouldn’t, and he wasted no time in wrapping a lazy but firm hand around Tony’s wrist.
“Alright sweetheart, here’s how this is going to go. I’m going to warm you up a little bit with my hand, and then you’re going to take ten a piece with a strap from myself, Nat, Thor, Clint, and Bucky. We’re new to each other in this way, so if you feel like you need a different tool, or fewer strikes, or any other adjustments, you can feel free to say. We’ll stay within the limits outlined in your contract. We’ll check in frequently, and James will be monitoring you, too, for any signs of distress. You can—and should, actually—let your body respond however it wants, whether that’s to cry or yell or anything else.”
