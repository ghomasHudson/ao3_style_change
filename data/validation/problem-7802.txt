"Hello, Sweet cheeks. What's up?" I asked. "Well, I just wanted to let you know that-"
"Was not.!" he yelled back.
"Oh, So Tony's Iron man...Uh."
It all started with one call.
"I...Nothing, Well I just thought you'd be...Taller." I said with a laugh. He put his hand over his heart, with a look of fake hurt. "Well, I never." He stated, which made the kids laugh. Causing everyone else to laugh with them. I look to Nat, "So the other guy was...Thor.?"
No Summary for this Chapter.
After "My walk" I went back to the house. By time I got back it was already dark. So I decided to sneak in trying to be quiet as possible. I tiptoed my way through the front door and into the living room to grab my bag. So far the close was clear, some of the lights were already off. So I assumed that meant everybody had went to bed. That was until I heard someone clear their throat. I look towards the kitchen to see everyone staring at me. Plus some new guy with an eye patch.
"Hi." He waved, with a small but noticeable smile. I watched as Nat smiled to herself, probably thinking no one noticed.
"Is she another one of your kids we didn't know about?" I turned to see who spoke. A man, an older gentleman, he had some farcical hair. His eyes where narrowed as he looked at me. "Umm," I turned to Clint to see if it was okay to say. He gave me a nod to go on.
"No." He said firmly.
Priceless.
I slipped into my tight fitting black-cat suit, I model it after Nat's Black Widow outfit. But mine was a bit different, mine was fire and bulletproof. Also it came with a hooded mask attached to it. I had to go though many models of the suit to finally get it to mold right with my powers. Twelve models to be exact.
As I grabbed the last person, I moved him aside right as the train burst through the brick building. As it crashed through it a red mist formed around the train. Making the train make this terrible screeching noise as it dug into the ground. I look to the massive hole the train has made. Seeing the train has made a complete stop. I see a girl with long brown hair run off the train and over to pietro. That must be Wanda.
Antony…
When it came to men, he’d always had a weak spot for the blonde bulky sort of guys. And this one hit all the marks.
He laid his metal hand onto her bowed head and brushed his fingers through her long red hair. “I understand,” he said.
“Remember what I said in Monte? About bottling up memories?”
No one had ever told him about lovemaking, and Steve honestly didn’t know when he’d learned the mechanics. It was before he’d started working for Mister Hammer; perhaps in a book he shouldn’t have looked in, or during a conversation with a fella he’d known at Art School.
Waking up after seventy years felt like such a right of passage. Like something pushing him over a threshold, before emptying a bucket full of cold water right over his head.
“I’m fine,” Steve murmured when he caught Bucky’s worried gaze. “I…”
That made Tony’s gaze finally meet his, his eyes narrowing. “Yes?”
Tony stilled, eyeing his hand. After a beat of contemplation, he turned sideways, giving Steve access.
“Me too. Next time I’m in New York, we’ll fly somewhere. Just you and me.”
know that. None of us wants to live in the past. Tony least of all. And no one is expecting you to take her place, you just have to be yourself. Don’t you see how much you helped him already? I haven’t seen him smile in months, and with you… He
There was a long beat of silence. It wasn’t overly dramatic or even uncomfortable, but it was there.
“Maybe,” Tony said, thoughtfully. “Or Zemo decided halfway through that he lost interest.”
, that’s the life I want to live. You’re the only person on the planet who understands what it's like.”
He kept the gut-wrenching parts to himself—the people they couldn’t save, the lives they’d left behind—but he saw it in Tony’s eyes that he understood anyway.
Of course he did. Steve always memorized plans with an ease Tony admired. It didn’t make him feel any better. “Good,” he said with a forced smile. “Then walk me through it.”
There was another chuckle from Barnes, followed by an eye roll. “Good night, love birds.” With that, he was walking into the room, and before Tony could say something, the door was already closing right in their faces.
“Natasha’s a clever one,” Steve replied, his voice steady even as his heart sped up to a frantic rhythm. He felt a small smile steal its way to his lips.
But still.
Tony watched all those seconds fall away—and disappear forever.
Steve swallowed, unable to think of an answer.
“You’re beautiful,” Steve managed to say. He’d always thought so, but never dared to boost Tony’s ego even more.
“Morning,” she said, brushing a finger over one of the more prominent scars on his chest.
[J.A.R.V.I.S.] [chat_server:46954] is online
Natasha hummed in agreement. “That and sexual tension on both sides.”
Steve frowned and pulled, opening it further and trying to loosen the bottom piece. It took him a moment, but when it came free, his eyes widened as he noticed some sort of secret compartment beneath. There was another pack of letters in there, letters in blazing red envelopes, and underneath … a good few dozen bundles of one hundred dollar notes.
without him fleeing to the Bahamas with twenty girls and a container of booze in tow? Believe me,
Steve’s brow found Tony’s and his hold on his hips tightened. “I’ll get you back for that,” he promised, and then, with a grimace that almost looked painful, he suddenly arched his pelvis into Tony, fighting to shove himself deeply into him whenever Tony pulled away.
He grabbed Bucky’s shoulders and pulled with all of his strength. Bucky whirled around and tried to hit him
Steve, but… their Steve.
Tony grinned and pecked a kiss. “True. And in that regard, how about you finally get out of tha–haat…” Tony groaned, loud and surprised, as Steve took a hold of his softened cock, pumping it once with a slow and tight stroke. “Fuck, Steve, that’s chea–hhiiiting.” Tony yelped as Steve lifted him into his arms and made them tumble on the bed together.
play football, so there would’ve been plenty opportunities. And really, if he’d be attracted to Tony, he would’ve noticed by now, right? They’d always been close, they’d hugged, and laughed, and even slept on the same sofa and these things, but that had all been platonic,
“Thought so,” Steve agreed, smiling.
The others were turning around, casting them questioning glances.
Steve gave a mild huff, sitting down next to Tony and casting him a cautious smile. “It’s just a tent. Come on, let me help you.”
Tony sat in a chair on the balcony, staring at the forest that surrounded the compound. He’d been sitting here for the better part of the night, trying to keep the thoughts running around in his head to a minimum.
“Your people are crazy,” Bucky murmured and only slowly dragged his gaze away from him and Tony. There was more he wanted to say, Steve understood that, but now wasn’t the time.
“Down, down we go,” Clint sing-songed, jarring Steve from his thoughts. They’d arrived at the stairwell. Steve smashed the door’s lock with his shield and when they stepped inside the room, the lights went on, revealing an interior Steve was all too familiar with.
It was a bit crazy, wasn’t it? Tony had hoped for some sort of assurance. A ‘Because your life matters to me’ or something equally genuine and heartfelt that could only come from
A long sigh left Steve’s lips as his gaze travelled over the horizon. He was too lost in his thoughts to notice someone stepping up to him. That someone called his name and Steve startled when a hand touched his shoulder. He glanced up and met Rhodey’s eyes.
Steve rushed forward to catch him as his body threatened to waver, all anger immediately shoved aside.
Clever man.
Tony raised a brow at him, setting the cup down. “So you… want us to sit this out?”
"Ian..." Steve started.
,” Tony said pointedly.
Steve frowned as he stared after her. “How will I know him if he doesn’t want to talk to me?”
Tony slumped in his chair, drumming his fingers uneasily on the table edge. But when he spoke, he sounded calm. “It takes time,” he said.
He pointed at Steve’s watch. “We’ve still got time to kill.”
How Tony hadn’t made the connection the second he’d laid eyes on the man’s face was beyond him now. Those
Very quickly, he was immersed in the work, his mind blissfully blank. It was barely eight in the morning, and though he’d built half of the suit’s matrix, Tony was still restless. He needed to
“Why don’t you have a seat?” Tony said, trying to sound welcoming.
“I love you so much,” he whispered into Steve’s hair.
Every hallway was filled with huge portraits of Tony’s ancestors. And the walls seemed to whisper with every step he took. Lifeless eyes trailed his every awkward movement as Stane talked about the mansion’s everyday business.
. To return those gentle gestures and just quit worrying about everything else. And all of that culminated into one thing: Tony was unable to sleep. A grumble of frustration rumbled through him, and he sat up on his bed in defeat.
Very very bad.
team to go there and obtain it.”
She closed her eyes again. “Yeah.”
“I won’t hurt you,” Tony tried to soothe him. “I’m still me.”
Steve stared at him—at the red sunglasses, the expensive jacket, the jittery tapping of Tony’s fingers on the table in front of him, and it was then that he realized, with a sudden jolt, that Tony was
when he saw through the question. “I didn’t imagine it,” he answered instead.
“There’s something I need to tell you,” Tony said eventually, and
He pulled Steve against his chest, moving them a few steps forward and Steve could only let it happen as his pants dropped to the floor. He stepped out of them, now fully naked, and let Tony lead him to the master bed.
care about Steve of course—but fuck if he ever confessed as much.
Tony said, his tone all concentrated and sterile. Steve watched the suit fly back and forth along the building, still shooting repulsor beams at the protective shield once in a while, discussing tactics with JARVIS.
. His mouth hadn’t moved much, by any means, but the way he’d touched Tony—the way his lips had molded against Tony’s—it had been so much more than Tony ever had experienced from a mere kiss.
who really helped me a lot with this chap. Ugh.
A sharp sound left Steve at that, a combination of surprise and laughter and pain. He blinked a few times, to make sure Tony wouldn't see how close he was to tears. It felt at once completely ridiculous, the two of them sitting on the floor and crying over memories from past lives, but at the same time absolutely heartrending.
Tony hesitated. “I… do you want to—”
Staring at the ceiling, Steve let the thoughts come and go as they will. He should call Bucky. It had been too long, and Bucky deserved better from his best friend. Maybe later today, he mused, turning onto his side and watching the light from the digital clock blinking.
If he didn’t let go of Steve now, it would be too late to walk away.
"Did you give him your patented Awkward Flirting?"
Tony hummed in understanding, and the next thing Steve knew, he had wrapped a slick hand around the both of them. Tony put his weight on one elbow and looked down at their cocks, thrusting against Steve’s—and the friction was unbearably good.
No pun intended, much to Steve's utter dismay.
. "I slammed the shield, the shield his father made, into his reactor.” Steve shakes his head, regret swarming him cold. They’ve had this conversation before and no matter how many times Sam tells him
Tony opens an eye and his vision blurs before he could recognise the ceiling, the walls around him. It was bright outside, way too bright so he covers his eyes with an arm and takes a  deep breath. He was so, so happy to fill his lungs with the glorious rush of freshly brewed coffee and the smell of burnt bacon.
The bed dipped as Tony noticed that he was awake, and moved to plant a long, soft kiss on top of his tussled golden crown. Steve felt his chest being ripped apart. Tony was so delicate with him, gentle, protective, even when he was larger than this man was, stronger, heavier. He remembers damaging that same man, leaving him bloodied in an abandoned bunker in a blizzard.
Maybe because tonight something finally felt right, when everything was going 200km in the wrong direction.
Then with more heart. "That I miss you? That seeing you again at the compound after so long made me want to crawl my way back to you at any given opportunity?"
Caught in a dilemma of whether to lash out at Steve or be civil about this whole meeting request, Tony silently wished that Clint was still there with him. The snarky assassin had always had a knack of getting through to Tony. But still stuck in his head, Tony did not realise he had been unresponsive for far too long that Steve started to sound desperate.
Tony narrows his eyes, disbelieving. "Us? You and that Leeds kid?"
And nobody was complaining.
"Happy."  Tony barks out a laugh at the idea and Pepper joins him, but she was visibly worry-stricken.
“God no.” Tony replied quickly. "It's irresponsible, even for me, to blow up the kitchen before we leave for Eastern Europe.
The ability to remember and recall an image or experience in precised detail, clarity, and accuracy had always worked in his advantage in this line of work. His photographic memory was one of the many reasons why Captain America was a walking lethal weapon - he never forgets
By now Tony has a pretty good idea about the kid’s sixth sense, or spider-senses he’d call it. Peter could smell danger, fear,
Alas, the text message eventually broke his three day clean streak.
Tony’s jaw drops wide, baffled, and frankly a little confused but Peter continues heartily.
"But then he blows a gasket when
"Morning," Steve says, voice thick from sleep, to nobody in particular. "Ughh," he groans as he swings his legs off the couch, carefully holding the blanket against his crotch as he makes his way to the toilet. A long train drapes across the living room, following him into the toilet.
After getting tricked into listening to Fury's pep talk, Tony had dragged himself upstairs to get cleaned up but instead he walked in on a muscular man with his blonde hair in his hands, sitting on the edge of the bed curled up like an injured puppy. Suddenly the 220lbs 6”2 supersoldier appeared small and fragile to Tony. That night, perhaps because it was a full moon, or perhaps because Steve was actually
They, are his life now.
"That's not the only thing you said, and believe me that's not the part that's stuck. I realise that I have been selfish. For the most part, I agree with you."
Peter makes a face, contemplating the most appropriate response. "Is that ketchup?" Peter points to Tony's cheek, his finger nearly touching the man. Tony jerks his head back and Peter gets the message loud and clear. "Sorry. You just have -" Peter swirls his hand over his own cheek, points back at Tony to guide him.
“But hey, I wiggled you an all-you-can-eat cotton candy run. Whaddya say baby?” Tony says, extending his arms to pluck Peter off of Bucky. Peter’s smile reappears as he slides off his godfather’s shoulders. Tony sits him against his hip as he passes the bag full of stuffed animals, a water bottle and extra clothes to Bucky.
Steve couldn't remember the last time he saw the master assassin smile this widely, relaxed. At ease.
A feeling he was all too familiar with.
Heat was steadily rising to his face.
"...please?"
They rest their foreheads on each other, eyes closed, breathing into shared air and Tony feels his heart beat faster, but for a good reason this time. Steve was here now, and his presence next to Tony had chased away the painful memories that made its way into Tony’s mind that morning. He instantly feels heaps better, and draws out a long breathe before opening his eyes.
Steve was mixed in embarrassment and awkwardness as his pants grew tight at the graphic memory of Tony pleasuring him.
There may have even been a lot of begging last night.

"15," Steve hummed, tucking himself back into Tony's arms.

Hardly a show of affection on his part.

Boxed cereal made with love. Nobody could fault him for trying, especially on his birthday.
"Clint's back," he murmurs, looking into her hands, her long fingers.
and has perfect recall abilities.
Peter laughs lightly because he's seen and read them all.
Each time he visited, unless he flew the Iron Man suit, Tony brought with him trucks worth of fresh supplies - food, home, kitchenware you name it - that would last weeks without the need for replenishing. When Laura insisted there was no room to store it all, her polite way of saying he was doing more than enough, Tony offered to have the needs brought over sporadically.
Tony finally musters enough courage through the shame, to turn around.
“Tony this can’t be comfortable,” Steve reasons, trying to stay responsible.
He was so so tired of trying to figure everything out, and failing.
Whichever way, there was no room for mediocrity - everything Tony Stark did, in success or in failure, was explosive.
Tony and Steve rarely made appearances in New York since they retired from their superhero career and moved away. They visited the city only when absolutely necessary, and this weekend was one of the occasions that called for the Stark-Rogers family's full attendance in Manhattan. Tony had his reasons why he would always opts, if not insists to put up his small family of three at 177A Bleeker Street, despite the obvious security lineup the Avengers facility could provide. Tony was aware that his preference for the spellcaster's company as opposed to spending the limited time they had in the city with their former team factored heavily into Steve's disliking towards Strange, fueling his pre-existing jealousy of Tony's penchant for the former neurosurgeon. Now the Sorceror Supreme was suffering the brunt of it, and it was getting irritating.
The dog tags were the closest symbol of commitment he'd ever gotten from Steve and it remained closely tucked under the billionaire's clothes even after Steve and he went separate ways.
During bad days, Steve would convince himself that Tony was just not that into him, sometimes believing his fallacies. Tony's constant show of favouritism towards him however, says otherwise and this often leaves the bumbling soldier behooved.
Even with super memory, Steve only vaguely remembers a glimpse of Sam stepping out and scrambling back into the elevator, looking horrified.
The otherwise calm and collected Captain America once choked on his toast at breakfast when Wanda cautiously whispered to the table that
The mood turns sombre.
Tony rolls off of Steve and lays flat on his back. They look to the stars, completely fucked out and blink in silence for a while to let things sink in. They burst into a fit of giggles at the same time, realising how oblivious they've been to each other this whole time. The pair eventually look to each other contently, still sprawled on the throw blanket half naked under the open sky.
He ended up starting the Letter with just

do to Tony.
“Okay pal, calm down,” Bucky says, turning to Tony. “You wanna take this one?” He asks as he nudges towards the bumper cars, feeling bad for stealing Tony’s thunder on his day out with his own kid.
"I'm a mess Peter. You really shouldn't be hanging out here too much; I'm really not the best example of a functioning adult right now. Or ever. Hah - joke's on me.  It actually scares me that you once said you wanna be like me while I have no fucking clue what I'm doing these days. I'm not even supposed to swear in front of a kid but I just did. See where I'm getting at?"
"Four year old son of a genius and master tactician - 1, master tactician himself - 0," Tony jokes, showing no remorse over his bad habits.
Tony snaps his eyes shut, rubbing his forehead with his thumb and middle finger, hoping the friction would soothe his nerves from giving his precious brain an aneurysm.
Steve's mouth drops.

This kiss was different. It was unhurried, exploratory, sweet yet hungry.
A broken clock is still a comfort.
Steve lowers Peter to the ground and the little man hops happily on the gravel towards his Daddy, who was kneeling down with arms extended.
Tony Stark, and it was driving Sam up the wall.
Pepper turns her head to face Tony, her red bangs falling across her forehead. Tony instinctively reaches out and pushes the soft strands away with his fingers.
"A mutual. Nothing to worry about - he ran off to space for three years after she poured her heart out to him. It could partly be the reason why she's holding her cards close to her chest on you, Barnes."

The delivery man, clearly not recognizing Captain America right in front of him, says, “Beg your pardon?”
“Not a very good idea to be dicing watermelons while - unghh" Tony moans as Steve pulls his boxers off, his half-hard cock catching on to the elastic band and springing awake. "Steve, we're in a kitchen honey," Tony says, pointing out the obvious.
"I uh"-
He needed to be sure, and until he was 100% certain, until he can figure out the best way to break the news to Tony, Steve was resolute to keep Bucky and Tony as far away from each other as possible. Even if that means sacrificing himself in the act.

"I'm alright," Tony repeats.
why we're all here."
Pantry supplies had mostly run out two days ago, but because it was Christmas and stores were extremely busy on boxing day, grocery shopping was put on hold for a bit. It was half an hour before closing time and Steve had been ready to go for a while now. If only a certain someone could get his act together and get a move on.
"I didn't want to lose him. In the end I lost him all the same. I broke him." Steve whispers, his eyes warming up.
"So you technically
. This is way past creepy," Sam says, eyes focused on the TV.
“Noon,” Steve continues, as his eyes hungrily mapping Tony’s body while his hands ghosts over the covers that was hiding Tony's tenting erection. He slowly rubs the tip of the bulge, wresting a groan from Tony. “De-brief is at 10 though..”
"You know what, I actually do have somewhere to be," Bucky says, finger-gunning the door. "Those potatoes aren't going to buy themselves. But don't wait up, Stevie."
“We so were. I, dare
Steve that Tony will enjoy it and that Steve was not going to hurt him.
"Papa, Uncle Wong showed me your statue earlier near the water fountains. Can we walk past it later?" Peter chirps as he feeds his Pop a blueberry before popping a diced watermelon for himself.
He was finding his courage and wit again, seeing that Steve was showing little to no signs of regret from last night. Whilst Steve's morning wood could well be a human biological reaction rather than evidence of emotional reciprocation, the blush that was beginning to form on his cheeks confirms otherwise.
His bedroom slippers were at the foot of the bed; she must have worn them at some point, meaning she has been waiting for a while now. Pepper drops one leg over the edge of the bed but stays put, her red, watery eyes studying him sadly.
Steve stops.
"How old are you, Princess, if you don't mind?"
So Steve Rogers in fact, had a lot of game. He flirted with Tony all of last night, from the moment he walked into Tony's penthouse fresh out of the shower in his snug button shirt and jeans of sex, to the very last moment before he kissed Tony for the first time.
“Your husband hates me.”
This makes Tony's pants really, really tight.
me, Stark."
"Stay," Tony whispers, before easing Steve onto his back and climbing over the larger man, connecting their mouths for a gentle kiss. Their legs were caught in between the sheets, but it did not stop Tony from slowly grinding against Steve. He was going to savour this moment, stretching it as far and wide as he could. Because in their line of business, the superhero business, you will never know when the sacrifice play was going to be needed.
Just as harsh.
They’re going to need to milk the cow today.
Steve licked his wounds by burying himself with work. If the Captain was not scheduled on back to back missions, Steve spent his time tracking the globe with Sam for Bucky Barnes. If he was really free, he'd visit Peggy in London to reflect how far he's come since Erskine's serum.
when you could have been with your family? Of course none of that mattered. Captain Perfect blows his trumpet and everybody rallies behind him and his robot sidekick like good fucking blind rats."
nd wanted to steal you away from him. Didn't even know you two were ever romantically involved. And besides, I vividly remember calling you a douchebag in the middle of it all and you know what they say about first impressions.”
"WHAT" sternly.
He sighs fondly while breaking into a smile as he looks down at his belt buckle, halfway being flicked open by a pair of hands that were moments ago settled casually on his waist. Now two strong forearms had appeared from behind, tugging his belt out of the loops of his pants and swiftly moving on to the buttons and zipper.
Tony rolls his eyes. It clicked.
“Let’s go find out,” Tony replies fondly.
Tony remembers easing into a broad chest in silent acquiescence and feeling Steve's cock, hard and heavy, pressed between their bodies. His own erection was throbbing and if their last tryst was any indication, Tony remembers that Steve was not shy to ask for what he wants.
They were not expecting a huge crowd, by Tony's standards, but invitations were nonetheless sent out to some army veterans, and their closest friends were expected to attend. On his part, Steve had invited the Falcon.
"What about you?"
“Help me out here Sam," Steve pleads. "He’s finally coming home tonight and I don’t know what to do."
Before this, Tony had always felt threatened by his presence. From the day Steve told him that Bucky was alive, and that he
, because Steve, beneath his tough and hard exterior, appeared to be naturally pliant and submissive in bed.
"I asked you to go sailing but YOU SAID YOU HAD THE STOMACH FLU!" she says in disbelief.
Tony's megawatt smile appears. He kisses the tip of Steve's nose. "You're a tough nut to crack, Rogers. I've been pulling all the stops, dropping hints like a high schooler trying to get you to ask me out. I didn't even get to kiss you at midnight!"
Tony reasonably felt warm in his chest. He was happy momentarily, sipping the hot chocolate that Lila had prepared for him ("Don't tell Daddy that I gave you extra marshmellows,Uncle Tony!") when the last conversation he had with Steve before Leipzig crowded his mind without an invitation.
Tony wasn't heavy but his weight was completely pressed against Steve's lower half, one leg was actually resting on top of Steve's shin. When the billionaire seemingly lays there motionless for a good 30 seconds, Steve pokes Tony's cheek to check if he's passed out, but Tony swats his hand away affectionately. Steve bites his lips to stop himself from smiling too much, aware that if his eyes have well adjusted to the darkness, so would Tony's.
“Nothing," the soldier murmurs lazily in response. "Carry on," he adds in between kisses as he strokes Tony’s soft cock from underneath the genius’ silk boxers while he continues to suck hickeys along the line of Tony’s jaw - like it was the most natural thing to do in a kitchen setting. Steve then hooks his fingers over Tony's pants and drags them down in a sensual motion, wresting a happy sigh from the shorter man who seconds ago was minding his own business and innocently slicing fruits.
,” Tony interrupts, all too familiar, not needing to hear the rest of it.
When the doorbell rang, Steve was just three steps away from the door.
Shuri giggles. "As long as he isn't damaged, I'm sure I'll like him just fine. Does he have SnapChat?"
"Because,
. Clothes are highly optional but not necessary right now. Plus, we only need to leave until …"
Tony jerks awake, causing the suit to swerve turbulently. He narrowly misses the Empire State before FRIDAY reboots the autopilot and restabilises the titanium-gold alloy suit. The red and gold beauty instantly steadies, hovering majestically above the clear New York City evening skyline.
A young man who went too soon.
Pepper sighs and lifts the weary man's chin up to meet his eye.
“Okay you got me,” Tony resigned without a fight. “They’re not leftovers."
“Daddy’s got presents!” Peter cheers and wiggles in Tony’s arms, drawing Tony back to, well, the present. Breathe Stark, he tells himself silently. This is your life now. Not wanting to step further into the cold, Tony was relieved to hear footsteps approaching him from the living room.
Steve could absolutely do it.
Because the Tony Stark she got to know on a personal level had anything but a rotten heart.
"Morgan."
“You didn’t wanna tell me your secrets -
Tony closes his eyes.
"Can I get you something to drink?" Steve offers as he folds Tony's coat over his forearm, tapping his hands against it to calm his building nerves and curiosity.
All he remembers before everything went dark, hardly a breathe left in his lungs, was hearing his name being called out by various voices, but one stood out from the rest. He remembers his head being cradled, held closely by strong arms. The heat radiating from the skin that touched his was unmistakable, the scent as fresh as the ocean.
trying to be nice to him.
"Of course. It's 97.9% functional -"
“Please?” He pleads in the faintest voice.
Steve couldn't watch, but he had to.
Steve was hunched on a seat in full tactical gear, sitting under the full moon, intending to observe the streets. He and Sam were waiting to rendezvous with Natasha in a small safe house in a town just off the main road heading to Beirut.
"I was at the balcony waiting
, goes way back before Germany. See Cap and I -" Tony starts slowly, waving his hands in a tumble, suddenly a lump in his throat.
"AHH FUCK
"What?" Tony asks curiously.
“Parker, I'm gonna stop you right there,” Tony interrupts before crossing his arms and narrowing his eyes at the doe-eyed teen. “I wasn’t coming out to you."
Also, he needs to pee.
Tony quickly sniffles, refusing to allow himself to dwell  too much in melancholy because the Winter Soldier, Steve's best
Even as the planet slowly healed, the world was blown away when the two most iconic Avengers revealed that they had been in and out of a relationship for almost 10 years before they married.  When the world found out there was also an heir to the Stark-Rogers family, things went a notch crazier. As private as they tried to keep their lives, the first year was hell; they were hounded by the press around the clock to the point Steve nearly broke the face of a paparazzi when he got too close to Peter during one of their visits to the zoo. Over the years the attention mellowed down with less sightings of Steve and Peter while Tony remained in the news as he still owns Stark Industries and had to fly in every now and then for board meetings.
The master tactician carefully weighs the consequences if he leaps and throws himself off the Tower right about now.
“First of all,” Steve starts, his pitch higher than usual. “There was no pre-nup and we married two weeks later than intended because your lawyers wouldn’t stop calling you to change your mind about it. Second of all, I am not a jealous man. I happen to acknowledge that you’re a catch. I’m allowed to be a little territorial over my fella,” Steve argues, tightening this arms around Tony, trying to earn his way back into his husband's good graces.
Steve easily flings himself over the couch and lands next to Sam, clutching a brown leather box in his hand, worry dripping down his unbearably handsome face. He stares at Sam in silence, blinking his puppy dog eyes, blue and round as marble, short of begging for attention from his good friend.
"Would you like to switch back to manual navigation?"
instead.
The genius smiles sadly.
“Just noticed you getting hot and bothered over some of my pictures from MIT the other day. Thought I’d treat you with a Tony Stark bespectacled look from the 80s,” Tony says, wiggling his eyebrows seductively. "You like?"
He had passed out. He wasn't piloting the suit.
His many months away, most times without any word - was he coming home soon? was he hurt?
"Stark."
Steve got there first, only beating Tony by a matter of seconds. Steve's vision completely whites out when he comes, spilling into his stomach and Tony's seed soon overcoats his. There was a pool of semen across his abs, dripping down his waist and Steve was conscious of the fact that it was mostly his spend. He comes like a geyser on a lazy day and this time, he came harder than he has ever done.
Tony knew what was coming.
She only wanted her husband back, and since that was beyond Tony at the time, she told him money would do her no good. But she could use some company. So that day, Tony sat quietly with the mother of three, as she sobbed silently. In the very same kitchen he once sat as one of Earth's mightiest heroes.
“Absolutely. Love is love, right?"
"If we're late can't you just sling ring us there?" Tony asks, wrapping a scarf over himself without looking.
Steve's mouth clicks shut.
The neighbourhood though, was less than desirable. Tony was sure the group of men downstairs were planning on mugging him on his way out of the complex later. Good luck with that.
Tony had decided to throw a small victory party afterwards.
Tony looks at the kid and smiles weakly. "Talking about him to someone does help." The dog tags hung low against his chest now, and Tony caresses the surface of the plates where
Quietly, Steve turned over and watched Tony get up and move out of sight, heading towards the stream.
"Gotta admit it’s looking a little suspect," he said, listening to Tony's heaving breaths. "Do you need anything?" he asked tentatively, shifting a little to get closer.
“Yes,” Tony said. “Everything’s cared for.”
“Can this wait till tomorrow?” he asked, slowing his steps. “I’ve been working the whole day.”
Or maybe not.
control over what comes out of your mouth?” Natasha demanded angrily.
Steve heaved a low breath, taking that last step of the stairwell, and stopped when he saw Natasha leaning next to his door.
. There’s no need to explain yourself or to let me down easy. I got the message.”
“Well,” Steve said, shaking himself back to the present, trying to make his voice sound as neutral as possible. He would find out what was going on eventually. No secret remained hidden forever. “Let’s find out what the ghost wants.”
“He won’t bite,” Natasha said, her voice gentle. “Don’t be a coward.”
Tony nodded, grateful. “I don’t wanna fight,” he said after a long moment of companionable silence, gauging his words carefully so he wouldn’t set Steve off again. “I just… can’t really apologize for wanting to keep you safe. Someone had to check the place, and FRIDAY did the math and my chances to get out in time were simply better than yours. I just… went with it. You mean so much to me, it was a no-brainer.”
Or not footsteps, really, more like… shuffling.
Tony rubbed his forehead, looking up at Steve’s bruised face. “Need you to wake up, old man.”
. He was
A gasp tore out of his throat when he realized he hadn’t been the only one following Steve. He had been too preoccupied to even consider the possibility that the marines would take it upon themselves to stop them from escaping.
God, he wanted so badly for this fight to be over. The prospect of going back to their usual daily routine now almost seemed foreign. He wanted to wake up without that shadow of Ultron haunting his every step, for the impending apocalypse that preceded his every move. It needed to be over.
Steve took a step forward and faced the open doorway. Inside, on a long sofa, sat Mister Hammer, and he looked ready to strangle anything that moved.
“To be determined,” Tony quipped, then looked back up at Steve. “Our son’s the worst cockblock of all times,” he informed him.
There was a sigh. “Still thinking about the prof?” Rhodey asked.
Tony scoffed. “There’s no problem. You’ve heard Steve’s future-self: We’re all going to be one happy family.”
Steve hummed. “Sounds reasonable,” he said, then smirked. “You sure you’re alright?”
A kid like Peter Parker clearly didn’t belong here, and when Tony had sat down in his tiny room, he’d been a second from dropping his idea to recruit Spider-Man for the fight. But then the guy had talked about responsibility and doing what’s right, and dammit, Tony recognized true potential when he saw it.
And not just drawn. Tony was… he’d become so much more to him.
Tony shifted. “Good night, Steve.”
He heard Natasha chuckle and somehow, that sound—
“He doing well?” Tony asked, his voice pointedly neutral, as he walked around the kitchen counter. Next to him, right on the floor, stood about three huge boxes full of food, as well as a container with a whole turkey.
Clint held up a hand, as if he needed a moment of quiet
Steve watched him for a few moments longer, lingering in the knowledge that they had this now—the two of them, together.
have to do this?”
“I really am sorry I didn’t help you sooner,” Steve murmured and drew Tony back in. Their legs entwined, not an inch between them, and it was so good he finally felt like he could just relax a little.
—for his words to be true: There had to be some meaning to his life. This couldn’t be it.
was perfect. How Tony did deserve any of this, he would never know, but he sure as hell wouldn’t question it right now.
Steve was squeezing his hand ever so lightly, probably a way of telling Tony to be nicer, but he just couldn’t help himself… Something about Strange always made him pull up his self-defensive mechanisms.
“You’re a real homewrecker,” Bucky added, though his lips twitching with a smile.
Tony completely froze, and Steve watched, admittedly a bit delighted, as he put two and two together. “MassArts,” he echoed, dazed. “As in… Massachusetts College of Art and Design?”
Steve had that effect on people.
, his mind supplied. He was panting, rage coursing through him. They dared touch him, restrain him—
, though,” he echoed, chuckling lightly. Of course Steve would think of something as simple as a movie and a bit of fresh air. Strangely enough, it sounded perfect.
There was a pinch between Tony’s brows. It took him a long moment to answer, and when he did, it was barely a whisper.
Steve nodded. “Thank you.”
“Back? I didn’t—” Tony replied, frowning for a moment. He was about to ask her what she was talking about, before he stopped himself. It was Natasha. What had he expected? Of course she knew he would want to be part of the team again. She’d probably known long before him.
“I’m young. And I’m so far from you, Tony.”
If there was any part of Steve's brain still trying to function responsibly, Tony's words kicked it out of commission for the rest of the evening.
“I can’t believe you managed to do this behind my back…”
“Uh, Tony,” Steve prompted. “What is this?”
so badly of alcohol that Steve could smell him about the same time he saw him. He was just circling back towards the gym after his morning jog when he spotted the royal mess Tony was. His fashionable clothes were rumpled and out of order, buttons unmade, shirt untucked, his jacket hanging askew on his shoulders and, God, stains on his shirt Steve really didn’t want to look any closer at.
His arms weren’t pinned. He could have Tony back on his feet in a blink. He could give him a stern lecture within an inch of his arrogant ass.
Steve shook his head with confusion. “What do you mean?”
He stepped away from the shelves and approached Tony. "And how long do you think we have till they find us?"
It was happening again, except in reverse. One moment Steve was encased in softness, then, he stood in Tony’s workshop. This time, however, it took only a second for him to orient himself and realize that he was back in his own time.
“I don’t care what he is,” Tony all but snarled. He tried sidestepping him again, but Steve only moved with him, then bracketed him with both arms.
“What does she want?” he conceded on a sigh.
ShutdownInterrupt
It had been strange how a place could become home so quickly. And he hoped Bucky would someday feel the same way.
The stupid flirting and teasing might’ve turned into an even stupider crush. And the fact that Steve hadn’t shown up in the lab ever since didn’t exactly help ease Tony’s mind.
It wasn’t the energy projects.
* * *
“Trust me, I got this.” Tony’s face went slack, and before Steve could anything else, a fierce blue shone within his eyes.
“Why?”
It had been a daring thing they’d done. And while it was by no means normal, Ian was a healthy little guy, and he would be loved beyond measure.
When Tony had returned home a few hours ago, all Steve had wanted to do was talk to him.
“Seriously, are you planning to skip our reservation or do you just enjoy driving so slow?”
Ms. Potts didn't seem too worried about it when she glanced at the large man and approached him the next moment.
It was agonizing, the moment after. Without the pressing need to climax, he suddenly came back to reality. And reality was that he was sitting unbuttoned and opened, on top of Tony—Tony, who was now wiping the spendings from his hand with the tail of his shirt sleeves.
“But… why?” he heard himself asking. His voice was loud and brash, something he’d always tried to swallow down whenever talking with his boss, but today, he just couldn’t.
The room that followed was dark. The only things visible were five dimly lit tanks, and on the far ceiling there was some kind of vertical tunnel leading out of the complex.
“Good.” Snatching the can in mid-air, Steve grabbed Tony’s hand and basically dragged him up the stairs. They didn’t waste much time, and soon enough, Steve had Tony beneath him, naked and ready and very willing. There were still some chocolate smudges on both of their bodies, but foreplay was only bearable for so long.
“It’s not…” Steve said. “It’s not something we do, no.”
Rhodes cast Steve and apologetic look and helped him with hauling all of their backpacks and other belongings onto the second floor of the RV while the others had already settled into their seats. The RV itself was exactly the grandiose vehicle that Steve had envisioned from going on a road trip sponsored by Howard Stark. It was pompous, all red-and-gold interior, and only contained state of the art tech, LED TVs, leather seats and porcelain floor tiles. There were porches to don both entrances; a whole dining room next to the kitchen, a den connected to the first bedroom, which was similarly connected to the hallway. And there was a full-out bathroom and another bedroom tucked in the back.
Tony rolled his eyes and bumped Steve in the side with his elbow. “It’s a day to weep and mourn my youth and cry in the face of all those wrinkles and grey hairs I’m getting.”
“Like we did back then,” Steve added. “I mean… if you’re up for it. With your wounds, I’m not sure—We could take it easy.”
“Regret?” Tony echoed, staring at Steve. “What, that I found you? God, Steve, no… trust me, I would’ve searched for a whole while longer. When you… after you vanished, I never dreamed of the room again, but I knew you were out there. So I went through my dad’s files, and I just… knew that he’d been close to finding you. Mom had forced him to tone down the expeditions. There had been one, maybe two flights per year, so I stocked up the funds, and…” He smiled. “Here you are.”
“Yeah. And
“This is where it ends, Captain,” Tony told Steve with equanimity. “The plan will be completed, and humanity will be no more.”
Steve and Thor exchanged looks, then nodded. “Was a bit of a lark,” Thor admitted, his voice taking on that rare sarcastic undertone of his.
Back then, he’d wished a lot of things. Mostly that Steve would come back. That they could somehow fix everything that had happened. That he could apologize for a lot of things, and yell at Steve for the rest of it. But never in his wildest dreams would he have imagined this.
Breathing heavily, Steve watched Tony finger-fucking himself, spreading his legs so he could see better, and it was almost too much. He stepped closer again as soon as Tony withdrew his hand, settling his slick cock against Tony's ass.
Steve raised a hand in greeting. He hadn’t seen much of Rhodes during the battle, and he was glad Jim didn’t seem to be too banged up.
It didn’t make him feel better about it, but he had to accept it, eventually.
Steve thought for a moment. “Uh… September 28
Wrapping a hand around Tony’s arm, he started walking him to the door, but stopped in his tracks when Tony said, “I know you watched me in the river.”
"Basically, coming here was my last option before stepping into heavy traffic," Bucky concluded. His voice made it seem as if he was joking, but it was the simplistic nature of that statement, the lack of grave drama that let Steve know Bucky was serious about this.
Tony clutched to him, desperately needing to hold on while all coherent thought failed him. He needed something to keep him grounded as Steve continued to push him towards the edge.
you?”
The next minutes were a series of chuckles, moans, hisses and bite marks. Before Steve knew what was happening, Tony sat on his thighs, their chests pressed against each other’s. Tony had gently directed Steve’s hand behind himself, and was now simultaneously dipping both of their forefingers into himself. Their hands were entwined, and all Steve could do, as he stretched Tony open, was to stare at him in utter awe.
“What are you doing?” Steve asked worriedly, but Tony only waved him off.
“You’ve been at court about twenty times during Bucky’s trial,” Tony reminded him gently. “And you’ve made it pretty clear how you feel about any form of preventative measures.”
He didn’t breathe freely until he was alone.
“I don’t like the way Ross is handling things,” Tony explained cautiously. “I really don’t. I have this… strong urge to punch him in the face most of the time, but—I can’t say he’s wrong. At least not on all levels.”
“If I didn’t know better, I’d say you were spooked.”
* * *
Steve shrugged. “We’ve both tried talking to them several times, and they haven’t budged. This is what they want to do, what helps them. Who are we to say otherwise? Maybe we can work on our tactics as soon as they’re done getting all that rage out.” He clapped his hands, then put an arm around Natasha and steered her into the direction of the facilities’ elevator.
“I…” Steve started, his voice tense. “Give me a moment.”
“How did you even get him here?” Maria asked. She was looking sort of angry without showing it. “What were you thinking? Inviting a killer into a place that doesn’t have the necessary safety measures.”
Tony knew he had to make quite the picture, with the way he stood right in front of Steve. Chest bare, empty bottle in hand, wings stretching all over the room, feathers still bloody and broken. All around him, the penthouse lay in complete shambles. Broken glasses, chairs flung around, paintings thrown off the walls.
Steve was dragging Tony away, steering him through the crowd.
“I’ll get you out of here,” Steve said with a raspy voice.
Steve swallowed and didn’t know what to say. He’d almost forgotten about the day at the river, that moment of revelation when he’d seen Tony touch himself.
Steve blinked and turned around. There were two people walking towards him: a woman with shoulder-long red hair and a roguish blond man. The woman cast him a crooked smile as she came to a halt in front of him. “Mister Rogers, I’m Agent Romanoff and this is Agent Barton,” she said. “We’re working for the Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division. Miss Hogan told us to inform you about the situation should you come here. I’m sorry, but we can’t allow you to proceed further than this.”
“Oh he was delighted.” Tony tried for a grin, and didn’t quite succeed.
Bucky ducked and raised his bionic arm in defense, grasping the man’s throat to keep him—and his claws—at a distance. They traded a few punches, before Bucky managed to throw the man off. Right in the direction of the approaching police cars.
Steve groaned, but turned around anyway and leaned over the back of the seat. He flicked open Tony’s phone after Tony had told him the code (it was Jarvis’ birthday, and Steve would’ve remembered it anyway), and scrolled through the playlist.
“Mister Jarvis will show you the rest of the house later,” Stane told him as they rounded a last corner before they came to a stop in front of a large, sun-filled room. When they stepped inside, Steve’s eyes briefly lingered on an old wooden desk first, then he tried and failed to take in the sheer luxury of the interior. “These will be your rooms,” Stane explained. “Tony selected them specifically. This one is called the Morning Room. We brought one of our finest desks here. It’s where Mrs. Stark used to answer her mail and file out daily orders for the staff. I hope it will suit you with… whatever it is you’re doing.”
“That was…” Tony started, licking his dry lips. “…goddamn amazing.”
It didn’t exactly hurt. Tony had stretched him for long minutes, but the feeling was still a lot to handle.
need you. Especially now. Please, Buck.”
The armor looked horrible, the paint almost gone, leaving it with the vibranium’s silver color. There were dents and ashes and while there was no blood on Tony’s face, he looked shaken.
“Tony,” Steve moaned, before his mouth travelled to Tony’s again, swallowing him in a kiss once more. And, Tony thought idly, whatever personal hell he would put himself through in the days to come… this was worth it.
Tony cast her a small smile, before the phone buzzed again in his mind, causing him to visibly flinch. “What?” he snapped, answering it on the first ring.
Steve’s face began to crumble at that. “Tony—”
fine without it, remember?”
That had Steve smile—a real smile now. He wasn’t sure yet if he
“You all knew, didn’t you.”
The next second, though, Sam finally got on with the program. “So, uhm, I know I’m not a super-soldier or anything, but… if you guys need another set of arms for your little crisis, I’d like to help.”
“Thanks, Maria. ‘Preciate it.” Tony pushed away from the table. “C’mon, darling, let’s go to bed.”
“Speaking of,” Steve went on, looking at Natasha, “could you grab some nonalcoholic drinks for Tony?”
“Tony told me something about a never-ending parade of visitors?”
“You… Do you remember how I told you I’m the sort of guy everyone can fuck?” Tony asked, and there was something akin to fear in his eyes.
Barnes ran his now-bandaged hand across his face and offered a pained smile. “I remember everything.” The implication buried in his voice sent small shivers across Tony’s skin.
"Get a grip, Rogers," he huffed to himself as he stepped onto his floor and headed directly to the bedroom.
“That’s a nice thought,” Mister Stark said quietly. He fiddled with a few blades of grass, twirling them, but never ripping them off the ground. “Tell me something?” he asked.
Steve hummed in agreement.
“You’re a wanted man. I’m not sure what kind of solution you want to find.”
Barnes drew out a breath and glanced at him wickedly. “Scared, Stark?”
"Mr. Stark is in his workshop, as always. Do you require anything from him?"
Which would’ve been fine, had he been home alone. The problem was, now that he and Tony had finally settled their fight, Tony was always looking at him. Always staring. And Steve couldn’t think at all.
“Ste-eve,” Tony groaned loudly, overstimulated, overwhelmed, over-
It took Steve a moment to decipher those words. “Your dreams of me?” he asked. “Of ‘before’?”
Barnes snorted. “God, how did I not notice that?” he asked quietly. His head rested next to Natasha’s, who was asleep on his chest. “You two couldn’t be more cliché if you tried.”
Tony smiled, as well.
The gears in Tony’s head started turning. So they had to follow through with their plan, it was the only option. Get Steve out of here, and stop Zemo from freeing those soldiers.
“Trust me, you’re coping better than I thought you would.”
Natasha’s amused expression slowly turned into a deep frown. “Around eight. What’s wrong? Is Tony still in the lab?”
And with that, Ultron dished out one punch after the other, ramming his fist down on Steve’s shield repeatedly. Goddammit, Ultron was strong, and this hurt like hell. Soon, Steve couldn’t raise his shield in time anymore, and agony exploded through his body when he was hit square in the left side of his abdomen. He felt something bruise deep within him and could barely stay conscious as he collapsed to the ground.
Despite being draped over him, it felt like Tony was miles away, and Steve felt a sour tightness in his belly. He took a short breath and closed his eyes. "I see," he said, ignoring the sharpness of his own tone.
“You heard Ross,” Natasha added. “If you don’t sign, that means you’re not part of the team anymore.”
Tony kept…
“I have to give Ross
it open. And in the darkness, Steve spotted Iron Man’s angry eyes. For the first time since meeting Tony, he raised his shield in defense.
Tony nodded shortly. “Gotta talk with Bruce. And then, I’m gonna head back upstairs, make us something to eat,” he said, patting Steve twice more in support before standing up. “You could come with me.”
, Steve thought, and forced himself to smile at Tony. “It’s impressive,” he said.
“W’never got to finish what we started earlier,” Tony slurred after a moment, as if reading Steve’s mind once again.
* * *
you.”
His expression must have grown skeptical, for Steve immediately glanced down, hands clasping in front of him. “Your voice sounds hoarse. And you reek of alcohol.”
“Look, is there a single scenario running through that handsome head of yours which features me turning you down right now?” He leaned in again, tenderly brushing his lips against Steve’s. “I’m not deluding myself that this will always be easy, I’d just... rather enjoy the moment, right now, and not worry about things that haven’t already happened. Can we… can we do that?”
At that, the stern façade that had guarded Steve’s exterior faded, and he offered Sam a kind smile. “Tony’s right about that,” he complied, then made a dramatic pause that was obviously more a matter of principle than anything else. “All right,” he conceded, pointing down on the Falcon blueprints on Tony’s phone. “You know where we can get our hands on one of these?”
Steve stood up, taking back a step. Then, he was speaking. “Would you like a glass of water?”
Tony groaned, standing up. “Right,” he called after him. “Thanks for always talking to me!”
God, he really needed to stop thinking about this, else he’d start to get horny all the time; and the RV offered little privacy. Thus, instead of dwelling on the texture of Steve’s lips, Tony finished up and washed his hands. Outside of the restroom, Tony immediately spotted Steve and Bucky walking towards the snacks aisle inside the shop. He whirled around, turning his back to them, and plucked a random tourism pamphlet off the back wall, holding it in front of his head.
Tony grimaced, but nodded either way.
Steve brushed a quick kiss against Tony’s temple. “‘s okay. We can catch up later.”
“What,” Bucky intoned with wide eyes and a faux-surprised voice. “
“Thaddeus Ross. He’ll want to talk with us…” He taped down on the tablet. “…about this.”
Steve shook his head, trying to clear it as he wiped a bit of dirt and greenery from his trousers. It was late afternoon and they sat in a clearing inside a small wood next to the hotel. They had discovered the place earlier in the week and now often came here to enjoy the warmth of the day—without anyone bothering them. The grass beneath them was soft and still slightly heated from the sun. Steve had his notebook and a few pencils with him, though the pages were still blank.
"Well, not exactly. I just… what's up with him?" Steve asked, relieved that he didn't have to broach the subject. Bruce really seemed to like Tony, even though he tended to scold him often.
. You saved Millions of lives.” He smiled earnestly. “I just want you to know that there’s still a lot of people who remember that.”
He didn’t feel much of anything anymore.
It took him a moment to realize Steve meant his future self. Right. Of course Tony’s sudden attraction wouldn’t exactly be big news to Steve. This Steve already knew Tony was head over heels for him.
The man shook his head. “Oh, no. No. Far from it. You shall live forever.”
“And she just went out there, completely alone? Wasn’t she afraid?”
"I love you too," Steve answered without hesitation. He held Tony close so he could kiss him again, one hand curved on the back of his neck and the other trailing down his belly to the edge of Tony's pants. "How're you doing down here?" Tony had been so good, it nearly blew Steve's mind away, but he would never leave Tony hanging if he could help it. He loved him, and wanted him to enjoy this just as much as he did.
your Tony,” he said. “Just with a bunch of more memories. He didn’t go anywhere, I am him. One and the same. This is time travel, not body-swapping. I just came back here and… I wanted to fix this.”
Steve kneeled down at the foot of the couch and stared him down. “Natasha said you’ll be leaving for Latveria in about an hour. And she told me you said I wasn’t allowed to come with you.”
“I knew you weren’t there anymore, that you were just a shell, and I still I didn’t do anything. I would’ve let you destroy the whole world. What does that make me?”
“Ef, keep an eye on him,” Tony ordered to the room in general, as he entwined his hand with Steve’s once more.
Steve felt Tony going rigid next to him. “Great,” he murmured, then brushed a hand over his face.
"It did seem familiar, Captain," said Thor, scratching his beard absently. "I cannot say where from."
The smile broadened. “That’s the beauty of it: It’s a dream. Just do whatever you want… You could start with freeing yourself of that cotton horror, but that’s just my two cents.” Tony pointed at Steve’s pyjama pants. And damn if he wasn’t the most
Staying in Avengers Tower, every morning waking up in Tasha’s bed, her body curled around him. Tangled limbs and soft red hair, one hand lying splayed across the silken expanse of her naked back. Listening to the sound of her breathing, the throb of her heartbeat. Of course he didn’t deserve it.
“I’m hurt now.”
How could Tony regret hooking up with him when he was acting so sweet and affectionate? And how could he basically just tell Steve it'd been a mistake without even thinking of Steve's feelings? What kind of a person did he take Steve for?
“I see,” he said instead. “And what do you want me to do about that?”
The next morning started on an early note, and even hours later, when it was already close to noon, Steve’s thoughts kept drifting back to Tony’s rather
And then there he was. The confusion on Ian’s face all but evaporated, and he smiled brightly as Steve rubbed his nose against Ian’s.
The way Peggy had looked at him had made Steve feel insanely proud and from what Colonel Phillips had told him afterwards, Steve understood that they wanted him to find a team and hunt Schmidt down. They had talked well into the night, with the others drinking some self-brewed liquor Jim Morita had brought with him. And much later, he and Bucky had shared a few stories on how their lives had been in the last months.
“You beat me
Bruce stepped up next to them. “This is gonna change everything. Is Steve aware of that?”
“She’s linked to him,” Gamora said, sobbing as she fell down on her knees. “I didn’t know, I… I think he’s sewn parts of himself into her.”
He wanted to know what made Tony tick. How he liked his coffee and which movie, song and book were his favorite. He wanted to know what could excite Tony to the point of speechless awe, aside for the prospect of having sex with Steve. He needed to know what could anger this wonderful man, and how to appease him. What he'd stand up for and where he might relent.
“Duh.”
“What are you doing here?” Steve asked.
Steve just rolled his eyes, and as he watched the monitors flickering all around them, his stomach kept doing uneasy flips. A face became visible on the monitor in front of them. And when the clattering of Tony’s typing fell silent, a voice echoed through the vast space.
“I think it might be a good idea to let the two of you train separately for a week,” Steve suggested, keeping his tone mild. “Natasha will supervise, give you pointers. Then she’ll team you up with one of the others at a time.”
Ridiculous to think Tony could ever
Tony stopped and raised a brow. “Which one?”
Was there a passage towards the sea? The workshop was situated way below the cliff’s edge, so there probably was a pathway down to the beach.
Natasha’s eyes briefly flickered sideways, before they settled on Tony again, calm and sure. “James and I… we know very well what the other can take, and we’re used to see things for what they are.” She smiled at him. “This… situation. You might not realize it, but it’s temporary. It’s not how we’re gonna lead our life. I knew, when all of this began that James and I might have to go our separate ways for a while. And that is… okay.”
As Steve stood at the sink scraping dried food off the plates, before he put them in the dishwasher, Tony crept up behind him and slipped an arm around his waist. He nuzzled and kissed his neck, making Steve smile.
“They’re offline,” he announced. “SHIELD’s bugging
As Steve’s hands moved down to rest at the small of Tony’s back, Tony tightened his grip around his neck. When the song ended, he pulled back a little to look him in the eye, and the pretense of dancing stopped. Now they just held each other, and Steve stared down into the brown of Tony’s eyes.
, after all. Tony Stark—tech prodigy, business magnate, one of the richest men in the world and constantly ranked on Forbes’ list of
“I…” Steve frowned. “I think so?”
There were arms wrapping around his middle. Steve blinked, too stunned to even move.
How are you. Snap out of it. Your name is ‘Bucky’. James Barnes. Sergeant. The rapid-fire interrogation made his head ache, and it only served to confuse him more.
“Easy for you to say!” He stood up and rounded on Steve. “So we… talked. That’s all. Really?”
Steve’s gaze got piercing. “Who?”
. Just yesterday, James Fucking Barnes had been inspecting a roadmap of Kentucky and Tony hated it. Steve had even tried to approach him again after weeks of radio silence. He’d cast Tony all these flimsy smiles and raised eyebrows, as if this suddenly
“I must be,” Tony conceded on a chuckle, tugging Steve’s head down to kiss him again. “Otherwise our little appointment next month would be kinda pointless, don’t you think?”
“Goddammit!” Tony cursed. On his back once again, he just barely managed to roll out of the way and escape another hit. The suit had obviously taken a few bad hits already and Steve had a feeling it wouldn’t withstand that force any longer.
He could hear the doors of the cabin lock behind him, and the lights within the small room turned green, indicating that everything was ready to spray Tony with the disinfectant if need be.
Steve grinned in spite of himself. Couldn’t help it, really. “I… I turned down the scholarship, about two months ago. I’m going to MassArts.”
Steve gulped, balling his hands to fists. He had no reason to believe her—none at all. And yet, he had the feeling these people were his only hope.
There was something in Tony’s eyes that he’d never seen before. It looked as if for some reason, he wanted to hate this, but couldn’t.
,” he said and was almost vibrating in Steve’s arms, and he felt and tasted so
“Guys… this is awkward,” Bruce murmured, his hands still on Tony’s feet.
are far more clever than you’re letting on,” Tony said, looking at him fondly. “You’re the most intelligent, empathetic, stubborn man I’ve ever known. One day, you’re going to change the world for the better, I’m sure of it.”
Then Tony’s fist came at him with sizzling speed, out of nowhere. Steve blocked it without thinking.
And the fire he’d ignited in his body had yet to fade.
Tony remembered the Eye telling him.
“Yeah, you know, like on ‘America’s Most Haunted Places’?”
“Yeah,” Steve admitted. He placed the book on the table in front of them, then leaned back on the couch, looking at Tony. “Talking to people, not knowing what’s what or why anything’s the way it is… it was just… hard, for a long time.” He sighed heavily, chest constricting as though all the air from the earth wasn’t enough to fill his lungs. “It—and please don’t take this the wrong way—it was almost easier for me when you were all douchebag-like. Scrutinizing every look I gave you in a way that screamed, ‘What is that stuck-up idiot from the 20s thinking now?’”
The awkward touch in Tony's demeanour was endearing. It sounded nice, trying to spend some time together, outside of the battlefield. Maybe if he and Tony talked more, they could stop butting heads all the time.
“It is,” Tony agreed, grinning crookedly. “Reverse-me is a complete douche and clearly has no idea what’s beneath those uniform pants. Here-me, on the other side, is very appreciative of what he has.” Tony’s mouth dipped to nip at Steve’s jaw line while he moved forward, crowding his space and trailing a hand down towards his groin.
He was… he was glad to have Steve back, of course he was. Even if he didn’t
Tony released a soft sigh, then moved on.
, Tony thought—that explained things. Most things. Not the shirt, though. “You could’ve just asked Friday,” he suggested.
Steve looked chagrined at that. “It’s less weird than you probably think it is.”
The distress that filled his eyes didn’t make it any better. “Tony—”
Pulling out of her, he flopped down on the bed, brushing his hand over her abdomen.
Tony’s hand slipped from the table, and he felt his heart beating so fast he was sure the man in front of him could hear it.
It was the ‘please’ that made him pause. Steve said it like it was something intimate, a soft-spoken word that gained a whole new meaning when he was saying it to Tony.
That was true. Tony had often damned the circumstances, had often thought that if Zemo hadn’t interfered, played his little game with them, that they would have managed to find a compromise. But as was so often the case, the world hadn’t been quite as generous.
something, and if Steve…
“It doesn’t matter what he thinks he heard,” Pepper hissed, stepping towards Tony. “It doesn’t even matter if he’s right or wrong. What matters is
Without another word, Steve finished his own drink and ordered a third. If anything, Tony would
“Rogers, Steven Grant,” it echoed across the room. “Born 1918.” The camera next to the monitor scanned the surroundings, landing on Natasha next. “Romanov, Natalia Alianovna. Born 1984.”
“I get it, okay? Let’s just… do you need to look at the damned plans again?”
Another line appeared on the canvas, and then a rounded shape on one corner, before Steve paused to look at it again. This wasn't going anywhere, figuratively and practically. The lines did nothing to work with one another, it was just raw feeling, and Steve knew he was too scatter-minded to get anything meaningful out of it.
He turned around and, because he didn’t know how comfortable Steve was with making their whatever-it-was official yet, he awkwardly petted his shoulder. “You got this, right? I forgot I have this… thing… in the workshop. I’ll be up again for dinner later.”
it was our future. The scepter gave me a one-time chance, and I know this went horribly wrong, but the thought behind it is still the right thing to do. And there simply wasn’t any time for having one of your little group debates.”
On the way, they ate fish and chips at some roadside booth, straight from the paper. And while the others were giving them strange looks, Tony was doing his best not to look at Steve at all. If anything, the closed confines of the RV only worsened the brewing sickness in his stomach. But he’d survive. He would. It was a matter of preserving what little pride he’d managed to not toss in the gutter.
Steve shook his head and took Tony’s hands in his. “I—God, I didn’t even think about telling you, because didn’t realize you wouldn’t know.”
“Hear, hear,” Sam said, reaching for his glass as well. The others followed suit, and Tony almost looked bashful, as they all clinked glasses.
Steve nodded, wanting to believe that so badly. He dropped down on his back next to Tony, a breathless laugh escaping his lips. “I just… I still can’t believe this,” he said. “I’ve only been here for a few days, but… I don’t know how I can stand having you hate me again.”
“I just wish I could make up for what I did, with Wanda,” Vision said, even as he moved forward. “But this isn’t something that can be fixed.”
A celestial being, born at the very Beginning… Steve just couldn’t wrap his head around it.
Steve raised a brow, looking at Tony. “You’ve changed.”
The two had loved each other too much for that.
He knew Stark Industries was solely in the business of producing weapons. During the war, they’d made a lot of money, and Steve had always admired the company for protecting those soldiers as best as they could, and yet… He also knew about the destructiveness and the shadiness of the business.
“In a nutshell.”
“You might not be the man Steve knew,” she told him quietly. “But you’re also not the man HYDRA tried to make out of you. You’re you. And even if it takes some time to find out what that means… try to do it with people who care about you.”
“You’ve been through a lot,” Steve said after a long moment. “You had every right to focus on your responsibility to yourself. And you did good. You’ve done a lot of good.”
“I’m serious,” Tony continued, smiling flirtatiously. “I’m making an effort here. All for you. I even read the notes you gave me! Give me some credit, Potts.”
There was about a two-point-five-seconds pause, before Tony spoke up again. “Fuck, but I’ll love seeing you hold our child,” he blurted, then whimpered when Steve tenderly rubbed the head.
The moment Tony had fallen down on his knees, Steve had been ready to push him off.
“I got bad news,” Maria said as she came in, her expression apologetic as she looked at Tony.
"You sure did surprise me," Steve said, smiling ruefully and then nodding his head, relieved. Talking would work, they could work stuff out if they talked, and it was so great to know Tony didn't seem to be into it just for the sex. "And, uh, in that case, how about we go to my room?" he offered, tilting his head in that direction.
There was another long beat of silence, before Rhodey said, “So, how do you like life at Stark Mansion?”
“As much as I can be,” Thor responded. “There might be unexpected consequences… but I am certain it will be worth it.”
“Take as long as you need, Steve,” Bruce was saying sympathetically. “Breathe. I know it’s a shock. I’ve been there. And I’ll wait. You just breathe.”
The other part, well… the other part was much more disappointed than he had any right to be.
Well, two months and sixteen days if you wanted to be nitpicky and count the two days it had taken Tony to actually accept that
A short pause, before Zola’s voice intoned, slowly, “I was invited.”
Barnes breathed mechanically and just when Tony pressed a wet cotton ball to the side of his wrist, he let out an almost girlish yelp that neither of them seemed to have expected.
What was done was done. No going back. Extremis was gone, as was Ultron. And while Steve was so relieved they had all come out on the other side, there was a part of him that wished they’d found a different way to do this. No matter what else, Tony hadn’t deserved to be the one to sacrifice everything for victory once more.
Because no matter how much Steve wished they could just skip ahead and be the Steve and Tony from 2022—they weren’t. Here, in 2018, they were still a little broken, still far apart from each other.
“I can’t believe you faked a breakdown,” Tony said as he stared up at the bot. The claw—still holding Steve’s hand—slightly turned in Tony’s direction and, for the lack of a better word, cocked its head curiously.
“Yeah, if by ‘sleep’ you mean ‘being drugged on morphine’, then sure…”
“Yeah…” Steve breathed.
“You’re right,” Steve conceded. “I’ll give him space.”
Tony snorted, because those two words really only sounded right when Pepper said them. “I’m just doing this to make Steve happy. Which will make me happy. Don’t make me out to be the hero in this. I’m really not.”
Tony stared at him a moment longer as though waiting for himself to believe it.
Normally, Steve was a man who appreciated good humor, but there was nothing in that particular revelation which tickled his mirth. He wasn’t laughing and he wasn’t screaming. He was… well, he was at a complete and utter loss.
Tony smiled and Steve was almost sure his eyes were at least a bit watery. “We grew up together. Otherwise I’d be all over you, buddy.”
Steve snorted. “And here you were yelling at everyone about wasting time and gas just two a days ago.”
Tangible.
“Yeah.”
Steve swallowed. So that’s why Tony had tried to hate him so much in the beginning. They would have to talk about that, eventually, but now wasn’t the time.
“Yes.” Rhodey smiled. “He’s apparently very worried about you. And guilty. The guy looked like a kicked puppy down there. What happened?”
“Sorry,” Tony said, simply.
Steve moved closer and took his face in both hands. As his thumbs stroked Tony’s cheeks, he said, “Happy birthday. I missed you.”
“I know you will. Just… start slow. One finger after another, you know the basics right?”
There was a moment of quiet, before Rhodey raised his glass. “A toast, gentlemen,” he announced, giving Tony a pointed look. “To making life count.”
[New Client2] [chat_server:46956]
A thundering storm was waiting for them, Steve knew that. But he couldn’t focus on that now.
Steve paused, looking up again. There was something akin to understanding dawning on Tony’s face.
. Just tired. Promise.”
Steve hummed his thanks and took a small sip before setting the bottle down next to him. His pencil flew over the sketchpad in his lap, outlining a very distinctive set of eyes. He couldn’t focus, though. His insides were overwhelmed with conflicting feelings, thoughts of Tony and last night and what would possibly happen now.
Tony’s eyes dropped to Steve’s mouth. And then, their lips touched. Ever so briefly at first, and Tony could feel Steve’s shaky breath on his mouth. He was painfully aware of their audience, and his eyes raked over Steve’s as he leaned back a fraction.
Together, they ran towards the widening portal. A turmoil of blazing white light and heavy wind was blasting out of the rift. In the middle of it, Steve could just barely make out a form—a bearded man with a red cape waving a hand urgently and shouting something Steve couldn’t hear over the howl of the wind.
Tony led him to the floor below and Bucky couldn’t drag his eyes off of him. It was… hard to believe that he was here in the first place—that he’d decided to face the whole team after what had happened, but the fact that he wanted to do this for him… it felt like he was still somehow asleep.
That had to be true as well.
“Tony, come on…” Steve started, but Tony interrupted him.
He patted the bed for Tony to join him. It was true that Tony had been using this nickname for him since the beginning, but Steve was slowly starting to worry about it becoming a long-term habit.
However, this time the camera switched to bird perspective, clearly FRIDAY’s work, a recording most likely, and Tony smiled when he spotted Steve shoving everyone in the car before he hopped in a second later. There were a few seconds of video material afterwards, with satellites following Steve’s car along the various motorways. Then, the screen of the television turned black.
“Bucky!” Steve yelled, true panic seeping into him, trying once more to push through, but it was of no use. Bucky’s face became white, ashen, and it was then that Tony shot past them all.
Steve flushed. “I don’t think you’d spend your time on it if you didn’t think it was worth it.”
Steve didn’t have an answer for him, and after a moment, he stood up, walking a few steps towards the sink, and turning his back on them as he stared out of the little window.
He dropped a kiss on her forehead, hugging her back. “Not likely. We do have a reputation to uphold.”
After they’d finished, when Tony had fallen asleep, he’d soon started to mumble in his sleep. Steve had listened to him, unable to rest yet, and his heart had clenched uncomfortably when Tony had suddenly started whimpering his dead wife’s name.
His nostrils flared and he grinned up at her, sneaking his hand up beneath her shirt to trace her spine with his fingers. Natasha was slowly grinding her naked body against his, licking his neck. “Fuck, Nat… I missed you.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve leaned forward, smiling against Tony’s cheek. “I think I’m allowed, today. You can count yourself lucky that I’m not carrying you over the threshold.”
“False modesty doesn’t suit you,” Steve said, grinning.
Tony murmured something unintelligible, though Steve thought he’d heard something close to ‘Fuck off, Elsa’, then he basically hugged the coffee machine until it produced what had to be a triple espresso.
want Steve to know him in any way humanly possible. He wanted Steve to know his virtues and his errors, and find out every little thing about Steve in return. He wanted Steve to be his, not just now,

TS 3:06 A.M.>What you did to me that morning kept me going for the last 2 weeks. Did I wake you?
Steve heaved a strained breath. “Got it under control. I…”Steve couldn’t hold back the little groan of pain as Bucky’s knife sliced through the air, forcing him to move. Steve jumped, tucking up his legs just in time to avoid being struck again.
A gasp tore from Tony’s throat. “Fine with me,” he agreed, rubbing himself against Steve’s hand. “Get on with it.”
“I don’t remember you brooding so much,” someone said behind Bucky, and when he turned around, he saw Tony leaning against the wall a few meters away.
Yeah, alright, he was kinda avoiding him.
kissing Tony, and that wasn’t much of a surprise. What he did regret, though, was having to reject Tony a second time.
With Bucky gone, everything was in question now. Everything had slowed around Steve. He knew the world was in danger. True danger. He knew it all, but the distance between knowledge and action seemed endless. He couldn’t move. He was literally frozen in place—staring at the broken pub around him as the world provided a true definition of slow motion.
“Ross doesn’t have a personal problem with Bucky, it’s bigger than that,” Tony said, his voice quiet and reserved and Steve found himself sighing as he, eventually, did step back.
Steve pulled away first and after a breathless second or two he opened his eyes. “Tony,” he breathed, a watery smile gracing his face. His touch was soft and exploratory. He kissed Tony’s upper lip, his lower lip, his chin; his hand slid up his arm, palming his cheek as his mouth found his again. The gentle invasion of his tongue into Tony’s mouth finally broke Steve out of his stunned silence, and he melted into him with a soft breath.
Somehow, Friday’s silence sounded very judgmental.
A low ping announced his arrival. Steve drew a deep breath and willed himself closer to the landing pad. The agents surrounding the Quinjet cast him a few odd looks, but otherwise ignored his still-a-little-disheveled look. Tony had probably known what he was doing when he’d pulled at Steve’s hair as hard as he had, but Steve couldn’t find it in him to care.
Tony cleared his throat. “Did you have any pains?”
“I didn’t think you’d come,” Tony said. His tone wasn’t loud, nor was it accusatory; but it surprised Steve nonetheless. Did he really think that? How could he not have expected him to come after what had happened tonight?
* * *
Tony rolled his eyes as he walked towards Mark XLVIII. “I think you forgot about the fact that our team split up. I don’t care if you’re all one happy family in 2022,
Phil’s team was putting shackles around the unconscious soldier’s hands and legs, bringing them outside. In the background, a man and a woman were busy working on the Cryostasis tanks, and Steve saw as the woman shook her head when she checked the remaining soldier’s vitals. Natasha had left to look for Zemo—Nick and Phil, on the other hand, were simply standing on the sidelines, watching Steve and Tony warily.
Steve blinked, dumbfounded. “You’re what?”
Steve wanted to hide, but Tony acted as if nothing was amiss. After dropping a light kiss on Steve’s sweaty brow, he pushed both of them upright, holding Steve steady as he helped him to his feet.
Something inside Tony’s eyes shifted. Was that disappointment? “I was told I could find you here,” he said conversationally. “I’m part of the Avengers for this gig, so I thought I’d introduce myself before we meet on the battlefield.”
Children had been off the table for the whole span of his adult life. In his younger days he simply hadn’t wanted anything to mess with the whole playboy lifestyle—partying and jet setting didn’t work well with having kids, after all. When he’d turned thirty he’d partied and jet setted (and done other things) enough to know that he’d be the world’s most horrible father, and dismissed the idea with a shrug and a sip of his current drink. Come forty, he’d thought about it here and there, but never too seriously, at least never enough to actually do something about it. After Afghanistan, after realizing how meaningless his life had been up to this point, he’d convinced himself that it’d be better to have the Stark dynasty end with him. In his darkest hours, he’d come to believe that aside from maybe his engineering skills, he really had nothing to give to a son or daughter.
Tony’s face twisted in annoyance. “It would’ve withstood a l-lot, but this is r-ridiculous.” As he spoke, white clouds left his mouth and he was shivering with the cold. “We sh-should’ve s-set up camp in the r-ruins.”
Tony slipped one arm around Steve and squeezed. “Proud papa.”
Steve thought, and tried not to let any of that longing show in his expression.
“Do you know where he is?” Steve asked, already sounding much more like himself. There was a glint in his eyes—full of rage and strength and something far too close to self-destruction.
He pressed a finger to his phone (two generations older than his current phone) and glanced at the date.
“Please don’t shut me out.”
“That how you thank me?” Bucky shouted, as he toppled over on his back.
He wanted to bury his face in Steve’s chest, wrap himself around his body, and make sure he was whole and healthy, that there was no blood on his skin, no empty, glassed over eyes staring into the distance.
“If you have a clear shot at the Winter Soldier, aim for his legs,” Natasha ordered.
When he stepped into the bar, the hammering in his chest just confirmed how very much not ready he had been for this. For the image of Steve sitting at the bar, right next to two guys, all dressed up nicely, and writing down something that was likely his phone number or whatever.
“He knows what he’s doing,” Natasha said. “If he needs Pierce to believe he’s dead, then this is our best option.”
Steve rolled his eyes. “Yeah, fine!”
“Answer the lady,” Fury said, leaning forward as well.
But he
Time froze in that way Tony always suspected was too real for a hallucination and yet not real enough, despite the craziness his world embellished on a regular basis. But: There he was.
There was a pause. Then, Stark heaved a long sigh. “No. It isn’t. Sorry. I didn’t mean to… Sorry. I’m just sick of all this.”
Tony took a deep breath, exhaled it.
There was a slight rustle behind Steve, the barest hint of a sound, then he suddenly felt cool air wafting past his neck. Whirling around without exposing his back to Strucker’s men, Steve fixated the woman—the
Eager to compare him to Indries, most likely.
Steve raised a brow. “He must’ve loved that.”

Bucky rolled as if he had intended to do it, and was back on his feet quickly. Steve had barely enough time to turn around and hammer the code Tony’d given him into the console, opening the cabinet.
Of course that’s what Natasha had been up to. Tony rolled his eyes.
Steve knew Tony’s injuries weren’t severe, Bruce had said as much. After Thor had fished him out of the ocean, Bruce had given him a first check-up, and while he had a head trauma, two bruised ribs and one sprained ankle, he was otherwise fine. Or was as fine as he could be, Steve mused, now that Extremis was gone.
Tony groaned. He had no idea what he’d done, what he might’ve told Steve. Fuck.
Steve heaved a heavy breath, leaning his head back against the wall and staring up to the ceiling. “You know… the first thing out of my mouth when I met Buck was a lie,” he said after a moment, and smiled at the puzzled expression on Natasha’s face.
Strange stepped closer to him and Tony had never hated him and his stupid goatee and his stupid cape as much as in this very moment.
talk with Pepper?”
"Thanks, Iron Man," Steve said, finding a more comfortable position to settle in the metal arms. He wished Tony had deigned to notify him before he scooped him up like this, but it beat having to stick around and breathe any more of whatever that had been.
Tony checks his hair in the mirror before responding. "What the hell do you do here all day anyway after we kicked the purple prune's ass? Luring monsters and ghouls down the storm drains of the mystic world with your magical doodads?"
Steve immediately snaps to attention. "SAM

of explaining to do. But that can wait. Right now, Tony needs to get fucked hard.
“Look Cap. I’ll be completely honest with you.”
At first, he wondered if Tony had a change of heart. But whenever he walked by the lab and glanced through the window panels to catch Tony's eye, Tony would return him the warmest, apologetic smile. Tony would occasionally give Steve a silly wave and if his mood was better, he would make hand signals just to confuse the love-struck soldier.
For example, beneath all his flamboyance and boisterous personality, Steve noticed that Tony had a quirk when it came to personal space. Unless he was the one initiating the contact, he would recoil at the slightest touch. Possibly an extension of his utter dislike to being handed anything, Tony once force-coughed so loudly to avoid an older woman’s embrace at a charity gala that Steve turned red trying to suppress a laugh.
He wishes the earth would just swallow him whole, and maybe take Clint with him for springing this out on him. Laura seems to be the forgiving kind anyway.
Tony drags a breath in through his teeth before he burst into a light chuckle. "No. But thank you. For the support. I feel absolutely supported," Tony says, slapping his chest in mock-gratefulness. Peter twists his mouth in annoyance but doesn't retaliate as Tony starts to break into a laugh.
He cleared his throat.
To his horror, Sam starts to tell the story. Steve silently wishes for a quick painless death, because like clockwork, his brain was flooded.
The very next hour, a memo went out to the team prohibiting any act of going through walls, citing privacy laws. Nobody responded to the email but Tony himself, who wasn't even present when the conversation took place, and he was surprisingly very casual about the entire thing.
"Trust me

Laura caved in eventually, thanking Tony with fresh cookies and hot meals whenever he came.
If Steve was being honest, he couldn't really tell the difference, didn't quite care, but he secretly loved watching Tony with his bed hair pointing in all directions go off on why Sesame Street was superior at 7 in the morning.
He was still haunted by the fear in Tony’s eyes as he fell over the bloodied man in the cold winds of Siberia.
It made Tony's heart sink to the pit of his belly.

"Tony fits in perfectly. Frankly, I never thought I'd be attracted to anyone after the ice, let alone a man. It took me a while to admit it to myself. I never planned to fall in love with him Sam, but I did and it still scares me how much I need him."
"What? No smart comeback?" Tony goads.

His body floated in the Iron Man armour as FRIDAY navigates it back to the sterling building that he owns, once a beacon of hope for the city that almost got wiped out from the map five years ago. A city he helped save, at the near cost of his own life. The Tower, now on the market, still bears the Avengers logo on it even though it has long been vacated from any superhero activity. For a while Tony did take up residence there, but it has been nearly a year since he stepped foot in the premises, opting to instead move into his family mansion a half hour drive away.
"Totally did."
"Are we... Uhm. Is this..?" Steve says, his voice breaking so he clears his throat.
"Whoa whoa whoa there, kid.
"It's fine," he finally says softly.
The sounds of cushions bouncing off the floor and newspaper being shoved around was followed by a groan.
They balk.
"Where's Petey?" Tony asks, channeling some responsible parenting, all the while he reciprocates his husband's advances, shutting his eyes and grinding his ass against Steve's dick in a semi-public place. Tony was slightly disappointed that said dick was still clothed.

Then again, the average four year old did not have Tony Stark as a parent to give the modifications a personal touch.
"You know, it was a kick to the face when you said that you were done trying. That maybe we're just not a good fit."
“Hi Tony,” he said, hoping his smile did not betray his jumping heart. He always appreciated spending time alone with Tony, which did not come by often. He couldn’t help but look forward to these moments nonetheless as their private conversations always never, if not rarely ended up in blows.
He makes a mental note to introduce the two brilliant teenagers. At the end of the pleasant walk, Shuri was so smitten by Tony that she proposed that they meet again to compare notes on her Panther Habit and his Mark L suit. Tony was more than happy to set up a meeting, and since Shuri was more often than not in US thanks to the Outreach centre in Oakland, the meeting was genuinely in the books for the two intellectuals.
Steve closes his eyes and thought of the night before they left for Sokovia.

“I came to the kitchen for a snack,” Steve replies carelessly, "And I'm getting my snack," he finishes before he spreads Tony’s ass cheeks apart. He gives Tony a slow wet lick across his hole, taking his time dragging his tongue across and back, lavishing the entrance over and over before he pushes his tongue in. Once he hears a positively dirty moan from Tony, Steve began kneading Tony's ass harshly as he circles his tongue and prodded Tony's hole with his thumb. It drew a hoarse cry from his older lover, and soon Tony was gasping and moaning because Steve was mercilessly sucking on his entrance and rubbing his thumb into the rim in preparation for further penetration.

Swiftly she sets on her feet to leave her personal space and crosses the boxcar graceful as a cat, and plants herself by the wide open door facing Steve, one boot swinging over the edge.
Tony leaned closely into Steve's ear.
17 hours later, as the three former Avengers sat quietly in a freight train in the dead of night en route to a safe house, battle bruised and down-timing, the nomadic soldier softly hit the back of his head against the trunk he was leaning on in a steady rhythm, resorting to physical methods to drown the audio and visuals in his head.
The sorcerer supreme looks at Tony flatly. He spreads his hands towards various areas of the kitchen counter, in particular the corner where Tony was bent over half hour ago. Tony breaks into a shit-eating grin but says nothing.
And coincidentally or not, he had plenty.
He watches as Tony's eyes map him, planning on what best to do with the super soldier underneath him. It was insanely hot.
"Yeah? Tell me something specific? About school. Anything."
Tony was a firm believe in Going Big or Go Home, even before it became an everyday pop-culture catchphrase.
"So you guys dated," Peter concludes cooly.
conversation. “Should I get dressed?” Steve asks sounding apologetic.
“He won’t eat?” Tony asks, peering over Steve to see their son’s back hunched over on the carpet in the living area, with a sea of color-grouped Lego blocks surrounding him. At the edge of the living room were finished products – Lady Liberty, the Lincoln Memorial, the old Avengers Tower.
“What if, what if I hadn’t had a lot to drink?" Tony asks sedately, hips still leisurely riding the wave of Steve's pleasure. "If it wasn’t late and there was no party, just you and me. Would you kiss me, Steve?” Tony asks, a glaze over his eyes but he looks so damn sexy, he feels so damn good that Steve just licks his lips in reply. Tony starts to really rut into him and Steve sinks his fingers into Tony's waist to keep him in place. In that moment, Steve decides that he was going to hell for encouraging this. He might as well have fun on the trip over. He bucks his hips up to meet Tony half way and they quickly fall into rhythm.
"Hey Stark!"
There was a time where columns wrote really nasty things about Tony Stark due to his less than sterling reputation as the
Steve shot a moan in pleasure as his hips bucked.
He presses the back of his hand against mouth to suppress a yawn. When he tries to move, there was a solid weight over him pressing his body down. Tony properly blinks awake and looks down his bare chest to see blond, mussed hair laying atop of him.
Steve was half way gone when Tony pulled off and jerked Steve's erection to take a breather. His free hand began to unbutton his own jeans and he kicked them off at record speed, in preparation for the big event. Tony reached out to his discarded jeans and dug into its backpocket; Steve then hears a small pop and swallowed.
"Steve seems to think you're worth all the trouble. My kid loves you to death. I think you're quite alright. So here's my friendly advise - I actually have on good authority that Natasha's idea of a happily ever after? It's exactly what she told you it was. So you're not technically having a Steve-Tony epic dilemma here."
He sighs happily as he crosses his arms and leans on the door frame.
"Those are all
"You were having another nightmare Boss."
They melt into a kiss in the hallway, whispering I love yous to each other.
”Uncle Rhodey got you a present Daddy look!”
Tony drops his head in resignation.
"Daddy I'm com- oh Tony I'm coming, ugh -"
. The only reason Steve even noticed Sam's presence that fateful evening was because the elevator was in his (half-lidded) line of vision and his eidetic memory forbade him to forget things; otherwise, Steve could barely remember his own name by the time Tony was done with him that night.
"I'm sorry you had the misfortune of experiencing .. that
The night they finally crossed the Rubicon.
enjoy alcohol like a normal person. It's tiring to always be the sensible one, the sober one. Sometimes Steve missed being able to blame an external element as an excuse to give into his inhibitions, an excuse for poor behaviour.
"Yeah. Like an idiot, I proposed to him while we were at the uh Hamptons that summer."
Tony also remembers how it shot to heaven, and came down crashing into hell.
"You want Daddy's cock in you?"
"Tony, I'm talking about your heart. I really don't like this - the idea of you going alone is seriously scary. Rhodey is going to lose it when he finds out, I don't even know how I'm going to explain this to him."
“Ohhhh baby you want that ass baby? You wanna – AH YES – baby right right there. Stevie honey forget what I said earlier, I need you to fuck me right now. I want your cock so so badly baby fuck fuck fuck me right here please.”

In a split second, they're eye to eye again. "I'm only asking because I don't want to force you into anything you're not entirely comfortable with. I want us to be on the same page. I'm happy to work on your pace. I want you to be happy," Tony emphasises on the last few words.
Sam notices again the redness creeping from Steve's neck up to his cheeks as he gushes at the memory. How serious are these two, Sam once wondered. He may have gotten his answer.
The lights. The sounds. The smell of popcorn and hotdogs and caramelised apples filled the air. The carnival was everything Peter had been looking forward to.
Tony gently tried again, braver this time, curling his fingers around Steve's shirt,
They stand opposite of each other in the small hallway in silence for a while. Steve leans against the wall and crosses his arms, frowning in contemplation. Tony does the same but he hooks his arms to his neck, watching his man.
The phone he never got to use.

Tony’s knees were buckling from being tongue-fucked by his husband, simultaneously enjoying how possessive Steve can be. Truthfully, Tony knows that this is

for you with that ridiculous old flip phone they helped him buy. Nat tells me he wasted 3 full writing pads trying to write you a letter. He wrote some, tore it, doodled your face, tore that. Wrote some more. He drove her crazy."
"Look at those tits of yours," Tony whispers, pressing his fingers around the left light pink nub, squeezing it tightly. Steve gasps and arches into the sensation. His hand flies to grab Tony by his forearm, not to stop but to further encourage. "Fuck, Steve, you're gorgeous. Look at you." He twiddles the nipple, swirling his thumb over it, flicking it before grabbing a handful of flesh in his hand.
“I’m really not the best person to even talk about this,” Steve says, hesitantly. “But yeah, Bucky and Nat are going through some sort of a rough patch." Steve clears his throat before he continues. "He uh asked for her hand in marriage couple of weeks ago and she kind of turned him down.”
, Steve..." he moans, eyes shut, licking the corners of his open mouth.
This was Tony's penance.
It made him smile.
By this time, Tony and Steve had just started exploring their relationship and Steve was really looking forward to being alone with Tony again. To Steve's disappointment, Tony did not appear as eager, choosing instead to lock himself up in the lab with Bruce the second they returned to base, to study the alien weapon. Of course at that time, Steve had no idea what Wanda Maximoff had done to Tony that drove him deep into his mind to create Ultron.
Steve gazes out into the night and shakes his head. "I don't know Nat. Really, I wish I knew what I'm doing. What this is."
“The cameras at the mall were grainy but nothing JARVIS couldn't fix. Honestly, Cap? You literally just stood there and let poor Romanoff do all the work. Bad, would be a great understatement,” Tony says, propping himself up in a swift move.
"These are for you," Tony replies instead, finally handing him the flowers. Steve takes them, and they smell fresh and lovely even in the cold Norwegian winter. "Hope you like them."
Whilst the both of them were buck naked, thankfully they were covered in a large throw blanket. Tony wonders if this was Steve's doing. The blanket was definitely not there when they fell asleep on the couch last night.
, Tony?" Steve repeated, his voice rising but he wouldn't meet Tony's gaze. "You left."
It could be him, it could be Steve.
Toys were strewn haphazardly everywhere.
Steve disagrees.
"No. Yes. Sort of. He's not mine. But I think you'd like him."
, but he bites his tongue. He begins to regret entertaining the idea that all this interaction was going to lead to a happily ever after. Tony was tipsy. He may or may not regret tonight when he sobers up, but Steve could already imagine himself replaying this moment for months to come with a tub of ice cream in hand if it turns out that Tony really didn't feel the same way.
Between his own legs, Steve’s cock was rock hard, tenting underneath his loose French linen trousers, eagerly waiting to claim its prize.
"You're not doing so bad right now."
Not that it did him any good.
“Well in all fairness, Steve thought I was an ass too when we first met,” Tony remembers. “Before I stopped being a metaphoric ass and he fell in love with the real stuff.” The wizard's face twisted in disgust and he was about to retort but Tony holds a finger up. “
Tony steps aside to let him through but Steve makes a quick dash to the storage behind the front door.
He takes a big gulp of the pipping hot beverage, regrets it, but chugs it down his throat anyway. The burn and caffeine eases the panic in his brain momentarily.
"BARNES KILLED MY MOTHER." Now Tony was yelling.
"Are you going to be alright?" She insists as she flattens the lapels of his jacket, picking off lint at the edges. Her hands were shaking.
answers," the spy says, catching the eye of Sam Wilson and jerking her head to him for participation. "Let's talk feelings."
"The girls in my high school are so gonna be disappointed though. Captain America's is still pretty popular these days especially with the girls. Now that he's gone rogue his posters keep getting stolen and they always end up in the girl's locker -," Peter says, a light chuckle in his voice before he shuts his mouth audibly, noticing Tony's horrified expression. "Not that I'm going to say anything to anyone, I swear!" he immediately clarifies, eyes wide.
Tony smiles as he gulps the last bit of his coffee. It was decently brewed, too. Maybe it's not such a bad idea, inviting Bucky Barnes to come home with them. At least the man makes good coffee.
Even when it wasn't where he truly wanted to be.
It was his birthday.
The same can be said for Tony's but his boxers weren't as snug as the blond's. Steve was dying of ecstasy underneath Tony, writhing and mumbling sweet nothings to the thought of being taken like this.
. I can't stress enough -"
"He doesn't want to talk about it though," Natasha says, mocking a pout.
Since the present Tony Stark no longer lived in the city where AIs handled and governed the household, i.e starting the coffee at their wake or controlling the temperature to their comfort and liking, his current living quarters would require a small effort on Tony’s part to get the day going.
"Thank you for answering my call Tony. You didn't have to at all."
"No he didn't whip it out or anything," Tony says, rolling his eyes in annoyance.
"You know what, so are you," Tony's says, neutrally. "And this is a pretty shitty secret lair, by the way. I mean, dingy apartment at the wrong side of town? Cliched, even for a man who looks perpetually constipated, swinging a metal arm. Which, by the way, needs to be looked at. I can hear you scratch your ass seven floors down from the sidewalk.
About a month later, Vision out of nowhere confirmed the Scarlet Witch's theory during physical combat training session. It completely caught Steve off guard and distracted him, earning him a hard kick square in the face from Natasha. Sam had to withhold the urge to curl to his stomach and laugh as Steve stayed flat on the mat, holding on to his bloodied nose while the Black Widow unsympathetically threw a towel to him and it landed on his face. That helped conceal his blush when Vision continued to matter-of-factly state that he has on many occasions found Tony's suite empty throughout the evenings and Tony would usually emerge mid-morning looking very refreshed and appropriately bruised.
"No you didn't.”
Steve pokes his head out and nudges his chin towards Tony, seeking some clarity. Tony extracts the email from the StarkPad, converting it into a hologram for Steve’s benefit. “I must have missed this one. Rhodey's asking me to talk you into going for the special memorial service in Geneva?” Tony says, still half-way reading the appended email below Rhodey's.
," Sam carefully explains. "For yours or Stark’s DON’T EVEN-“ Sam quickly wags a finger as Steve opens his mouth to interrupt, but shuts it with an audible click. “TRY TO tell me who’s been topping or bottoming or whatever it is you two do in the sack. We are not having
Tony bites his lips to stop himself from reacting. He recognises the voice alright, but the frustration behind it? Oh that was something he was very accustomed to experiencing back in the Tower. Everyone on the team including Tony agrees that Steve was an unbearable clean freak. His mother henning was just as bad as his obsession with tidiness. So Tony could easily guess what was going on.
"All things considered, whatever you saw or heard that day, I'm glad it didn't end up on Twitter or Youtube. Facebook. Not that I don't trust you, I do. Plus I know where you live, so that's that. Anyway look - the thing is. A lot went down even before the airport and I’m not specifically talking about Siberia, or the Sokovia Accords. They teach you about the Accords in school right? You're what, 15?"
Tony shakes his head. "No I shouldn't."
"Tony I don't think-."
The exaggerated fights.
than town kind of somewhere.”
"Something I want happening again? Yes." Tony answers too quickly without allowing himself to think. It did not achieve the effect he was hoping for, as Steve continues to stare at him in earnest and only then did it click to Tony. "Rogers, after we're done playing superheroes and capes in Sokovia, you and I are going to dinner, a proper one with tables, food on plates and with clothes on. We'll have a talk about this," he says, motioning the space between them, "with
The common factor was that every note-worthy accomplishment of Tony's seemed to be an exaggeration of sorts, always tilting to one end of extremity. He either supremely excelled when he puts his heart, mind and soul to a project (e.g Iron Man armours) or fails spectacularly when he didn't (e.g dating his personal assistant, making her his CEO only to get dumped for not being able to split the difference between being a superhero and a boyfriend).
In dealing with the mental burn, Steve humoured himself that maybe the super soldier serum was more upset with him for hurting Tony, than Tony was himself.
"So after New York we sort of lost touch- I took a road trip on my own, to rediscover the world, think about what I wanted to do. I didn't think of him much until the Mandarin happened. I was in Kentucky when I heard the news, just having a beer at a local bar when the television flashed and reported that terrorist had shot missiles at his Malibu home and Tony was suspected to have been killed in the attack. The first thing I did was switch on the communicator that Fury had given me and demanded to know why wasn't I called in. What Nick said to me would probably haunt me for the rest of my life."
Can't be caught excessively enjoying the moment without coming across as forward.
"-like a train wreck?"
“I know. I should still be apologizing for being an idiot back then. I hurt you so much,” Steve says, hugging the tinier man tightly.
Those days are long gone.
words. How about that?"
"Let's get this show on the road then, Mr. Stark," he whispers, as he starts fucking his husband of five years and lover for most of his life. He drags his hips back and pounds into Tony's ass, hot and clinging to his cock.
"Do you think I can get a good big breakfast in 15 minutes?"
"He's in there, isn't he?"
Tony stretches a half-grin. “Oh I didn't. I'd totally given up on him by then,” he says casually as he settles into the seat. "I wasn't gonna ask him again."
"Come on Doc."
"But she's ... only due two months from now! Right?" Tony cries in disbelief, turning to his husband for confirmation but Steve was already halfway out of bed and into his sweatpants. "Where is she? How's the baby?" Tony asks desperately, returning his gaze to his best friend.
. One article wrote that the former weapons dealer if cut through his flesh would not draw red blood. Tony wouldn’t argue with that – lately he would likely drip espresso. Black, like his damaged heart.

on the internet,” Tony insists, as he dangles his face in front of Steve and closing in to Steve's personal space on an intimate level, sending a chill down the super soldier's spine. A good sort of chill, the sort of chill that makes him twitch in his jeans. “Something nobody else knows,” he adds, two octaves lower.
Stephen Strange barks out a laugh, but he didn't appreciate the snark. “I’m sorry if my job doesn’t end after one galactic catastrophe. It doesn't grant me the luxury of retiring and getting hitched, either.”
, he chants to himself.
He could still feel himself crowding into Tony’s personal space and lingered just above his lips, waiting for permission before whispering, “Is this okay? I don’t really want a bloodied nose if I touch you without consent.”
"Tony?"
He knows that he's being petty, he knows from the desperation in Steve's voice that the super soldier was hurting for him and that he genuinely wants to meet to make amends, to fix what was broken. In fact the first few things that Steve said over the phone was admitting that he missed Tony, and that he was sorry. Just thinking about that confession made Tony's eyes sting because God knows how much he needed to hear that.
"Is that why you designed your first onesie with two colours that block each other out?"
“Ha-ha Mr. Stark. That was
"Can I get you some water?" Peter asks, breaking the silence.
"How do you know Steve's posters end up in the girl's locker room?
“You didn’t come out of that bunker peachy yourself, you know,” Sam reminds.
This is his life now.
Clint squats on the steps.
Which is why when the lab lockdown went on for three whole days, Steve was miserable.
“You really didn't know that?”
"Get dressed, sweetheart. We gotta go," Steve says, his hands on the door knob.
If the situation they were in was not as morose, it would have come across as comical.
Steve just grunts, sentences not forming in his near-fucked out brain. He nods half-heartedly, but realises that Tony was going to need real words. "I'm okay," he manages to choke out.
Tony wants to say.
Breathe!
His previous birthdays was a yearly affair matching the hype of nationally televised award shows. When he withdrew Stark Industries from the business of mass-producing militarised weaponry - its most lucrative division - his company did not suffer but instead continued to make its billions. Heck, Tony Stark couldn't just fight alongside a Norse god, a supersoldier, two master assassins and a green rage monster to save the world from an alien invasion- he

Tony's face twists. Of course the freaking Smithsonian.

holding back. I always had one foot out the door, ready to take off at the first sight of trouble. I took advantage of the situation. And you're not wrong about me sending you mixed signals; I realise now that I was reeling you in when it was convenient and shutting you out when things got rough. You have given me so much of you yet I couldn't even give you a straight answer."
But he is.
Steve drops his head back and nearly chews his lower lip off to cut himself from moaning.
"Let me do all the work okay? 'S your turn to enjoy the night, mister," Steve hums before he presses a thumb into Tony's puffy, loosened rim and the digit slides into the slick hole without resistance. That elicits another dirty moan from Tony which goes straight to Steve's groin. He groans and bites the hard flesh of Tony's ass, making his husband yelp. "You fucked me so good earlier sweetheart, letting me ride you, filling me up as I come over and over. Now let me show my best fella a good time, alright?" Steve continues suckling at his husband's entrance hungrily, saliva dripping out the corners of his mouth as he tongues the swollen rim, flicking his tongue over and over again to taste, and diving in to open.
"A sex toy."
," Tony begins to warn.
. No, I’m not attending that one,” Steve replies casually before his head disappears back into the bathroom. Tony could hear their child's muffled gargling and spitting in the sink.
Because it was equally quiet where Steve was calling, he could hear Steve's irregular breathing and in his attempt to force a breath in through one nostril, a clear sniffle escaped.
"Oh -
"Tony. I'm so,
"Is he coming back?"

Their eyes meet, his still red with tears and hers filled with love.
He hides his face from view nonetheless, as he scoops up his toddler.
“Finish your broccoli."
“I’m not your personal time travelling magician Tony. Start walking, the church isn't even that far,” he says as he opens the front door. Wong steps out first, followed by the father and son duo.
The war tore lives apart, and the triumph appeared to have brought back together broken pieces of mankind in jape.
Peter blinks and smiles robotically, hands drawn out and taking a step forward. "Maybe you'll feel better?"
“So I’m going to be Romanoff and you just, well you just do what you did that day, buddy.”
"You wanna meet him huh. Well no promises, kid. I've broken too many to make another. But you know, something tells me the two of you would hit it off. By the way, could you stop calling me Mr. Stark?"
It was a cloudless morning. 6:13am. A Thursday.
And Tony was slumped on the ground, at their mercy now.
As though nature had hear him curse under his breath, he feels a gush of wind and inhales the sweet scent of fresh grass. Tony squints as the sun shone brightly above the vast piece of land that surrounded the farmhouse. He instantly recognises the meadow where the Quinjet, packed with wounded and frazzled Avengers, once landed.
"And you want me," Steve begins, emphasising the last word, but Tony shakes his head.
This was the memory of their break up.
much of an effect on the supersoldier to actually convince him to finally move in. Tony was yelling 70% of the time anyway.
As his body goes limp, Tony strangely feels at ease.
"I'm crushed," Bucky says flatly, his facial expression a scary cross between woeful and unimpressed.
Tony captures Steve's lips again, slow and soft in a way to apologize. He knows,
"Ignore it, probably some -
"I've missed you Tony. And I'm so,
felt like a punch to the gut. I threw up outside the bar after that conversation, the first time I ever felt sick since the super soldier serum was put in me. The thought of people losing their lives because I wanted a vacation was nauseating enough, but in the moment, it was Tony, a civilian who had just saved the damn planet from an alien invasion, someone I've come to know and respected, had gotten killed. My head was just crowded with the thought that he wouldn't have died if I had been there for him."
As Steve chants Tony's name like prayer, he runs his hands over his hair, unintentionally flexing and showing off his gorgeous, sculptured body.
The loaded question.
, Tony curses to himself, realising he's forgotten about their appointment today. And it's actually been rescheduled twice now.
"So how was Christmas at Rhodey's?" Steve asks, breaking the silence. He sinks into the recliner opposite of Tony. It's Bucky's favourite chair in the entire apartment.
Tony shakes his head, in denial. "You know what I can't get out of my head Pep? Barnes. Something's going on there. He was protecting Barnes like the man meant the world to him. I could have blown off the guy's head the way I blew off his arm but I didn't. Steve just went for me. He went to town with the shield."
It was no secret that he misses Pepper and Happy dearly.
Now he has his pants around his thighs with a wet spot on the crotch of his underwear.
There was too much at stake for him to fail at a grand scale. But as he cautiously gazes to his left, internally worrying that any movement or thought might break the status quo of the early morning, Tony swallowed.
He's almost wished he'd never brought up and made a joke about accidentally walking in on Steve having sex with Tony. At first it was funny and refreshing to see a vulnerable side of Steve he never thought existed. Nowadays outside of work, the lovestruck Captain seemed to have nothing else to talk about
“So am I,” Tony bites back without any teeth. “I know you want to go for this. The only thing stopping you is the two of us and I’m telling you not to make us out as an excuse for you to miss a ceremony honoring your good friend. I’ll say it again – we’ll be fine,” Tony says, punctuating the last three words with light punches on Steve's broad chest. “If it gives you added peace of mind, I’ll lock in the nanites on me the whole time you’re gone,” he assures.
Sam squeezes his forehead with his thumb and middle finger, breathing slowly through his nose. How has this become his life? Sam considered to make a mental note to never hang out with Steve anymore, but pushes away the thought knowing he could never commit. He genuinely liked the man, as painful as he has become lately.
He limps towards the dining table and tosses the kitchen towel over his shoulder before dropping into a seat to join Tony. The brunette raises his eyes from the StarkPad he was reading from, his glasses still resting on the tip of his nose, to study the exasperation mapped across his partner’s face. He minimises the email to divert his attention to Steve.
Steve shrugs. "I probably have some tricks left up my sleeve. The lumberjack life is not as simple as people paint it to be, it's a hardcore, continous workout. I'm out of practise but I can still pack a punch or two."
“But Uncle Thor can lift the hammer because he’s worthy,” Peter reasons, catching Tony off-guard. “And he’s a god.”
to find him despite looking like he's taken the worst beating Tony has seen Steve take (even the Chitauri battle didn't leave Steve hospitalised). If that wasn't enough cause of concern, the man decided to show up at the Avengers Tower one evening, unannounced and having beaten JARVIS' security measures, to confess the crimes of the Winter Soldier.

believable."
“It doesn’t make sense, Sam. If I’m gonna put this on, how is he going to –“ Sam smacks his forehead in disbelief at how his warning just flew over Steve's head. “-make love to me? It’s a little too much with Tony already being so endowed-“
This earned a big a laugh as Natasha shakes her head, faking sympathy for Sam. Fortunately for the red-faced super soldier, Sam was keeping the story brief without going into any graphic details. Steve would have thrown himself off the train if he didn't.
"Field trip. Yay. Where to?"
“If Hill’s intelligence is right on this, Strucker does have the scepter. We can’t have him creating alien weaponry with it or worse, experimenting on any more civilians for HYDRA’s gain. If it’s another bust, well, this is one less Hydra base to worry about,” Steve said, in his Captain America voice.
The billionaire never came empty handed either.
"You either spend days without leaving your lab - the nanites, Jim's braces, the kid's suit - or you disappear to the farm. If we're lucky we'll catch a glimpse of you on TV appearing in Capitol Hill, or at the CIA. Or the United Nations. But you've shut us out, Tony and Jim thinks it's his fault you're like this and -" Pepper bites her lips, looks up to try not to cry - "he needs more than legs right now, Tony. He needs you, you have us. Don't shut us out. Talk to me," Pepper pleads, her eyes filling up again as she holds Tony's face.
"You bet, mister."
Steve was very much naked underneath Tony now, who still has his unbuttoned shirt on. His hands were on either side of Steve's head and he finally drops down to kiss the man. This brings their cocks together perfectly, the friction sending shocks of electricity through their veins. Steve's head was spinning, his heart thumping, his blood boiling all at once. He traces his hands on the lean muscles of Tony's back as he hooks his legs behind the man's waist, anything to seal the gap between them. Tony continues to thrust his hips into Steve, groaning into Steve's mouth in pleasure and chanting his name.
Tony was sure it was going to be a distant one soon though.
Peter couldn't hide the grin that quickly formed across his boyish face.
"Sounds good," Steve says, nuzzling into Tony's neck and melting into his body. Tony kisses the crown of his head and breathe in the scent of sex and sweat. "I'd uh I'd like that very much," Steve adds.
"You took care of my family. Despite everything." Clint was a mix bag of emotions but right now he was foremost filled with gratitude, even when his face did not show it. "Despite everything that's happened. What I said to you. Thank you Tony."
"I'm sorry that I've made you feel like you were getting only half of me, Tony. Truth is, you were right. I
, hates you. If anything he probably thinks you're a bag of dicks -which is fair because you are- but he's grateful for what you did. You know, the whole Time Stone ….. thing,” Tony swivels his hand and swallows hard, hating that he can’t even bring the topic up without his breath going off rhythm. “You took a chance on me, not many would. And here we are. Instead of, well, arguably more deserving people.”
it, Stark. The man standing in the middle of my living room a week ago? I barely recognised him. Fucks sake he was doing the whole ugly crying thing - and I've seen him cry before. This was horrible. I would have tossed him out if he hadn't started crying like a little girl on my couch. If that wasn't scary enough, finding out
knows it's your anniversary and nobody in the next room wanted to make this house call." Strange deadpans. "Barnes drew the shortest straw."
Tony had made the Bartons his first order of business straight out of the hospital, post-Siberia. When he arrived at the farmhouse, black eyed, bruised and heavily bandaged on the chest, he hesitated at the door step. Maybe he should have taken an armour for this conversation, he thought, as he wasn't sure he would be welcomed. The family patriarch was now an international criminal serving time in a top level security underwater raft in the middle of the ocean, thanks to mess he and the Avengers collectively made.
“Tony, I can go if you want,” Steve says, breaking into Tony’s monologue. Steve begins to rise, forming a cave between his perfectly sculptured body and the bed. Tony could not resist taking a peek.
-pregnant silence-
Tony hides his face behind the coffee mug.
Bucky snorts. "God you guys got together like, two hours ago and you're already meddling with each other's problems?"
It was a good thing that Peter remained where he stood, because everything happened in a split second after. Tony struggled against the burly man and flicked his implanted arm, sending a gauntlet from a damaged Mark XLVI flying across the room, shattering glass and furniture to attach itself to its maker. The piece of armour nearly hit Happy square in the face but thanks to Peter's sense and quick reflexes, he managed to web the repulser-powered gauntlet away just barely inches away from impact.
"What?" I asked in confusion. The tall, blonde guy standing next to him punched him and muttered, "Nothing," as Tony let out a hiss a pain.
I head over to my closet and push the doors open, moving my clothes aside. I see the keypad to my so called "Secret Layer" Or that's what I like to call it. The doors slide open after I enter the code. Showing the stairs that descend into the layer slash basement. The lights switch on as I got down to the concrete floor.
Suit up time.
I was sitting on my black leather couch, playing Halo 4 on my Xbox one. My phone started to buzz next to me. I looked at the caller ID to see Laura's name.
I look to the middle of the room to see what they're all fighting about, some sort of cradle. I was about to walk out of the shadows. When that man, Thor .? Yeah Thor. Appeared out of nowhere and jumps on top of it. Thor throws his hammer up. Attracting lighting before sending it to the Cradle.
"You to kiddo." I heard Tony say as I exited the house.
"Language," Tony remarked sarcastically.
"CARTER.!" Clint simi shouted. Surprised that I Carter Stewart would say something like that. I mean come on. "What I do this time.?" I asked calmly. "It's fine Barton." Fury said in a calm tone. "Are you like their boss or something.?" I asked curiously. "Yes, little lady."
As I was about to get into my car, Clint came up behind me. "Look Carter, I know you want to help but...it's to dangerous out there. And besides you haven't had enough training." I nodded my head in understanding. He was right, well as far as he knows that is. "You're right," I shook my head. "I don't know what I was thinking." I smiled to reassure him. I hug him one last time, as we say are goodbyes.
"But-"
An alarm went off indicating that the quinjet was on the move. I look to my clock that sat on my nightstand. Four O'clock.
"Shit, shit...that is really f-ing cold. I really should have the heat on down here.." Running over to my six foot glass case. My suit stood proudly in it, as it should.
"Shit." I mumbled to myself.
"Would you like to meet the team?" Nat asked. "The team? Like the Avengers?" I asked. "Yes, that's Cap aka Steve Rogers," she said, as she pointed to the man who punched Tony a moment ago. I walked up to him and shook his hand. "Hi, Ma'am." He said, shaking my hand. "Nice to meet you." I said letting his hand go. And on to the next which was. "This is Bruce Banner." Nat said, with a shy but loving smile. Well that's new- I noted.
Perfect.!
"Damn it, Clint." I whispered under my breath. "Well, I'm going to head out, where all of you can get some rest." Fury said as he took his leave. "Me too, it was nice meeting all of you." I said gabbing my bag. Laura came up and hugged me goodbye.
"I'm Laura's sister. Who are you?" He looked a little taken aback by this.
"I said No, we're the Avengers. This is are job, Not yours. We do this to protect you and the rest of the world. So just drop it, Carter."
*The Next Morning*
As I rushed out the door, I put my long, ginger hair into a messy bun.
"Well, if you would've let me finish my sentence. Yes, he just called saying he will be here any moment. But-"
I teleported to New York just outside of the tower. What floor did Clint say it was.? Sixty-Seventh.? I know it has a six in it somewhere. When I finally found it, it turn out to be the sixty-eighth floor instead. I heard the voices of Tony and Bruce. They where in the lab, lot bigger then the one a had at home. But more importantly, what was Bruce and Tony on about.?
"What.?" Asked Tony.
"Really, Ging? You couldn't come up with anything better than that?" He took a moment to think about it before a big grin spread across his lips. "Well, I could always call you Ginger Snap!" He replied. I shook my head, "And that's what I get for asking." I giggled.
Carter meets the Team.
"Fine, I'll drop it. I'm gonna go for a walk, I'll be back later." I mumbled. I was about to leave, when Laura grabbed my arm. "You know he's just looking out for you." Laura whispered. "I know," I muttered "That's what makes it so hard to be mad at him." She giggled, thinking this was funny.
It only took five minutes to get to Clint's house. Maybe that's because I might have sped. But seriously, this place is like a ghost town sometimes. As soon as I got there I was to thrilled that Clint was back. I didn't notice as I bolted up the steps, that I was face first in a hard muscler chest. I looked up to the man and mumbled a quick, "Sorry," and ran inside. "Who was that guy?" I thought as I walked into the hallway next to the living room. I stopped right next to the door frame, just so I could sneak a peek first.
"Can I ask you something.?" He was about to answer, when Clint so rudely interrupted. "The answers still No, Carter."
"Is it Clint? Is he back? IS HE?" I begged through the phone. I could hear her chuckling at me being impatient.
I changed into a black tank top with a red leather jacket and a pair of black skinny jeans. And to top it off, I paired it with my caramel brown combat boots.
"Okay," I interrupted again. "I'll be over in ten minutes...or less, bye." I hung up the phone and jumped off the couch and sprinted towards my bedroom to change.
"What little witch.? And can someone please explain what's going on.?" I asked. Tired of their petty fighting. "The Maximoff twins. One of them does this weird mind tricks. That messed with some of are heads. And the other one is fast." Tony explained.
No Chapter Summary.
"So where'd he go.? And what's going on.?" I glanced sideways at Clint for answers. "That's none of your concern kid. This is for grown-ups only." Tony remarked. "I'm 21 year's old. Not a kid. So what is it, what's wrong.?" I had a dreadful feeling, in the pit of my stomach. That I wouldn't like the answer.
"Wow, nice view of the city from up here." I said to myself. Shit, I almost forgot to turn on my voice changer. I can't have anyone finding out it's me under this mask. I teleport again this time to almost get hit by a train. Which isn't even on the tracks, next thing I knew a blue blur grabs me by my waist. Moving me away from where the train was heading. Which was a brick wall. 'That must have been Pietro Maximoff.' I thought as he let me go and moved on to the next person. He moved more of the citizens out of the way. I decided it was about time I helped out, and moved into action and helped him move the rest of the citizens.
He wanted to bear
Tony nodded, more relieved than he thought he would be. When had he become so dependent on what Steve Rogers thought of him? Since when did he care so much about his opinion?
“Have you tried to make the LOC change substantially?” Bruce asked, from where he was hunched over Tony’s tablet, scrolling through the thousand lines of code.
For now, though, there was waiting. Steve took hold of his sketchbook, retreated outside to set up his tent, and waited for Rhodes and Tony to return.
Sam, Barnes and Natasha weren’t here yet, but it was only a matter of minutes now, then Steve would be sent back to his own time.
Steve straightened his back. “We’ll see about that.”
-Century-Know-It-All, then I’d suggest you take the lube and get to work.”
Steve stared at him blankly, then he seemed to realize what Tony was talking about and cast him a soft smile. “Technically, I didn’t fall.”
Tony wisely remained where he was, at the far end of the room, trying to look as nonthreatening as possible. Of course, with Stane’s corpse lying to his feet, and the many…
The late evening sunlight had assumed a strange, almost unreal bluish white tint. The air had gone a little chillier, and all the colors faded; it became darker and darker as at the beginning of a violent storm.
“Sorry. Might’ve lost a few brain cells back there,” Steve drawled, deadpan. He refused to feel bashful about this. The moments of intimacy with Tony were far too rare for that.
“Jerk,” he retorted, his voice boisterous as his hand reached for Tony’s pants. “Come up here, I wanna touch you.” With that, he quickly hauled Tony up with two fingers in his belt. He opened it quickly, shoving both Tony’s pants and his boxers down over his ass. His fingertips gently caressed his hard length as the rest of him fought to get both of their jeans down.
Half an hour.
Steve was already waiting for him when he reached the bottom. Their eyes met. For a moment they stood still, as though afraid of breaking the thread that seemed to stretch across the room to connect them. Gradually, it pulled them closer. Tony had no name for it. It felt almost a sacrilege to try and put words to this new thing between them.
The corners of Barnes’ mouth quirked up. “No, it’s fine… It’s just, Nat already warned me that you’re dying to look at it. I was sorta waiting for you to ask me.”
Tony laughed, and saw Steve’s eyes sparkling at the sound. That would be something he would definitely have to capture on camera.
That was impossible, wasn’t it? The day had left Steve little more than tired and confused, and the night wasn’t looking to be any better. He had spent a lot of time trying to understand his encounter with Tony. The underlying meaning, but unsurprisingly, his efforts were to little avail. And now, he really wasn’t sure how to react. Tony was here again, and it was the
Peter looked down at him, his expression a little bashful. “You know… most people in my school, and May’s friends, our neighbours and friends and basically everyone I know… they don’t think about you badly. I remember when people started talking about you and Captain America and this new superhero team in New York. The Avengers have been… an inspiration to people for almost as long as I can remember. I know you guys had to deal with a lot of bad rep lately, but… the way you dealt with all those villains when you didn’t have to, and fought for us over and over again, just because it was the right thing to do, I mean… you’re
But the rest of their relationship after that, was history.
"Stop with all the lies Tony!"
Clint stands up and straightens his crumpling pants.
"I know about Cap and you."
In Wakanda, Tony receives a grand welcome by the King himself, accompanied by his younger sibling. The princess was eager to meet the one and only Tony Stark, introducing herself without prompt and Tony took an instant liking to the wise-cracking teenager, far beyond her years much like he was at her age, but smarter. The pair kicked off quickly, leaving T'Challa and Okoye tailing them loosely from behind as the two geniuses dived into their language of science, briefly distracted from the real purpose behind Tony's presence in the kingdom.
Peter was visibly concerned. "Mr. Stark, we can do it some other time. I can go but do you need me to call somebody? I can get Happy, he's just out -”
“She said no huh? Talk to me James.”
Sure Tony's noticed the way Steve has looked at him,
Steve grinned.
“Turn around,” he whispers, a grin stretching from ear to ear.
He couldn't help but groan though - their fun was at his expanse and he getting nervous about what Sam could be sharing with Natasha.
He dialled, and waited.
Tony took a step into Steve. He tried really hard to hold himself from reaching out to touch his former lover, but he knew he had given up that right. "I came here, because I don't want you to make a mistake. I'm here but I can't fix it if---"
"Then you should really be nicer to Strange. Maybe he'll pull a spell or two for us more often than just for our anniversary night. You can fuck me without worrying about waking Peter and the entire town 10 miles away."
This was exactly Steve's current predicament.
They both turn at the sound of Steve's awakening. The blond super soldier sits up from the couch and stretches his arms far and wide. His tussled hair, the slight blush on his cheeks was a sight to behold. When he scratches his neck, Tony's attention was brought to the various visible marks that he had left on his new boyfriend. One nipple was quite well ravished.
He walked away all the same.
Given his age and the physical damage his body had endured over the course of the years, particularly of recent events, Tony considers himself fortunate that he is still able to satisfy his sexually demanding lover. To compensate human enhancements, Tony was not above being creative and flexible to achieve mutual pleasure. Even if Steve seemed to have a slight exhibitionist streak in him, Tony was always game.
cartoon image splashed across it.
Maybe there was hope at a friendship between them after all.
"What'ju say to him?"
“This is your chance to do it over," Tony says, pointing his finger square in Steve's chest, poking it accusingly. "Your reputation depends on it!" he exclaims loudly.
Because that night changed everything between them.
"What?"
The cool night became so much warmer that Tony felt toasty in only his tshirt and jeans.
More likely than anything, this fire engine was going to take flight like a Quinjet. Surely anything heavily modified with miniaturised rocket powered blasters shouldn’t qualify as an average four year old’s toy.
's wedding. He already hates you, so maybe you can you know, win some points over?"
Sam picks the card up to read a neat handwriting behind it and slowly mutters a curse under his breathe, shaking his head as he breaks into a choked laugh.
"I'm not your problem, Stark."
He had literally taken a page out of Clint’s book; built a farmhouse and moved there permanently once he finally decided and officially retired from the superhero business. The farm was everything he’d pictured it to be. In the middle of nowhere, far from New York which for unknown reasons seemed to attract more super villains and extra terrestrial beings than any other city on earth.
"Oh, we've got a field trip coming up!"
Tony regrets being snippy
If he had his way, Tony would have demolished the Tower instead of letting it go to someone else; he'd much prefer to get rid of its sight. The grand structure reminded him too much of Steve. In every sense, the Tower was where it all began.
"It's his best friend's wedding. His
"I am very sorry to intrude. Agent Hill was on the line, wishing to speak to Captain Rogers. She has been informed that Captain Rogers is currently
Three bottles each later, things finally started to get interesting.
They’d also openly complement each other and had no qualms in being physically affectionate, under the pretense that it was all bromance. The shoulder bumps, the pat on the back, the private lunch dates, the lingering touches during a seemingly innocent pass of a cup of coffee at breakfast ..
"Alright then. But you gotta let me know if -"
didn't plan this trip."
It did not escape Sam that Steve's quarters has significantly improved over the past month or two - the furniture was unlike any that Sam had seen before within the Compound. He's hung out at Rhodey's place, Nat's, even Vision's -  and though he's never been in Tony's suite, he had a feeling the billionaire had a lot to do with the facelift that only Steve's apartment seemed to have received.
