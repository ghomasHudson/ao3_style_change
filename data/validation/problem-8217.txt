He’s got no fucking idea why he’d bring his imprisonment up, of all things, but he suddenly finds he wants to talk about it with someone. Pepper and Rhodey are always trying to get him to open up about his extended stay in the shithole of the world, but it puts him on edge, rehashing those memories to his friends, sharing the horror of the situation and the fear of his heart failing during those long, cold nights. And the shrink he’d been forced (by Pepper, of course) to see when he’d first gotten back was an unmitigated disaster. He’d pretty much spent the hour alternating between hitting on her and attempting to psychoanalyze her, answering her gentle probing with unsubtle questions of his own. If the way she stormed out of the office that last visit was any indication, he’d pissed her off pretty good and wasn’t invited back.
He gets up to use the bathroom a few times, and once he makes the mistake of looking in the mirror.
“He says he didn’t ask you to clean anything, and that he will, I quote: “Clean the whole fucking kitchen later, Jesus Tony.””
“You don’t have to stay anymore, I’m not going to drown in my own puke or anything,” Tony says, offhand like it isn’t a big deal that maybe he could have, like he’s been in the position before where someone did need to be there to prevent him from dying in his drunken sleep. Another awful stab of feeling, and Steve can’t really take it anymore.
Tony’s a little bit surprised; he hasn’t seen Steve since he moved into the Tower a week ago, and now he’s here, walking casually into the lab, looking around curiously.
Steve keeps staring and Tony glances at him and suddenly he realizes how close they’ve gotten. Their faces are less than a foot away from each other, and everywhere their legs are touching suddenly feels hot, and Tony can sense Steve’s arm resting along the back of the couch, and if Steve wanted to he could just reach down with his hand and pull Tony in…
They settle on the old couch, burn marks and stains and worn leather welcoming Tony’s exhausted body. Standing and bending over for hours upon hours working on tiny electrical connections does a real number on his back, and he’s definitely (sadly) not getting any younger.
“…Just good old-fashioned revenge…”
“I hurt someone.” There’s silence from where Tony’s sitting, and Steve clears his throat and continues. “My— my friend. I said some things I shouldn't have, and didn’t say some things I should have, and I hurt him.” Steve’s throat closes up suddenly and it fucking
Tony had half-expected the Captain to stay away out of spite, or obstinance (since the spite in their relationship has faded into something not quite so spiteful, maybe wariness, or guardedness), but he supposes even he can be wrong. Sometimes. Rarely, but anything can happen, really.
Partway through his ministrations Tony's grumbling has quieted down, and they sit in companionable silence as he finishes his work. There's a moment when he's done where he doesn't let go of Steve's hand, and he runs a thumb softly over Steve's wrapped knuckles, staring down at their hands like he's puzzling over some thought. Then he looks up and their eyes lock and there's so much swirling in their brown depths that Steve's nearly overwhelmed, he's lost and he's drowning but it's okay because it's Tony, and Tony would never let him drown. Tony has always had his back, even when they're fighting Tony would never let him fall.
“Tony,” Tony interrupts. He has no idea why he says it, but there it is.
He’s alive.
It's a short ride later and they're all boarding the plane, bags thrown over their shoulders despite Happy's insistence they let him do it. Tony obligingly lets the chauffeur carry his bag and suitcase armor onto the plane after him, and then Happy wishes them all a good flight and safe mission, and the engines fire up and they're on their way.
“Almost all clear, Cap, Widow and Hawkeye are on their way down to take out the rest, and we’ll be home before you know it.”
Tony finally finds his voice. “Are you calling me just to break up with me again? Because I can do without it, you know.” His voice is tight, he’s sure Steve can hear it.
“Alright, old timer, you win.” He grabs Steve’s hand and allows himself to be pulled up and almost stumbles. He hasn’t realized how tired he is. Steve steadies him before letting go.
He opens his eyes and looks at the ceiling. Takes a deep breath and rolls over.
Tony rolls his eyes and heaves an exasperated sigh. “Nobody wants to see me, Steve. Besides maybe Rhodey, but that’s different. I’m not an Avenger anymore, and I’m pretty sure they remember why.”
“Tony.” The way he says Tony’s name has Tony’s eyes flooding again and he swipes them away angrily. Steve lets go of Tony’s other hand and reaches up to cup Tony’s face in his big palms, thumbs stroking gently across his cheekbones. “I’m not ashamed of you.” Tony makes a noise and Steve cuts him off. “I’m not. I have my own— issues, I guess,” he smiles, self-deprecating, before he’s serious again and he continues, “and I need to work them out, but it’s not you, Tony, it was never you. I’m so, so
Tony doesn’t hear from Steve for a few days after that, then on Thursday the following week Steve texts him asking if he’s got plans for dinner tomorrow and Tony says no, and Steve says he’ll bring a pizza and Tony better have the final Star Wars movie ready to go when he gets there.
He hadn’t wanted to come tonight, hadn’t felt up for the dancing monkey act, but the Gala was for the Maria Stark Foundation, and he may have changed everything SI stands for in the last few months but the Maria Stark Foundation was one thing he didn’t touch. Also, it’s one of the main reasons he’s here in New York to begin with.
Steve kisses him as Tony’s body adjusts to the intrusion, tongues sliding together, and then he starts rocking gently and sparks light up all along Tony’s body, nerve endings firing off jolts of pleasure as he moves. Tony moans and spreads his legs wider as Steve starts to thrust harder, with purpose.
“Oh, Tony…” Her eyes shimmer for a moment, before she looks down at the stack of papers in her arms. When she looks back up her eyes are clear. Her heels click on the tile as she strides over to Tony’s workbench—the workbench that is littered with red and gold Iron Man parts. Carefully moving some out of the way she sets down the stack of forms and turns to Tony.
His heart is breaking into a thousand sharp pieces and he wants to pretend nothing’s happened, but that’s not him. Tony’s done enough of that for both of them, trying to hold the pieces of them together when they so clearly don’t fit together anymore.
Steve sips his beer in silence, absently watching two men playing darts in the far corner on a dart board that has seen better days. He’s only partially paying attention; seems like the guy with the leather jacket cheated last time they played, and they’re arguing only half-jokingly about how the blonde guy should get a handicap because of it. The rest of his attention is on Tony, who is rocking his tumbler from side to side, watching the amber liquid slosh gently back and forth with dull eyes.
The nurse smiles gently. “Six weeks, Mr. Stark.” Her voice is soft, as if afraid of spooking him. She raises the cup slightly, wordlessly asking if he’s finished, and he nods. Six weeks, he’s been asleep. In a coma. And his friends, his teammates, have been visiting him for those six weeks, and he knows them, knows their names, but he can’t remember knowing them at all. He wonders if he’ll ever remember.
. Steve’s seen him shirtless before, in workouts sometimes, after battles, in the SHIELD locker rooms. Tony had trusted his team, never flaunted his chest full of scars but never hidden it, either. He wonders if Tony would trust him if he knew he was Steve Rogers, his old teammate, the man who lied to him and betrayed his trust. Somehow he doubts it.
“Sir slept for approximately 54 minutes yesterday evening, following 18 hours of working in the lab.” He pauses, then states, “My apologies, sir, but you’ve passed the deadline Miss Potts has established for me to report your sleeping habits to the Nearest Responsible Adult.” The last part of that statement has the air of a direct quote about it, and Tony huffs a sigh through his nose and throws his hands up in surrender, looking up at the ceiling.
Tony turns to a tablet he’s brought with him and begins to work at something that could be Iron Man designs or could be more details for tonight’s mission. Steve doesn’t really want to know either way, he’s already keyed up enough as it is. He decides he needs a distraction and pulls out his sketchpad and a pencil, and before long he’s lost himself in his art. Some time later he comes back to himself to find that he’s filled the page with Bucky Barnes. Bucky from the war, Bucky from their shared apartment together, Bucky on the Cyclone at Coney Island. Bucky falling from the train, reaching for him. Bucky on the bridge, when Steve saw him again for the first time in 70 years.
. Anger, and hurt, and love, and desperation, and jealously.” His face twists up into something ugly, then smooths out again. “I’ve been working on it, and I know you have no reason to trust me, ever again, but…”
He wakes up slowly, senses gradually relaying signals to his sleep-hazy brain. He’s warm, but when he shifts his legs to stretch them out his feet brush across cool blankets. The room is quiet, just the sounds of the air conditioner running and the barely there hum of electronics. There’s a dull rumble of thunder in the distance promising shitty weather for the day, and it kind of fits the mood.
“I love you,” Steve continues. “But he’s—“ he breaks off, struggles to find the words. “It’s hard to explain. I’ve loved him since I was a kid, and then I lost him, and I—“ Steve closes his eyes against the pain that must be visible on Tony’s face. “I’m so sorry, Tony. I can’t lose him again.”
Tony nods into his shirt, unable to speak, hoping Steve understands.
“Steve,” Tony trails off. “I— I don’t deserve this. I hurt you.”
“Really? We’re going to play this game?” Steve just raises his eyebrows and Tony barks out a laugh. “Alright, fine. Hello, I’m Tony Stark, Iron Man. I’m sure you’ve heard about me, read about me, seen me on TV, whatever.”  Steve flushes. Of course he’d recognize Tony even if he was a civilian. Stupid.
And Tony doesn’t know what hit him. The left side of his face explodes with pain and he almost blacks out, sees bright white and black and spots of red. He’s fallen to his knees, one hand holding his body upright, the other clutching at his cheek. It takes a minute for his vision to start to clear, and he sits back on his heels, panting for breath.
The endearment is soft, tender. There’s a soft sigh and then Natasha reaches out and rests a gentle hand on his shoulder, a comforting presence that has Tony’s eyes prickling with heat. He doesn’t want comfort.
“What is your problem, Tony?” He grits out, squeezing Tony’s arm. Tony thinks there might be bruises tomorrow, his grip is so tight.
Steve starts bringing him food regularly, and at first Tony doesn’t quite know what to make of it. He brings sandwiches and pasta and fruit, and then starts bringing different types of juices when he realizes Tony only has coffee and Dr. Pepper and alcohol down in the lab. Steve seems to think Tony consumes too much caffeine, and that something a little more healthy should be introduced into his diet. By the second week, he stops questioning it and just accepts it; at least he’s not getting yelled at.
“Tony.”
Instead he just bows his head, blinking back tears, grateful that he has this, at least. That his best friend is still in there, and remembers him, and seems to be willing to come back home with him.
Tony jumps when Steve’s hand slams onto the coffee table. He looks up to see Steve’s face flushed, muscles in his jaw clenching. “Stop with the pity party, Tony. It happened. You helped fix it and it’s over now. Yes, people died, but they died helping save the world and they knew the risks going into it. You need to learn to let it go.”
He has no idea what Tony expects him to do here.
It’s now or never, so Tony dives in, thrusters firing at full power, hands outstretched. He smashes into the Doombot and carries it with him, over Barnes’s motionless body, and they crash into the wall of a neighboring building, four stories above the ground.
He manages not to break down, just barely, but he can feel Steve’s shirt beneath his face beginning to dampen with his tears. His fists clench in Steve’s shirt and he can’t be bothered to let go.
Steve stands and stretches his body out, spine cracking from being hunched over his drawing pad for so long. He’s just opening an expensive looking wooden cabinet near the exit door when a blonde flight attendant appears next to him.
“Whatever you say, Soldier,” Tony drawls. Steve gives him a look that has Tony snickering under his breath.
“I just wanted to thank you. For the funds, and the information. I know you’ve been helping, and I appreciate it.”
Tony smiles to himself, stepping into the elevator. “Sure thing, Cap," he calls out as the doors slide closed.
Over the team comm, he hears shots, then Natasha’s voice, “Hydra agents eliminated. Hostages secure.”
“Stark, I assume,” he drawls. Tony turns to get a good look at him. He’s decked out in the Winter Soldier gear, minus the creepy mouth cage thing he had going on last year. He’s still wearing that black makeup, and in the reflected light of the river his eyes are striking. Almost as blue as Steve’s, but with his complexion and long dark hair, it’s an arresting sight.
“Why is he here, Steve?” He gestures angrily at Sam, hovering in the background. “Moral support while you break my heart? Someone to reminisce with later about just how pathetic Tony Stark can be?”
It’s a while before either of them speaks again. Tony fiddles with his drink. Steve checks his phone. He’s missed a text.
Tony whistles appreciatively when Steve meets him in the foyer at 8 that evening. Natasha had picked out a dark blue henley (that Steve feels might be one size too small but that Natasha assured him fits him perfectly) with the sleeves pushed up to the elbows, and a pair of dark gray jeans with sleek black shoes. His hair is styled slightly messier than normal, and, as Tony had requested, he’d left the stubble on his face alone.
“Are they here now?”
“Hawkeye, status.” Steve’s voice is clipped. Tony can tell he’s worried and trying not to show it.
In the end it’s hardly a decision at all. Pepper would have hated being an invalid, would have hated having no dignity. Tony keeps telling himself that it’s not Pepper in there, in that body, that it’s just a shell of someone who used to be Pepper, that Pepper’s already dead and gone. It doesn’t make him feel any better.
And then there's Steve. Steve, who hangs out in his lab while Tony works, and sketches and has a sense of humor as dry as the Sahara and pretty much disproves every assumption Tony's ever made about who Captain America is as a person. Steve Rogers is stubborn and funny and clever and artistic, and a lot more little-guy in a big body and a lot less perfect than Tony's late father would have him believe.
Tony rolls his eyes dramatically. His head is starting to throb a little, but he ignores it.
It’s bright. So bright. His eyes slam closed, away from the harsh light, before they flutter open carefully, squinting against the brightness. Things begin to come into focus. A ceiling. Lights in the ceiling. A window, with a chair beneath it. He thinks he’s in a hospital. He’s been in one before, he somehow knows this isn’t his first time, some deep knowledge telling him so.
He slams his palms down onto the table in front of him angrily. “Fuck orders, Steve!” He stomps over to where Steve is standing, gets right in his face, and pokes a finger at Steve’s massive chest. “Your orders were wrong. People were going to die on your fucking orders.” Steve’s eyes flash and he steps forward, uncrossing his arms and grabbing Tony’s wrist, grip tight to the point of pain. He looms over Tony, looks almost scary, though Tony refuses to back down. Not on this.
He’s pathetic, he knows he is, but Tony doesn't care anymore. He cries pitifully and Rhodey rubs his back, up and down, up and down, and there’s not really anything else to say.
“I love you, too,” Tony says quietly. Steve stops for a moment, breath hitching painfully, and nods. And then he’s gone.
One last quick shake of a hand to a man Tony vaguely recalls worked with his father once upon a time, and he’s free, almost stumbling into the elevator. He’d blame it on the alcohol, but he's not that drunk. Kind of eased up on that after he got back from Afghanistan, for reasons.
“Sometimes it is.”
And what’s surprising is that he means it. They don’t have to sleep together. It would be nice, more than nice, spectacular, he’s willing to bet, but it’s not necessary. Tony likes Steve, likes talking to him and joking with him and learning all about him, and if all they did was chat Tony would be happy just to bask in that. He’s missed real companionship.
Steve nods, throat too tight to speak.
“Please, it’s just Steve,” Steve tells his phone, awed, and Tony practically wiggles in delight as Steve starts up a conversation with his favorite AI.
"Tony, sorry," Steve reaches out to steady him and Tony nearly flinches before covering it up with a sardonic smile, lowering his arms. Steve lets his hands fall to his sides, hardly noticing Tony's reaction with thoughts like Bucky and We found him flying through his brain. He wasn't expecting this, had almost given up hope of ever finding him at all.
Tony gives him a watery smile, huffs out a choked laugh. “Yeah?” he asks.
“Don’t lie to me. Don’t tell me you weren't there when he got lonely, and vice versa. Just giving a fellow soldier a helping hand, right? That’s what you guys called it back then, isn’t it? Give him a quick blow job before—“
on you.” There’s a flash of pain on Steve’s face at the words before he’s shaking his head doggedly.
“Definitely not on Google,” Tony finishes for him, eyes creased in mirth. Steve’s missed this, Tony’s smile and his laugh, and he realizes they haven't just talked like this in probably over a year. Long before the Accords came around. Probably even before Ultron.
The elevator dings lightly, announcing their arrival at the penthouse. Without separating Tony backs into the room, pulling Steve with him. They stumble past the kitchen, get partly down the hallway that leads to the bedroom before Tony ends up pressed against the wall. Steve breaks the kiss, taking a step back, and Tony whines in protest. He unhooks Tony’s hands from around his neck and presses them to the wall above his head, stepping back in to press his body flush against Tony’s. The whine turns into a full-throated groan and Tony would need to be a much stronger man to stop himself from arching up desperately, seeking friction.
The moment he steps out of his outrageously expensive Audi he’s engulfed in a bear hug, and Rhodey really does give the best hugs. It’s nice to see him outside of the Tower, away from the concerned face and worried eyes Tony’s so used to seeing on Rhodey lately.
Steve knows of Tony's history, knows that Howard had turned cold and bitter after the war, had been a less than a good father to his prodigy of a son. Howard had not been father material even when Steve knew him, young and brazen and ambitious, and he'd apparently been even less so by the time Tony came around, late in his life and more a necessity to carry on the Stark legacy than a product of love. It's no trouble for Steve to picture Howard, drink ever-present in his hand, towering over his young, inquisitive son, impatient when Tony didn't understand something or pick up ideas fast enough. And later, when a teenage Tony rebelled against authority and an always disappointed father, deepening the rift between them even more.
He wants to strangle him. How can Tony think his life is worth any less than any of theirs? He wants to punch him and hug him at the same time, though he doubts Tony would accept the hug. Tony’s a physical guy, always a hand on the shoulder or a playful shove or a squeeze on the arm, but the second there’s emotion involved he avoids contact like it’s the plague. He’s a man of contradictions, and it drives Steve crazy, but it also makes him want to know more, learn what makes him tick, what makes him smile—the real smile, not the overused Tony Stark publicity grin. He wants to hear that laugh that gets startled out of him, like he doesn’t expect Steve to be funny and is pleasantly surprised when he is. He wants to understand how Tony can be so narcissistic, yet so self-destructive. Love his image but hate himself so much. How he can be so confident on the outside while on the inside he’s just a guy who thinks he’s not worth the effort. Steve wants so badly to understand, so he can show Tony how wrong he is.
“I’m so sorry, Tony,” he hears Steve whisper hoarsely.
Gandalf beats Dumbledore in a magical showdown. You’re out of your mind, Banner, I can’t even handle you right now.”
He hears Steve sigh, sees him get up and walk over to Jamie’s crib, smooth down the little tufts of dark hair on his head. Tony’s heart clenches.
“Is that what this is, Steve? Are you breaking up with me?” Tony means to stay angry, but his voice breaks at the end and his throat is burning. He will not break down in front of Steve and Sam Wilson, and why the fuck is Wilson here anyway?
“Yes, boss,” Friday responds primly.
Rhodey and Pepper are sitting on the loveseat on the far side of the room. Thor is on the floor in front of Natasha, who is carefully braiding his hair into fine little strands. Bruce and Sam are in armchairs, Bruce reading a thick stack of papers with his glasses slipping down his nose and Sam writing in a small book, probably a journal of some kind. Everyone’s eyes are red.
He stares forlornly at her, knowing what she’s asking, knowing his answer here will determine a lot more than paper-signing and possibly sleeping on the couch for a few days. His answer will determine the rest of his life, their life.
“Go back to sleep. We’ve got a couple hours left, I know you need it.”
In no way am I condoning returning to an abusive relationship. I've been there and I'm a thousand times better off for getting away from it, and I'd encourage anyone in that situation to do the same. This story, and the ending in particular, is just my way of expressing that there are a thousand shades of grey in this world, and nothing is ever as black and white as it seems.
“Will that be all, Mr. Stark?”
He pours himself a drink from the bar in the lounge area and rolls his forehead on the smooth wood. Thunks it a few times, for good measure.
He opens his arms.
Steve chuckles lightly. He gulps down the last of his own coffee before tossing his cup into the next trash can they pass.
"Yes. Maybe. I don't know, we haven't really talked about it." Steve looks up. "Is that a problem?" He says it almost challengingly, then chastises himself. He's lashing out because he's scared, and he's pretty sure that's the last thing any of them needs right now.
Tony asks a few questions here and there, and he lets Steve ramble on about the Eiffel Tower (which he’s never actually seen), about Germany and some of the people he met in a pub there (Tony doesn't need to know he met them in 1944 and they most likely died in a bombing raid the following week). He’s got his chin in his hand, elbow resting on the bartop, and he’s smiling while Steve talks, and Steve’s never known the man to be so quiet, such a good listener, and then he wants to hit himself because he never actually gave Tony the chance to listen, did he.
The doors close and he takes a deep breath, leaning against the metal railing spanning the mirrored back wall, closing his eyes.
Tony takes them to the left, up a small set of stairs to a raised corner area on the ground floor that is roped off from the rest. Of course, even when he doesn’t want to be recognized, Tony gets them VIP access, Steve thinks.
“If you hadn’t left them this long there wouldn’t be so many, so don’t start complaining, you did this to yourself.”
Steve lost his scarf and jacket somewhere between the kitchen and the hallway so Tony gets to work on his shirt, rucking it up to expose an insane set of abs and probably the most mouth-watering pecs he’s ever seen. Steve helps, pulling it over his head and off, and then they’re finally pressed together again, skin to skin, and their mouths meet eagerly somewhere in the middle.
Bruce immediately turns Tony's head to the side and blood leaks out the corner of his mouth onto the dusty ground. He coughs and groans in pain and Steve feels so helpless, looks up to Bruce for help, and Bruce just stares grimly back, visibly struggling to keep calm.
Even better, it's Steve. Dorky, artsy Steve who still prefers pencil and paper to any kind of computer or tablet, Steve who brings him sandwiches and juice, who gets up at 5 AM to run and workout and then make breakfast for their team, who tucks Tony into bed when he works himself to exhaustion in the lab. Steve, with his wicked sense of humor and drop-dead gorgeous smile and his utter determination to always do the right thing, even if it's hard, even if they disagree.
you, out of anger, and I need to own up to it.”
remembered when he can’t sleep at night. But he bites his tongue, bites back all the words Steve Rogers wants to say, and Tony continues.
“So, Steve Rogers, no parties to bring in the New Year? Champagne flowing, confetti streaming, Auld Lang Syne-ing, and all that jazz?” He glances over to see Steve’s brow furrowed slightly.
Blinking a few times, he probes blindly at his face with his fingers. “Ow,” he mumbles. It doesn’t feel broken, thank god, but it’s already swelled up, and Tony’s sure he’s going to have a black eye tomorrow. He must have bitten his lip pretty good, too, because he can taste blood. How the hell’s he going to hide this from the Board, from Pepper?
There’s a little arrow on the bottom of the page, and Tony turns it over.
Tony blinks uncomprehendingly. “What?” he asks. That makes no sense. Tony and Bruce were in the lab all morning. JARVIS wouldn’t lie.
He drags the Captain into the elevator, babbling all the while. “—and I was thinking we needed a HQ anyway, and now that SHIELD’s gone it’s even more necessary, good thing I planned ahead. Genius, and all that. Anyway, Bruce is already all set up here, though he takes off whenever he feels like it so I hardly know where he is half the time. And I’m out more often than not, still picking up the pieces out in California and I’m always out of town on business and it’s really a cool set up, if you think about it—“
“I’ll be back in a little bit, okay?” He says, eyes boring into Steve’s. There’s always so much he wants to say in these moments but his mouth doesn’t never seems to want to cooperate. Steve understands him anyway, wonderful Steve, and he nods, eyes suspiciously shiny. Tony continues, “It’ll be a piece of cake. In and out, and then we can order in and watch Dora the Explorer: Puppies Galore for the thousandth time, alright?” Steve snorts out a little laugh and Tony manages a smile.
He doesn’t say anything, but he can see the answer in those eyes anyway.
Tony lurches forward, wrapping his arms around Steve’s waist, burying his face in the space between Steve’s neck and shoulder. He inhales deeply, trying to settle his emotions, trying to believe this is really happening, Steve isn’t leaving him.
, I was like Rapunzel except with less golden blonde hair and more super cool tech gadgets. Am I right, JARVIS? Tell the kid.”
It gives Tony an idea. Once Barnes loses consciousness the arm stops working, no brain impulses to tell it to keep at it. But Tony's got a suit, with a brain of its own-- well, sort of. It's kind of a reckless, self-sacrificing idea, the kind Cap hates, but he’s gotta stop this and it’s the only way he can see to do that. He switches his comm off, speaking directly to JARVIS.
He uses the crack as a guideline, keeps his eyes from straying any further along the wall. He’s gotten to know the wall pretty well; the hairline crack, the dark blue/denim/whatever the fuck color Pepper decided on when the place was built, the crown moulding, the bathroom door with the shiny silver handle. He’s only had 48 hours to get to know it all, after all.
“No,” Steve says shortly. He glares down at Tony. Tony shrugs.
The waitress finally takes their order and heads back to the kitchen and Tony pulls out his cellphone. He’s got three missed calls from Pepper and two texts informing him that he had better be at the first shareholder’s meeting of the year tomorrow morning or she’s quitting. Tony snorts at that, she’d never leave him, not with all the shoes he buys her, and shoots off a quick, smart-ass reply saying he’ll be there, no promises on what state he’ll be in, it’s New Year’s after all. Then he puts the phone on the table in front of him with a flourish.
They turn to walk the last block to Tony’s hotel, Tony leading the way, fingers threaded through Steve’s larger ones. They enter the ritzy building, cross the luxurious lobby, empty like everywhere else so close to midnight on New Year’s Eve. They wait for the elevator, fidgeting nervously, and it arrives with a ding, doors sliding open. As they step into the empty car Tony presses the button for the penthouse, fumbling in his back pocket for his keycard and scanning it before the elevator starts it’s ascent to the top.
Steve huffs a laugh through his nose, petting the back of Tony’s head, smoothing his unruly bedhead down. “You’re such a brat,” he rumbles, throat moving under Tony’s mouth. Tony starts kissing it, following the vibrations when Steve keeps talking. “I made breakfast, there might still be some left if you get up now,” he says. Tony hums, biting at a particularly nice patch of skin. Steve makes a startled noise, then sighs and stretches his neck out, the hand on the back of Tony’s head becoming more possessive, pulling Tony into his body. Tony makes a happy noise and obliges, wriggling and getting more comfortable, one leg thrown over top of Steve’s and lips moving down his neck to mouth at his clavicle.
Tony groans when Steve shoots him a disapproving look. “Look, I had a meeting until 2 and then I came straight here and I’ve been working ever since, don’t give me that look, Steve, I got caught up. Plus, I knew you were coming and you come bearing gifts.” He smiles sweetly but Steve doesn’t buy it.
Tony straightens, and super-soldier and semi-super-soldier may be tall, but they don’t measure up to Tony in the suit.
He thinks he remembers Rhodey visiting him, but it’s a vague, fuzzy thing in his mind. It might have been from before, but he doesn’t think so, because Rhodey’s face is all sad and concerned and he tries to get Tony to eat solid food and drink something that’s not alcohol before he goes.
“Cap, really, I’ve got more than enough room here, I’ve got a Tower, for fuck’s sake. Here, look—“
His phone rings. He picks it up without looking. Very few people know this number.
“Sounds like fun,” he says, and he ignores the little part of his mind that tells him he’s being an idiot, that this is a terrible idea.
Steve reaches up with a stupidly long leg and kicks him in the shin. Tony kicks back, misses, throws a pillow at the other man’s head instead. Steve laughs and bats it away with a lazy hand.
There’s a pause, too long, before JARVIS answers. “Location Unknown.” JARVIS says, voice flat. Tony swears. Someone hacked his fucking system, and he didn’t see it coming. They were sneaky, good enough to get in without him noticing, and now his team was missing, and the last thing they needed in a New York City skyscraper was Bruce hulking out uncontrollably.
There’s a “Yes, mom,” and then quiet, and Steve’s heart feels at once heavier and lighter than it has since he’s woken up in this strange new world.
The doctor nods reassuringly. “That’s not uncommon with head injuries. The memory of the injury itself may or may not return, and that’s completely normal, Mr. Stark,” he says. His tone is almost soothing and Tony wants to bristle, feels like maybe he’s the kind of man who would take offense at being talked down to, but he can’t find it in himself to care.
He’s bending down to pick up Jamie’s nappy when the Avengers alarm begins to blare loudly. Jamie cries out and Steve bolts upright, the small blanket clutched tightly in his hand, mouth a thin line.
He leaves without waiting for an answer, patting Tony on the leg like a child on his way by. Tony shudders violently at the touch, nearly biting his tongue.
“I had a concussion?”
The compound is too far. Tony has a driver pick them up and take them back to the tower. There’s a lot of touching and kissing in the backseat, and when they finally make it up to the penthouse they tumble straight into Tony’s bed.
“Thanks for the drink,” Tony says, and the sound of his voice so close makes something tighten in Steve’s chest. The last time he’d heard it had been in a missile bunker in Siberia, telling him he didn’t deserve the shield.
“Stay?” he asks, pleading. He’s been pretty pathetic tonight but he’s beyond caring now. He’s still not ready to let this go. Not yet. He just wants tonight. If he’s going to die, if he can’t have this for real, he at least wants tonight.
“Get dressed,” he says. His voice comes out rougher than he expected, but he clears his throat and tries again. “We’re going right now, go put some clothes on and tell the team. I’ll be right behind you.” Steve nods and turns around, leaving the room and shutting the door quietly behind him.
Sometimes he feels like he burned a bridge with Tony, that maybe he pushed it just a little too far with some of the things he said. After all, there was no scepter to blame his words on this time, no shell-shock from having just been pulled out of the ice and shoved into a battle situation with little warning. But Tony’s always brushed it off, acted like his retirement from the team was something he’d been planning on doing anyway, and that he and Steve are fine.
Tony waves his apology away impatiently. “Fine, great, you're sorry for hitting me. Apology accepted. What about leaving me? Not talking to me for two weeks? Are you sorry about that, Steve?”
He wakes up the next morning to his phone chiming a text from the nightstand. Fingers clumsy with sleep, he attempts to unlock it, succeeding after a few tries. He finds a message from Pepper, informing him that the SI meeting begins downstairs in half an hour and she expects him to be on time and fully dressed.
“You can’t just— Tony, I hit you! I could have seriously hurt you. It’s not as simple as ‘apology accepted’, here,” he’s saying. He’s getting worked up, Tony can tell. The color is rising to his face and his hands are no longer in his pockets, but clenched at his sides.
He unlocks it, checking his texts. Several from Rhodey, a couple from Pepper reminding him about some meeting tomorrow that he’s got to tell her he won’t be at, and then—
There’s no fuss or fanfare the following morning. Tony is up and getting ready for the conference by 7, dressed impeccably in a three piece suit and sharp red tie. Steve wakes up as he’s slipping his dress shoes on, and Tony tells him there’s coffee in the kitchen and he can let himself out.
“You don’t need to pay for me to be your friend, Tony,” he says indignantly.
“Yes, that will be all, Miss Potts,” he says. He looks back at Pepper, at the woman who’s been by his side for so many years, one of the only people he really trusts. He thinks he sees pain flash in her eyes for a second before she smiles thinly and turns to the waiting elevator, stepping inside. She keeps her back turned until the doors close.
Steve sits down carefully beside him, gaze cautious as he takes in Tony’s less-than-stellar condition.
They play in companionable silence. Time passes slowly here, in this godforsaken cave in the middle of nowhere. Tony doesn’t know how long he’s been here, a prisoner to a terrorist faction, but he knows Yinsen has been here longer, taken from his family in Gulmira, and he must be dying to get back to them. Tony doesn’t have family, just Pepper and Rhodey and JARVIS, and maybe that says something about his life that his top three most important people are his P.A., the military liaison for Stark Industries, and an AI he created.
Tony closes the distance between them, stopping just inside of Steve’s personal space. Steve’s hands come to rest on his hips lightly and it’s like they belong there. Tony feels a little bit breathless. Jesus, he’s fucking swooning, and he decides that he doesn’t even care, he’s dying and this may make him the most selfish asshole on the face of the planet but he’s going to enjoy the time he has left, and this right here, he wants this for a little while longer.
“Do you know who you are?” the doctor asks carefully.
Steve eventually runs out of things to talk about, doesn't want to lie any more than he already has, and the conversation peters out. Tony’s finished another glass while he’s been talking, and Steve can see he’s starting to get a little drunk. His eyelids are drooping slightly, like he’s tired, and Steve is about to call the bartender over for a glass of water when Tony speaks.
Steve sits up straight and his eyes are sad. “You’re more than that, Tony, and you know it.”
Tony scowls as he strips off his gloves and makes his way over to the lab fridge.
Tony thinks plans are overrated.
“Cap! What can I do for you?”
“Steve,” Steve tells him. Tony’s eyes widen slightly before he throws his head back and laughs loudly.
His eyes close as he dances, movements somehow both sporadic and graceful, and as the lights flash across his face, hat tipped precariously over his forehead, Steve is struck by how beautiful he is. He’s never thought of Tony that way, known objectively that he was attractive, handsome even. But when he looks at him now he’s rendered speechless.
And Steve suddenly goes rigid next to him. Tony looks at him in concern.
“Are you feeling better, Daddy?” Jamie mumbles into his chest. “Uncle Bucky said you were sick.”
Tony and Steve spend the extra time getting to know each other. Tony learns that Steve enlisted way back in 2003, and that he’s a Captain. His specific role in the Army is “Classified” (which really just means a little more work on Tony’s part to figure it out, “Classified” has never stopped him and Jarvis from finding out before), and that he was actually
She scoots closer and proceeds to scoop a spoonful of the broth (he hates post-surgery food, the broths and yogurts and jellos, everything bland and tasteless) and gives him a look that says "try to argue and I'll remove an intimate part of your body with this plastic spoon". He shudders and goes with it, opening his mouth.
“I’ll be back at five o’clock sharp to pick these up, don’t make me have JARVIS lock you out of the lab until you sign them,” she says as she click-clacks back to the elevator, pressing the call button with perfectly manicured fingers.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Go back to sleep, he says,” Tony mumbles. “I won’t wake you by sucking your face off again, he says.”
“Tony. Tony, can you hear me? Tony, please answer me. Please.” It’s Steve’s voice. Tony’s missed his voice. He wonders how long he’s been asleep. Where is he?
He doesn’t hold it in this time. “Come back,” he says, voice husky with sleep. “Please. Come back to me."
“You need to decide what she would have wanted,” Rhodey says. “You need to decide soon.” Tony remembers the doctors saying she can’t breathe without a ventilator right now, and thinks how easy it would be to take a life so precious. Rhodey takes a slow breath, then says quietly, “For what it’s worth, I don’t think she would have wanted this.”
“Kotyonok.”
“Where’ve you been?” Tony asks, and Steve tells him France, Germany, Italy, Switzerland, England. All the places World War II and the Howling Commandos took him. He stretches the truth a bit, tells him he backpacked after college for a year, hitchhiked and stayed in hostels and all the things kids do now before they settle down with a job and a wife and kids. Tony nods like he’s interested, and maybe he is. Maybe he wants to know Steve’s mostly-fabricated story. Or maybe he just needs a distraction from his own life, from the Accords and Pepper and his team split down the middle while he tries to clean up the mess left behind from the last six months.
“You do realize you missed a pretty stellar opportunity last night, don’t you?” Tony asks, voice quiet. The confusion must show clearly on Steve’s face because Tony continues in the same flat tone. “Drunk billionaire practically begging for it, you could have done whatever you wanted to me. Kidnapped me, fucked me, robbed me blind.”
“I’m sorry—“ Steve starts, but Tony cuts him off, hand slashing through the air.
“You can’t hide things from me, Tony. I know you,” he mumbles, almost groaning the last.
“Virginia,” Steve says. It’s not a lie. Not exactly. Steve lived in DC for a while, which is close enough to Virginia. Tony didn’t ask where he was born, after all.
Time passes slowly. It’s two whole days before Tony can bother to drag himself out of the workshop, and then he only showers and collapses into his bed that, despite how long it’s been since Steve’s actually slept in it, still reminds him of everything he’s lost. He dreams of Steve leaving him over and over.
“I need you to sign these before the end of the day.”
Tony sees Steve swing his shield and take off the head of one bot, do a backflip over a second and then proceed to kick it’s chest plate in, sparks flying. When he responds to Clint he’s not even out of breath. Tony hates him a little.
“I’m a cancer,” he says.
“Wanna get out of here, Steve from Virginia?” he asks, and he holds his hand out like he’s asking Steve for a dance.
“As for you helping now…” he pauses, eyes dropping to the floor between his feet. Tony raises his eyebrows, curious. “Well, if you’re up for it, I mean, if you don’t mind… I’d just like to keep an eye on him. On Bucky. I’m done chasing him. He will come back when—if—he wants to. And I have to respect his choice. But, I’d like to know that he’s okay. If you can do that.” The Captain looks up again and catches Tony’s eyes, and Tony’s at a loss for words for a moment.
“Oh yeah?” Steve says, keeping his voice light. Tony nods once, head flopping heavily down then back into the pillow.
The rest of his life. Tony’s pretty okay with that.
He's swimming in blackness, thick and swirling around him, colors blending like oils pressing down heavily on his mind. There are noises, soft and rhythmic, sounds that lull him back under the waves, beeping and humming and murmuring. He drifts for a while, not quite conscious, until his brain identifies the source of the murmuring. Someone is talking to him softly, has been for a while now. He tries to pull himself out of the murky darkness, but the closer the voice gets the more pain he feels radiating throughout his body. There's something in his mouth, choking him and he starts to panic, and then the voice is shushing him and there are hands grabbing his and pulling them away from his face, and then all his energy saps away and he's so tired and the current pulls him back under.
“Tony, stop it, you’re being ridiculous.”
He strides over to the private elevator and the doors slide open soundlessly. As JARVIS whisks him up from the basement depths of Stark Tower, he brainstorms furiously. He had a plan for the day the Captain showed up on his doorstep, but it seems silly and inadequate now and like he’s trying too hard (he’s not, he’s got nothing to prove), so he’s got to come up with something entirely different from the original red, white, and blue confetti and ‘Here, I built you an apartment in my Tower!’ idea.
Tony remembers what he was trying to say, why on earth he told Steve to stop. “Nothing, nothing’s wrong, I just want you to know I’m not with Pepper anymore, I don’t want you to think we’re, I’m, cheating. We broke up. Months ago.”
Tony turns to the leader bot, hovering in front of it. It seems to understand that something is happening, because all of a sudden the sounds of fighting and explosions behind him stops, and he knows the thing is calling all the remaining bots here.
“He’s not at the compound currently, but I will forward the message to his phone.”
Tony’s about to ask him what he wants from him, specifically, when Rogers beats him to the punch. The Captain looks up and pins him against the couch with his startlingly blue eyes.
towel, of
Tony groans. “Oh my god Steve, let it go. You sound like Pepper right now.”
Tony curls into him and Steve’s heart aches, eyes burning with the terrible emotions churning inside him, regret and guilt and love. He kisses Tony’s forehead, lets his lips linger perhaps longer than is necessary, lets himself indulge, just for tonight. Tony sighs and relaxes into sleep, and Steve lies awake and holds him for a long time after.
Tony talks over him. “—what really bothers me is that you dropped off the face of the earth afterwards, like it’s totally acceptable to not speak to me for two weeks after something like that.”
When Tony squeezes weakly back he almost loses it, choking out a laugh that sounds perilously close to a sob. “Tony, oh my god, thank god.” He's muttering Tony's name helplessly when Tony cries out, trying to sit up. Steve firmly pushes him back down, tells him to stop, then calls out to the EMTs for some kind of drugs to numb the pain.
“How long have I been here?” he asks, almost afraid of the answer.
Tony snorts. “Yeah, I’m pretty familiar with Afghanistan myself,” he says darkly. Tony can see Steve glance at him cautiously out of the corner of his eye.
“What part of “there was no time” are you not getting here, Stars ’n Stripes? There. Was. No. Time.” Tony makes sure to enunciate, just in case Cap didn’t catch it the first five times he said it. “It was take out the baddie when I had a clear opening, or wait and let him kill another dozen people until you all could get your asses in gear and help me out. Sorry, but I went with Option A.” Tony stands and pushes his chair back, ready to go. He knows he's not being fair, they got there as soon as they could, but he’s had about enough of this shit, and if Steve expects him to sit there and watch civilians die when he’s able to do something about it, he’s going to be waiting a long time.
Tony nods slowly, turning it all over in his mind. He fell, and got a concussion. It might explain the memory loss. He figures he should mention it.
“Come up to my room with me?” he asks softly. He realizes how that sounds, isn't sure he
He looks up when the door swishes open and he freezes, hands stilling on the red and gold faceplate.
And again, Steve bites his tongue. Friends didn’t keep secrets like this. Friends didn’t keep secrets from each other, like the truth about their parents’ deaths.
She grins. “Great, actually. Some of us are going out for drinks in about half an hour, would you maybe want to join us? Just a group of friends, nothing special, no hidden agendas,” she adds hurriedly, when Steve opens his mouth to decline.
He attempts a rueful smirk, but he can feel it fall flat. He’s got no defense mechanisms here, no snark to protect him, because every reason he thought he had for doing what he did is useless, he doesn’t have an excuse. He was wrong, so very wrong.
“Tony Stark has a lot of other things to worry about right now, Captain,” Tony bites off.
A little chuckle escapes Steve and Tony glares petulantly, caught.
He takes his hot shower, spends most of it curled up on the floor like a pathetic teenager, trying to avoid feeling anything. If he lets himself think on it, he’ll lose it, he really will, because he gets that people cheat, he’s cheated before (he’s not proud of it), but he really fucking liked Steve, probably loved him, and Barnes was able to waltz right in and take him, take him
Tonight though, tonight he’s had enough of the game. He’s been playing it all his life, and brilliant though he may be at it, it tests his patience sometimes. Especially now, after everything, he sees these skeevy, conniving businessmen with their bought dates and it reminds him too much of the fact that that was him, less than a year ago, drinking with people he detests, laughing at jokes that aren’t funny, all in the name of a couple million.
His throat tightens painfully and his hands clench in the sheets, so that he doesn’t do what he really wants to do and grab Steve and pull him in, crush him to his own body like he can protect the other man from his mistakes. He doesn’t deserve that anymore. He’s not sure if he ever did.
He has a sense that something is different, now, and that’s why he’s aware he’s here. If he could describe it, he would say he’s less unconscious and more sleeping, now, and maybe he can push through the depths and find the surface if he wanted to.
“Then what do you say we walk together,” Tony suggests cheerfully. So what that he’d been walking in the first place because he wanted to be alone. He can make an exception. “Safety in numbers, right?”
“No, Rogers, I’m just that much of a dick. Yes, I mean it,” he says, rolling his eyes. Steve laughs happily and lifts him up, literally spins him around once before setting him back down and kissing him breathless. Tony feels like his life is a movie right now, a fucking chick flick and he hates chick flicks but maybe it’s okay if his life is one, because he’s deliriously happy and Steve is too and he’s totally okay with this, so he’ll take the chick flick, no problem.
Tony sighs again and slumps back down in his chair, setting his battery back down beside him. “How do you stand it? Being locked down here like an animal.”
The guy is gorgeous, Tony observes, seeing him head on for the first time. He’s got a strong jaw, a prominent nose that still somehow fits perfectly in his face. His eyes are startlingly blue, brought into sharp relief by the blue shirt, and his hair is just long enough for his bangs to fall messily over his forehead while still managing to be completely endearing.
“If I may remind you, sir, I may only follow protocols that you approve of.”
Tony doesn’t even realize he falls asleep until he wakes up to Steve placing him gently in his own bed. He honestly doesn’t remember the last time he slept in the penthouse. He forgot how comfortable his bed is. He groans and flops his head to the side, eyes squinting open.
He struts into the more well-lit portion of the room, approaching Tony and Yinsen, and Tony doesn’t know if he’s ever felt this level of hatred before in his life. Then the man holds the head up, because that’s what it is, a severed head, and he’s holding it by the straps of a military desert camouflage helmet, and it’s a black man, and then it all pieces together and it’s like Tony’s been hit in the chest with one of his Jericho missiles because he can’t take a breath, his vision is spotting black, it’s Rhodey, it’s Rhodey’s head. Rhodey had come to rescue him and the Ten Rings had killed him and his unit and that’s what the explosions were, it was a rescue attempt. Rhodey died trying to save Tony. Rhodey’s dead, and the bastard in front of him is holding his dismembered head and grinning at Tony and Tony makes to leap forward and kill him and one of the other guards smashes a gun into the side of Tony’s temple and Tony blacks out.
“Off,” Tony mumbles, and the spray stops instantly. He opens the shower door and grabs a fluffy towel from a shelf, rubbing his hair vigorously and wrapping the towel around his waist, still mostly dripping all over the tile. He makes an executive decision to forego clothes for the moment.
“Yeah, it’s me,” he hears Steve murmur, sounding far away. Tony feels him taking off his shoes, then his socks. Hears him move around the room, the sound of a glass bring set down on the bedside table. He floats in a space between wakefulness and sleep, feeling removed from everything, from Steve and Pepper and Iron Man and the Avengers and all those fucking feelings. Distantly, the sheets are pulled down under his body and then placed over him, and he’s tucked in, warm and comfortable and two seconds from giving in to unconsciousness completely. A warm hand runs through his hair, and it’s wonderful and he wants to purr and burrow into it. It’s the last thing he feels before the darkness swallows him.
Steve shrugs again. “Thought maybe I’d go to the park, watch the celebrations from there.”
He gives himself two minutes, then splashes some cold water on his foreign face and makes his way back to his barstool. Tony smiles at him, intensity gone from his eyes, leaving behind a man who looks beaten down by the world but who refuses to give in, if only to spite everyone else.
Tony sits up, blanket sliding off his shoulders, forcing Steve to lean back slightly on his heels. Steve starts to pull his hands away but Tony makes a sound, a wait sound, and Steve stills. Tony reaches his hands up to cover Steve’s, looking at him, looking through him, and he must find what he’s looking for because his hands squeeze lightly and then he leans forward, lips capturing Steve’s in a kiss so tender his heart breaks a little.
Tony smiles slightly. “Sure. FRIDAY?”
Steve makes a sound and it wrenches at Tony's chest and suddenly Steve's got Tony's face in his hands and is turning it forcibly towards him.
“Sure. I know Iron Man. And Tony Stark.” He pauses. “I don’t remember being them. Him,” he corrects.
“What do you want from me, Steve?” Tony asks, feeling wretched. He doesn’t know if he’s ever going to be able to be in the same room without wanting him, needing him by his side.
“Can I ask you a serious question?” Steve blurts out before he can stop himself. Tony’s eyes shutter a little bit and Steve wants to kick himself, but it’s too late now.
"Idiot," she says in English. She glares and now Tony has to avert his eyes. So much for bravery, he thinks. He waits but she doesn't say anything else, just picks up her book and settles back into her chair to read.
He wraps himself around Tony’s body afterwards, protecting him from the world, from everything he failed to protect him from before and will fail to protect him from in the future. If this is the only night he has, he is not selfless enough to let it end now.
“Probably,” he sing songs. “Care to join me?” He waggles his glass at Steve’s waist, which has somehow ended up right in Tony’s eye line.
Tony rolls over, expecting to see an empty bed. He’s not wrong. He lets out a slow breath, lets his hand fall to the cool pillow on the bed next to him. Steve is usually up hours before him, so it’s no surprise. Tony remembers how he used to leave little notes,
Tony’s still in his clothes from the bar, watching Steve silently, and his face is contemplative, assessing, calculating. He’s sober now, one hundred percent aware and all of his considerable attention is focused directly on Steve. It’s slightly unnerving. Steve turns toward him.
Sam walks up behind the bag to hold it in place, knowing Steve will have to pull his punches so he doesn’t hurt the other man. Steve snorts, throws a few weak punches, then gives up, moving over the bench to start pulling off his wraps. Sam walks over and picks the spot directly next to him.
he means.
Cap actually quirks a smile at that. He shakes his head, then says, amused, “Thank you, Tony, light of my life, I’d love to live here with the rest of my awesome team of superheroes.”
He does reach out this time, hand grabbing at the fist clenched by Steve’s side. Steve doesn’t pull away, but he doesn’t respond, either, hand still balled tightly underneath Tony’s.
Steve smiles. "Not really, no," he says. "Guess we've kind of switched roles here." He starts to unwrap his hands and he hears Tony hiss in a surprised breath. He glances up and sees Tony's gaze focused on the hand he just finished unwrapping, knuckles bruised and bloody. Tony reaches out and takes Steve hand gently but firmly in his, examining the wounds and wincing in sympathy.
“Yes, but now you’re drinking alone. I feel like that’s a little different, don’t you?” Steve asks pointedly.
Tony grits up just enough dignity to turn his back to them, to Steve, before he covers his face with his hands.
“Fuck you, Tony.”
"Wait, what?" Tony asks, confused and slightly irritated. "You mean I did all that research and surveillance and we fought Doom slash Hydra's fucking Doombot hybrids and I almost fucking died to get you your best friend back and you just let him go?"
Tony shoots him a patented Stark grin and saunters over to the wall-length bar opposite the recessed area Rogers is standing in. “Want something to drink? Oh, right, super serum. Can’t get drunk. But you can still enjoy it, can’t you?” Tony busies himself making a drink. A strong one. There’s something about the other man that sets him on edge, makes him jittery.
, okay? He’s fucking wicked with his dry sense of humor and his sneaky mouth and Tony thought he was in trouble before but he’s fucked now, because he’s head over heels for the guy and there’s nothing he can do about it.
“Who said I’d be alone?” Tony replies, leering suggestively. Steve laughs outright at that and pushes Tony’s shoulder playfully. Tony grins.
"I presume Sir is startled at your vocabulary, Captain Rogers," JARVIS supplies.
“I love you,” he mumbles happily, sweetly, and Tony freezes. Steve must feel Tony’s body go rigid, must rewind and realize what he said, because then he freezes, too. The hand clamped on Tony’s waist tightens, then he puts the spoon down on the counter next to the stove, turns the burners down to low, and grasps the back of Tony’s neck firmly with his now free hand, holding Tony to him. He’s stroking the short hairs at the back of his neck soothingly, and Tony relaxes a little at a time, unable to stay tense under the soft caress.
“So you’d rather be alone in a hotel room for a year?” he asks, voice teasing.
Steve almost can't believe it. They're on their way to Latveria on Tony's private jet, and if all goes well he'll have Bucky back in less than 12 hours. He's antsy, but he forces himself to sit still in his seat and go over plans with the team, blueprints of the abandoned office building Bucky's been hiding out in, maps of the city, escape routes, backup plans, other locations Bucky has used as crash pads in the past. Steve is slightly amazed at how much information Tony's got on Bucky's habits and hideouts, and it's just another surprise in the form of Tony Stark, genius billionaire playboy philanthropist. Steve tucks it away to analyze another time.
Steve looks at him, eyes sharp, taking everything in. “I didn’t mean to make you upset. I just saw you here and wanted to ask how you were doing.”
Steve shakes himself out of his melancholy when he hears an argument at the other end of the bar. Leaning forward in his seat he watches as the bartender speaks sternly to a man in German, gesturing angrily at the cigar hanging out of his mouth. The man snorts, says a few heated words back that Steve probably knows but doesn’t bother translating in his head, then removes his cigar, blows the smoke out almost violently, slams back the rest of his drink, and stalks out of the bar. Steve assumes his tab is already paid because the bartender doesn't chase after him, just shakes his head sullenly and mutters under his breath.
There is no up or down, no left or right or backward or forward. Just the heavy blankness of thoughtlessness, and he thinks that maybe he’s asleep, but he feels aware in a way that’s either one of those very vivid dreams, or he’s in some kind of coma. He doesn’t know how he knows he’s a he, but it feels right. Feels like maybe he’s a person, has a past of some kind. Maybe this darkness is purgatory, and he’s waiting for judgement for his sins.
“Hey, Tony, I’ve been thinking.” Tony hmms, pulling his fingers gently through the blonde strands. “Why don’t you come visit me sometime? I always come here, maybe you could come up and visit every once in a while?”
He gasps, “Bed,” against Steve’s lips and feels him nod, and before he can even move to get up Steve’s standing, lifting his body up completely. Tony gasps and clamps his legs around Steve’s waist as Steve strides effortlessly toward the elevator, and thank god for fucking FRIDAY, the doors are open and the elevator’s waiting to take them up to the penthouse.
Tony grins. “A Yank! And I thought this was a local hangout. The Google lies,” he says with a smirk. “Where are you from, my delightful new friend?”
He leans sideways on his stool, shoulder bumping gently into Steve’s. “Cheer up,” he says, slurring slightly. “From what I hear nobody’s locked up anymore.”
“Very good, sir.”
Footsteps cross the hardwood floor and walk around to his side of the bed. The ridiculously large,
He’s dreaming of lightning, shocks spreading through his body, dancing along his limbs. Blue-white light flashes behind his eyelids, and it’s cold and sharp, but it warms his body, almost uncomfortably warm. It’s gone, and he’s drifting back into the soothing blackness when it comes again, arcing through him. He wakes this time, and feels pain everywhere, and he gasps in a breath of cold night air, almost chokes on wetness in his throat.
Tony’s shocked, completely thrown, has no idea where it comes from, and it hurts. It must show on his face because Steve apologizes immediately and blames it on work, on the new team not coming together as well as he’d like them to, the stress is just getting to him.
Its not like Steve's never seen someone die before. He was a soldier in World War II after all, he's seen men shot in the head without time to even shout a warning, he's seen soldiers step on grenades that take the entire bottom half of their body off. He knows death intimately. It haunts his dreams, dogs his footsteps constantly, insinuates itself into his thoughts to the point where when he first meets people he wonders how they're going to die, and if he'll be around to see it and mourn.
“You’re a brat, JARVIS. I ever tell you that?”
He almost tells him to bring food, like old times, but he’s not sure what to expect. If it is a breakup, Tony just wants him to get it over with, in and out and Tony can get back to living his pathetic fucking life without Steve. So he leaves it short and simple.
“Army, huh?” Tony asks, and Steve nods. “Where are you based?”
"If you're riding along with the medical team, you better get on board, sir," a young EMT with a strong Romanian accent interrupts. "Sirs," he corrects, glancing nervously at Bucky. Bucky says nothing, just squeezes Steve's shoulder once and lets go, turning toward the helicopter. Steve thanks the man and hustles after him.
The three of them make short work of the remaining half dozen bots, and then it’s quiet except for their heavy breathing. Surprisingly, Barnes speaks first.
"You almost died Tony." Tony opens his mouth to say this isn't the first time, but Rhodey cuts him off. "No, Tony, no jokes. Steve had to call us and tell us to fly over, that you might not make it through the night. He was a wreck. Your team probably hasn't slept since you got here. What were you thinking?" He says the last almost angrily, hand clenching on Tony's shoulder. Tony doesn't complain.
“Really? Had you pegged for a Cap fan,” he responds. Steve shrugs.
The drinks go down easier and faster than Steve expected them to. It’s been a long time since he was able to let loose, like he’s just another guy in a club looking for a good time. Tony’s loose, soft looking, laughing easily when he leans across to talk to Steve about something or other. Steve’s having a decent time himself. He’s surprised to find that it’s been over fifteen minutes since he last checked the exits, and while part of him worries that he’s letting his guard down too much, another part of him tells him to shut up, stop worrying, and have some fun.
Tony makes a sound in his throat, and it’s not pretty, but Steve seems to understand, because he squeezes Tony’s hand and continues talking.
“Tony, I need you to understand, this wasn’t your fault. Okay?” Tony says nothing, and Steve sighs before he continues. “We were called away on a mission, the Avengers were, and JARVIS told us you were unavailable. That you would catch up to us, and that Bruce was out of town. So we went.”
Tony sits up and pours himself a drink with a heavy hand, then pours Steve a smaller one. Steve’s about to tell him not to waste his money when Tony pulls a flask out from an inside pocket of his flashy blazer and tops off the drink with a clear liquid before handing it to Steve with a wink.
In lieu of answering, Tony reaches an arm out to the side, knocking things blindly off the bedside table before he manages to fumble the drawer open. He finds the lube and a condom and presses them into Steve’s hand, says breathlessly, “I want you inside me.” He feels Steve’s cock twitch and smirks, and Steve bends down to bite his collarbone in reprimand. Tony yelps and smacks his arm, but Steve just chuckles and kisses the reddened spot tenderly.
“Iron Man, you had orders. Stand down. Wait for backup,” Steve says, tone low and dangerous, command in his voice and body. His arms are folded across his chest, muscles tense, and he looks every inch the Captain America from the comics Tony grew up idolizing. Tony's urge to punch him multiplies.
More money changes hands as Tony talks their way to the front of the line and past the bouncer, and as they walk into the club, nobody stops them to ask for a picture, so Steve guesses they’ve done at least a half-decent job at disguising themselves. Once they get inside, he decides they should be safe from being recognized for the rest of the night, with the lighting in the place dim as it is.
"Wouldn't you, though?" He doesn't know why he says it. He wants to take it back as soon as he does at the look on Steve's face. He back pedals. "Sorry, I'm sorry, I know you wouldn't, I'm being stupid, ignore me--" Steve interrupts him softly.
All of the little details Tony couldn’t see on the surveillance footage in his lab jump out at him now: the bags under his eyes, the shaggy hair sadly in need of a trim (strange on such a put-together guy like Captain America—Tony can’t think of a time the Captain hadn’t had that ruler straight part and perfectly combed hair, even in the middle of a battle), the defeated posture and tired slope of his (insanely) wide shoulders.
Sam tells him that Steve is seeing a shrink now, trying to get his head together. He says that the stress of the last couple of years since the defrost had been hard on him, and that dealing with Bucky has just exacerbated that. That they’ve diagnosed Steve with PTSD and anger management issues, and Tony could have told them that instead of them paying for a SHIELD psychiatrist to do it, but whatever, it’s not his problem anymore.
“I love you, Tony. I want to be with you. I know you’re not perfect, neither am I. But I want to work on it, with you.” Tony’s shaking now, gripping Steve’s hand so tightly his knuckles ache. He clears his throat before he replies.
“Let him in, JARVIS. Send him to the penthouse.”
He’s lost his breath before, probably more times than any one normal person should be able to say. But he isn’t normal, he never has been.
It’s past midnight when Tony decides he wants to dance. He stands and pulls at Steve’s arm, and Steve laughs and bats him away. “You go! Go have fun. I’ll hold down the fort,” Steve tells him, and Tony throws his hands up exaggeratedly and heads out toward the dance floor, pulling his hat low over his eyes.
It’s sweet, so fucking sweet, like they’ve been waiting 70 years for it, and Tony feels so fucking out of place, like he’s the one on the outside, like he’s been the one cheating with Steve this whole time, because holy shit, that right there, Tony will never have that with Steve. It’s one kiss, and it’s already more than Tony’s ever had.
Tony thumbs through the newspapers lying on the countertop for the customer’s perusal, feeling old-school for once instead of pulling out his StarkPhone to browse the news highlights, but he doesn’t find what he’s looking for.
Steve’s face has fallen again, dismayed. “Tony, I’m not ashamed to be with you.”
Steve orders a bourbon and the bartender doesn't charge him for it.
“It’s Barnes, isn’t it?” he croaks out.
, Steve. I got to sit here and wonder until Rhodey thought it might be a good idea to let me know. I hope your little time out worked out
He’d known it was coming, but it doesn’t stop Tony from jumping almost out of his skin when the bedroom door slams back against the wall, leaving a dent where the doorknob sinks into the plaster.
Loud, clunking steps this time, and Tony knows they’ve sent in the big gun. Too bad he doesn’t give a fuck.
“We wouldn’t have even been in that situation if it weren’t for me, Steve. We wouldn’t have had to save the world. And how many people suffered before we managed it? How many people died? Piet—“ Tony stumbles on the name, pushes on, “Pietro died, and that was my fault, because he never would have been there had I not done something stupid, again.”
He wonders for a moment if this means he’s forgiven. It can’t be a breakup, (he hopes it’s not a breakup,) because Steve wouldn’t be coming over for movie night if that’s the case. Maybe they’ll just avoid the topic completely and pretend it never happened, and they can go back to weekends at the Tower with no complications.
“How about you don’t tell me how to do my job and I won’t tell you how to do yours,” Tony snaps, eyes still closed. Cap can’t know he’s walked directly into a minefield, but Tony doesn’t apologize. He’s too worked up. It’s the same old argument he has with Pepper every time he’s in the lab for too long, and he doesn’t want to hear it anymore.
It’s different from last night, because Tony’s not drunk and Steve’s a least a little more prepared this time. His arms snake around Tony’s waist, hands crawling up Tony’s back to pull him more closely into his body, and his mouth opens under Tony’s, a heated groan spilling out.
Tony wakes up to a bed as empty as his heart. He stares at the ceiling, feeling that familiar ache in his chest, except this time it’s not from the arc reactor.
Steve snorts. “I think you actually are,” he responds, amused despite himself, and Tony kicks him again. Steve catches his foot in his hands and unties his shoelaces before removing the shoe and sock completely. He moves on to the other foot, glancing up at Tony as he does. He’s still watching from under heavily-lidded eyes and Steve feels a flare of heat deep in his belly.
The waiting still drives him crazy.
“He needs you,” Bucky says quietly behind him.
The nurse jumps, startled. “Oh! Of course, Mr. Stark.” She bustles around to the end of the bed where a table sits with a pitcher of water and a glass. She pours him one and puts a purple straw in it, bringing it around to the side of his bed. He reaches up to hold it but his hands are shaking with weakness and the nurse has to help him keep it steady.
A half dozen guards file in the door and Raza enters after them, smile glinting malevolently in the dim light of the cave. There’s something swinging from his grip, something that looks disturbingly familiar.
Tony’s always been a man of many words, blithe words that flow out of him effortlessly, but Steve Rogers has a way of making him lose them all when he needs them most. He can’t speak, doesn’t even know what he would say if he were able to, so he just nods dumbly. Steve smiles so beautifully it lights up Tony’s soul, filling all of the cracks he’s gained over a lifetime and over the last year, and he reaches up to cup Tony’s cheeks, swipe under Tony’s eyes with his thumbs, pushing away tears Tony didn’t even know he’d shed, before he leans forward to capture Tony’s lips in a soft, perfect kiss.
His feet stop just in front of Tony, but he doesn’t say anything. Tony looks up, slowly, afraid of what he’s going to see in Steve’s face. Anger. Disappointment. Betrayal. Their eyes meet and it’s worse than that. Steve’s eyebrows are pinched together, that small wrinkle dug deep between them, and he looks back at Tony with so much hurt in his gaze that Tony feels it like a punch to the chest.
Tony waves at him indifferently as he pours out another drink for himself and fresh one for his guest. He recaps the decanter and walks across the room, sitting on the adjacent love seat and sliding the Captain’s drink across the table toward him. Rogers catches it with a large hand and makes no move to drink from it. Tony has no such qualms and takes a large sip, feeling it settle along with the first glass to warm his stomach.
He gradually makes his way to quieter, less crowded neighborhoods (or as quiet as a New York neighborhood can really get on New Years Eve), and he lets out a deep sigh of relief. This was a good idea, walking back. He’s felt so confined lately, almost claustrophobic, and it seems like he’s never alone anymore unless he initiates the lock down protocol in the workshop. Pepper’s always hovering, and Happy, and Phil Coulson stops by the Malibu house like he owns it at least once a week to ask pointed questions about the Iron Man suit. And there’s security, and SI people, and hell, even Rhodey calling him every few days to check up on him. He needs a damn break from the babysitting, from Tony Stark’s life.
What Steve wouldn’t give for some good old-fashioned revenge right now. He didn’t—doesn’t— know Stark that well, but the man is part of his team, and beneath all of the bullshit and bluster he’s a good man, he proved that when he rode that missile into outer space. And maybe, just maybe, Steve feels an attachment to him, because he’s a link to Steve’s past, when everything else is dead and gone, or fading, like he should have faded. But fate had other plans, and he’s not gone but here, and Stark is his anchor, in a way, though he hardly knows him, and they don’t even particularly like each other.
They’re just not partners anymore.
Doombots had come flying in from all sides, shooting lasers (lasers, of all things) in every direction, taking out windows and walls and superheroes alike. Bucky had taken off, fleeing the fight or heading towards it Tony didn't know, and Steve had taken off after him, and now here they are on the outskirts of a shit town in Latveria, with Hydra-enhanced-Doombots doing their damnedest to take them all out. Tony’s not sure if they’re after the Avengers, Steve specifically (they’re always after Steve), or the Winter Soldier (who's been taking out Hydra bases one by one since the end of the SHIELD fiasco), but now they’re all here and they’re all under attack, and Hydra and Dr. Doom have apparently decided they have a common enemy (enemies?), and now they’re in this shitstorm.
“Sorry, Steve. Sorry. I’m out of practice with this. Waking up with strangers in my room,” he elaborates. His eyes slide away self-consciously. “I’ve got some trust issues, to put it lightly.” He squeezes Steve’s bicep before he lets go and steps back, some of his old confidence returning.
"Hey," Tony say softly. "Cap, hey. I didn't. I'm here."
Steve goes back to kissing and sucking his way down Tony’s neck, which Tony is totally okay with, and then he tugs at Tony’s bowtie with his teeth, which Tony is absofuckinglutely one hundred percent okay with as well. Capturing both of Tony’s smaller wrists in one of his enormous hands, he draws the other slowly down Tony’s arm, wrist to elbow to shoulder, drags his fingers teasingly across Tony’s collarbone, yanks gently at his bowtie. It comes undone easily and Steve gets to work unbuttoning Tony’s starched white dress shirt.
It takes him a little while to pull himself together, but Bucky is silent and patient and grieves with him, holding tightly to Tony’s hands through it all. When the tears finally die down he gives Bucky’s hands a squeeze and lets go, pushing himself off the floor and disappearing into the bathroom.
A harsh sob escapes him before he even finishes moving, his entire body shaking, and his eyes blur. The bed is empty.
There are two couches in their little area positioned around a small table, which holds a bucket of ice, two glasses, and what’s probably very expensive scotch.
Steve sighs in defeat but his shoulders relax marginally. Tony smiles at him, pleased. Then he brightens considerably, a playful grin stretching across his face.
, throat tightening, and he has to open his mouth to gasp in a breath of air.
“I never thought I’d get you out here,” he says happily, shooting a mock glare Tony’s way as he lets him back down onto his feet.
“Oh my god, you’re pathetic,” he says, rolling his eyes at Steve's guilt-stricken look. “It’s fine, it’s just a bruise, shut up Steve. God, I take it back, go back to burning with righteous anger, this is pitiful.”
“How you don’t trust me to make the right decision! It’s like the Accords, you won’t open your eyes and see that there’s more than one way to do things here, it’s not all black and white, it’s not you versus me here—“
Tony rolls his eyes. “No need to be so sensitive, Cap. It’s not like anyone could have seen it coming, international intelligence agency crumbling around their ears and all that. I’m pretty sure there are a lot of other former employees out there wallowing over the fact that they no longer have a job, too, and they can’t even list it as a reference, since SHIELD doesn’t exist to most people. Well, didn’t, until Natasha leaked everything. Not that it would be a good idea to list them as a reference now anyway, I don’t think prospective employers will jump for joy at an applicant admitting that they worked for Hydra for the last ten years or so.”
He’s crying before he realizes, sobbing messily with tears running down his face. He feels Steve’s arms go around him, enveloping him, offering comfort that he knows he doesn’t deserve.
“Imagine you’re me. Iron Man, Tony Stark, co-leader of the Avengers, blah blah blah. There’s the aliens in Manhattan, and the thing in DC, and Sokovia, and Nigeria. Regardless of whose fault it is,” he says emphatically, waves his arms through the air as if he could push the blame away completely. “Those tragedies, they cost something. Money, sure. Buildings were torn down. Towns destroyed. Lots of money, mostly straight from my pocket. But more than money, more than that. People
“Why am I even asking you? You don’t know how to have fun.” And it’s like before, when Tony’s jokes were just a little too pointed and Steve took everything just a little too personally, and Steve forgets that he’s supposed to have grown out of this. He takes it as a challenge.
Steve knows Sam means well, but it’s just not something he wants to talk about. He shakes his head and continues punching the heavy bag.
Tony shakes his head. “No, go right ahead,” he says. “I thought you were at a Met’s game with Barnes?”
Tony doesn't know what to think about that, doesn't really care. Just says, “Huh,” then pulls Steve down by the back of his neck to mash their mouths back together.
They finalize their plans and split off to do whatever it is they each do to get in the right frame of mind before a mission. Clint and Natasha sit together near the back of the plane, speaking in soft voices. Bruce sits a short distance from them and begins to meditate, and Thor reclines in his seat, sweeps his cloak over himself, and promptly starts snoring.
“Fuck.” Tony’s heart stops, then starts beating again at a pace that surely isn’t healthy. He fires the thrusters at full power, orders the Avengers back to the Tower in the same breath. It was a distraction, it was all to get to Steve. There’s a chorus of Affirmatives.
“Hey Sharon,” he greets her, hoping he sounds friendly enough. Things between them haven't been strained, exactly, since Germany, but they haven’t been as genial lately either, which Steve blames himself for. He probably shouldn’t have kissed her in the heat of the moment, dealing with the fallout with Tony and his grief over Peggy’s death. Not exactly the best time to start something up with a co-worker.
It's not much, he's still not fully recovered, but it's enough, and he pours everything he's feeling into the kiss, all the doubt and uncertainty and fear and worry and love, yes, love, he loves this big stupid blonde Adonis more than he thought he could love anyone, and it may have started out as resentment slash obsession but it's turned into wanting to know this man inside and out and he couldn't stop falling even if he wanted to.
Steve's in the private garage underneath the tower at 5:15 the next morning. Happy's loading his bag into the trunk and chatting amiably about the lack of traffic and the easy drive to the airport. He seems to have taken a liking to Steve, always smiling and going out of his way to be helpful, and normally Steve would be glad to have someone to talk to but today he's distracted. He'd taken Tony's advice last night and gone to bed early, honestly tried to get some sleep, but his mind was whirling with thoughts about Bucky and Tony and the mission and the rest of the Avengers and everything that could go wrong, and he'd barely managed to get more than an hour's rest.
“Sir, I have been locked out of the saferoom. I have no control over that area of the Tower.” He sounds frightened. It terrifies Tony down to his bones.
Steve smiles as he pulls away and rolls to his feet. He tucks the blanket back around Tony and sits down in his own seat.
Tony shakes his head no. He doesn't feel sick. Just tired, and confused.
And so it goes, Steve arriving on Friday night after team workouts end for the week, and Tony makes a point of telling his secretary not to schedule any shareholder meetings after 2pm on Fridays, and absolutely no weekends unless she wants to find herself another genius billionaire to work for.
“Thanks,” he says, when he can speak.
“Tony, stop. Stop laughing. I can feel you, oh
Steve is shaking his head at him, just smiling, and Tony’s carefree attitude immediately plummets, because it’s been almost a year and Tony is still so fucking in love with this man he wants to scream.
Eventually the quiet must become too much for Tony.
Steve hurt, not being able to fix anything because he can’t.
“Thanks, Capsicle. You’re a regular Wolfgang Puck.”
“You’re a beautiful woman, ma’am, and I’m flattered,” he says, smiling. She takes the hint graciously and smiles back before standing up.
He pads softly into the kitchen and sneaks up behind Steve, who’s at the stove, frying up some potatoes and eggs. He wraps his arms around Steve’s waist, teasing his fingers below the hem of the boxer briefs he’d put on when he’d gotten out of bed. Steve doesn’t jump, super soldier senses and all, but he turns his body and pulls Tony into his chest, still tending to the food with his other hand, nuzzling his nose into Tony’s hair.
“Uh… Thanks?” Steve looks slightly bemused now, and Tony mentally kicks himself. He's talking out loud again—long engineering binges always make him do that. He suspects it's a byproduct of talking to himself and JARVIS for so long.
“I think we should take a break.”
His heart monitor picks up and it must alert someone at the nurse's station, because a nurse comes in almost immediately and starts checking all his readouts, asking how he feels in stilted English.
“Of course sir. You were the image of Rapunzel.”
“Pupils are reactive, no lasting effects from the concussion,” the doctor states to a nurse, who nods and takes notes. He turns back to Tony. “Do you have any pain? A headache, nausea?”
"Tony, it's nothing, honestly. The serum will heal them in a couple of hours. They'll be good as new by tomorrow morning." Tony just shoots a glare back at him and continues dragging Steve down to the medical floor.
Tony thinks about it. Sees the image in his mind again, a flying suit of armor, shining red and gold in the blue sky. Sees Tony Stark, of Stark Industries. Of the Avengers. Sees his teammates, Thor and Bruce and Natasha, Clint, Steve. Bucky Barnes. He shrugs again.
everything used to be, how it will never be again, and he’s back to that stretch of wall, the only thing he can think about without losing whatever’s left of his mind.
FRIDAY computerized voice cuts across the music. “Boss, Steve is here. He’s on his way up to the penthouse now.”
Tony’s all but dragging Bruce across the room behind him, praying Bruce can keep control of the Hulk long enough for them to get out of here safely. He gets to the elevator and pushes the button frantically, but the elevator doesn’t open. “JARVIS!”
He remembers trying to be quiet and failing, stumbling backward, out of the room, and Steve looking up at him, eyes wide with desire or surprise or both, Barnes’s head snapping around to find him and pin him with his penetrating stare. He vaguely remembers the elevator doors opening, thank god for JARVIS, and falling back into the waiting compartment, before the doors shut quietly on both men still staring at him from the kitchen.
How is this guy real? He just walks in here, tired and exhausted from months of living in lovely Eastern European hostels, and he straight up thanks Tony for hardly helping at all (he should have been there, helped his teammate, but who knows how that would have gone between them, and then the Mandarin happened, and Pepper would never have been okay with him jetting off to Europe for a couple months anyway, and he’s just a coward, there’s no excuse). And then he has the guts to ask a guy he’s never liked for a favor he must be sure Tony will deny, and the favor isn’t even to find the guy, it’s just to make sure he’s okay. Like he’s going to respect his best-friend-back-from-the-dead’s space. Like it’ll be enough. And it will, he’s Captain America, he does decent things like respect people’s space, even though he clearly doesn’t want to. What the fuck.
“As you wish, sir.” JARVIS sounds angry, and worried, and Tony ignores it, because this has to happen, and it’s going to work. He’s not going to let his friends go down from a bunch of shit robots that are a travesty to modern technology.
Tony is quiet for a second, then he gives in. He can’t fight anymore. “Fine, Steve. You win. Thanks for the call.”
“Sir, I highly disapprove of this plan of action, it will almost certainly kill you—“
“What the fuck are you doing in my tower?” he snarls. He’s beyond pleasantries and being politically correct. If they want to storm his tower like a fucking battlefield, he’ll treat them like enemies.
He’s turning back to call his suit to him when Steve grabs his arm, halting his progress. He looks back at his husband, with their child in his arms, and Tony suddenly wants to say screw it, let the rest of the Avengers handle it, he’s staying right here with his family.
Tony growls, eyes flashing. “If you say you’re sorry right now, I may throw you out of this airplane.”
It’s been a while, but it feels as amazing as he remembers, the burn and stretch of it, and when Steve’s fully sheathed inside him they both still for a long minute and just breathe.
“Tony, maybe you should sleep it off,” he says kindly, squeezing the other man’s shoulders slightly.
He goes to the common floor, and as he steps out of the elevator he notices that everyone is already there.
Tony smirks. “But you love me,” he teases.
"Like that was even a question," Clint scoffs.
His throat feels tight and he has to blink his eyes several times to clear them. He blames it on the drugs.
It ends up being the second one. They have a wonderful weekend, with only a couple of awkward moments, when Steve mentions something about the team and Tony tenses, waiting for the inevitable “Come back” speech, but it never comes. Tony relaxes as Steve just goes on with his story and it’s not long before they move on to more exciting things, things that may or may not include the dining room table and Tony bent over it moaning out Steve’s name repeatedly.
Tony scowls. “You should be. Guy hasn’t slept in days and he passes out on his plane and you maul him in his sleep?” Steve laughs for real this time. “Shame on you, Cap.”
They end up at an all night diner that is, unsurprisingly, empty. Everyone’s got someplace better to be, even the waitress, apparently, because she has her nose stuck so deep in her phone it takes her a full five minutes to realize she has customers at all.
There’s a sudden flash of light from the windows followed by a large boom, and they both freeze in a panic. It takes a second for Tony to put the pieces together and then he’s laughing. Steve stays frozen, still buried inside him, and is looking at him like he’s crazy. “Tony, what—“
He wears black to the funeral. He’d told Steve once that wearing black to a funeral was stupid, it’s depressing and funerals were supposed to be a celebration of life and he’d want everyone to wear the most garish colors imaginable to his, and toast a glass of champagne (or stupidly expensive bourbon) to him as they lowered him into the ground. Steve had laughed and said of course he did, and smiled that smile of his that made Tony want to swoon like a damsel in some dime-store romance novel, eyes twinkling.
“What’s wrong?” he asks worriedly.
“Hey, Cap,” Tony says, smiling brightly. He hopes it doesn’t come across as false. It’s not, really. Just a little surprised, maybe.
“I get panic attacks sometimes, wake up and think I’m still in that cave. That they’re gonna come in any second and shove my head in a bucket of water, drown me for information.” His shoulders are tense, but it’s almost a relief to say it out loud. Steve just makes a noise in his throat that could be agreement and could be sympathy.
“I know I hurt you, in more ways than one, and I’m sorry for that, more sorry than you’ll ever know. But, if you’ll have me, I want to spend the rest of my life making it up to you. Please.”
Tony gets cruel when he’s angry. He gets sharp and petty and very, very calculating, but he never lets that anger consume him physically. He becomes still and dangerous, a poised weapon ready to strike.
It’s around 3:30 in the morning when Steve gets up to stretch his legs and use the bathroom. His face is itching from wearing the Photostatic Veil for such an extended period of time, so he splashes some cool water on it. He can’t risk removing the disguise, not while he’s so close to Tony, but the water gives him a little bit of relief, at least.
A little sob hiccups out of Tony without warning and Steve’s arms tighten around him, rocking him slightly.
There's a wide swath of bandages around his middle, thickest on his right side, with several more on his chest. He's got a pretty large one on his left thigh as well, and when Tony experimentally tries to move his leg agony spikes from his hip to his toes and spots flood his vision, and he has to take a few deep breaths before he doesn't feel like he's going to puke up the meager contents of his stomach.
Tony doesn’t say a damn thing. Doesn’t think he’s ever been so quiet in his life. Doesn’t think he could speak if he tried, to be honest.
“Pepper, wait,” he finally gets out, desperate.
he stayed away at all.
His eyes have fallen shut but he can still see the strobing lights through his lids, can still feel the music pulsating through his body, their bodies. The kiss goes on for a long time, both men learning each other in ways they never thought possible. Hands explore chests and backs damp with sweat, bodies pressed so closely together Steve doesn’t know where he ends and Tony begins. Tony loses the hat at some point but neither of them cares. Tony’s kissing his ear, his chin, the v of his neck, and Steve throws his head back, eyes still shut tight, reveling in the feel of it. His arms have wound so tightly around Tony’s body he’s slightly worried he may be making it difficult for the other man to breathe, but Tony’s not complaining so he doesn’t let go. He never wants to let go.
“What’s the point of having Tony Stark for a friend if you don’t even let him pay for your food?” Tony quips. Instead of laughing, Steve looks slightly appalled.
Yinsen doesn’t look up from the board game, instead humming and making his next move. “Tony Stark, you have always been a little less than sane,” he murmurs, concentrating.
want it to sound that way, but elaborates regardless. “We don’t have to… I mean, it would just be nice to have the company. So I’m not alone for the rest of the year, and everything. Because that would just be tragic.”
“Tony… Just, please, try not to jump immediately to the sacrificing yourself plan. There’s always another way. We can figure it out, as a team,” he says, voice beseeching.
The main avenue isn’t much better than the party upstairs. People are everywhere, with sparkly hats and party favors and oversized plastic glasses with “2011” superimposed over the eyeholes. Shoving his hands in his pockets and ducking his head, Tony starts to walk, hoping he won’t be recognized. It’s a stupid hope, he’s Tony Stark, for fuck’s sake, and he smiles gamely and shakes peoples hands and signs a few autographs when passersby do inevitably make the connection.
He opens his mouth to ask JARVIS for today’s itinerary when Steve’s voice stops him.
It feels like the bullet hits Tony. He blacks out for a second, but then he’s back, gasping for air, tears streaming down his face, still flying in the suit. His vision is swimming and he isn’t sure he’s actually breathing at all but he has to get to Jamie. He has to. He’s approaching the Tower, a hundred yards, fifty.
He nods and answers just as quietly. “A blanket, please. And maybe a pillow?” He thanks her as she fishes some out of the cabinet and hands them to him.
He smiles, then types a reply.
“Why?” He asks, voice quiet, strong, but overflowing with pain. Tony’s heart clenches. He’d rather Steve get mad, yell at him, throw something, hit him, even, than this. “How? How could you— I don’t understand, Tony. What did I do?” His voice trembles on the last question.
They kiss some more, hot and needy, until Steve’s grinding his hips relentlessly into Tony’s, making little high pitched noises in the back of his throat with each thrust. Tony’s pretty sure Steve’s completely unaware he’s making them at all, which just makes it even more sexy. It crosses his mind that they should probably move this if they don’t intend to end up in a puddle on the hallway floor.
And then Bruce is there, clothes torn and ragged, and Bucky's explaining the situation to him, and he's leaning over Tony and talking to him in a calm voice, and Steve is so grateful he can't even think. Natasha is leaning over to speak to Bruce, telling him there's a chopper on the way, and she glances quickly at Bucky. Steve doesn't know if Bucky will run or if he meant it when he said he was done, but he can't think about that right now. He turns back to Tony, telling him to stay awake, and then Tony's struggling to breathe.
Rhodey shakes his head, runs his hand over his short-cropped hair. He gives a gusty sigh, breath shaking slightly. “No, she’s still in surgery. They were hit head on, a drunk driver, going the wrong way on the highway. They say—“ Rhodey’s voice gives out with a croak. He tries again. “They say Happy was killed on impact. The car rolled, four times. They pulled Pepper out with the Jaws of Life.” Tony has the back of his hand pressed to his mouth, to stop words or whimpering or possibly vomit, he doesn’t know, but he presses it harder and squeezes his eyes closed and feels Rhodey reach out and grab onto his arm, squeezing hard.
Tony is still looking at Bruce, and doesn’t miss it when his eyes go from fearful brown to flashing green, full of rage and hatred. Bruce starts panting, body shaking, and Tony crosses the space between them carefully, grabbing Bruce gently by the hand and pulling him toward the private elevator.
“‘m not that drunk,” Tony slurs, nudging at Steve with a foot when Steve sits on the edge of the bed.
It’s a long time before the tears stop, and when they do Tony stays stubbornly where he is, sniffing loudly. He’s somehow ended up sitting on his knees, face tucked tightly against Steve's chest, all but collapsed into the other man. Steve has one arm wrapped firmly around Tony’s middle, and his other hand is carding gently through his hair. He wants to stay here forever, partly because he's ashamed to show his face, but mostly because being enveloped like this, protected from the world, feels amazing.
“Pep—“
He clambers to his feet, grace and dignity long forgotten. “Steve,” he starts.
,” he reiterates passionately.
“Almost every day, sir.”
His Gucci’s clack across the dark hardwood as he makes his way to the register. The barista is a young black man with kind eyes, and as Tony approaches he greets the billionaire with a smile. There’s a hint of recognition in his eyes, but he doesn’t ask for an autograph or go all googly-eyed, just asks Tony what he can get for him.
"Hulk, I need Bruce here," Steve shouts into his comm, voice on the verge of panic. Some part of his mind is screaming that he's too late, Tony's already dead, but he ignores it and yanks off the faceplate. Tony's face is pale and slack, and there's blood running from a cut somewhere above his hairline. Steve leans forward, checking for exhalations, but there's nothing, no breath stirring against his cheek. His fingers find no pulse, either, just clammy skin. Someone drops down to their knees next to him, and Steve looks over to see Bucky reaching for the armor's releases. He snaps out a hand to grab at his arm.
It’s not that Steve doesn’t like having fun. He does.
“Alright, Tony, let’s get you to bed.” He holds out a hand.
Steve gets him. Steve was his friend first, and maybe it helps that they didn’t get along at the beginning because Steve is definitely aware of his shortcomings and his failures so Tony doesn’t have to pretend to be perfect, or to work to please him. He doesn’t require flowers, and if Tony forgets to call back for a day and a half Steve just rolls his eyes and says, “Hi Tony, finally come up for air?” with a smile in his voice.
Tony takes them into the city. It’s a decently long drive, but time passes relatively quickly. Tony chats incessantly about SI and asks about the team and how training is coming along and they’re bouncing ideas off of each other like no time has passed at all and they’re still living in the tower discussing training tactics and strengths and weakness. Steve’s missed this companionship with Tony, and he thinks maybe Tony missed it too, judging by the way his face lights up as he talks. He’s smiling a lot, and when he’s not Steve can still see it in his eyes, the crows feet at the corners.
“Hey!” he shouts, voice hoarse from disuse. He sits up and attempts to grab the sheets but Bucky stops him, pushes him back to the head of the bed with his metal hand. Tony glares, his temper rising quick and vicious within him. It’s like he’s thawing, a hot shower after a day in the snow, little sparks tingling all over his weary body as it stirs awake again. The anger is refreshing, a break from all of the despair and hopelessness of the last few days.
“Fuck you,” Tony snaps, reaching behind him to place his bare hand comfortingly on Bruce’s chest. “Bruce is no monster, and you’re not getting him. Get the fuck out of my tower.”
“Yes, Pepper,” Steve almost snarls.
“It’s not about not trusting you, Tony! It’s about what’s best for the team, and how—“
The doctor looks exhausted and possibly sad, Tony can’t tell, he just wants the damn man to speak. He looks at Rhodey, then Tony, seems to make a connection, then speaks.
Steve’s back to looking sorrowful. “It’s the right thing to do,” he says. It sounds final and Tony knows it’s over. Nothing he says will keep Steve here, not when he’s made his decision, when he’s decided to do the Right Thing.
“Hey, Steve, everyone’s okay, yeah? We got ‘em, nobody got hurt.”
He doesn’t need Tony buying him exorbitantly priced clothes just so they can go to some fancy nightclub. He has clothes. Natasha had taken him shopping a while back after learning of his limited wardrobe when they were still with SHIELD, when she’d been trying to set him up on blind dates with various co-workers. She was adamant that they “modernize” his style, from his hair to his wardrobe to his footwear.
He wakes up first the next morning, pulling himself out of a sleep so deep and restful he almost doesn’t want to open his eyes. He floats a little bit longer in the area between sleep and wakefulness, not wanting to break the spell. He can feel Tony’s arms wrapped around him from behind, his face pressed into Steve’s shoulder blades, warm breath ghosting over his skin.
-Friedrich Nietzsche
Tony rolls his eyes but takes the rejection in stride, turning and stumbling into the bedroom. He flops onto the bed without removing any clothes and turns his head to the side, eyeing Steve as he follows him into the room.
When Tony comes back to himself, Steve pulls out slowly, tying off the condom and tossing it into the trash bin across the room. Tony hmphs an impressed noise and Steve shrugs, smiling, before he leans over to kiss Tony softly on the mouth. Tony whines when he pulls away, so Steve pecks him on the end of the nose, once on each eyelid, and then again on the mouth, eyes open and gazing into in his, and Tony’s heart clenches in a way that has nothing to do with the failing arc reactor. Eyes flicking between Steve’s, he takes a chance.
“Tony, it’s Bruce.” Bruce. He's missed Bruce, too. “You’ve been injured. We had to take you out of the suit to restart your heart, but now you’re bleeding pretty badly…" There's a pause, the sound of Bruce's voice murmuring to someone, then he's back. "You need to stay awake. Do you hear me? There’s an evac unit on the way, just stay awake.” Tony tries to nod but can’t move his head, or any part of himself, really. He grunts, but that just makes the wetness bubble in his throat and he chokes.
Steve shakes his head. “Too many people,” he says. “Where are you going?” he asks Tony curiously.
They get to the hospital in under 30 minutes and Tony is pushing past the reception desk, ignoring the shouting behind him. He hears Steve talking to the nurses behind the desk and the security guard he brushed off, and for a moment he’s so grateful Steve is here, and then he’s forgetting about Steve completely, rushing down the hallway, skidding around a corner until he sees Rhodey pacing outside the ICU wing.
It’s like nothing he’s ever experienced before, so sweet he aches with it. It’s slow and searching, lips sliding against each other, communicating in a way that spoken words can never seem to articulate. Tony’s tongue touches his bottom lip, asking permission, and Steve’s stomach jumps, lips parting unhesitatingly. Tony’s hands have found their way to his shoulders, are running across his back and neck soothingly, and Steve just wants to stay here forever, lost in this wonderful, complicated man.
Tony doesn't know what to say. He's speechless, which has happened less times than he can count on one hand in his entire life, so he doesn't say anything. He just stares at Steve's beautiful face and reads everything that's there for the taking, and he leans forward and kisses him as passionately as he can.
That’s it, nothing else. No thank you for finding him, possibly saving him, no tearful reunion with Steve, no breakdown, not even a What's the plan now? Just, I’m done, and the damned Winter Soldier stalks by him and heads back toward the main fight. Tony stares at Steve, who is gazing after Barnes, looking both unsurprised and nostalgic by this turn of events. He glances at Tony and shrugs, smiling slightly before jogging after his friend.
They make love.
Tony’s having a fierce internal debate with himself. Should he invite Steve up or not? On one hand, Tony’s at least partially convinced Steve wouldn’t be against the idea. And he seems like the kind of guy who can be discreet, won’t go spreading rumors tomorrow morning or selling a story to the papers. On the other hand…
“No, Steve. I’m not changing my mind on this. I’m not Iron Man anymore, I’m just Tony Stark, billionaire, genius, playboy, philanthropist,” he says wryly.
Tony pauses, eyes narrowing. “What are you here for, Steve?” he asks slowly.
He wakes up to someone shaking him, calling his name. He’s groggy, everything is fuzzy and his mouth is dry, and he’s laying on something cold and hard. It feels like tile, why would he be sleeping on tile, did he fall asleep in the lab again?
Steve’s jaw clenches and Tony’s stomach tightens. He doesn’t want to fight, but Steve needs to understand, he’s not going back there. He doesn’t need to see their pointed looks to know he’s to blame for the last time the world almost blew up.
“Steve,” Tony gasps out. He can’t breathe, his throat is closed up and his chest is being squeezed by bands of iron and he can see the Tower, he’s flying down Park but it’s too late, Steve’s dying in front of his eyes and he’s not even there to save him, to help him.
He could find him. Easily. JARVIS could run a search, see where he’s based, specifically, when he comes back.
He’s pretty sure Steve’s just as gone for him, and while that doesn’t make it any less scary, at least he’s not alone.
Tony snorts. “But it never goes away,” he returns flatly.
Steve rolls his eyes, actually rolls his eyes, and Tony throws back his head with a laugh.
“What did I do this time, Steve? I haven’t even been out of the lab since this morning, but I’m sure you can find something to lecture me about.”
Steve hasn’t moved a muscle, is still standing stiff and tense at the far end of the living room, watching Tony pace. He takes a deep breath, lets it out, then opens his mouth. “You have a pretty low opinion of the team, and of me, if you really think those things,” he says. Tony opens his mouth to argue but doesn’t really have anything to say to that because he does believe what he said is true. He closes his mouth again and says nothing.
A laugh startles out of Steve. He shakes his head, smiling, arm still extended. “I’ve fought in a war. I’m 29 years old. I don’t understand why everyone thinks I’m some delicate flower.”
. He pats him on the back a couple of times before pulling away reluctantly. He'd forgotten how good it felt to be embraced, to be missed.
But Steve missed him. He felt his absence every time he walked into the training room and there was no smart-assed comment to greet him. Felt it when he woke up in the middle of the night, mind churning with memories of ice and trains and Bucky, and he went into the kitchen for a glass of milk and there was no sleep-deprived genius tapping his fingers impatiently while the coffee machine percolated, eyes focused on something far away. He missed Tony’s infuriating chatter on the comms, and he really missed seeing the red and gold soar through the skies overhead, knowing Iron Man has his back.
The rage wells up without warning and he punches the glass and it shatters, pieces falling noisily to the countertop around his clenched fist. He notices the blood before he feels the pain, the ugly throbbing of his hand. Grabbing a towel left next to the sink, —
“Yeah, that’s it,” Tony snaps, heading out from behind the bar and back towards the soft, welcoming couch calling his name. He just wants to be alone now, keep drinking until he passes out from it and doesn’t dream at all.
“I’d like to. Stay.” Tony looks up, eyes wide. Opens his mouth and closes it again. “If that’s alright,” Steve says, asking permission.
“Widow, cover Hawkeye. Thor, Hulk, keep smashing. I need to go find Cap,” Tony says shortly. Thor’s lightning is useless against the machines; Doom had apparently accounted for lightning gods in his minion planning and any kind of electrical attack only boosts their battery power. Reminds him of when he and Thor first crossed paths, actually.
He smiles as he says it, softening the blow, and Steve smiles back, playing the part. Tony walks over to give him a last kiss, “For luck,” he says, and then he’s gone.
He huffs. The trials and tribulations of being Tony fucking Stark. Sometimes he misses just being able to kick ass and take names and not worry about kissing fat, white, rich ass the next day. But he’s a co-CEO now, Pepper having decided he should take some more responisibility, and the ass-kissing falls to him now.
He slips every once in a while, his eyes flicking just a little bit further to the right, and his gut clenches and his throat tightens so painfully he wonders if he’ll be able to draw in his next breath. Steve’s dresser sits there, same as the day he left it, a pile of change in a bowl, wallet sitting next to a framed picture of him and Tony after a battle, faces grimy but grinning at the camera, with Steve’s arm thrown affectionately around Tony’s armored shoulders. The Captain America shield is propped up against the side of the dresser, still gleaming proudly from the last time Steve polished it. Tony’s eyes take it all in like a drowning man before he manages to pull them away, away from the sight of how
"Hammer guy, can you control that lightning enough to shock his heart into beating, but not fry him?" Thor grunts an affirmative, and then Bucky's telling Steve to back up, and blue-white light zaps into Tony's chest with a small rumble of thunder. Steve is immediately on him again, but there's no change, and Bucky tells Thor to do it again. Everyone clears out and there's a repeat flash and Steve rushes back, and there's a pulse this time, faint but there, and Tony's breathing small, wet breaths. There's blood flecking his lips and Steve's heart skips a beat. He's got to have punctured a lung, and this is nothing Steve knows how to fix. Where is Bruce?
There’s another explosion, and he watches as the house begins to slide off the cliff. His breath catches in his throat. He can’t think. Stark is in there. Tony Stark is inside those walls, the ones that are sliding into the ocean even as he stares, unmoving, thousands of miles away, an ocean and a continent separating him from where he really needs to be.
He can see it all manifested in the way Tony is now, with his tendency to shy away from emotional situations, in the way he craves physical contact, the way he dances around questions about himself while maintaining a facade of confidence and narcissism.
He begins making pained noises and Steve decides he's had enough of staying away, so he crosses the small space to kneel at Tony's side, the medical technicians making room for Captain America without comment. He takes Tony's hand gently, careful of the IV pumping fluids into the back of it, speaking to the EMTs over Tony's prone form.
And since his second “rebirth”, opening his eyes nearly seventy years later. Watching videos of the history he’d missed, and the wars nobody ever won or ever learned from, all of the pointless death, the atomic bomb. Standing on the edge of the SHIELD helicarrier as it lifted him into the sky. The son of Howard Stark hurling truth wrapped in insults, not afraid or intimidated by Captain America towering over him. Aliens crashing through a 3-dimensional portal, intent on wrecking his city, his home. Tony Stark, making that sacrifice play. Tony Stark, falling back to earth, surviving, overcoming once again.
He’s alive.
He spends a week in Minsk, before boarding a train to Vitebsk, a smaller city closer to the Russian border, on a tip from Natasha. This city is just as cold, and somehow even lonelier than the last, despite its green lawns and white buildings and clean streets. The people here are even more withdrawn, and he doesn’t know if it’s because he’s an unwelcome American, or because there’s something else going on that he’s unaware of. He hopes it’s the latter. For all of the problems it could potentially cause, it’s a way of knowing they’re on the right track, in the right place.
“No, Steve. YOU’RE not listening. You want to preach about working together and team decision making and no secrets? You’re a fucking hypocrite.”
“Tony, oh my god, thank god.” He sounds close to tears and Tony wants to kick himself, but that won’t be happening anytime soon. He can hardly move. He cries out as he feels a sharp pain in his abdomen, opens his eyes to see what’s attacking him. There are people leaning over his body, pressing him down, and Tony tries to sit up, get them off him.
Cap shakes his head, voice soft but firm when he replies. “No, thank you. I’m actually here—“
Rhodey is quiet but firm when he replies, “She’s not going to wake up.”
“Love sucks sometimes.”
They sit in comfortable silence until Steve speaks up again. “That isn’t the only reason I came here, though.” Tony grunts in acknowledgement, not sure he really wants to hear what other reason Steve’s got for coming down to the city. He has a feeling he knows what it is.
Then Steve’s letting go of his wrists and reaching both hands inside Tony’s shirt, pushing both it and his jacket off Tony’s shoulders and away from his body. They fall with a dull thump to the hallway floor and Steve’s hands are back to exploring his chest, shoulders, stomach, and Tony’s shivering from the sensations, unable to control the tremors racing through his body.
He backs Tony into the bedroom, never stopping the kiss, hardly stopping to breathe. The room is still dark and they stumble until they reach the bed, losing clothes along the way. Steve shucks his shoes, hopping awkwardly for a moment to peel his socks and pants off before returning to the heat of Tony’s mouth. Tony peels both the sweater and button-down over his head in one move, lets his hands roam unchecked over Steve’s chest and stomach. Steve gets to work on Tony’s belt, helping him step out of his pants before he reaches for the edge of Tony’s t-shirt.
Steve wants to cry, break down and ask why Bucky ran away from him, why he wouldn't let Steve help him all these months. He supposes it was personal, Bucky's vendetta against Hydra, but he would have liked to help take them out, feel some sort of satisfaction after everything they've done to him and the people he loves.
Sometimes love isn't enough.
“Can I have some water?” he asks, voice quiet.
He’d tried on different names in front of the mirror, James and Mark and Gabe and Arnold, but nothing seemed to fit. Besides, Natasha’s always said that sometimes it’s easier to hide in plain sight, and Steve is a common name for men his age. It’s also better for him because he’s not too good at remembering to answer to other names, and it’s gotten him in trouble before.
Steve's face crumples and he shakes his head. "Tony-- you almost died." His voice breaks on the last word and he starts to turn away but Tony reaches out and grabs his hand, pulling him to the hospital bed.
“Steve, where’s Bruce?” Steve looks awkward, and sad, and Tony’s heart sinks. “Where did they take him?”
“Get your ass up,” he says, voice tight.
He has a very brief internal argument, tells himself it’s a bad idea and then resolutely ignores himself, before Steve motions the bartender over.
Rogers stares at him, determined. “Yes. You’ve slept less than an hour in the last two days. You’re talking to yourself and you look like shit, to be honest. Let’s go.”
Steve smiles slightly, huffing a breath out his nose. “I knew that already.”
Steve sighs. “Tony, the reason I called was to… Well. Was actually to apologize. Again.”
So he doesn’t get it when Tony asks him out on the town and immediately follows it with an eye roll and says, “Why am I even asking you? You don’t know how to have fun.”
“Am I?”
Steve steps back quickly, like he’s afraid of Tony, or just afraid of touching him. Tony’s heart breaks a little more and he gasps in pain.
He smiles, shrugs. “Doing alright. Busy. Yourself?”
bed that he’s decided may as well be his new home. He certainly can’t face anything else in this tower. Too many memories. In the bed, too, but if he faces the bathroom he doesn’t have to see the flat sheets and bare pillow, the lack of a warm body lying next to him. He’s got it all worked out by now.
Tony doesn't answer. Just closes the distance between them and grasps the sides of his face with both hands, pulling him down into a kiss.
Bouncing from foot to foot, he jiggles Jamie on his hip while he rambles on about repulsors and thrust and other awesome scientific things that he secretly hopes is seeping into the kid’s brain in some type of osmosis or exposure-related learning or something. Hearing his own voice (and the occasional nonsensical babble from the baby on his hip) isn’t quite as conducive to random bursts of genius as ear-bleeding levels of classic rock music, but Steve had made it abundantly clear that if Tony didn’t put on something more soothing at a much lower volume, Jamie wasn’t allowed in the lab at all. So Tony capitulated, and now there’s classical music floating through the air, which definitely isn’t Aerosmith, but is better than the 40’s and 50’s stuff Steve likes, and Tony would never be caught dead listening to Today’s Top 40. (Though some of that Taylor Swift stuff that Steve likes is pretty catchy, he’s not gonna lie.)
He watches as the caskets are lowered into the ground. Steve’s, with the American flag draped over it like the National hero he is. Was. And Jamie’s. The tiny little wooden casket engraved with vines and flowers and words someone had chosen in his mental absence, probably Pepper. It’s so small, much too small to contain something as large as death.
“I was getting ready to leave anyway,” the guy says companionably, shrugging. He pushes himself up from his chair and grabs his jacket, swinging it over wide shoulders and tucking his book into an inside pocket. He wraps the scarf loosely around his neck.
“Yeah. Truth hurts, Cap.”
Tony shakes his head, clears his throat. His eyes flit away, unable to hold Steve’s brilliant gaze any longer.
saved him, believed in him, refused to hear anything other than “We’re getting him back”. And now he’s gone, Bucky’s last link to anything he really knows, and Tony’s sitting here, in his swanky penthouse apartment with fucking cracks in the walls and cracks in his soul and cracks in his fucking mind, because he’s stupid and selfish and it has to stop now. Bucky’s right, Tony’s not the only one who lost someone.
Steve takes the dismissal gracefully, just smiles slightly and leans in to give Tony a tiny peck on the mouth. Tony licks his lips as Steve pulls away, opens his eyes. He didn’t even know he’d closed them.
“It’s the whole All-American apple pie look you’ve got going on. Very wholesome. The plaid and khaki doesn’t help, either. It’s like cursing in front of your grandpa.”
Apparently yes, it was, because he turned the corner to the communal kitchen at 3 am to see that same super-soldier boyfriend locking lips with his newly recovered super-soldier best friend.
It’s Sharon Carter, striding confidently down the hallway toward him, face open and smiling.
“Well, if you change your mind, handsome, you know where to find me,” she says, before taking her friend by the arm and pulling her back to the dance floor.
Tony is opening his mouth, and Steve wants so badly to hear what he has to say, when JARVIS speaks.
“More important than the team?” Steve asks, 100% righteous, and Tony is 100% done. That was quick. Must be a new record.
"Good man, J." He turns to Steve, eyes flitting around the room but never resting on Steve himself. "See you bright and early, yeah Cap? Get some shut eye, we can hash everything out on the way."
“Tony, I absolutely can blame myself!” Steve sounds dismayed. “There’s no excuse for me doing something like that, no matter how angry I am with someone. Especially to you. You deserve better than that.”
“The only one that remembers Ultron is you, Tony.” Tony snorts. “Fine,” Steve relents, running a hand through his messy hair, “they remember Ultron. But you’re the only one dwelling on it. You helped save everyone, Tony, and they know it. We couldn’t have done it without you.” Steve’s eyes are so earnest it makes Tony want to vomit.
Steve’s back up on his feet, roaring with fury when a bullet hits him in the chest and this time Tony’s sure his heart stops. He watches as Steve’s eyes go wide with shock before he falls to his knees.
Tony barks out a laugh. "'Atta boy," he says, slapping him amicably on the arm as he heads toward the elevator. He wants to go back down to the lab and work out those armor kinks now that he's got Captain America settled in.
“It’s kind of early to be drinking, isn’t it?” Steve asks, glancing over at Tony. Tony can’t read his expression.
Tony does a bit of a double-take, eyes wide and surprised, before he grins. “Oh Captain, this is going to be so much fun,” he says, and Steve knows he’s in trouble.
He can’t pull his hands back even if he wanted to, he’s got no control of his limbs, but JARVIS, true to his word, moves the armor around him. The gauntlets shudder and jerk, moving haltingly, but it’s working, JARVIS is pulling wires and fuses apart and the Doombot looks like it’s starting to fail as well.
"Bucky's in Germany because he's working on taking down a new Hydra base. He's in contact with me, and if he needs them, the rest of the Avengers. We're going to take them all out together." And that's kind of poetic, Captain America and the Winter Soldier, Steve Rogers and Bucky Barnes taking out Hydra once and for all. With a little help from Tony Stark and the rest of the Avengers, of course, because they're not going to just sit idly by when there's all kinds of explosions and fun to be had. "The team is resting, we're moving you to New York tomorrow morning to finish your recovery, and we're going to gather some intel for Bucky. He'll be in touch."
“Hey Tony,” Steve calls across the room, and Tony looks up from the hologram floating in front of him, smiling.
Steve goes back to petting Tony's hair, talking nonsense and waiting for help to arrive. It's the longest ten minutes of his life, feeling Tony's blood leak out between his fingers, watching his team try to staunch the flow from half a dozen different places. Natasha and Clint run over to relay information to the EMS team when the chopper finally lands, and then there's a flurry of motion and Steve is pushed aside and the professionals take over. He stands back as Tony is lifted onto a gurney and rushed away. He feels a presence behind him and looks around to find Bucky standing there, flesh and metal arms both covered in Tony's blood. He's sure he looks just as bad.
Tony throws his hands up in the air. “So now we need a chaperone when we’re together? Great, Steve, that’s wonderful, I’m so excited for this, can’t wait. Are you going to rotate them, a different Avenger every weekend? Or is Wilson here taking on the full responsibility all by his lonesome?” He glances over at Sam, whose face doesn’t show anything but concern. Some of Tony’s anger burns away at the sight and he looks away again quickly.
Tony and Bruce walk in last, just before 5:30, and by then Steve can't stand still. He's pacing beside the car, probably wearing a hole in the concrete, ready to get to the airstrip and be on their way. Tony claps a hand to his shoulder as he walks by, squeezing lightly, and Steve feels a little bit better as they slide into the back of the limousine and exit the underground garage.
He pulls out the little black flip phone, sees a text message.
Tony’s eyes fly to Bruce, who looks just as shocked as he does. All of the color drains out of his face, and his eyes are wide and fearful, and just the tiniest bit green around the edges.
Steve grins back slowly, sensually, eyes dark with desire, and Tony wants. He wants so much. Steve's face is mischievous as he pushes Tony back onto his pillows again. "You need your rest, you've got a long day tomorrow," he says, all helpful and innocent and so, so sexy.
A few moments after the man with the cigar leaves, the door opens again. Steve lifts his gaze, squinting slightly against the bright streetlights out front, and sees a figure enter through the lingering cloud of cigar smoke. It’s a moment before he realizes it’s Tony, hat pulled low over his eyes, shoulders hunched, but Steve would recognize that strut anywhere.
Steve takes a breath, steeling himself. Sam is quiet behind him, a supportive shadow. “For striking you. I— I shouldn’t have done that.” He almost whispers the last. “I’m so sorry, Tony.”
He signs the papers to pull the plug two days later. Two days of knowing the right thing to do but unable to do it. Two days of sitting at Pepper’s beside, asking for her forgiveness for not being there, for not being better, for not knowing what she would have wanted. He feels like he should know. He feels like he does know. But what if he’s wrong? What if he decides to pull the plug and she would have wanted him to wait, maybe just a week or two to see what happens? What if he pulls it and she could have made a full recovery? Medical miracles happen all the time. Just look at his chest.
He turns around, reaches up to wind his arms around Steve’s neck, and finally,
He feels like he’s going to burst with the sheer volume of love he has for this man.
He turns to Bruce urgently. “Bruce, listen to me.” Bruce is breathing heavily, but he locks eyes with Tony. Tony shakes him slightly. “You cannot go green, okay buddy? That’ll just give them another reason to take you in.” Bruce looks at him, looks past him, and Tony shakes him again, a little harder. “Do you hear me? You can’t hulk out, Bruce.” Bruce gives him a little nod, and it’s the best Tony’s going to get so he nods in return.
Tony laughs aloud. “Is that why you came here? For my couch?” he asks.
“You could run it by me, Tony. Maybe discuss things with me before you decide you know what’s best for all of us.” Tony can hear the accusation in there, the implication that he’s decided what’s best for the team before and it didn’t work out so well, did it.
Steve feels numb. They are reporting that the President is okay, rescued by Colonel Rhodes in the Iron Patriot/War Machine armor, but they haven’t said anything about Tony, or Pepper.
Steve’s angry. Fuck, what did Tony say to make him angry this time? Is it the drinking? No, he’d been upset about that but was just fine when he was asking if Tony needed to talk. Maybe the mention of Pepper?
Awareness starts to seep in and he realizes someone is holding him up, hands on his back and shoulders. They’re murmuring to him, but he can’t hear them, can’t hear anything but Jamie’s crying and Steve’s last words, his name, and please, and Tony know’s what he was trying to say, please don’t hurt our son, please.
Tony can only make a vaguely affirmative-sounding noise. His hands are splayed flat on the workshop bench in front of him so he doesn't have to see them shaking.
“Tony, we got a hit on— are you drunk?” Steve’s voice goes high on the question and Tony giggles.
“You remind me of someone,” Tony mumbles, and Steve pauses as he sets the second shoe on the floor next to the first.
He thinks about it. Thinks about going home, to Tony’s angry silence, cold sheets and empty beds.
Tony nods, clears his throat slightly and tries to dredge up some pep. “Yep, all better, bud. Peachy keen.” His voice only trembles a little. He calls it a success.
Tony whirls around, pulling up camera views on the screens in front of him. There are indeed military personnel in his tower, Army, specifically, dressed in full tactical gear.
At least Steve seems to be on the same page, which helps keep some of Tony’s anxiety about the situation at bay. He catches Steve staring at him often, smiling softly. When they’re down in the lab together to work on something or other for the team or for SI, Steve sketches, and though he’s never shown Tony what he draws, Tony’s got FRIDAY, and he’s seen that it’s mostly him covering the pages of Steve’s sketchbooks. Drawings of his hands, his eyes, his mouth, sometimes the Iron Man suit and the arc reactor, but mostly of Tony as he is now, laughing at one of Steve’s jokes, arguing pointlessly with Dummy, working on one of Natasha’s Widow’s bites with his tongue poking out from between his teeth.
