Tony turned to him, a single eyebrow raised. “Shoot.”
“My judgement is the best judgement in the field in terms of what I’m able to accomplish in the moment. No one else knows what it’s like to be me, how the suit works. Cap’s a good team leader, sure, but that doesn’t mean he always makes the right call.”
“You make people feel special, and important, and worth something, and to find out that any of those things isn’t true, it’s a slap in the face.”
Tony shrugs, and Beth eyes him curiously.
He regretted the choice later, but not for the reasons he’d thought. He’d been brought to tears, nearly, by how much of Tony he’d seen in the book. They’d still been rough, then. They hadn’t been quite back to speaking terms yet. And he’d stopped, at this little passage, just the smallest thing: “and I am still this / machine.” Two simple lines, but enough to make him take a moment and swallow. He’d taken a break, drank half his coffee. Then he’d opened the book back up. And then, again, in “Hangover”: “It’s all been so beastly / lovely / this mad river, / this gouging / plundering / madness / that I would wish upon / nobody / but myself, / amen.” After “Bluebird” he hadn’t been able to keep going. He’d put the book down and sat with his head in his hands in Tompkins Square Park, all around him dogs barking and little old folks taking their daily walks, and he’d thought: so this is it. This will be the thing I regret most for the rest of my life.
"You're talking to Loki?" Cap says, startled. He almost misses catching his shield.
“You’re right. It does taste better that way,” he said, and Steve smiled indolently at him.
“She’s an alpha,” Tony said, less warning than observing, and Steve shrugged.
There was a quiet, dangerous silence. “You’ve been locked in with Tony Stark in an alpha rage for the past four hours?” Natasha asked, voice flat. “And you didn’t think to mention this before?”
"I don't think he likes that name, JARVIS."
Steve takes a breath. “I grew up during the draft,” he says. “I certainly thought it was the moral imperative for everybody that could fight to get out there on the front lines and do it. I believe that it’s everyone’s duty to resist evil wherever they see it.”
"You all heard him?"
“Bye, Tony.”
“Captain, I thought you should know that Sir has arrived at the tower. Doctor Banner has kept him in the biocontainment unit, and is moving him into the Tank now. His bloodwork should be completed within a few hours.” Steve’s heart lurched unpleasantly in his chest, relief and nausea warring inside of him for dominance. “I will keep you updated as things progress.”
The line cuts out. Tony stares at the phone in his hands, breathes in. He can remember with uncomfortable clarity the anxiety in Pepper’s voice every time he’d called her in the days before, terrified that some awful thing was happening to him and that he was making a last confession. The Battle of New York had changed things for both of them, mostly for the worse, and Tony can see now how much better their relationship is when Pepper only has to worry about her best friend and her boss dying, not her lover as well. It’s a distinction he might not have noticed a few years ago, but he’s learning. Pepper taught him a lot of things, in retrospect; patience, and how to listen, and honesty. He’s still working on that last one.
Tony shrugs. “I have congenital adrenal hyperplasia,” he says. “Excess alpha hormone.” He gives Steve a careful look. “Do you want specifics? If you’ve read
“You just had to make it weird,” Rhodey says, and Tony cackles.
“It’s ok, Cap-”
"Oh Pep." Tony shakes his head, changing lanes to head for Manhattan. "No I wasn't suggesting we try again."
getting old and predictable,” he says, “aren’t I?”
“Shit,” Tony breathes, and then he puts his lips around Steve’s cock and sucks.
“How long has this been going on?” he asks, quiet.
Jessie Diaz
“SHIELD doesn’t have the authority to mandate counselling anymore,” he says, hating himself a little, “but I am, as acting leader of the Avengers. This is way out of my depth. But we’ll be with you all the way, and it isn’t a condemnation-”
He thinks of Loki and Thor, circling each other like wary animals. He thinks about spending two thousand years of his life with someone, only to have his heart broken so thoroughly that he would wage a war to spread his misery. He thinks, maybe, how he feels about Tony is strong enough to make him do something reckless and dangerous. He thinks about the rage that overtook him in the elevator, and it makes him hate himself a little.
“Of course, sir.”
Tony snorts, takes another, larger swig of his drink. “It’s really not.” He swallows. “You were right, though. I do kind of like the bastard. He’s smart, damaged, funny.” Something passes over his face, then, dark and uncomfortably vulnerable. It twists Steve up to see Tony looking like that over someone else, even as he continues to soothe Tony with placid, sweeping strokes of his hand. “He’s so fucking lonely. He’s so messed up. I don’t know-… I don’t fucking know what I’m doing. And I don’t…I don’t know if I can-” He stops, and when he inhales his chest stutters, shaking.
“God, don’t tell me I’m getting old and predictable,” he says, rubbing a hand over his forehead. And then, “
“You smell good, okay?” he said, blushing again. “Just…I was just curious. That’s all. I know it’s a little different, for alphas and omegas. I’ve never…I just wondered.”
“For you? For him? For your relationship?” Tony presses.
Hulk nods at that. “Hulk think Banner feel better soon. Hulk want burger. Hulk eat burger, then Banner back.”
Steve laughs, then tucks Tony more firmly into his body and heads over towards the elevator. “Why not?”
There was something fascinating about the woman on the screen and the way she seemed to know Tony’s tricks. At first, she seemed like she was flirting. It was disarming. But her question turned pointed at the end, her eyes sharpening. Tony, bizarrely, seemed to find this even more charming still, because he laughed out loud.
“No, sir.” JARVIS pauses, hesitant. “Sir, perhaps you might listen to the rest of the team-”
People kept saying that, but Steve didn’t think it felt true anymore. He wasn’t sure if it ever had, because of all the things that he knew Tony was after coming back from Afghanistan, ‘fine’ wasn’t one of them. Traumatised, angry, desperate to keep his secrets, and thirsting for revenge, certainly, but fine? Well. Steve didn’t know that Tony had ever been ‘fine’ in his whole damn life.
“How did they know where he’d be?” Steve asked, tilting his head as JARVIS followed the footage back, tracking the SUVs through Cambridge. They’d been careful not to ever show their faces, caps pulled low over their eyes as they drove, disappearing into the back to put on masks and then reappearing fully-covered. There wasn’t that much to go on, and Steve had the creeping thought that maybe he was being distracted, kept out of the way while the team did the real work. This was the first time Tony had been kidnapped since they’d been bonded, he realised. Was that what this was?
“Doctor Banner is sleeping. Protocols dictate I am only to wake him when it is absolutely necessary.”
Steve rubs a hand over his mouth. “So am I in a coma, or what?” he asks, but no one answers him.
I want to ask you.
“Storm’ll probably last a few days,” Rogers rumbled.
Dear Forgiveness, I saved a plate for you.
“I’m sure he will,” Xavier says warmly. “Have a good afternoon, Captain.”
Xavier shrugs. “The one that feels true to you,” he replies easily. He turns back to the rubble, where Tony is ready to be lifted out of the debris and brought back into the light of the sun. Steve moves closer, just to see Tony’s face as he pops the faceplate, his beatific grin as he quips, “Miss me?” In this place between memory and vision, he is both watching and holding one of Tony’s precious gauntlets, is both pulling him out of the rubble to clutch in a hug and wincing at the fact that Thor had to be the one to grab the girl whose arm would soon be amputated.
“Are you saying a kiss broke the curse?” Steve asks, cutting him off, and Tony opens his mouth, then closes it again.
“Sir, I have him. I am sending reinforcements.” JARVIS’ voice is gentle, and Tony snarls with frustration, heading back up the elevator shaft.
“No, it doesn’t,” Steve allows. “But you’re more fragile than you let people see. I forget that, sometimes. You cover yourself in so many different kinds of armour, and you always put on this mask of everything being fine. That’s what the team means, when they say I should know better. I always end up saying the wrong thing, even if I don’t mean to.”
Tony squeezes his eyes shut. “Right.” He sucks in a breath, scrubbing his face over before he straightens. He shakes his arms out, rolls his head on his neck. “Right. Okay. Any word on Loki or Thor?”
Tony shrugs, taking stock of the situation: him naked except for a pair of cotton sleep pants, Loki looking comfortable in some sort of raw silk tunic wrap, black trimmed in dark forest greens. He’s barefoot below leather trousers. Tony knows there’s a drive behind each action; soft and non-threatening when he surprises Tony in kitchens or private bathrooms, armoured and guarded in the room where they fought. He’s laying the groundwork for their interactions, trying to convince Tony of his trustworthiness. It would be more convincing if he didn’t know Loki’s leathers and weapons could appear out of thin air.
Steve flinches bodily at the surname. “Tony,” he says, but Tony doesn’t look at him, purposefully walking past him and the people with loaded guns, all ex-military or SHIELD or CIA, and all completely loyal. He props a hand on Dr. Lennox Chandrakar’s shoulder, leaning into him a little and grinning at Steve again. He can feel blood dripping down his chin, to great effect.
“Steve,” Tony says, and Steve waits, albeit impatiently. Already, his eyes are looking away from the screen. There’s tension in every line of his body. “I’m sorry, too.”
Then she got up and wiped her face down with a towel, draping it around her neck. Steve lay there on the mat as she drank from her water bottle, her head tossed back as she drained the whole thing.
Tony considers this seriously. Steve had always been running away, when they lived together. From his own bodily responses, from Tony, from conflict. But Steve’s never abruptly hung up on Tony during a video call before. Perhaps the distance gives him more space to breathe.
And then he picked Tony up and hoisted him so that his legs curled around Steve’s waist. The expression of delight on Tony’s face was dangerous. Steve would do a lot of things for that face, but for now he leaned in to kiss Tony as sweetly as he knew how.
Steve’s eyes are bright with unshed tears. He’s got a smear of blood branching out from the corner of his mouth up towards his right ear, like he took a hard punch to the mouth and split his lip. Whatever the injury was, it’s already healed, and Tony offers him an unsteady smile as he checks him over. Aside from the expected state of post-battle dishevelment, he looks alright.
“You don’t look like you’re on the lam or been blown up,” Sam observes, sipping a tall glass of water as he assays him. Steve rubs the back of his neck. “And Natasha isn’t here. So I’m guessing this is a personal issue that I don’t want to know about, and you just need a place to crash.”
“Hangover?” he says, knowingly.
“Kinda the opposite,” Steve says, taking the seat at his right. He pushes a frankly alarming number of apple slices onto Tony’s plate. “Eat some fruit.”
“No problem, Cap.”
“Oh well, since I’m suddenly free,” Steve mutters. “Patch her through for me?”
“I think sir has answered enough questions throughout this ordeal,” JARVIS said, censure in his voice, and Steve winced. “I do not mean to be unsympathetic to their concerns. However, my prime directive is to protect Sir.”
“Stop fighting,” Tony growled, fingers tight around Rogers’ wrists. Rogers was confused, staggering back and forth, but he stilled at the sound of Tony’s voice. He let Tony put an arm around his waist, his fingers digging into Tony’s collar as Tony half-dragged, half-walked him into the rooms above the jail proper. Wilson had left a smouldering fire burning in the hearth, as well as a note about checking in with the ranches along the pass road. Tony tossed a log on and pulled the spare blanket from the cupboard, wrapping the wool around Rogers’ shoulders. The man had only started shivering in the last mile, a poor sign if he’d been so cold he’d stopped moving.
Professor Xavier just chuckles. “I much prefer your honesty, Captain, as I’ve stated.” Outside, a group of young folks huddle together over their books, conversing animatedly. One of them has a magnificent pair of wings. “I’m just saying, perhaps you mistake the world view of your compatriots as the average. Your social circle is very niche, Captain, and comprised of individuals who have committed themselves to protecting the world, often at the expense of their comfort, their physical health, and their life. That is not a decision to take lightly, and it isn’t fair to expect that from everyone.”
Steve kind of loses himself in the kissing. Below them, the sounds of the city echo up to them strangely: a siren, a voice on a megaphone, the flapping of many wings. He considers, briefly, the worry of being spotted, but discards it just as quickly. He honestly could not care less right now.
Steve felt like he was going to be sick. All the times he’d begged for Tony, told him how much he loved his cock…
The door opens.
"I often am," Tony says. He wonders if his surprise is visible on his face. "What was I right about this time?"
“It lives,” Tony deadpans. A relieved sigh from multiple people echoes across the comm.
Steve’s mouth quirks, as though he’s fighting a laugh. His eyes are wide as saucers. “I…are you. Have you been drinking?” He frowns, squinting down into the screen. His patrician nose replaces Tony’s view of his lovely collarbones. “Where are you?”
Tony releases his ass and slaps him, open handed and loud. It’s more startling than painful, but Steve moans like a slut for it anyway. He squirms deliciously against Tony’s hold.
“Can it be ready by midnight?”
“Yeah, that I wanted to avoid!” Tony exclaims, gesticulating mid-stride. Stephen studies him, chewing at his lip. He nods, once.
“Right?”
Tony doesn’t say. A small smile twists at his mouth against his will.
“You deserve to know,” Tony said. This was quickly becoming an old fight, one Steve had no interest in rehashing, so instead he just shrugged, leaning back in his chair.
“Sorry, dearheart. I didn’t mean to. The suit got a bit knocked around. Just came back online.”
“Yes.” He opened his legs wider, oversensitive and still he wanted it. He wanted Tony to claim him. He wanted Tony. “Bite me. Knot me. Take me-
Tony looks. He frowns at it. “This isn’t right.”
“Thank you,” Tony breathes, sitting down on the toilet lid. He rubs at his forehead with his free hand.
Tony rumbled, a pleased growl travelling through his body as he pushed himself up and reached over to fumble in the nightstand for a plug.
Finally, why A/B/O? Well, honestly? I needed Tony to be trans, and I wanted a way to make the stakes of him being off his hormones higher, and I needed him to be transmasc in a way where it was possible for a partner of 1.6 years to hypothetically just…not notice. Phalloplasty/top surgery hasn’t progressed to a point where that’s super possible for trans men right now. However, adding extra erectile tissue to an existing penis in a universe where Dr. Cho can just straight grow Ultron a whole body if he wants? Eh. I know hypothetically she could grow a dick and stick that on someone, but this seemed more believable because a relatively ironclad suspension of disbelief when it comes to hormones/genitals is already so necessary for A/B/O. When someone goes on T, their clit enlarges, so the idea that someone on alpha hormone would grow a small knot seemed plausible to me. The rest of A/B/O is primarily all pseudoscience around hormones, pheromones, and the endocrine system. All of that is perfectly in line with HRT, and pretty much everyone in the A/B/O AU experiences multiple orgasms (except for beta males, which seems…really unfair now that I think about it, huh) so there were no other major changes I could think of.
Steve puts his hands on his hips and looks out at the water, letting his breath his out in a long, low whistle. The sunrise has mostly finished showing off, but there’s the barest bit of golden glow everywhere that makes the whole scene look somewhat surreal. It’s as good a time to say it out loud for the first time as any. “I finally took Natasha’s advice.”
“I can,” he says. “Missives to a handful of known Nigerian and Congolese operatives match Agent Romanov’s claims.”
Tony claps his hands together. “Great. Now we’re gonna run some tests. Steve, come stand here.” He taps his foot on a marker on the workshop floor, then holds out a hand.
Tony finishes dressing in silence. It hurts, but Steve doesn’t know what else to do. Tony’s never been able to hear him, even when they were touching. He’s pretty sure Tony hadn’t really been able to see him, either, or he wouldn’t have asked. Maybe a shadow, or an outline. A distortion in the air. Not enough for Tony to look at him and know who he was without asking.
“Natasha, this is Bucky. Now I
Hope you had fun! Thanks for stopping by. Drop a line, let me know what you thought. As always, all comments welcome.
“He does,” Steve agrees, although he still sounds sad. “Lots of people do.”
“Stark,” Thor says, expression twisted into something ugly Tony’s never seen from him before, but he pauses when the arm Loki has draped over Tony’s shoulder lights up with golden light.
Steve blushes prettily, which is just. No. God, he’s going to hell for this. On top of the whole Merchant of Death thing. Surely this was against some cosmic rule against lust and greed and gluttony.
Tony grinned, stepping past Steve to go inside and fetch the armour.
Steve swallows. He ducks his head.
“Fuck,” he hisses. “Um. What is happening?”
“He’s dangerous,” Bruce interrupts, “and now you’ve made his happiness contingent on you. Did you think about that? You could be all he has.”
“They’re hell on your body, and Tony wouldn’t want you to unless you had to,” Bruce finished. He nodded. “Good call.” He waved a hand at the screen. “Look, if Thor, Nat, Clint, and a SHIELD team can’t stop these guys, you probably wouldn’t do much to change the outcome. Tony always has six different tricks up his sleeve. He’s been kidnapped more times than we can count by now. He’ll be fine.
He reaches out and offers Loki a hand.
“Cognitive recalibration?” Clint asks, and Tony stills as a lightbulb goes off in his head.
“That’s kinda the idea.”
"Ah." Tony stands, then gestures for her to leave first. "He's fine for me to have sex with but not for you to sleep in the same building as, huh?"
Anyway, that’s my author meta. Hope you enjoy it. This is my first ever foray into FrostIron, so bear with me. (And don’t get me started on the Hydra reveal.)
Something strange happens, then. Loki’s face shifts, or twists, maybe. His jaw lengthens, teeth growing in his mouth, until they are sharp enough to slice through Thor’s fingers like a hot knife through butter. His skin ripples, hair gleaming strangely, and Thor lets out a shout of pain and staggers back from him, pulling his hand in to his chest.
Maybe it’s a
“Well, she’s someone I respect,” Steve says, then frowns. “Wouldn’t it bother you?”
“That’s…have I really?”
Bucky snorts. There’s the tell-tale sound of a zipper being closed. “Sharon told me you used to be better at having friends.”
Tony pauses, bent over the coffee pot. His shoulders are tense, the dual whammy of his tenuous relationship with Luke and his reticence to talk to anyone about Steve mixing into whatever mortified expression Steve is sure he’s trying to hide by leaning over the counter. Steve reaches out a hand to comfort him, but the memory of Tony flinching away from him stops him. He fists his hands at his sides, glances over to where Luke is watching Tony with a narrow-eyed expression on his face. He hands Dani another piece of banana.
He thinks of Peggy, the riddle of her: strong alpha confidence stuffed into an omega’s soft, curved body. He remembers the horrific things the men used to say about her, the way it would make his fists clench so hard his nails cut into his palms. He thinks about Gilmore Hodge muttering: “Of course Rogers is panting after her—he’s basically an O, ‘course he wants a proper Bitch. He’s probably hoping Carter’s hiding a knot under her skirt.” He thinks of launching himself forward and punching the bastard so hard he fell back. The other men had crawled over each other to pull them apart, his knuckles split open and a black ring around his eye, Hodge’s nose crooked and gushing blood into his mouth. He thinks of how angry Peggy had been after: “I don’t need anyone to fight my battles for me, Rogers.” She hadn’t spoken to him for a whole week.
“FRI- oh my God,
Tony fiddles with his spoon. Okay, so maybe he’s a hypocrite. “We still take military contracts,” he tries.
Tony raised his eyebrows. “Really?” he asked. Steve swallowed, so embarrassed he felt a little lightheaded with it. “I…didn’t expect that from you.”
“Okay,” Bruce says, “let’s go to California.”
The crowd had hushed a bit to catch Steve’s words, and he could feel heat rushing up the back of his neck, but it was too late to stop now. He’d already gotten this far.
“Looks that way.”
All your life, whom you ignored
Tony just shrugs. “I guess I already knew you’re a better man than me.”
The shock was so strong that Steve stumbled, nearly fell. The sight of him was painful, but the glass was so thick that it made it hard to feel like Tony was real. If he concentrated hard enough he could pretend it was a video, a projection on a large screen. The sweatshirt helped, too, and he stepped forward slowly, both from caution and to combat his own dizziness as he stared at his mate and was still unable to touch him. He wanted so badly to touch him, and before he could help himself a small whimper built in his throat, echoing strangely in the cavernous space.
“You look refreshed,” Bruce remarked, eyes shining with easy amusement. He took a sip of tea, offering Steve half of the Times, but Steve just shook his head. “Have you eaten?”
Tony pulled back to study him, eyes blazing, and then he took Steve’s mouth in so fierce a kiss that Steve felt like all the air had been sucked out of him. It was all he could do to clutch helplessly at Tony’s shoulders, to let Tony cover his aching, grimy post-heat body with his own, to melt under him. The kiss felt like being eaten alive.
He presses another kiss to Tony’s temple, his jaw.
“Tony,” Rogers began, then sighed. The uncommon shock of his given name outside of the secret intimacy of their beds startled Tony, and he turned to blink at Rogers’ hangdog expression. “I wish you wouldn’t punish yourself so.”
“Because you know,” Tony said, and he only sounded a little bitter about it.
There’s a dry rasp: skin over skin. Steve’s lips tingle faintly with warmth, and then he can’t stop himself. His eyes snap open, and Tony’s face is there. His eyes are closed, lashes a dark sweep over his cheeks. He looks beautiful, and Steve is struck suddenly by how much he
“So what, he’s always with you?”
Tony lets out a hiss, like the air escaping from a balloon. He looks a little like he does when they’re sparring and Steve lands a nasty hit too close to the arc reactor. As if to cement the comparison, Tony lifts a hand and flicks his thumb over the hard ridge of the edge, the rest of his fingers resting against the cool glass pane.
“Loki, you mad,
“Yeah, that’s it, baby. Come again for me beautiful, come on.”
“Hm,” the professor hums, and then: Portoviejo, Ecuador.
“You’re fucking incredible,” Tony whispered, and it sounded like
“Ah, my favourite view.” Steve turned his head, a sweet smile already breaking over his face at the possessive warmth in that dearly familiar voice. He caught a glancing kiss at the corner of his mouth, warm hands slipping over his hips and around to his stomach as Tony plastered himself to Steve’s back.
Pushing through the fathomless in-between place to get to Tony feels easier this time, although that might be the giddiness bubbling under his skin. He comes back to himself in Tony’s bathroom, and he has a brief moment of disorientation, a flush of embarrassment at the flash of bare skin.
“I wanted to ride you.”
And now Tony’s remembering Loki, lithe and pale and beautiful beneath him. He remembers how he’d looked spread out and trussed up. Steve’s muscled Adonis physique is so different, but the image of them both in his mind is enough to make him bite his lip. He may whimper. Maybe. No one could prove it.
Steve rises and pulls Peter into a hug. He freezes for a moment, two, but then he relaxes into it. He rests his head against Steve’s shoulder.
“Yeah, this is exactly what I was worried about.”
“Sir has smaller hands, and somewhat slim fingers compared to the average European-American man. His ring size is recorded as an 8.5, although if I may, 8.75 would probably fit better. A 9 falls off, so he generally goes smaller when in doubt.” Steve nodded. “Should I…bring up a list of Sir’s preferred jewellers?”
Tony lets out a high, needy whine, and Steve bolts upright. He takes a deep breath.
“If you want.”
“You always get what you want, hmm omega?” he rasped, and Steve grinned.
“He’s down,” she says, finally. “When will they learn to stop experimenting on their own bodies?”
Logan, of course, doesn’t answer. He tips his head to the side, closes his eyes. He breathes in deep.
Steve shrugs. "I guess. You remember Howard, though that seems a mixed bag.” Tony snorts, and Steve flashes him a wry smile—just the barest quirk of his lip, more exhale than anything. “I barely knew my da. Even when he was alive he was barely ever around. All my memories of him are kinda blurry. Faded." He smiles bitterly. "Like an old photograph. Fitting huh?"
“It wasn’t until after Project Insight that I realised who he was. To Steve, I mean. To America.” Natasha shrugs languorously, tilting back in her chair. “I know that Steve thinks of Barnes as his, but he’s been awake for a lot longer than Steve. He understands the modern world. He’s helped shape it, mostly for the worse. He’s not the man Steve knew.”
“What does Bruce think?” Steve managed, taking another bite. The food tasted like sand in his mouth, but he pushed through it. He knew he needed the calories.
“Steve,” Tony says; he doesn’t know what else to say.
“I love you,” he said, and Tony let out a desperate snarling cry, pressing his forehead to Steve’s chest. “I love you, I love you, I love you.”
“I do not need rest,” Loki says, but he doesn’t sound too fussed about it.
“Oh, you’re good,” Tony says, and Shuri laughs. “Damn. Now I’m really, really sad I don’t remember you. I bet we’ve done some
“Of course she is,” JARVIS agrees, unabashed. “Why do you think Mx. Tan now handles all your publicity appointments?”
“Please stop,” Tony begs him, and Steve sucks in a shaky breath. He tightens his hold on Tony’s hand.
“So,” Pepper says, and Tony winces. He glances at Beth, who was already in Pepper’s office when he came in this morning. Her expression is nothing short of smug.
“Stark,” Natasha says, expression grim, and Tony spreads his hands. Of course she would know immediately what he was talking about.
Tony shuts his eyes at the wave of guilt and pain that washes over him. He deserved that. He deserves worse. “That’s definitely not true,” he rasps. He fixes a smile to his face, opens his eyes to see Steve’s intense blue glare. “I’ve seen the photos. You’ve always been adorable.”
“You’re ruining my holiday party,” Tony countered, and that- that was just. Steve grabbed Tony’s hand, pressing a fervent kiss to his knuckles to a chorus of whistling and laughter.
“Ask what?” Tony prompts, because he’s an asshole.
“You…never talk about your father.”
,” Natasha hissed, and Clint turned to glare at her. “We don’t ask questions. We complete the mission.”
“What do you need?”
“Gotta run.” The lie is flagrant enough that Steve snorts. “Later, Cap.”
“If we’re ready.”
over that kiss. What if he hadn’t had feelings for Steve? Sure, everything worked out this time, but this is-
“You know we couldn’t have.”
Steve hummed, the rumble of it echoing deliciously through Tony’s body. Steve’s fingers skimmed over his hip, and Tony closed his eyes and relaxed back into his broad, warm chest.
“I’m fucking losing it,” he says, letting the cold seep into his skin. “I fucking hate Asgard. I hate magic, and gods, and my fucking insane life.”
“I saw the footage. You know how good Tony is at self-recriminations.” He smiles: a tired, floundering thing. “I wasn’t able to hear Loki’s side, of course, but…Tony was just being his usual impulsive self. I don’t know what I would have done. He made a judgement call on the field based on limited intel, and without Loki’s inside information you wouldn’t have found me. I saw all the machines they had me hooked up to, the blood samples. Who knows what they wanted with all that stuff?”
“You are
“I have suspicions,” Natasha allowed, and Tony sighed, draining the rest of his coffee. Steve reached over the island and took hold of it, fingers brushing reassuringly against the back of Tony’s hand before he turned to refill the cup. “Steve and I have arguably been made intersex. Bruce is a beta who shares a body with the personification of alpha rage. There’s no space on this team for us to judge you for doing something to your body that you wanted. Especially if it makes you happy.” She smiled, kind and calm in the face of Tony’s visible agitation. “Your happiness is ours, alpha. That’s what it means, to be pack.”
“-but the FBI doesn’t do anything by halves, so even if he’s not found guilty, I can’t imagine the stain of whatever evidence they’ve found will completely wash out. I imagine that McCoy is here to stay, at least for the foreseeable future.”
“Is that a no?” Steve burrs, and Tony lets out an explosive gust of a sigh.
“Then how are we meant to fight him?” the Connecticut senator asks, looking alarmed.
Natasha continued as if she hadn’t heard them. It was a tried and true tactic of hers, and one that Steve was presently grateful for. “I’m not going to ask, either.”
Tony nods, weaving his fingers together, pulling them apart and repeating the process in different configurations. “I think he’s just interested in my tech, honestly.”
“You remember,” Tony says wetly, and Steve can’t help the rumbling laugh that bursts out of him.
He’s almost surprised when he’s able to lean in and kiss Tony: easy, effortless, like he belongs there. Like Tony was meant to be there, sweet and trembling under Steve’s mouth. He takes Tony’s face between his hands, runs his fingers through his hair. He presses fervent kisses to his eyebrows, his cheekbones, the little patch of hair under his lower lip. He slips his fingers down, thumbs tracing the tendons of Tony’s throat, fingertips sliding over Tony’s chest, his stomach. He takes Tony’s waist in his palms and marvels at how easy it is to move him, to pull him into his lap and press their bodies together, chest to chest. It’s a miracle that Tony manages to get the tea on the table without spilling it.
"Turning in for two months retraining," Coulson says sweetly. Natasha snorts.
Chewie in this relationship. I’m Han.” Tony’s back is tingling, a slow spread of gentle pins and needles. All the tension in him is melting away. “Also, what the fuck? Did you give me muscle relaxants?”

Steve blinks at him, incredibly stymied by this question. “Uh. Sure?” He grins wryly. “You know who I live with, right?”
Tony claps his hands, dissipating the image. “Well, you should watch the footage of her visit and tell me what you think,” he says, “but I’m sure you’re starving.”
"He told me he was an astral projection," Tony says with a shrug, unconcerned. "I was curious."
“Boss, do you want me to call someone? Carol? Or Rhodey?”
“What’s downstairs?” Clint asks, and Tony freezes.
“Tony?” Thankfully, Happy already sounds like he’s in a car. “Where are you?”
“What’s the wager?” he asks, and Steve grins at him.
“Tony,” Steve said, helplessly, and Tony pressed his forehead to Steve’s jaw, lined himself up, and pressed inside.
“Stay,” Steve croaks out, coughing to clear his throat. “It’s fine. Stay.”
“One minute, he was fine. I bent down, to- to tie my fucking shoe, and then-…”
“I’ll hold you to that,” Rogers said, and it sounded like maybe he meant something else. Tony didn’t have the wherewithal to think about what that might be. Instead, he focussed on the feeling of Rogers under his hands, the sounds he made when Tony pressed open-mouthed kisses to his neck, the look of him in the fading autumn light. This time, Tony had oil, and they were able to go much slower. He took his time, feeling Rogers flex under his hands, watching his chest rise and fall with each gasping breath. He waited until the sheriff had his pleasure before he took his own, sweet, sleepy kisses pressed to his mouth as Rogers came down from his own climax and Tony found his own.
Steve sighs. “I don’t want to upset you, but Bruce Hulked out after you left. I don’t know what you fought about, and we don’t have to talk about it, but I can’t leave him like this.”
, Captain. I regret everything."
When bonded pairs were planning to be separated for any significant length of time, the medically sound decision was to take suppressants for the length of the separation. When Steve was young, in the early days of the war, the military preferred to take unbonded alphas. Historically, unbonded alphas had always been prized for battle. They were considered the most brutal and aggressive soldiers, and natural leaders. The theory was that they fought harder because they still had something to prove, unlike bonded alphas who had already secured a mate. Such thinking was antiquated, but it was only when things began to get dire that the U.S. government had decided they would take just about anyone. Omegas staffed the factories. Betas were allowed to lead units on the front lines. Some omegas were even allowed to serve as nurses out in the trenches, if they were bonded to someone in the service. Looking back, Steve was sure that many omegas had done what he did at the behest of the military; taken suppressants, found access to some illicit alpha or beta pheromones, and gone out to the front lines to fight. There were even a few documented cases, soldiers who had come out after the war during the height of the omega rights movement in the 70’s. Steve’s favourite accounting was a famous story of an unbonded omega, Nieves Fernandez, who had gone into heat without access to her suppressants while being held in a Japanese war camp, sending the entire camp into a frenzy. In the ensuing chaos, fifty prisoners were able to escape and make it to safety, including the solider who’d gone into heat. She’d been captured after leading the guerrilla resistance against the Japanese in her native Philippines for the better part of four years. Fernandez finally received some kind of medal for it in the 70’s, years after her dishonourable discharge. She was grinning fiercely in the photos, her arms wrapped around President Jimmy Carter’s shoulders in a hug. The alpha’s expression in the photo where they were shaking hands was tender and full of joy.
“You’re my team,” Steve counters hotly, impotent rage building in him. It’s not for Tony, though, he can admit that much; it’s at himself, and for the people proposing registration at all. He’s furious at everyone for reducing Tony to this state. “I’m supposed to be making the calls. How can I do that when I don’t have all the information?”
He looked a lot less feral than he had at the start. He was glowing, too, less deathly pale. Tony was sitting cross-legged at Steve’s hip, leaning in to feed him, still completely naked. Looking at Tony’s ribs made Steve’s chest hurt; he wondered if he’d been eating enough.
On the big screen, grainy CCTV footage of a green sludge monster smashing its way through Kings Plaza begins to play. Coulson has the good sense to wince.
“I think the American public would like to know what kinds of people they’re living next to, sending their children to school with.”
“I dunno,” Tony says, smiling faintly. “You surprise me about once a week.”
There was a long, long pause at the table.
“What’re we going to the Bronx for?” Steve says, voice a little rough with his accent. It always comes out when he thinks about the old days, and he ducks his head to avoid Tony’s grin.
“Right,” he says, and Steve frowns. That ever-present crease in his brow reforms as he moves closer, then away, hovering awkwardly. He holds his hands up like he’s trying to calm a feral animal.
"Shoot."
Bruce’s mouth twists in scathing amusement. “Ah.”
The cherry blossoms are barely blooming when Steve goes for his run in the morning, but he can see the potential for show-stopping awe there. He thinks about staying for the festival, coming back with bright pastels and his sketchbook, but he knows that’s just a pipe dream. Sam shouts at him good-naturedly as he passes, once, twice, and he grins a little at the old game. It’s peaceful, here, compared to the constant bustle of his city. He’d missed that, a little, in New York.
“Unless, of course, what’s stopping you from healing isn’t magical, but technological,” he says. He’s exhibiting the kind of mania that Steve knows well: too long spent working and too many cups of caffeine. His brain is racing two hundred miles faster than his mouth, the evidence of it shown in how many screens Tony has up and running, the electrodes hooked up to his brain spitting out readings that Friday and him are interpreting and using to recalibrate scans faster than Steve can even parse what he’s looking at.
Steve relaxes a bit, settling back into the seat. “You spoke to Bruce about it, too,” he hedges, and is rewarded with an agreeing shrug from Tony. “Alright. Just…God, Tony, please use your head.”
“Did you absorb Cosmo?” Tony snorts, squinting at the nearest security camera. “Vanity Fair? Seventeen, maybe?”
. Are you crazy?”
Steve walks to the recessed living room and sits, folding his arms over his chest as he watches Tony at the bar. He’s pouring something from a huge, beautiful glass decanter, his fingers graceful as he drops a perfectly round ball of ice into the glass. He’s in a band t-shirt and tatty jeans, his usual dressed-down clothes for when he’s not up to public consumption. He looks exhausted, but also strangely keyed up.
Steve takes a deep breath. He stares up at the basketball, then walks around the tree, looking at where the branches are putting pressure against the skin of it, where force would have to be applied to knock it loose. Then he takes a few steps back, pulls his arm back, and lets the soda can fly.
of nothing. God bless Reed Richards and his whole ridiculous brood.
“Pity,” Rogers said, grinning. “You’ve got such a nice set.”
Eventually, he forgets all about Steve. He’s six hours into an engineering binge, having discarded the idea of perfecting nanites in a timely manner but instead considering if perhaps he could reach out to the mutant community, when something pulls him out of his fugue. He closes his eyes and breathes in deep.
“You know my pa was a drunk?”
Steve lifts his head. There, in the doorway, Tony is staring right at him. The expression on his face is one Steve hasn’t seen before, even in over a decade of friendship. Tony looks…haunted, is really the only word Steve might use to describe it. He looks like he’s seen a ghost.
“You reacted less unfavourably to my presence than I expected,” Loki admits, and Pepper raises an eyebrow at him.
“Gone. They’re all gone, no sign of them.” Rhodey huffs. “Flashy and green teleported them all out. You know we can’t trace that.”
“What if changing what’s been up ‘til now a stable ecosystem negatively affects his condition?”
“I would not do this for an enemy,” Loki says softly. He tilts Tony’s head to see his split lip, and Tony watches with his heart in his throat as Loki’s pupils dilate, one thumb brushing his lower lip ever so slightly as he pushes the pain away, then a little rougher, dragging Tony’s mouth open. Tony can feel goose bumps break over his arms, his breath shallow. “And I would have you well.”
“No, I didn’t mean it like that,” he protested. He turned an apologetic look on Tony, wincing at his expression. “I’m sorry, Tony. I just meant, your bond is unusually strong, even for alpha-omega couples. If there was a way to test it, without endangering either of you, or your bond.” He held up a hand, speaking quickly now. “I know it’s unethical, and I wouldn’t. I’m just saying-”
“We’ll see.” She’s wearing that smug smile that says she’s never wrong. Tony loves and hates that smile in equal measure. He restrains the urge to point out that she just admitted to a mistake, mostly in the interest of keeping all his limbs. “You hardly ever give yourself enough credit when it matters, and too much when you shouldn’t. You’re a genius, Tony. You should be able to figure this out.”
. Tony does not want to do this under the power of some other master. He does not want to give in because he has no choice. He wants to give in because Steve is handsome and glowing, all clotted cream and hair like wheat, eyes sky-blue and unbelievably happy. He wants to let Steve put his wet, red mouth all over his skin, to let Steve mark him up, to let him fuck Tony until he sobs.
“What manner of sorcery does this foe possess?” Thor cuts in, albeit begrudgingly. “I have seen Stark’s armour withstand much.”
“She did provide you with advice,” the AI offers.
Tony sighed, brushing the backs of his fingers over Rogers’ forehead to check his temperature. He was much warmer than he’d been before, some of the colour returning to his cheeks, so that was alright then. He looked miles better than he had when they’d first come in.
He reaches out and puts a hand on the inside of one beautiful trembling thigh, his thumb sweeping into the divot there, pressing into that secret, hollowed out place. The skin is unbearably soft under his calloused finger. It makes him hitch a moan, the sound breaking out of his mouth unbidden.
The heavy thunk of a door stopped him, and he turned around in time to see Clint and Natasha file out from below him. Natasha wasn’t even wearing any shoes, crazy Russian that she was. She and Clint were huddled together, chittering to themselves like children watching a light show. Thor followed a few seconds later, and then Bruce, the only one of them sensibly dressed. Clint, as always, was not wearing a shirt with sleeves.
Tony shakes his head. He shakes his whole body, like a wet dog coming in from the rain. Then he turns back towards the funeral, and Steve is snapped right back next to him, with enough force that he almost crumples to the ground with the potency of his nausea. When he reaches out an instinctual hand to catch himself on Tony’s body, his hand settles on the back of Tony’s neck, and Tony whips around with enough force to knock Steve to the ground.
“Oh,” Tony says. He sucks in a startled breath. “Oh, wait, that’s actually a marvellous idea, Friday-”
Something was shifting over Tony’s face now, first fear, then resignation, then something like calculation. Steve watched as he pulled his pants up, tucking his shirt back in, redoing the button. He watched as Tony reassembled his mask.
Tony wakes up on the sofa with a crick in his neck, disoriented and flailing for his buzzing phone. He’s covered in a blanket that smells faintly of Steve, but he’s too sleepy to be annoyed at the presumption. Instead he tugs it closer around himself and pulls his phone out from his pocket. The screen is aggressively blue in the warm afternoon light.
“Your scent,” Steve says miserably. “I just wasn’t prepared. But if you don’t want to wear your blockers, that’s- I mean, please do whatever you want. I just. I don’t want you to do it because of me. That’s all I’m trying to say. I want you to do whatever you want with your body. I…I get it, now, so if this was to prove a point-”
“I know you’ve got some secret bunker stashed away just for Bruce,” Tony says sweetly, smiling at him. His smile widens when Ross looks alarmed, entirely caught out. “Figure it out, Mr. Secretary.”
Tony watches, adjusting the intensity of the wave and the compression rate. “Oh, that’s messy. Inelegant.” Tony tilts his head to the side, considering. “But, it’s all we got. Do you think, maybe…if we were able to replicate this…?”
“You could leave, at any time. You’re not what he made, not really, not anymore. You’re your own person now.” He smiles a little, melancholy. “That’s what Tony loves about you, most. And also about himself, I think. That he made something so extraordinary. But you choose to stay, to take care of us, even though you could do anything you wanted. Really, anything.”
“I didn’t even get to touch you,” Tony says, shimmying his hips a little to get his pants and boxers back up and over them in one go while his hands are still tied. The look in Steve’s eyes as he watches is nothing short of ravenous.
“I enjoyed everything we did,” Tony insists, and Steve’s beautiful eyes slide back to him. They flicker slightly as Steve studies his mouth, his eyebrows, glancing between his eyes. He looks desperately like he wants to believe him. The capillaries around the edges are broken, the skin pink and slightly swollen. They gleam wetly, still. He looks like he might cry again. “Okay, Cap, how about this. J, go back to the beginning.”
Steve counts out twenty minutes after Tony’s left before trying to shift back to his side, and every minute is excruciating. Because he’s sure, he is absolutely, 100% positive, that he touched Tony that time. He touched Tony without having to make himself sick over it. He hadn’t had to stretch the limits of whatever spell keeps him tied to Tony. He’d just put a hand on his neck, to try to comfort him, and he did. He’s sure that Tony relaxed into his hand. He remembers the feeling of Tony’s warm skin pressed against his, the way the tight tendons of his neck went lax under Steve’s fingers. He knows the sensation so well he can feel the echo of it, tingling down to his wrist like a live wire.
“It sure does, buddy,” Tony had managed, his eyes wide. If they were a little damp, no one called him on it. Not even Sue.
“I’ll come back and say goodnight later,” Steve said, and Tony nodded tiredly at him. “We’ll have lunch brought down for you, too, of course. I’ll send someone. But I should get the penthouse ready.”
“Great,” Tony says. “Just great.”
Tony turned, keeping one arm wrapped firmly around Steve’s waist, a warm hand pressed low on his stomach. “Well seeing as this is my tower Chicken Little, every damn room in the building is my room, so-“
Sam considers this. “There’s another offer on the table.”
Tony was in the common room, exactly where JARVIS had said he’d be. Steve could hear him as soon as he stepped out of the elevator, a long stream of profanities overlaid with Clint’s, and Thor’s usual tirade of insults that none of the Avengers knew how to parse. They were shouting over each other, yelling invectives back and forth, and Steve walked out and folded his arms over his chest to find the three of them and Natasha playing Mario Kart. Tony was in the lead, but only by a hair.
“Steve, it’s not-”
“Do you remember the first time I saw you after Rumiko died?”
“Got it,” Steve said, already spinning the footage back. JARVIS had set it to a 1.5x speed, which was mostly what Steve and Tony preferred when they were poring over battle footage together. JARVIS hadn’t needed to be prompted, because Steve and Tony had a routine. They had a life that they’d built together, complete and mundane and predictable.
“And if they do?”
“Sure,” he agrees. “But just think of all the hot fireman outfits we can get away with.”
Tony let out a whistling breath. “Think I’d have complained about your army ration palate all this time if I could have just done better myself?”
“You think Steve was the main course.”
“I just…can I ask, uh. I never did, because I didn’t want to be rude. But I thought, maybe, it would be okay to ask now.”
“That’s aluminium. The tree is easily twenty feet tall, and there’s a 12 mph wind running down this street.”
“Turns out the serum gives Cap resistance to some mind-altering effects,” Bruce had told him. “Wanda’s powers aren’t actually really telekinetic or telepathic in nature. She can- or. Uh. She
“This stupid curse,” she once told Tony, scowling as she disappeared behind her Coromandel
“You’re right. You left me for dead, didn’t you?”
“Well,” he says, “not that this hasn’t been fun, but why don’t you two get out of here?”
Steve didn’t tell her that the idea of taking suppressants while Tony was kidnapped had felt like giving up. Knowing Natasha, she already knew.
Through a foot of Stark-patented ballistic glass, Steve could see Tony moving around inside the Tank. He was pacing, speaking to himself, although Steve couldn’t hear the words. Inside, there were a few sparse furnishings; a bed, a couch, a chair. Everything in the room was padded with something that helped to absorb and dullen impact, but Steve had been inside out of curiosity and felt it made the whole room seem kind of like a kid’s gym, where everything was soft. Tony had been left with a StarkPad and a chess set, the latter Steve guessed left from Bruce’s visits, the former a recent addition to keep Tony from going crazy. He looked exhausted, and beat-up, and so, so beautiful.
Xavier laughs. “Well, Stark is incredibly open about his PTSD, and anyone who’s taken even the most rudimentary psychology class could diagnose Dr. Banner. I know from the files that much of America has read after you so boldly released them online that it is nigh impossible for Ms. Romanov to be neurotypical after the horrific developmental traumas that she suffered. And I do not imagine that Thor or Mr. Barton could be so different, considering the studies that we have done regarding routine work environment stress and PTSD in police officers. This does not at all conflict with my point.”
“Oh, don’t worry Maria. I’ll be getting to you in a minute,” Tony says with a plastic smile, glancing around the room. A few government cronies, clearly out of their depth, the rocky remains of SHIELD leadership, and a few uncomfortably familiar faces stare back at him with varying levels of chagrin. Maria Hill is the only one who doesn’t look at all cowed, and Tony fixes her with a long stare, trying to read her expression. At least Coulson has the decency to look a little sorry.
“Then I guess we’ve got some explaining to do, huh?”
“Well, this seems to be a pattern,” a familiar voice says, and Tony closes his eyes and tilts his head back to rest against cold metal, huffing a breath. “Perhaps you should keep more civilised company.”
. There is nothing I can’t get that I want. I am always the smartest man in the room. I am always the most powerful. I could kill someone tomorrow and never go to prison. I
“Well,” Reed says, a wry smile playing at the corners of his mouth, “what have you done so far?”
The expression that overtakes Tony’s face is curious, to Steve. Surprise, maybe. He looks up into Peter’s stubborn face with a small smile that’s equal parts trepidation and hope.
Later, Steve would find out that JARVIS had read two remaining life forms in the basement; a pair of kids who’d been necking and got trapped when the quake hit. Tony had tried to make it down into the basement, but the building had been too unstable. The whole entire four story school had toppled with Tony and the two kids inside. One of the kids, a fifteen year old boy, was crushed and killed in the rubble. The other student lost her arm, and Tony had come out with a concussion, several bruised ribs, and a metric tonne of survivor’s guilt to add to the expansive river of it he was already swimming against every day.
“And if I take suppressants?”
Tony blinks, shaking the bleariness from his eyes. “Uh.” He rubs a hand over his face. He’d ask why Steve was awake at this hour, but the overwhelming musk of fight and fear pheromone says more than Steve ever would. “Your body, your choice.”
“I can feel you,” Tony whispers, and Steve smiles against his fingers. “Steve.”
“Steve,” Tony gasps, tugging ineffectually at Steve’s hair. “Steve, I’m-
"I figured." He shrugs. "I can feel him. It's like static electricity, and now it's gone."
“This fight is a bad hand however it lands,” he says. “Is Loki ready?”
“It means that Peter wins the pot,” Pepper laughs, “because he was convinced that you were both too stubborn to do anything about it on your own, and that it would take outside influence. He suspected mind reading, or a truth spell, or something like that. So come on, Tony, what was it?”
“The question is not how much you love your country,” General Mattis says, shaking his head. “As far as I’m concerned, you’re all mad sonofaguns to be doing what you do. You’d have to care a damn sight further than most any American to risk your lives against the kinds of threats we’ve been facing the past few years. Especially a man like you, Stark, who could sit on the sidelines like that snake Hammer and get rich while sending someone else to do your dirty work. But no man is infallible. That’s why we have a balance of power. It’s why the president doesn’t have unilateral control of the country. You can’t just be doing whatever you damn well please, no matter how noble your ideals.”
Steve froze, because Natasha never talked about that. They all knew––they’d all read each other’s files––but she’d never talked about it.
She waltzes into Tony’s workshop with the same aplomb as always: completely sure of her welcome, head held high. She waves a tablet in one hand above her head, her sea-glass eyes bright with excitement.
Loki watches him with a raised eyebrow, expression equal parts irritated and amused. “Oh?”
“Headed to bed so early?”
“I’m sorry,” is the first thing Cap says to him when they’re alone. Tony had done the best he could to avoid this exact set of circumstances, but eventually the rest of the SI employees had to go home. Most of them had their actual jobs to do, and were volunteering time here and there when they could to make the project work. Beth was the only other person who’d been there half as often as Tony, mostly because like Tony, she was high up enough in SI that she was able to delegate her tasks out a bit.
“I said we won’t know more until he wakes up,” Bruce corrects and Tony turns back to him with a quiet kind of wonder building in his chest. He touches Bruce’s temple with two fingers, where the hair has started to turn grey.
Steve laughs, mostly at himself. “I brought a bag, this time. My own clothes and everything.”
cw: for PTSD and panic attacks (y'all should expect this crap from this fic at this point but still, be safe everybody) and a brief mention of underage sex (because we all know Tony was having sex in college despite being wildly underage)
“I served on the front lines of World War Two, infiltrating Hydra Camps where they were engaging in human experimentation,” Steve begins hotly, but Xavier holds up a hand.
I’ve changed Ross into a more…Fox News-esque character than he is in canon, simply because I think that in our current political climate, this is what he would be. Ross is constrained by propriety in canon in a way that politicians no longer are in our world. I’ve tried to shift him into something more suited to our current electorate.
He sat with that knowledge for a long minute, wondering how much Tony must have told him about their relationship. If Bruce was the one monitoring him, there were certain things that doctors had to ask of their patients. Steve didn’t want to think about what that might mean, so instead he stiffened his spine and turned back to the conference table, glancing over the scattered bits of data they’d been sifting through in the last few days to try to pick up Tony’s trail. He focussed on the image of Tony standing in his boxers on a cold street in Cambridge, arms spread to present himself as the biggest target, to block the terrified students behind him from harm.
“J,” Tony groans, “I didn’t tell you to wake her up.”
floor!"
“I was a soldier before I was a superhero, Miss,” Steve said evenly. He pulled the cowl back over his face. “You hear that, Avengers?”
Tony laughs at the mild invective. There’s the man he knows. “I’m feeling pretty smug for a man who’s about to be stuck with an epic case of blue balls, so thanks for that.”
“Rhodey, I swear to fucking God-”
“I’m afraid not, sir.”
Sheepishly, Steve rolls out of bed and moves towards the bathroom door.
“Hormones,” Steve agreed, his voice slurring in his mouth. His throat was sore, a tickle in the back of his throat telling him he’d overdone it. “Why…?”
, and
“Well,” Steve said, ignoring Fury’s sigh, “I’m not an alpha.”
Tony’s brain works like this, sometimes; cataloguing, testing, like he’s observing a subject in a simulation. Teasing the corner of Steve’s mouth with his tongue looses a soft, desperate sound from his throat, makes him tip his head a little, bare his ear and neck to Tony’s teeth. When Tony bites at his jaw, he closes his eyes, hisses a breath, almost relieved. His hand cups Tony’s elbow, as if to keep him close. Steve tastes distinctly human after weeks of nothing but Loki in Tony’s bed: the scent of unearthly forest and pine, the feel of ice under his tongue. Steve is warm salt, pulse and blood, the stomach-heavy musk of a human man sweating in the bright spring sun. Tony licks the salt from his pulse, the line of his sternomastoid, the shadows under his left ear. He wrinkles his nose at the faint taste of soap there, likely left from Steve’s rushed morning ablutions, and they pause for a moment, Tony’s forehead pressed to the hinge of Steve’s jaw. Steve takes a deep breath, his nose half buried in Tony’s hair, lets it out in a warm rush that sends shivers up Tony’s spine.
“You were careful?” Steve asks quietly, but Tony just laughs.
Trans Lifeline: for those in crisis, you can call 1-877-565-8860.
"You want to run for two-?” Sam cuts himself off with a heavy sigh. “Jesus, Steve, I don't even know why I bother."
The alarm sounds.
The man shoots Steve in the chest, and pain blossoms out into a bright flower. It burns everything in its path, crackling out from the core of him until it consumes him from the inside out.
In the years to come, Tony will look back on this day as one of the greatest moments of his life, and not just because of the joy of seeing Steve Rogers in coveralls and a pageboy hat, smiling out at New York City’s green-felted and flag-waving denizens like he was the patron saint of adorable Irish construction workers. No, what he’ll remember forever is the dour face of Stephen Strange, legs crossed, floating petulantly behind Tony’s booth as he wrangles the lights, the music, the colours of the Irish flag flashing up onto the Empire State building’s façade at opportune moments. Stephen’s cloak floats out behind him in a rippling wave, his arms crossed as he glares down at the crowds. He’s not wearing a single stitch of green, and Tony loves him fiercely for being a giant red stain on the drunken Saint Patrick’s Day cheer emanating from the sozzled masses.
“That wasn’t what I asked,” Steve said, knowing he was pushing now. Tony took a deep breath.
“Harpy,” Tony mutters, and Steve smothers a laugh. He swings his feet like a kid where he sits on one of Tony’s tall workbench tables, watching curiously as Tony pulls out an actual phone. It’s an old one, a burner, and Steve raises his eyebrows and scoots a little closer as the dial tone trills against Tony’s ear.
“You’re healing from bond trauma,” Natasha said, watching him, and Steve shrugged. “I started the coffee.”
Steve turns his head to see Charles Xavier approaching in his infamous wheelchair. He holds a hand out.
“Thanks, JARVIS.” The door hisses open. “Come find me as soon as you’re done.”
“I’m coming to you, ETA 5 minutes.”
Steve blinked, considering. He hadn’t thought about that. “And Pepper and Jim?” he said, testing the idea in his head.
“I said-”
“What?”
“I had no idea, until I read about it,” Steve admits. “It’s…it’s horrible, the way things are.”
“JARVIS,” he says, a suspicion building in his chest, “how are my hormone levels?”
“He seems to be attached to me,” Tony muses, and Steve can feel hope building up in him again. “I think…” He touches his chest, right above where the starburst scar Steve knows well sits. “I think he’s tied to me. I think he can’t leave.”
“Parameters exist for good reason. Do countries not have laws?”
“I am grease,” Tony says solemnly. “Grease is in my blood. And besides, my blood toxicity has seen way worse.”
“What is happening?” Tony murmurs, and Steve perks up. He concentrates, willing his hand solid, and tries to touch Tony again. To brush a hand over his shoulder, or ruffle his hair. But as Tony goes through his nightly ablutions, Steve fails, and fails, and fails again. Every time, his hand misses its mark.
“Steve,” Tony gasps. He’s completely shocked, wide-eyed and panting. Moisture gathers at the corners of his eyes. “Fuck, I’m going crazy. I’m- I’m really, I’m really-”
When Steve was a child, church was always sacred. Remote. Clean. It was a place to go to get answers and be told how the world was in absolutes. Wisdom in ancient tongues. There was a part of him, he realised now, that had come here to try to understand how much things had changed to let a man as brilliant and defiant as Tony shine as brightly as he does. The Catholic church is a weathervane of what was acceptable amongst good but mostly socially conservative people. He thinks he’s beginning to see the truth of what Bruce had been trying to tell him before: the future is different, true, and sometimes not being guided by the easy markers of pheromone and instinct is hard. But it's…freeing, too. That was what Bruce had meant, when he’d talked about the advent of omega rights. When Tony talked about it not mattering. It's about being free to love whoever they want,
When he steps out onto the landing pad, Steve is sitting on the edge of the roof. He’s paying absolutely no mind to the precipitous drop below him. In his lap is a sketchbook: familiar terrain. His hands move over the page in confident lines, smooth arches. Every part of him is carefully controlled, and Tony knows from experience that this is Steve trying to pour himself onto the page. He hasn’t quite figured out what the trick is to knowing when Steve will turn to the gym or the studio. They seem to soothe different hurts in him. If pressed, Tony might say that Steve turned to art when his feelings were too complex to excise through short bursts of violence. Anger, frustration, sex: these were things that Steve could translate into physical motion, could transmute into energy and push through his skin as sweat. It was things like saudade or bewilderment that perfused into Steve’s blood and settled there like a lead weight, poisoning him from the inside.
With the benefit of hindsight, Steve can now say that is the true horror of how the Civil War had happened between them. For the second time in his life, Steve hadn’t been willing to listen. He’d put his foot down. The first time he’d done it, he’d almost lost Tony down a bottle, and to this day he still regrets giving up so easily. Images of his own father drunk and angry had crawled up out of his past like a monster, blinding him. He’d left Tony alone in that horrible place. He’d let him end up on the streets.
Steve considers. He frowns, thinking of what Pepper said about how he views Tony, how wrong he is about him. “You said Tony had high standards, too.”
“Jesus,” Steve laughs, offering Tony an incredulous look. “What the hell, Stark?”
know you. I know who you are, and I could be good for you. I could be so good for you if you let me. I know I could. Just let me try again-”
Steve stared at him for a long moment. He felt himself settling, the piece in him that had been humming in panic since he’d been woken up by JARVIS’ firm, worried voice that morning slipping down into his stomach like lead.
“What aren’t you telling me?” Tony says, quiet. He watches, curiosity smoothing his face into a flat mask as he tries to puzzle him out. Loki’s hands are trembling on the glass, and after a minute Tony takes it from him and places it on the coffee table, not bothering with a coaster for now. The laugh that bubbles out of Loki’s throat is near hysterical, and Tony swallows, reaches for him. “Jesus, babe, come here.”
“Can I ask for a sitrep?” Steve asks.
“You’ll start with onions,” he said, and Tony nodded and went to fetch the bag.
"Why me?" Tony asks, and Loki's mouth twists into something complicated.
“Tony,” he whines, and the water isn’t even the right temperature but he can’t manage to change it. He thinks of the flex of Tony’s abdominals under a sheen of sweat, remembers the feeling of Tony’s wrists pressed to his neck, his pulse strong under Steve’s fingers, and the second wave of his orgasm hits him so hard he has to sit down on the bench in the shower. He’s never used it the whole time he’s lived in this apartment, but it sure is coming in handy now. “Holy Christ.”
“That person is clearly not in their right mind,” he deadpanned. The crowd cackled. “You know this is gonna be front page tomorrow, Cap.”
“I had to fight these animals off with my bare hands,” Tony agreed, throwing the controller up in the air and screaming in triumph as he crossed the finish line. “That’s three! I
Steve heard them anyway, and nodded tightly. His hands were shaking, whether from want or exhaustion he didn’t know. He clenched his fingers, ducked his head, and stepped out into the light.
for a
He takes his duffel bag and his shield up to his rooms and changes out of his clothes, then hops straight into the shower. He still doesn’t know where Tony is. He hopes that JARVIS would tell him if something happened, but he doesn’t really know what the protocol for that kind of thing is. In the old days, a soulmate would have automatically gotten rights to any medical information about their Bonded. But he and Tony aren’t Bonded, not really. They haven’t announced anything. There’s no bite mark in Steve’s neck, even if Steve’s body feels like it’s on fire every single time Tony touches him. He doesn’t even know if he can keep a Bond Bite, anyway. He’s never scarred before.
The first, completely absurd thought that trickles into Steve’s mind as he tries to keep out of Logan’s way. And then,
“Tony,” Steve says again. He sits next to Tony on the bed, curling his body around Tony as best he can without touching him. He can’t bear to have his hand pass through Tony right now. “Tony…”
“That doesn’t make it right,” Steve argues hotly, but Xavier just turns that same beatific smile on him.
Tony can relate. As good as it feels to mark Steve, his chest feels like it’s going to break open. There’s no coming back from this, not really. There’s no exit strategy, no parachute. Just the long fall into Steve, until Tony can’t fight him anymore. Until he’s subsumed. Overcome.
“Are you…are you serious right now?” he asked, genuinely baffled. “You really want me to make you breakfast. Right now.”
Tony pauses, turning to glance at Rhodey. “What about her?”
“I could ask someone to bring us something hot,” Tony mused. “Put it through the hatch. I think the worst of the fugue’s passed.”
Steve shut his eyes, shaking his head, and Tony sighed and wrapped his arms around his waist. His fingers slid under the back of Steve’s shirt, pressing into the dimples there. Tony had always loved those. He liked to press his nose into them, his thumbs when he was fucking Steve from behind.
“War and trauma like that can change a man. You feel weak, and guilty for your weakness. You want to be better than you are. But there is no better. You are who you are. Peace comes from accepting pain, using it for good.”
"No," he says, disbelieving.
“You might be fired. I haven’t decided yet,” he says flatly. “Either you work for The Avengers, or you work for SHIELD, but you can’t do both.”
“May I?”
“It’s not,” Steve says, serious now. He leans in until their foreheads knock together, nose gently brushing against Tony’s. “I almost can’t believe this. I thought-… I kinda thought you knew, and were just…ignoring it, or-”
He waits until the workshop door slides shut behind him to swear, softly. Then he takes off towards the kitchen.
Durbin frowns at him, but he looks more wry than truly irritated.
Steve can understand that quite well. He can imagine it easily, three of his favourite people holed up in a safehouse somewhere, chatting over beer and greasy takeout while Tony works on Bucky’s arm. The thought warms him, and he reaches out and squeezes Tony’s arm. He leans down, precarious, and presses his face to Tony’s temple. He smudges a kiss against his handsome cheek.
“Tony,” Beth says warningly, a tone Tony remembers well from when they were together. It’s a tone that means that either he does things the easy way, or Beth will
He breathes out, carefully, and goes back to his crossword, but the letters blur on the page in front of him. His hands are shaking, he realises, and he closes his eyes and takes a slow breath, counting to ten.
“Fuck.”
The rustle and clack of Pepper moving somewhere at full speed with her entourage stops immediately. “Tony, what’s going on?”
He braces his elbows on his knees, his head in his hands, and for once he is glad that there is no one to hear him scream.
“Fuck this,” Steve says, surprising himself with the anger in it. He takes a deep breath. He steels himself.
Steve takes a slow breath, but he can’t smell anything. The expensive herb and wood smell of Tony’s shampoo is just a memory.
“So,” he says, and then pauses, glancing around the table as though begging someone to interrupt him. His gaze snags on Natasha, but her face remains impassive, and finally he lets out a quiet huff of air and wets his lips, turning to Tony with an expression that makes him want to bolt from the table and straight down into the workshop. “Xavier said I haven’t got any of Amora’s influence left rattling around inside my skull.” Steve’s voice is all Brooklyn as he taps at his own temple, a little rough with nervousness, and Tony blinks at him and waits for the penny to drop. No one at the table seems at all surprised or even intrigued by this information, which means they’d discussed it before he showed up.
Thor kicks him into the wall, all of the breath punching out of him at once. Clint jumps on top of him and is thrown off almost immediately, Natasha running out of the jet, and Tony is bracing himself for another blow when Thor is literally frozen to the spot, ice blasting him and sending curls of white mist tumbling out into the room like he’s made of dry ice.
“Says the man who punched me in a blind rage with his super strength.”
Tony laughs. He can’t help it. “A burden, huh?”
“You wanna talk about lying? I lied to you for years. I wanted to tell you, but I was terrified that you’d hate me for it. You came out because you hated the lie that the American government had manufactured for you; Steve Rogers, America’s greatest alpha. I figured, why would you want me if you found out I was a phony? But then when you mentioned marriage, I thought, maybe it doesn’t matter. Maybe you’d love me anyway. I wanted to tell you then, but-”
“Mr. Barton is on the target range with Ms. Romanov. Thor is having a meal in the common area. They seem agitated, but not overly so.”
Rogers’ grin was wry, but he opened his mouth for the next spoon Tony offered him. They sat together like that until the bowl was finished, Rogers opening his mouth for the spoon. One of his broad palms made its way to rest on Tony’s knee. When he was done, Tony stayed, finishing his own bowl. It was edible, but something about it tasted wrong. Tony wasn’t sure what he’d done, but it didn’t taste like the chuck wagon stew Rogers always made when he came by for dinner. Something about the spices, maybe.
, he thinks, sipping the last of his share of the whiskey. He knows exactly how this night is going to end.
“Sure I do,” Steve agreed, and Tony laughed, startled at the admission. “You’re one of my best friends.”
“You and he have gotten better at communication, but not so much better that this situation could pass without violence,” she tells him. “I would like to avoid the stupidity of emotionally constipated white men, and instead focus on you regaining your memories so we can go back to trying to locate Thanos and the stones and reverse what he did to our world. So now I have told you, and you can choose what to do with the information.” She tilts her head to the side, a small smile playing around the corners of her mouth. “But you are not a cruel man, so perhaps I have expectations of how you might handle me telling you something like this.”
“You cannot face him,” Loki says, grave. His eyes dart meaningfully to Tony’s chest, to the reactor, and Tony covers it with a hand without thinking. He taps his fingers against the crystal casing. “You must destroy his machine, and perhaps even his mind. To let him escape unscathed is to let him fight another day.”
“Since the invasion of the dark elves upon Midgard, my father had been strengthening his alliances with the rest of the nine realms. He has encouraged increased trade, and travel between realms. He set up an exchange of scholars, that there might be shared information and increased learning among not only our people but that of our allies, which has allowed us to repair the bifrost with more speed than we might have without. Jane and Erik Selvig were a great part of that. He had become a diplomat, of sorts, which had always been my mother and Loki’s realm much more than his. I thought perhaps our mother’s death had changed him.”
“This is all real rational of you,” Clint says, making his way through his fourth serving of whiskey, “but come on, you’re full of shit. We both know you’re fucked up about it. Come on. Bottoms up. Let’s go.”
Tony blinks, hands freezing in the middle of scrubbing his nail beds. “What?”
