Steve closed his eyes and let the words wash over him. It hurt to think about. He'd been sure for a few moments that he was going to leave Tony and everyone else behind. He hadn't been sure, for the first time since he flew into the ocean, that he was going to make it. "I know, baby. I'm sorry, but it wasn't a screw up. You didn't do anything wrong, Tony. You did what was best for everybody. We saved three people that might've... I don't really want to think about what SHIELD would've done if we couldn't save them, actually. We fixed it, and that's pretty amazing. And I'm still right here. You're not the only one that always finds a way out."
Tony made sure he got between Fitz and the food and grabbed hold of Steve for a hug and an appreciative kiss before grabbing his own. "Thanks, beautiful," he said with a grin. More quietly, he asked, "You okay?"
"I'd have to agree," Tony muttered. Coulson could be unnerving, anyway. The man had a strange confidence about him that belied his somewhat nerdy, almost bookish appearance. The billionaire still hadn't forgotten their first interaction and the rather persuasive threats the agent had used to convince him to stay put in his mansion and solve the puzzle SHIELD had given him. Glad to note Coulson was gone, Tony grinned a little and leaned up to nibble at Steve's stubbly throat. "Y'know, if I hadn't pinky promised to be good, I'd definitely give you a BJ right here, right now," he muttered. He sighed. "I hate talking to the press. Can I just hang on your arm and look pretty?"
Logan was busy taking in the sight of Nat in nothing but some very incredible looking underwear. The woman was all hard lines and grace, feminism and deadly strength all rolled together in perfect, equal measure. When he finally caught up to the question, he shrugged, glancing at Scott. "Think I'd rather wing it." He smiled faintly. "Few too many options to ask me to commit to somethin', darlin'," he said, closing distance on the two and hooking an arm around each waist. He gave Nat a pointed look before his lips attacked Scott's neck, making it a point to suck on those perfect spots he knew would make the man squirm. At the same time, he slid two fingers into the lacy string of Nat's underwear right where it passed over her hip, not wanting her to feel ignored. He was showing off a bit, not in the least because he had a feeling she enjoyed the idea of him fucking Scott as much as the idea of one of them fucking her.
"Fair enough," Logan said, unable to keep from rolling his eyes when a car that looked like it was worth two houses worth of money rolled up.
"No offense, Thor, but I'm not sure we're up to that just now," Steve agreed gently. As good as it felt being around his teammates, drinking and carousing wasn't something he felt physically capable of it. The pain was too fresh, too raw. He couldn't even get through a single meal without breaking down in tears yet. "I need to talk to Director Fury. You should all relax, do whatever it takes to get you in the game." He paused, gaze sweeping over them all before finally resting on Clint. "Thank you. All of you. We all know this has been a mess from top to bottom, but we're not out of the game yet. He won't get away with it this time."
"The X-Jet." Bruce shrugged when Clint looked at him questioningly. "You didn't read the file? Do you ever read the file?"
Tony smirked as the lube was pushed into his hand. "Definitely," he agreed, but he took a moment to mark Steve a third time before he palmed some of the lube. Instead of going for more obvious targets, though, he first trailed slick fingers across Steve's chest, taking the time to gently - and then not-too-gently - pinch and tweak Steve's nipples. The blonde was obviously enjoying a little edge in his pleasure, and Tony was more than happy to provide it. He nipped at his lover's jaw as his hand trailed lower, slick fingers closing firmly around Steve's cock. Tony intended to keep his promise, but he planned to take his time on getting to it.
Apparently aware enough to realize that everyone was safely out of the room, Hulk flung Loki to the far end, then roughly scooped Steve up and charged out with barely enough clearance for him to move through the hallway. As the group retreated, Banner managed to calm himself back into a normal person.
"The fact that you don't have glass ground into your skin right now says otherwise," Steve countered, "and did I mention the singed hair smell?" He pressed a sloppy kiss to Tony's lips and rolled reluctantly away to get them a damp towel. It took a few minutes, but soon they were both more or less clean. Steve resumed his place pressed happily against Tony's side again. "Now I'm going to sleep. So are you." He batted at the hand already reaching for Tony's tablet. "No. Sleep." Steve put his head on Tony's shoulder and an arm across his midsection, effectively pinning his lover. "G'night."
Clint could feel his passenger's eyes on him, though he stayed focused on his flying. "Thing is, SHIELD has a tendency to keep an eye on technology and experiments which could be used against us. Maybe you're a small time crook, but that thing in your brain? You'd probably shit yourself if you knew how many organizations want to capture you and cut your head open," he said casually. He glanced back, keen blue eyes giving the other man a long look. "That aside, I couldn't guess why Fury wants you. He may have something specific in mind, or he may just want to make sure you're safe... and that we're safe from you." Aside from questionable taste in hairstyles, the guy wasn't hard on the eyes. //Nice build, nice jaw... And you need to focus on the mission,// he reminded himself, turning his gaze back to the instrument panel. //Another ten minutes, and we can land and I can take a nice, cold shower.//
"It's less accurate than you'd hope," Nat returned with a sigh. If their last encounter with Loki was any indication, the man had no problem at all being in two places at once.
Eyes fluttering momentarily closed, Loki still reached out and gripped the hem of Tony's shirt. He tugged insistently and, when it still wasn't off fast enough, tore himself away fromStark's questing lips to jerk the man free of the shirt. His eyes were a shade darker than normal, expression intent as he took the view in. It was different, somehow, seeing Tony bared willingly for him. He rose for a moment, slipping gracefully from the bed and slithering free of his pants before rejoining the man on the bed. "Perhaps you should consider doing the same," he suggested in a smooth whisper.
Tony arched his neck into Loki's mouth, his chest into the hands teasing his chest. The mortal muffled his soft sounds of pleasure against Loki's skin until the god's tongue dragged against a sensitive spot, drawing a long, low moan from him. He gasped an affirmation and let blunt nails rake down the god's back as Loki rode him. Tony was amazed by the visceral response Loki's moans drove from him, the genuine pleasure the god seemed to be drawing from the encounter.
"If you can stop choking for a few seconds," Natasha replied as if the entire scene hadn't been one of the funniest things she'd seen in months. Clint was surprisingly easy to wind up. Pleasantly so, really. "Better? You sure?" She caught Clint's eye and nodded slowly once he affirmed his readiness. "Well, I told you I knew he liked guys because I ran into him when he was out on a date with one. Finding out he likes girls was a lot more... direct."
"It's alright," Bruce said, passing the barista his card before Jemma could beat him to it. "You'll just have to make it up by letting me pay." Once they'd settled in to wait for their drinks, Bruce raised an eyebrow at Jemma. "So, aside from being an incredible genius, how'd you end up with SHIELD?"
Logan moaned as Scott arched against him. Watching his lover's toned, perfectly muscled body writhe in all the right ways was something Logan couldn't get enough of. His free hand lightly teased Scott's cock, touching and stroking and doing everything he could to make his lover as desperate as possible. "You look so fucking good like this. Love it when you're needy," he growled, nipping roughly at Scott's chest.
The doctor nodded to the call button near Steve's hand. "I'm going to give you a little time, but you need rest." He met Coulson's gaze, not even bothering to try to convince Tony Stark to do the practical thing. "Be sure to give him some."
Though he'd felt bad at the idea of pushing the man out of a public space, Steve was visibly relieved to have Darien gone. "Tony had some files on Logan, stuff that went back to SHIELD's founding days. Turns out Logan moved an artifact back in the day, some hammer that's like an evil version of Thor's. He didn't know where, said somewhere cold... it's not a lot to go on," Steve admitted with a sigh. He leaned back against the counter with his arms crossed. "I was thinking maybe we shouldn't go this alone. Maybe we should reach out to the X-Men. They know the people we're going up against."
Steve nodded and lifted the gun. He breathed deeply and ran through the sequence of buttons precisely as Tony had instructed him. It wasn't a complicated process, but he did everything deliberately. If they only had one chance, he wouldn't risk doing something wrong. The jolt of power took him by surprise just the same. It felt as if the blast was moving through him more than through the gun, and Steve stumbled for a second. The beam of dark energy remained more or less level, and he watched as Natasha's eyes widened. Steve realized that he'd never really seen her surprised before. The closest thing he could think of to compare the way he felt was when he was younger and in the grip of a bad asthma attack. His chest tightened painfully, his arms shaking until he finally had to stop.
More than anything in that moment with Tony lying there with his hair messy and his eyes bleary, Steve wanted to crawl into bed beside him and just collapse. Instead, since that was inappropriate on so many levels he couldn't even be bothered to count them, Steve sank into the chair next to the bed. His shoulders slumped, and he didn't bother trying to look upbeat. Quietly he recounted everything they knew, everything about it being Hydra somehow and Bucky being alive and about them having no clue what was happening. "I asked Director Fury to call Bruce in. If we... if it is Bucky and we can fix this somehow... he's the smartest person we have next to you," Steve finished with his first flicker of a smile. "Right now we wait and I do everything I can to keep you safe."
Tony followed the moving blur that he knew was Loki with a glare. He was trying to figure out what, exactly, the god was getting at. "Submit? Like more of that baloney act in Stuttgart?" If pretending to worship Loki was all it took to get Barton and Coulson out of jail free, then Tony was pretty sure he could swallow his pride and manage it, but that seemed way too simple for Loki. Something else the god had said caught up with Tony. "What do you mean 'play nice'?"
Logan shook his head and suppressed a faint grin. Stark was as deeply apathetic toward societal norms as the press would have everyone believe. He wondered, though, what Steve thought "us" meant. The guy was, naturally, old-fashioned in a lot of his worldview, and Stark clearly didn't know the meaning of the word "commitment." //Then again, I don't exactly have a great track record in that department.//
Logan gave Scott's hand a gentle squeeze, pressing his lips to the man's knuckles. "I can do that. Well... I will do that," he assured, standing and pulling Scott into a quick kiss. "I'm all about givin' you some space, but it don't mean I'm gonna give you breathin' room," he joked, giving Scott a quick wink. It felt good, having the man to himself, having time to himself. He didn't want to miss a second of it, but he knew that Scott was right. Livin' in each other's back pockets ain't good for anyone. "Promise me, though, that you'll call me in if you need anything. At all." He couldn't help feeling protective of Scott, especially considering Loki's visitation. The idea that the god might decide to drop in again gave Logan chills.
Scott knew he couldn't keep what he was thinking from Logan forever, not when the man knew him so well. They might not have been friends all along, but maybe even because of that, they'd watched one another closely. Scott held out his arm. The bruises on his wrist were darker than they'd been earlier that day, easily visible against his skin. "Agent Coulson didn't do this to me," he pointed out in the steadiest tone he could manage. "Are you sure there isn't anything wrong?"
Fury's gaze drifted to Tony. "I'll get to that in a minute. Glad you're not dead. Assuming you're you, and not some sort of Asgardian voodoo standing in my office."
Scott's whole world narrowed in to focus on the kiss and the taste of Logan on his tongue. He couldn't help but glance down at Natasha sucking his lover like her life depended on it, and Scott moaned into the kiss.
Logan made a soft sound of arousal as the woman's tongue started working his cock. "Fuck..." he murmured, watching Nat's tongue working over his shaft like it was the only thing she'd wanted all evening. He'd already been turned on, and it didn't take much to get him to full hardness. Tearing his eyes away from Nat, Logan caught sight of Scott watching them, his blue eyes so dark it was unreal. Not above showing off for his lover as well as their guest, Logan let his eyes flutter shut and his head fall back a bit, moaning his pleasure as his hips rocked into Nat's attentions.
Coulson pointedly ignored the self pity. “You haven’t spoken to the rest of the team much, but I doubt it’s a surprise to you to hear that they aren’t particularly thrilled to have you in the tower. You don’t remember what happened with Stark, but they do. They’re not bad people, but it’s hard for them not to hold it against you.” He waited a beat for the words to sink in. “Given that, Captain Rogers has still spent almost every waking moment when he’s not on duty with you. He moved rooms to be close to you - despite what the rest of the team, Stark in particular, might think about that.” Coulson raised his eyebrows and smiled faintly. “Are you sure he wouldn’t notice?”
It hadn't helped that Steve had gone directly to sickbay with Tony, but Clint couldn't blame the man. If it had been Nat... Well, she'd stayed at his side, even after he'd tried to kill her.
Simmons frowned, but she couldn't disagree. Tony was right. If they weren't willing to give everything they had to save Earth from Loki's crazy schemes, no one would be. Her slight shoulders sagged, and she nodded. "Right. Yes. Right. We just work faster, then," she determined, squaring her shoulders again and raising her chin with the faintest hint of a smile. "I hope you'll forgive me, but I'm not explaining to Captain Rogers why I let his boyfriend use an unstable, untested weapon when we had a better option." She nudged Fitz and flashed him a real smile. "Let's make a better option."
On top of his general malaise at the prospect of the networking, there was the distraction he'd been fighting for what felt like an eternity. Tony Stark: son of Howard Stark, total ass, arrogant bastard, genius, playboy and... and Steve couldn't quite put his finger on it. He couldn't quite understand exactly why he couldn't get the other man out of his head. Or wouldn't let himself. It wasn't the first time he'd been so fixated on someone, and to his shame, that fixation had never been for Peggy. He'd cared for her, even found her attractive, but it hadn't ever been what it was supposed to be, what it should have been with someone so wonderful and smart and gorgeous.
Tony turned in his wheelchair, quirking an eyebrow at them. "So this is legit? Not another weird fetish thing?"
"Could definitely do without the audience," Logan agreed. While he'd fooled around in a few dark bar corners in his life, blatant exhibitionism wasn't Logan's thing, especially when it was someone he cared about. Too much of Logan's life had been gone through without his permission, and something so private was staying private if he had anything to say about it. Leaning up, he licked and nipped at Scott's collarbone, his hands sliding down the back of his lover's boxers, gently kneading the man's ass, mindful of his bruises.
There was no mistaking the husky rasp of Clint's voice. It was the sexiest thing he'd heard in a long time, all the more so because it reminded him of Clint fresh from sleep. "You too. I think Nat was selling you short." He regretted at once bringing her up. He didn't want Clint thinking about Natasha when they were hip to hip and moving in a distinctly inappropriate manner together. Even if it was just a dance, he intended to enjoy it fully.
Scott heard himself actually whimper in response, but he didn't particularly care. He just let Logan fuck him while his eyes drifted closed. The desperation was rising, and soon Scott's eyes flew open again. They locked at once on Logan's face, trailing over the sweat as it made a path down to the man's neck and the powerful muscles straining. He reached between their bodies and gave his cock a few harsh strokes. That was all it took before Scott came. His lips went slack beneath Logan's while his body went tight, squeezing Logan's cock hard inside him.
"C'mon Strange, you're keeping a scientist away from his science. A mechanic away from his mechanisms. A-"
Tony crouched on the counter, with broom in hand held like a sword and a colander as a helmet on his head.
Nat looked up, ecstatic. The light shone on her face and her smile grew as wide as the Atlantic Ocean.
She placed Tony on the counter while she washed her hands, ready to bake the recipe. Tony let his adorably stubby legs sway back and forth absently and Nat took the opportunity to flick water droplets at him in between his daydreaming!
The response seemed to be enough for Tony though, Steve gathered, because the blonde caught the small nod that Tony gave himself, as if saying,
Waiting in line at the hospital cafeteria, Natasha caught sight of Dr Strange sitting by a table. He drank a cup of coffee absently while going over some paperwork. Seeing as the line wasn't going to ease up any sooner, she made her way over to him.
"Relax Rogers, I'm not going to bite your head off. God knows you've probably had enough of that. I just wanna know how you are? How you're taking this? I know this might come as a shock to Bucky as well."
'Alphas,' he thought. But a little tingle went through his heart nonetheless at the thought of Steve being jealous of other Alphas in Tony's life.
The rest of the afternoon was spent with the pair of superheroes stuffing their faces with pancakes and ice-cream and binging cartoons and Disney. Tony was the sole occupant of his Aunt Natasha's lap and Nat would fondly ruffle his hair each time he snuggled closer. Tony won thrice at every type of boardgame which also led to him learning a whole new bunch of new Russian swear words!
Tony hissed and arched higher into the touch. Steve rolled Tony's balls between his fingers while he continued to mark Tony's throat. Tony felt so hot and flushed. His senses were screaming
The next thing he knew, the gorgeous brunette glanced in his direction and the two locked eye-contact.
“Sweetheart, don’t you think it’s a little self-absorbed to refer to yourself like that?” Steve deadpanned.
Tony kept his distance from Steve as they walked to the blonde's floor of the new facility. He wasn't so paranoid as to actually walk
Putting on his lop-sided grin, Tony spoke again, "Secondly, the engine parts are new and uniquely branded to Fury's, and I've seen enough engines in my life to know when Fury recommends one of his workers to their first street race."
He snaked his hands over Steve’s abs seductively, but Tony quickly brought Steve’s body close to his own for a hug, breathing in his boyfriend’s scent.
"I'll be yours forever!" Steve whispered once more as he leaned down again to capture Tony's lips into a deeper, more passionate and heated kiss!
He rubbed his face tiredly, “I’ve always been at my wit’s end looking after Tony, so this ain’t new. What’s new every time is the cause behind it and the cause is, that the two of you cannot keep living separately from each other. Especially when it’s on bad terms. It’s chaos for the both of you and for those around you. And I know you’ve got stuff to sort out, but neither of us can take the first step for you guys.”
Sweeping away his forehead curls and giving Tony one last kiss on his forehead, Natasha settled down to sleep once more- her arms wrapped securely around her cub.
The former red-head assassin looked forlornly at the ground. She always hated this part of the mission.
**Take note of that sharp pain I wrote Steve experiencing in the last bit and the connection of their bond! Some subtle foreshadowing...
So, I'm kinda going off the Marvel timeline a bit, but I'm fairly certain that Tony's arc reactor is removed in Iron Man 3, so this takes place way back in 2013 after that surgery and after the events of Iron Man 3. It's like a cute, in-between moment between the canonical movies. (Edit - there obviously will be a Chapter 2 posted asap!)
"It would be amazing!" Fitz exclaimed only to quail slightly at the looks the other three fixed on him. "Scientifically, I mean. It would be... it would be fascinating scientifically."
Tony gasped and shivered at the other man's touch. His mind trapped in a haze due to the truth serum, Tony could not think clearly. "I... I want to... fuck him... fuck him so hard he screams my name..." Unable to control himself, he was revealing things he'd only ever dreamed of, and the thought of bending Steve Rogers over, devouring that perfect ass, and fucking him into submission made Tony Stark hard as the Iron Man suit he'd built.
Phil jumped up and was ready to fight before his body had time to register that doing so hurt like hell. It didn't stop him from remaining tense and poised within reach of the pair. "Slept like a baby," he answered, breathing heavily from the shot of adrenaline but maintaining a perfect poker face. It wasn't the time to show just how bad things were inside. He clung to the idea of their eventual escape and his eventual and inevitable opportunity to tear Creed limb from limb. In the meantime, it was about the two of them maintaining enough strength and sanity to survive it all and come out on the other side.
Logan drew a wad of bills from his pocket, but didn't quite let J take hold of it. "I get it back if I don't like what I see."
"Let it never be said I stood in the way of your plans." Steve took his place, a wicked gleam in his eyes as he grabbed Tony by the hips. The close quarters meant they'd have to be careful even with Tony spread out - he was right about a concussion not being a pleasant end to the evening. Inch by inch, he sank into the man's body. Steve watched as Tony went from confident to barely holding on. He loved it. Steve knew it was a look he could get used to. It worried him to realize that maybe on some level he already had. Tony Stark was too addictive for it to be good for either of them.
Clint tilted his head at the pair. "I'm sorry, are you two even old enough to drive?" he asked, already feeling overwhelmed by Simmons' bubbly enthusiasm. He'd heard of the two in passing, had assumed indeed that they were one entity and that that entity was at least Tony's age given the accomplishments he’d heard along with the name.
Tony nodded, still chilled from the way Loki had smiled at him. He definitely knew what a mouse felt like when a cat had it in its grips. "Yeah. More or less." He looked the plate of food over. He wasn't hungry. If anything, he was a bit nauseous, but he knew he needed food, that the upset stomach was in his head. He helped himself to a bit of bread and fruit, hoping it would be enough to calm his stomach. "Just the sketchy details. Fury's not a real giving sorta guy. Sounds like you don't really need 'Midgard' that much."
"You say that like there's a corner of El Paso that isn't shitty," Phil answered, looking around. He felt dizzy from the thought that they were alone and free. The wilderness he could deal with. They both knew how to survive worse than a shirtless night out in the desert. With Victor out of the way, he breathed in deeply. There weren't any fumes hanging in the air, which meant they were farther from a busy road than he liked. With no food or water, they only had so much energy to expend. Knowing that if there was an advantage to be caught visually, Clint would catch it, he pressed, "See anything promising?"
It was a brave move, one that Loki heartily approved of. "Very nice." He carefully shrugged off his robe. "I appreciate your lack of hesitation. Restraint is overrated." He paused, glancing down at his clothing. "In which case, I suppose drawing this out is foolish." Never taking his eyes off of Victor's face, Loki unlaced the shirt further and stripped it off to reveal flesh beneath so pale it almost glowed and leaving him in only a pair of tight black pants embossed with runes. Growing up Loki had never been particularly comfortable with his body. It was too different from the warriors constantly parading around him. Once he learned why he was so different, he had stopped trying to be like anyone else and embraced the things about him that set him apart from the others.
This chapter starts out with the world's most dubious of dubcon. Mind control, folks - it's not awesome. Skip that if you need to, but the rest is solid plot. Note that there are now 20 chapters instead of 19 since I broke one of them down a little differently than intended. Either way, we're almost there for part one!
Fury gave Tony a look that said he was exercising every last ounce of his very limited patience. "And you're plan B. You better not use that plan, because I really can't spare any more Avengers."
Perception was one of Clint's gifts. Maybe he had no superpowers per se, but a long life of marksmanship, combat training, and field experience had given him razor-sharp instincts when it came to details and signals. "You seem like you've got a lot on your mind," he noted. It was a subtle hint: you can talk or you can agree and leave it at that.
"Lucky for me, I have a lot of that on my hands," Bucky replied, returning Steve's smile with a soft grin of his own. He hated himself for feeling jealous, for wanting to keep Steve all to himself. The more he pushed, the needier he acted, the further away Steve would go. Taking a breath, Bucky reluctantly waved his best friend on his way. "I promise I'll be a good boy and behave," he said. "But, only if you promise not to worry about me and have a nice time." Saying that was painful. Bucky hid it well though, adding, "Maybe Agent Coulson will drop by and keep me company."
I love the three of them as friends. I love them supporting each other. It's not an exaggeration to say this is one of my favorite chapters of the whole series even though it's pretty simple.
Tony smiled broadly. He hadn't wanted to ask, hadn't wanted to push Steve into something he might find uncomfortable. The guy was already out if his element. He pulled Steve into another kiss, daring to pull the blonde fully into his lap for the moment. Drawing away, he purred, "Absolutely I want to keep it. I didn't heal up just to sit around and hold hands."
"You could remind me. We could record it. I have a smartphone," Tony pointed out, leaning up a little more, leaving very little space between them. Part of him wanted to just drag Steve down enough to seal the deal, but he held back. Part of the fun, after all, was the chase. That, and having to stand on his tiptoes to take charge might have been a little humiliating. "Or, y'know, we could just do it again in the morning if you don't mind hangover breath."
Though she couldn't exactly disagree with the words, it hurt to think of. Simmons ducked her head and pretended to be typing something. Being with SHIELD was different than she'd thought in so many ways. The technology was fantastic, and so were the opportunities. The potential to watch people she liked die was simply a lot higher than what she was comfortable with. "We'll find something that works," she assured softly. "I don't think I'd like to be the one to tell Captain Rogers we don't have a better option."
"We'll get Creed in holding," Coulson included Logan in the invitation with a glance, "and then get the hammer in storage again." He wasn't willing to say that they wouldn't need it again considering the uncertain situation with Loki, but he knew they needed to get it the hell away from Clint before things got worse.
In the wake of the spell, Frigga sagged, looking ready to fall over, and Sif closed in to bolster her without a word. Natasha swept her gaze to the Hulk, glad to see he was holding himself in for the moment. She hoped that if things went well, they'd have Bruce back in short order. "So," she ventured after a brief silence, "long time no see." The woman squared her shoulders and took a tentative step closer. If Thor really wasn't back to himself and decided to lash out, she preferred taking the hit to leaving Frigga or Sif in the path of destruction. They both had a better chance of taming an angry Thor in the end than she did herself. "I think we need to have a nice, long talk not involving so much punching. What d'ya say?"
Clint nodded, swallowed hard, and gave Phil's hand a squeeze. Normally, it wasn't that difficult to debrief. Then again, normally he and his handler didn't get abducted by a psychotic, superhuman rapist. "I got dragged out of the vent, sir. Creed sliced it open with his claws - they're metal, and that's not in his file, by the by - and pulled me out. He had me by the armor, so I had to squirm out of it. We fought some more. Arrows aren't real good against a guy that heals that fast. He managed to get hold of me, made Ph -  Agent Coulson drop his weapon. Then he used some kind of tech to take us out of there. Probably something Loki gave him." His frame tensed even more, and he looked ready to fight or run as he took another deep breath. "He kept us and..." He trailed off, looking away and swallowing hard, unable to continue.
Coulson smiled faintly at that. "So long as Mr. Stark behaves himself." He glanced down at the phone in his hand and tapped at the screen. "Be dressed and ready in an hour. I'll have a small selection of reporters here to speak with you both by then. In the meantime, I need to speak with our newest recruit."
Victor chuckled at Phil through razor fangs. He had Clint pulled tight against him by the wrists, seemingly barely affected by the archer's attempts to squirm free. Victor's free hand curved around Clint's throat, index finger and thumb digging into tender points right behind the man's jaw. Clint made a quiet sound of protest, but none of the defiance faded from his eyes even as he went still in the mutant's grasp.
While Tony wanted rather badly to go back to cuddling Steve, he wasn't about to say so. Instead, he grabbed his light tablet - brought in courtesy of the nurses after some extensive bitching on Tony's part - from the nightstand. A few touches later, and Tony had the more important piece of information up. "Didn't share this bit with Fury, but I gave him enough information to put him on the right track. Apparently, Logan worked for SHIELD with my daddy dearest. Once upon a time, in fact, when you were fighting psuedo-Nazis, Logan was wading up the shore during D-day with his brother - who he doesn't remember - to go fetch a relic from under a religious site in Normandy." He showed Steve a scan of a grainy, black-and-white photo. The outline was vaguely similar to Thor's hammer, but somehow more sinister "This thing. I couldn't tell you how to pronounce it. Not enough vowels. Most folks thought it was an old Celtic doohickey, and it got overlooked by everyone involved. Except SHIELD. Logan and his team scooped it up, then Logan helped escort it somewhere safe. He's the only one alive now who would know where it would be." Tony poked at the other files he'd pulled and frowned. "What it does, exactly, isn't clear, but some of dad's notes indicate it's evil as hell."
Scott's chest heaved like he'd been running a marathon. He gripped Logan's belt loops to pull their hips into closer contact. His own cock had gladly risen to the occasion, straining against his jeans. The duel friction from the denim and Logan's body was torturous and wonderful. After all the uncertainty and fear, letting go was a revelation. "You have no idea much I want you right now."
Unable to resist irritating Coulson, Clint placed a hand on the side of the car and vaulted in, a black duffel bag in his lap. The archer was more than graceful enough to execute the maneuver without even creasing the upholstery on the collectible car. "You act like it's my fault that half the things I drive or fly end up getting shot out from under me," he remarked, unzipping the bag as they eased out of the garage. "Don't figure Xavier'd be too impressed with me showing up in my gym clothes," he remarked, dragging a change of clothes from the bag. He looked directly at Coulson and quirked a faint grin. "You don't mind if I change in the car, do you?"
"I think that's a plan," Tony murmured happily against Steve's lips. "You can hide in my lab anytime. Just don't get too close to Dummy. He has a tendency to spill stuff on people." He pressed his forehead to Steve's, turning his head slightly to rub their noses together with a faint smile. "I think you'd look good in one of my lab chairs, though."
The Asgardian released Phil and, still grinning broadly, held him by the shoulders. "It is good to see you whole and well, my friend!"
Natasha already wore jeans and a t-shirt, ready for the day by the time Clint appeared. She smiled fondly at the sight of him. "Coffee's almost ready. I usually hit the caf for breakfast." It gave her a chance to get the lay of the land for the day and get out of the apartment. "After that, Fury's called a meeting to discuss everything." Hoping to remove some of the sting from the news that they'd be suffering through a meeting, Natasha added, "Steve's out of medical. He's staying with Tony."
Clint didn't hesitate. "A sleeve. Something kind of traditional, with something for the guys I couldn't bring back," he said, looking thoughtfully out across the crowds. It was the one thing he truly struggled to deal with. Everything they did was classified, and when they lost an agent, that agent practically disappeared. Their family - if there was one - got a vague letter of condolences extorting their great contributions without ever explaining what those contributions were, and that was it. No plaque, no statue, no memorial. No one else to know or remember. Maybe a memorial on his arm wouldn't be much, but it would've been more than nothing. Clint's blue eyes drifted back to Coulson. "What about you?"
Tony smiled, wriggled his finger for Steve to follow him, and sat down at the desk. "For starters, Google is your friend," he explained, setting Steve's home page for the web site. "Type in anything you want to search for, and..." Tony clicked some keys, "presto!" A page filled with links to various Iron Man pages came up, and Tony folded his arms across his chest and flashed a rather self-satisfied expression up at Steve. "Feel free to peruse any of these, my friend. No nudes of yours truly, but you might find a few fakes. There's sites out there for that kind of thing."
Clint smirked. "I vote for 'attacked by rabid poodles.' Just ridiculous enough to be believed, right?"
Tony twisted his hand against his bonds, wondering if he was imagining the fact that his captor seemed to be turning blue. He pretended to think over Loki's proposal, but it was obvious what he had to do. Keeping the two agents alive was still better than letting them die. Tony was fairly certain he was as good as dead already, but maybe if he kept Loki from getting bored with him, he'd survive long enough to escape. //Might as well make it count.// "Alright. If you're really that hard up for friends… deal. Me for their lives," he said, swallowing hard. He knew that making deals with Loki was a bad idea, but not playing along seemed like the shorter path to getting dead.
Logan didn't bother to hide the laughter the whole scene inspired. "And here I thought all the sex in Mission Impossible was just to sell tickets." He glanced sidelong at Scott. "Didn't realize it was a documentary."
Tony looked up, honestly surprised by the offer. He glanced back at Bruce, who nodded. "Okay." Back to Simmons before he snapped at Bruce, "You can keep 'em. But food and water's your responsibility."
"I... no. A beer would be nice," Scott answered honestly. He didn't know how to be casual with Logan. When they'd spent time together in the past, he'd always focused himself too intently on everything about Logan that he didn't like. It was foreign playing nice with him, and Scott regretted the oversight. The truth was that Logan had been so understanding about everything that it was almost surreal, and unlike most people from Westchester would have been, Logan knew how to keep his distance when it was warranted. Finally he confessed, "I don't really have anywhere to go."
Phil supposed that a lot of them had a blind spot when it came to more intimate contact. Standing up to torture was one thing, finishing off a fight with a broken leg or ignoring someone sticking knives under your fingernails. It was different ignoring someone who wanted something so much deeper and more personal. It was still about power, but it wasn't really something most of them encountered. Natasha probably knew a hell of a lot more about it than either of them did, and the thought of that just made Phil feel queasier. He stared Creed down without flinching and allowed himself a moment of pride at the fact before he looked to Clint instead, Clint who he'd held all night and still couldn't adequately protect.
"After the serum failed, Mr. Stark began experimenting with some of his alternate models in case you chose to use one. Given that the team is particularly understaffed, it seemed a prudent time to show you his efforts. Of course, he was rarely truly done with anything, but it has been tested and is safe for immediate use. You will have to accept my assurances on that, I'm afraid."
Logan could feel the edge drawing near as well. Soft groans of pleasure turned into harsh grunts as he started thrusting faster, and he soon came with a howl of pleasure that he made no effort to restrain.
As if in answer to Phil's wishes, Clint slipped through the doors, looking more relaxed if no less worried. "She's in pain, but she's not in any danger," he said, then tilted his head at Coulson. "We need to talk." His gaze flicked to Logan. "Alone."
"Done," Clint growled, his face hardened. He didn't know who these people were, but he knew that Loki had brought them. That was all he needed to know. In the space of a heartbeat, an arrow lodged in Sabretooth's eye socket, knocking him clear of the Hulk, who promptly pinned him under one massive green foot.
"Tony." Bruce waited for the other man to face him. "We are not risking you, too. We can't keep sacrificing people."
For his part, Clint had gone with his typical layered look of a t-shirt, open button down and leather jacket with jeans. He couldn't decide whether he wanted to stare at Nat or Phil more. Nat was her typical svelte self, but Phil was intriguing so dressed down. Clint hadn't noticed before. "Guess we are," he agreed after a moment, sidling up to Nat.
Logan started to tell her he'd do it, then seemed to change his mind. "You do it," he decided, letting go of Nat and taking hold of Scott. He nipped at the man's neck, his tongue soothing over the fading bruises from the events of the last few days as he pulled his lover tight against him. He let out a harsh sigh as their cocks slid together, nuzzling Scott's throat and jaw. "Feel good, baby," he murmured softly.
That one movement was enough to destroy any lingering doubts Coulson might have had about what they were doing. He grabbed the back of Clint's head and crushed their lips together. He let adrenaline take over. It was like being on a mission. For a brief moment, everything but the man against him disappeared. With his other hand on Clint's hip, Coulson couldn't help wondering if it would all be real once he sobered up.
Even Logan gave Tony a look that said he thought the man was crazy. "Uh, if I don't work out, pretty sure we should just regroup and-"
It took Coulson a moment to even understand the words. A slow blink was the only outward sign of the internal processing going on. "May I ask what the benefit to the Avengers might be in that scenario?"
Steve stared at the syringe blankly, then with growing awe. "It will... I'll go back to..." It wasn't normal, and he knew it, so the phrasing escaped him quickly.
"I put him up in the room next to mine," Steve informed the man, realizing they hadn't really followed any sort of procedure in terms of signing Logan in or setting up lodgings.
Scott wasn't sure how true the words were given his current state, but he knew that Loan meant them. That went a long way toward offering comfort. "You're gorgeous." His fingers trailed down through the hair on Logan's chest. The man looked like something off the cover of a romance novel. "Scared the hell out of me coming so close to... god, we both could've gotten written off so easily. "
"What scared me was thinkin' what'd happen if we didn't win; I thought Loki might get to you. That's why I couldn't put the gun down. I couldn't let him..." After seeing what the god had done to his teammates, to him, to Scott... He was pretty damned terrified at the thought of what the god could've done with Scott. "I remember thinkin' as I fell that I couldn't protect you if I needed to." He pulled Scott tight against him.
"Not happening," Phil answered more sharply than he'd intended. His expression softened faintly at the warning look Natasha gave him. "Unless it's absolutely necessary, I'd rather keep an eye on you myself."
"I couldn't handle not being here. It was hard enough with Tash," Clint murmured. He took a second to shrug off what was left of his shirt and used it to create a bandage for the bite wound. It wasn't the most sterile bandage in the world, but he felt like it would be cleaner than the cell they were in. That done, Clint wound his arms around Phil's waist and pressed close to him, trying to ignore the smell of their tormentor on the other man. "And of course I still want to do this. Besides, all the times you stuck around and watched over me after I got banged up in ops? No way I'd leave you by yourself." Clint didn't have family or anyone else to worry over him. Phil and Nat were the only ones who ever had.
"Yes, she was," Tony agreed with a solemn nod. "Thank you for saying so." Pushing away memories he leaned over Steve, his arms reaching around the other man as he typed in another search. "I'm not the only one with fans." Links to Captain America websites sprang up, several of which Tony had taken the time to explore after meeting Steve. "There's pictures from the war," he explained, straightening and allowing Steve a chance to look for himself, "but mostly the propaganda films you did. Very nice." Tony grinned, adding, "You might be called back into service. In front of the cameras, I mean. The world could use some morale nowadays."
"Or we could have a drink first." He looked down at his own suit - liberally disheveled and coated with dirt and he didn't like to think what else. "Showers can probably wait." Seeing Loki had been harder than he expected. His chest ached, though Phil knew the pain was in his head and not his body. "Definitely a drink." Without another word, he lead the way to the elevator and down to the lounge and its wet bar - fully stocked thanks to Tony Stark's generous patronage. Coulson stepped up to the bar and smiled faintly. "You look as bad as I feel, so I'll be your bartender for the evening. I'm a scotch man myself. What's your poison?"
"It is a difficult thing to lose one of your own," Sif agreed, her tone softer than normal. "There is no dishonor in mourning those who deserve to be mourned. From all that Thor has told me, the Man of Iron was well worth the glory of being given a proper rest. We will see that it is done." That Loki was, whatever his official parentage, one of their own only made it more embarrassing that he was capable of being so dishonorable. War did not have to be waged in so ugly a fashion, but sniping and underhanded tactics seemed to be the only ones he ever used.
Coulson took the file and opened it, scanning the contents before nodding. "Understood, sir. Is Agent Barton cleared to come with me?"
Phil opened his mouth to protest, but a harsh look from the woman changed his mind. "Thank you," he replied instead.
"I know. Only Pepper can get away with such blatant disrespect for the laws of Stark." He'd gotten a call from the woman the night before. Apparently she'd heard through the grapevine a version of what happened. He'd filled in the blanks. Pepper wasn't officially part of the SHIELD chain of security and intelligence, but he didn't care. The truth was that Pepper Potts was probably more trustworthy than Stark most of the time. He set the food on the table and grabbed his own coffee from the tray, taking a seat and waiting for Tony to join him. "Got a text from the medical staff. Steve should be off the oxygen by the time we get down. He did better overnight."
"That it does, thanks to the assistance of your team. We owe you a debt, and we hope that our help may do some work toward paying it."
"Well," Victor said, calculating blue eyes looking over Clint's face, "I was told I get to entertain myself with the two of you." His gaze fixed on Phil. "I just have to decide who I want to break first."
Steve squirmed at the touch and let out a sigh of frustration when Tony made no move to actually do anything more than tease. "Tony, please?" he finally whispered against Tony's lips, following the request with a kiss that he hoped would melt the last of Tony's resolve soundly. It worked for his own, and Steve was tugging Tony's jeans down his hips to grab a handful of the man's ass in short order.
"No, you're not," Clint agreed, forcing himself to slide away from Phil's lap. He was already half hard, his voice rough from arousal, and his goal had been to take things a little slower. He was pretty sure that if he stayed in Phil's lap, he was going to miss that goal. They'd started out with no brakes, and now Clint wanted to make sure that this wasn't like all his other flings. "But I think that's why it's a good thing. That we're a good thing. I don't think I need my usual. I think I need anything but," he said, his hands still roaming over the other man's chest.
Natasha sat still in her chair. She noticed that even Fury wasn't meeting her gaze. He had been rather clear that he didn't like the idea of letting her get to their prisoners. She'd been equally clear that if he didn't give her permission, she was probably going to do it anyway. She stared a hole through his eyepatch as they sat across the table from one another, her chair positioned just slightly closer to Steve's than was strictly necessary.
Another tremor of lust wrenched at Tony as he did his best to thrust into his tormentor's fist. Sweat streamed down his face as he gasped out, "I want to be fucked... Steve, fuck me... Hold me down... and use me... fuck me... fuck me, please..." Need clawed at his senses. The cool, calm and collected Tony Stark was no more. The drug had unleashed the feelings he'd been repressing, and transformed him into a wanton creature of lust.
Coulson was the one who gave in and explained, "And it uses cellular energy to power the... the whatever the hell it does. It uses life force."
Clint nodded. He wanted Coulson to put down the hammer probably at least as much as the agent himself did. He wasn't sure it was for the same reasons, though. "Good news is, I didn't notice anything until we started fighting, so... you should be okay?" he said, trying to sound reassuring. Doing his best to keep his mind clear with the hammer so close, Clint escorted Phil quickly down to the research floor. Through several airlocks and security systems, Clint was already talking with Jarvis to make sure a secure vault was set up for the artifact. By the time they got there, a half dozen guards waited outside a cell not unlike what they'd put Loki in, with the added advantage of a fully equipped lab an airlock away. Clint gestured to the pedestal in the center. "All you," he said, watching the agent closely.
Tony felt his heart thump with fear at the words. His weakness was keeping him relatively safe, but if Loki got tired of him, he really had no hope of saving his friends. Remembering that, he started toward where the bed was, steps slow and unsteady partly because he was still weak and partly because he didn't want to trip and fall right in front of the god when he was certain that it would do nothing less than entertain Loki. When his hands contacted the bed, Tony finally crawled into it. Laying down, he expected his mind to be swirling with too many thoughts and fears to let him sleep, but exhaustion overrode everything, and he was out almost immediately.
Jemma managed a faint smile in return. "We all have our failings... and we both know that if you hadn't ultimately decided to help with the serum, Fitz and I might never have figured it out at all. Certainly not in time to be of help." It had been a near thing as it was, and judging from the way Steve had looked the last time she got a glimpse of him, it would still be a few days before he was back to normal. The cells were proving more sluggish to respond than she would've liked, mostly because so little of the serum had been left. "It isn't one person's fault, what happened... it... we all worked together. Even Mr. Stark. We didn't have another plan."
The archer started awake, momentarily confused as to where he was. When he finally figured it out, he also remembered he owed Coulson coffee. The archer rolled off the couch and dragged himself into the kitchen. It wasn't hard to find what he needed; the place was meticulously organized. Hoping Coulson liked his coffee as brutally strong as Clint did, the archer put a considerable serving of grounds in the maker and then settled at the bar and quietly waited for it to brew.
Steve smiled but couldn't quite help blushing all over again. Tony was still wearing nothing but a towel, and Steve couldn't quite decide whether to look toward the man or away from him. He didn't know which was more conspicuous. "This looks perfect." The room was decorated in the tasteful, modern style that was the norm for Tony. Steve was surprised to find that instead of finding it foreign, he felt immediately at home in the space.
Given how good a stiff drink sounded, Coulson nodded. "I think for once we can forgo getting the Director's approval so long as we keep things from turning into a frat party. We all need to blow off some steam." He watched Clint uncertainly. He must have been imagining the way the man's eyes followed him, the way Clint stared. Because Clint didn't stare at him, he stared at Natasha. It was the way of the world.
"Mmm hmm," Natasha agreed, "I've noticed. I think the thing you're overlooking is that I don't date. You simply haven't dated." It was an important distinction. She could see it in Clint, the yearning for something to hold onto in the strange whirlwind that was their lives. She'd seen him looking at Tony and Steve and not just leering at how hot they were together but gazing fondly at their new connection. "Not pushing. I don't know if he'd be interested either. It's not exactly a state secret that he's bi, but it doesn't mean you're his type. Just something to think about since you said you haven't." The blush on Clint's cheeks as he'd started talking about it said otherwise, but Natasha had enough tact not to call him on his lies when it wasn't necessary for effect.
"Mr. Stark, you seem to be having difficulty focusing." In truth, Tony seemed to be using his discomfort to avoid the questions. That wouldn't do. His superiors had been very clear about what they wanted to hear, about what they thought it would take to break the man they were really putting on the show for. Moving in until Tony couldn't ignore him, the Soldier's voice dropped, and his hand came to rest just below the reactor on Tony's chest before trailing down. "We know you ended things with Miss Potts. We know your interests don't lie with women alone, so why do you continue denying what you feel?"
Tony got the hint, quickly delivering the notepad into Steve's hands slender hands. It felt surreal, seeing the man look so delicate, so sickly. Tony wondered how much of that was the effects of the gun and how much was just the way Steve had been before the serum. The thought just made Tony more determined. He knew it'd be a knock-down, drag-out fight to get Banner on board with going back to trying to replicate the serum. Maybe literally. //Might have to put on the suit,// he reflected with a wry grin to himself. Maybe they wouldn't need to replicate it, though. Maybe they just needed to reactivate -  Tony stopped himself, realizing he was going into science mode when Steve was right there and needed him, and there might be angry orderlies coming in any moment to make Tony give Steve time to rest.
Clint practically purred as Phil worked the knots from his shoulders, turning into a puddle of happy archer against his date rather quickly. He rolled over onto his stomach, half on top of the other man as he murmured, "You can just do that until I get tired of it. And I promise, no mooning Captain Crazypants without good cause. Wouldn't wanna miss out on the blanket fort. Too many microwave s'mores I need to eat." Remembering their last encounter with Loki sent a chill through Clint. The god had nearly gotten to both of them. If it hadn't been for that creepy, possessed hammer, neither of them would have survived.
"Right," Bruce muttered, letting adrenaline, fear, anxiety, and rage that he usually kept back boil over. The Hulk roared a challenge at the gathered enemies, thumping his chest with one massive fist and grinning with an eager glint in his eye.
Clint nodded, running a hand over Phil's chest, determined to stay in the bed until Jarvis told them they had to get ready. It felt too good to be tangled up against his handler to jump out of bed. "I will be. I've already got all kinds of plans on how we're gonna feed the ducks and I'm gonna cuddle you all night every night and we're gonna live off of pizza, donuts, and stupid eighties movies until we get tired of it." He leaned in, pressing their foreheads together and closing his eyes. "And I'll protect Tash, too, but I figured she'd yell at me for thinking she needed my protection."
The billionaire grabbed desperately at Mystique's knees, trying to pry them apart. "Any chance... I could... buy you a drink... to move this along?" Tony quipped, attempting to at least get Steve enough room to grab some air.
"I'm sorry, could you start from the beginning, please?" Steve was too tired to try and follow the young woman's manic energy. It was difficult on the best of days, and they were a long way from one of those.
Clint eliminated four of the six remaining mobsters at range before they managed to figure out where he was. Bow in one hand and combat knife in the other, the nimble agent made short work of the first as Clint tried to get to Darien since the last mobster standing had clearly decided to eliminate his prisoner. The marksman leapt into the building through the window, gaining just enough reach with his bow to clip the thug on the chin with it. He dropped the ranged weapon and lunged forward with the short knife, knocking the bulky mobster down and quickly and efficiently jamming the blade into the man's throat and coating his hands and chest with a considerable spray of blood.
Clint grinned broadly as he sat up on the bed, though he felt a little disappointed that Phil was already moving to get ready. "I'm not sure that that's protocol, but at least it's accurate," he admitted, quickly brushing his teeth and washing his face. He knocked back his stubble a bit, then stepped out of the bathroom, tossing the hand towel he'd used to dry his face on the counter. He settled back on the edge of the bed and rubbed at his face. "We don't have to do anything today, right? Like, the geniuses are upstairs geniusing and I don't have anyone to kill, so..."
It made his skin crawl. The closest thing that Coulson could find in his mental library to relate the moment to was a big dog jumping on him when he was a little boy and slamming him to the ground. Of course, the dog had only wanted to play, and it had backed off the second its owner asked it to. Victor wasn't on anyone's leash but Loki's, and Coulson knew better than to expect mercy from that corner. So instead he tried not to gag at the feeling of Victor's breath on the back of his neck and the man's heavy body against his own. Considering the fact that he'd been looking forward to sharing most of his free time in Clint's bed in the not too distant future, reality was encroaching in a particularly offensive fashion. At least facing the wall spared him from seeing Clint's face. Silently he prayed that Clint would just stay the hell down and prevent any further damage. If they ever did find themselves with an opening, he wanted them both to at least be capable of movement.
Scott shrugged. "He might hate it. He also might not care. I don't mean to sound crude here, but you've been with people where it's just been about chemistry, right? Logan's a lot of fun when he's not homicidal. That doesn't mean I'm suddenly his property." He set his beer down and moved in a little closer to Clint. "Trust me, I'm a grown man who makes his own decisions - especially about who I sleep with." //So why doesn't it feel like I'm the one deciding?//
"I think we can do that," Logan agreed, lapping at a trail of sweat on Scott's neck. He shifted slowly, moving just enough to tease them both before he drew back and began thrusting slowly. "In fact, think we might haveta. You look too good when I'm fuckin' your brains out to go more than twenty four hours without seein' you like this." He nuzzled Scott's jaw, groaning softly as his lover squeezed him perfectly. "Might haveta bring Nat in once in awhile. She was pretty good at makin' you squirm, too."
Tony looked down at their hands as well. "I was kinda afraid I would freak out," he confessed. It still felt a little surreal. He smiled when Steve looked back up at him. "Still love you." Knowing that wasn't the only question in Steve's mind, the billionaire leaned down, lips a breath away from Steve's, hand coming to rest on the blonde's lean hip and eyes darkening a little. "Still want you, too."
Logan grit his teeth and gave Tony a good shake and a thump against the wall before letting him go and putting away the claws. "Government skullfuckers think they know what I want, huh?" he said, turning to face Steve. He crossed his arms over his chest. "If you people have a 'file' on me, then you know I don't play well with others." Ugly arguments with Scott about whether Bobby and Rogue were old enough to be X-Men had pretty well driven Logan to leave the X-Men along with the residual tension in regard to a certain redhead he’d gotten too fond of.
"Two beds," Steve explained, nodding toward the California king beds on the other side of the room's divider. "Honestly it's probably enough room to have shared with Tony, but he snores when he's drunk." After all the time he'd spent in one barracks or another, Steve was happy to have his own space sometimes. "Not to mention that I don't want to be in the way if he has a hangover tomorrow. As for the nightmares, I'll lay low. Up to your discretion if you wake me." He didn't have them as much anymore, but his first few nights out of the ice, Steve had woken up drenched in sweat and unable to get warm no matter how many blankets he wrapped around himself or how many scalding showers he took. Coulson still gently tried to insist that he speak to someone about the dreams, but it was bad enough having them to start with. "I'm gonna turn in, but don't worry about waking me if you aren't ready to knock off for the night. I'm a pretty heavy sleeper," Steve assured as he fished some pajamas of a markedly old-fashioned design out of his suitcase.
Momentarily mesmerized and simultaneously unnerved by that stare, Tony hesitated a moment before leaning in and gently kissing the tall blonde, his hand running over that magnificent chest as he shifted closer. "Any way you want me," he breathed.
A cold smile lit the man's face. "Excellent. So tell me, Mr. Stark, what is the nature of your relationship with Steve Rogers?"
Jarvis normally didn't break into the sanctity of Phil's suite at his request - it was a bit unsettling, by and large, to have a piece of tech designed by Tony intruding into his private routine. The circumstances were far from normal, however, and he cleared his throat. "Yes, Jarvis?"
The archer looked more shocked than angry, but his expression leveled out a moment later, and he looked at Coulson. "If this is what it takes. I do want to see her. You game?"
Logan's arm was across Scott's waist, his fingers digging lightly into the man's side as Scott writhed against him and nipping roughly at Scott's neck, marking the man as his own as if to make up for the bruises Barton had left. Logan could still see teeth in the bitemark on Scott's shoulder, and it made him feel that much more possessive. Drawing back, he watched Scott squirm in response to Natasha's attentions, fascinated by the play of pleasure on his lover's face. It wasn't anything he hadn't seen before, but being able to focus purely on Scott's reactions without having to concentrate on what he was doing made it that much more intense. He watched the shift in the curve of his lover's parted lips, the flutter of his tongue and the heaving of his chest for several moments before leaning in again to press their lips together. Logan's own cock was throbbing hard against Scott's thigh, and he couldn't wait until he got to slide into his lover's tight heat.
Tony slowly lost what little discipline he had, unable to resist thrusting faster and angling his hips to make sure each thrust hit the spot inside his lover that tore the most incredible whimpers and cries from Steve's lips. He watched Steve's unbelievably long lashes flutter against his cheeks, the way his perfect pink lips parted with each roll of Tony's hips. The sight combined with the way Steve's body gripped his cock like a vice was enough to drive Tony over the edge, and he cried out Steve's name as he found his release, hips pressed tight against the blonde's ass.
Tony barely let himself think. Loki was still alive, and they had one last option. "Keep him back," he told Scott. "I need a few seconds, and your boyfriend needs you to keep this freak away from him." Tony yanked the oversized arc reactor away from the gun, dragging metallic tubing from the opening left behind. It coupled perfectly with the suit's chest-mounted nanorepulsor, and Tony felt a strange thrum through his entire body as the gun's energy systems linked to the suit's and to him. He tugged away the focusing and targeting mechanisms, leaving little more than the energy chamber. Tony held his free hand out, aiming the repulsor in it. Instead of the usual bright blue, the weapon crackled with dark energies, and Tony felt feverish and weak and vaguely like he was going hollow on the inside.
"That sounds like a pretty good plan," Steve agreed. He let go of Tony's hand long enough to finish off his dinner then took point in cleaning the kitchen up. "Now,I think maybe we had done other plans before we make sure you get a good night's sleep." It was strange to feel tentative about approaching his lover for sex, but there it was. He sounds his arms carefully around Tony's waist and felt immediately more at ease close to the man.
"Just footsie?" Tony pouted, then nudged Steve's leg with his foot. "Much prefer a game of handsie, instead. How much shit do you think Fury'd give us if we fooled around in the bathroom?" His gaze shifted to the approaching waiter. "Martini. Soda for blondie." The man seemed to hesitate as he realized who his customers were. "And no, we're not doing pictures tonight. Just tell your friends about our normal, healthy relationship, hm?"
Logan's eyebrows raised in amusement even as he drank to the declaration. "I think that can be arranged," he said, smiling across the table at Scott. It felt good to know that Scott was certain he wanted Logan around. The feral mutant hadn't thought about it too much, but he'd been quietly afraid that he was a security blanket, that Scott wanted him around because he was familiar and because he'd rescued Scott from his kidnappers. "As in, I think you better keep one o' those dresser drawers empty."
"He's... we think... We believe that the weapon interacted strangely with the serum... Obviously, under normal circumstances, the most we do for him is stitch something up so that it heals properly, reset a bone or two. Captain Rogers tends not to need our services." Going over known facts seemed to make the man more confident as he proceeded. "He's losing ground, but not in the way we anticipated. We think that the serum has been neutralized, at least to some degree. Temporarily, we hope."
Breakfast was quiet. Neither Steve nor Pepper knew quite what to say, so they sat close beside each other drinking coffee and eating cereal and trying to pretend it wasn't the most painful morning they'd ever suffered through. "It's funny," Steve finally half-whispered, "when I think about it... it wasn't... we weren't together that long."
Tony dropped his head against the wall and spread his legs.  “This what you want?” he asked, looking back over his shoulder.  “Me to present to you, like a good little slut?”
“You’re more than enough for me, doll.”  Steve’s words were muffled, considering he hadn’t lifted his face out of Tony’s neck.
Abruptly Tony was no longer sleepy – and Steve was no longer amused.  If they’d been in the Tower already, Tony would have walked away.  He was tired and hungry.  He’d bruised his torso, banging around in the Iron Man suit – and their interlude in the little building hadn’t helped his bruises.  All of that combined meant he was already sensitive – and now the person he’d been sure would understand was acting like Tony’s relationship with Steve was somehow abnormal.  Instead of being able to remove himself from the situation, he was stuck here, feeling like a bug on a card –
Steve carried him straight to the bathroom and started peeling them both out of sweaty, dusty clothes.  “She makes sense.”  He turned on the water.  “Bath or shower, sweetheart?”
“You,” Tony retorted, his eyes sparkling.  “It’s always you.”  He rocked his hips against Steve’s, testing the waters.  He was sated enough from earlier not to have a specific desire… just a general need to be close to Steve.
“I need you to understand that,” Steve continued, licking Tony’s ear softly.  “I can’t – I can’t lose you too.”  Tony’s eyes widened, gaping at him, utterly at a loss for words.  “You got that, Tony?”
Tony smirked up at him.  “Isn’t everything?”  Despite his threat to only watch, Tony ran an appreciative hand up and down Steve’s flexing abs.  “Look at you, all hard and lovely for me.”
“I’m hoping you’re gonna do things to me,” Tony quipped, but it came out breathy – he was already spiraling towards mindless lust.
Steve shifted closer, tugging at Tony until the engineer nestled into his lap.  “I can’t avoid the press either, love – haven’t been able to since Rebirth.  But damn, I love that you want to protect me.”  He leaned his forehead against Tony, smoothing his hands up and down the work-hardened muscles of his back.  “You hate it too, love.  Maybe nobody else can tell, but I see it.  So I’ll make you a deal.  We do press together, or not at all.  Even if that means I’m sittin’ off screen, or you are – but we’re partners now, love.  We don’t have to do shit on our own anymore.”
Tony looked back over his naked shoulder.  “Stop overthinking it.  I can’t take them alone, but you’ll be there to protect me from the scary water.”
He didn’t, to Tony’s shock.  Once Steve was breathing somewhat normally, he gently eased himself out of Tony and went in search of a washcloth.  Tony directed him with a wave of his hand, and the supersoldier returned freshly wiped down and with a cloth in hand.  He proceeded to clean Tony off as well, hands almost painfully gentle, then stood at the edge of the bed looking uncertain.
Feeling a strange fluttering in his heart, Steve nodded slowly.  “Yeah, okay.  I promise.  I’ll follow it if you do.”  He freed a hand and used it to lift Tony’s chin so they could kiss again.
“I’m not gonna hit you, doll,” Steve reminded Tony.  “And you ain’t gonna hit me.  Cycle’s over.  Nobody’s perpetuatin’ nothin’.”
“It’s not that bad,” Tony protested as he selected a watch from a drawer.  “It’s a charity benefit, sugar – not the blitz.”
“Doubt it would be for you… you like uniforms,” Steve teased.  He gently stroked his fingers over Tony’s hole.
In answer, Tony crooked his fingers just right and hit Steve’s prostate.  The supersoldier let out a wail and came – hard.  Tony hummed happily as he drank it down.  He’d tasted a lot of come in his life, but damned if Steve’s wasn’t the sweetest he’d had.
Tony lifted a hand to Steve’s face, cupping his chin gently and drawing him in for a soft, chaste kiss.  “You are edible, love.”
“Yeah,” Steve sighed.  “Always like it when you make love to me, babydoll.”  He spread his legs wider, propping his head on his hands to get a better view.
Neither of them spoke the remainder of the flight – and when they landed at the Tower, Steve carried Tony off the QuinJet and up to the penthouse without another word.
More words he couldn’t say pushed against Steve, but he merely nodded and pressed his shoulder against Tony’s.
Rhodey’s lips pursed as he watched them.  “There is exactly one person on this planet that I would commit treason for – and you’ve got your arm wrapped around him.”  Tony started to protest, and Rhodey shook his head.  “Don’t argue with me right now, Tones.  Steve – can I call you Steve?”  Steve nodded.  “That man is the brother my mama didn’t give me.  I have loved his stubborn, frustrating ass since he was a pimply fourteen-year-old MIT freshman.  I haven’t always liked him,” he added drily, “but I’ve always loved him.”
“Nice to see you have such faith in my dating ability, sweetheart.”  Steve released Tony’s hand to slide his arm around the engineer’s slender waist instead.  “Granted, I’m a bit out of practice – but I ain’t doing so bad.  Maybe it just takes havin’ the right partner.”
“You remember that giant crocodile we fought down south?  Where were we, Georgia?”  Steve smiled a little.  “You got covered in slime when it blew.”
They were booked at a lovely Italian place six blocks from the Tower.  Happy drove them – smiling the whole time, which was positively abnormal.  Steve didn’t jump out and go around to open Tony’s car door – but only because Happy beat him to it.  Once seated at their table, Tony felt the nervousness return.  His foot twitched under the table.
“That you’re worth it, doll,” Steve said from the doorway.  He was wiping paint off his hands, unapologetic for having eavesdropped.  “I really don’t care what the press says, Miss Potts.  I didn’t care before, and I don’t care now.”  He set the rag he’d been using next to the sink before pressing in close to Tony, tugging his partner to rest his back on Steve’s broad chest.  “You and Tony’ve got history, and I get that.  You bein’ his friend and runnin’ his company gets you some slack.  But don’t you be thinkin’ it’s okay to come into our home and accuse my partner of not bein’ worthy of my love.”
Steve leaned closer.  "You'd like that, wouldn't you?" he asked, continuing the steady rhythm.  "Like it if I worked my way through the team?"
Ten minutes later, they were both acceptably dressed and curled up on the couch.  Steve had put on a pair of Iron Man fleece pants that Clint had bought him – mostly because they made Tony smile.  They were silent when JARVIS chimed.  “Sir, Miss Potts is requesting entry.”
“I love you,” Tony gasped, his hands clutching at Steve’s waist.  His head tilted back, his eyes closing of their own accord as Steve set a steady, swift rhythm.
“Damn it, Tony,” Steve muttered, grabbing for his discarded t-shirt, “you didn’t tell me you wanted video.”
Obediently, Steve started to move again.  “Can you feel it?” he murmured, his eyes never leaving Tony’s.  “Can you feel how much I love you?”  He ground into Tony, feeling the first edges of his orgasm approaching.  “Every time I touch you, my body is whispering to yours.”
“Nobody does, sugar.”  Tony tipped his head up and kissed Steve – long, and slow, and as though there was no one else in the room.  “You might be edible, but you sure as hell aren’t eligible – you’re mine.”  Tony let a possessive growl creep into his voice.
“If I let them see how stunning you are under that suit, they might think I’m willing to share,” Tony said lightly.  There was real possessiveness behind the words, but he stuffed it down out of the way.  It was one thing to wind each other up with taunts about including others to watch or play – it was another thing entirely to really consider it.
Tony wasn’t certain if he meant he did break the rule or did know there were consequences… and wasn’t sure if it really mattered.  He dug his fingers into Steve’s hip, feeling like that was the only grip he had on his own orgasm.  “You getting close again?”
“It’s alright, baby,” Tony murmured.  “She’s… I think that’s her way of approving.”  He smoothed his thumb over Steve’s hand in his.
Steve’s hand stroked up and down his back.  “You’re not the only one who’s scared.”  He tilted his head to kiss Tony’s temple.  “What if what I want – need from you is forever?”
He wasn’t aware of how his expression softened when he looked at Steve.  Didn’t see the cameras pointed in his direction when Tony slid his arm around Steve’s waist, just to be closer.  Wouldn’t realize until much later that he was smiling up at his partner, transfixed by the enthusiasm in Steve’s blue eyes – that Steve’s gaze returned to his like a homing pigeon, always with the same absolute devotion.
“Just checking.”  Tony sat up and scrubbed at his face.  “JARVIS, has Rhodey texted recently enough to think he’s still up?”
Tony scrabbled for purchase on the concrete, instinctively shifting his weight to give Steve better access. "Fuck, I love it when you do that."  Steve hummed in acknowledgement which just made it hotter.  His tongue flickered in small, kittenish licks before he settled in, thrusting his tongue deep into Tony.  Steve kept his cheeks spread with both hands, using only his mouth on Tony's hole.  He licked and sucked and kissed like a starving man -- like it had been months since they'd done this.  "God, Steve, please -- " Tony gasped.  "More."
Tony pushed Steve into an elevator, and then down the hall to the captain’s quarters.  Steve’s passivity concerned him a little, but he let it ride for now.  Once inside Steve’s room, Tony urged him to strip out of his uniform.  “Goddamn, you’re a thing of beauty,” Tony whistled, watching skin bared.  “I could eat you up.”
Clint face-palmed for probably the hundredth time in the span of only six minutes, while Bruce and Wanda snickered to themselves.
Splashing himself with water, Tony tried to get rid of the burning fire licking its way under his skin, but it only flamed higher!
“Clint, I need you to get Bruce to take Thor outside while I get Tony upstairs to my room. You know where the tablets are, so I need to bring those too, but move quickly!”
That dark voice continued to mock him, slithering around his head as it whispered so solidly in his ear.
"Sorry," Nat replied, "Force of habit. Although I find it more amusing when the victim is 'in the zone' like you." She flicked him a cat-eyed grin.
He'd never been kissed like this! It felt perfectly balanced: soft and yet firm and solid... leading and following...
To anyone, it would ultimately be the most unethical thing to do, but without Steve, Tony’s body was going haywire and he needed an alpha. Yes, it was weird. Yes, it was extremely intimate, but worse things could have come from this- Thor, for example, downstairs.
When the two parted, Tony was dazed and a little disoriented. Steve steadied him, giggling softly, “Did anyone ever tell you that you are really adorable when you ramble?”
“He’s actually been the complete opposite lately,” Nat replied, leaning against the front doorway, “Whenever he’d say something completely
"Yeah, actually... they have a cute moment together and... and you can see how heartfelt Judy's apology is. You can see her heartbreak at the loss of a friendship that she actually found to be
Hot, angry tears gathered in his eyes and his vision blurred over. He sniffled, but immediately brought his hand to his mouth to mute any further noises, but Steve had heard.
Tony sat with his back to the door, the entire area of his skin lined with stitches. Steve clenched his teeth sympathetically. Tony's entire right arm was bandaged like Nat's and some blood was still seeping through.
"He's right about that, Love" Bucky's voice carried over to them as he walked down the corridor and he gave Nat a quick peck on the cheek as he came up to the pair.
They weren’t bonded, but Tony and Steve had something stronger. The two were something beyond simple Alpha-Omega makeup.
He shuffled his feet anxiously, waiting for the lift, all the while feeling everyone’s curious stares following him.
"You don't have to say it back," Steve assured, "But just know that, from me, you're my one and only, okay?" Steve smiled, "Promise you won't forget?" Tony nodded dumbly, quite still in shock. The blonde chuckled, "Come on, my stunning genius, let's get to bed."
It was a tense few moments. Steve tried his best to recount what had happened in the store under the glowering looks from Rhodey and Pepper.
Soon, his eyes fell shut midway through Natasha's third story and little Tony was snoring with a smile on his face.
"So I'd better see some ID in the next five seconds before I have Clint drag you down the street by your shins," she finished, ignoring Tony and not breaking her eye-contact from Steve.
Tony still squirmed on the mattress though, uncertain and shy. Nat would still have to undress him, because the heat had fully taken affect, so Tony wasn’t at all aware or capable of functioning on his own. His mind fought to stay conscious and alert, but it was no use. He squirmed and sniffled helplessly, whimpering in shame.
Once everyone was settled into the living room, and Nat and Tony came out with the food prepared, Thor beamed brightly and exclaimed, "Of course I love you all, my dear friends! And since tonight is especially reserved for showing dear Anthony our love, I can't imagine anyone here wanting to resort to violence as dear Clint explained."
It all steadily came back into focus. There was a lower half of someone’s face; someone’s mouth was moving but Tony couldn’t make out anything said.
Stephen caught it, and he blushed slightly, "Well, I mean, what's not to like about Tony? And I know you love him and want to protect him, so please know that I respect that. I wouldn't do anything to harm him."
"No, it was only one time between me and Bucky," Steve replied, if a little defensive, "It took a helluva long time, but me and him are in a good place now. Sam and Buck have been dating for three months now."
Steve stood hunched over a little, clutching at his sides, looking like a scared golden retriever with wide baby-blue eyes!
"You know, I actually may have a theory," Stephen mused into the silence. Flicking up an eyebrow, it gained Nat's interest.
"Well, there's this whole theory that our DNA contains the same genes as this race called the Luminals- they contained elements of stardust that was left over after the merging of galaxies after the Big Bang. It's sacred. So… so that means our bond is… is unbroken. Sacred." The last words left on a hush from Tony's lips.
When waking up, he wasn't at all surprised to see Tony, fully grown to his normal adult-self, snuggling close to Steve’s heart and smiling brightly.
” the anxiousness radiated off him and through his voice. Tony, sniffing the air, cowered further into Nat’s side as he smelt Clint’s uncertainty. He sniffled a shameful whimper.
“What? No, no I- I didn’t say anything, no- I-“ Steve cleared his throat uncomfortably, resuming to clean Tony’s wound. He felt his face and ears burn red.
She tried to console him, petting his hair affectionately, but Clint still stood shell-shocked in the doorway. Nat turned her attention back to him. Keeping her tone soft, but stern, she called his focus.
The blonde gulped, hoping he looked and smelled alright. The mechanic made his way over, smirking flirtatiously.
much! I don't even think I ever stopped! " His sobbing became uncontrollable and Tony bent his head down to hide his embarrassment, but it was quickly recaptured in a kiss!
Steve's smile was brilliantly bright. Holding out his hand, in silent question, he asked for Tony's.
Steve Rogers sat in the medical bay, letting the waves of drowsiness wash over him steadily. It would be a slow afternoon.
Hanging like a ragdoll off of Steve's grip, Bucky gave a tiny salute back to Nat with an adorable pout on his face and she chucked at the two idiots.
"We've got a shot at getting these stones back, Steve, but I've gotta tell you my priorities first."
“Oh! You’re home early,” he came around the kitchen island and placed a kiss on his love’s cheek, “And speaking of muffins, you’re in for a treat!” The soldier winked, but then gestured sheepishly to himself, “I’d, uh- I'd love to give you a hug, but you’d get dough and pumpkin on your shirt.”
Getting out of his car, he was greeted with cheers and congratulations. The crowd parted to let Nat through.
believe the surprise I have planned for us! I totally have F.R.I.D.A.Y on record to capture your face when-“
"-but I never stopped loving you, which was what made it hurt the first few weeks. Now… I- I hope we're okay?" He looked to Steve again.
"H-Hi- hi, I um… I… " swapping the bouquet between both of his hands, the soldier cleared his throat, embarrassed.
“No!” Steve stared incredulously at his teammates who did nothing, but shoot him pitiful or surprised glances.
“Okay, okay, just give me a minute,” Natasha’s hands began her rhythmic massage over Tony’s tummy. The contact calmed him some.
"I love you too," he whispered, almost too afraid to say it, like he was immediately preparing for the backslash and judgment, as from his father.
But never let it be ignored the relief that Steve felt the next morning, when he woke up to the normal, adult Tony cuddling close to Steve’s chest still in a larger kitten onesie.
Steve smiled, "And I'll always love you. I'm gonna do my best to give you a good life- a happy life. How can I deny you anything else?"
“Then you should know Tony, that we will always come rescue you. And we are so proud of you, and love you so much! So whenever you’re scared, know that we’ll always be there. Yeah?”
Tony wasn’t Howard. He may have his father’s name and blood, but not his experiences. Tony went through hell. And Steve had been meaning to give more of an apology than that one handshake after Loki’s attack on New York, but as such with Nat’s frustration, Tony had always been so busy.
His entire body aching, pulsing with pain, Tony cycled on through the pouring wet streets, his tears running amongst the raindrops.
She placed a kiss in the boy's dark curls and hugged him closer. But Tony was still nibbling his lip between his teeth. His brows were scrunched up in worry.
Pepper was on the phone making some calls. Happy and Rhodey were going over the procedures that would follow with Stephen.
In one swift movement, she pulled Steve back onto his feet and locked his hands in a steel grip by his sides!
It would be his first ever race tonight, if anyone was up for going against him. For now though, he observed the scene, trying to remain casual. There was an area to the side where sexy young women showed off their well-built bods and dance moves in skin tight clothing, or barely any clothing at all.
"Well," he began pointedly, "firstly, I would've noticed a stud like you a lot earlier, especially when he calls my body 'beautiful' instead of 'sexy' or 'perfectly slutty' -"
thoughts sprang forward ever so quickly, it was as if the excitement was never there to begin with in the first place.
The omega sat propped up against the hospital bed pillows, calmly watching some TV. Bucky cleared his throat albeit timidly. Looking up, a small, bright smile appeared on Tony's face which surprised Bucky greatly.
Sitting next to him on the bed, Steve began to fiddle with his hands. The uneasiness began stirring in his stomach. There were so few ways he could approach this without it ending in a fight.
The brunette squeaked adorably, before he melted into Steve and he let his mouth be guided in a perfect dance. The blonde's lips against his were supple and smooth, enlisting breathless moans from the mechanic.
“Oh, Captain Rogers!” he moaned ecstatically. Steve peppered kisses over his neck, like hot pin picks of fire. But then Tony’s eyes shot open.
But the nightmare then came forward once again, and Tony couldn't stop himself from letting out a pained whimper.
Seeing Steve, she walked over and leaned against the wall, watching the nurses and doctors bustle about on the helicarrier.
sorry, Tony, I- I have no idea what came over me, but it- it wasn’t what you think. I had protection and Bucky is on the pill. We didn’t go further into that bond. I didn't, I
Throwing open the front door, and down the front stairs, Tony made it to his bike and pushed on even though his legs were screaming to rest. The rain drenched him, plastering his clothes and hair to his body like a second layer of skin.
for something you'd want me to paint or... if I wanted to spoil you." Steve coughed. He wrung his hands together, nervously.
Tony’s heaving cries were like a repeated blow to Steve’s body. It pounded against his stomach; knocking out his every breath.
Tony Stark was stubborn, infuriating, he had his arrogance, but he was also brilliant and witty and intelligent and just as self-sacrificial as Steve! It felt invigorating to the captain to have someone as opposite as him to counteract his orders, his techniques. It felt good. It kept his brain working and with Tony, he was forced to open his mind and see a different point of view.
Getting to Tony’s penthouse floor, Steve let the brunette change quickly into a vest and boxers in the bathroom while he shucked off his shoes and stuffed his socks in.
"I'll have you know, Tony Stark, that one thing they always fail to mention is that I take pride in being helpful on the medical team during the war."
Tony didn’t think twice about yanking his husband flush against his chest and enveloping him in a hug! Breathing in his scent of sawdust and marshmallows, Tony felt home.
to calm down. His pupils were already so dilated, his eyes turned black. He was still scared and high on every emotion.
Steve would be courteous, he'd always ask for Tony's consent, but would go against Tony, only because he somehow always knew what was right for him at the end of the day!
Tony groaned and panted and it lit up the fire in Steve's core to hear those noises coming out of His Love. To know that he was responsible for causing those noises of bliss!
When he came back down to the communal area, everything was spotless and his husband stood proudly in the living room with a tray of cakes in his hands. Tony smiled. All the love he felt for the man bubbled up sweetly in his chest.
Natasha began chuckling fondly, "Not that I'm hating on this newfound enthusiasm, but where is this coming from? Did you have a revelation in yourself when we thought you were gone?"
Like Tony, Natasha had the magnetic ability to make herself larger than anyone in the room, despite being a head shorter. She made her presence known. And Steve felt remarkably like his pre-serum, scrawny self as he was hoisted a few centimeters off the floor!
"Nothing but confirmation," Steve mumbled. Shrugging it off, he plastered on a smile, "How'd the visit go?"
Natasha walked in and smiled lovingly at the little genius. Until Steve returned, Nat was entrusted to watch over Tony as he rode out his Little Headspace. He always went into it whenever Steve would be away on missions. It was a trigger for the brunette - separation anxiety. Courtesy of his father, Howard, always being away. And not giving Tony the love that he needed at the time...
So, this is a relatively short chapter, but I thought of just posting a breaker in the story. I estimate about two more chapters are left in this story.
Not caring to beat around the bush any longer and gawk like a fool, Steve cleared his throat, making his presence known. Tony's head turned. And Steve wasn't sure if it was just the exhaustion in Tony's face, or something else, but as his eyes focused on Steve's form, he turned back to the wall, mumbling a simple 'hello'.
He walked over to the coffee table on which a small heap was concealed under a blanket. Pulling the blanket away, Steve revealed a picnic basket.
As quick as a bolt of lighting, Natasha was back at eye-level with Steve on the floor and slammed a bone-crushing fist to his chest again!
After a couple minutes, a sleepy Little Tony found himself smiling as the first notes of a well-known song played throughout his daddy's room...
"Pouting baby away from his dessert?" Pepper teased, ruffling Tony's hair. With a groan, the man flopped back against the pillows, dramatically throwing his arm over his face.
Tony spared no second thought. He slipped his hand into Steve's warm grasp and in that moment, something clicked into place again. There was no more hurt. No more anger. The two did nothing but give each other dopey smiles for a full thirty seconds.
He placed little chaste kisses on Tony's forehead and stroked the tiny hairs at the nape of his neck.
"That thread of communication is instinctive. Whether consciously or subconsciously, they can feel one another through that bond when they are apart."
“Anytime I get scared, I picture a small knight in shining armour, who looks an awful lot like you, carrying a glimmering shield and sword and I know he’s coming to protect me. He inspires me to be brave, and I love him so much, so I want to make him proud.”
Steve frowned at that. He held Tony's hand in his, giving it a gentle squeeze. It made the mechanic blush once more, but Steve nodded gently for him to continue.
Sighing, Tony made his way to the second-floor hallway where his dad stood swaying, whiskey bottle in hand.
A small scurrying creature pays a visit to the Avengers Compound and Tony enlists Steve to come to his rescue.
Once the supersoldier was seated and the flowers placed in a vase, Tony plopped his hands against the sheets determinedly in a business statement.
“Tony, Tony, hey- hey, it’s alright, Doll. Don’t worry,” Steve chuckled heartily, bringing in the small man for another hug, kissing his curls. “You didn’t forget anything,” Steve reassured, drawing back slightly to look at those beautiful brown orbs, “I just thought you needed a break. And an apology for not trying to understand why you created Ultron. I know should’ve listened to you Honey. I’m so sorry.”
"Well, I guess anyone covered in that amount of oil and grease must know what he's doing," Steve replied, flipping up his eyebrow.
She scooped up the little boy and kissed away his tears as they fell. Tony's eyes were wide and glossed over. His lip was quivering as he tried to keep everything in, but Nat wouldn't have it.
to keep this relationship going. A whole month of that kind of behavior on this new bond Stephen theorizes that we have-"
Twisting and turning and drifting over the gravel, every nerve was lit up inside him. Every sense that he had zeroed in on the wheel, the wind, the black night and road lit up around them by light.
“All I'm saying is that it just makes it all the more concerning that there are self destructive people in the world, like Tony, during his Mark II creative process!”
He pulled the genius into his arms, breathing his undertone of motor oil that never seemed to leave the man. He twirled Tony in his arms passionately. Steve hoped he could convey, through his touch, the words that he could not seem to find. But Tony pushed away slightly, staring into the soldier's face.
“Tony? Hey, what’s going on?” she knelt down and spoke in soothing tones, reaching out to touch his shoulder gently, “Kotynok, what are you doing on the ground? Come on inside – I’ll make us two cups of your favourite coffee.”
She smiled again – Tony’s smile – and reached her arms out. Steve scooped her up and she tousled his hair.
win- it's just unfair strength," Tony pouted. Steve pecked his nose, "Says the man who willingly chose to date the football quarterback."
The advantage was that Nat could still control her fluids’ makeup; her seed contained egg cells, so it couldn’t influence Tony’s body in the long term unless she decided it could.
"Woah, Tony, are you alright?" Steve felt Tony nuzzle in his neck, inhaling Steve's scent and relaxing in his hold. A three-second gesture turned into a six-second hug that Steve was…
, my good captain," she purred innocently, "had come down to help me with the dishes. I then recall ramming you to the floor and you squealed like a five-year old girl! I believe your exact words before disaster struck were... "
"H-How- How could I n-not be laughing?!" Tony wheezed out, still clearly having the time of his life!
piece, Steve kissed and worshipped with all he had. Tony was already panting beneath him and writhing up against Steve's body to create movement; to create friction.
Tony Stark sat in his bed, listening to the sound of the rain as his music played softly in the back. His room glowed golden as the light swam over his school books. He was going over some physics homework when he suddenly heard the sound of his father's office door banging on its hinges.
Stepping boldly in front of Thor, Wanda started weaving her fingers intricately through the air. Swirls of her red magic began to cloud Thor’s sight and his entire body swayed unsteadily. Never breaking focus, Wanda continued her spell as Thor stumbled on his feet, flailing out his arms to grab blindly at something stable. It was only a few more seconds until Wanda directed him to a kitchen chair where he collapsed not a moment later, snoring deep in sleep.
"Punk, you're only saying that to deceive yourself. You know that Pepper is opening up to you. The coffee she gave you this morning wasn't poisoned - that's gotta count for something, right?"
Logan felt only the faintest hint of jealousy at the sight. Mostly, seeing the two tangled together and knowing that he got to play as well just made it that much more intriguing. Once he got the door open, he noted that the two didn't seem to be intent on immediately going through it, and he grabbed Nat and pulled her to himself for a fast, hard kiss, one powerful arm curled around her waist. "Let's move this inside," he decided with a smirk, letting Nat go to tug Scott into the room. Logan wasted no time tugging his shirt off and tossing his belt aside, but he left the jeans in place for the moment.
"I'm gonna miss you," Steve admitted earnestly, though he smiled down at Tony. "But, hey, Pepper and I can have a slumber party and do each other's nails." All too soon one of the paramedics was pushing him back out of the way - gently, politely, but pushing all the same. Steve reluctantly went along, hating the moment when he had to let go of Tony's hand.
Without even a second glance, he threw Tony over the railing, sending the boy cascading, flying, down two floors and landing with a
Steve suddenly scooped him up bridal-style with Tony squealing adorably! The captain pecked a kiss onto Tony’s nose.
Over the course of the next few days, as soon as the statement was made to the press and media, James Rhodes and Pepper took shifts guarding Tony's hospital room and making sure he was as comfortable as possible, away from the constant prying eyes of the paparazzi.
"Oh, you like that, then baby? Huh? You like taking what I give? You wanna take my cock, huh? That it?"
He sleepily leaned up again to give his daddy a kiss on his chin and Steve's smile never left him as he continued to sing his baby to sleep:
“Tony, you don’t trust me, that I know. But this is me reaching out, offering to help a teammate… hoping to help a friend?”
The spy had cursed all who had ever harmed him as she rocked the sobbing brunette gently from side to side; rubbing his back and playing with his hair until his sniffles began to quiet down.
. Whether there is a bond or not, their connection is something deeper beyond simple Alpha-Omega DNA. It's something that many scientists and mystics believe is what was left from the glow of merging galaxies soon after The Big Bang. In layman's terms: stardust DNA."
Steve's expression softened as he walked over to Tony and knelt in front of him on the carpet. Tony flinched back at the close contact and shifted restlessly.
His eyes shot open and his focus immediately zeroed in on Tony standing in the doorway of their en-suite bathroom - probably from getting a glass of water - but his hands were over his mouth and his eyes owlishly wide!
His tearful cries overtook his breathless voice after stumbling out all of his fears. Steve’s heart shattered.
Steve looked off to the side, thinking for a moment. After a few seconds, he suddenly leaned down without hesitation and connected his lips to Tony's.
It had to be this way, because initially, I didn't want there to be a love triangle, because I have nothing against Ironstrange, but it's not my main otp, so I didn't want to have that ending, but it felt too rushed to have Tony end up with Steve as if the whole cheating issue meant nothing, so the only logical way was to take Tony away -   *cue evil chuckle!*
Everything in Steve wanted to scream at the brunette, but he’d learned quickly that it would be futile with Tony. Instead, he took a deep breath in and, without looking away from the genius, he called, “J.A.R.V.I.S, unmute.”
Natasha shushed him gently, placing her hand oh his cheek once more, softly caressing his face. She scooted next to him in the bed and helped him to sit up against the headboard. Tony’s head lolled on her shoulder. Nat directed him so that he could inhale her scent at her neck.
Well, it wasn’t like the alpha was having it easy either. He was calling almost four times a day, desperately wanting to talk to Tony. But the omega would grow quiet and scared and tried to brush it off like it wasn’t a huge thing, but Natasha could see how much he longed for his alpha.
"That you trust me." Steve's gaze was open, hopeful. It was the first time Tony had ever said something like that to him. It made his chest thump.
The scientist merely let his head fall back on Steve's shoulder, humming contently and nuzzling Steve's throat.
"ANTHONY! Don't you dare run away from me! Anthony Edward Stark!" his father called from the staircase.
“My kotynok! I’m so glad you’ve put an end to Steve’s nervousness,” Natasha threw a wink at Steve’s deadpan look.
However, Natasha thankfully averted the attention from Wanda, shooting her a comforting smile, but looked back on Tony. He was more at ease now that Thor was asleep and contained.
He could only listen and give Tony his space as he worked through what he was trying to tell Steve through these characters.
built you an art studio on your floor, Steve?" Tony breathed out. His mouth hung open, still gaping around him.
Nat came over to hug her friend tightly. She placed a small kiss on his cheek. The captain tried to relax in her hold.
The captain held him securely in his arms, soothing the tired inventor gently, “Shh… shh… There we go, now, shh… That’s it. Aw, it’s okay Tony- you’re okay Honey. Shh… There we go... There we go... Come on now, let’s get you to your room for bed.”
But Tony soon began writhing on the mattress, looking for relief as the heat and flames built inside him once more, licking under his skin.
“I believe you think you love him,” she said softly.  Most of the fight had drained out of her eyes.
Tony bucked against him, the slow pace doing nothing to stem his arousal.  "Steve..."  He wasn't even sure what he was asking for, just... begging.
Pepper raised an eyebrow.  “I did not.  I said I’d do what I could to keep the press off your back.  This is different.”  She pointed at the magazine.  “They want to interview you two as a couple, as role models for LGBT youth.  It isn’t an Avengers interview and it isn’t a Stark Industries interview – this is two very famous men in a very famous relationship being open about their struggles.  Imagine the teens you could reach, Tony.”
“Moving him in with you?  Playing it up in front of me?”  Pepper scoffed.  “You really think I’ll buy that?”
“Who the hell says deft?” Steve chuckled, kissing Tony hard as he worked two fingers in and out, adding a third.
“God, yes.”  Tony squirmed a little, making Steve moan into his mouth.  His arms came up to hold Steve tight.  “Just – just stay there a minute, baby.  Please.”
“Close,” Steve gasped.  It was the endearment more than anything – he called Tony that regularly, but rarely did Tony use it.  “God, you’re so good to me.”  His hips began to thrust wildly, and Tony managed to keep his hands where they’d most torment Steve.
Tony pressed his forehead against Steve’s shoulder, feeling tears prick at his eyes.  “Okay,” he breathed after a minute.  “I’m – you can move.”  Steve nuzzled his cheek and started to pull out, pausing when Tony let out soft whimper.  “It’s okay, I’m just – it’s – a lot.”
When they rose from the table, Steve offered Tony his hand.  “I know you’re worried about photos,” Steve murmured quietly.  “I’m not.  I’d rather they get pictures of us like this, well-fed and in love, than to try and stalk us at a battle.  Let’s choose to let them take our photos, love – where they can be safe.”
“You know, the… other stuff.  Toys.  Kink.”  Steve dipped down to nibble at the line of Tony’s neck.  “I know I’m not exactly the adventuresome type in bed.”
Steve did – fiercely.  For more reasons than Tony’s undersuited-clad body.  (God, Steve loved that undersuit.)  “I can’t.”
“Not yet,” Tony murmured against him.  He pressed his forehead into Steve’s pec.  “I’m sorry that you didn’t… have more fun at the thing tonight.  I promise they can be fun if you… if you can learn to look past the assholes.  But I… um.  I get it, if you don’t want to.  I won’t ask you to go.”
"I was in the fuckin' army, Tony," Steve reminded him.  He'd have snapped his hips forward but -- despite being hard enough to pound nails -- he didn't want to hurt Tony.  "You feel so good."  The words were inadequate to describe the sensation.  He leaned forward until he could wrap one arm around Tony's waist, propping himself up with the other.
Well.  That was clear enough.  Gripping his cock to stave off an embarrassing finish, Tony pushed the head of his cock into Steve’s hole, grunting as the tight heat closed around him.  “God, you’re always so tight,” Tony moaned.
Clint waited until the elevator door shut on their captain and co-leader before he reached out and smacked the back of Bruce’s head.  “Doc, you fucked up.”
The supersoldier dragged himself out of the bed and held out his hand for Tony.  “Shower.  Right.  And then all the sleep.”
“He’s just surprised, love,” Steve said in a low voice, glancing at Bruce.  “He’ll come around.  Look how long it took us to wrap our heads around it.  We can give him a pass for a little bit, yeah?”  He lifted his hand and stroked Tony’s cheek.  “Rule two, doll.  This time I’m citin’ it, and I mean it.  We ain’t got nothin’ to be ashamed of, sweetheart, and I ain’t hidin’ this from our family.”
“I love you too, Steve Rogers – but if you call me Anthony again, it might be a dealbreaker.”  Tony’s hands came up to clasp Steve’s wrists.  They were both aware he wasn’t serious… just lightening the mood, before it became cloying.
“I know.”  Tony tugged at the thighs of Steve’s sweat pants until they slid down, revealing the toned muscles.  Another tug, and the plain boxers were removed as well.  Tony sucked in a breath as Steve’s cock was revealed – it was always a little awe-inspiring.  Jokes aside, the serum had been kind to Steve… and Tony definitely appreciated the benefits.  Leaning forward, he placed a kiss just at the base of Steve’s cock.
Tony rolled his eyes, looking up at Steve.  “Shut up, Rogers,” Tony murmured with his lips almost against Steve’s cock – because he knew the vibrations would drive Steve mad.  Rather than argue the point further, he extended his tongue and ran it the full length of Steve’s cock, along the vein on the bottom.
“It’s alright,” Steve said softly.  He forced himself to put out of mind his four teammates in the gym, and focus only on his partner.  “Tony, I’m okay.”  He held out his hands.  “Come here, it’s okay.”
“You like my ass.”  Steve wiggled it in the air, grinning.  “I’ve got proof.”  He dove back into the blow-job, still smiling.
“Thank fuck for that, because I’m so hard I can barely stand it.”  Tony got up off the bed to dig in his nightstand for lube.  “You need a breather, or…?”
By dancing, Tony was desperate to figure out what he’d done to fuck this up – because Steve was not okay.
That’s all it took, and Steve’s hand tightened on his skull as orgasm seized him.  Even in the throes of it, Steve didn’t pull – just held on as his hips bucked and his cock pulsed.
Apparently that was mutual need, because as soon as Steve was within reach, he was kissing Tony hungrily.  “Never enough,” he mumbled against Tony’s lips.  “God, I can never get enough of you.”  He didn’t leave Tony time to dwell on that, though.  Grasping his cock, Steve nudged it against Tony’s hole, then slid home.  “So tight for me,” Steve gasped.  “You feel so good, doll.”
After what felt like an eternity to Tony, Steve began to move.  He kept his movements slow at first, dragging almost completely out before pressing in again, grinding deep with each thrust.  On the fourth pass, he found Tony’s prostate, causing him to shout and nearly come up off the mat.
Seeing Tony like that beneath him – desperate and pleaded – lit something in Steve.  “Mine,” he bit out, dropping his head to kiss Tony’s neck.  “You’re mine.”  His pace picked up until he was thrusting almost too hard – almost too fast.  They were both groaning, fingers clawing at skin and breath catching in their chests.  “No one else gets to see you like this doll, never again.”  He bit down on the flesh of Tony’s shoulder, his hips stuttering.
Bruce watched the two of them, his eyebrows drawn together.  “What triggered that panic attack, Tony?”
Steve looked back over his shoulder at Tony, lips curving in that trollish smile.  “Nah.  Wanted to be called Sir, though.”
Sensing all was not right, Tony cupped a hand around the back of Steve’s neck.  “It’s alright to not be okay, you know.”
Shaking her head, Pepper let herself out.  Maybe she’d go visit Natasha… and they could discuss how obnoxiously cute the pair was.  Besides, Nat was very good at manipulating the press… she’d be an excellent ally.
Perhaps he should be grateful that Tony was facing away and couldn’t see his face.  Steve wasn’t sure if he wanted to rage or cry.  “Sorry.”  If he could have reached him, he’d have run a comforting caress down the line of Tony’s back.
Naked now, Tony sat down on the edge of the bed to watch Steve.  “You’re beautiful,” he murmured.  “Not just your body – although, hello, duh! – but you have the most expressive eyes.”  Tony held out his hands for Steve, who came to him willingly.  “I could get lost in them.”
“I mean it.”  Steve cupped his hands around Tony’s face.  “Maybe not yet – I’m kind of enjoying where we’re at right now.  But I can see trading up titles in the future.”  He drew Tony in for a kiss, shifted to breath in his ear.  “Maybe upgrading from partner to husband?”
“I ain’t been virtuous since 1932,” Steve smirked.  “And even afore that, it was questionable.”  His toes slid into Tony’s lap, nimbly massaging the already hardening cock.
“Measure of experience.”  Tony folded his hands behind his head, watching Steve with a small smile.  “You gonna put on a show for me, soldier boy?  Should I have J queue up your USO theme?”
“It’s to make up for that dirty, filthy mouth of yours,” Steve laughed, capturing his lips for a kiss.  “Let’s make it quick.  I want a cuddle.”
“You let me know if that changes, alright?”  Tony accepted murmured agreement before returning his attention to Steve’s ass.  He stroked all over with callused fingers, following with measured kisses.  He heard Steve’s breath pick up as he edged closer to his hole, and had to grin.  Steve liked to eat him out – but Tony didn’t often return the favor.  Not because he didn’t enjoy it… he wasn’t actually sure why it didn’t happen more often.  Well, that would just make this more intense for his lover.  Tony used both hands to spread Steve’s ass open and just breathed across his hole, making the supersoldier whine.  Chuckling, Tony leaned in and started lightly licking around the rim, barely touching.
“I don’t listen?!” Steve barked back, incredulously.  “You flew into hostile fire when I expressly told you to stay the fuck back—”
“No!”  Tony tugged on Steve’s arms until they were tighter around him.  “Just… making expectations clear.”
“You.”  It was an automatic response, but no less sincere.  Tony stepped out of his pants and boxers, wrapping his arms around Steve.  “Just… you.”
“Serum,” Steve panted, trying not to rush Tony.  He wanted to thrust back, to take him all right now please thank you, but he also didn’t want it to be over yet.  So… patience.  “Haven’t gotten loose since before Rebirth.”
He was close – and he obliged his lover, blue eyes meeting brown and holding.  The prolonged eye contact was as intimate as their lovemaking – more so, at times – and it was just what Steve needed to send him over the edge.  He pumped Tony’s cock in his hand, hoping to bring him to completion as well – hoping, and succeeding.  Tony spilled between them, pulsing in long ribbons as Steve emptied himself into his lover, gasping.
“Not real picky about the position,” Tony told him, sliding his hands down Steve’s sides.  “We haven’t managed to have bad sex yet, I don’t think we’ll start now.”  He stood up – and Steve made a small and quickly stifled sound.  “I’m just grabbing the lube, baby.  I’ll be right back.”
Tony was silent a long moment, his arm snug around Steve’s waist.  “Do we need to have a conversation?”
“I’m just saying, rules should be applied equally.”  Tony looked away, almost shyly.  “And I don’t particularly want to lose you, either.”  His fingers twitched in Steve’s hair, turning into a steady caress.  “And not just because I don’t want to be blamed for losing Captain America.”
The first inch – that first stretch – God, Steve loved it.  He arched his back, taking more in with a deep groan.  Mindful of Tony’s concern, he didn’t rush to take all of Tony – though he wanted to.  Wanted to feel Tony’s cock deep inside him, claiming him completely.
“Poetic little shit.”  Tony squirmed beneath him – which did lovely things to Steve’s cock – and managed to kick off his boxers and lounge pants.  “You know what I think?”
“And miss out on my post-fight ride?  Come on, Cap.”  Tony tried to make light of it – really.  “I’ve been watching that ass for hours, you wouldn’t ask me to deny myself now, would you?”
Maybe it was the brevity of the answer or something in the tone, but Tony’s eyes were drawn to Steve’s.  “Hey.”  Tony caught his hands where they were starting to peel the uniform down his hips and stilled them.  “We don’t have to do this, Steve.  I just thought – I thought it might help, not to be alone.”
“You like the risk,” Steve accused, nipping at Tony’s neck as the elevator rose.  “Fuckin’ exhibitionist.”
Steve cupped his hands on Tony’s ass, chuckling as the engineer hummed in eager response.  “You wanna move this to the bedroom, doll?  This position is hard on your knees.”
“Yes, sir.”  Steve set a steady rhythm, punctuating it with deep kisses.  It was a leisurely build-up, this time – not hurtling towards the precipice at top speed, but allowing it to build gradually.  Steve propped himself up on one hand (which had the added advantage of making his biceps flex in a way he knew Tony appreciated) so that he could reach between them and grasp Tony’s cock, adding to the sensations.
“Okay.”  Tony cupped the back of his head.  “You need tender, then?”  Steve’s eyes stung and he nodded.  “On one condition.”
It felt different to run his hands over Tony’s body now – fresh, and almost sacred.  He bent his head to Tony’s chest, pausing when he felt the engineer’s breath catch.  “Is this okay, doll?”
It didn’t take long for him to find it.  Tony jolted when one long finger rubbed against his prostate, letting out a moan.  “Jesus, Steve.”  It made the soldier grin against his neck.  Tony looped his hand around the back of Steve’s neck again, the other clutching the bedsheets.
He teased Tony all throughout dinner – never to the point of discomfort, but always touching.  Tony was almost dizzy with arousal – and an even headier feeling of having Steve’s complete attention.  He couldn’t remember the last time someone had been so focused on him – so absolute in their awareness.
“Forty-sixty,” Tony answered candidly, leaning against Steve.  “Maybe thirty-seventy.  I know openness is your thing, and I’m glad we’re not a secret anymore, but…”
“Yeah.”  Tony smiled a little.  “But your Cap sensibilities are going to insist on doing the responsible thing.”
Prior to their renegotiation of the rules, that would have left Tony and Steve both a little… edgy.  No fighting meant no post-battle sex.
“Before we break for today,” Fury said, leaning forward over the conference table.  “I wanted to compliment you on your handling of Stark.”
“It is my pleasure, Sir.”  There was a loaded pause.  “Perhaps you would consider listening to – and answering – your voice messages.”
Tony manages back to the penthouse on his own. He doesn’t want to think about cleaning up, seeing Loki off. There’s time, though, before the departure should take place, and now free from the suit, he asks JARVIS for some music.
“The SHIELD doesn’t control me any longer,” he says with a soft tone of awe. “They’ve told their stories of Captain America and Nomad, and I refusing to acquiesce any longer. I’m free now. We can run away, and I’ll never let you go.”
“Woah woah woah, I’m not taking anything that’s gonna mess with my memories!” Incensed, Tony began to stomp after the Director.
I don’t see a way out. I only see darkness for myself and for our world. It’s up to you now to carry the burden I can no longer bear. I’m so sorry to leave it to you, but I know it’s you who can make sense of this, carry on the fight, lead the defense for our world. I know SHIELD will support you in this too.
“Pink Floyd. Classic. Catch up with the now-times, Cap.” Tony’s digitized voice competes with the music in Steve’s head.
you felt, it was all thanks to that microscopic foreign mind-controlling device. It was all for the Chitauri’s gain, it was all to destroy us. All you felt was a manipulation aimed to get us all
“Stark, what the hell is this?” Steve shouts into the comms over a blaring bass guitar riff and anxiety-inducing crescendo of electric keys.
If you could extend my condolences to Rhodey, and to Pepper, I would appreciate it. God knows she’s been through hell. I’ll write them when I have time, but until then, thank you for relaying my sentiments.
Steve takes a long, deep sigh, one Tony knows too well, like he so often does when he contemplates his life’s greatest regrets. “What you know of the story of Captain America is mostly true. I was an underdog indentured for Project Rebirth, helped to end the great war, and went down with my aircraft for several decades.” He nods once, which Tony reciprocates to indicate that he follows. “The SHIELD found me almost a year before the world met Captain America again. They didn’t know if I was stable, capable to return to duty. They appointed me as a knight of the SHIELD, and afforded me a mostly provincial life. Then,”
“Nothing’s making us do this. Why do you keep saying that?” Tony stood, tone biting, and Steve started to wonder if Tony really believed in the fight against Fury’s insistence.
Steve has to fix this, he has to change this, there has to be a way for this to not be an eternal sacrifice.
“Now who in their right mind would ask a pirate as handsome as yourself to do anything against his own prerogative? Especially with that menacing blade.” He jostled the plastic hilt teasingly. “They’d have to be crazy!”
“It’s ok, I understand. If you go back to sleep, is there something I can do to keep the bad dreams away?”
The weight of the ring was nearly imperceptible when it sat in his palm. It’s mate had been destroyed, it was the last of its kind. Forged as a symbol of unending love, created in tandem, it was now all that remained. Steve couldn’t resist any longer, he knew its time had come to return to the crucible from which it was born. The resolution nearing now felt more like a manipulation than anything else he was being told about what the Chitauri did to them, about how the piece of jewelry originated. Once dismantled, there would be no evidence of what he once had with Tony. They kept telling him, “things will go back to normal.” But Steve didn’t know where normal began, or how far back he’d have to go for them to say he’d found it.
Their lips met and it was like a bolt of lightning struck his brain. Every nerve ending was buzzing with bliss, and he was shaky and nervous and the best he’d ever felt in his entire life all at once. He didn’t know if it was how Steve felt or himself, it was all so new and consuming, he wanted more, and he wanted it to never end.
For now, he decides to stay, refuse the insistent requests from Pepper and Rhodey, and let another song play.
“So, anyway, I just wonder if your serum has something to do with the extent to which I feel what you’ve experienced. I would have hypothesized that it would lessen the psychological effects of the trauma you’ve endured, since I know you heal physically at an incredible rate. I guess it doesn’t extend to the mind.”
I’m seduced by the dream of one day holding him again. The golden strand’s pull is still taut, although I don’t know how that’s possible. But, when I attend Tony’s funeral, I’ll say goodbye, and I’ll mean it. If this thread keeps pulling my heart, I’ll trust it, I’ll follow it. I traveled through time to find him, and I arrived here. He always was my guiding light.
Even if I’m shrouded in darkness, even though the sun has been extinguished, I now know what path I am to follow to protect his legacy. If I couldn’t protect him in life, I’ll forever protect him in death.
“Nah, babe, see here? If I carve out just a little from around this ring-” Tony traced a soot-stained finger along a thin, silver groove, “and remove the exact same amount from these two as well, your giant frisbee will still sail through the air just like always.”
Steve stalled for a moment. Of course this was his hope, and his intention. But hearing the words spoken aloud overcame him with an ineffable wonder.
He’d almost lost what he didn’t know he even had. His soulmate was here with him, holding on to him, and had never given up on him. Not the time when he absconded to track down the most lethal assassin in history, not the time when he took down an entire governmental agency in his pursuit of the assassin, not when he continuously berated his soulmate in front of their shared team, not when he lost trust in the man and let everybody know it, not when he betrayed his soulmate in favor of others and attacked him viciously. Not even when the world ended did this man leave his side, and now, now he’d failed Tony again, in such a way that he wasn’t sure he could come back from after expending all of the chances he’d never earned.
I never told you this, but I knew something about Tony. I never told him, either. I wanted him to change his mind about me, first.
This is a novel thought that sends a vile wave of nausea through him, something he’d never considered about the implications of what an alien invasion could lead to, and he’s interpreting it as a bad thing in the present moment. Maybe intergalactic-human relations could be good, or consensual somehow, at some point, but that’s not the Chitauri’s goal today. Steve pushes the horrific thought away.
Steve awoke to labored breathing and a whimper. He couldn’t be sure of the time, but it didn’t feel as though he had been asleep very long. Through the haze of slumber, he wiped a hand down his face and scanned the room. Tony was in his bed, asleep, but clearly not comfortably. Steve watched only to witness the fit grow, escalating quickly into whimpers and cries of incomprehensible vowels. Tony was in distress, and not showing any indication of waking.
Something - gravity, perhaps? - pulls at his back, he feels like he’s being sucked backward, and he hopes hopes
“Well, you see,” he sighed, “once I’ve had one and woken up, I really can’t get back to sleep. I should probably get to the workshop, let you get some sleep now that you’re in your own bed. It’s better if I distract myself with something novel.”
Truthfully, he was still baffled too, but he didn’t want to admit it. None of it quite made sense. But, maybe the reason why the mystery had been solved didn’t really matter. Having Tony as his soulmate was his greatest reward, after all. With his life's biggest curiosity now satisfied, he was quite unexpectedly enraptured by an even greater mystery - learning everything there was to know about his soulmate.
“Or maybe it makes it worse.” Steve let out a heavy sigh. “This is all just so unbelievable. I never would have thought, in the future…” He threw his arms up to gesture to Tony and the space they shared.
Enticed by the flash of a memory from last night, Steve paused. He remembered what it was like when they were connected. Touching Tony’s naked skin felt like touching electrified velvet every time. It was novel, tantalizing, and insanely addictive. The intimacy they shared was overwhelming to his every faculty, a force that rendered Steve powerless to overcome. He was desperate to feel what he once did, something that could strike his soul, a sensation he had long since lost. In his reckless plight, he made sure to push further each time, roughly claiming Tony’s body in ways he hadn’t dreamt of. Tony didn’t ask for it, but of course he wanted it. He had to have wanted it.
Tony listens, really listens, and looks deep into Steve’s eyes. He’s heard this before, and while it has a catchy beat, he’s never really taken the lyrics to be meaningful until now.
My mind is an endless space of darkness and shadow. I try to follow a thought, and only echoes remain.
He heard Tony's insincere words. Every one of them baffled him. However, slowly, he began to understand the thin thread of truth in Tony’s grandeur.
“I know you will. That’s not the point.” He drew nearer to the super soldier, feeling a compulsion to give his shoulder a firm squeeze, maybe wrap his arms around him, bring him into the comfort of a hug. How long had it been since Steve had been hugged?
Steve couldn’t help but to immediately remove the tools from the genius’ hands and wrestle him to the ground. So, the ring would get done tomorrow. Tony always worked well under a deadline, anyway.
He and Steve are practically from different worlds. Adrenaline and fear fueled his dying wish to see Steve again, and now that he has, well, he can’t envision a world where they could make it work. Whatever ‘it’ is. It doesn’t matter. Tony’s a mess, after all, and a delusional sap to think he and Steve could accomplish anything without fighting, tearing each other apart, no matter how hard he’s fallen for the man.
It was awkward, offering comfort to Captain America over his dad’s death. The moment passed quickly when a jet zoomed past the window, catching Steve’s attention. Tony felt overwhelmed by the flash of movement and the soft sound the jet emitted. Logically, he knew it was an occurrence he’d experienced a million times. But his whole body jumped, rattled by something that now felt completely foreign. He felt the temperature dropping, too, as a sudden chill ran through his body.
Hand-in-hand, they entered the sterile office. The bright white color of the walls and furniture were unnerving to Steve since the first time he set foot in the medical bay. It was a somber mood, even though no one spoke a word.
“Perhaps you never knew me to begin with. Have you considered the alternative should I have left you? You don’t know what those thieves desired. I’ve saved you from your fate.”
I was his soulmate. Tony wouldn’t have known this - he told me all the damage to his heart destroyed the faint tug he once felt ages ago. I never told him...there’s so much I never told him. I should have, but I didn’t. He didn’t want me, and my doubts whisper to me that even if he knew we were intended to be bonded, it wouldn’t have changed a thing. I know I should have told him, but I so desperately wanted him to want me without knowing this. Even so, knowing I was his soulmate, I still feel the golden thread tugging at my heart, guiding me to him. I don’t know how that’s possible to feel in death. I think it was the only thing that kept us connected all these years.
"He's right, though, Clint." Steve had noted the odd tone of Coulson's voice as well, and he wasn't sure how awkward things were going to get if he didn't step in. Whatever issues the two men had to work out between themselves, he knew they'd manage it given time. "You aren't expendable, and neither are Summers or Logan or Natasha." He waited until Clint looked at him again before assuring the man, "If turning Loki into a stain on the floor is the way we end this, that's what we're doing."
Tony Stark dragged another handful of files from his rollout laptop to the floating monitors posted around the airship's lab. Screams, angry growls, and firearm blasts from five different videos of varying quality and clarity blared from the room's surround sound, and Tony winced internally as he beheld the mess the subject of the films was capable of creating. "Fury's been eating paint chips. Banner's enough of a handful." He glanced up as Steve walked through the door. "Oh, good. Then they told you we've got a new project, Cap?" He flipped one of the screens around so that Steve could see it and hit the slow button.
Phil didn't bother trying to hide the way his breath hitched at the roll of Clint's hips. His lips parted, and his eyes locked with Clint's. "If it helps, I was definitely flustered, then turned on, then impatient. I really didn't expect any of it. Not to put down my romantic prowess, but I'm not your usual."
Loki appeared with a flourish at the back of the cavernous space. "Remarkably easy to clear such a massive structure. I suspect SHIELD was rather proactive in chasing off the locals?" He strode forward as if none of them posed any particular threat - and he didn't really suspect that they did. Various Brotherhood members soon filtered in from the sides to take positions as well. "I hope you weren't waiting too long for us, but making a truly wonderful entrance is impossible for me to resist."
Magneto looked surprised and not just a little irritated, but otherwise unimpressed. "Shame. Such an advanced race, and you're still wielding sharpened metal sticks," he intoned, standing and casually lifting the blade in Sif's hands, bringing her with it. "My dear, you clearly have no clue what you're dealing with."
"Good. We'll be in the infirmary if we're needed." It was with a lighter heart that Phil led Clint toward the infirmary. The sooner they both got a clean bill of health and filed a quick report, the sooner he could get some sleep. Reaching out, he put a hand on Clint's shoulder. "For the record? I'm proud of you. I don't think everybody could have put it down and given that up. You did good."
