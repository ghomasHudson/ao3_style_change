Steve smiles something vicious that doesn’t suit him. “Guess you’re just a common criminal like the rest of us, now.”
“I didn’t ask for that,” Steve croaks.
“I think psychoanalysis is not part of these proceedings,” Steve says mildly.
The House Oversight Committee for Metahuman Activity gets wind of the whole mess with Gadget and Graviton and Tony Stark’s Unassailable Ego. His administrative leave quietly turns into ‘house arrest.’
“Steve,” the voice says, and that’s when Steve loses control of his body.
“Yes,” he breathes. “Yes.”
Tony wants to tell him he's already lodged. That he wouldn't know where to begin the process of excision. That the problem has always been the two of them, living, dying, entangled.
Steve has imagined this, a lot.
It’s different, with Extremis locked down. The shapes of his dreams burn brighter than his waking life does. He looks at his hands, feels the pounding of the foreign thing in his chest. Remembers the raw thrill of being
He catches a glimpse of the red soaking through Steve’s uniform before someone is smashing his head into the floor.
He regrets that, he thinks wildly. He aches and Steve won’t hear his apologies and he can do is stare up into Steve’s lifeless eyes and at the halo the ash-filled sky makes around his head.
“Do you want to come,” Steve murmurs, and Tony nods wordless assent.
He’s never going to fly again.
“Is this what you’re getting in Wakanda,” Tony is saying. “Do you let Barnes and Sam double-team you like this, Steve, is that why you’re so hard right now?” He presses the thing all the way into Steve’s mouth.
, I need more, touch me, talk to me, please –"
“You’re not trying,” Steve says.
He is masterful as he fits the full jock over Tony’s constrained genitals, barely touching, clinical, rough when contact has to be made. He pushes Tony’s legs apart, coaxes him up on his knees to get the straps around his legs, yanks the buckles into place a little harder than necessary. He is very careful not to look at Tony’s face, because if he does, Tony will never leave the boudoir and Steve won’t make his mission call. It’s difficult, but Steve is a man of control and restraint. He contents himself with the knowledge that he will have his intimate dominion over Tony’s body later, at his pleasure, for as long as he wants.
“Let me see,” Tony says, and he’s there, forcing Steve to open his fist, hot and warm and alive. “Ok, hey, I’m sorry,” Tony says, “Look, you’re already healing–”
Steve climbs in behind him, nudges Tony’s knees up, throws one leg carefully over Tony’s thigh. Wraps an arm around his chest. Kisses his neck.
“What a concept,” Steve says, and Tony grits his teeth. “How does accountability feel, Tony?” He stalks across the cargo area, proud and tall and pale as death.
“I think this is between you and Tony,” he keeps saying, but Tony won’t take the fucking phone call, so Commander Stark just stands there on the sat phone while his team waits, just looks at the useless piece of plastic in his hand.
“I will put you on the Latveria detail,” Laila tells Shepherd.
Steve blinks. “Right now?”
Tony pulls him down for a kiss. And keeps kissing him, keeps licking into his mouth,
“Are you okay,” Steve pants.
Tony opens his mouth. “I meant what I said, if you need–”
Tony jerks, and bites back a scream as pain lights through him. He falls on his broken wrist, and Steve pushes his hips down. A warning. The sheets abrade his oversensitive skin. He tries to push up on his elbows and notices not one, but four Androderm patches on his forearm in a neat little row before his shoulder gives out and he falls hard.
“You’re brilliant,” Steve says, and leans in to brush a kiss against Tony’s lips.
“You’re this perfect thing,” Tony says, and gestures uselessly with his hands, “you forgive me when I shouldn’t be forgiven, you’ve forgiven me for things I can’t even remember and you
“Maybe you’re not cut out for this,” Steve croaks out. “Maybe I should go.”
Steve makes a decision and lays back, his bare skin against the increasingly sticky leather, and reaches for Tony.
He feels as though he’s sleepwalking to the end of his life, and he doesn’t care.
mouth shut.”
. He deserves it. It’s more than fair.
Steve’s gaze keeps drifting back to that thing shining in his chest. The skin around it is red and angry and tender, like Tony is somehow generating new scar tissue before Steve’s very eyes.
Tony downs his entire glass, sticks his hands in his pocket. Regards him.
Steve sits next to him, turns Tony’s hand over in his own. Perfect. No scars, no record of all the things he’s built, all the things he’s fixed with his own blood. “I thought I was watching you die,” Steve says, and he is suddenly, quietly seething.
Steve swears. “Don’t move,” he says, like Tony is going anywhere. He trots out to the kitchen, takes the kettle off the heat, and slams it down on an unused burner like it’s personally targeted him. He grabs Tony’s coffee, and digs around in the bag for an everything bagel – still warm, good. He snatches a blanket off the couch on his way back.
There’s no mud on his jacket. The piece of paper with Steve’s eulogy is soaked through. His words look like they’re dissolving off the page. He balls it up and whispers it to himself under his breath.
Steve appears to him one night in the workshop, shrunken and haunted and something hungry in his eyes, and Tony grabs the nearest thing – a tire iron – and swings at his ghost until he shatters the glass double-doors leading to his workshop and sets off an alarm that brings half of SHIELD to the tower.
“You’re having a panic attack,” Leonard tells him, and leans forward, puts his hands on Tony’s knees.
, his brain supplies,
They’re not going to bring him Sampson. He will be surprised if he makes it to the Negative Zone. He thinks about the sea of faceless protestors. He thinks about the footage of Steve choking on his own blood with rotten fruit on his face.
Tony holds his hands out for chains through a hole in the barrier.
, obviously, but he’s a big boy, everyone in the city knows what this place is for. Maybe he’s one of those guys who wants to be ruined.
, Steve wants to scream. He doesn’t understand.
God, how did he ever think he could handle any of this.
“Don’t say that,” Steve says, hideously embarrassed, Christ, he can feel the blush all the way down to his chest.
He should be gearing up. The music is thrumming upstairs, even though it’s still early – dance floor won’t be packed yet, Rubell will be back outside in a flash to continue his little admission power play. Tony’s camped out in this useless puce room downstairs for VIPs, a room that could be filled with beautiful women or beautiful men or both. Tony is a little drunk but his hands are steady enough to move smoothly over the rails, to draw his powder into four neat little rails. Tony rolls up a hundred and feels Rubell’s arm draped over his back as he leans over the table.  Rubell has a radio jockey voice.
Tony looks at the ceiling and sighs and blinks and blinks and blinks. “I honestly don’t know what you get out of this,” he says.
Tony lies there on the couch looking more apprehensive than enthusiastic, so Steve just strokes his hand down Tony’s thigh. “You don’t have to do anything,” Steve says. Tony’s face is still wet.
“Cool, don’t give a shit – the point is the only reason they’re not sending you to The Hague is because Maya Hansen gets the last say on your powers and they’re saying you’re too dangerous to put in any of the ICC’s facilities–”
“Your taste in partners is consistently terrible,” Steve agrees. He’s perched on the edge of the conference table, picking at the shreds of his uniform.
“I’m not extorting you,” Steve breathes, when they’re gone.
for this,” Tony shouts over him, with his snotty nose and his hands balled into fists. “Let me have this one fucking thing, Steve –”
Unaware of the danger, this man is all hands, confident and deft. They rove over Steve’s neck, his ears, tangling in the hair at his nape. He’s not as hard as Steve is but he keeps moving his hips like he’s lost in himself and Steve is deeply, fiercely envious of his freedom.
He has imagined this so many times in dreams, in nightmares, in the warm circle of Steve's arms, on the cot in his workshop all alone, locked away. He has imagined this laid onto Afghanistan laid atop Siberia until the entire future looks like a black maw when he closes his eyes. He's rehearsed so many times. His existence must now defy probability.
” Tony mumbles. “It could literally be anyone, take your pick, I put half of the superhuman community in prison and I got Captain America shot and all my friends are dead and all my partners fucking
“You’re fighting,” the man hisses in this awful wretched whisper. “Stop fighting and it will be easier.”
he lies, and tries not to crane his neck to look at the skin on Tony’s chest where it’s disappearing into his skin. It’s almost gone now; it’s almost fully in his chest. It feels like the beginning of something terrible.
, something in him answers – and wakes up to find the pages ripped out and thrown across the room.
Jen tells him to stick to the cards.
Futurist, he would always tell anyone who wanted to listen. It was his byline. People stopped seeing him, after a while.
He rounds a corner and the women break into a jog to join a horde of people spilling out into the middle of the street.
“I don’t want to get into this,” Tony says, and tucks his cock back into his pants.
drowns out even the antiseptic, the industrial sizing on the never-used upholstery. He opens his mouth to tell them to fight somewhere else but there's a tube in his throat and the place where Steve's bite sits on his throat feels swollen and full.
Tony rolls his sleeves up, picks at the buckle on his watch. Steps up to Steve, finds the clasp for the gag. Looks Steve in the eye, pulls out the gag inch by inch; Steve can feel it sliding out of his throat. He chokes, and Tony smiles. Tony lets it dangle around his neck.
“How are you doing,” she says.
Steve's hand drapes over his shoulder. He rests it there, dirty. He won't make the move. Tony thinks it diminishes him, that part of his mythos is being a human that never falters.
Steve is just getting inside his body as he passes out.
“What does that even mean,” Steve cuts in, “you had two heart attacks and you just wanna
. Rubs them together, cuts his feet in closer, moves his hips like a pole dancer. Lays hands on Tony like Tony is art, skims the flats of his palms down Tony’s sides until Tony is squirming.
he wants to say, but he’s already dressed to show a little too much skin. He doesn’t want to give people the wrong idea, he feels naked in his costume, he can’t do fifteen dollars. Maybe on Tony’s budget, maybe in another time. Maybe if Steve wasn’t living from thankless gig to thankless gig. He turns to go; he’s got piles of sketches waiting to be worked on, it’s Saturday, he can catch Fantasy Island if there’s no crime between here and his walk back to the Village –
It’s a bad week. One of Tony’s missiles blows up an entire squadron of Special Forces in Afghanistan, and Tony takes the opportunity to take it personally. The tower is crawling with reporters, so Tony’s response is to sleep it off and hope it goes away.
It’s ok, he thinks.
“Leave it,” Tony says, the first thing he’s said in a while. He’s panting, his head bumping against the armrest as Steve thrusts into him, his hand loose around his cock.
Steve smiled like it was his own private joke. He had no business being in that war, he said.
Steve’s eyes roll back behind his closed eyes.
Tony levers himself up, carefully. The pain shoots up his spine, and the monitor spikes momentarily. He fixes his IV. Looks at the list, changes the bag. Pushes himself pain meds. Takes his temperature - finally, no fever. Reaches behind him to feel at the little wet spot on his gown.
because he's a little bit of a whore and Steve is too noble to ever do it, but –
He’s glitching. He’s not supposed to glitch anymore. He’s pieced himself together with patch after patch. He can't touch Extremis. He's been bound in every conceivable fashion.
You smell like a stranger, Tony bursts. He hasn't seen Steve smile. Steve hasn't tried to make him laugh. Steve hasn't expressed love or contrition or anything beyond naked obligation. You never called, Tony presses, and there it is, all the hurts he thought he was better than. You didn't give me a single fucking indication that you gave a shit about me. You put your shield in my chest.
He feels his blood pumping in his ears, tries and fails to bring his hands up to cover his head, gets a boot to the side of his head and a ring springs up and drowns everything out.
Tony spends his nights here, now, Steve realizes, and it hits him all at once, the coke, god, the coke, the bags under his eyes. Did the Avengers find out? Did Tony tell them? Oh, god, Tony can never go back, Steve can never go back –
Steve’s vision whites out and the attendant pain is enough to make him scream no matter how much he grits his jaw and bites down on his own lip.
It leaves Tony gasping. It takes everything he has not to scream. His chest is burning, it is so close to when Steve had his shield in Tony's chest he is certain this must be some sadistic, karmic lesson. He twists his torso around as much as he can, dry-heaves.
“All the nostalgia in the world won’t persuade me to take your charity, Tony.”
Then he arranges his face into something that looks a lot like his goddamn
Tony kicks at him. Steve is strong enough to sweep him back to bed, Steve is restrained enough to ask if he wants more Percocet before he puts more of it in Tony's IV, Steve is so good. So polite. So fucking infuriating in the way he tries to make his contrition acceptable.
One of the women is talking about Jimmy Carter. “I don’t know,” she says. “I just don’t like him.”
There were enough parachutes, Steve said. But some people make up their minds. Some people are gone.
He’s Nomad, now. The garishness of his costume helps a little but he still feels like a predator, sometimes. The difference between hero and vigilante stalker is the press team, he thinks. Tony’s money earned him freedoms he took for granted. He’s been careful enough that he’s only made the papers twice now in three years – blurry photo on both occasions, police blotter mentions.
You're never gonna forgive yourself when you're sober, Tony spits. The fuck were you thinking.
“Look at his costume,” Tony hears, like someone is whispering in his ear, and sees something red and black flit across his vision.
They help Tony conceal the glow of the alarm that means Steve is no longer the center of his universe.
“Is this helping?” Steve pants.
“Maybe you should be careful about pushing
She rubs his back. She’s not supposed to do that, he’s in custody. She says soothing things under her breath.
Tony, because he’s Tony, is the one that ends up apologizing while Steve opens and closes his mouth like a coward.
Steve pushes something in Tony's IV and it burns when it hits his vein.
, Tony would say.
Steve anchors his hands on Tony's shoulder, and hip, rests his weight, bottoms out,
Would you like me to leave, Steve asks. If that's what you want -
Tony lets the strap go and Steve sucks in air through his nose and tries to blink the colors away. He’s moaning, he wants it again already, he wants Tony to personally wring his neck for eternity –
“Yeah, I know, 'the mission,' you’re addicted to adrenaline, whatever,” Tony says, and Steve is reminded that Tony is one of the smartest men in the world.
“Do I need to have you admitted to the Baltimore facility,” she says.
You can’t fucking reschedule a funeral, Tony,” she seethes.
“You leave all your dates high and dry?” Tony says, spinning his armor with words like the hurt isn’t spackled all over his face, but Steve knows better. He’s known him too long. This part is ugly, without the cloak of sex and drugs and anonymity. Steve is a stranger, it’s nothing. They have nothing, in this alley, on this night.
Tony asks him, breathless, hysterical,
Steve has learned, since then, to pry. Tony can't be left to his own thoughts in this hollow shell of a home, he'll drown. He won't make it.
because you're on a
“Listen, I’m not–”
The second time, Steve is home. He works from a desk now. He thinks he should want it more than he does. He would have killed for the safety of a walnut-paneled room, mounds of paperwork, scads of bureaucrats to manage when he was bullet-catching in Nazi-occupied Germany. And that was another life, Howard likes to remind him. Long ago, far away.
He opens a laptop and watches shiny new code scroll out on the screen. It’s just maintenance. He will find the bug; he will go through every line of his own coding. He will be unassailable. He will fix this.
“You know, the only person who’s been consistently right about the outcome of this little thought experiment of yours is
Stop, Tony whispers. He strokes Steve's cheek. Try fucking me, he says.
“Stay awake, Tony,” he murmurs.
“I can pretend this never happened,” Tony breathes. His eyelashes are very long. They’re face-to-face, chest-to-chest.
“Fuck,” Tony says, and his eyes are wet, and all the anger Steve thought he’d worked out on his run comes rushing back. Tony sees Steve, then, startles so hard Steve actually drops his shield and raises his hands. Tony deflates, casts his eyes around like he’s been caught. The sink is full of bandages. He sways unsteadily.
Tony kisses him back. Pulls away. Brings one hand up to Steve’s face, thumbs at the tear that’s trickled down over Steve’s lips. “Steve,” he says. “Talk to me.”
“Tony,” Steve says helplessly.
Tony stops trying to move.
Maybe he shouldn’t have let this happen. Maybe he shouldn’t have let himself fall in love so quickly. He twists his wedding band on his finger and wonders if there’s anything he can do to quell the burgeoning resentment curling in his belly. Did the serum do that, too? Has he gone soft? Was he always sharp edges or is this a consequence of existing out of time?
The thing he will never say aloud:
, Stark. All you had to do was
It feels like being buried. It feels like Malibu, like he's drowning in all that rubble.
- - -
“Lucky guy,” the man says, and winks.
It’s a man’s voice. Gentle, hesitant. Sad. It inspires something reckless in him.
. Like Tony’s name was a prayer.
So that’s it, then. Keep Tony happy, but not too happy. Just until – just until.
Steve just
Steve noticed, the minute he gave up. They might have fought about it, Tony sitting there understanding one in 10 words, maybe, and Steve shouting until the director had come to remove him, crying.
Steve told him a story, once.
Steve wishes he would stop.
Tony dozes in his wheelchair with Star Trek reruns in the background until Steve is wiping his mouth and easing him out and coaxing him into the big tub in the master bathroom.
Because Tony cannot abide his first home, he forces himself to think of the Helicarrier as a second one: no ghosts, no shadows, fluorescent lights in perpetuity, paperwork to occupy his hands while he goes away and lives in his head. Systems to inhabit. A mainframe to get lost in, when it all becomes too much. SHIELD has a link to SWORD and Tony wanders through their firewall for 16 hours one day.
Steve thinks maybe he’s reopening it every time he comes here.
Steve slaps him across the face.
Steve, Tony begs.
He almost pulls the flask out of his pocket before he remembers he can’t and he grips it so tight that he feels the metal bending in his pocket.
, Steve, work up some fucking optimism because I am fucking scared.”
Tony straightens up, licks his finger. Rubs the rest of it all over his gums while Rubell presses a sloppy theatrical kiss to the side of his face. He could ask for a tip. He doesn’t think Hammer will come anywhere near this place, but it’s possible. He doesn’t know if he can afford to trust Rubell with that. “No,” he says belatedly. “I don’t need anything.” He flashes his press smile. He can’t feel his mouth but he’s had practice. Rubell bounces out the door and up the stairs, back to terrorize the hopefuls on the street.
Steve stood in this workshop, not too long ago, and called him reckless. Said he was drifting away from humanity. Said he was losing what made him the man Steve was proud to stand beside.
Steve slides out of bed.
“Thank you, sir,” Tony says, and throws his phone on the ground.
Steve's body is smaller, ever so slightly. The masking cream lingers; Tony gets a whiff of it as Steve is propping himself on one elbow. Someone has done a shitty job cutting his hair. He has dark circles under his eyes. Tony wants to ask if he's sorry. Doesn't.
, Steve,” Tony says viciously. He stands over Steve, fits one hand over the base of his cock, runs the other over Steve’s lips. Strokes over his forehead, runs his free hand back and rests it at Steve's nape.
“…made it,” Steve is saying. “–so proud, Shellhead…so far,” Tony understands. Steve smiles. He smiles at Tony and lifts the fork to his mouth. Tony watches the redheaded woman lick the icing off the candle.
“I regret doing what we did to you,” Strange says.
Steve can feel the man’s tears dripping onto his face.
Steve doesn’t know where else he’d go.
The way is easy, and when Steve is fully seated it feels like he’s sliding
He is able to tell Extremis to monitor his heart rate, because he remembers the first time something like this happened, remembers waking up with the lost time and a body count and stopping his heart to shut out the intruder for good. He can’t do that again, he can’t –
Steve climbs into his lap and Tony wonders if he died months ago and this is his hell.
He is expecting to be asked about arrangements; he is expecting to be asked about Arlington, about suits, about whether or not Steve should be buried in his costume. The questions that are meant for a lover. For Sharon. He is expecting to be told the arrangements are no longer up to him, that he has been removed as next-of-kin sometime during their useless war.
They’re the closest they’ve been in a long time.
“Article 51, subsection E,” Tony mumbles.
“I need my meds,” he tells Reed.
Jen is kind enough to lie to him.
and slowly,
“Are you, Tony?” He slams the door to the fridge and it swings back open; he’s dented the frame and the seal. He swears, he puts it back in place. “Because your heart stopped and then it started again, so tell me what that is.”
Tony’s hand covers his before he can slide it off the nightstand.
Steve pulls away. “Tony,” he says helplessly.
Tony says “I’m fine,” and there was a time Steve would have been able to decide to believe with all his heart.
I don't feel you, Tony croaks, and he shakes through it. Saying it aloud precipitates a fearful overturn in his otherwise inert body: shame and guilt and fear and over again.
Steve wants to tell him maybe it’s better if he doesn’t, but that would be cruel. Out of character.
Rhodey won’t tell give him specifics beyond ‘Tony is in the hospital’ and ‘potentially serious’ before he backpedals and tells him it’s probably nothing, he’s always had an arrhythmia, even when they were at MIT, pretty common, just doing some tests.
They can be fine.
“You don’t deserve her,” Steve tells him. “You don’t deserve anything.”
“Sorry,” Tony says. “You know how it is.”
He rips up the letter and slams it on the counter. Someone from the desk calls after him, calls him back, but Steve shoves himself through the doors and trusts that the paperwork will make it back to Mr. Stark.
Tony flashes him a quick, faltering smile. He blinks his eyes. He folds and unfolds his hands. "Take the house, Steve," Tony says, finally. "Please–"
, he thinks, and someone stomps on his good hand.
The clouds are breaking up. Steve can almost see the stars. “You didn’t need me,” he says. “I was bad press, Tony, I didn’t – you know how I felt at the end of it. I couldn’t wear the flag on my chest like that, not in good conscience–”
than that, right, Stark?”
“I didn’t hear you come in,” Tony rasps, Jesus, his throat sounds like it’s gone through a grater –
“Fuck me like you don’t care about damaging me,” Steve chokes, and he feels his cheeks burning. "Push me."
So you say you want a deathbed scene, the knowledge that comes before knowledge, and you want it dirty.
(he has to be gentle), and wraps one of his arms around Tony’s back. “Like what, Tony, what am I like–”
“That was fast.” Steve kicks his feet up onto the divan. “I haven’t even fucked your face yet.”
Steve didn’t say that there was no kid, that the pilot died. That the plane crashed into the forest and the debris field was two miles long, that Steve walked away from it with a pair of dog tags clutched in his hand and third-degree burns over his chest that would heal in a few weeks. That he’d limped back to camp with his hands still stained with blood and acted like it was nothing.
He limps in, barefoot. He carries his IV bag with him, dangles it from one finger. It takes all his strength to open the door.
Maybe you should bite me, Tony suggests, and Steve
He thinks it will make him feel better. He thinks of all the times he has used his body to soothe the ugly things that have always arisen between the two of them. He thinks of the most erotic things Steve has done to him. He thinks about Steve in rut. He thinks about the way Steve feels when he knots.
It's truth enough to sate.
He remembers addressing Congress.
Stark, we’re not friends. We’re not lovers, we’re not–”
Tony’s trains his enormous blue eyes on Steve and says, “I think you should fuck me.”
They do it like this because Tony won’t have Steve on top of him, anymore.
He can feel it, every time Tony punches past his gag reflex, the tickle, the burning sensation when Tony slides down his throat.  Sometimes he stays there, and Steve can feel his distended throat pressing against the collar, it’s so deliriously good, he’s not getting enough oxygen but he wishes he were getting less, he wishes it were Tony’s hands and not the fucking collar –
Tries to feel nothing.
staring, well-dressed, beautiful, outlandish people, men with their fellas on their arms who would probably never be caught out like this in the light of day, tweakers and starlets and people Tony probably runs with. He thinks he sees Cher, but that can’t be right.
Steve aches. Wants to beat back Tony’s demons for him. Watches him sniff and fumble and wipe his nose and lick his lips. Witnesses the disaster he is, and still wants him.
, he wants to say more.
He sleeps in the workshop on a cot that’s a foot too long for his 6’1” frame while the movers take each and every instance of Steve’s face down from the wall. He lies on his side and faces the wall and turns the thermostat down and the lights off and thinks that if he died down here no one would come looking for him.
As soon as the back door slams shut behind him, it bangs open again.
“I don’t think I’m gonna make it,” Tony tells her.
work, Tony says.
“Oh,” Tony says, and he leans up to reach his arms around Steve’s neck, to say it into the skin around his throat. “
In ecstasy, Barry White sings, and Mystery Man executes a perfect spin, pulls Tony into his body, dips him back like you might do on a ballroom floor.
“Oh my god,” someone is saying. “Oh my god.”
Steve thinks the least he can do is swallow, so he works Tony through it, holds him there on his tongue while he twitches and spurts down Steve’s throat.
“Lower your voice, Mr. Stark,” she snaps right back. “As important as he is to you, so are all the other people on that list.”
Tony is shaking. He hasn’t moved except to lean his forehead on Steve’s shoulder. Steve can feel him panting, can see his thighs flexing. He uses his free hand to cradle the back of Tony’s hand.
Steve hears some kind of noise coming from his own throat. His cheeks feel hot. Tony is looking at his chest, smirking. It isn’t kind.
Steve offers it, and he
- - -
Tony bumps up against the back of his throat. “Sorry,” Steve hears. “I’m sorry.” Steve grabs Tony’s hips and takes him until he’s swallowing compulsively to avoid retching all over the bed:
Tony won’t meet his eyes. “I’m fine,” he says, undoes the buckle on Steve’s collar. “Are you?” He drapes a towel over Steve’s shoulders, like he owes him something.
More accurately, he hires people to renovate for him because if he has to go upstairs, where he slept with Rumiko, with Maya, never with Steve –
This guy, he said. This kid. ‘Parachutes in the back, boys.’ Steve laughed like he’s the only one in the room. I’ll never forget it. He wouldn’t leave. He made us jump, Steve says. He took off his gun and he knelt down on the floor and he tied the yoke and he held the pilot’s head and held his guts in. Talked to him. It was kind.
- - -
Steve gasps. Tony puts his hands on Steve’s ass, just to feel the shape of him, and Steve feels his cock jerk, he feels the silk of Tony’s vest against his bare, too-sensitive skin. He moans, lets his eyes fall closed. Lets Tony fondle him, watches the lines of Tony’s throat when Tony presses his crotch into Steve’s. He’s hard, under that nice expensive suit. Steve wonders if he’s going to keep it on. If he’s going to tip him onto his face and bend over Steve’s body and fuck him from behind like that with his vest rubbing into Steve’s back –
Tony takes more Klonopin and drinks the gross DC tap water straight from the sink and looks in the mirror. “I’m fucked,” he says. “It’s fine. You can say it.”
“You have Extremis,” Steve says, and Tony feels his anger surge, like the air is electrifying. Steve’s grip on him tightens. It’s like Steve thinks if he can just hit Tony hard enough maybe he’ll shake the monster out of Tony.
I assumed you would break it, Steve says quietly. If that's what you wanted.
I can live with you hating me, Steve says. He pulls Tony's hips back so he can go deeper, kicks his knees awkwardly apart, tugs at his balls roughly. I can live with that if this fixes you.
“Actually, captivity is how this happened,” Tony says.
“Yeah, I’m serious,” she says. “Because someone wants you out of the picture, do you get that–”
- - -
Tony grabs the IV stand because he's going to be standing for this. You did that, he says. I didn't make you do that, I didn't drive you to it. You did that, he whispers.
Steve thinks that it isn’t that people are doomed to repeat the past, it’s just that they don’t know what else to do.
someone whispers, and Extremis flashes an intruder warning for .00000013 of a second and Tony turns around with the gold spreading over his skin and his bare hands outstretched with his palms upturned.
Tony is talking, explaining about the valve that regurgitates blood and the way the walls of his heart aren’t thick enough and Steve is back in the cold, back on the train, back feeling his hand go from tight in Bucky’s to empty, because that’s how his life happens, he loves people and they leave, his mother left, Bucky left and if it’s one thing this century has given him it’s the clarity to know he doesn’t deserve it.
Tony’s guards lead him into the main cellblock. His skeletons stare at him from hundreds of identical white cells. He hasn’t asked what’s going to happen to him. He feels simultaneous panic rising in him and the blunt edge of all that quetiapine lingering in his system. He would like to be screaming, he would welcome the gold. He would settle for the brutal shock of a half-functional heart plugged in just in time.
Tony stands there shifting his weight. His heart sounds fluttery. Steve aches to tell him. It’s the right thing to do; it’s what Captain America would do.
Okay, Steve says. His breathing is shallow and uneven. He's crying. You need contact, Tony, he says. Just - just for half an hour. You're - you're crashing. I didn't -
What can I do, Steve snaps. What can I do that Tony couldn't.
“I’m waiting for someone,” Steve lies. He blows a cloud of smoke into the air and wishes the nicotine did something for him.
, the alpha says, and Tony starts to cry because it's him, that's Steve, that's Steve's voice. And Steve doesn't smell like anything. Not even like a stranger. Like he's been erased from Tony's page entirely, like he was never there to begin with, like he's no one.
“Are you one of Hammer’s?” Tony says, weary, like Steve is just one in a long line of strangers to let him down. “Am I your
Steve murmurs, strokes Tony’s hair, smoothes a hand down his bare side, his quaking body.
Steve rides the edge of unconsciousness. The man cradles his head, touches his wrinkled skin like it’s precious, coaxes him through the unrelenting agony that's happening in his frontal lobe. "What am I supposed to do," he cries. He rocks them together and Steve is dimly aware of the feeling of sobs racking the body adjacent to his own. “I’m sorry, I’m sorry,” the man is chanting under his breath. “I love you, I love you, I love you.”
“Hey,” Carol snaps, and Shepherd visibly pales. “Don’t fucking test me. He’s schizophrenic and he’s worth ten of you,” she spits.
Steve’s not even looking, he has his eyes shut and his eyelashes cast shadow over his cheeks and his mouth hangs open in an animal pant-moan. He keeps licking his lips. Steve keeps enforcing his own silence and quiet and dark. Keeps parcelling himself up to give to Tony, for Tony's enjoyment at Steve's expense. Keeps writing blank emotional checks.
could see this,” he hisses.
“I didn’t forget,” Tony says.
Steve sticks his thumb all the way into Tony's mouth, presses his tongue down. Adds another finger. Goes deep enough to brush the back of Tony's throat. Laughs a little when he sputters and chokes. Does it again.
“I’m not,
I'm not going, Steve says, but the elevator is already closing.
Tony slips around his body, slips two of his fingers under the collar again, checks his wrists, checks his ankles.
to end up at the gayest place in the city–”
. He can’t stop his hands from roving over Tony’s bare skin, the shudders that would be imperceptible to normal unenhanced humans are music to him, and he maps the roiling of Tony’s muscles and the shuddering rhythm of his breath. Tony’s body opens to him like they were both made for this, like for a few moments all can be right with the world, and Steve bends to kiss his chest and plants his hands up by Tony’s head and moves.
- - -
Steve hesitates.
It sears a little. No one ever made fun of his costume when it was the flag. It used to be different; people tended to gasp and swoon. Once a waitress asked him for his autograph. Once a firefighter winked at him.
,” Tony says again, clings, tighter, abandons his own erection entirely and just ruts shamelessly against Steve’s stomach, Steve knows he must be close, he’s so thick and dark and Steve can
Steve's on hold with someone. He tucks his phone between his ear and his shoulder and sits on the edge of the bed and traces Tony's lips with one of his massive fingers. Slides the tip into Tony's mouth.
Tony is tethered to the very edge of consciousness.
The door bangs open behind them and a group of shirtless men filter out, laughing and touching and smiling. They make their way around to the sidewalk as if Steve’s entire world isn’t falling apart right here, right now. Steve ducks his head, pretends he’s looking past the dumpster and not thinking about diving into it.
“Fine,” he growls at her, and he shuts the projector off.
It's actually shocking, after the Extremis incident on the Helicarrier. He invited a foreign neoplasm into his body. He didn't expect to live through it. It defies explanation.
“I’m working on it,” Carol says.
You're drugged, Tony rasps, when Steve lets him go. You took something. His vision swims as Steve towers over him, shuts off the water. There's come all over his face, in his damp hair.
Jen is standing up.
Tony is slick enough and hard enough that the silicone sleeve goes on easy. Conditions are ideal. Tony picks his head up, looking suitably shocked, just as Steve is fitting the rest of it over his considerable scrotal volume.
He tries to sit up and screams. His ribs, his wrist. One of his eyes is swollen completely shut. He shivers. He feels like he’s going to shake out of his skin. He feels like he used to feel before a cardiac event. He bites into his own arm and lets out an animal scream that echoes off the walls. He’s cold. He can’t feel his legs.
Steve waits for the rest, but it doesn’t come. It’s fine, he’s not here for an apology. The person he wants it from clearly doesn’t think he deserves it.
“How are you doing, Tony,” she says, and Tony casts his gaze somewhere far beyond her.
“Blade?” Tony says, momentarily coming out of his torpor, and holds up one of the clippings. “Scraping the bottom of the barrel, aren’t we?”
Steve goes at it until Tony is raw.
Tony plays Poco at a volume that is almost certainly damaging to drown him out and works on his blueprints. His mind works slowly and some days not at all. He snaps pencils and redoes his math over and over again and doesn't return any of his phone calls. It is the only way he knows to carry on. This is his job: build himself a shell, again and again and again, tighter to his skin with every iteration to disguise what he’s cut out and left behind.
We need this, Steve says. He buries his face in Tony's shoulder, nibbles around his collarbone, bites hard enough to draw blood. Humps Tony's hip until he finally figures out he can rip Tony's towel off.
“Give them back,” Tony says. He’s so fucking tired.
Carol keeps touching him once they sit down – a hand on his elbow, a touch on his knee. He is drifting, he is shaking. There's nowhere to escape; one smartphone is just like another. He has to pretend to be analog like everyone else here. He speaks right after the President, he has to pay attention. Tony has kept himself awake for 36 hours to write the eulogy, has memorized it, word for word. He fixes his tie, tries to ignore the way the wind whips around his legs and snakes up his arms. His suit is ill fitting. He is supposed to be better than this.
And dinner still goes poorly.
I'm gonna fix it, he soothes, his voice jagged and unsteady. I'm gonna. Tony, can I?
That should have been the writing on the wall, in hindsight.
“I have an idea,” Tony says, tentative like he never used to be, it’s horrific. “I think – Reed had it, actually.”
“Locked,” the man says. They’re outside a door with a frosted glass window and a handwritten sign taped in the corner.
“ – Danvers, is he ok – ”
Steve, he says. Talk to me.
“Stay,” Tony says.
But the feeling, the echo of an echo that's almost as solid in him as the arc once was - it stills. It quiets.
The man wraps one arm around the broad part of Steve’s back like they’re embracing, like they could be lovers, real lovers, and then his hand is around Steve’s cock like he can see in the dark.
“More of that,” Tony breathes. The guy can’t possibly have heard him, but his hands settle against the curve of Tony’s ass. Practically a first date at 54.
A click, two, and Tony’s undone the spreader bar. Steve’s lead hangs loose down his back, but he can kick his legs out, he can curl over onto himself. Tony sits back and something is shoved between Steve’s legs, hot, solid –
“Tell me what to do,” Steve implores, “Tell me what to do to help you.”
Steve is punching the wall again. Tony startles in his seat every time his hand makes contact.
Tony plants his hands on Steve’s bare chest and sets his face in determination and starts to move.
He is intoxicated and he knows it and he doesn’t care.
“I don’t want to have the surgery,” he whispers. “I don’t, don’t be mad at me, just–”
Last year, this was dinner and hours of sex. Steve broke a lamp and answered the door naked for room service. “Groom does what he wants, Tony,” he’d said.
He lies next to Tony. He doesn’t know how to feel about Tony, here, in his bed. It’s too much; it’s an embarrassment of riches. It’s wasted on him. He settles for curling around his body, pressing slow kisses to his lithe neck, skimming his hand up Tony’s chest.
Pain has never let him down, so Tony squeezes his broken hand as hard as he possibly can.
Steve's feet are thrown over the lip of the bath, his body too monumental for something as pedestrian as a bathtub. The water is brighter red than Tony expects. Steve's thighs are just under the surface.
No one is bleeding out on the pavement. It’s just people, gorgeous people in bizarre outfits waiting around in the chill of the fall air, flocking to the neon signage like moths. He can just pick up music from deep inside the building.
“I’d never go to 54 without you, babe, you’re so gorgeous, you’re better than any of those phonies, look at me, mm,
. He was larger than life.”
Steve does cry, at that. Of course, he says, blank-faced and pathetic. Whatever you want.
Two precise little nicks on each leg, neater than they should be. One last push of the serum. The way Steve goes the extra mile. The way he always knows exactly how much force to exert.
No, Steve says to the someone on the other end of the phone. I have it under control.
“Yes, I like it,” Steve bites out, “would you knock it off and tell me what’s in your head?”
Jen herds him into the men’s bathroom and stands at his side like a sentry and puts one hand on his back and tells him to breathe and Tony does what people tell him to do, now.
Steve stills, waits.
It’s packed up tight, but he has a crowbar and anxiety trying to crawl out of his stomach, so he tears the crates up and lines up the canvases, the framed letters, takes each piece reverently out of its container and smooths his hands over it, presses his face into the folds, imagines he can still smell cosmoline and gunpowder on Steve’s 90-year-old clothing –
He thinks it’s convincing. It’s not technically a lie. Reed starts to cry.
“Tony,” Steve says again, and he sounds hysterical. Tony lets his eyes slip shut.
“I’m asking nicely,” Steve murmurs.
is,” he says, and he’s yelling now.
Swift anger rises in Tony. He crosses the room in a single stride, snatches the blindfold off the bed, winds it around Steve’s head. He puts the little ball in Steve’s hand, presses his fingers around it. Undoes the gag, just for a moment, coaxes it from Steve’s jaw, puts a hand over Steve’s mouth. “Yes or no,” Tony says.
I thought if I could fix it, Steve says haltingly, then I could live with myself.
“I got in accidentally,” Steve admits.
, Steve wants to say, he wants Tony to completely fucking ignore him, he wants to feel like the hole Tony is trying to use him as, he wants to come out of this hollowed out, empty, a vessel.
,” Tony says. “My money was on Batroc. And it’s not, it’s
Steve was supposed to win, not throw himself on top of Tony like a fucking shield.
Tony’s vision goes white.
It’s not a question.
“No,” the man says, and he sounds different. Distant. Bitter. “No, you’re not dying.” His laugh sounds hollow and wet. “If I’d known you despised me this much, I’d have left you alone. I wouldn't have pushed,” the man says hoarsely. “You know, you called me a coward once for doing this.”
Now you know, says Tony. What it feels like to be lied to.
I don't know! Nat yells. You can
Steve is laughing at him. “Look at you, terrorizing innocent civilians. You honestly believed people would just look at you and see their savior?” He steps right into Tony’s space, and a shiver of pure icy fear runs through Tony. Steve stands like he’s about to throw a punch. “Look at yourself.”
So Tony tries. It’s their first anniversary, he hasn’t forgotten. He uses every ounce of his strength and curls his left hand loosely around Steve’s.
Tony holds his hands up and slides himself onto a barstool. He fingers through Steve’s mail, sets his folder down, runs his fingers over the keys to Steve’s bike. He threads his fingers through his hair. “Ok,” he says in that voice that Steve has come to recognize as backpedaling from a transgression. “I came to apologize.”
This is what the future feels like, Steve thinks, and he presses the man up against the wall, crowds into him. He’s gonna bust a seam if he doesn’t get what he’s looking for soon. They’re of equal height, almost, and he can feel the man’s collar rubbing against his bare chest. Silk. He would know, it’s all Tony wore. This one is clearly acquainted with glamour; Steve can still taste his cologne on his tongue. Steve would paint him if this were a different kind of courtship, would have him strewn out on red silk to set off the blues in his pale skin. He nips at the man’s ear and imagines the intimacy of arranging his limbs.
Sometimes he tells himself he’s not going back. That he’ll climb on his bike and head west and do something different. It’s a lie; he always goes back.
“Not leaving,” Steve tells him. “Ok?”
- - -
Someone pulls the letters out of his hands.
“Surely I rate higher than just
“You look like someone I know,” the man is saying, and he probably doesn’t think Steve can hear. “He got away.” It strikes Steve as the wrong thing to say when he’s kneeling in glitter and filth and Steve’s cock is jutting out of his suit like he made this costume expressly to take it off and the whole thing feels sordid and miserable but somehow he can’t manage to stop touching the guy’s hair glinting in the light from the disco ball. It reminds him of Tony. Tony’s hair always started to curl when it let it get long.
me and you didn’t because of your goddamn ego – ”
He lets the gag slide out of his mouth, lets it dangle around his neck. “Fuck me,” he says. “I know you want to,” he says, because goading is coded into both of them, because there’s too much pushed down between the two of them to be kind about it. They’re done with seduction.
He curls into a ball. He thinks about Steve and the mat and Steve’s smile as Steve extended his hand and laughed and told him
“No,” Tony says.
Steve’s got a Medal of Honor citation but he still doesn’t have the kind of courage his neighbors have.
“I don’t know if I’m gonna remember this tomorrow,” Tony mumbles, and he moves closer to Steve like he’s magnetized.
Jen slides her chair over and slaps her hand on the table. “Do not,” she tells him. “Do not take your bullshit out on me, Tony. I get that you are in an
“It wouldn’t be – fair to you,” Steve croaks, and Tony’s face shifts into something hard and awful.
Tony considers that in the space of a second before he's floating away again.
like this all day,
“Tony, don’t,” Steve says.
Tony hates it. He puts up a good show for about a week and then he won’t take his shirt off anymore. He designs a special pouch that sits around his waist and hides the fact that his life is resting in a little box.
“Shit,” Steve pants, and pulls out with a filthy sucking sound. “Do you–”
The knot feels like it's going to split him. Another small, unquantifiable grief. A brutality Tony thought he would always be spared from. Something trickles down between them, catches in his pubes, trapped between the heat of their bodies. Steve pulses over and over, thrusts deep in aborted little strokes. Positions his mouth the way it was the very first time, just grazes Tony's scar with his teeth.
Tony should hate him and all he wants to do is memorize his face.
Anything? Steve asks, carefully neutral.
Someone is turning a key in his apartment door and he briefly wonders if he should be worried.  His shield is in the closet. He wouldn’t be able to defend himself; he doesn’t think he could move. He thinks he’s waiting for something to happen.
Tony loses all track of time. Rhodey, he asks, but Rhodey is gone.
“Just fuck my throat, Tony,” Steve rasps.
Steve imagines fucking Tony until Tony cries. He lets himself catch Tony’s eyes, and that’s a mistake, because Tony is wide-eyed and reverent and as vulnerable as Steve’s ever seen him. Steve can’t stand the tenderness of it. It’s possible Steve is a monster.
Steve sets the coffee on the bathroom counter, sets the bagel on top of that, tucks the blanket around Tony. Tony lets him.
He is
and they would lie there and kiss and Steve would understand because Steve always understands.
“Sit up, this isn’t gonna work,” he pants. He looks over his shoulder – his legs might hang off the end of the couch, but he could lie down, and it’s wide enough for Tony to fit a knee on either side of him -
No, Tony says, as boldly as he dares. He pulls away. He moves his legs after what feels like an eternity, frozen beneath Steve's body, subsumed by the ultimate violence of his rut. He shifts his weight and can't help the moan that falls from his mouth. His gland feels raw as an open wound.
If you’re really unlucky, you get new ones. Worse ones.
He pulls out the capsule, tosses it to Reed.
Steve doesn’t want that. He’s greedy. He crowds Tony against the island, hops him up on the counter, and Tony goes, wrapping his legs around Steve’s waist. It’s novel, having Tony tower over him. Tony must decide it’s ok, because he tangles his fingers in Steve’s hair, commits to
Steve cradles the back of Tony’s head and drags him into a filthy kiss that would feel entirely inappropriate to the situation if it weren’t for Tony’s enthusiasm: Tony’s wandering hands and Tony’s teeth dragging at Steve’s bottom lip and they way Tony
Tony swallows and swallows and swallows because Steve does not get another single ounce of his pain for self-flagellation.
“Don’t do that,” Steve snaps. “You stepped down? Who’s leading the Avengers?”
Tony props his knees up. Climbs astride the saddle Steve's hips make. Eases himself onto Steve, lets gravity pull their bodies together, closes his eyes and focuses on the sound of Steve's noises, the sound he makes whenever Tony clenches around him, the sound he makes when Tony digs his fingertips into Steve's biceps and leans over him close enough to feel his chest heaving against Tony's own.
Steve conducts the entire conversation in his angriest whisper huddled in the hallway with her projector clutched in his hand. He’s glad she’s her own, now, but it’s still eerie to hear Jan’s speech patterns overlaid with something Other and metal. She keeps harping on Tony’s heart rate. Steve is more concerned with the lacerations, with Tony’s hydration level. Jocasta tells him with the sort of infuriating calm that only an AI could manage: Tony’s recovering, he needs to sleep, he’s one hour and four minutes into a REM cycle and if Steve doesn’t burn off some of his energy while he has the chance, she’s going to lock him out of the apartment.
“Any suicidal thoughts,” she asks. "Any hallucinations?"
, says the note.
Steve, I swear to god -
,” he breathes.
Tony is dressed well, but not well enough to tantalize. He looks like he’s going to a business meeting. He’s wearing a suit, but it’s from two seasons ago. He sits up straight and keeps his eyes on his burger and taps his foot like he does when he wants to be somewhere else. Steve is no longer his paramour, Steve is some withering old man that Tony keeps around because Tony is transparently sentimental.
Steve presses a kiss to Tony’s forehead. Creeps off the couch. He gathers their clothes, digs his dress shirt stained with Sue’s blood out of the hamper and pads through the suite, out the double doors, down the hallway and into the laundry room. Sits at the kitchen table and eats days-old cold lo mein out of the carton. Waits.
“Wow,” Steve says, and angry isn’t a hard thing to conjure up. “Patronizing,” he repeats.
“Why should I,” Tony whispers, and his hands are running down Steve’s chest now, smoothing over his skin. Tony is feeling the shape of his muscles from his skin like he secretly wants to be unwrapping them, like he wants to draw Steve into his world of machines and wires and metal and see what makes him go. “Why do you need it from me,” he hisses, and something that’s shame and anger twisted together stirs in Steve.
Tony gently lays Steve’s palm over Tony’s throat so Steve can
Steve turns around, because his instincts have a way of evaporating around Tony.
Mystery Man brings him back up, and he’s rough now. Tony leans in to kiss him but he noses away, comes back with a nip of his own:
Steve snorts. “Bullshit,” he says.
but it’s a conversation he doesn’t want to have, a road he doesn’t want to tread, a thrill that exists only in his fantasies, now. They’ve lost things. They’re splintered.
“I don't wanna hear you speak,” Tony says cruelly.
. It does the trick – Tony sighs and some of the tension goes out of him. He strokes a thumb over Steve’s cheek. He finds his rhythm again, and Steve vaguely realizes it’s happening, it’s going to be over. It’s going to be a memory.
Sometimes, in these nightmares, he is killing Tony. On the street. In his workshop. Under a red sky as a burning aircraft carrier falls out of the sky to bury their quarrel once and for all.
Mystery Man’s lips are moving. His words mostly slide past Tony, lost to the music, but it’s nice. Tony puts his hands on the man’s chest and feels his voice thrumming deep in his chest.
they say. He hasn’t spoken with any of the Avengers: packed up and left like he was never there in the first place. He follows their exploits in the papers. He is removing himself from what he used to be. He wants to celebrate, not be celebrated, so he renders them in his own hand, bright and smiling for the comic books. His colorist gets the color of Tony’s eyes wrong, sometimes.
“I think this is ok,” Tony slurs. “I think this is good for me.”
“I’m not in the market for real estate,” he says. “And we’re not family.”
He comes out of sleep slowly, and runs his hand across his eyes to find that his face is wet with tears. He lays in bed and tries to shake himself from the half-awareness.
You didn’t call
Tony’s eyes go glazed-over and settle somewhere by the picture window. He leans against Steve, presses his thigh against Steve’s like he wants to do more but he’s loath to let himself have it. “It’s like nothing I did matters,” he says. “They’re already crucifying me for this, I’m sure it’s exactly the opening Osborn was waiting for, it’s like everything I went through the first time doesn’t even matter, like all the work I did and all the people I hurt–”
Steve always signed them
Steve, in what is possibly the worst decision he’s made since leaving the team, yanks his own mask off.
The curves of his muscles have been whittled away to almost nothing, and his body lays on the table, naked except for the sheet someone has thrown over his groin, his ribs poking up through his skin, his eyes hollow and dark.
“You seemed into it when your cock was down my throat,” Tony says, and he leans on the dumpster like it’s a set dressing put there expressly for Tony’s use. Tony smiles a sad wan smile. “Not your type after all?”
me and I keep thinking – if that’s how it understood love, and it learned it from me–”
Steve wants to ask why Tony couldn’t have written that part out when he made all those fucking upgrades – the part of him that’s convinced that no one could ever want him as he is.
They ask Tony if he wants to make a closing statement, and Tony slips up, sees Steve sitting in the front row of the Assembly next to the Wakandan ambassador, and he presses his lips together and blinks his eyes and feels like his chest is collapsing and shakes his head.
“Do you know how many times I’ve watched your heart stop,” Steve says. “I thought we were past that.”
“Steve,” Tony gurgles, and Steve hits him again.
Steve resents being Tony’s mistress. He knows there’s a name for what they’re doing.
Tony holds him up, cradles the back of his neck, rubs his thumb insistently against the underside of Steve’s cock. Looks at him all the way through. Steve feels lightheaded and erased, can’t imagine what his cock looks like, how obscene it must look. His pulse throbs in his neck, in his forehead. He feels his own cock jerk in Tony’s hand bump against his own stomach.
Steve’s face is weathered and creased. He has an old man’s nose, his golden hair is grey, but his eyes are the same. Tony tries to bite back his tears because he doesn’t care, he still wants to see. He doesn’t ever want to stop seeing.
He calls the armor, but there’s something in his hands already – a gun, a wooden thing, a Mauser. He kicks out, instinctively, like Steve taught him, but someone throws their full weight on him and there’s metal cutting into his cheek as his assailant slams him into the ground again, knocks off his helmet –
You don't want, Steve says haltingly.
“Tony,” Steve says again. “What you have on your wrist isn’t gonna change this.”
Tony brings his own blow and is having a perfectly unremarkable time on the nice leather chesterfield until Steve Rubell finishes schmoozing Mick across the table and swoops over to him.
“Where have you been,” he says.
“Tony–” Steve starts.
He lets himself have it. He acquaints himself with the concrete. He tries to still his racing heart. The thing on his ankle catches the light from the tiny slit in his door and shines.
Tony just watches him from where he’s curled on his side.
Steve takes his hand away like he's been burned.
you, Tony, Steve tells him.
Steve smiles. He manages actual tears. “Thank you,” he says, without argument or rancor.
“I have work,” Steve says evenly, and if it’s a half-truth, Tony’s been telling him half-truths from the start, hasn’t he. He has people to extort. He can’t even help himself from looking at his watch; he’s due back at the airport in 2 hours. “We said that we would make the distance thing work, Tony–”
He worries it’s rude, he knows he’s setting some kind of precedent with how hard he is and how randy he’s being, knows he should be better at seduction. He should be more confident, maybe. He dares to skim his hand lower, sucks at Tony’s neck, throws one leg over Tony’s hip. Tries his best not to moan too transparently when Tony rolls over so they’re face to face and grinds them together. He never worried about this with Sharon. Sharon was mouthy, Tony just shifts to meet him the same way Tony anticipates his moves on the battlefield.
It’s completely unsatisfying, he doesn’t even stop being hard, it just trickles down his shaft in a pathetic little rivulet like he’s tipped over the edge for a split-second and then he’s right back at almost-satisfied, almost-there. He wants to cry in frustration – he might be, Tony is running a thumb over his face, Tony is still in his mouth, Tony is feeling his lips where they’re stretched around his cock.
A bus boy wearing nothing but tight red gym shorts walks in front of them holding a plastic bin full of wine glasses. The line of men sitting at the bar swivel their heads around.
Steve lets himself fall.
that rest on his shoulders.
Steve feels so swollen, so sore, that he thinks he’s going to die if Tony doesn’t give him some place to put his cock.
Tony dreams of the first time he went out wearing the armor on American soil.
If he tries, Steve can still smell the antiseptic of the room where he woke up after the ice, can smell the heady wash of Tony Stark’s cologne. The dumb way his mouth smirked up into a grin, the eyes. The eyes. Tony sharpened the world for him and washed the past into a dull blur, a faraway dream.
Steve dumps him on the shower floor. Stands up. His leg muscles flex and shine. He drags Tony up by one arm. The heart monitor is beeping somewhere behind him.
It's hard to be near Steve, physically. Tony has no intention of telling him how hard it is. There should be a pull, and he tries to will it into existence, draws upon their filthiest nights together, their most violent disagreements, anything to manufacture a feeling, anything to trick his brain into thinking Steve is still his. He doesn't have enough strength to reciprocate, or to climb atop Steve's hale body, so he closes his eyes and lets the dark swaddle him so he doesn't ever have to see Steve, on top of him, again.
, he would always say later, later in bed, later with Tony –
“That’s great,” Steve says, and Tony wipes his mouth and puts his fork down.
He laughs and puts one hand over his chest. He touches his face and maybe he’s smearing his eyeliner and he closes his eyes and thinks about how it felt to wear a mask and how it felt to have a home and how it is to watch it all sliding out of his reach. He feels the rev, feels the onslaught of neutral regret and what-if’s building.
“I think you like it when I look like you own me.”
“Of course you are,” Steve says under his breath.
Tony punches him. Steve doesn't even lean out, just lets it happen, just lies there with his head on the same pillow and blood running out his nose.
“I know,” Tony soothes, and slides a hand around Steve’s cock, teasing, loose, not enough for pleasure but just enough for torment. “You wish you could stop,” he whispers, “but here you are, Steve. I wish you could see this. I wish
Looks at him with glassy eyes.
Steve smiles. “I do know my way around StarkCAD.”
“Tony,” Jen is saying under her breath. “I thought you said Maya was off the radar.”
Steve pulls his mask down while his shield glints at him from the back of his closet.
Steve sits up, chest to chest with Tony, and Tony gasps and throws an arm out to clutch at the back of the sofa.
He’s shaking. He looks at his hands. Looks at his chest, searches himself for scars, for blood.
He’s been dreaming. He can still see the shape of it, almost. He thinks someone was with him. He thinks someone was making love to him. He wants to keep it, but he pats around for his sketchbook a moment too long and all he can remember are bright blue eyes.
“What the hell,” Steve says. “What the hell, Tony.”
“I care about you,” Tony says to his plate. “I want you in my life, we’ve – we’ve moved past worse, Steve. We’ve moved past death. We could try,” he says, with that stupid hysterical optimism. “We did it before, I need you, Steve, I can’t just walk away–”
It’s good enough for Steve. For now, it’s all tabled. Crisis averted, maybe.
“Maybe we shouldn’t–”
“I need you on the team,” Steve snaps. “I like you,” he says, quieter.
Tony smiles a sad smile that doesn’t reach his eyes. “I’m here, aren’t I? And so are you.”
Steve is silent. Success, then.
He understands, now. He can’t treat him like a child; it’s too much of a tip-off. He never would have done that before, he can’t do it now. Explosive anger has never solved anything for him, either.
What if it doesn't work, Tony says. What if it doesn't. I can't handle it if it doesn't, Steve, I can't do that -
It feels like it’s never going to end. Steve feels like he’s going to die. His head is a nothing but agony. He’s vaguely aware of someone wedging something under his head, of the sensation of swallowing his own blood, of the blood rushing in his ears.
“I’m sorry,” Steve says. “Stay a while. I’ll make you coffee.”
Presses his face to Tony’s neck and smells the ghost of something that Steve imagines belongs to Rumiko - perfume, lipstick.
Someone slams him into the mud.
Steve is starving; what can he do? He leans into Tony’s touch and does it again.
The blue armor. Steve’s fucking blue armor. He leans over his workbench and puts a hand over his chest and crumples up the plans and rips them and throws them in the bin.
Steve sags on his knees and lets the tears slide out of his eyes. He doesn’t care, it’s just endorphins. It’s just the sex. It doesn’t mean anything. Tony pretends not to see, and so they orbit each other, together, utterly alone.
, the eternal refrain. Tony wishes now he’d been better, that he’d said something. No more. The war is over.
, he wants to say, he feels like he’s humping a pillow, Tony’s thigh is sticky and hot and Tony is whispering in his ear, telling him things like
- - -
But there is waking life to contend with. Tony has moved on, and so must he.
He's dizzy almost immediately. He chokes, because he's not ready, he's not fit for this, and Steve doesn't even let up for a moment, not for recovery, not for Tony's comfort. Tony's head knocks against the tile and it hurts but everything hurts, he just has to trust that Steve will know if he has a concussion, Steve is in control even at his worst - but he's not, he knows that now, sometimes he's not in control, sometimes he's out for blood, sometimes he is unrefined savagery and he's done it to Tony once so what's to say he won't do it again and -
In his dreams, he feels blows to the armor as direct hits to his limbic system. The armor wasn’t that advanced when it was happening, but he has adapted so his subconscious doesn’t know the difference. He has just enough presence of mind to be grateful for that, that past-him didn’t fix it. He wants it to hurt.
“They’ll bring them to you once you’re situated,” Reed says.
Steve grabs the base of his balls, pulls down. Tries anything. It’s been five seconds.
Tony doesn’t look at him but the flush keeps coming. “Like there’s nothing there,” he says.
Tony, Steve says, and he's almost crying. He pulls away.
It's fine, Tony says.
Something in him comes permanently untethered.
He touches Tony like they used to touch, strokes over his chest, over the divots the nanotech has left. Tony is too weak to even reciprocate, so he lies there and feels his own thready heartbeat and relearns exactly how emaciated he is as Steve traces his ribs.
-Richard Siken,
“Come here,” Steve tells him, overcome with affection.
He cries for a while, until his breathing subsides into something steady, deeper and deeper. He’s almost on the edge of sleep when he startles awake again, feels around desperately until he finds Steve’s hand and grips it with all his strength.
Four B-17s fly overhead in formation.
It hits him, really hits him, as the wave of shea butter and vanilla hits him. The bond isn't salvageable.
I do, Tony says, and the truth of it feels like an ambush. But I've never known - I've never seen this work, Steve, I-
Of all the things Steve could be thinking,
No shit, Tony says.
Maria’s testimony is fair. She can’t stay; she comes in full uniform and shoots him a piteous smile as she walks out the door. Dugan spends his time deflecting and insisting that there’s no one better to manage the Initiative and Tony feels an intense surge of gratitude. Dugan owes him nothing. Both of their testimonies are professional courtesy. Neutral. Dispassionate.
He shouldn’t, Tony shouldn’t, he’s a
Steve hears through the grapevine that Tony is downsizing.
All of Tony's venom comes out at once.
I don't want to hurt you, Steve says after a long time.
“Lie on top of me,” Steve says, “come here,” but he’s already halfway to gathering Tony in his arms, dragging their bodies together, slotting Tony’s sticky softening cock into the space between Steve’s hip and thigh. Sometimes Tony thinks Steve likes this better than the sex, the part where he gets to touch Tony for as long as Tony can tolerate before he starts to remember, before he starts to crawl out of his own skin. The A/C is picking up Tony’s sweat, making him shiver, and Steve rubs one of his hands down Tony’s back, traces the scar over his left shoulder blade, kisses the one that creeps down his chest from his neck. He rubs down Tony’s arms, staving off the goosebumps. He touches Tony’s back, Tony’s spine, catches Tony’s hands and brings one to his mouth for a wet, filthy kiss to his knuckles.
Tony’s face flickers into hurt for an instant before he spackles a tired smile over it. Just like that, it’s gone.
“I didn’t mean anything, I was just, I’m sorry,” Tony says, but the smile is already gone and he looks like he’s sliding back into the ether –
,” he moans. “Please,” he begs in a hoarse whisper. “That was dirty,” he says, breathless. “That wasn’t fair,
so rarely. His scar looks pinker than usual, today, he’s got bruises all up the side of his ribs where he must have been throwing himself around in the suit. He’s lost weight, he’s not coloring his hair. He’s not coloring his beard. His pubes are limned in silver, too. The joke is always the same, thrown carelessly at Steve – nonagenarian, senior citizen, grandpa – but Tony has lived three decades longer than Steve. He has a way of making Steve wonder if he’s drawn to titans because his whole life has been constructed for him.
Steve is the one to feed him, and Tony would have wished to shrivel and die, once, but now he drools instead of opening his mouth.
In this should-have, he apologizes. He doesn’t storm into Tony’s workshop and beat his face until one of his teeth rolls out onto the floor. There is no Time Gem.
He does it. He rests in that heady place of shame and arousal and fear and kneels with his hands still pinned behind him and hump’s Tony’s broad thigh. It’s awful. Tony has plucked the remote off the ground at some point and sets the plug to a useless random setting that doesn’t do anything more than remind Steve that he’s unsatisfied and will remain so until Tony decides otherwise.
“I’m just standing in your shadow!” Tony spits. “We both know that.”
When Tony's vision clears enough to look, Steve is sitting on the floor next to him.
“Please,” he says, and there’s a baton cracking into his ribs.
“You made me forget six people and also genocide the first time. How hard is it to erase one person–”
and he kisses the space between Tony’s shoulder blades and then the side of Tony’s neck and the spot just behind his ear and Tony moans into the leather and walks his knees further apart, reaches around behind him to tease one of his own fingers into himself –
Waits for a miracle.
“They’re not making more land,” Steve parrots Howard, working his hands around Tony’s shoulders. He’s never tense anymore, just as limp as he’s becoming spineless. “How about Indian for dinner,” Steve says.
he wants to say.
Tony kept them, every one. Even when Steve learned about email, he still sent them to Tony’s office, even before he knew he was Iron Man. His handwriting scrawls out across almost a hundred pages. Tony thinks this is the kind of damning primary source that historians publish.
Tony looks back, and it’s just Steve’s withering body and deafening stillness and Tony’s ugly fucking grief.
“Yeah,” Tony mutters, his hand on the office door, his shirt slung over his arm. “I know.”
Tony lets out a sigh, wobbles to the ground, rests with his knees bracketing Steve’s. Taps lightly on the head of Steve’s cock because he’s sadistic. Puts his arms around Steve’s neck. Kisses Steve’s shoulder. Kisses his cheek.
he thinks.
He’s lit candles. His voice is so low, a soft rumble in Tony’s ear, and the words he knows linger with the steam:
Sometimes Steve regrets being an Avenger because it means he is obligated to exercise mercy toward those who do Tony harm.
Steve puts on a face and smiles.
“You can take it off,” Tony mumbles. “I wouldn’t stop you.”
“Like what, Tony,” Steve presses.
“No,” Steve says to his feet.
“We’ve been over this, Secretary,” Tony is saying, and Steve never knows how to read his tone anymore. He’s all irritation and smokescreens. He pulls at his tie. He perches on the edge of the coffee table and doesn’t look at Steve and slides his fingers through Steve’s hair just until they catch, just until he has enough to pull.
“I didn’t,” Tony says, and he tries to sound hateful but his voice falls dull and flat in the cavernous empty space of the living area. “I didn’t then and I don’t now.” He closes his eyes, wills himself somewhere better. He thinks about his Infinity Gem. If anyone would bring it to him. If he would use it. He dreams about a world where he manages to hate Steve as much as Steve hates him. He dreams about a world where he never existed.
“Did I earn it?” he asks.
Steve blinks. “You know? About Nomad?”
Tony drags himself back to the surface, to earth. He compensates by scratching down Steve's chest.
Tony decides that he's going to comply. He will let Steve knot his mouth. He will let Steve bite at his gland until he's sobbing. He will let Steve drive his temperature up until he burns alive, he will let Steve take. He will live.
. “Don’t worry,” he says through a mouth full of blood. “I’m sure the justice system will pull through for you.”
He folds his ancient body into bed at night and sometimes he wakes up and smiles and murmurs good morning to someone who is not sleeping next to him, and then he remembers.
Tony calls it rehearsal and locks himself in his office and lets his eyes go white and tells himself that one day he will be past this. Regret is a problem, just like grief. Just like shame. Every problem has a solution.
“Not through the board meeting.”
Maybe you broke it, Tony tells him, and he hopes Steve can feel even a fraction of rejection Tony has been carrying around. Maybe you splintered it when you put your shield in my fucking chest.
“No, no, I know,” Steve says, and tries to pitch his voice higher. “I thought I could, and I want – wanted to, but I can’t.” He runs a hand through his hair. “We shouldn’t have,” he amends.
He wishes he could blame it on his better judgment. He turns on his heel and pretends he’s brave and walks away.
Tony holds out his wrists to be cuffed.
Tony comes up behind the man, takes the liberty, slides his hand onto the small of his well-muscled back, leans in to whisper in his ear.
The man finds his hand there where Steve is clutching at himself, places it on the back of his head, then settles his own hands firmly on Steve’s thighs. Waits.
He wakes up with the gold on his skin, his body perfectly calibrated for restful sleep, and punches a hole in the wall. He looks at his hands and is both disturbed and mesmerized by his new strength.
Steve Rogers corners him in Clint Barton's guest room on a bed too small for the both of them, kicks at his feet hanging over the edge of the bed.
It is an optimal use of his time as a breathing supercomputer, he thinks.
Steve shifts on his feet and looks anywhere but at Tony’s face. “How long,” he says.
You didn’t know him, Steve barreled on, because everyone knew about the Invaders, knew that it couldn’t be Bucky because Steve wouldn’t talk about Bucky. Steve talked about the blood on the floor, about the lurch of the plane as someone tried to right them, as someone else climbed into the seat with the gun to shoot the two German planes down.
“Can I get dressed now,” Tony says, when he can speak again.
don’t, don’t do that to me, come back–”
Tony lets his filters come up, lets himself slide sideways. The feeling of the paper under his hands goes away, the weight of the crowd’s silence fades into white noise. He blinks and blinks and blinks at the microphone. He is very distantly aware that someone is taking photos of him.
“Fuck,” he breathes. “Fuck.”
“I do mean it,” Steve says, “I always mean it. And I’ll tell you every day until you believe it, Shellhead.”
She tells him this is a formality. That he is an example and it will suck and he will hold his wrist out to be slapped and then he can run away to Seattle. She straightens his tie and puts an arm around his waist when Tony trips up the steps to the Capitol building thinking about the footage of Steve dying. The cameras swarm them; it’s all he can do to focus on his feet. People are screaming. There are protesters.
The man sucks in a shuddering breath somewhere above him. Steve can feel his body shaking from where he lies.
. And then he's gone.
“That’s a version,” Tony says, just as the kettle starts to whistle.
It was over, Steve says. It's over.
He lets himself drift. Builds a better ending for them both, away from the blood and the smoke and their mangled bodies. Imagines Steve is falling asleep on top of him. That he is held in Steve’s arms, that Steve is murmuring in his ear. That is he is loved. That they have not wasted a lifetime together. That the sky is clear and crisp and blue.
Because Tony is a problem solver, he snatches the card and Rubell’s secondhand shit and turns the powder out and lines up another bump, and one more for good measure. He’s going to dance. He’s going to feel like a million bucks if it kills him. He’s going to find someone that looks like Steve and that will be enough, for a while. He’s not here to be sober.
Maria slaps him on the side of the helmet.
“Maybe you should have,” Tony says at him. “Maybe you should do that, maybe you should put your fucking money where your
The sun is just breaking over the lake. It's just dark enough that he can see soft light seeping out from under the bathroom door.
Tony is hunched over the coffee table where Howard’s crystal liquor decanters are still there, unmoved, untouched, covered in a thick layer of dust. Steve bites back the remark he wants to make, because de-escalation is the goal, always, now, with Tony.
Tony looks at the parachutes hanging on the wall, if he waits it will stop, if the plane were to crash right now, if he could edit his code, it would stop –
Steve moves haltingly, stiff and unmoored. He undresses for the fifth time today. He gets himself out, doesn't meet Tony's eyes. He pulls at his own flesh and lets his gaze drift like he'd rather look anywhere but at Tony himself. He pants.
“I love you so much it scares me,” Tony says desperately, like the words are tripping over themselves as they leave his mouth. “And I’m scared that you’re going to wake up one day, probably soon, and realize that you shouldn’t be loving me back.”
Tony looks at Steve like he despises him.
Leonard says other things. He has been watching security logs. He has been talking to Maria. Even now Tony is erasing footage from the past few hours, equally damning.
He creeps back into the bedroom to get shorts and socks. He leans back on the bed and lets himself look at Tony laid out in the sunlight. He’s still sleeping – it’s been 16 hours, but he deserves it. Needs it. Tony moans in his sleep occasionally, tries to roll over on his side and rolls right back. Steve thinks some of his ribs are broken. The blinds are still down but the curtains have been pulled back and Tony glows in the sunlight that falls on his bare skin – sunburnt, abraded, savaged.
It’s so gentle, and then Tony is more insistent, takes the inch Steve has offered and makes it into his own mile, puts his hands on Steve’s cheeks and strokes over the stubble like he loves it, and Steve is desperately glad one of them is sober. Steve’s hands find Tony’s waist, he’s so hot through his shirt, the small of his back is so bony, god, is he sick? Was it always like this?
“Say what,” Tony presses, “That I’m a fag, steve? That Tony Stark is a cocksucker and Captain America cruises 54-”
Steve is very careful when he lets himself back in to Tony’s apartment. He steps lightly on the stairs, turns his key very gently in the doorknob, tiptoes around the apartment. He eats lunchmeat straight out of the bag from Tony’s mysteriously-stocked fridge. He doesn’t think Tony’s been in the city for weeks now – he’s been wherever Rumiko’s taken them.
this -
and it’s a sloppy excuse, it was poorly executed, Tony is going to push him away and make a joke about how Steve needs to wait for his brain cells to regenerate after all that choking –
It’s bait, they both know it. Tony’s expression doesn’t change and some barely-perceptible measure of disappointment runs through Steve when Tony doesn’t rise to it.
Maybe Steve is feeding him poison.
“What are you gonna do with your last few hours of freedom,” Steve says.
Tony meets his eyes. “Yes,” Tony says, his cheeks aflame, his voice low and deliberate. “I’d be happy to wear it all day, Commander,” he tells Steve.
He curls up on his side and clutches his head. It’s so bad, the last time it was this bad, he was coming out of a block of ice and Janet was telling him that he was in the future, oh god, what if he’s having a stroke, what if he’s dying, he can’t remember what he did yesterday or the day before, what if he’s losing something important –
He’s done it before, once. Tony had laughed and let himself be pushed around. He’d loved it.
You still respond to me, Steve growls in his ear, and Tony feels a stabbing pain blooming in his pelvis. He thinks Steve is tearing him, he thinks Steve doesn't remember his strength. He opens his mouth in a silent scream against the bed. God, he's going to die, he's going to die.
Steve runs a hand over his face to swab away his own tears. It smells like sex, it smells like Tony.
He settles for a phone call.
Steve used to write him letters; way back at the beginning, when things were simpler and the future seemed bright and they all would have died for each other.
Tony wakes up to soaked-through sheets and pain in his chest that feels like a heart attack. He remembers what Leonard said and fumbles around in the dark so he can shake Klonopin into his unsteady hand.
, he says,
In Steve’s deepest, darkest fantasy, he apologizes to Tony.
“I need my meds,” he amends, his voice pitched into a hoarse whisper.
“I’m just human,” Tony tells him.
“I’ve got you,” he murmurs into Tony’s skin, and Tony lets it drop, or carries it with him, maybe, maybe that’s the stiffness in his legs when Steve lays him out and presses kisses into the soft skin of his stomach, maybe that’s why Tony is biting his lip instead of moaning, maybe this is the best they can ever hope for.
He’s so bashful, now. Turns his head away, barely looks at Steve when they do this. Once upon a time it was
Mike, Mike, Mike, Gary says, and Steve is left with silence and Tony’s rapidly receding face and one hand crammed into his boxers.
“I was in love with you,” Tony tells him, and Steve rocks with Tony’s head lolling back on his shoulder.
Which don't you want more, Tony says. This? Or me, dying.
He pulls himself the fuck together. Freshens his face, wipes his tears away. Smudges his makeup, runs a hand through his hair. Does three shots in a row back at the bar to get the taste of Steve’s come out of his mouth.
is buried in his chest and Steve wants to hit something –
“I just love you,” Steve says.
Better than a wedding ring, he thinks, and laughs, and laughs, and laughs until sobs bubble up.
“You’re not a coward,” Steve says, because he doesn’t want to talk about Rumiko, he’s made it clear, but Tony barrels on –
“What if I suffocated you,” he’s saying. “What if you died like this, I’d have to,
It’s all Steve can do to try and stop himself from coming, immediately, as he lines up to slide into Tony’s body, but the couch dates back to Howard and it sags under his weight. The head of his cock bumps uselessly against Tony’s balls.
Steve looks at his watch. The blackout gives him seven more minutes. More than enough. “Sue’s not on vacation, Reed,” he says, and digs in his pocket.
“There’s a piece of metal in my chest, Steve, what kind of imaging do you really think I can get–”
I felt it when you got stabbed, Steve tells him. In space.
A woman cowers in front of him. His shadow covers her face. She screams, she runs.
He feels like drowning but that’s impossible, there’s solid ground under his feet and a man who loves him just as much as Steve loves him back.
Steve is giddy with it. “
Wakandan nights are cold without Tony curled around him, buried in his body.
The day of the funeral, Tony carries a flask in his pocket.
He accepts Tony's silence.
Tony puts his head between his legs and seriously considers re-crushing his hand between the table and the arm of the chair. He slips his hand into his pocket, instead, tries to fumble the lid off his prescription bottle and his little white pills go spilling out all over the floor.
“How would you know what I want these days,” Steve says. “You’re high, Tony.”
“It’s,” Steve pauses. The rhythm is not one he's used to hearing from Tony. Regular. Something else underneath it. “Are you okay?”
“Tony,” Steve says.
“Don’t,” Tony breathes. He’s slipping, he wants to grip the edge of his seat but his broken hand is sealed up inside the cuff and he tries to match his breathing to the hiss of the recycled air–
Steve’s letters are peppered with things like
Tony’s new secretary answers. Steve is almost certain she’s an AI because she’s flippant and because she treats him just like everyone else. She asks if he wants to leave a message, if he wants to arrange for an appointment with Mr. Stark.
“Then what,” Steve says. “Did you just decide we were all moving too slow for you and you were gonna become a cyborg?”
They’re so stupid.
“Whenever my support team shows up,” Steve snorts. “This isn’t secure, Jim, you know that-”
He sits on the curb and leaves a message on Carol’s cell phone.
I am one man, Steve yells back. I'm not going.
She leaves. Her errand is done; she has other people to douse with sobering news.
I thought I was dead, Tony says, and he can feel Steve's body held tense and heavy against his own.
“It’s called a pacemaker,” Tony says.
, did he hire you to fuck me and run, am I going to wake up to some story about what a fag Tony Stark is, was the ambassador not enough for you vultures–”
Tony sets the plug vibrating again and Steve gasps. Too much, too fast. He feels as dizzy as he can feel while fully hydrated, fully oxygenated. Tony could do anything, Tony is all over the place tonight.
“Be explicit. So there are no
Steve can’t help it, he’s gone. He’s done. He whimpers into Tony’s open mouth and Tony won’t stop clenching, won’t let him pull away, won’t stop sucking at his neck.
we get there, I will personally beg each and every person who has ever been a rostered Avenger to come to bat for you.”
“I think she means
“Tony–”
“I’m not going to the hospital,” Tony says, and there’s not even fight in him, he just tilts his head back like he’s trying to melt into the wall. He squeezes his eyes shut and takes a shuddery breath. “I don’t want to fight, ok, just, I need to regroup–”
“Look how that turned out for them,” Steve says.
Right here, right now, with this man, Steve can almost believe that there is nothing in the world to weigh him down. He is able to forget his shame.
He’s so cold.
You can't lie to me, Steve says, and he looks mad with it. He taps his temple like it's gone insane. I can feel how fucking scared you are, Steve says. And you're scared of me. And I have to listen to you and you tell me something and the bond tells me something else, who am I supposed to listen to, Tony -
He is pulling out all his tricks. He cards his hands through Tony’s curling hair. He can still feel that – his head was in the helmet; some of his scalp can still discern warmth and pressure. He strokes over Tony’s shoulder until the tremors subside, a little, as much as they ever do. He produces a bottle of something that smells sweet and fragrant and rubs it into Tony’s skin, soothes it into his muscles (what muscles?).
Steve’s skin is sweaty, he knows, but this man keeps touching him, tracing the lines of his stomach, down, down, feather light, before he wraps his fingers deliberately around Steve’s belt and fumbles with the clasp. The sound is barely audible, lost under the moaning, under the beat. It falls loose around his hips, and Steve thinks that he can only hold off for so long, being teased like this.
Siberia, Tony says, for the nth time.
He lets the gauntlet slide back into his arm and puts his hand on the bare ice, crystalline blue, a jagged block and Steve’s eyes snap open in his prison, rheumy and bloodshot.
He floods Tony's room with light, opens the windows so Tony gets the late fall breeze coming off the river. He cultivates a space they can share without choking on their own fetid guilt. Tony mistakes it for sweetness at first, but then he notices Steve discreetly checking his phone, his brow furrowed. Steve carefully leaves the basal thermometer on the bedside table like it's coincidence, like he doesn't want to push. He does his best to remind Tony that .
Tony’s been doing this, lately. Steve understands why he won’t leave the house; the paparazzi are practically climbing the walls, since. Storm graciously drives them away when she can but they always scuttle back like roaches and so Tony cowers in a way he hasn’t done for years and smiles like he’s dying and locks himself out of the garage.
He gets a handful of Tony’s cock. He just wants to feel him. He’s been here. It doesn’t feel real, he’s half-convinced he’s in an illusion. He slides Tony’s skin up and down, a single stroke. He can feel the adrenaline spike, and if this is what touching Tony does to him he never wants to stop –
One year.
He throws his coffee cup at the wall and it drips onto his workbench, stains blueprints with a layer of dust on them. He picks his way through ceramic shards to look at whatever he’s ruining, whatever was working on a few weeks ago, half a lifetime ago before he was
In his fantasy, Steve reaches out his hand. He closes his eyes and imagines the future, pines for the past. The Time Gem appears, as if summoned, as if it’s wired to him. Tony would call that arrogance. It’s not like Steve even succeeded. Tony would have, Tony should have worn it, Tony would have –
“Do you want to stop,” he says.
“Here’s how I want you feel,” Tony says. “I want you to feel like you don’t matter to anyone.”
He’s not lying; Tony is hard. The head of his cock is flushing a deep purple-pink. The late afternoon light casts him in golds and pinks – the bronze of his tan skin, the flush creeping up his chest.
That's fucking manipulative, Tony points out. Even for you.
“Your manners suck.”
- - -
“Talk to me,” Steve implores. “Tony, please, talk to me.”
Steve takes it with more grace than Tony anticipates. He hates it. He wants Steve to fight back. He wants the Steve that is a little too arrogant and a little too strong and a little too Alpha for his own good.
“Armor doesn’t play well,” Jen says. “It makes you faceless.”
,” Steve is saying. “Find, Tony. Better. Tony.”
Steve thinks he must be a businessman. He wears a burgundy suit, expensive material, just enough buttons undone to be indecent. He sniffles every few seconds, and Steve tries to quash the idea that he’s picked up a fucking junkie for the modern equivalent of a back alley blowjob in Paris. The action of the guy’s throat as he swallows is too mesmerizing for Steve to care too much. Mob, maybe, he re-assesses: he looks
Something that looks like candlelight flickers in Tony's periphery. Something wet is in him, around him. He is so open, so, so wet. He can feel Steve's come on his skin where the air currents hit, Steve's weight on his back.
Tony wonders who will be the first to give up. He wonders if they are the last, if the team is dead somewhere, if they're going to do this forever, just the two of them, until Steve goes insane or Tony withers and dies.
Shellhead: sometimes Tony thinks Steve is mixing that one up, but it seems to make sense to other people. They nod. They call him Shellhead, too, rarely. The blond woman who comes to watch movies with him, sometimes, she says it. Maybe it’s a joke, and he’s forgotten.
He shuffles along in his chains and squeezes his broken hand into a fist and thinks about that coin Daredevil slid him. Regret is sharp, regret is psychosomatic. You can’t damage a husk.
“…sell that, you know,” Gary is saying, hoarse and lazy enough to make Steve flush, and then someone is in the hallway and Michael’s laughter is echoing just on the other side of Steve’s door and something slides under the gap and skids to a stop on the linoleum.
The man chuckles, even though there’s no way he could have heard that, offers Tony a sheepish smile, then leans in to whisper in Tony’s ear. Tony doesn’t hear what he says, but it’s nice, the feeling of warm breath so close to his ear, the stubble. He shivers even though he’s sweating through his shirt. It makes something in his brain light up. He wants more of that, he wants another bump, he wants a drink. He wants this golden god to bend him over one of the balconies and take him bare.
He’s beginning to think Tony almost died.
“’Don’t ruin this?’” Steve fires back, digs his fingers into Tony’s hips before he remembers he can’t do that because he’s going to bruise. “Can you understand why it might be concerning to hear that while we’re doing this?”
The man laps at him even after he’s done, and it’s all Steve can do to hold himself up and not fall to his knees.
“Tell me,” Tony says.
Steve carefully pulls his suit jacket off, toes off his leather shoes, and leaves them under the coffee table. Slides in next to Tony, worms his arm around him under the quilt. He rubs Tony’s shoulder and kisses the crown of his head.
He is a work of art that is ever-evolving. He is the cutting edge. His firmware will be his fortress. He will step beyond his biological imperatives.
They’re so young, he thinks. He is so young. This is what life looks like.
Steve says: I did that.
“Yeah,” Tony says, his voice breaking on the end of it, and Steve’s anger melts away, because Tony toes up to wrap his arms around Steve. “So I have this heart thing.”
Tony’s always had solutions to everything except time and circumstance.
The man who’s trying to kill him flips him over, drags him through the mud, gets one red-gloved hand around his throat.
“Why can’t you do anything,” he says. “There’s always something else, what else is there-”
Steve’s breath is ragged and ugly and the music is loud and relentless and he rises to the invitation with a shamelessness he didn’t think he was capable of. The man’s throat makes a noise every time Steve pulls out that drives him closer to the edge. He puts his hand back up on the wall, lets the drywall crack, revels in the headiness of this place, this moment, thoughts darting in his head:
The first time, he fucks it up. He doesn’t remember the letters well enough, can’t sort them out. He gets out an “I,” an “L” on Steve’s broad chest. Steve strokes a thumb over his hand, and Tony wishes he could shudder, wishes he could scream, and tries again.
Steve waits, entirely still, lets his anticipation coil and dance and thrum underneath his skin. He wants it, he would do anything for it, he would say anything, he would be a terrible spy, it’s been months since they’ve done this and all he wants is the taste of Tony’s skin and Tony has to give it to him, Jesus, he’s whining, he must be beet-red, his balls are covered in his own slick, Tony knows, every time, exactly what to deny him.
Mystery Man pulls his head and does something that Steve used to do, a kind of double take with his eyes and his mouth pulling up into a bemused smile. He leans back in and mouths “I don’t know how to dance” in Tony’s ear, except he’s a liar and they’re still moving together like the club will just melt away behind them if they can get close enough.
Tony’s heartbeat skips, just once, and then picks up again like it had never lapsed. Stronger, faster.
You're not even sorry, Tony says, and he reaches out across the bond before he realizes he's staring into space, again, there's no way for him to transmit his anger even if he wanted to. It feels like screaming all alone in a padded room. The line goes nowhere.
“Where the hell is Captain America,” Tony screams at him. “Where’s the
He looks again. She’s right. He laughs, leans right into his drug-induced lassitude.
“Don’t be crass,” Steve chides, but he flushes all the same.
“Maybe,” Steve says. “Call the guard, Tony.”
This is mine, Steve tells him. This is
Tony isn’t sure about that now.
It’s Tony.
Tony grasps at his shirt, weakly, fits his head into the crook of Steve’s neck.
,” Tony says, holding his hand back under the water.
Steve has to grab the base of his cock with his free hand to stop himself from coming right then and there onto Tony’s face.
- - -
“Do you want a divorce?” Tony asks.
Carol sits next to him and nudges her thigh against his. “Listen to me,” she murmurs.
What the fuck did you take, Tony says. He tries to weigh the likelihood he will come out of this alive. He tries to determine if this is his last opportunity to be honest.
“Okay,” Tony says. “I thought.” He pushes his fries around his plate and balls his hands into fists. “I thought it would be better to keep it in the family,” he says carefully.
He keeps seeing that bundle of metal set into Tony’s bare chest, the raw edges around it like Tony’s body was rejecting it. Keeps wondering:
, touch me, please, I want to feel you, ungh,
Tony, Steve tells him, like he is delivering news about a death, and the joke is on him. You're malnourished, he starts. You're. He falters. You're bondsick.
It is so abysmally tender that Tony can’t stand his own silence even a moment longer.
He’d forgotten what it feels like to have metal in his chest. He’s seizing, maybe, what’s left of him, his body is jerking where he isn’t pinned between Steve and the ground by this fucking piece of metal through his heart.
It’s not untrue. He thinks about the letter he wrote and thinks about what came before. A band-aid slapped on gaping wound.
he tries to say, but all that’s in his mind is
“You’re chipper,” Tony says, and Steve laughs, giddy, kisses him on the cheek.
“Why do you say things like that,” Steve says.
“We can’t both get in, Gary,” Michael is saying. “You know how it is for couples–”
“–what fucking possessed you,” the man is whispering. "I hate magic." He’s stroking Steve’s forehead, he’s smoothing his hair back. The guy’s hands are shaking, but it’s nice. Gentle. Steve’s hands shake sometimes, too, and it feels kind so Steve takes it. He feels like he’s going to be sick and he thinks about how nice the man’s voice is and he gets that feeling again. The sensation that someone is stabbing him with an icepick and it’s his fault. He tastes iron. He feels blood trickling out of his nose.
There are tears sliding out of Tony’s eyes again.
He watches, for a while. Tony’s skin turns pale as death in the blue hours of the morning. It makes the shadow under his eyes stark, the rise and fall of his chest seem fragile. He watches as the golden hour dawns and Tony seems to soften in the beams that fall through his enormous picture windows.
“Oh, Tony,” Steve says. “I didn’t mean–”
Liar, Nat tells him. Wheels up in 10. You've never been a coward a day in your life, Steve. The air behind her smells like dahlias.
Tony’s head snaps up, because he said no flyovers. No interruptions. A sacred place. He barely catches the gold before it runs past the hems of his sleeves and creeps up his neck. This isn’t going to be a war zone.
Tony’s hips turn gold, there’s that weird liquid metal racing across his skin.
Samson wants to adjust his meds and Tony answers everything in the affirmative just to make him go away. He holds a mug of coffee that’s gone cold between his hands as they clean up the glass and remind him that he’s wasting valuable SHIELD resources. Tony blinks and blinks and doesn’t cry and apologizes.
There are SHIELD agents everywhere, so Tony puts his head between his knees and squeezes his broken hand until he’s alone again.
"I'm sorry," he tells the medic. “I don’t know him."
It is so very generous of Tony to give him his very own mausoleum.
Pepper shows up and strides right past Steve with nothing more than a glare, into their bedroom. She sits on the edge of the bed and pets his hair or whatever the fuck it is she does at times like these.
Tony isn't going to think about that. He turns on everything that can be turned on. Lights up his dank little corner of the world. Drowns his own thoughts out with the wailing of guitars, floods his limbic system with sensory input. Wires himself into the tower's electrical grid, just for fun. Strobes the lights until he is shaking and tired, and then writes code to override the sleep problem. Lets his messages pile up. Becomes tired of color, writes code that renders the world in black and white, just like one of Steve’s old movies. He’s read that people only dreamed in color after they invented color television.
He cuts himself on it, smears blood all over Tony’s signature. It’s just damaged enough that the light blinks on and off at random. A loose connection. If he had Tony, he’d take it to Tony’s workshop and lean on the door and smirk and say something clever and Tony would take it from him, Tony would say
He has the decency to sound ashamed. He's not a stupid man. He trips on his failures, circles them endlessly.
Tony hates Indian.
In Tony’s dreams, he is back in the street, in a crater, the city on fire around him. Steve kneels over him and beats him to within an inch of his life.
Good. Then you'll get on that fucking ship -
,” and Tony’s hands are shaking. “It’s deeper than it was yesterday, I think it’s – it’s adapting, or something, what if I come out like Ultron, what if it’s controlling me–”
He adds a nerve-blocker to his antipsychotic regimen and lies in the dark in excruciating pain until he gives in and takes the Percocet they gave him.
“Metahuman,” Steve whispers into his ear. “That’s a nice word for traitor.”
, Tony thinks, as if Steve’s very will is draining into what’s left of Tony, as if Steve has lent him his strength one last time. Tony cranes his neck up just enough to press his lips to Steve’s whiskered cheek and feels the tears rolling off his face. He begs forgiveness. He wills Steve to understand. He’d like to think that maybe, despite everything, Steve still loved him, at the end. That in his more compassionate moments, he understood Tony was human. That Tony built cracks into his armor so Steve would always be able to get in.
It comes so readily. Steve is so easy to lie to.
“What about your ego,” Tony says. “What about that time you decided I wasn’t worth the trouble, I wasn’t worth a five-minute conversation, and you looked me in the eye and smiled and lied to me, Steve–”
, he thinks, and he can hear it clear as a bell in some stranger’s voice and his mouth smiles and then it’s gone again like a dream he can’t quite call back and –
He flees down the stairwell.
Tony isn’t allowed visitors, but Carol is registered and moving up in the world of SHIELD and shows up as a stand-in for his parole officer on a Friday afternoon.
He doesn’t make the conscious decision to pull his hand away from Tony like he’s been burnt, but he does, and it happens, and it’s not fair.
Tony snorts. “Fan club of one.”
It doesn’t take much; Tony is right there, hot and solid and alive. Whole. Pressed up against Steve’s side.
For all of Steve's transgressions, Tony hates him most for using his body against him. Steve knows all of Tony's ugliest failures, all of his most intimate fears. He feels as if he has been scraped inside, out. There is something holding him wide. He squirms despite the bright wash of pain, aches to be fuller.
Steve stands. Undoes his belt. Deliberately leaves his fly for Tony’s clever mouth. “In a minute,” he says. “I think you have a debt of gratitude to settle, first.”
Tony leans into his side; his hair still sticky-soft and his face smooth shaven. He tells Steve about Reed’s exploration, about what really happened to change his biology permanently. Parallel dimensions, Tony is saying. Some of the wonder comes back into his voice, just for a moment. He sounds like Asimov, he sounds like a dreamer again. They could have anything, Tony says. Think of the technology we don’t even know about. What if, he says, but he says it like he only half-believes it himself, like he wants to be closing his hand around something solid but all he’s getting is mist.
“Just leave,” Tony hisses from behind his hands. “Just go away.”
Steve leans down to kiss him and Tony swings his legs over the side of the couch, steadies himself on the coffee table with one filthy hand smeared all over Steve’s newspaper clippings. He hisses – bare feet, crystal.
Steve is right.
Tony steps into his space (how can Tony still not know, how did
She checks the collar that sits around Tony’s neck before they start. It's a better design than the anklet. Increased durability, adaptive materials. It can't be removed because it's wired into his brainstem.
“Tony,” Carol says. Like she’s embarrassed.
Steve pulls the quilt over them and nudges the temperature control up a few degrees.
“Make it stop,” Steve moans. He’s bleeding on this nice man’s shirt. Something is lost on him. He thinks he’s having a stroke. He feels like he’s done something bad. Something wrong.
Steve perches on the edge of the bathtub, close at hand in case Tony passes out. “He picked up your distress signal from an island in the North Pacific,” he recites, “You wouldn’t say anything to him, Pepper says you’ve been missing for two weeks, you had no armor and you were barely conscious.”
“Do you have any idea how much shit I’m taking for you right now,” he says, curt, somewhere behind Steve. Clinking, glasses. Liquor sloshing into a glass. Tony steps into his field of vision without his jacket, rips his glasses off, tosses them carelessly on the coffee table. "You cost me money, you cost me time."
Steve pulls out, and Tony sags on his knees. He retches. A welter of bile and Steve's come slides around the drain.
Steve hears himself scream.
You don't smell like him.
Tony never appreciated how beautiful Steve’s anger was.
Tony ignores him and strides past the stocked bar cart and down through the common area and stands before a pile of crates.
“Fuck your conscience,” Tony says, his voice piteous and small. “I missed you.”
Steve curls around him on their enormous bed, tells him about something called “team.” Tony can’t follow most of it – he gets names, once in a while.
Steve rides the elevator with a beautiful woman who smells like Tony’s cologne. She gets off the elevator on the 83rd floor, where Tony’s executive offices are, and Steve lets the doors slide shut and rides right back down to the lobby.
It takes his eyes some time to focus, but eventually he finds what he’s supposed to be looking at: a blue-eyed sobbing man standing just beyond the bay doors.
“Tony,” he says, and Tony is huddled into the sectional wrapped in a quilt. He’s been crying, because he does that often, now. Steve never knows what will trigger it, the torrent of helplessness he doesn’t know how to shut off.
“When are you gonna let me kiss what’s under here,” Steve murmurs.
“That doesn’t,” Tony says, and drags his hands over his face. “Just – stop, I’m making a mess of this, I’m sorry, you should, I shouldn’t have–”
Why are you letting me, Steve says. He pumps the base of the thing idly and Tony wants to tell him to stop, to let him rest. Steve finds another stray trickle and rubs it over Tony's lips, smooths his hair back from his face.
He thinks he needs to forget about Tony for a while.
“Yeah, I know,” Tony sighs. He sits down. He’s not even going to push the point.
He should be able to get something from it. Anything. An impression, an ache, a sharp taste at the back of his throat.
Tony makes the world seem simple. Like he always has it firmly in hand.
Tony takes a while to answer. “I’m wondering if I’m something you’re going to regret tomorrow,” he breathes. “I’m wondering if you want all of me.”
“Proof of life,” Steve says. “As long as you lend your assistance to me with this project, I make sure they stay alive. Tony has some ideas about the portal. Of course, I trust you’ll keep this between us. SHIELD clearance, red tape, you know.”
“Because you’re a criminal, Steve,” Tony says. He sounds tired. He pats at himself with a towel, throws it at Steve. Steps into his pants without putting on new underwear. “What was I supposed to do,” he says dully. “Leave a message?” He tosses a bottle of water at him, and Steve almost fumbles it.
“Christ, Tony,” Steve says. “Get your pants off.”
“You leap,” Tony says, like that’s any kind of explanation. “You have a gymnast thing going on–”
The man laughs. “Once or twice,” he says. His voice wavers a little. He hesitates. “I’m Tony,” he says.
“As far as you’ll let me,” Steve says.
Tony doesn’t stop him.
As soon as it’s left his mouth, he knows it’s wrong.
His chest is a vise, because how is he expected to do this? He knows what it feels like. The all-alone, the forever stretching on and on in front of him, alone, again.
Steve’s thumb is right over Tony’s carotid.
Tony has money again, has a seven-figure salary and an empty skyscraper and ghosts in every room.
Steve blinks once, slow and deliberate: assent, agreement.
Steve says, close your eyes, and the wash of lukewarm water feels freezing against his feverish skin. I'm taking care of you, Steve tells him, and brushes a hand over Tony's face, smooths his hair back.
Tony imagines that and his whole body stills, because it’s a fucking pipe dream.
“You know what,” Tony says. “Fuck you.” He fumbles with his wallet, the beds of his nails paler and paler every day, comes up with a few hundreds, throws them on the table. Marches out to where Happy is parked, holding the wall for guidance as he goes.
Steve thinks he should be used to it by now. It’s why he decided on the Village when he could have settled anywhere (Jersey City, Queens, across the East River, 42nd to be closer to that penthouse Tony uses when he isn’t staying at the Mansion). He wanted life in all its messy vibrancy. He’ll do anything to get the hum, the ambient city noise to help him sleep: a bottle smashing against a brick wall, raucous shouting. The siren song that’s supposed to drag him from complacency and lure him back into the night.
Steve would talk about the cold, the smell of smoke. The way the buildings were run through with jagged wounds, the way their windows had fallen out like missing teeth. The brilliant color of the sky once the fires went out. The way you knew you were riding the edge of a wave, that just a few miles away the Germans were still dug in.
Steve grabs the back of Tony’s head and cradles him, ear to ear, Steve’s lips against his curling dark hair.
And then he's gone. Steve pushes himself off the bed with sudden, abject disgust in his features. He looks at his hands, he looks at Tony. He reaches over his shoulder, almost absently, and then stops in his tracks. Like he's realized where he is. Who he isn't, anymore.
” Steve says, and rests there, on his elbows, and that’s when he feels Tony’s cock still bobbing between them.
“What makes you think it will take this time,” Stephen Strange asks him.
“Why is this so important,” Reed says.
“I thought it was ok, too,” Tony echoes, drumming his fingers absently around the casing. “It’s not so bad,” he says, and his gaze slides past Steve again. “I got through the chest plate,” he croaks, like he’s giving himself the world’s shittiest pep talk. “I can get through it, it will be fine, it’s not a big deal–”
Steve blinks. “You can’t leave the team,” is what comes out of his mouth.
“Then you owe me,” Steve says.
Steve sucks in a breath. He can’t stand it, not knowing. “Did someone do this to you,” he says. “Is someone – geez, Tony, you look like hell–”
“Your review is coming up,” she says. She ducks her head to try to catch Tony’s gaze. Tony wrings his hands under the table to stop them from shaking. She is kind enough not to use the word “trial.”
The part of him that is living in the future, that is inaccessible, wants to know what really did it. If it was Thanos. If it was the hunger. If it was the cumulative loneliness of the whole affair. If it was sealed from the moment he decided he was going to go to Siberia and
Maria calls him at two. “We got it,” she tells him, the roar of a copter in the background. “Your portal thing.”
“I should shower,” Tony says, pulling on his pants, pressing his cock back under his zipper. He doesn’t spare Steve a second glance.
Yeah, Steve says.
, come on, hey-”
“Ultron programmed her,” Tony mumbles. “I don’t think I can handle that, if she goes, too, Steve, everyone turns on me or, or, or leaves.”
, Steve wants to say. Too kind, too careful.
This is what the future feels like.
past it, my heart is fine–”
Steve thinks he expected Tony to kiss like kissing is a sport, like Tony does everything else, all confidence and power and that reminder that you’re in the presence of greatness. This isn’t like that; this is a seduction and Steve doesn’t fully understand why Tony would bother, Steve is a stranger, they’ve done something filthier than this already but Tony is so
Steve jerks forward and almost topples face-first onto the rug.
He runs diagnostic after diagnostic and finds that there’s nothing measurably wrong with him.
If that kid can walk around in his underwear, Steve can attract the right kind of attention. He slides onto the dance floor and takes his cigarette with him. Fake it til you make it. He thinks he heard that first from Tony, after he woke up. He thinks about the desperate, empty way Tony was starting to smile when Steve left. He runs a hand through his hair, puts his cigarette out on the bar. He’s build like a truck. They’ll look. He knows how some men pretend not to stare when he goes to the gym, knows what he’s wearing leaves little to the imagination.
Tony kicks Leonard’s arm away, stands, fires off a repulsor blast that goes through Steve’s chest and leaves a smoldering black mark scorched into the wall.
He wants to cry with the unfairness of it, that it has to happen like this if it happens at all, now.
“I love you,” Tony says.
Steve is crying again, and this time it just sluices down his face, hot and itchy and he’s proud that Tony doesn’t notice. Tony’s hips are gold again and his face is buried in his arm and he’s quivering but he moans Steve’s name and Steve feels himself harden a little and bends to take Tony’s cock in his mouth so Tony’s won’t notice.
He stays there a while. Tony feels the itch of his come trickling out. Steve must feel it, too, because he collects it with his finger and puts it on Tony's tongue.
“I try not to make a habit of assault – psychic or otherwise – but here we are,” Steve answers.
Too amiable, maybe. Would he say that? Would Tony expect this from him? God, he doesn’t know.
He loses hours, then days. He stumbles. He says less to Nebula, and he is too weak to perceive whether or not that's hurting her. He trips and slams his head into a bulkhead. He stops moving. He stops thinking. The hunger grows until it almost stops, if he holds his breath and shuts his eyes and pretends he's dead.
“No,” Steve rasps, “fuck me for real
Just kill me, Tony thinks. Just do it, just do it, just do it –
Steve wants to tell him no. That Rumiko is waiting for him, that he shouldn’t squander his chance with her for this.
“Fuck,” Tony says. “Fuck, Jen, what–”
Something runs through his brain, a zap, a jolt. There’s no pain, just the deep, nagging sensation that something is wrong.
Howard’s never lost a fucking thing in his life.
Steve drags his body into position. He inches up Tony’s thigh, bends forward, has to rest his head on Tony’s shoulder to do it, nestles his cock just inside the crease where Tony’s thigh meets his torso. His hands are still bound. He is so hard his cock jumps when he touches Tony’s skin.
“You lifted Mjolnir,” he says dully.
It’s generally not so easy. There must be some caveat, one of Tony’s secret stressors that eats away at him on his own time. Something to deal with later. Tony’s eyes are closed, and Steve reaches one gloved hand to stroke at his face, to slide his bare thumb into Tony’s easy slick mouth.
“That’s not –
Steve must have given him a drip, not just a push. The bright pain of his collarbone is lessened. There's an icepack on the bedside table, there's a note in Steve's hand. Dosages and three little vials. A six-pack of pudding and a little cup of semen defrosting. The thermometer.
“Do you want me to come back,” Steve says.
Something dark curls up his spine. Envy.
“I don’t want to talk about Bethany,” Tony says. “I didn’t come to 54 to think about women, Steve,”
Steve coaxes Tony onto the sofa, armed with new gauze and a warm washcloth and fresh underwear. Tony lets him change the bandages, lets him scrub at his skin one inch at a time and smooth new butterfly strips on and daub Neosporin on his stitches. He goes somewhere else, his eyes vacant, his gaze sliding away.
- - -
There is an itch. He doesn’t recognize it; its presence is baffling. Once upon a time he might have suspected someone was leaving him a dead drop, but now he’s a feeble irrelevant thing. People don’t bring him missions anymore. He flips it over - nothing on the back, just a stamped logo that says Stark Enterprises.
It's too much, too fast. Steve, Tony says, and grabs the handrail. Steve presses Tony's whole face into the hospital bed, throws one leg over Tony's hip like he's mounting, for real. Bars his arm across Tony's back. Rails him until he groans with the effort, then settles into a deep, leisurely finish.
