”Me too.  They’re in that fridge over by the drill-press,” Tony said, indicating the appropriate direction with a nod.
He fished a red, greasy rag from the pocket of his coveralls, and began wiping his hands on it.  They weren’t getting perceptibly cleaner.
“Tony… that wasn’t your fault,” Whitney told him, looking away and moving the breakfast dishes onto the nightstand.
He got up and unplugged the clock, shoving it under the bed to deal with later.  He got dressed, costume first, then street clothes on over it.
at the lovely, entwined shape his female teammates made, Steve turned around abruptly, the blush on his face and ears deepening.
Steve got him one.  It was olive green, with oddly simple stitching on both ends that made Peter mortally certain there were museum directors who would kill him for it with a clear conscience.  But it was clean, so he asked no questions.
Tony picked up the gleaming bead of a cracked capacitor from the handful of parts left on the desk and studied it, frowning thoughtfully.
“So,” Tony began briskly, sitting on the closed lid of the toilet and folding his arms, “-what the hell happened?”
Tony spotted a coffee cup in the sink, and sniffed it.  Something with chicken.  He didn’t remember drinking that, and obviously Steve had put the cup in there… had they been talking about the ring last night?  Had he, on top of everything
Tony moved the spider-tracer aside to sketch it in permanently, and- -stopped, his pencil poised.  With or without the spider, the design, the
“Power Man called,” Peter tapped his Spider-comm, “They just found the original Captain America.  …Wouldn’t he be really old by now?”
“Well, since you’ve already seen my face without the cowl you may as well call me Steve,” Steve offered, extending his hand.
“LAST STOP, SUCKAH!”  Luke snarled, turning the open-sided vehicle ninety degrees and giving it a good shake.
A slight noise behind him brought Peter’s spider-sharp senses to screaming wakefulness, and he whirled around, poised.
He glanced down without moving, and stroked his thumb across the skin of Tony’s shoulder.  Tony sighed inaudibly and settled in again, more bonelessly than before, if such were possible.  He felt good there.  Relaxed, but solid.
“I need you to get Spider-Man and your mechanic safely to Avengers tower, and then disappear.  Can you do that?”
Harry paused for a moment, lips parted.  Then he nodded quickly, and headed back the way they had come.
“Honey, if I had, how would I know?  The man has a secret identity, same as most of the capes in this city…”
Ten minutes later, Tony wandered out scratching the side of his jaw.  He turned on the light, and started.
Tony’s eyes focused forwards as he flew, actually squinting a little against the glare of the metal-fire, isolated in the darkness.
Tony folded his arms down loosely at his sides, and felt the full weight of the shield settle squarely across his shoulders for the first time.
An early-model Harley-Davidson Panhead with a gas tank the same shade as the blue on Cap’s shield, and fittings of untouched, glowing chrome.
Iron Man frowned for a moment, then glanced down at the brightly glowing device in his chest, and started violently.  He -stared- at it, and half-raised one hand.
Tony darted out of line with War Machine’s chestplate just before the other suit’s unibeam fired.  It scorched the plating along the outside of his upper arm, hot enough to actually -feel-.
There had to be -dozens- of real estate companies in New York City, but within a time window of less than two weeks…
“No, War Machine.  Are you still flight-capable?”  Steve asked, looking up at his huge, heavily-armored teammate with no fear whatsoever.
It was windy this high up, and a faint tracery of frost had already formed across the cooling surfaces of War Machine’s two-tone gray armor.  A cold front was moving in, and it was cold inside the armor too.  War Machine left his suit’s environmental controls alone.  Heat would make him stand out to an infa-red scanner, and he’d taken worse cold in an unpressurized cabin over the English Channel.
Then he shot Peter a significant glance, and flicked a quarter-inch steel nut at Harry’s forehead, fast.
Tony clapped him on the back cheerfully, shuffled the coffee-stained papers together into a rough stack, and slapped them into Peter’s hands.
His sunglasses had fallen off, and he was looking straight into the clear blue eyes of Captain America for the second time.  And they really -were- blue, like the sky at forty thousand feet, while his…
“Hi again,” Tony said, and instantly started fishing for his lost sunglasses under the truck’s radiator.
“Well, I can’t exactly ask War Machine to fess up now, can I?  Not without implying that I had him followed.  …Avengers have to trust each other, Tony.”
”-Yes.  Norman is… still having a hard time with that, from what Dr. Faustus over at SHIELD tells me,” Steve noted, uncomfortably.
“No, he was an electrical engineer,” Tony said, relaxing a little, “-I started this place on my own dime.”
“Well that’s how it would feel.  Like it was my face they were hitting instead of my shield.  …I just don’t like the idea, even in fun,” Steve explained, frowning.
“But how would the Green Goblin get ahold of a SHIELD glider in the first place?”  Peter wanted to know.
It was a multi-level nightclub, tall lines of sputtering neon wavering in the heat of the blaze within.  The lower levels of the building were already gone, a glowing inferno through the open front double doors facing onto the street.  The shaken crowd outside had had the sense to fall back more at that point, and they cowered like a gold and polyester rainbow on the far side of the hastily erected police barricades.
“That’s what the glove is for,” Misty shrugged, philosophically.  “-It will still fit under that, right?  I brought my spare…”
Tony actually laughed.  He looked around the empty garage as if Sharon had asked him to produce Cap out of thin air.
him, testing the blonde’s reactions, stealing glances upwards from time to time and watching each lick, each smoothly wet shift of his mouth unfold across Steve’s unguarded face.
Tony flopped onto the two-thirds of the cracked green leather couch that Steve wasn’t occupying, and used the blonde’s jean-covered thigh for a pillow.
The scientist was working over by one of the lab sinks, carefully adding single drops of various chemicals to a densely-packed rack of test tubes, and noting down the results on a clipboard.  Innocent enough.
“Equipment -first-,” Tony insisted, swallowing quietly and wondering if he could brush off whatever was walking across the side of his neck without getting stung.
“-I mean what else was I going to tell her, that all three of you were staying with the Avengers because you’re
Blonde hair shining gold in the natural lighting up near the entrance, Steve was talking with The Falcon (Sam Wilson, since they were both out of costume) and sketching one of the garage’s more permanent customers.  He was an easygoing older man with slicked back steel-gray hair, a well-worn black leather vest, and a pair of brown-lensed aviator shades.  …How Steve had talked the man into sitting for him Tony wasn’t sure, but he found himself smiling anyway.

Tony thought about how easy it would be to make the wings on Steve’s cowl swivel and rise or droop to match his facial expressions, and smirked.
“-Just so you know, I’ve been waiting to tell you about this…”  Tony explained clearly, “-and it has
But for Hank Pym there was only Janet Van Dyne.  His gossamer-winged goddess.  The only woman for whom he could submerge his ego, even temporarily.  The love of Hank’s life, and in a way his greatest -thankfully most flawless- experiment.
A different and spicier kind of ambiance began to fill the air as Tony added his egg-turmeric mixture to what was already frying.
“You’ll have plenty of help tracking down the perpetrators, Colonel,” Steve promised, “-and once they’ve been brought to justice, I’m sure the papers will find something else to talk about.”
Steve remembered what an active agent tasted like.  Something between getting pure carbonation out of a soda fountain without the syrup, the slight choke of chalk dust, and something …sharper.  Dangerous.  Something that burned and numbed at the same time, yet still left a slight tang in his mouth, like powdered lemon soap.
Then, reluctantly, he reached up and disengaged the locks at the base of his heavy gray helmet, lifting it off.
“Heheh…”  Steve leaned in, and nuzzled the base of Tony’s ribcage.  This close to the reactor’s power sockets, he could feel the faintest brush of a static charge against the outer edge of his hair…
“Finders-”  Peter webbed the Skull’s back, and jerked him away from the glowing cube on the floor by the closet-  “-keepers!”
Tony knelt by the foot of the bed, and put his arms around where he judged Steve’s head and shoulders to be.  Steve’s scale-mail armor clinked a little under his hands.
But he’d gotten along with Hank for Jan’s sake, and the biochemist’s genius had been clearly worthy of Tony’s respect.
“Actually… no,” Tony admitted, drawing back a little, “-the shield is, ah… yours.  And besides, the lower edge of the metal is really digging into my back here…”
Peter came in with an irregularly crumpled brown paper grocery bag in his arms.  There was a fibrous sheen across one mangled corner that suggested it had been discreetly repaired with web.
“Well no, but- -word gets around, you know what I’m sayin?  Especially when the fruitcake blows up halffa Manhattan Island just ‘cause he’s
more time to be sure he wasn’t letting his shield in for anything nasty.  Tony looked reasonably trustworthy, if just a little… keen on the whole thing.
“Peter, no knowledge is actually -bad-, it’s just in how people use it.  I don’t use other people’s designs without permission unless I absolutely have to, but obviously it’s still a good idea to understand the technology that’s out there,” Tony explained, reasonably.  “-There’s nothing illegal in
But the royalty of the insect world no longer flew, and as of two years ago, neither did Ant-Man or the Wasp.
began, and the red and yellow jukebox’s gleaming face separated into three pieces.  The half-circle at the top pivoted upwards, and the bottom halves swung apart sideways.
He was still in full armor except for the red and gold helmet sitting on the chair beside him, and his shoulders were slumped in a way Sue had never seen before.
“-That goddamn hack…”  Tony sighed, jotting down the wiring information on the back of a flyer that had come with the furniture.  “-Why couldn’t he just leave well enough alone… …tried to fucking kill me…  …microwave the wax out of his pointy little mustache…  …lazy turd…”
, Tony’s reluctantly returning thoughts assured him.  He remembered to breathe with a sudden gasp and tasted blood from where he’d bitten his lip.  He probed the damage with the tip of his tongue.  It wasn’t deep.
“Good.  I, uh… I found it when I was putting the couch cushions back,” Steve said, running a hand through his own sleep-spiked hair.
He might have a -lot- of pictures stored that way, actually… it was a thing Tony had -known-, but…  now it
He would be… eight feet from the corner of the tan filing cabinet, and fifteen from the front of the jukebox.  And eighteen inches up.
‘Century Cryogenics’, that paid occasional repair bills to someone named Mitch Germaine, who maintained a joint checking account with Tony but didn’t seem to exist aside from this…
“Can I see it?”  Steve asked quietly, holding the tab of Tony’s coverall zipper between finger and thumb.
Easton’s world narrowed to just that hard, demonically leering visage as the Green Goblin’s purple-gloved hand drew back with a pumpkin bomb held high, and he fired.
“Oh yeah, are you kidding me?”  Tony assured her, “-I just meant you’ll have to wait until I can fabricate things again for the fine work.  I can patch it up now, no problem.”
“Ol’ Shellhead brought’cha in.  He’s waitin’ outside, actually,” Ben said, jerking a thumb towards the room’s only door.
“Okay, then it’s something else…”  Peter translated, undaunted.  “…What would happen if I opened the door?”
He could have taken apart the radio in the kitchen or the common room and fixed both helmet-radios, but even before dealing with Hank Pym, he hadn’t quite been willing to go there.  Yes the Avengers had resources, but tapping into them came with a price that had nothing to do with money, a price in acknowledged weaknesses, and… memories.
Part of his mind wasn’t ready.  Part of his mind was still scared, and if he pulled Tony’s mind apart far enough with his hands, he could watch the other man lose it from a safe distance again, and not think about what it might be like to hold him naked.
He was wearing his tan trench coat unbuttoned over his costume, and he looked tired in a way that would have been difficult for a stranger to see.
Tony blinked, and jerked awake a hundred feet lower than he’d been a moment ago, adrenaline flooding his system.  He opened the valve on his oxygen system a little wider, and took deep breaths.
Tony sighed through his nose, then opened his eyes deliberately and picked out a path across the gently rippling carpet towards the outside door with care.
Daredevil and Misty Knight looking exhausted, sitting on the wide, flat steps of a high-rise apartment building.
Steve was halfway to the door when it opened, and he stopped short, momentarily at a loss for words.
Tony pressed back down into the kiss he’d inadvertently broken, drawing Steve out, demanding -full- participation and making sure the other man had very little time to think.  Just in case.
Steve took out two beer bottles, and handed Tony one of them.  Tony popped the cap off with a practiced twist, drank, and set the bottle down on the concrete floor while he finished putting the rest of his tools away.
“I know.”  Tony paused, detaching Misty’s artificial hand entirely, and pressing in the flat stud on the inner radial frame that unlocked her outer arm-casing.  “So… how much did you win?”
Some of those young gods were dead now, sinking slowly into the rich soil of foreign jungles, or making their mark on the world in bloodstained office carpeting.
Tony swore, and pressed his open mouth against Steve’s shoulder without -quite- biting down.  His eyes shut tight, and he used Steve’s weight above him as a personal fulcrum, a stop-plate, a limiter that allowed
As Tony’s only known employee and Iron Man’s regular in-costume partner, Peter was already doubly vulnerable, but with the Green Goblin (apparently) targeting Spider-man…  What if a reporter decided to do a human-interest piece, and mentioned Aunt May or Mary Jane by name?
“…You don’t know I’m kidding, do you?”  Tony said, finally.  His eyes were soft, almost sad.  He reached out, and drew Steve’s head in against his chest, turning onto his back as he did so.  He stroked Steve’s almost-dry hair.  “I wouldn’t ask that.  Either it’s in you, or it isn’t.  Me, I’m always changing… adaptable.  I’ve heard that Turing and DaVinci were the same way, so maybe it comes with the territory.  -And I can’t think of one man on this planet that there’s less shame in bottoming for.”
“I will KILL you for this!”  The man shouted, twisting in Tony’s grasp like a mad tiger and trying to kick his legs free of the blankets that wound around them.
The Goblin laughed insanely, laughed somehow over the entire mall’s PA system, and reached eagerly into the orange bag held open in his left fist.
They were moving together again now, moving as only Steve could -make- them move.  Tony felt his eyes beginning to slip closed, remembered abruptly that he was the one
“-Right,” Steve placed a small kiss against the side of Tony’s neck just because he could, then walked past him towards the kitchen.
“BULLSHIT!  You just burned down my HOUSE!”  Tony snarled, throwing the gun aside and charging his right hand repulsor in front of War Machine’s faceplate, “-and MORGAN doesn’t have the BALLS!  Now- -WHO?”
Steve’s right hand clenched into a fist at his side, containing the otherwise dangerous strength of his body.  He shut his eyes, and fell into the sensation blind, trusting the other man to get him where he needed to go.
He remembered the first time some scum-sucker in SpecOps command had thought it would be a good idea to defrost the 1950’s ersatz Captain America.
A dog of uncertain breed, wearing a frayed camouflage bandanna, and sticking it’s wet black nose right up towards the camera.
Tony hooked a couple of fingers into the front collar of Steve’s costume as he did so, and gave Steve a dirty look when he tried to sit up.
The faint rushing noise grew louder, and over the last few chords of the song, a sudden primal roar went up from the crowd.  Matt swallowed.  The DJ swore on-air.
Steve moved closer so the current cord would reach, and Tony re-settled himself with a quiet sigh.  Steve pressed a kiss to his temple, then lay back against Tony’s pillow and shut his eyes.
,” Peter complained before the relatively brief kiss had ended, “-and that does NOT help a hungry spider…”
Holding Tony in his mouth still felt a little strange, and maybe it always would.  Still, it was something Steve could give, something he could understand.  A delicate balance of pressures, and technique, and care.  A kind of equality between men that needed no explanation, yet still allowed him to watch Tony come completely unglued in his arms.
And then he was coming, hard and hot against Tony’s stomach, pressing down closer and sliding his dick forcefully against Tony’s in a broken rhythm he soon lost- -and Tony picked up.
The corners of Tony’s eyes tightened slightly in annoyance, but he looked up over the seat of the Softtail he was working on.
The Green Goblin was, (insanity aside) just one man with what amounted to a bag of grenades and a standard-issue SHIELD glider… wasn’t he?
to still be working alone, which means that if we can get enough fliers into the air fast enough, we can run him down with dogfighting tactics.  That should be done soon, because this guy
War Machine reached up, and touched the dark, broken face of the beam-projector in the center of his chestplate with his thickly armored fingers, exploring the damage.
“You’re just hungry,” Steve said, smiling at Tony sidelong and stepping out of his blue leather pants.
Tony glanced out the windows consciously, then picked up a piece of the concoction in his fingers, and tried it.
“If you want to play with this shield,” Steve began quietly, “-you have to understand what it is first.”
Harry and MJ began a sudden and frantic discussion over how to accomplish this, on a jukebox that was already
War Machine was a good guy.  Supposedly.  But he bird-dogged the Midnight Racer, and if what Luke had learned about the fire at the Goblin’s hideout had been correct, the Racer
Tony stood somewhere in between, wearing a beautifully tailored suit that now fit him a little snugly across the shoulders, and watched Peter rejoin his classmates, diploma in hand, and indelible boyish grin firmly on his face.
Thinking about why brought him to tightly-focused thoughts about art pencils and shading, though.  Tony was his boyfriend, but he had been Steve’s best friend in this modern age
Tony put his tools back, and zipped the bag shut.  It clanked slightly as he slung it back over his shoulder, and he glanced around self-consciously.
“Well that’s the question, isn’t it…?”  Tony agreed, setting his jeweler’s glass down on the desk and leaning back in his chair a little.
Tony wandered out in a large bathrobe.  He’d just shaved, and the dark line of his mustache looked crisper than usual.
It was over far too soon for both of them, in a choked exclamation that looked almost painful, and a short snap of Steve’s hips that Tony put a stop to by pinning them down with both hands, -hard-.  Steve slumped back against the couch to catch his breath, and put a hand clumsily onto the back of Tony’s hair.  Tony swallowed carefully, and eased off.  He straightened up, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand absently.
“Hm-mm,” Tony shook his head, certain.  “…Never hurts when you do it, Steve.  You’re always- …so careful with me.  Feels like… Feels like flying,” Tony sighed, shutting his eyes and resting his chin on Steve’s shoulder “-feels… you feel
Four black and whites, two unmarked, and a swat van that had all been shrewd enough to assemble quietly in the parking lot behind him sometime in the past two minutes, in
Luke set the slightly bent forklift down, and looked around for stragglers.  The one who’d gotten the worst of the earlier collision was getting his bearings now, but he took one look at the forklift driver, then another at Iron Fist dragging his three remaining allies out of the shadows by two right wrists and a -foot-, and surrendered quickly.
“Ah-!”  The metal was cool, not exactly cold, and it adhered slightly to the faint sheen of nervous sweat along the crease of Tony’s spine.  The metal warmed quickly against his skin.
Peter took Harry’s left hand in both of his, and though he didn’t waken, Harry’s fingers closed slightly.
Spider-Man leapt out of the way of the next shot as if by magic, and vanished behind a silo of granular sulfur.
Tony caught his breath, and looked into Steve’s resolute face with newfound understanding.  He closed the distance between them in two steps, pinned Steve firmly against the kitchen counter, and kissed him.  Steve’s forgotten coffee splashed across his own fingers and Tony’s hip, and they broke apart abruptly.
“Thanks, Pete-” Harry paused, then looked over at Tony.  “-Hey, can you guys see if you can find my car?  It’s parked not far from where I was.”
He would leave such a mark here… such a stain on the pavement of their minds that would never wash clean.
“I uh- -I figured he was looking for the Green Goblin and all, but then he took off after something without calling it in, so I…  followed him.  Turns out he stalks the Midnight Racer.”
Harry had fallen asleep in the leather chair by the balcony doors again, and was just now waking up.
Pictures of each motorcycle Steve had custom painted had been on this wall.  …Did Peter still have the negatives?
“It’s all right,” Tony nodded easily, “-I’m fixing Iron Man’s armor in here, not hiding.  What’s up?”
It was haunting.  Half-foreign music with American-accented words, and suddenly Steve’s mind was churning, throwing him back to the last moment he’d seen Bucky before his grip on the plane slipped, the way rising panic had swamped the courage and irrational trust in the boy’s eyes at the last-
Tony opened his mouth, and- -stopped.  There -was- nothing he could do about a multicode chemical/metals fire once it got up to temperature, and if the Halon tanks under the stairs and a half-ton of atomized sodium chloride deploying hadn’t been enough when the fire first began, nothing short of the FDNY chemical unit or one of Susan’s air-forms
He smeared on the last of it, and wiped his face with the back of his wrist, staring at the hard design in front of him without seeing the wet, contrasting paint on his left hand.
And then it -was- over, and Steve’s forehead and nose were resting against the curve of back of his neck, and the air in the room felt suddenly cooler.
Steve’s unmasked face, focusing as he painted something detailed onto the tank of a silver-gray motorcycle.
Tony reached behind the Green Goblin’s point-eared metal mask, and felt the scratch of a catch.  He pressed it, and removed the mask, letting the monstrosity fall to the cracked pavement far below.
“Horrified at the revelation that I faked missing a decimal point in order to hire him, but otherwise just fine.”  Tony replied, with a slight smirk.
Which… was a good thing in hindsight, because getting caught breaking into a coffee machine while holding a large hockey bag containing Iron Man’s armor and the Midnight Racer’s helmet and hoverboard would have been…
“Good morning Peter,” Steve shook his head, almost laughing, “-you’re already here, you might as well come in,” he stood aside, opening the door wider.
“…What were you thinking?  What were you -trying- to do?”  Tony demanded, still shaken.  Steve was probably wearing his scale-mail and leather costume under his street clothes, but still…
Steve was -asking- him, not just slinging orders, and there was a great deal to be said for keeping your friends close and your enemies closer…
“Ya think I don’t know that?  Now get out,” Fury ordered, jerking a thumb over his shoulder at the doorway.  “-It ain’t like I don’t have -your- prints and boots on file…”
“Two of these are yours,” he said, setting them down on his sleeping bag and picking up the open carton of sweet and sour pork.
…Had that thing just jumped to light speed somehow?  Tony wondered, his eyes widening a little.  Or- -had he just witnessed the opening of a wormhole?  Why a light flash in -that- spectral range, instead of the ripple of a space/time distortion effect?
“I was there-” Tony gulped, “-and I thought you’d- -but then the army engineer- -guys, they dropped a beam, and I had to catch it, and I- -was already low on power, so I came back to- and I…”  Tony trailed off uncomfortably, and swallowed, “…yeah.”
“Web this to the back of his head or something,” Iron Man ordered, pressing the small device into his hand.
“Payment has nothing to do with it,” he said aloud, “-the armor is mine, period.  The only reason War Machine exists at all is because Morgan didn’t respect that.”
“Massive structural damage, mostly on the first and second floor levels facing the street.  I don’t know if they will hold long enough to be repaired, but they’ve all been evacuated…  and Iron Man is there trying to stabilize them now.”
“Technical journals… some books on the history of the French revolution- -those were really dry… and this set of red-covered encyclopedias that went on forever…  I saw my first set of breasts in one of those.”
Tony’s head came up, and struck the underside of a classic truck’s hood with completely unnecessary force.
Steve’s hands were at the collar of his green coveralls now, one on each side, pulling Tony down, and forwards.  -And then Steve was moving him
The pilots saw it too, and began screaming into their headsets about friendly fire, and standing down.  The jets didn’t change course.
He explored it with his fingers.  Arm… Elbow… fingers…  And deep, quiet breathing from somewhere behind him, that could only be Steve.
Steve nodded, visibly relieved, and took a breath.  He pulled the zipper of Tony’s green coveralls the rest of the way down, let go of them so they fell to mid-thigh and palmed Tony’s dick through his boxers.  Tony’s fingers tightened abruptly around Steve’s shoulders, and Steve glanced up with concern.
“Mmm, well your daddy is. Go to sleep Peter. I love you.” He stood up slowly, gently pushing Peter’s head back against his pillow.
Steve chose that moment to come and join them, frowning a little at the scene before him. His eyes were lingering on Scott, which was understandable since he was believed to have died along with everyone else after Thanos.
, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist. He’s the CEO of Stark Industries. It was his father’s company up until his death in ’91. Tony Stark only claimed the position a couple years back. The company was the top military contractor with one of the most innovative and advanced weapon production sectors out there. Now, the key word here is ‘was’. Yesterday, Stark announced that he was shutting down the weapons division immediately. This comes only two weeks after he announced he was shifting the headquarters of Stark Industries from Los Angeles to New York.” His boss paused to take a breath and stared expectantly at Steve.
“Okay, well next Sunday we’ll move in. That’s only two days away. Once he’s dropped the kid off, and there’s only two of him. This might just be our best chance yet...” Steve trailed off as suspicion crept into his mind. “Why were you so hesitant in telling me this?
The set of cold eyes travelled over to him. They didn’t light up with their normal spark as he let his eyes roam over Steve’s body, instead remaining dull and pained.
He couldn’t ignore the ache in his chest that the photo ignited, nor the sudden inspiration he felt.
Even though his vision was slowly starting to clear now, the voice was coming from beside him, and Tony wasn’t willing to risk any other sudden or major movements. If anything, the pain in his head was getting worse without the extra triggers. Therefore, he was unable to see the owner of the voice, although somewhere in his mind he thought it sounded slightly familiar. He couldn’t deny that it was comforting, and the tension he didn’t even realise was there began to bleed out of his shoulders.
Steve did give him credit, much more than he’d ever express. He would be eternally thankful to his friend who had made all of this possible. Despite Steve’s obvious obsession with finding Tony, Bucky had helped him. He’d reigned him in, backing him down from some of the crazier ideas he’d tried to implement in his attempts to get him back, and now had ultimately been the one who brought him to Steve.
Tony paused for a moment, trying to decide whether it was appropriate to bring this up. “Has your Papa ever told you about his best friend, Bucky?”
The man let out a sigh. “Stark hasn’t given any reason behind either of these moves. No one just shuts down the most profitable sector of their business without a reason.”
But that was behind him. Now, he had his Tony, safe and under his watchful gaze where he’d make sure that nothing else could hurt him. Well, that wasn’t entirely true, since the tightness of the ropes securing him to the chair he was on, was severe enough to already be causing bruising. Steve hated the thought of causing Tony any greater discomfort, but he knew that in the short-term such measures were a necessity. A little bit of pain to prevent Tony from seriously hurting himself was enough to justify this decision to Steve.
Steve turned his attention back to his friend. Bucky had managed to clean up after he’d dropped Tony off, no longer wearing the same bloodstained clothes as before. Steve was grateful, knowing the sight of Tony’s blood would only make it even harder to leave him.
Peter looked down sheepishly, but the tension in his shoulders eased a little at the change of subject.
Tony couldn’t help his eye roll. “Are you telling me that your plan is based on ‘Back to the Future’?”
Steve finally moved then, bringing his hand, which had fallen onto Tony’s shoulder, up to his forearm, trying to calm Tony’s growing panic by rubbing up and down gently. Even though it felt kind of nice, it didn’t help much, with Tony’s breath quickening and his movements growing more frantic.
“I know this is a lot to process, but please just stop fighting this. You trusted me once Tony, I need you to do so again. You just have to learn to see things my way, and then you’ll understand. You’ll be able to see that things are better this way.”
Speaking of the man, Steve’s attention was drawn to the figure who was leaning back in his chair, with his arms crossed over his chest. His expression never changed from the unamused frown that was probably the reason for the deepening lines in his forehead. The man couldn’t have been that old, but his already receding hairline and lined face were attempting to convince him otherwise.
“Not like what? What’s going on, Steve?” Tony was almost hysterical now, trying desperately to piece together different scenarios in his mind. Steve could see the confusion and the anxiety that was brewing within him, only fuelling his panic.
Bucky, upon hearing the door opening behind him, quickly stepped back and made his way over to Steve. This cleared Steve’s view, and he was finally able to make out Tony’s small form slumped over in his chair as much as his restraints would allow. The fluorescent lighting did little to hide the thinness in the man’s face, probably only making it look worse. Whilst his eyelashes were still resting gently against his cheeks, eyes closed in slumber, Steve could make out the growing signs of awareness. His head was lolling around slightly, and every now and then he’d scrunch his eyes face up and let out a little moan. If he hadn’t realised that he was probably in some kind of pain, Steve might have found the whole scene endearing. He wasn’t so naïve though, and his heart clenched at the subtle signs of discomfort, trying to bury the self-hatred he felt at being the cause of it. Whilst it was never the plan for Tony to go down the way he did, the agent really should have stuck to using the drugs he’d been given, Steve knew he had to take at least some degree of responsibility for how things had panned out.
A warm hand came up to his neck, the thumb rubbing gently across his cheek. He couldn’t help turning his face slowly into the open palm, wanting more of the soothing touch. The palm was slightly calloused, obviously a sign of hard, physical labour, but Tony only found that more calming, reminding him of a set of hands he hadn’t felt in a long time.
Tony almost melted on the spot, unable to take the utter devotion that his son so freely gave him. His adoring gaze on Tony, looking at him as if he had hung the moon and the stars. Not for the first time today, he felt he might cry, overwhelmed by the love he was experiencing.
So, Steve had really thrown himself into becoming a family man. His cooking had come a long way in the past five years. At first, they’d been surviving off microwaved meals, and sandwiches, which they’d still somehow managed to mess up. It had quickly been decided that, despite his technical expertise, Tony should steer clear of the kitchen when it came to cooking. It tended to be him that threw Steve off, with inventive ways of speeding up cooking or preparation processes. Once he’d finally wrangled control in the kitchen, Steve had been able to flourish. It had been a slow progression, but gradually he’d been branching out, trying new things. It wasn’t uncommon for him to sit down for an afternoon and flick through a cookbook, or for Tony to catch him trying to copy a cooking program that he’d recorded for himself. It was endearing, really, and the food was amazing. Tonight, Steve had gone for a pesto, chorizo and tomato dish that Tony had mentioned he’d loved the first time he’d tried it.
What he had planned for Tony wasn’t going to be pleasant. Necessary, but definitely not pleasant. As much as he hoped that Tony would be understanding of everything, and quick to get over his anger, given his track record, Steve knew that was unlikely to happen.
Steve knew that the situation was heading downhill fast. There hadn’t been much of an initial calm period like he’d been expecting. Instead, Tony had almost instantly begun to struggle against his bonds and plan a mode of escape. Steve had really been hoping that his brain wouldn’t start-up again that quickly, that he could try and subdue the man before he got too worked up, but it was clear now that his moment had passed.
Not wanting to have to repeat himself, Tony almost cried in relief at the sight of Peter running out of the front door. He launched himself at Tony, grinning widely as he was scooped up and plonked onto his lap.
“And? This isn’t exactly an uncommon occurrence. I don’t doubt your intelligence enough to believe that you think this is of any kind of importance. Why are you bringing it up?” Steve’s barely-there patience was already running out. He’d dealt with enough stupidity tonight alone, to last him the rest of his life.
He’d had help of course. It wasn’t hard to get the Avengers who had sided with him over the accords to join him, and Bucky had naturally become his second-in-command. As much as it displeased him to do so, he’d kept the name of the organisation, to ensure that those who’d previously worked for it would stay on. Not everyone had left after the collapse of SHIELD, instead remaining a bunch of separate cells that were struggling for leadership. Now though, HYDRA worked as a fully operational network, on its way to unstoppable.
“Yeah, well since it’s my first time, my boss thought it’d be best that we stick with it. Don’t want me getting too confused and losing face. Besides, it’s not that bad of a name.”
“Hey…come on, out of there. It’s dinner time, and your Papa is going to go all mother hen on us if we’re not ready.”
Tony’s jaw dropped at his son’s question, wondering just when he learnt to be so manipulative. “That’s extortion. There’s a word for you.” He stood up and walked over to his son, looking back over his shoulder a few times, at the model. “Juice pops, huh? Yeah, that’s exactly what was on my mind.” He reached out his hand for Peter to take. His son jumped up happily, grabbing the hand and dragging Tony to the kitchen. “What flavour do you want Squirt?”
Tony grinned at him and placed a kiss on his forehead before moving back into his seat. He looked back over at Steve who was just smiling at the two of them.
“Bucky, I’m not in the mood for this right now. Just let me know you’ve done what I asked you to, then you can go.”
But here they were, with the cutest little five-year-old kid around. Peter had successfully stolen both of their hearts, and despite his acceptance of the ordeal five years ago, Tony did feel some degree of comfort that there would be absolutely no way for someone to take him away from them.
As a result, he’d secretly set up cameras and alarm systems to monitor any and all activity, and to alert him of any suspicious behaviour. That’s not to mention the trackers he’d secretly installed in both of their devices, and the heightened surveillance of Peter’s activity in his suit. It had taken him a while to find a way to code it into the suit, hidden in an attempt to avoid a repeat of the situation in DC.
“Mmmm, were you looking for it?”  He asked playfully, cocking his head. The sheepish look he got in response answered that question quickly enough.
against the side of the car had Happy slamming on the breaks. Tony was thrown forward, his arms going out at the last second, managing to brace against the headrest in front of him and saving him from a broken nose. Once he’d managed to right himself, he glanced over at Happy anxiously. They were in a poorly lit area of the city, and no other car was in sight. Tony had no idea what had hit them.
The same look of resignation that Steve had given was replicated on the faces of Rhodey, Nat and Scott at those words.
“Shh…I’ve got you, sweetheart. That man won’t come near you ever again. I dealt with him the same way I’ll deal with anyone who dares to hurt you.” He cooed the words gently, before straightening up. He’d spent the past few hours doing nothing but stare at the man, and he’d continue for hours longer if he didn’t have other business to attend to. The knock on the door only made him more aware of his other responsibilities. He didn’t have to turn around to know who had entered, having called for Bucky about five minutes ago to replace him.
Tony grew more and more agitated as he continued to shout at Steve. His words were punctuated by the angry steps he took, closing the distance between the two of them.
The man who’d first attacked him now held him gently in his arms, cursing at the sight of blood running down Tony’s neck. Steve wasn’t going to like that, at all.
The hand was followed by a familiar red and gold helmet, then the rest of his son’s small body. Though Iron-Man had been decommissioned years ago, he still tinkered and messed around in his make-do workshop. Pride swelled within him as he took in the familiar pose of his son – not his by birth though, no, that ship had long since sailed. Mainly, there the whole issue of having two men and trying to decide whose genes to keep (and hadn’t that been a conversation, trying to weigh the risk of pre-serum Steve and his ailments, the fear of having a super-soldier kid, and the dread of the kid maybe, somehow, inheriting his addictive tendencies, including the alcoholism).
Steve knew he wasn't wrong in calling himself an acquired taste. Between his physical issues and his anger issues he could be a lot to deal with, something Bucky reminded him of often with affectionate quips about angry kittens. Peggy once told him the reason they didn't work out was because Steve was always itching for a fight, and she wasn't wrong. Peggy could hold her own in an argument and did so without trouble, but that didn't mean she wanted to be dragged into Steve's crusades every day, nor that she wanted to get into arguments with him whenever he got stir crazy from bed rest for whatever illness he had this time.
Tony pouts. "I want a turn. I've never flown a spaceship before." He stops. "Well, not one that wasn't crashing at the time."
"Fine. Then we'll just stay like this all tense and worried against the doctor's orders," Tony grumbles, but he doesn't seem surprised.
"Like a couple of randy teenagers? I like it," Tony said, grin growing wider and eyes flicking over Steve's face with apparent glee at Steve's embarrassment.
Tony looked at him oddly. "I hear worse from people who know nothing about me beyond newspaper headlines. Not from people I have to talk about my issues in front of."
"What is it?" Bucky peered over his shoulder. "You finally ordered some decent clothes? Jeez. Agreeing to stay out late at the club, sleeping in, not getting dressed to go on a stupid morning jog, and now this? When did the pod people arrive?"
"Depends what you count as a date," Tony says, and the eyebrow wiggle he gives prevents Steve from asking what other events might have qualified.
"Hey," Steve greets as he slides into the passenger seat. If he'd known cars could be like this, he might have actually been tempted to get his license.
"Her brother died," Steve explains. "Ultron attacked Sokovia and Pietro died. She joined us and helped us take Ultron down. She and Vision have a... had a thing."
A grimace surfaced at her demand no matter how hard he fought to remain neutral and earnest. "As you know, I don't have the best self image and I overreact when I think people are treating me differently because of my size. That was the conscious reason for my actions, however there was another reason I have only recently discovered myself. I like you. When I asked you out, I think I was actually asking you out, even if I didn't know it. My reaction at the club was more to my own feelings and actions than to yours."
And just like that the ball was back in Steve's court. He coughed a little and ignored the fact he'd completely lost his battle against blushing. "Could we, I dunno, make out for a while?"
Steve didn't say anything. It had seemed logical at the time... No, that was wrong. It had seemed... right? He'd wanted to move back in, to see if Tony would really kiss him.
His breakfast was long cold by the time he emerged wearing the new clothes, that fit disturbingly well. "There. Happy?"
It was obvious who did order them, though Steve couldn't for the life of him imagine why, or how Tony got his measurements.
The hospital is nice and neat and clean and nothing like the horror stories Steve's always heard about mental hospitals. The room the orderly shows him to is quiet and peaceful and smells a little of lemon floor cleaner. There's comfy furniture and a TV mounted on the wall.
The gauntlet is broken, which they'd known thanks to a source of knowledge Nebula refused to reveal, burned out in the surge of power Thanos' apocalypse had required, and Thanos thinks they can't fix anything without it.
"Wait, is there a single battle you remember actually winning?" Tony asks incredulously. "Did New York get levelled by Loki and the Chitauri? Did Ultron blow up Sokovia? What about that time we got a group of genuine R.O.U.S? Did they claim Central Park as their own?" He stops at the expression on Steve's face and sighs. "Sorry. Look, I don't know what we did differently to how you remember it so I can't tell you how we won. We were on a dead planet, we got the gauntlet through some grade A team work, Hulk smashed Thanos and we all went home. It was an epic battle and half the galaxy's superheroes turned up to help. You had to punch one of them out when he freaked over his girlfriend's untimely demise."
SHIELD medical looks the same as ever, as does Dr. Cho when she guides him to an examination room, Tony trailing behind. After a brief physical and a set of questions not dissimilar to those the medical staff had asked him when he'd first come out of the ice, Dr. Cho leads them into a room with a CT machine and directs Steve into it.
They find Tony in the company of a blue and purple...woman, Steve assumes, both going through engineering scraps for parts and arguing over what they should take. The owner of the scraps looks on with the occasional interjection to keep them looking and keep them stacking up parts. The blue woman glares every time he does but doesn't interject.
"I get it, I do," Tony says as Steve slowly realises that he can't think of a single thing that was better back home. "I still get nightmares about being stuck in space, or Thanos winning, or Maximoff trapping me in my own head forever more. They feel so real that when I wake up I have to have JARVIS tell me where and when I am. But they're just nightmares."
Fury waited them out, seemingly expecting an argument. "Of course, it's a little bit more complicated than that," he admits at last. "Anyone here experienced the so-called 'red mist'?"
With a final look around the scene, at the mess nothing can fix if they can't fix it together, Steve nods.
"Is that what this is?" Bucky asked. "I thought this was you whining that your crush is mad at you. Besides, I'm not coming out, I'm just more open minded than you."
"I'll load up Redskull," Steve offers, because the speculative glances Natasha and Thor are shooting his way are making him uncomfortable. Also, someone needs to load up Redskull, and Steve wouldn't feel comfortable if it wasn't him. Not that he doesn't trust the others, he just needs to make sure the villain isn't going anywhere.
"Clint. I have a dog," Clint said. "I didn't used to have a dog, then I put a guy in hospital for kicking his dog, and now I have a dog, and court mandated therapy and community service to avoid a GBH charge."
Steve resisted rolling his eyes and was glad he did, because in that split second he saw Tony's eyes dart away in an uncharacteristic display of uncertainty. "Tony, I like you. A lot. I thought I made that obvious."
When he's as close to worn out as he can ever get in this body, he leaves the mansion for a walk to clear his head. A little way in he finds himself drifting in the direction of the mental health unit and doesn't stop himself. He's held back from bringing any negativity to Bucky's door, and he still hasn't told him he isn't this world's Steve, but he needs his best friend right now.
"Just a shirt that doesn't make you look like a kid playing dress up in his dad's clothes," Bucky pointed out.
Steve is the one to drop their locked gaze at last, unable to bear the look of determination and devotion in Tony's eyes. He really does love this world's Steve.
God no. No. He can't be trapped again. Conscious this time, perhaps forever. He can't even feel his breath quicken, isn't sure he has lungs anymore. "What do you mean?" He asks, and it's really more of a plea for what he's thinking to be untrue.
Tony stirs as Steve shifts and breathes heavy from the terror of his nightmare. "Y'kay?" He murmurs, not moving his face from it's position squashed into Steve's shoulder.
"One, how do you know that? Two, how do you know that? And three, are you sure?" Tony asks. "Because it wouldn't be the first time he faked it. He's pretty good at the whole 'trick' thing, being that he is, you know, the trickster god and all."
She sighed. "He got court permission to skip this session so he could go to Europe for an important business meeting."
Steve and Natasha set off immediately to find Tony, carefully ignoring the curious and threatening looks the various aliens on board the station send their way. Natasha somehow blends in seamlessly as always, despite them being the only humans on board. Well, presumably apart from Tony. Steve on the other hand, feels more self-conscious than he has done since the serum.
The date goes well. Smoother that the other times they've gone out together, because now Steve's invested too. He's the one that asked, and he wants this to work. He wants what the other Steve, or maybe it's the old Steve, had.
Steve looks around at the distressingly few remaining members of his team as they look to him for the next move. He doesn't know. He hasn't thought about how to fix it in weeks, since he stopped entirely believing the whole thing was real. In the end, he says the only thing that makes any sense to him anymore. "We need to find Tony."
"Okay then," Fury said at last. "But if shit goes down because you're lying assholes then I will inform the courts that you violated court orders."
Bucky noticed Steve's unease and quit arguing with the bouncer to check what was going on. "You know this guy?"
"Hmm?" Steve responded, mostly because it seemed likely that would keep Tony talking in that increasingly breathless voice.
"So don't deploy me against the Maximoffs. Just let me fight with the team against the other threats," Steve says. "You can debrief me before every mission, make sure we're on the same page. I need to be out there!"
"Sure," Steve replies. It's hard to say no to Tony when he has that smile on his face, even though right now Steve would rather crawl off somewhere to panic over what he just did. It hurts a little to think that he's only found that out since being in this world. Tony back home never smiled like that.
"I think I'm in the wrong world," Steve says, because as much as he doesn't really trust Tony these days, if anyone can help him figure out what's going on it'll be Tony.
"But at the time, you and I were fighting about the usual stuff, plus me being a breakable human who shouldn't taunt terrorists and I got a little carried away in the redesign," Tony explains. "The stuff I shot up with was barely even the same virus, and it hadn't been tested. So when it started messing with my brain, I may have got a little worried about... possible dementia. Or brain damage. Or death."
After a moment of staring down at their joined hands, Tony swings his arm, rocking both their hands with the movement. "Is this you asking me on a second date?"
"I didn't mean it like that," Steve protests, but it's half hearted at best and Tony's face remains unconvinced. "What about Bucky? You said he's in hospital."
Tony sighs. "I guess you'd better." He climbs out of bed, revealing that he's wearing nothing but a pair of red silk briefs, and grabs a robe from inside the wardrobe. "I'm sorry, but I need coffee before I try to deal with," he waves his hand at Steve vaguely, "this. But I will be back and I will be a supportive husband and everything once I'm caffeinated, I swear. Do you want one?"
"We're in astral form," Strange says with a hand wave that says he doesn't feel it necessary to explain further. "Your hair is longer."
"I might bid on one or two things," Steve said. He didn't have much money to spare after his clothes shopping spree, which made him feel pretty guilty, but he was planning on at least bidding on all of the kid's paintings. He scrutinised Tony while he was eating his fruit pot. "Why are you being nice?"
Steve prepared to commence his usual dancing, but Tony pulled him in close before he could begin. He could've warned Tony that wouldn't make it any better, Peggy had tried her best to get him to dance like a normal human being and there was no reason to believe Tony would succeed where she'd failed. It did feel different, though. Tony was firmly in control, his hands wrapped tight around Steve's hips, pressing them close and guiding Steve's movements. Steve looped his arms around Tony's neck and went with it. If he ended up breaking Tony's toes or something then he wouldn't feel at all guilty, he had warned Tony after all.
"Tony," Steve warns, and it's supposed to alert the man to Steve's intention to try to take the gauntlet by force, but Tony's irritated face says he didn't take it that way.
"Tony just..." Steve didn't know how to describe the weird bubble of wealth and influence Tony lived in. Tony bought expensive gifts the way other people might by someone a drink, hooked people up with life changing opportunities because he could. Virginia wasn't the only one in group who had been on the end of Tony's networking. Steve overheard him and Bruce talking about a research position Tony swung for Bruce, and Thor's girlfriend had apparently received a large grant from Stark Industries towards her research. It wasn't anything special about Steve that made Tony throw expensive clothes at him, just Tony's impulse and ability to see a need and fulfil it. If anything, the fact he just got clothes instead of a career probably meant Tony liked him less than any of the others.
"Not yet," Virginia said over her shoulder without turning to look. She led them through to an area where they were briefly checked over by some form of security Steve wasn't entirely sure was TSA and then on to a private lounge area. "You can wait here. I'll bring Tony through once he's landed."
Steve stares at him helplessly, unable to verbalise exactly what's going on, the horror of waking up in a world he doesn't recognise for the second time striking him dumb.
Anger management group was held in a run down office building and looked like a study group when Steve peered in through the glass panel in the door.
Steve patted Bucky's shoulder and helped him back into the apartment when Bucky stumbled drunkenly over the doorstep. "She wasn't my type," he lied, because maybe she was his type but he hadn't really noticed either way.
"I doubt I need any introductions, but I'll do it anyway. I'm Tony, I'm here for punching a reporter in the face when I was drunk," Sunglasses guy said. "It wasn't the first time and I doubt it'll be the last."
"Please never use the phrase 'hot bod' again," Steve said. "And again. Airport. Big romantic scene, remember?"
Steve just shrugged. "Technically it's a second date. And while I'm..." he fought hard against the blush that threatened to erupt as he continued, determined not to make a big deal of this, "definitely interested in getting in your pants, for right now I was more talking about stuff like back at the airport."
Bucky watched him for a moment. "You're awful eager to run into a guy who was hanging all over you last time I saw you together."
Another wince. "You'll forgive me if the thought that you're some other Steve and my husband is who knows where out there in the cosmos and probably every bit as scared and weirded out as you but without me there with him is a scenario I'd rather not dwell on until we've ruled out the alternative. Besides," Tony adds. "Helen's a geneticist with medical and neurological training. If anyone can figure out if you're original flavour Steve or not, it's her."
Steve has to concede that point, though he doesn't have to let Tony know that. "Let's just get back to the album."
"Old Buckeroo doing okay?" Tony asks. He pulls away from the curb and joins the mild after lunch traffic. The question actually sounds genuine, as it always does from this Tony.
Bucky stifled a laugh. "No one's calling you a thug. You're just a little... scrappy. Learning how not to pick fights with guys three times your size isn't a bad thing."
"You've dated male supermodels, but you're attracted to me?" Steve pressed. Because the more he thought about it the less likely it seemed, for all his previous dwelling on the idea.
"Well, yeah. I mean, I'm not sure our relationship could've survived 'Honey I Built an Evil AI in the Basement Without Telling You'," Tony says, like it should be obvious.
"You?" Bucky asks. "The nightmares been giving you grief again?" He eyes Steve closely as he responds, checking for the lie.
The city around him is glaring and tall and though it shows clear signs of damage, the damage from the Tony's battle with Thanos' minion on Earth is gone, as is the damage of losing half the population.
"We know we're not together in your version of events. We know Thanos won, we know Zemo managed to hammer that wedge in good and proper. What else?" Tony continues, seemingly without needing Steve's input for now. "We'll start from the beginning. What's the first thing you remember after waking up from the ice? No. Wait. Before that. Let's start with the basics. Your parents, childhood. Stuff we can confirm is the same in both versions."
Steve glares at him but can't bring himself to divert too much attention from the taste of the dessert in his mouth. It seems such a waste to swallow. The little attention he does spare is caught up on the fondness and happiness on Tony's face as he more or less ignores his own dessert to watch Steve enjoy his. By the time Steve finishes his dessert, Tony's eaten less than half of his. Despite the lessons drummed into him by his own and Bucky's mothers both, he can't quite summon the willpower to stop staring hungrily at Tony's serving.
Redskull sits in a containment field Nebula set up, covered in Tony's nanites to prevent him from so much as scratching his nose. Steve still feels the need to look at him every other second to make sure.
Fury eyed her like he wasn't sure she was being honest, but whatever he decided he nodded for the next answer.
Steve has no rational explanation for what happens next. He goes from staring at Tony's food, to watching him raise a bite to his mouth, to staring at a small glob of chocolate on Tony's lip, to sucking the chocolate off Tony's lip so fast he suspects the cake is literally magic rather than just tasting that way. Tony's mouth is warm and tastes of the dessert mixed with just a dash of the sherry Tony's been sipping since they sat down. He kisses back without pause, seemingly unsurprised by this turn of events, though in all fairness, from his perspective as a guy who thinks Steve is his husband, it's probably not all that shocking. For Steve it's life changing. Because he likes it. A lot. The way Tony's lips are just the right level of firm, the way he moves his tongue, the way Tony's bottom lip feels between his teeth, the feel of Tony's pulse beating fast and strong beneath the fingers Steve cups around his neck.
"After?" Steve says tentatively. "I don't know if she messed with your head in my world. I never heard anything like that."
Steve wanted to argue for going and meeting him directly off the plane, but her expression stopped him. She might have a point. With three of them there waiting for him the second he stepped off the plane back from a trip he went on specifically to get away from Steve it might seem like an ambush.
"But he'll be back next week, right?" Steve asked, even as Bucky's voice in his head asked if he was really going to give up at the first hurdle. He badly wanted to tell the voice that this was real life and not one of the romcoms Steve wasn't allowed to tell people Bucky watched, he couldn't exactly run through an airport declaring his feelings, but in the end he conceded the point. "Has he left already? Is there any way I can contact him?"
Tony looked him over. "Tell me if I'm getting carried away here," he said, then leaned in even further.
"That and worse," Tony confirmed. "The issue is raised every single time I do something the board or the press or whothefuckever don't agree with. Apparently I'm a self-destructive narcissist with severe mental health issues."
That wasn't what Steve meant, but he has a feeling Strange knows that. "You can't do anything more than that?"
Fury looked very much like he wanted to roll his eye. "I find it difficult to believe that's the last thing that made you angry."
Steve's eyebrows raise, but he resists the urge to ask about that battle. They have time later. Hopefully.
"Now we all know each other, lets get to the point," Fury said once it was clear Steve was finished. "You're all here because you're out of control. This group exists so you can learn to get that control back. In here you will be truthful, you will be forthright, and you will be respectful. Because if you are not then I don't sign you off, and whatever nasty little consequence you're avoiding by being here will take effect. First thing I want you all to do is name the last thing that made you angry. Natasha, go."
Steve reacts instantly, leaping past the people on the outside of the circle to wrap his hand around Tony's where it grips the stone.  "Together," he insists even as a wide eyed Tony tries to pull away. Maybe all he can do is buy some time, let the stone destroy him first before it gets around to Tony. Maybe he can protect Tony, let himself be the conduit even as Tony has control. Or maybe he'll just die with Tony, which sounds oddly right. That either as enemies or lovers, their end comes as one. Whatever happens, he's not letting Tony do this alone.
He turned back to Tony. "I'm sorry for hurting you. I didn't mean to, but I did. I should have thought harder about what I was doing and why, and I shouldn't have treated you like that. It's all on me and I really am sorry."
"Make up?" Steve asks, monotone. He takes another bite of his breakfast. He has nothing to say to Tony until he takes him off the bench.
Tony scraped his plate clean and drained his cup of juice. "You planning on bidding or you helping out?"
"I know you're trying to be a good friend, but sometimes you just make me feel like I'm hopeless. You keep trying to set me up with people who are blatantly uninterested and then you won't just let it drop," Steve ranted. "It's like an obsession with you. What's wrong with me being single? Why are you so convinced I'll be alone forever if you don't set me up? It's not real good for my self esteem that you're so desperate to get me hooked up because you're so convinced I can't get anywhere with women by myself! I found Peggy by myself, didn't I?"
Steve tried to think past the rush of blood to his face and the way he felt a little dizzy. Had Tony been hitting on him? "You were hitting on me?"
Watching Tony guide the kids through how to connect things safely, how to attach the limbs and power source, what kind of personalisations they could make, and telling them stories about robots he'd made himself was a whole other experience to the one Steve had anticipated.
It wasn't that he was always angry or that he didn't realise he overreacted sometimes, although he usually only admitted to it when Peggy was giving him unimpressed looks over her first aid kit, it was more that he didn't know how to turn it off. Counting to ten didn't work, neither did the breathing exercises his mother always used to try to get him to use. When he got angry, he got angry. His only options were to express that anger or try to get away from its cause before he could snap. It wasn't always hitting things either. He shuddered at the thought of how much worse that would be. Usually it was just a whole lot of mouthing off, occasionally escalating when the other person (or people) had a temper of their own.
"Sure," Hill says, the tiniest seed of doubt in her voice. "Use it wisely, he can and will block you from calling it if you piss him off."
"Steve," Tony says, leaning in, trying to get eye contact again. "Hey, it's okay. I'm not... I'm not expecting you to be on board with this, us, when you don't remember any of it. I know things are rough the way you remember them. We'll go slow. I'll remind you why we're together, but I won't push."
Steve thinks it over. He's tired and really doesn't feel like watching a movie, but on the other hand the thought of going to bed on his own and leaving behind the only comfort he has isn't appealing.
"Not really," Steve admits. "But I know this isn't where I'm from. I think the differences start after the Battle of New York. Or a little after. When I came back after travelling."
"Then hand it over," Tony says casually, like this isn't the being who recently stabbed him through the middle and murdered innumerable people. "What have you got to lose if we can't do anything with it?"
"Hey, Steve," Tony said, taking off the sunglasses he was still wearing for some reason even though it was ten o'clock at night. "Didn't picture this as your scene." He stopped, seemingly ignoring the sudden crowd of people trying to get in close, taking pictures and a couple even asking for autographs.
"We're waiting on Bruce," Tony says, slowly, like he's repeating himself to a particularly dense person. "He's running late. Should be here soon."
Steve felt his face twist up in confusion. "I can't work out if that's supposed to be a compliment or not."
They entered through the VIP gate and Steve became very aware that Bucky would likely be waking him up with another paper with his picture on it in the morning. Tony bought them both a drink and nodded to the dancefloor. "I'll get you out on there later, but how about we head to the VIP lounge for a bit first?"
Tony tilted his head. "They are people, you know. And like most people they have tastes, not some generic ideal that applies across the board. Sure, not everyone is attracted to all body types, but all body types are attractive to someone."
The doorbell rang fifteen minutes later and Steve left to find Tony waiting outside with an expensive car. Tony gestured him into the back seat and followed him in. "This is Happy." He nodded towards the front and the driver smiled into the rearview mirror.
"We think she's actually in the stone," Tony adds. "That's how the sacrifice works. Her..." he pulls a face, "soul is sort of interfaced with it."
"It transported him," Nebula corrects. "I heard the story from Thanos after he retrieved the soulstone for himself, of the wraith with red skin who protected the stone. Iron Man told me who he was when we discussed it."
Tony makes a strangled noise and pulls his face free of the pillow. "Really. I'm starting to enjoy this too much. I know I said I'd take it slow, and no pressure and everything, but there are aspects of this that are beyond my control."
"Why did I marry him?" Steve asks aloud, because in all their conversations over the last few months it's become very apparent that a staple for conversation for this world's Steve and Bucky is complaining or gushing about Tony by turns.
"Did they really say you should be sectioned?" Steve asked. He wasn't really sure who 'they' were, and maybe they had good reasons for wanting Tony to get help with his mental health, but it did seem a little harsh. For all that Tony could be an asshole he seemed relatively stable and he had a point with the war vet equivalency.
It takes far more convincing to get Pepper to give up access to FRIDAY so they actually have a way to track him down once they're up there. In the end it's Thor who manages it, Pepper having refused to even speak to Natasha, and only talking to Steve long enough to tell him the whole thing is his fault. She doesn't have any reason to dislike Thor, and like the majority of the galaxy, she's easily charmed by him.
"There are other tests Dr. Cho can perform, and I myself would like to examine your aura," Strange says.
"It seemed kinda... I dunno, mean, to build a suit to take the guy down and not give him access. Like I was ganging up on him or something," Tony says.
"Captain," Hill's voice comes clear and steady through the line. "We got an alert that you're back in New York. Did you enjoy your vacation?"
Tony finds him in the kitchen at breakfast the next day, looking drained and a little sheepish. "You didn't come make up before bed. I forgot you didn't know we do that."
"Seriously, she thought you were cute, you had it in the bag if you'd actually opened your mouth," Bucky ranted. "I thought you wanted to meet girls? Stevie, you can't get girls to like you if you don't talk to them!"
The next time Steve wakes up cold and alone from a nightmare, he doesn't have the willpower to stop himself going to Tony. If he has to live in this world for now, then he might as well soak up the benefits, right? Besides, it's not like Tony's made a single move on him since he's been here. It can be platonic. Like last time he shared Tony's bed and comfort.
"Nebula's sister?" Steve asks, though there isn't really anyone else it could be. "I guess you really are in the stone."
"Let's go over the obvious bad stuff. Compare the damage," Tony suggests. "Who's dead in your world that isn't here, and vice versa. Not a comprehensive list, that'd be pretty impossible what with the Thanos thing, but people you know."
"Seemed like the thing to do," Tony agrees. "Each suit even has a different list. Pepper can pilot all of them, of course."
The next session was worse. Tony seemed to be deliberately picking on Steve this time, even though he never spoke directly to him. Fury shot the occasional glare when things get out of hand, but mostly just let it slide.
The VIP lounge was nowhere near as glamorous as Steve was expecting. Sure, it was relatively private and there were comfy sofas and mood lighting, but it didn't ooze wealth and privilege. It was just a comfy spot to escape from the crowds. Steve took a seat on one of the sofas and Tony followed, sitting close enough that he was pressed against Steve's side despite the abundance of available space.
Tony pulled away altogether, which was pretty much the opposite of what Steve had intended. "Steve."
Peggy, as the only one of them that currently had a steady job, paid the cab driver and they headed inside. In open display of her British upbringing, Peggy immediately switched on the electric kettle she'd made them buy years ago and got out the teabags. Apparently the English way to deal with any problem is to make a cup of tea. Occasionally Peggy made coffee instead.
"Starting on my left, introduce yourselves," Fury commanded. "I would like to take this time to remind you that I am here because I have been where you have been. If you fuck with me I may well go back there, and believe me ladies and gentlemen, that is not something you want to see."
The strangest part of it all is that he really does feel married to Tony now, but Tony hasn't touched him since the chocolate cake incident. For the last few months it's all been plausibly platonic near-cuddling, supportive words and no-pressure flirting. He sometimes wonders if Tony resents it, or if he's really as okay with it all as he seems. Maybe it's something in the middle. But Tony never lets on if he's frustrated or angry or upset that his physical relationship with his husband has all but disappeared. Instead he laughs at Steve's slip ups, sits quietly with him after his nightmares, and teases him over just about everything. It's not the intense, love-hate, fight and fuck thing Steve had half expected when he first woke up to find himself married to Tony Stark.
Steve looks up. Strange had said something similar before, and even Thor had speculated on the motive as being important.
Steve hesitated just past the door to the apartment. It wasn't that he was ashamed of his place, or even that he thought Tony would care how big it was or what the furniture was like. It was more that the apartment was...personal. Bucky didn't even bring conquests back there. But Steve was fast beginning to realise any rules he lived by before had no place in a relationship with Tony. He stepped in and turned on the lights.
"The hospital, why's he in the hospital?" Steve asks, though any reason for hospitalisation has to be better than what actually happened. Every time Steve gets Bucky back he loses him again.
Tony nods. "Maybe it isn't. I mean, from my perspective, this is all real and I'm real. But from yours, how do you know this isn't some weird coma dream?"
"Something like that," Steve said. He had a feeling it was his fault for all his low self-esteem fuelled angsting as a teen. He may have said a few times that he thought he'd never find anyone who wanted him. At the time it was true, his teens years weren't fun, but now? He wasn't in the healthiest place when it came to self-esteem, but he wasn't that bad. Dating Peggy had helped a lot in that regard, as had finding purpose in art school and his volunteering. He might never be at ease with the way he looked, but he liked himself now.
"What if it is a memory thing, but I never get the right memories back?" Steve asks while Tony dishes out a meal Tony apparently learned to cook from his husband. He's been thinking about that. Not because he thinks it's true, but because he wants to know how this Tony would react to that.
A twitch at the corner of Tony's mouth that somehow throws bitterness and sarcastic sympathy across the room. "Barnes was among the less fortunate half of the population, right?"
Both Tony and Natasha give him surprised looks at that, and he tries not to feel offended. It's not like he never asked for opinions or options. He was team captain before, he had to have the final say, that didn't mean he didn't listen.
So Steve gives an overview. His illnesses, his parents names and occupations, his mother's death, meeting Bucky, his school career. As far as they can tell there's nothing different there, so they move on to the war. His attempts at joining up, Project Rebirth, the Star Spangled Man performances, the Howlies, Bucky's fall, Peggy, Redskull.
"I..." He looks at Tony. You've got your memories back. He hasn't skipped over those months, he just lived them out of order. "You were right."
"As long as you picture me there with you," Tony said with a wink. He was doing a lot of those lately, and Steve had to tell himself it was weird and not oddly charming.
"I dunno, I mean I am crazy hot," Tony joked. "I wouldn't blame you for pulling out all the stops to land this."
Steve spends the time milling about the mansion trying to orient himself. He finds the kitchen, a couple of bathrooms, a number of spare bedrooms and rooms he can't even guess at the function of. By the time he's grabbed a bowl of cereal and found the gym, JARVIS tells him Dr. Cho is in the city and will be ready for him at SHIELD medical within thirty minutes.
"It's not that I don't believe you, I just think we should wait for Helen before we go calling in the cavalry." Tony climbs back into bed. "And I wasn't lying about waiting it out."
Steve blinked. He had no idea where Thor was from, but wherever it was they must learn English from very old textbooks. He straightened as the rest of the group turned to him. "I'm Steve," he managed through a suddenly dry throat. "I pick a lot of fights, and it's affecting my life and relationships." He didn't mention the part where he had to be here by order of the court. Even though others already had, it was somehow even more embarrassing to admit than the fact his anger caused Peggy to leave him.
"No. You know what? I don't have to deal with this. I've got my own shit going on, it's not my job to fix your issues," Tony snapped.
Tony shrugs. "Not particularly, but I have to have fun somehow. Especially seeing as I'm not allowed to fly the spaceship. Which is so mean, by the way. I am totally capable of piloting this thing and you won't even let me try."
Virginia came back from the coffee machine and sighed at something about her phone. Fury had yet to get her to stay off it for more than fifteen minutes at a time. "Tony, stop flirting for two seconds and tell me who this guy is and if we want his investment."
Steve doesn't so much give up as accept that, for now at least, he's run out of avenues to explore. Either he really does belong in this world, or he's stuck here indefinitely anyway, so he decides to live the life he currently has. He's done it before, when he woke up decades into the future. Maybe he can carve out his own corner in this world, too, after all, most of the hard work has already been done for him.
Tony shakes his head and spears another bite of dessert. "It's fine. Sure, you got my hopes up a little there, but I got to make out with Captain America, a person doesn't complain about that."
"So, why would he do that?" Bucky asked. "He only knows you from your group stuff, that barely merits him acknowledging your existence when running into you, let alone getting you into a club, getting right up close and personal to talk in your ear and then buying you expensive gifts."
"The Hulkbuster suit," Steve explains. "He's been using it since he's been having... issues summoning the other guy."
Fury looked ready to press her on the details, but the guy with the dirty blond hair started his own introduction before Fury could do more than open his mouth.
"Several reasons," Tony said. "First being that I realised I goaded you on a little bit after the comment about me making you angry. Second being it's hard to stay mad at a face that pretty. And third that Thor said you were cool and I like Thor."
Steve laughed. He looked down at the remainder of his drink and thought 'what the hell'. He threw back the last of his drink and stood up to join Tony. "Don't say I didn't warn you."
Rocket manages to finagle his ship's sensors to accept input from FRIDAY, who he actually seems to like, and together with knowledge of where a guy called Starlord had thought Thanos would be headed to before the final battle they manage to find Tony.
Bruce raised his hand, then looked around nervously and dropped it again. "I get out of control. It's like I can't think straight."
, is the entrepreneurial spirit of the city of New York in action,” Tony said, adding the electric bill to the top of the pile, “-check the company names and dates against that list of bills you remember paying before the garage burned.”
A sheet of heavy, translucent plastic was stretched across the jagged hole in the middle of the roll-down garage door.  From inside, Steve heard the hard-edged whine of a circular saw slicing through sheet-metal.
The scratch-built Mark III had been the first suit that was really as dangerous to his enemies as it was to himself, and he still had it in storage, repaired and re-sealed after his near-disastrous battle with the Black Knight over an airship moored above the East River.
“What were you building?”  Peter asked curiously, tapping the stack of bills from the parts and materials companies.
Steve’s eyes took in the office swivel-chair out in the middle of the oil-stained concrete floor, and the pieces of Tony’s red and gold armor scattered on the ground by the pulled-out jukebox.  He smelled whiskey, and without looking, Steve knew that there would be nothing wrong with the garage door.
When he got up three hours later to refresh his cup of coffee, Tony glanced into the pan out of morbid curiosity.  There was some left…
…Without saluting, Steve noted.  Either he’d finally managed to rattle the man, or it -had- been an affectation on War Machine’s part.
Several of Mary Jane Watson dressed as Shakespeare’s Juliet, and one candid shot of her sitting on the grass in front of the school with a sandwich poised in one hand, studying a small book that lay open in her lap.
“President Nixon… -what?”  He stared, waking up fast, “-suspension of all U.S. offensive action in North Viet- …oh my god.”  Tony broke off, and swallowed.
Steve looked down at his right hand.  Balanced, strong, capable.  He’d worked out that morning at the Avengers gym, and he could feel the difference that made, the way the fibers that held his hand together inside were just a little looser, a little more awake.  That didn’t happen automatically.  Hank didn’t use half of what he had.
Steve borrowed Tony’s right-angle ruler from the long folding table that had mysteriously appeared in the far corner of the kitchen, picking it carefully out of a gleaming array of disassembled hoverboard parts.
by her after returning early from MIT to take over Stark Industries, but they hadn’t happened then either, because even as a debutante, Jan had had more sense.
Tony shut his eyes and felt the light, smooth bodies ricochet softly off his right cheek and fly off.
Steve, in Tony’s considered opinion, wore far too many layers of clothing.  When attacked like a wrapped Christmas present however, those layers yielded.
“I’m doing my best, Spider,” Tony assured him, slightly touched but mostly just annoyed by the remark.
The fire could be seen for miles.  It wasn’t big, but -damn- it was bright, cooking off white-hot in the center of a block the first explosion had plunged into darkness.
Quicksilver ran over to read the record’s label momentarily, sniffed dismissively, then vanished elsewhere without comment, satisfied that no-one had purloined one of his records.
“That’s how many repulsor disks I’ve gone through,” Tony replied, without looking up from the paperwork strewn across his battered brown desk.
“W- not that I know of.  Most of the imagery is from a fantasy novel.  …I just wanted to play you something where the good guys didn’t get screwed,” Tony grinned.
“You missed your callin’, Rogers,” Fury said grudgingly, biting his cigar again, “-but you do realize you just handed this country a PR nightmare, right?”
They exited the chopper one by one, half the often-disavowed New York hero underground called out and mobilized in this, the East Coast’s darkest hour.
Tony sank down against him skin to skin and sighed shakily, off-balance and feet still half-tangled in his loose coveralls.  He was partly hard again and Steve wasn’t, but
He was also perfectly willing to inject his girlfriend’s back and forehead with untested biochemically reactive cells from an entirely different
Tony sighed, smirked without much humor, and collected his helmet from behind the wheel of a white Jeep, keeping his face shielded in case there were other cameras.
Two minutes later he had the machine open, and had tracked the problem down to a clogged freshwater intake line.  Lime scale in a water pipe somewhere between here and the water tower on the roof, probably.  Tony shut off the main water valve, cleared the line, turned the water valve back on, grabbed a quarter to replace the one he’d put in earlier, and closed the machine up.
Peter sighed philosophically, and bent down to dig through the small compartment of his backpack, ignoring them.
Tony paused, spray bottle in hand, staring at his helmet.  It had gone back to playing static again, but- -True Blue?
A softly glowing yellow-white triangle appeared in the shadows off to his left, followed by the faint whirr of the armor powering back up.
Peter slit the top of the envelope with an unused butter knife, and unfolded the stapled white sheets inside.
More tools would be nice.  He could have asked War Machine.  No, no way in hell, it would be an insult if that question succeeded.  Hell, the tools would probably be bugged.  He would have to microwave them to be sure.  Probably kill the microwave, and oh yeah, Steve didn’t plan on getting one.  What if microwaving didn’t do the trick?  What kind of metal circuitry would survive being -  Crystal.  Crystal grown or glass poured around breadboard-style conductive pathway striping… like a clear breadboard.  …A circuit that was designed to melt while in use.  God, what would the
Steve reached up, fingers tracing the skin around the base of the covered arc reactor in a smooth caress.  He touched a brief constellation of small, irregular scars, almost lost against the more obvious details of Tony’s chest.  The way the upper and lower muscles didn’t shelve so much as blend and layer together.  The hard symmetry of the latex-covered arc itself, and the pale blue glow within, cold and clean like the light of a star.  Small tan nipples- -Steve brushed one firmly with his thumb- -that he’d somehow expected to be darker…
The two impressions, the two sets of possibilities in his mind warred for a moment.  Steve had come over, that was obvious.  But he’d had to do one of those horrible re-starts, and then gotten drunk, how…
“Its ten and a half pounds, without the straps,” Steve countered, not quite laughing against his ear.
Tony sat back down on the smooth concrete floor beside the jukebox, and leaned his head back against the dented wall, shutting his eyes for a moment.
“Why don’t you catch a couple hours’ sleep down here, and I’ll wake you up in time for breakfast?”  Tony offered.
“Actually, that wasn’t what I had in mind.  …But that means people have asked you if they could use your shield for obscene target practice before, doesn’t it?”
To enjoy the feel of her, and the scent of her body reawakening, beneath whatever the hotel used that smelled like dry roses.
him, even if it were possible…) and yanking the cube out of the wall after him by the still-attached webline.
Tony fired his bootjets and took off straight into it, tracking the signal from Peter’s Spider-comm. in his peripheral vision.  The kid could outrun a police cruiser when he really got swinging, and the next fire wasn’t far away.
Peter took a black pen out of his backpack, and began drawing a bold strike-through across each duplicate bill.  Tony watched approvingly out of the corner of his eye for the first two, then started opening his personal mail.
Steve saluted him back solemnly, wondering for the first time just how many of the people who saluted him in this modern age did so simply to put him off his guard.
“Uh-!”  It caught Steve fairly in the ribs, and he reacted equally fast, locking Tony’s left arm with his left hand, and catching Tony’s right wrist in his other one.
He thought next of the air show at which he’d first seen the Thunderbirds, and the way the mighty roar of the F-84F Thunderstreaks’ jet engines had drowned out the music of the band, the shimmer of the sun on hot black tarmac, the scent of freshly-made caramel-popcorn…  leaving only the feel of the wind against his face.
Rhodey.  A flash of white teeth in the shadows off to his left during night missions, and a deep, cool voice in his headset when things got hot.  Laughter, and bets won and lost, and something about taking an empty bottle to his copilot’s forehead when Rhodey brought up a subject he didn’t want to talk about one too many times, and being punched unconscious for it.  Long limbs, and flat, hard muscle that could stay still for hours if the story was good enough.  Hauling the man back from a knife-fight in a Saigon club, and feeling the dangerous pulse of rage under his hands.  The glint of the pipe in Rhodey’s hand, and himself yelling over his shoulder at the young Vietnamese man with the knife in his own language, hoping he’d gotten the phrasing right…
Ironically, it had been Steve that had to convince Bucky when he first set forth his plan. His friend had been reluctant to rebuild the organisation that spent so long torturing and manipulating him. Steve felt the same way but recognised the opportunity they had to begin their mission with a whole network already set-up. Of course, they’d had to spend more than a year asserting their leadership, and culling those who disagreed, but where they were now justified the use of the HYDRA branding.
Tony was silent at his words, a thoughtful look coming over his face. The hurt was still clear in his eyes, but Steve knew that it would take more than a few words to erase that.
Tony scoffed and began to claw at the bandage on his arm. Once successful in getting it off, he hastily yanked out the needle that had been secured underneath it. “Anything I can give you? Nope, nada, zip. I have nothing for you, Steve. No location, no clues, no trust. You’re a liar.”
Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Steve come out of his trance, his eyes widening a little at the sudden shout. His eyes drifted over to the two of them, his expression softening fondly at the scene.
“Tony, I think this is a conversation for another time…you need to sit back down.” Tony rolled his shoulders back angrily at being told what to do. “Were there any clues at all that you could give us? Anything to help?”
Tony tried to shrug the hand off his shoulder, realising that he wasn’t going to get any help from Steve. Looking around quickly, Tony began to assess his surroundings. On the assumption that Steve wouldn’t impede his escape, even if he refused to aid it, there didn’t seem to be anyone else in the room that would stop him. A blinking red light in two of the ceiling corners indicated that someone was probably watching them, but they didn’t seem to have an audio recording component to them. That was good. The finger-print activated lock on the door was not so good, so he was going to have to find a way around that. The wall beside him had a long mirror covering its top half, presumably a two-way glass installation – one that Tony thought was unnecessary considering the cameras but that really wasn’t important right now. What
Tony smiled gently at the head that had found its way into his lap on the long journey back from the compound. They’d really gone hard this weekend, upping the compound security and developing the kid’s suit. After the break-in on Friday night, it only became clearer to Tony that someone was after him. Someone who may or may not be from an organisation that Tony had been sure had fallen when SHIELD had. He feared that the attacks wouldn’t stop at him, so he was putting everything he could into making sure the boy was safe. That involved long days in the workshop, and only a few hours’ sleep scattered across the two days. Tony knew he was pushing the boy, but Peter never complained. Obviously, though, him falling asleep twenty minutes into the car ride was a sign that maybe he’d worked the kid a little bit too hard.
Steve eyed his arms wearily, acknowledging the fact that Tony was probably starting to rub them raw with all of his struggling. He hated how tight they had to be, but Tony was proving exactly why that had to be the case. He knew never to underestimate the capabilities of one Tony Stark, even if it meant short-term harm. He’d have to remind himself later to get him some balm though because he’d be feeling those burns tomorrow – and probably for the rest of the week too.
Sam just chuckled and shook his head. “You know you can always hitch a ride with me in the morning, right?”
Bucky sighed before continuing. “They’re developing a routine, one that’s not hard to follow. The kid gets picked up by Happy every Friday after school and is dropped home at the same time every Sunday evening.” It said enough about the comfort of the relationship that Tony was foolish enough to be so predictable, but Steve hadn’t been informed of quite how obvious he’d been acting. “Stark’s been with him each ride for the past six weeks, and it’s only him, the kid and Happy. He isn’t bringing a suit either, well not a full one anyway. This is the most exposed we’ve seen him.”
It was a small, black and white photo that was severely wrinkled, but the subject was unmistakable. The youthful gaze of one James Buchanan Barnes met the camera, a small smile playing on his lips. A feeling of guilt swelled in Tony’s stomach as he noticed the pained expression on Steve’s face. Although they’d agreed not to talk about him, Tony knew that Steve often thought about his best friend and how he’d lost him so suddenly after he’d finally managed to get him back.
wasn’t exactly a common occurrence, and he knew half of them were probably expecting him to come back from the meeting without a job. Steve tried to ignore the sheen of sweat that was starting to coat his palms, making him even more uncomfortable than he already was. He had the same fear but tried to quell it by telling himself that if the man wanted him fired, he was unlikely to let a crowded room stop him and would have done it on the spot. Maybe.
“I would have made a grave mistake hiring you if you were going to turn down the biggest opportunity of your career. Take the rest of the day off. We’ll publish what you wrote here, not whatever you’ve tried to replace it with.”
Only Steve didn’t move. His brows furrowed, and he gave Tony a strange look of pity, but he didn’t move to help him out of his restraints. He didn’t so much as flinch either, which set off a little warning somewhere in the back of his mind.
“That’s not gonna happen, Buck. But we will step it up this time. I’m putting you in charge of bringing him in. No one else needs to get hurt, but you were right. He’ll know about HYDRA, and knowing Tony, it won’t be long before he runs his mouth. The risk of waiting is too high.”
“No, you’re not the man I knew back then. Him, I could trust. But you…yeah well, that’s just not going to happen.”
“This is more practical, Soldier. I would have had to be much more precise with the needle in order…” The man drifted off as Bucky sent him a glare. He’d overstepped his place, but he didn’t have to be told that.
Steve turned away from his boss’s prying eyes, only to realise that almost every other worker in the room was blatantly staring at him. The guy two desks over sniggered at him, but most others seemed to have the decency not to take joy in his discomfort. Yeah, getting abruptly called into the boss’s office for anything remotely
Most importantly, at that moment, however, was the fact that Steve was unrestrained and had the ability to move around freely. That was probably down to his super strength, even though Tony couldn’t make out any other chairs that he might have been bound to. If he’d been in the right mindset, that might have been a cause of concern – because why would someone be stupid enough to leave quite probably the strongest man on the planet without proper restraints – but Tony was too focused on the desperation he felt towards getting out of the room he was trapped in, and getting rid of the ropes that were blistering his skin.
Steve knew exactly what he was implying. “Why wasn’t I informed as soon as we realised this was happening, that we could know exactly where he was going to be at an exact time?”
“Yeah, Buck, you did.” Steve came closer and grasped his friend’s good shoulder in a silent thanks. They exchanged a small smile at the old gesture, one they’d been doing since they were back in Brooklyn – although Steve had never quite been able to comfortably reach his friend’s shoulder at that time – before stepping away from each other.
So, Steve knew it was only a matter of time before Tony started to present a more serious threat. Best to get in early and stop the resistance before it got much further. No doubt Tony would be the head of it, so Steve hoped that by stopping him, he’d be stopping any opposition altogether. He knew that Tony was still unaware of his, and the ex-Avengers’, role in the slow takeover, but again, he knew that wouldn’t remain the case forever. Therefore, he’d spent the past four months trying to get his hands on the man, but either Tony was proving too smart, or maybe Steve’s men were just incompetent. It was probably a mix of the two, but Steve was beginning to realise that he was going to have to step up his efforts. All these failed attempts had only made Tony more aware of the target on his back.
A hearty chuckle had his eyes widening from their drooped position. He’d almost forgotten about his situation, but looking down, he took in the ropes wound tightly around his arms and around his torso, fastening him to an uncomfortable wooden chair. There were similar restraints around his lower shins. The sight snapped him out of his stupor, his head moving away from the warm touch reluctantly. He silently reprimanded himself for such wanton behaviour in his current dilemma. He needed to focus on getting out of here. His arms tensed, testing out the strength of the ropes by pulling roughly against them. Though he was more aware of his surroundings, he was still swamped by confusion that was increasing his panic.
Steve was sitting quietly in his small art studio. It was actually just the attic that had been stripped and converted, giving Steve his own little space in the house. They’d replaced the roofing with large windows, allowing streams of light to pour into the room all day long. At night time, it gave an amazing view of the stars above. Although Steve constantly tried to stop him, Peter could often be found trying to sneak up here at night to catch a glimpse of them.
On the other side of the door stood a sharp-looking female agent, her gaze carefully lowered as she held out what he’d called her up for. Steve silently thanked the agent for her demeanour, not knowing if he would have been able to deal with any further insolence that day. Wordlessly he grabbed the syringe out of her hands and turned back into the room. He faintly heard her measured footsteps disappearing down the hall as the door fell shut. He made a mental note to find out who the agent was, to keep an eye on her and check her potential.
“He’s been getting more restless over the past hour or so. Only now, he’s getting louder. Figured you wouldn’t want to be waiting any longer.”
“You write a lot more eloquently then you speak, that’s for sure.” Steve let out a forced laugh. “Look, I’m in need of an unknown face to do an investigative piece for me. And I’m not just talking a week-long project here either. This thing’s gonna take time and dedication and judging by the work you submitted earlier this week, I thought you might be the guy for it, if you are interested of course.”
“Yeah yeah, not my fault you’re willing to suffer through what has got to be the worst coffee in the whole of New York…” Steve trailed off as he noticed the glare that the barista had directed his way. Oh well, not his fault the guy had no idea how to brew a decent coffee. “Anyway, I’m only here because the subway was so busy when I left this morning. It took me four trains until I was able to even stand in one of the stupid things. Who would have thought that sleeping in 10 minutes was going to cause such a mess for me?”
“Now get back out there, you have an organisation to run. Tony will be safe, and I’ll make sure you get back here before he wakes up.”
Of course, though, the ever-present thorn in his side was forcing its way up again. Steve had tried to ignore the man, and his feelings for him, for the sake of his quest, but Tony Stark was becoming suspicious. Steve was almost impressed that he was starting to catch on, but his concern over the potential countermeasures he was starting to take was forcing his hand. By keeping tabs on the man over the two years since the whole Accords debacle, he’d taken note of the small force of individuals he was rounding up. On top of that, he’d only been showing just a little bit too much interest in foreign elections and politics for Steve to ignore.
Taking his gaze from Steve, and over to Peter, he felt his frown instantly evaporate. Peter was awkwardly seated in his chair – one that Tony had made a little bit higher than the others so that he could reach the table properly. He was stabbing clumsily at the strings of spaghetti in his plastic bowl, a look of serious concentration on his face. The expression involved his tongue poking slightly out of the corner of his mouth. As pieces continued to fall off his fork, he growled angrily, his stabbing becoming more insistent. His cheeks had smatterings of the tomato sauce, as did the front of his shirt. Maybe they’d have to bring the bibs back for the messier foods.
He couldn’t place a single one of his injuries, and whenever he tried the pain only intensified. The last thing he remembered was dropping Peter back at his apartment after a long weekend at the compound. He was pretty certain of the memories that were telling him that Peter had gotten home fine, an image of him running up to the entrance of the building with a giddy smile on his face. But if that was the case, Tony couldn’t place the events that could have led him into his current situation.
He’d just finished explaining to Sam what had gone down in his boss’s office, with the whole article proposal and whatnot. Even now, explaining what had happened, Steve found himself in a state of disbelief.
“Good, everyone needs to know that I won’t be accepting anymore failure. Tonight was a mess. Anyway, since that’s everything taken care of, I guess I’ll see you tomorrow.”
Tony knew what he meant. They both knew how important it would be, if they had any chance at success, to offer their services. But the potential implications were cause for their hesitance.
“Stop fucking with me, Steve! I know we’re not exactly in a good place right now, but we can talk about that once we’re out of here.” When all he received was silence and more pitying looks, Tony gulped anxiously. “Steve, please. You don’t understand. Someone’s been after me for months now. I don’t know what their endgame is, but it can’t be anything good. Please, just help me out of here.”
Steve stood up at that, finally moving out of his squatted position. Though it didn’t happen often, he could feel his muscles cramping from an extending time in the crouch. As happy as he was to have Tony back with him, the whole situation was physically and mentally draining him. He could feel all of his patience slipping away, and he felt moments away from snapping. That wasn’t something that he wanted Tony to see. He’d probably only hurt him and make him resent him only further. At this point, anyway, they were probably only going to go in circles with Steve trying to convince Tony and Tony blatantly refusing to see reason. He turned his back on the man and tapped a few buttons on the band that wrapped around his wrist.
Subconsciously, Tony let a hand run through the messy pile of curls that obstructed his view of the boy’s face. After the whole moving-day disaster, Tony had really taken to the boy and increased his role in Peter’s life. Despite his Aunt’s slight reluctance, he had him over at the compound every weekend, and usually quite frequently throughout the holidays as well. Last summer had involved a period of three weeks straight at the compound, where Peter was being trained during the morning, before working with Tony in the afternoon. He’d grown closer to Peter, to the point where he couldn’t really imagine his life without him. And a part of him, though he was hesitant to acknowledge it, knew that the boy felt the same way about him. His Aunt had said as much and continuously thanked Tony for stepping up as a father figure in Peter’s life, even if it meant that she had to take a step back.
As he made eye contact with a startlingly familiar set of brown eyes, Tony forgot to take note of the rest of his surroundings. He failed to realise that the two of them weren’t alone, missing the figure that cautiously snuck up behind him. He raised his hand for another hit, hoping to knock the man unconscious, but never had the chance to fire. All he saw was the slight spark in the man’s eyes before a heavy weight came down onto the back of his head. His limp body fell forwards but was caught before he could hit the ground.
Slowly, heavy lids opened to reveal Peter’s soft brown eyes. He turned his head towards Tony, looking up from under his curls, his nose scrunched up in confusion. “M’s’er St’rk?”
This time, upon hearing the same voice, Tony felt a dawning realisation. That voice was way too familiar this time for him to brush it off. It was still as calming as before, but a bit deeper and huskier than the one in his memories. Turning ever so gently towards the voice, Tony managed to catch a glimpse of its source. Almost instantly, he felt his breath carried away from him, and an immense relief sweep through his body.
“Well, how about I tell you a story about how he sacrificed himself to help your Papa take down the bad guys? Like a true hero.”
“The garage,” Peter responded as if it was obvious. Well, yes, he probably had gotten it out of the garage, but Tony had long since stopped leaving anything remotely valuable or dangerous in plain sight, or within reaching distance of his overly curious child.
Steve heard the words but remained where he was, staring adoringly down at Tony. Even the way his hair had grown out and was now slightly tousled around his forehead had Steve’s protectiveness growing stronger. Tony was meant to be innocent; he’d have to keep him away from the business side of things to maintain that. Leaving him in the care of another, even if it was his most trusted companion was frightening though, almost to the point where Steve never wanted to let Tony out of his sight.
“Hey, I’m sure you’ll be fine. Besides, it’s Friday, so you’ll have the weekend to cool off before you have to come back here. We still on for the game tonight?”
After an overly excited bath time, that ended with Tony soaked from head to toe – yet somehow Steve had managed to avoid all of the splashing – they’d finally managed to produce a clean Peter. They’d come to the agreement that Steve would put him to bed, whilst Tony now had to have another shower. He made his way slowly over to the master bedroom but paused at the soft sound of Steve’s voice echoing from the room to his left. Peering quietly through the open door, he took in the sight of Steve sitting at the foot of their son’s bed, running his hand through Peter’s hair.
“Yeah, see you then, Peter,” Tony whispered happily as he waited until Peter was inside before telling Happy to start the drive back.
Bucky weighed up his options, before finally speaking. “Stark’s was spotted last Sunday with that boy again, the one from Queens. He was dropping him off at his apartment block on the quieter side of town.”
“Yeah, I mean I am just as surprised as you are, but they said they wanted someone unknown. Expectedly, Stark has been increasingly sceptical of new people who come into his life. Come Monday though, I’ll be Steven Montgomery, Tony Stark’s new security detail.”
His boss didn’t seem amused at being interrupted like that. “Hmmm…well that’s a shame really.” Steve’s eyebrows shot up at that. The man ruffled through some of the papers on his desk, before pulling one from a large pile. “I quite liked this piece as it was. You did your research, beyond the simple scope of the brief and produced something actually worth reading. A lot of effort for a one-off article buried in a Saturday paper.”
The car gently rolled to a stop outside the apartment block, and Tony looked up in mild disdain. Whilst he didn’t look down on Peter and his Aunt for their financial situation, he’d offered a countless amount of times to move them somewhere better, safer. He didn’t like the idea of Peter being left vulnerable, particularly with the recent attacks that he’d been privy to. Of course, May had denied him time after time, refusing to accept his offer, clearly as an attempt to prove herself worthy as Peter’s guardian. Never had Tony doubted that, he had copious amounts of respect for the woman, but he couldn’t help the niggling feeling that they simply weren’t safe.
He could see Tony’s eyes raking over the room, lingering on the cameras and the lock on the door. He almost smirked at the calculating look on his face, no doubt forming a plan to get out of the room, probably hoping he’d be able to convince Steve to join him. He could feel the shift of attention, from the room back to him, following the chocolate eyes as they pinpointed several of his features. The small, self-conscious part of him hoped that Tony liked his updated appearance, but he quickly shook the thought off. He had to focus right now; the rest would come later. Still concentrating on the man’s gaze, Steve shifted awkwardly as the man zoned in on his arms, and then his chest. It came as a bit of a shock when Tony suddenly jerked in his seated position, a loud gasp falling from his lips.
Tony’s heart was now hammering against his rib-cage and he knew that he’d be almost passed out from pain if he’d still had the arc reactor in. As it was, a dull ache began to radiate, not at all helped by the sight of Happy getting knocked out. It didn’t take him long to realise that these were probably the same people that had been after him for months now and that with any witnesses and back up out of the way, they’d be coming for him now.
It was part of their living arrangements, that Steve would cook, and Tony would clean up. Sometimes Steve would help out, but Tony tried to get him to relax at night as much as possible. They’d forgone a dishwasher, and so all the washing up had to be done by hand. Normally that wasn’t too hard of a task, with only the three of them. But tonight, he was obviously distracted. Several times already, he’d almost let go of the kitchen hose tap. All it took was thinking back to Steve in the other room, though, before it went flying out of his hands. It waved around wildly for a second before Tony was able to turn it off, spraying around the sink and over the shelves in the corner.
Steve cringed at the tone in his boss’s voice as he weaved his way through the crowded room towards his desk. He bumped into several chairs and tables on his journey, almost causing a middle-aged man to spill his coffee over his mess of a workspace. Steve gave the man a sheepish grin as he apologised profusely but didn’t slow down. Yes, he was late, but only be two minutes and really, that shouldn’t be considered late at all. It wasn’t his fault anyway, the subway had been so crowded that morning, that it had taken four trains until he’d finally been able to squeeze into a carriage. That was the real injustice this morning.
“Wow…that’s awesome!” Tony probably should have been concerned by the fact that his son found a story about someone falling to their death ‘awesome’, but Peter loved a good hero story. “Can you tell me another story about Bucky, please Daddy?” He begged.
“Alright, well I guess I’ll see you next week then. We need to work on the new shooters for your suit. Ones that won’t snap in half when you bang them on a door frame.”
“We’ve been looking for Thanos ever since he, well…since we lost. We’ve been running facial recognition and surveillance, but nothing has come up.” Steve began to try and give the team direction, so they could try and decide how best to approach their situation. It was generally accepted that they needed to get the gauntlet and stones off Thanos, but the question of how they’d bring everyone back remained. It felt weird, being forced back into his old role, but he knew that they needed some prodding and support before they’d be able to do anything remotely helpful. “Tony, you fought with him, did he give you anything? Any kind of location or coordinates that may help?”
“Did they get to you?” The worry in Tony’s tone shifted towards him at that, reassessing the situation. “Was it Barnes? Steve, please, I can get you out of here.”
A little sigh of contentment slipped past his lips as he reached out a hand to touch Tony’s cheek. The man must have shaven recently because his jawline was smooth as Steve ran his fingers lightly across it. Tony must have been getting closer to awareness since the touch caused a small shiver to wrack his body. The movement only made Steve happier, seeing the kind of reaction that he had to his touch. It made him feel good knowing that no one else would be able to touch him so intimately anymore. The gauntness in Tony’s cheeks made Steve frown and take a mental note of his incapability to look after himself. Steve would do everything in his power to make sure that Tony was staying healthy under his care. No more sleepless nights and skipping meals, Steve would nurse him back into a healthy lifestyle.
Peter’s eyes widened at the unfamiliar name, excitement pulling him out of his drowsy state of mind. He sat up against the bedhead. “No!” Peter quickly shrunk back at the look on Tony’s face at his shouting. Although it still wasn’t that late, Steve wouldn’t be all that happy to know that Tony was letting Peter be up this late. “I thought Falcon was his bestest friend,” Peter spoke again, this time in an exaggerated whisper.
Steve turned around to see Sam making his way over to him. He’d befriended Sam when he’d first started out at his job, with the man working a few floors below him in a small Veterans Affairs clinic. They’d met at this very café, but Steve was quick to realise that he’d rather pay the extra two dollars to have coffee at almost any other place rather than drinking the poor excuse of a beverage that they served here. The two had quickly bonded over their past military experience, something Steve wasn’t particularly fond of remembering, and soon started meeting up outside of work as well. He’s one of the few people Steve didn’t hesitate to actually call a friend.
Steve continued to trace his fingers around, frowning as he felt the dressing of the wound behind his ear. Pressing gently on it, and despising the small whimper it caused, Steve felt his possessiveness flare up.
Although he’d been a shy baby, Peter had really come into his own now. He was an absolute bundle of energy that never seemed to run out, and he was so smart – on par with what Tony was at his age. That was a danger at times, with his never-ending curiosity leading to several almost-catastrophic accidents. They’d gotten through it though, the three of them.
“Well, look what we have here. When was the last time you slummed it down here with the rest of us?”
This moment coming up would be critical to Tony’s development here, and Steve wasn’t about to let anyone else be the first face he sees. This would be when they re-established their bond and would also be Tony’s first glimpse into his new life here. Steve hoped that he could be a reassuring presence, despite their recent history. There had definitely been a time when Tony had taken comfort in him, so Steve was sure that eventually, he’d be able to do so once more. His heart yearned for that to be the case, but his mind was busy reminding him that it was going to take a lot of hard work to make Tony understand what he was doing.
The beeping from his holographic model drew him out of his thoughts, his gaze taking in the inverted Mobius strip. Not really expecting much in the way of results, he couldn’t stop the gasp at the flashing ‘model successful’ that had popped up. He fell back into his chair, the weight of what he’d discovered finally sinking in.
Steve only hushed him gently as he came to a stop in front of him. Reaching out a hand, he cupped Tony’s neck gently, a favourite move of his, before pushing his head back tenderly. This had the dual effect of giving Steve direct eye contact with Tony, whilst also exposing the side of his neck. Whilst the fear and apprehension in his eyes were obvious, Steve could also detect the underlying rebelliousness that was characteristic in all of this. As much as he wanted Tony to be completely his, a small part of him hoped he retained that trait – maybe just to a lesser extent.
Peter let out another giggle, before giving him a faux stern look. He couldn’t hold the expression though before another naughty smile appeared on his face. “Was it juice pops?”
Tony took pity on his son, who seemed to be growing more and more upset as he continued to struggle to pick up the pasta. “Hey, Pete, let me.”
, if not three months ago when they first attempted to take him. “I don’t have that kind of patience, Bucky. You know how much I need this.”
“I had some important shit to do! No, but seriously I just had something on my mind.” He responded, playfully.
“We already did. And we lost. So without a safe, reliable, certain way for us to navigate this ‘quantum realm’, I can’t help you.”
The kid had really brought them out of their funk when they’d found him eight months after relocating. Originally, they were just going to get a dog – a golden retriever. Steve had remembered Sam telling him about how it was common now for returned soldiers to get an emotional support animal, and that they could be immensely helpful by providing comfort and companionship. They’d been close to grabbing one, but then Steve had had a particularly bad episode and they’d decided that having someone that was relying entirely on them would force them to regain some degree of normalcy. And that’s how they’d found Peter.
Steve smiled at his friend’s attempt to redirect his focus. He spied the barista placing his drink on the pick-up counter with a little bit more force than was probably necessary. “Yeah, I’ll catch you later.”
“Tony, I’m sorry, for everything. I know you put your trust and faith in me, and I let you down. We didn’t see eye-to-eye on something, and instead of trying to solve things peacefully, I got hot-headed and rushed into things. I think I just needed to take a step back and see the wider picture. You’re a hero, Earth’s greatest defender, and you deserve better than that.”
He brought his gaze back to the man beside him, still not quite understanding his reluctance to help. Yes, there was the situation in Siberia where they’d tried to kill each other- and to be honest, Tony had come out of that a lot worse off than Steve did – but the whole letter and phone delivery afterwards had Tony thinking that there was some degree of forgiveness between them. Evidently, that wasn’t the case. His heart ached at the memory of the relationship the two had once shared, that had all come crashing down over the period of a couple of days. Since it was the first time he’d seen him in two years, the rush of feelings was almost dizzying and it was a concerted effort to push them down and try to focus on the tasks at hand.
A quick shuffling at his side had Tony’s neck snapping to his right, purely on reflex. He regretted instantly though, with a sharp singe of pain erupting from the spot at the base of his neck. He couldn’t stop the whine that left him at the reaction his body had to the movement.
His boss only grunted from his position outside of his office. Both of them knew that this definitely would happen again, but Steve liked to think that his work here was valued enough that being late every now and then wouldn’t jeopardise his position. The look his boss was giving him indicated that that was simply wishful thinking, and any journalist for a B grade newspaper was entirely replaceable.
Instead, they’d looked at adoption. It hadn’t been all that hard in the end. Millions of children had lost their only relatives in the snap, left with no one to care for them. Peter’s story hadn’t been exactly like that, with his parents dying after a suddenly pilot-less airplane had crashed into a field somewhere over Virginia. Tony knew that Steve had been reluctant to adopt a kid whose parents had been dusted, for lack of a better word, at the risk of them coming back. Despite all his talk about moving on, and forging a new world, he was awfully caught up in the old some days. Tony didn’t have that problem, acknowledging that five years after the whole Thanos and no sign of change meant that everything was pretty permanent.
As much as he would have loved to stand there for hours just watching the two of them interact, he didn’t want to intrude on the moment. Both him and Steve would often divulge things to Peter that they wouldn’t to each other, knowing their child wouldn’t judge or second-guess their admissions. It would be unfair for him to listen in on those sorts of things. He pulled out of the doorway, becoming aware, once more, of the cold sensations running through his body from his soaked clothing. Yeah, he should probably have that shower.
Steve’s chest tightened painfully as Tony spoke, his words breaking through his tough exterior, though he tried his hardest not to let it show. He almost preferred the struggling from moments ago. He’d been scared that Tony would react this way but hadn’t done much to prepare himself for it – so much for not underestimating him. He just kept reminding himself that all of this was only temporary. Tony would come around eventually. He had to.
Tony’s eyes watered at the sight of Steve being so gentle and soft with Peter. His eyes drifted down to the thin gold band that was wrapped snuggly around his finger. They kept them simple, as they did most things in their life now, but it carried so much in its meaning. Love, obviously, but also the whole story of their relationship – their pain, their loss, their forgiveness.
But then, his eyes caught the symbol in the middle of the chest. Tony felt his stomach fall away as he took in the all too familiar insignia.
“Hey, where’d you get that, you little rascal?” He reached forward and gently pulled the mask of his son’s head. The helmet was huge on him but still managed to mess up his hair, leaving his curls sticking out everywhere.
Steve knew there was a large degree of truth to his friend’s words, as much as he’d like to argue otherwise. Despite their intimacy before the whole Accords issue, they’d certainly lost the trust between them. Steve knew that it would take time and effort to rebuild it, but he was willing to sacrifice almost anything to make it possible. “We’ll let him wake up first, tell him what’s going on.
His eyes snapped to his boss, who had suddenly leant forward and was resting his elbows on the mahogany desk.
They returned from space dejected and hopeless, their only chance at undoing the snap unsuccessful. Steve remembers the journey there, the anticipation and hope that maybe, just maybe they might be able to pull this off. The tip-off from Nebula had been more than helpful in tracking him down – but they were too late. The stones were gone and with them any prospect of bringing everyone back. He tried to take comfort in the fact that Thanos was dead now. That even though they’d ultimately failed, there was at least one aspect where they’d succeeded. It didn’t help much.
Steve paced angrily around his dimly lit office as he tried to process the information that was coming to him. His hands shook in rage, and his chest puffed with each deep breath he took to try and calm down. It really shouldn’t have been as difficult as it was proving to be, but obviously, he hadn’t picked the right people for the job. Honestly, how hard was it to pick up a single individual, one that wasn’t even enhanced in any way?
Approaching the bedside cautiously, Steve sighed at the sight of Tony’s still shut eyes. It had been less than a day, in whole, since they’d left, so it wasn’t exactly unexpected, but it did delay his plan a little bit. Without thinking too much about it, Steve sat himself in the small armchair beside the bed and laid his hand over Tony’s. A blanket still separated the two, with Tony far too at risk of catching a cold or pneumonia to not have one covering him, but Steve could feel the comforting warmth. For what felt like the first time in a month, and likely was, Steve felt a small smile adorn his face.
Peter nodded emphatically. So, Tony proceeded to tell him about the Howling Commandos, and their heroic adventure through Italy to capture Zola. He gave plenty of background too. He spoke about how Bucky would jump in to save Steve when he was getting beaten up by some bully in a back alley. He slipped in a couple of anecdotes about Steve’s endless bouts of illness throughout childhood, too, and how Bucky had been the one to nurse him back to health – or at least back to the closest he could get to health. It all ended with the fight on the train, and the very vague description of Bucky being thrown off the mountain.
Peter still struggled as Tony reached over, but eventually let go of the fork that they were warring over. Tony awkwardly cut up the pasta into more manageable sizes for a child, before handing over the spoon. Although pouting, Peter accepted the utensil and resumed his eating. He smiled as he was able to pick some of the meal up and bring it to his mouth. “Thank you, daddy.”
Steve walked over to Tony and stood beside him. He placed his hand firmly on his shoulder and gave it a reassuring squeeze.
“Not that it’s a competition, but Peter loves me three-thousand. The last time I checked; you were somewhere in the low six-to-nine-hundreds range.”
He shook off the stares, and instead turned to his computer to continue with the article he had spent the week writing. He’d been stuck on Saturday columns for the whole 4 months that he’d been here. That wouldn’t necessarily be the worst thing, except that it involved what had to be the lowest pay rate in the office. He was struggling enough trying to make it by in New York as it was, and really didn’t want to have to pick up a second job (or a new first job if his meeting ended badly). On top of that, what was usually at least a 2000-word article would get shortened to less than 500 and stuck on whichever page it would fit. He was hoping that he’d be able to pull off an amazing article soon, and in turn, get more articles assigned to him. The investigative team ended up with the best pay of the office, despite their low rates, due to the interest that they tended to amass. These articles ended up being the headlines, not the crappy little column on page 12.
Tony didn’t say anything about the blush travelled up the boy’s neck and onto his cheeks at the statement, not wanting to embarrass him any further. Not that Tony found it embarrassing, but again, he wouldn’t admit to that.
Steve began to grow uncomfortable under the other man’s gaze. It was already 11:12 and the man had yet to say a word. Instead, he almost seemed to take pleasure in the growing uneasiness of the man in front of him. Steve just fiddled with a loose thread on his trousers, hoping that this meeting wasn’t going to end in his firing.
He raked his eyes over the man, taking in his beard once more, and noting the increased muscles along his arms, bulging against the tight fabric of his suit. For a brief moment, Tony wondered what it would be like to be wrapped up in them, knowing firsthand the safety and security they could provide. He had to quickly remind himself that as comforting as those arms could be, he also knew first-hand that they could be dangerously strong when pummelling a shield into his head and chest over and over again.
Steve was the first one up the ramp of the ship as soon as it had opened to reveal Tony. A frail, malnourished, and emaciated Tony, but Tony none the less. Whilst the appearance of a foreign aircraft at the Avengers compound had initially been a cause for concern, but now, with his arms wrapped firmly around the small body of his lover, Steve felt as if he could finally breathe after months of anguish. The warmth, though faint, was so familiar
Suddenly there was another blow to the car, this one from above where Tony sat, making him jump in his seat, and quickly reach for his briefcase that lay on the floor. His seatbelt, although it had done little to stop him from flying forwards earlier, was now locked and the case now lay just out of reach. He still tried, fingers brushing hopelessly against the handle, almost teasing him.
Steve leant over and cupped the back of Tony’s neck in his palm. “I know, I know I let you down, but I want to try this again. Properly. Just you and me.”
Tony’s tensed up as his son pointed over his left shoulder. The sound of a car door thudding shut seemed to confirm what his son had said, without him having to turn around. Finally, moving to face his new guests, Tony was near overwhelmed by emotions.
He reached over to flick off the lamp, not taking his eyes off Peter. He paused in the doorway, almost needing to pinch himself to remember that this was real, that he really was this lucky.
“Yeah, except you’re nowhere near where I am, and you’d have to go in the opposite direction to pick me up. Thanks for the offer, but I’ll keep, how’d you put it, slumming it on the subway.”
Gritting his teeth and realising that he was going to have to up his game, Tony charged towards the man. He clearly wasn’t expecting this, freezing for a moment too long, and getting hit in the side with the next shot Tony fired. The force of the blow sent him back into the car, breaking yet another window. The man stayed down longer than Tony was expecting though, making him lower his hand in confusion. Surely, one hit from his low-powered gloves wasn’t enough to cause this much damage. Tony probably should have paid more attention to the suspicious side of his mind.
He reached over to grab the fork from Peter, as well as the knife and spoon that were tucked under his own bowl. Peter snatched his hand back though, causing more sauce to go flying, this time landing across the table. “No!”
“So, what’s your plan now? You’ve finally got him but he’s not going to just go along with what you say. Not for a long time, I’d expect.”
Knowing that it was already getting late and that Peter had school in the morning (not to mention the fact that May would skin him alive if Peter got home much later), Tony carefully shook the boy’s shoulder. He knew that he was susceptible to nightmares and that suddenly waking him up was probably not a good idea.
Steve didn’t quite know if he was hearing the man correctly, since he’d been practically forced to change everything about what he’d written. “I…well…”
Steve almost growled at the mention of Bucky, the same protectiveness he felt in Siberia flaring up again before he reminded himself that Tony simply wasn’t in the right mind, that it was his job to set things straight. He only took a small amount of joy in having to do so.
Except now, here he was. Back by Steve’s side, where he should be. Despite all the loss they’d all suffered, and all the hurt and anger, he found a small part of himself singing with happiness. He’d been struggling after getting back to the US after the fight in Wakanda. Not only was he emotionally exhausted, but he’d also spent two years on the run, and suddenly the world was relying on him again. The pressure had built up, and he’d begun to falter, having a hard time getting out of bed each morning and getting the energy to leave the compound. He’d managed to shave what Rocket had dubbed his ‘depression beard’ though, so he guessed that was a plus.
It had been just over two hours since they’d brought Tony back when Rhodey thought they should inform him of what had been going on. It seemed obvious that Tony was aware that something had happened, but the extent to which would be hard to imagine even for a genius.
Only seconds after he had the gauntlets on, the same hand came through his window, showering his back in glass fragments. It reached around, feeling the air where Tony had been sitting only moments before. If he’d had more time, Tony might have taken note of the fact that it was a black, metallic arm that was reaching around, but instead, he just threw himself towards the other side of the car, fumbling for the handle.
Steve was almost running through the halls after receiving the message from Bucky, the rows off doors blurring as he made his way back to the room. The excitement was building under his skin, his veins almost vibrating as a result. The anticipation continued to push him faster and faster along his winding path. The only thing stopping him from breaking into a sprint was the countless amount of his men that he was passing on his way. Already, he was being given a fair few questioning glances, something he’d usually punish, making him hyperaware of the need to keep up appearances, but he would never forgive himself if he missed his Tony waking up.
“You don’t wanna hear what it entails first? This isn’t a simple cut and dry article to be written. We don’t really know where it’s going to lead. That’s why the research aspect is so important.” Steve was simply nodding along with everything he was hearing. “Look, you know who Tony Stark is, right?”
He slowed his pace as he spotted the steel door that was now the only thing standing between him and Tony. They’d been keeping him in one of the interrogation rooms, but only until Steve felt confident moving him into his own quarters. He didn’t want to overwhelm him straight away, instead allowing him to adapt a bit more to his surroundings. Steve knew Tony well enough to be able to predict quite a violent reaction to his situation, and he wanted to make sure he wasn’t going to hurt himself. Therefore, it had been decided that they’d keep him there, under constant supervision.
“-Because that looks a hell of a lot like a fucking HYDRA logo, except that clearly can’t be the case since you literally sacrificed yourself to rid the world of them-”
“You’re still standing here, so obviously you’ve got something else to report. Spit it out, I don’t have it in me for you to be wasting my time right now.”
“You destroyed everything that we had,” Tony spat at him. “It’s gone, all of it. So if you want to go on this little mission of yours, then fine. But I’m not helping you. You take this-” Tony ripped the arc reactor of his chest before shoving it into Steve’s hands. “-and you hide. But I’m done here-”
Even their wedding hadn’t involved many people. They’d extended the invitation, of course, to Nat, Bruce, Thor, and to Clint’s farmhouse. They’d all not shown up, Nat at a UN convention, Bruce still in his gamma lab, and Thor not being able to bring himself to leave his new settlement in Norway. They hadn’t taken it personally, of course. If anything, it made the whole affair less awkward, and now they were both able to look back on it with nothing but fond memories. Rhodey had been there, and Happy too. Peter, with all of his two years, had been in attendance, but no one else. The registrar had wed them by the lake, and there was really no need for the honeymoon with how they lived.
Tony sat at the dinner table that night, trying to forget about the events of the day. As nice as it had been to see the team again, he hated the doubt that they’d left him with. He was happy, truly happy here with Steve and Peter. They were away from all the chaos that plagued the cities, they’d been able to bond and were slowly moving on from Thanos. But now, a tiny part of his mind was questioning whether his happiness outweighed, potentially, that of literally the rest of the world – universe even. He’d been selfish, so selfish, throughout his whole life and now he had the chance to take a leap and help the team out. At this stage, that part of his mind was quiet enough to ignore, and Tony really wanted to keep it that way.
He’d been after Tony for months now. Ever since Siberia, Steve had focused on rebuilding HYDRA from the ashes that were left. The organisation was almost unrecognisable from what it used to be, carefully reshaped under his leadership. After the whole drama with the Accords, and the failure of international governments to understand the need for earth’s protection, Steve had decided to take matters into his own hands. Slowly, yet effectively, he’d begun to infiltrate national governments, putting in place operatives that were quietly reforming how countries were ruled. The movements were subtle, so as not to draw any attention, but they were working, and they’d gotten well past the halfway point.
“I’m not sure we should move in right away, Steve.” Bucky quickly held up his hand before Steve could interject. “He only started coming on the trips after we went after him on his trip to California, and then after our attempt at the charity gala, he started bringing those gauntlets. I don’t know what extra measures he’s going to start taking after tonight. I mean, it’s pretty obvious that this is personal now. And those men we lost tonight were wearing uniforms. He’ll see the symbol, he’ll know HYDRA is back up and running. I’m just thinking that we need to take a break for a while. Let him settle back in, and then once he lets his guard down and starts making mistakes again, we’ll be able to grab him.”
He’d been almost a year old by the time they’d adopted him. Tony had gotten Happy to look into several orphanages to try and find the right kid. Normally Pepper would have done that, but Happy had managed well enough. It had taken some time to choose the right one, almost four months into their search. Peter had been in a small orphanage in Queens, where he’d been constantly overlooked due to his smaller size. He was outgrowing that now, but they’d been very cautious in the first few years. Tony thought that it might have actually been part of the reason why Peter was so perfect for them. Steve saw something of himself in the baby, enough to bring out his protective side. Once they’d found Peter it had been an incredibly quick process of bringing him home. The adoption processes had been simplified greatly to try and encourage families to adopt new children since there was such an abundance now.
Without so much as a word of agreement, Steve heard the door to the room creak open, only to fall shut moments later. Finally, alone with Tony once more, Steve felt a small smile tugging on his lips. It would all be worth it in the end.
“I always will…” Steve cringed at the devastation on Tony’s face. “But not like that, Tony. He was my best friend, my brother. You were the only one,
Steve raked his eyes over Tony as the man took in the images that kept flashing up on the heads-up display. They were pictures of those missing, presumed vanished. Steve felt his concern grow but refrained himself from approaching. Earlier, once they’d managed to get Tony inside, he had almost immediately detached himself from Steve and didn’t seem to be too keen on them being close. Steve probably would have dwelt on that for a while longer if it wasn’t for the more pressing issues at hand. Tony’s face had hardened significantly as a photograph of Pepper appeared before him.
Steve felt as if Sam was taking the words right out of his mind. He felt way in over his head, but there was no way that he could back out now. His boss had practically forced this on him, having already got him approved as a bodyguard for Stark before he’d even heard of the job. This felt like some crazy daydream that Steve had every time he got given another uninspiring topic to write his brief on. He’d been constantly wishing for an opportunity to write something bigger and better than his usual stuff, and here it was, right in front of him. So why was he feeling so uncertain about everything?
Steve met his eyes from where he stood, the two of them having a silent conversation. It seemed they were on the same page, really. They’d gained so much and the two of them were as close to their happily ever after that they were going to get. They couldn’t afford to risk what they had left, to risk Peter, on a whim.
As much as it was his own space, he’d made it clear that Tony would always be welcome. It was a similar story with the garage and the make-do lab that were on the bottom level of the house too. They realised that they needed to stop shutting each other out, so there was always an open invitation for either of them to go where they needed.
A super fast update. But, I probably won't have another one for a little while because I have lots of study to do - study that I've been putting off to write fanfiction, so...
Steve squinted at him, not quite following what he was saying. “…and just so we’re on the same page…what did you figure out?”
“We weren’t sure enough that it would continue. It could have just happened when Stark was freed up enough. But it seems like he’s actually making time and clearing his schedule for this.”
Steve sighed, half in relief and half in annoyance at the appearance of Bucky. Whilst he wasn’t particularly in the mood to see anyone, if he was going to have to endure anyone’s presence, he was glad it was his. Of course, he’d never let anyone else survive taking such an attitude with him. Steve ran his eyes over the man, taking in the blood that stained his now matte black arm, and the rest of his dark suit. With the forced removal of his arm in Siberia, Bucky had been stuck with three limbs until Steve had found someone with enough intelligence to create a new one. Of course, it still fell short of what Steve expected Tony could create, but it did its job well enough. The new colour palette helped with stealth when needed, no longer shining under light.
Sorry, this is unbeta'd so will come back to edit later, when it's not 2am and I'm not about to pass out.
“-Hey, Pete. It’s all good. Just took me by surprise a little there.” To prove a point, Tony pulled him back in for another embrace, smiling softly as Peter was quick to return it. This one wasn’t much longer, but that had more to do with the car that zoomed past where they were stopped than it did with anything else.
“Steve, hey,” Natasha smiled at the sight of her friend. She skipped up to him and pulled him into a tight embrace. Much like Tony, Steve hadn’t kept in touch with the Avengers since they’d left five years ago. Tony knew it was to do with his guilt surrounding the fight in Wakanda, and their subsequent journey to space. As much as Tony tried to tell him that it wasn’t his fault, Steve wouldn’t hear it. He’d turn the words on Tony before they’d both settle into a silent understanding that it was something that would no longer be discussed.
That had the opposite effect, with Tony only tensing up further as he brought the needle closer. Making sure they still held each other’s gaze, Tony winced slightly as Steve gently pushed the needle into his soft skin, injecting its contents slowly. It was somewhat of a power play, reminding Tony of how little control he had over the situation, whilst also remaining calm and gentle with him.
Tony tuned out a bit as Rhodey tried to explain the plan to Steve. Instead, he focused on the emotions running over his husband’s face. First, there was confusion, lots of it. The whole idea of time travel and quantum physics was a lot to wrap your head around, particularly when you didn’t have any background in either subject. This was quickly replaced by hope though. Hearing that Scott had been there, and made it out in one piece, was enough to kick-start that emotion. Tony’s heart yearned at that, knowing the danger that hope had given Steve in the past. Some part of Steve must have registered this too because the hope transitioned to resignation as soon as they laid out the flaws in the plan.
Steve only nodded at Bucky’s words, too focused on the other man in the room. His mouth had dried out as his excitement grew. All he could think about was pulling Tony into his arms and never letting him go again. He’d make a mistake back in Siberia, not only hurting the man and breaking the trust between them, but also leaving him alone. He knew what solitude did to Tony, and as much as he hated to admit it, he knew it was his other relationships with the team he was building, namely the Parker kid, that had kept him going. He’d thrown himself into new projects to help them out, always making sure that he was needed by someone. This all came at the cost of neglecting himself, something that would need to be unlearnt.
Once it gave way, and Tony quickly picked himself up from a rather ungracious exist, he quickly spun himself around to face his attacker. Unsurprisingly, the figure was dressed in all black, but his muscled silhouette let Tony know that they were indeed a male. Quickly, thinking through a rough strategy, Tony raised his hand and shot his repulsor towards the man. With a surprisingly gracious manoeuvre, however, the man rolled off the car, dodging the beam entirely.
“So, hang on, you’ve been asked to do a major piece, undercover, on Tony Stark’s new plans for his company. That sounds like a lot for someone who has never done more than a weekly piece that has to be approved by his superiors, and never gets anywhere near the headline pages. Are you sure you’re the right guy for this?”
He peeked over his shoulder to see Bucky given him a doubtful look. As much as the lack of sleep was affecting Bucky, it had been even longer since Steve had gotten some decent rest. He’d tried, on several occasions, but the excitement and anticipation he had felt since Bucky had come up with their new plan had meant any attempt at sleep was bound to fail. He’d felt the fatigue, only moments ago when he’d still been dealing with the rest of his tasks for the day, but upon seeing Tony it all faded away. Whilst he thought he had a strong hold over his emotions, and an impassive mask to go with it, to Bucky he’d always been an open book.
They finished in time for lunch and Steve found himself sat across from Tony to eat. He was somewhat surprised that Tony was eating with the rest of them rather than leaving to go eat at some fancy restaurant. When he said as much Tony pulled a face.
Steve let out an awkward laugh. It seemed a little silly to get coy after their furious make out session at the airport, but he wasn't really sure what he'd be comfortable with. He hadn't got a whole lot of experience. One high school girlfriend that barely went beyond handholding, Peggy, and Peggy's cousin Sharon who had always been a little too fast to get physical for his preference. Not one of them was a man, and definitely not a man like Tony.
There's a man Steve recognises from the news talking with Tony and Dr. Cho when Steve gets up to the shielded room where Dr. Cho is looking over the scan.
"You're attracted to me?" Steve asked doubtfully. It didn't seem likely. Maybe he misinterpreted Tony's words.
Tony was getting with the program now, arms wrapping around Steve's body and pressing them up close against each other. His tongue joined the party and Steve opened for it, not caring that everything was getting a bit too heated for an airport corridor. He had a point to prove and he was damn well going to prove it, and enjoy himself while he did.
"Okay, maybe I misread the moment," Tony said. "But that seemed like an overreaction. What's going on?"
"I didn't think you'd..." Tony said, nearly proving Steve's doubts, before continuing. "I mean, sure. Don't look a gifthorse in the mouth, right? Where do you wanna go?"
He's been in this world for three weeks and he's no closer to proving that this isn't his world. Every test, whether medical, scientific or mystical, comes back at best inconclusive, at worst hinting towards it being a case of shifted memories, not a shifted world. It's frustrating and terrifying and... honestly a little tantalising. He wants to go home, he does. He needs to fix things there. But there's no one left back home who'd be working on bringing him back, and everyone here is leaning further and further away from Steve's claims. His chances of getting home are slim. And stepping out of the mental health unit for the third time in a week, having just had lunch with a Bucky who is not only physically healthy, but getting there mentally, too, makes it difficult to remember that this isn't his Bucky, that he needs to go home.
"How many times do you think you can pull this fake death thing?" Tony asks, ignoring Thor apart from a friendly pat on the arm. "I mean, do Asgardians not have that fairy tale, or fable, whatever it is, the one with the kid who keeps lying so they let a wolf eat him?"
"I swear I'm not stalking you," Tony told him. "This event's been planned for a couple of months, I haven't even known you that long."
Tony broke away first, though Steve was bordering on an asthma attack from the way his breath was starting to rasp from the exertion.
The very idea of describing the mess that's been the last six years makes Steve's mouth dry. "I'd rather hear about this world."
"So, yeah. My money's on your brain tricking you into thinking all the worst case scenarios have happened. Maybe Loki got involved, or some other bad guy, or maybe it's just a weird side effect of serum enhanced PTSD. I don't know. But if 'your world' is real, then surely you should be able to think of at least a couple of things that were better there," Tony says.
His world's Tony would never trust Steve's hand around his neck, no matter how gentle or affectionately placed.
Tony barely pauses in reaching for his coke. "I dunno. I guess some combination of opposites attract and my stunning charm and charisma."
He actually got someone's number while they were out. Surrounded by Bucky, Peggy and Angie that was unheard of, but Steve somehow went home with a napkin with a name and number scrawled across it by a pretty girl with a shy smile and bright red lipstick.
"Your aura, your chi, your katra, your lifeforce," Strange says. "I've encountered Captain Stark's before and I should be able to detect any differences."
Steve feels despair creep over him at the hopelessness and defeat in Tony's voice. After so much time in the other Tony's company, he'd forgotten what that had sounded like. A futurist with no clear vision of a happy future. "We need to fix it."
"If we can figure out those things there's a good chance any other questions will get answered along the way," Tony says. "So. Let's draw up our list of suspects again. Maybe have a longer chat about what it is that you remember differently."
Steve shakes his head but doesn't argue. He knows he won't win Tony around on this one, and even if he did, Tony wouldn't let him know it. Steve can be vigilant enough for the both of them.
"Murder them? Yeah," Tony answers the question Steve can't quite ask. "But after extensive therapy and repeated nagging from my husband I've come to terms with the fact that it wasn't his fault. We even spent Thanksgiving at the hospital with him last year."
