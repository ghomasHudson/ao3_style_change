Tony puts on the clothes because he’s a tad chilly now, and he’s regretful about it. Maybe he does it a little too slow. Steve’s already moved on to picking up Tony’s discarded swim shorts and hanging them in the bathroom. Tony has no idea what he’s going to do with the robe.
“Anything, Steve,” Tony says, easier than everything else he’s been saying, easier than any dirty thing he’s said before. “I’ll do anything.” Steve doesn’t respond to Tony’s words, so Tony doesn’t stop touching him. He seems close. Every muscle in his body is strained. He
“He’ll be fine,” the hologram answered. “Thank you for bringing him here--” he did really look thankful, his soft smile met his eyes, “--but Iron Man’s going to need his privacy now.”
“What do you need?” Steve asked when it became clear that Iron Man didn’t have the ability to articulate much of anything. He wanted to help, but had no idea how.
“It’s for Captain America,” Steve says, and smiles as he closes the bag, a big, real, rare smile, one of the few Tony’s seen since Steve arrived.
Steve pulls away. “I know.” He clasps his hands firm on Tony’s shoulders, like an imitation of a wise old man imparting some sage advice. “Do it anyway.”
So, he did what he does best. Tony Stark built something. He tried to fix it. His new body has none of the scars, none of the bruises, none of the memory sensations of his old one. It’s clean of everything the Supreme Leader did to him.
“You did good,” Natasha says. She looks exactly as she did the last time Tony saw her, right down to the braided hair. With a hand on her hip, she nods to compound’s ruins. “Left a little bit of a mess, though.”
It wasn’t easy to file that answer away, but there were more important things happening. Steve repeated his earlier question. “Are you ok?” he asked, because Tony had a heart condition and Steve
Steve shrugs. “Haven’t really thought about it.” He opens a travel-sized sewing kit and without asking, rifles through the plastic bag holding everything Tony bought today until he pulls out the oversized black jacket.
Tony rolls his eyes. “You didn’t answer my question. Also, it’s really weird when you try to tell ‘back-in-my-day’ stories.”
“We all wish we did things differently. Everything...it just escalated, and it was going to continue to escalate until something happened--”
Steve’s abrupt stop caught Tony off guard. He paused and gently turned the horse to face Steve. “Can’t really feel that way and live in Timely, you know?”
Steve hears the words out of Tony’s mouth, but he doesn’t understand them, doesn’t recognize what they mean when strung together in a sentence. Tony’s staring straight ahead, watching him, stoic and unmoving, and he’s ready for a battle he doesn’t want.
Steve smiles and shakes his head. “The future. Yeah, of course, I’ll keep that in mind,” he says. They stare at each other for a second while Tony’s hand combs through Steve’s still wet hair and then grips the back of his neck. Steve opens his mouth like he’s going to say something, but Tony’s lips are on his before he decides exactly what. He, or Tony, or the both of them at the same time scoot closer to each other on the bed, and Tony’s sweat-damp body is pressed up against Steve’s sweat-damp body, and
“I had no idea,” are the words that finally come out of Tony’s mouth. “I wish…I wish you had said something. Why didn’t you tell me?” Tony’s voice grows more and more panicked as he speaks. “Steve, wow, I don’t even know where to begin. We were going to get married?”
“You? Steve Rogers?” Tony props himself up by his elbow and looks down to see Steve staring straight up at him, eyes wide and a rebuke on his lips. “I thought your whole thing was choice. We had this fight, not sure if you remember it, but you argument rested on this idea to
It was by the skin of his teeth that he made it back to the mansion and the privacy of the office. There it was safe to remove the helmet and his gauntlets. He left on the rest of the armor to absorb all the charge he could get before someone came around looking for either him or Tony, not the true agglomeration of the both of them.
“If he had a choice,” Tony begins, “Why would he choose the single dad who’s fifteen years older than him over the love of his life?” He’s aggressive and challenging and ready to preempt any of Natasha’s arguments. “And I wouldn’t want him to! The last time I tried anything with a commitment like that, it failed. There’s no reason to think it’ll be different this time.” He sighs and tilts his head to look up at the cheap hotel chandelier hanging from the ceiling. “I couldn’t live with myself if I stood between him and his dream.”
He didn't know what to say. Tony looked towards the window and through the thick, blurry glass. Wong’s home was in the heart of Timely. Even though he couldn’t see it from this angle, Tony knew exactly where he was in relation to where Steve had been gunned down. It was too close. It was
This is the sort of situation that Tony expects to spiral out of control when Steve’s involved. They’re better now, sure, but like everything about Tony’s relationship with the man, that’s tenuous. He expects Steve to yell back or come to his own defense or even try to deescalate the situation.
“No, it’s not.” Tony counters. “You’re dead.” He rubs his eyes, like it’s any way to make the very real Steve in front of him disappear. “Fuck, I thought I was done with these fucking hallucinations.”
“I can explain,” both Tonys, the one in the armor and the hologram that had appeared beside him, said at the same time. “Goddamnit, turn it off!” And the blue light disappeared in front of Steve’s eyes.
Steve catches Tony’s wrist before he has a chance to eat any of them. “Why’re you the scientist?” Steve asks. “I think I’d make a fine ‘Doctor Stevens’.”
Tony shrugs. Where can even start? “Everybody’s in a different place, I think. We’re motivated. Bruce and I wanted to start immediately, but Rhodey’s all ‘you need to sleep before you do science’ and no one stood up for us when we argued with him.”
Tony should have expected this. He should have a pre-packaged response. Or at least, he should have talked to Steve about how to handle it. He’ll feel shady if he talks about this with Natasha. “That proves nothing.”
Iron Man filled him in with the situation they were about to enter. It sounded like classic sort of stuff--The Masters of Evil had released a swarm of bees in Central Park--so a normal Wednesday.
Maybe Steve really does care about Tony in the way he seems to right now; Tony not sure he’ll ever be able to know the answer, because Steve doesn’t just need Tony, he needs Tony to see him the way he was before he was the Supreme Leader. He needs him to be the one person who doesn’t remember Hydra’s reign. He
“To thank you for all you’ve done for this country?” It’s an obvious misdirection on Tony’s part, an attempt to draw Steve into a comfortable back-and-forth like they had before.
Steve looks to the side where there’s a clock on the gym’s wall. In the dark Tony can’t tell what time it is, but Steve can. “Actually, it’s ten and a half hours. I guess I should try and get some sleep before tomorrow.”
The hologram was just like it was before, blue, transparent, and a spitting image of Tony. It was stuck stock still, frozen into place until Tony gave it more instructions, and Tony was glad at that. The thing made him uncomfortable, and after what had just happened, it made him feel a little bit like a failure. “What do I do with you?” he asked the light in front of him. He needed one more chance to convince Steve before it was too late.
Tony’s attention, along with everyone else’s, turns to Steve. “What’s that?” Natasha asks. It appears Steve hadn’t given her a heads up on what he wanted on the agenda.
But then Tony disappeared with nothing but vague texts that didn’t pin down his location and Steve had been beginning to feel more and more like he did in the beginning--that he wasn’t enough for a man like Tony.
Tony takes in the group and reminds himself he's right here, right now. This isn't a dream. His gaze stops travelling when he catches Steve looking at him. Steve smiles like he expected to get caught. Tony’s shocked into staring for a beat or two, but he tries to play it off and wiggles his eyebrows in some approximation of an unspoken language. For not the first time tonight, Tony recognizes Steve looks
“What do I owe the pleasure?” he asks with a smile tight across his face and one hand gripping the back of the chair he was sitting on.
Tony blinks a couple of times. “But, you’re old.” Way older than the last time Tony had seen him, when they had been punching each other’s heads in.
Doctor Strange raised his hand towards Tony and read from a book in a language Tony had no knowledge of. They continued for at least fifteen minutes. Tony shifted from foot to foot, more and more aware of the fact that this was probably a joke at his expense. He was seriously considering walking away when Doctor Strange stopped speaking and motioned towards him. “Now is when you say the name of your sheriff in the way you knew him.”
, but he slowly slips his now soft dick out of Steve’s ass and collapses onto the bed next to Steve. “Fuck, that was good.” It takes a couple more breaths before he has the wherewithal to remove the condom. He looks around, trying to find a way to discard it without getting off the bed. Steve takes it out of his hand, deftly ties it, and aims it at a trash bin on the other end of the studio apartment. Because he’s Steve’s, he makes the shot.
“Tou-che.” The line, that ‘Steve is quite fuckable right now' line is too close in his vision, and that’s the only thing that deters him from making a joke about situations when size matters. “It’s just that--”
Steve decides to play stupid. He’s been telling himself for the last hour he isn’t thinking about it. So, it’s almost real when he asks, “what thing from earlier?”
Tony shoves that idea away as soon as he thinks it. The logical progression of that idea is that it’s
“Well, I do.” He remembers that night Steve had told him—while lost in some memory—that Peggy was the ‘right person’. Tony exists in that moment for a while, seeing it through every lens he has. He doesn’t come up with anything definite to settle the sinking feeling in his gut.
That was only two minutes before all of them were standing in a circle with the rest of the team and there was an empty space between Steve and Clint. Natasha became one more empty space because of Thanos. There was no dust, but thinking about it gives Tony the same dread he felt as Peter slipped away.
--Steve Rogers--I can’t...I don’t even know what to say. And I can’t even remember.” Tony shakes his head. “Steve, look at me,” he pleads. Steve listens. The light of the stars outside are reflected in Tony’s glassy eyes. “You
The smell of coffee wafts from the mug as Tony enters the workshop, the heat of the ceramic encourages him to hold it closer, tighter. He had started the day in Steve’s arms and plans on ending it that way; but in the meantime the universe is collapsing and Tony has work to do.
” Tony asks, completely surprised. Natasha is unfazed and keeps looking at him like she expects him to share his deepest thoughts. So Tony tries. “I don’t even know where to start with that one.”
Steve’s eyes go freakishly wide. Maybe it’s too soon? It’s been forever since Tony’s propositioned someone like this, what the hell is the right etiquette again?
A very familiar looking man was greeting the people of Timely with a confused expression. Steve no longer had his sheriff’s badge, but otherwise he looked exactly the same as the day he died--right down to the splotch of red blood that had seeped into his vest. Tony looked right at him and for a few fine moments knew only happiness to see his face. He was so
Tony’s a skeptic—Steve’s notoriously an awful spy. On the other hand, if Tony leaves now he’ll just be stuck in his room until it’s time to get ready for the mission. “I snore, sometimes,” Tony says. It’s an exaggeration—Pepper has only said he’s snored once and that was when he had a bad cold. But it’s a test question. For some reason the answer matters.
“I’ve seen your sex tape.” The words fall out in one quick breath, like Steve’s ripping off a band-aid.
Tony kneels on the bed so that he can loom over Steve. One-by-one, he tackles each button and keeps his eyes trained on Steve. The shirt soon ends up as a rumpled pile somewhere in the vicinity of the desk. Steve’s fingers pull Tony’s undershirt out from where it’s tucked into pants, and his eyes follow the hem as Tony pulls it over his head and throws it somewhere he’s not looking. Steve’s eager hands dart to his pants, but Tony swats them away so he can efficiently stand up, push them down, and kick them off his hips.
This was it. This was the moment Tony couldn’t run from. He would have to tell Steve the truth, and he’d be lucky if Steve only decided to turn around and return to Timely without a word. “Because I love you,” he explained, pained to have to say the words aloud. “And I couldn’t bear living in a world without you.” He turned away from Steve and waited for his reaction.
“No, I’m just saying, in the future, that would be a great birthday present. I’m planting the idea in your head now.”
The idea of Steve looking over his shoulder makes Tony rather jumpy. “Yeah, I guess. But I understand if there is anywhere you’d rather be.”
“It’s a simple yes or no question.” Tony pouts. At first it’s in earnest; he’s surprisingly offended by Steve’s response. But then the crinkles forming around Steve’s eyes break down his defenses and he begins to laugh, too. “Just say, ‘yes Tony, you blew my mind.’ It’s not that hard.”
Steve pushes himself off the couch, gripping the armrest for support and taking longer to stand steady on his feet than Tony expects. “That’s ok. I have another favor to ask, though.”
“All of it,” Steve says, the hint of a command in his voice, and he clearly means the boxers Tony’s erection are straining against. They slip down, too, but slower than before. The thought crosses Tony’s mind that he’s walking past a line he can’t uncross. One night of sex could mean anything, but two nights needs an explanation, a label, and a future. He looks down at Steve and knows he doesn’t want to stop, that he doesn’t care about the consequences.
while he grips the sheets. Tony’s kneeling, almost looming above him, and again he feels a delicious sense of control to see Steve like this. “Yes, Tony, yes,” is the last thing Steve says before he’s coming all over his stomach. Tony continues to pump him right until Steve squirms against his grip and begins the process of getting oxygen back in his lungs and through his bloodstream.
“Please—” Steve begs, though for what Tony doesn’t know. Does Steve want him to go faster? Tony’s not sure that’s possible.
“Tony…” Steve mutters against his mouth while Tony’s hand slips lower and lower and lower, stopping at the bottom of his t-shirt. He rests his fingers there for a second, enjoying the delicious tension of deciding what’s going to happen next, before slipping his hand under the shirt and up the sturdy muscle of Steve's chest.
There’s a reason Steve doesn’t want to have this conversation right here, right now, while he’s supposed to be celebrating someone else's wedding. But there’s also a reason he can’t stop his thoughts from selfishly returning to that point. “The worst part was that I had finally told you how I felt about you, how I had loved you, and you had said you loved me, too. We were so close to telling other people--we were talking about marriage, for god's sakes--and then we were fighting and none of that mattered. Loving you didn’t stop me from hating you. And when it was all over and I was alive again, you remembered none of it. Even the good times didn’t matter, in the end.”
That tension just sits there for a while, quiet and exhausting; Tony’s instinct is to handwave any of that away--he has someone in front of him who needs help, and they’ve just handed him a new toy to play with. But…he can’t just ignore it, can’t just pretend he feels a little put upon to be taking this favor from Steve.
Tony puts the dildo on the nightstand. “No. It doesn’t.” He beckons Steve closer with a finger and a leer. Steve obeys and steps close enough that Tony has to crack his head up to get a good look at him. Steve’s hands fall to his shoulders as if he needs to be balanced. He’s looking at Tony with an unreadable glint that makes Tony want to dig into Steve’s brain and learn what he doesn’t see and what Steve doesn’t say.
“You should.” It would have the duel effect of dampening Tony’s little crush and giving him an extra person to help him badger Steve into being nice to himself. Win-win. “You deserve to be someone’s little spoon.” Steve actually groans and Tony can hear him roll his eyes. “Or big spoon, I’m not judging.”
“I don’t recognize it,” Steve says, but he’s smiling again and whatever had shocked him now seems forgotten. “Congrats on finding the one alley in the city of New York where I wasn't beaten up.”
It hurts to remember it, to reorganize the events of the day on tragedy. Doesn’t make it less true. With complete sincerity, he says, “She’d be proud, today.”
Steve takes a very big breath and closes his eyes. “Yeah, that’s it. And honestly, it’s not really a big deal. It’s a worthwhile trade. I get punched a lot. I’ll take being able to stay in the fight over an easier sex life.” His words have a practiced quality to them, like Steve’s given himself this speech many times before. He finally turns to look at Tony. Tony doesn’t like the look in his eye. And he definitely doesn’t like the way Steve said ‘sex life’.
Tony can imagine it in a way he never could before. He takes the image of Steve gently waking him in the morning with an understated smile and a cup of coffee and swaps himself out for Peggy. It sits right with him. It’s clearly what should happen. The rest of his imagination paints a comprehensive picture of Steve in a tidy, small house looking after well-behaved, adorable children. He’s had so many glances at what Steve looks like when he’s happy over the last month; it takes no effort to see Steve even happier seventy years before.
Tony looked from him to Wong and back and was dismayed to find neither of them laughing. “I don’t believe in magic,” he grunted and stood up. He had better things to do than to talk about Steve’s death and be the center of some odd joke.
Steve pulls himself away from Tony, just enough that his focus moves from Tony’s lips to Tony’s eyes. “That you would be interested in this.”
Luckily, he’s alone for now. He can think a little more clearly without Tony right next to him. He wants to believe he’s a forgiving man. He honestly believes he’s forgiven Tony and he knows intrinsically Tony’s forgiven him. But there’s something underneath all of that, something that defies forgiveness. Something that--
. Tony had said something about what it meant that he had talked with his father, and Steve seemed to understand that without judging it. Then Steve said
“Just wanted to see how you're doing.” Tony’s eyes dart around Steve's room. He’s uncomfortable and second guessing his idea to come here. “Oh, and Pepper wanted me to pass on her condolences,” Tony adds and immediately regrets it. Here they are, trying to process grief, and he’s trying to bring up his ex-wife with the guy he fucked last night. It sounds incredibly insensitive and Tony’s sure there’s really nothing he could say right now that wouldn’t sound that way.
The air goes out of the room. Tony could have sworn that the restaurant was playing some sort of jazzy number in the background, but he can’t hear it anymore after the sound of his own heartbeat. “No,” he squeaks.
Tony can’t remember the last time making out had felt so exciting on its own merits. A strange, surprising, and completely out-of-character thought jumped into his mind: he’d be ok if this was all that happened tonight. This is a fulfilling endeavor.
“I should probably get back to bed,” Steve unfortunately says. Tony becomes acutely aware of just how disappointed he is. “Tomorrow is going to be a long day.”
The only person Steve knew who could help was Tony Stark, and the man was notoriously difficult to find at the moment. Steve expected to have to shout for Jarvis when he entered the mansion’s doors, but he was surprised to find the hologram that looked just like Tony waiting for him on the stairs. “Tony?” Steve asked, because time was too precious to be suspicious.
Steve’s head tilted up and he tried to say something, and now I knew I hadn't heard because he couldn’t barely form words.
“I can do it, but I can’t guarantee that it’s going to be quick. I’ll give you a call when I’ve made some progress though,” he says because he was always going to do it, but he also wants this conversation to be over.
Natasha steps back from Steve’s embrace and places a hand on Tony’s armored back. “I don’t know. One minute I was falling, and the next minute I’m waking up in a war zone.” She’s taking it all in. This isn’t what she expected, clearly. “This means it really worked, right? There isn’t some catch I’m missing.”
Steve cuts Tony off. “It doesn’t have to mean anything Tony. I understand if it makes you uncomfortable. And I understand if you don’t want to see me.” He stands up to leave. It’s only fair that Tony has some time to process this.
The moan in the back of Tony’s throat must align with whatever Steve’s thinking, because he smiles against Tony’s lips and breaks the kiss. Before Tony has a chance to process and complain, Steve’s kissing his way down Tony’s bare chest until he’s on his knees. He even takes the time to untie the robe and let it hang open before moving lower.
say it. He was not sure how he ever thought he would remain silent if given the chance to talk to Steve again. “I was given the opportunity to bring you back, and I took it.”
“I have something to say.” Tony says it with conviction he desperately doesn’t want to feel. Somewhere in the back of his head he’s calculating distances to the Long Island mansion. He’s certainly not going to sleep here ever again.
, I’m going to come.” His hand is moving faster now with none of the elegant strokes he was using before. Tony takes it all in—from how Steve has his thighs spread open for him, how his mouth is slack with heavy breathing, and his eyes are scrunched up in pure focus. At this point he’s actively trying to avoid having an orgasm, but he’s not going to be able to for much longer. Steve’s moans grow harsher and pronounced as he struggles to take in enough air it feels like Tony’s pushing out of his lungs. “Tony, Tony, I’m going to...are you close?”
“Make a copy of your brain. Put it somewhere no one will ever find it. It’s too valuable to lose,” Steve pleads because he never wants to relive the moment Tony woke up and looked at him like the last couple of years had never happened.
Steve smiled, kind of sad and kind of sweet, and he edged himself down so that he was laying on his back. “Are you cold?” he asked, and looked between me and my just-out-of-sight armor.
That desperation drove him to plug in the cord just where the blue finger had pointed. He felt a jolt of electricity move up his arm when he finished, and heard a shaking gasp for air underneath the Iron Man mask. He startled, as much from the sound of Iron Man’s life as from the shock under his skin. “Iron Man!” he shouted, loud enough it reverberated around the small room. He wished he had a pulse to check. “Are you ok?”
Right now—under Steve’s open mouth—he has no doubt he’s a sex god. At least to the man winding his fingers through his hair.
Steve leans against one of the tables and the spot where his hip is pressed against the edge feels like a physical affront to Tony. “I know you’ve been busy,” Steve explains, easy and familiar. He’s looking around, taking in all the details of the workshop, leading Tony to follow his eyes and watch as Steve dissects--
He never thought much of it in the moment, but now he can’t forget Steve’s words as they were leaving 1970.
“Hiya, Cap,” Iron Man greeted him, already ready to go. “I sounded the signal. Looks like the Masters of Evil again and haven't heard from either Hank and Jan or Thor. I guess we’re on our own until we know more.” His voice was mechanical, filtered through the voice modulator he used to keep his secret identity.
“I don’t know,” Tony says. “I just don’t think we should be sending the guy with time displacement issues back in time by himself.”
Steve nodded once in response and let out a deep breath. “Good,” he said as he turned his horse around. “Good.”
skip a few beats, freezing the air in his lungs and acting as a poorly timed reminder that his heart was operating on borrowed time. “I’ll tell him that, too, when I get a chance,” Tony said in one quick breath. He needed to get out of here; he needed to be in his workshop, charging his life support.
“Anytime.” Steve gets up and turns off the light around the apartment. Before Tony can miss him, he’s tugging the blanket from underneath Tony’s body and covering them both with it.
‘As far as he could go’ ended up only being a few miles until he heard the sound of hooves rapidly approaching behind him.
Steve shakes his head, not like he disagrees but like he’s trying to dislodge a thought, and pushes himself up so that can sit and move his legs out from under Tony. “I used to wonder a lot if it would be different if we could do it all over again. Right from the beginning.”
“No,” he sobs because he’s never going to be able to look Steve in the eye without remembering what he looked like with bullet holes in his chest and stomach. He thinks of the incursions and the Illuminati and wants to vomit.
Manhattan lies in rubble, and Tony’s on his back staring at Steve and the shield raised above his head, and this is how he’s going to die--on the concrete, with the words
“Did you just say I’m right?” Tony scoffs at the idea Steve waited this long to say that out loud, but Steve doesn’t notice. “You can go see her,” he adds, when it becomes clear that Steve’s too locked into a memory to notice anything else. Tony feels a tiny bit of bitterness at not being apart of Steve and Nat’s wonder twin thing.
The hologram laughed, like it was a fond memory, and Steve wanted so much to trust it. Maybe if the circumstances of Tony’s disappearance hadn't been so odd and hush hush, he could. The laughter hung in the air for a second too long and ended awkward and abrupt. “So, anyway, Iron Man told me that you were asking about me and I figured a visit was better than a text.”
Instead of actually saying anything, Steve lifts his leg—the one Tony’s not reaching over at the moment—into the air. With a twist of his hips his ankle ends up somewhat not far from his head.
Steve lifts his head from where it’s resting on his folded arms. “Why?” Steve asks with furrowed eyebrows.
Steve smirks, honest-to-goodness smirks, and props himself up to his knees. “What’re you going to do about it?”
Steve bites his lip and stifles a silent chuckle before looking away. Tony has a hard time wrenching his attention from where Steve’s eyes were a second ago and it’s with effort he changes posture and looks up again at the sky. The spot over his shoulder—where Steve sits—becomes so magnetized that Tony puts all of his focus in
“I think it’s time to call it a night,” Rhodey says as he sits up from the cement and stretches. “Thanks for the pizza.”
“I know a lot of things,” he replied, not at all sounding like he had heard Tony’s dismissive tone. “I also know that you miss your old sheriff more than you’re willing to admit.”
Steve scowls, but also laughs for some reason, and Tony declares the situation saved. Steve dribbles a little bit of the lube on his fingers before laying the closed bottle on his abs and lifts one leg so far up he can hook his arm around it.
“A tree,” Steve replied and I can tell he was trying to keep the mood light. Not a good sign. “I had a rough landing.”
Orange lights dot his vision for a few moments and for a few seconds it doesn’t mean anything, it’s just a thing that’s happening irrespective to everything else, but he can only pretend for so long that that’s the case because the glow is rising and burning brighter. It looks like the whole kitchen, with its stainless steel appliances and glossy subway tile, is burning up. It looks like how Steve feels.
“I should go,” Tony says, barely above a whisper and more to himself than Steve. He’s tired. He’s sore. He feels every minute he has spent working on solving time travel today.
This is when he notices that there is more in the drawer. He opens it a little wider. “Huh?” he mutters to himself as he picks up a monstrously large red dildo. Everything except the color is frighteningly life-like: there are even two large testicles on the end and thick veins running through it. Tony waves it in his hand to find that it’s sturdy and silicone, and thick enough his hand can barely close around it. Based on its size, his initial thought was that it was a gag-gift, but it feels too expensive to be someone’s idea of a prank.
Steve’s eyes drift to the ceiling. “Nice…” His chest rises and falls frantically as he grasps at the blanket beneath him.
“I’m sorry for you loss,” Tony says, a little too loud and a little quick. It’s what you’re supposed to say to a man who’s just lost his wife. “Peggy was a wonderful woman. The world owes her a large debt for her service.” She had been a larger than life figure in Tony’s life and a person his father always spoke of with reverence. “I meant to go to the funeral, I really did, but something else came up.”
“Tomorrow, probably.” Tony’s not sure if that was something he was supposed to say aloud. His brain isn’t operating on all cylinders. He’s getting very strange vibes from Steve right now, parallel to the vibes he’d been getting since Steve showed up in his driveway with an idea too crazy to ignore. Tony’s not used to seeing him like this; there’s a strange ease in how he’s holding himself. It’s nothing like the tragically repressed man who showed up in 2012, or the almost sexless soldier who took over after SHIELD fell apart.
Tony watched him put gather things from around Wong’s home and arrange them to his liking. All the while Tony reminded himself that this would just be something to laugh about when he got home in the evening.
Where was he, anyway? If only I could get the armor moving, I could find him, and Thor, and we could go back to civilization and warm coffee. Did they even have coffee here? People, even? I hadn't seen anyone since I crashed.
. You know, I actually thought we were over this. But clearly that’s not true.” Tony’s eyes move from their reflections in the glass to the ceiling. “I want it to be, though. I don’t like that the SHRA hangs between us. And maybe you don’t ever want to let it go, I guess that’s not my call to make. But also maybe, someday...we can talk about it.”
“It’s ready,” Tony says. In a better situation it wouldn’t be the centenarian going on this untested trip. Tony’s brought up doing it himself a few times, just to make sure he did it right, but Steve shut him down every time. “Are you?”
It doesn’t matter. Knowing something happened is worlds away from feeling something happen and Tony can’t stop fucking feeling. Again, his attention is pulled upward to where he imagines Steve making their bed and tidying up their room.
“I can’t be with you.” Tony has the gall to say it through tears, as if he isn’t the one responsible for destroying one of The Last Good Things. “I can’t be in this relationship. It isn’t working.” He takes a step back and refuses to meet Steve’s eyes. Steve recognizes the sort of stand-off because it’s been like this before, it feels like it’s always been this way between them, and Steve can barely remember yesterday when all he could think was ‘I love this man’.
“People do not understand how powerful the truth is. They hide it behind stories and falsehoods for many reasons, but every time they do, they conceal something even bigger than the truth. They conceal their own strength.” Doctor Strange took a long sip of tea, providing unasked-for time for Tony to think about how Steve would have liked that sentiment. “I need that strength to bring your dear sheriff back to Timely. If you agree, you will have to forfeit your right to lie for the rest of your days.”
desire—he gets a good hold of Tony’s butt cheek and Tony may be spent for the night, but he still feels it in his toes.
Nathan pulls something from his pocket that could be a watch but clearly isn’t. “Because I need an assist, and you’re the smartest man I know.”
“Exactly,” Steve responds. “And since we also need to return Thor’s hammer, there are only two of us who can do the job.”
“Sleep well, Tony,” Steve mumbles. He sounds tired. Tony does one last victory dance over their night together while cataloging the events in his head. The idea that Steve’s into his prostate goes right next to Rhodey’s birthday in the ‘remember for future use’ mental drawer.
There’s a lot to unpack there. “I didn’t know that,” Tony replies, and he’s now wishing he’d taken the opportunity to steer the conversation in another direction.
The hologram snapped in and out again. “Do--see--ext--sion cord?” Almost every other word was cutting out.
Tony looks from Steve to her, and back again, unable to process what he’s seeing. He sees the exact moment Steve decides to believe his eyes, and the seconds after where he runs to her and hugs her so tight with his one good arm her feet leave the ground. “CLINT! BRUCE! THOR!” Tony shouts across the field. “SHE’S ALIVE!”
Timely was different than most places--even the doctor had said as much--but it wasn’t that different. No one would tolerate the way Tony wanted to hold Steve. No one would tolerate the things Tony wanted to say to Steve.
“What the hell are you doing?” Steve whisper-screeches. His eyes are big, surprised, and from this distance, very blue.
“All but one...” Steve holds out his hand, the one without any extra-proprietary time travel equipment on it, but pulls it away before Tony can even think to clasp it. He wraps his arms around Tony, instead, and pulls him close.
Steve was silent. Tony finally stole a glance at him and saw how the moonlight illuminated his hair. He had changed from his blood stained clothes. Without the blue vest and his sheriff’s badge, he didn’t look much like how Tony remembered him. Somehow though, Steve looked more like himself.
Less than three weeks ago, Steve asked Tony out on a date. It went better than Tony could ever dream and led to another date, and then another, and then a long walk in Central Park that didn’t end until the sun came up and Steve kissed him in front of the mansion. It was glorious and it was the most dangerous thing Tony was involved in right now, particularly because Steve had no idea Tony
“We promised to return them. We should do it sooner rather than later.” Steve settles into his command voice. It leaves Tony unsettled. He’s been spending more time with the other side of the man. The change gives him whiplash.
to care about is the implication that he might be the first person Steve’s had an orgasm with. It’s a very heady responsibility he doesn’t know what to do with or how to live up to.
, it couldn’t cover up for the fact that Tony Stark’s absence was beginning to draw attention and that Steve had a personal interest in where Tony was. The press, well, Tony could handle them. Steve, on the other hand, was Captain America and maybe his almost boyfriend, and it was clear he was running out of opportunities to mislead him from looking too far into his instantaneous disappearance.
They stay like that for a while, and right about the moment Tony thinks he might be able to sleep like this, Steve speaks up. “Would Pepper be ok with this?”
Yet, Steve says nothing. He’s still staring in a way that’s slowly becoming unnerving. Tony’s just about to press him on why he’s being so
Another beat. Tony’s seen a lot during his time as an Avenger. He still hadn’t been expecting this. “Enough.” He knows the theory and the limitations. “I know it’s never been done before.”
“About tomorrow,” Tony clarifies and he sits on his hands. “Returning to your old haunting grounds, and all that.”
, and scoots close enough to Steve he can throw his arm across his chest. Tony can’t say for sure if he would have thought it was his fault that he couldn’t give Steve an orgasm; he knows he can take these things personally. But Tony is absolutely certain what Steve’s trying to say, and it isn’t about Tony. “I don’t care,” he declares. He tries his best to look serious. “Or I do care, but not in the way you're thinking in that handsome head of yours.” He locks eyes with Steve to add to the effect. “I just want sex to be as good for you as it is for me. That’s all I care about.”
chest. He reaches to the floor to grab the towel Steve was wearing before without having to get out of the bed. Gently and with great care, Tony wipes away the come. He gives Steve’s shoulder a tug so that he lays on his stomach and makes it easier for Tony to clean up the lube between his butt cheeks. “Well, I am interested,” he says when he’s finished and the towel is back on the floor. He mentally refuses to elaborate on why because he wouldn’t know where to start. He’s not going to talk about his on-again-off-again crush or the obscene late night fantasies. He deflects, instead. “I never thought you’d be interested in bottoming.” He punctuates his point by laying a hand on Steve’s ass.
She just waves him off. “Whatever. I don’t need to know the details.” She rolls her eyes. “My question isn’t about your sex life. That part doesn’t matter.”
“Thank you,” Steve said, his voice gone distant and thoughtful, causing Tony to wilt as Steve’s mood shifted. “I hope he feels better soon.”
“I was born in nineteen-eighteen.” Simple, direct, to the point. Tony can do math, but he still wants to believe him when he talks with that sort of conviction.
, he thinks. It takes Tony a few moments to realize he's not supposed to be looking and snap his eyes back up to Steve's.
“Uh…” Steve turns so that he’s laying on his back, eyes straight on the ceiling. “We used to have to share a bed when we were on the run. Sam snores.”
Instead, Steve looked up to see Iron Man battling the Enchantress in a flash of light. For a second all Steve could think about was how amazing it was that Iron Man could fly, but then Iron Man was falling and falling and
But mostly he’s just quiet, like a ghost who’s forgotten that their soul has been left behind, who only knows how to get up and make toast in the morning and spend the rest of the day going through the motions. He exercises in the compound’s pool, even if Tony’s heart lurches in fear a little every time he sees him, even though he looks frailer everyday.
Steve ran as fast as his legs could go, and then even faster than that, faster then he knew, but it wasn’t enough. Iron Man crashed into the grass fifteen feet away with enough force that Steve felt the ground shake beneath him. “Iron Man!” Steve screamed. He almost tripped on the grass as he approached, and fell onto his knees right in front of the red and gold armor.
“Tony!” Steve called once he recognized him. “They’re telling me I was dead.” His voice carried across the town, drawing even more people to step outside or look out their windows.
“You just knew.” It wasn’t a question. A question would indicate that he was willing to believe what the man was selling.
Tony is, for the record, not ok with this conversation. He would like to exit it as soon as possible. “That whole ‘let’s start over again’ thing didn’t last long.” It had been a great couple of seconds while it lasted.
, he says, over and over. Tony can’t remember how exactly he said it. When it happened, he thought Steve meant he got some closure, just like Tony had with Howard. But now he isn’t sure. Was it wistful? Was that regret in his eyes? Was there more he wanted to say?
“Why won’t you speak to me?” There was a note of hysteria in Steve’s voice that Tony was sure he had never heard before.
He doesn’t, Tony can see, but he must feel it’s time to back down. There’ll be comments later, things Steve and the others will say that Tony will have to reject, over, and over, and Tony doesn’t want to do any of this. “Good.” Tony swallows. He’ll acquiesce to Steve eventually. That very thought hurts--he’s too weak, he’s too scared. “Is there anything else you needed?”
Tony watches him lay out the jacket and pass approval on Tony’s choice before beginning to thread the needle. “Here, let me do it.” Tony motions for Steve to handover the jacket and the patch. Steve does without asking for clarification. “You don’t seem too fazed by this time travel stuff,” he observes and is glad he can keep his eyes and hands busy with attaching the patch.
Is there an answer to that Steve will accept? All of Steve’s insistence is crawling on his skin and it feels like fingers wrapped around his arms, holding him down on the floor of the helicarrier. Tony would do anything to make it stop. “You’re right,” Tony says, avoiding the question, because the answer is he’s going to hyperventilate if he has to listen to Steve ask something of him for a few more minutes. Of course it’s Steve’s face he can’t look at, it was Steve’s face that loomed over him, it was Steve’s fast that forcibly tilted his chin just so he could place brunt kiss to Tony’s lips. “Just let me think about it, ok? It’s a big decision. I’d like some time to think it through.”
“No, no, no, no,” Tony cuts in to say. “This is a bad idea. You shouldn’t be doing this by yourself. We had an entire team before, and even that was chaos.”
The man fell to his knees, clutching his elbow tight, and no longer cast in the shadow from the sun behind him, I knew exactly who he was.
A third finger joins the other two. “Fuck…” Steve groans. Tony’s beginning to love how that word sounds coming out of his mouth.
“Tony!” I heard someone shout from a far distance, so far that even when I looked up to see the source I only saw a dark shadow on the horizon.
Doctor Strange smiled the sort of smile that communicated he had the upper hand. “It’s very relevant. It’s why I’m here, after all. I think this is a situation I can fix.”
, an unholy alliance of arms, abs, and whatever the name is of the muscle that sits between his shoulder blades.
Tony does a little victory dance in his head. Without losing his grip, he walks Steve backwards until Steve’s knees hit his bed and he involuntarily sits. “Good.” Tony feels very powerful in this position, very in control. He’s confident enough to slip the robe off his shoulders like he’s giving a strip tease. Steve’s wide-eyed and complete attention is on him. It’s intoxicating. Tony wants to bottle up this intensity and keep it to himself. He wants Steve to always look at him like this.
, the kissing is nice. When considered out of context, pressing your mouth against another’s is just weird. In this moment, with Steve? Every moment of wet lips and slick tongue reverberates around his body. Even each awkward clash of teeth is divine, a reminder that
“Do we need to talk?” he asks. He’s staring right at Steve’s reflection. There’s a certain aggression in his voice--the kind that tends to raise Steve’s hackles. Tony expects a fight instead of a conversation.
Steve answers quickly. He’s changed from his swimsuit into a pair of ocean-blue pajama pants. Of course, they’re blue, Tony thinks. Seeing them adds a new concern to Tony’s calculus. Maybe Steve was
Steve’s choice of restaurant doesn’t track for what Tony would think Steve would do. There are white table cloths and multiple forks and a wine list with bottles that cost more than one hundred dollars that Steve discreetly attempts to hide.
Tony plows on. “Because you seemed to be really enjoying yourself and then you got quiet and disappeared. Is this about the thing earlier?”
It must be, because Steve nods in acceptance and looks a little sad to hear it. “That’s ok, I understand.”
The compound is so huge, too large for just Tony and this conversation. He can’t help but bitterly think that the entire team should be here, hearing this. Even if Vision was here...this is Avengers business, above-his-pay grade type of crazy. “Are you saying in the future I invent time travel?”
Tony fell into place beside him. They walked in silence towards the town while Tony thought through everything. He decided to voice his biggest fear. “I don’t know how strong this spell is. And I don’t know what that means.”
“Thanks,” Tony says, already turning around and closing the door. His skin is buzzing. He sits with a huff on the bed and opens the drawer. In the front is a small, half-filled, bottle of water-based lube beside a box of condoms. It looks like there’s only a few missing, and they’re getting awfully close to the expiration date. Tony takes one, puts it with the lube on the top of the nightstand, and places the box back where it belongs.
Tony’s struck speechless. He’s too confused to know where to begin the line of questioning he needs, too overwhelmed to accept the premise of Steve’s words.
If that makes sense. Doesn’t really matter, most of his good sense abandoned him when he decided to preposition Steve, and the rest of it is melting out his ears as Steve closes his mouth around the tip of Tony’s cock.
“This thing?” Steve jostles it a little, probably to show it’s no big deal, but Tony sees him grimace behind the cowl. “It’s fine. I’ll live.”
Tony guides Steve’s hands to his hips. Slowly, and with much attention to detail, he feels his way up Steve’s arms and shoulders until can wrap his hands behind Steve’s neck. The robe and the swim trunks underneath are doing very little in separating him from Steve. The exposed triangle of his chest is smashed against Steve’s abs, his legs are just a few steps away from being wrapped around the flannel pajama pants. Tony winds a hand through Steve’s damp hair. It’s the easiest way to tip Steve’s head to the side in a way that mirrors how he tips his to the other. Like this, it’s not just their lips that are slotting together, but their mouths and tongues crashing with the need to be closer and even more closer than that.
“It’s a possibility,” Natasha concedes. “If you had asked me years before, I’d tell you he wanted to. Maybe he didn’t think he should, but he would have wanted that. Now though?” She looks around the room like she’s going to find some explanation. “I don’t think so.”
when Steve starts just laughing. They’re the big, full body, type of laughs. He laughs so hard his eyes squish shut and he slaps the sheets he was just gripping for dear life. “Are you serious?” he asks, his voice at an entirely different register than Tony’s used to.
Steve butt in before Tony could even finish his thought. “I’m sorry, Tony. I should have trusted you.” Seeing Tony now, happy to just know Steve didn’t doubt him, drove home how hurt he must have been when Steve did.
Wong smiled. The air in the room change somehow--it was now less stifling. “I bet right now you’re thinking about having one of those pies Mrs. Parker makes.”
“Yes, of course,” Steve says, probably not wanting to seem unreasonable. His counterpart, the one that took over the United States in the name of Hydra, never wanted to seem unreasonable, either. “Thank you for thinking about it, and let me know if there’s anything I can do to change your mind.” He reaches out his hand and just about makes it to Tony’s shoulder before Tony reflexively pivots away. His heart is beating out of his chest.
"Hey, Cap!" Tony responds with a little too much energy. He barrels on and asks, "How was your swim?"
Steve stays quiet for a beat long enough that Tony can tell he's really thinking it through, “If you’re sure,” he eventually says, climbs into bed. This time, it takes a little less time to get him under the covers. “Just so you know, I’m glad we’re working together again.”
Later, when they meet up at a diner, Tony sees Steve’s ditched his pants and traded them for a bright peach polo with a comically wide lapel and a pair of grey slacks. It’s an odd combo on him, and maybe more color than Tony’s seen Steve wear since they met, but now he fits in with everyone around him in a way Tony can’t say for himself. “Nice outfit,” Tony tells him and he slips in the booth across from Steve and takes a bite of one of Steve’s cheeseburgers without waiting for an offer.
They eat an entire large pizza while sitting on the bed preparing for the next day. On a pile of takeout napkins, Steve draws two maps--one of Camp Lehigh as he remembers it from the 40’s and one from the time him and Nat visited in 2014. They speculate on things like the type of security measures they’ll have to encounter, and settle on a plan that gives them a lot of room to improvise.
Steve leans into his arm for support and Tony walks him across the hall. “Thank you,” he says when Tony stops in the doorway.
“And who exactly was the other guy?” I saw at least one broken arm and the beginnings of bruises all over his face. Whoever they were, they got him good.
Doctor Strange waited a beat to speak that Tony was sure was only to increase the dramatic tension. “Your
“I take it you like how I’m touching you? Is that what you’re saying?” Tony smirks. He’s imploring his mind to remember every moan and every twitch and every time Steve’s back arches off the bed. He’s not going to get it up again tonight, but if they survive tomorrow, this is instant masturbation fodder. “I love the way your cock feels.”
Tony’s Tony, so he begins to babble again once the sheer shock of it wears off. “I’m dead. Or I’ve been uploaded to the Matrix. I don’t know. I don’t care.” He sways a little on his feet, stumbles forward a little, and Steve catches his hands midair to steady him. Even when Steve stands up, even when his face goes from inches from Tony’s junk to inches from Tony’s lips, he keeps holding them. All the while Tony’s going on and on about the possible alternatives to heaven he believes are the most likely to be where he’s currently existing.
Curiosity drives him to click the notification icon and wait patiently while the icon expands to reveal an Iron Man gauntlet, open wide to reveal a replusor in the center which glows, pulsating in a way that imitates a loading screen.
“It’s the only way I thought it would work for me,” Steve says before Tony can finish. He flips over onto his back so quickly the mattress bounces. With his eyes looking at the ceiling, he continues. “Since the serum, I don’t feel pain the way I used to. But it’s also the same with pleasure. I can’t come if I’m only jerking off. I need something...more, I guess.”
Steve nods and steps away. He pulls back the comforter from his bed and settles in on the same side he slept on last night. Tony places down the glass of water and takes his phone out of his pajama pants pocket before claiming his space on the other side of Steve’s bed.
As soon as Steve realizes what’s going on he pulls back a little but leaves his mouth open to catch the rest of Tony’s come on his tongue. Tony expects him to spit for some reason, Tony already came for godssakes, but Steve waits until Tony’s done and limp in his hand before he closes his mouth and swallows with a very obvious bob of his Adam’s apple.
Morgan would normally say something smart or giggle or at least she would smile, but she’s not falling for Tony’s half-hearted attempts at levity. He wants to reach through the screen and tell her it’s all going to be ok. Maybe tomorrow he’ll believe it.
Tony cocked his head, confused at how non-dramatic the experience had been. “You’re not going to take my blood, or something?”
Steve blinks a couple of times like he can’t speak Tony’s language. “I wanted to. We could have died the next day, and I’ve made a promise to myself to stop waiting so long to make a move.” He smiles, just a little bit, and adds, “Also, I wanted to know if I had it the first time—if I really just needed the right person, after all.”
“That would mean a lot to me.” Steve was looking out into the distance, completely unaware that Tony was in crisis. And how could he know? Why would he ever suspect that Tony Stark and Iron Man were the same man, and that Tony’s heart was so damaged that he hadn't been able to remove the armor for fear that he would die?
Steve understands. After so much war he appreciates the peace. “It was a beautiful ceremony,” he tells Tony, hoping to fall into easy small talk and distract himself from what’s on his mind.
“Yes,” Tony answers because the kiss and the ensuing sex was definitely was he wanted clarification on. “But I understand if it’s not your thing.” Tony isn’t even sure Steve likes dudes. He could have been giving off vibes earlier for a ton of reasons not related to sexual appreciation of the male body. Tony’s walking through the dark on this whole thing, letting his dick lead the way. “Really, I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have—”
Steve nods and organizes the newspapers. This is the moment where Tony’s supposed to decisively stand up and do something, but it’s a comfortable booth, they have a lot of time to find clothes before tomorrow, and Steve should really do something about that ketchup.
Tony cuts him off, his words falling out of his mouth to quick to be legible. “You didn’t do anything.” He tries, tries,
, he may have missed something. His hands fly to the zipper of Steve’s uniform jacket (because everything was zippers in 2012), and he manages to get it almost the entire way down before Steve captures both wrists.
, it was Jessica all along, why didn’t he see that, and why didn’t he see the vulnerabilities in everything he’s built?
Maybe Tony’s just projecting. Maybe he wants to get laid so badly he’ll read into anything. Maybe Steve’s feet are planted to the ground because he doesn’t want to sleep, not because he doesn’t want to stop talking to Tony. But that doesn’t mean he moves. Tony decides to be responsible for the first time in this conversation and tells him, “Good idea. See you in the morning.” He stands up on wobbly legs to show Steve he really means it—he’s really going to go back to his room and get in bed. So what if he doesn’t expect to sleep? He has the outline of Steve’s dick etched firmly in his memory.
Tony takes a good, long look at Steve. “Don’t you dare. That would be criminal.” He bends down so that he can kiss Steve. He knows he’s a little in his head right now, overwhelmed at the prospect of continuing. Steve might be expecting him to be good at this, but it’s been more than a decade since Tony’s been in these circumstances, he doesn’t have much going for him other than muscle memory.
“Tony,” Steve says as he opens the door wide enough Tony can step though. “What can I do for you?” His voice has a pinched quality, as if he’s trying very hard to sound normal as he speaks. Probably has something to do with his puffy, red eyes.
At least, Steve finally smiles. “Kind of. I woke up in the future and decided maybe my problem wasn’t that I needed to be with the right person, just that I needed to be with
Steve lifts his body off the bed like he’s decided he’ll just rub off against Tony and Tony decides that doing something is better than doing nothing.
Tony figuratively pats himself on the back for waiting until Steve has turned around before he takes in the broad expanse of muscle that is his back and thighs. Even Steve’s little ass is perfect. “Shit,” Tony mumbles to himself when the door closes after Steve. He knows now that if he returns to his room he’s going to entertain a simple fantasy where Steve would ask him to jack off in front of him and come across that perfect chest. Even the suggestion of the fantasy is making him hard.
Tony smoothed down the bristles of his mustache and watched the effect as his hologram did the same. It would never not be weird. “Now’s better than never,” he told himself. “Independent movement activate,” he told the computer. Instantly the hologram’s stance shifted, his legs stood a little closer together and his shoulder slouched just enough that Tony could tell the hologram was mimicking how he would hold himself outside of the armor, instead as he was now.
When someone is so eager to make you happy, the best response is to meet them halfway and make sure they understand how much they're appreciated. Which is exactly why Tony begins to a litany of barely parsable compliments. “You’re so good, so
feeling, but Tony could sense that there was much more to him then he would let on. He didn't like being left in the dark.
He clumsily kneels back on the bed, and this time his thighs are flush against Steve’s waist while his hands are on either side of Steve’s head. They kiss again. Steve’s fingers are making a mess of his hair as they use their grab to tilt Tony's head so that their noses pose no impediment to their lips. The other hand rubs up and down his chest, his back, and his arm. A thumbs flicks over Tony’s nipple, causing Tony to moan into Steve’s mouth and Steve to do it again. “Mmmm...that’s nice,” Tony mumbles. He breaks the kiss and lightly pushes Steve up and around the bed, following on his knees, so that Steve's head is on a pillow and they can lay longways on the mattress.
Tony stood up and started pacing. He had to figure this out soon so he could talk to Steve. “Ok, let’s try it again. One, two, three. Record.” Tony stopped where he was standing, mimed knocking on a door and waited a couple of seconds before asking, “How’re you doing?” to thin air. He paused before cutting off the recording with a movement of his hand and then motioned for the hologram to repeat him.
“Good idea,” Tony fingers the embroidery. “Are you nervous?” he asks, not even sure where the question comes from.
Not one second after Steve had finished asking, the blue, transparent hologram of Tony Stark popped up beside him. “Iron Man’s going to be just fine. He just needs some rest.”
Silence followed. Steve didn’t know what to say. Luckily, the thing in front of him did. “You may be wondering why I’m blue, and you, know…” he waved his arm and Steve saw the wall behind it the entire time. “See-through.” Steve nodded, because yes, he was wondering about that. “What you’re looking at is a hologram of me. I know you’ve heard that I’ve been missing in action, but I’ve just been working on a very important project “
Which is exactly why Tony swipes his thumb along the bottom of Steve’s lip, effectively solving the ketchup situation and making Steve go still as his eyes follow Tony’s hand back to his side of the table. “I swear that was necessary.” Now that Tony’s done it, it doesn’t feel very necessary. If anything, the weird hyperfixation problem he was having with Steve’s mouth as moved to the pad of the thumb that he’s currently thoroughly wiping clean.
Tears burn at the edge of Steve’s vision and one falls down the curve of his cheek. He uses the back of his hand to wipe it away, bites the bottom of his lip in order to gain some sort of control over the tightness gripping his chest. He’s torn between never leaving the tile he’s standing on and never coming back here again.
Tony can’t say it back, it’s not true. But Steve looks so hopeful and scared. He’s putting himself out there for this, and Tony can’t leave him hanging.
Tony stands up and goes through the motions of getting ready for bed. He tugs on some pajamas and brushes his teeth and sets an alarm for the morning. He has the worst kind of jet lag—technically he’s been up for twenty-two hours straight if you include all the time in 2012 and 1970—and the idea of laying in bed sounds very inviting and very terrifying at the same time.
“This should be illegal, it’s so fucking hot. You make it so good. Watching you—You’re so filthy. I wish I had a picture of this.”
“It’s a long story.” That wasn’t a lie. “Turns out Wong knows magic, and has a friend who thought I'd be amenable to giving up my ability to lie to bring you back to life.”
Tony doesn’t take the bait. “You can stay in your old room. I’m really sure your younger self wouldn’t mind.”
Steve walks slow behind him and Tony has to will himself to reduce his speed. “Don’t worry about it. I remember where it is.” More silence. Tony looks back at Steve, who’s trailing his fingers across the glass wall. “Even when my strength began to go, my memory didn’t.”
He’s looking at Tony like Tony hung the fucking moon and Tony wants him to stop and wants it to continue and wants a lot of things, really. He’s distinctly aware that when Steve leaves, he’ll be back to wondering the compound alone, waiting for Peter to call or Vision to return. “You’ve said all of your goodbyes,” he says and hands Steve the time GPS to slip around his hand.
Tony turns to find him sitting up and looking over Tony’s shoulder. “Hell no. Your couch looks lumpy.” Tony leans in for a kiss to clarify that’s not his reasoning, at all. “It’s just easier if he’s not hounding me for details,” he whispers against Steve’s mouth. With an exaggerated tap, he sends the message. “I’m setting my alarm for seven but you’re going to have to make sure I’m up by seven forty-five. That ok?”
The man smiled, enigmatically enough that Tony wasn’t even sure it was a real smile. “He also told me there was much good I could do here.”
The room nods. No one has a reason to disagree with the plan to build spatially disparate Avengers compounds throughout the world.
Tony looks at him, wide-eyed, and Steve can see the recognition of in his eyes. He’s already been thinking about the database of superhero identities he has stored in his brain and what a liability it will probably shape up to be, which means he’s already accepted that the quickest way to destroy that liability is to wipe his own brain.
, Tony thinks. He’s sitting on a ton of other questions, in addition to some quips and a few jokes, but he can tell Steve’s touchy about the whole thing. This is honestly more information about Steve’s life and history than Tony’s ever heard coming out of his mouth. If he pushes too hard, he might never hear any of this again.
It’s the address of a hotel in Times Square. “I have a photographic memory, you know,” Tony mumbles, but he still pockets the address. “It shouldn’t take too long. Maybe we’ll even have time for dinner.”
Steve shrugs and it looks so similar and so different to the actions of the man he once knew. “Trust me when I say I feel older.”
Tony wraps the cardigan around him and waits, knowing Steve won’t return unless he picks up the phone.
Steve’s completely naked and Tony’s completely not, so Steve’s hands urge Tony to take off his sports jacket. Then it’s the buttons on his shirt, but they take longer. Steve’s hands are clunky, his fingers huge, and it’s slow going as he goes button by button without opening his eyes or stopping kissing Tony. Tony’s sympathetic—he wants his clothes off as much as Steve does—so he shimmies around until he can push Steve on the bed. Steve lands with a thud and a creek of springs. He’s leaning on his elbows, staring right at Tony, and breathing heavily. Tony takes in the adulation with a grin while allowing himself enough time to finally see Steve. He looks as good like this as he had that night before the Time Heist, right down to his cock which lays heavy and hard against his stomach.
“You can stay, you know.” Tony’s eyes snap to Steve, who’s holding up his pajama pants like he’d rather crawl through glass then put them back on. Since he’s now getting an eyeful of buck-naked Steve, Tony’s inclined to agree. “You’re welcome to sleep here. I wouldn’t mind.”
He’s not finished with the question when Tony sees it begin—Thanos’ numerous minions are dissolving into dust in a way Tony’s used to seeing in his nightmares. The fiery battlefield around them is becoming emptier and emptier with each second.
Doctor Strange spoke before Tony placed his cup back on the table. “And there was a time you didn’t believe in sobriety, but look how things change.” Tony was stunned by the mention of his past drinking. For a few seconds he felt betrayed that Wong had said something about it, but the shame he experienced was stronger.
This is the first time Tony’s ever been up here. It’s a studio, and since it’s New York, it’s pretty small. The basics are there—Steve’s got a queen-size bed against the wall and a couch that works a room divider between the bed and the TV. There’s no kitchen table, but there’s a small desk by the window. It’s empty save for a cup of pencils. A laptop and pad of heavy drawing paper lay stacked on the low coffee table right beside a stack of coasters. A rolled-up yoga mat is tucked into a corner. The walls are white and bare; it’s possible Steve’s worried about not getting his security deposit back.
, around his cock. That really does it for Tony. “I’m going to—” He places a hand on Steve’s cheek with the goal of pushing him away before it’s too late, but instead he feels the head of his own cock through Steve’s cheek.
Tony finishes the prototype on a cold fall morning. He left the windows open the night before, and the unseasonable warmth turned to chill in the night. Before he starts the machine he shrugs on a cardigan Steve left folded behind a chair sometime over the week and wonders if he really wants to do this.
“Not really.” It sounds like Steve hasn’t really thought about it. “We can do it stealthily. It would be good practice for later.”
Tony’s not sure if that’s true. The serum has certainly extended Steve’s life considerably, already. There is no reason to assume he couldn’t wait it out.
Steve decides to do so and even lifts his hips so Tony can stack them below. Now, Steve's laying out with his thighs parted and his ass on display. “Better?” Steve asks, understandably frustrated.
Tony’s no longer looking out the glass at the stars. Steve knows he’s being watched, is being studied. “The joke I made about the SHRA.” He pauses to chew on his lower lip for a second. “You do know it was a joke, right?”
“Can I ask you something?” Tony asks. Steve nods. Tony looks from side to side, they’re still the only ones in the hallway. “You have to let me inside first, though.”
