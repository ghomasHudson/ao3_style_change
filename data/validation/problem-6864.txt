"Uck, okay, fine!" He growled, sitting up and huffing to the side of the bed, dramatically tossing pillows out of his way. "I'm up! I'm up! Gimme the coffee!"
Focusing on what was in front of him, Steve barked out a laugh. There was lettuce in Howard's hair. "He's your son. You know as well as I do that there's no controlling him."
Leaning forward, Michael puts his hand on Tony's shoulder. "I want you to comprehend the dangers completely before you make your decision. And no one will think less of you if you say no."
"Pep! Love of my life! Jelly to my peanut butter! Crackers to my cheese! Milk to my Lucky Charms! Conditioner to my shamp-"
"The old man, I know his death is weighing on you, but, uh, maybe you could do something nice for his family? That might help?"
But then Tony had told him about their first meetings. What Steve had said to him. And, damn, if that glass hadn't shattered loudly.
be supportive as well - though less likely - which is what Tony hoped for. It was inevitable that they would be found out. He was a scientist, after all, and the variables were against them. Howard was sharing quarters with the two, and something or someone was bound to slip. But, Howard was contrite over what he would turn into and that guilt might aid in softening his stance against a healthy - but still gay - relationship. If Tony were to be honest, he was more afraid of Howard finding out his own son was gay and not that Captain America was.
He heard a sharp intake of breath and hugged Tony tighter, bringing his hand up to cup the back of his head. "Tell me what I can do?"
Down the hallway, she lightly knocked on Steve's door. There was shuffling beyond, but no raised voices. Which was a great sign that what Rhodey had hoped -- what they all did! -- was reality. The door opened to a shirtless Steve, an equally shirtless Tony on the couch behind him. She raised an eyebrow.
If anyone used their heads, it would have been obvious. At least those in attendance were starting to put the pieces together.
"Fuck! Fucking hell! Steve!" His voice was growing hoarse, the combination of the two toys sending him close to the edge. He let go of his cock, determined to come just like his counterpart in the story.
Clint hid a laugh behind his hand, "Jovial?" He was ignored, but Howard appreciated the lightness, even if he didn't feel any better for it.
Looking up through his fringe, Steve squints like he can't quite make Tony out at first. His exhaustion is written across his handsome face as clearly as the bright A on the side of the building. "Hey," he says instead of answering, "what are you doing up?"
When Rhodey was finally allowed inside, he was calmer and more level headed. The fly over was filled with panic and imaginative scenarios on how Tony could have hurt himself this time. And just how bad it could be.
"What about this whole thing with SummerJam, and wanting to get back onto the charts?" Moving a few pages of sheet music to the side, Steve sat on the couch next to Bruce.
"We've got a good thing going here," Thor added, leaning forward to catch her eye, "we chart in the adult contemporary charts," he made a quick face at the wording but kept on, "and our fans have enough clout to sell out 15 to 20 thousand seat venues. Merch sales are high, VIP and Soundcheck continuously sell out...Natasha, we've got
Looking up, he watched as Bruce wiped his hands on a dishrag, walking closer to him, but Tony recoiled. Bruce paused, speaking again, "Tones?"
I apologize for how long this took to get up. On June 23rd, I went back to work and I haven't had much spare time to write. Please accept my humblest apologies!
Howard at least has the decency to look a little ashamed, "I thought it would make a fun adventure."
"JARVIS?" He's home. He's home, and he's alive, figuratively speaking, but it's harder than usual to calm his breathing and just accept that. "JARVIS,
As soon as the door clicked behind her, Tony swivelled to stare wide eyed at his bandmates, “The actual fuck was that?"
"You know," Rhodey said as the helmet came off, "I'm a little tired of being met out here by the rest of the Avengers. My heart can't take it. Just tell me he's okay?"
"Natasha then." He sat forward, crossing his arms and laying them on the table, "I'm sure you have good intentions, but we've been doing this since 1994. We pioneered the resurrected boy band phase, and
"Tony's right," Steve said, hugging him a little tighter. "I guess the best solution is the one that is the least painful to Howard."
He decided to take a page from Tony's book: blunt honesty. "Am I taking a risk talking to you?" It was a rhetorical question, and he continued on before Howard could answer. "Yes, I am. But Tony is my best friend, and I have a duty to protect him. Watch what you say, and maybe we can all get through this without a big green incident." He glanced over at Thor, who was busy pouring a gross amount of sugar into a teacup.
"Anthony." Tony shuts the door behind him and faces the interior of the room. A tall black man greets him with large and beautiful silver wings. "I am The Angel Joseph, head of The Protectors. Come in and please, have a seat." Joseph motions to a sitting area with a long, vintage couch with floral designs and a matching armchair. It's rather pretty for such a masculine guy, but then again, so are his wings. Somehow it all pulls together and makes Tony feel welcome and safe. Behind the sitting area stands floor-to-ceiling windows, and outside, a bright, blue sky expands forever outwards, the sun shining down on what looks like little villages.
Putting his phone down, he turned back to his laptop and was about to start when a noise startled him. He whipped his head around but saw nothing and narrowed his eyes on suspicion.
On the far wall, directly in the middle, was a large printed board with several paragraphs. Tony read it silently.
Grumbling, Tony let Steve pull him off the bed into a standing position, leaning on Steve with a rather cranky expression on his face. "That's kinda what I do."
"What did I do?" Howard's voice was quiet, reserved. All of this - how Steve was acting - it could only point to one thing. Howard wasn't an idiot, not by a long shot. He knew that these reactions could only be because he had somehow fucked up, done something he hadn't yet to make Steve Rogers hate him. It had to be bad to get this type of reaction. Something cracked inside him, and Howard felt sick. He placed his still mostly filled glass onto the bar. "Tell me what I did, Steve." He asked again, his tone subdued.
"Wait!" Scrambling to his feet, Steve lunged at Clint, succeeding in knocking his tea to the floor, but also getting his phone out of the archer's hands. "Do you mind?"
"We need to figure out where he's hiding." Steve spoke, his voice in Captain mode. They could see his fingers moving still inside of Tony. "So we can take him in."
He forgot his wallet at a restaurant. Forgot his cellphone on a bench in Gramercy Park. Forgot meetings, and dinners, to call Steve when he returned safely from a business trip. Sometimes he would forget where he put a tool, not five minutes after he set it down.
"Liar. You love me." Waking towards the door, she turned to say one more thing, "I think the next story will be about Steve walking in on you and joining you." She paused. "Don't change your clothes, you'll just get messy again." And she was gone.
"I don't know. I guess we'll have to see." Laying his head on Steve's chest, Tony swallowed. "There's something else." He pulled back to look at Steve head on. "I want to tell Howard about us."
Both rode through the high, eyes shut and breathing heavy enough that the hot breath of the other tickled their skin. When they finally slowed to a stop, Tony collapsed on top of him, chest heaving with the exertion. Steve wrapped his arms around him, holding him tightly as they came down.
; it tickled him pink, honestly. A friend of his had told him - some years ago - that the first time your child calls you
Tony continued, a small blush starting to creep up his neck. He was making himself vulnerable. Showing his belly to Steve. "So, I guess what I'm really just trying to say, is: Will you let this stranger stay the night?"
Thor studied him, taking in the similarities between his appearance and his friend's. That was where the likeness between them ended at first glance. Save for a love of science, Thor could sense that any other resemblance was superficial at best. Sense of humor? Most likely. Masks? Definitely. But everything Thor knew of the man was unsavory. Despite the outward personality and showmanship he'd seen in the clips of Howard on YouTube that were eerily close to his son's, Thor was aware of the contrasts between them. Their hearts, for one.
Ignoring her, he continued, "I figured out it was one of you because whenever I mentioned a kink I have, it ended up in the next story. I figured out it was
"Tony." Steve laughed softly, "Tony, it's not stupid. I get it. But you're not going alone, Natasha said she'd take you. And I'll be home tomorrow night, or sooner if I can swing it. Scout's honor."
"Sir," JARVIS' voice spoke up, "Agent Romanoff would like me to inform you that she and Agent Barton have acquired nourishment in the form of processed pork. I believe that means hot dogs."
"I'm a rich bastard, what did you expect?" Tony retorted instead, bouncing on his toes in anticipation as the coffee maker began sputtering its final descent into completing his ambrosia.
Tony was called back into the doctor's office the next Wednesday, but unfortunately, Steve had to leave the night before for DC. He apologized profusely, kissing Tony again and again, "It's fine, you'll be okay, I promise, you're going to be fine."
When she left, he got up, stripping and joining Tony in the shower, carefully and gently showing him how much he loved him through physical touch.
Pouring two glasses of milk, Thor handed one to Tony and sat next to him. "I believe in celebrating the little things. Smelling the roses, right?" He asked, looking to Tony for confirmation that he used the saying correctly. Tony nodded. "Cake is glorious. And it gives us a happiness that can lift our spirits, if only for a few moments. But sometimes, that is all we need, no?"
"Then tell me," Thor responded slowly, "what is it like?" Howard Stark was retreating, backtracking under the gaze of the large warrior in front of him. There was no way - unless they had told him - that he knew precisely who Thor was and exactly what he was capable of doing. In that respect, Thor's size was an advantage. Even if he were mortal, he'd be formidable and daunting.
"I'd like to see that someday. Would you fuck him raw, Thor? Would you fill him up? He loves to be filled." Steve teased, and stilled the vibrator, pushing on it so the tip was pressed into the one area that made Tony keen like a wild animal. He was undone. The legs in the air behind Steve shaking, his hips undulating, trying so hard to hump back onto the toy, to gain as much pleasure as he could from the amazing buzz that rocked his body.
Clint closed his eyes, sighing. "That's not what I mean, Nat. He would feel he had no other choice. Tony isn't controllable; he doesn't like people speaking or acting
"It is though, Pep. I'm the same way. Hypothetically speaking, had it been his father and not mine, I might've done the same thing."
"You've gained some weight, which is good, and your skin is a bit more like a living person's." Avery said with a small smile, checking his chart. "We have your test results back."
Steve groaned in frustration, balling up his fists to rub at his face. What did any of that matter if all it did was drive a wedge between them? All he needed to do was apologize and keep his mouth shut from here on out. Tony loved him.
Tony leaned over, interrupting in his usual way, "Stevie! Selfie!" It wasn't like Steve could ever say no to him, so he flashed a cheeky smile and leaned close to Tony. He didn't care what the photo looked like, to him every picture was a memory, good or bad.
Tony feels all the blood drain from his face. No. No, he did not just out himself. He can't do this. It was okay when he didn't think Steve loved him back - and
Steve crossed his arms, looking amused and concerned at the same time, a vision so wholly Steve it had Tony almost laughing. But as hard as he tried to smile or crack a joke, he couldn't. His eyes spilled over.
One last kiss and Steve was standing, pulling reluctantly from Tony, grabbing his go-bag, and headed towards the door. "If I can, I'll call. But Tony," he looked at him sternly, the concerned boyfriend all the way, "don't stay up all night waiting."
It takes Tony about a half-hour to shower and dress. It's a practiced routine—one he had done to perfection for years before it was cut from his life by the Ten Rings. Hot water became a distant memory, scented soaps and lush conditioners, an unattainable dream. He scrubbed and washed as quickly as he could before his captors could come banging. Being home, he imagined a long luxurious soak in the tub, meticulously cleansing his body and savoring the privacy his own ensuite bathroom afforded him.
Also, yes, is this a fic within a fic? Fiception? Yeah, probably. Will Leonardo DiCaprio make an appearance? Probably not.
The little efficiency apartments they each stayed in were comfy, cozy, and high tech. Spacious enough for a small living area as well as their beds, and an alcove that housed a mini-fridge, a sink, and a small stove, with a line of three cabinets above. They each had their own en-suite bathrooms and medium-sized walk-in closets. But for all Bruce cared, it could be a box. What made it home was Tony and the other Avengers. And he hadn't had a home in so,
Steve had started a fire, busying himself over the hearth to pull some warmth into the bedroom. As he closed the grate, Tony stirred, quietly shifting on the bed, and tugging the blankets up to his ears. He was cocooned on his side, his head pillowed on his left arm. The red glow of the flames peaked through the dark bedroom and played with his skin tone. Olive and ember. Fire and earth.
"We got this," she said, turning down the happy act enough to set them better at ease. She could effortlessly play the part of overly excited manager; that worked on the new acts and the old ones too dumb to realize, but not these guys.
Tony swallowed. How exactly did Natasha know so many details of their dinner? Their conversation? How Tony had tucked himself into the hoodie for warmth?
"We all will." She said, choosing a line. "We'll take turns. It'll be good for us to learn how to make something other than Top Ramen."
He feels the blood rush from his face. "Captain America? Look, I get the fascination, but my father couldn't find him—"
Rhodey snorted, hiding his lips from the rest of the establishment behind the menu. "If only she knew you take it up the butt."
The feeling of Tony’s cock, heavy and hot against his tongue, had Steve shivering, his own erection trapped inside his pants. With a pop, he pulled off, leaning onto his haunches to undo his pants and pull out his length. Tony stared down at it, mouth agape, a little bit of drool leaking from one corner. "Do you want a taste, Mr. Stark?"
Steve sighed, knowing he was right. "We can alternate. Because there's no way in hell I'm sleeping without you."
Nodding, Bruce continued, "Almost done. I'm giving you the abridged version here. Howard's willingness to sacrifice himself to save his son is what finally endeared him to Steve. All of us, really. Which would be fine and dandy if Tony hadn't locked himself in his suite as soon as we returned. So he
Tony kissed his head gently as Steve panted, "I'm okay with you waking me up to do that whenever you want."
"I eat!" At the disbelieving look she sent over to him, he amended his statement. "I'll have you know, I went to lunch with Steve."
Not that it didn't feel good, because it did. Being inside Tony was exactly like what Steve thought heaven felt like.
"Then I wholly thank you for bringing me to bed. My hero." When he finished in the bathroom, Tony had every intention of stripping Steve and having his way with him. But as he stepped back into the bedroom, he found that Steve had beaten him to the punch. He was lounging in the bed, hands behind his head, naked as a jaybird.
She made an offended noise, "Really? Where does Tony come into that equation, huh? Why does he get pancakes?"
Clint clunked down next to Tony and started undoing his seatbelt. "So? What else is new? Welcome to the dark side, Dr. Banner."
"I'm not." Together, they worked off Tony's sneakers and socks, though Bruce let Steve tug his pants off. He folded and placed them on the dresser as Steve somehow managed to get the sweater Tony wore off over his head. "I'm not exactly happy you three decided to go galavanting around blowing things up, but..." Pausing, Steve kicked off his own pants and grabbed a pair of pajama bottoms he had discarded when they woke him up. "But," he continued, tugging them on and tying the drawstring, "I can understand that Tony needed it. And you."
Drawing in a shaking breath, Steve's eyes flickered down to his thumbs again. They were still perfect. Still unscarred. He had used them countless times to pull Tony's fingers away from his own flesh, to still that incessant picking. Sometimes using gentle ministrations to clean and bandage the tips of Tony's thumbs, kissing away the pain and soothing the sting.
"Am I?" From somewhere by his hip, Steve picked up a bottle of lube, popped it open, and slicked himself. "Am I still lame?"
"We like clichés." Natasha smiled and made a 'go on' movement with her hands. As he opened the sliding glass doors, he heard her whisper, "movie's about to start! Dim the lights!"
Steve clenches his jaw shut, pulling in air through his nose with fury. It's not a good look for him. "God, you're such a prick! It's a wonder I fell in love with you at all!"
"Not particularly." But Michael takes a deep breath and snaps his fingers. The pain is jarring, and Tony can't help himself. He screams.
Leaning up onto his knees so he could watch his cock stretch and disappear into Tony's tight hole, Steve's fingers spread Tony's ass. He wanted to watch. Wanted to see his cock pulse through his orgasm and pump Tony full until it leaked out. He traced his index finger around the taut rim, smearing his milky precome up and down Tony's crevice.
Shrugging Coulson off, Tony stands, uncomfortable with the topic. "I'm a narcissist; I'm a jerk—a spoiled playboy."
"Steve," Natasha said gently, "It's not cancer. I know we've all thought it. If it's this then he's not dying. Pray for celiac, because believe me, this is a good thing."
"No, I need to stand." Letting the cord go, Tony ran his fingers through his hair, tugging at the ends. "I tried to tell you this when I was sixteen," he began, unable to look Howard in the eyes, "but I was too afraid of what you might do."
He froze. "Uh. Hi. Look, listen, this isn't a good idea." Slowly, he started to back up, the Other Guy stirring in his mind.
"Good!" Tony was already grabbing a fresh pair of pajamas for himself, "because you started this," he gestured to his crotch with a coy grin, "so you need to finish it."
"Tony, what's going on with you?" The professional tone was dropped, leaving behind a voice that was caring. He was still her friend. She loved him fiercely.
Steve cuts her off. "He's dead, Nat. Tony's dead!" It hits quickly, the acceptance, and Steve feels the hot tears he was holding back spill over and slide in fat drops down his cheeks.
"Oh! Great! Let me- let me get a shirt on!" Turning from the door, Steve beckoned her inside. She stepped over the threshold and let the door click shut behind her.
He still maintained his own quarters, even though he spent every night and most of his days in Tony's penthouse. Hearing that Tony was calling it theirs was fantastic.
"I'm okay." Looking up at him with worry and longing on his face, Tony placed his hands on Steve's chest, pushing him back just enough to slip away. "I'm fine! Get your shield!"
had happened between her and Howard. He had walked in just as they were finishing lunch and aside from offering him the rest of the
"Taking out a piece of garbage like Paulie, or any of those rats that disgraced my mother," he turned back to Steve. "It feels good, don't it? Like ya taking the trash out."
"Shit indeed," he half chuckled, "guess that the cat’s out of the bag." They were deep in the back room of the New York Public Library, a hidden room of magical and cult related texts, hunting through the old tomes to find anything to send Howard back to 1961. They weren't making much headway.
Sighing, Steve stepped off the elevator and turned toward Tony's suite. When he answered, he kept his voice low, just in case they were overheard. "I thought about it. But SHIELD may complicate things. I'm here for Tony - we all are. If it gets out of hand, that is - if it looks like he needs a professional to speak to, then we will. For the moment, the less people that know, the better."
But Howard freaking Stark, man, he wanted to let loose on him. Did it really matter if who Tony was in love with was the same gender as long as he was happy? Bruce didn't think so. But then again, he wasn't from the sixties.
"No, right. That makes sense." Bruce heard the rustling of bed covers, "It was such a shock, we didn't think of it. That's," he paused again, "that's really irresponsible."
Tony turned to face him, eyes wide and searching to make sure Steve wasn't followed. His threw his arms out in fear and confusion, "What the fuck?!"
! Because of the wonderful things he does!" A few passersby joined in, "We're off to see the wizard! The wonderful wizard of Oz!" More flashing, but Tony didn't care. Let Connor Caruso take a picture of them now! He so seldom laughed like this anymore, and it felt really good. Something about Steve made him feel younger and more joyful. Something he was only realizing that he missed desperately.
"All wounds remain with your mortal body," she answers simply, flipping pages, signing, and stamping. Tony tries to see what they say, but she's too quick. Slamming the file closed, she grins at him. "This is always so exciting for me. It doesn't happen often, you know. And two in one day! Well, Rhonda had Ho Yinsen, and I honestly don't expect him to accept, but
It's on every single news station, and Steve can't reach Tony. He's growing frantic with every unanswered phone call. Hitting redial each time Tony's voicemail picks up, his panic edging up his esophagus.
Across town, in the AirBnB that they had rented for the week, Steve was making coffee and half listening to the news. At the dining room table, Thor had spread the contracts out, going over them with a careful eye, and Bruce sat on the couch, lazily strumming his guitar and singing a few bars here and there.
Tony sits on the couch, craning his neck to take in the rest of the room. The walls are pale grey, with small, glittery designs woven into the wallpaper, and the exposed beams are painted white. It's open and inviting.
Nat came in through the vents. She wasn't the least bit ashamed, Steve and Tony would understand the need for secrecy. She had to observe first, to see in the flesh what Steve had told her over the phone.
Steve let out a breath and slightly adjusted himself on the seat. "Like this?" With another hard smack to color the smooth skin even more so, he pulled the toy up and out, using the fingers of his left hand to trail down the crevice of his bottom and pull the rim further open, and jammed the toy back and back out, picking up the speed and angling it as best he could through his lust filled haze.
Tony just shrugged, "Doesn't matter. They made up for it," he said, indicating his mother, Jarvis, and Ana. "It wasn't all bad."
"No," Tony moaned, his hips still rocking and undulating, milking Steve and bringing his arousal back up, his erection not waning as Tony continued to move up and down, clenching and unclenching, slow and deep. "Not yet. I want to come on you, but only-" He moaned long and low as Steve arched his hips to drive deeper, and offset the angle enough to drag against Tony's prostate. "Fuck! Only after you've -- oh god, Steve! -- you've filled me again!"
"Nat's been growing rosemary, basil, thyme, and parsley." He answered, opening the fridge again to grab the garlic and butter. "Get the salt for me, por favor?"
“Tony, just wait until the first time my temper flares over something stupid! Or how I hoard food like I'm never going to eat again.” He shook his head disparagingly. “And the nightmares, don't get me started on those! Tony, damn, Tony." He threw him arms out, giving it all he had. "We're all a little bit of a mess. But that doesn't mean you're not good enough."
long (and no, random sex didn't count) meant that as soon as someone offered him love, Tony flung himself at it.
At first, Rhodey worried that Tony had taken his stress out on the polishing, but the apartment just hadn't been lived in since it was last professionally cleaned. There was Malibu. And there was Tony after. Deep into darkness and only concerned with his bed.
In the office, Tony was huddled in another of Steve's hoodies; he was wearing his own jeans, but they were belted tighter to fit him. What was once a pair of blue denim tailored to fit his curvy and lean frame now hung off his hips and looked almost sloppy.
. As much as she witnessed for him, he witnessed for her. You couldn't touch their bond, and no one tried to.
Steve tried to push the thoughts away as he stepped under the stream of hot water, but they wouldn't budge. Howard reminded him of Peggy, and not the Peggy who was losing herself to Alzheimer's in a hospital across the ocean, but
"Asking Google, Stevie?" Tony wasn't sure why he teased Steve so much. Did he consider it flirting? Was it flirting when the other party had no idea you were into-
"I love you," Steve breathed as Tony began to move. He had more to say, but the pleasure coursing through him as Tony's hips rocked took over every single thought in his head. He let his hands rest on Tony's thighs, mouth agape as Tony's insides clenched around him, sliding him in and out, the heat building between the two of them.
The battle is lost, and Tony dissolves. His sobs turn into wails as he beats his fist against the bedsheets. He's on his side, held up by one of his elbows. The sheets pool around his waist, t-shirt is riding up in that annoying way it does, and his pajama pants are bunching up around his knees even more annoyingly. How did he even get into bed? How did he get into his pajamas? How did any of this,
it. Steve would be lying if he said the following he had of Avengers fans didn't make him swell with pride. Obviously, he knew it was bordering on bizarre, but he wasn't one to dwell on inconsequential things like that.
Tony had to admit a certain relief at that. This was the most stable relationship he had been in, and it was the forever type. He didn't want to impede his one chance at true happiness. They would come out when they were both good and ready, and not a moment sooner.
Laughing, Steve took a swig of his beer. The heat radiating off the warming grill warped the air above it. There was corn wrapped in foil already cooking, and a salad that Tony had spent two hours trying to meticulously chop sat in the middle of the table. A late dinner after a mission in Jersey. They were tired, but the summer air was rejuvenating. With Howard as their new ground control, and manning a command center in the tower, it meant things went smoother than any other had in previous years. "No, I'm definitely not sorry," he admitted, eyes still on the door Tony had disappeared through.
-- I need to process this! I need-" Howard reached for Tony, his arm lifting, wanting nothing more than to apologize and beg for forgiveness. Tony's hand shot out quickly, so ready to accept Howard even though it was
Tony gasped, tilting his neck as Steve kissed down it, focusing on the point right above his clavicle. "Whatever you need, fuck, ah, Steve. Anything!"
"Okay, well. Good night." It was stiff, and Tony glanced back and forth between them, watching as Howard let himself out.
"Hey! No fair, you're taller than me!" He jokingly scolded, sticking his tongue out at Steve. Maturity was never his strong suit. With a grin, he hopped, changing the pace into a skip, "We're off the see the wizard!"
"She's a spitfire, but a good heart. If you're alive, it means she likes you. All right," he moved to the door, "let me get changed. Don't kill each other." He pointed back and forth between the two of them. "I really don't want to clean up all the blood."
"If you don't mind," Hill interrupted, standing abruptly and shoving her hands in her pockets, "we don't have much time."
Steve barely had a second to react as the dragon heaved a deep breath and let loose a roaring stream of fire. He ran and jumped, launching himself off of an abandoned taxi onto an awning, just missing getting singed and swaying to regain his balance. "Iron Man! Sitrep!" Across the street, a building burned, glass from the storefronts and apartments above shattered on the streets. It had to have been the explosion he and Tony felt, and Steve prayed silently that no one was inside when it happened.
"I'm CEO, but you still own the company." The chastise was light, but still made her point. If he needed time, that was fine, but he had to make some form of arrangement.
Without a second glance to it, Steve shoved the Phoropter away and swung his leg over Tony's, straddling him. "I can definitely do that. Custom fit, just like I said." Slipping his hands down Tony's spine, he lifted his back from the seat far enough that he could grind against Tony's surprisingly svelte and toned body. Tony’s hands flung up to Steve's hair, mussing it as his fingers sluiced through the blond locks, tugging him down to press their lips together.
"Good news. I was fucking myself when I figured out it was you, only a few hours ago. With both toys at once. So not much prep work."
"That's right. My beautiful slut. You love this, don't you?" He smacked him again, jerking his fingers just right to send Tony moaning and clawing at the carpet.
a statistic. And I did throw myself at the first kindness he showed." Pushing himself up, he turned to finally face Steve. "I'm lucky this Howard seems to be a good guy. The one I knew would have taken advantage of that."
But everywhere he looked, he came up with more and more dead ends. He had tried hacking the account himself, but everything kept going wrong. His computers would freeze, the websites would crash, all stupid things that made no sense. It was his technology, for fuck's sake, why wasn't it working? He had even tried to get Jarvis to do it, begging the AI to 'Just hack the fucking account already!' But all he got was the run around.
"It's okay, Howard," Steve came to the rescue, and the look on his face spoke volumes of how far he'd come with him. "It's nice to hear you're okay with this. With us."
careers only, with the exception of resurrecting one. I'd like to see you work with an act with a considerate fan base but not much weight in the industry anymore. A real challenge." He held up the folder, "And I'd
And stopped. It still smelled like Steve. And wouldn't that be perfect? Getting off while surrounded by the scent of the man he was hopelessly in love with?
has quite suddenly slammed into Tony at the same speed he slammed into the desert. A litany of one thing after another, things he hadn't entirely processed like he kept claiming. He leaned on his genius to think his way through the whole situation, discounting that his emotions might just have something to say about it. "No, JARVIS, I am not fucking okay! I'm dead! Do you hear me? I'm dead!" He covers his face, trying in vain to keep the laughter from turning into sobbing. "I don't know what I was thinking, Jay, becoming a guardian angel? Am I out of my fucking mind? I can barely take care of myself!"
The woman on the television shuffles the papers in front of her. "Just in, the US Coast Guard is reporting that there are no survivors. Again, Singapore Air Flight 328 out of Singapore has gone down off the coast of California. And there are no survivors."
If it was at all possible, Tony sat up straighter. "IQ of 270. I'm one of the most intelligent people in the entire world."
Tony would yell at him later, that was for sure. Something about not being a damsel in distress or along the lines of
Tony's smile was free and sweet, and he cupped Steve's face, leaning up to peck the tip of his nose. "I love you too. Let's never break up again. 0/10 would not recommend."
strong. His history included Norwegian parents that emigrated before he was born, a slight accent from his raising, and an arrest for a bar fight that was rumored to have ended with him using a taser on some guy and laughing about it. But everyone she spoke to had said he was
"Gross," Tony curled his lips up in mock disgust, grabbing a throw pillow that had fallen off the bed to toss at the Steve shaped lump under the blankets.
"We should cook here, and more often. See if we can't choose healthier options, maybe that'll help. If not, we drug him." Steve snapped his head towards Natasha at her words.
The smile died on Rhodey's face as he traded a concerned glance with Steve. "It's me!" He called back, walking to the doorway of the galley-styled kitchen and leaning in.
?" Tony said, lifting his foot, soiled spats and all, over the arm of the chair again. He was a king. He did what he wanted.
He should have been thinking about the music, but Steve's thoughts turned, as they often did, to his missing best friend. A man he grew up with and served with, who had vanished two weeks into their return from Kuwait. He had never stopped searching for him.
"Let's see if this doesn't pan out first." Tony was moving a bit too much under Steve's hands, his cock rubbing against the front of Steve's dress pants, hitting the soldier's own erection and making it hard to concentrate. He gripped Tony's ass hard with his left hand, digging his fingers in and warning him to stop moving. "I'd rather not deal with more property damage."
"Tony, no!" The repulsors fired twice before the dragon, still controlled by Large and Beady, swiftly spun, its tail reaching high, and knocked Tony right out of the sky. He landed hard, skidding across the pavement and bouncing over the curb before he came to a silent stop. "Tony! Iron Man! Report!" Without a single thought to himself or anyone else, Steve took off in a run. Tony was too far, more a block ahead, and the dragon was closer. "Take him out!" Steve screamed, pleading for anyone on his team to act, "Take him out! Don't let him near Tony!"
She ignored him and hit Bruce's name in her contacts. When he didn't answer, she sent him a text and tried Thor instead. "JARVIS," she spoke into her phone, "Can you connect me with Thor?"
He wiped himself up with quick movements, not doing the most thorough job, but enough that he could slip his clothes back on and disappeared out the door, returning several minutes later with a package of wipes. Tony was sleepy and sated in his arms as he cleaned up their come from his body, careful to wipe him down gently. After they dressed, both took turns in the bathroom washing their hands and straightening their clothes. The waiting room was suspiciously empty.
"So, what do we do?" Nat asked, tucking her leg underneath her body and leaning toward Hill. "Damage control?"
The butter knife was sticking out of the wall, handle still vibrating with the intensity of the throw. Howard felt the blood rush from his face.
"The point," Howard sighed and sat next to him, "is that I know I made a mistake in coming here. But we can't change that now. Steve, I--" He turned, peering up into Steve's face, "--I will do whatever it takes to make this better. I keep screwing up, and even if you don't want to hear it, you have too. We're human," he shrugged, "we're not impervious to mistakes. But if I know one thing, it's that you belong with Tony. And he belongs with you."
Grinning, Steve tries and somehow fails even more than Tony. "Tongue twisters were never my forte," he's giggling madly, and it's adorable as much as it's a relief to see. Steve will never look like he did at the kitchen island ever again, not if Tony has anything to say about it. His belly flips with just the mere thought of working to keep Steve happy. He's aware he has it bad, but he's more than willing to stay as they are if it means Steve will let him help him.
"Done!" It was hard to contain her excitement--she loved a good challenge, "Deal!" Standing, she gathered her briefcase, gesturing to the file still in Tony's hands, "You keep that, look it over. You guys won't regret this." Snapping the case shut, she stood tall and proud, conveying every bit of confidence she could. They reacted well to friendly and straightforward; she would stay along those lines. "Send me
Steve's grin widened. He loved Tony like this. And he was going to wait as long as he could before letting Tony climax, because it would be explosive, earth shattering, it would send Tony to the stars and back.
When he was finished, he stood in the middle of his bedroom and contemplated. Bruce and Clint were sure to know he was awake, which meant they were sure to interrupt him. Which also meant that Natasha, Thor, and Steve were probably awake as well, and though Steve was most likely not an issue, Natasha and Thor didn't seem to understand the etiquette of knocking before entering.
"Tony," sighed the quiet man above him, his arms around the genius closing tighter, "You have no idea how much I want you. Don't ever think I don't." Tony felt his lips on the top of his head. "I want all of you. Everything. But you gotta let me in. We can't start this-this wonderful thing we're starting if you have doubts. About me or about you."
Steve's eyes slid closed. So much for secrecy. He heard Tony sighing in his arms and gingerly set him on his feet.Tony shifted on his toes and kissed Steve's cheek.
Steve was thoughtful for a moment, seeing the opportunity for what it was: An olive branch. "You wanna do something together?"
Steve was quiet for a moment, contemplating. "Awful," he answered truthfully. "It would have been so much worse. But the public, knowing about time travel? Where do we draw the line? We'll know who he is -- it would just be on paper."
"What I'm saying is, it wouldn't be remiss if the dark side also had cake. Specifically, your cake." Tony was listing to the side, and Clint gently propped him up.
As much as she longed to hightail it back to the safe house upstate or the one in the Rockies that even Clint didn't know about, Natasha knew she couldn't. If there was one lesson she had learned from the Red Room that applied to everyone and not just assassins, it was that when the storm comes, don't run for cover. You can't keep the rain from falling; it's better to face it head on than get swept away with the flood.
"See, that's the opposite of what I should be doing." The carpet under his back was itchy, but Tony didn't move. He had a point to make. "Coming out, that is. Seems counterproductive."
"Down kitty," Tony can't help himself. She raises his hackles like no one in this place has. He feels his palms start to sweat, but it has nothing to do with her and more to do with the obsession Howard had that ruled Tony's childhood. Coulson should know this. "All I'm saying is, I don't—Ugh. Just...explain. Why are you still looking for him?"
"Come have dinner. Who knows when StonyFan1918 will update again, could be tonight. And you need your strength."
"You should be protecting my precious child's virtue." Howard tried, but he could barely keep a straight face. It cracked into a grin, and he coughed to cover it up.
It wouldn't be an hour, Steve knew Tony better than that. But he'd take all the time he could get to process this. It was a lot for both of them.
On one rather unique occasion, they stripped off their dresses and jumped naked into the ocean. Swimming freely into the chilly water and diving into the waves. Giggling and running to grab their belongings when the Jones Beach grounds crew caught them, speeding out of the parking lot and racing away. She'd take an Uber home from one of the girl's houses, under Tony's account, always leaving a hefty tip. He never questioned the charges. And she would never see those girls again.
"That's not the point, Tones. It's gonna hurt right now because you never let yourself really feel the pain he caused. You gotta feel your way through it. You do that, and you'll be healed."
Kissing his shoulder, Steve ran his hands up Tony's side, letting just the whispers of his fingertips graze his skin. He leaned down, taking one of Tony's nipples into his mouth, sucking on it, caressing it with his tongue. Tony whimpered, his hands going to Steve's head, "oh fuck."
They were in the kitchen at some point, the rest of the team, but not long enough to see all that. Right?
Hey all! I edited this chapter to hopefully make it better. ❤💙 The story will be slowly renovated. This was one of my first attempts back into writing after ten years and since I've completed it, most of what I learned has come back to me. 10/28/2020
I know this is a little bit of a slow burn, but I honestly can't see Tony just up and being okay with Howard being there. Tell me what you think in the comments.
Taking Tony's face gently in his hands, Steve tilted his head back so he could look into his eyes. "I'm just as much to blame. I should have been supportive of you. Instead I just did what I thought was right. What I thought was best for you." He let his forehead fall softly against Tony's. "I'd say we're both idiots." Within Steve's body, he felt the pieces shift, moving alongside each other, searching for their correct placement. "Complete, ridiculous idiots."
Bruce cooked that night. He put a recipe on the tablet and did his best to follow the instructions to a T. And while it didn't look as pretty as the picture, it tasted fabulous. Chicken quarters with gravy he made from the drippings, mixing it with flour and spices -- with broccoli and mashed potatoes on the side.
"Knocking," Steve began, leaning against the door frame and studying Howard's silhouette against the window, "is a polite move that is meant to save both parties embarrassment." He kept his voice tempered and cold.
"For science!" Bruce repeated, giggling like a schoolgirl as he helped Tony place the homemade bomb in the center of the blackened ring.
With that feeling bubbling inside him, he stripped off his pajama bottoms and lay back on his bed, nude and ready to envision himself with Steve, to touch himself and pretend it was the soldiers hands.
"And here we go again." Tony grumbled, annoyed, into his lunch. He threw his fork down. "Talking about me like I'm not even here."
show." And it was. Steve was absolutely happy to hand over the controls, but that didn't mean he couldn't have some fun with it. With two fingers smeared with lube, he snaked his hand around and slipped them inside of Tony, aiming right for his prostate and stimulating it.
"Do it harder." Thor demanded, his cock, and fuck it was large, was leaking precome, a few drops hitting Tony's rear. Steve leaned down to lick them up. "I want you to slam into him so hard he cannot handle it."
But Bruce had to admit, seeing Howard fly back over the kitchen counter with the force of Steve's punch was wholly and wonderfully satisfying.
"After dinner. I'm hungry," she said, standing and stretching languidly. Sneaking a peak at Howard, she was pleased to see him tense and studying her. She didn't want him to peg any of her moods or movements. Best to keep him on his toes.
. But as much as he chastised himself, as upset as he was over hurting Tony's feelings, he couldn't help the
At a quarter past noon, he put the coffee on and returned to the bedroom. Tony was lying on his side, curled up in the blankets, his soft breaths the only sounds in the room. Steve had to tug the comforter down a bit to find his face - still peaceful in sleep - to lightly kiss. Waking Tony could be dangerous, but Steve knew his best bet was a light press of the lips along Tony's. It didn't hurt that he scrunched his face up so damn cutely when he did that as well.
"Yeah," Steve's hands ran up Tony's back, tugging him closer as Tony dipped his head and took one of the hard little buds into his mouth, his teeth lightly grazing it. Moaning, Steve's fingers gripped Tony's hair, pulling softly.
thought the same of himself - as a father, not a mother, let's not be ridiculous - when he was a young man. That one day, he'd grow up and have a family and he'd be the kind of father
"He has already lost his home and everything he knows. Losing his identity as well will only hurt him more." Looking at Steve, Thor inclined his head, "When you were awakened, you felt lost and alone. How much worse would it have been if you were also stripped of your identity?"
But that honestly never bothered him. It should have, he knew. It was a bit bizarre, wasn't it? He had fallen into the ice 25 years before Tony was even born. Technically, he was in his nineties. Physically, he was still young.
"It's not," Clint answered with a grunt. "We can't find anything, though we located the original text Howard used to get here."
"Right. Well." Visibly swallowing, Howard looked down. "I know what I do to Tony. I'm not proud of what I become."
It took everything for Tony to shut his trap and not respond. He was starting to learn that he didn't need to have an answer for everything.
But in times when he was stressed, it was more manic than productive. Most of the time, he emerged from those spells of deflection and invention with something awe inspiring and cutting edge. But sometimes, all he did was take apart his suit hunting for a problem that didn't exist.
"Whatever." She pulled her phone out and plopped into the couch. "It all sounds good. Do what's easy." His head popped out of the kitchen, one finger raised and an impish look on his face. She threw a hand up to stop him before the words could leave his mouth. "You'll want to think long and hard about what you're about to say."
And Tony drank him in like a parched man chugging water after days without, reeling in the feeling of Steve: his tongue, his lips, his cock thrusting in and out of him, pressing against that spot within him that forced stars to shoot across his vision
Raising his eyebrows, impressed with her and at the same time amused, he nodded. "Aha! The light finally clicks on!"
Tony tuned them out, moving back to the counter to pour himself a cup of coffee and make tea for Steve and Bruce. They were trying hard to distract him - and it was mostly working - but he found himself thinking once again of his father.
But Tony barely heard them. He was wrapped up in Steve's arms, the laptop forgotten on the floor, surrendering himself to the kisses, his body trembling with the need to be close.
"I mean, I guess if you really want, but we set you up here so we would be close if you needed help." Steve slides forward, intending on standing to bring Tony to his room. "But, you may be right. Maybe you'll sleep better." It is a little shameful to realize none of them had figured that out before this. The couch is cushy and plush, large and cozy. Not a single one of them has been able to escape falling into a deep, restful sleep on it. But it's still not a bed.
Natasha grabbed his chin her black gloves cool against his skin and tilted his head to make eye contact. Her hair was pulled into an athletic pony tail and her gaze stony.
Tony finished the house in three months instead of two without Clint's help. Worrying Bruce by staying up past the stars and into sunrise just to finish each room. Bruce was always right behind him painting and refurbishing the rooms he'd gotten to. Three trips into town was all it took to get the poultry and animals to maintain supply. Tony had also spent an extravagant amount of money to get them a sign that read Three Bitches Bar and Inn with a small picture of a blonde fox, a brown coyote and a large green wolf hovering behind them.
He grabbed the workman's clothes he kept in there and flopped down into a cot halfheartedly stuffing himself into clothes. Tony stared at the ceiling. He was missing something. He waited patiently. Dummy immediately bumped the edge of his cot and he pulled the small automaton into his bed. A quarter hour later Jarvis came in with an audible creak of the door. Tony picked him up and set him next to his side. The whirr of wheels and the tick of clockwork blanketed Tony in sweet sleep.
Tony's mind flirted with the idea of runes and rituals and what type of tonic would get a man to join his pack anyway. He dropped them. Bruce would say yes of his own free will.
Tony was still in bed head down staring at the eightieth episode of Parks and Rec he’s seen. He felt better but he was bored and tired and scared. He might have been drooling. He missed being in class and staring at Rodgers, or sending notes to Bruce, or editing text books with his theories or accurate depictions of the USA. Instead he was stuck in bed waiting for his week to be done with so he could limp from class to class.
“We’ll see you later, little fox. Do be kinder to Barnes next time, I fear he might actually love you.”
Tony stood toe to toe with him. They were nearly the same height. “How did Captain Rodgers, respond?”
Steve crouched down onto the grass and placed his head in his hands and found tears. There were four but now there’s two.
"Please continue, Doctor." Thor said, placing another finger into Bruce eliciting a noise he had not heard in years. "Your expertise is a feat I have not seen in a while."
“What happened?” he whispered as Tony and Thor got into the semantics of Thor staying permanently in his workshop and what rights Bruce had to him thereof.
AO3 ate all my bold and italic prints I didn't notice until a chapter ago....I'm very sorry to all of those who are reading this editing nightmare.
Clint finished assigning the pack into the registry and was giving out keys. Thor walked into the restaurant demanding food. Steve had looked around quietly before heading upstairs. Natasha gave him a long hug and they caught up a bit while Sam went to their room. Bruce had come out of the office around then and walked straight to the kitchen with nothing but an awkward wave. Natasha gave him 'that' look which he returned with 'this' look. She shrugged it off.
"I am a doctor, no scientist I ensure you. But you’re right about the automaton. It's very..." The omega stared at Jarvis who watched back his slotted eyes showing nothing. "Life like."
Tony laid on the ground while Dummy whirred around him worriedly. He needed a drink. There wasn’t one in his workshop, an oversight he will be soon to fix but his office was right there. Tony stood up. Dummy straightened looking up at him dolefully with his claw. He walked towards the office window and opened it slightly climbing in swiftly. Dummy clanked against the outer wall and his tires whirled anxiously. Tony shooed him off towards the work shop. Dummy followed his orders but looked back sadly tripping every so often because he wasn’t watching where he was going. Tony shook his head once he saw the farm doors open for the small automaton.
Steve slept on the cold hard ground with Thor wrapped around him to keep the early spring blizzard off his form. Thor was, to Steve's knowledge, indestructible. He snored loudly into Steve’s ear barely even noticing the storm. Steve stirred. Something had awakened his consciousness. There was the faintest flap of large wings. Steve’s ears flicked. Thor burrowed further into him trying to shush the overly wary alpha. Steve shrugged him off. There were two other sounds of the sound of soft paws near silent on the forest floor. Steve picked himself up haunches drawn. What could possibly coming for him?
“I thought you died.” Bucky answered. Clint stilled. “You and the cubs. I don’t know if I would have recovered.”
Thor looked pink about the ears and opened his mouth to possibly counter when Bruce’s fist slapped the table. Thor and Steve scooted back defensively.
"It'll fill the time." He said backing away he turned, and Steve caught the slightest glimpse of a small smile.
Tony turned to exchange a look with Jarvis. Hook, line and sinker. Tony Stark had a packmate. Even if he didn't know it yet.
“The twins were so small when they came.” Tony sighed. Bruce watched him not feeling the urge to speak. “They still haven't chosen names, but that doesn't matter you can see the love in every look and movement from them. Even exhausted as they are.”
Steve smiled and it wasn’t for show it was his genuine pleasure at having his passion acknowledged. “Yeah.”
Steve grabbed Tony’s hand again and led him to the river’s edge. “We will tear down every man and blockade that Lord Stane throws up to get your children back, but we cannot throw ourselves at something if there are pieces trailing behind.”
"How are you?" Steve asked compelled to solve a problem with his unit to make them work more efficiently. It was that thought that struck him like a cord that he was missing nearly half his his pack. It had been days and he missed them. Steve closed his eyes and swallowed down the feelings. Soldiers were lost everyday he could wait a few days for his pack to get back.
Thor went for a hunt and Tony created a small fire where the living room used to be. They sat and ate in relative silence in the carcass of their home. Tony stared up through a hole in the roof at the cloudy gray sky.
There was a beat. “It is not that that worries us, Mr. Stark has asked us to do this and we feel as though we owe it to him to follow through.”
"Sit." He did. Tony leaned in. "You must be a scientist." Tony said. "Most don't notice my automaton."
The angel leaned down and shadows obscured his face. “I have read that devils tend to work below and are usually naked.”
Tony left closing the door behind him as Bruce asked gentle medical questions. He let out a breath. God almighty he needed a drink.
Bucky laughed and opened to door. He gestured for Steve to walk through. He was impeded by Thor skidding to a stop in front of them.
“Hush.” Tony said standing up and hooking an arm through Steve’s. “I will be here if you cannot awaken. We must rest, truly rest before we make the last leg of the trip.”
“I’m naked in front of a prince!” Clint yelled abruptly standing up and then darting off. Bucky leaned back and threw his fork down. “I don’t see why this is a problem. You did it all the time before,” he grumbled also excusing himself from the table. He paused just long enough to smack Steve outside the head.
“So, Captain.” Tony said drawing out the words. “Why have you decided that I was the omega to capture your affections? From my understanding you hate me.”
“Two marshal’s. I’ve got this.” Steve told him. Tony looked between the two marshal's and Steve. He nodded trusting Steve with the legal procedures and continued on his way. Once the door closed Steve found himself staring at the paper. Tony trusted him. Trusted.
Tony ran towards the sound of his voice. Click, clank. Tony looked up. Jarvis sat on a tree branch just above his head clicking his legs again.
It pains me to say I must go. I have already delayed enough in waiting through your heat with you and I fear if I'm gone much longer Natasha and Sam will be beyond me. Thus, I write this note while you’re still warm and sex happy and sleeping. I" there was an ink blotch here that bled rather large while Bucky had gathered his thoughts "I love you. As soon as we are back from this journey to find a brother in arms, I will find you. I'd like for you to stay in the nearest town, but I doubt you will stay still for so long. Do not fear, we will find you and with any luck you will allow me to honor to" another much larger ink splotch "mate you. We will meet again soon.
Clint rolled his eyes. Bucky came from a similar side of town as Clint but he tended to really, really hate rich people. “Yes. Why else did he have a major concussion?”
Tony rubbed his forehead. "They are an unsavory sort. Arms dealers who lost their best weapons maker. They also lost the head business man."
Tony turned to look at him. Clint was looking at his hands. “Why? I don’t get it. If you were giving us all the money anyway, why keep it a secret that we surpassed our original goal.”
Tony rolled over and arched his back in a titillating fashion. "Court me properly? I thought you wanted your mark on me and heavy with child like a Neanderthal. It would be much easier to accomplish this if you rested your sword between friendly thighs."
“Do you have anymore medicine?” Bruce asked right next to his ear in a whisper. Tony blinked and shook his head.
"The same man has saved me countless more times than you ever will. We went after him because we were on the edge eating each other alive and needed a definitive leader. If that meant our Captain during the war, then so be it."
Blonsky was a large piece of meat covered in muscle who probably took steroids. There were only two students in the room that were even close to his size and one of them was watching Stane another pile of beef covered in muscles. Steve nodded.
"Possibly not," Clint said placing his hands on his stomach. The twins were busy from all the excitement.
Tony’s eyes found his. His breathing evened out and he blinked rapidly gathering himself. Steve wanted nothing more than to pull him into his arms. Tony gestured outside and Steve nodded. They both left the slumbering pack with only a few curious glances. Tony made his way across the hazy drizzle to his work shop and pushed open the doors. The damage was extensive, and the fire had burned through all of his tables and notes.
Tony looked up at him from under his lashes. "My last lover said the same, and from the frequency you drop the word I would think that you’re interested."
Thor leaned back slapping his hands to his thighs. “I was just thinking of one when Lord Stark had asked. Steven was the unfortunate king of a small nation smashed between Rance and Pain, for three folds.”
The air grew sharper and the days longer. Snow was on the precipice of showing itself given how close it was to freezing the very air in their lungs when they were outside for more than a moment. Clint's due date was soon. They think. He was large and round and twins were rarely ever on time always early. Tony woke up snuggled into the warmth of Steve. He'd been sleeping in bed and hadn't been out to the warehouse very often because it felt as thought the pack needed his proximity. He looked out side and saw the first etching of frost begin to drift. Snow was upon them.
Tony’s eyes widened. He shook his head. No. Stane smiled and forced him so that his back was on top of the desk Stane resting between his thighs.
Tony didn’t know what to say to that. He was feeling a lot of things right now that he had no idea how to parse out.
Tony was hot his skin fevered. He must go. That was all there was to it. The world moved around the feeling and he barely even felt his flesh and bones shifting or being moved. His children. They are just beyond. Only a little farther. He must go. No matter how this physical world pulls upon him. Their pain is greater. Time passed he's sure but it felt as if in one breath he had found Sam and Natasha in the woods and the next there was a clearing with a large tent and Tony darted forward despite all the shouts and howls for him to stop. They were just right there.
"Mr. and Mrs. Wilson are in search of any signs of my old pack in the surrounding area. I'm trying to stay hidden."
“No, backflipping out of this, Clinton Francis Barton. I’ll hold you to your word.” Bucky said. He turned his back to Clint and called over his shoulder. “Tell Lord Stark that I like what he did with Dummy.”
“It’s probably just stress.” Bruce said gently pressing against Clint’s belly. “I don’t even think your going to open enough to start.”
“Your welcome,” Tony said and continued with his food. “Now then, got any good spoils of war Captain and your Highness?”
Tonys eyes focused on a snowflake and he remembered the idea he had. The spark of interest. The rush.
Clint turned into him. “I think you’re right.” Clint turned his head and did not smile when Bucky stumbled trying to follow. “Jarvis would you like to join us?”
Clint shifted still as curled as he could possibly be. Bucky laid his hand on top of Clint's head and they waited. The sun rose higher up brightening the sky and no one felt the need to move and clean the glass or cover the window. The resounding grief pouring through the bond was almost as petrifying as the first earth shattering cry. When the snow finally reached Natashas hair she stood and grabbed a broom to clean up the glass. Thor got up and went outside scavenging a piece of the stable for overnight the window. Sam came to help with nails and a hammer. Bucky and Clint stayed the unspoken anxieties unsaid but known.
"More," Bruce whispered. Thor smiles against his neck and Bruce felt his teeth against his skin. Mate. Thor pulled away and Bruce took the opportunity to pull off his clothes.
“It’s very dark,” Tony said as something brushed his shoulders. The next thing he knew he was being pulled up and over someone’s shoulders.
He nudged Bruce with his foot and stood. Natasha threw the ball over her head getting up too, and Clint stopped bending backwards long enough to whistle loudly. Their crowd of masked students turned going silent.
Natasha looked at him and then took his hand. “Tony’s all the way in Berkley today for one of his college courses.”
"What else can you do?" Tony said instead touching Thor to turn him around and pull him out in the open. Steve watched his hips sway and his excited hand movements as Thor swung himself in the air. He'd have to woo that man and it felt like an adventure.
Tony turned and gave a false smile. He’d been told it was beautiful once. “My legal alpha may be dead but my actual alpha I can not tell the plans of.”
Steve scooted forward pushing between Tony’s spread legs. “Oh, I never expected it to be that easy.”
“Rule number one we don’t talk about fight club,” Tony quoted automatically. Their little cage fights didn’t have such rules, they needed to make a profit after all.
Tony wiggled a finger under his nose. “Oh, you offer it to me, Mr. Magic. Give me the honor of building a weapon enchanted with your own magic and sealed with mine. What do you like to play with? Mace? Bat? Long Sword? Rifle?”
"I see." Tony sat down. The missing man could have possibly seen him but that was for his own worry. Why did the Wilsons need to inform him? "I don't know what this has to do with me."
Tony nodded. “We need at least three more fight nights. If we get caught again the better. No one comes to ask for money once it’s gone.”
“Well it hurt!” Clint shouted. The air grew silent and Clint realized how exposed they were to the other students milling about. Bucky crossed his arms immediately going on the offensive. Clint rolled his eyes and walked away. It wasn’t like he didn’t have things to plan.
“I am sickened and saddened by this lack of trust. But mostly,” Tony sniffed, “I am disgusted that no one told me so we could use this as a spy opportunity.”
Steve awoke alone and cold on a mildew covered field. He was tired and felt his bones shift uncomfortably meaning he was man once again, his companion long gone. Of course.
“Twenty three then,” Steve said. “Bruce took out seven while the man was trying to burn our home with us in it.”
They continued to watch the road the sun slowly climbing towards its destination buried in the the trees. A large round fox trotted from the edges of the house three large quail in its maw. It pranced proudly up the steps it's stomach jiggling with it. Steve held out a hand. The fox sniffed but turned away. Bucky went for a reach and got a cut from an angry claw. Then the creature nosed open the door and walked inside carrying its prize.
Clint was curled up on one of the top branches of the maple trees that were scattered across the quad. He tapped his pencil against his notebook deeply troubled by how hard his algebra 2 homework was. Three equation solving things… He couldn’t tell X from Z. Clint banged his head with his notebook. He understood physics. He understood geometry. It’s what made him so good at archery but god forbid he touches more complex algebra. He put that notebook away and pulled out his history book. At least it was just boring not infuriating.
Tony grabbed a paper from the pile and made three simple shapes. “Here copy.” He said flipping the paper over.
The pack ran together shifted, rarely ever changing back unless to stop Tony's guileless trail. They had run for three days and were exhausted but Tony seemed unable to stop until he collapsed. Steve often had to hold him just to get food in his mouth. His eyes never lost their glossy shimmer. The one that came over when they hunted for Natasha and Sam was not nearly as strong as this one. Steve could not believe that Tony had even connected to his pack well enough to follow them. He believed it might have had something to do with gods. Thor carried Bruce on his back the shorter man very solemn in their quest. Otherwise they moved as a unit preparing for battle. Natasha and Sam nightly kept their shifted weapons up to par and Thor never lost the faint smell of rain ready to unleash his lightning when ready. Steve was ready also. He had no weapons but that was par for the course. Tony was the only outlier. Eyes glossed and unseeing, he was gone. A ghost of a man.
Tony nodded. “I can work with that fixing my own rune’s into the metal and then,” he mumbled for a few moments. “Give me your blood then.”
Steve grabbed his hand and dragged towards the door of the basement. “It’s late and I want to go to bed.” Steve grumbled.
“Hardy-har-har-har,” Steve intoned blandly. “Look. I just don’t like the idea of us going out there and getting hurt for the stupid purpose of trying to prove something.”
Tony choked, Clint covered his chest ineffectively with his hands, Bucky set down his fork so he could rub his forehead and Bruce appeared to reach another realm with how glassy his eyes were at that very moment. Steve’s fork clinked against his plate as he continued eating around Tony’s coughing fit and everyone’s sudden astonishment.
“He’s not going to kill either of them.” Steve reiterated. “They’re bargaining chips, scared little devil.”
Bucky shrugged, grabbing a shirt. "Town is just a day’s ride away. I'd live in the woods if I have to. I'm certainly not leaving him."
Bruce laid the pie tops over the filling and pressed them together. “I will enjoy our time together, won’t you?” Bruce said turning to look at Thor and found himself caught in a kiss. Oh. Bruce’s bones melted into the floor. Oh.
The door opened before he was even able to knock. The man was a brutish looking alpha already eying Tony with distrust.
One of the prefects found Tony thirty minutes later passed out on the soccer fields. Steve ran up and let Hank go to call back the prefects and call it a night. Tony was laying face down an arm pressed against his belly and the other on his side as if his consciousness left him between one step and the next. Shit. Steve flipped him around gently and took his pulse. Steady. Steve knew that all the CPR and First Aid movies told him not to move trauma victims but… something about Tony’s bloody mouth and pale skin irked him so he picked him up bridal style and called 911.
"I told him I had duties here. He asked to stay and then he kissed me. Things devolved from there. We only broke apart once the pies were done and I ran away as soon as I pulled them out."
“Stop right there Stark,” Steve Rogers head senior prefect said. His face had that dry unamused look that Tony wanted to kiss off.
He ran into the tavern shifting between one breath and he next. Where could they be? He was about to search all the rooms when he heard laughing in the parlor. Steve made a sharp turn and ran through the open doors.
Bruce moved him away, so Tony could set down the wall. "Of course, the bastard would die before actually finishing anything." Tony grunted. The wall rested with a thump against the ground and Tony could turn his full attention on Clint who was blinking himself awake.
Steve stood up and grabbed Stane by his shirt collar dragging him out of the room. He shut the door behind them.
“I’m fine, Wilson.” Natasha said curtly grabbing two food trays. She was at least going to get Tony some pudding if nothing else. She was also certain he thought he had yesterday’s Jamba Juice from when Natasha visited him in the hospital.
Tony felt his chest give way to a hollowness and fire burn through his throat. The very air seemed horrifyingly weightless. No. Jarvis was… He screamed.
Steve ran for at least an hour just behind him before the scent veered off. He slowed sniffing around the edges of a sizable trench.
“I thought you murdered your alpha.” Bruce said. Steve whipped around, and Tony had his eyes closed.
Tony rolled his neck and stood on the side of their haphazard ring set up deep into the wooded outskirts around the school. Stane stood next to him and smirked. Tony ignored him and checked the wrapping around his hands. Tight. Bruce was better at it than him. The winner was announced and the crowd shifted getting their debts and money exchanged. Tony took a deep breath and stood taller. Stane grabbed his ass then proceeded him into the cardboard strewn ring.
“What?” she needed to get this over with and start trying to find more…less queer friends. She was certain the student body was pissed about something. She couldn’t put her finger on it but then again she wasn’t talked around in locker rooms. They never spoke to her. They spoke
Steve felt more than heard Tony pulling in air and energy for another scream. He pulled away and forced his gaze on him.
Bruce awoke to babies squalling. He groaned flipping his pillow over his head. He'd been extra exhausted recently and Clint's children weren't helping his failing sleep cycle or constant nausea. He'd almost vomited for the first time in his career as a doctor when he found a solid cloth outside their room. He was known for his strength in stomach but this was just too much. Everything felt like too much. He was also getting migraines and the monster was more talkative and, and, Thor would not give him space. Even now while Bruce tried to smother himself in a pillow the man was wrapped completely around him. Bruce was too hot. He began to cry. That was the lost straw he got out of bed and Thor whimpered then rolled over in Bruces vacated spot. Bruce wasn't concerned he would wake up. The man slept like the dead. Bruce padded out to the living room and found a cloak that was Sam’s and stuffed his feet into boots then braved the great outside for the workshop where Tony had returned to. He switched where he was sleeping but he still spent most of his time with Dummy and the kiln.
"Yes, three legged wolf." Clint said sliding off his lap. "While I do enjoy your company, I do not think it will last." Clint stood readjusting his weight and running a soothing his hand over his stomach.
Clint lifted his and followed suit. He wiped his mouth with the back of his hand and ordered two more. “Lets.”
They had been gone for months. Months. Steve was exhausted. They repeated the same story over and over. Omitting Bruce and Tonys involvement given that they would be seen as abominations against the gods. Thor at one point sent lighting through the ceiling and said with a commanding voice to one of the marshals. “Does that give evidence for the damage done?”
Bucky scrubbed a hand through his hair. “The top weapons manufacturer suddenly stopped and when the weapons began to malfunction, our trade became a hand to hand combat.”
“Good to see you,” Bruce said a few moments later then headed to the kitchen calling over his shoulder, “I made those cinnamon bread rolls you like, let me get you some.”
Tony moved out of Steve’s arms he couldn’t answer he was looking for Clint. The fox was very large and very round and breathing but not awake.
“Margaret Anne and Natalia Grace, if they’re girls,” Clint said rubbing his belly thoughtfully, “Thomas Anthony and Steven Jamison, if they’re boys.”
That stirred them into action Clint and Bruce getting dressed and Sam and Natasha readying the winter wear for the cold night ahead of them.
“Let us settle my servants, first.” Tony said then leaned in to whisper in his ear. “That way we can take our time debating the price.”
Bucky sat up he felt as if his entire body was shaking loose. Lord Stark was testing out the motion on his new arm. The leather straps bit into his shoulders but… Bucky's fingers twitched and he made a fist. Tony let go of the hand and let him take control.
"When you've seen as much death as I have, they cross your path to see if you've died. I've surprised them on every occasion."
“…At least I’ve been able to finish my college course work and I’ve finished all possible assignments I could have for the next month in all my classes but the never ending sense of boredom is what is truly driving me mad,” Tony whined.
“Nice place you have here, Tony. Quaint. So…unlike you. I assumed you liked our opulence.” Stane said.
Thor nuzzled into Bruce's shoulder wrapping himself around him once again. "We shall have to do it again, and again and again."
Tonys back straightened. “I knew they were close but I didn’t realize,” he turned on the work bench and faced Steve.
"Take care of yourself, little fox." She murmured giving him one more hug. "We'll talk more in the morning."
Bucky shrugged leaning back on his hand so Clint could lay against him. Clint’s lips twisted unhappy with the turn in events but didn’t protest. Bruce turned green.
Tony gritted his jaw and walked in. Stane walked around the ring jostling the crowd. Tony squared his shoulders and waited. He had a feeling that Stane was the type to punch first. Three seconds later and he was right. Except Stane had a roll of quarters in his fist and Tony felt his brain smash against the side of his skull and bit into his cheek. His entire body jolted to the side and he fell harshly to the ground. Before he could even get his wits about him and assess the damage of his concussion, he felt a foot collide with his ribs. Tony coughed and Stane turned his back to jeer the crowd. Tony could kind of hear Clint's voice counting down. Time to end this. Tony pushed up onto his knees. When Stane turned around Tony grabbed his ankle and pulled it toward himself and up. Stane landed on his back the air knocked out of him. Tony hopped up on his feet and his vision blurred but he already knew what he had to do. He pulled a knee up stomped into Stane’s solar plexus. Stane punched his calf to try and remove his foot but Tony grabbed the arm and twisted. The pop of his shoulder dislocating bounced off the walls. The crowd was dead silent. Clint counted and then it was over. Stane was screaming by the time Tony walked off. He spat blood next to Stane’s face on his way out.
“I need,” Steve gasped desperate. Tony nodded reaching down past his aching cock to his cunt. He was so wet but he moved beyond that tucking a finger then another into himself.
"I'd love to take you but let's just take a short walk." Bucky suggested thinking the house and away from public view of their packs.
“That’s one of my favorites,” a smooth masculine voice said gently. Natasha looked up. She had put on makeup today. She didn’t want to regret it. She knows Tommy probably got something from Tony and then some. She wanted it to be only Tommy.
"Why do your eyes do that?" Steve asked without thinking much. He'd just never seen it. Other automatons didn't have glowing eyes to begin with.
Steve looked at Tony. Tony gestured minutely at T’Challa. Steve jerked his head at Bruce. Tony shook it.
“Don’t worry,” he said pushing up his sleeves and showing off his scrawny arms. “Me and Tony have nearly the same schedule.”
Jarvis’s eyes flickered on. Tony felt the air in his lungs leave violently. He was so used to seeing them off that he had forgotten that they had glowed.
"Very kind of you, Mr. Banner," Tony said taking the mans hand in his own. "Check on the pies. Decide what you would like to do with your alpha. I suggest bedding him if it's that Norse one. He's got a fine ass on him indeed." Bruce made a strangled sound like he knew exactly in explicit detail what that ass felt like. Tony tightened his grip and stood up to touch Bruce's cheek. "I know you'll stay for me and Clinton but do not worry about us should you wish to leave once the pups are born. You deserve happiness, my friend."
Tony walked up to him wiggling a finger. "Oh, no, no, no, your counterpart does not declare me pack and then have you run away. We are going to stay together the way true packmates should." Tony declared hands on his hips and chest out.
“Metaphors go right over his pretty little head.” Tony said. He placed Bruce’s food on the night stand. Bruce listed sleepily side to side.
"I've been good about everyone keeping their secrets to themselves. Seems it’s time to air out the dirty laundry, build a little trust and better the pack bonds before we suddenly have a bun out of the oven. I'll start then Mr. Banner, then our little baker."
They huddled together in the stable away from the rain the smell of smoke still stinging their nostrils. Tony sat hard against the ground and Clint fell much softer against him. He needed comfort. Bucky was good but he knew that he needed…Tony carded his fingers through Clint’s hair and his lips pursed in a silent shushing noise. “Be well.” He placated.
"I have." Steve sighed. "Heavens, the Father has taken over and we are in the temple of the Lady whatever shall I do."
They had left the war torn country over a month ago and had not seen a soul along their path to the coast. Thor heaved a great doggy sigh and stood up towering over Steve’s not so slight form.
"I have no idea it might be the very fine alpha here, three-legged wolf." Clint said running his hands appreciatively down Bucky's torso. Bucky smiles and lets him take off his tunic.
Tony chuckled then spun into a shift and was running towards the tavern once again. Steve tried to restrain from the chase. His smell still in his nose cloying with his senses and he was on all fours thick fur shifting with the wind as he ran afterwards. When the chase was started it did not end until a goal was reached. What goal that maybe he did not know. But chase he did.
"It's getting darker by the second," Tony said the panic still bubbling up. He ran out the door pulling off clothes as he went. He left on a wristlet having never taken it off except for baths since Bruce and his encounter with the criminal pack. "I'm going to go find them." He called out jumping into his shift.
Bucky huffed out a small laugh, showing Clint a rare glimpse of his dimples. “I have nothing to prove. Just some assurance to give.”
“That we did, Mr. Wilson.” Tony answered. “But work is to be done and I’m certain I can convince Bruce to make us pie.”
“Haven’t had a dinner like this in nearly a week, have we?” he said aloud. Clint shrugged stuffing more venison into his gob. Thor nodded.
the way Tony’s ankles dug into his back and how those thighs clenched sporadically around his head.  Tony’s moans and whimpers increased with each of Steve’s licks, and the sub practically screamed when Steve dipped his tongue into the ring of muscle.
“This is boring.”  Tony bit back a grin, feeling Steve smile against his thigh as their daughter continued, “Can I have some chocolate milk?”
“Oh yes, but I fear they have a few more hours in them.  Particularly,” Sarah added, pointing at boys and laughing, “if they keep sneaking candy, the little boogers.”
Steve tilted his head.  “I can live with that.”  He leaned down further to brush kisses on Tony’s cheeks.  “How about a movie now?  Something spooky to match the season?”
Halloween and the season it was in, his boyfriend had always indulged but never really participated.  But it seemed like he was slowly coming around.
Tony continued walking around the couch, and he had to clap a hand to his mouth to stifle his laugh.  His big beefy boyfriend was decked head to toe in a green dinosaur onesie, complete with slippers that looked like dinosaur claws.  Meeting Steve’s eyes, Tony managed to ask around his laughter, “Where did this come from?”
Tony looked through the peephole, but only saw the top of someone’s head, crouched in front of the knob.  Taking a deep breath, he turned the knob and yanked it open, causing the person outside to topple backwards, exposing his face.
“Sounds perfect,” Tony said, leaning down at the same time Steve lifted himself up again to meet his lips in a gentle kiss.
Steve lifted his head to scan the houses around them, laying back down on Tony’s lap when he saw the coast was clear.  “Shall we get the munchkin her chocolate milk and then back in bed?  We can crash on the couch afterwards, put on a movie?”
for relief across their bond, probably reacting to Steve’s thoughts over it too.  “All right sweetheart, I’ll give you what you want.”
to feel you inside me,” Tony begged between Steve’s thrusts, words being punched out with his breath.
Steve stood up, wrapping an arm around Tony’s shoulders, and after muttering a quick, “Lift up a bit for me darling,” hooked his other arm underneath Tony’s thighs.  In one smooth movement, Steve lifted Tony and carried him out of the room and across the hall to their bedroom.  He laid Tony down at the top of the bed, mindful of his arms and legs that were still hooked together, holding his sub open and giving him a wonderful view of his dripping cock and the puckered entrance beneath.
“Yes darling,” Tony said softly, keeping one hand in Steve’s hair and bringing the other up to brush a few strands of the same blond hair out of his daughter’s face.  “He had a busy day at work, and we enjoy the fresh air when it’s not too cold.”
Steve paused the movie immediately, then leaned his head against Tony’s temple, brushing a kiss there a second later.  “Of course sweetheart.  Let’s put on Hocus Pocus, I know you love to sing along with Bette Midler.”
Maria laughed as well, noticing her little witch and Sarah’s little vampire pop something in their mouths.  When they noticed their mothers watching, they shrieked and ran the rest of the way to the following house.  She smiled as they got even more candy, waving when Tony made sure to make eye contact with her before running off again.  Her little bambino had opened up so much since meeting his now best friend, Steven Rogers, especially considering how sad and quiet he had been when they first left his father.
“Hello?”  He called towards the only other room in their place, adding, “Are you sure we’ll remember that it’s Halloween this month?”
when he saw-”  Tony tried to cover his mouth, knowing what he was going to say, laughing uncontrollably a second later when his traitorous boyfriend started tickling him.  “When he
“Can we go home?”  Steve asked, walking forward to hug his mom, stifling his own yawn into her stomach.  A second later, he seemed much more alert, and popped his head up to ask, “But Tony can still come over for a sleepover, right Ma?”
The next twenty - thirty? - minutes passed peacefully, with Steve only getting up to change Tony’s pose ever so slightly a few times.  Steve couldn’t resist running his hands up Tony’s thighs, loving the way Tony whined when he got close to his sub’s straining cock.  He debated giving him a few strokes, but with the ring around it, it would only make Tony more tense and that wasn’t the point for today.
!”  A fresh peal of laughter came out of her as Steve gasped in mock-offense, and renewed his tickle attack.  “Ah Daddy no!  Please!”  When he didn’t let up, she turned those blue blue eyes to Tony, saying, “Mama help!”
“I saw it at Target today, and I know how much you love Halloween, so...why not?”  Steve said, opening his arms for Tony to join him.  Tony snuggled into Steve’s side, before pursing his lips upwards and sighing happily when Steve kissed him, slow and easy.
“You’ve been so good for me,” Steve whispered, kneeling in front of Tony.  He combed his fingers through Tony’s hair, cupping the side of his face and pulling him in for a slow kiss.  Steve loved the feeling of Tony’s lips, on his own or on his body when he allowed Tony to explore to his heart’s content.  He broke away from that delightful mouth when he felt Tony
Day 3/31 of Spooktacular Halloween: Movie.  Direct continuation of chapter 2, same college verse.  ^-^
Tony scrambled off the couch, nearly faceplanting when his legs got tangled in the blankets.  He did land on his knees rather painfully, and he froze, afraid that the stranger would have heard the thump.  When the knob rattled again, Tony quickly kicked away the blanket and got to his feet.  He walked over to the door, picking up one of their decorative paperweights along the way, and quietly grabbed the doorknob.
Tony pretended to think it over, before sighing at Steve’s puppy eyes.  “I think I’m going to need more than a promise for scaring me so much,” Tony said, giggling when Steve swept him up in his arms, kissing him as he walked towards the bedroom.
“Yeah, I like those!  Here, you can have my Reese’s Pieces, I don’t like peanut butter candy,” Tony said, gathering the candies and placing them beside Steve’s pile.  As Steve did the same, Tony found his gaze traveling from the candy to his friend’s face.  A warm feeling went through him, one that was slowly becoming more familiar whenever he saw his friend.  He knew he liked to spend time with Steve, and that he always had fun with him.  But recently, he’d started thinking about how cute Steve was too, how nice his smile was and the warm and fuzzy feeling Tony got when Steve smiled at him specifically.  It was a new feeling and kind of scary, but Tony also got the feeling sometimes that Steve felt the same way.
The scritch-scratch of Steve’s pencils and brushes against the canvas were pure bliss to Tony’s ears, helping Tony stay down where his Dom wanted him.  Tony could feel Steve’s gaze on him, and his inner sub preened at the attention as Steve painted him.  He floated gently, feeling almost weightless, yet remaining grounded enough through the padded cuffs keeping his wrists together.  They were connected to a matching set around his ankles, and Tony knew his back and thighs would be delightfully sore later on from keeping this pose.
Tony whined at the wave of lust that left Steve, and the Dom immediately acted.  Laying himself on his stomach, Steve kissed his way down Tony’s right thigh, moving lower until he was hovering over Tony’s hole.  He paused, relishing in the shivers that wracked Tony’s body in reaction to his warm breath across Tony’s most intimate spot.  He placed a single, wet kiss on it, eliciting a choked giggle, and then went to work.
When he came back to himself, Steve could feel soft fingers brushing up and down his sides, the body beneath him breathing deep and easy.  He kissed Tony’s neck gently, then slowly uncurled himself from around the other man, watching his expression to make sure everything was fine.  Tony only gazed back at him, eyes showing he was still slightly under, but warm feelings of content flowed through their bond.
"Babe?" Steve's sleepy morning voice was a favorite of Tony's. It was a bit deeper, raspier, and totally sexy. Tony felt a flush as his body woke up to the sound, but he really needed to tinker. He had too much in his head to work out.
Tony gives himself up to instinct and wraps an arm around Steve's shoulder. "There's nothing I can say that's going to make you feel better," it hurts to say, but Tony knows being truthful is the best way to handle Steve. He doesn't like platitudes and weak condolences. "What I
Steve's finger crooked against Tony's prostate again, sending the smaller man jolting and moaning. "That lunatic? He's an illusionist posing as a wizard."
"Daddy fell in love," Tony said simply. "And he thought the man he fell for couldn't possibly love him back, but there's a chance."
"Howard, just...Please?" Maneuvering into a sitting position, the blankets wrapped around his waist, Steve huffed and pointed again. "Go!"
Final chapter will be up next Friday and the epilogue the Friday after that! Enjoy the rest of this wild ride!
"His suite, with Steve and Bruce," she nodded toward the door. "Go ahead, we can hold down the fort. I found another bottle of vodka."
"Oh, sweet mother Mary! Fuck yes!" Steve stilled himself, worried he had done something wrong. "Do it again! Whatever the fuck that was, do it again!"
"Hey! Go fuck yourself!" But Tony was laughing, hand reaching for the tray before Howard angled himself away.
Placing the device down gently, Howard stood, still a little shaky on his feet, but he did his best to hide it. He tempered his tone, trying to placate, trying to soothe, but he honestly had no experience with that. "They tell me I hurt you."
Laughing, Clint crumbled up the wrapper to the burrito he was eating and flung it toward Tony. "The only fucking going on around here is between Steve and-Ooof!"
Tony was aging well. Graceful, even. Still gorgeous even at Forty-three - and Rhodey was not ashamed to admit that. Howard seemed to be on the same track.
The media? The ones who stalked Tony and followed him to Boston, procuring media passes and packing into the back of the reception hall where the speeches would take place? They were still too stupid to even begin to realize exactly why Tony was there. It was so much more fun to paint him as a villain, as someone who had brought this upon himself.
say is… give it time. You're only human, Steve. You're a good man, a really good man. Your heart is huge, and you always try your hardest to make everything okay. You're going to be all right, eventually." With a squeeze to Steve's shoulder, Tony lets go and stands up. "I think we both need a distraction, don't you?"
"They call it growth," he answered, standing and rolling the bag of chips closed. "Are you hungry?" He pulled the refrigerator open, peering inside. "There's plenty of leftovers."
"Enough of that!" Lecturing himself wasn't something he normally did, but sometimes it was necessary. He was not the greatest listener at the best of times, but if he was going to hear anyone, it would be his own damn self. "It's not like Steve knew you were going to hop into the future, and of course he'd need a friend. Naturally another Stark would fit the bill." Which was an awful thing to say, and he knew it. Tony wasn't a stand in for Howard. But it did make him feel a bit better.
"This!" Tony picked up Steve's hand, showing him the already healing bruises along the knuckles. "You punched someone. You punched- Damn it, Steve!" He was off him in an instant, running to the bathroom and wetting a washcloth, his movements jerky and annoyed. This was decidedly
As much as Pepper wanted to hate him, this Howard had redeemed himself with those words. "Yes, I believe you're right. The decision is Tony's, I'll stand by that. By him." They would be angry with her, but at the end of the day whether or not Howard returned with his memory intact or not was not up to them. "Tony is the smartest man I know, Mister Stark. He'll make the right decision."
"I was going to check out the MOMA today-" he paused, seeing Tony's face fall at the suggestion, "-But we could do something else?" And why did he sound so damn eager?
Tony would do it for them. Whatever it took. The least they could do was try to do the same for him.
"Invigorating," Bruce replied dryly. "Not sure I'd like to be there again, but I will say that tonight was fun."
"Please don't ever say 'romp' again." Looking back to Howard, he beckoned him in. "Let's just promise to talk as adults."
"I'm not ready to go back to the tower yet," Steve was saying, wiping his mouth with a napkin. "Honestly, it's so nice out, it'd be a shame to head back indoors."
Tony's face was burning. Not much made him embarrassed, just screaming his crush's name in front of him, and being groped on a subway apparently. It didn't help that those who had recognized him had their phones out, filming the exchange. The others surrounding them were looking furious, one man trying to move forward though the sardine can of a train car to help.
"This is Manhattan?" Howard asked, stepping closer to Steve. The soldier took a step back and Howard froze. Something was wrong here.
"You're welcome, dear." Grabbing the syrup, he dumped more onto the already drowning Belgium waffle.
"Okay, enough!" Howard snapped, jumping up again. "I get it! Apparently, I turn into some jerk and you all hate me for whatever travesty of a crime I committed.
had turned out to barely be worth the air he breathed, Tony was worth the whole of the atmosphere. Somehow, he had done that right. Despite it all, his child grew into a good and kind man, one willing to forfeit his own life for people he didn't even know.
It was his turn to shrug. "Maybe, but until we hear back from my contact, we have no leads. The notes for the memory serum arrived, and Bruce is hard at work with that. Fury called me, you know. Asking why we wanted it."
"He is beautiful." Thor spoke softly, coming up to their left side. "Will you let him reach his climax?"
die." At Tony's incredulous look, he smiles in understanding. "Let me explain. Your shell, and even your spirit body, which you're in now, can take damage. You will get sick, you will feel hunger. You will get injured. You can feel sadness and elation, loneliness and guilt—everything you had as a mortal. The only difference is that if something kills you, you only expend the shell. Your spirit body will ascend back up to Heaven where, I won’t lie, you will fill out a lot of paperwork and receive another shell. As long as your charges did not witness you dying, you can be sent back in the same design. With me so far?" Tony nods, taking it all in. It's a lot, but he is afraid to interrupt; he wants as much information as he can get before he makes a decision.
Shaking his head, Thor replied, "On the contrary, I think it will make us stronger to see such a love between two teammates. On Asgard, falling in love with a shield brother or sister is considered the most pure form of love. There is no bond stronger."
Tony nodded, a small miniscule movement that told Steve all he needed to know about his current mindset, "Okay."
Tony's head dropped as he neared his climax, the height coiling low, ready to strike. "Steve, oh fuck, Steve!" And he was coming. Completely untouched. His body seizing in the intensity and his nails scratching up Steve's shoulder blades. His thighs clenched as the streams of come spurt out like white ribbons being untied from a present.
Steve pushed back into Tony's mouth, pumping in and out for five strokes, savoring the feel of it before pulling out completely. "Now, I asked if I could come inside of you. Is that still a yes?"
"Oh. Wow. Thank you?" It's strange to think that Tony may have been entirely alone without Michael taking an interest in him.
Fandom called it a Fix-It. Something to make the bad things better. Maybe he could write about not only protecting Tony, but finally getting the guts to tell him the truth: That he loved him. That Steven Rogers was completely, irrevocably, 100% head over heels in love with Anthony Stark.
Once the sound of the door clicking shut was heard, Tony fell back against the mattress. "Tease," he grumbled, though a smirk played on his face. Steve would pay for that.
. Although, his therapist would have her work cut out if she ever got wind of his own father's comments about his ass (Not that he was wrong, mind you). Above him, the bed creaked.
Tony STILL thinks it's Natasha (What a dumb ass, amirite), and he and Steve have an outing. As friends of course. And they're totally not flirting with each other. Also there's smut.
They ate in the living room, balancing plates with steak, green beans, and potatoes on their laps, arguing over the finer details of whatever crime show they were watching on Netflix, Tony convinced it was the husband who killed his wife, and Steve sure it was the sister.
"Before we roofie our friend," Bruce said evenly, "we'll try eating healthier, which, let's face it, is good for all of us, and if that doesn't work, maybe an elimination diet?"
Tony shifted, hiding his face in Steve's shoulder, just for a moment, before he took a deep breath and returned to his previous position. But that meant he still wasn't facing Steve. It was his vulnerability acting, and Steve knew Tony enough to know it for what it was. It wasn't because Tony didn't trust him, not at all. It was simply a byproduct of being raised first by an abusive father and then betrayed by his godfather. It was a habit. A way to protect himself, to shield his eyes that spoke every word Tony held within himself. Steve was working on helping Tony fix that, to remove the proverbial sunglasses from his face.
Snorting loudly, Clint tilted his head back against the wall of the quinjet. "That's the understatement of the year."
He sounded much more awake than he should, and Tony inwardly groaned, "You're going for a run, aren't you?"
Tony can feel the tautness of what he's learning. This is important. And this will eventually break his heart. "How do you know?"
He knew Tony wouldn't go back to sleep. Was almost positive he would stay in the suite, at least, to avoid walking past the living room and seeing Howard. But he wouldn't sleep. Not until he was sure Steve was done with Howard and back next to Tony in bed.
"You're doing it, Pep." Tony gave her a grateful smile. "It's just something I have to work out. This whole thing with my dad isn't helping."
"It involves the Captain. We may have a lead." Hill glances at Tony and gestures to the door, "Perhaps we should step outside."
There was silence for all of five seconds before those near them in the car erupted in cheers. Others further down were looking up curiously. But the three fans stood silently, their phones still out. They were near each other, young and full of piss and vinegar. Quiet, but happily filming a celebrity getting sexually harassed.
Steve's smile - as forced as it was - faltered. "You haven't eaten anything Tony," he gently chastised, "you need something in your stomach."
There was a pause, and Bruce was sure JARVIS was speaking with Thor. He set out the tea cups while he waited. Tony (and Steve just by being with Tony and getting used to it) preferred the whole spread. Trays, fancy little dishes, and that quaint China set he’d inherited from his mother. Bruce couldn't care less. He wanted his tea as quickly as possible, and
"I need to process this, Tony." Howard was sure his own eyes were just as wide. The inside of his throat all the way down to his stomach was twisted, mixed up.
Steve sat, back to Tony, on the ground. Laptop open and scrolling through a Word document. Tony wondered what this story was about. He wondered at the way the city lights reflected off the blond locks, the way his shirt had ridden up—just a little in the back—leaving a smooth expanse of skin, and the way Steve's concentration was so wholly on his fictional world that he didn't hear Tony approach.
Rhodey laughed and it felt good. "I knew what I was getting into when I signed up to be the best friend of a fourteen year old genius."
Steve turned briefly to Howard, "Just, crap, stay there! Don't move!" And he was back to running down the hallway, following the sound of the slamming of Tony's suite door. He keyed in his code and was inside before Tony made it halfway across the room.
"By all means." She gestured with her hand for him to do so and fought back a triumphant grin at how he seemed afraid of her.
"Yeah," he said, stepping through the threshold. "Can I hold onto this? I found this list of acclaimed novels, and I started one, and it's really very good." He barely noticed Steve sitting uncomfortably on the couch as Tony led him to the bedroom. "The list is by some woman named Oprah Winfrey?"
Steve's head whipped around, glaring at the man and taking in how he was slowly moving up against Tony's backside and the gross way his hands were at Tony's hip and on his ass.
And though he knew that the soldier was not StonyFan1918, he still had to keep it fair, just in case. And, of course, as a scientist, he needed his hypothesis to be as complete as possible. For Science. Of course.
"Not at all." The doctor spoke in understanding. "But you did come back positive for celiac disease."
They each grabbed their own carts and set off, Clint headed in the wrong direction, before turning and sheepishly wheeling the other way.
Steve turned from the garbage he was trying to shove the empty pizza box into, "Are you kidding me? He only listens to me marginally more than he did before our relationship."
It was a bit too cold out to be sitting on the roof, and Clint cursed his own lack of foresight in not bringing a warmer coat with him. He shuffled his position, bringing his knees up to his chest and tucking his hands away, staring out into the early afternoon sky. It was quiet up there, which was what he was after.
"Just going to the workshop, honey-buns, nothing to see here." Tony slipped his robe on and walked back to the edge of the bed, "Go back to sleep, it's only six."
"Please," Tony was tugging at his hair, and it made Howard's heart ache. It wasn't that long ago that he was standing in Howard's borrowed room doing the same as he came out to him. "Just tell me, am I safe? I know you said-- I mean I kinda get it but-- just put me out of my damn misery, shit!"
In the kitchen, Pepper was waiting for them, sipping tea and talking quietly with Natasha. She beamed at Tony as he entered, her face lighting up at the sight of her closest friend.
"Love. And yes. Except him." She patted his knee and stood. "Don't fret on it. He's probably touching himself to the memory as we speak."
"Hey, stop doing that." There was a rustle of the leather couch as Rhodey moved. "Stop picking at your fingers, Tony."
"He only likes me because I can reach the top shelf!" Steve called out, blatantly yelling so Tony could hear him.
Retrieving one of the washcloths he had placed at the edge of the tub, Steve lathered it up with body wash, eucalyptus, the same scent Tony used daily.
He was completely, fully, irreversibly done with it all. Which led to him the end-cap at the Kirby's Market and Delicatessen torn between the cinnamon tea and the hibiscus. On one hand, the cinnamon tea was a comforting favorite. He knew he would like it. It was delicious and the type of warmth he craved. On the other hand, he had never tried hibiscus tea before, and it could
Tony popped a chip into his mouth, chewing thoughtfully. "True. We're only a few blocks from Central Park, we can walk through it to get back to the tower. There's always something going on there, maybe we'll find something to do." He paused and made a face reminiscent of a toddler faced with broccoli, "Also, I'm not too keen on stepping on a subway again."
Steve's mouth opened and shut spastically a few times before he was able to relay what he wanted to say. "I just don't want to see you get hurt."
"Wouldn't have it any other way, honey. Glad to be back." Stretching his neck, Tony plants a kiss on Rhodey's cheek. It's something he's done often enough to Rhodey's consternation, but this time, he silently allows it. He even goes so far as to press a kiss to Tony's head when he settles back down.
"You've reached the automated answering system of Tony Stark's Masturbation Hot-line. Please leave a message after the beep." he paused for dramatic effect. "Beep."
At the moment, he only cared about clearing his vision enough to properly assess the situation. And keep Tony safe.
Tony, well practiced in eye exams, did as he was told -- completely missing the innuendo -- and propped his chin up, adjusting his head until he could look through the lens. He closed one eye and began to read without being prompted. It was almost cute. "D...O...Y...O -- U? Is that a U or an O?"
"Fuck." Tony gasped, and boy did he have a dirty mouth. But Steve was loving it, ready to draw more of those curses and those sounds from him. Tony rocked his hips against Steve's thigh, clinging to his shoulders and tilting his neck for Steve, who took the opportunity to suck down the outstretched skin and back up, picking a spot behind his right ear to lavish attention on.
Tony kicked out at him lazily, his foot missing its target and flopping to the floor. "Clint will probably be game. And he can fly the jet."
. We know our way around this business. We've been burnt, kicked, chewed up, and spit out like a bad piece of beef jerky.
"Oh, Tony," Steve whispered, getting to his feet and sitting next to him. He tugged the afghan from the back of the couch and wrapped it around his shoulders. It was time for maximum comfort (patent pending), and he pulled Tony's legs over his lap, drawing him close enough to wrap his arms around him.
It took a second to get his body back under control. He had never felt this way before just by looking at someone. Steve wasn't an idiot, though. He knew relations between men were sinful and more than frowned upon. But that didn't stop him from appreciating the gorgeous man before him.
Tony hummed in approval, "I'll take it."  He tilted his head up, stealing a kiss and smiling coyly, "Or, you can put your dick inside me and say you're sorry that way."
"Because we think it's what you're eating that's making you feel like this. So, if you won't go to the doctor, we're going to try changing your diet. Ours too. We'll eat what you eat, I promise."
Steve returned to Tony's suite to find him asleep on the bed, his head where his feet should be, and the television on. He was curled up in one of Steve's sweaters that he had shamelessly stolen, his hair still damp from the bath he had taken. At least he had tried to relax and succeeded too, if the peaceful look on his sleeping face was any indication. But Steve knew Tony better than that. Sleep was an escape, and if he was out at only half past four in the afternoon, he knew Tony had to have been exhausted.
Inside, the din faded and then completely vanished once the elevator doors closed. It was surreal, that difference between outside and in. But Tony supposed that oftentimes, that was just the way it was. He felt that way every day, keeping his demeanor to the public one way, but another in private.
Tony looked at Steve and again said, "My hero." This time, it was with obvious cheek, and the first man laughed.
Large, wide brown eyes that had the girls adoring him like he was their baby brother and the guys pushing and shoving him around in jealousy of his brain and of how he looked.
"No," Rhodey said slowly, "I don't think it's going to be that easy at all. But it's worth a shot, right?"
They talked with him about college, about what his goals were, small talk that turned into something bigger when Tony found out that he was in school for engineering. Angelo's father was a mechanic on the island, and he loved machines and technology. Tony got his name and number, tucking it away and making a true promise to get him an intern position at Stark Industries for the summer, so long as his grades were good. Angelo promised they were, and took their orders, a happy hop on his step as he raced back into the kitchen to share the news with his co-workers.
idea. He scooted up to the head of the bed and onto his back, twinning his fingers with Tony's as the smaller man lifted one knee to fit himself over Steve's body, hovering over his length that was already again erect. Steve let his fingertips glide up Tony's thighs and around to his ass, squeezing and kneading the round globes as Tony grabbed the lube and slicked Steve.
Because of course he was. But even though it was Natasha who asked, Bruce called Steve. He didn't know what Tony's mindset was at the moment, but he did know Steve could be counted on to best relay the information. And Tony
"Think he'll kill Howard?" She could tell he was only partly joking, but it was the part that wasn't that worried her.
to give them bang for their buck. It's headlining or nothing. They're not paying $500 for front row to see us sing five songs."
"Not at all." Clint said, checking his watch. "I gotta go. I'll send you the link to that porn, seriously, hot as fuck." He stood. "I'll take the door this time, also, nice mug." And he was gone.
"There's like three cookies in there!" Clint whined, grabbing two more packages off the shelf. "You need to get enough!"
As Tony's eyes darken for the last time, he sees Michael's wings unfold and surround them. The pain lessens, and he feels warm. Secure. Loved.
Tony squeaked (though if you asked him later, he most certainly did not!). But he really didn't want a scene, so he just ignored the man behind him and let go of the 'Oh Shit Bar' to hook his arm onto Steve's and move away from the dirt-bag that found it perfectly okay to grab someone's ass.
"Not at all. I should also mention no manager in the past ten years has lasted longer than four months with them."
The crunching of snow beside him stops, and Tony turns to see that Steve is frozen where he stands, the snow drifting around his features, with a dumbfounded expression on his face. It makes Tony blush, just a bit. He is fully aware that this is probably revealing  too much, but he can't bring himself to care. He
He was angrily wiping his eyes as the door shut behind him, mad at himself for letting Howard get to him, and for allowing his emotions to take control. He was a grown man, for Christ's sake! Crying over how daddy didn't love him enough was something his teenage self did. Not a forty-three year old superhero.
to, but Natasha and Clint made it clear. I can't change it." Steve wouldn't look at Howard, so he moved, stepping into Steve's vision and adjusting every time he looked away. "I'm asking for your help, please!"
Tony is more than his genius. More than his looks. He's kind and funny. Giving and sassy. He's so much more than a lustful want. He's everything Steve could have hoped for in a partner. And everything he never thought he needed.
"Take a load off," Tony gestured, seating himself on an old but comfortable looking lounger. He swung his legs up and leaned back, looking for all the world like a cat lazing in the sun.
Steve was obviously conflicted, looking back and forth between the bacon and Tony. "You're making me choose between sex and food. Again. That's not fair." Tony smirked, trailing his hand down his abdomen. He was just about to touch himself when Steve snapped his eyes shut and swung around to face the stove. "Nope! Your wiles will not work on me, demon! Go! Be gone!" He wildly gestured in the vicinity of the bathroom, the spatula flapping up and down.
Unable to keep any modicum of composure, Tony turned his head to Hill, his face painted with fear and shock, like a child's art project: All haphazard splatter of bold colors. "Please," his voice was hoarse with his panic, loud, uncontrolled. Wavering with the implications. "Hill, for the love of of fucking everything! Tell me there's a way! Tell me I'm not going to die? To-to not exist?"
Something sparked between them, and Steve cracked. He dropped the wad of cash on the table by the door and grabbed Tony, pushing him against the wall and kissing him hard.
"I'm-" She paused, surprised at how happy she felt despite the situation. Although, she really shouldn't be all that shocked that she was. She loved both of them and loved them together. Of course she'd feel happy to learn they were good. "I'm glad...I mean I'm really glad to hear that. And it's bad timing, but we need you. In the living room. We have information pertaining to Howard."
When the drugs wear off, he feels more than a little guilty, but in that moment, Tony was doing what he thought he had to.
Steve scoffed, and Bruce threw him a glare. He schooled his features. "Just because Howard decided to take a trip through time doesn't mean he gets to monopolize Tony's time."
"What do you mean?" Steve was looking up at him, a tentative hope dancing across his handsome features.
"Any idea where he would be?" Bruce asked, crossing his arms, completely unaffected by the live fuck show he was witness to.
He gave her an eyebrow raise. "It's lust, Nat. I'm not in love with him, I mean I love him as a friend? But not like that. Tony is sexy as fuck, who wouldn't want to fuck him so hard he can't walk straight."
"No. With their experience, both Pepper and Happy could have found jobs that pay just as much. They stayed for
"You should work for Hollywood," Tony had quipped as Joseph strategically ripped the bottom of his pants.
"I think we'll have to explore that later. For now," he hooked his arm around Steve's waist and pulled him onto the bed and laid next to him, both on their sides, "let's get on with that whole coming inside me thing you've been going on about."
Steve's laugh disappeared into the bathroom. He returned moments later with a wet washcloth and lifted Tony's legs to wipe his bottom and thighs before cleaning himself up as well.
Chuckling softly, Steve carefully removed Tony's octopus hold from his body. "Shower, then we'll talk."
He also let slip that he never wanted children. There was a change of heart at some point, obviously. But, it did nothing to save Tony from Howard's personal brand of upbringing.
"Gets migraines a lot, really pale now. Totally exhausted. Sometimes it just, uh, goes right through him," Clint added, trying to not sound gross for once in his life.
The flashes of the cameras were blinding and Tony had to raise an arm in front of his face to keep from stumbling. They sent white stars across his vision and despite feeling better than he had, he was still not ready to deal with the media's tenacity.
Rhodey drummed out a beat on Tony's knees, a contemplative look on his face. "Where would we even start?"
Tony groaned, narrowing his eyes and looking confused for all of a second before giving in and snatching a cookie from the proffered plate. "Platypus, you don't even like cucumbers." He smiled coyly, "I like cucumbers. Different types too. Particularly Steve's." He turned slightly to point at Steve with an innocent smile.
"Get your cute ass moving! We leave in 20!" Natasha's voice sounded a bit muffled through the wooden frame.
"And, apparently, no carrots," Tony says, standing up straight, "but we do have a parsnip. And that's basically the same thing."
Sitting, Pepper spoke calmly, but with an authoritative edge in her voice he knew to mean that he better pay attention or else. "Steve is blinded by his love for Tony, and Bruce can't be anywhere near Howard for too long or he'll force me to have this place remodeled. Again. And Thor is not on earth. That leaves you and Natasha, Agent Barton, to be objective and watch out for Tony."
"Tony! What brings you to this neck of the woods?" He was smiling, beaming at Tony and his unexpected visit. In Tony's mind, he took a picture. He wanted to remember what could possibly be the last time that smile would ever be directed toward him.
Something about Steve calling him angel was driving Tony nuts, what he wouldn't give to hear that for real.
In Steve's arms with his blankie tucked up against his chin, Tony finds the sleep he had sought after. He's warm and sated, comfortable and safe. In the morning, he holds Steve's hands against his chest, watching the sparks of blue as his eyelids flutter open. The storm outside calms. Clear skies ahead.
building. He had confided in Bruce early on that when they all first moved in he was worried he wouldn't be so readily accepted. The larger apartment had been for him to hide out in.
Tony snorts into his champagne, looking up from his seat at the dining room table at Steve. He's standing, his own flute raised, looking around the table at his teammates and friends. The Avengers, Pepper, Rhodey, and Happy, all dressed in their evening best. On the table sits their New Year's Day meal, a pork loin, asparagus, roasted potatoes, and baby carrots, all prepared by Bruce and Steve. The smell is heavenly, coalesced with the scent of fresh baked dinner rolls and a hint of the candles lit at either end.
Tony's nails raked down Steve's chest, "Yes, Doctor!" Sweat had gathered at his hairline, one droplet rolling down the side of his face.
The nod he gives is barely perceptible. "Yes, I do. Have to hide me. Have to hide it. She saved my life."
Not like it mattered; no other manager could stand to deal with their know-it-all, blunted view of the industry for more than a couple of months. She worried at the suffocating implications of that. Drugs she could handle, co-dependency not so much.
They were both wrong, but that didn't stop the guessing, and when Bruce returned during the opening credits of the next episode, he took one look at the two of them on the couch, pulled out his phone, and high tailed it out of there.
The exclamation had Steve grinning around Tony's cock. Gently, with one hand pressed against Tony's abdomen, he pushed Tony back against the chair, slowly bobbing his head as he did so, his other hand anchored on Tony's left thigh.
Tony's whole body tensed in pleasure, and as Steve glanced up, his eyes snapped closed. With a grin, Steve went back to it, pressing his tongue against Tony's opening and licking up to his balls before trailing back down. He closed his mouth over the puckered circle and lightly sucked. Above him, Tony's hands clamped to the back of the chair, his head tilted back as he struggled to keep his legs from closing around Steve's shoulders, forcing himself to keep his knees apart, his ass open.
"That was weird." Steve commented, his arm over the back of the couch behind Tony. He was itching to drape it over the smaller man's shoulders.
From his position on his knees in front of Tony, he could look up into the impossibly large and frightened eyes of his son. A small twist to the right showed him Steve, his own blue eyes spilling tears down his cheeks.
"Tell me something I don't know," Tony said, giving Steve one if his sassiest looks. As usual, Steve was completely unmoved; Tony's patented looks never really had any effect on him.
"It's enlightening." Steve said. "Look at us, so busy trying to skirt passed the fallout of the invasion, we're not even living." He turned to Tony, "There's a lesson here."
"She was already pissed off!" Tony shoots back, his own glare just as fierce. "Or did the fact that she
That startled a laugh out of Tony; he always enjoyed when Steve referenced his favorite things. "I know. I love you, Sam." He could wait another hour, Steve knew. If anything it meant he could ignore the situation for just a little longer. Tony wasn't the only one well versed in his boyfriend's thought processes.
Raising his eyebrows, Steve gave him a pointed look. "Do you get it now? I don't care that you're not perfect, anyway, I'm not even close myself. I like you better this way. I love you not perfect. I love your flaws because they make you who you are. I want to be with you, I want to help you heal from everything that's happened to you, just like I know you want to help me. And I'm not saying it's an overnight fix. These things take time. But, Tony, we have the rest of our lives to figure that out."
He kissed her forehead. "We will. I got it taken care of. Just start thinking of what ya gonna wear when we get there and you feel better and can go out dancing again."
He was still just as handsome as the days when she had his poster on the wall above her bed, his smile just as dashingly cheeky.
knew and somehow trying to reconcile that Howard with the one who raised Tony (and raised fists to him as well) with the Howard who was holed up in the guest room not fifty feet from him. It was all too much. Too many pieces to fit into a puzzle that shouldn't have been so huge. Pieces that absolutely fit somewhere but seemed too big, too bold, too off color with the picture he had in his head. He felt like a toddler just learning his shapes, trying to fit the circle block into the square hole. Cramming it against the edges like he could force it to make sense.
"I know," Steve offered, "but it is what it is. Maybe we can use this to our advantage? It might be nice to form
, Tony fumbles with the buttons before he's able to turn out the light on his side. Steve keeps begging him, pleading with him to talk. Taking the pillow Steve threw, Tony buries his face in it, inhaling a scent that is wholly Steve. It smells like his shampoo and aftershave, post battle sweat and the detergent he uses. It's as close as he'll allow himself. He almost destroyed Pepper. He won't allow himself to do that to Steve.
