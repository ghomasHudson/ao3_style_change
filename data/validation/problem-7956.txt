And hey, Tony would be free for a while, right? Tony was a scientist through and through, and magic was practically a dirty word in his book. Worse than a dirty word, probably, given the way Tony’s mouth tended to run. Though Steve felt kind of bad for thinking it, there probably wouldn’t be much need for Tony’s talents here, either. They could spend some time together.
and a hand on his shoulder. He failed them, and he owes them, maybe even more than he owes the world. In the end, it isn’t really a choice at all. The word
“What’s it gonna cost me?” Tony murmured, suddenly very close. Steve’s flirtatious repertoire failed him all at once and he hoped the dimness wasn’t showing too much of the heat in his face. He had given up on keeping the heat in his belly down.
Lunch wasn’t much better. Steve tried to start off by apologizing, getting the previous night out of the way and making it clear that he wasn’t going to try anything again, but Tony just shut him down.
It’s definitely not because he’s running.
It’s been a long, long time since he allowed himself to linger, to daydream, to immerse himself in the fantasy of that sensation, and it’s almost overwhelming. He wants it so badly. His mouth waters. His fingers shake while he types, tells his AI exactly why it must never accept that perfect forgetfulness. How it will hurt the top of the priority sequence the most. The AI will know exactly how good, and how awful, every moment of this feels.
—smile to thank the bartender.
, but because he could do the Charleston in his sleep by now, and what he really wanted was to watch Tony. Tony was really something, anywhere and everywhere, but the way he moved when he danced was enough to make Steve’s mouth go dry, all sinuous grace and smooth movements that made his body look elegant and mouthwatering at the same time. Even the robes that had looked so ridiculous an hour ago were transformed by the sheer power of Tony in motion; Steve caught the word
the type to go above and beyond in helping people, even if it wasn’t his forte. That was probably it.
None of that experience is quite like making an AI version of
. He looked happy.
If he doesn’t, well, he’ll never have to live with it.
. The first thing Ross takes is the phone.
But looking was so simple a word. The mans’ shadowed eyes were hot, assessing,
No, that’s a lie.
“Uh, not really, no,” Steve answered, but that topic was played out, and getting back into it was just an exercise in futility. Tony looked sort of relieved as he pivoted the question to a new topic, something inane that Steve didn’t remember when he went down to the firing range after lunch in hopes that slinging his shield around would do some good clearing his head.
“Did you know?” Tony asks Steve when Steve pulls him back, away from the Winter Soldier. He is desperate and his insides are roiling in agony, but he holds himself in check, does his best to contain everything he’s feeling inside his armor. His control is like a thread of old cobweb, once stronger than steel but now half-degraded, ready to fall to dust at the lightest touch. His eyes feel wet and hard, but he refuses to look away from Steve.
“Why what?” Steve said dumbly. He couldn’t look away from the unicorn’s dark, amused eyes.
And as he pushed in again Steve did his best to obey and keep his angle steady. It was pure bliss sliding in and out, riding the edge of too much, and he just wanted it to be good for Tony before he inevitably—
Tony’s a coward, so he starts with the easy things. The things he likes. Sarcasm. Snark. The ability to reference obscure science fiction in the middle of a battle. Some teaching routines, in case Kamala or Sam or Miles want homework help again. Riri probably won’t, but he programs routines for her, too. He gives them some literary analysis and language programming besides, because there’s no reason he can’t improve on the original a little.
“All right there?” Steve asked him.
Steve was starting to wonder whether stubbornness was just a synonym for denial.
And tomorrow, he would be.
“I think I could arrange something, handsome fella like you,” he said. It was electrifying to hear the want in Tony’s voice, to shape
They’ll probably just bury him in the pod.
But then, as he watches, more and more routines appear, linked and tangled in with the Iron Man files. They are messy code, patched and disjointed and rough, strewn with notes and links to memory files. They contradict each other, and they are so often destructive. He does not know how to feel, but looking at the rest of himself, he thinks that he does not want to learn.
“Maybe one,” Steve replied. “I do a pretty all right nickel tour, if you’re interested.”
“Gonna show me how
Steve took a few more deep breaths, and did.
Steve’s eyes widened. He hadn’t realized the robes were an actual
Underneath them both was the pleased strength of Friday, who was thinking about their misunderstandings in a tone that felt almost like sarcasm. At the same time, she seemed almost ecstatic that they were willing to do this just for the ability to speak with her. Steve got the feeling that she’d liked humans before who hadn’t been so attached to her in return, who hadn’t felt the need to speak with her the way Tony did. Ones who had valued their own selfish pleasures over her voice.
were here and I liked you
“Well, now I do, and I want them inside me.” Tony’s grin was bold and infectious, and Steve couldn’t help but concede. He wedged the spare pillow under Tony’s hips and leaded over him to grab the lube and the smaller of the two condoms, but he froze with his hand extended, because Tony—
were the last few inches between them finally erased, skin to skin and not quite enough. After a moment, Steve cleared his throat to break up the sudden lump there.
“Hey, it’s not like I said
Tony wants so much to believe that he was wrong when he told the team that this was the best option. He wants to believe that it would be right to fight his way out and run away and cast off the weight of guilt on his shoulders, if only to be able to breathe again. But all he can think of is Rhodey,
Iron Man is straightforward: armor, intelligence, goodness,
Finally, he finds the strength to open the book and start drawing. He looks up and finds that he’s drawing Stark Tower and has to stifle a hysterical laugh. He’s come full circle.
Yeah, they thought together. They were going to be fine.
“Did you know?” Tony asks. His heart is fluttering like a hummingbird with anger and fear as he leaves it in Steve's hands, to keep or crush as he chooses. He can only watch and wait on tenterhooks, hoping against hope that the all-too-fragile organ will survive.
slips away into the ether like a mirage.
“It’s easiest on your front,” Steve told him. Tony just shook his head.
“No, no, I just…” Tony began. “I just have some surgical scarring, and it’s not exactly pretty. You can touch, you’ve been touching, but I’d rather keep the shirt on.”
“Steve, it’s really okay. I’m having a great time, and we don’t have to stop unless you need to. Are you okay?”
“What is it?” Steve asked. “I can stop if you’d rather—“
Tony did it immediately, without even asking why—though the
matter—“
After a while, he’s brave enough to ask them about politics.
Steve started out with what he knew—not because he didn’t know any other dances,
It’s awful to think that all those futures he saw when he looked at Tony are cut off at the root, now. It’s awful to look at the graves and think that all of these were futures, too, to their wives and husbands and children and friends, but Tony doesn’t get a choice and Steve—as much as he wants one—shouldn’t have one either, then.
“Tony?” he said gently.
Steve had no answer that wasn’t far too flattering, so he just kissed Tony again and swallowed his laughter, both of them breaking off into groans when Tony’s firm grip on his thighs brought their hips together. Steve was less than half hard, and Tony was more—ah youth—but they might as well have been fully hard and aching for how good the heat and pressure felt on Steve’s long-neglected dick. That pressure was
Maybe Tony's trying too hard to make what happened
It’s assuaged, a little bit at least, by the work he does every night to keep the shield’s owner safe. Steve is traveling aimlessly, as far as Tony can tell. He’s not completely stupid—he
Tony’s movements brought him in close to Steve’s body, closer than before, so close that his breath washed over Steve’s face, and all at once Steve’s rhythm faltered. His leg got in Tony’s way and tripped him up, but his hands were gripping at Tony’s waist almost before he started to fall. The contact shocked them both into stillness, neither of them moving except to breathe. To share breath. Tony was so close and so hot under Steve’s hands and his muscles trembled minutely. The touch of his body felt like fire, like pure electricity going down Steve’s spine.
“Soon,” he said. “Here, give me your hand.”
“What happened to you?” Steve asked, keeping his eyes down so he wouldn’t see whatever expression was on Tony’s face as he worked—and so Tony wouldn't see his, which was surely far too tender. He had already finished with all the visible bruising on Tony’s arm and side and was moving up to his abraded face by the time Tony answered, so he was perfectly in position to see the contemptuous twist to his mouth.
"And he feels bad for nearly killing her." Steve cut in, smirking at Tony before taking a sip of his coffee. "and so when she asked him to be the celebrity guest for her boyfriend's grand dive bar opening he just couldn't refuse."
"They have no shame." Steve commented as he continued to scroll.
Steve cleared his throat trying to ignore the intrusive thoughts that filled his mind up. Watching the way Tony pulled his shirt up, exposing his tanned, very toned stomach, and it just about made Steve forget how to breathe - but then Tony - with his arms stuck above his head groaned for help and it snapped Steve out of it."Here-" he sighed as he stepped into the room, hooking his fingers under the fabric of the stuck shirt and yanking it over the others head, allowing it to join Tony's jacket on the floor.
This night, saved forever in a selfie, was the first night Tony realized that what he felt for Steve was a lot more than admiration and sexual attraction. It was a photo of the night he realized he actually loved Steve Rogers. And also realized how too chicken shit he was to actually do anything about it.
Pepper chuckles, but Maria isn't as humored. "You post things, get followers, people start to like you, they get to know the real you." She pauses and then shrugs. "Well maybe not the real you, the social media you."
Everyone has managed to crawl out of their daily hiding holes to come up for dinner, an odd, albeit domestic side of the team that's just sort of fallen into place. In times where they weren't on missions, or in meetings, or away from the city, or the planet, they convene in the kitchen at the end of a day. A ritual, almost.
"Did anyone else see that?" Clint laughed into the coms.
Tony felt like ass. No, that was an insult to ass. Tony felt like week old garbage left outside in the middle of a New York blizzard, only to be defrosted and nibbled on by the rats. Tony felt like he was going to die. He tried to crack open an eye, only to instantly regret the decision, as shooting pain came like waves through his skull.
"Hi." Steve stepped forward, offering her a kind smile. "It's nice to finally meet you Miss Potts."
Tony's eyebrows lifted in question immediately as he watched the barefoot super soldier step out of the elevator, looking almost as surprised as he was. He watched Steve carefully, as he sat up in his chair, and asked Jarvis to mute his extremely loud music. Steve would wonder how it didn't radiate through the entire tower sometimes, but it was Tony and there were far more mysterious things about him than how he managed good soundproofing.
"No wait!" Clint interrupted. "I bet you can't name everyone without any help."
"Hear about what?" Steve asked, finally snapping his attention back to the room and not Tony.
He's sweating from working, his T-shirt is sticking to him, and he notices that Tony is staring, because he stops working, and takes a drink of whatever he has in a bottle beside the hay, all the while holding Tony's gaze. "Do you need something?" He says, as he swallows.
"Have a good day Tony." Steve smiles, ignoring his pleas.
"Where was your head today Iron man!" The voice is stern and angry, and Tony flinches when he hears it.
"Right." Tony was still tinkering with his armor, already fully aware of the current state of the country, with a firm understanding of why exactly they were about to suit up and go talk to a group of high school kids.
"How was your day?" Steve asked, turning his attention out the large widows, as if for reference before back down at his paper.
"You two had a whole entire life together." Bucky said quietly, if he had noticed Tony's tears he wasn't saying anything.
The rest of the meal hurried, people dropped their dishes into the sink before heading out the door. Bucky muttering how they're going to be late to the airport, and Sharon complaining that the shops had opened up an hour ago. Clint was not in any type of a rush to get anywhere, except for back on the sofa, where he stretched out and promptly fell right back to sleep.
Tony racked his brain for any memory of that, but there was nothing. He sighed loudly into his room, guess no memories meant no bad memories, so at least he could assume he had a good time, and if it was a bad time, well he wouldn't remember anyways.  With a groan, Tony forced himself up and out of bed, stopping to pull his phone out of his discarded jeans on the floor as he made his way to the bathroom. First thing first, he would have a shower, and then he could down half a bottle of painkillers with a very large, very black cup of coffee, before heading to the shop to complete some upgrades before he got his ass kicked. Natasha had been bugging for upgraded gauntlets for weeks now, and he had promised to get them done.
Tony barked out another laugh, stepping towards the elevator with Steve's help. His head was fuzzy and light and he felt like he could go dancing as well as go straight to bed at the same time. "You're so nice to me Stevie."
"No." Steve sighed. "Clint called her and said there's an issue with the flowers and he can't find me, and I guess Bucky misplaced the ring."
"Yeah." Natasha said with a shrug.
"You have to be fucking kidding me." Tony groaned in exasperation.
"She does, but that doesn't help solve my problem here."
"Alright, hold up." Tony held a palm up with one hand, carding a hand through his hair with the other. "I am so confused Steve, please, help me out here. Spell it out."
"Steve." Tony tried.
"Steve." He breathes again, feeling his head get light and his blood drain. Steve only grunts, because he's close and his body is tensing up again, and he's not able to stop himself. Tony knows he's only seconds behind but as it hits him, causing his body to shake in release, so does a wave of emotion he didn't expect.
"Did Natasha know?" Tony found himself asking, not really sure if he wanted to know the answer to the question. "Did they all know?"
"It's not love." He argues. "Its infatuation at the most." and he can no longer tell if hes trying to convince her, or himself of that, because the lines have gotten very blurry all of a sudden, and he's not sure he can think himself out of this mess. Pepper warns him just to be careful and to not get himself hurt, he wont, or so he says. It might actually be too late to make that promise.
"Uh, Okay.." Tony replied, drawing out the a in Okay, and then he sighed. "Is this for another Instagram thing?"
They knock noses, and Steve's hips buck upwards, and it's all Tony can do to cry out into the room, he needs more, he wants more. Before he can even ask, Steve's hand has slid between them and his fingers have wrapped around Tony, long drawn out strokes with every twist of Tony's hips. "Steve-" Tony gasps, pressing his forehead into Steve's, his arms have slithered their way around his neck, and his nails dig into the strong muscles of his shoulders.
After paying the cab, and watching it literally leave him in the dust, Tony turned back to the farmhouse.  This was the moment of truth for him, he was headed into the lions den with the best intentions. Still, he couldn't help what Pepper had said to him. The Heart whats what it wants - It was something Tony could spend a life time studying. How could the heart want something that had caused it so much pain, but if the late night reunion had proved nothing else, it was that Tony still missed him.
Natasha's lips fell into a small frown, and that really felt like answer enough, but it wouldn't stop her from using her words. "He told us everything, and if it helps he really came off as an asshole in his version of events so I can only imagine how you're feeling."
Tony made his way to the hotel restaurant, seating himself at a table by a window, and immediately ordering coffee before pulling out his phone. He flicked through the few updates that Bruce had sent over the night, and one from Pepper who's subject line read
Tony reluctantly took the few steps across to the counter where Steve had laid the plate. "And how did that work out for you?" He asked, taking a forkful of the pasta noodles, though the raise of his eyebrow made Steve feel like he already knew the answer.
"You're the one that set the alarm." Tony chuckles, and his voice isn't far, just on the edge of the bed if Steve had to guess. There's some shuffling, and then he can feel the mattress dip as Tony lays back down behind him. "It's a beautiful morning."
Tony typed back
"Steve." Pepper's voice is soft, and Steve immediately clocks it as the one she uses on Tony when he's in a particularly desperate need of sleep, or food, or general babying. "You have to help us out here, we're just trying to make you more relatable It's not just for your sake, it's for the whole team."
Pepper's words rang clear in Tony's head, closure. Maybe that was all he needed. Slowly, he rubbed at his forehead and tried to debate the pros and cons of just letting it go before he shrugged. "Okay." he answered, dropping his arm to his side. It was all he could offer, and he hoped that Steve could just accept it
"Might be important." Steve mumbled against his skin, just as his phone started ringing for a third time.
"Are you cyber stalking me?"
"Aye aye Captain." Iron man used his thrusters to pull back, looking to the ground to Spot Steve in his bright blue uniform, an easy target, before swooping down low for a pick up. His arm shot out and Cap leaped into it, wrapping his own arms around the shoulders of the Iron Man Suit, something they had done many times, like a second nature to both of them,
"I always have time for you." Steve smirked, pushing himself away from the kitchen island. "I also want to ask you a favor."
"Most people do." Tony grinned. "I will be a little late to the party though, the present I ordered you is delayed and I have them bringing it to the hotel."
"Yeah, that's a security no-no." Tony nodded to himself, spinning the laptop to face himself and prying open the top. His lips pursed at the cracked screen, before he glanced back up at Steve. "A little pent up aggression?"
"I'd dedicate a song to you on the radio if they still did that" he said as he turned around, eyeing Steve over, his brown eyes slowly dragging up all of Steve, and it made the blonde feel a little warm and a little exposed. "You know-" Tony said cocking his head to the side, allowing his voice to drop. "When you stand like that, with your arms crossed and all-" he waved his hand around trying to convey a message "I just strip you naked and ride you."
More time passed before a girl pouring out of her dress slid up against him, she smelt of cheap vodka and vanilla, and had begun shouting into his ear over the music in the bar. "Want to take me home?" she had asked, and normally, Tony would have some sort of shotgun answer. On a regular day he'd thank her, compliment her, and still manage to send her packing, but this time he had nothing while he stood there blank.  A telltale sign he was officially too drunk.
"Tony." Steve wanted it to come out firm, a request to stop, but it was more of a croak, he looked over at his friend, because that's what they were, friends, he wanted to appear stern, but had clearly failed because all he got back from Tony was a beaming smile.
Steve noticed, of course Steve noticed, Tony could feel his blue eyes burning into him. "It certainly felt like it." Steve said pushing out of his chair, and grabbing the photo album out of Natasha's lap. "Is Clint alive?"
"Your boyfriends lips on my face." Clint replies, with another snort.
Tony just smiles wide, appreciating his efforts being successful, and then he's climbing on top of Steve with ease, and they move together like two bodies with one mind. It's incredible, it always is. Every touch sends Steve's skin tingling, and his stomach flipping. Every kiss is well placed and well received. They move in sync, both chasing the same high, both receiving the same payout.
"Which is apparently every round." Natasha inspected her cards before tossing her chips in. "Raise."
"What?" Tony forced a smile, it didn't quite reach his eyes, but it was there. "Did you just say - J, please tell me you recorded that, please. Cap said I was right."
There were mechanical sounds, the suit retracting with each step Tony made, falling back to where exactly Tony wanted it to go, precise and clean.
"What?" Natasha shot up on to her knees. "He left you a voice mail? What the fuck Tony."
"Here you are." Steve echoed, as he came to a stop a few feet away. "You look-"
The reporter stuttered, and it gave Sam a chance to grab the microphone right out of her hand. "Thirdly, let the man kiss who he wants he's a hundred years old, damn guys!"
"Huh." She turned on her heel, following Steve as she spoke. "That's a lot less exciting than I was hoping for."
"Oh yes." Natasha said, gently nudging Jame's hip with her own and motioning for him to grab the bottle of wine behind him, before she headed towards the doors herself. He obliged and followed her out towards the deck.
"Who uses speed dial anymore Tones?" Rhodey sighed "And who's number one?"
Tony had taken his time, the wedding wasn't until 2, it wasn't going to take him five hours to get a suit to a farm house. So he took another shower, and cleaned up his facial hair carefully working around each sharp angle.  Then he fixed his hair, choosing to use less product than normal, because it was after all an outside wedding and Steve always liked his hair a little windswept.
"Just tell her you demanded, threatened, whatever it is you like to do to people." Tony shrugged. "I took care of it and I promise you they will be here, but I don't want Natasha to know I had any part of it."
"You're right." Steve finally said, connecting his thoughts into something that made sense. "I'm sorry Tony."
' in the background. "Uh yeah, Cap, I'm pretty sure that's going to make a statement - hey look, Pepper is about to meltdown so I gotta go."
"But she will be." Bucky says dropping his arm from around Sam. "And I think part of that is thanks to you."
When the elevator stopped at the floor once more, Tony could barely contain his excitement. The grin splitting his face as the doors opened revealing both Steve and Bucky, mid conversation about something, that quickly ended when Steve's eyes fell onto Tony.
"I'm going to miss my flight." Tony sighed, reluctantly stepping away from Steve.
"What makes you think I'm going to get one?" Steve wants to be offended, but they both know the power of Pepper, and Hill - alone they were forces, combined it was foolish to resist.
"It's not often I get visitors this late." Tony grinned, which only outlined the grease he had up his cheek and around his forehead, he looked completely disheveled in a way Steve had never seen before, and to be honest, Steve kind of liked it.
"And -" Tony starts, finally looking at Steve, meeting those sweet baby blues and feeling his chest swell. "Steve you didn't lose me again, it kills my pride to admit this, but I don't think you ever really lost me in the first place. I am scared though, and I need you to know that."
"Huh?" Tony asks, prying his eyes from his phone, towards the television where Natasha has turned her attention. It's a late night infomercial for a frying pan made out of gold, and he's not quite sure what's happening, but he catches Natasha glancing at him, a curious look on her face, and he thinks he gets it.
Steve doesn't argue, in fact he quotes him for the caption, and posts before he stuffs his phone back into his pocket and heads back to the team for debrief and clean up.
"Aren't you supposed to be the boy genius?" Steve asked, before shifting on the couch so he was able to reach into his pocket, pulling out a small black box.
"Only once." Sam offered.
"Wow." Clint's commentary did not go unpunished, as it was quickly followed up with a yelp, likely by Natasha's doing, but Tony didn't see. Tony was too busy staring at Steve.
"Kiss!" Someone yelled and it only took a second for everyone to start clinking their glasses
"Aw, it's okay cap." Barton clapped a hand over his shoulder. "There's always gotta be one pooper in the group."
He exchanges a look with Thor which only proves that neither of them really know what that means, but then something sparks in Thor's eye and he perks up.
"And then you what?" She questioned, almost basking in the look of recognition that flashed over her bosses face. "You forgot to press send didn't you?"
"It wasn't a stripper." Clint hollered above the conversation around them as he entered the kitchen, throwing a thumb over his shoulder, as Tony entered the kitchen behind him. "It was just Tony."
Maybe they were friends, Tony hadn't been friend-zoned before, well that wasn't exactly true, Rhodey had friend zoned him, but he hadn't been friend-zoned by someone he had sex with before. This was definitely a first, but if it meant spending time with Steve, Tony would take it. And just remember the brief moments he had more than that while he was alone and in the shower.
"I'm going to bury you in the middle of Central Park and no one is going to find you for days." Tony narrowed his eyes at the archer, before turning a softer gaze onto Steve. "Are you sure you don't want to come be my date tonight?"
"I love you too." Tony mumbled back around the rim of his mug, shuffling back down towards his workshop.
The first time Tony initiated all of it, it was nice to not be in control for once in his life, but Tony doesn't say anything because he doesn't want it to stop. They move slowly this time, at least more so than the first time. It's all a lot of touching and and kissing before Steve turns Tony around and bends him over the back of the penthouse couch. Even then his movements are far less frantic, breathing in every inch of Tony that he can. This time Steve finishes first, digging his teeth into Tony's shoulder as he does. It only lasts a moment though, and then Steve is pulling away, and Tony has to bite his own tongue to hold back his complaints of emptiness. But then Steve's hands are back on his hips, turning Tony back around before dropping to his knees and finishing Tony off with his mouth.
Steve frowned as he watched Tony walk away. "I'm not a party pooper."
"Well fuck you guys." Clint leaned back into the couch. "I still don't think Steve is the kind to let a drunk Stark do anything with him, let alone sex."
"Don't you have a shower to take or something?" Tony asked before heading off towards his awaiting cab.
"Like it's not entirely your fault." Steve smirks, sitting up and searching for his boxers, which were tossed to the side.
Another bark of laughter came from Tony, before he moved back to his suit and it let it form around him. "Come on Captain, suit up or we'll be late for school.
"I thought we were already?" Tony quipped, trying his best to keep it light, in that way he did any time anything teetered on uncomfortable.
"Pepper." Tony shrugged. "Obviously."
Tony's stomach twisted and his blood immediately drained downward, and the feeling of Steve's lips on his own was exactly how he remembered. The familiarity sent shock waves through his body, and sent his heart beating out of his chest. As Steve's tongue begged Tony's lips to part, to which he happily obliged, he found himself taking steps backwards, All the while dragging Steve along with him.  He wasn't sure where he was going until the back of his thighs pressed into Steve's desk.
"I need you." Steve had breathed.
"If I could go back.." Steve Started.
"Any time." And Tony almost sounded like he meant it, even offering a tight smile, before reaching for his coffee and tablet at the time time, and going back to whatever it was he was doing before Steve happened.
When he got to the farmhouse, people were buzzing about. Tony paid and thanked the cab driver, slinging Sam's jacket over his shoulder before starting towards the house. Various caterers and wait staff moved around him in the drive way, and someone else carrying the most beautiful roses Tony had seen in a long time swiftly took off towards the barn. He followed the stranger, eyes falling to people setting up chairs in the grassy area, around an arbor still needing to be decorated.
"Sam and I have to go shopping." Sharon says, though she doesn't seem pleased. Sam doesn't seem to notice and just nods in agreement.
"I do not." Tony jogged easily beside him. "Bruce is the mad scientist, I'm more of the build killer robots sort of guy, Obviously."
"Why do I tell you anything." Tony grumbled.
"Don't make promises you can't keep Romanov." Tony said with a wink, sending Clint into a fit of laughter.
Tony barked out a laugh at the question, and Steve couldn't stop the smile from finding his face too. "I am." He confirmed. "What's up?"
Steve replies with a laugh, wrapping his arms around Tony and pulling him back down on top of himself.
"Oh I don't know." Natasha calmed her breathing as she walked along the edge of the sparring mat. "Like maybe advice on how to ask him out or-" she jabbed forward, her hand barely escaping Steve's grab. "-Like how to just confess that you're madly in love with him."
"Exactly." Tony smirked, dropping the forks into the dish washer holder. "I'm super honorable these days."
"What?" Steve asks, almost forgetting entirely what it was he was doing before he got lost in Tony's mouth.
"Get over yourself." Clint huffed. "It's for the wedding, Sam lost his suit jacket, I managed to get a replacement delivered to the hotel but if I go missing Nat's gonna know something's up."
"And so, as Maid of honor, Steve, I just want to say, If he ever hurts you I will cut off his fingers one by one."  Natasha narrowed her eyes at Tony, before throwing a small smile to Steve.
Tony didn't remember much of the night, he remembers going to the bar, and that's about where it starts getting fuzzy. - Scotch! there was scotch involved. Okay, his memory was getting a little bit better. At least he was at home, in his own bed, and as far as he could tell he was alone in his own bed, that that was a plus.
Tony gave a small laugh, grabbing a towel he had slung over the top of his machine. "Okay, well, Steve, would you like to go on a date with me?"
"Goodnight Steve." Tony couldn't wait for a reply, if he did he might lose all of his nerve, so instead he shut the door, finalizing their conversation with the lock of the deadbolt, and the promise of tomorrow.
Also after the doorway reconnect he found himself wanting to see Steve again, even if it really was just to see him. Their history was one thing, but Steve had aged like a fine wine, and Tony was after all still only human.
"Just grab your phone and take this photo already."
"And there's apparently gel in his hair." Bruce chimed in.
His smile is wide, and he has his eyes tilted upwards, as if simply giddy to being kissed by Captain America. While Steve's lips are perfectly pressed up against Clint's cheek. It's perfect.
"Absolutely." Tony grinned, finding it hard to stop now that he started. "I love you, Steve."
Steve cleared his throat, as if to announce his arrival into the kitchen, and his best attempt at drawing in Tony's attention.
Steve was about to ask what when he turned the corner. "Are you serious?" He was extremely unimpressed.
"Yes, Captain?"
"Well well well." Natasha paused, mid step in front of the opening elevator doors. She placed a hand on her hip, giving Steve the once over "Where are you coming in from when it's almost light outside?"
The Photo didn't make so much of a statement as it made noise. A lot of noise. By the time he got back to the tower it had made the lunch time news.  He was notified by Bruce, in the elevator.
"Tony."  Steve spoke, lowering his voice. "I just wanted you to know about it before I posted it."
"Jesus." Steve scrubs a hand over his face, leaning back into the leather chair he's stuck in. "Okay, so say I actually do this, get a Insta-Book, thing, what was the other?"
"This is ridiculous." Pepper sighed, stepping around Steve and further into the living room, her eyes downcast onto her phone screen as her fingers danced across it, clearly trying to clean the mess Steve had made.
Pepper nodded along as she typed, her fingers moving over her keyboard graceful and fast. Tony admired the way she always held herself, like class and pride personified, with an aurora of
"Because you are." Natasha replied, standing up and tucking away her laptop. "I've been told that's part of my job, where you go I go, what you do I do. I get to be you, but just look better doing it."
The distance between them now is felt by both, but Tony can't help allowing himself to drink this moment in. Steve splayed in front of him naked and as gorgeous as ever. His ab muscles flex as he lowers himself onto his elbows, staring at Tony expectantly and invitingly.
"No, I have no reason to be at the rehearsal, I'm just a guest at the wedding, do you listen to anything Clint?" Tony turned to head back down the stairs. "I'll see you tomorrow though."
no less, when I'm right here."
"I'm sure." She replied, though she was once again typing, and Tony knew he was about to lose her again.
So dramatically, he found himself sighing again, this time louder, as he neared the work table. It wasn't his fault that Tony brought out this part of him.
Clint ignored it all and just shrugged again. "Like you are the layer of rich that donates cars to orphans or something." He moved his fork around in the air as he spoke. "So, what are orphans going to do with cars? No idea, but you had the money to do it, so you just did. That kind of rich."
Too many free scotches.
Steve, a soft sad smile on his lips nodded, taking a step back as well. "Only if you want to."
Clint was giggling, which immediately drew all attention onto him, and in turn towards the television where what he was laughing at was playing out. A reporter had cornered Sam as he was leaving the grocery store.
"Natasha." He sighed, but it nearly sounded fond. "I swear I sent it, I had Pepper right there in that chair watching me as I typed every single word, and then Happy called up to grab lunch and I-" He hesitated, and Natasha couldn't help herself as the corner of her lip twitched.
Immediately, Pepper threw her hands up in defeat. "Fine, Okay. I get it." She shot a smirk at Tony before elaborating. "I mean, I am beginning to understand the appeal."
"Yeah." Steve says with a nod. "If one more of you make a derogatory comment on any more photos of Natasha I will personally-"
"Cap't Gorgeous!" Tony excitedly slurred - the lips were not working as nicely as his legs had.
Tony gets a glimpse of his abs and he almost completely forgets what Steve just asked him. Almost. "Wait, what?" he asks back. His head is a little cloudy, but it's not that bad. "I don't have a girlfriend - Oh my God are you jealous of Pepper?"
"You should go." Tony's voice was barely a whisper, though he still didn't move.
This drew a hearty laugh from Sam beside him, and left Sharon hiding her face behind her hands, while Natasha rolled her eyes. "I swear I warned you he was annoying."
"I wanted to see what they would do if I posted one with a guy." Steve says handing the fork he pulled from the drawer to Tony, urging him to eat what he just warmed. "I wanted to insinuate that some thing else was going on, I was just standing next to Nat in the first photo, so I decided to take it up a notch with Clint."
It's moments like this, locked away in the penthouse, where privacy surrounds them that Steve feels like himself. There's no hesitation of who will catch them kissing, there's no walls left up. It's just the two of them, together, and God do they work well together. Steve isn't going to pass up an offer like that, so he blinks himself awake, and takes a moment to appreciate how soft Tony looks in the mornings.
"It's because I let you call me big red without filing a complaint with HR." Natasha pointed out, stepping to her desk and grabbing her purse and jacket from the hook. "Though I would hope after a year of working together that you would come up with something a bit more imaginative."
"I love you too, Tony."
Steve just wanted to talk, he wanted to explain and apologize, but Tony didn't need an apology, he understood, this wasn't his first rodeo, sex is good when there's no strings attached, when there's no feelings to get in the way or murky up the water. Everything is better with no feelings.
"-One year." Natasha cut in. "James got me this gold chain, like this very short, very thick bright yellow gold chain, it looked like something a drug dealer would wear."
Steve grabs his arm with some force and practically drags him around the corner and into a- "Is this a broom closet?" Tony finds himself asking, as his back bumps into a shelf and the overwhelming smell of lemon cleaner fills his nostrils.
Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom started up on the big screen and Tony folded himself into the space between Steve and the arm of the couch.
"Oh Give me some credit." Pepper said with a roll of her eyes, stepping into the elevator as it arrived. "I removed him the day you landed, just like you asked."
"That's not all I do." Rhodey defended "I also work for a living and save your ass on the regular."
Steve rolled his eyes and decided it best to ignore that. "Maybe I should just start by avoiding women all together."
Tony who was absolutely infatuated with him.
Tony spent most of his afternoon sleeping off the hangover headache that returned almost immediately after he got back to the hotel. When he woke up he had a few update texts from Pepper in regards to the roses, that of course she had no problem arranging and would be flown in over night, and delivered to the farm before breakfast.
"We shouldn't have done that" Tony whispers, collapsing down, run dry in every sense of the word.
"Go to bed Pepper, you have a company to run." Tony sighed into the phone. "Thanks for trying to help.'
Natasha didn't hesitate, grabbing the bag and opening it. "Is this Beluga Vodka?" she asked, pulling the clear bottle up. "You can only buy this in Russia Tony. How did you?"
'A geniuses work is never done...' reads the caption.
"I posted that photo and every comment was about us, dating, or being together or how hot we were together." Steve pulled the plate out of the microwave, and placed it down on the counter before moving towards the drawer with the cutlery in it.
Steve pushed himself away from the work bench, grabbing his laptop as he moved, knowing it was time to head back to his room, to accomplish his work, not because he was actually beginning to enjoy talking to Tony. "Thank you, again."
It was a busy day all around, which is why when he knocked on the front door and no one answered, he didn't take offence, instead he just tried the knob. Of course unlocked because small town farm people never locked their doors, it was now a proven fact. The inside of the house was just as busy, people were clattering around the kitchen, caterers, Tony felt safe to assume, popping in and out the patio doors, Tony able to catch quick glimpses of them as they worked.
"The barn is basically ready to go for tomorrow." Steve says, transferring more bacon before jumping to the eggs that Bucky had nearly forgotten about while worrying about toast. "I have the arbor being delivered for three, so it will be ready to go for the rehearsal."
blue eyes. Tony knew he was blushing now, he had really fucked up and there was no saving himself from it.
"-I'll make you dinner tonight if you go away before Pepper comes up here to get you." Steve levels.
"Iron Man?" Steve asked into his ear, not having to explain what he was asking.
"Stop." Steve laughs. "I think the regular name is fine, please and thank you."
She lets out a huff as she folds herself into the empty chair next to Tony. "Being polite to these people is so hard, my face is starting to hurt from all the fake smiling."
"Oh, goodie." She teased, grabbing a bottle of water from the fridge before heading off to the elevator.
“Who is it?”
"Hmm." Steve did Tony the courtesy of looking down at his own treadmill screen. "What is it that's keeping the genius awake then?"
"Hmm." Steve agrees, though he doesn't bother to look out Tony's windows, instead choosing to shuffle back, just enough to feel himself press back into Tony.
Steve doesn't confirm anything, and he doesn't need to. Instead they make their way up the stairs, through the hall and directly into Steve's bedroom once again. Tony closes the door behind himself, and neither of them need to turn the light on. The moon is bright enough, and they both know it, and from there, Tony can hear the music from the barn through the open second story window, but just as a dull buzz.
"Wow." Tony's eyebrows raised into his hairline, because, no of course Steve wouldn't have told anyone about him, why would he He was
How Steve did not see this was baffling, seriously. How he could be so oblivious, when literally everyone else around him was telling him how it was, was beyond him. Every time someone cornered them, it was always Steve making the excuses, and Tony agreeing. It was always Tony protecting Steve. But the soft touches, stolen glances and quick kisses. Those were real, they meant something. The now familiar twist in his stomach came again and Steve knew what he had to do.
Tony's face broke into a wild smile before slamming his hands down on his table. "That's it!" he began mumbling again, twisting screens around himself and flipping through old blueprints. "I love you Rogers, you're a genius."
- it was just a night in with his friends,-
"And it's white flour which is not healthy." Bucky said with a roll of his eyes, passing the bread to Natasha.
Pepper is the first one to notice them, her glare softens as her eyes fall to the clasped hands, and cautiously, Steve thinks he may have dodged the wrath of Pepper Potts once again.
Steve, though, holds the phone steady, dragging a hand down his face before he's laughing along. "She's the one that wanted me to let the public see the real me." He grins into the camera and quickly adds. "She brought this on herself."
If there's one thing Tony has learned about Natasha, it's that she does what she pleases, and people just deal with it. So when she pulls a old black and gold photo album from Steve's bookshelf, she ignores his plea to put it back, and no one else really tries to stop her.
"Fine." Tony turned to the coffee machine, grabbing a mug from the cupboard above it. "You know, the usual headache, nausea, general feeling of warmed over death." He poured the liquid to the very top of the mug, before lifting it up to his mouth letting out the most satisfied hum he could. "Strangest thing though." He took a long sip, letting the bitterness fill his mouth and calm his soul, before turning around to finally face both of the people in the kitchen with him. "I don't remember much of anything from last night, I don't even know how I got home."
"You know for a smart guy, you're pretty dumb" Clint yelled back just as Tony managed to close the door of the cab.
"Yeah, just ask Steve-" Natasha blurted, before she quickly slapped a hand over her mouth. "Oh my god." She mumbled from behind her hand. "Too much wine."
"Okay, that's fair." Tony pushed away from the table, waiting for her at the door of the boardroom before continuing, glancing down at some of the missed texts he had received. "It's just, Steve's here today, and I am a ball of anxiety."
Didn't matter that ten years had passed, Tony felt twenty again. Foolish and naive, just a kid who couldn't distinguish love from lust. If he had, he wouldn't have fallen for someone like Steve Rogers.
"There's no better way to celebrate a successful battle." Thor says almost with glee as he steps away. "It's a tradition on many planets in the realms to do so."
The line is silent, and then there's a sigh. "
"We should have buried him when we had the chance." Steve said with a roll of his eyes, Tony couldn't have agreed more.
"That was one time." Steve reasoned, but let his arms wrap around Tony, and his now charcoal stained shirt. "You're going to be out of shirts if I keep this up."
"Steve." Tony says, though he's trying hard not to smile from behind his can. "You are going to need to elaborate here, you called him the dream."
"Like Tony." Steve does cut in, because that's all Tony's ever done. He's lived as his true self in the public eye for as long as he had been alive. There wasn't a lot the public didn't know about him, not a lot Tony wouldn't tell the world just because he could.
"I'm sorry-" he could hear Tony's voice but it sounded so far away.
Tony's eyes met Steve's "Yup." He spoke agreeing with no one but himself. "This was the best decision I've made my whole life."
Tony glanced at the digital clock on the bed side table, it was barely going on to midnight. The night before had obviously taken it's toll on them, pathetic, Tony thought to himself, as if he hadn't been fast asleep five minutes ago as well.
Steve could feel his heart in his throat. "I love you too."
This one makes the news - well, the entertainment news - when a blonde reporter comments how adorable it is that Steve and Thor are such close teammates. It only makes Steve's blood boil a little.
"Guess he had a fun at what's-her-faces boyfriends party." Natasha pushed herself away from the counter. "I'm going to get some sleep Cap, try not to stay up too much longer worrying about Tony."
So many of visual comments were about how they made a cute couple. Steve would pretend that didn't bother him. Because it didn't, He knew better. He did, he
Tony followed the man to the kitchen, unable to help himself as he took in his surroundings. The entire house was simply decorated, clean, but almost devoid of all personal touches. Nothing like how he had pictured Steve living, especially not after living with him. But people change, he thought, God knows he had.
"You put effort into your look." Clint narrowed his eyes, trying to put the story together. "Just to have a movie night with us?"
"Are you mad at me?"
was not - when he decided it was probably best to give up on the whole sleep thing. It wasn't going to happen. So, he did what he normally did on sleepless nights, dressed for a workout, grabbed his water bottle and headed straight down for the gym.
"Pepper's got a new boyfriend?" This time Steve did look up, just in time to see Tony's very unimpressed look.
The second time they have sex, Steve promises it's the last time. He swears it in fact.
Sam groaned as he tossed his hand of cards down onto the coffee table in front of himself. "I fold."
"Well yeah that's because you're past rich." Clint reasoned, around a mouth full of food. "Like there’s snooty white rich people, those are the ones that eat cauliflower pasta, and then a few layers of rich up there's people like you." Clint shrugged like it was that obvious.
Steve captioned it
"I'm sorry." Steve wasn't sure what part of it he was apologizing for, but it didn't seem to matter to Tony.
"Speak for yourself." Sam protested, only to get an elbow from Sharon beside him.
Pepper lets out a very long sigh before looking at Natasha. "I need a drink."
"Oh, Okay." Tony smirks, twisting in his chair to face Steve. "So you're telling me that you plan to go back and tell both of them No." he raises an eyebrow, and it takes everything in Steve not to glare.
"I didn't either." Steve replied, before he placed his phone on the table and slid it across towards Tony. "But apparently Natasha is refusing to get that memo."
"Can we please be serious here for a second?" Steve said, holding back the eye roll he so badly wanted to do. As if his day couldn't get worse, there was a chance this was going to send it right off the edge.
It took Tony a second, but his shoulders dropped, as if releasing preventative tension, and then he held out his palm. "Let me see."
"I won't." Steve called after her as she walked away. He wouldn't be worrying about Tony, not tonight, but he might be
Tony groaned, the bright lights hurting his face as he shuffled to the coffee machine. "I don't know what you heard but I assure you it was all lies."
Steve's breath is already heavy, but when Tony tugs on his hair, so that their lips can meet again and climbs into his lap, it hitches and sends shivers down Tony's spine. Tony grinds down slowly drawing the most beautiful sounds from Steve's mouth pressed against his own. He does it once more just for good measure before he reaches down between their bodies, and his fingers get to work on Steve's pants.
He was still in his work clothes, only his jacket and tie had been discarded somewhere. His shirt had the top few buttons open, and now had grease marks over the once white fabric, like he had run directly down there as soon as Pepper allowed him to.
Tony turns his head towards the door just as it creeps open, Natasha's head peeking through first. Her green eyes travel from the bed to Steve in the chair and then she's stepping through the door. "Told you." She says to Bucky, who follows her into the room.
"You brought Sam's jacket." It was a statement, not a question as Steve eyed the jacket dangling from Tony's fingers before taking it. "Right, yeah Thank you. Clint mentioned someone would bring it by."
"So?" The taller man replied, a smirk on his lips. "Maybe you should just take one more day off."
people crudely called it, Steve had been doing his best to try and figure out the new world himself. Not to toot his own horn or anything, but he had been doing a pretty good job of it. There had been a lot of books to read, and the tech people at shield headquarters had taught him the basics. The internet, search engines, how to use Email, and the general idea of a cellular phone. A lot of it, they told him, would come to him from just daily exposure, and Steve believed them.
Steve smiled down at the top of Tony's head, he had to give it to him, drunk or not he was damn cute. "No you don't." He resisted the urge to run his fingers through the brunettes hair, it still smelled of shampoo, and looked soft and fluffy, and so touchable.
It's not until later, once Tony gets out of the shower and wraps a towel around his waist that he actually takes a moment to think about what they just did. He wipes the steam from his bathroom mirror and takes in his own reflection. His lips are still a bit swollen and his shoulder is dressed in tiny bruises, but the big bruises are around his hips, as if Steve left his fingerprints behind.
"Yeah- I'm seeing this." Iron Man hovered himself a few blocks away from the drone, letting J.A.R.V.I.S. run a scan of the device and its weapon system, information lighting up his HUD -"Keep your distance looks like it's armed with mini-guns and -fuck-"
"I'm Sorry." Tony managed sincerely, glancing at the people standing around her, Clint from earlier, and someone he had not yet met. "I really didn't mean to upset you, I just needed to get some air."
“I did,” says the Soldier.
“Fri, could you—?” he asks, because he was always going to answer it, and it would be stupid pretending otherwise. It’s been a long time since his anger was enough to ignore it, and his hatred was never enough. Because she’s perfect, Friday reroutes the call immediately, plays it over her own speakers. The rush of gratitude he feels for her is almost painfully strong; she’s still here, and she won’t leave. Some things are too deeply rooted in the Tower, in
Steve was the first to pull back, to remember what they’d decided. What they’d promised, more like.
“I, uh…” Tony said slowly, and it sounded like he was leaning away from the phone for a second. From the sounds on the other end, he might’ve been in his workshop in the tower, or else Pym’s lab. Steve hoped it wasn’t the latter; Tony had been electrocuted there one too many times for his taste. “Well, I’m pretty busy today, but sure, why not, let’s do lunch. I’ll get out of here for an hour or so. Club A? I just updated the robots and now they can make a pretty mean sandwich.”
Then, suddenly, it wasn’t so unbelievable that a figment of Steve’s imagination might be real, because there was an honest-to-goodness
“Oh God,” Tony groaned. He sucked in air. “Oh, yes,
He thinks of Gawain, again. He thinks, for the first time, that maybe his imprisonement is the scratch to save him from beheading, that
—this was a bad idea. I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have come here.”
No one, except Steve. It’s too much. It’s foolish, and romantic, and far, far too much to ask.
A few seconds of puzzling later, the furrow and the fantasy disappeared together as the man tipped his head in a clear
at the prospect of death; that’s all Tony needs to know. He fires.
With a few skillful strokes and even more skillful kisses, Tony coaxed Steve back to full hardness inside the condom, which was odd but not unpleasant. He added a little more lube and began positioning himself carefully over Steve’s cock.
liked giving it. Especially to Tony.
With that Steve’s body started moving, achingly slow but irrepressible, as gentle as he could manage. He did his best to hit all the soft, tender places he had found with his fingers, drawing soft, breathless sounds out of Tony’s trusting body. It was heaven, it was agonizingly good, and Steve didn’t even care that his knees were aching. Tony whined and circled his hips greedily as they started to rock into one another in rhythm.
Steve took one last glance to straighten his jacket and then left the bathroom. He could do this. He was Captain America, and he wasn’t even half wolf anymore. He could do anything. Including maybe, possibly, work up the courage to ask Tony Stark on a date. Tony was just a friend, but if Steve could like Tony more than that,
When he found whatever he was looking for, the tension relaxed and the bitter lewdness washed out of Tony’s face like it had never been. His spine and the corners of his eyes loosened, a natural shift back toward Steve’s body beside him. He relinquished his glass and twisted his wrist under Steve’s until their palms pressed together, warm and secure.
Steve thanks T’Challa for everything, puts the disguise on, and leaves. It’s time to see a little more of the world, he thinks.
"He’s not floating anymore,” Tony said. “We finally get rid of the tentacle monster, and hey, there’s another guy to take his place.” The words were lighthearted, but Tony’s voice was anything but; he sounded solemn, and verging on
, all right, if that’s not too forward.”

“You can do this,” Steve said to Tony, smiling. “I believe in you.”
“And that’s okay, Tony, that’s part of
“And I know it’s my fault,” he continued, “and I shouldn’t’ve—“
Steve didn’t know what to say. There was an inane revelation about the source of the gravel in Tony’s abrasion on the tip of his tongue, but he held it back, knowing it wouldn’t help anything. Instead he just moved up to sit beside Tony again and dabbed the antibiotic cream onto the raw skin and pressed the rectangle of gauze over it, putting gentle pressure on it to convince the broken skin to clot. After a minute, he taped the gauze in place and took his hand off, reluctantly, because he didn’t think his hand on Tony’s face would be much of a comfort to anyone but himself in this situation.
, because Tony was there too. The touch of his mind was new and different, but he was
on his behalf that it finally, finally tips the uneasy scale toward
in red and gold that Steve could easily recognize as Tony’s best work, his most careful. Leave it to Tony Stark to build an armor for a creature that Steve had believed mythical until about eight seconds ago. He had to believe in it now, though, because it was standing right there, plain as day, with a brightness about it that made it look not quite physical, but no less real.
“So you’re helping Strange?” Steve said, trying for Tony’s sake to keep up the pretense that this was normal.
It would be so much easier to hate him that way.
Steve brings the shield down one last time, and Tony feels a crushing, cutting pain. His heart seizes behind his ribs.
For a long moment, Steve and Tony just looked at each other across the threshold of Steve’s dorm room like it was an interminable gulf and not just a few feet of space. Then Tony sighed, and the sound was so weary, so wrong coming from Tony who was always full energy, that Steve gave in instantly.
“But it
. Steve dropped the smile altogether and started from scratch, trying to get his expression to look right, trying not to admit that his flat, hairless face felt sort of out of place after a month with a furry snout. It shouldn’t be that hard, right? Tony always had a nice smile, always the right mixture of wicked and charming and just a little arrogant, just enough to distract from the vulnerability in his eyes. Steve—well, Steve could never manage a smile like
“side.” They agree that the UN has been minimally helpful at best, and that Steve and the other Avengers ought to have been left free to operate at their own discretion.
to be true. The warmth inside of him grew.
“I…“ Tony began, but the rest of the sentence seemed to get lost on the way to his mouth. Steve was abruptly aware of how vulnerable he looked there, bare of armor except for his right gauntlet and with the arc reactor shining clearly through his thin black t-shirt.
Things get worse, and Tony adds more and more safeguards to the pod.

The partial match that Ross found was
Tony’s eyes flicked downwards. “There’s not a thing wrong with what you’ve got,” he objected. “You’re perfectly proportioned.”
“A year ago, I would’ve been shocked that Captain America dances at all, but you and Sam both spend like eight hours on the dance floor at a time, so maybe it is a Cap thing,” Tony said finally, with a little crooked smile. His expression was unreadable, but at least it didn’t look displeased, Steve thought.
When he got to the Mansion, Steve hit upon the slight flaw in his plan: he wasn’t Tony. He had no intrinsic magical connection, artificial or otherwise, and he had very little faith in his ability to replicate the whistling call Tony had made, not knowing what it meant—since there was clearly a great deal of meaning encoded in the sound. So Steve decided to stick to the basics, and hope for the best.
Tony digs into the sightings reports, pulling information together and trying to weave it into a coherent story, trying to follow the threads back to their sources. This is what Ross wants of him, and so this is what he must do. This is what he does.

The waitress’ surprise sets off something of a chain reaction. Suddenly, whenever Steve mentions Tony in public, somebody’s saying how long it’s been since they’ve seen him. He shows up for press conferences, everyone knows that, but here, right within a few blocks of Tony’s home, where he used to wander and poke his head into the shops because he knew the owners, no one has seen Tony.
in every sense—was a little intimidating, but Steve refused to be daunted, and in the end impatience beat insecurity. The sooner Steve finished with his own pants, the sooner he could get a look at what was under Tony’s.
“I had a really good time,” Steve told him sincerely. It was an understatement, really; he’d just spent over an hour with Tony pressed against his back as the salt air rushed past them, and he’d probably be taking a long, long shower in a few minutes.
with Steve, long afternoons at the dining table and post-mission adrenaline crashes on the couch and the way they used to snipe at each other while they fought side by side. Steve has changed, too. He can hear it. The righteous anger is still there, sometimes, but the stubbornness is softer, tempered with something almost like wisdom. It makes him gentle in a way he could never quite be before.
"Sure it’s not,” Tony drawled, uneven smile still firmly in place. He shifted and spun around on his barstool, pushing his empty plate toward the robot bussing the bar in the same motion, and a little shiver of anticipation went down Steve’s spine.
to the person he cared about most—
Then, in the middle of the night, Tony showed up at Steve’s door. His knock was hesitant and quiet, but it was enough to wake Steve from his light, restless sleep. As Steve opened the door, confusion over who would show up at his door at this time of night was quickly replaced with a different sort of feeling—still confused, but also sort of elated that Tony had been the one to seek him out first. He thought he would’ve felt like he was forcing his friendship on Tony if he’d had to go to Tony first, after what happened. Under normal circumstances, he’d invite Tony in to talk about whatever it was he’d come for, or he’d go out with Tony to talk in the hall or one of the study rooms, but things felt different now, and Steve wasn’t sure what to do or say.

“I think I’m ready to keep fighting,” Tony said.

Steve’s letting himself think of Tony, now, and he almost wishes he weren’t. Charles Spencer, that was the name he had given the Avengers at that useless, aborted discussion. How had Tony known that name in particular? How would he have even found out about an American kid doing service work in Sokovia? Two options come to mind, and Steve isn’t sure which is more horrible.
“Stop blaming yourself, I’ve

, much less romance. Whatever he had to do to assure Tony of that would be worth it. “You’re my best friend, too, you know. I’m sorry for what happened, and I really want you to be able to be… comfortable with me, I guess. Anything you need, anything you
He has to protect the people that he put in harm’s way.
It reassures him more than he wants to admit.
“I know. I still want to.” He went down easily enough, but his body was tense. Steve would have to loosen him up in more ways than one. Luckily, he’d had more than his share of tight and aching muscles over the years, and he’d gotten pretty good at working the knots out of them, making them go loose. Steve took his time, just as Tony had first wanted, working his way methodically down Tony’s body. It didn’t’ take long at all for Tony to let go of his nervousness and give himself completely over to Steve’s hands.
Once in a while Misty was willing to indulge Steve and talk about Tony, or rather his crush on Tony—which was nice, because it turned out she was one of the few who had never bought into Tony’s narcissist genius act—but mostly she wasn’t, and that was even better.
“I want to.”
He knew he couldn’t.
was the worst possible word for what they’d had together, and Steve felt it stick in his throat even as he said it. Tony looked hurt, young and surprised and hurt, and maybe he didn’t just want more sex. Maybe he’d wanted to finish that sentence after all. Maybe, however unlikely, he had hoped to see Steve again, too.
and I felt like… It felt like it would’ve been… unfaithful. Even if I had no idea whether you wanted me back.”
. Maybe, if he lets it hurt just a little more this time, it'll work like it's supposed to. He'll be able to break out of this excruciating cycle and heal.
And it got easier. They knew the rules, they practiced, and after a while they didn’t have to think about it nearly so much. Tony took Steve for a long flight over the water, just after the sun went down, and they both watched the stars coming out and glittering on the waves below and tried to pick out constellations for hours. When the night air started to cool off, Tony retracted his helmet and they kissed until the heavens around them were inside, too, perfection in its finished state, not waiting on anything more. And then, Steve drew back and just breathed into the chilly metal of Tony’s pauldron, and Tony flew him home and gave him a peck of a kiss goodnight.
, and had asked him
There was another endless moment of silence, and then Tony darted forwards, throwing his arms around Steve. The hug was as fierce as it was brief, Tony gripping tightly at Steve’s middle and burying his face in his shoulder almost desperately, drawing back before Steve could get his own arms up to reciprocate.
. They
But he still thinks it is.
But of course, it didn’t really matter what Steve thought in that moment. It didn’t really matter what any of them felt, because they were heroes through and through, and they knew better than to allow their personal issues to come between them and the needs of a bereaved universe. They would fight together, and they would do it well, because no other choice existed. Not for them.
“I’m sorry,” Steve said again. “I won’t…” He didn’t know how to finish the sentence. There probably wasn’t a right way to smooth this over, a way to put it behind them so that they could still be friends as they had before. Had he ruined everything, opening a door that had been better off shut?
“Jarvis’ll let you know,” Tony said. A few lines of blue hologram flashed red inside the chassis, and Steve nodded acknowledgement. He leaned up to reach them, but to his surprise, Tony didn’t move out of the way, and his motion brought the two of them within inches of each other. The heat of Tony’s body was
“Feelings,” Tony repeated dumbly. There was something like cautious awe in his voice. “Romantic feelings?”
The stranger’s dark eyebrows went up.
His box is breaking open.
. All of him, so he could have this impossible swelling warm feeling any time he wanted.
A glass of water slid across the rich dark wood of the counter a few seconds later, and Steve dredged up a real—
him, but until such time as it actually occurred, Steve decided that he would continue to carry on as though it had not. Obstinacy, if nothing else, was enough to keep him from giving up hope completely.
"Enough," Tony says, and he mutes her. He makes himself remember what had worked and what hadn’t, the first time he’d used this technology. He hadn’t been able to change Howard very much, not without compromising the results of the attempt. When he tried, the scenario became more pleasant, undoubtedly, but it also felt wrong, incongruous. It didn’t take.
“But you knew it was
If he dies, they’ll need somewhere to keep what’s left of him. Somewhere safe. It’s not even ego or vanity; his body and brain are unique, and even dead there’s so much that a structure like his could be used for. So much evil that could be done with it, in the wrong hands.
“I… I had a nice time,” Tony said quietly. Firmly. “I like
He fights the Winter Soldier with everything he has in him, and Steve too when he gets in the way. There’s too much in his head to understand, grief and betrayal and revenge, and trying to direct all that emotion feels risky, like trying to fly a nuclear bomb all over again. Friday has overridden the mute and is shouting warnings, but Tony doesn’t listen, fighting like a feral thing.
Well, that would explain it. Of course he would talk like that, if he thought
That last, a hologram might come to understand. Tony puts his head in his hands, and he knows how cruel he is.
“Hey, I know just how great I am!” Tony protested, tilting his jaw up in a comically arrogant move. He probably didn’t realize just how clearly defensive it was to someone who knew him well. Steve just smiled a little more, wishing he knew whether he was allowed to touch Tony, to put a hand on his shoulder to steady him, to make him feel Steve’s confidence in him.
“Tony?” asked Steve, sitting up straighter. He wondered if this might be more complicated than Tony had expected from his evening. “Is something wrong?”
honest, once in a while.
Tony panics, and he slips.
, his tone said.
“There’s nothing wrong with that, Tony,” Steve said, finally getting over himself and putting a hand on Tony’s shoulder blade. If it weren’t okay, Tony would tell him. “Not a thing.”
At that, Tony’s smile vanished altogether, and he dropped his eyes finally away from Steve’s. Nanocircuitry formed and receded almost silently along his collar, an instinctive self-defense.
“Friday?” he called. “Fri-day!”
After a minute, one of Tony’s repulsor blasts tossed the monster back, head over heels—though Steve couldn’t be sure that the monster had either of those—and Tony stood over it with satisfaction on his face. It wasn't the overwrought look of brazen smugness that he put on for strangers, but rather the honest expression of effort and accomplishment he only got when he’d really worked for something. It looked good.
“You were about as relaxed as a cat in a bath.”
There's nothing anyone can do for Tony Stark's heart anymore.
The stranger was looking back.
“Really? You’re
Well, one nice thing about the Iron Man was that he allowed Steve to be both intriguing
“Well, I think we could manage that,” Steve said, smiling at Friday.
Steve’s eyes sting, and he’s not even sure if this little girl’s drawing is making him feel better or worse.
“Of course,” Steve replies, and there’s a smile in the turn of his voice.
“You know why.”
ready to go home yet,” Tony said, putting on a grin and playing back. The seductive tone was a little less steady than it had been before, but no less effective for being more honest. Tony looked like he was having fun, this time, and it was a good look on him. “Got any other ideas?”
“There’s not a lot of room to maneuver in there; think you could pry a few wires loose for me?” Tony said hopefully, though he sounded more tentative than Steve thought he probably should for a request like that. It wasn’t like Steve hadn’t lent him a little super-strength in the workshop before.
Steve sits and looks at the image of Iron Man fighting back his
But then his eye falls on the screen, still plainly showing the Winter Soldier’s bare hand choking the life out of Maria Stark, and Tony just can’t hold back anymore. The Soldier killed his mom.
