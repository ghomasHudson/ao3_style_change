“My-”  Tony’s stomach dropped, a sickening twist of nausea.  Jan tried to smile, but it died, half formed on her lips.  Tony shoved a hand through his hair.  “Jan.  Everything hinges on that-”
But he was nearly back to the theater, moving at a quick pace already, when the familiar sound reached him, followed by the sound of screams.  And he’d known, in an instant, that he’d made a mistake.  He’d made a mistake in leaving Tony and DJ to bring the other boys to the trolley.  He’d made a mistake in letting them come to the movie to begin with.
Laughing, Tony wrapped an arm around Pepper's waist, lifting her up and off the floor.  “A slow tune might not be the worst thing,” he pointed out, just as the door to the workshop opened.
May’s arms went around his waist, and Tony froze in place.  Her grip was surprisingly strong, despite her thin frame.  He took a breath, and it hurt, it hurt in a way he couldn’t define.  His breath hissed between his teeth. “I believe I’ve mentioned that I don’t really want-”  He stopped, trying not to lean into her.  “This sort of thing.”
Hank straightened up, shoving his shock of blonde hair out of his eyes with one hand.  “You don’t know that.”
"Eighteen, actually."  Tony made a vain attempt to fend him off, his hands fluttering in the air in Steve's general direction.  "Get off, I can do it."
Logan reached up, wrapped an hand around the back of Steve’s neck, and kissed him full on the lips.  Then he let go and kept walking, tossing a fried shrimp into the air and catching it in his mouth.
“I do not have a type,” Tony said, his hands braced on his hips.  “What's my type?”
“Mmmm.”  Tony reached for his tea cup.  “I’m useful.”
Tony nodded.  “Right,” he said.  He took a breath, and his ribs ached.  He let his eyes fall shut.  “I can’t-”  His throat closed around the words.
“It was heavily implied,” she said.
Steve pushed himself to his feet, dusting his hands against his thighs.  “There’s a river not far from here,” he said, and he was pretty sure he believed it.  “Give me the flasks, I’ll fill them.”
He looked up, and found a familiar face grinning down at him. Tony was seated on a small balcony just above Steve’s head, one foot braced on a mass of fabric below him.  His sleeves were rolled up to his elbows, and his vest was hanging open over his white shirt.  His head tipped to the side, dark hair flopping over his forehead.  “Well?” he asked, one hand swinging idly back and forth, a wrench tapping against the railing like the clapper of a bell.  Steve blinked at him, and Tony’s eyebrows arched, his eyes dancing. “The time, my good sir?”
Tony nodded.  "Stand up."
Exactly at eight, washed, dried and dressed, Tony walked into the shared living room, Steve right behind him.  “We’re eating breakfast before presents,” he announced.
Steve’s pulse spiked.  “Dammit, Deej, get back in here.”
"I've got it," Rogers said, his voice right next to Tony's ear.  His fingers slid under Tony's hand, nudging him out of the way.  "What are you trying to do?"
"Nothing good comes out of those three words." She shot him a look from under the brim of her clever little hat, but there was a smile playing around the corners of her mouth.
Morse started to laugh.  “Look at that.  He’s got a sense of humor,” she drawled, doffing her cap with a half bow.  Her blonde hair tumbled down her back, and she tossed the cap towards one of the workbenches.  “And here I thought that cops had that surgically removed when they took the badge.”
Her voice trailed away, and Steve gave her a reassuring smile.  “Thanks for coming, I know it's not a convenient time, but-”
"Jarvis makes the best toast," Tony told DJ.  “It's the cinnamon butter.”
“Telling Abby that you've drawn naked pictures of me and you're not sharing,” Sam said, and Steve lunged for his phone.  Laughing, Sam twisted around, keeping it out of reach with a force of will.  “No!  The truth will be known, Rogers!”
“You used chopsticks in the field?” Tony asked, and Steve shrugged.
“That's because it is a really stupid plan, and I think I tried to warn you, in as delicate a way as I could manage, that it was a really stupid plan that was never, ever going to work.” Jan's shoulders slumped. “Steve. This was never going to work. You can't just-”
“Kinky,” Tony said, his voice bright, and Steve choked on his coffee.
“Yes, I have.”  She looked at him, red hair curling against her cheek.  “I’ve read your file, and it is not the history of a cowardly man.”
His gaze wandered towards the hearth, and he stared at the flames.  “Phillips was many things, but a fool was not one of them.  He had heirs already.”  Nicholas frowned.  “At the time, it was, what?  His brother, his brother’s three children, an uncle?  And he had a cousin as well, maybe two?”
Tony bit back a curse, shoving the box under the remains of the workbench.  “Coming!” he called, scrambling back to his feet.  The door to the workshop opened, the hinges protesting the small movement.  “I’m-”
DJ nodded.  “How.”
Tony’s eyebrows arched.  “Do you like it?” he asked, taking another sip of his wine.  “Thor’s people helped me build it.  They’re…  A bit ahead of us, in terms of technology.”  He leaned back in his chair, crossing his legs.  “And they’re not the only ones.  I tend not to bring up our other friends, but then again, that little trinket that you’re carrying makes me think that it’s a secret you might already know.”
She huffed out a breath, her shoulders slumping.  “I'm almost certain that's not true, but thank you.”
“What?”  Steve looked up.  “Oh.  Yes.”  He cleared his throat, once, and then again, before he forced the next words out.  “The Friends of the Brooklyn Public Library,” he read, “would like to thank you for your gift of a year long membership to the Brooklyn Children’s Museum.  This membership will be available to borrow on a rotating basis to anyone with a valid New York Library Card, and will be listed in the catalog as the James B. Barnes Memorial Membership.”
“More like it’s already worked,” Carol said, standing up.  “I’m getting the real menu file, the one with Golden House and Sal’s Real New York Pizzeria in it.”
Sam nodded.  “That’s an honest answer,” he said, his hand dropping.  “And kind of a cop-out. Do we have a plan to uncomplicate things?”
For a minute, Steve thought the kid would balk.  But pride was hard to maintain on an empty stomach, and the lure of a hot meal won out.  Cautiously, carefully, he lowered himself onto a stool, and took the fork that Clint pushed across the counter to him.  Clint picked up another bowl from the stack.  Without asking, he filled it, and handed it to Steve.  “Keep him company,” he said, and Steve nodded, taking a seat at the counter.
Tony scooped up a second page, and a third, scanning the comments.  “None of this-” He scowled down at it.  “Did Prof Adams start questioning you about-”
Everyone stood there, staring at her, and she clapped her hands.  “It’s late, and I’m quite tired, and you’re keeping me from my bed.”
“Man needs to sleep,” Tony said.  He rolled to his feet.
"Not my fault that a lot of things in this world apparently have to be very, very hard," Tony said.  "Like this entire trip.  And goddamn Victor Von Dumbass and his goddamn-"
Steve smiled, and it didn’t hurt the way he’d expected it to.  “I’m always paying attention.”
As if the very ordinary concrete beneath his feet should be familiar.
“Kind of am,” Benito admitted.  He pointed at Darcy.  “Get out of my kitchen.”
“Aren't we lucky?” Al asked, hugging his teapot.
“If you can't keep up, take a seat and let a more talented dancer have the floor,” Rhodey shot back.  He executed a beautiful step, spinning in place as DJ spread his arms out like wings.  “And if you can get him to put a Louis Armstrong album on, all the more power to you.”
“DJ has it,” Jarvis said.
“We're trying to ignore that,” Clint told him.
Steve hung up on him, which was rude, but Sam would count it as a win.  He glanced over towards the passenger seat, where Tony had gone still and quiet, his head tucked down into the bulk of his coat.  Steve could hear him breathing, the sound slow and raspy.  He reached over, his fingers ghosting over Tony's hair.  “Hey, we're going to go back to my place.  Okay?”
Tony took a deep breath, and let it out slowly.  “Dummy convinced you not to,” he repeated.
“You have a fiance, and you’d murder me in under a month,” Tony told her.  He was fairly certain Jarvis was laughing as he left the room.  Tony took a seat at the workbench, his arms crossed over his chest.  “I’m not marrying you simply to annoy Obie.”
“Good work,” Bruce said, but he just kept scrubbing his station.
DJ rocked forward, his fingers tugging at the fabric of his pajama pants.  “The second one, didn’t need it, as much.  But the first one.”  He looked up, then down again.  “Don’t think they would’ve made the goal without me.  Might still have finished.”
Steve couldn’t think about it.  Wouldn’t allow himself to even listen.  “You love him.”  He was sure of that, somehow, and it was easier to say than anything else that was racing through his head.
Once on the elevator, he slumped against the wall.  He fumbled the bag with the scone into the curve of his elbow, and let his eyes fall shut.  “Jarvis?”
“Right.” Tony took a seat on a stool, his elbows braced on the workbench.  “Well, I talk too much, but sometimes, they don't come out right for me, either.”  He reached for his coffee cup.  It was empty, and he frowned down at it.  “Reading's easier?”
“Light bulbs are boring,” DJ muttered, and Harris choked on a laugh.
“Everyone got fired again, huh?” Bobbi asked with a grin.
“I don't even know where you got most of these.”  Ellen peeked out from between her fingers, to find Jesse peering at the wild, unmatched collage of pictures that stretched along the length of her living room wall.  Jesse reached out, tapping one with a blunt fingernail.  “Man, is this from the Battle of New York?”
Stane glared up at her, one hand holding his throat.  “Dead,” he said, his voice vicious, and Tony’s stomach turned over again, a dry heave shaking his frame.  Stane looked at Tony, venom twisting his face.  “Hammer’s easily bought and paid for.”  He let out a bark of laughter.  “Down in the slums, life’s cheap, you know.  I gave him a few hundred dollars and a gun and he handled that particular problem.”
The boy ducked away from him, moving back and behind Pepper, his hand reaching up to grab hers.  She took it.  "This is Mr. Stane," she said, a polished smile on her face.  The boy looked up at her, and she gave him a reassuring smile.  "Don't worry.  He doesn't live here."
“I shouldn’t have to,” Ty said.  He picked up a random piece of machinery, glaring at it.  “Is this mine?”
“You are a man of even temperment and a forgiving nature,” Steve agreed.
"We are not putting pins in his jacket," Stark said, his voice stern.  "It's close enough, and Jarvis has dinner for eight to-"
“Yes?” Tony said, and he was confused. Steve could see it on his face. He was honestly and truly confused.  Pepper, meanwhile, was hiding a smile behind one hand.  DJ was watching them both, his eyes darting between them.
“Yes.”
Tony gave the tiny loaves a suspicious look.  “Are they poisoned?”
Laughing, Tony slipped past him.  “Yes.  Yes, they are.”
"You're very loud," he said, with his usual precision.
The sound of shattering glass echoed down the empty street, and Tony swept low, under a fire escape dotted with potted plants, coming close enough to a window that the curtains were sucked out in his wake.  It was New York.  Things were close.  Tight.  Even this high, there wasn't much space to maneuver, there wasn't much of a margin for error.
Stark looked at the Stranges, but Rogers was already sliding out of the pew.  “It’s past time, actually,” Stark said, falling into step behind him.  “But we leave together, or we don’t leave at all.”
“Yes,” DJ said, with a firm nod.
He paused.  “Who does that, ya know?  Who pays that much money to get a dusty, ugly vase from a top shelf in a room no one seemed to go into?  I figured it was perfect.  Might be days, or even weeks, before anyone even noticed it was gone.  If we were careful, if no one saw us?”  He tossed the pepper mill in a high, controlled arc, sending it flipping end over end through the air before he snagged it with one hand.  “Easy money.”
“B-” Steve did his best not to draw the letter out, and failed miserably.  “Brown.”  That was a good guess, just by averages, that was the best guess he could manage.
“As parting shots go, that was not your best work,” Steve told him.
“This is helping?” T’Challa asked Nakia.  “How is this helping?”
“Tony-” Steve said from the bed, and he sounded almost amused.  “Don't-”
“It’s the American way,” Bruce said.  He pushed himself to his feet.  “Need me to help?”
Peter blinked.  “Yes.  He just-”
“We’re not wrong,” Jess agreed.  She paused. “And wow, that’s terrifying.”
She waved a hand at Steve.  "You know how to pin a jacket, go ahead and-"
Tony stared at him.  “That's worse.”
“Thursday, beloved.” Clea’s voice echoed down from the second floor.
“Do I get a vote?” Sam asked, staring at Bucky.  “Because I would very much like a vote.”
Tony hummed into his coffee cup, watching as Peter wobbled across the lawn, DJ perched unsteadily on his shoulders.  Steve followed them, just a few steps behind, a bushel basket braced on his hip.  Tony had no doubt that he had collected twice as much fruit as the two boys combined.  As Tony watched, DJ reached up, carefully pulling an apple free from a branch just above his head, and handed it over to Steve. Steve held it up in front of him, as if this one piece of fruit was worth the full force of his attention.
Steve thought about that.  “Was that the first kid you bought breakfast for?”
Tony's head fell back.  “The fountain.   Of course, the fountain.”
“Fake it for a few minutes, okay?” Tony asked her.  She flipped him off.  “Perfect.  Knew we could count on you.”  He waited for them to clear the room before he turned back to Steve.  He leaned against the nearest console.  “You okay?” he asked.
He’d drawn Peter and DJ in the act of collecting pears from one of the trees down in the orchard.  Peter was perched on a branch, a basket propped on his hip, a bare foot braced against the tree trunk.  Above him, DJ was tangled in the limbs, his suspenders hanging down around his hips, pears piled high in fabric of his shirt.  It was a rough sketch, more for composition and placement, but there was a warmth to it, a feeling of youthful freedom that shone through, even in the simple, straightforward lines.
“Not bad, flatfoot,” Tony said, and Rogers face relaxed, just for a second, a bright, boyish smile creasing his cheeks.  It disappeared almost as quickly as it had appeared, but for some reason, it felt like a victory anyway.
Tony’s eyes flicked over his face, a slight smile curling his lips.  “That’s a very long list, officer, and I’ll be old and gray before you reach the end of it.”
“May I come in?”
Sitwell leaned in, a tray of wrapped sandwiches and cups of soup balanced on one hip.  “Got you some real food,” he said, setting it on the table.  “If you want it.  Lewis, we need you downstairs, Dr. Foster is having a bit of a nervous reaction to the possibility of the ‘imminent collapse of the multiverse,’ and handling that is squarely in your job description.”
“Don’t care, long list of things I give no fucks about, and way, way, way on the top is ‘if Steve is actually hungry,’” Tony said, waving a hand through the air.  He turned back to his work, and it was waiting for him, frozen in space and time, missing only his touch to come to life again.  “You can force something down.”
“Not necessary, but always appreciated,” Tony said.  Steve’s hands were creeping up under his shirt again, and Tony arched back.  “Leave it-  I’ve got-”
Steve shook his head as he dug through his saddlebags.  “Not a prince,” he said, pulling a water flask out.  It was light for its size, well balanced and even better crafted.  Like everything he’d encountered in Wakanda, the function had never been forgotten in the pursuit of perfecting its form.
Hammer immediately looked at Tony, and Tony's eyes narrowed. “Such a shame to miss the movie,” he said. “I couldn't, of course, what would it look like, I bring these boys here, and then immediately leave? People would notice.” He smiled. “No reason the two of you couldn't get along, though. Be a nice break from your usual grind.”
Franklin shrugged.  “Mine are okay,” he said.  “Still arguing about school.”
Tony grinned at her.  “I figured you might’ve noticed him,” he said.  He fished in his pocket.  “I need you to go up and let him know that I’m taking the kid up to the balcony.  Just tell him Mr. Stark went upstairs with the boy.  He’ll be worried if this one-” He dipped his head in DJ’s direction.  “Doesn’t come back.  He’s got the rest of the boys, so he can’t come looking?”
And once the stage was set, quilts spread on the ground and sheets fluttering in the breeze, they brought out the food.  Clint lead the way, making the trip across the lawn half a dozen times, massive silver trays balanced on his shoulder or his hip, filled with platters of cold fried chicken, bowls of potato salad and cole slaw, baskets of crisp potato chips and jar after jar of pickles.  There were tea sandwiches and and plates of sliced cheeses and meats, baskets of golden brown biscuits, and napkin-wrapped loaves of french bread, laid out one after another on the table.
“Let's just say that we had a problem holding onto gear,” he said, his eyes dancing.  “And you can eat a lotta stuff with two relatively straight sticks.”  He tapped the tips of his chopsticks together with a grin.  “Who taught you?”
“Fuck you,” Jessica said, grinning at her.
"All would agree, there were none less likely," Thor said, swinging Mjolnir idly from hand to hand.  Everyone scooted their chairs away from him.  He didn't seem to notice.
A nice date.
“I love you, too, little sister, enough to help you design some sort of an angled path that will launch your rejected suitors directly into the deepest jungle,” Nakia said, her voice cheerful, and  T’Challa pressed a hand to his eyes.
“He is in the living room with Clint.”
“Good.”  Tony smiled at him, trying to ignore the way his chest ached.  “Let’s go.”
“He's learning how to dance from me,” Jan said.  “Clint is assisting.”
“Do me a favor,” Tony said.  “Tell her I died.”
“Hi,” Steve said, and movement in the parking lot below him caught Tony's attention.  He leaned forward, somehow not surprised to find Steve standing there, looking painfully attractive in a pair of jeans and a skin-tight white t-shirt.  He had a plastic bag in one hand and his phone in the other, and even from this distance, Tony could see the hopeful, lopsided smile on his face.
DJ took a long sip of his juice.  “Stark-Rogers,” he said at last.  “Technically.  But biologically?” He shrugged.  “Stark.”
“Empanadas.”  Isaiah straightened up.  “Expected you to be dressed and ready to go.”
“Let’s go,” Obie said, gesturing with the gun, and Tony looked up, just in time to see the door behind Obie open, swinging open on silent hinges.  As Tony watched, horrified, Jarvis stepped through the open doorway, a pot of coffee held in one hand, the tray held in the other.  He shook his head, and Jarvis ignored him.
“Didn't forget,” DJ repeated.  “You didn't.”
"Ah, a hundred and ninety pounds-" he started, and Jan cut him off.
Occasionally, their procession had crossed paths with a smaller caravan of traders, their wagons drawn by rattling little machines or heavy draft horses.  A group of students, on their way back from an expedition into the mountains, had paused by their campfire, chattering and enthusiastic about their work, despite the filthy state of their clothes and their sunburned faces.
Tony glanced at Steve, who took a deep breath.  "Ready," he said, and Tony smiled at Marcy.
It had been years since he'd been this small.  He was barely bigger than he'd been when he'd first ended up as a human, and it was terrifying to hold him, to feel his little fingers pull against the fabric of his shirt.  Doing his best not to think about it, Clint just held DJ close, resting his chin on top of DJ's head.  “It's going to be okay,” he said, because maybe if he said it enough, they'd both believe it.  “It's going to be fine.  You're still you.  Big.  Small.  Bot.  Kid.”  DJ's arms tightened on his neck, his fingers digging into Clint's shoulder.  “You're still you.”
Tony grinned.  “I'm very delicate,” he agreed.  He reached for a circuit board.  “Spit it out, Storm.”
“I shall meet you in honorable combat,” Thor said.
“And now Bruce,” Natasha continued.  “And they couldn’t A. buy that much Jell-O and B. transport that much Jell-O. However, know what’s much smaller than the pool?”
Sam was standing directly across the hall from Steve’s front door, his shoulders and one foot braced against the wall. “Huh, half an hour earlier than you usually start your morning run,” he said, his thumbs tapping against his phone.  He didn’t look up  “Your unpredictability is sadly predictable.”
“Yes, but they change so often that we’ve all found it easier to ignore them until we know which one you’re planning on enforcing on a particular day,” Jarvis said.  “And then apologize.”
Steve thought about that.  “I would not know where to start.”
“Do I get some?” Tony asked her.
“I think,” Ellen said, very careful now, “all you have to be is yourself.”
Tony's eyes slid in her direction.  "Did you just undermine me?"
Everything clicked.  "He's-  He's physically regressed," Clint said, his stomach sinking.  "You're telling me he's gone back to being, uh, a little kid?"
Steve nodded, scrubbing harder.  “By which you mean, Sam.”
“Or, if you insist on being difficult, I’ll take my time on our way out of this house.  I have plenty of bullets, Tony.  I’m just curious where I should start.  The pathetic Parker child?  He idolizes you, it’ll be a pleasure to tell him that it’s your fault he’s about to die.  His aunt?  Or that disrespectful old relic you insist upon keeping upon your payroll?”
The kitchen door opened.  “Dinner will be served in fifteen minutes,” Jarvis announced.  “For anyone-”  He cleared his throat.  “And everyone who needs to freshen up.”
“We're assuming it has something to do with the assassination attempts,” Natasha mused.
Steve opened his mouth, and from below, a demanding voice called up, “Well?  Is it fixed?”
“So do I get to see the new color?” Tony asked.
“What do I do with it?” Bucky asked.
“Sorry,” Steve said.  The door opened, and he looked over, a sheepish smile on his face.  “Yeah, I’m…”  His shoulders rose in a shrug.  “Sorry.”
“Not really my style,” Tony said, slipping his jacket on and smoothing it into place, his shoulders flexing beneath the perfect fit of the fabric.  He checked the cuffs, adjusted his tie, and headed for the elevator.  “Give me one good reason why I shouldn't just go pick out one of my many cars and-”
Tony nodded.  “Fine.  Stay.  See if I care,” he said.  “You’ll be gone soon enough.  Story of my life.  Everyone leaves.  Everyone...”  He rocked back, his shoulders shaking with muted laughter.  He was almost certain it was laughter.  “Fuck.  Gone.  Gone.”
Tony rolled hard, cutting between two buildings, finding a space so narrow that he could if he'd rolled flat, his shoulder would've clipped the masonry.  “Coulson, tell me you've found out something about this.  Please.  You can make me happy very easily here, just tell me-”
Steve smiled at him.  “Merry Christmas, Tony,” he said, and somehow the flowers were in Tony's hands, and that was fine, because Steve was leaning in, just a little.  Cautious.  Careful.  Giving Tony plenty of time to pull back, to put some distance between them.
Clint watched him go, and shut the door behind him.  “Well, that was a dent in the pantry,” he said.
“Excuse me?” Carol gaped at her.  “I am the FOUNDER of the Council of Lesbians!  I am the ONLY LESBIAN in the Council of Lesbians!”
Steve watched him go, and when the door shut behind him, he relaxed back against the headboard, his hand stretching out to cover Tony’s.
“There are worse ways, sir,” Jarvis said.
DJ shuffled through his flashcards, his mouth pursed as he considered two of them.  His head swung between them, his expression considering.  Doing his best to hide his smile, Tony waited for him to make up his mind, and reached for an onion.  He should probably find his mandolin.  He rolled his knife in his hand, rotating his wrist.  He probably should, but he wasn’t going to.
Everyone, as one, looked up at Peter.  It took him a second to realize it, and then he stared down at him, his head snapping from one side to the other.  “What?  Why is everyone looking at me?  I hate the press.”
“Right.  Peter.”  Bruce jerked his chin towards the door.  “Go.”
He gave a slight, resigned nod.  “It was the best we had, Miss Van Dyne.”
Jesse looked around the edge of the picture, nodding and smiling.  “And that makes this one-” She tapped the brunette, and Ellen recognized that jawline at last.
Tony pushed himself up, moving across the bed.  “For how long?”
“It doesn’t,” she agreed.   “Because he taught my nephew how to slide down the stairs on an antique tray, and make as much noise as possible the entire way.”  She straightened up.   “Boys!” she called, cutting the apple apart.  “The floor will wait.  Come have a snack.”
Miss Potts nodded.  "Then you can leave through the backdoor, through the laundry yard," she said.  The look she gave him was half scolding, half amused.  "Or are you going to let me go down in the dark, empty kitchen all by myself?” She pressed a hand to her chest, her eyes wide in mock alarm.  “What if someone's waiting down there?"
“Non,” Clint said.  He had a knife in his hand and a rather crazed look in his eyes.  Tony grinned at him.
“I don’t think this group knows a setting lower than an eight,” Sam said.  Tony reached around Steve, his hand up, and Sam gave him a high five.
“I know you will,” Steve agreed, taking a cookie of his own.  “You have class today?”
Hammer, for his part, burst into laughter, a little too loud and a little too sharp. Even in the crowded space of the lobby, heads turned in his direction. “There's that famous Tony Stark humor!” Hammer said, his hands propped on his hips. “Amazing. Just amazing.”
“A font of wisdom, if ever there was one,” Steve said, ducking around an elderly couple.
Steve kept from rolling his eyes. Barely. "Glad that's settled. As Agent Coulson pointed out, though, that still leaves Loki out there somewhere. We should have a plan. Some kind of actual plan."
It was disconcerting to suddenly be standing in a gilded chamber with a rainbow bridge stretched out before them, but Natasha had recovered from stranger. Recently it seemed she was always recovering from something stranger. The woman drew herself up and studied the stoic man in gold armor. "Thank you."
"Same here. And I don't haveta worry about 240 pounds of Captain America rolling over on me," he added. While having a metal skeleton meant outweighing even Steve by a solid amount, the guy sleeping on his arm hadn't felt good. He pressed his lips to Scott's hair. "'Sides, you're cuter." His voice roughened a little as he added, "And I like the way you moan when I talk dirty to ya."
In which Nat and Clint have some bro time.
Steve had never been a fan of self portraits. The only time he'd done it, he'd been making fun of himself more than trying to capture any moments. Still, the idea that Tony would want that, want to capture him that way, especially the way he looked without the serum, that was enough to make Steve smile. "Yeah, maybe," he agreed quietly. Steve tensed his muscles briefly to squeeze Tony's cock in a perverse sort of welcome. "Right now I just want to make this couch so messy that even you feel inspired to clean it."
"I can't help thinking something like this has to hit even a guy like Fury," Scott answered, "but maybe I'm giving him too much credit." The man was cold. He was a leader in a whole different realm from Xavier. Fury wasn't interested in being anyone's friend. He did his job, and he expected everyone else to do theirs. Scott still hadn't decided how he felt about the change in styles. "What do you think happens to this place? The tower, all the stuff in it, the AI. This place was built from the ground up by Stark."
"She... she made some sounds when I first came in. She was out by the time I got across the room, though," Clint answered, numbly watching the orderlies work. He was trying to fight back panic. Surely Loki hadn't sent her back just to die. Surely she'd be okay.
As the two Avengers passed another seedy looking dive, an impulse occurred to Tony. Never the sort to ignore these things, he took a sharp turn into the narrow alleyway leading to the door. "Y'know what? I need a drink. You need a drink, Cap?" He didn't bother with waiting on an answer, instead ducking inside. The place was dark, smokey, and smelled pretty strongly of piss. "Looks like a great place for a drink," Tony remarked as half the bar turned to look at the only white men in the place.
"Yeah. I know you haven't done any sharing yet, but have you thought about it?" she answered smoothly.
The nighttime streets of Tokyo were alive and crowded with people, and Tony was beginning to wonder if they'd ever find Logan. "This guy's more paranoid than Hill. How many bars do you think he goes to a week? There're only so many in this city."
Steve faltered and more or less stopped breathing for several seconds. The air rushed back into his lungs with an audible gasp, and Steve tried to find something to say. On top of everything else, Steve felt himself drifting into a strange parody of a fantasy he’d let go of when Bucky was lost. Tony had revived it in a way, dragging up feelings and questions he had buried carefully. “You wouldn’t?” The words could have easily been a joke. Steve wanted to tread lightly.
Clint grumbled as the gentle touch woke him, and he rolled back into Coulson, draping his arm across the man and burrowing his face between the pillows his handler was propped up on and Phil's body. He dozed back off for a few minutes before reluctantly waking. He turned his head so he could look up at the other man, then forced himself to sit up slightly and leaned heavily against him. Noting the tablet in Phil's hand and the grim look on the man's face, Clint reached up and cupped Phil's cheek, urging him down so he could brush their lips together. "I take it the updates aren't so great." He hadn't really expected them to be, considering what they'd already known. Phil's expression just confirmed it. Clint pressed his head against the man's chest, trying to comfort himself with the sound of Phil's heartbeat. He didn't want to lose physical contact with Coulson, not even for a second. He was pretty sure he was going to have a hard time maintaining any sort of professionalism during the debriefing, because he knew he was going to want to more or less lean against Phil the entire time.
In which Clint and Phil spend some time bonding, worrying, and then being interrupted. As usual.
"Not an inaccurate statement," Coulson agreed. He finally allowed, "If you think you can handle yourself with some small measure of comportment, the media probably would like to see you there."
Clint scowled, then nearly jumped through himself when another plane seemed to materialize out of nowhere a few hundred feet away and came to a landing nearby. He already had bow and arrow in hand when Bruce's hand landed on his shoulder.
"Hey, you signed the waiver when you decided not to sleep on the couch," Logan muttered, rolling over and closing his eyes.
"That's all we saw," Coulson explained, sounding none-too-pleased to have so little to give. "That's all we know."
Steve sagged back in his seat as they took off. They'd enlisted a compatriot of Coulson's, Melinda May, to take the helm of the plane. She was curt, cold, and distant. From what he heard, she was also absolutely fantastic at her job. He hated leaving without Tony especially with Nat and Logan and Scott all locked up like criminals for something beyond their control. "Any word from the X-Men?" he asked Clint to distract himself from the idea that they'd have nothing to do until they landed.
Clint nodded, gladly taking solace in the touch. "Thank you," he whispered, voice rough and shaky. He knew it was an odd sentiment, but he'd needed the reassurance on a level he couldn't quite grasp. He'd wanted it to be Phil. He'd wanted it to be the man he was pressed against in that moment to be the first one to have him like that in years. "It was supposed to be you."
There was a quiet 'snikt!' as Logan growled, "Kid, you're a little stressed out. I think you better calm down before you do somethin' stupid."
Fury scowled. "Not much. Though our systems are pointing to one of Stark's files as having some information we should be aware of." He pointed at a screen which appeared to be monitoring some sort of decryption process. "Trouble is getting into it."
"That's true," Clint agreed, smiling a little as he leaned forward to check for traffic at an intersection. He put on a grim smile. "Gotta remember to feed the ducks when this is all done. It's not over until we've fed them." He remembered the peace he'd felt in that moment, and he felt a strange pang at the thought. He did his best to shake it off. Another glance in the rearview, and Clint caught sight of the two cuddling in the back seat. Another strange stab in the chest, and he refocused on his driving. //Maybe I'm just having a heart attack. That'd be alright.//
All plot, no smut. Sorry about that. We'll fix it later ;)
"How long have you been intentionally hiding your status as a gay man?"
"It is," Jemma answered, her eyes sparkling. She was flattered that he'd remembered, silly and small a thing as that was. "That doesn't mean that it can't seem like magic. Awful as it is to say, I almost wish that we could get hold of Loki for awhile, study him... well, that's neither here nor there." There wasn't much chance of that unless it was to perform an autopsy. When the Avengers went after Loki this time, it wouldn't be to bring him in as a prisoner. "Once things are more settled, maybe we could have a proper dinner together?" They weren't even done with one casual date, and she knew that fishing for a second might be pushing things, but it was going well. Being with Bruce was surprisingly comfortable, and she hoped that he felt the same way.
Bruce sighed, grudgingly dragging the phone out of his pocket, positive he was being recalled right then and there. Thankfully, it was just an update. "Looks like we roll out before dawn," he said, then glanced up at Jemma. "But I guess I get to finish our date, at least." He had to breathe carefully to knock back the edge of anxiety he felt at the thought of the upcoming confrontation. Letting the Hulk loose was on his list of things he least enjoyed, right under root canals, and there was added anxiety as well. "Looks like Barton's going to be bringing the hammer."
"Because Happy had the idea before you did?" Steve asked.
“The small guest or the big one?” she asked.
There was no response.  With a sigh, Steve stacked his hands behind his head, staring up at the patchy, cracked ceiling.  "I just want what's best for you," he said.  "You know that, right?"
“You been a thorn in our side long enough.”
“A diplomatic answer,” Tony said, going back into the fridge.  “Did you eat?”
Her lips twitched, then stretched into a smile, puckish and bright.  “‘The Phony King of England?’” she asked.
“None at all,” Natasha agreed.
DJ blinked at him.  “I’ve never been on a bus.”
Tony grinned down at Pepper, even as he swung her in a wide, wild circle.  She spun out and came back in, one long copper curl having worked its way free of her careful coif to bounce against her cheek.  She was flushed and laughing, her blue eyes bright.  “How do you find these remarkable little gems, Mr. Stark?”
“She was lying,” she said, dropping into the seat next to him.
He leaned back.  “Okay?”
There was a faint tug on the hem of her shirt, and she looked down.  DJ offered her a tall silver cup of greenish sludge.  "Dummy," he said.
“I-” DJ looked at Steve, who gave him a slight smile and a reassuring nod.  DJ took a breath.  “Can you fix it?” he asked Stephen.
He wasn’t a subtle man, but luckily for him, there was nothing subtle about Radio City Music Hall.
Steve looked up, caught off guard.  Rhodes was smiling at him, his broad face friendly and relaxed.  Still, Steve took a step back, his hand falling back to his side.  “Sorry,” he said.  “I wasn't thinking, it's-”  He glanced back at the car, caught by the look of it.  There was something beautiful about the flow of the metal, about the compact, clean lines, about the way the paint flowed over the surface, gleaming as if it was still wet.  “It's beautiful.”
“You don’t have to,” Harris said.  “I’ve got a place, and a cat, wanna meet my cat?”
Bruce looked in her direction.  “No,” he said, stressing the word.  “I don't.”
“He doesn’t actually speak French,” Steve said.
“We know where she lives, too,” Coulson said, and Trip’s head fell forward.
“Tony threw his hands in the air.  I will not,” he said.  “And you can’t make me.”
Tony's nose wrinkled.  “Uh-huh,” he said.  He took a sip of his water.  Steve caught himself staring at Tony's mouth, and tore his gaze away before he ended up embarrassing them all.  “Still.  I could come provide moral support or-”
“Sorry.  I should be better at this, I'm-”
“He didn’t know,” Steve said to Jarvis.
Tony tapped a finger against his lips. “I think you need to run this plan past Hank,” he said, struggling not to laugh.
“I got opera gloves and like, fingerless lace gloves.”  Darcy’s voice floated over the top of the display, and Tony had no idea what row she was in, but it wasn’t this one.  “Or.  And hear me out, here, I want you to seriously consider-”
It exploded.
“Want to start the potatoes?” he asked, even as Natasha tossed a fourth egg at him.  He integrated it into the pattern without a blink.
"PETER!" Tony said, and Peter stopped, his eyes blinking owlishly in Tony's direction.  Tony slumped back into his chair.  "Is it a cat, Peter?"
"Couldn't sleep?"
“For him,” Tony corrected.  He swept a hand through the air.  “But maybe also a little bit for me, because I like it when things are about me, especially you-type things.”
"Forgive me, sir, as it appears a certain amount of judging is in order, based on the situation."
Tony glanced at the door to the workshop stairs.  "Actually, I have to-"
Her mouth flexed.  “Of you.”
“I consider myself to be ready for all contingencies, but I’ll admit, it wasn’t something I’d anticipated,” Bobbi admitted.
Tony's eyebrows arched.  “You...  Okay with that?” he asked.
Steve came around the back of the couch, leaning in so he could see DJ on the tablet screen.  “Do you want to come visit?” he asked, reaching over Tony's shoulder to scratch the cat behind the ear.  It arched up, purring against Steve's palm.
He nodded.  “Why?”
Steve was already shaking his head.  “You need the rest, as much as everyone else.”
“Fuck you,” Ellen said, flopping back on her bed.  “Fuck you specifically, I-”
“Well, that’s an excellent reason,” Steve said.
“I’m sorry, do what?” Tony asked.  He reached up, and for the first time, Steve realized he was still holding onto Tony’s shirt in a death grip.
“Sir!”
“I mean, I think I do,” Tony said.
Greer bounced up, swinging her legs down to the floor.  “Oh, yes, please!”
Marjorie made a 'you're the boss' face.  "Ten bolts."
“I owe him a life debt, I’d have to retaliate,” Tony said, one hand clamping down on Harris’ shoulder.  With a firm tug, he pulled Harris back, and took the broom away from him.  “And while I’m sure you can kill me, too, it’ll just set off a chain reaction of having to murder all of us and you’ll be frustrated and-”
Tony's nails scraped through the short hair at the nape of Steve's neck, making him shudder and groan against Tony's lips.  Tony grinned into the kiss, filing that tidbit away for future study.  “Your place,” he whispered, nipping at Steve's jawline.  “Let's go.”
Steve half turned away, tossing the shield onto his back.  Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Bobbi lean in, brushing a delicate kiss against Natasha’s lips.  Her hand brushed against Natasha’s back, sliding down over the curve of her hip, the touch fleeting and gentle, as she slid into the driver’s seat.
“So it would appear.”
Tony's eyes fluttered shut, just for a second, a second to savor the gentle pressure of Steve's lips, the heat of his body, so close, so familiar.  A second to memorize the pressure of Steve's hand on his shoulder as he leaned in, the soft exhale of his breath as he straightened up again.
A familiar car pulled up into the protected loading zone in front of the doors, catching Steve's attention.  Steve tapped DJ lightly on the head.  “Think Val and Franklin are here,” he said, and DJ's head shot up.  He scrambled to his feet with more energy than grace, all coltish awkwardness.
“No.  You cannot, because if you try it, I’ll stab you with something,” Tony said.
“Twelve minutes.”  Immediate.  Assured.  Truth.
The rain was a shock.
Tony gestured at the seat.  “Well, if I can’t stop you,” he mumbled into his coffee cup.  “Why ask?”
DJ was asleep, his head resting on Darcy’s shoulder, his lips parted and his eyelashes casting shadows over his cheekbones.  His chest tight, Tony studied him, trying not to see himself in DJ’s features.  But it was there, and it hurt.
Stark stared at her.  "Excuse me?"
There was a beat of silence, so complete that he could hear the girl breathing against his chest. And then the whole team started yelling at him at once.
“If you don't mind,” Jarvis said, his voice amused. “The garage floor is currently empty. When you are ready to move, I can seal the doors to make sure there is no further access. Escort sir to the elevator, and I will make it an express straight to the penthouse.”
“You really think I need to be told to wear pants?” Tony asked.
Another kiss, Steve's lips lingering against his skin, and then he started reading.
Greer blew a curl away from her eyes, glaring at Jess. “You-” Her nose wrinkled.  “You’re humoring me.”
“You can seduce me pretty much by breathing, but I wouldn't object some poetry thrown in there,” Steve said.  He leaned a shoulder against the wall, his smile warm as he looked at Tony.  “It couldn't hurt.”
Steve's fingers tightened, just for an instant, and then relaxed.  Without thinking, Tony raised caught Steve's hand in his, raising it up and pressing a light kiss to Steve's ragged knuckles.  “There we go,” he said.  “Trust me.  I'm not going anywhere.  I'll be your pillow until Sam comes to replace me.”
“Mr. Stark?”
"Did you wash your hands?" Tony asked him.
His eyes snapped open, and he found Sam right in front of him, his hands held out, almost, but not quite touching his shoulders.  Sam gave him a reassuring smile.  "I need you to breathe, Steve," he said, his voice gentle.  "Because if you pass out on me, I'm going to have to either let you faceplant or try to catch you, and you're out of my weight class, man.  We do this, you're going to end up on the ground."
Steve knew what was coming, but if they were going to do this, he was going to make them work for it.  “And?”
“Von Doom's a nutball?” Duck suggested, before taking another sip of his coffee.  “Ellen-”
“And I have learned my lesson.”
Shuri smiled.  “Yes, you were very suspicious until I told you that I was coming along.”
“Oh, yes, very different from two or three naps I took here on the couch,” Tony said.  He'd spent all day sleeping, and despite that, he still felt exhausted.  But the tea was helping his throat, and Steve was helping with everything else.
“Kid’s got a point,” Steve said, slipping his arms around Tony’s back.  He took a deep breath.  “I love you,” he whispered. “And if you need a tie-”
“He asked who pitches and who catches,” Natasha said, and it took a second for Tony's brain to make that metaphor work.   When it clicked, he winced.
His stomach churned.  “Happy and Clint needed to beat us back.” His fingers flexed on his thighs, going into hard fists.  “To tell him what happened.” He shifted in his seat, the need to move almost unbearable.  “I’m surprised you trusted them to do it.”
A muscle in Steve's jaw jumped.  "I think I'd prefer the firing squad," he gritted out.  "That, at least I'd understand.  This?"  He nodded at the door.  Security was doing a good job at keeping the press and assorted gawkers at bay, but the plaza was packed with bodies, jostling for space and a good angle.  "This is so far from my frame of reference that I just want to lean out and ask them if there isn't something better they could be doing."
“I love it,” he agreed.  “Collins is on my list, though.”
It took far longer than he'd expected to wrestle Tony into his coat, and it wasn't even because he was resisting.  Instead, he seemed almost unresponsive, staring blankly at the far wall as Steve managed to shove his arms into his coat.  By the time they stepped out into the cold night air, they were as prepared as Steve could get him.
Steve choked on a laugh.  "Now who's funny?" he asked.
“Then you know, it was a gesture, and nothing more,” Steve said.  “He never intended-”
“One does one’s best,” Mrs. O’Malley said.  “Speaking of eating, I’ve still got some fried potatoes and cabbage on the hob, wouldn’t be but a moment to heat it up, if you haven’t had your dinner.”
"If I may, sir," Jarvis said, the words cutting smoothly through whatever Steve was about to say, and that was probably for the best.
“Hi,” he said, and he sounded very proud of himself.
“It...  Is not,” Steve said, and Tony burst out laughing.  “Right.” Steve made another grab for it, and Tony scooted his chair out of reach.  “Comics where everywhere when I was a kid!  Everyone had comics!  Now there's like half a page in the newspaper and no one knows what 'Terry and the Pirates' was, I just wanted to read comics, Stark!”
Happy stepped out of his reach, the movement so smooth and easy that Steve was left clawing helplessly at the air.  One of Happy’s hands shot up in the air.  “Wait.  Gotta…”  He looked at Steve, his eyes wide.  “My cigar.  Don’t wanna drop, it, gotta find someplace to-”
“No, it's not,” he said, with the surity of a man who would sooner appear naked in public than with a crooked bow tie.  He sat back dow, rolling his chair back to his desk with his usual fussy series of minor adjustments.
His hand seemed to move against his will, his fingers closing on the edge of the tablet.  Behind him, Steve shifted.  "Pepper?" he asked, and Pepper's eyes darted in his direction.  But she didn't say a word.
"Thank you," she repeated, and then, at the last second, she twisted around in the chair.  "Officer Rogers said to keep an eye out for one of the boys here, maybe you know him?
“And none of them involve this kind of fancy footwork,” Clint said, giving him a firm shove between his shoulder blades.  “Try it again.”
He picked up a nut and rolled it across the workbench towards DJ.  It bounced its way across the metal surface and DJ leaned over, waiting until it slowed almost to a stop before he picked it up.  Tony folded his arms on the top of the bench, content to watch DJ turn the small bit of metal over and over between his fingers.  “It’s nice to have someone around who appreciates the little things in life,” he said, and DJ nodded, his attention still focused on the nut.
“No,” Greer said, and Jess’ lower lip poked out.  Greer rolled her eyes.  “Fine.  I can use whatever help I can get.”
Clint twisted around, scanning the crowd.  “He’s with DJ and Harris, they’re-”
“That's...  That's not at all true,” Jess said.  She sounded sad.  “Your clothes are horrible.”
“Sir will have a boiled egg today,” Jarvis said, because no one listened to him around here.  “Perhaps a soft boiled egg with some toast points to dip into the yolk, if he also agrees to eat a baked apple.”
Stark's lips kicked up in a lopsided smile. “Judging by the expression on your face, though, I'm assuming this isn't one of them.”  He unbuttoned his cuffs, rolling his sleeves up.  “What've you done to my engine, Rhodes?”
“Hello?”
“You can look around if you want,” Trip offered.  “We don’t get busy until later on in the evening, and you shouldn’t commit to the first place you see.”
“And we have two very different life experiences here,” Darcy said.
“I’m not-” The door crashed open behind him, and Harris jerked around, the broom coming up to ward off the newest threat.
The library was quiet and still, the rows and rows of bookshelves piled high with heavy old volumes and random piles of scrolls and tablets.  Dust motes floated through the air, caught in the golden light of the lamps.  The center of the library was dominated by a massive table, worn smooth by countless years of use, and stained by a variety of things that DJ did his absolute best not to think about.
“Where, exactly, are you?” Steve asked him.
"You've already broken him, Jarvis," Stark said.  "You can ease back a bit on the throttle."  He turned back to his work, dismissing them both without a word.
Slink, uninterested, padded into the bedroom, his tail held high.
Wrong.
“And what if he’s not intending to tell Rogers about the rest of the passages?” Natasha asked, not really concerned about the answer.
“Don’t worry, I’m the only one who RSVPd,” Natasha said.  She picked up a bottle of brandy, snapping the lid free with a twist of her wrist.  “Thor’s still in Asgard, pleading our case, and Clint’s downstairs keeping Bruce as calm as possible.” She upended the bottle, dumping the liquor into the sink.  “Since, as you know, the Other Guy is already on edge with DJ being missing.  He’ll be in a bad mood if he does show up, and I think we have had our fill of that.”
On the other end of the line, Tony was silent for a long moment.  “Is it at least going well?” he asked at last.
“Yes.”  The word was immediate, certain.  Relieved.
That was met with stony silence.  He looked up.  Pepper, Maria Hill, and Marcy Pearson, Stark Industries VP of Public Relations, stared back at him, their faces indicating that they would not be moving on any time soon.  Next to him, Steve was sitting just as still, his shoulders squared, his face unreadable.  He'd barely said two words since the meeting from hell had started, not that Tony blamed him.
Steve kept the smile on his face as DJ nodded, slipping into the chapel with Darcy.  He kept the smile on his face when he turned to Tony.  He kept the smile on his face when he said, “What’s wrong?”
The woman glanced back long enough to nod. "You too, Captain," she answered in a monotone before putting her eyes back on the horizon.
"Well, we all have our lapses," Tony decided, tugging Steve close for a gentle kiss. As he let go, he finally made himself sit up as well. "And apparently Bruce fiddled with Jarvis and changed my alarm to... hm... off, so either he's really sick of me, or he's feeling unpatriotic, too." Leaning in, he pressed his cheek to Steve's, sighing quietly as his hand trailed over his lover's slender chest and rested on his waist. "I don't wanna go. One of us is going to have to act like a grownup."
Simmons nodded solemnly. She drifted over from her own station, placing a hand on Bruce's shoulder so that she could lean in to see where he was in the process. The lab was a place in which she let herself forget the concept of personal space since generally it was just her and Fitz, and there was no reason not to be relaxed. She realized a moment later that Bruce might not appreciate the invasion of his space, but it seemed too late to draw back, so Simmons simply blushed and focused on the equations instead. "We need to find a way to stabilize it. Poor Captain Rogers is going through more than enough without," she gestured to the screen and sighed. "What if we..." Still leaning into Bruce, she tapped at a few keys and bit her lip, utterly missing the fact that Fitz was glaring at them from across the room.
Clint nodded casually, almost managing to look completely innocent as he glanced around the kitchen. "Yep, all done. Just making sure there aren't any evil bastards in here to get you all worked up and do absolutely nothing about it," he said, the hint of mischief in his clear blue eyes becoming evident. He didn't really care if anyone caught them. The worst it'd earn him was a dressing down. //Wouldn't be a first…//
Nat frowned, gaze narrowed. "He's showing off. He got away from Thor, he damn near beat us last time, and he's showing off. Drawing attention. Our attention."
Tony took hold of the chair's wheels and moved himself just a little closer. "Oh, god..." He'd read up on Steve's transformation, seen the before photos... He still couldn't help the strangled half-sob that came out of his mouth as he leaned against the bed, putting a hand over Steve's, careful of the IV. The blonde looked strangely delicate, felt strangely frail. Dark circles glared prominently from under Steve's eyes, and Tony reached up to stroke his lover's hair. "Please," he whispered, voice shaking, "please don't leave me." Tony shuddered, pressing his face to the mattress, his hand still over Steve's. He started to shake, and Tony was almost surprised when he started to cry quietly into the sheets.
"Well, for one thing, we need Barton up here to surgically remove him from that source of unspeakable evil he's carrying around," Tony remarked, then glanced at Jemma. "And Fury wants you to make sure I'm not a pod person."
"Maybe you should slow down just a little, Tony."  Restraint wasn't exactly the man's strong suit. Tony did everything in excess, and it worried Steve sometimes. Tony was too much too fast and too loud all the time, and he wouldn't have changed that for anything. Annoying as it could be, it was what made Tony the man he was. Unfortunately sometimes watching him attempt to self destruct could also be terrifying. Turning back to Logan, he offered a shrug. "He's not wrong. It's done. But would I do it all over again? Even knowing I'd end up here with everybody I ever knew dead and gone or in a nursing home somewhere? Yeah. I would. In a heartbeat."
Phil said nothing, though he suspected he'd tensed enough at the question to give himself away. They hadn't been given time to enjoy that particular luxury yet, and Phil was definitely regretting that they'd decided to take things slowly. He regretted even more that anything that happened between them in the future would be tainted thanks to Creed. He regretted that he'd have to wait to see what it felt like to flay the mutant alive. Since it definitely bore repeating, Phil tried for a calm tone as he said, "It's going to be fine, Barton. We're going to get through this."
"I've gotta be honest, I like him unbroken," Steve answered. Sometimes he wondered if he liked Tony a little too much. Being friends with his team was wonderful, but Steve had learned the hard way that romance and work could get pretty messy in combination, not least because their "work" tended to be so potentially deadly. "But we all want to slug him every now and then." Steve put a companionable hand on Logan's shoulder as they walked down the hall. "If he knows something, he wants everyone to know he knows it. If he has something to show you, he's like a five year old who just made a drawing they're really proud of. You just have to ride it out."
Tony, careful not to touch the gun, pointed out each and every feature, carefully explaining how to use it with a patience he didn't usually have. If it had been anyone else, he'd have made Bruce do it, but it was Steve, and Tony was going to make damn sure that the blonde understood everything. "You don't need full power to do what needs to be done. Just about fifty percent. Just a few seconds. We don’t-" Tony's voice shook and faded into an odd half-sigh, half-whimper as he tried to get control of his emotions. "We don't know what, exactly, it'll do to you." He glanced up, looking lost. "Or how much you'll be able to take."
The words were hard to hear but kindly meant. The sooner Steve accepted the reality of the situation, the better off he would be. He swallowed and nodded. "It doesn't matter who took him. He was taken. He's with Hydra, and he's not safe. I promised that I would take care of him and-"
Tony reached for another pastry, finding himself more hungry than usual. "We'll get you settled in and you'll be feeling at home in no time." He indicated one of the arches leading off to a hall with his coffee cup. "There's four guest bedrooms on this floor. Or, if you want to be closer to me, there's a couple upstairs."
Note: Steve/Logan/Tony isn't listed as a pairing because, well, it's just this once. So enjoy it!
Tony was certainly enjoying the deception. His legs rose to wrap around Loki's waist as if trying to pull him deeper. The rough entry had hurt, but Tony couldn't bring himself to care. It felt too good, too comforting, and he wasn't about to complain. "Fuck yes, baby," he murmured, lightly nipping at the god's throat as he arched underneath his captor. "Fuck... feels so good... Love you so much..."
Clint shuddered, rolling up to all fours and puking up what little was in his stomach. He stayed there, eyes squeezed shut, shivering as he tried to keep from breaking down completely.
The move was enough to divert Steve's attention momentarily. He looked back at Logan, dazed, and found himself nodding as if the man couldn't read consent in the way he gasped at the touch. Though he wasn't about to stop moving inside of Tony, the duel stimulation was anything but unpleasant. It was wonderful. It was hard to picture anything being as sexy as Tony coming undone beneath him, but the thought of what he and Logan could do to one another without even being sore the next morning had some serious potential as well.
"I'm just worried they might just drop us," Clint responded, but he nodded, quietly rechecking his equipment. "We'll play your way. If half the stories I've heard are true, you and I aren't going to stand much of a chance if they decide we need to be shuffled off this mortal coil. I guess I could leave the toys in the car, huh?" As if to answer his own question, he put the stuff away and pushed the bag under the seat. He was silent for a moment before cutting his eyes at Coulson through his shades. "You think I'm pretty?" he asked teasingly, oblivious to how loaded a question it was.
A new gun appeared, and the next shot was for Tony. By the time the Winter Soldier scooped him up from the bed, he was out cold.
Tony sighed, letting himself sink into the mattress. It felt good. Too good to let his mind latch onto the imperfections, the off cadence, the oddly formal turn of phrase. Loki was letting him have Steve, and it could have been a lot worse. The touch of lips against his neck drew nothing more than another quietly satisfied murmur from him, and his muscles relaxed, melting under the contact. "Need this. Need you," he mumbled into the pillows, letting himself forget reality for the moment.
"It will, ma'am," Steve agreed solemnly. Expression still strained, Steve managed, "Everybody come back okay?"
//Did I just get told to stay because I'm a warm body?// Clint didn't argue, though, taking the woman's hand and letting her lead him back to the bedroom. He'd planned to just sleep on the couch. "I think I'd be willing to play body pillow for you, if you need me to," he agreed, tugging off his boots and shirt. "Wouldn't want you to get cold."
Tony's hands roamed Steve's body, exploring, refamiliarizing himself with his lover. The blonde was small, but he didn't feel as delicate as he looked. There was a sort of with resilience to him. It figured, really, considering that Steve would have likely pushed himself to the absolute limits of whatever body he was in. Pushing Steve over onto his back, Tony pressed himself against the blonde's side, his fingers trailing down Steve's chest, his stomach, finally tracing over his lover's cock as he watched Steve's face. "Love the way you look when you're turned on," he murmured, leaning in for a kiss.
"Because violence is always the answer," Bruce dead panned.
It was sensory overload in the best of all possible ways being trapped between the two men. Steve fumbled with the nightstand drawer and was rewarded with the discovery of a mostly full bottle of lube and a box of condoms. Steve hesitated, ultimately deciding the decision was up to Tony. He nodded toward the box. "Would you like me to wear one? I can't actually catch anything, so I can't actually give you anything, but..." He knew it was the norm and wanted Tony to feel comfortable even if he vastly preferred the idea of there being absolutely nothing between them.
Tony grinned and moved in closer, kneeling beside Steve's head. He was about to offer his cock to the man when Logan pushed him back. He opened his mouth to protest, but something in Logan's eyes stopped him.
Phil blushed to the tips of his ears but didn't let his expression change. "Oh, I'm not supposed to be watching. Now it's just a fetish." He couldn't help but shake his head as he added, "I wonder who's watching me." Catching Clint's gaze, he pressed, "We both know however I ended up still being alive and walking around, it wasn't your average episode of ER. Something went down. I imagine that they're making sure it sticks or that I don't go postal. I would if I were them."
Callie blinked at him.  “Don't you mean-”
Steve did as he was told.  Satisfied, Mrs. Parker headed over to the bed.  “Will you be joining us as well?” she asked Furbro, scratching the cat behind the ear.  “Or will you be keeping the good Officer company tonight?”
Rhodes grinned.  “Sam said you were a smart one.  Nice to know he’s still an excellent judge of character.”  He looked at Steve out of the corner of his eyes.  “Nobility and the wealthy.  They have private guards, and we leave it at that.  Things get rough, get word to Danvers.  She’ll handle it.”
“Hey, Pete.  You keep sneaking out during the rush and Tony's going to have your head.” Steve popped the waffle, crusted with sugar crystals and perfectly browned, into the warming oven.  “You hungry?  Special tonight's chicken fried in panko and tossed in a pepper and maple glaze and served between two Belgian waffles, with arugula and pickled vegetables.”
Without looking up from his book, Rhodey took the page from him.  “We can’t do this,” he said.
Shuri peeked at her from under her fingers.  “I should find it easier to bear the grief if there was-”
Rhodey gave him a look.  “Are you really going to compound this problem with bigamy?”
Tony shook his head.  “I think everything on my wish list is right here.”  He smiled up at Steve.  “Merry Christmas.”
She looked up.  “My preference, of course, would be to rent the function space here in the building,” she said.  “It's big enough, there's an excellent catering company on call, the security is already in place, and I'm familiar with the layout and the staff.”  She huffed out a breath.  “But when I contacted the building management, I was informed that it was already under contract.”
“We had three jobs, Drew.”
“You know, before I took this job, I would've thought that a sentence like that could only be a metaphor,” Marcy said.
Tony said something that was probably obscene, and Steve grinned.  “Right,” he said, pulling his keys from the ignition and slipping them into his pocket.  He pushed the driver's side door open and slid out.  “Stay put.”
DJ’s mouth worked, but he couldn’t seem to manage a word.  Instead, he just nodded, his face exhausted.  Tony considered him.  “What happened?”
Peter let out a long, sustained groan, curling up in a ball.  Tony nodded.  “Right.  Coffee.  Everyone gets coffee.  And anyone who can tell me what the hell happened between me drinking my weight in booze and Parker reliving the nifty fifties trips to the soda fountain gets breakfast, too.”
Tony leaned over, peering past the couch.  Peter was curled into a ball under a too-small throw blanket, half under the coffee table.  Tony braced both hands on the back of the couch, leaning his weight into them.  “What…  What is he doing?  I have…  I have other furniture, Parker.  I have other BEDROOMS, why are you-”  His head fell forward, and he took a deep breath.  “Rhodes.  Why is the child on the floor?”
Harris took a deep breath.  “Right,” he said.  “So, and I’m just trying to make sure that I understand where you’re coming from here, DJ, okay?  So you think that you being here, that the reason any of this happened, is because you’d been thinking about that email?”
“Clea’s been keeping him updated while the two of us-” Stephen gestured at Steve.  “Have been here.  I think that she’ll-”  Strange had magicked a book from somewhere and was bent over it, murmuring in a dark voice over the pages.  Stephen gave him a look.  “I need to…  Handle this.”
Steve took a breath, and then another.  “Right.  I-”  He shook his head.  “Sorry.  I didn't even think, I-”
Tony pointed a finger in his direction.  "It's unnatural." Steve cupped a hand over his mouth, and Tony leaned in.  "Are you laughing at me, Rogers?"
Steve considered that.  “My ma was from the old country,” he said at last.  He shifted in his seat, a bit wary.  “Ireland.  She talked a lot about the old ways of doing things, the old-” He shrugged.  “She was a good Catholic girl, Miss Potts, but some things die hard, in the spaces religion doesn't reach.
“Good idea.”
The tea inside barely moved.
Steve nodded.  “Will you-”
"You told me it wasn't a good idea."  It wasn't.  It absolutely wasn't.  He had to keep reminding himself of that.  "A couple of times."
Peter's silverware rattled against the counter.  “It was HALF a pie!” he said, and he sounded so betrayed that Steve couldn't quite hold back a smile.
“Probably more than you know,” Darcy said, just as there was a rap on the conference room door.
"Please don't depend on Reed to tell me anything that doesn't directly relate to his work, your work, or the impending end of the world," Sue said with a faint smile.  "I love the man, but sometimes the little stuff can slip his mind.  And everything qualifies as 'little stuff' to Reed."
“Excuse me,” Steve said.  “We’re going to see a movie?”
“Sounds like your boyfriend kissed him,” Tony said.
Tony's eyebrows arched.  "I promise, even when we get divorced, we can still be friends," he said, his lips twitching.
“Traitor,” Tony said.
“She will text you if she wishes to hear from you again,” Okoye said.  She loomed over him, her eyes going into slits.  “Should she do so?  You will reply.  Immediately.”
"Are we done with the gossip session?" she asked, stepping up beside Tony.  A few laughing calls of 'no' came from the audience, and she gave them a bright smile.  "Well, tough.  Time to go back to being serious financial journalists."
He looked down at the card.  When he tilted it, a holographic gleam rolled across the surface.  “I just might,” he said.
“I'm going to break that 'sword' over your head,” Rhodey called, but he was laughing.
"Three," Steve said, juggling the garlic knot between his fingers, stopping to lick the butter from his fingertips.
Bruce exhaled, a weak little laugh.  "No murder, Tony."  He wiped a shaking hand over his mouth.  "Let's...  Let's not murder anyone."
He put pillows back on couches and wiped crumbs from tables.  He collected champagne flutes from the fireplace and forks from the lounge, put board games back in their boxes and turned off video game systems.  The tower was quiet now, with only the soft sound of the carols played over the sound system to keep him company.
She nodded.  "Came out to tell you, that window of yours is creaking again."  Her eyes slanted up towards the ceiling that separated their apartments.  "Best you check it's closed tight tonight, else you'll hear of it, wasting the heat and all."
Tony nodded.  “How many of these people do I have to take with me?”
Tony realized his mouth was hanging open.  "You...  Blame Jarvis," he repeated.  Steve nodded.  "You're shameless, you know that?"
She took a deep breath. “Imagine my relief.”
DJ shook his head, his face buried in Steve’s shoulder.  “Just-”  His arms tightened, his breath hitching. “Worried he wasn’t here.”
“He's been here, talking to me,” Pepper said cheerfully.  “And I find him to be just delightful, so I think we'll make everything easy on you, and-”
“This metaphor is getting out of hand,” Tony said.
If you'd like to see some of the 'highlights,' consider checking out this video, from one of my favorite YouTube Channels:
"What do you mean, for tonight?" Steve asked, but Jarvis was already heading for the door, several pieces of Steve's clothing draped over his arm.  “Wait, where are you going with that, I'm not going to be-”
Tony watched them go, a strange, almost unfamiliar feeling of satisfaction curling through him.  He turned back to the workbench and caught Rogers' eye.  “There,” he said, reaching for his coffee cup.  “All sorted.”
Steve stared at him.  “What is-  A controlled fall?”
I apologize, I'm finishing this at a friend's house, off of google docs.  I might have missed more typos that usual, but I had promised to get this up by tonight, and my laptop died and I don't have the cord.  Please bear with me, and if you read this before 11/26, please refrain from letting me know about any minors issues, they'll be fixed when I have access to the proper file.
Steve gave him a look.  “Well, that’s a weak attempt, Stark.”
"Oh, I can't possibly let you go barefoot, something could happen," Tony said.  He leaned in.  "I can't be responsible for that."
“If I knew that, I’d already have fixed it,” Stephen said, through gritted teeth.
“Not about me.”
“Objection withdrawn,” Tony said.
“I'm a benevolent overlord,” Tony said, sneaking a bite of Pepper's strudel.  She smacked at his fingertips, making him laugh.
“Like I said, we’re going for the good stuff,” Bobbi said, the words echoing through the Great Hall.  She looked over at him, one eyebrow cocked.  “That’s what ‘asked you to join him for a drink’ means.  It means, meet him at the still, because, well, that’s where we hide it.”
Obie stared down at his empty hand.  “Is there anything else you need?” he asked with a wry twist of his lips.  “My shoes, perhaps? Half my lunch?”
“Steve?”
Clint straightened up, his eyes narrowing in Tony’s direction.  “Oui,” he said, the singular word hard as a rock.
It took a single look for Tony to know the news wasn’t good.
“I’ll be fine,” Peter repeated, going back to his oatmeal.
With a pleased sound, DJ wrapped his hands around the cup, his fingers sliding back and forth over the chipped surface.  He sniffed cautiously at the tea, then took a careful sip.
“I like punching people,” Jessica agreed with a grin.
Shawn marched him towards the salad bar.  “We can negotiate!”
Luke stared at her.  “I can't believe you have people.”
Her eyes came up to meet his.  “And I am quite done with this charade.”  The spoon came up, and it looked like a knife, the edge catching the light.  “Aren’t you?”
Ellen juggled her bag and phone, managing to get a hand free. "Probably back at the coffee shop," she said, grinning. "Hey, have you seen Jesse?"
“Let me know which way you end up going,” Steve said, and Sue laughed.  Steve smiled at her.  “Oh, you think I'm kidding?”
“Who're the flowers for, Cap?”
“I can't, not tonight,” Jan said.  She reached for her wrap and then paused.  “Do you still have that French chef?”
Steve looked back out the window of the car.  “We got lucky tonight,” he said.  “Or rather, he got lucky.”  He tried not to think of blood splattered across the sidewalk, but it was hard.  He’d seen it often enough, and he never wanted to see it again.  Steve sucked in a breath, trying to shake the last of the adrenaline that was rattling his nerves.  “This could’ve been much worse.”
“I'm not good at it,” Steve admitted.  He glanced at Clint.  “But I'm trying.”
"Hello, DJ," she said.  She leaned forward in her chair, her hands braced on her handbag.  "I'm Miss Potts."
“You and everyone else on earth, including Rhodey’s mom,” Tony said.  He held up the water bottle in a mock salute.  “I’m nothing if not entertaining.”
Darcy took a bite of the churro, her jaw working as she tried to chew it.  Clint’s head tipped to the side.  “Speaking of overpaying…”
Shaking his head, Steve headed up the hall to his room.  A few hours of sleep, and then he could head back out, before anyone even knew he was back.
“Yeah, I can see that,” Rhodey said.  He tossed Clint a roll.  “You having a good time, Steve?”
He spotted him, even as the word was leaving his mouth, desperate and helpless.  Tony was on one knee, but still upright, DJ clutched against his chest.  Steve saw the man facing him, saw the way his arm came up, saw the light catch on the barrel of the gun, and swung.
“Hi,” he said, his eyes darting over the lobby.  When he moved, it was careful and slow, his feet picking their way across the carpet.
"Things usually do around him," Tony said.
“You’re trying to date the most oblivious man I have ever met,” Sam said.  “Have you considered…”  He took a deep breath. “Anyone else on earth?”
“Happy is roughly ten minutes away,” Jarvis said.  “And your shoes are in the playroom.”
“Right,” he said, going back to his coffee.  “Because that would be terrifying.” His eyes darted up.  “Not because of you.  Because of Doctor Domagic.”  He stopped again.  “Not that you didn’t have a life before him.  I think you had a life before him, I’m honestly not sure, but I’m pretty sure that I need to believe that he wasn’t your first experience with-”  He stopped.  “I’m not asking for your dating history.”
“I’m not saying it wasn’t a bad choice, or a stupid choice, but I’d like it noted in my file that what I was dealing with?” He held up a finger.  “Tony.  In full shutdown, ‘fuck you I know what I’m doing’ mode.”  He held up a second finger.  “Someone who, for all intents and purposes, is a second Tony Stark, but a teenager, so no sense of self-preservation or any concept of consequences.” He held up a third finger.  “Darcy.” He looked at Phil, at his hand, and back at Phil.  “So I did some stupid shit, Phil, but honestly, if I hadn’t, your backup plan for corralling THAT combination of people was…”  He let his voice trail away, his eyebrows arching.
“Right, right,” Carol said.  “Decide what we want and set up a delivery schedule.  Have restaurants deliver every thirty minutes or every hour.  That way, something fresh is always going out, and our budget goes to the local places that we already know we like.”
“No,” his mother said, snagging him by the back of his shirt.  Sue looked at Jan.  “We’ll take one.”
Bucky stared at her, and mumbled something under his breath.  Next to him, Sam grinned.  “You should be used to being outsmarted by the thirteen year old by now,” he said.
“No,” Steve told him, already struggling to get buttons through wet buttonholes, cursing under his breath as the fabric fought him and Tony provided no assistance at all.
“Maybe.  But both of us knows where the other one stands,” Tony said. “And it’s right behind you  It’s…  Always going to be right behind you, DJ.”
DJ sat up, rubbing his eyes, and Clint collapsed back against the couch, something like relief flitting over his face.  “Yes.  Okay.  Yes.  We're-”  He looked at Steve for the first time, his eyes meeting Steve's for a second before sliding away. “We're fine.  Right?”  He looked at DJ, who was tugging on the sleeve of his pajama top.  “We're okay?”
“A strange sort of freedom, if it means ending up being a servant,” Steve bit out, and Jarvis smiled at him.  Steve stopped, scraping a hand over his face.  “I’m sorry.  That’s…  I didn’t mean it like that.”
“Wait to thank me until the work is done,” Tony said.  He swung around the counter, boosting himself up onto a stool with a fluid, easy grace.  One leg swung back, the toe of his worn boot catching the wooden leg, bracing his body as he leaned forward.  He rolled up his sleeves to the elbow.  “Is it running slow?  Fast?” He glanced at Steve, and reached for a magnifying lens.  “Not running at all?”
She smiled, and it was a sad, resigned sort of smile.  “It is, as you might imagine, a very isolating feeling.”
The cat yawned, showing off a lot of teeth..
“I sincerely doubt this,” Tony said.  But he reached for a cookie.  “I’m telling you now, kid.  You’re going to regret this.”
He spread his hands. "They'd prefer to maintain their ignorance. Because it's easier. It's so much easier." His hands fell into his lap. "But the health and safety of a person who needs to be recognized as a human being, worthy of love and respect, trumps your need to not be bothered."
The night air was crisp and cold, in a way that he’d only found in the desert.  The strip mall the costume warehouse occupied was far enough from the center of the city that the lights were muted, the soft glow of the strip barely creeping into the sky.  Tony leaned back against the building, trying to focus on his phone.
Bucky made a pained noise.  “This is going to haunt my nightmares.”
“Yes,” he said, and they both knew it was a lie.  “Yes, I-”  He swallowed.  “Yes.”
Clint huffed out a breath.  “Right.  We're okay,” he repeated.  He smiled, and it was way too bright, way too broad.  “We're okay.”
He stopped. “I don't know why-” He blinked hard. “I guess, I guess that's the most comfortable anyone's ever been with me.” He would've cried, if he hadn't been so numb. “I don't know. I can't explain it. It's just-”
But once in, there was no way out, except to continue forward.  Steve was used to that.  To just making the best of a bad situation.  To trying to make it to the other side of a bridge as it burned away behind him, as it burned under him.
“Small mercies.”  Phil scribbled a note in the margin of a form before tossing it back in its folder and slapping it shut.  He reached for the next one, ignoring the faint throb behind his temples.
“Especially when you get the idea that most of what’s happening never gets reported.”
“So sorry, I have the right of first refusal on all intellectual property created under my purview or my +roof,” Tony said.  Jarvis heaved an audible sigh, and Tony bit his lip to keep from laughing.  “Also DJ gave them to me, and I like all of them, so I’m keeping them.”  He sipped his coffee.  “We’re redoing the gallery on the third floor, far too many bitter looking ancestors up there, not nearly enough drawings of the internal workings of my pocket watch.  Or cats.”
Steve shifted, and Tony did his best to drag his mind out of the gutter.  He was very, very glad of the pillow between Steve's head and his lap.  “Probably,” he said, and his voice sounded raw, even to him.  He cleared his throat.  “The guy with the money's never had much sense.”
“You absolutely were, and don't,” Pepper told him.
May turned away, crossing to the window and throwing it open.  She leaned out, drew in a deep breath, and let out a scream that made Tony jump.  She turned back to them, the bat balanced on the curve of her shoulder, her white hair a wild cloud around her calm face.  “There.  That should bring someone running, quick enough.”
“How's...  That going?” Luke asked Steve.
“Not a risk I’d take,” Steve said.
For an instant, Tony was frozen in place, caught too off-guard by the sudden meltdown to process the situation.  DJ was curled into a ball, his fingers clawing at his ears, a thin, high pitched shriek pouring out of him.  Tony stared at him, shocked into immobility.
There was a chaise inside, far enough from the door to muffle the sounds from the foyer.  Tony headed for it.  “A cup of water, please,” he said.  The boy nodded, and disappeared back through the door.  Left alone, Tony lowered himself down onto the chaise cushions.  “All right,” he said, trying to sound calm.  “All right.  We’re all right.  You’re all right.  You’re safe.”
Tony's head came up.  “This is going to be a disaster, but fuck it,” he said.  He leaned up, and his lips ghosted against Steve's cheek.  “If you had to have a disastrous, short, regrettable first marriage, I'm glad you picked me.”  He stepped back.  “So, you going to move in?”
DJ darted right past him, laughing the whole time.
The paparazzi went insane.
"What're we painting?" Tony repeated to Steve.
Without thinking, he reached out, his fingertips just brushing against the hollow of Tony’s palm.  Against the pad of his thumb.  Against the hard angle of his wristbone and the rough, calloused skin of his fingers.  There was a scar on the side of his hand, invisible to the eye but obvious to the touch.
“We're not hiding,” Steve told her.
Happy kicked him solidly in the ribs, sending him crashing down into the darkness of the water.  “Hey, what’re you-”
She wrenched the cork free.  “Your choice.  But what you’re looking for?” She took a sip, straight from the bottle, wiping her mouth with the back of her hand.  “You’re not going to find it up here.”
The spike of panic was completely unreasonable, and Steve refused to acknowledge it.  “Does it really matter?” he asked.  His hands came up to cover Tony’s.  “If you really want-”
Seeping through his shirt.
Clint's head tipped to the side.  “He's fine,” he said.  “And you want anything else, you're going to have to talk to him.”  He gave Steve a lopsided smile.  “He's fine.  He's-”  He nodded.  “He's going to be just fine, Steve.”
Peter nodded.  “Chef?”
Steve nodded.  “Yes.  You do, don't you?”  He smiled at Tony.  “Maybe that's why you were so willing to take in a stray when you found one.”
Something wasn’t right.
Natasha walked around the end of the lockers, clad in workout gear, a gym bag over her shoulder. “Demi,” she said, her voice bored.  “But sex is a good stress reliever.”  She dropped her bag onto the bench.  “Is there a reason why we’re sitting in the locker room, discussing sexual orientations?”
Tony stared down at the steering wheel.  “Yes.”
“He’ll slow you down, and that’s all I care about,” Pepper said.
“I’m sure we’re not,” Tony said.  He stood, crouching down to pick up the crumbled up ball of paper.  “We never are.”  It wasn’t the last word, because Ty had already left, but it made him feel better anyway.  He straightened up, already trying to flatten the pages.  Pepper was peering out the door.  “Is he-”
“I'm a teenager now,” Franklin pointed out.  “And DJ's kind of a teenager, he's my age, and that means we might not want to hang out with little kids, Val.”
Bobbi paused, one cheek bulging with a mouthful of honey soaked pancakes.  She swallowed.  “Studying is important,” she said.
“If you get in trouble, let me know,” Steve said, smiling.  “I've got some pull with the boss.”
Tony smiled back.  “Next time.”  He flicked a salute at his double, and Stark nodded back at him.
“It’s a Christmas movie,” Sam said, balancing his cup of tea on his plate and picking up the pot.  “Egg Rolls?”
Steve's cheeks looked pink in the low light.  “Tony,” he said, and that was definitely a victory.
Sam waited patiently, and Steve exhaled, his breath curling in heavy clouds around his face.  “I realized in trouble when I realized I was fantasizing about…”  He picked up the pace, leaving Sam behind for a few steps.  “Normal life.
“It’s pretty good,” Bobbi said.  “He reworks it every so often; in case the job driving for Mr. Stark doesn’t work out, he figures he can transfer it over to Vaudeville.  His name’d look good in lights, don’t you think?”
Tony blinked.  “Oh, you want to put your head in my lap?”  He grinned.  “Sure, that's fine, just let me-”  He stroked his thumb over the back of Steve's clinging hand.  “Let me do this okay?”
But he was warm.
Steve nodded, leaning over the tray.  “What does he do with it when he's working?”
Tony gave in with something resembling dignity.  "Let's all go," he agreed.
Tony looked at Shiro.  “Both of them are cut off,” he said, folding the sheet of dough over into thirds. He reached for a knife.  “Both.  Nothing more for either of them.”
The girl was standing there, directly in front of him, red light swirling around one upraised hand.  “Your phone’s ringing.”
“We can’t,” Stephen said.  “Something is preventing us from bringing him back.”
For a second, he was frozen in place, everything still, his heart feeling like it had stopped beating in his chest.  Then he scrambled to catch up to her.  "Who were they-"  She looked at him, something like pity in her gaze, and it clicked.  "Tony."
“She did take some time to come around to change,” Jarvis mused.  “But once she did, she embraced it.”  He smiled at Tony.  “Something her son inherited, I would say.”
Ellen sighed.  “I take it back.  That was fifty bucks well spent.”
There was something steady and solid in the words, something stable to the way he said it, that Steve couldn’t quite define.  He’d spent his entire life feeling like he was standing on shifting sand, waiting for the ground to fall out from under him, struggling to find his footing.  Every time he thought he’d find it,  it slipped away from him, knocking him off balance again.
Steve ignored that.  “Where’s the gun Stane gave you?” he asked.  Hammer opened a drawer on his desk, and Steve’s hand tightened on the shield.  “Slowly.”
Strange took a deep breath.  “I’m going to try the research first,” he said.
Tony grinned at him over the rim of his cup.  “Sit. Down.”
He skidded into their small sitting room and came to a dead stop.  Aunt May was already there, her own robe tied tight.  But she wasn’t alone.  Jarvis, looking more ruffled than Peter had ever seen him, was standing just inside the door of the sitting room, clad in neatly pressed pajamas and polished loafers.  He gave Peter a quick smile.  “We know,” he said.  “Happy and Clint have taken some of the hired men down to handle it.  They’ll have it out soon.”
The folded piece of paper from his inner jacket pocket was different, a higher quality of paper, heavy and stiff.  He unfolded it, awareness sweeping over him as he smoothed it flat again.  Their 'marriage license.'
Tony blinked at him, big dark eyes gleaming in the low light. “Hi,” he said, his lips twitching. “We had sex in the car.”
Tony pinched the bridge of his nose. “You're an exhausting human being, you do know that, don't you?” he asked. But Steve was pretty sure he was hiding a smile.
“I am, and-” Steve rocked backwards as Tony stepped, fully clothed, into the bathtub.  Steve’s hands shot up, catching him around the waist as water splashed over the edge of the tub and all over the floor.  Steve lashed out with one foot, bracing them in the tub as Tony’s full weight settled against him.  “Are you out of your mind?”
“No,” Fury and Tony said at once, and they looked at each other with identical expressions of confusion.
"I might be," Steve said.  He rolled to his feet.  "I mean, I'd like to."  He smiled down at Jan.  "Some of my best friends are tiny, tiny women."
“It would be so much easier to marry you,” Jan said.  “You understand me.”
“It seemed appropriate, sir.”
He smiled back.  “I hear good things about your pies.  And your pancakes,” he said, and to his surprise, she reached up, smoothing his hair down.
“In a way.” Tony pointed his fork at DJ, and paused, his train of thought temporarily derailed.  “What…  What are you eating?”
Jan had designed a beautiful little alcove for her custom mistletoe bells.  It was an archway covered in swags of evergreen boughs woven through the polished wood.  Swags of ribbon held the mistletoe in place at the high point of the arch, easily in reach for most, and with a strand of ribbon attached for anyone shorter than average.
DJ blinked down at the pamphlet.  After a long moment, he reached out, taking it from him.  “Thank you.”
DJ’s chin came down, and he blinked at Tony, his expression blank for a moment.  He tipped to the side and looked at the signs that were plastered all over the side hallway, covered in cardboard witch’s hats and cheap costume shop wands.  He looked back at Tony.  “Yes.”
Steve glanced back down at Rhodey. “Thank you, but, no, I’m-” He smiled.  “Not much of a swimmer.”
“No,” she said, with a faint smile.  “But I'm not who they're looking for.”
“Of course I did,” Clint agreed, utterly without shame.  “Look, if you don’t get caught, it never happened.”
“Ass,” Nebula agreed.  “Also, you walked in chanting ‘tramp stamp tramp stamp tramp stamp,’ which, honestly, both rude and a bad idea.”
DJ shifted his weight, and Tony focused on him.  On this child, with his quick, constantly moving fingers, with his swinging feet and his disinterest in the neat stacks of china and rows of silverware set out in front of his chair.  Tony took a deep breath.  “I…  Do not have an answer to that question,” he said at last.
“Yes.  Yes, it is,” Clint said.  He sounded pleased.  He gestured with the box.  “Did they have cat ears?”  She gave him a look, and he nodded.  “Of course they have cat ears.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Well, I'm grateful,” Pepper said.  “And I'm sure that DJ will be glad to have some clothes that fit a bit better.”  She stood.  “Will you stay for dinner?”
“Ah, that-”  Strange nodded.  “That explains quite a bit.”  He looked at DJ.  “I’m glad you found your way back to an old friend, but it’s nearly dinnertime.  Best we get you home before your father notices you’re missing.”
“There’s always the sexy varient.”
“It’s better than what Clint got, I’m sure of that much.”
He had no idea when he’d fallen asleep.  But when he drifted back to consciousness, it was still dark outside; the grand windows that ringed Tony’s bedroom had the curtains drawn, but here and there, there were gaps in the heavy velvet, showing only a hint of moonlight.  Everything was still and quiet, and Steve permitted himself a moment of weakness, of stupidity, studying the lines and planes of Tony’s face as he slept.  That face was rapidly becoming familiar, becoming beloved, in a way that Steve didn’t understand, that he was almost afraid of.
“He was military,” Tony said.
“Try to keep them calm,” Harris said.  He pointed at Drew, who was peeking under the lids of the soup cups.  “Take him with you.”
“Did you want a dress?” Steve asked Tony, a faint smile on his face.
There was another long moment of silence, and then, “No.”
“Don’t forget the turnovers,” Steve said, and Clint laughed.
“But it's implied, when two men enter into these arrangements, and I don't think that there's any harm in wanting to keep certain things private,” Joy replied, her voice sharp.
“I heard,” she said.  “In fact, everyone heard.”   She turned back to the coat rack, setting her handbag neatly on the hook.  “And what, exactly, was that?”
“So I can't promise you that the person who comes for you, the person who finds you, is going to be me.  We both know that's the truth.  There's no promises like that, not right now.”  He tried to smile, and it wasn't his best effort, but it wasn't a lie the way so many of his smiles were.
Bobbi sipped her tea.  “DJ, do you know swear words?”
Tony held it out of reach.  “It has 'Host Club' in the title!” he said, trying not to laugh.  “It-  Steve!  Did a pretty girl sell you on Japanese comic porn?”
“Seriously, it's horrifying and I've already made it clear to Rhodey that I'm going to disown him if he forces us to watch that or that thing with the Heat Miser again, I have nightmares.”  He stared at the base of the tree.  There were a lot of presents there.  Unimportant presents, as they weren't for him or from him.  He nudged a few boxes to the side with his foot.  No one would notice.  “I have seen things, I have seen things and lived through things and Namor alone is reason for two thirds of my nightmares, but no.  What I have to fear when I close my eyes?”
“Don’t you dare,” Tony said.
“Catherine Zeta-Jones,” Darcy said.  Everyone looked at her, and she shrugged.  “Worth a try.”
“No,” DJ said.  Steve pressed a kiss to the top of his head, and DJ’s head tipped back, smiling up at him.  His eyes were red, and Steve ruffled his hair until he laughed.
Instead, he shifted closer, his legs sliding across the fine linen of the sheets as he curled against Tony’s back.  He was warm and solid, the rise and fall of his ribs beneath Steve’s arm comforting.  For the first time, one of these beds, too big and too soft and too foreign, seemed almost comfortable.  Cautious, wary of going too far or doing the wrong thing, Steve moved a little closer, his feet bumping against Tony’s, his face buried in the nape of Tony’s neck.  He let his eyes slide shut, inhaling the scent of Tony’s skin.
Pepper's fingers brushed the line of his jaw, catching his chin and turning Tony's head back towards her.  “Hi,” she said, with a smile.  “Go ask Steve where he lives.”
“He’s not a speed limit, Pep, he barely qualifies as a speedbump,” Tony said, his eyes narrowing at Peter.
Steve braced his hands on the desk, leaning his weight against his palms.  "Bolsheviks," he repeated.  "That's what we're going with, sir?"
“And what do you propose we do when the chokee wakes up?” Natasha asked.  “Because he will wake up.  And likely remember being choked.”
“Sir?” Jarvis said.
“It’s one per person, or…”
“Yes?” he said, because Rogers seemed to be waiting for a response.  Rogers stared at him, his face incredulous.  Tony huffed out a breath.  “Do you have a problem with the room?” he asked, maintaining a polite tone with a force of will.  “It's the best guest room we have.”
“Are you sure you know where Strange is?” Clint clarified from the driver’s seat.  They accelerated through the streets, and DJ’s heels dug into the floor of the car.
“No, you wouldn’t have,” Jarvis said.
Steve watched the second hand tick its way around the clock face, smooth and even.  “No,” he said, without even looking up.  Bucky muttered something under his breath, and Steve struggled to keep a straight face.  He snapped the watch shut and slipped it back into his pocket, letting his hand rest there on top of it for a moment.  “The two of you are going to be friends if it kills you both.”
Steve nodded, and reached for the shield.  It was lighter than anything he’d ever handled, and he ran his fingertips across the surface, feeling the absolute perfection of the design, of the execution.  He shifted it over his arm, and then, onto his back.  It settled there as if it had been made for him, which, he supposed that it had.  But the moment it fell into place, the weight a fraction of what his body remembered, something relaxed, deep in his chest.
“He is exceptionally clever at bypassing your child safety measures,” Jarvis said.
The lights flared and he blinked hard, trying to clear his vision.  Squinting against the sudden glare, he found himself in a narrow stone stairwell that ended at a door just ahead of him.  In just a few steps, he reached the door, pushing it open with one cautious hand.
He straightened up.  “That,” he said, his voice soft, his head tipping towards Rogers, who was staring at the room, his face curious, “is entirely your fault.”
Jan’s chin came up, her mouth a hard line.  “I’m not stealing from anyone,” she said, biting off the words.  “That workshop has been in my family for three generations now, since it was little more than a shop on the corner, my great-grandmother built it from nothing, and my grandmother improved it, and it’s not the fault of either of them that my mother has neither a head for business or a head for fashion, and now we’re beholden to that, that-”  She stopped, her her jaw working.  “It’s my designs that’s kept it running for the last five years, and-”
"Less than an hour." He opened his mouth, and she headed him off. "And you're only hearing about it now because I'm only hearing about it now. I don't know when it was set up, but everyone involved played it very close to the vest.”
“Fine.  Someone.  Call.  The police.”
"He needs a peer group," Sue said.  "He needs friends."  Tony made a face, and Sue leaned over, trying to catch his eye.  "Tell me he has friends, Tony."
“I’m not part of this,” Bruce said, his voice tense.  “Just as a reminder.  I-” He held up a hand.  “I am not a part of this.”
“You fucking should be.”  Tony looked back over his shoulder at Steve.  His eyes were half closed, his jaw set, his face expressionless.  Tony twisted around in his embrace, knowing better than to try to pull away right now. “You all right?” he asked, his voice quiet.
Tony smiled at him.  It didn’t quite reach his eyes.  “Of course I did.”
Natasha glanced in his direction, her spoon never slowing.  “This is almost enough to replace the pies you ate yesterday,” she said, considering the fruit.
“I've heard that about you,” Clint said.  The medic backed off, and he lowered his arm back with a wince, and a mumble of thanks.  “I can't help but think that your proportional response was a long time in coming.”  His head rocked to the side, eyes sharp.  “And so was your contact with SHIELD.  Almost like you were waiting for something.  Or someone.”  He smiled.  “But not us.”
"Perish the thought, Officer Rogers.  I am merely wondering how you survived life in this city, let alone a war," Tony managed, his shoulders shaking.  "Since your natural response to seeing a granade bounce across the landscape is apparently to think, 'well, I'll be damned if I let the other fella get to that before I do.'"
Tony’s fingers rattled against the crystal front of the arc reactor.  “Where’s ‘have a nervous breakdown’ on that list?” he asked, his head tipping in her direction.  “First?  Because I'd put that first on the list.”
“I was promised world saving,” Clint said, balancing an apple on his head.  “I was promised minimal jail time and maximum amounts of saving the world.  And now I’m just sitting in a kitchen in the small hours of the morning, wondering if we have enough bacon for breakfast and hoping that the boss’s latest squeeze isn’t going to go straight to police before I have a chance to cook it.”  He paused, the apple wobbling on his head.  “Which is pretty likely.  Because he is the police.”
"Nope." Steve tossed the bags into the dumpster, one after the other.  Clean-up had gone well, for once, and if Sam was with him, he'd look less pathetic if caught hanging around TOBRU's back door like a damn groupie.  “Just give me that bag.”
Tony opened his mouth.  Closed it. “I’d argue that point, but right now, Pep, you should be pleased I’m not climbing him like a tree.”
“I don't yell, Hawkeye,” Phil said, and that was his 'we'll discuss this later' voice.  Clint hated that voice.  “You ready to get out of there?”
“He’d do it just for the blackmail pictures, and you know it,” Pepper said.
“Thatta girl,” Jessica said, wrapping her hands.  “Let us know if you need help with that.”
Laughing, Steve headed to the door.  He paused, hand on the doorknob, staring down at himself for just a second.  Barefoot, wearing what was clearly yesterday's pants and a white undershirt, he was wasn't exactly presentable, but he was pretty sure the room service waiter had seen worse.
“Yep,” Wanda said.
“Hungover,” Rhodes said, grinning.
“Right.”  Steve wrapped an arm around Tony's waist and steered him towards the stairs.  “Let's go.  Try not to fall down the stairs.”
Rhodey glanced from Nebula to Tony and back.  “Is the yelling over?” he asked, as Clint made hurt noises in Nebula’s direction.
There was a lantern hanging next to the door, and he set his toolbox down before he reached for it.  There was somewhere else he could go, and suddenly, he wanted to.
"Bigger question is, what next? How do we fix your son?" Logan wanted to know. Frigga was clearly doing alright if not great, and Logan wasn't interested in waiting around until someone noticed they were there.
"We don't need two cases for them to deal with," Clint said, voice firm, in mission-mode. He was compartmentalizing.
Natasha's gaze narrowed, but there was no venom in her expression. It was back to something closer to their usual banter. She still kept her eyes on Bruce, but the man looked a lot less likely to break any of them over the conference table.
With his own odd sense of chivalry, Tony couldn't help but try and calm Steve down. "Sure he would've. I mean, she's kinda Barton's thing, right? I mean, as much as she is anyone's. The whole affair thing and cheating sensat-"
Tony watched Steve in the bedroom mirror as he changed into a T-shirt himself and tugged on a pair of sleep pants. He wasn't planning on going out again, and if he was going to be entertaining tonight, he wanted to feel comfortable. "Well, I'm not exactly one for sharing my personal space," Tony replied, noting how paradoxical that sounded now that he'd given Steve his clothes. "I'm sure you'll see me around there from time to time." Turning, his gaze lingered on the other man. Tony could not help being impressed with the view. Not only was Steve a perfect physical specimen, he was so handsome it was almost painful to look at him. For the first time in a long time Tony Stark found himself simultaneously intimidated by and attracted to someone. Feeling a little flustered over the notion, he cleared his throat and steered his guest out of the bedroom. "Those lessons we were talking about?" //Subject change. Nice segue.// "Where would you like to start?"
Logan couldn't help a cocky smirk in response to Scott's appraisal and the following monosyllabic demand. He gladly shrugged the garment off, exposing war-hardened muscle and a solid dusting of chest hair. His fingers cradled Scott's head and pulled him into a hungry kiss as his other hand moved to tug at the buttons of Scott's shirt. Logan succeeded in unbuttoning a couple before his impatient pulling managed to pop one loose. At that, he gave up and tugged harder, dislodging all but the last couple. Just enough to let him shove the garment down to Scott's elbows and expose enough flesh to his eager hands. The man felt as good as he'd looked stripping down for bed the night before. The idea that he was fair game now, the reality that they would finally both get what they'd been wanting, drove a low moan from Logan's throat as he worked Scott's neck with his lips.
"I don't want to concern you when you're being so kind to me, but you may be losing your mind," Loki cautioned with a sober expression. Between Stark listening to him, talking to him, and seeming to actually care about his well being or comfort, Loki had no idea what to do. Anger and fear and derision he understood well. He had defenses built up for all of those things. Stark's concern was something else. It was disconcerting to say the least. "When your friends come, it may be best if you stay here until I've had a chance to try to talk the Brotherhood down. If I can. They have little respect for me, and what loyalty they have to their true leader... they would prefer him back, I believe." Loki tilted his head, looking curiously at Stark. "Have you considered that they will become your enemies if I become your ally?
Natasha wasn't blind to the way the men hovered close to one another. It didn't bother her, precisely, save that it was a reminder that they'd been through something she didn't yet understand. Whatever it was, Loki would pay for it.
"No offense, Thor, but I'm not sure we're up to that just now," Steve agreed gently. As good as it felt being around his teammates, drinking and carousing wasn't something he felt physically capable of it. The pain was too fresh, too raw. He couldn't even get through a single meal without breaking down in tears yet. "I need to talk to Director Fury. You should all relax, do whatever it takes to get you in the game." He paused, gaze sweeping over them all before finally resting on Clint. "Thank you. All of you. We all know this has been a mess from top to bottom, but we're not out of the game yet. He won't get away with it this time."
Tony's eyes widened with genuine fear at the suggestion, and he reached out to grab onto Steve's shoulder, letting go a second later when it occurred that the contact might not be welcome just then. "Don't leave. Please, god, Steve, don't leave," he begged, desperate and scared. "I swear, I thought... I thought I was never gonna see you again and... Oh." He realized suddenly how it looked, him insisting on Loki being spared, on him joining the team. "Steve..." He shook his head, looking almost hurt. "Steve, baby... I didn't bring him here because I wanted to..." He reached out, his hand sliding gently to the side of the blonde's neck as he looked into bright blue eyes. "I love you, Steve. I did something stupid because I was scared and I thought I was as good as dead. Please... forgive me?"
"Eh, I don't know that it's true. I just know Coulson had a collection of Cap cards that he apparently was butthurt about Fury destroying in the name of faking his death. And Stark was sayin' the guy's a big fan." He shrugged. "For all I know, the dude's the most normal one here."
"Like old times. But less with the me wanting to wring your neck," Logan agreed, running his hands over Scott's back and down the tops of his thighs. They slid back up a moment later, his fingertips barely sliding up the legs of Scott's boxer briefs. "I think I like you straddling my lap better, anyway. Lot more fun." He leaned up for another kiss, sighing heavily against Scott's full lips. "You're too damn pretty to kill."
Natasha spared either one of them answering for a moment, "It sound like the best plan we've got. It's a terrible plan. Probably disastrous, but it's a plan." She looked up to Steve, raising an eyebrow. She hated to force him back in charge if he wasn't ready, but he'd never be ready if the team didn't let him take the reins again.
"I'll thank him too, but right now, I'm thanking you. Without you and Agent Fitz, we'd be even worse off than we are. Thank you. This didn't work out the way any of us wanted," Steve added quietly, voice thick, "but we're going to get Loki, and we're going to take him down. I promise."
The agent nodded an affirmative. "It's at least news. In our line of work, information is power as much as anything. The more we know, the better our chances." He didn't bother to add that the more Loki knew, the less what they knew might matter. Time was of the essence, but it was passing at a snail's pace while they did more waiting than acting. None of them handled being benched well, not even Coulson. "I'm going to go linger obtrusively outside of Director Fury's office if you're interested."
"No. I keep it in a far more secure location," May responded without batting an eyelash.
"You don't," Phil countered, "the hammer does. You may be kind of a dick sometimes, Barton, but you're not a psycho." He hoped that a little of their usual banter would help keep Clint's head at least partly in the game. "Right now you're in a bad place." He glanced across at Natasha, and it took only a second of unspoken communication for them to be on the same page. "We're here to make sure you don't stay there. And to make sure you point that," he nodded down at the hammer, "at the right people."
It wasn't hard to fall into the moment with Natasha's curves fitting snugly against him and her lips doing positively sinful things. If he'd experienced even a moment of doubt, the kiss effectively killed them, and Scott leaned into the kiss eagerly.
Logan gave Scott a confident smirk. "Glad t' help," he answered, leaning into Scott's touch a little, his eyes a few shades darker than they had been before. His own pulse was thrumming with the way Scott looked, the way he panted. He touched his lips to Scott's, chastely at first, kissing only briefly before he leaned in again and again, each kiss lingering a little longer and getting a little more intimate. "Tough for me to keep my hands to myself," he murmured against Scott's mouth between kisses. "Kinda just wanna bend you over this bench, decency be damned." He wouldn't, of course, but it didn't mean he didn't have the urge.
Victor smirked at Phil. "I don't remember asking for input," he rumbled, clearly amused. He'd known the two were more than just casual coworkers, but the way Phil was acting... "Since you mean so much to each other, I might just let you take turns."
"Alright, alright. Fine." Tony managed to find some mostly clean clothes to throw on and then took entirely too much time getting his hair put together before he struck out.
"If I can only do this once, I'm not leaving Natasha in pain. She also seems to be the least worse off. Might take less to pull her out." He knew it wasn't the most practical solution, but he couldn't let someone who'd fought beside him so many times suffer if he could stop it. "Then Logan." Then, if he couldn't take anymore, Logan could help Scott. "It'll be fine," he assured Tony before stealing another kiss. "I love you."
"Fine, but this better blow my mind." Logan handed over the money. He'd have gladly thrown them everything SHIELD had given him, of course, but he knew it would be too obvious if he didn't haggle a bit.
"Tony, I'm not so sure-"
"You dinner, gentlemen. And the wine is on us," he said.
"How about we survive the world nearly ending, and then we build a blanket fort and don't come out of it for a month or two? I can think of a lot of things we could do locked up and surrounded by nothing but pillows and blankets." A few of them weren't even pornographic, but only a few. Phil let a hand slide up to carefully massage the knots out of Clint's neck and shoulders. "Just do me a favor and stay out of the line of fire. I got the impression the out of towner's not really happy with either one of us."
Coulson addressed Tony at once. "Would you like me to help you get back to the room?"
"But we aren't sure." Steve watched the needle go in without flinching and let himself believe for a moment that it might really work. It hadn't come in time for him to step in and save Tony, but maybe it would be in time for him to save Clint and Coulson. "Thank you."
The offer surprised Steve enough that he almost missed a step, but he nodded instead. "Thank you." Since Scott joined the team, Logan had kept things carefully friendly, but it was impossible not to hear something more behind the question. He shook it off and hurried on his way, sure he was reading too much into the whole exchange.
Clint squatted as the ducks waddled up the shore, laughing softly as the birds shook water from their tail feathers and quacked demands for the food he was holding. He tossed a few pieces at a time, urging them to share. Glancing back over his shoulder at Coulson, he shrugged, looking faintly insecure. "Sometimes I meditate," he admitted, almost sheepishly. One of the ducks tugged at his pant leg, and he turned his attention back to the birds, tossing more food their way.
There weren't many people who were willing to try deep throating him. There were even fewer people who would try it on the first go in such an unorthodox situation. Which all somehow made it glaringly obvious that of course Clint Barton was going for it. Phil cursed under his breath and breathed in heavily to keep from thrusting. He wanted to encourage Clint's efforts, not hinder them. He couldn't look away from the sight of Clint sucking him off. It was easily the hottest thing he had ever seen in his life. "God, Clint, that... that's perfect..."
Steve offered the other man a warm smile despite the fact that he'd somehow ended up Tony's bellhop again. "Follow me. We'll have you set up in no time." Without really giving Logan a chance to refuse, Steve led the way to the elevator. It was spacious enough for all of them to fit with room to spare on the way down, though Phil remained behind to go down to the meeting rooms while Steve, Logan and Tony disembarked to get comfortable. "There's an open suite down the hall from mine if that's alright."
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
"Can do." Scott looked over Coulson's shoulder to offer Logan a smile and an arched eyebrow. "I'm feeling pretty popular right about now."
The sounds Steve made as he came and the heat of his release gushing over Tony's fingers was more than enough to push him over the edge. Tony's throaty moans filled the room as he spilled himself generously inside his lover, his hand keeping a deathgrip on the couch. The last few tremors of orgasm ripped through him before he finally drew away, grabbing Steve by the waist and dragging him down to lay back in the lush carpet. He pulled the blonde into a slow kiss, then sagged back against the carpet to pant for air. "Not only do I love you, but you are one incredibly hot lay," he managed between gulps of air.
It was categorically impossible not to get turned on by Clint Barton and that tone of voice. "Well, if just the thought of me making you jealous makes you sound like that? Yes, I absolutely want to make you jealous," Phil agreed before he smiled and tucked into his breakfast. Winding Clint up was fun. Knowing that not only was he winding him up, they actually had a chance to see the thing through turned him on to no end. "If you don't want to get jumped on the island before lunch, we should probably start talking about something PG for awhile."
"Lunch would be fine." He didn't want to, but Phil was right. Clint kept his hands to himself as well. It was less a matter of self consciousness and more a matter of his disinterest in explaining things to Thor or getting a boisterous celebration hug crushed into his stitched up back. Instead, the archer pressed himself in as close as he could to Phil, making sure that he brushed against the man frequently as they walked. It was all he could do to not try and press his head to Coulson's shoulder as they moved.
Tony considered a moment, his hands trailing over Loki's body. Finally, as his thumb moved up to circle one of Loki's nipples, Tony looked up into bright blue eyes, his own heavily hooded as he took in the sight of his lover, hard and ready above him. "Fuck me," he decided, shifting anxiously. "I need to feel you inside me."
"Unless they're just really interested in your car tonight." They could take as many shots of the getaway as they wanted, but Steve preferred to have his meals in private. It was one thing to have a kid come up and ask for an autograph every now and then and another to be stalked by the paparazzi. Looking around, Steve took in the charming atmosphere and smiled. Tony had picked a place less lavish than his normal, and he appreciated it. "Maybe I'll just get to enjoy playing some good old-fashioned footsie with you, then."
In which the team finally talks, and Phil tries to get some answers.
Clint was pretty sure he was going insane, pretty sure the hammer had done something to him. Tony Stark was telling someone he had feelings for them, and moreover looked a bit like he wanted to cry as he settled defeatedly into his wheelchair. Not to mention, Clint still really wanted to try out the gun, and he knew that wasn't a normal urge, considering what it would do to him. "Coulson," he said, staring hard at the gun and gulping. "If I reach for that thing, hit me on the head with something big. Like Bruce." He edged a little closer to his handler as if doing so might protect him from the impulses.
Clint rolled his eyes in frustration. "How about where the fuck is he, for starters? What aren't you telling us?" Clint growled, at the end of his patience and deference to authority.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Logan howled in pain as the force of the shot bore him into the wall, lancing him through with acid. He tore at the wound like a wild animal, trying to extract the shaft. The carbon nanotube structure wouldn't give, though, and Logan gasped in pain, compromised lungs gurgling as he struggled to draw breath.
In that moment, Phil found himself vacillating wildly between appreciating Clint's honesty and hating that it was an established fact that Clint loved someone else. It was one thing thinking it and another thing hearing it, apparently. He took the cup and poured them each some coffee to cover for the fact that he was buying time to think. He could feel the shred of hope that he'd been clinging to slipping away and finally had to let it go. "I think that maybe... that maybe as long as you're in love with someone and the guys you're with are there to kill time, it doesn't matter all that much what I want." It wasn't a cop out so much as a last ditch attempt to protect himself. He'd given away too much as it was, and Coulson couldn't bring himself to give away how much he cared when he knew it couldn't change anything. "That doesn't mean you can't still be here for coffee or to crash on the couch or that we can't feed the ducks, but I think that until something bigger changes, that's all I have to give."
It was perhaps the most adorable thing he'd ever been asked. That Clint Barton, master marksman, was the one asking only made it more precious. Coulson couldn't help smiling as he agreed, "That sounds really nice." He hadn't fed the ducks since he was a kid, and the pure joy on Clint's face made warmth bloom inside him in a way that was miles from appropriate. The ducks spotted them coming a mile away and were soon quacking their way up onto shore to get a shot at the goods. "So is this how Clint Barton spends his afternoons off?"
Normally he would have protested, but he was technically off the clock - as much as anyone ever managed to be in the tower - and ready to relax. Besides, Clint hadn’t exactly asked before dumping it into the coffee, and he wasn’t about to waste the precious caffeine after such a strange day. “Thank you.” Coulson leaned back against the counter and watched as Clint sipped the drink. It was rare to have a moment of peace and quiet. “If you’re shadowing me, should I assume that Agent Romanov is following Stark?”
Bucky perked up at the sound of that. "I could definitely use a sedative; a powerful one, if at all possible," he enthused. Sleep had proved to be an elusive beast, and in the rare moments when he drifted off, his slumber was far from restful thanks to horrible dreams. He believed that if he could manage several hours of uninterrupted sleep, he would feel a lot better. "I haven't slept much," Bucky confided in Coulson. "The strange thing is, I don't feel tired."
Tony frowned inside his helmet. Things were already going south. He knew that talking Bruce out of chasing that irritating little shit with the grin wasn't likely to work. "Got it. Make sure they count."
Logan frowned at the phone. "He's alive. But the serum's out," he said. He didn't know exactly what that meant, but he knew enough about Steve to know that it meant the man had at least temporarily lost his powers. He tapped out an acknowledgment to Coulson, then set the phone aside once more. "Stark's with him." He frowned. He couldn't imagine losing his abilities. It had to be even harder for Steve considering where the man came from. Grabbing the phone again, Logan sent a request to be notified when they'd be allowed to visit Steve. "Feel like I kinda owe 'im a thank you, at least."
Logan's arm was across Scott's waist, his fingers digging lightly into the man's side as Scott writhed against him and nipping roughly at Scott's neck, marking the man as his own as if to make up for the bruises Barton had left. Logan could still see teeth in the bitemark on Scott's shoulder, and it made him feel that much more possessive. Drawing back, he watched Scott squirm in response to Natasha's attentions, fascinated by the play of pleasure on his lover's face. It wasn't anything he hadn't seen before, but being able to focus purely on Scott's reactions without having to concentrate on what he was doing made it that much more intense. He watched the shift in the curve of his lover's parted lips, the flutter of his tongue and the heaving of his chest for several moments before leaning in again to press their lips together. Logan's own cock was throbbing hard against Scott's thigh, and he couldn't wait until he got to slide into his lover's tight heat.
Thor looked a little disappointed, but mostly he pitied Steve. Clearly, the man was hurting. The god glanced at Sif, then wordlessly gathered his hammer and took his leave, intent on contacting his mother to see if he could gain any helpful information. The Hawk's life - or at least his sanity - depended on it.
Loki flinched at the words and sat up straighter. "I don't need your pity, Stark." Fury swelled inside him. That was what it had come to: pity from the creatures who should have feared him. His gaze strayed down to his skin, and Loki found himself laughing instead. Perhaps he did need the pity. It was better than no one thinking anything of him at all. "What does it say about you that you're the prisoner of someone you can't even bring yourself to truly fear?" He held out a hand. "Come here."
"I don't care what he seemed like," Fury countered, hands flat on his desk. "He was compromised."
"Mmm, the war is rather riveting," Jemma answered in a dry tone before bursting into a smile. "Honestly, I don't think I'll ever really get used to that. I'm not even part of it, and it... well, it's rather jarring. I think I prefer the camaraderie bit." She offered him a shy smile, "That's been rather pleasant." She sipped at her hot chocolate to hide a rising blush. She'd actually been rather popular at the academy, but that didn't change the fact that Jemma inevitably felt uncertain when getting to know anyone knew. In part that came from the comfort of always having Fitz as a counterpart. She didn’t often need anyone else and thus had only had to venture out of her comfort zone when she really wanted to for one reason or another. "I'm glad that you allowed yourself to be persuaded away from... where were you?"
"Can't say I didn't warn you." It was awful to admit even to himself but Steve half hoped things would stay status quo for an afternoon so he had the luxury to simply be there for Tony. There were distinct downsides to being Captain America. "For now I'm all yours. Consider it your early birthday present."
Clint quirked a faint smile in response. He wondered silently to himself what condition they'd get their teammates back in, but tried not to think about it too much. He took a long drink of his beer and sighed. "I do still owe him an arrow in the eyeball." He glanced at Coulson. "I guess you owe him a lot more." He didn't know for certain what had happened to Coulson. He knew that Loki had apparently killed the man, knew that they'd all been at his funeral. Then, suddenly, he was alive and kicking again. Back from a "vacation."
"If we could just grab the blasted thing and-"
Surprised by the admission and the implication that Logan would have come looking for him if he'd known, Scott watched him warily for a moment before sighing. "No one knew. I'd imagine that the Professor saw something with Cerebro to start them looking. They weren't expecting me back. Still aren't." He laughed bitterly. "Kind of pathetic. The first time I strike off on my own, I get kidnapped. Maybe you weren't too far off about me in the first place." Scott sighed again, too tired to think about it anymore. "Call them. Have somebody bring a car or a helicopter or whatever. If I'm going to get interrogated, I'd just as soon get it over with."
“He will.” Steve didn’t note that it would have as much to do with duty as anything, but it didn’t really matter. The truth was that Coulson was a good guy. He’d made it clear in their conversations that while he didn’t like any part of what had happened, he also didn’t hold Bucky personally responsible. That was a bit leg up over most everyone else. Steve supposed it had a lot to do with the man’s affinity for all the strange tales surrounding their mutual heroics in the war. “Rest. Relax. Maybe do some reading. Lately I feel like no matter how fast I take things in, I’m never gonna catch up.” Steve couldn’t help pausing to give Bucky’s hand a warm squeeze. “I’ll see you back at the suite. Not leaving you here long enough for you to get used to the smell of industrial cleaner.” He drew away only because he knew if he didn’t get on it, he’d never be ready for his date. It was a big chance, a big step forward, and Steve didn’t want to mess it up.
"I'm not sure I can get used to him sober," Logan muttered, glancing at Stark. "Don't think I wanna see 'im drunk."
Natasha stuck with her usual - vodka on the rocks. She didn't see the point in disguising alcohol as something fruity and sweet when it wasn't. It was some variation of beer all down the line otherwise. "I'm not sure if you're pacing yourselves or if I'm the only one who's got any balls."
"Of course, Sir. I'll have something ordered in once things are settled."
Hank, mindful of the potential for damage such things represented, moved to crouch near Coulson. "Agent Coulson, perhaps I'm overthinking this, but... is it really wise to have him... smash things in here?" he asked with the same level calm as someone asking 'one lump or two?'
Logan stretched and nodded, his neck and back popping in a few places. He followed Scott into the bathroom, giving the other man's ass a slap and enjoying the view on offer when Scott bent to adjust the water. "You look good when you cum," he remarked, leaning against the wall and grinning shamelessly.
Steve beamed at the idea. Fighting alongside Bucky would go a long way toward healing the strangeness of it all. His smile faltered as he thought of what the team might think of it. What Tony might think. “We’ll see. I’d like that,” Steve added hurriedly. “It’s not my call alone. We’re a team. Of course, we’re not much of one while Tony isn’t speaking to me.” He knew the words sounded petulant and stupid, but Bucky had seen him lower than anyone else still living. Unlike most of the Avengers, Steve knew Bucky could see him at his worst as well as his best and still have some respect for him the next day. “I’m not sure how to make him stop hiding.”
Logan was even less graceful about it, staring openly and opening his mouth to ask what the hell had happened - he hadn't bothered to read the file he'd been sent - but Nick Fury was mercifully sitting next to him, and even more mercifully applied a steel-toed boot to Logan's adamantium shin-bone before he could say something profoundly idiotic. The mutant grunted and kept his mouth shut.
Another sharp knock and a sharper reminder to get out of the room interrupted Tony. He sighed. "...give you a pat on the back," he finished, his voice raised for their unwanted audience. "Remind me to buy Coulson a month-long vacation to Antarctica."
Bruce frowned, nodding his head. "I see what you mean." He tapped at the screen, looked at his tablet, adjusted some numbers, and frowned again. He ran his first adjustment through the simulator and winced when the reaction went a direction that was all too familiar. "No," he said shakily, erasing the attempt with a swipe of his hand. "We don't need two of me." He gnawed on his lower lip, poking and prodding at the formula. "One of you better bring me coffee. This could take awhile."
Nat let out a sigh. She heard a sound from the room and finally looked up. Her eyes locked with Darien's, and she smiled slowly. "He's very, very good, isn't he?" It wasn't worth asking about what Clint had done for Darien. She knew. She knew precisely how the man was with his other lovers, how he treated them and the walls he built around himself. Though she and Clint were lovers in a less than romantic sense of the word, Natasha felt pride in how deeply he let her in. Whatever else she thought about Clint, he was without question her own closest friend and confidante. She slid her fingers into Clint's hair. "Enjoy the show. We don't give out many tickets."
Scott knew he couldn't keep what he was thinking from Logan forever, not when the man knew him so well. They might not have been friends all along, but maybe even because of that, they'd watched one another closely. Scott held out his arm. The bruises on his wrist were darker than they'd been earlier that day, easily visible against his skin. "Agent Coulson didn't do this to me," he pointed out in the steadiest tone he could manage. "Are you sure there isn't anything wrong?"
May considered dragging the fight out, but she could see the wisdom of retreat as well. "Barton," she snapped when Clint wasn't immediately in line to exit the room.
Humans were really quite easy. He felt foolish for overestimating them so thoroughly the first time around. All out war was well and good for fools like his brother, but Loki had more refined means of getting beneath the skin of his enemies. He chuckled to himself. If he had only taken a few simple steps, he could have avoided a great deal of time under Thor's thumb and the embarrassment of that first defeat. Well, the Chitauri's defeat, really.
Tony nearly lost his mind when Steve's already tight passage squeezed him as the blonde came. Tony's back arched as he followed his lover into orgasm, his hips slamming forward hard as he let out a raw cry of pleasure. There was no restraint, no reserve to the sound, nothing but unfettered pleasure. After a moment, Tony's muscles unclenched, and he sagged a little on shaking arms, looking down at his lover as sweat trailed down his face. "Jesus... Jesus, that was good..." he panted.
"It would be amazing!" Fitz exclaimed only to quail slightly at the looks the other three fixed on him. "Scientifically, I mean. It would be... it would be fascinating scientifically."
Scott all but screamed his lover's name as he came over the comforter. His ass clenched hard around Logan's cock. He forced his eyes open at the sound of Natasha crying out as well. He'd beat her by only a few seconds. While Logan continued to thrust into his over-sensitive body, Scott watched as she arched off the bed and moaned her release for the second time that night.
"And here I thought I looked great for my age," Steve muttered, though he nodded. Maybe knowing who he was and where he came from would make some headway to Logan not looking at him like he was the enemy. "Tony mentioned that his father Howard helped in the creation of the serum that made me look like this, gave me enhanced metabolism and reflexes, all that. What he didn't mention is that Howard did it during World War II. I'd been rejected from service, uh, a few times. I was too small, I had asthma, I was everything nobody wanted in a soldier except that I wanted to be there. I wanted to serve my country. I wanted to do my part. Eventually somebody helped me along on the condition that I help them too. So, yeah, I agreed to be a guinea pig, and I don't regret it. The only problem is I ended the war presumed dead and frozen in a block of ice. I didn't get thawed until last year, so I'm still getting used to things."
Sif threw back her shoulders and met the golden eyes of Heimdall without flinching. "I seek passage to Midgard."
Tony heaved a long-suffering sigh and rolled his eyes. "Magnets won't erase my hard drive. Or the rest of me. And speaking of self-healing, I need someone with bio-whosit knowledge to figure out a way to make sure these nanobots can put me back together in the event of an accident or me being forced to play with guns that want to kill me. Bruce?"
"It's a delicate situation," Coulson answered. "May I come in?" He moved past the man without waiting for an answer and opened the other file folder he held. "For quite awhile, we've had our eye on a growing portion of the slave trade in this country and abroad. We've managed to close off a few avenues for them, try to keep things out of the States, but I'm sure you know that even special agencies have their limits. Mr. Summers disappeared suddenly and without warning. He had gone out for a ride alone on his motorcycle, and no one has seen him since - or at least reported seeing him. Unfortunately matters are complicated because this group," he tapped the folder, "has also been active in the area of New York where he went missing. To be blunt, we think that if he's still alive, he's probably been sold to someone who deals in... exotics."
The girl behind the counter began scanning the whole mess, listless and barely paying attention, but perked up slightly when she took in her customers, especially Steve. "Hey... hey, you're that superhero guy, right?"
Loki met his gaze as evenly as he dared without it seeming like a challenge. "My 'angle,' as you put it, is that I have nowhere to go. It is no surprise to you that I have worn out any welcomes that have been offered to me. I have no home on Asgard save in a cell, and I have no wish to spend the rest of my existence barely living." He dared to look at Tony only for a moment before he shifted his gaze to Fury. "Mr. Stark felt that if I were able to prove myself that, perhaps in time... that I could be of help here." The words felt strange on his tongue, but not entirely wrong. "I realize there is no way to make amends, but I can help. I would... like to help."
Steve found himself torn between laughing and crying. “Are you... how are you feeling?” The man sounded shockingly normal given everything that had happened. He sounded utterly and completely like the man Steve knew.
Tony pelted at Loki with his own attacks, though he soon found himself struggling to keep other Brotherhood members from interfering with their tactics. "Third time's a charm, Wolvey, baby."
Clint nodded, still scanning for something that would make a decent shelter. "We need to find a place to hunker down until nightfall. You're not supposed to move through the desert in daylight," he pointed out. It had been awhile since he'd been left with absolutely no backup to speak of and had to fend for himself, but he still remembered his training. He gave Phil's hand a squeeze. "I don't think either of us need a tan." He finally sighted a rock jutting out of the ground with a bit of a cave like recess. "Here we go." He let go of Phil's hand long enough to make sure the thing was free of any hungry, angry wildlife before settling under it. It was a good bit cooler than the direct sunlight. He patted the ground next to him. "Have a seat. We've got some time to kill."
"It's fine. Do what you need to do. It's a stress reliever that doesn't involve breaking the no drinking pact with Fury or getting yourself hurt. It's not a bad one." He couldn't deny that he'd prefer to never run into Clint in quite that situation again, but he was grateful at the same time for the man having an outlet. "I'd just rather not let too much of it play out again in my head. No offense."
"I am not losing more assets today," Fury snapped. "Get your ass back over here." His gaze shifted to Coulson as Clint grudgingly complied. "Agent Coulson, you've interacted with these two the most. I need recommendations. How do we confront these two without them going through half of our security forces?"
"I just woke up," Logan pointed out, pulling Scott close to him. He tugged the man over to the couch, dragging him close and holding him tight, his hands sliding up the back of Scott's shirt to make sure he contacted skin. Stark getting killed was making it hard to want to do anything but take every moment he could get with his lover and hold onto it for dear life. "I think I need... we need to do a lot o' touchin' right now." He didn't care if it was chaste or sensual; Logan just wanted his hands on Scott and vice versa.
Scott laughed and nipped at her thigh. "Not likely. But he might be nice enough to share every now and then." He rose and kissed Logan over Natasha's shoulder to share the taste of her with the other man and enjoy the heat of her soft body stretched out between them. His own denim-clad erection ground teasingly against her most sensitive areas and left Scott gasping into Logan's mouth.
Victor chuckled, a chilling sound. "You don't get to manipulate me, suit. I'm in control here," he rumbled, using thumb and forefinger claws to snap the button off of Phil's slacks and then hooking his finger over the zipper to push it down. He leaned most of his weight against Phil, pressing him hard into the cold wall. His breath puffed harder against Phil's neck, his cock beginning to press against his captive's ass. Tangling a clawed hand in Phil's hair, he tugged the man's head to the side and bit hard into the join between his neck and shoulder. He wanted to make sure that, when he finally left the two alone for awhile, the archer had something to remind him quite specifically of who had been using Coulson.
It was an odd thing waking up to the feeling of someone's cock pressing into him, but it was really, really fucking nice. Phil made a soft sound of approval and made a point of grinding himself back into Clint's body. He wasn't necessarily trying to start something, just enjoying the luxury. "Definitely a good morning," he managed before turning to get a look at Clint, hair mussed with a lazy smile on his lips. God that was good. "So do I really get to keep you?"
“A little,” he said, because he didn't want to try to explain it to Franklin.
The man was huge, towering over Jarvis, and almost twice as wide at the shoulder.  His blond hair was tied back at the name of his neck, leaving strands trailing over his forehead and around his face, and his beautifully tailored suit was just as disordered, the shirt open at the neck and the jacket unbuttoned.  But he as grinning, wide and real, his eyes dancing.  "Ah!"  He clapped Jarvis on the shoulder.  "My friend, how I've missed you and your wit."
She straightened up.  “Sorry, were you saying something?” she asked Tony.
“No,” Darcy said, and the girl who had given him the tape hovered behind her, a pained look on her face.  She was wearing an oversized medic’s bag and carrying a sign that said ‘Emergency Cosplay Repairs.’
Tony paused, frowning down at the empty spot on the workbench.  He pushed his stool back, one foot braced against the edge of the bench, to check the floor.  Nothing.  He lifted up the edge of the plans, the paper fluttering back to the bench as he released them, and shifted the plates of metal he’d been working on out of the way.  Nothing.
“I refused him entry because you asked it of me, and I was also wary of his intentions,” Jarvis said.  “But I would not have had the capability to do so, had you not asked it of me.”
“He's not,” Stark told her.
Everything was pain.
Jan grinned.  "Trust me, she can handle it."  She bounced along next to Tony, her feet barely touching the ground.  "Carol and Thor are still on site?"
“So did we, and you ruined it, because here is my idiot of a brother, charmed into stripping down to his waist and trying to HELP you,” Shuri said.  She looked at Bucky.  “The two of them.  Covered in clay and mud and dung and whatever else they can try to make this thing into less than what it is, which, I remind you, is a hole in the ground with a mud lump put half over it.
“It has, yes, doesn’t mean it’s a good one.” Tony folded his hands on his stomach.  “Your job is terrible.”
“We're not-”
There was a beat of silence, and then Jarvis said, “You have to do this, sir.”
Behind him, Steve was silent, and Tony shifted, twisting in his arms.  “Me, they just wanted to sleep with.”  He grinned.  “Bit different.”
All of the strain went out of Steve’s shoulders.   “Yes.”  Strange threw his hands in the air, frustration written across his face and Steve repeated, “Yes.  Yes, I think that is-  That’s what he needs, Stephen.  He has to know we’re always going to come for him.”
"Or he's a mortal man and your life is beyond his comprehension," Steve said, just to make him laugh again. It worked, and he stifled an irrational sense of pride. “Why did you even bother humoring him?” he asked. “You don't seem the sort to suffer fools gladly.”
Tony turned, looking down as Obie came striding across the main hall, his hands held out in front of him.  He beamed up at Tony, his eyes crinkling at the edges.  "Look at you!" he boomed, and Tony caught himself smiling.
DJ thought about that.  “Company,” he said, smiling at her, because he could say that he was tired, that he was overwhelmed, and she wouldn't be hurt by it.  “Please.”
Iron Man stared at him.  “As a couple’s therapist, I’d say he’s more likely to take your side,” he said to Rogers.  “Which is wrong on a couple of levels, honestly.”
“Excellent!” Tony said.  He paused, and dug under the pillow, his face scrunching up as he made a grab for something.  A moment later, he dragged Steve's wrinkled dress shirt out.  It dangled limply from his hand.  “I was quite drunk, wasn’t I?”
“Right, yeah, I meant, how it looks as a-” Rhodey rubbed the back of his neck.  “How it looks as a gesture, Steve.  I think Tony sees is as a very ‘first serious college relationship’ kind of a thing.  You fall head over heels in love and next thing you know, you’ve got someone’s name on your ass, and that’s-  That’s something the other person may not like, or may like a little too much, you know?
Tony offered him a hand. “You, sir, are a man of class and breeding.” Laughing, Victor shook it.
“In a manner of speaking,” Clea said.  He heard her walk around the workbench.  “Stephen, for all his pride, is mortal.  And this is taking a toll on him.”  There was a scrape of metal against stone, and Tony did not turn around.  “He knows better than to burn the last of his strength out of spite.  DJ might need more from him than your Captain does.”
“Three minutes,” Darcy said.
DJ shook his head, then nodded.  “Maybe,” he admitted.  “Don't know.”
"Everything okay?" he said, his voice quiet, almost lost under the noise from the crowd.
“The solarium, right.”  Steve gave DJ’s face a quick once over with the damp towel, then his hands.  DJ stood there, accepting it with his usual stoicism.  “To make sure that the ones that were sick didn’t spread it to the others?”
“I am an emotionally supportive boyfriend who loves you and so I encourage you in any and all things you choose to do to come to terms with the hectic and unhealthy world we live in,” Drew said, his voice breezy.  “But darling.  I do know about the five pound bag of Rollos you’ve got shoved in the back of your sock drawer.”
Tony frowned.  “What-”
“Did that cat just…  Wander in from the casino?” Harris asked, watching as the cat picked its way across the table, pausing a brief moment before hopping onto Agatha’s shoulder.  “Is…  Is that something that just happened?”
“Did you take him?” Clint asked, his head swinging between Agatha and Wanda.  “You took him.”
“And someday, when you’re stronger, when Dr. Essex thinks your heart's strong enough, when those... “  Obie made a face.  “Attacks of yours stop, then there will be a place at the University for you.  I’ve made sure of it.”
He skidded to a stop, the metal scraping across the tile floor, and lay there, gasping for breath.  The HUD was going nuts in front of his face, throwing up data and warnings faster than his spinning head could take them in.  The blare of the alarm inside the helmet mingled with the one outside the armor, and DJ managed to flop onto his back, halfway under a table.
“I thought I came off pretty well in that video,” he said.  “And the rest is my own problem.”
“You hate me.”
"I think that it would be an important statement of support from your friends and family," Jan said, emphasizing the two words with all the zeal of a revivalist preacher.  "And lacking a public show of-"
“You gonna vote for my plan?” Bucky asked him.
“We cannot,” the blonde agreed.  “Like.  I appreciate your help here, but…”  He spread his hands, palms up. “We cannot even try.”
He paused, his head tipped to the side.  “Right.  Yeah.”  He paused.  “I mean.  I’m not saying ‘elope’ but-”
“It could be, if Pepper had more of a sense of humor,” Tony said.  He traded the rice for the chow mein.  “I did have it put on a coat of arms once.”  He grinned around the tips of his chopsticks.  “There were some pretty suggestive lugnuts involved.”
Tony pushed Steve’s hand away.  “All,” he said with a grin.
“And what would that be?” Steve asked.
“You're going to end up with a sack, you know that, right?” Carol asked.
He reached for DJ, for Steve, but he was moving, he was being moved.  He let out a howl, even as the car door opened and he was dragged in, fighting the entire way.
Clint yawned, his face scrunching up with the force of it.  “Fuck you,” he said, rubbing a hand through his hair.  “And anyway-” He stopped, and looked down at his boxers.  His toes wiggled against the carpet.  He looked up.  “Fuck you,” he repeated at last.
“You do realize that the whole hat and hoodie combination does absolutely nothing to hide your identity, right?” Tony asked, and he was proud of himself, he was so proud of himself, because there wasn’t so much as a hint of a tremor to his voice.  He smiled, tight and thin, his gaze level.  “It has fooled exactly no one through the years.”
Phil did his best not to demand that Clint stay the hell away from the hammer. They'd lost a lot, and he hadn't missed the look on Steve's face, the realization of how badly they'd screwed it all up trying to keep Clint away in the first place. He couldn't agree to the plan aloud, though, when all he wanted was to take Clint back to his suite and keep him safe.
Steve groaned and covered his face with his hand.
The archer closed his eyes and leaned into Nat's hand, relishing the praise, before grasping her wrist and placing a kiss on her palm. He kissed his way down the sinuous limb to her collarbone. Looking up at her with hungry eyes, he slowly closed his lips around her nipple, tugging at it lightly with his teeth before he closed his eyes once more and suckled at the hardened flesh. His hips still kept a steady rhythm, though it was getting more and more difficult to refrain from picking up the pace.
"I'm alright. I'm also the only one here." Nat watched Logan's hand hit the glass between them and managed a faint smile. "Apparently he doesn't want us fraternizing. That's fine since I've never found concrete cells to be that much of a turn on." Slowly Nat rose, crouching as she got a feel for their environment and tested whether there were any lasting effects from the flash. "From one zoo to another."
"No more drinks tonight," Steve countered, his arms snaking around Tony's back, and the space between them too small for him to want anything but to give in and kiss the man. "You can have one or the other, Tony. What'll it be?" he asked, voice a husky whisper as Steve fought to keep himself together. If Tony couldn't be bothered to at least treat it as something different from a random hook-up, it would be better to abstain. It would. Probably.
Tony turned, following Clint's gaze.  Hulk was peering after Gyrich, his eyes narrowed into slits.  “We okay, big guy?” Tony asked him, and the sentence was barely out of his mouth when Hulk crouched down and simply leapt away.  Tony stared after him.  “What the hell?  Where is he going?”
“Probably because no one likes to see the face you’re making right now,” Harris said.
“How is this going to finish?” Steve asked.
“Right,” Tony said.  But DJ was still there, grinning up at him, and Tony shook his head.  “I’ll just have to suffer.”  Which,honestly, was starting to sound prophetic.  He managed a smile.  “How about Miss Potts and I meet everyone in the parlor?”
“You told the truth, and telling that truth couldn't result in me getting evicted, getting fired, or putting my life at risk,” Rogers said. “So I don't see the problem.”
The thing that looked like Steve smiled back, just a little, a wry twist to his lips.  “We like to pretend,” he said, and it sounded almost apologetic.  “And I guess you do, too?”
Rhodes paused, one hand braced on his hip.  “Sam says you used to live here?”
He nodded.  “Aye.  You did.”
“Snooping,” Bobbi said.  She pulled one leg up, bracing her arm on her knee.  “With the boss' permission, it seems.”
Tony rocked backwards, breath hissing through his tight throat.  He groped for the chair behind him, and Jarvis got there first, his arm going around Tony’s waist, holding him in place with a firm grip.   “Steady, sir,” he said, his voice calm.  “Steady.”
“He is so unkind to you,” Shuri cooed to the horse.  “Never lets you have a bit of fun.”
“Why did you leave New York?”
Tony opened his mouth.  Closed it.  “I…”  He stopped.  Because that was how it was.  That was the way it had always been.   Since he’d been DJ’s age, and his father had sat at the head of the table.  And he’d learned patience, this room had taught him patience.  He’d learned self-control, listening to the clock tick, listening to his mother’s spoon slide against the side of her tea cup.  He’d learned to count his own breaths, passing time with counting the carved flowers in the ceiling and the stitches in the lace tablecloth, or slowly, carefully peeling the shell away from his soft-boiled egg.  He’d learned to control the nervous energy that poured through him, channeling it into the way his feet flexed against the rung of his chair, safely out of sight under the table.
Steve managed a smile.  “He’s…  A distraction,” he agreed.  He settled back into the couch, trying not to take up too much space.  Natasha moved out of his way, and he gave her an apologetic smile.  “Sorry.”
“But it doesn’t.”  Steve took another bite of the apple slice.
He dropped his presents directly in front of the tree.  They were the biggest and most impressive, after all.  “It's that weird little elf who wants to be a dentist.”
“Maybe,” DJ said.  “But maybe not now.”
“Ain't saying he's always right, but he's got ears everywhere,” Seamus pointed out. “But he said a big, cheerful looking fella came calling yesterday, and made Mr. Hammer quite the offer.”
“All of us.”
Sam ignored him.  "You're still my friend."  He smiled at Steve.  "And your love life is a disaster, but no.  I don't think you did this on purpose."
"Wait, if you disabled the code, or messed with it somehow, and good job, good job there, Tone, letting that happen-" Rhodey started, and Tony flipped him off.  It was half-hearted at best and just won him a grin.  "Why didn't you just-"  Rhodey spread his hands.  "Fix it?  So you didn't get stuck in corners?"
