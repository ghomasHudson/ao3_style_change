“No,” Steve says slowly, a horrible feeling like he was missing a key piece in the puzzle forming in his gut. “I just- are the Commandos not around here anymore?”
“Yeah, we figured. Believe it or not, all you have is a concussion and some bruised ribs; I think the Other Guy realised you weren’t one of the bad guys at the last second and pulled his punch. Sorry about that, by the way. He wasn’t supposed to be out – one of the Hydra guys gave him a shock.”
Steve looks around him, curious and half afraid he’ll make the whole thing fall apart if he touches anything.
Evidently, Tony does know better, because there are no arguments when he boards the quinjet the next morning, just a sharp greeting of “Cap.”
Relief washes over him as the decision is taken out of his hands when Bruce looks behind him, brow furrowing as he takes in Tony’s position on the bed. Bruce moves closer, hands hovering above Tony as he examines his struggling form.
“Do you?” the second voice hisses. Steve can’t be sure, but the man sounds like he’s holding back tears.
Steve gives a sigh of relief, before turning his attention back to Tony, who’s still struggling in his arms.
Steve shakes his head and Tony takes his hand and pulls him toward the airlock, which hisses open as they approach. Steve grabs the gloves and helmet off his seat before being tugged through to the other side.
so an experience is all I have to work with! You’re a very difficult man to buy for.” And Tony has the gall to pout, as if
“Jesus, Steve. You know not everything’s your fault, right? And just because I’m- sad, doesn’t mean you have to take the blame. You hating yourself for something completely out of your control doesn’t make me feel better, weirdly enough.” Tony steps back and Steve allows himself to be tugged back over to the sofa. “Wilson told me weeks ago that I had to tell you, because you had a right to know and you shouldn’t have had to figure it out by yourself. Don’t ever tell him I said this, but he was right. Was I feeling shitty? Yeah, of course; my amazingly perfect soulmate didn’t know who I was anymore, but I still should have manned up and told you, because you deserve that at the very least.”
Before Steve can respond, Tony pushes himself off the chair and moves to a cupboard at the back, where they usually store spare uniforms and weapons. From it, Tony reveals a red and blue spacesuit, complete with a white star emblazoned across the chest. He digs around some more before tugging out a matching helmet and tossing it towards Steve.
He falls asleep that night in an Asgardian palace and opens his eyes to a sight that has him choking on tears.
They hesitate and Tony turns to see anxiety flood through them as they realise they have little choice but to follow. They move cautiously up next to him and look around at the team flanking them, tranqs now held at resting.
he corrects. Just his life. Because Thor is still surrounded by family in arms and citizens who respect him and, if nothing else, will die with him.
Sam grins again, leaning forward in his chair with his palms loosely clasped. His shirt sleeve rides up a little and Steve catches a glimpse of a stark white mark on his lower arm.
“Thor has a point, you know.” And he does, he knows. Natasha continues. “Besides, if Tony was that easy to get rid of, I’d have done it last week when he ate the last of the Belgian chocolate ice cream.”
“I did. Do you-“ he licks his lips and looks away. “I would be honoured – if you would let me stay. Allow me the privilege of fighting beside you again, if only because I have years—”
There’s a beat of silence where Steve wants to berate himself for such naïveté, but a warm English voice replies “Welcome, Captain Rogers,” and Steve has to grip the handle bar to keep himself upright.
“Then I’ll be fine. Tony, I trust you and Natasha, I’ll just do what my fearless leaders tell me to.” He tries for a lopsided smile but judging from Tony’s scowl, it doesn’t land. Instead, he rubs a hand across his face and sighs.
“’Cause it’s true. Might even jog his memory. Even if it doesn’t, at least he knows he has another friend.”
, he knows sometimes friends keep things from each other. Most times, it’s a perfectly acceptable thing to do, however, he hadn’t ever expected something quite this – furry.
He looks up in time to see everyone file back in, feels their hands on him and basks in it. He wants with everything in him to sit and talk with each of them as he has with Tony but he hears a soft “It’s almost time,” and turns to Tony again. He blinks and their world flickers, his eyes shooting to Tony’s, terror and dread filling him again.
Steve isn’t sure why Tony hasn’t told him yet. Sam had told him his soulmate would reveal himself soon, but it’s been almost over a week and still, Tony hasn’t said a word.
And Steve says nothing, just gazes into the brightest star he’s ever known and re-maps the lines of his face and the slant of his nose.
Tony braces himself, repulsors at the ready as the wolf opens its great maw and- does not rip his head off. Tony watches in utter bafflement as the wolf licks a stripe up the faceplate, and seemingly satisfied, pushes itself off the armour and curls up protectively at his feet.
“Nat is terrifying,” Sam laughs. “And whatever you do, do not touch that lady’s Thai leftovers, or you won’t be able to find your peach yoghurt for weeks.”
In turn, he shares stories of the Commandos. They seem modest, silly even, in comparison, yet people still cheer as he recounts their victories and listen in somber silence to their losses.
Steve grips the balcony’s railing. The wind stings his face, but it feels grounding rather than painful as he senses Tony move to stand beside him.
Whatever they are, they look Knotovian. They bear no extra appendages or different markings, as many of the visitors to Knotov have.
Their meetings’ frequency had dwindled over the last number of decades, and Steve hates himself a bit for it, but he envies Thor the grey that’s starting to streak his hair and the wrinkles that now line his face. He resents him for the fact that one day he will join their friends and family and Steve will be left; the last Avenger.
“I was barely gone for the day,” Tony teases, and Steve can hear the fond tone behind the snarking words.
He’s not sure how or why, but he’s been gone nearly seven hundred years and, in that time, his first family have died and faded into legend.
“Tony, I- I need to do this, okay? I can’t keep just sitting around the Tower while you guys go out there and chase after HYDRA. I feel-”
Steve looks deep into warm brown eyes and finds truth and love so he nods, murmurs “I love you” and closes his eyes and breaths.
Once again, Steve travels across land and sea until he arrives home. The waters beneath him are quiet this time, and, when he looks down, he can see the life swimming below him.
Tony sets the jet to autopilot once they’re a couple thousand feet up and turns to him, kicking back to sprawl lazily in the captain’s seat.
Tomorrow , T’ny will bring them in front of the Council and have them detail their story for them. Hopefully the last remaining Terran will be enough to convince them of the danger of this unknown force.
He climbs in next to T’ny and T’ny wraps his arms around his waist and presses his head against the juncture where neck and shoulder meet.
“The mattress,” the man repeats, “It’s like lying on a marshmallow – feels like you’re gonna sink right through to the floor. When I was over there, we used rocks for pillows. Like caveman.”
Tony rubs a hand over his face. Yeah, he feels like shit because his soulmate can’t remember who he was or their last three years together, but Steve didn’t even know who his soulmate was and he was trying to adjust to a whole new century. Objectively speaking, one of them did sort of have it worse. Distantly, he heard his inner Rhodey say something about not dismissing his own feelings, but he ignored it. Steve needed help, and that was something Tony could provide.
Tomorrow, they will face the threat known only as Death, a being who has wiped out hundreds of planets, including Steve’s own.
This time it’s Steve’s turn to laugh, gripping the arms of the Iron Man suit and surrounded by lights that welcome them home.
That evening, Anthony, Tony, and his parents host a banquet. They feast and drink and Steve meets a dizzying array of strange and wonderful people who both intrigue and delight him. He listens, enraptured, to their stories of fantastic creatures and watches as they demonstrate their ability to command nature herself.
Tony doesn’t miss how Steve maintains a steady conversation with almost everyone but him, how he keeps flicking his eyes to him every few minutes, almost like a nervous tick. Eventually, the dishes move from the island to the sink and Bruce complains about how the dishwasher is
“Mad Eye?” Tony calls, eyes on the dark space in front of him, wondering what the hell is about to jump out from it. As quickly and quietly as he can, he starts moving from his place at the island to back away further from the hall, signalling to JARVIS to bring up one of the suits. “You wouldn’t have anything to do with whatever the hell’s happening in my tower, would you?”
When he wakes next, the first thing he registers is a dull pain behind his eyes. That’s all that seems to be left as a reminder of the past few weeks. He runs through the years in his head, relieving moments he hadn’t even known he’d missed and some he wouldn’t have missed so much if he could have, though it still feels like a blessing.
Steve turns and heads towards his room, back straight and strides sure as he wrestles his mind away from thinking the worst. Stuff like this happens to them all the time. It was barely last month when they had all been stranded on the Savage Lands. Still, Steve couldn’t fully settle his heart. What if, what if, what if kept playing in his head – what if this time there was magic involved, something Sam and Bruce weren’t equipped to deal with? What if this time the technology was more advanced, had somehow interwoven itself with Tony’s brain? Or what if this time, for some reason, he simply hadn’t been fast enough, hadn’t been able to stop tragedy from striking?
Steve looks up, startled out of his thoughts. He blinks slowly at the man, trying to comprehend his words.
Maybe he got breakfast with one of them. Bruce tended to be an early riser and a big fan of the matcha pancakes down on 86th.
home – stands in front of him and with unsteady movements he moves through the lobby, to the elevators, and presses the button for the private floors. He’s quiet a moment, overwhelmed, when a thought occurs to him and he looks up, tentative. “JARVIS?”
He manages to set his feelings aside once they land. While Steve had been adamant about joining the Avengers, he wasn’t an idiot either – given his lack of experience with how the team usually operates, he’s something of a liability and he knows it. So, he sticks to Tony and Natasha’s directions. In his defense, the battle itself goes well. It’s after, when they’re rounding up the few Hydra agents in the building that things go FUBAR and he finds himself on the wrong end of the Hulk’s fist.
to get a good night's sleep is starting to rub off on him. As far as he knows, he’s the only one up, his usual night time companion out in SHIELD related business and the rest of the Tower’s occupants asleep on their respective floors. He breathes in the quiet and tries to tell himself it’s peaceful and not eerie. Peaceful.
Steve’s eyes widen in surprise as he bolts up from the sofa, taking the pizza boxes and putting them on the counter. He gathers Tony in his arms.
Steve gives a tight smile. “I’ll leave you two science bros to it. Let us know when you’re finished.”
Near the end of the seventh year, Steve finds himself thinking of the Commandos, of his first home. He feels guilt nip at him for not having visited in all this time and resolves to visit them as soon as he can.
T’ny watches them eye the tranqs warily, and he shakes his head at them. There is no use for them. This Terran is, for now, not a threat and T’ny feels a pang of regret at the careful way they will be treated and monitored until they are officially cleared as such. It is clearly not something they need.
When the outer part of the airlock hisses and Steve floats out, he can almost hear his heart skip a beat. He floats further from the station, enraptured by the sight before him. A belt of stars and twinkling colours surround him, like nothing he has ever seen on Earth. He looks, mesmerised, around him and turns to Tony, who had flown out further from the station and remained hovering in front of him, a red and gold speck among thousands of others.
The group starts out modest, borne from necessity with Steve, Tony, Natalia, Clint, Thor and Bruce. Over the years, however, it evolves, with more and more people emerging to join them until it grows into something bigger than any of them had imagined. It’s good, though. Steve and Tony spend the next six years fighting and mentoring and enjoying their lives together, both on and off the battlefield.
“Since we brought you in here. It’s only been a couple hours, thankfully. I think-” Bruce hesitates a beat before continuing, “I think he was afraid you’d wake up with no memories again, no memories of us, at least. The past couple weeks have been hard.”
Steve lets out a half-strangled laugh as Natasha moved away, down the corridor towards the kitchen. Of course. Natasha was right, and so was Thor. It was just that what he and Tony were doing – it was different. Steve had never been in a serious relationship and Tony had never been in one with someone he actually cared about, so it was new territory for both of them. Steve frowned to himself as he continued onto his room. Much as he didn’t want to fuck this up, he knew now he couldn’t lose sight of everything – and every
“I wrote it down-” he tries before Tony shushes him and pulls him close, guiding his head down to rest on Tony’s shoulder.
He stays like that, feels Tony sink down, too and run gentle hands through his hair, murmuring soft words and pressing softer kisses wherever he can reach.
One of the guards approaches the craft and raps gently on the outside and after a brief pause, T’ny hears something inside the craft hiss and moan before the door opens a to reveal a sliver of light.
“All right, honey,” he mutters before Tony across his shoulder, adjusting his grip as Tony squirms against him.
T’ny looks looks out at the barren space that surrounds his city, squinting out at the curious object that had landed mere hours ago just beyond the border limits.
Tony keeps smiling down at him, because somehow Steve has ended up curled with his head on Tony’s lap.
So. Werewolf. Capwolf? Whatever. Their fine and fearless leader, as it turns out, is both a super soldier and a supernatural creature of the night. Who would’a thunk.
But this is a Terran. It could very well be they do not possess such technologies. T’ny feels something inside himself shift, a swelling of sympathy for this creature who has come to a new planet, alone in the galaxy and unable even to efficiently communicate with those he encounters.
There’s a moment of silence as Fury takes in this new information, mild interest settling across his features. Then he sighs and opens up the files in front of him and starts the most batshit crazy explanation Tony’s ever heard in his life.
It’s late when it happens, maybe one or two in the morning. Tony’s been in the communal kitchen, drinking warm milk instead of coffee because Steve’s bad habit of at least
He doesn’t even know why it’s so hard, although a voice inside him that sounds suspiciously like Pepper says something about “debilitating self-esteem problems” and “trouble accepting that he deserves happiness”.
He hefts the boulder in one hand, readying himself to throw it across the field. He hears the clinks of metal against metal seconds before he feels his foot slip out of the broken stirrup. The boulder slips out of his grip and falls back to the earth with a dull noise and the horse to bolts from under him.
With the Tower empty, Steve finds himself wandering down to Tony’s workshop for the first time since he’s woken up. Tony’s told him he used to sketch down here sometimes. Presumably, he won’t mind him doing the same now.
“I’m not a child!” Steve growls. He starts to unwrap his hands, letting the tape flutter into the trash as he yanks it off his hands.
“And he deserves to have you tell him, instead of hearing it from one of us or having to figure it out himself. If you want, me or one of the others can be there. Moral support and all.”
He hesitates a moment before lifting a hand up and placing it on the Terran’s shoulder. He had heard before that Terrans found comfort in such actions, often even from strangers. The Terran looks at him startled, and for a second T’ny is worried he misjudged, but the Terran says nothing, just keeps marching toward the City of Light.
Later, once the festivities have burned down to embers, Tony takes his hand and they stumble off together, giggling like children. Tony leads him to an ornately carved wooden door, which he pushes open and leads Steve through. They stumble through the room, falling into the softest thing Steve’s ever felt. They’re both gasping for breath in the best way when Tony turns to him, an edge of worried seriousness marring the joy on his face.
“Licked me half to death, looked sad when I flew off, last I heard it was napping in our living area. JARVIS is monitoring it.”
“My point is, it wasn’t the most romantic soulmarking, but I don’t think it was particularly bad either, right?”
“This being poses a greater threat than most have imagined. He has already wiped out planets, including my own.”
“He worries. I thought the Other Guy was going to get a rocket up his ass when he knocked you into that wall.”
For the next months, years, decades, he does. He carries the ember of love he has left into every fight, shields it as his friends join his husband while he himself still looks not a day over twenty six.
Steve glances at the dossiers that are now stacked neatly to the side and Tony watches his Adam’s Apple bob as he swallows. Ah.
Things will never be as they were, but he knows now – knows because he’s sure that what he saw was what Thor speaks of and what his mother taught him about, a world where the dead are happy and at peace. He knows they don’t have to be, in order to be happy. And he knows his family, his
“The usual?” Steve asks. He was still getting used to a stranger apparently knowing him better than he knew himself.
Steve tries not to stare as they take their seats at the restaurant. He was surprised to find their visit to the MOMA had helped settle him. As surreal as it had been – seeing the place look almost entirely divorced from the place Steve knew as a kid – it had also been comforting. Sure, the world around him was almost beyond recognition, but people would always paint, draw, sculpt. Humans would always create. After that, the future seemed a bit easier to take in. He could tell Sam wasn’t as into it, but Steve could appreciate the effort.
Tony seems to sense this because he grabs his hand and leads him deeper into the space station, flipping a switch on the way that must turn off the artificial gravity, because they float together the rest of the way.
So far there has been no movement detected, despite scanners finding very definite signs of life within the contraption. Tony gestures to the team below him to move out as he climbs down the wall to join them.
“Creature, please state your place of origin and your intended business on Knotov,” T’ny calls out and the creature whips around to him.
Steve rolls his eyes, and takes the suit from Tony, stripping his clothes off to pull on the modified undersuit Tony threw at him, before crossing to where the suit currently hangs. He detaches the pants from the rest and shuffles into them, laughing when Tony whistles as he bends over. Next he shimmies up the top part, managing to poke his head through the top after much twisting and turning. He looks around for Tony to help him attach the two pieces and notices he’s connected the Avenjet to an external airlock. Tony turns back to him, excitement shining through his eyes.
The past week, he’s been building up to this, or trying to, at least. Interacting with his team – his friends – all without his usual context, and then regaining that context...
He has loved Tony Stark in sickness and in health, and long since death has done them part, but in all that time he has abandoned himself in favour of bitterness and contempt.
Tony moves over to him then, murmuring his thanks and pressing kisses along his neck and jaw until Steve feels the Avenjet slowly come to a standstill. He frowns and looks up.
“JARVIS said he detected some nanites on the quantum sensors. Usually Sam’s pretty good with mechanics, but he mentioned you had a way to speed things up a bit?”
T’ny starts at that, because surely this Terran has not come all this way to a strange planet with not even a means to communicate? Had their situation been so dire that it had been stripped from them before they had boarded the only craft available to them. Or perhaps they had been forced to leave it behind. He knew many brands of communicator included a tracking device.
“No, Tony, I didn’t mean to spring it on you like that; I have no idea what came over me. It’s my fault, okay? You didn’t do anything wrong; it’s my fault.”
“Since the accident, Captain Rogers returns at irregular hours, oftentimes around late morning. He has also been making frequent use of the training facilities.”
“Yeah, I guess. You tend to call the shots in the field, but when you’re down, it’s him. In meetings and stuff, it’s you and him who have final say. You guys just work well together, I guess. You should talk to him.”
“You wouldn’t! I know now you wouldn’t. I knew before, but the past few weeks really hammered it home. Not knowing you or the team – it let me see things as they really are, instead of what I convinced myself they were.
Tony nudges his chest and Steve lies back obediently, automatically wrapping his arm around Tony’s waist when he settles against his side.
Fury only has time to utter “wolf,” before, indeed, a wolf stalks around the corner. A wolf that is easily twice the size of a regular wolf, with blonde-brown fur and piercing blue eyes that has Tony thinking of the other blond haired, blue eyed man he knows, name beginning with S and whose last name would sound really good with his tacked on the end and- and teeth. This wolf has teeth which are also twice the size of a regular wolf’s and Tony swallows. Probably not the time for that particular train of thought. The aforementioned teeth are currently on vicious display as the wolf drips saliva in a trail along the floor. The wolf looks right at him, taking him in for a moment, before- relaxing. Its hackles come down and its ears prick back up happily. When the armour rushes through the window, the wolf growls softly as it encases Tony but then cocks his head and moves forward, heaving itself onto its hind legs and bringing its forelegs down to rest on the shoulders of the armour, effectively pinning Tony in a standing position to the floor.
After a beat, Steve figures either Sam just knows him that well or he must be able to read his thoughts because Sam says “he died,” gently, almost for Steve’s sake, like he knew what Steve had been hop- thinking.
“Sorry, sorry, gosh, Tony, I didn’t mean to just- but you are, right? I mean, everyone always says we’re really close but no one really talks about it, and you don’t talk about us either, even though I can see you want to, and the mark on my shoulderblade sort of matches your hand?”
He struggles to get an arm beneath himself and when he looks down, he sees clothes that are suddenly too big for his frame and hands that are wrinkled and dotted with liver spots.
“Uh,” Tony manages, opening the faceplate and staring down at the creature who simply looks up at him with those bright blue eyes.
“No one’s saying you are,” Tony snaps back. “Just that it might not be a good idea to rush back into battle after a traumatic head injury that, need I remind you, you’re still not recovered from?”
He looks at Thor then, looks into storm grey eyes and allows himself to reach out to the kindness he finds in them.
Steve looks down at him, briefly closing his eyes, and Tony can feel the gentle puffs of breath against his face when Steve murmurs “Thank you, Tony. Really.”
allowed to splash out on him. They had agreed Christmas and valentines were permitted what Steve described as a “reasonable gift” and birthdays and anniversaries were permitted something that Tony described as “more personal.”
Barely twenty minutes later, Tony touches down on the landing pad outside the SHIELD headquarters in Washington. The suit opens and he walks briskly to the conference room, eager for whatever explanation Fury has to offer. He hurries around the corner and sees the rest of the Avengers, bar Steve, through the glass doors, all gathered around the meeting table. He frowns as the door slides open and looks around.
“I can’t,” he whispers, miserable and aching and for the first time in over six hundred years, home.
“There’s books about ‘em in the library, Mister, is that what you want? They used to battle around here, didn’t they? The town has a memorial thing for them. Are you a historian?”
Steve feels that same guilt from earlier settle more firmly in him, and it’s this that makes him bench himself when the alarm sounds for the Avengers barely a day later.
“Steve, I can’t count the number of times the thought of your sheer will and determination were the only things that got me through some sticky situations.
The second thing he registers is a warm presence beside him. He doesn’t need to look to know who it is and he rolls over onto his side, securing his arm around Tony’s chest and pulling him close. He lays there and reflects on the last three years with the insights that come with essentially being dropped into the life of a stranger.
Distantly, he hears himself thank the young ones and, on autopilot, he directs the horse away, wandering aimlessly through the trees that shadow one side of the town.
Steve furrows his own brow. Did the Commandos not roam this land any longer? He did remember they had been talking about moving east to help with conflicts that had been arising there.
“He remembers him. He was sort of a mess when I found him, but he talked about stuff that wasn’t in that file. No one told him-” He looks at Clint for confirmation, who shakes his head, “-so he must have remembered his best friend who tried to kill him, and who did kill my parents, but he still doesn’t remember his soulmate.”
When he wakes the next morning, nose pressed to blond hair, he can’t help but wonder when the smell of wet dog started to smell like home.
There’s a knock on the door and it’s reflex that has him calling out “come in” rather than any real desire to talk to anyone. Steve looks up as the door opens and the black man with the beard steps in, shutting the door softly behind him. He hovers somewhat awkwardly for a moment, before moving over to a plush chair in the corner of the room and dragging it over to the bed and easing himself into it. This close and without crappy hospital lighting, the deep purple and green bruises around his jaw are clear. Steve winces internally.
He wonders briefly what the woman had been about to say, but finds himself distracted by the mattress that feels like it’s below him. He feels like he’s slowly sinking into the damn thing, a stark contrast to the brick-like pallets he was used to. It’s enjoyable until he remembers that the softness is due to 70 years of technological innovation-70 years he spent under ice.
“There’s Stark, too. He can be a real pain in the ass, not great with people, but he tries. He cares about the team, puts a lot into it. Not just money – most of the stuff we use is his design. You two are sort of the team leaders.”
He makes sure their stories, their legends, live on. People talk of the compassion of the Falcon and the brilliance of Bruce Banner and the skill of the Black Widow and the stories of Thor still circle around too. People talk of these and more, the other avengers who have come and gone, but most of all, they talk about Earth’s best defender, their golden Avenger. They tell tales of Tony Stark and Steve wishes he could hear them and not feel something cruel twist in his chest.
Tony pushes himself up and reaches for the shampoo, pouring it directly onto Steve’s head before lathering it up. This was Steve’s fourth full moon with the team instead of SHIELD. The first time, they had been cautious, not wanting to take for granted that Steve would recognise the rest of them as he did Tony. When a thorough licking and thumping tail confirmed that he did, they organised for the next full moon to be spent running some basic tests, taking bloods and measuring stamina and such. Steve had expressed an interest in exploring whether the wolf could be used in fights, and Tony figured it best to know what exactly they would be dealing with before any training started. The third had been the night after a battle with some alien horde and so was spent lounging around the tower. By the time the full moon rolled around this time, Tony still hadn’t had time to make any wolf friendly training equipment, so tonight, they had figured they’d try taking Steve to one of the nearby dog parks. They had found out the first time that Capwolf wasn’t actually hostile unless presented with a threat, so there was no danger. Tony organised to have the groundskeepers leave it open for them for the night and the night had been surprisingly enjoyable. Steve especially seemed to enjoy the opportunity to run around, successfully jumping in what seemed like every puddle in the park, hence Tony’s current attempt at bathing him.
“I don’t- I know I said you have a right to know, but I think they also have a right to be the one to tell you.”
“I should have told you this a while ago, but I- I was scared. I thought you’d think less of me, or- or realise I’ve never been the person you think I am.”
She nods and hesitates before asking “Do- would you mind helping us?” She gestures behind her, where a small group of people are gathered around a boulder. “We have to move it to clear out the farm land and none of us can move it, but Mam said you looked really strong.”
And Steve looks at him, grief overcome with bafflement because of course. Of course. More than anyone.
Silence settles over them as Steve wrestles with Tony’s words. He can feel the logic to them, but truly accepting them feels like trying to run through quicksand.
The man – Sam – doesn’t offer his hand. Steve supposes, to him, they’re past that. Sam gives him a considering look before continuing.
Thor’s rumble is soft and as they walk side by side back to the palace and back to their battlefields, the wind rushes past them, soft through his hair and warm against his arms.
Tony pulls takeout boxes from a plastic bag, his heart pounding in his chest. Why the hell is he so nervous? It’s not like he hasn’t heard Steve talk about Howard before.
“Sorry about that,” he frowns and tugs gently on it “Couldn’t get a space safe suit ready for you in time.”
“Steve, stay, stay- Steve! For god’s sake, you’re not actually a dog, would you-” Tony sighs as he sits back from the bath, utterly drenched. He looks at the happy face of the wolf in front of him, tail wagging and making the bathroom, somehow, even more wet than he had when he was climbing in.
“You have to gather whatever allies you have, start evacuating citizens, somewhere where they’ll have a chance,” they continue, desperation making their tone lilt strangely.
Steve looks down at the girl in utter bewilderment. What on earth is she talking about? Library? A historian? They have those where he lives with Tony, but his home had never been quite that organised, or so he’d thought.
Anthony helps pull him up onto the horse, then tugs on the reins. As the horse gallops away he can hear his friends whoop and cheer after him. He settles the twinge of uncertainty in his gut with the resolution to visit them soon.
After the water gurgles down the drain, Tony manages to towel the water out of Steve’s fur before Steve wriggles out of his grasp and darts out of the en suite, bounding up onto their bed and plonking himself down to bury his snout under a pillow. Tony, knowing from past experience that there is no moving a super werewolf who’s decided he’s had enough, peels off his own water-soaked clothes and quickly rubs a towel across himself. He pads out into their bedroom, pulling on one of Steve’s t-shirts from the drawer and joining his furry form in their bed. He curls around the massive beast beside him. He may snore like the devil, but hell, Tony wouldn’t trade it for anything.
Tony takes it and Steve watches as he runs his hands over the top before carefully pulling the tape from the paper. Steve feels a flutter of nervousness as he watches Tony unwrap the gift. Not that he thinks, or indeed that he thinks Tony will think, that his gift is in any way inadequate. They both have very different ways of expressing affection and Steve had been perhaps a bit insecure about things like this at the start of their relationship, worrying over whether Tony would expect lavish gifts and surprises equal to what he gave. He quickly realised, however, that of course he didn’t. That wasn’t who Tony was, wasn’t who he ever was and quite frankly, money was wasted trying to buy him anything. Now Steve mostly enjoyed the challenge of trying to find new and interesting gifts.
Steve grunts in response. The back of his head feels like someone hit him with a truck, which, he supposes, someone sort of did.
So then. This creature is a Terran. T’ny suppresses a frown as he thinks back to his intergalactic studies classes, where Terran’s has been summarised as a less evolved form of Knotovians.
Steve just grunts in response. The fact that these people know him so well, well enough to be able to read the minutiae of his expressions and he can’t even remember their names is almost worse than- everything else.
Hulk glowers a moment more before bowing his head in defeat. Steve watches as their resident green giant shrinks and pales to a tan complexion, and then he’s looking down at Bruce Banner. Bruce staggers for a moment, gripping the medical tray and shaking his head.
“I don’t-“ they shake their head, “I need to talk to someone. Please. Somethings coming through the galaxy, and it-“ They cut themselves off, taking a moment to breath and square their shoulders.
They approach the- craft, it appears to be as they draw nearer. A somewhat clumsy design but as they begin to surround it, tranq guns raised, it becomes unmistakable. They are dealing with a crashed spacecraft. A craft that, on Knotov would be in a museum and that contains an as of yet unknown creature.
The girl smiles up at him. “That’s great!” She pauses a moment as she seems to consider him. “Are you okay? You look like you’ve got a cold on you.”
The elevator doors open and Steve isn’t prepared for the sounds of laughter and happy conversation that meet him.
He spends the day like that, hearing tales of things long passed and grappling with the crushing realisation that he no longer has a place in his homeland.
Tony frowns and moves back into Steve’s space, his own awkward feelings be damned. He grasps Steve’s arms and looks up, mustering up all the sincerity he can.
They sit in silence for a while. Steve stares curiously at the black, rectangular devices the waiters and waitresses use to take orders. He wonders if they’re anything like Sam’s mobile telephone and makes a mental note to ask him later.
They walk for a while in silence, Steve giving Sam time to work up to whatever it is he seems to want to say. The thought surprises him. He glances over at Sam. There’s nothing obvious about him that gives any such indication, and yet Steve is virtually certain of the fact that Sam wants to say something to him, but is hesitating. It’s possible he picked it up from their time spent together today, but-
“Steve, I know you can at least kind of understand me, human you told me you can. Stop trying to flood our goddamn bathroom.”
Before he realises what he’s doing, he’s moved off the sofa and over to Tony, wrapping him in a bear hug. He feels Tony’s stiff surprise, and is about to let go when Tony puts his own arms around Steve’s waist. Steve tucks his head against Tony’s neck and breathes.
Despite the battles that await them at the next turn of the sun, T’ny cannot help but feel immensely grateful for having met him.
followed by something that sounds worryingly like a door being ripped from its hinges. The next is Fury’s voice over the Tower’s intercom system.
His life comes back to him in disjointed chunks. After remembering Bucky, the memories pour in, and he feels like he’s reliving the past three years on speed run, all while someone pries open his head with a crowbar.
from NASA? I built this for Avengers use, just in case. Carol uses it as well sometimes, if she’s nearby. I keep it stocked.”
Steve meets Tony’s friends, some of them anyway. In particular, the feisty redhead with the strange name catches Steve’s attention – Romanov or Romanoff or something similar. When Tony finds them together at the end of the night, he laughs at their drunken state - a result of some new drinking game she had introduced him to.
extravagant and/or unnecessary gift giving. No strips of private beach or new cars or entire wardrobes of clothes he would be too nervous to wear. There had been a lot of back and forth with that rule, arguing about what qualified as extravagant and when Tony
Steve nods. He knows he should engage Bruce more, assure him that he’s fine, but he can’t help himself as his eyes drift to the figure beside him.
It’s a few hours later when Steve is in the communal room with Natasha, watching Clint and Thor play video games. He looks up from the screen when he hears the sound of voices down the hall and turns just before Sam, Bruce and Tony burst through the doors. He watches in rapt relief for a few moments as they chatter amongst themselves, Tony and Sam gesturing about while Bruce nods along enthusiastically.
And that strikes something in him. He does, doesn’t he? He trusts Sam and Bruce. He may be co-leader but that only works because he trusts his team. Natasha gives him a friendly jostle as she goes by, interrupting his little revelation.
He turns to Steve as he starts his own halting explanations, about how one of the serum’s unforeseen side effects was a textbook (or, Tony supposed, fantasy-book) case of lycanthropy.
Tony gives Steve’s shoulder a friendly pat and watches as the rest of the team give their assurances that, no, this would affect neither their working nor personal relationships, as long as he didn’t bite any of them. Steve smiles tiredly at the joke, and after that, everyone settles into comfortable conversation, the tension from earlier bleeding out until it’s almost like it was never there.
He rounds the corner, tears finally let loose. In front of him, the conversation dies and everyone turns to look at him, curiosity in their eyes and sympathy tugging at their lips.
Tony feels like a weight has been lifted off his shoulders. He had really been trying his best to support Steve, but he’s only human and the effort of not letting himself get too close had been starting to weigh on him. He expects things between them to get easier and they do – sort of. Steve is still sleeping on his own floor and is quieter than before, but, well, this is a big change and Tony would wait a hundred years for Steve to adjust if he had to.
Steve jerks out of his reverie when he hears the elevator doors slide open and now familiar footsteps move down the hall.
And honestly, he means to reply with a friendly “No problem,” and a pat on the shoulder, but too late he realises he’s pressing his lips against Steve’s. Funnily enough, he can’t bring himself to regret it when he feels Steve very firmly kissing him back.
He feels warm hands cup his face and looks into warm brown eyes and somewhere inside him a little of the ice that’s been spreading melts. Distantly, he registers that they are alone, and wants to wonder how that happened, but banishes the thought almost as soon as it forms. He’s not alone. As long as he has Tony, he’s not alone. So he lets tears slip down his face and lets himself feel.
He finds people working their land, hunting for food, enjoying nature. When he asks, they all tell him stories of the Commandos, of Peggy, of Bucky, of himself.
Tony finds Steve sitting hunched over on the workshop floor, head clutched in his hands and surrounded by distressingly familiar documents and pictures.
Steve laughs when Tony chases one of the gloves, swimming through the air after it. He himself takes the moment to enjoy the odd, weightless sensation.
When the doors slide open, he’s greeted by the four faces of their teammates, concerned and curious in various measures. He lowers Tony onto one of the beds, pulling out and securing the restraints they keep handy for just these occasions.
He looks around himself, at the people surrounding him and dives deep into himself for the strength he found with each of them. He finds it and clings, looks each in the eyes and hopes it is enough.
“But seeing the Winter Soldier, and then realising that it’s his lifelong best friend who’s been tortured and brainwashed? That’s capital T traumatic, Stark, especially since he already blames himself for the guy falling off the train in the first place. I don’t think the memory recovery has anything to do with you or him, just whatever he was feeling at the time – and at the time you got your soulmarks, you were just two guys about to start some fisticuffs.”
He looks up from where he’s watching Tony pull off the lid, wanting to see his reaction. Truthfully, the gift had been a little rushed as he’d completely underestimated how much time it would take to complete. Nonetheless it wasn’t too bad, if Steve said so himself, it was even quite good.
The smile Thor cracks is relieved and joyful in a way he has not imagined feeling again. And despite the pain he realises he has caused them both, he finds he lacks the mulish stubbornness to hate himself for it. This is where they are now, and he has only the future to shape, the past quite firmly set in stone.
“Listen, Steve, I’m just telling you this because you have a right to know and because you’ll find out anyway, but about your soulmate-”
Sam winces at the words. Avengers Tower looms in front of them as they approach its revolving doors.
When he reaches shore, he looks around him, amazed at how much the land has changed since his has last been – it seems there exist only echoes of the place he knew. He rides around until he comes across a small town, approaching a group of teenagers sitting outside a barn.
This creature is perhaps a little taller than average, more well built and his gaze not quite as sharp, but apart from that, there is nothing to mark him as not of their world. Had their craft not been so poorly constructed, this creature may well have successfully infiltrated Knotov society, passing off any unusual physical attributes as a genetic anomaly. The thought sends a chill up T’ny’s spine.
The years seem to pass both like running water and dripping treacle, but then, Steve supposes, time is a funny thing.
A partially constructed Iron Man armour covers one bench, a set of arrows strewn across another. Blue light from projected blueprints fills the room and as he steps over the threshold, something comes whizzing over to him and beeps repeatedly, the claw at the end of its arm whirring.
He rides over to the boulder, the crowd clearing as he approaches on the horse. He leans to the side, gripping the reins tightly and careful not to lean too far. He manages to grip the boulder, heaving it up.
That couldn’t be right. Steve always left for his run at 6:30 and was back by 8:30 at the latest, and that was only if he stopped at the place down the street to get the bagels he knew Tony likes. Except he obviously wouldn’t be stopping for anything for Tony – they were still strangers, as far as Steve was concerned.
The truth of the statement surprises him. He woke up in the hospital yesterday afternoon, was told he was seventy years in the future and the leader of a team of superheroes, and arrived at the Tower, supposedly his home, which looked right out of a comic book, yesterday evening. Mostly, he’s been overwhelmed, and hasn’t had time or bandwidth to miss home. But he knows he will, once the shock wears off. Steve’s ashamed to say he’s not really looking forward to it. At least during the war, he could be homesick for a place that still existed, for somewhere that he could, at least in theory, go back to. Now, though...
Steve catches the helmet and peers at the suit Tony’s gesturing proudly at, caught between amused and thoroughly unimpressed.
He waltzes onto Steve’s floor again that night, takeout in one hand and StarkPad in the other. He falters somewhat at the sight of Steve sitting by himself at the kitchen counter with what looked like a PB&J  and a half dozen dossiers in front of him. Tony moves closer and glances at the file closest to him, unsurprised to find his father’s sepia-toned eyes staring back at him.
And Tony smiles, but it is sad and Steve wants to cry again, so he does. He grieves for the family he has lost, the life he used to lead and the person he once was. Grieves for all of it and hates himself through it all, and hates that he hates it, can’t even give Tony a meaningful goodbye-
Soon after, he feels Tony’s breaths even out as he drifts off. The steady rhythm has his own eyes feeling heavy and he settles deeper into the couch.
“I like experiences,” Steve agrees “I like experiences on Earth too, maybe in our bedroom with just the two of us for the evening.”
When the suns on Asgard start to cross and their light begins to fade, Thor grips his shoulder and looks down at him, imploring.
Another moment and the entire team takes a step back in horror as the door is ripped forcibly from its hinges.
his heart loves. He wonders why ending that promise was part of the deal. He has loved Tony Stark through life and he will love him through death too, this he knows like he knows the sun will set every day.
There’s a funeral. Of course there is, he was Tony Stark and Iron Man, had saved them in more ways most cared to know. So they have a funeral, where people bring candles and flowers and others throw stones and bitter words.
The creature says something that the translator takes a millisecond to recognise as one of Terra’s many dialects.
Now T’ny stares at the bottom of the bed above his and casts their mind back to their first encounter, what feels like a lifetime ago when in fact it has been merely what Steve would refer to as two years.
More than that, as he tilts Tony’s head up to catch his lips in a kiss, he knows it is the start of something legendary.
“I was thinking I could, y’know, regale you with tales of our first battle together. I know you’ve probably read the files, but still, nothing like an inside perspective. The suit records everything, and the Chitauri are really something you have to see to believe.”
Steve tilts his head at him, resting one of his great paws on the edge on the tub. Tony watches as water drips down the side before sighing and grabbing a towel to wash the dirt from the proffered paw.
Tony smiles, bright and kind. “Then believe me when I say you’re not the same as me, but you are every bit as good. Remember that. If you trust me – trust me to tell you the truth, and trust my judgement, then trust that this is the truth.”
“Steve,” he starts, gripping Steve’s arm firmly, “If you go, you must understand — it’s important you don’t get off the horse.”
“Yeah, I’m gonna head, too,” Sam stretches his arms “That was a lot of work. Good to have you back, Tony.”
Carefully, Tony tucks the handkerchief into the inside pocket of his jacket so that the hand embroidered Phoenix is peeking out from over the top and the tiny
“No, Steve, shut up, okay? I am sorry. I- we, the whole team, but especially me, I’m your soulmate – we should have known better than assuming you were just that okay with losing pretty much everything. I mean, we’ve all seen you when you’ve been punched by aliens, or shot by fellow super soldiers. I shouldn’t have assumed you’d deal with this pain any differently.
Tony doesn’t mean to let the hours roll by, all without ever broaching the whole “soulmate” thing with Steve. He definitely doesn’t mean to fall asleep on Steve’s sofa, but that’s where he wakes up, groggy and confused, the next morning.
He sees Natasha and Clint and Bruce on the sofa nearest to him, Sam with Peter by the windows, and Bucky and Rhodey and-
Steve sits perched on the edge of the bed, ready to jump to action if the need should arrive. He can hear them arguing down the hall. He’s almost certain he’s not supposed to hear them, but then he’s not supposed to be misplaced seventy years into the future either.
Tony stands as his eyes fall on him and Steve feels himself stumbling forward even as Tony moves towards him.
And so it goes. They pass the evening that way, then the next, and the next. When Tony runs out of footage, they turn back to movies. Some evenings, after he’s learned about the dubiousness of fast food, Steve cooks. It’s nice. Familiar enough that it’s easy to forget himself and lean in a little too close.
He pulls out a piece of paper and it’s only when he tries to read the blurred words that he realises there are tears in his eyes. He feels Tony’s hand brush his own, before it gently pries his hands apart and Steve watches, transfixed, as the sheet of paper drifts down to the floor.
With the cat out of the bag, it also means no one’s trying to keep any uncomfortable secrets, so team get togethers are more frequent. All in all, Tony can almost pretend that a building had never collapsed with Steve still inside and Steve never lost his memory.
“Look, is this unusual? A lot to take in? Yeah, of course, I mean you’re a capwolf. But Bruce is a giant green rage monster stored inside a five-foot six human, Thor is a literal Norse god, Natasha is probably a psychic and Clint is Clint. We’re all a little unusual and a lot to deal with.”
“Before and after I lost my memory, I, um- I've been having panic attacks. Pretty often. I can’t sleep a lot and when I do, I have nightmares. I think, uh, a therapist-”
Tower, as it stood over six centuries ago. He looks up and distantly remembers how ugly it had seemed to him once and wonders how he could ever think such a thing. His home –
Steve turns back towards the sofa, pulling Tony with him. He settles back down, Tony nestled against his side and can only smile when he looks down not five minutes later to find the other man sound asleep.
Sam adds the last bit like an afterthought, but something about the careful way he says it makes Steve wonder.
It could be that Tony really isn’t his soulmate, but Steve feels so certain – Sam's vagueness when Steve mentions Tony, the others’ hesitance to mention him at all, Tony’s initial avoidance of him paired with his noticeable efforts to put distance between them. Surely, Steve isn’t misreading all that.
They meet in the middle and Steve grips the sides of his arms, speechless and grief stricken all over again.
“Come.” Anthony slides off the horse, offering his hand up to Steve. “I’ll introduce you to my parents.”
“Fury thought I should have told you from the start, but-” Steve shrugs “-we were all new and I thought it would be best to wait until we knew each other. And then- there just never seemed a good time to bring it up. I should have told you at the start and I’m sorry, I hope it doesn’t affect the team.”
Steve doesn’t have time to respond before he finds himself thoroughly distracted by Tony’s lips against his. He’s shocked at how right it feels, how familiar, and he gives as good as he gets, pushing Tony into the cushions and swallowing his breathless laugh.
Steve pushes himself off the door and walks into the room, the door sliding soundlessly shut behind him. He pulls off his shirt, his belt, shoes and shimmies out of the trousers, laughing when he looks up to see T’ny watching him wiggle inelegantly.
“I can get the nanites out, but it’ll take a while. I know last time he was out, Bruce Banner was working on something that would streamline the process...” Sam trails off, looking at Hulk. Steve turns to face Hulk as well, who frowns and pouts, crossing his massive arms.
When their food comes, Steve can’t help but gawk at the sight. A burger the size as his head is set down in front of Sam and what looks to be an entire fried and battered fish fillet is placed in front of him. The waiter comes back with two bowls of fries and a salad.
Steve can hardly believe this man who seemed god-like had travelled all this way merely because he had heard tales of the Commandos, tales of him. And now he’s offered to take him to visit his home land – a place only rumoured of in the stories his mother used to tell him and which they still tell on quiet nights.
“That’s me.” Tony gestures towards the TV, which is displaying the cover for Singing In the Rain. “Am I interrupting something?”
“The doctors cleared me, didn’t they? If you have a problem with that, you can take it up with them.”
Steve smiles down at her. He had forgotten how perceptive children were. “Long day and a long journey back home.”
Steve shifts to mirror his position. Carefully, he reaches out and runs his fingers along Tony’s jaw.
All in all, Tony thinks their relationship is going well, would even dare to say they’re friends. Steve starts to open up, revealing little bits of himself as Tony reciprocates in kind; they continue this pattern until they know each other’s go to coffee orders and fighting styles almost as well as they know their own. So yes. Friends. And if, every once in a while, Tony imagines something else a little different, then that’s no one’s business but his own.
He leans forward and this time when his legs start to shake, he lets them give out and he falls, crumpling at Tony’s feet, sobbing in a way he hasn’t let himself, ever.
“The other Avengers are in the Tower, sir, except Thor, who is still with Dr Foster, and Agent Barton, who left for SHIELD several moments ago.”
Indeed, they had heard that such a threat had been moving through the galaxy, and there has long been dissent about what many perceived as the Knotovian leaders refusal to address the issue. Perhaps this confirmation of exactly how grave the threat is would be enough to convince the council to move to action.
When he wakes up, it takes him a moment to recognise the Tower’s medbay. Briefly, he wonders if he should start getting used to waking up surrounded by medical equipment. Tony sits, slumped and asleep, to his right, and  Bruce is in a chair at the foot of the bed. Bruce gives him a tentative smile as he pushes himself to a sitting position.
T’ny takes back his initial assessment, that their gaze is not as sharp as a Knotovian’s. The blue eyes that are looking back at him are full of intent, equal parts curious and wary and clouded with something heavy..
There’s a peaceful lull in conversation as they take what Steve suspects is the long way back to the Tower after Steve had eaten what was, in hindsight, an embarrassing amount of food. He’s still not sure if he believes that a whole fried fish, a pizza and a plate of spaghetti and meatballs is really his usual, but he can’t think of any other way to explain the dishes coming out one after another, either.
“Hey,” he says back, shuffling over and pulling the covers back in invitation. He can’t remember the last time the top bunk had been used. Funny, how things creep up on you and offering comfort after a nightmare can so easily slip into something else..
Steve stares into his husband’s eyes, dark and desperate, and he finds himself nodding. “Of course. I promise.”
Steve looks up at her and it’s ridiculous but he can almost feel the life being sucked out of him, all those stolen centuries returning to the earth beneath him.
“JARVIS?” He sits up, rubbing his eyes, a blanket that he doesn’t recall having last night pooling around him.
“Give me a moment,” Tony grins and pulls back before pushing a button in the arm of the chair. Steve watches as the chair leans back and red and gold plates unfold from its interior to wrap themselves around Tony.
“My quantum sensors have picked up nanites entering Sir’s body via airwaves. They appear to be what is causing his behaviour.”
The next afternoon, Tony enters the communal kitchen to find Steve surrounded by the rest of the Avengers. They all look up when he walks in, five sets of eyes absently tracking his movements to the coffee machine. Clint finally breaks the silence.
Sam moves out of the chair suddenly, and offers his hand to Steve. Steve stares it blankly, then looks up to Sam’s face.
“You worry too much, Steven,” he bellows, a knowing glint in his eye, “Samuel and Bruce will best these creatures as they have many a beast before them; you must have faith in your shield brothers.”
“I did,” he murmurs, looking out at the greens and golden yellows and bright blues that surround them.
He winces at how frail his voice sounds, a rasping whisper that his failing sense of hearing strains to pick up.
Steve marries Tony after a year and together they form a group who come to be known as the Avengers. This land, for all its beauty, is not without its problems. Steve has never been one to back down from a fight that needs to be fought and thankfully, neither is Tony.
When the elevator doors slide open, Steve’s voice reaches him from what sounds like the living room. Mildly curious, Tony follows it, and finds Steve standing in the middle of the room, looking up at the ceiling with his brow furrowed.
“Well, have you thought that’s maybe a compliment? I mean, he got his soulmark because he was trying to fuck off and get away from you during an argument and you grabbed his shoulder so you could have the last word. And after that, you started arguing again and then you got your soulmark because you tried to fuck off and get away from him and he grabbed your wrist so he could have the last word. Or something, I wasn’t there.
“Oh yeah?” And Steve can hear the sly smile clear as day in Tony’s voice. “I thought you were interested in another kind of experience?”
He meets Thor on Asgard. They do this sometimes. Meet and reminisce on the good old days, when they were a team and could not even fathom the empty loneliness their lives have become.
“I’ll always be here,” Tony continues quietly, fingers idly tracing Steve’s soulmark. “Because I’m your soulmate, sure, but it’s more than that. We’ve both put too much work into us to let it all go because of something that is very manageable. Plus, I would manage anything for you. You are the one I love to manage most.”
“Maybe not,” Tony concedes, “But ‘sorry’ isn’t always about blame; sometimes it’s just ‘it sucks that this happened and this is me expressing that suck-y-ness to you’, which I am.”
“Mister, the Commandos haven’t been here for nearly seven hundred years. They haven’t been    anywhere in nearly seven hundred years, they’re all dead.”
Steve glances behind him to the Commandos at his back. He looks to Peggy, her eyes crinkling with a sad smile. Something seems to pass between them then, like a blessing being exchanged.
else. He loved Tony, but he still trusts Sam and Bruce. He can trust them to help Tony when he can’t.
