Tony was rock hard and his hands began shaking as he worked by the time Bucky finished. Clearing his throat he asked, “That doesn’t sound too bad, he still wasn’t willing to try?”
Tony’s voice was barely above a whisper when he asked, “How do you know that? It has to be, I spoke to them… It is, it can’t… It has to be true.”
“Feels like no one’s applied any pressure here for years,” Tony looked back to see Bucky give Steve a cocky smirk, “Don’t worry though, I’m sure I can dig in deep and work it loose.” Bucky began subtly meeting Tony’s thrusts down causing sparks to ignite, “How does that feel Tony, am I plowing in there deep enough?”
He looked everyone over smiling as he walked in like a man on a mission asking, “Is everyone ready to…” but trailed off when his gaze settled on Tony. Coming to a dead stop, Steve’s eyes began roving over him. He took in the T-shirt Tony was wearing with Cap’s face on the front, looking stern above the ‘Captain America’ title beneath it. Only the front was visible under the flannel shirt he took from Steve’s room along with the watch he borrowed on the way out. It was settled against the tiny shields lining up the outside seam of Tony’s pants, they traveled all the way down to the sneakers that had scenes from Cap’s comic strip on them.
The man quickly lifted his hands defensively, voice shaking slightly as waved them in the air. “Okay, no problem here guy… Sorry about that.”
Tony was frozen against Steve, mind stuttering to a halt as he replayed the man’s words over in his head a couple more times. Looking up to Barnes’ face above Steve’s, Tony caught the man giving him a once over coming back up to meet his eyes. He looked interested in a way that said he wouldn’t consider it a loss if Tony said no, which Tony couldn’t really blame him for when he was fucking the epitome of human perfection every night. This nor Bucky shrugging before he said “I’d be okay with that,” made Tony want to jump at the chance to fuck Bucky Barnes.
Tony looked down to where Bucky sat and blushed at the filthy look he was given. “Well, you gonna ask me nicely to pay you some attention sweetheart.”
. I’ll take the couch when I get back from the gym. I’ll only be gone for about 30 minutes but if you feel anything call me immediately, I meant it Tony.”
The team never actually had planned to move in to the Tower, it just sort of happened. At first they’d just crash after coming home staff-less, needing to go back to the drawing board and regroup. Then they were staying over whenever they were nearby or crashing a few days since they knew at least one other Avenger would be there for company. Before they knew it, all their clothes and belongings were in the Tower. When Tony mentioned it to them, most just shrugged it off, Clint’s being the funniest as he gave a stunned look saying, “Fuck… Didn’t even realize… The hell am I payin’ rent for? Tash remind me to get rid of my apartment. I haven’t even been there in like, months.”
It hadn’t taken Bucky a lot of time before Hydra to read his partners and figure out their deepest darkest desires. The ones they hid down so deep and guarded so closely they might as well have painted a neon sign for him. Back in the 40’s it would take Bucky about a week to uncover all his partners’ secrets. Now, with his enhanced senses and programming from Hydra, well it only took that first day with Tony.
This however did not stop Steve’s orgasm as he spilled across his hand, cum landing on his own thigh and Tony’s groaning, “Oh fuck baby, you just sounded so good, I’m sorry, Uhhh.”
Then, the dominant asshole flipped Tony over and started trailing a path back up the way he came. By the time he’d began nibbling at the cheeks of Tony’s ass, Tony had begun to beg and tremble at every touch. “Please Steve, Uhhh… God please, just touch me, I need, I need more. I’m so close… Please Steve, Please.” When all he received in reply were chuckled licks to his vertebrae, he started to pull at the ropes. “Untie me you asshole, if you won’t… Ah fuck, ohhh… If you won’t give me what I want I’ll do it myself.”
Tony pressed his head back to Bucky’s shoulder, body growing taught as he felt his orgasm creeping forward. “Don’t let Tony fool you Stevie.” Tony came shooting over Bucky’s fingers to land on the sofa’s arm and his phone. He continued to shake from it in Bucky’s arms as he felt Bucky slide into him once more before jerking as he came. “He loves the way I take care of him. Can promise he’s never had this much fun with you gone.”
Hearing the question, Steve managed to climb out of his haze to look up as well just as Tony face turned a deep shade of red. Shuddering around Bucky’s dick, Steve’s words were just as shaky as he looked at the moment. “What’s wrong Tony?”
While he had heard of the elusive son of Howard Stark that had stolen his best friend’s heart, Bucky hadn’t actually met the man yet. Tony had been staying at the Avengers Tower in Manhattan because he was still in the process of fighting the government on something called “The Accords” and still heading the development division of his company. It was also probably because Tony knew the Winter Soldier was the one hired to kill his parents. Steve had told Bucky that Tony already knew. That he understood Bucky wouldn’t have done it if he hadn’t been brain washed, but he couldn’t help but think it was the reason Tony had yet to visit. Steve would just leave to see the other man most nights and weekends when he wasn’t busy with the team.
Thanks to everyone for the comments and kudos!!! I’m having way more fun with this story than I should, lol hence why it keeps lengthening. Ch. 4 will be the end and and Steve’s feelings will not be hurt I promise!
Tony didn’t know what to say about any of the information Steve had just relayed to him. On the one hand, he loved Steve and wanted to give him anything he asked for. On the other, he loved Bucky just as much and knew the other man would hate what Steve was asking for. Furthermore, knowing Bucky had been playing him like a fucking harmonica this morning, setting Tony up to believe what he was saying to him, had Tony second guessing a few things. Luckily, he was saved from answering when Bucky spoke up from the bathroom doorway behind them, drawing both men’s gazes. “I think that’s a great idea Stevie. Last thing I wanna do is come between you two. Whether it’s a week or two weeks, or hell even a month, whenever you want Tony to yourself just let me know and I’ll back off until you want me back. Deal?”
Steve made a noise of agreement. “Yeah Tony’s right. Anytime we spar I’m afraid I’ll accidently hit him for real. We never go all out, maybe you should work with him more Buck. I’d feel better if he learned all he could.”
Tony had been a smart child from a very young age. As soon as he was old enough to realize what his father meant when he said his mother was a Sub and he was a Dom, he began to want to know why this was. Like playing with the mechanics in his father’s workshop, Tony had a deep desire to understand the mechanics of people’s orientations as much as he did the mechanics of a car engine.
Now that he’d done what he needed to, Bucky could sit back enjoying Tony screaming and constricting around him with each thrust. Bucky looked down to glare at where he was stretching Tony open, appearing and disappearing inside the smaller man as he hammered harder. Feeling Steve’s cock pulse beneath him signaling an impending orgasm, he felt the tingling in his balls of his own as well.
Tony felt himself nod his head, if only so he could get back to the feeling of Bucky remaking his entire existence. He barely noticed Bucky turning his body. Tony now was on his knees, the inside of Tony’s legs touching Bucky’s outside as they almost completely aligned together. He moaned around Steve’s cock in his mouth as Bucky began to thrust again, hand still keeping Tony from his climax as he leaned down to kiss Tony’s ear when he whispered, “If you want me to be the one that makes you cum, then make Stevie come in your mouth. Otherwise, I’ll leave you to your chances with him. If I pull out of you for him now Tony, I won’t ever fuck you again. Tonight or any other night baby, choice is yours.”
Bucky stepped back giving Tony room, leering over him as a hand slid up and down the length of his cock. “Turn around legs apart and bend over with your back against the wall.” Tony’s hands were shaking in anticipation as he moved to follow Bucky’s request. He could see the man moving forward between the V of his legs as Bucky came nestling right up to Tony grabbing his ass cheeks. He pulled Tony’s Sweats down a little further, gliding his erection along the crease as he as he pushed the globes together. Continuing the movement, Bucky held him to the wall and forced Tony up on his toes.
When Tony had come up from his lab after being down there for 3 days, Steve had been so happy that he only realized Tony had a haunted look in his eyes after they’d parted. Steve still couldn’t shake the feeling that he had come up break things off, the look on his face at first seemed sad but resigned. It was only there a moment before it was gone and he was in Steve’s arms again, but it kept trailing through Steve’s mind anyway. He had tried to do better, make Tony feel more definite of his place within their relationship, but was failing miserably. Steve would talk with Tony in bed at night, see the passion he had as he spoke about whatever project he was working on and grow so hard dick ached. He had told himself it wasn’t fair to push sex on Tony when he wasn’t in the mood for it, even if Steve could work him up enough to want it. So Steve would stay with him until the Tony went to sleep, then sneak into Bucky’s room to keep his hands off Tony. But it seemed the more Steve tried, the worse things got. Tony barely even smiled anymore, and Steve knew he was the reason for it.
Tony pulled his hand out of Bucky’s, letting it waver in the air uncertainly before he crossed his arms over his chest.  He looked down as he shifted his hand again to massage his forehead, the shifting of his movements mimicking the inconsistent emotions he felt inside himself.  “Look, I’m sorry… I just, I didn’t mean to put all the responsibility on you cause, well I was a more than willing participant in it all. I feel, I can’t help… I really am in love with you Bucky but, it just… It has to stop. I can’t, I
Maybe it was the fact that Tony was competitive, or maybe even a little angry at Steve for wanting Bucky as much as he did, but Tony wanted to be the one to take all of Bucky. He needed something in all of this that only he could offer, even if that wasn’t to Steve. Giving the soldier a determined look, Tony squeezed Bucky’s ass as he said, “I want it all, want to feel all of you. God Bucky, fuck me as deep as you can.” Bucky’s gaze grew even more heated than they already were but Tony saw he was still hesitating. Before he could ask Tony answered him saying, “I’m sure, ask Steve. I never do more than I can take and I’ve had to stop him before.” Giving Bucky a look of frustration he continued saying, “I know my body, now fucking fuck me already or move and let Steve do it.”
Steve let out a roaring laugh as Bucky walked in the living room, taking a seat at the other end of the couch. He leaned into the couch looking at the duo before asking, “Do I even want to know?”
The man above him shuddered as his eyes closed for a moment before opening again to stare down at him in awe. “Fuck Tony, can’t believe you all of me in your mouth.” He pulled Tony off of it by his hair giving him a second to breath before thrusting back into Tony’s mouth again. “God you’re so good baby, gonna make you cum so fucking hard.” Pulling Tony off his dick once more, Bucky let the smaller man breath as he said, “Want you to finger yourself open for me sweetheart. Get yourself nice and loose while I fuck your face. Gonna come down your throat before I make that ass of yours mine again. Can you do that for me, you’re doing so well taking it everything I give you. Can you do that one last thing for me?”
I took my dog tags off from around my neck and placed them around his "Why are you giving me them, they're yours" I placed a small kiss on his forehead "And you can give them back to me when you get through this".
Everyone was almost ready to go, my bag was the first one to be left by the door, but everyone else was getting there, slowly but surely. I was fixing up some car snacks when things went quiet and I couldn't see anyone anymore. I walked into the common room where they were all gathered around the TV. I read the screen "Tony Stark to make surprise statement".
We strolled over to pick out something sweet but we only made it halfway down the table. Tony picked up the wiped cream and looked at me with a devilish smile "You up for it?" I couldn't form words so I just nodded and we ran out of the barn back to our hotel room. Tony set his watch "we have half an hour until they cut the cake, I'll be out in five". He disappeared into the bathroom while I got comfortable, and naked, on the bed.
I walked outside and sat down on the swinging bench. I brought my hand up to my chin and zoned out. I was lost in my own thoughts when the bench swayed, I turned my head and Steve was sitting next to me with a caring smile. I moved under his arm and buried my face into his chest. He slowly stroked my hair. "Do you want to take a walk, Tony?" I lifted my head "yeah...okay".
It felt like hours by the time the door opened and closed again. When we turned around teenage Tony was curled up in a ball in his bed. No one spoke, until Tony did "We better start looking for the stone, check those engenering books, and maybe those photos..." he was breathing fast and almost crying. Natasha and Clint started to look while I wrapped my arms around Tony, he whispered "it's not over yet Steve...I don't know- Steve- I can't-".
Peter looked back at us "what? No way!" MJ was amused that he didn't know "Don't you ever listen to the news, it was everywhere". He slumped back in the chair, rubbing his hand over his eyes "Oh my God! Yesterday you two weren't actually swimming at two am where you?". Tony smirked, "No...no we were not".
After the shock had set in we were all back in the meeting room. Thor started talking "You see, my friends, late last night I was thinking about an old tale my mother would tell me as a child about infinity stones..." I noticed Steve staring at me from across the table, I took out my phone 'stop staring'. He looked at the message and rolled his eyes. Thor continued to explain, with the help of Wong, a possible way to reverse what Thanos had done.
I needed a breath from the kiss, at this stage we were both fully aroused, and I was starting to lose my mind "If we were back at my place there are so many things I'd want to do to you". I forgot Steve Rogers was just an innocent flower how had only had sex twice, both times with me. That's why I was surprised when he picked up his belt and tied my wrists to the head board.
The three of us all stood, with space to spare and Peter looked around, Tony was right, there were at least ten, if not fifteen, top of the line suits hanging up, "I can't believe you didn't know about this! Did you even get Friday to go through your room with you?" "Um no, I skipped that".
A text came through, Sam tapped it "What are you doing!" I snapped "Sorry it was a force of habit". It was too late the message was open. Sam gaspes and showed me 'I can't focus right now, I just keep thinking about how you took control last night" I was trying to wrap my head around it but still reading  "tying me up and pushing into me, I'm surprised I held out so long" "I know texting isn't your things, but I just want your opinion on some underwear" there was a photo of a man, only showing his underwear, they were skimpy and lace, a deep red colours.
Steve’s eyes looked down to meet Tony’s, wanting to be careful to consider his feelings before he agreed. “Is that ok, Tony?”
Giving Steve a feigned look of ignorance he answered back, “I’m not sure, maybe if you could say whatever it is I should be saying to her first, it’ll jog my memory.”
Trying to pull Steve’s body back down to his and hearing the man chuckle as he was unable to made Tony growl out a frustrated whine. “Then why the hell are you stopping Rogers? Get naked and put your dick in me already.”
“In the morning, when you’re sober, we’re going to talk about this and why you did it. Why you begged to come here and why you’ve been miserable almost every moment since. You’re gonna sit down and finally tell me what’s going on in that head of yours. I’ll tell you this again tomorrow, but right here and right now, I need you to know one thing…”
Tony’s synapses finally started firing again as he saw Bucky looking behind his back to Steve. While he gripped Bucky’s hips to stop his retreat Steve’s tone was a little whining as he said, “No why, of course you should finish. What wrong, why you need to stop.”
Steve looked a little relieved as relaxed into Tony. “That’s good to know, maybe one day we’ll try it again.”
Steve nodded quickly saying, “Yes, that’d be perfect,” before grimacing as he ended with, “I’ll have to talk to Tony first, make sure he’s comfortable with it. Don’t know how he’s gonna feel having, you know, intimate moments in front of someone.” Bucky wanted to laugh; Tony had an exhibitionist streak a mile long. That Steve didn’t know that after 3 years when Bucky knew in 3 days was just ridiculous. Good lord, Steve didn’t know what Tony liked above the bare basics, if he even knew that.
Level 10 Submissive’s were considered a rare oddity because in addition to their own traits, they also had the traits of an Authoritative Dom. They would fight to gain control and then even harder to keep it. It’s why most Dom’s couldn’t top them. Only a hand full of level 9’s had the patience to even try and even fewer had the temperament follow through.
Tony’s eyes landed on him across the room as he nodded at whatever Steve was saying to him. Tony choked on the wine he had just raised to his lips as Bucky increased the vibrations of the toy inside him again. Bucky chuckled quietly as he Tony turned to glare in his direction after saying whatever words he’d used to placate Steve. He had to admit that he loved that Tony knew everything now, knew exactly how devious Bucky could be and had been, and was still with him anyway. It was freeing in a way, to have someone know the devil in him and still love him anyway. When Tony looked toward the bathroom and then back at Bucky, he just shook his head no. As much as he would love to fuck Tony and then send him back to Steve covered in his cum, Bucky had other plans for his engineer tonight.
Steve looked even more worried and opened his mouth to answer, but Tony’s A.I. beat him to the punch. “No sir, lockdown protocols are still in place. Captain Rogers has used Miss Potts override code to obtain entrance.”
He would have laughed at the terrible pick up but two things happened. The first was Steve saying, “That won’t be happening and was never an option.” Tony began to turn around and tell Steve to fuck off, but he stopped as the other Dom in front of him paled.
He felt and heard Steve putting the glass down and picking something up from Tony’s nightstand. “Oh she’s not pissed about that. All I got from her rant this morning was something about Clint having a keeper and something about him not just kissing her ass. Reading between the lines, I’m pretty sure you either said or made a reference about Clint you shouldn’t have. If that’s true, I’d say you should know better. That you know the quickest way someone can piss off a Dom is by demeaning their Sub or their bond to their Sub in ways they don’t care for.”
Bucky watched through the glass of Tony’s workshop as the other man brought himself to a quick orgasm. He usually remembered to black the glass after finishing with Bucky but had obviously forgotten in his rush to get himself off. Bucky had been playing nice with the little engineer, keeping things light and just getting to know what made the other man tick. He had told himself he’d leave Stevie’s boyfriend alone and not give into what he really wanted. Bucky had every intention of continuing to be a good boy, but when Tony Damn near straddled his thighs all those thoughts flew out the door.
Reaching back Tony grabbed Bucky’s hips to stop their movement, knowing he wouldn’t be able to concentrate with Bucky moving inside him. Tony knew exactly what would make Steve lose control, the things that never failed to make the man forget everything but the feel of Tony’s mouth around his cock. Feigning as if he didn’t feel the signaled tug Steve had given him, Tony quickly drove Steve to the point of coming in his mouth. He sucked as hard as he could, creating a vacuum around the hard length as he bobbed back and forth a few times. Once he heard Steve yell, “God Tony, hmmm honey, you gotta, fuck baby you’re gonna…” only to break off, Tony pushed him over the edge. He scraped his teeth softly along the vein underneath Steve’s dick as he tongued the slit. Steve had always liked the added feeling of little teeth and had told Tony before that his tongue in the slit of his cock always made him cum. It made Steve think Tony was chasing the cum he wanted, as if Tony was trying to dig in and find it. This time was proved to be no different as Tony soon felt Steve cock jerk, pulsing as it began filling his mouth.
Tony breath was coming out heavy as he focused back to Bucky’s arm. When he told Bucky, “I’ll keep that in mind,” he hoped he didn’t sound as turned on as he felt. Tony tried to think of Steve, knowing Bucky didn’t understand what his unintentional phrasing was doing to wreak havoc in him.
Bucky just nodded back to him as these thoughts flew through his head. “Yeah, of course, make sure he's ok with it. Actually, you may even want to give it another week just to make sure he doesn’t come around.”
Tony was looking at Bucky as if he sprouted two heads as he heard Steve say, “Deal Buck. Is it ok if we start now, maybe not even a full week just a couple of days?”
After that day, things changed and evolved around Tony so fast he felt as if he was hit with it by a train. Steve had taken Tony upstairs to his floor, correctly assuming the only thing in Tony’s pantry was dust. He hadn’t wanted to take him to the communal floor since he didn’t want the team interrupting them and knew Tony wouldn’t want them to see him like this.
Tony sighed in approval as he got what he wanted. It took only a few moments for that to change to a sigh of confusion.
Thor’s friendly smile as he walked over to Steve, patting his shoulder lightly once there, was completely at odds with his words. “I’d strike whatever pieces our green friend left behind to ash.”
Steve nodded looking as if handed an important task. He dropped the tape back to the floor circling to the other side of the punching bag. “Will I need to come over there with you or can I finish up my workout from this side? I’ll be able to see what you’re doing unless it’s really complicated.”
Tony dried off and headed back into the room, giving Steve a knowing look once he saw him. Steve’s erection was dark red, borderline purple, and leaking to cum to join what had already dried on his chest. Tony poked his head back in the bathroom to get permission to play with him for a moment. Knowing he only had until Bucky reentered the room, Tony quickly made his way over to straddle the other super soldier, removing the gag and arm ties but not releasing his legs. Steve whined as his hands rose to hold Tony’s hips when the smaller man grinded their erections together. Giving a smirk Tony continued rutting against Steve as he said, “Looks like someone enjoyed themselves today.”
Bucky looked down at him smirking cockily, “Don’t worry Tony, not stopping until I bust this ass of yours wide open. Hhmm, uh yeah sweetheart, think we almost have this cramp drilled out. God, Tony, Aahh, Can feel your ass ripple all over me. Ahh yeah, need to get as deep and hard as I can to really set it off. Promise sugar, I’m about to smash this ass of yours open so deep it’ll definitely rearrange some things down there.” Bucky spun Tony around on his cock back to chest, climbing the pool wall to sit on his ankles, knees spread open and Tony in his lap leaning down. Bucky pulled Tony to his knees squatting frog like on his dick, with his torso slanting to plant Tony face down on the ledge arms being held there by Steve.
“I’ll let you feel how I push my way into him Stevie. Here,” Bucky said grabbing Steve’s hand to place them on his waist, “Hold my hips so you feel how I roll them to really break into Tony’s ass. You’ll be able feel how I move my ass to thrust into him while I’m on top of you.” Bucky raised Tony about an inch off Steve, settling them together in his lap. Lining his shaft between  Tony’s crease, he squeezed the globes together and began grinding forward to slide between them. His hands teased at Tony’s cock from their place on his waist, though Bucky’s reason for his current movements had nothing to do with teasing Tony. Squeezing the cheeks of his ass, Bucky tightened around the rapidly hardening dick he was grinding over watching Steve’s face become flush. Hard as a rock in under 1 minute, that’s what two months of your hand for company will do to you. When Bucky saw Steve’s breathing becoming shallow and rapid, he gripped Tony’s hips hard 3 times queuing the man’s next words.
Laughing Steve said, “You did, I had to listen to you about every girl you were with. Then I’d have to let them cry on my shoulder when you moved on. God,” Steve breathed out loudly giving an exaggerated look of annoyance, “You owe me so much for having to listen to all that blubbering over missing you. I was told so many things about you I never wanted to visualize.”
After asking a few questions, Steve deemed him skilled enough to handle cutting up the vegetables. He placed one in front of Tony, explaining exactly how he wanted them sliced before leaving him to his work. Steve moved around him, gathering and putting together ingredients as he mixed them into the pot on his stove.
Steve laughed softly again as he gave into Tony, pressing their erections together and making them both moan as he peppered kisses across Tony’s face. “I love you so much sweetheart, no one makes angry as sexy as you do.” Pausing in his words he kissed Tony for a moment swallowing his moans. “I want to ask you something, but I don’t want you to feel like you have to say yes. There’s no way I’m not making love to you tonight, not when I’ve been waiting so long for you to want it.”
He stopped the hard plunges he was previously giving Tony and began to just roll the smaller man’s hips on his dick as he came down from his orgasm. Tony’s previously loud moans had died down to whimpers and occasional shivers when Steve said, “That was… you two together were, God it was so hot. But, we should um… we should talk about what just happened.” Bucky let go of Tony’s waist and stopped the slow grinds he was giving him as he looked at Steve. Having taken care of Tony, he felt like he could now focus on what it was Steve was trying to say. Once he saw Bucky was no longer moving Tony Steve continued on saying, “I’m not sure I feel, I guess I’m not sure if I feel comfortable with you two… Um, being so…”
When Tony had finally glided all the way down he started to shiver from the inside out as he began riding Bucky’s dick in earnest. His cries in ecstasy so fucking sexy as they reverberated throughout the room, Bucky and Steve could only sit still and watch in reverence. Steve gave into Bucky’s request as he uncovered his dick and began giving it quick strokes saying, “Yeah, uh… Soon as he comes we can talk. Fuck, Tony baby you sound so good. God, please don’t stop, keep going till you come honey.”
Bucky raised his leg to straddle over Steve’s waist, positioning himself right behind Tony on top of Steve. Tony raised an eyebrow in questioned concern looking back. “You’re going to take care of me to right? I need it Bucky, you haven’t… stretched me since yesterday. Steve tries but he can’t… he can’t push in deep like you do in me.”
Bucky walked over to kneel between Tony and Steve legs where they sat facing each other on the sofa. He hadn’t clued Tony into what Steve had asked him to do for two reasons. For one Bucky wanted Tony’s response of uncertainty to to be completely genuine, secondly he wanted to test how far Tony would bend to give Bucky what he wanted. Giving them both a look of assurance as he crouched down, Bucky placed a hand on each of their legs but looked at Tony as he spoke. “I promise we won’t do anything you feel uncomfortable with Tony. Even if you agree now we can stop and call it a quits at any time, okay?”
Tony stared at him in disbelief, not wanting to hope for what Steve was saying but unable to deny the confidence he spoke in. “How… How can you, how would you…”
“Yeah I don’t know how he does it either. I don’t understand half of what he works on, there is truly no one like Tony Stark.” Tony heard paper rustle as Steve said, “You up for sparring? I’m about to head to the training floor if you want to come.”
He really hoped Steve enjoyed the last time he fucked Tony because, for the foreseeable future, no one was going near that ass but Bucky.
Steve’s hands came to his hips as he thought carefully for a moment, trying to find the right words. “I don’t mean that people are better or worse, I mean how people were connected. My ma and I knew the names of our neighbors and almost everyone on our block. When Bucky and I got an apartment after she died, almost the entire building stopped by the first month to say hi.” Steve stared at the ground as he laughed sadly. “Everyone knew everybody’s business, if you took a dame out for a date, the news was down the block before you were. There weren’t so many choices for everything. Didn’t have to wonder if I should buy organic or non-organic, if sugar free or fat free was healthier.”
Bucky was true to his word, he pushed in slowly barely half an inch before pulling out and pushing in a little more. While he did this his hands roamed as if mapping every inch of Tony’s skin. Sliding up Tony’s thigh’s to his waist then around to grip the globes of Tony’s ass before moving on to his chest. Small trembles made their way up Tony’s legs from where they resting now against Bucky’s shoulder.
Gliding down the hallway to the living area coming from his room, Bucky almost felt like he should be twirling a long thin mustache on his face. All of his ‘evil’ plans to get what he wanted were running smoothly without a hitch. Were it anybody but Steve, he’d be looking for the trap around the corner somewhere. But knowing how inexperienced his friend was about sex, well Bucky was far from worried. Steve probably hadn’t seen or even thought any of the positions Bucky had put Tony in were even possible for bedroom fun.
For a moment, Bucky had forgotten Steve had come to sit down beside him. It wasn’t until the other man spoke again that he remembered he had entered the room. “Guys, we need to uh… I think we need to talk about this.”
When he went to open his mouth and tell Steve this, the Dom pushed in a small piece of toast. His words were garbled as he tried to chew and get his point across. “th’ts ‘ot w‘at ‘appen… Stop shoving things in my mouth.”
“Nhmmm, Bucky yes… Uhh need you, fuck it’s so hard… want you pounding me… God, Ah just you, uhad, bang me so much better.... Mmm, never felt this good... God Bucky, want this, oh yeah, just you, Ahhh, every fucking day.” Tony came, voice yelling through the room as his body shook apart. “Fuck, Ahhhh Bucky, Yes…. Just like that, god, so deep… so far in, need it… God, coming apart… uh, only for you… Hm, just you.”
Tony shivered as heat burned beneath his skin, he always did love when his partners begged him for it. Nodding at Steve he told him to go slow. With the rush prep job, even Steve moving into him slowly was more painful than arousing. Because of this it took more time than usual for Tony to really start enjoying the feeling of Steve moving in him. Having had a huge jump on Tony, it was no surprise when Steve’s hips began to move franticly as his cock pulsed inside Tony, coming with a loud deep groan.
Bucky looked down at the man in question as he groaned out, “He will for me, won’t you sugar. Gonna be good for me and swallow down every drop?” When Tony moaned and tried to nod his head around Bucky’s dick, the last shred of Bucky’s control slipped through his fingers as he poured his release down Tony’s throat with a loud groan. He shivered as he felt Tony swallowing around his cock, throat muscles clenching around Bucky’s shaft when he pumped Tony full of his cum. With one last shudder, Bucky looked down at Tony through a desired filled haze. “You ready for me sweetheart, get yourself nice and wet?”
Steve laughed looking up to the TV and settled in to get comfortable. As soon as Steve’s eyes were gone, Tony arched forward a little more placing his hands on his knees. He began to circle faster, twerking his ass and sliding Bucky’s cock marginally inside him as he heard Bucky speak. “Hey Stevie, was sparring with Tony and God does he have some moves. The way he danced around on me, could barely keep it together. Kept doing this one roll over and over, had me sliding around so much it was really hard fighting off the urge to erupt on him and finish early.”
Steve wrapped an arm around Tony’s waist, pressing their bodies tightly together. “I see anyone touch you like that again, I’ll break their arm.”
After they finished, Bucky just shook his head goink across the hall to his room. Poor little Tony, he wasn’t getting half of what he deserved. Bucky barely heard the man, the sounds he did hear were few and far between each other. The only exception was the last; Tony’s near shout as he came made Bucky smile. It was the sound he repeated in his head when he wrapped a hand around his dick pumping into his fist until he came. Making plans to take Tony apart slowly until all of Manhattan heard him, Bucky went to sleep with an arrogant smirk.
As they boarded Tony’s jet to come back home, Bucky called to tell Tony about the apple Thor got for them. Apparently it would not only give Tony near immortality, shortening his aging to down to about a year for every day he aged now, but it would also reverse him back to somewhere in his mid-twenties. So while he wouldn’t live forever, he’d have centuries with his soldiers. Tony smiled as he thought of Bucky also telling him he was too excited to wait and was going to fuck Steve the entire way back. Slipping off his shirt and pants he chuckled at the thought that Steve didn’t know Tony knew what they did together. Anytime Tony would tell Steve how much he loved the fact Tony was the only one who got to fuck him, Steve would just blush and look guilty before changing the subject. It alleviated all of Tony’s guilt at fucking Bucky whenever he wanted to.
Tony’s Crescendo came to an end when every part of his body began violently shaking with a shout as he came hearing Bucky say, “I’m a better fit for Tony’s ass Stevie, It’s mine now.”
“I don’t know if it’s working, feels as if he’s tightening up on me.“ Bucky used his hands on Tony’s ankles to push his legs back further. Tony let out loud groans as his ass shifted up into Bucky causing his cock to hammer deeper inside. “No matter how hard I’m pushing into him, Tony just keeps getting tighter around me.” Tony could barely keep his eyes open, overwhelmed with Bucky battering into him every second. “I’ll probably have to start stretching his legs out every day to.”
Deftly switching their places, Bucky rolled over to stand, lying Tony under him as he leaned over. His hands moved from their hold on Tony’s waist to remove the remaining barriers between them. Tony stared up from beneath Bucky once he was completely bare as the soldier hands moved over his skin followed by his eyes. “Knew you’d be this pretty all over.” He touched Tony everywhere, setting fires across the skin he navigated causing Tony to whimper and arch into his palms. It seemed as if Bucky would continue forever, sending currents along Tony’s skin moving nonstop, pausing only to kiss the skin around the arc reactor.
. Perpetual Subs were your level 1-3 partners, craving full control from who they were with. They loved being a slave to their partners or having a relationship of full time power exchange. Level 4-6 Nesting Subs were the usually your homemaker types, craving rules and schedules. Like his mother who was a 5, they are balanced by always knowing what’s happening around them and keeping things in order.
Steve settled back in his chair, smiling arrogantly. “Or I guess I’ll get to prove some things after all.”
Tony snorted as he rolled his eyes. “Because I know what’s really going on at Area 51. Hacked them in the 7
Bucky smiled as he felt Steve laughter when Tony sat beside them. Steve was still smiling when he replied back, “Lucky for you then we were talking about your more recent endeavors, the past few days to be exact.” Tony’s face began to take on a red hue at Steve’s last words. “Bucky told me some things that helped me understand his side a little better.” At the questioning stare he received, Bucky gave a brief version of what he’d said earlier. When finished, Steve asked, “Can you tell me what you were feeling Tony?”
Bucky rode Tony hard, he felt every breach penetrating all the way through setting sparks across his nerves with each thrust. He felt the impacts sending him higher and higher out of the water until his back was fully laying across the pool wall. Tony moans were piercing throughout the room as he looked at Steve. When their eyes met and Steve gave him a smile, Tony could see Bucky’s rapidly moving ass pounding into Tony completely out of the water. Though trapped between the circle of his legs and under Bucky’s chest, he was able to get his arms down to grip Bucky’s ass as he powered into Tony. His cries grew to reach a fevered pitch as Bucky’s assault continued. “God yes, Bucky, keep stretching me out, right there, Ahhh, fuck… So good, nailing my ass just right… Nhmmm Oh my god, shit Bucky, splitting me open, Ohhh, almost, almost, right there…”
He was so focused on Tony that he hadn’t noticed Steve standing in the bathroom doorway until he caught movement from the corner of his eye. He saw the other man’s eyes focused on where Bucky was fucking in and out of Tony’s mouth in aroused disbelief. As if feeling Bucky’s eyes, Steve looked up at him. Whatever he saw there must of told him how close Bucky was to coming since he came toward them and sat on the bed saying, “Don’t come in his mouth. Tony doesn’t like to swallow.”
“PsychoJordan” - I loved your idea and will definitely use it in one of my next stories along these lines. Don’t want each one to be the same story with new characters so thank so much for an alternate ending!
Steve’s thumb massaged circles into Tony’s back, Dom instincts no doubt kicking in to soothe the troubled Sub. “It matters to me. I want to know, and I think you
When Bucky heard Tony’s voice he lifted his head to watch the other man pleading to be fucked. His dick grew even harder as he remembered when Tony was moaning those same words to him. Lost in the fantasy his hips stuttered forward more than he meant to, pushing his dick slightly further into Steve. He grunted in discomfort saying, “Bucky… Too much, be careful baby.”
Tony heard Steve chuckle, “Tony’s like that, all those martial arts classes when he was a kid. Catches me off guard every time when he manages to get one over on me.”
Blushing apple red Steve nodded. “Yeah… That’s, uh, why I’m coming to you.” Giving a sigh he continued saying, “Tony’s had a long list of one night stands and significant others in his life. I, uh, don’t have the experience he does and everything we’ve done has really been at his lead. He says it’s ok and he doesn’t really need that part of our relationship to be perfect but… I still want to see if I can, you know, do better if possible.” Steve gave Bucky a sheepish smile growing so red he was practically purple, “Plus, making love to Tony feels… really, really good, like best thing on this earth amazing. I don’t want to lose that… and I want to make him feel just as good if I can.”
The harsh laugh Tony exhaled with a breath was laced with pain and bitterness. He stared at the man in front of him, shaking his head he sighed thinking maybe it was for the best. Steve would leave, would move on and finally, maybe…
At Tony’s nod, Steve lay on the bed beside them. He watched as Bucky placed Tony back in the position he’d had him in at first. Steve’s shoulders were just above where Bucky sat on his legs, hindering his view of Tony somewhat. He could still see most of Tony’s torso and face. Since he really just wanted to see Tony’s face as he came, he didn’t expend the energy to move from his current position. Bucky resumed moving Tony up and down his length slowly fucking into the smaller man below him. Steve knew if it had been possible, his dick would be rock hard again just from the sounds his boyfriend was currently making. He saw Bucky’s rolling his hips to meet Tony’s, movement almost identical to how he moved when working out Tony’s cramps.
Tony was a smart man, but it didn’t take a genius to realize he was losing this little battle of wills he and Cap were having. He decided to stop doing what his father would do and took a page from his mother’s book. As the saying goes, you catch more flies with honey instead of vinegar. Tony decided what he needed to do to catch this particular fly was become his best friend. He’d get close to Steve, figure out how to get under that calm demeanor, and then go back to being the anti-social enigma he usually was.
Tony sucked hard on Bucky not wanting to lose out on what the other man promised. “Sure, Im just about finished with this,” he said waving the coffee at Steve before he chuckled, “I can’t say I need the work out but I can see why you…. Fuck, mhmm…” Bucky’s words were choked off with a groan.
, was never, and this has been happening since I was 19… Give or take a few months of dry spells every now and then.”
Nat stared at him a few moments longer before letting out an exhausted sigh. She briefly glanced toward Steve first, most likely getting permission, and then stepped forward into Tony’s space placing a hand on his cheek. “I won’t say it’s ok, because it wasn’t, but I know you didn’t mean it.” She looked to Steve again and then smiled encouragingly at Tony. “I know you were hurting, and I’m glad the reason for it’s been taken care of. I forgive you Tony, but know this …” Nat’s words were said through the same smile he was giving him previously but her tone had grown hard and severe, “If you disrespect my bond or my Sub again, I won’t be so forgiving and you’ll not be so easily pardoned.”
Shaking her head Nat gave him an incredulous stare. She grinned widely at him as she reached over to pinch his cheek as she said in a babying voice, “Awww, it’s funny you still think you’re coming with us.”
Tony had begun but was interrupted by Bucky saying, “Give me and Tony a minute Stevie, I’ll call you back in a second. I think I may know what he’s unsure about.”
Bucky continued licking Tony’s hardness with light teasing touches for a while before swallowing him down, relishing in the growing cries being pulled out of Tony. Glancing over to Steve after focusing for so long on Tony caused Bucky smirk around the cock in his mouth.  Bucky saw the man stroking his shaft, hand moving quickly along its length as he rapidly hurdled toward an orgasm. Pulling off Tony’s dick Bucky looked to him smiling arrogantly. “I know it feels good sugar but you need to tell Steve what you like so he can do it to remember?”
Finally having the arm respond Bucky pushed himself up to sit, flexing the metal fingers to make sure he was functional again. Looking to Steve who’d also taken a seat on the floor at his side Bucky just shrugged, “I’m fine now. Hit wasn’t hard enough to do damage but I wasn’t able to move my arm for some reason.”
Tony could only lie there and take nips of teeth against his lips and tongue dipping to dominate his mouth, as he was unable to coordinate any other movement except begging moans to Bucky for relief. So overwhelmed, Tony only barely registered Bucky exclaiming, “Oh Damn, fuck I’m sorry Tony, gotta stop,” and even after his brain still took 2-3 minutes to process while Steve and Bucky spoke.
Bucky growled into his ear picking Tony up and turning them to face Steve. “That’s right baby, you are all mine. I’m about to own this ass and make Steve watch us, watching me break you open on my dick.” Bucky bent Tony over to lean his hands on the hot tub ledge, grabbing his thighs to wrap his waist. “He’s going to see you loving every minute, and then I’m going to really have some fun with him.” Tony was stretched backwards when Bucky’s shoulders settled beneath Tony’s armpits. His hands wrapped around the back of Tony’s neck, lacing the fingers together where they met. The hold extended Tony’s arms unable to move over Bucky’s shoulders, placing Tony completely at his mercy. “By the end of the week, I’m gonna make him watch us fuck for hours knowing exactly what we’re doing, and you’re going to get him to do it. Telling him exactly what I want you to because I own you right baby, and you’re going to do whatever I tell you?”
It was practically evening when Jarvis finally notified Tony she was finally alone in the gym so he could talk to her. Not wanting to miss his chance after waiting all day, Tony practically ran to the training floor at full speed. When he got there, racing up to a worried looking Natasha, he had to catch his breath before he could get anything out.
“No Buck... Not that I know of. I don’t think I’ve heard him holler like this before. The cramping must have been really bad if they’re hurting him this much to work out.”
Tony was a wrecked mess of shivers and moans as Bucky fucked him slowly. His hips rolled to meet each thrust, sending tendrils of pleasure rippling across Tony’s skin. Tony’s body kept beating against the door of release, his keening moans and full body spasms coming with more frequency as Bucky continued to deny him his goal. At some point, Tony felt Bucky lean back over him, blanketing his body and raining light kisses across Tony’s lips.
Tony’s eyes were hooded as he looked at Bucky, firestorm lighting inside as he continued riding. “Ah, yeah Bucky… Nhhmm, working it in so good… God yes, Mmm, feels amazing, uh, don’t stop... Almost got it, keep… Oh fuck, pumping into my... muscle, Hmmm… Just like that.”
Bucky ran a hand down Tony’s chest over his t-shirt saying, “I need to feel him out first and see where the tension is located the most at.” His breath began coming quickly as Bucky reached his hip and leaned in to run his tongue around Tony’s lips, “Definitely need to start in right there.” Bucky pushed his sweats down each side hanging just below Tony’s ass, making him groan slightly when Bucky palmed and stroked down his hardness. “This part of you seems to always be stiff Tony; we’ll have to make sure we don’t stop until all the tension is released. We should probably even work it to release a couple times to see if that helps.” Bucky reached in his own sweats bringing his long cock out bobbing over the top at Tony. As he did this he leaned forward into him a slid the hand on Tony’s cock between his legs all the way to Tony’s opening. Tony shivered and let out a squeaky moan as Bucky began circling over the crinkled skin, grazing over the entrance. “Yeah I think we need to start stretching right here first, you’re always so tight right there sweetheart. I’ll have to work into that one slowly for a while, and I know just the right position for that.”
He lay down and I planted both my hands in the bed beside his head, he moved his hands up and down my ribs, stopping at my lower back. I smiled "Keep going lower". I went back to kissing his lips and he let his hands run down to my ass. He sat up so I was sitting on his thighs, I was starting to find it hard to breathe so I pulled away for just a second, Steve's hands came up to my chest and he tore my shirt open and threw it onto the ground.
She cleared her throat, raised her hand to her chin and smiled "Tony, what's that on you neck" my eyes shot to him "A bruise I guess, probably got it on Titan" she hmmed to herself.
It was the last straw, he would’ve swam through lava to quench burning inside him, driving Tony insane for the last few days. Hearing Bucky say he would completely shattered the last of Tony’s resistance. Closing the tiny space between them, Tony leaned to press his lips to Bucky’s opening his mouth to the other man. After Tony’s acceptance was given with his initial kiss the soldier took over completely. Bending down he easily lifted Tony’s legs to wrap around his waist as he turned to press the engineer against the wall.
Bucky growled low in Tony’s ear while Steve said, “Well at least he’s making sure you eat. You’d probably have survived on coffee without him there.”
Steve responded with a sweet smile that gave Tony butterflies. Bucky’s flirty deep voice responding ‘No promises’ and giving Tony a heated look made him turn a deep shade of red.
“Fuck yes, God Tony you feel so… Uhh, so good sweetheart.” He slipped out as he softened, reaching a hand down to stroke himself back to hardness.
“I know you didn’t, and it’s not something I feel all the time but…” Trailing off with a sigh, Bucky dropped his head. “I’ve always been too big to for most people, some girls wouldn’t even try and would high tail out of there as soon as my pants came off. Even the ones I did get to be with, I always have to be really careful about not hurting them.”
“You don’t have to do that Bucky…” Tony started, but before he could finish or move, he was interrupted by the other man.
Tony couldn’t blame him, after having maybe a couple hours sleep between each marathon, even a super soldier would been worn out.
Tony turned to Steve giving him a fond look that Steve returned before he chuckled slightly shaking his head at Bucky. “Sorry about that, I’m pretty tame now a days so you were probably bored out of you mind. Steve’s told me some of the antics you used to get up to.”
Tony’s eyes were closed as he felt Bucky piercing deep inside him, sending waves of ecstasy from places Tony didn’t know existed, when he heard Bucky speaking to him. “Fuck… Tony, Yeah baby, can’t wait to feel you suffocate my dick when you cum. Squeezing so hard, Uhh Damn…”
Tony wasn’t sure how to feel about any of this. Wasn’t sure what to think about Steve sitting in the chair across from the bed, his dick was so hard it was purple and leaking a steady stream of cum. His hands were gripping the chair arms so hard Tony could hear them cracking under the pressure. This wasn’t what was causing his current emotional and physical confusion. No, that was all due to Bucky Barnes and the words streaming out of his mouth while he was shattering Tony’s universe.
Thor clapped a hand on his shoulder saying, “I fear she is right friend Stark, you will not last the night at your current pace.”
This was when Steve called. Looking down to Tony’s phone where it lay beside them, both men saw who it was. Immediately Tony went to lift off Bucky and answer the call. When he tried Bucky held him in place answering Tony’s phone as he put it on speaker. When Tony didn’t say anything not knowing what to do, Steve voice came through saying, “Hello, Tony you there?”
Steve had fixed him dinner that night, feeding it to him by hand as he had every meal since they’d been together, before laying Tony down to watch a movie as he gave him a massage. By the time he motioned for Tony to turn over, Steve had already succeeded in making him boneless. When he finally made it to his shoulders, Tony was completely relaxed, except for the aching hard on between his legs. It should have come to no surprise to Steve when he snapped and pulled him down for a kiss, but Tony could tell from his gasp of surprise it did.
Sam confronted him "Stark". He turned around this time, Sam grinned "You and Rogers are doing it aren't you?" He went a light shade of pink "eh no, no we're not, why would you think that?". He shut off the TV "Damn Stark, I can't believe it, you and Rogers really". Tony sat down "Okay okay, please just tell me how you found out". Sam looked at me so I answered "we seem some text you sent him".
She looked back at me "Can you take a picture of all of us" "yeah sure". She got everyone together and I stood back to take a photo. They all left in a few limos. Peter hugged me "I can't believe I'm going to a real gala, Mr Stark! This is ridiculous" I hugged him  "you're a real Avenger, go have fun kid". I waved them off from the door with a smile.
The two boys were finally ready to go "Do you want me to drive Tony?" He smirked and opened the door "No I think I'm okay". There was a limo waiting outside and a driver standing at full attention by the door Peter was freaking out, he thought it was the coolest thing ever, I just smirked at Tony, who was smiling right back at me.
I don't know how it happened but I was pushed along with the group to the living room. I asked for the room and I got it. I got what I wanted, Steve Rogers alone. He wouldn't turn around. I don't know if I wanted him to. I wasn't angry with him, I just missed him.
Sitting on a bed in a large bedroom was a fourteen year old Tony Stark with headphones on playing with some electrical thing. Tony had the smallest smile on his lips.
We had gone spend the night in the secrete rooftop hot tub. I woke up next to Steve, he had a smug smile on his face while he was looking at my tablet. I moaned and sat up "I'm surprised you even know how to use that". I took it out of his hands and rubbed my eyes, opening up the daily news for him and handed it back, "Thank you". I snuggled up next to him and rested my hear against his chest.
My mouth was slightly open "But Steve doesn't want her" she bit her lip "That's why she wants you to break his heart, or else she'll expose us." I sat down next to her, rested a hand on my shoulder and sighed "Tony I am sorry about what I did, and we can call this thing off publicly whenever you want". No matter how angry I was at her, it didn't matter she was still one of the only people there for me "Pep I'm sorry too, I've been lying to myself for a really long time, I probably drove you into Rhody's arms.". There was a comfortable silence before a knock on the door ruined it.
He snuggled in behind me in my bed and kissed my cheek, "Should we tell the team" I was already starting to fall asleep "Not yet, I'm just not ready yet". "That's okay". His griped on my waist made me feel safe, and it didn't take long to drift off to sleep.
We were in Barton's 'secret' farm house. It was dark but there was a light behind the door. As we got closer I could hear mumbles. When we burst in Laura, with an obvious baby bump was tied to the bed and Clint's three children were tied to chairs. There were six masked men with weapons in the room, marked with the shield symbol.
I stood up with my coffee cup in hand as if I was going to make a speech "We can all appreciate the fact that Steve is no longer a virgin God bless America, God bless Iron man". Tony shook his head "Shut it Legalos".
"Morning Kid, what's going on". Tony asked the question but walked away, leaving the door open for Peter to follow him "Um I just wanted your opinion because, eh I've never been to a wedding so I don't know what to wear". I laughed as quietly as I could, but it drew his attention to me "Captian, Sir, what are you even doing here?".
He leaned down and pressed a soft kiss on my lips. I smiled and exhaled with happiness. "How about you shower and put, on something nice, we go out, I'll take you anywhere". I wrapped my arms around his neck "How about you take me right here on the worktop, we can shower after and order take away". I didn't wait for a response I just kissed him.
I sat down on a chair and she sat down on my lap, pulling at my lips with hers "Oh Tony, I love you, please, don't leave me". She started to unbutton my shirt, then I remembered, but it was too late "Oh my god! Tony!".
I crawled up the bed and pressed my tip against his hole "mmmm yes". When I pushed through I caught his lips with mind. I moved fast and roughly. I almost got too caught up, I opened my eyes and took a look at his face, it wasn't a look I had seen before.
I was walking down a massive hall with Bruce, he was being kind of odd with me. "So, you and Rogers are you two are good again?" "Yeah we're good, the team needs him and I'll denie it if you ever quote me, but I need him too" his tone was flat "Good, good, any ideas on what to do?".
The tip went through my little ring and started to stretch me out "Fuck yes Steve, keeping going!" "Deeper, deeper Steve!". He couldn't go any deeper so he stopped, I took this time to look at how beautiful he was and how he made me feel full, "Give me everything you've got Cap". His hands held my hips down as he pulled his massive cock out of my hole then smashed it straight back in, making me scream at the top of my lungs "Ahhh, Steve".
I kissed Steve on the lip, got off his lap and put on my shirt, but it hung open because the buttons were scattered all over the floor. I opened the door and closed the door behind me. "What's going on Rhodey?" "Come on down to the bar".
Everyone looked at me, they were all aware of what happened between us, but I still sat down on the arm of the chair. Tony appeared, he looked tired, but that's not what I noticed first, I noticed he was wearing my jumper. He cleared his throat and bent down into the mic.
"Come on Stark, sooner we find the stone the sooner we get Peter back". I closed my helmet and flew off, getting to the throne room before Natasha and Bruce.
Bruce, Rhody and Shuri all came in, followed by a few members of the Kingsgaurd. The room was getting too crowded. I went back over to my spot at the window and stood with my fist resting against it. How could they all stand here talking, catching up, while chaos was breaking out all across the universe?.
He reminded me of last night, how fun it was. For now obvious reasons, my own sex life had been borning recently. I drank a little more and then went back over to him "Fuck it". I kissed him and jumped up, he caught me by the ass, legs wrapped around his waist. He walked until my back hit the wall, I moaned as he groped at my ass "yeah, c'mon Captain, fuck me". He put me back down on the ground "what the hell Steve?".
I pinched between my two eyes "Eh Steve, we have company". Wanda was standing awkwardly by the coffee machine trying to pretend nothing happened. Steve closed over the bathroom door and yelled from behind it "I'm sorry!". I giggled "So Wanda, I think it's time I tell you that Steve and I are dating". She placed the cup of coffee on the table next to me "That's okay Mr Strak, I figured it out ages ago when his boxers and jumpers kept ending up in your laundry basket". She looked smug and left the room, but damn she did make a nice cup of coffee.
Thor was explaining exactly how this would work and how all the memories and worst fears we try so hard to bury are going to be brought back up and shared with each other. Natasha and Clint looked uneasy, but still smiled. I stood up to speak "This is not going to be easy, we are going to find out things we never imagined about each other-" Tony walked in and took a seat, my seat actually "-but regardless we have to work together and we need to find these stones. We've all lost people, we need to get them back before it's too late. Everyone grab a snack and hed off to bed, it's a big day tomorrow.".
"No problem, just one thing though, when did you two start fucking again!". "Calm down Clint" Steve said, sitting him back down "Calm down? How long has this been going on?" I laughed " two months". "You've been hiding this for two months!". "Yes and we intend on hiding it a little longer so please don't say anything to anyone". He closed his mouth and nodded "okay I won't". Clint's kids ran into the living area and jumped onto him while me and Steve slipped out.
I blinked a few times then felt an arm on my shoulder "Cap? You okay?" It was Tony. I opened my eyes and seen we were in a small living room. Thor wasn't there, "What happened?" Bruce had a frown "Thor got stabbed through the heart, his whole body turned to dust".
We started in a massive entrance of a mansion. I turned to see Natasha, but she wasn't looking at me, she was looking at Tony. He was shocked, his shouts echoed "Why did you do that!, you're such a dipshit Steve, it wasn't real you should have just shot me, I swear to God Roger's, if you messed this up because of you're little crush on me I'm going to-". Steve smiled "We got the stone". The anger fell away from Tony's face and it was replaced by an embarrassed smile.
Everyone got a little flared up "Thor remember it's not real! Where do you think the stone is, think about something that means the most to you here" Steve called to him. We all thought Thor was going to lose it and do something reckless but he took a deep breath "It has to be somewhere in the throne room, I can't think of anywhere else". Steve picked up his shield "Lead the way".
We got back a little later than we promised, but just before they cut the cake. A few guests turned in, but around midnight Pepper stood up on a chair "Who wants the bouquet?" A crowd of girls gathered around her. I was chatting with Natasha, glancing at Tony every so often, he was talking to Bruce and Clint. "What's this about?" Natasha laughed "Have you never been to a wedding?" I stayed silent "Aww you've never been to a wedding! The bride throws the bouquet and the person who catches it is supposedly going to get married next". I sipped my glass and watched the flowed go up into the air, they went over the whole group of girls and landed on Tony's lap.
I quickly jumped to my feet and ran over to the fight. "Thor it's not on there, where else would it be?". Thanos picked up Loki in his fist and got a tight grip around his neck. A moment of clarity came across his face "It's in Loki's dagger!". I looked at the waist band of the god struggling to breathe and seen the blue glow of the infinity stone.
Natasha interrupted "That's sweet boys but we need to get the last stone and we're running out of time.". Tony took a look around "yeah, I remember this, it's my 14th birthday". I laughed "Great Stark, where's the massive party?". he ignored me and went up the stairs.
"You are meant to be Captian America, you're not meant to believe in losing", I still didn't respond, what was the point of getting into a screaming match with her. I sighed softly "Is he here?" "Why don't you go find out for yourself" I got off the chair and turned around, she was crying. Natasha Roanoff, who apparently had no feeling was crying in front of me.
When I brought up Pepper I realised I didn't even check if she was alive, and then the thought of her off in all those foreign countries popped into my mind. Some might say I'm paranoid but I know what cheating look likes and that's what Pepper Potts looked like all over when she would come home form business trips. But the press was right when they stated she was the only woman crazy enough to marry me.
I waited for Steve, at long last he came out of the lift, but he wasn't alone, he had Bucky with him. "Tony I know this isn't-" I shook his hand "Sergeant Barnes, good to have you back" "Thank you Mr. Stark, I really appreciate your hard work that allowed us to be back". Steve pulled me off to the side "Would you be okay with him, maybe, living in the compound with us?" . I sighed but as I had said to Barton, we have to move on when shit happens "Of course he can Steve, he's you're best friend, and a damn good fighter". He hugged me "Thank you so much Tony, this means a lot to me".
I ordered pizza for us, and turned on whatever weird TV shows were on in the early hours of the morning. "So Kid, what's going on? Why did you really want to stay here". His eyes flinched to Steve but then back to the slice of pizza in his hand "No reason Mr Stark". He didn't trust Steve enough to talk openly in front of him.
Thor fell to his kness and shouted as we had to stand there and watch this. Loki was next in line. Just as the gun was pressed in between his eyes an arrow landed right into the back of his big purple head. Thor ran up to the podium to fight Thanos, followed by myslef and Barton.
Tony looked around "Where are we anyway?". I heard the bow click "My farm" "What's going to happen Barton?" Natasha asked "I think I already know, follow me".
He rested his head on my chest and we swayed to the music. We whispered to each other "Why is it so hard to get some alone time?" I smiled at him and pressed my lips to his forehead "Absence makes the heart grow fonder" he rolled his eyes but still flashed his smile. Pepper came over to us at the bar, hugging us. "Congratulations Mrs Rhodes" she kissed my cheek "thank you, Steve". She took Tony's hands "Thanks so much for walking me down the aisle Tony, that meant a lot to me". "It was my honour Pepper" she smiled at him like she always did, with a lot of love "Well they just put out the dessert table! I better go find my husband".
We had light and cheerful conversation but it was getting late. I whispered to Tony, rubbing my hand down his back "How about we get to bed?". He smiled, stood up and took my hand "We are going to turn in, I will see all you guys at Pepper and Rhodey's wedding, safe travels". He nodded and dragged me up the stairs.
He ran off to the get help, Shuri came back with him "Mr Stark, welcome back, how are you feeling?" I laughed "For once in my life I feel good, what did you do to me?" Shuri tapped on the screens "Well everything looks good, you've been asleep for a few days". I nodded "Where's Steve?". Peter jumped "Oh, that was his bed there" he pointed at the empty bed next to mine "but um- he didn't make it". My heart shattered, water built up in my eyes, sweat formed on the surface of my skin in seconds. Shuri waked him over the head Peter laughed "He didn't make it to the cafeteria because he heard you were awake and...". Steve ran into the room and over to my side.
We started to make our way across Asgard but half way there Thor stopped in horror. I looked up and seen Thor's father, mother and Loki lined up to be shot. "Thor remember it's all fak-" he was gone. Steve shouted "Tony, Nat and Bruce, go look for the stone, we'll handle this!". "Don't be a dumb ass, you can't take them on by yourself!" I argued, he turned around a glared "Don't be a dumb ass and follow instructions for once!".
"Tony, you know Steve is going to be here" "Yes I'm aware" she gave me a disappointed look "why can't you just make up with him! I'm not asking you to marry him but come on at least talk to him". A man with a headset on shouted: "We need you guys on stage". We lined up behind Thor  "He's happy with Sharon" she sniggered "No he's not, they're not dating, she's manipulating him".
"Oh my god! You two are fucking!" Steve's head snapped back at me, he was turning red "What! no we're not!" I smiled "Yes you are!". Scott scrunched his face up "Oh my god, Captain America and Iron Man doing it!".
He rolled out of bed and straight into the bathroom. I stood up a little while later, as I stretched the mirror caught my attention. I strolled over and took a look "Holy mother of-" "Oh my God!" Steve was standing in the doorway he ran over to me "Tony!". My whole body was covered in bites, hickeys and scratches worse than the ones before, even my wrists were marked I hmmed. He ran his hands along my body "I'm so sorry" "I'm not" I grabbed his two shoulders and turned him around so he could see the scratches I left in his back.
"I'm ready, please!". Being inexperienced he couldn't tell I wasn't but I was deseperate. He unbuckled me from the bed but kept my wrists bonded together. He sat up on the bed "Steve, I want to ride you, please, it feels so good" I asked, he smiled back and nodded "Do you need me to take that off". I smirked looking at my wrists "no I can make this work". I threw my hands around his neck and sat down gently onto his massive erection "Mmmm Steve, god I love you" I couldn't believe what I had said, it caught me off gaurd, causing me to slip further onto his dick, he moaned "mmmmm what did I get so right to deserve this".
Peter nervously stood next to MJ, not touching her. He had borrowed my purple tie to go with her dress. The top was V neckline and beaded, and the bottom was poofy. I could tell the kid really liked her and by the smile on her face, she liked him too.
For the last three weeks Steve and I had been secretly dating, and it was amazing. The element of danger just made it more exciting for us, and the fake arguing. Things had changed in the short space of tim.
The cold air hit my face, he pulled down my tie slowly. We were on a rooftop, but there were fairy lights and roses, a comfy sofa, and a hot tub. "What is this Tony?" He smiled "It's my secret little relax area, no else knows about it, except for Peter, I set him up for his date here". I walked over to the edge, of the roof, you could see the lights from the city but not the noise "what are we doing up here".
The door swung open, Natasha and Bucky came crashing in, pulling clothes off each other and kissing. I moved back, Tony whimpered but it was drowned out by Bucky's moan. We both pulled up our trousers and closed out belts, I cleared my throat. Natasha yanked her hand out of his trousers and they both look up "Oh- sorry- em" Bucky scratched his head, I smiled at him "I like your new hair cut Buck" "Thanks punk". I took Tony's hand and pulled him all the way from the room to the dance floor.
I went back to the workshop. Natasha scared the shit out of me when I turned around and seen her standing behind me. "Jesus Nat!" She was wearing a navy halterneck dress, fishtail and a lace train, her blonde hair in perfect curls. "Wow...you look fantastic
Steve was trying not to laugh, but I smiled at him, Fury sighed "Just get down here!". It went off and I moved up and down on Steve "Fuck Steve, this is perfect". The direct line came back on, but it was a phone call for Steve "Captian it's Director Fury". "Rogers here sir" his voice was clear but I had to cover my mouth with my hand "Did I wake you?" "No Sir" "Good, I want you down at HQ this morning to work on the trainees". I moved, causing him to moan a little "I-I'm sorry Sir, I can't do it today, I'm doing some time at the children's hospitals".
“No, it’s something I really need so we eventually broke up. Still looking for the right person that’ll let me take them apart and give me total control.” Swallowing loudly, Tony was glad he soon found the wiring mechanism he didn’t have on hand to replace in Bucky’s arm. He definitely needed space from extremely sexually attractive man. Knowing this Tony delayed in making the order for 4 days and when finally placing it, chose the slowest delivery option possible. It’d probably take 3-4 weeks before Tony received the parts and hopefully he’d have his head on straight by then.
He only halfway acknowledged the Dom beside him. As he began asking the usual ‘Get to know you’ questions, Tony fired back one or two word answers paying nearly no attention to him. It was then Tony realized he hadn’t been with anyone in months. He couldn’t even remember his last time he even thought about bringing someone home. No wonder he was so fucked up in the head about Steve lately, he seriously needed to get laid soon and stop thinking about things he couldn’t have.
grade after watching Roswell, can bet your ass it’s not fucking aliens there, that’s for sure.” Turning back to his work, Tony started to dismiss Steve. “As you can see I’m fine so shew, I’m on to something.”
Steve grabbed Tony’s ankles to hold them out beside Tony’s head. “Like this, or do I need to move them?”
Tony opened his mouth to respond be had to bite his lip when Bucky moved as if adjusting his seat causing Tony to bounce minutely on his cock. “Its fine Stevie, you look wiped. Tony’s already told me I’m hitting his problem areas. I don’t mind continuing my magic and working him over some more.”
When the bartender brought him back his drink, instead of leaving Tony began to flirt back with the other man. He tried to remember what he said his name was. David, Damian, Daclan … Whatever, it was Da-something, Tony could make it work until whoever he was had served their purpose. He wouldn’t take the other man home, Tony didn’t do Dom’s, but he knew playing as if already taken always attracted more attention.
Tony moaned as he nodded around the head of Bucky’s cock that was still in his mouth. Bucky handed him the lube, letting him get his fingers coated without distraction before he began to fuck Tony’s face in full. Tony lost track of everything except keeping his throat open and stretching himself open like Bucky asked. He felt free in a way he never had before knowing Bucky would take care of everything, he’d tell Tony what to do. Tony wouldn’t have to think about anything but giving himself over completely into the other man’s hands. Tony began to feel as if he was weightless, his body floating and charged in anticipation. Every word from Bucky’s mouth just drove that feeling higher until all Tony was completely focused on him as the rest of the world fell away.
Tony refused to look Nat’s way as he sat down uncomfortably at the other end of the table, as far away from that murderous gaze as he could possibly get. After a few moments of tense silence, Steve returned sitting a plate in front of them both as he sat. Resting his elbows on the table, he stared at Tony for a minute before asking, “Tony, don’t you have anything to say to Nat?”
Tony glanced at Steve and saw him turning a bright shade of red as he guiltily stammered out, “It’s not that...” When Bucky gave him an ‘I call bullshit’ look he finished saying, “It’s not just that. I like to bottom to and Tony doesn’t really like to top.”
Tony could see Steve physically pull himself back to the present as he gave him a genuine smile. “That’s what I mean, I miss walking down the street and knowing everyone I saw. I really,
“What!? Tony… No, the team was worried, we haven’t seen you in days and…” Steve shook his head while he spoke, looking at Tony in mild shock, “Do I even want to know why the first emergency your brain went to is a zombie apocalypse happening?”
The ride to the Tower was long and uncomfortable. Tony made his way to bed feeling a sudden surge of exhaustion. He was tired of…
He sobered to some degree, laughter gradually dying in his throat, when he took Steve’s expression in fully. Judging by his current features, Steve was very unamused and just shy of slightly furious. His hand went under Tony’s chin to lift his gaze, making sure he had his full attention.
Steve rose to stand sporting his Captain America mission parameters accepted face, as he bobbed his head in acceptance, “OK, yeah that’s a good idea. I’ll give it a little time then ask if we’re still having problems.” Giving Bucky a smile and wave goodbye he left saying, “Thanks Buck, I really appreciate this. I’ll let you know if things change or what Tony says if they don’t.”
Tony whimpered when Bucky pushed inside, grinding down into Bucky’s lap. “Tell me something baby,” Bucky began as he moved his finger sliding in and out of Tony, “You love how I make you feel right? Love all the ways I take you apart?” Tony nodded his head but was unable to make a sound as Bucky pushed another finger in. “Don’t you want this all the time, anytime? Do you want to deep inside you every night,” Bucky pushed his fingers hard in Tony, rapidly repeating the movement 2 more time, “and every morning. Making you scream when my dick is nearly in your stomach.”
He talked the other guy up, giving out sultry pouts and teasing touches as he looked around the other patrons. Tony quickly scanned through the other faces to see whose eyes he had drawn, and whose attention he wanted to keep for the rest of the night. When raked across the cute brunette switch a few chairs over, he knew he’d found his winner.
In a matter of minutes, Steve was gone leaving Tony alone with the man wreaking havoc to his wellbeing. Having thankfully removed his feet from Bucky’s lap when he sat up, Tony just leaned his back to the couch keeping their distance. It was already bad enough he was going to be alone with Bucky for days. Being near him right now while he was still trying to compose himself would be even worse. He would have left entirely if it wouldn’t have been rude. Normally he wouldn’t have cared about that, but for Steve he needed to make Bucky feel welcome.
Moaning into Bucky’s kiss, Tony’s body shuddered at the lack of effort it took Bucky maneuver him. Bucky’s tongue dominated its way through Tony’s mouth before massaging it with his own. The way Tony’s mouth was being devoured, as if Bucky was marking his territory by touching every part, caused his hips to shift forward seeking relief. He was so lost in sensations that Tony didn’t notice Bucky moving them. Bucky broke their kiss when he sat on the edge of his bed, Tony still wrapped around Bucky straddling his lap. Bucky gently removed his shirt before moving to undo the button of his jeans and pull at the zipper.
“Shit,” Tony said dropping down beside Bucky, leaning back and covering his face with both hands. Bucky left Tony to his thoughts, knowing the genius would come to the only possible conclusion.  “We’re going to have to play along with his plan for a little while, there’s no way around it.”  Tony knew if he refused, then Steve would feel rejected thinking Tony didn’t want intimacy between them. All attempts to connect physically would be strained from that point on, with Steve thinking Tony wasn’t enjoying what they were doing even if he actually was. Taking his hand from his face Tony looked at Bucky saying, “One week, then you pronounce us cured or whatever okay?”
“Do anything… whatever you want… feel so good. Uhh, Bucky, all yours… Give you anything.” Tony managed stammer out around the moans coming nonstop from his mouth.
Tony had already been on edge for 5 days, it didn’t take long before he began to try and maneuver Bucky where he wanted him. Tony’s attempts to draw Bucky’s body down to his didn’t even disrupt Bucky in his task.  Tony couldn’t move the man a millimeter; it was like pushing at a wall. All other efforts turned out the same, Tony couldn’t move himself or Bucky to get any type of relief. It wasn’t until Bucky was caressing the inside of Tony’s thighs that he got the man’s attention. When Bucky nipped the skin with his teeth, Tony’s cock began leaking desperate for attention. Tony reached to take care of it himself but before he could complete the motion, Bucky’s hand intercepted. Placing Tony’s hand back on the bed, Bucky glided back up Tony’s body and leaned in to kiss his lips.
Steve looked happily over the pair. “Glad Bucky is able to help you with your soreness so well. But uhhh… Bucky,” Tony’s eyes widened as he looked up with a tremor of fear as Steve gazed down at Bucky’s arms leaning beside Tony’s legs at the edge of the pool, “Don’t you need your hands to help stretch him out? How does it work if you don’t use them?”
Laughing Steve managed to break Bucky’s hold, the latter still not waking from his sleep, to release Tony. Once free again, Tony slipped quietly from the bed to get cleaned up and wash away the remnants of last night. When he finally emerged from the bathroom 30 minutes later both men were still asleep in his bed, although Steve’s eyes did open when he entered. Holding out his hand Steve beckoned Tony back to him.
Tony always missed Steve when he was gone on long missions. He always slept better with the other man beside him; the nightmares only coming once or twice a week. The only silver lining to Steve leaving was that sex wouldn’t be an issue for a few days. Tony had given him a blowjob last night and pretended he was too tired when Steve tried to reciprocate. Hopefully when he returned, whatever it was going on with Tony would be over and they could get back to normal.
“Alright Stevie, once he’s positioned here you need to grip his legs about here.” Bucky gripped Tony’s upper thigh under where his sweats were lowered to expose Tony’s ass. Not knowing what Bucky’s intentions were, Tony let yelped ‘Ahh’ as he was lifted from the ground. Bucky held his legs to the wall, Tony’s hips in line with Bucky’s shoulder and his face in front of Bucky’s groin. “When you get him up here in front of your face you can start applying weight to where he needs it.” Tony could feel Bucky’s breath blowing across the skin of his exposed entrance making him whimper.
“I just want you to enjoy making love to me the way I enjoy it with you. Bucky’s agreed to show me a few things that might help,” Steve stopped minutely at Tony’s lips parting in a silent gasp when Bucky’s cock pulsed inside the fabric. He thought it was due to his words and stuttered out quickly, “He doesn’t have to, uh, touch you or anything if you don’t want. He can just, you know, sorta watch and guide maybe?”
Chuckling as well Steve gave his agreement. “Yeah, he’d stay in his lab for days if I let him.” Bucky used the hand wrapped around Tony’s neck to push him down onto Bucky’s cock, freeing the other to wrap around Tony’s. Unable to hold back, a gasp the sound squeaked out of Tony. Luckily Steve thought it was because of what he said. “What Tony, you know it’s true.” Bucky squeezed at his throat prohibiting any further noises. “Anyway, Bucky and I were trying to decide if we wanted to go out
Steve was usually soft and loving, even when really going at Tony he didn’t really fuck him so much as make love to him rougher than usual. But, the way Bucky was manhandling him, holding Tony down and making him take every inch of his dick with every thrust made Tony realize even an old playboy can discover new kinks. He didn’t think he’d like to be pushed around, made to take whatever his partner was giving him, but damn if Barnes wasn’t driving him to new heights doing just that. “Yes Bucky, so good… Fuck, so good. Don’t stop baby, harder… God please don’t ever fucking stop.”
“There wasn’t much info out there about what I was when I presented. I had to look through dozens of books on orientation before I found one that had anything substantial.” Tony gave a dejected sigh as his mind reluctantly traveled back to the days his world fell apart. “It was about a scientist who gathered a few Level 10’s together for a study back in the 70’s. You already knew about the Dom traits we have, most don’t. None of the Sub’s in the study could fully submit or go into subspace. Because of their Dom traits, they couldn’t ever let themselves give up enough control to do either. No matter what the doctor tried, no matter what level Dom he paired them with, for years it never happened.”
Even as they ate, Steve made him cut his food into pieces, specifying the exact size he wanted each item to be. Tony couldn’t manage to not roll his eyes when Steve started to feed him those pieces while asking him to explain how Jarvis worked. Before he knew it, he’d told Steve that and about building his other bots as they finished up their meal.
Movement from the corner of his eye drew Tony’s gaze to Steve, who was arching back and groaning loudly behind his gag as he came all over himself. Bucky laughed darkly as he watched Steve’s orgasm and said, “It’s no wonder you weren’t able to cum with him Tony, not if he’s always ending things that quick. Five minutes after you left he came and I had to have him suck me off. Little Stevie was too sensitive to let me keep fucking him like you always do.” Tony saw Steve shudder and his cock twitch, obviously highly aroused at the degrading words spewing from Bucky’s mouth. Tony began rolling his hips below Bucky, trying to get him deeper inside. “Ohh, God yeah baby. Love the way you move for me. Gonna make Stevie watch us fuck all day, tied to that fucking chair... Uhhh, wishing he could fuck you half as good as I do.”
They were both still fully clothed, cock’s hard as nails from grinding against each other for nearly 20 minutes, when Steve finally broke the kiss to gaze heatedly down at Tony. It took a few minutes for Tony to come back to reality and he only did so because Steve chuckled at him while dodging Tony’s attempts to bring their lips back together. Steve gave him another peck on the lips before saying, “It’s been so long since I was able to be with you like this baby. I don’t want to push you but I really miss having you under me.”
Steve laughed quietly at Tony’s words before he bent down to kiss his forehead. “Not tonight sweetheart, you’re not ready yet.” Letting go of Tony completely Steve rose from his couch looking down at Tony from where he now stood. “I do want to make sure you don’t have any drops from this,” Steve just smiled at Tony’s rolled eyes, as if just this would cause him to go into subdrop, “So I’d like for you to sleep in my room tonight…” When Tony’s eyebrows rose along with a smirk, Steve drew out his next word. “…
When Tony opened his eyes, he saw in Bucky’s gaze the focus and concentration he had felt in his hands throughout everything that was happening. Tony saw Bucky watching and cataloging every spot that made Tony shiver, every brush against his skin that made him gasp as he just grinded inside Tony, not really slipping at all. Hands still caressing their way across Tony’s body, Bucky gaze lifted to meet Tony’s as he gave his patented cocky smirk, “God Tony, it’s like you were made to be fucked. I don’t think anyone could look as sexy as you do with my cock inside them.” Tony’s eyes fluttered as he shivered and clenched down around Bucky’s length.
Once the initial shock wore off, Steve began to pull away from Tony’s mouth. The move was aborted when opened his mouth and licked at Steve’s lips. After that, Tony was no longer the dominant force in their kiss, or at all for that matter. Steve groaned into his mouth, deepening the kiss as his full weight settled between Tony’s legs. His tongue swept forcefully into Tony’s mouth while his hands pulled Tony’s wrist above his head, trapping the sub beneath him.
Tony leaned back, taking in Steve’s stoic expression. He knew the Dom meant every word he said. He also knew Steve would hit the ground running as soon as Tony told him what he wanted to know. No… That was wrong. This was Steve he was dealing with. He would no doubt spout apologies first, giving Tony looks of pity before he made his escape. This why he never told anyone, Tony didn’t want their sympathy or their pity.
Snorting Tony crossed his hands over his chest grinning at Steve, “I see you’re trying to butter me up before you make your demands.”
Tony narrowed his eyes at her and was going to sass back at her before he remembered why he was here. Not willing to waste time and be interrupted, Tony blurted out, “I need help getting Steve to fuck me.”
Bucky gave Tony a smirk turning him around and sliding him onto his lap. “But you told me no earlier Tony,” Bucky whispered, hardness sliding through Tony’s crease pulling a whimper from him. “You won’t let me have my fun with Stevie, even though I know how hot it makes you.” Tony was lifted as Bucky placed the tip of his cock to Tony’s opening. “Are you going to tell me no again Tony? I can’t let you have this…” Bucky said pushing the tip in slightly into Tony drawing a whimper, “If you can’t give me what I want. I’ll leave the choice to you, baby. If you lower yourself down to take me… Know that I own you, and you’ll need to do anything I ask…”
He stopped at the edge to watch Steve and Tony on the couch. Both were fully clothed, Tony in his sweats and Steve in thin track pants, with Steve lying down knees bent bouncing Tony up and down in his lap. Although Bucky had told Tony to set the scene up for him, the possessive beast inside still growled at Tony in anyone’s lap but his. It was only his conversation with Steve this morning that tapered the slight aggression Bucky felt when he saw them.
We all took seats around the long table but it was useless, none of us knew what to do, after a while the Queen arrived "Thank you all so much for your help, please, stay hopeful, my son would not want you to give up. We have rooms for you all on the fourteenth floor, I'll see you all soon". Thor thanked everyone and took the Racoon with him. Little conversations broke out in the room but I just sat at the table trying to get a grip.
He went straight towards the common area while I readjusted the hoodie statically placing it over my hard. "Oh Cap, I thought you would have gone with everyone else to Washington?". Steve sat down and put on a hoodie "No Pete, I had to make sure Tony actually remembered to go to the wedding".
Suddenly everything was quite, I couldn't hear anything anymore, it was silent and everything was black.
It was not re assuring one bit "Tony are you stalling? Are you waiting for us to break up so you won't have to deal with the media?, Do you see a future with me?". He turned around and stared blankly at me, I sat up on the bed "Tony I need to know that we are going somewhere, I can't be in a dead end relationship, do you see a future with me".
It was rushed and full of lust, I pulled off his t-shirt and bit at his exposed skin, then took off his trousers and boxers. He stripped me without needing to open his eyes from our kiss. I shoved him back and bent him over the bed, pressing my hand against his shoulder blade. I crouched down "Tony Tony Tony, you are such a tease, how long have you had this in" I could tell by his voice he was smirking "All day Captian".
"Oh Come on Pepper! I know what you get up to on all those company business trips, I'm basically paying for you to go screw a bunch of men". She sat down, not denying it. "For once in your life Tony you're wrong. It's just one man" "what?" She was on the verge of a smile "it's not a bunch of men, it's just the one man" "Who?" She looked away from me "Who is it, Pepper?" "Rhodey.".
He mumbled "Fuck, okay, please listen to me, I am this close" he pressed his fingers together "to getting Steve to trust technology with more intimate things, and I really need that before I start going on business trips again, so please, do this one thing for me, I'm going to call Steve up here, I'm going to make out with him and you two are going to walk in". I looked at Sam, and copied him when he stood up "Okay Tony, but only because I know you make him happy".
When his feet stopped moving Tony had a scenes of urgency "Okay my heart stopped, start looking". The four of us tore the room apart, Tony got frustrated and kicked over the locker.
None of us moved, we just listened "Oh mom is trying to deal with my discipline again? Better work up the fake tears now". Howard had an evil smirk "You think I don't know that you're high right now? That's an insult Tony" "so what if I am, what are you going to do, beat me?". Tony turned his face to the wall and sighed, I offered him my hand which he took.
As Thor attempted to free Loki an arrow landed on his belt and it fell next to me. I quickly scrambled for it, and didn't even here the shout. I smashed the handle of the dagger with the rim of my shield and seen the blue stone shinning.
He thrusted in and came without any warning, he looked up and let out a breath "Fucking hell Tony, you feel so good" I gasped, out of breathe "Steve Rogers did you just curse!". He pulled out, but I could see he wasn't done, I sat him down on the mattress and climbed onto his lap so I could ride him. I squated over him and began to whisper in his ear "Sit back, relax Cap, let me take care of you".
More wedding shenanigans went on up until three in the morning. The whole team stuck together as we stumbled up to our rooms. "Night everyone!" Tony yelled when we got to our door. He was quite drunk.
The three of us caught up with Natasha and Bruce. They were in a close hug. The two of them pulled apart and we followed Bruce upstairs.
Natshas smiled at me as I walked over. The team cheered, I was standing behind Steve so he didn't see me, but I placed my two hands on Sharon's shoulders, I leaned in, close to her ear "A moment please Ms Carter". She excused herself with a polite smile. Pepper gave me a sly look, I winked back, without noticing Steve was staring at me.
I knocked on the door softly "Come on in". Pepper had her back to me, her hair was up in a bun and she was in a beautiful blue dress, similar to the one that we first danced in together, I stared a second but her voice caught my attention "Tony?". I looked at her, my eyes fell on her, and I was a little shocked.
Steve wasn’t the most rhythmic of people. He knew moving as Bucky was currently or like he did that day on the hot tub were nearly impossible for him. Hearing Tony’s mounting cries, seeing how he was loved every stroke Bucky made inside him, made him whish he could. Steve knew he should probably be jealous, and a small part of him was, but even that feeling only increased Steve’s arousal. He did wish he could hear what Bucky was murmuring into Tony’s ear since it seemed to drive loud moans from him. The faint words he could hear being said were all but drowned out by Tony’s loud sobs, his cries echoing throughout the room of “Yes” and “Please”. He was turned on to the point he wanted to feel Bucky taking him apart like he was Tony. Steve wanted to feel everything Bucky was making Tony feel, wanted to know what Tony was experiencing that made him yell and moan in ways Steve had never pulled from the man before.
"Come on Steve, we need you with us up there", her head gently touched my shoulder "No you don't, you need a leader, and I am certainly not a leader". Bruce was awkwardly standing by a tree kicking the dirt at his feet. Nat looked up at him and then back at me. Her face was soft but she had a broken smile "You'll freeze out here and we don't have another seventy years to spare waiting for you-" Bruce interrupted her.
It was Natasha and Bruce. Natasha was in one of his jumpers and he had his arm wrapped around her. When she saw me she sat down next to me and threw her arms around my broad shoulders.
I had been battling the thought of Tony for a while, the truth is as soon as people started to disappear I thought of him. I couldn't stop wondering had I missed my last chance to make up with him. The ship was no guarantee that it was Tony, Bruce had told the team Tony ended up on one of the ring ships with some wizard and Peter. My heart was sinking further and further into my stomach as I walked towards the Wakanda castle.
I finished inside him, untied his wrists, and took the cloth away from his mouth. He rolled over and had the look of total bliss on his face. He kissed me softly "I can't control what you do to me Tony". He ran his hand down the back of my neck and smiled at me "then don't".
Peter and Michelle sat back down, he tried his best to avoid eye contact with me and focused on the game. Steve dipped his hand into the bag and pulled out a car key. He looked at me and I sighed, taking his hand and getting into the closet.
He gazed into my eyes for a minute before I titled my head and went back in for his lips, I dragged my hands from the back of his neck down to his crotch, I smiled into the kiss as I felt the hard in his boxers. He wiggled his tongue all over mine, driving me crazy. Then there was a knock on the door, we ignored it, "Tony, are you in here?" It was Rhodey, "Can you come back later?" Steve stopped kissing me "Tony, I just want to talk to you for a minute" I rested both my hands on Steve's broad shoulders and sighed "Can it wait until tomorrow?" "No Tony I'm getting married tomorrow!".
I got home first, Natasha pulled me into the workshop straight away. I started to sift through my mail on a screen, while she lingard "Come on Tony give me some details!". I smiled "It was a pleasant weekend, we went hiking and sat by the fire and made passionate love at night" she grunted "How I would love to see that, Tony stark doing boyfriend things" I swiped next "Well if you want photos, Steve has-". I stopped, my hand fell from the screen. "What's wrong Tony?".
"Who's this Strange". Tony laughed "A wizard, kind of a jerk, but I needed to push someone's buttons while you were gone". It was too hard to look at him, his big brown eyes brought back all the memories I had been avoiding for the past two years. "I am sorry Tony, about it all, I didn't want to leave you".
"There you are boys" Natasha appeared "We're waiting for you two, Bruce you didn't do a great job at finding Cap, he's already up there". Bruce laughed "Tony is just such a handful!". We started walking behind her "Speaking of Tony being a handful, did you and Steve work things out?" my breath hitched and she noticed "Eh yeah, we're getting there".
Engaged, he could tell I was shocked "You didn't know?" I smiled a little "I didn't even know you were dating anyone, I guess I'm a little behind on the news, we didn't get wifi in hiding" "I'm surprised you even know what Wifi is, but yeah I'm engaged to Pepper" of course he is, the perfect girl for him.
"And what if I did mess it up, what would you suggest I do?". She stood up and touched her hand off my face "Do whatever you have to to get them back, Tony if this guy makes you feel this miserable because your not around them that's not just a crush, that's true love". I raised an eyebrow "How did you know I'm gay?" She shuffled around and showed me her ring "Myself and Cindy are getting married next month, I guess it's a gay thing".
We waited until they were on the sofa and down each other throats. Sam whispered "I guess it's go time". He shoved me into the room and walked in after me "Oh my God!" He shouted. Steve pushed Tony off his lap and looked right at me, I panicked "Steve, what are you doing here?" "Oh um..." he sighed "Bucky I'm sorry I didn't tell you...but me and Tony, we are". Tony grunted "We're dating, cool? Okay let's go back up stairs".
I threw the stack of paper off the desk "You've got to be fucking kidding me, Rhodey, you just had to have an affair with my best friend! How long?" She was getting quite, not making eye contact "How long have you been sleeping with him?" "I don't know". I took her face in my hands "No more bullshit Pepper, how long?" "Since we were on that break...two years ago".
The lobby was empty, I turned my head both ways and pressed the lift button. When the doors opened a group of women and men got out and sat down at the desks in the lobby. I changed my mind and began to climb up the stairs, I couldn't risk walking straight into a room with Tony in it.
It was coming up to our six month anniversary, and finally the day I had been waiting for, Tony was holding a press conference regarding his position as CEO. It was going to be a hectic week, he had to go on a four day business trip, and then it was time for Pepper and Rhodey's wedding, Tony went back and forward about if he would attend or not, eventually reaching the decision that he would. I won't lie, I hadn't seen either of them in quite a long time.
Crowds of photographers greet me, I smile and wave politely but get into the car as fast as I can. There are more big crowds at the hotel, that ensured me no one would know the board meeting was happening there. Thankfully my security got me up to my room and stayed posted outside it.
I left the two of them alone and started to make some food for the drive. Tony came down a little while later in a suit "That kid will be the cause of my death someday" I smirked "You love him", he rolled his eyes "I hope one of those sandwiches has tuna on it". I packed the food into the bag "I guess we'll have to wait and find out". I pecked his lips and headed for the door.
"Sorry, that was kind of stupid of me" I mumbled, keeping my eyes on the road. Tony was stretched out with his feet across the dashboard "No, I think it was hot". I looked away and seen him smirk.
Peter started moping, I felt sorry for him, he probably felt like May didn't have enough time for him now. I ruffled his hair "we have a long day tomorrow, why don't you head up to your room". He didn't move, he was squinting at something in the chair Steve was sitting in. Steve came back but before he could sit down Peter grabbed whatever he was looking at, handcuffs "Who the hell owns these" Steve snatched them off him "Natasha".
Once again we were left standing around the room, waiting for something. Then we got what we were waiting for, Tony, age fourteen, tied a rope around the bar across the ceiling and into a loop around his neck. He calmly stepped off the chair and strangled himself.
Natasha was the first one to find me. "The queen gave us all rooms for the night, we are going to start making plans in the morning..." I raised my hand to my chin but didn't move "There are no plans to make, we lost" I didn't get up from the chair, or even turn my head from looking out the window. She started to shout.
I picked the phone back up and punched in Steve's code, the last four numbers of his dog tags. ,"Oh my God Sam! What did I do!". Sam spit coffee out of his mouth, the screen was some sort of porn, it was of a man, tied up, with a gag in his mouth and a cage around his penis. Sam took the phone off me and got rid of it.
When I finally swallowed it was with a load gulp "Yes, I'm still going with that" "Seriously Tony!" I shrugged my shoulders, it didn't impress him, he got off the sofa and stood in his usual pose, asserting  his dominance "Tony, there is no way the other night was the first time you did it with a guy, which means you've slept with more guys than me" he left his hand sticking out at his side, I finished off my snack and wiped my hands "and so what if I have?".
He began to read me the sports headlines, I groaned "Get to the business news already, or lifestyle, or anything else". He tapped the screen "When will Tony Stark return as acting CEO of Stark industries" I laughed "Next" "Tony Stark spotted with yet another girl, and three explanation marks, and a photo of you and some blonde girl" "That's Alisha, she was a student at MIT, I paid for her project development and now I want to but shares in her company". Steve nodded  and swiped to the next story "Mr Rhodes and his future Mrs set wedding date-".
I followed him into the lift and wrapped my arms around his waist tightly hugging him "You play cap?", I brought my head down to his and kissed his ear "I'm just happy, I love you". He placed his two hands over mine "I love you too".
I sat back in my chair in shock, it was Tony last night, but with who, probably on the rebound from Pepper. Then I looked at Steve, his neck scratched. I literally jumped out of my seat.
I killed the time by doing small jobs for Pepper, but finally, it was time to take our seats. The barn had fairy lights strung up and it was beautifully decorated with flowers. I sat a few rows from the front in between Clint and Thor. Tony stood up at the top of the aisle behind Spencer as Rhodes rocked back and forth. A little while after everyone had been seated the doors open and Pepper's niece began dropping petals onto the ground. I stood and turned my head as Pepper's sister walked up the aisle, followed by Maria Hill and finally Natasha. Pepper walked through the doors, alone. She hesitated for a minute and looked from side to side. Before starting to walk Tony appeared at her side and took her arm under his as they strolled. She was in a lace dress with a long train, her hair tied back with curly bits falling down from it, she looked beautiful.
"Hey Friday" I didn't get a response, "Friday?" Nothing,  "Come on, why aren't you talking to me?" Still silence. I got off the ground and pottered down the stairs to my workshop to figure out what was wrong with my AI.
He was being rough with me but it just made me harder. We got into a room, he pushed my back up against the wall and kissed me passionately, I finally opened my mouth and let him in after a bit of teasing. He threw me onto the bed and tried to take off my trousers "Hold on solider, I'll show you mine if you show me yours". His perfect face turned a pinky colour as he unzipped his suit. His body was still as good as ever, perfectly shaped. I slipped out of my trousers so we were just left in our boxers, mine silk and his, starred and striped.
He kissed me, it was perfect, just a cute kiss, when he stepped back we both giggled. I sat down on the sofa with him and he handed me a glass of bubbly and the strawberries. I took a big sip and bit into the chocolate covered fruit, I could have sworn I was in heaven. We had a small talk but it turned dirty quite quickly.
I knocked on the bathroom door, it opened slightly and he pulled me in. He didn't say anything, just stared at me "Tony-" of course, now he started to talk "What were you doing with Sharon in my room" it hurt that he thought I was seriously doing something with her "I could ask you the same thing, she said you and Pepper were in there". He scoffed but then his expression changed and let me talk "And she was just showing me your business documents" I put emphasis on the 'your'. "My what? what are you talking about?" His face was soft, "it doesn't matter...Steve, believe whatever Sharon told you, it doesn't matter, hooking up with you was a mistake".
We had just watched Natasha shoot her own father. I couldn't help but wonder if that's how it happened when she was a child. I didn't have time to think though we had to figure out what to do next.
I sighed "Damn it, I took Steve's phone when we were sparing". I put it down on the table and went back to my pancakes but Sam was still staring at me "Dude you have Steve's phone, let's have some fun!" "Like what?" "Like send weird ass emails to people" I nodded and put down my fork "That does sound fun".
My body was pressed against the wall and my hands were pinned above my head by one of Steve's. His other hand held my hip against the wall and Steve's face was less than an inch away from mine, teeth clenched and eyes turned dark blue. He growled lowly "Don't test me Stark!". I almost had him, just to seal the deal, I spit in his face. He smirked with a hint of evil in his smile.
Rhody had been talking to me but I didn't hear a word he said. Then finally Bruce said it, "Steve" my head shot up. I had been so close to calling him before this all happened and now Bruce was telling me he was right here.
Rhodey and Pepper went with green, her dress had collar that rested just off her shoulders, you couldn't tell she was pregnant because there was no belt around the dress, it just flowed to the ground.
Before Steve could say anything, our Natasha went up to the man "I'm sorry Papa". Bang. We had only turned around and she already had the glowing red necklace in her hand, and tears falling from her eyes. She crushed it with the but of her gun and wiped the tears away.
He took my hand and held it in both of his. Peter laughed "You guys are best friend goals". I smiled at him "Guys can you give us a minute" they left and closed the door. Steve kissed me softly on the lips "What happened?" He ran his fingers over my cheek and down my neck "We did it, everyone is okay, Peter Quill, he said he knew you, he brought Peter back and we handed over the stones, they killed Thanos, he's really dead Tony. The rest of the team is here, you're the last one to wake up". I smirked "I needed my beauty sleep" he caressed my chin "You're beautiful enough".
I sighed and put on a smile and made our entrance onto the stage, taking a seat next to Steve. While the presenter talked Steve mumbled "Good to see you're still alive" "Good to see your girlfriend is still here". I glared at Sharon sitting front row with a smile. Tension went to his jaw "she's not my girlfriend! And last time I checked you're still engaged".
"Maybe you would know the plan if you cared to attend our meetings" he stood up and took off his glasses "Excuse you, I have other important things going on here" I looked up at him "yes, like making out in closets". Pepper jumped "Come on boys play nice" Tony didn't look at her, he kept eye contact with me and raised a hand to his ear "Friday, bring them in". Cases rolled into the middle of the area where the rest of the team sat silently.
I woke up a little before nine and nibbled on Tony's neck, he mumbled "well good morning Captian" I smiled at him "We have to get a move on". I rolled out of the bed and took my suit out of the bag. Tony sat up on the bed and watched me get dressed with a smirk. I threw my balled up boxers at him "Go get dressed" "Can't Rhodey has my groomsman suit" I widened my eyes "Groomsman, you got upgraded".
"Yeah, just a basic one against mine, we are half-siblings, I'm in the middle of getting confirming it now". She was still lingering "Natasha, what's going on" she brushed it off "Nothing, it's nothing" "what about things between you and Bruce?". She slouched, that was it. "Not great, he still thinks I'm sleeping with Bucky". Friday's voice filled the room "Sir your test results are back". I looked at the computer and then back to Natasha "What are you going to do with him?". She laughed "Tony open the results!".
I turned the phone screen down and covered my mouth with my metal arm, I felt uneasy. I could guess that Sam felt the same by the look on his face. The phone buzzed again "Don't do it Sam" there was a silence "I have to". He turned the screen around 'You said you'd take me anywhere tonight right? Date night? Well I want you to take me...in the shower, or maybe the kitchen, how about right in the middle of your gym, just something to think about ;)'.
We all met outside the castle in front of the ship. The queen and Shuri were there to send us off. I thanked them and hugged Shuri "I promise we'll get him back" we pulled apart "please Captain, don't make promises you can't keep" "I promise".
He left after a short while gathering things. I spun on my heel to see Steve smiling, he pulled me as close to his body as possible "I love you too Tony".
"Sorry to interrupt". I panicked and pushed Steve away, it was Bruce. The two of us turned pink "Bruce I can expl-" "Save it Tony, I don't want to hear the whole 'it's a one time thing speech again', you promised me you weren't going to start fucking your team mates!". Steve looked to me "What's he talking about?". I put back on my t-shirt but stayed silent.
I open the door and feel like closing it again, but I don't, I just leave it open and walk away. I go over to the bar and pour myself a glass "What do you want Christine?". She laughs "So you remember me after all these years?". I turn around "Christine Everhart Vanity Fair Magazine". She closes the door over "Well not anymore, believe it or not, I'm a legal secretary for Stark industries now". I sip my drink as she talks "No I believe it, my company doesn't hire anyone without telling me".
I answered the knock on the door, it was Happy, he was surprised to see me, "Steve, hey, could you give this to Tony" "Come on in". He stepped into the room and placed the suit next to Tony on the bed. "So Harold, did you bring May?" He looked at Tony "Yes I did" "oh yeah, and how are things going there?" "Great, Peter isn't too happy about it though, how about you two?". Tony looked at me and smiled "Excellent, a lot better if you could get some time alone-" "I'm going to stop you there, I don't need to know any more, just get your ass dressed and then get Rhodes up" "yes sir".
He kissed, sucked and bit at my neck, going from side to side, driving me crazy. He swooped lower and kissed just above my erection, teasing me as he moved back to my nipples, tugging on one with his teeth "Oh God Steve! Talk to me" he moved back to my neck, nibbling on my soft spot "fuck that's good" "You like that" he bit a little harder "Yes Yes Yes!" "That's it Tony, scream for me". I caught my bottom lip between my teeth, not wanting to give him that satisfaction.
I covered my whole penis and lined myself up with his stretched out hole. I slowly moved my hand down his back, trying to relax him before I pushed into him.
Bruce, Wong and Thor were totally silent. Natasha was the only one joining in on the fun, Tony sighed "Do you guys really want to know?". Everyone replied, even Bruce, Wong and Thor "Yeah" his shirt fell off and he showed off all the bruises and bite marks. I whistled using my two fingers and Natasha cheered.
He brushed past me and back into the room and took his bottle "Well Cap, she seen your work from last night" he lifted up his shirt to show the bites and bruise "and it led to a small argument". "So she was with Rhodes?" "Yes," he took a long sip from the bottle and put it down. He walked over to me and ran his hand along my bearded jaw. I leaned down to kiss him but he pushed me away "I don't like the beard Cap" "Well Stark you enjoyed it last night".
I came thrusting into his mouth. I got up and threw him onto the bed "fifteen minutes Cap", I lifted both his legs up using one of my hands, leaving his ass exposed. I sprayed cream from where his balls lay down to his hole and threw it onto the floor. I grabbed each leg his a hand and spread them wide apart so I could see his face he was biting his lip aggressively "Cold?" He nodded. I sucked on his balls, making him forget about the coldness, slowly I moved my tongue down lapping up the cream. I got stuck in when I came to his hole, it drove him insane, he grasped at the bed and moaned as I flicked my tongue and his hand ran up and down his erection. He came just like that. I lay flat out next to him "We have five minutes, shower?" "Hell yes!" I was stern "just a shower Tony". He was already at the bathroom door "whatever you say, Cap".
Hickeys, bite marks and bruises, all over my body. She got off my lap with tears running down her face "Who did it Tony, who are you sleeping with?" "Pep it's not like that!" She sat down, still angry, still crying "Well then explain to me what it's like Tony?" "I-I can't". She wiped a tear "Of course you can't, just another stark secrete right?" I sighed, rubbing my eyes "Pepper-" "Don't! Just tell me who it was, Natasha?"
Shuri was adjusting my new gloves when Tony marched into the lab "Rhodes!". He sped towards him and his fist hit Rhodey right in the eye. Rhodes stumbled back, almost losing his balance "What the hell Tony!". I didn't move at first, no one did, but as Rhodey got back to his feet Tony hit him again. I ran over and grabbed Tony, locking his two arms behind his back "Let me go, Cap!" Rhodes was bleeding now "Tony what's wrong?" Natasha asked, bewildered by what had just happened.
"All five of you will be fitted with the finest stark industries tech for this mission and, with the help of Shuri, the best Wakandan tech, so suit up and get down to the lab". They all qued up except for me, Natasha got hers first, then Clint, Thor and Bruce. My case, marked with a star was left sitting alongside Tony's.
We got into the dining hall for the dinner party. We were at a table with the rest of the team, they were happy to see us, and I was happy to see them.
We wrapped up day three just before two in the morning. I undid my tie and threw it on the bed, I had worlds worst headache. Then there was a knock on the door, typical, as soon as I send the security guard to get me take away someone finds my room.
I turned back to the living area, Peter was fast asleep on the sofa, I pulled a blanket over him and placed my hand over his head, my phone pinged, it was May "I'm sorry, I hope he didn't crash date night! He doesn't know about you two, do you want me to come to get him?". I reassured her he was fine.
After Clint found out about us we were more careful. I hung around with more women in the public eye and me and Steve had more 'fights'. On the romantic side of things, me and Steve had never been better, he was doing more research into the world of modern sex, after I showed him what a incognito browser is.
Well it wasn't my nightmare, we all looked around at each other "This one is mine boys", Natasha walked out the door first, Bruce and Steve followed close behind her.
Everyone laughed but I quickly moved them along to go find Rhodes. It took an hour but Thor and Cint managed to find him, he had gone to get coffee and doughnuts to sober up. The small crisis had been diverted, Tony let out a sigh of relief and kissed my lips softly "I'll see you later!".
She pulled me into a small room. Probably the equivalent to a normal world supply closest. She kissed my lips and glided her hands down my back "I missed you Tony" I kissed her nose "I missed you too". Her hands shifted from my lower back to the front of my belt, she had an evil smirk "I was so terrified you were gone forever when you got on that spaceship, you need to stop doing stupid stuff like that" "Well then I wouldn't be me, would I?". Her hand dipped deeper into my trousers. I kissed her lips slowly, I don't know why we kept up this happy couple act, but I knew that Pepper was the only woman in the world who I could marry. Just as the kiss got deeper the door opened.
My forehead crinkled at his consideration. Fury let him go, he lay me down on my back and got us both off. I hopped out of bed and got dressed. I was ready to sit through painfully long business meetings and then at the end of the week, watch my ex-fiance marry my best friend.
I glanced down and smiled seeing the blue of his arc reactor hit against my dog tags but I couldn't help but wonder am I more to him than just sex, and will he ever "be ready" to come out to the world. I was hopeful, but hope breeds eternal misery.
Clint had on black trousers, a white shirt, and a white jacket that had black lining and a black tie. His hand was resting on the small of Laura's back. She had a black fishtail dress on, it had white sparkles starting at the waist and they ran up her side into a collar.
I crushed the eyes piece and out came a orange stone. I smiled for just a second and closed my eyes. The last thing I could hear was Steve yelling "Bruce!".
Bruce ran in from the living area, he looked at the man on the ground to his mother and back to me. Suddenly I was the one of the ground being bet up. By the time I got to my feet Bruce's stepdad had his mother out on the balcony.
Even in an illusion we were no match for Thanos, I was thrown off to the side while Thor and Clint still faught. I heard Tony's voice calling me "Steve, it's not here! We've looked everywhere and we're running out of time". He showed me the orange lines growing up Bruce's arm, if they were complicated Bruce would be wripped away.
We all needed to be linked together and pretty much cursed then the stones would choose to hide in our darkest memories. If we couldn't find a stone in the time we had...well let's just say I couldn't imagine losing another team member.
I pulled my shield out in front of the team as the shouting got louder but Bruce walked straight past me. No one had even noticed little child bruce in the corner with a tattered sciences book, it melted my heart.
I started to cry, I had learned to never cry in front of people from a young age. Howard never tolerated crying but when Steve wrapped those massive arms around me, it just came out "I'm so sorry Tony, I'm so so sorry" I didn't know what to say, there was so much I had to tell him "Peter's gone" he pulled me closer to his chest and stroked my hair. We stood like that for almost half an hour. Then I came to my scenes, stopped crying and pulled away from him
Bucky hands reached underneath Tony grabbing the back of his shoulders as Bucky lifted him off the bed. Tony’s legs were still trapped between their bodies as Bucky’s arms held him in the air. It all became too much, Tony’s cock began to let him know it was coming  with or without help in a few moments. When Bucky started thrusting into Tony again, his eyes rolled back moaning loudly from Bucky maneuvered him. Using the grip he had of Tony’s hips, Bucky began lifting Tony across his length, ramming him up and down. “Gonna fill you up with my cum.” Each movement now hitting Tony’s prostate hard dead on, Bucky said to Tony, "I’m keeping you, not letting you go. Say it Tony, say you’re mine.” He punctuated each word by slamming Tony down on his cock.
Tony bit his lip to keep back the moan wanting to rise up when what Bucky had said registered. Looking down he saw what the soldier had meant, that there was 3 inches of Bucky’s dick that he hadn’t put inside Tony, he knew he was well and truly fucked. He already felt so full, as if Bucky was everywhere touching everything inside him. He hadn’t realized he’d spoken those words out loud until Bucky smiled down cockily at him as he pulled out leaving just the tip of his dick in Tony. “Not yet sugar, but I’m about to be.”
Bucky chuckled into Tony’s mouth at the loud whine that escaped him for being denied his goal. “Sugar, if you need me to take care of something for you, all you have to do is ask.” Bucky accompanied his words by leaning down to rub his length between the cheeks of Tony’s ass.
Tony took more of it into his mouth using every trick he knew to work his way down. Bucky was spewing a steady stream of curses and admirations at Tony’s ministrations. His words only pushed Tony to give more, take more, fighting his gag reflex tooth and nail just for more of  Bucky’s praise. Tony was so lost in what he was doing that he didn’t even register how much of Bucky’s dick was in his mouth, how much he had down his throat, until Bucky held his head to keep Tony from moving back up. Looking up Tony met Bucky’s gaze with a questioningly look.
Tony’s eyes moved to where Bucky was sitting. While his hand was nowhere near his dick anymore it was still standing straight up at attention. As Steve moved from the bed to make his way over, Bucky leaned back getting comfortable and spread his legs. “Want you on your knees for me.”
The only answer he received was the vibrations of Tony’s moan traveling through his shaft, breaking the tenuous hold he had on his orgasm. The feeling of Tony trying to swallow around Bucky pulsing in his mouth drew even more cum, prolonging Bucky’s orgasm. After Tony had wrung him completely dry for the time being Bucky pulled him up into a kiss, barely tasting himself due to being so deep in Tony’s throat as he came. Both men were shivering, Bucky from the aftershocks of his own orgasm and Tony from being on edge for so long, when Tony broke their kiss.
Chuckling quietly Bucky said, “Proximity can always be an issue.” Tony couldn’t help but glance up at the other man as Bucky leaned back down further in his chair. The movement caused Bucky’s legs to drift forward widening Tony’s as well since they lay outside of his, and bringing his crotch inches away from where Tony leaned in working. The smirk Bucky gave Tony was downright sinful, causing him to shiver faintly. “But I’m sure a smart man like you wouldn’t have trouble getting what you needed. Almost positive that imagination of yours could come up with,” Pausing to lick his lips as Tony eyes followed the movement , Bucky’s gaze traveled down Tony’s body pushing his legs marginally wider as they did, “Multiple positions, making it easy to hit all the spots you wanted.”
“But…” Tony sputtered giving Steve a playful wounded look, “My shoulders, attention remember. You have to show attention to attention junkies, it’s attention junky rule number 1.”
Bucky could feel his balls beginning to draw up, signaling his release as he let out a rumbling groan into the room. “Fuck yeah Tony, uhhh… You always know just how to take me baby. Feels so good sweetheart, I’m already about to come. Know you didn’t swallow for Steve, but you’re gonna swallow my cum aren’t you sweetheart? Gonna swallow every drop like you swallow my dick, not missing any… Oh fuck, Aren’t you sugar?” Bucky asked as he gripped the back of Tony’s neck and began thrusting into his mouth.
“Hmmm, you are right sugar. I did promise you a good time,” Bucky smirked up at Tony as he reached a hand into his sweats taking out his cock, stroking it slowly once it was free. Bucky’s metal hand slid down into his pocket taking out a small tube Tony was positive contained lube. Bucky then grabbed Tony pulling him down to lay across his lap face down, knees almost touching the floor. Tony heard the tube open just before Bucky palmed Tony’s ass inside his jeans, slick fingers tracing down the crease to Tony’s opening.
Everyone felt the change in their relationship the next morning. Tony awoke slowly, blinking his eyes open to take in where he was. His sleep addled brain took a moment to make out the body beside his as Steve quickly enough, it was the body on top him that was causing Tony confusion. When he turned his head and registered that it was Bucky’s body trapping his own to the bed, the night before came rushing back to him. Bucky had kept good on his promise and had kept fucking Tony throughout the night bringing him to not one but two more orgasms. He barely remembered his body trembling from exhaustion and over stimulation when he finally just passed out and went to sleep with Bucky still moving inside him.
