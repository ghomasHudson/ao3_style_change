Anthony love: I think it’s because I instinctively pick up on child abusers. I’m dispatching Suarez and Cruz to deal with Ruby. I would send Laura, but she was kidnapped by Clint 2023. Also, from what Deke told me they probably could all use a therapist or 6.
Purple Arrow: It’s not about that. You don’t know what I’ve done these last five years. I’m not a good person. I’ve never really been a good person, but now there’s too much blood to even pretend.
“But you needed proof first?” Leo asked.
May: I’m going to take that as you don’t want to tell me about your deep and meaningful conversations with our daughters’ future stepdad.
May: I should be the one to come with you because she knows me.
Tony: We are still on for dinner tonight with the MIT crew. Also, despite knowing Vaidya technically longer than he’s known me, Rhodey Bear says we can’t tell him who you really are for national security reasons. So you have to pretend that you actually were married to our fellow classmate. I’m sending you a dossier to memorize. But hey at least you’ll have something to do now.
Rogers: By the way, do you want me to not tell your husband about getting arrested earlier this week?
Me: The image of Pepper crying was taken about 10 minutes after she found out who Anthony’s boyfriend really is.
“So, do you think Dr. Simmons will regret suggesting massage as a way to be intimate without sex when she gets my biometric readings?” Tony asked, still high on Steve. He wanted to lie next to Steve and enjoy the moment, but he was also oily and sticky and Steve kind of pushed him into the bathroom to clean off. It’s a pity he was pushed into the shower alone, but it was probably for the best. He is going to have to deal with one cranky scientist when he gets back.
Anthony: The Ross problem has been handled or at least mitigated without resulting in bloodshed, mostly because General Glenn Talbot hates Ross as much as the rest of us do and decided to use bringing Shield under government control to undercut the Bastard. The Army Air Force rivalry has worked out in my favor in this case.
“Let me just read you what I have. And you can tell me where I’m going wrong,” Steve said reaching for the nano paper.
Anthony: And I have you.
MJ: Although, I thought they weren’t actually married. It was a cover identity. I always knew time travel was possible.
Tony: You know I have a new AI because Friday had to save Coulson’s ass and that requires her to be a real girl. So now I’m training Ana, who team Monkey Lover, the Princess, and Skye Quake created for me. She’s based off of Friday but with some modifications.
Who do you think HRH is?
Anthony: Therapy is going well. I’ve been approved to put Avengers 3.0 together as long as I follow their 300 draconian regulations.
Me: Except if I can’t talk to you for a few minutes at least every few days, I may go a little crazy and approach the super villain threshold. Snookums is aware of that and has the negotiations justification ready to go if necessary.
Me: Is that a good or a bad thing?
Me: I feel better that you’re not out there driving back this late.
December 1, 2016
Me: Apparently your boyfriend has food allergies and ate the wrong thing.
“Do you want to save the rest of these questions until after we switched drivers?” Steve asked.
Tony: Totally. I feel like that would be a better way for you to come out publicly then let’s say a non-consensual sex tape. That’s such a Captain America way to do it.
Anthony love: Although maybe Agent America will go for a different body part then you. I feel there are some body parts that you would be really upset if she attacks.
Cuddle fiancé: Because that’s the only way May would be married to someone else now. How did he die?
Melinda: Also, don’t answer anymore of Laura’s questions.
Tony: When it comes to you, the first thing that comes to mind is that old Prince song, ‘I would die for you’. That is definitely the Steve Rogers version of friendship. Loyal to the end. Are you familiar with that song? Or is this one of those times where you have no idea what I’m talking about?
Cuddle Bunny: Laura told me when I talked to her a couple of days ago. I finally decided that I should see someone professionally. She’s trying to arrange that.
Melinda: She was a high school guidance counselor, at least the Laura we knew.
“We’re just going to have to take it one thing at a time. And you can’t fix everything." Steve reminded him. "But knowing you, you’re going to still try.” Tony snorted.
Me: What?
Anthony: I am really looking forward to testing out the healing powers of your ass. Oh, the things I want to do. How do you feel about whips and chains? I assume you don’t have any lubricant allergies?
Subject: I really did keep my hands to myself.
Ana Jr.: Yes, the stones still exist. James Leopold originally wanted to destroy the one they retrieved from Vision, but Robin said not to.
Me: Speaking of things that you can’t or won’t talk about, why the radio silence after the fall? I would've liked to have known you were still alive before I got the baby blanket.
Me: We really have to come up with different names for you two.
Nomad: I didn’t say love. It’s just a crush. I think he’s over me or trying to get over me. Friday sent me the link to the video Best Thing I Never had the day before we started exchanging text messages. She followed up by sending Tears of a Clown after we started talking to one another.
Tony: OK so I’m kind of having a crisis of conscience and since you are Mr. Paragon of Virtue I need your help so I can avoid another fuck up such as killer robots or Siberia.
“I question the again part of that question because I don’t know if we were really close friends, to begin with. I think we were keeping things from each other. But I want us to get there this time around. That’s what I want to tell you. Which is why I finally told you about Pepper yesterday.”
“They didn’t overcome it. They dealt with it, and we didn’t.” Tony regrets that so much at the moment.
Melinda: Friday took over the conversation when Laura arrived here, letting her know that Tony was no longer part of the Avenger network. Although apparently, he’s kept that number for Morgan to make phone calls on.
This is an interlude chapter, but as you know, the interludes are where the best plot points happen. In this case we’re going to start to explore why some things are different in my timeline. This conversation happens to take place near simultaneously to Tony’s last conversation with his Stevie bear.
“OK it’s clean. And no we’re not here to arrest you. The boss just wants to talk to you. Mr. Hogan was supposed to be part of the conversation but he’s not ready.” Agent Davis explained.
MayMQ: I hope that's the case. Maybe he'll cancel his trip
Thank you to everybody who read or reviewed the last chapter. You are all wonderful. So, Spider-Man: Homecoming has just premiered in North America and I watched yesterday. I really did enjoy it. I will be incorporating some elements from the movie in upcoming chapters, but not for at least two weeks. (This chapter was already written prior to me watching the movie). Okay, some things from the movie have already happened in this universe, essentially the bank robbery that was in all the trailers.
To: Riley_Parker
“What is the question, sugar pie?” Tony asked.
This chapter takes place just a few hours after Clint and Steve finish their conversation, but before Clint makes his way to Palau. Therefore, Tony doesn’t know that Steve is recovering from injuries yet.
“Buttercup is a perfectly acceptable pet name. Although if you prefer, I could go with DILTF.” Tony remarked.
Pepper pot: Oh, good, we will have brunch.
Me: Point.
“As well as forwarding me the text messages.”
Red phone: Who was your first?
I’ll send an update when I can. I don’t want people to know that I have any type of communications device. And by people, I mean my Asgardian roommate.
“The consequences of Radcliffe not being exposed earlier. It won’t happen this time,” Leo replied darkly. “He’s right, by the way.”
Red phone: Just for that, she's not getting her Vision communicator for another month.
Monkey lover 2: Yes. I have an idea what’s going to happen in the next couple years, although the purple thing that she is drawing is new. I also have an idea of what we need to do to keep it from happening. Lots of destroying of old Hydra tech and investigating Talbot’s future replacement. Maybe I can’t keep the world from falling apart, but at least I can make small differences like making sure Baby Bird isn’t overwhelmed with visions of the past and future.
Me: I’m getting ahead of myself. Let’s backup to before the incident. Sky Quake tipped off Yo-Yo about three days before the gala that somebody connected to SI was making nice with the Watchdogs. She uncovered some odd transactions between an SI server and various banks, but no idea who was in bed with them. The whole thing was enough to make us cautious.
cup this morning.
Red phone: Of course they were because Jarvis was awesome like that.
Counselor Laura: So not to alarm you but a version of my estranged husband just popped up in my living room with a new tattoo that covers most of his arm and midlife crisis hair. He also says that he is from the year 2023.
“Shush. Don’t wake up Parker.” Flash admonished.
StarkAE: Okay, I‘m the first to admit that I have a lot of issues. But I‘m working on them. I don’t want to strangle Barnes anymore. I want to burn the last remnants of Hydra down to the ground, but most homicidal desires related to the Winter Soldier have been dealt with.
“But I’m not Fitz. I have lived an entire different life. Also, I’m not sure how I feel about a somewhat incestuous threesome.”
“Hydra being responsible for that might actually turn out to be true. At least that was what Zola told us when he was stalling for time.” Steve reminds him.
Anthony: Well, the existence of it already got leaked to the press and not everybody is happy that I'm starting a nonprofit for inhuman/gifted children. Now I’m Watchdog target number one. Since the grand Wizard of hatemongering politicians is going to be there, Coulson thinks I need protection and Director Snookums agrees.
Me: Were there threats made against my kids?
Me: That doesn’t mean I’m not going to try.
xxxxx
To be continued.
Blue phone: At least it's not unrequited. I'm supposed to pass on Wanda’s regards again to Vision.
Me: It made you believe that the future wasn’t written in stone.
Cuddle fiancé: When you’re not briefing the president.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Can I speak to Tony while you’re setting that up?” Steve really wanted to know what was going on with Bucky.
Tony: Already back at the New York apartment which doesn’t have kids running through it because they’re all at the compound and will be there indefinitely. Rio is watching me like a hawk even though she doesn’t start for like another week.
I also found out recently that this fic has a page on Tvtropes. https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Sandbox/IHopeYouHaveUnlimitedTextMessaging
Anthony: You don’t get to decide how somebody else feels about you. Sometimes I wish I could. My childhood would have been a lot easier if I could just make Howard love me.
Purple Princess 2018: That happened?
Purple Arrow: So, what’s the next phase of this grand plan of yours?
Cuddle fiancé: That’s nothing new.
Tony Potts: What about you?
May: I know. I’m sorry about that.
BITC: I feel like you’re slowly falling into the human category.
Anthony: Yes, but the search is going badly. I’m desperate enough to go to Jane for ideas.
Anthony: Weird home accident when I was nine involving a footstool and trying to change a lightbulb.
May: I never told you about the stuff I did at the Academy? I was a legend at Shield Academy. Not that people could prove what I did. Although I regret not doing worse to Garrett.
OK, now I’m sincerely regretting that we didn’t try doing this by email in the first place. That went so much easier. It’s not that I don’t want to know the answers to these highly invasive questions because I really do want to know you as much as possible. If we’re going to make this work long-term, we have to share our true selves with each other. And we’ve definitely been doing it with this activity. The problem is, we are absolutely horrible at keeping on-topic. If we were doing that last section by text message, I would’ve asked you all types of questions about your James. One of us would’ve misunderstood and it would’ve all blown up in our faces. See, this is much better.
Steve: I think it’s time for you to ask anyway.
OK, let’s begin with our three “we statements”.
Anthony: You're getting good at these little pep talks. Don't worry I'm still drinking a rum free Coke. The good stuff with actual sugar.
I have one chapter to upload while I’m on vacation at some point and then the vacation hibernation will really began.
“Okay as fun as this team rebuilding exercise has been, I really would like to get to the ‘build a compass and find the EMP’ portion of the exercise.” Tony said as he wounded bigoted number nine in the leg. That was about the time that Piper and Davis made it into the room. Kudos to Fitz for redesigning the ICERs to being impervious the EMP pulse. They quickly knocked out the remaining evil puppy.
Actually, I was afraid you were never going to send a letter. It’s just like with your art. You were never satisfied and you would hate whatever you did, no matter how good you really were. I guess that hasn’t changed since the 40s. It’s comforting to know that not everything is different, even if I wish your self-esteem had improved in the interim.
Tony: So, you probably heard by now that Laura from the Good timeline managed to get multiple text messages from home. Because the princess and multiple Leo Fitzes are alive there. Apparently, they managed to perfect trans-dimensional text messaging in under 24 hours.
Image 3: Steve’s nude drawling of Tony lying on the floor of the penthouse with his legs strategically placed.
Anthony: I’m completely on board with that.
Counselor Laura from 2023: Thank you. That would be useful. I feel like I missed a lot.
"It rarely does when you're grieving," Steve interjected.
Thank you to everybody who read or reviewed the last conversation. You are also fabulous.
Counselor Laura from 2023: Tony is with me but not your Uncle Tony. He's a little different. He has his own daughter [redacted].
Tony: Well, first of all, I spent a lot of time trying to figure out a way not to die. When I realized that wasn’t going well, I gave a lot of money and art, mostly art, to the Boy Scouts of America as part of a shaming activity. I was going to try to convince them to let LGBT members in. Something good for the community before I die. At least they’re getting better and my dead body wasn’t necessary.
“Yes, sir.”
Nomad: You’re kidding?
Next Saturday is fine. Also, I’d rather have him working at SI then coming home covered in bruises. That happens less when he’s working with you.
Anthony love: So, there is a chance we may be dealing with alien doubles again with teleporting abilities. Remind me again why I took this job? Oh yes, to get you back in the country.
Tony Potts: That doesn't matter. We could just plop you back in your own timeline seconds after you disappeared.
We are back in the bad timeline, and we will be for a few chapters. But I don’t think you’ll be that upset about it because we have a lot of Steve Tony stuff.
Tony: Sitting in my car as Sasha, my new chauffeur, drives us to Manhattan while Yo-Yo tries to schedule a midweek booty call with tall, dark, and axe wielding before Agent Mack begins scouring the world for wayward Inhumans in the Helicarrier Jr.
Me: I get that considering where I am now but I have still made contact a few times with Linda. What about the Heart?
Steve: I wouldn’t go that far yet. We did some icebreaker game from the New York Times. 36 questions that lead to love. They’re ridiculous. But apparently, it’s how our other selves worked through their problems.
Counselor Laura: That does not surprise me at all. I think I hear him and May yelling in the hallway right now. I also hear Simmons crying. I am also 99% sure she’s drunk right now. I would know.
Me: You mentioned that several times last night during our video call.
HSBF: That doesn’t seem so awful.
Anthony: Where was I during these clandestine movie nights?
However, things are very different in this timeline because of the butterfly effect. The Princess is there for one thing and she brought back up. Also another thing, everything is happening at the future West Coast Avenger facility. ADIA is also long gone and Radcliffe is behind bars. For those of you that have watched these episodes, you’re probably wondering how things will go without them there. Well, Leo and the Princess have a plan.
“I don’t think the minibar has any protein bars, but we have cake.” Steve says, offering Tony one of the slices he got for himself.
Steve: Because we can’t wipe out all the kids born in the last five years out of existence. We’ve been focusing so much on bringing people back that we didn’t think about what would happen when we did it, did we?
Tony: With several months texting each other back and forth and lots of therapy.
CoulsonPJ: It wasn’t your fault.
“Are you going to try to fit me for a prosthesis again?” James asked. She tried earlier but he wasn’t ready.
Me: Visual voicemail only. Let Stefan see it to, so at least there is a witness if I go missing.
Venom: Will he let you miss school the next day? We are not coming in tomorrow. We are supposed to come back Tuesday, but I don’t know if MJ is ready. If she’s not going, I’m not going.
Genius Princess: Of course not.
Me: I was actually thinking Romanoff.
Thank you to everyone who read or reviewed the last chapter. Now it’s time for something very different.
“Probably." At those words, Flash reached across Peter to squeeze MJ's hand. Peter ignores how close they are to him or tries to. The spider senses are working on overload, picking up their increased heartbeat and the smell of the perfume that MJ’s wearing and Flash’s cologne. His body feels on edge.
Number one May: Don’t forget to use protection. I don’t need grandbabies yet, and nobody wants chlamydia. Trust me.
The New Consultant: After a long conversation with my friend, we concluded that I will be the one making a move because he’s an idiot. He is adorable but an idiot. If I want anything to happen before the end of the world, it’s on me.
After two days with Loki, I really want to strangle him, but understand I may be food for the locals if I do so. We barely escaped that fate by working together. I used my powers to protect us, but he manipulated things, so we didn’t end up in the gladiator ring. Being the excellent liar that he is, somehow Loki managed to get us in the house of the ruler of the planet. This whole planet seems like a mix between Vegas and the Hunger Games.
I also wrote the chapter long before I saw all season seven of AOS, but I love how this turned out in hindsight.
Just a quick note, I’m going to have to go out of town for a family emergency for a couple of weeks. If I can finalize the next chapter before I travel I am going to post tomorrow. After that I will not be updating until I get back. However, we have so many chapters to get through before Endgame comes out, so I probably will just post a few chapters closer together to make up for weekends when I cannot post. The story is done, it’s just going through proofreading and polishing right now. Also, I apologize if I’m not able to respond to your comments personally. I really do enjoy all of your comments.
“That doesn’t mean I actually like doing that. I prefer action.” Now that he did not find surprising.
“More than one incident involved enough coke to probably get charged with trafficking. The 90s were a bad decade for me."
Subject: Re: Seriously, Tony! Call me!
Nomad: I said a decent explanation. I’m glaring at my screen right now.
Purple Arrow: What happened?
“That was so much easier than being in a car and trying to talk to you. I don't even think I would even try if I didn't know…" Tony trailed off, not sure what to say next.
FRIDAY: I'm sorry. The phone's sim card has been removed from the device. I no longer have a connection.
Me: You’re such a sap, it’s adorable. Yeah, I want something similar except no SI stuff and no work crisis. Just us together all day, nothing possibly going wrong. Bonus points for the fact that I am now allowed to engage in sexual activities. The doctors, Simmons and Suarez gave me the green light a couple of days ago.
Friday: Text allows for greater exchange of data through the window. But I will see if video clips can be transferred through.
Nomad: Bruce before he left.
Blue phone: I'm sure I can ask Sam.
HSBF: Very well.
“Shush, sweet pea. My turn. Most people thought I was at another school until Obadiah leaked the truth to the press. Which really should’ve told me right then how much of a dick he was, but I didn't see it at the time.”
Monkey lover 2: I have orientation in 10 minutes. I’ll see you tonight.
Me: No.
“So, are you going to ask me how your other self ended up engaged to Tony Stark?” Because honestly, Laura has been waiting for that question since she got here and realized she was trapped in this “Tony and Steve are morons” timeline. She’s expecting it since the guy came across a picture of him making out with Tony. There’s a lot of pictures of Tony and Steve kissing on her phone. Lila tended to borrow it to take photos of her uncles whenever they got to see them. Usually in Malta. The family spent a lot of time in Malta over the last year.
Me: Exactly. Besides if I can keep Tony Stark from self-destructing post-Siberia, I think I can help anyone.
Cuddle bunny: That was apparently stopped by someone else this year.
"Yes. At the time, I thought it was because he loved or at least cared about Bucky more than me. Now, I know it's because he cared about me so much that he didn't want that blood on my hands. I get that now but not at the time. I have a lot of unresolved issues related to my parents' murder that I'm just now starting to work through."
Me: This has happened before?
I am positive what she is drawing is a future attack on Wakanda. I would know my home anywhere. Even if it was drawn in colored pencil, by a small child. The change in what the young Sparrow was drawing coincides with the distraction of Adia and the arrest of Dr. Radcliff. When asked why she was drawing this purple creature, her only response was to earth wasn’t going to crack anymore. “The mechanic fixed it and now the general won’t happen.” I have no idea who this general is, but I know I must be prepared.
Pepper pot: I’m never telling them that. I would prefer not to get locked out of the company before Morgan is old enough to take over.
“OK, 20 feels like a rehash of 16, especially the way you answered it, so let’s move on,” Tony suggested.
Purple Princess 2018: That’s a good idea. Will her knowing that her fiancé did not die but sent back in time and created a new timeline help?
Me: Can I come back even if I can’t sign the new version of Accords?
Tony: 2 ½ actually. He gets out the day before his 18 birthday.
Blue phone: I'm sure wherever she is she can take care of herself.
Anthony: Now that your self-righteous yelling is out of the way, can you tell me when my ex threatened to kill you?
To be continued
Nomad: Because she realized that you're just as human as everyone else despite how much money you have in the bank?
Tosha: Stark is here. We are having an all-hands meeting in the lounge in 15 minutes. He brought Steve’s shield and Hunter’s cookies. Hunter does the best chocolate chip cookies. Steve always brings some around after playdates.
We are again in the bad timeline. This makes sense because we will have three days in this timeline before we meet back with the other timeline, only a few hours later.
Nomad: And you had her tell me that Melinda Garner is your handler.
“You don’t have to tell the others, but you can tell me.
Steve’s current designation on his non-avenger line is cuddle fiancé. Aren’t they so adorable? Also, I seriously wonder if they should contact each other on the Avenger line, but they can’t flirt on the Avenger line.
Purple arrow: Why are we doing Rose Garden press conferences right now?
Tony: Chocolate cup?
Red phone: Better than for production design, which will be what I mostly using it for. As soon as we fix things with the asshole, I expect you to get the most use out of it.
D FitzSimmons:  I hope you don’t actually get that message because I shouldn’t have said it that way. I was just angry typing. I wasn’t really planning to send that message, but not-Friday sent it anyway.
Natasha’s back and the Secret Avenger Trinity are making their way toward each other.
Anthony: His aunt threatened to kill me because he came home crying and I had to explain what happened without explaining what really happened because he still doesn’t want her to know. Now she thinks he’s hiding the fact that he’s at least fooling around with his BFF Ned.
Ana Jr.: You currently have three unread text messages from your grandmother on your cell phone.
From: Tony_Carbonell
Me: Who is Ana?
Anthony: Stupid bad guy screw up number one, never assume that the guy that you're selling illegal weapons to will not blow you up just to get out of paying. It always goes badly. But it makes our job easier when the bad guys just kill each other.
HSBF: The fact that you didn’t drink yourself is a good sign.
Me: He was breathing again before they got him out of here, so that’s promising.
On this planet, after six months Simmons gives up all hope of being rescued or rescuing herself which is probably why she ends up sleeping with the only other person on planet, Will the astronaut a.k.a. Hog Face. (This is also why in this story Fitz is OK with Leopold hooking up with Hunter. He actually encourages it.) But Fitz does not give up and he manages to get her back. For a while things are awkward because of Will and Hydra. But eventually they do cross the “event horizon” and get together and are at the point in their relationship where they’re thinking about ridiculously expensive town houses in the DC Metro. This is where they are when our story begins.
Me: If I was really brilliant, we wouldn’t be in separate countries right now because I would’ve realized what was going on earlier. Also, I wouldn’t be sharing a table with baby Robert. He’s being so sweet right now it’s making me nauseous.
Tony: If nothing changes, At least it’s keeping Ross way too busy to try to detain toddlers and seven-year-olds. People have always known what type of man Secretary Ross really is, just like people knew who Obadiah really was. The Board just looked away because it was more profitable to do so. I doubt DC politics is any better.
Thank you to everybody who read or review the last conversation. You are the absolute best. I adore all your comments. Remember, your writer is needy for feedback.
Agent 13, Even Agent Fitz can't crack her encryption.
Counselor Laura: Was it? The new Shield is not the old Shield, but it could become like the old Shield now that they’re back under government control. Especially if good people with backbones are not put in charge.
Tony: So you’re not going to run for office? You have the blonde hair and blue eyes for it. You would definitely have a shot as a third party candidate because you, baby, are 100% independent.
Me: I hope that doesn’t happen. You’re still in California?
Me: I wrote to him before hand and that helped things not turn into a shouting match. Okay there was shouting, but no throwing things.
Me: My bad memory is watching my James die or when I thought he died. It’s tied with watching your face when you saw the video. I’m so sorry about what happened that day. Maybe everything that happened that day should be the bad memory?
Venom: I get the analogy. Is it the same?
D: My niece can probably find out during spring break. We are currently escorting the hammer to Wakanda. The king mentions that his sister was planning to come back Saturday and will be bringing her friends.
Monkey lover 2: I’m not entirely sure she will see it that way especially after we traded places so that he could run a secret mission and for me to handle the fallout from AIDA. I’m just glad Simmons is not here right now. How’s that going?
StarkAE: As evident by several awkward lunches with Pepper Potts recently. Interesting euphemism by the way.
Me: Probably. Thankfully, my session didn’t end that badly. I didn’t break down in hysterical tears after I was forced to talk about my Howard issues. I was also not subjected to several rounds of invasive questions about my unauthorized contact with enhanced persons. Finally, nobody turned the thing into a giant interrogation session. Bonus points for that.
Nomad: Very unfortunate.
Steve: Tony just called me sugarplum again. He wants to know if you’re staying over tonight?
Red phone: Do you know what the Kinsey scale is?
Stephen C: Are you okay?
To be continued.
This may not be obvious because RDJ is always wearing ridiculous high heels when playing Tony Stark, but Emily VanCamp is an inch taller than him.
Cuddle Bunny: You do come off as being abrasive at first, but once people get to know you, it is easy to see what a good person you really are deep down inside.
Morgan’s dad: Perfect. I think we might be able to do this.
HSBF: I'm going to forgive you for saying that because maybe you weren't that far off.
Light spoilers for Star Trek Beyond, however the twist is not discussed. Also you may not spot things if you haven’t watched it but it still works regardless.
Also I think there’s like a 98% chance that Stefan found the ring hidden in the jumbo box of condoms. Really, I should’ve known better. Of course, even with the perfect immune system, Stefan would have a preference. Although he hasn’t said anything about it yet, so I shouldn’t panic right? Or should I panic because he hasn’t said anything? Or am I just overreacting to everything?
Thanks to the unexpected break the moratorium on discussing infinity war is over and it’s totally okay to talk about the season finale of agents of shield. Chapters are coming back from proofreading, so updates will be a little more regular.
"But will he? Probably not. He still feels bad for beating the hell out of me in Siberia and he such a martyr he would let Happy get a free shot in." Tony was worried about that
Thank you to everyone who read or reviewed the last chapter. We have another fun conversation with FRIDAY. But not to worry, another Clint interlude is on the horizon.
Person my boss is in love with: If it was never digitized, how do you even know that it exists?
Counselor Laura: Hunter?
“Neither can I. I think this might be her rebound. God, I hope so.” Honestly, he would’ve preferred Happy even though it kind of freaked him out a little bit. Happy never made his whole-body tingle.
"Because you loved him." Steve answered, not even phrasing it as a question. He knew better.
Anthony: I guess I’ll find out more Monday.
Then later on it was Happy, my James, and eventually Pepper Pot. After the break up, things between me and her were awkward but we’re starting to talk to each other about things other than work chaos which is good. Most of her questions are about Lily and Benji but we’re talking. Also, I’m not telling her she should get another boyfriend even though I do think it, because seriously, he still thinks that Pepper was just my beard. What type of person doesn’t get bisexuals? I just don’t get it. She needs better but I guess some people need a rebound relationship.
Steve: But we can bring Daisy back.
From: RIO_PR_forever
Me: Yes, although I am still technically in Virginia. We just touched down 15 minutes ago. We are making our way out of the airport now. Mary was waiting for me. I’m glad we were able to get a spot at the private airstrip at Reagan. Of course, if we took a Quinjet, I could’ve landed directly at the Playground, but whatever.
Red phone: Which is why you totally went for Agent Carter Jr. She probably heard the same stories I did as a kid.
Me: That’s the name of a Backstreet Boys song that Friday likes to play on repeat because she’s mean.
Me: You tell me.
Captain Tight Pants: How did your meeting with the ATCU go today?
Updated A/N: The actions Deke takes in season seven of AOS really validated the choices I made for him in this story. In this story and in cannon, he becomes the caretaker of a depressed and mourning alcoholic. When we get to the chapters written post-AOS, I’ll explain more about what I’ll be doing with season seven AOS elements.
Tony: Still coming to get your ideas about the new records, but he might have to go back earlier than planned. Although for part two, only Agent May and Spidey senior are coming. Other May couldn’t get that much time off from work and actually trusses me with her child out of the country. Which is shocking after what happened last time.
Me: Yeah but that doesn’t work but apparently precog are a thing now. I mentioned it last week. Coulson’s team has met more than one. Apparently one of them predicted my Ultron fuck up. I really wish someone would have told me that ahead of time. That would’ve been really helpful although apparently no one at team Coulson knew about the vision until after the fact.
Captain Tight Pants: Mostly because you had that shirtless charity poster I accidentally did hanging up in your lab as a joke.
Look, strategy, and fluff. That needs to be a tag. See progress. Tony and Steve are better when they work together. Although the denial continues. Now taking bets on when they will actually get a clue.
To be continued.
CoulsonPJ: Which is why you got a nice card for the baby blanket and I am currently trying out Fitz’s attempt at a dermal regenerator. We have to stop letting him and Stark create prototypes after watching Star Trek
Nomad: But you two are making progress and that’s what matters.
Red spider: You never actually answered.
So for this exercise, I’m supposed to write out how I feel about you murdering my parents. My Howard feelings are messy. I still feel guilty that I almost felt relieved that I wouldn’t have to keep living under his harsh gaze. I found evidence in the intervening years that my father did love me. He was just absolutely awful at showing that to me. Maybe if he lived a little bit longer, we would’ve had a better relationship, but you took that from me and I hate you for that.
“Mace was the one who incapacitated her last time because he was director, but yes. She actually died before we could help her but she got better. It also happened a few weeks later.” Months, actually. But Leo didn’t tell her that. The Watchdogs seem to be moving up there timeline which makes sense because their effort to get their preferred candidate didn’t work. Of course, this means that they’re also dealing with Robbie earlier. Which may not be a bad thing.
TMNS: As soon as I’m sure he’s with his dad.
Red phone: Yes, it was six days, but I was only intending for it to be three and then we had to deal with some mad scientist wanna be that tried to restart Hydra again or at least take over the brand. Why would anybody want to take over a name associated with World War II atrocities?
Laura realizes at those words she is not in Kansas, or rather her own timeline, anymore.
“We are going to expand your culinary horizons,” Tony said as he threw the room service menu at Steve. “Now I wish I really did order before you got here, but Happy texted me and I felt like I had to respond before putting in an order. Good news, I think he hates me a little less.”
Red phone: Friday has been helping me practice my answer. ‘I have no idea where Steve Rogers is, but if you want to anoint a new person as your propaganda tool, you’re going to have to pry that shield out of my cold dead hands’.
OK, you get to help me pick out a codename for Hunter of the good timeline. I have a codename for a bad timeline Hunter, but I’m also open to more suggestions.
“Like the Avengers’ weapons almost getting stolen," He said pulling away.
Me: I’m starting to really like her already.
HSBF: If you’re going to stop doing the fake subterfuge text messages, should we even keep talking to each other like we have been? Clint only talks to his wife in the event of an emergency.
The new consultant: Shit!
Cuddle Bunny: I’m pretty sure that’s what the Raft is.
TMNS: He did that to break up you and Steve? He wanted you to lose the person you love because you accidentally made him lose the one he loved?
Anthony love: Maybe. Ana was a little confused once she managed to get back online after digesting five years worth of data from the other Avengers. In addition to downloading time travel schematics or maybe it’s creating dimensional portals schematics. I’m still uncertain.
Anthony: Exactly. I wanted her permission to tell you first. But then little Miss Marvel this over here decided to press the send button on that particular text message because she ships us. Mostly platonically because she’s 11, but she still does. And I don’t even want to know how she figured out Cuddle Bunny is you.
To: Tony_Carbonell
Person that cares about my boss: Of course, they didn’t think ahead.
Friday: I hate to interrupt, but a computer with the name Ned’s Death Star is trying to override the training wheels protocol of the Spider-Man suit.
“What’s the question?” Steve asked tentatively.
"I’m trying to think positively. I did get mistaken for Chris Evans twice today, despite my new contacts now giving me a different eye color than him.” Steve joked.
HSBF: Stefan, anyway. They still don’t know it’s me.
Melinda: I’ll text him later.
Me: Mostly because I have yawned twice in the last five minutes. It’s past my bedtime.
Me: No. I thought about it a lot. But I talked to Agent and Agent America as well as Yo-Yo and came to the conclusion that maybe it’s better for some heroes to have both public and private identities. And I think Spidey is one of those people that needs his public person and his private person and for the world to not know that the two exist. He’s too young.
Thank you to everybody who read or reviewed the last conversation. You are all so fabulous. I am giving you more things to read while you are social distancing.
To be continued
Me: Here?
(See the end of the chapter for
Counselor Laura: Steve just came in.
Blue phone: Unless there really is an emergency, you shouldn’t text me when you are supposed to be paying attention to her.
Ana Jr.: So, Dr. Simmons was trying to use time travel to undo the snap?
Avenger Friday: VP Rhodes pushed personally for a pardon. I do not know this Mumbai agreement that you speak of.
Artwork created by Steve as a means to work through his issues
TMNS: Why did you send a crying MJ back in here? Why is she crying?
Thank you to everyone who read or reviewed the last section. You’re all fabulous. Kudos to Duchess, bladeandroses, and Dophne for figuring out that the 15 minute break was between this bit of dialogue:
The Big Boss: Again
“Yes, and May is happy. Aunt May. Other May and Yo-Yo called because they needed my advice due to coming across some sort of possible weapon that causes people to hallucinate goes and then attack each other,” Tony explained.
Tony Potts: The saving the world thing never really goes away.
Anthony love: Or that you and I are barely on speaking terms and only talk about our kids. BTW, your other self allegedly married May and adopted Ms. Marvel, after her whole family got dusted by Thanos.
To be continued.
Me: Which is?
Counselor Laura: Tony?
Tony: The cult of Hydra has always been diverse and opportunistic. You never know. It was always about power.
Tony: OK, but I don't know all the details because I haven't dug into the Hydra primer yet. In the other timeline, because of my communication with your other self, that Steve figured out that the story of my Aunt Ana dying in a freak lightbulb changing accident was a complete lie. Steve 2.0 asked Friday to investigate, and she got the timeline refugee Fitz to look into it. Because he was ex Hydra in the framework, he knew where to look for the bodies.
Chief mechanic: He knows better than to argue with May and is looking forward to quality beach time. I might be able to ship Flash off to the West Coast to work with Pepper, but he’s not leaving Ninja spider. I definitely know I can’t send him away. If they’re staying, MJ is staying because they’re all so stubborn. And I’m not even going to try with Afia.
“I think he might be less openly hostile. Okay, I think he’s going to stop trying to set me up with other people. But it’s probably going to take a while for him to be okay with us. Honestly, I think he was so uncomfortable because he kind of knows what happened in Siberia and his dad was an abusive bastard. So I think he was just worried about me becoming a battered boyfriend.” Tony explained and Steve frowned.
“I will.”
HSBF: Does this make you Red’s father-in-law?
The new consultant: I’m not. It was an enjoyable experience. You’re also the reason why Peter figured out he isn’t heterosexual. I gave you chocolate because I knew you needed it. We are friends.
“And I think we’re going to need him because we know that the blue bobble was stolen from the refugee ship and Loki was the one that brought it there but not much else. That's what Laura's team on the other side needs. Especially because apparently, May's daughter is with Thor."
I had this idea for a while that Tony was able to conceive Morgan because of stone magic. It was the purple one’s backup plan to keep Tony from messing up his vision. Although I bet, he didn't plan on Tony figuring that out. More to come.
CoulsonPJ: A little. It kind of tingles, but the bruising does seem to be fading.
Nomad: Tony, unpack your bags and rest for a while.
Steve knew it was Afia.
“He wasn’t. Happy believed that I could actually do a committed, monogamous relationship, so I wanted to believe that I could do a committed, monogamous relationship. I’ve wanted things to work out with Pepper. I really did want to prove that I could be in a real adult relationship that everyone wanted out of me, including Happy.”
Red phone: The ATCU is filled with sociopathic bastards. First, they show me video footage of Nomad getting his ribs cracked to see if I would react. I didn’t because if you spend enough time being yelled at by the paparazzi and everyone else, you learn not to react.
Me: Not seriously. It was an intellectual affection. I wanted his brains. You, I want everything. You’re my snuggle bear.
“The general that Agent Fitz is afraid of is a concern?” Steve asked.
Cuddle Bunny: How did it go?
Nomad: Yes, I got your email. It was adorable. I’ll give it to Clint next time I see him. I understand Tony. Protecting people comes first. I know you want to work things out with Pepper.
Steve: Kamala and Robin love that show. Robin told me lots of grilled cheese, and tomato soup is usually involved at your house for lunch. Which incidentally is what I’m making.
“Scary ass brunettes who take no shit from anyone. I prefer snarky blondes, but that's just me.”
Director Snookums: I’m sure Congress is obsessed with keeping you from getting laid. Seriously, Tony? I don’t have time for this. Not everything is about you.
Counselor Laura: Honestly, I haven’t asked. I figured if you wanted me to know, you would tell me. I’ve been focusing on how to get back to my own timeline and what to do when I get there.
Me: So how did you find out about the new fearless leader of an organization that does not yet to exist?
Me: There was also an incident yesterday that didn’t make the news, at least the international news, which I’m officially neither confirming nor denying.
Agent L. Barton: They’re definitely going to need help. Actually, everybody lost is going to need help. Because there are several problems here. One, is getting the stones to bring everybody back. Two, is bringing people back in a way that doesn’t cause extreme chaos. Finally, how do you deal with the trauma of missing five years of your life?
Tony Potts: So, nothing freaks you out anymore?
Counselor Laura: Look, I know you’re mad at me because I’m here and she’s not. I get that, but if you help, maybe we can get her and the babies back.
“Tony, I think you need to get outside and watch the kids. You’re the only one who can deal with [bleep],” Pepper suggested.
Anthony: Even though I brought an adorable 11-year-old who was targeted by xenophobic assholes, he said his hands were tied. That the people wanted these policies and he couldn’t go against the will of the people. I am seriously regretting saving his ass right now. Next time, his VP tries to kill him, he’s on his own.
Counselor Laura: Yes. Friday and the Princess created an LMD child for him since the state of New York did not want to let him adopt or even be a foster parent at the time. Wanda, who is married to Vision, gave her a bit of a stone boost. So, she’s as close to human as possible and still be synthetic.
Nomad: Something like that
“You’re supposed to eat when the kids eat,” Steve remarked.
Nomad: You did have a lot of physical damage after your fight with a nuclear warhead. I still couldn’t get you to stay in medical for more than five minutes.
Friday: I don’t think Mr. Stark is ready to acknowledge that yet. However, I will keep pushing him in that direction. I have several male engagement and wedding ring designs already on file.
We've talked some. It was bound to happen. Loki is the only person here that I sort of know. Not about New York, but the other things like how I ended up on team Coulson and how Loki found out he was adopted.
Me: Actually, all of Shield’s top brass, only Mister Patriotism is kind of clueless. Actually, Jeffrey is kind of clueless about everything in general except how to set up a good photo opt. He is also ridiculously needy for affirmation of his self-worth.
Tony Potts: Pepper mostly stays in the house in Manhattan, and I prefer to be with Morgan by the lake. It makes sense because Pepper is the CEO of SI. Of course, we mostly do survival stuff now because of Deke. We took over his think tank and made him our chief creative officer about 3 1/2 years ago.
Love: Oh shit. Who told her? Wait, you’re deflecting. Seriously, what happened?
Love: Nice to know the Calvary is still out there, although I don’t think we’re allowed to call her that anymore. Also lies that are mostly true always work best.
HSBF: Let the agents at the Playground handle it. Don’t go to DC.
: refers to Secretary of State Thaddeus "Thunderbolt" Ross. Commonly used nickname in the US for the Secretary of State. Not to be confused with CIA Ross aka “Evan” Ross (Everett Kenneth Ross whom Stark occasionally miss names and refers to as “poor man’s Coulson”.)
“I thought you said Friday’s sent you everything?” Deke asked, puzzled.
D Fitzsimmons: Not at all. I wanted to go to my boss alone to ask her if she was willing to convince Stark to work on the project with us. Instead, May and her husband, Captain Rogers, went. According to Pepper and May, that went badly. Both said something about pigheaded morons in love.
I don’t know why I am writing this report. It’s not like I’m able to send it to my Tony right now. Maybe I am writing so I can put my thoughts together on what I need to do. I need to get back home to prevent this from happening. I’m not losing my kids. I’m just not. The best way to keep Thanos from winning again is to figure out how the Avengers lost.
HSBF: Speaking of women in your life who are mad at me, what about Pepper? Did you email her back or maybe even call her.
Monkey lover 2: LA just went out. They said they will take out power in the next city in 30 minutes, if their demands are not met instead of an hour like last time. The watchdogs tried to attack Yo-Yo on a date. They are now in custody. But there has to be similar attacks happening throughout the world.
“The real person not the act that he puts on for everyone. And by this point I realize that 90% of his behavior is a performance.”
“She told me that you had something to tell me that couldn’t be told to me in an email so I assume that it’s about Bucky and if it’s going to be bad news I’d rather get it out-of-the-way now so I still have something to look forward to this weekend.” Isn’t that sweet, sort of.
“We weren’t really speaking to each other at the time of the invasion.” Laura looked up to see Steve walk into the room, holding a Stark pad.
“I miss you too.” If both of them were crying, nobody said anything.
Person my boss is in love with: Do you really believe that?
HSBF: Nope doesn’t count.
HSBF: Is she OK?
TMNS: Ana just told me to read the idiot’s guide to polyamorous relationships again.
Me: Yes. I hope you actually do. Tony’s getting desperate. He’s planning to cover the entire house in mistletoe to get you to kiss Phil.
Thank you to everybody who read or review the last conversation. It’s time to get deep. I’ve been wanting to do this letter for a while but it’s hard to get all of this out. Here is Steve’s next attempt.
Monkey Lover 2: Your boyfriend is not looking at his phone, so I have to contact you directly. DC is dark due to a continuous EMP attack. I am working on restoring power. False flag operation in effect by Watchdogs. Using the blackouts to attack Inhumans. I’m activating the revenge of hellfire protocol.
Chief mechanic: He managed to accidentally go through a portal in space. He ended up getting captured and becoming a gladiator for about three years. Somehow Thor and his brother ended up there. The notes are really sketchy after that. I guess that goes on the list of things to ask about.
Tony: Did I mention that in the last hour, I have been politely yelled at bureaucrat style by representatives from four different countries for making Avenger weapons, but not releasing them to the public?
Nomad: That you have a twitter account just to follow food trucks. Honestly, it was mostly oral.
"My therapist pointed that out multiple times that was what you were doing." Tony explains.
“Being a good boyfriend means I don’t put him in that position. My last boyfriend hated that I was still friends with Parker. And he didn’t know about the kiss.” Flash explained.
Me: He is not drinking again, if that’s what you’re concerned about. Although I really can’t say more than that. Don’t you usually ask Friday these questions?
Thankfully, Hunter decided not to mention the fact that in this drawing, they was a green woman with antlers and a giant wolf or the fact she was allegedly their sister. Leo had a feeling that’s not going to go well. Of course, before Leo could say anything about this, he found himself inside of a house that he recognized from Robin’s artwork. The man he knew from Coulson’s fake medical file, the one that covered up his resurrection.
Anthony: And I want you here. I definitely don’t want to go nearly a week without talking to you again outside of an emergency.
Steve: Thank you for that. The dying in World War I thing was what my mom told me and everyone else. When I went down in the ice, that's what I believed. At the same time, I had memories that didn't add up. I remember seeing him hitting my mother.
Me: Maybe.
Venom: Of course, that's how you knew. Nothing happened.
Me: Talking to me right now is technically against the Accords but you’re still doing it. More importantly, shield is letting you do it.
D Fitzsimmons: Actually, I think it was more about getting Fitz back. Either Fitz, honestly. I don't think she cared about which one she got. She is obsessed with it.
Agent Laura: I know about the list because although Pepper is still my Tony’s best friend, there are some things you don’t discuss with your ex-girlfriend. So I get all the sex stuff.
Agent M: Yes.
Nomad: Why is he even there? You really don't need to be watching this.
Genius Princess: Sleep is overrated. I know you were part of the briefing, especially because Stark asked for a favor. We have a month until Thanos arrives if things stay the same as they did in the other timeline. We may not have that much time. I promise all rest once we get this done.
Tony: I have my sources.
MayMQ: Will do. I just hope things don’t implode. Or that anybody tries to kill Stark again.
Oh by the way we’re going to do Thanksgiving at the compound. Stefan won’t be there because you know why. If you’re not trying to avert an apocalypse, you’re invited. Actually most of the team is invited. And I think I have to invite Piper and Davis because I put them through a lot the last couple of days. Although, Davis is running a mission with the aunt and the counselor right now, so he’s probably happy. Piper on the other hand, broke up with the girlfriend while here, so definitely inviting her to Thanksgiving.
Me: OK, time for another question. When did you last sing to yourself or someone else? Also I’m going to add what were you singing? Okay, these questions are ridiculous. And how do they help you find intimacy?
To be continued
“Obviously, he is your nephew since we’re sleeping together,” Hunter said, kissing Leo. “Definitely a Fitzsimmons kid,” Hunter whispered against Leo’s lips.
Anthony: Not really, Gumdrop. That particular Friday fantasy is not happening outside of a contamination incident because we are both dating other people. And I’m so happy I’m dating you my yummy Bunny even if your friends are betting on us getting together.
Of course you can invite friends to the compound. Some may need to go through a background check and if you invite your husband’s brother, he’s going to need an armed escort, especially if he goes near any of the Avengers tech. But your son’s BFF is always welcome. I’ll have Mary arrange a Young Avengers play date on the calendar.
Warning: Again this chapter goes into M territory because Tony has a dirty mouth (and maybe he’s trying to see if he can get Steve to sext him). After feedback, I decided that I’m doing two versions of at least this chapter and maybe the whole story (it really depends on how far Tony pushes things). On Archive of Our Own, you will be getting the full Tony Stark version. On fanfiction dot net you’re getting the edited by FRIDAY version where I will be editing in the same style that they use in the comic books to keep even the Deadpool comics T. I use the same username on both sites, so it should be easy to find the version of the story that fit your needs.
Red phone: Like making out with your recently deceased former girlfriend’s grandniece before the body is cold?
The Mechanic: Your baby has super powers and is slowly becoming an adult
Nomad: No one's more VIP then Anthony
BITC: Wait! What?
Football Hunter: You mean when you cased his apartment. Using going to the men’s room as an excuse? I taught you so well. You were such a sweet innocent thing when I found you.
Me: Probably. This is the only way I’m going to get kids. At least that’s what New York child welfare says.
"It is something he doesn't really talk about now. I've only known for a couple of months. Again not a sharer."
Friday: You did take a few of his T-shirts and are currently using them to sleep in. The images have been sent to your Nomad account.
HSBF: And who was doing the crying?
D Fitzsimmons: Is this what you need? I would really like to get lunch. I barely got to eat breakfast because not depressed Simmons wanted to give me a tour of the Lighthouse. The Wakanda embassy is different, but I did grow up here. So it was a waste of three hours of my time.
BFF Ned: I really hate the fact that my mom hates Mr. Stark so much. It’s been a year since the wedding incident. She should just get over it, but now she’s just as controlling as ever.
“Also not selling my life story to the tabloids. Or making sex tapes behind my back. Which is apparently a whole lot easier now. You can even leak your own dick pics.” Tony joked.
Tony Potts: Fuck! That’s his plan to make sure I wouldn’t help. Evil, manipulative asshole.
Steve: Sure. Let me pack.
"Or to go completely wrong. Everybody could completely see through the façade." Tony told his boyfriend worriedly.
(See the end of the chapter for
Me: Seven years. Clint actually left me for a while because it became such a problem, but we were able to reconcile. Did Clint say something about it to you?
Nomad: Okay.
KayKIMO
Tony: Unless he’s dying again and we don’t want that.
Me: I’m not sure how much fun it can be, but the catering will be good. Anything can be better with good catering.
Karen: Actually, I am enjoying the challenge. Teenage Mutant Ninja Spider only needs me while patrolling, or when he wants to talk about MJ or his Uncle. Yes, he still blames himself for his murder. It is nice to converse with adults occasionally. At least temporarily, I’m not sure if I would like to do this permanently.
Tony: Anyway, in about two days, we will have another text message conversation, but we need to get Simmons on board. To get Simmons on board, we need Hunter. However, I can't leave Pepper with both kids by herself because that would be cruel.
Tony: No strangling of any type, even the safe word variety. I’m not sure either of us would be up to that anyway.
“I am really glad about that. Although, I’m sorry you’re going to lose him at SI.”
To be continued.
Venom: MJ is not OK right now. She’s very worried about her cousin. We don’t know where she is, and it’s approaching 48 hours.
Me: It’s late where you are. Do you want to try going through some of the questions tonight or are you too tired to do that?
Anthony: Basically, there was an incident last night that our favorite teenage mutant ninja spider got involved in and I had to clean up. He tries to go to a party to talk to the girl of his dreams and instead things go so badly that I had to save him from drowning in the Hudson. Yes, I used the armor remotely. Dr. Simmons still has me on restricted duty.
Agent 13: No, you're not. Aunt Peggy would be happy that you fell in love again.
Anthony: All bad things. Which we are not talking about because this is a work/Hydra/’Siberia issues’ free zone for the rest of the night.
“Do you think we will ever get to the same place as other us?” Tony asked.
Anthony: Yes, but the press conveniently forgets about that.
Tony: It's true, sweetie. You’re my adorable, sassy teenager. You’re training me for Morgan.
Tony: Tell me the truth, Snuggle Bug, what are you really grateful for?
Me: You thought that was a joke? That explains so much about our interactions. Friday, don’t send that.
Please remember to wait at least 30 days before including spoiler material in your comments. So feel free to talk about Black Panther and the first 100 episodes of Agents of Shield. But anything else send me a DM on twitter or a PM on fanfiction dot net.
The new consultant: Maybe because I saw this coming, especially after you called me in tears after flying out to California to see him. You still never told me why.
“Gladly. Can I please have my Stark pad back?” Tony asked.
“He is not.” “We are not…” “Not really…” “He is hot but it’s complicated.” “That would be an understatement.” The two of them stumbled out almost simultaneously.
Tony: It’s okay.
“OK, we are still skipping question 13 because you’re raising a kid that can see the future, and you really wish she didn’t,” Tony said as he slid under the covers of the bed with a Stark pad in hand. If he was going to share a bed with Steve, he was going to be comfortable. It’s already a little too cold for October, and Pepper hasn’t switched the heat on yet. If he’s been fantasizing about snuggling with Steve for a decade, that’s nobody else’s business. He was too stressed out during the Ultron fiasco to actually enjoy it.
Cuddle Bunny: Every new beginning comes from some other beginning’s end.
For those of you who watched Agents of Shield last night, wasn’t that crazy? And two days earlier we had the Infinity War trailer which was also amazing. Put the two together and I’m scared. Because of what happened in both, I am applying the same rule as I use for the movies. Please, no discussing spoiler stuff in the comment for at least a month. Which means tomorrow, you can talk about Thor as much as you want in the comments. That movie is going to provide a few Easter eggs, but won’t affect the plot. AOS may affect the plot because I’m deciding how much the butterfly effect will come into play. But it’s mostly going to be stuff from season four. Will what happened in season five /infinity war happen in the timeline for this story? I am not able to say. Maybe the butterfly effect has already prevented that from happening or maybe it will come about in a different way. We shall see.
To: RIO_PR_forever
Number one May: Michelle should be there too. Have you three negotiated yet?
(See the end of the chapter for
"I have never been a Boy Scout. Again, I am way too queer." Steve remarked.
Location: Manhattan, New York
Me: That I can’t argue with. Nor would I want to.
Me: And your counselor friend is not available?
Red phone: I finished high school by 14. That means I was always the smallest kid in class and also the smartest. They either all hated me because I really was better than them or pretended to be my friend to use me. I preferred the ones who just shoved me in a locker because at least I knew where I really stood.
Agent M: Not until death.
Nomad: I don’t think we’re at the marriage place yet. I at least want to kiss you first.
Me: Yes, she settled. She even managed to start her own business. She was also upset that she had to cancel the date to make her little visit. Apparently she’s given up on my science bro ever coming back, but it’s probably for the best that she is moving on.
Ana Junior: They are not at this time. I was initially not planning to tell you that until the princess returns from her frappe break and her conversation with her brother. I feel that you need to vent; otherwise, you may end up punching Leo.
Me: And if you talk to her at all, you think that she's going to force you to talk about why you chose Bucky over everything?
As I mentioned earlier, I'm going to be staying someplace safe with Ms. Melinda for a little while so I won’t be coming home right away. Don’t worry, it will be fun. She doesn’t frown all the time. Okay mostly I want to find out what she did with Mister Rogers when they were special friends.
Ana Jr.: So, what happened next?
“Not me, the one from the other timeline. Do you have a crush on Leopold?” Fitz asked.
Counselor Laura: I've been warned, and I've been a Shield Agent for a little while.
Cuddle Bunny: Point.
Anthony: Yes, although I left out the part about grandpa Stark being an alcoholic cheating Bastard and dad having to lie, steal and cheat his way into getting a college education, after the guy most likely died young of liver failure and venereal disease. There’s a long family history of alcoholism and probably sex addiction in there.
“Maybe we could list things we want to work on instead? I definitely want us to have a better relationship.” Tony suggested.
To be continued.
(See the end of the chapter for
“No, because he already hated Stefan because you’re keeping me from my one true love, Pepper. At least that’s what Happy believes.” In reality, Tony is pretty sure that Steve may be the one. Which is weird because they haven’t even had sex yet and they still have so many issues to deal with, but somehow Tony just feels it.
“I don’t know. I didn’t think it would get to this point. I thought I changed enough to keep it from happening. But I was wrong. I wonder if I should have listened to the Doctor and killed Eli Morrow before what he did at the power plant. But I knew I couldn’t risk losing Robbie. But Morrow killed six agents. He shot spikes of carbon through their hearts. Their bodies are waiting on the plane and I could have prevented that from happening,” Leo argued.
Blue phone: It doesn’t surprise me though because Peggy was like that.
Tony had a good day on the beach with Steve. They even had a little picnic. No beach sex but that’s probably for the best. There’s just some locations that you don’t want sand to end up in. Also, water issues. He lost a lot in Afghanistan, including the desire to ever do ocean escapades. Besides Piper would have probably ICE’d them if they tried. Steve was still blushing in front of her anyway.
It will be explained during the course of this conversation, but Tony has changed his address book designation for Steve again. Steve will now be referred to as HSBF, which stands for Hot Sexy Boyfriend. He wanted to actually put that in his address book, but Agent May said no.
Me: You, I’m not so sure about. Which explains why you’re wandering around the world rescuing people in a new costume. (Message not sent)
Blue phone: Yes.
FRIDAY: Yes, but he did not take you seriously. He is in his lab, but merely because he’s working on a project not because he’s avoiding everyone.
Tony: Because she eloped with my sort-of son? Why did I encourage that relationship?
(See the end of the chapter for
Nomad: Not really. I slept with Jonathan, a former aide of Sen. Christopher Ward, a few times before I realized he was married and an asshole. He spouts out anti-power people stuff all the time as a paid pundit.
"I'm glad."
Ana Jr.: Afia is currently having a research session with her friends on the Wakanda embassy levels. They have New York bagels and pizza. Along with access to the embassy kitchens.
When I get back from seeing Stefan, which I hope will put me in a much better mood because of things you are too young for, we can reassess at least the actual intern parts of your internship. The other stuff that’s a Laura thing.
Red phone: You grew up during Prohibition, so maybe you were a lookout for an underground speakeasy. How close am I?
I also love your body but that’s not all I love about you because you can buy a perfect body if you have enough money. But you can’t buy happiness or compassion, or any other really good quality. Actually, sometimes I think money takes those good things from you.
HSBF: If Stars & Stripes sounds like me, I’m never going down on you again.
Tony Potts: Not as much as I wish I did right now.
Anthony: We’re taking necessary precautions. Director Snookums is making my designated bodyguard test my food before I eat it. The good news is Dr. Monkey Lover managed to create a working tricorder.
What Friday was not allowed to send forward from the perspective of Tony's cell phone.
Tony: The guy was your best friend, I doubt that would be the case.
Xxxxxx
Me: I tried six times.
“Okay, I think we covered ‘we’ sentences. We even did bonus sentences. Yay us.”
HSBF: So, I’ve seen clips of the press conference all over Twitter. Are you OK? They were brutal.
Me: It's in your phone under Slingshot. If it's the end of the world catastrophe situation you can also try Bulletproof Pacifists and Deathlok. I did his new prosthesis so he owes me.
Cuddle Bunny: How did that go?
Anthony love: Your adventures with the Confederacy are also going to be on the list. I’m not exactly sure how to start that conversation with the president.
Steve: What are you saying?
What happens next? You will just have to wait and see.
“Because I needed Friday’s help to do so. She was the first person I contacted. She convinced me that the Avengers needed to be back on speaking terms. So I started emailing Tony again to help with that.”
Red phone: I can't believe you just typed that.
The Mechanic: Not Afia because apparently, that part of Friday didn't leave her, which means some things will have to be recalibrated. I might have to just let Wanda do what she wants to do. But Spidey is probably still scrubbing the home theater with bleach. Spidey is perfectly okay watching German porn, but me with my boyfriend is a bridge too far.
Nomad: The crush makes it easier to understand why he did what he did.
The new consultant: Possibly since it’s 2 AM.
Me: I still should’ve been told.
Counselor Laura: Tony, I am sorry that you read that conversation. I don’t think I realized how different this timeline would be.
The boss: He’s married to your alternate timeline counterpart. Apparently, he assumed time travel was more like Back to the Future than Star Trek.
Nomad: Yes.
Me: That happens with a lot of relationships. Although in my case, it was a shield to the chest. You try to do the right thing and then you end up alone because you did the right thing. In the end it’s better to do the right thing.
Hunter: Do I need to pick up a pregnancy test?
Friday: Ana Jr. is the name of the AI in charge of the Avengers and ATCU data networks.
“You seem to be good at it.”
“Happy doesn’t hate you,” Afia tells him. “He just gets a little jealous of anybody else that has dad’s attention. He was dad’s second friend ever, so he has trouble playing with others. He is my dad's Ned."
I feel like there’s a lot going on because Ana tried to schedule me on a three-week vacation to Malta in the middle of April. I feel like I’m missing something beyond a missing Laura. Write me back or call me. I deserve an explanation.
Cuddle Bunny: That’s not good.
Me: I’m sure it’s a mixture of cognitive bias and extreme stupidity. Apparently, neither she nor her spouse realized that would just make the situation worse because most of my wealth would be going to various charity and trusts after my demise, one of which would support the Avengers and another for the Enhanced Person Defense Fund.
I also accept that Steve wasn’t choosing you over me. He was making sure I wouldn’t have your blood on my hands and I already have enough of my own. So, after a lot of reflection, Steve made the right decision.
“You don’t have to be here. Me and Leo can deal with this on our own. Shouldn’t you be in Mumbai aggressively negotiating with the girlfriend anyway?” Hunter remarked. “Also we’re technically not married, it’s just a cover identity. Weddings just lead to ninjas or evil dads crashing.” Leo was still trying to repress what happened last March. That was a disaster.
“Were there any bodies?” May asked completely serious.
StarkAE: He's wearing the pajamas suit. Dammit. Also, did Spidey actually take Sexy_Flash’s Audi? That kid is a dick. Seriously, only a dick or somebody who really loves that CW show would use that as their twitter handle.
Me: That’s true.
Tony Bear: Yes, it is. My mind is numb from under stimulation. And if somebody asks me about Pepper one more time, I’m going to bring out the gauntlet. That goes double for the person who asked if I was screwing my assistant, twice.
HSBF: Why?
Me: The newly blonde Widow managed to get baby bird to the lighthouse before Sky Quake dumped her because my ex-wife was too busy doing God knows what to actually do what I asked. Definitely over.
“What’s going on?” Tony asked, looking at the trio still very confused.
Where are you?
“Anyway, I met my first friend at MIT, who I love to pieces. I am forever grateful that he survived the snap. My parents died when I was 21, and I didn’t handle it well. This is how Tiberius talked me into doing a sex tape that he was conveniently not in but sure made a lot of money for his company. Then shortly after that, I also lost Jarvis. Things didn't get better.”
Skye quake: Ask Tasha. This is not encrypted enough.
HSBF: I would ask you how the taping of Jimmy Kimmel went, but I really want to know what you’re planning to do at the dinner tomorrow. I can always watch the interview in the morning, my time. Friday sends me everything.
Tony: Not you. Such a pity. I’m still mad I had a business breakfast this morning. I wanted to eat berries and whip cream off your stomach.
Also, this chapter may push the T rating because Tony has a dirty mouth, but it’s only a couple of lines, so I’m keeping the rating as is for now.
Me: We are just going to focus on your relationship drama today. I assume you’re back at home base recuperating?
“Yes. I acted so recklessly. I gave my company away to my best friend. Then I got really drunk and wrecked my house. I should’ve gone into rehab after that but didn’t.” Tony regrets that. Maybe if he was sober and working through his Howard issues when he first met Steve, things would have gone a lot better. It couldn’t have gone worse.
Nomad: So, what happened from your point of view?
Venom: Did you know that last year’s wedding location is a secret Shield/ATCU/Avenger base with like 100 floors underground?
Boss Tony: He could be an imposter. It wouldn’t be the first time because, apparently, shape-shifting aliens exist.
Counselor Laura: Phase one, group counseling, and apparently, I must be the leader until I leave. I should also find an alcohol counselor for Simmons. Tony had Steve clean out the alcohol in the lab, and it was terrible.
Me: No, it went well, or at least as well as it can with Pepper being the only one drinking.
Tosha: BTW, according to Bruce’s notes, you grabbed Agent Barton from the Avenger compound.
Melinda: Lots of people get married because they need emotional support and have survived drama together. We’re together to hold each other to reality. You would be an even bigger prick without me.
“It’s bad isn’t it?” One of those other reasons is Tony hates giving bad news.
No costume designs or toaster schematics, although her drawing does give Thor a new weapon that kind of looks like a giant ax. A new weapon that Thor is trying to plant into the chest of what looks like a giant purple raisin. Tony knows that the figure is Thor because of the muscles and colors being used, although the long hair seems to be missing. Instead, it is shorter and spiky. Next to it was a drawing of a blonde lady with a cat (with tentacles?) and a guy that looks like Patches before he became Patches. They are on a plane of some sort. The unknown blonde is also sporting a lot of red and blue.
Hunter: If they’re engaged, obviously, those games weren't ridiculous.
“You have to come out sometime. What if you end up with like a boy band member?”
Iron Dad: I’ll call you after my play date with the president.
Nomad: At least I would know where she is and that she was okay.
“What?”
Red phone: Actually, Skye-quake_23, my now former ATCU contact, did just that because apparently it’s my fault that her boyfriend died last month. Not that she’ll explain why.
“Agent Agent and his team dealt with the end of the world just last May while we had our heads up our asses. Which means it probably will happen again next May and probably the next May or possibly April after that because apparently April/May is apocalypse season. It’s why I’m working on a wearable suit. Thanks to help from the princess and Monkey Lover, I might have one ready by Thanksgiving instead of Valentine’s Day.”
Me: I have no trouble if you wake me up in the middle of the night. Especially if you are shirtless.  I love you, shirtless.
Anthony: Congressional hearing with Senator Hateful. Allegedly, I’ve been colluding with unregistered enhanced individuals.
Football Hunter: I expect nothing less from my favorite little genius.
Girl Friday: That’s so unfair.
Tosha: During the middle of an apocalypse.
I was inspired to do this from the 2018 Champions run. I love all the characters there, including Visions’ daughter Viv. Since circumstances are not right for Vision to have her right now, I decided to give him a teenage sister instead. I’m 20 years younger than my brother, so I appreciate this family dynamic.
"Hey, I didn’t mean to wake you up. I just wanted to steal a kiss before heading into the shower. I’m all sweaty again from you so I figure I should try to be dressed before May or Yo-Yo show up. You can go back to sleep.” Tony said as he started to scoot off the bed.
“I feel like accidentally hitting a building should qualify, but sometimes I think you were trolling me. You feel like a troll sometimes.” Steve smiled at that.
I would adore you forever, if someone would make Tony’s artwork suggestions for me.
Me: I really thought that we were rebuilding trust here Cuddle bunny.
Thank you to everybody who read or left kudos for the last conversation. You are the best. I truly enjoy your feedback. I realize we haven’t heard from Ned in the story so far, and we’re up to conversation 35. For those of you who skipped over text messages from the Edge of high school, Ned passed out at the Fitzsimmons wedding, and his mom blames Tony. He’s banned from hanging out with Peter and Afia on the weeks he lives with his mom. His father thinks his ex-wife is overreacting, but the custody arrangement is complicated—divorce sucks.
“Ana, what the fuck? I didn’t mean for that to become a text message.” He yelled at the AI. He may have dictated the message, but he hit the cancel button on his watch. He didn’t want to carry two phones, so he opted for a Stark watch for his Avenger line.
Peter gave me your email address. I hope that’s okay. Also, this is my personal email address. I trust you won’t give it to the tabloids.
“So, I have good news and bad news,” Tony said, walking into the guest room Pepper took Steve to after storytime earlier. He was carrying his overnight bag.
“Maybe. Deke and May have theorized I react differently to marijuana than a regular person. It makes me more open and less scared to do things I really want to do.”
Wow, a somewhat quick response. Under 24 hours. You’re getting better. I’ll be happy to come for Thanksgiving. I think I would prefer to avoid my extended family for at least another holiday post breakup. Although, I’m going to have to show up for Christmas, which definitely means no Malta. Maybe I’ll be ready to deal with the boyfriend by Easter.
“This is secure?” Steve asked.
Me: Principle Morita is pissed off that I “bought” my way into the school. He believes my only redeeming qualities so far is that I want the science lab I’m paying for named after Bruce and not myself. I would give another donation, but I don't think that's going to win me any points.
Me: Yep, unsuccessfully, but they still tried. Thankfully, they don’t have the votes even with the new kid showing up. Of course, they didn’t find out about her until after the vote, but whatever. They want to bring in some Hammer Industries refugee to take my place as CCO.
Tony Bear: They just have to look at the way I’m looking at you and they will know the truth.
“I know you’re right about that after a good seven years of reflecting on the horrible choices of Siberia.” Once his doctor got him on the good drugs. “Mistakes were made on all sides.”
Cuddle fiancé: She also told Nat that you would give her an update on Daisy when we got there. Nat is worried because she hasn’t heard from Daisy since she left for operation Quake Loki.
“Which I’m very happy about.”
HSBF: I think Pepper would make me sign one anyway and I would do it because she’s scary.
This is the longest conversation in this story. Actually, the last conversation was originally part of this, but it was already getting ridiculously long. Therefore, I moved the actual question part of the conversation to the next day. Yet the final version still went over 3000 words. (Also poor Tony. He’s typing most of these text messages by hand during this conversation because he’s not alone.) They really just had a lot to say to each other. Steve and Tony really are working on this emotional intimacy thing.
“Unless I actually start dating Parker, never.” Flash is definitely not ready for that.
D FitzSimmons: I'm just frustrated. For these last 22 months, he's been here living this happy life, and I've been dealing with alcoholic Nana for five and a half years. I'm exhausted and angry. I just want her to be okay like the Simmons here. She's just so lovely and sweet and not drunk all the time. That’s the woman my mom told me about.
Counselor Laura: Shuri, is this you?
“I don’t even think they’re that upset about the Spidey situation since they’d rather spend time talking about who I’m dating then the pilots that were killed in the incident. Assholes. Where the Fuck do they get off…”Steve quickly silenced Tony with a kiss. The man needed it.
Steve: I want to be there with you, helping you do that.
Counselor Laura: That must’ve been brutal. Also, it's always hard for people to ask for help. I relapsed three times before I agreed to go to rehab. It's even harder to ask again when you've been rejected before.
Nomad: Hey, why haven't you visited me in the suit yet?
“No more talk of Howard tonight.” He said rubbing circles on Tony’s back.
“If there’s a good chance we’re going to get snapped out of existence, you might as well go for it.” Flash sounded resigned.
But my mom would've been disappointed. She used to say ‘an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind’. Most people think Gandhi said that, but no one is certain. Maybe it’s just a summary of his philosophy. For years, mom tried to get dad out of the weapons business. She hated it. It was the only thing they argued about other than the drinking.
Nomad: The feeling is mutual.
So does anyone want to guess who sent that last message?
Me: I thought Yo-Yo and Happy would be able keep them preoccupied for the evening while you and I have grown up fun time. However, Connor needs homework help because he is expected to know something that they didn’t cover at his school in Iowa last year. Since it’s kind of my fault that he is starting a new school in Manhattan this year, I should probably help until I line up a tutor.
Captain tight pants: Their dad wants to see them too, but he is wanted in 117 countries.
“The circumstances are different this time.”
“She could always have two,” she joked, sort of. Okay, maybe she read too many Jim and Spock fanfics that involved this type of scenario back at the Academy. She’d had to do something since she was too young to drink.
Counselor Laura from 2023: Regardless, there's more brainpower on your side. We only have Bruce, Tony, Scott, and not sober Simmons.
Me: The UN really likes you. They are thinking about using small teams of enhanced persons to do black ops stuff, like rescuing victims from terrorists.
Monkey lover 2: Yes, actually. There may have been engagement rumors. I didn’t exactly have time to keep up with twitter when I was incarcerated.
"Sometimes in life we all have to do things that we don’t want to do.” Steve told him as he gave him one last gentle touch of lips before pushing him towards Melinda.
Nomad: So you believe that someone deliberately targeted Tony to get to me?
Anthony: Technically, she is not an agent anymore. Actually, I think she’s about to overtake you on the most wanted enhanced person list.
To be continued
Nomad: I didn’t know that she had any siblings besides Michael, who died before we even met. That’s why I was really surprised at the funeral to find out she had a grandniece from the Carter side of the family.
The Big Boss: He was the best at what he did. He fooled all of us. Although it was probably easy, considering you haven’t been publicly with a man since the tape. Privately, we both know better.
To be continued
Steve: I need to go. May and Simmons are having a disagreement.
Stefan Carter sent you a message via (FRIDAY messenger service)
Blue phone: I’m glaring at the phone right now wishing it was you.
Tony: Mostly.
Nomad: Which is true.
Thank you to everyone who read or reviewed the last chapter. It’s time for another break from Tony/Steve banter, but not drama for Steve and Clint time.
Me: I should the known you would have looked over my gear while we were in Johannesburg together.
Genius Princess: We would really like that information as well. We can start getting the stones while we figure out how to get you back. We are trying on our end.
Tony: Yes. This thing has been going on since before SHIELD collapsed. So some of that money came from people who turned out to be Hydra, so enjoy it in good conscience. You were the only one crazy enough to bet that Coulson would need to die a second time before he and May would get it together.
PS: When you come bring pizza. I miss the stuff. The food is good here, but I miss New York.
Nomad: No, but it makes sense that you are continuing what we had planned before it all came apart. Especially with all the kids around. You don’t want them to accidentally get hurt.
D Fitzsimmons:  What happened to Friday? I like her, she's my friend. She makes sure I understand all the pop-culture references that I missed growing up in a world controlled by the Blues. I love the 80s so much. They had the best music. Also, The Breakfast Club is the best movie ever.
Tony: Hunter is my nanny. It would probably be his idea.
Purple Arrow: He was angry because he feared losing you.
Counselor Laura: Maybe. The notes that Tony does have don’t make a lot of sense. He can’t ask Simmons because she’s mostly been in the framework since she threw up on my shoes. She’s also mad at us for hiding the liquor.
Tony: I always need you. However, I am only about 10 more minutes of this meeting. Also, Agent America is standing by to pull me out, most likely for another briefing on or conference call about the Adrian Toomes situation.
In the original story, I said that our timeline diverged from the main MCU in mid-May 2016 when the main timeline 2018 Leo Fitz went back in time and created this new timeline. His absence was the reason why things deferred from the prime reality/main MCU timeline. Which is how we got May married to Steve and Tony and Pepper pretending to still be together in public for Morgan’s sake.
Anthony: Besides, I might have to explain some of the elements of the wedding, like there is a part of the ceremony where we can’t take pictures, not even the wedding photographer. Or the fact that we’re going to have to take pictures with the whole family later.
Me: Yes.
Anthony: I already grabbed go bag number three. See, I did listen to you. Now I have 22 more minutes to talk to you before I am forced to spend quality time with Agent Carter Jr.
Me: Maybe a little bit of both.
Help needed: Due to a wonderful offer from Misaky0 there will be illustrations for upcoming chapters. However, I never uploaded images to A3O before. If anyone has and is willing to walk me through it. That would be wonderful.
Me: A little bit, but Monkey Lover will be doing the heavy lifting. I might be doing some of the programming. My own programming. Also, princess Friday is lobbying for her own body.
Stephen C: Yes
Agent M: It’s not a risk now. I don’t care if you have to tranquilize him. Liberty cannot be here right now. It will do Red Malibu no good if he gets arrested or taken out the moment he touches down in New York.
Me: Also, twitter has been filled with reports of him calling various female employees, sweetheart, because he can’t bother to remember their name, and unauthorized hugging.
“That’s true.” Steve answered.
HSBF: Are you back from your lie detector test yet? What type of questions did they ask?
D Fitzsimmons: I guess Nana considered it, which is why she sent me back to the day I first arrived.
Me: And then he had that exploding “satellite” to worry about, so it wasn’t a problem.
“They’re not my kids.”
“Of course he does.” He said, tired of dealing with toddlers. “Did you tell him about what happened two days ago?” He asked the young woman in front of him.
Thank you to everyone who read or reviewed the last conversation. You're so wonderful. You always keep me happy and writing. I adore seeing your comments. You make me sit down and focus. I absolutely adore you all.
From: The Mechanic
“Was?” Steve arched an eyebrow.
If you hurt Tony again, I will kill you. You did hurt him last time and not just physically. (I knew you were the one responsible for him coming back one gigantic bruise, even before he confirmed it.) He worshiped you as a child. He had every Captain America comic book ever made and more memorabilia than anyone else except for maybe Phil. Then as an adult you found him lacking. That he’s only as good as his suits and his bank account. He never really did recover. Probably because a part of him believes that to be true. Tony has always been more than that. I’m just not sure if you really see it. I’m not sure if you want to see it.
T Stark: Which was supposed to be for your nephew’s eyes only.
Genius Princess: I'm glad to see that progress has been made now that the evil one has been vanquished.
Love: I really hope Friday’s shipment gets here before I have to knock him out again.
“I figured that when you were ready to talk about it, you would bring out the ring.”
The Boy in the Chair: What about a cartoon?
Again, we have tiny spoilers for Spider-Man: Homecoming in this chapter, but not a lot.
Nomad: That's because they are friends.
"Which is for your own safety because if you knew, Thanos would stop at nothing to get that information from you." The Princess answered solemnly.
"Of course, sir," Ana replied.
HSBF: What about Laura? Wait, you said something about May not being there because of Clint? Did something happen?
“And she is the heir apparent of Stark Industries, so I think we're good," Flash answered flippantly, pointing to Afia. "Does that kinda make you his boss or him, my boss?”
“You’re not a selfish prick for wanting that,” Steve reassured him.
“But we do playdates all the time.”
Venom: OK, I will make us hot cocoa. Everything is better with hot chocolate. Even the possibility of accidentally outing yourself to the entire school. It’s not like I can become even more of a pariah.
Ana Junior: Did this surprise you?
Me: I’m not signing the Accords.
“If you had signed the Mumbai agreement before his 18th birthday last week, you would have also been his guardian. However, since he is legally an adult, it's not necessary anymore. Although, I think I’m still allowed to call in medical excuses and things like that. So maybe ask the principal how that works with Flash being 18 even though I was his legal guardian before then because his parents were trash. I am still his legal next of kin." He is still protective of Flash even though he let him get his own apartment. (That Tony owns, but Flash doesn’t know that.)
HSBF: How are Clint and Laura?
Cuddle fiancé: You know, if we hadn’t been doing this long-distance relationship for a year and ½ your threat would be threatening. We haven’t even been in the same country since Valentine’s Day. I love it when we get to be physically intimate, but I can go without it for a long time.
Nomad: So it was deliberate and they were very thorough?
Warning: There are references to Ragnarok, Captain Marvel, Infinity War, and Endgame in here. It’s all connected.
Anthony: I would describe in detail what I want to do with you, but I’m pretty sure the Princess is reading this.
D Fitzsimmons: Yes. I was working on that when Nana and Romanoff went off to Japan to convince Barton to be the new guinea pig. Scott was out after getting turned into a baby.
"I bet you’re happy you’ll be getting Kevin back soon."
HSBF: Upstate facility. That way you can invite Benjamin. I doubt his aunt would let him skip classes to go to DC again, but maybe he can take the afternoon off. The Royal genius could use more time around 16-year-olds.
Red phone: You're the one that dragged him into this.
Anthony: I’m not even surprised you found out at the funeral. You’re right, Peggy did not have any other biological siblings, but Michael had a kid before dying, Gabriel. The poor baby wasn’t even born until after Michael died. The mother didn’t want to be a single mom so he was adopted by Peggy’s parents and raised as her brother even though she was long gone to America by then.
Tony: Actually let’s twist that around and tell the other what we think they would change. Then we can see if that person is right.
“I know you’re going to say honesty.”
I’ll try to come over soon, maybe the Saturday after Labor Day. I’m sure you’re going to need someone to commiserate with about the first few days of school. If you need me before then, Friday can get in touch. I’m working on a new AI for you. Also, please try to stay off YouTube or else Laura is going to go ‘full parent who works as a ninja spy’ on you. You do not want to deal with the Laura grounding.
HSBF: Loyalty
All timestamps are from Tony’s perspective. Remember that Malta is six hours ahead of New York and nine hours ahead of California. Tony forgot this. He was still on Mumbai time. Geniuses can sometimes be flaky.
Chief Mechanic: OK, now I know that I want you and the husband to check on the kids.
Red phone: I’m enjoying the fact that you’re okay with me trolling them like this. Friday is currently sending them a nice little conversation about me sucking you off against the nearest wall.
Tony: Dave, my number two in R&D, does. He is really annoyed that the new upstate facility doesn’t have a pencil sharpener. He emailed me twice about it. Or rather, he emailed Friday and she found it amusing.
“I’m well aware I am a bit of a prick. At least that’s what came out when Pepper and I were in couples therapy. I wonder if our old therapist would help us?” He and Steve definitely needed couples therapy.
Somewhere in Wakanda
Counselor Laura: I’m sure you regret not getting to punch him. Your other self did.
Me: I am to and I probably should stop texting you because I sort of just ran into the elevator door. It’s the nervous energy. I miss you so much. Only like another minute until I get to kiss you.
Me: Possibly.
“You and May are her parents. Did she call them her parents or her biological parents?” Tony asked
“And the one they would have to fictionalize the most By the way Disney is lobbying for you to get pardoned.”
Me: Well, you could always wait until you get back to DC because all I’m going to do is tell you to tell Phil that you love him.
HSBF: No, but I’m not surprised. You do have a lot of contacts there.
Me: I’m sure part of her is relieved that he won’t be subjected to some of the harsher penalties of the accords a.k.a. spending the rest of his life in a gel matrix on the raft. They are even talking about tracking bracelets for the rest of us. I’m going to have so much fun messing with that.
BITC: Ana could’ve done that.
Person boss is in love with: I’m not sure that Tony will appreciate this.
"Go to sleep Tony." He pulls Tony closer to him and kisses his forehead.
I ended up rewriting a few things after watching.
Tony Potts: No, I don't want to talk about how traumatic that was ever. I just want to undo it.
The Baltimore Incident refers to a slightly AU version of the events from the Emmy nominated Agents of Shield: Slingshot.
Tony: Yo-Yo is glaring at me, so I must go. I should be back by 7 PM. Do you want to eat dinner in? If I let her get whatever she wants yo-yo will pick up takeout from places that don’t actually do take out.
Dear Melinda:
This chapter begins immediately after the last one so much that the last message is repeated in this chapter.
This conversation takes place less than an hour after the last one.
“She had former Agent Barton knock out her ex-boyfriend to keep him from getting detained by the US government after his boyfriend was nearly killed by sunflower oil. She’ll understand. That book is dangerous and anybody who reads it will have to be taken out. I know what happened last time. Radcliffe looked at it for a second and he ended up kidnapping May after replacing her body with an LMD duplicate, made a deal with the Watchdogs, and then he kidnapped all of us to hand the agency over on a silver platter to a man who wants to kill all Inhumans and has a personal vendetta against Coulson.” Leo explained.
Red phone: It's just chemistry which I happen to have a PhD in. My lab experience relates well to making perfume, much better than cooking anyway. I developed the Iron Man fragrance myself.
“Not yet, but if Yo-Yo gets accidentally on purpose touched inappropriately again, it will be a near thing. Too many sleazy business leaders. I have 20 minutes." Tony said as he kissed Steve.
Thank you to everybody who has spent more than 3 years reading this story. This has been a real labor of love. This is not the end but just the end of this part because I have multiple sequels planned. The Infinity Saga is not done in this timeline yet. I have plans for three other stories set in this universe. Please subscribe to this series. I will post the first chapter to the follow-up story, Text Messages from the Edge of High School in the next few hours.
“I am. I am not sure about him.” Bobo one replied. Hunter was healing his face with something that Bobo came up with. Note to self figure out what it is and see if it's something he could sell to Pepper.
Me: I’m sorry.
Tony: And I’m really glad cryogenics is a thing. I’m glad you made it to this century. Sometimes I think you were born in the wrong one.
Nomad: I did notice that it sort of tastes better where I am now.
Director Snookums: You were under the influence of mind control.
“Thank you.”
Me: Okay. Mary has everything together. She’ll give me most of the details in the car. Although, she won’t be coming with us because Hanukkah starts on December 24
Red phone: The only reason why she still there is the president appointed her personally. SI will also announce some public private partnerships with the OES Bureau because their Assistant Secretary was nowhere near as condescending as Ross.
"Probably."
There are a few tiny WandaVision spoilers in this chapter. Remember, I will use things from the new material if it works for my continuity.
Rogers: She actually just called you Laura?
“Then he gently rejected me afterward.”
This conversation takes place about three days after the last one between Tony and Steve because Tony and Steve have to show some restraint, but it is really hard.
“Well you keep getting hurt trying to save the world and your boyfriend doesn’t like that. Also with Wanda leaving to start a new life with Vision and Clint back with his kids, I heard you need a third for your secret Avengers.”
Red phone: Don’t worry. I donated the unopened bottle to a charity auction.
DILF: You're here? Also, is that the shield in that bag you're carrying?
To be continued
Me: OK, then somebody wants a body like her big brother. Even AIs have sibling rivalry, apparently.
Me: And I’m using that to my advantage. Although, I think Scary and Agent suspect because they are actually halfway competent.
“You had those answers quick. Did Melinda go over something like this with you?” Tony asked.
Nomad: Tony!
Red phone: Probably because they don’t know that. But I recognized it from the manifesto video alone.
Tony: Shit! I didn't mean to send that part. Sorry. I haven’t slept in like 24 hours. You know I send weird text messages when I don’t sleep.
BITC: Oh shit!
“Teenagers are not the brightest of people. However, despite that, you should probably give Peter his suit back. He would be less likely to hurt himself with it on." Steve argued.
Tony: It became a pre-dinner meeting which is why I am being forcibly ushered out of here now that this meeting is over, instead of continuing to text message you.
Monkey lover 2: Good
Me: We tell each other the truth, but we make up answers for the public which is pretty much the story of my life
Person that cares about my boss: And he brought Lila with him?
“From our conversations, I don't think you really dated anybody before Pepper."
BITC: Oh, God. How did that happen? It wasn’t like another voice typo?
“I don't think there are answers to these questions," Tony added after a quiet moment of reflection.
Number one May is May Parker Riley. Incidentally, Melinda May is not May number two in Peter's address book but just Agent May. Really he has no imagination. Obviously, P Parker is Peter. This is his personal cell phone, after all, not the Avenger line. Also, because this isn't the Avenger line, the names of the under 18 are not being redacted. Although if a mention of their superpowers pops up, that would be edited. Tony and the princes are trying not to be Big Brother. Sometimes they overstepped their boundaries anyway.
HSBF: I can see how this would be better.
To be continued
Me: Did I ever mention that Jane Barnett is a former Shield agent herself. Jane Barnett is not even her real name. Just the one she’s using in her post Shield life.
I have agreed to assist her with her powers. We have technology designed to control powers of the gifted among our people but I believe I will need to customize the technology. If my brother can keep bringing broken white boys for me to fix then I should be able to help this young girl. She’s a baby. Thankfully, my brother has allowed it, despite being unaware of the true necessity.
Therefore, she walked to the house where Sergeant Barnes was currently staying. She was happy to see him attending his sheep. He seemed peaceful. Almost happy.
Thank you to everybody who read or reviewed the last chapter. This is another one of those very long overdue chapters. This is also the last chapter that will be posted before Spider-Man homecoming comes out. The plan is for some elements to be incorporated, but I won’t know exactly what until I see the movie even though the Internet is already a spoiler minefield. I’ve already given up on avoiding spoilers, but I’m going to try to keep my spaces spoiler free or at least so mixed up with things from my imagination that you won’t be able to tell.
Agent L. Barton: That tells me she’s a good fit if we do get the Avengers back together again. What else do you know about her?
Nomad: I wish we had time to do something like that but you’re busy doing good things such as trying to make sure people like Senator Nadeer do not round up everybody who is different.
Steve: Since then, a lot has changed. You got back with Pepper and then subsequently broke up and never told me.
Venom: I guess I can’t say that name either.
“You’re in love with her.” His eyes got large at her words.
Anthony: I’ll write to you later.
Ana Jr.: Your hypothesis is correct. You would only be allowed to access the files that Stark would want you to see. Although your Friday may have different protocols than I do. Dr. Stark Rogers is not my father, but rather my grandfather, although I do call Afia my big sister. I was built by Leo and the princess after they gave Afia her body.
Me: Not since she threw me into a wall. Although it is nice to now know that Skye-quake’s real name is Daisy.
Person that cares about my boss: Because he actually is meeting with the president?
Tony Potts: Not until after Morgan was born, because I’m afraid of becoming Howard, I finally started therapy again. I should've after we lost, but I didn't. I'm glad the other me got treatment sooner.
Genius Princess: Although if you’re reading this message, then that means that we’ve at least figured out how to send text messages to 2223 of the original James Leopold timeline. I’m going to see if I can push Deke’s mission report to you as an attachment. I have no idea if I will be successful.
“Thanks, Thor.” Tony said laying his head on Steve’s.
StarkAE: Oh shit. That went as badly as possible. Everything is burning. Did we lose the pilots?
Nomad: I prefer being your Cuddle Bunny.
"And if that doesn't happen?"
Nomad: Spying on me for version of Shield that was really Hydra. I didn't even know your real name at the time.
Number one May: When Tony asked me if I could take care of Miles for the weekend, he said that you would all be doing science stuff at the Lighthouse. However, I just saw him giving a press conference with the President from the rose garden officially pardoning Capt. America.
Me: Friday did not edit out the name of your neighbor because she didn’t think that was information that could identify you. However, Agent Agent knows her because she used to work HR at Shield before things went fubar.
Me: Love you too
Anthony: Okay, somebody posted images of me visiting Dr Suarez’s office in Midtown and apparently that is quelling Wall Street’s worries.
Boss: When you’re done relocating my therapist, can you find out everything you can on Cuddle Bunny’s post defrosting hookups. Who knows if Hydra or someone else set up a honey trap for him.
Agent Johnson: As planned, I did follow. So the Bifröst is nowhere near as much fun as I thought it would be. Mainly because it shattered mid transport because we had a weapon tossed at us.
“Totally reasonable.”
Tony: Okay, I have my non-alcoholic mimosa and an obscene amount of blueberry pancakes because Lily Bear just had to have blueberry pancakes this morning, so I’m all ready for us to dig into the questions.
Purple Princess: Her mom died in the battle of New York, so I’m going to let her be mad at me. We have other classmates whose parents have been killed by Stark weapons. That means I have their blood on my hands. I’m the merchant of death Junior, or maybe it’s the third. So yes, I’m going to let people be mad and hurl insults at me. Actually, one of our classmates hates me because her family got expelled from Wakonda. So I have a lot of people mad at me for a lot of reasons.
Thank you to everybody who read or reviewed the last chapter. Comments make me happy.
“Remember all those times I told you that I felt like the database with the locations of all the special people registered because of the Accords was like creating a super villain hit list?” Tony prompted his boyfriend.
Agent L. Barton: It happens to every parent at least once.
“Tony!” Steve admonished.
Anthony: Of course. Rhodey just called to curse me out for nominating him for head of an agency that may or may not actually exist.
Anthony: Yes that’s allowed. I feel like texting you would be okay in that situation.
Me: That’s not the question.
“I have to make things better. I arrived literally a day too late to save Lincoln but Vijay is still here.” At his words, various pieces of the puzzle clicked together in Jemma's mind.
Me: What is there left to talk about?
Counselor Laura: But she came back? You have a house in the woods in upstate New York together?
“I’m not surprised.”
StarkAE: Probably because most of them had no idea what they were doing.
Pepper pot: No problem. I'll call him. Do you know how many days you might be gone?
“I could understand that. I read your medical file. Even back then, there were treatments for some of your medical problems that did not require dad tinkering with your DNA.”
Cuddle bunny: Clint says that she is the wisest woman on the planet.
Me: And packing. Mostly packing. It’s hard to rebuild his image considering everything he’s done. And I say this as somebody who’s bounced back from murder bots.
“It’s probably rude to ask those questions. However, I've been trying to find a program for my Nana. She hasn't been the same since my Grandpa Bobo died. Although he didn't really die. He was just bounced back to the past, created a new timeline, and is now sleeping with Hunter. Because of course, the guy couldn't just be a twig in the stream."
Red Malibu: I think we may still be able to pull this off. Talbot agreed mostly because he really likes Mrs. Purple Arrow and doesn’t like the bad guys using little kids as collateral, but he did sign off on the arrangement. So there’s little Ross can do once the press conference happens, no signing required, I promise.
Anthony: Real history.
Someone in the Senate, along with the help of a disgruntled individual of inhuman ancestry, were responsible for the Watchdogs getting the information. Because not all the information was fake, we have been relocating certain individuals on the list. The Purple Arrow family have relocated to the compound because thanks to the wording of the Accords, if you’re staying at an Avenger facility you don’t have to be on the list.
HSBF: They’re trying to lock you out again?
“Well, where it was supposed to happen anyway. Bonus, there is an ATCU/shield base/Wakanda outpost underneath in case villains attacked or aliens invaded during the middle of the ceremony. Although, if only ninjas crash, I would be happy. I can’t believe Simmons decided to come back here for their first-anniversary party.” Of course, that may have something to do with just moving to the neighborhood to be closer to mommy Fitz, but he’s not sure he’s told Steve yet about the relocation of his favorite science team to shield’s B site. They’ve been busy talking about wedding stuff and everything else.
Tosha: I know you don’t consider yourself an Avenger anymore due to certain things that we are not going to talk about in writing. However, you were the one who traveled back to 2018 in the other timeline. You were with Simmons when she was putting everything together with Deke. Did she discuss her change of plan with you?
“Shower first then food,” Steve said pushing Tony to the shower just after giving him a gentle peck on the lips.
I also wonder if this chapter went above the T rating. I didn’t mean for it to happen; I just accidentally walked into it. I forgot this was an in-person conversation which means we get to hear thoughts, and Steve has some non-PG-13 thoughts. We are all aware most of Tony’s thoughts are above PG-13, especially when Steve May-Rogers is concerned.
I was initially going to keep this conversation going on longer in this form, But I realized it was very confusing to read and would have been hard to interpret for those using screen reading software. They rarely tell you when the text switches to being italicized.
Flaming head is Tony‘s nickname for Robbie Reyes, a.k.a. Ghost Rider II. In this universe, he is a member of Steve’s Secret Avengers.
This is also the final update before the series finale of AOS. I'm trying not to cry. At least the story will keep me sane
Venom: Afia has been telling me she is a robot since we first met each other, and I didn’t believe her. What is wrong with me?
MayMQ: Because you never know what could happen here. Besides, you’re the one who really wants to train with it.
Ana Junior: Speaking of Hunter. He also brought you a frappe and bacon cheese croissant.
“I’m sure you just want me comfortable. Lucky for you, I stopped sleeping in the nude once I became responsible for a small child.” And that’s the second time Steve thought about a naked Tony in the last 10 minutes. “It seems like every other night, there was a monster under her bed, and she always comes to me after she caught Hunter with his special friend. I banned sleepovers after that. Although now I know that friend was Simmons.”
May: Unfortunately, we have no one with a medical degree full-time. Banner has seven PhDs and not one MD. That would’ve been fucking useful.
“After comparing notes with the princess, I am sure they can but it’s still not a position you want to put your friends in if you can help it.”
They were currently sitting on one of the couches in the guest suite in the embassy. It was a lot nicer than the Shield rooms on the other floors. Around 3 AM, when Dr. Leopold showed up with his husband, Hunter pushed them all to sleep. They were only successful in getting her and Flash to leave. They opted to just sleep in the same room together. Which was a great decision because sometime around 9 AM, Peter just crawled into bed with them. Afia texted her pictures. She wished she could just send them to Ned, but Peter and Flash would kill her.
“While the first part of that is whenever I'm in the creative zone, and the second part is the last night with the kids. You know that Robin has trouble sleeping because of her visions. But she likes when I sing to her. It relaxes her.” Tony explained.
“He’s probably doing it just to mess with them. Some things are universal,” Afia mumbled under breath.
M is State Department shorthand for the Under Secretary for Management. Let’s just say that the person who took this job after the Ross Administration was not happy at all with the skeletons they encountered.
Person that cares about my boss: Of course he did. I am starting to believe that he really is in love with me or at least has a crush on me because of his jealous behavior.
Me: That being said, I cannot guarantee that future messages will be free of pornographic content. Cuddle Bunny is no blushing virgin. Underneath the blue and white American exterior lives a very kinky bastard.
There was another drawing that actually looked like she just drew the current situation of him standing behind her, looking at her pictures, except the Princess was with them. That just seemed weird, but then again he knows a soon to be seven-year-old that can make himself invisible. So really nothing should surprise him at this point.
HSBF: I watched from the sidelines until I was sure you were actually going to get medical help. You hate doctors.
“I sent her a picture of her husband wrapped around you.”
“What? How did that happen?” Steve asked.
Love: This is the beginning of the Shield/State Department feud?
“I like” love “you, so I made peace with that.” He’s forgiven Howard for that because he doesn’t want to think of a world without Steve.
Me: Actually, Stars & Stripes sounds like Chris Evans. He may have been compensated for some voice work. Okay, that’s probably going to make that “I’m really dating Chris Evans” rumor worse.
Counselor Laura: My husband also didn’t always agree with how Shield treated enhanced people even back then, so he was wary of the treaty as written. He was worried that some of those worst practices could come back.
Thank you to everybody who read or reviewed the last conversation. You’re all fabulous.
Nomad: Apparently you were having a torrid affair with Natasha and that’s why she sided with you during the accords.
Me: Pay attention to the wedding and stop texting me.
PS: Did you figure out how the Watchdogs managed to get into the Accords database?
(See the end of the chapter for
Love: And I’m sure Tony had nothing to do with that?
Me: Not right now that Senator Hateful is making things worse and Ross is pissed about me making a fool out of him
Anthony: I figure you would not yell at Friday. She is your favorite.
Me: Maybe she wants to take Vision back from RED. I don’t know.
At least he thinks so. He’s having trouble reconciling this May with Melinda Gardner. How much were the two individuals the same? How much was an act? Steve still wasn’t entirely sure.
Venom: And I'm a Level 3 friend?
Anthony: What was the question?
CoulsonPJ: You could take his boyfriend down to the gym instead. Weren’t you going to have lunch with him? How did that go?
To be continued…
Hunter: Leo just got into Deke’s report, which is apparently a transcript of the conversation he had with Ana.
Me: Love makes you make questionable decisions sometimes. Get me back there and in a position where Ross can’t use my kids or my wife against me.
BITC: I’m sorry I said the wrong thing. My dad will be picking me up in an hour, and I think he would let me go to the Lighthouse.
Nomad: You know we are going to have to talk about Bucky eventually.
BITC: So am I taking notes for classes Monday?
MayMQ: You wouldn't let us change the paint job.
Nomad: I was also already up. I forgot to put the phone on silent and thanks to super soldier hearing, I heard the phone chime when Pepper messaged me.
Venom: Is this the time we remind you that your uncle’s death wasn’t your fault? I thought that was a November thing.
“Okay,” Leo said as the Princess physically dragged him away.
“I saw those growing up, and this is not that. I love May. I really do, but it’s not the right type of love.” Steve tried to explain.
Venom: What did she tell you?
The boss: It was tempting when I found Simmons’ lab stash, but I called Steve to help me get rid of it. I've also gone to an AA meeting a day with Laura and had a few mini therapy sessions with her. But it’s still hard to accept that maybe things are so screwed up right now because I never tried to reach out to Steve before it was too late.
Me: Yet. Let’s be honest.
Person that cares about my boss: True.
Nomad: I like it just fine, maybe because I'm not completely attached to the old versions because I was frozen when they came out. I've only watched half of the TOS episodes and have even gotten to the newer stuff.
Me: I don’t think certain parts of the population could take the blue-eyed blonde in office with you as his husband. We would have to be married right? Just living together would be way too much?
Monkey lover 2: Of course he is.
Anthony: It got postponed for work things. Shield and DODC work things. Never try to work with the federal government. Years of it working smoothly without interference and now that my BFF oversees a sister agency, chaos.
Anthony love: Okay, maybe I should’ve started there.
“I’m trying.”
Cuddle Bunny: Yes. I think Friday is mad at us.
Dealing with the death of a parent is hard. Honestly, I don't think I've really dealt with my parents’ death until recently. But working with Peter has also helped me deal with a lot of things that I ignored for a long time. I’m glad I could be there for him. It gave me something to focus on with my boyfriend in Johannesburg doing charity work. (That’s another thing I trust you not to leak to the tabloids.)
Tony couldn’t help but walk over to see what she was drawling. For all he knew, she could be an engineering prodigy. Tony was putting circuit boards together at that age, and the two Fitz is were putting toasters together from scrap parts by that point as well. Tony is also pretty sure the Princess was redesigning her brother’s armor by that age.
Nomad: Yes, and you just had to break into the Shield servers. This was already in the mail by that time.
“We are absolutely clueless idiots.” So ridiculously clueless, Tony thought at that moment.
Agent America: That's what happened. We received confirmation from S's former assistant. That action made her quit.
Let me know what you think and if you want more. You may inspire me to start writing more immediately
This is a ridiculously long A/N, so bear with me: Because I was asked previously I’m going to take a moment to provide a little bit of background for those who are not watching Agents of Shield, which will be helpful for this chapter and a few more later on. (Available on Netflix in the US. Go watch, it’s tons of fun. It’s already been renewed for seasons six and seven.) The following explanation contains spoilers for the first five seasons of Agents of Shield related to the complicated relationship of FitzSimmons and how it relates to this story.
“Because the Captain America still comes with apple pie and hot fudge swirls." And was secretly Tony's favorite, but he’s never ever going to tell Steve that.
Tony: Friday, add Buffy to the possible list of things to watch while on dates.
Steve: Oh
“At least it’s an option now. We made the right choice coming up here if Hunter helped her get to that realization.” Steve rationalized.
The Mechanic: I feel like there’s a story there.
Wasn’t the Infinity War trailer fabulous? I know where I’m going with this story. I’m going to try to have everything drafted before Infinity War drops. I’m worried I may be too emotionally distraught to write for a little while so I want to have as much banked as possible. I don’t think the movie will change the actual ending of the story, but it might change the post credit scenes. We will see if that is still the case as we go forward.
TMNS: Karen says that she’s busy processing the data that overloaded  Afia. Karen is taking care of all necessary ATCU functions now. She’s also trying to figure out how to deliver your messages to Steve. The estimated arrival time is three hours.
Me: Yes, when he told me about Friday’s mass text message about us being together.
Me: Actually, I wish you would just come home. I miss you. You’re still my friend after everything.
HSBF: That’s probably for the best. Now that the arrests have been made does that mean that you get to go home?
Me: But we’re going to stop it. So your extra preparations are just paranoia on your part, but they’re still going to do it.
Purple Princess: Yes, they shared a bed last night. Also, notice the absence of shirts. I'm almost sure my dad's responsible for these accommodations, but he's not saying anything. I'm using the Avenger channels because of the location where said picture was taken.
Red phone: They really want to know how Nomad ended up with a super suit that could stop a bullet from penetrating his heart. I really didn’t need to see that footage.
D Fitzsimmons: Better for humans, maybe not best for the rest of the universe. Or maybe not. The snap could've happened in that timeline as well. I don't know because the Blues deleted history.
Me: I know.
Me: And hand-to-hand combat instructor. He already said he would train Rio since she’s going to be with us on missions as medical support. He’s also seen some of Spidey senior’s early YouTube videos and is concerned.
Me: Somethings can't be fixed. And I think Pepper and me are one of those things.
Me: Except you kind of do know her, biblically in fact.
I’m not going to hold him trying to kill me against him. I can’t, considering what I did. I’m sorry about that. I really am. The doctors keep explaining to me that I didn’t have control or choice in what I did, but that doesn’t make the nightmares go away. I don’t think they ever will. Maybe they’ll just come less often, or maybe the doctors here will teach me more skills to deal with it. We’re working on it.
From: Tony_Carbonell
“That does not surprise me,” Steve responds.
BFF Ned: Divorce sucks.
“She has also drawn you and me growing old together, so I hope we find that pathway." Steve almost sounded hopeful.
Me: It probably was always like this. Although I’m sure Virginia probably finds it less stressful this way.
Nomad: Okay, I had four grilled cheese sandwiches for lunch. They’re just so small. It’s just sometimes I still feel guilty about getting extra food. I know mom sometimes went without eating just so I could.
Pepper Potts cell phone
The new consultant: Regarding your code name, I don’t know. I think it’s randomly assigned. I’m apparently stuck with the new consultant. I don’t even know who the old consultant was.
Nomad: I’m not going to break up with you because of that.
Me: He is okay with us trying to do a less than platonic relationship, but he is worried because my track record is god-awful. Although you still could end up with a shovel talk due to the Siberia incident, but I’m not sure.
Red phone: I was 13 when she told me about this friend who liked both and that it was okay. I was 16 when she told me it was specifically you in an effort to cheer me up after some random board member got angry about me having a boyfriend. She made me promise to never tell anyone else. I kept that promise even when you’re Bucky crush was becoming dangerous.
Friday: I have sent the list of 36 questions to your Stark pad. I suggest that you ask each other these questions during the drive to Manhattan.
Friday: My prime parameter is to ensure the well-being of Sir. I am doing what is necessary.
Melinda: She sees it as an encouraging development.
Tony: Honey, I know you have a saving people thing, but somethings can’t be salvaged, usually most of my interpersonal relationships. Right now, my relationship with Happy resembles Pompeii.
Venom: I’m still having trouble reconciling Benji with Spidey, and really, I shouldn’t.
So far, I know that there are lots of portals surrounding Sakaar. I wonder if I can manipulate the portals with my powers? It’s something I can ask Loki about when I’m speaking to him again.
“And this is why Friday was pulled? To the point that she can’t even answer simple requests.” Tony asked skeptically.
Blue phone: You don’t have to answer this question if you don’t want to, but do you still have a crush on me?
Counselor Laura: Do you need a meeting?
Hunter: That you thought he died sending you all back to 2018.
Me: I kind of blew that, but I never really had a private persona. I’ve always been on.
From: The Mechanic
Anthony love: Just for that, I’m not pulling you into the first empty conference room that we see. No welcome home handjob for you.
May: Yes. Kamala’s going to be mad that she missed you.
Purple arrow 2018: I’m sorry. I’m sorry I left. I am sorry that I left you there alone. I’m really sorry that you accidentally got kidnapped by some other version of me. He is another version of me?
Me: Furious, especially because I don’t know what he was doing. I could’ve helped him out if I knew.
Anyway please call me when you get a chance. I would love to face time with you. Also, you should get to see my new apartment since I’m sure you’re paying for it.
Purple Princess: Actually, Leo did. He’s pretty wealthy. He made a lot of money in the stock market outside of SI.
May: I agree. You shouldn’t go alone, though.
With Infinity War being pushed up a week and me having to do other things like cons and taxes between now and then I realized I will not be able to finish the story before the movie comes out. If I keep on the current posting schedule of once a week, I’ve actually drafted every chapter between now and when the movie comes out. I do know how the story is going to end. Infinity war will only effect the post-credits scene of the story and my decision to do a sequel or just extra post-credits scenes. This is an MCU story. Of course, I’m planning post-credits scenes.
Nomad: He flirts with you too. He flirts with everybody.
Anthony: Yes. Although I wonder if you hate him more, considering you’re the one who thinks that I can get away with killing him. This is why this particular conversation is getting switched out with something really graphic involving rimming.
Me: That’s fine.
Tony: Even if it is with an android?
To Be continued.
“I think Friday can show you security footage of Tony yelling at me because I wasn’t there when he needed me and ripping his armor off of his chest.” She wondered if this was the same incident that Tony talked about briefly.
The cell phone of James “Leo” Leopold a.k.a. Monkey Lover 2
Me: I didn’t protect you’re ‘Not a girlfriend’ for her, but for Aunt Peggy.
: Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (S.H.I.E.L.D.) designated codename for Dr. Anthony “Tony” Stark - Carbonell. He uses his Mother’s maiden name privately not publicly. Goes by Anthony Carbonell on twitter. Only a few SI staff members and celebrities such as Chris Evans knows this. Does not like to be referred to as doctor unless he hates you or you are being a condescending asshole.
Me: He knows too much about me for him to be a fake.
“I love her, but it's not that type of love. We are two people who care deeply about one another and are building a family together.” Steve explained.
HSBF: No to the restaurants. We are trying to keep a low profile for the moment. No, I’m not surprised about your tailor. You just want me wrapped in new clothes.
Cuddle bunny: If the bomb was detonated, most of the EU would have been exposed and transformed. If the winds were right there was a 72% probability that the gas could have triggered mutation as far as the northern border of Wakanda.
Me: In other good news, I have a replacement assistant.
Nomad: You want to do that to me on a regular basis.
For those of you reading this on A3O, I’ve uploaded two chapters within just a few hours of each other. The first chapter is a package of art that Steve sent to Tony in hard copy. Thanks to him, we had to raise the rating of the story. I always thought it would be Tony that cause the rating to go up but it was Steve.
"Steve was an absolute mess when that happened. I doubt she would want to put him through that again. I don't want to see him go through that again." Why did Tony have a feeling that Steve reacted worse than reported. Clint wasn't exactly giving details on his time with Sugar Bear.
After watching the trailer for Endgame yesterday, I really hope Leo will be successful. We shall see.
Me: Have you successfully convinced Stark of that?
Nomad: You’re going out with the Colonel?
“We screwed up so badly in Siberia that it led to us fucking up with the purple one,” Tony added. “We really, really regret the Siberia fuck up along with not taking time to fix it then because maybe if we fixed it, then we wouldn’t be dealing with the mess we have now.”
CoulsonPJ: Yes
FRIDAY: Several images are already in your Nomad email account.
The following, is artwork created by Steve for Tony’s eyes only (he really hopes SHIELD does not intercept). In real life our artist is Misaky0 who was willing to do the artwork in character. Give her an extra round of kudos and nice reviews.
Steve: I have been doing play dates with you and Pepper for the last three years, and you never said anything before.
May: Why do you think we need a licensed therapist for this mission?
Counselor Laura from 2023: It is good to know that Tony came and got you. I’m glad your dad is with you. I’m sure your Uncle Tony, Fitz, James, and the princess will get me home soon.
Tony: It depends on your philosophy about time but some believe that you can’t change the future. So what if you knew the future and couldn’t change it? That would be awful.
Anthony: Most of which are under 18. That puts me in more of a mentor role. Somehow I’ve become a role model.
Purple Princess: Because he was worried about me. I’m glad you did this on the secure line. Friday, we had two different alien invasions. One you’ve probably seen parts of on Twitter involving the Asgardians contingent.
“Good idea, and I'm not going to ask how you know about that protocol.”
Agent M: Maria was our contact to the Avengers. If she felt you had a need to know, she would’ve told you. She was in contact with Coulson the entire year you were searching for Hydra bases
Nomad: You are so ridiculous sometimes. I’m glad you’re making friends. I think it’s what you need right now.
Me: I am not your father.
Me: I am not planning on it. At least not intentionally, but cameras are everywhere now. We’ve swept for bugs twice in the last two days. Thankfully, the new travel Friday program can disable everything.
Girl Friday: Thank you, little sister.
Tony: I really don’t want to know about the strange mating habits of Agent Agent.
Love: Only after the fact. We should've just locked them in a room with each other and a box of condoms.
“No, you don’t understand because you want to see your best friend,” Tony responded.
Me: Because he deserved it. He was a self-righteous prick who kept asking me if I made unauthorized contact with various enhanced people.
Tony: So awful. They’re even breaking out the unflattering pictures of her in sweatpants. I’m going to invent something that makes it so their SD cartridges are destroyed when they tried to take pictures of us from the balcony across the way. I feel like I’m going to need to do something big to distract them.
Tony: That’s between me and the ballot box. Although, when you had to save a guy from his VP that tried to kill him, you kind of get a very low opinion of the person. It has been going downhill ever since.
Me: Maybe two or three months afterward. I also prefer midday in a park. Maybe even in Central Park?
HSBF: Not happening.
Steve: I’ve heard. Friday is very chatty.
Agent Laura: It doesn’t anymore.
Although it may be tempting to mention you have a boyfriend, the next time the reporters camp out in front of our house, I won’t say anything. Your secret’s safe with me. Although I am old enough to remember that Tony Stark gay sex tape scandal, so I’m not that surprised.
“Although, I am sure the traumatic brain injury didn’t help the situation,” Jemma said, trying to remember various things she read in various medical textbooks about schizophrenia.
Love: The desire for Stark to invent dangerous life killing things?
Anyway, I miss you and I can’t wait to see you again. I’ll try to, soon as I’m able to, if you want me to come. It’s your choice, though. I’ll try to give you whatever you need to rebuild or recover.
Thank you to everybody who read or review the last conversation. Before the pants can hit the floor, we have to have some adult conversations. So here we are. Because I was deprived of this in canon, we are so having this.
Love: So how much of what the tabloids are saying is true?
The mechanic: I wanted to at least wait a year until the wedding anyway because I’m not stealing Simmons’ thunder.
“What are the first two?” Am I one of your regrets? Steve wanted to ask instead, but he knew better.
Tony: Apparently. Although I don’t think the lack of a translation for Hydra is why at least two of the representatives showed no shame at all. I wonder if any of these people are ex-Hydra members that nobody caught.
Counselor Laura: I’m an agent too now. I’m mostly working with kids, but my hands aren’t clean.
Me: Thinking that name is extra ridiculous.
Tony: If you get blasted out of this plane of existence, I’m going to count that as dying and so did the person administering the pool. Platypus was mentally preparing himself for next of kin notifications, as soon as he was done dealing with General T.
Me: By my standards anyway.
Me: I’m not even sure. I think Benji was involved maybe. It doesn’t matter because the 36 questions that lead to love interview is dead.
After 15 minutes of near frigid silence, where even Steve has given up on trying to have a conversation, Tony decides to break out the video of Spidey Junior, Ms. Marvel, and the Barton kids playing soccer. Nate wasn’t actively playing, but he was on the sidelines cheering his big sister and brother on, even though they were on opposite sides. Everybody loves kids. Okay Romanoff loves her kids and the Barton kids are hers. Tony is pretty sure he saw her cry on the way to the airport when she had to leave the kids behind.
Monkey lover 2: Of course not. She’s not even here. I don’t want to be killed by my baby brother.
Me: Friday is taking our actual answers and going to come up with something fit to print. That’s kind of what she’s been doing with the fake messages.
Me: Hey, let's watch the movie.
Anthony: What about Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, Charlie Bartlett, or Chaplin?
Melinda: We are going to need him to get Laura back to her own time at a minimum. We already screwed up once on our own.
D FitzSimmons: These messages aren't going through, are they?
The mechanic: You are a bloodthirsty one, Leo. You should do fantastic against the board. I’m glad you’re the heir apparent.
“I see that. I guess I have a place to start, but I still don’t know how to tell him about me being bisexual. I feel bad now for keeping it a secret.”
"Love you too." Tony heard Steve say as he walked out the door. It really took all his willpower not to turn around and run back in there. Agent America may have been holding his wrists for dear life.
Me: The National Aquarium is a great place for employee bonding, especially because I can’t do bars anymore. Now we’re having dinner before coming back to the Playground.
“The English language really screwed us over with only one word for love. Other languages do better.”
Tony Potts: Considering what happened to Vision here, it's probably better for my mental health not to. She was also a victim of the decimation.
“I’m really glad Director Rhodes punched him in the dick.”
Me: I guess that’s question 9 from that press activity we’re supposed to do. Also, why are you texting me again so soon? Melinda will not be happy with either of us.
Tony: But she did agree for Spidey to go to power person’s training camp this winter as well as weekend patrolling. Yo-Yo is going to be supervising weekend patrols until her California relocation.
To be continued
Girl Friday: That makes sense. Jeffrey wasn’t there for the briefing last night.
This chapter takes place a few hours after the last one. Also, it’s been nearly 4 months since the “Siberia Incident”. (Don’t you think that’s a more appropriate name than Civil War?)
I hope you told Kevin to get a couple of cases of those cookies for Monday's thing at the Children's Hospital. Yes, I'm still going. I need to show the world I'm not dead and that I'm not afraid.
“Get over it. This is his life and you should be well aware now that Tony Stark does what he wants and what he wants is Steve.” Natasha said to Happy as soon as she dragged him into his room.
Hunter: So that’s what we are calling him.
Nomad: Because you are lonely and you need someone to worry about you.
Me: I think it will happen. Honestly you’re starting to fall off the radar of most people except for Ross and certain members of the DOD community. They are too busy with Quake, the Robin Hood bank robber, right now to worry about Nomad, freer of kidnapping victims.
“Okay, I think there’s a bug with Karen and she thinks that Monkey Lover is two different people,” Tony seemed puzzled.
May: You wouldn’t need some with an MD, if I brought Dr. Rio Morales in. Her husband was ex shield. He was lost during the decimation. Which spurred her on to get her MD. Her son is friends with my daughter. When we have a medical emergency, we call her in.
Anthony: I'm sure there was a Hydra plant in the mail room who was just fucking with you.
Me: And you weren’t expelled?
HRH: Good. Does your boss know that he’s meeting with me and not my brother?
Nomad: I’ll try, if you try. I might be able to get to Johannesburg a little bit earlier
“This is not how I wanted to find out my grandfather is bisexual. Nana never mentioned this.” The alleged grandson replied.
StarkAE: We beat the shit out of each other in Siberia less than six months ago. I’m well aware that we kind of hit rock bottom in regards to our relationship and that’s counting the fuck-up during the invasion which led to your real boss getting shanked by an Asgardian.
May: Looking at possible divorce attorneys. I think it’s time to move forward. We will always be friends, but this marriage was an arrangement to keep the kids and ourselves from falling apart in the aftermath of the hell that was April 2018. It’s not necessary anymore, especially if he’s ready to be with Tony. I think as long as we’re still married, Steve won’t move forward.
Me: Really?
Dear Mr. Hogan:
HSBF: We worked together before the fall. She’s really good. She also has a degree in chemistry which might be helpful since you won’t be around for daily consults.
Anthony: Ex-husband and it’s complicated.
Football Hunter: Because it beats long-term inpatient care? Look, you know you couldn’t stay at Shield full-time. It was terrible for your health. Are you worried you made the wrong choice in leaving?
Me: But not Ross, not at all. I know he has his own agenda and I’m working with people like his advisor on enhanced person affairs, Ana Karr, to make sure he doesn’t turn everyone enhanced into his own private army. That’s why I’m spending so much time in DC right now.
Jemma: However, my other timeline counterpart is pregnant with a little Fitzsimmons. Their first anniversary was this weekend.
“Okay, obviously that is real reason why you brought Sam with you. Are you trying to play Avenger matchmaker?”
“I guess this means I really need to be on speaking terms with the other Avengers before that happens.”
Blue phone: Natasha tried to set me up with half of SHIELD before everything fell apart.
“Not as much at MIT. I was there under my mom’s maiden name. Actually, I did a lot of stuff under my mom's maiden name.” Tony explained.
Red phone: Actually, I keep Ross on hold most of the time. I think his chief of staff really hates me.
“We will leave,” Agent Piper said with a sigh. “Try not to cause an international incident.”
Also let’s be honest, you prefer food over flowers. You never eat enough when you get into the creative zone. The cookie bouquet will be waiting for you when you get back from where ever you are. No, Jim wouldn’t tell me anything. (Or Happy for that matter, who you really need to call.) Why did you decide to put him in charge of a spy agency that technically doesn’t exist anymore?
“I just wish I could talk to her to explain.”
To: The Mechanic
“What do I do now? Does the entire school know I’m gay yet?” He asked the AI. He doesn’t think Ned would be purposely malicious. However, Peter was keeping the truth about his own orientation from his best friend for a reason.
Venom: I really should change my first name. I feel like that name was their first act of cruelty against me.
HSBF: Apparently, you found the new person to hate.
Counselor Laura: The Genius Princess likes your idea, and I think she's going to convince the others to run with it. Although you probably already knew that because you were reading those messages.
Avenger Friday: Yes, along with your 3 children.
Kitty brother: But you do not?
“Hopefully, not ours,” Flash mumbled from beside him.
The Mechanic: Hey are you still going to be under General T? Now that President Ellis is getting another four years, does this mean that Talbot will be dealing with a confirmation hearing?
Nomad: I finally watched most of the Star Wars movies
Me: That wouldn’t be that hard. Although I would worry about a certain person from HR trying to break into the office to shoot me. I am just kind of glad she’s at one of the remote offices outside of the DC Metro.
Also in this universe, all DC characters are purely fictional.
Tony: It’s okay. He’s allowed to be a foster parent now—a foster parent to Flash of all people, but still a foster parent. When we were talking about that, I think I figured out how Morgan came to be.
Red phone: We were thinking an all black costume for stealth? What do you think of Nomad as your new codename? Connor came up with it.
Genius Princess: Although if you’re reading this message, then that means that we’ve at least figured out how to send text messages to 2223 of the original James Leopold timeline. I’m going to see if I can push Deke’s mission report to you as an attachment. I have no idea if I will be successful.
Counselor Laura: I don’t think anybody would want that. I mean, it wouldn't just be Morgan. It would be any baby born in the last five years. That would be repeating what Thanos did. That wouldn’t be right.
Me: That’s all I can ask. I’ll do the same.
Anthony: You are hotter, especially when you’re wearing a shirt two sizes too small. Although it might be a little while on the movie because Paramount is pissed at me. Disney now has the rights to do a Tony Stark and possibly, eventually, an Avengers movie.
Love: You try to retire for a year and all the codenames are different.
“That doesn’t surprise me. Although, it’s good to see your face.” It’s been only a little more than a week since Malta but he’s so happy to be seeing Tony right now.
“It took Agent Agent getting shanked by Loki before we stopped acting like toddlers. Yes, he got better. But let’s not have a repeat. The uncivil toddler squabble last spring was bad enough.”
"Because Laura is mostly dealing with actual children." Tony added. "You know Steve isn't much for sharing. I'm sure he would have told you eventually. Okay, I'm sure May would have told you eventually. Or possibly Clint."
Anthony: Without me. I'm hurt.
To: Tony_Carbonell
Tony: But I’m not going to think about that because I rented out an entire videogame place for the evening so Spidey Senior won’t have time to remember that his Uncle was murdered in front of him this time last year.
"That makes sense. I would've done a lot for that kid, including trying to come up with an answer for question 33.”
Red phone: Sometimes. When things in my head get too jumbled, which explains why I developed a program to scan things from napkins easier. I think there’s about four file cabinets filled with designs sketched on napkins or Kit Kat wrappers from when they used to be paper. I did that a lot in college.
Nomad: You think something’s going to happen?
May: Okay. You’re right.
Tony: I will believe it when I see it. Your upgraded shield was awesome but we’ll see.
Nomad: Unfortunately yes. I fucked him a few times before I realized he had levels of internalized homophobia that I haven’t seen since the 40s. I wasn’t going to deal with that again.
Pepper pot: And if you undo the decimation, then they won’t need to stay married.
Me: Yes, because I’m pretty sure Pepper is the first person I’ve had sex with since college that knew going in that she was sleeping with Tony Stark, the emotionally screwed up person and not Tony Stark media persona. She couldn’t deal with Tony Stark, superhero, but no one’s perfect, not even my Pepper Pot.
Nomad: So am I. What will happen when they find out you’re recovering under government protection?
I did get to see Spider Verse in a special showing last week and it was just the best. Please go see this movie. It’s fantastic. Normally, I would not enforce a 30 day no spoiler discussion moratorium for a non-MCU movie, but this is one of the few places where we’ve seen Miles on screen. Also, this story does utilize the multi-verse. So if you want to know how this movie may be influencing some things in this story, feel free to PM me on FF dot net. But I will be using a few things.
Me: I would say that it can’t be that bad but you keep proving me wrong.
Me: That’s where it gets more complicated. Spidey Senior webbed up several members of the watchdogs before they could attack another Inhuman that lives in his building.
“One conversation isn’t going to solve anything.”
The Boy in the Chair: You’re still working on regular driving.
Conversation 3: Is This Salvageable?
Thank you to everybody who read the last chapter. You guys really do love the art chapters. You are all absolutely wonderful and keep me in the creative zone. Since the last chapter was so short, you get this one in under a week. Also, please note Tony has not read Steve’s card yet, although someone else did.
Thank you to everybody who read or reviewed the last chapter. The original plan was for this conversation and similar ones following to be tacked on to the end of the text message conversations to keep with the style of the rest of the story. However, I realized things were getting long that way. So, I decided to make in person conversations as a separate story element.
“Now I really want to take your pants off again. Why did you bother putting them back on?” Tony was actually pouting at that point.
Anthony: Sharon holds no hard feelings towards you for us getting together. Although she feels really stupid for hitting on a gay guy who probably used her great aunt as a beard. And yes, she really believes that you were using Aunt Peggy as a beard.
Thank you to everyone who read or reviewed the last chapter. You’re all beautiful. Also, I’m working on the next batch of chapters right now, so your reviews will be extra helpful.
“I think we finished that around 1 AM, but before he collapsed into the bed, Peter said that Hunter brought breakfast and left us some stuff in the fridge. If you behave, I’ll bring you a bacon cheese sandwich.”
Red spider You never explained why you separated again. Steve just got a text from his fiancée one day in September, letting him know that you were taking over the Malibu house for a while.
Note: Benjamin is another codename for Peter. I feel like everybody in the story has at least six names, not counting Steve that has about 60. Tony just can’t find the right replacement for Cuddle Bunny.
Me: Agent May has more, but she can’t technically be an Avenger because she’s not enhanced. Now she is a leader.
"Thank you again for not googling my past relationship stuff. Thank you so much because I probably wouldn’t be able to do this right now.” Tony said, reaching over to kiss Steve on the mouth. He’s gotten way too used to this over the last few days.” He loved Tony’s kisses. Sometimes they were gentle and sweet. Other times they were hard and wanting, but there was always a genuine sort of honesty to them.
Tony Potts: I don’t know. Stevie bear works as a counselor at a community center somewhere in Brooklyn. Although I doubt that he’s gotten help himself. He’s too busy trying to save everyone else to save himself.
The boss: You need to go in sober.
Tony: BTW, according to the special house guest, he wasn’t dead; he was just bounced back in time and created a new branch timeline. Therefore, time GPS is essential.
Me: I’ll have to suggest it.
Yes, another interlude. This is because when I started this story I decided that any conversation that did not take place between Tony and Steve would be labeled as an interlude. Of course, when I decided on that I never thought there would be a stretch of time where Tony and Steve could not speak to each other. Steve is not happy about this at all. He wants his Tony Bear Back. (My voice recognition software originally rendered that as “He wants his Tony bareback.” because apparently the software has a dirty mind. Or maybe FRIDAY has taken over my computer.)
Kitty brother: I assume I need to schedule a call with the American president sometime this week?
Tony: Maria tried, but I can’t argue too much on that.
That trailer was intense. I’m processing, but it gave me ideas.
D FitzSimmons: We’re hoping to do that again with these messages. This is why I'm using my phone. We think we are currently in a window, but monoliths are finicky little things and were using their particles for this.
Me: I get that.
"You weren’t ready for it yet. You and Stark needed to work on your problems yourselves." Melinda explained.
HSBF: So do I. You did well. Although I do think the story you made up about making out in the rain on top of the roof of the tower is a little bit much. You could’ve said something about feeding me pancakes in bed. We actually did that.
Tony Potts: So, I just found out Steve accidentally exposed himself to all the world because he tried to sext me while high on edibles.
Oh by the way, a few assholes on twitter and a couple of supposedly reputable websites are accusing me of making you go gay. I usually respond by mentioning your sex tape. Sorry about that but it’s the best way to deal with it. Why is it they assume that you’re bisexualness disappears when you’re dating someone of the opposite sex?
“Yes. The fact that they kept going after Ms. Marvel’s family despite being relocated three times, until I decided to put them on the Compound, made me realize that the other agencies that have the database would be vulnerable. That’s when Fitz and I came up with the Hellfire Protocol,” Tony explained.
Me: However, neither of those are answers we want people outside of us to know.
Thank you to everybody who read or reviewed the last conversation. You are all fabulous.
Me: Considering how many times I've almost died, you would think I would stop being an asshole.
To be continued.
Me: I already told you no telecommunication sex.
Group message to the Spider Venom Conspiracy group.
Melinda: Thank you.
HSBF: You’re enjoying this.
Melinda: You refer to Tony in your address book as Morgan’s father. Your relationship is not fine. Nothing about your relationship with Tony is fine and you don’t want to do anything to change that. I think he’s moved past Siberia. Have you?
This conversation takes place a few moments after the last one.
“Oh, thank God.” Tony’s mumble words broke Steve out of his thoughts.
“You’re mad at me?” Hunter asked Leo after sending his last message to Tony. He was not expecting Leo to lean over their bed and kiss him.
“Is that Tony unable to be confirmed because of Ultron?” Steve asked. She was sure that Steve already knows that her timeline branched off from the year after the incident.
Me: Good to know.
HSBF: Maybe.
Me: I never said the L word in relation to Cuddle Bunny.
Pepper pot: How did he not know that already? May knows.
Tony: I am too. Unfortunately, Spidey‘s aunt really is. Yeah, I really really wish we’d had this conversation before she found out accidentally.
“Appropriate.”
Jemma: The idiot just assumed that he was overriding the timeline and didn’t even bother to check. I checked.
(See the end of the chapter for
Me: Oh, no worries. I’m sure he’ll be spending quality time at a Congressional hearing about customer privacy by the end of the month.
Ana Junior: Hunter doesn’t hate you. He’s currently defending you.
Tony: No. Number three is that we’re stubborn assholes. We think we know who the other person is, but we really don’t. Therefore, we make bad decisions without talking things out, which leads to things like Germany, Siberia and killer robots. There’s a lot of fucking up all around.
The “me” in this conversation is Steve.
“Supplies?” Steve asked.
Me: I don’t think we’re going to discuss all these things before we have to do the interview at the pace were going.
Leo vaguely remembered seeing an image similar to this on Noah’s screen hours before the monoliths exploded and sent him 22 months back in time. Meaning that after today, he would know nothing about what is to come except from Robin’s drawings. Even with the help of the council of elders, the Princess, her new stepfather, and a team of psychologists, Robin was still having trouble processing what she sees.
Me: Very sorted. James Rhodes is in charge of Shield and therefore Ross has no right to enforce any provision of the Accords. Even the Raft is now under control of the DOJ like it should’ve been in the first place. Ross and his agency are now only in charge of negotiating amendments and additional provisions of the accords. Since that part is done by people who actually know what they’re doing and not Ross himself because he doesn’t like getting his hands dirty, I think we’re good.
Me: I’m not having text message sex with you until you can guarantee that the NSA is not reading these messages or anyone else for that matter.
StarkAE: Of course they are. How OK is Peter?
FRIDAY: I am technically the service provider to all of the electronic devices used by Coulson's team.
Me: Of course he’s not telling her the truth. Neither one of you is a bloody idiot. How do you tell your girlfriend that a version of yourself that’s already travelled to the future once managed to get thrown back in time when a bomb blew up three of the rocks that eat people?
If we’re back and done with this mission, I would like to have lunch with you. There’s some things I need to discuss that probably should be done in person. And maybe at your house instead of a restaurant. Does the Arlington house have a lab?
Tony: That’s a technicality. Marion Barry was arrested for smoking crack and still got re-elected.
HSBF: Tony!
Me: Tony stayed in that state for a long time until his father figure stabbed him in the back and then he realized he needed to change a lot of things. That’s when he started to right a lot of his own wrongs with a metal suit and then we met. I put my foot in my mouth and we kept doing it over and over again until we started to actually listen to one another. That took a while.
Nomad: That it’s good on Sundays. I can’t believe I’m going to finally be able to see you in less than two weeks.
“It’s your boyfriend.” Agent Piper said after looking through the peephole.
Iron Dad: Sorry, I worried you. I thought Ana would’ve interrupted and told you I am currently en route to the Playground because I have a 10 AM with the president.
Me: I’m sure it’s emotional support.
In happier news, I got tickets for an early showing of Spider Verse later today. I’m excited.
Agent Laura: What about Dr. Margarita Cruz?
Tony: The LMD was so anatomically correct. Like, I would not have known that she was an LMD until she started to speak and I recognized that I was talking to Aida.
See top-secret file for additional information.
Me: I still worry. I’m not exactly there to be your eyes in the sky.
Anthony: That was Steve Rogers. Stefan Carter wants to punch him for taking advantage of his stepdaughter when she was emotionally vulnerable.
HSBF: Good luck. I’ll work with Ana to figure out the best time to video call you.
“You are aware that we are still in the room?” Tony heard Agent Piper say from the background.
“I feel a but coming.”
Me: Hey Linda Bear, I’m going dark for a while. But first I thought you should know that Captain Oblivious just realized that he’s dating Shell Head, so I owe you like a month of foot massages whenever Stark’s band of lawyers figure out how to fix things.
"Did Steve ever tell you what happened in Siberia?"
“Yes. Although I would love to know why there’s a six-year-old in your lab?” Tony asked.
Tosha: Now, you speak. My thumbs were starting to get sore. You can’t dictate during the middle of a meeting.
Me: To avoid hundred degree heat. I am good. It is just me and the counselor now. I’m sure that you’re aware that Red
“But a lot less than we had in April and I promise we will keep working through them. As I learned sometime during the mid-90s, orgasms don’t make everything go away. But they were quite enjoyable,” Steve responded by placing a kiss on Tony’s bare shoulder.
The Boy in the Chair: That’s still so cool. Did you get to fight them again?
Anthony: I don’t know. I mean, I don’t want to fly down to an undisclosed location and strangle you know who. But I blame that more on therapy and antidepressants than anything else.
Tony: I’m not actually sure how long I’m going to be in DC. There’s meetings at the DOD and Congress already on the schedule with more to come. More Accords stuff that needs to be straightened out in case there is a regime change. But I should be done before Mumbai.
(See the end of the chapter for
I debated whether to call this a conversation or a mission report chapter because it contains both. However, since it begins with the conversation I will treat as such.
“What about school?” MJ asked because, of course, MJ asked.
Agent M: Just so you know your sister stopped by.
Anthony: The September Foundation creation is part of my negotiations not to end up in prison for the murder bot fiasco. That’s pure self-preservation right there.
Venom: Actually, she did tell me that she’s not a biologically based person. I just didn’t listen.
Ana 2018: Is Dr. Potts-Stark aware of the circumstances of my name sake‘s death? That was the catalyst that led to Dr. Stark-Rogers reconciling with his past regarding his father.
The New Consultant: The asshole thing is a mask he wears.
Me: She should thank Monkey Lover, it was his idea. Also ask Monkey Lover if he wants to come with us to Malta and make sure Agent America is still coming. I guess we have to ask the Princess, if any of the team Shield members can come with us.
Me: It’s not the same thing.
Me: I can take care of myself.
“We didn’t actually fall asleep until 3 AM and some of us need a little more sleep,” Tony complained as he kiss Steve again.
Tony: She’s also scared because her kid has superpowers. Not only that but her kid has superpowers in the current political climate. The watch dogs are everywhere. They’re getting more members every day. She’s scared.
Anthony: I shouldn’t even be surprised. How exactly did she get in contact with you?
“And they’ve been relocated again to the upstate facility.”
“It’s not the same framework. For example, in this new framework if you die in there, you won’t die in the real world.”
Tony: OK, things were going pretty good in Steve Roger’s life until this asshole in Germany started using people who are different as scapegoats in an effort to consolidate power and thus we get concentration camps.
Tony: A lot of mistakes were made. I’m sorry I accused you of fucking someone else when I found out you were pregnant. I said a lot of things to you that day that I shouldn’t have.
Blue phone: Considering all the good things that Clint says about her, yes.
“That’s ridiculous,” he denied a little too quickly. “If I was in love with her, why would I push her to be with Tony?”
Red phone: Do you have experience?
Me: I don’t even want to know. How did you discover that he made a life model decoy of his ex-girlfriend?
Hunter: Did you know that other me is sleeping with other Simmons? Apparently, they have an arrangement.
Me: You can’t change the past, only the future. Usually.
Me: Anthony Carbonell, better known to world as Tony Stark is the only child of Maria and Howard Stark and the child of their heart of Edwin and Anna Jarvis. Tony really had four parents which was good because two of them were not as best as they could’ve been.
Tony: I’m not going to argue with that.
Avenger Ana: The boy in the chair has yet to make any posts on social media. However, he has notified me of several posts regarding operations in Norway to recover the hammer. I am taking care of it.
Director Snookums: Keyword is some. Actually Friday told me three days ago, but I was hoping you would tell me first. Actually she sent out a mass message to all of your friends, even those that I'm technically supposed to arrest for violating the Accords.
Anthony love: You’re not getting a blow job for a month.
Red phone: No one wants to spend quality time with their Ex.
Cuddle Bunny: Tony, just let me know that you’re safe. Or Friday, can you please tell me that he’s okay.
Genius Princess 2018: Agree. Also, to help with this, I have introduced code that will add years after our usernames.
Welcome back to the “Tony and Steve have their shit together” timeline.
TMNS: Is this why you didn’t publicly date men for so long?
Me: You never really leave, do you?
The New Consultant: Thompson did. He was the friend I consulted with.
Me: I’m not surprised.
Pepper pot: That part, I understand. Although how does that affect things here? You said time travel is closer to Star Trek than Back to the Future???
Tony Potts: Uncle Daniel didn't actually die of a heart attack?
“The same.”
CoulsonPJ: Not that much. I’m glad things were less volatile.
Anthony: I’m totally okay with going through with this. Stefan being there might be a good thing. Although I’m hoping that you will look so good along with the fact you have a Y chromosome will keep the press so distracted that they won’t realize you look like a bearded Captain America in a suit, without Kevlar.
“He was at Shield long enough to have a pension?” Steve asked surprised.
Tony: 10 lawsuits for discrimination based on genetic factors because treating somebody because they’re inhuman is still illegal or at least that’s what the lawyers are arguing. Ross, or rather his State Department, is facing 12 lawsuits for hostile work environment as well as five for sexual-harassment, against him personally. Oh, at least two for reprisal.
Tony responded by kissing Steve, “You’re learning, sweetie. I’m so proud.”
“I’m sure you have plenty of that already planned this weekend.” Natasha smirked at him.
Nomad: I feel like the inner politics there must be awful right now.
Me: I don’t think I ever threatened to kill her. BTW she is here three tables over keeping an eye on things.
Chief mechanic: Well, beyond the sex tape that I know he is still profiting from.
“If it wasn't for the sake of socialization, Peter would be in college next year, and Flash would just finish up via a GED and work with Pepper. But the boys wouldn’t like that. MJ is Ms. Jones’s problem. What did you tell him about Laurel?”
TMNS: Are you mad about Afia not telling you?
Tony: Maybe when Lily‘s favorite aunt is done babysitting Skye Quake, I can send her your way.
Me: Agent has a different theory. He believes Mrs. Windom-West wasn't happy that I was bringing someone else on to oversee the SI charity foundations and not just because that person was my new BF. No one knew that was going to be a name only thing, so Agent thinks that was what scared her into taking drastic/homicidal action.
