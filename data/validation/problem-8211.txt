"What? It's a 100 acres with a lap pool. It's got a screening room. There's worse ways to protect people."
"I ain't a kid, Buck."
"Hiya, Mr Stark," Ned said as he walked into the penthouse's lounge. "Woah this place is so cool."
That was Nat. She sounded slightly shaken, maybe even shocked, but other than that she seemed okay. "You alright?" Steve asked, his fingers crossed for good news.
Tony chuckled, "Good."
"Well, it doesn't really matter what time. The kid dropped out of Midtown."
The Xbox... The Gameboy. The television. The headset. Ned! Okay, so now things that he could feel. He could feel his clothes, the headset in his hands and the floor beneath his socks. He could hear Ned's breathing, the sound of the headset powering down... and, was that the Imperial March?
Steve pulled a face. "What are you doing, tin man?"
His ears were still ringing, when the Soldier hauled him out of the chair - minutes after the machine had been switched off. He had stood back and stared at Peter, as if admiring his handiwork, before removing the mouthpiece and dragging the boy to his feet.
The teen stopped. He didn't really have an answer. Maybe it was because Pepper was a woman. That kind of made sense- it wasn't like he had ever seen either of his parents in a heterosexual relationship before. He hadn't really seen his Dad flirt with anyone other than Pops... or, more likely, he had just never noticed him flirt with others.
"Alright, g'night, Dad."
"See ya..."
"Sure..." Peter replied, looking down at the table, fiddling his fingers as a distraction.
Peter ran out of the lab. Wait, no it wasn't a run, it was a skip. Peter skipped out of the lab, the suit in his arms - and ran to the training rooms. He went in the changing in rooms in there and put on his new suit.
"What did you just say, Romanoff?" Tony asked, in a tone of mock offence.
"I mean you did just reveal you were a spy..."
As a pair, Iron Man and Captain America were the epitome of stealth and organisation. They infiltrated the base with next to no trouble, and were soon creeping through the halls and listening out for any noise. The noise came in the form of Steve dropping his shield on the metal floor.
After the chain from Peter's wrists to the desk was fastened, Blondie left the room - leaving Peter alone with another man... "Oh no," he whispered under his breath, realising who that man was.
"Who told you about that? Was it Stark? Hill? Tell me, Buck... I need to know which direction to shoot in on the next mission," Steve insisted, pleading with his eyes.
Shaking his head, Bucky smirked. "Have you gone deatf, Rogers, call him!" Steve did just that, pressing his son's number and waiting ten seconds for an answer.
* * *
Clint slowly backed out of the room, not wanting to intrude on what could be one of their final hugs. He understood what Tony was going through: he knew what it felt like to have kids.
"He wanted to make a difference, I suppose. I mean, we won't know because we dropped a building on him while we were kicking ass." Steve felt a tear roll down his face, which he swiftly destroyed evidence of by rubbing it away as quickly as it came. Tony tried to regain his composure, so he did what helped him best- par from alcohol, and drunk a large gulp of his coffee.
Steve eyebrows lowed, his eyes narrowing at the sight of who it is. Of course, the man wanted revenge on his friend, who did not and Steve will always repeat do not kill his father. However, he was slightly confused. And, after a second, he found himself staring at the young man with a look of confusion painted across his face.
"Kid, you know you can't come with me."
Steve sighed. He took another step towards his boyfriend, or at least towards the man, who resembled him. The thoughts were all gone. All those happy memories were yet to resurface from the depths of Bucky's mind. "You pulled me from the river... why?"
But that was years ago, and Loki was now dead. Thanos would never affect him again.
"Shit."
Up ahead, Bucky reached a fork in the road and faced oncoming traffic. He blinked, his mind going over every possible scenario before he leaped over the barrier, just as Steve drove through it.
Peter awoke to what he could vaguely identify as the sound of a light switch being flicked. His head was throbbing as if he was resting his head against a speaker. His restless sleep had only provided a brief solace to soothe his injuries, though he seemed to be making up for those hours without pain in those first few moments after waking up: the pain seared for several agonising moments before settling. He resisted the urge to curl up into a ball and sleep until the horrific ordeal was open, but he knew that he had probably been woken up for a reason.
* * *
"I'm Bucky," the brunet replied, holding out his hand, "I have a feeling you might have heard of me?"
"Nothing," she said, through a plastic smile. An extremely obvious plastic smile.
The teen took his hat off, only for it to be grabbed by Peter, who quickly placed it on his head. Peter grinned; he was finally going to be able to introduce his Dad to his best friend. Tony shook his head in bemusement. His son really was a goofball.
Peter eyed his Dad, looking for a reassuring nod of his head, or any type of noticeable approval. Tony smiled back at him, a comforting smile - signalling the fourteen year old to continue.
The elevator doors opened and Tony guided the two soldiers into the lounge. "Take a seat," he offered, indicating to the black sofa, "I'll just go get Pete."
Tony smirked. "No Iron Man jammies today?"
"Crying doesn't make you weak..."
The teenager shrugged whilst rubbing his eyes. Eleven wasn't late for him anymore, especially with the occasional late night/early morning crime-fighting with his Dad. "You said you'd tell me if anything important happened," he slurred, blinking rapidly then waited for a second. "Did... did anything happen?"
Tony huffed, "If if bit you... You don't think you'd get the attributes of a spider, do you?"
There were none.
"Oh..."
"She probably just said that to scare us," Flash whispered to Ned, after noticing his trembling form.
They were trying to do something to him... but Peter wasn't quite sure what.
Thanks for clickingkey-boards for helping with this chapter.
Tony put his arm around his son, "You okay?"
"And by you, I'm guessing you mean Bucky too?"
"Yeah, buddy?" Steve responded, in a manner that would have fooled anyone into thinking it had only been an hour since the two had last spoken.
"Yeah..."
"Right... Just let me go say goodbye. To Dad. To the person that I was happily living with."
At this exact moment, 5:47pm June 3rd 2016, Tony was sat on the chair beside Peter's bed: a book in his hands. He was there purely because there was nowhere else he could be: Dum-E was trying to clear up his lab, emphasise on the trying, and the rest of the team were being secretive - mainly his ex, and his boyfriend.
"Sometimes I wonder how you're mature enough to be Spider-Boy, Pete."
Peter tried to ignore the comment, and hurried over to where the rest of the class were stood. Katie was showing them a contained, glass cage - that was filled with hundreds of blue and red spiders.
“Steve, we looked for the guy for almost two years and it took all of our resources to find him.” Sam rubbed his head and added in a whisper, “Man, I still have so much sleep to catch up on.”
"You're gonna patrol without me?" Tony questioned, his voice covered in concern.
"Why not?" Tony asked through gritted teeth. This Hydra guy really was infuriating.
"No I don't."
"You're going to pay for this, y'know. He's an innocent kid, why'd you even think about laying a finger on him?"
Natasha was struggling to lie. Steve could hear how untrue it was just by the way she was saying it. He needed another way to get to his boyfriend.
"You're bad at answering questions... Peter."
Tony blanked him and continued to run tests on a red liquid, which appeared to be blood. Whose blood: Steve didn't know, but it seemed to be important to Tony. What if it was Tony's blood? What if he was seriously ill? "Tones," Steve repeated, "What are you doing?"
"Oh God, Tony! Every time. Every time I think you see things the right way..." He craned his neck, looking up at the ceiling in disbelief, before forcing his eyes to make contact with the genius'.
Tony's heart sank. It hadn’t even taken two minutes.
“We were all worried about you. And we couldn’t let you die. I couldn’t let you die.” Steve’s voice was low and quiet and pulling at him like a puppet being pulled by strings. He desperately wanted to believe it but at the same time-
Being with Steve...there was nothing he wanted more.
Some time passed before Tony registered the man lying them both down and pulling Tony close. Too soon, hands tugged his hair gently.
“Bed rest for at least two weeks. Or one week if he can’t manage that. But no work for three weeks at the very least. He needs a break.”
A wild fire possessed him. The beating drum of Zeke’s pulse called to him like a Siren. He couldn’t stop it no matter how much he longed to.
“Oh.” Tony glanced at the stack of sheets and frowned. “But you enjoy it right?”
Steve! And trust me, you don’t want to know.” And then Iron man shook his head like he was sure. “You won’t be happy if you know. I’m not what you think I am.”
Not just now. But for a long time, maybe even eternity. He’d always remember the complete joy he felt hearing that.
And despite everything, Tony had to laugh.
“This is not a fail safe. It’s a bomb. Have you seriously learned nothing from these past few months?”
It had turned out he’d been right. Over the years that followed, Tony had begun to learn that while you could have many soul marks, that did not necessarily mean you had many soulmates.
“And...with me?”
"Yeah, sorry." Tony slammed his fist down on one of the robots that was trying to rip an agent's arm off. "I decided to break in. Hope that's not a problem."
All Tony could do was stare. Had Steve not heard him? “Did you not hear me? I’m a liability! And it’s not just the government, I don’t do well with people! In general!”
Steve swallowed and shook his head.
Tony’s breath caught. The smile slid off his face.
No, he was here to work. And Steve just happened to be the one in the driving seat.
“Dance.” Steve pulled back to allow one of the waiters to place a plate in front of them. “You and me.”
Tony was staring at the floor with a hazy gaze. Somewhere in the distance the party carried on. He wasn’t a part of it.
It was never something he’d pictured. And yet, here he was.
He’d not been the best. But maybe not the worst either.
It was hard not to scoff, but somehow Tony managed to keep the tight smile on his face. “Yeah, have you seen me and Ben? We get on like the Hulk with an ATM.”
Had he been excited, even a little? Or had he wrapped his wrists in thick bands to hide Steve’s marks on his skin because he was ashamed?
“Well I do.” Rogers puffs out his chest and folds his arms. “I’m not letting you near him on your own.”
“I get that. You like to play it safe.” Tony decided, leaning back on his hands in thought.
The relief in the air was so strong, it seeped into Steve’s pores. Tony wasn’t flinching away from him anymore, he felt calmer and dare he think it, happier.
“I just don’t get why we’re doing this anymore!” Steve groans and slaps down the mug full of decaf coffee a lot harder than necessary. “He’s not even here half the time!”
“Yeah, it is.” Steve smiled and then stopped and looked at him for a second before leaning closer. “Do you wanna see my mark?”
Something was really itching at Tony now. There was something he was missing, a vital piece of information. A puzzle he hadn't solved.
That was true. Like the size of a toaster.
Tony isn’t gonna make this easy. They both seem pretty determined.
“They’re not savages Zeke. They’re tyrants. And the sooner they’re dead, the better.”
The air left him. He dropped the material and stared at his body in awe.
“And you Anthony. And you.”
Steve didn’t say anything for a moment. Then-
“You-you didn’t?” Tony whispered, not daring to move. The only sound between them was their breaths.
Steve tilted his head and leaned over to get his own cup of coffee. “I’ve booked your appointment for you with my tailor. They’ll get you sorted for the event.” He said before taking a sip like he hadn’t just dropped a bombshell.
When they reached the mansion, Iron man was quick to take his leave, so reluctantly Steve made his way to his bedroom to have a quick shower and get changed, before heading to the kitchen area.
“I didn’t come here to make small talk Captain. God knows Sue hates it when I try.” Reed says, almost sadly. “I simply came here to request if you could have me on the Dyson sphere project. I will speed things up tremendously and I feel he-I could do more.”
That night, he flies back to the Helicarrier, the world feels quiet. There’s an unease stirring in the corridors as he smiles manically at the Shield agents for the first time. He knows they’re probably spooked by the image he portrays. His cheeks are damp and his eyes feel sore and in his shaking hand, the cracked frame is still there, plain as day for everyone to see. He looks like a mess.
Steve caught his hand and held it still.
“Surely you can’t truly think that.” Steve said and tilted his head a little, narrowing his eyes. “Otherwise I’d be in a jail cell right now and you’d be gloating on live camera.”
“Evac is on its way Tony. You’ll be okay.” Nat said calmly in his ear and Tony wanted to shake his head and explain desperately that he wasn’t the concern here-
Quietly, he swung his briefcase onto the lower bunk bed and clicked the locks open. As he began to pull his things out, he wondered if everyone thought the same.
” Iron man yelled and even the team around them froze. “You can’t say things like that-“
The room sours with tension. Alpha rage pheromones twist the air and coil unpleasantly. Instinctively, Tony presses his cheek against Roger’s abdomen harder.
For the first time in a long time, Tony didn't really have an answer. Had he thought he'd see Steve more? Had he done it because he'd held out hope? Or was it all just because he'd felt so detached that he'd thought he'd find a new way forward by working under Steve?
“I have an idea.” Ty says brightly and gesture between himself and Captain America who’s eyeing him like he's mud under his shoe. “Why don’t we take turns? I sleep with you on one night, he sleeps with you the next? We can do it that way. I don’t mind.”
“I’m so confused.” Tony breathed, and instantly Steve let go and placed his hands on his shoulders. He took Tony’s chin gently and tilted his head up, inspecting the sore bite.
Tony gasped feeling a searing,
“The memories are just an excuse Tony!” Steve said incredulously and seemed disbelieving. His eyes were wide and he was almost shaking his head in wonder. “You say that for everything! You haven’t even apologized for the SHRA!”
“You’re not-“ Steve tries desperately but Tony just smiles. Or at least he thinks he’s smiling. It's been a while.
"I'm so sorry. God, please, I'm
But Steve silenced him with a harsh look. Then slowly he opened his hands out a little and showed Tony what was inside.
Something bad. Something
And they way he made Tony feel. Tony had never felt important before. It was nice. Steve was really kind and Tony...
Instantly Tony felt on the back foot. Steve’s expression was fierce and he seemed tense like he was seconds away from grabbing him or something and Tony really didn’t know what to make of it. For a second he even wondered if Steve knew what he was thinking,
Steve’s eyes flashed again and his grip on Tony tightened. “I always am. Sir.”
“I’m sorry I yelled at you. I know it doesn’t help you feel more comfortable around me but I just-“ Steve rubbed his neck and blew out a frustrated breath. For once he looked pretty helpless. “I want you to be...to feel...safe around me.”
sorry-"
“You were
“We tried that already. Didn’t work.”
It was a damn good thing Steve wasn’t other alphas.
The second he looked up, he saw Robinson looking at him with a pleased expression. “I see you’re impressed. You should be.”
“I do. You know I do, you’re Captain America.”
It’s so frustrating. It’s like he’s the only one that hasn’t understood. The Illuminati were wrong. These
"Oh my
It hurt that Steve knew exactly what he was thinking. He hated that more than he could say.
He winced a little when he felt the skin of his neck pull around Steve’s bite.
He wouldn’t survive for much longer, he knew. He had lost what little weight he had since he’d woken up, and found his body gasping for breath more with each day. He couldn’t really explore much outside of his bunker anymore and he’d started to notice a strange rash on his left hand and a mild cough in his lungs.
"Who said we're giving up?"
"Right."
"How are you, актив/asset?" asked the man, who he had just realised was sat on the chair opposite the bed. The man wore a dark suit, with a red emblem sewn into the sleeve. His hair was gelled to the right at the parting and glistened under the LED lighting.
"They did this to you. They're the reason you can't remember." The man looked like he was trying to regain his composure as he added: "Are you sure you can't remember anything?"
"He isn't crazy," Steve repeatedly. "He may have... the Winter Soldier, but he's not crazy."
"Hey! Let me use the words I want: after all it is a free county."
Fury shook his head. "I can, and, I will. Hydra's still out there and I need to do something about it."
"What do you think, Petey?" Tony said, jokingly, "Would I ever not finish a project for you?"
"It always ends in a fight."
Steve followed, falling to the ground in a roll. The chopper shot at the ground, tearing up the sidewalk. It was as if concrete was being shot at the three as they sprinted along after each other. Bucky jumped, landing in an underpass. Instead of waiting, he decided to run through the traffic.
"Sit down," the Soldier ordered Peter, his voice stern in a tone that made Peter freeze in fear. "I said: sit down!" the Soldier repeated, shoving the boy through the darkness, causing Peter's knees to buckle at the impact between his legs and the metal seat.
Ned looked at him surprise, "How can you call going to Oscorp okay? It'll be epic!"
"Yep."
He then grabbed Peter's hand, slowly walking towards the elevators. "See you later, Miss Potts."
"I... I just don't feel up to it. I'd rather focus on anything but Midtown right now." Peter pulled out of his Dad's grasp, "Especially with everything else I'm going through..."
Peter glanced up at Bucky, his eyes wide in terror. Yet, they closed as soon as Zemo shot something into his skin -  a needle, perhaps - and he fell limp to the floor.
Rhodey looked just as unsure.
A motorbike sped towards Bucky, who was quick to realise and grabbed the handle, spinning the bike around. The rider was thrown off. Bucky's eyes widened. He hopped onto the bike and rode away, sending cars careering left and right.
The Captain nodded, "The final point I'd like to make is that Tony has been keeping stuff from me, stuff about Peter's well-being. I'm not sure what but I know he's hiding it. Even if it was just a bug, I'm pretty sure Tony should be informing me."
Surprisingly, Peter then said, "I'll come to lunch, but I want to sit next to you."
"Well, Buck, I don't think I can spend the rest of my life without you. I wanna stay with you till I'm at least a hundred years old..."
Steve cut in, "It's because he's already made up his mind."
"No, Steve, you cannot."
"Pops," Peter said as Steve stood up and headed towards the door, "Y'know I never actually said I wanted to be an Avenger like you and Dad."
Opening the door in a heat of the moment hurry, Tony and Steve ran into the room. They were faster than any other lifeform on Earth - even faster than Quicksilver, Wanda's brother... the one who had died saving Barton, and that kid. The bags under both of their eyes were showing, however at this moment they felt more awake than they had in awhile.
"The Xbox."
Peter once more obliged, stretching his hands out in front of him, and letting his gaze fall to the floor. The metal cuffs that were placed around his wrists gnawed into his skin. They dug into his skin and almost drew blood. After taking a deep breath, he asked bravely, "Where are you taking me?"
The next day was Friday, and that was the day Steve Rogers and Tony Stark had set up a meeting with a law attorney. The meeting was at 10:30, so Tony of course showed up at 10:45.
“I... don’t... want... to... talk... ‘bout... it,” the soldier said through gritted teeth, trying his best not to lose his temper. He knew what happened when the other him got out: people usually ended up dead.
"I won't... But you gotta promise me one thing, kiddo, you gotta stay safe. You hear me?"
Christmas. That had been so long ago for Tony, yet for Peter it had never came. It had been the worse holiday in the history of winters for the philanthropist. Not the first without family, just the first where he was missing the people he loved. "Right..." the man said quickly, trying to move on from the current topic: it was just a little too awkward to discuss right now, "What about what you want for lunch?"
He awoke to the white walls of the a room. Yet, he couldn't remember if he had been here before - or where he had been previously. He didn't even know what he looked like. And, he couldn't remember his own name.
"Well," said Tony, "It's about the spider bite. I did the tests, and all, and found out somethings happened to your DNA."
There was no sight of Bucky. He had vanished along with the remainder of Hydra agents. Steve and Tony had focused on the most important thing in their lives: Peter, and left the base unharmed.
"Okay."
"Pete, kiddo, this isn't the time for you to have a tantrum. In fact, I don't think I've ever seen you pull a tantrum before..."
"Sure, but why?"
"Your's weren't bad or anything... these are just better," he replied, picking up another handful of fries.
"Breach! Breach! Breach!" Sam yelled from over the comms. A grenade crashed through the window, settling beside Bucky. The glass was thrown everywhere, painting the floor in shattered, transparent fragments. The assassin kicked it towards his former friend and watched as the Captain smothered it with his shield.
"Yes I did."
A very pointed, "Shhh!" came from his left and his Pops breathed out, "Oh! Is Peter still asleep?"
Tony rushed over in his suit but not to help Steve up. Instead, he went down on one knee and listened attentively.
"Maybe," Clint grinned, "Just maybe, they're trying to tell you something."
Tony stared into space for a second, before replying with, "Shit. Pep, can you clear my schedule for the rest of the day... Pete, come on." The genius stood up, indicating for his son to follow. "See you later, Ross."
Bucky let out a hearty chuckle, "So a scrawny kid from New York, who thinks he can save - and help - everybody."
"Sonofa... your Pops has called a court meeting. About the custody of you, kiddo."
Peter turned, heading towards reception. "Wait, Peter, one more thing... feel better soon."
"Three seconds!"
"I don't quite believe you, kid," Tony scoffed, "You see, you do this thing with your hands whenever you lie."
Irondad
"Steve..." Bucky mumbled, placing his pint of beer back down on the table. He stared at the  foaming liquid before continuing to speak. "I killed Howard."
"That's not for- Oh... I don't know.... haven't really thought about it," Peter mumbled, realising that his birthday was a whole lot closer than it felt. This whole 'I've been asleep for half a year' thing was strange and unnerving to him. He couldn't imagine how waking up in the future - like his Pops, would have felt. "I guess whatever I said I wanted for Christmas..."
What if Peter only loved him when Steve was there? What if he only pretended to love him, what if it was all an act?
"Peter..."
Peter and Tony were sat in one of his labs, a large, pizza box open in front of them. "So, what's your great idea, Dad?" Peter asked, in between a bite of the cheese-covered food.
"You're welcome, Peter," Vision replied, before heading through another wall... one which led to Wanda's room. The teen wondered why he was going in there.
"Now, my актив/asset you will do as I tell you to. Otherwise there may be some... painful consequences."
The man kept his hand there, his eyes glimmering as the boy tried to shake his head away. Zemo's nails were digging into his skin, scratching him whenever he tried to move. "I will never do as you say," Peter hissed, finally gaining enough strength to pull his head back.
The teen watched in horror as the man's metal hand landed upon a control panel. He tried to scream no, to tell Bu- the Soldier to stop but he couldn't. No sound came out. He was well and truly done for.
"Buck," interjected Steve, "I had a family. Me and Tony... well we haven't exactly been getting on lately. My son, on the other hand, well I don't know what Tony has been telling him."
Shaking his head, Tony replied, "Nah, I thought I would be a good surprise."
"Yeah?" replied Peter.
"Yes, sir," Bucky repeated. Dragging Peter out of the door and down through a corridor.
Peter lifted his head to see who had asked him... it was MJ. The rest of their class had gone through the door into the next room, leaving him and her alone with the interns and scientists there. "Yeah, I'm coming."
Peter nodded, "Okay."
The boy's curly, brown hair was laced in dust and bits of dry paint: cuts and bruises were slowly forming across his face. His eyes were closed, making him appear to be sleeping - the only sign he wasn't dead being the faint movement of his chest. His white shirt was stained in blood, his own blood, and it was turning a shade of reddy-brown. Every few seconds, the teen would whimper in his unconscious state, before falling back to the darkness.
"It's the Imperial Star Destroyer... The Ultimate Collector's Series 10030 one! It's like the second biggest Star Wars Lego set you can get! It's crazy! It has three thousand pieces!" The boy sounded so excited. Only things like Lego could do this to him. And science.
Right?
"Peter's with you?"
Peter nodded his head, "Yeah," he paused - catching his breath, "Throw something at me, anything, but wait until I'm facing the other way."
Steve stopped him, interjecting, "Shut up, Tony. We need to find Peter - if he's here, before they move him."
Peter nodded, "That sounds great, Vis."
Peter greeted Tony at the bottom of the Tower, wearing only his pyjamas - despite the time. "Hiya, Dad. How'd it go?"
The teen's eyes lit up in excitement, "Really? You'd let me do that? You'd teach me?"
"D-dad?"
The boy, now unsure of what to think, hesitated before getting up. His knees almost buckling under the sudden movement. "Who was he?"
Peter looked at the book in horror. "It's... it's gotta have at least five hundred pages... I can't memorise that. I'm not going to." The red hydra symbol which was etched onto the cover seemed to glow as he spoke.
Steve stood up, walking over to the stand. He quickly threw a glance towards Bucky - who gave him a reassuring smile back. "I believe...," he raised his voice slightly, before continuing, "I believe that my son, Peter Benjamin Parker Stark-Rogers, should no longer remain in Anthony Edward Stark's custody."
Zemo decided to get Karpov's attention by driving his car slightly too close to the rear end of the handler's. The two bits of metal connecting made a loud noise echo down the street, definitely catching the handler's heed. And, just as promised, the Soviet opened the door, wondering what the explosive sound had been.
"No... No, you don't."
Tony put his arm around the teen, when they walked into the lab. He could see the anxiety building up beneath the boy's skin, showing through the creases in his pale skin. Peter had been trying to suppress the worst of it: the way he could feel this weird tingling sensation throughout his body, the way he could hear the conversations of people far away, the way he could barely focus on one point of view. And that had made it worse.
"Nope," Peter stated, "Auntie Tasha said I should wear a Hulk onesie seeing as it's Doctor Banner's birthday today. She said we need a bit of Hulk and Bruce around the Tower to remind everyone about him."
"Kid," Tony added, "I'm gonna take a sample of your blood. Afterwards, go to bed, get some rest. We'll see how you are tomorrow.
"A playboy-" Steve continued, trying his best to ignore his ex husband.
"He still has that toy, you know. He left it with me, though," Tony replied, with some bitterness in his voice.
Bucky grabbed a mattress, lifting it with such ease that it appeared to way nothing. He pushed it to his side, blocking an attack from the window. Then he pushed a table towards the door, delaying their pursuers by a fraction as they began to swing into the building on cables.
"Come along," T'Challa said, his tone indicating that it was an order and not just a request. Despite his youthful looks, the soon to be king seemed to have years trapped behind his eyes- grief burrowing its way to the surface.
By the time he had finished upgrading every single thing he could on the spandex clothing, the sun had risen - and Peter had woken up.
"You're brave to make comments like that, boy... very brave indeed."
The billionaire continued to rub his head against his hands, hiding away from the growing conflict within the team. Natasha picked up on it, "Tony?" The man looked up see the assassin smiling at him. "You were being uncharacteristically non-hyperverbal.
"Pops!" Peter exclaimed, noticing his other father sat on one of the Tower's many sofas, "Dad never told me you were gonna be here!"
"They didn't," the boy insisted, closing his eyes in pain. Why didn't this Parker boy understand that Hydra had been good to him? He still didn't understand how he'd even entered the room. Yet he was here.
Clint picked up the teen, hauling him out of his seat. "Why you little bribón..." he hissed, before throwing the kid to the floor - tickling him.
"Ah, right," Steve said, trying to picture the event the two men had attended. That day was something he wouldn't forget - but not because of the Expo - all of that had happened on the same day he had become Captain America... or at least he had had the serum.
It still hurt, though. Even Spider-Man wasn't strong enough to dismiss pain. Yet, Peter knew this wouldn't break him - at least, it wouldn't break him for now.
“You’re saying someone framed him... aren’t you?”
That made Clint freeze in his tracks, clearly in pain from the sudden flood of old memories. He had tried to forget them, to lose them, within the heaps of good ones he had made. But Tony had to go and remind him. Tears filled his narrow eyes, leaving them glassy, and he headed back into the training room.
"Sam."
"No. No, I haven't. They were... they were d-dead, that's different," he shouted, breaking down by the end of the sentence. He fell to the floor, head in his hands.
Peter stood up, still angered by his father but less than before, and began to walk willingly towards the doors. "Fine, I'll do this. But... only because their apartment is more central to the city, I'll be able to patrol a bit easier."
"You're a natural, kid!"
Tony tiptoed into the room, leaving the door wide enough for a small ray of light to appear on the bed. Luckily, it wasn't in Peter's eyes as the young boy was sure to wake up at the first sign of a glimmer or a glow. The brunet let out a deep breath, which he didn't even know he was holding, as Peter rolled over onto his side. The teen had been asleep ever since they let him out of the medical ward. Despite his many months asleep, he was still extremely worn out.
"I know, I've got instructions inside my mask. I did make it."
"He had these powers before he came here. Did he not tell you this?"
"He wouldn't," Peter mumbled, getting up anyway, "He needs someone to teach me Spanish."
"It'll be okay, Steve," he said, finally, standing up and putting his arm around his friend. "I'm with you till the end of the line, pal."
Bucky kissed him back.
Sighing, Steve glanced back up at the Director. "Fine, Sir, but do you really think it's a good idea to bring Buck with me, when fighting Hydra. Isn't that essentially just handing them back their... weapon?"
"Bye, Dad."
The brunet walked over to his desk and picked up a stapler. He tossed it towards Peter's right side, staring in amazement as his son caught it without even looking at the flying stationary.
The genius snorted. "You still don't look like you're protesting against this... You actually like me, don't you, Pep?" He smiled. "Please tell me there's nothing actually concerning Pete because I don't think I can just walk away from that."
Peter took a deep breath, before replying. "It's a Hydra... isn't it. It's from Greek mythology... it's a serpent-like monster, with many heads. If you cut off one of its heads-"
"I don't know, Tony, why would you?"
Glancing at the boy in confusion, the man uttered, "Who was who? There was nobody else in here."
Peter had been in a coma since late last year? And had made no sign of waking up. The doctors had all said that there was still a chance, a small slither of hope, he would wake up - he able to leave the constantly silent room. But by now, all of Tony's and Steve's faith had disappeared; their frequent checks in on Peter becoming further and further apart.
Peter's eyes widened, "Those aren't what I designed last night... this morning, are they?"
"D-done," said Peter quietly as he pushed the pieces of signed paper towards Ross. The older man had a malicious glint in his eye, his face painted in the thoughts of his scheming mind.
"Okay, Dad, I'll be a friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man whilst you're gone," he joked.
"Before he parked it behind a desk," Tony picked up the kettle and slammed it against the table. "See the world... Maybe be of service." Sam stood there, his body tensing as he forced himself not to shiver. "Charlie didn't want to go to Vegas or Fort Lauderdale, which I what I would do. He didn't go to Paris or Amsterdam, which sounds fun. He decided to spend his summer building sustainable housing for the poor. Guess where. Sokovia."
Peter shook his head, determined that he could remain in control of his actions. He couldn't become like Bucky, just another mindless soldier that did exactly as ordered too. The outside world already seemed a distance memory - like when you envision school during the summer break...
"It's fine, kiddo, we can pick them up later," Tony reassured his son, picking up the Iron Man build-a-bear and laughing. "You actually kept this thing?"
The five headed down a walkway, the usually breathtaking view ruined by the atmosphere of what had happened. The crystal barrier between them and the outside world let in so much light that it would have been impossible to make the ten minute walk feel dark... yet it still felt like rain was crashing down as Steve set foot across it.
"Well I best be off," Tony announced - whilst ruffling Peter's hair, "Have fun with your Uncle Clint."
"Bye, bud."
Oh, Stark hated that laugh. He hated that man. However, sometimes the genius had to set an example of himself. A good example... He couldn't avoid the UN forever, he might as well listen now whilst he still had a chance of keeping the suits.
Tony raised an eyebrow at his son's nickname for Zemo. "Mister Criminal? You've got heart, kiddo. You really see the best in people. Even when they are insane psychopaths."
Steve forced himself to walk down the aisle, the wooden coffin light compared to the heavy pit in his stomach. It felt like a trek up a mountain just to get to the front of the hall. There were tears in the soldier's eyes, his hands shaking under the weight of death and guilt. If only he had been with her this entire time, maybe then she would have lived longer, maybe then she would have been okay.
But that wouldn't lead to anything...
Peter sat down on one of the hospital-like beds, shuffling up enough for Tony to sit beside him. Once he was seated next to his Dad, he said: "I can hear everything. I can hear the conversations of people in different rooms... in different buildings for that matter."
"Anthony?" Tony muttered, his comment unnoticed by the other members of the room. Steve had never called him that, at least not in public.
"That's smart. Good strategy."
* * *
Apart from Loki and the Chitauri invading...
"You might as well stay here an' send Barnes home, Cap. We're discussing tactics in a bit, and I know you wouldn't like to miss out on that."
Tony hugged his son, he didn't deserve a kid that was so kind.
"Jus' got an incoming call. I'll be back in a sec, bud," Tony muttered, walking out of the lounge. "Hi, Steve," he said, calmly.
"It's just- it's just he's not capable of looking after a kid on his own. Sure, he's a great dad - the complete opposite to what his own father was to him... but he's too allowing! He lets Peter do whatever he wants. I bet the kid's been staying up all night - living off chocolate milk, since I've not been there. I remember, once, when Tony bought Peter a freakin' car because the kid asked for one. He was twelve... twelve!" rambled Steve, his face going red as he struggled to catch his breath.
Clambering out of the bed as eagerly as he would on Christmas day, Peter scampered across the room and crouched down beside the tray. Cautiously, as if fearing that it was a trick and would explode the second he touched it, Peter picked up the spoon and cautiously sipped at the soup. It was watery, bland, and bitty, but it tasted like the finest chocolates to his starved body. He couldn't fool himself into thinking it was chocolate for long, as it was freezing cold and couldn't warm his insides as chocolate would.
“Tell me, Bucky... you’ve seen a great deal, haven’t you?” He grinned, showing his perfectly-white teeth. His phone vibrated; a message popped up on its screen.
"And I'm afraid as this very happy moment carries out, I'm going to be leaving you." An explosion rattled through the room, smoke clouding the two Avengers' Vision. When it had cleared, Zemo was gone.
"Yeah, I know," muttered Tony, tapping the elevator door shut. "Fri, take us up to the penthouse."
"Yeah, kiddo?"
Tony tossed the suit at him, "Go ahead, kiddo. I'll wait in here."
"Lucky for you, Pete, we're home."
Steve stood up, placing his hand on Peter's shoulder. "Come on, kiddo. Come in the lounge with me and Bucky, ever since he found out you can play chess he's been bugging me to invite you over to play..."
"Okay... alright."
"Who else signed?" Steve asked, coldly. He didn't want to be the only one who didn't. Sam wasn't going to sign but he was only one person. One incredibly awesome person but one person all the same.
"Hey!"
"They hurt you. Real bad," Peter informed the boy, their eyes locked together. The boy was panicking: he had only known this reality for a small amount of time but it was slowly being torn apart... and he didn't like that. It may have been made up of lies but it was a comfort of knowledge - false knowledge, but knowledge all the same.
The man smiled, holding out his hand towards the kid, "I'm a friend of your father... pleasure to meet you Peter."
"I asked you a question, актив/asset."
"More like he'd kill me, he loves you too much."
Steve took one hand off the bike to make a rude gesture into the air. "This is how much I care, tincan!"
"You didn't?" Steve commented, embracing the fourteen year old, who was now clinging to his shoulders.
The boy nodded.
"Yes, please."
Other than all that nonsense with the Sokovia Accords...
The man stood outside of the apartment door, his face twisted in an evil grin. His eyes were wide and beady - a manic laughter seeing out of them. A look that haunted nightmares... a man who caused them for fun. He lifted his fist to the red door:
"Morning, punk," Bucky mumbled, startling Steve slightly seeing as the Captain hadn't noticed his pal's awakening.
"They're entering the building, Cap."
"Be quiet!" Tony hissed, jabbing Steve in the gut with his elbow. "Or I'll be the one fighting you instead of a Hydra agent!"
The two flew out of the building, and by flew out I mean Tony flew and Peter swung. Despite it being his first time, he was webbing around as if he'd been doing it for years.
"Why?"
"Well, obviously!" Tony snapped, before taking a deep breath. "I'm stressed."
"Can't forget Iron."
"What? Oh, I'm okay..."
"Consequences?"
Natasha smirked. "I'm training with Peter, later. Tony asked me to teach him how to throw a decent punch... not sure why though." She eyed the doorway, and watched as the two Starks walked in. "Speaking of the devil..."
* * *
He watched as the door began to open, but he couldn't keep his eyes open. Something was making them flicker shut, causing them to feel extremely heavy. His head was pounding, aching, it felt like his brain was shaking. He had to stay... he had to... he had... everything faded out of his vision.
It wasn't Bucky, though. Steve knew that. It wasn't just hunch. The soldier just knew that his boyfriend would never commit such an awful crime. However, the video that had been released showed a man who looked very much like Bucky and had consequently been identified as James Buchanan Barnes. It wasn't him... he hoped.
He got no response, which was expected, really, seeing as the boy had uttered no words the other eight hours he had been there.
Peter beamed at him. "I thought you'd never ask."
"He's our son, for gosh sake, why can't I know?" Steve asked, trying his upmost best not to clench his fists.
Kissing Steve quickly on the forehead, the brunet quickly pulled his arm away from his boyfriend, and glanced at the door: his hearing picking up on the incoming footsteps. Yet, they were too light to be Tony's, and he doubted that the man had sent Peter in alone.
Zemo pointed to a screen, and then to the door, before answering Steve's question. "He's in there. But I wouldn't go in there right now."
"Yeah, kiddo," he pushed a few of Peter's curls away from his eyes, "I should've told you everything."
As the father and son walked through the main hallway - the one that passed by the training room - Tony saw Clint peek his head out from one of the many doors. "Not the time, Barton," and when the man continued through the door, Tony raised his voice, "Did you hear me, Barton, or do you need me to go get the mind stone from Vision?"
"It's just unfair that Pete looks up to Tony more than me..."
"Same sort of stuff as Pops. But I can climb, and I have this sixth sense. I call it my Spidey sense," Peter rambled, stopping when he saw the bemused expression on Bucky's face.
Steve was on his boyfriend's tail, the other man still clinging on to the vehicle with his claws. They followed him through another underpass, to be joined by Sam, who had finally caught up with the action.
"Bye," Peter mumbled, as he started to get out of his suit.
Steve doesn't know who said it but the voice is coming out of the speakers of the vehicle, the blue lights on top of it flashing. So, he does the smartest thing possible, he jumped onto the vehicle, splintering the windshield. The car stopped. Steve pulled him out of the window, shoving him to the floor, before smashing his way into the car, once more after his boyfriend, who was currently running over over the top of a speeding car... outpacing it.
Sharon tossed a piece of paper towards Sam. “The receipt for your gear...” She smirked, when the Falcon read out what it said- tucking her hair behind her ears at the same time.
"Shush, Pete," Tony said sternly, holding up his hand, at the same time.
"You do realise I'm his one and only, super, amazing, awesome son?" mocked Peter.
"I'm not your soldier... you can't make me do anything. And anyway, I'm fourteen; how could I read a book like this in any less time?"
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony chuckled at the boy's enthusiasm. "That's okay, Ted! I mean, Ked. It's okay."
"Six months, kiddo, that's how long you were out..." Steve said slowly, unsure of how Peter was going to take it.
Peter started to shiver uncontrollably, shaking his head in protest. "No, no, no... No," he mumbled. His Pops had told him all about Hydra: how they had experimented on people, how they wanted world control, how they had somehow brought his best friend - boyfriend, he corrected himself - back to life.
Sam looked at the glass panes, shaking his head. He huffed as his wings were taken away from him. " I better not look out the window and see anybody flying around in those."
His head was spinning. His heart beating faster then it ever had before. He tried to block the memories, the thoughts he had been locking away for so long. But, it was impossible.
Tony raised his eyebrows, glancing at his son out of the corner of his eyes. "What?"
The man began to stand up, before being interrupted by Steve. "Wait. Tony. I need to say something else. Avengers related."
Smirking, the philanthropist stated, "No, you can't retract it. Thank you."
"We can do that next, let me just set up the-"
"Fury said there could be a Hydra base here," Tony continued, in the middle of a long run-on explanation of the bases Peter could have been taken to. He was tapping the screen of Steve's laptop with the end of the paintbrush, gesturing to a point seemingly in the middle of nowhere. "It's only a maybe but it's close by and the best place to start. There have been no sightings of The Winter Soldier - and we know this because of social media goes crazy every single time - so they can't have gone far."
Just as he was considering allowing himself to fall back to sleep, he heard his pops call out, "Bucky, have you seen my sketchpad anywhere?"
"Got him," Sam replies as he flew down and shoved the chopper off course. He grinned, the adrenaline of the battle really getting to him. It reminded him of Riley- the action they faced... He swooped down towards the street below.
"You got five seconds, Cap."
"Like what?"
Peter pulled his hand away from the boy, and when the boy looked back at the teen... he was gone. The words stuck, though. What would he remember? When?
Peter suddenly stood up, his eyes wide. "I just remembered. I got some homework to do." The teen then ran out of the room, before anyone could question him on his choice of excuse.
The man stood up, and began to walk over to the boy's side. Yet, as in a movement of equality, he sat down on the bed beside him: proving the boy's point that he was there to help. "You got injured, актив/asset... we're lucky you're still in one piece."
"Right begins you."
"Steve..."
"What-"
"Da-a-a-ad," Peter whined, pulling away from his father's grip on his hand, once they had reached the penthouse. He was embarrassed, confused and annoyed... maybe not so much of the latter. "If Miss Potts is coming over later, what am I doing?"
"You'll be safe because that's your folks coming to rescue you," Peter whispered, putting his hand on the boy's shoulder.
"I never really knew them. Barely remember them, to be honest. No point crying about it now."
"Dating?"
"It might not but it's certainly one of my weaknesses."
Steve rolled his eyes, completely buying into the annoying game. "And who told that intern?"
"Ned and I are gonna go play Minecraft on the Xbox. See you in a bit."
Super Strength
Natasha was next to speak. She had somehow materialised next to them, her training paying off in both missions for S.H.I.E.L.D. and the occasional prank war. "For the record, this is what making things worse looks like. Please don't do anything else, Steve. Peter might have Tony but he does need a responsible adult in his life to turn to... speaking of the devil."
Anyway, even if they did take the ones they knew about away, they were so many more that they'd never find. Tony was an intelligent man, after all. No one would ever outsmart him. Ever. Except maybe Peter.
"Dad," Peter said, when they had finally finished covering String Theory, "Can we watch a movie, after dinner?"
"Peter," Steve said softly as he gently tucked the boy's curls out of his hazel eyes. "You awake, bud?"
"I can't tell you."
His senses were dialled to eleven.
"I have as much faith in your parenting skills as I have in you not dying via drinking paint water," he deadpanned.
The pair strolled into the kitchen. "Hey, Pops," Peter said, sitting down on one of the chairs by the table.
Steve walked up to Bucky. His hair was slightly shorter. He was wearing a maroon jacket. But, it was his Bucky. The Bucky he hadn't seen in six months. "Do you know me?" he asked, his eyes flickering back towards Sam, occasionally. They were in Romania, Bucharest to be precise.
Tony combed his fingers through Peter's hair, "That's okay, bud, you're welcome."
Tony burst out laughing at the sight of his son stuck to the wall, "You 'kay, kid?"
"Well, you've got these powers. Why don't we see what you can do and maybe - just maybe - create a suit to match your abilities."
"I mean," Steve paused and took a breath. "I mean that I don't want our son going 'round the country in a suit running headfirst into danger."
* * *
"Hey... What exactly are you doing?"
Steve smiled, knowing that his kid was back to himself - or at least much closer to his original state than the day before. "You want some pancakes, kid?"
Steve bowed his head, sighing. He didn't want to sign the damn accords. Heck! The United Nations were almost as bad as Hydra with some of their laws. It wouldn't surprise him if there were still Hydra agents who were high ranking government officials. If they managed to infiltrate S.H.I.E.L.D. the United Nations was probably just as Hydra-ified .
"Focus up," Tony interjected. He fluttered his hands in the air before continuing. "I'm sorry. Did I just mishear you, or did you agree with me?"
"Maybe later, jerk," he muttered. "Turn left."
Tony stormed into the lounge, throwing his briefcase onto the countertop. He ignored both Clint and Peter's greetings and headed towards the kitchen area. He picked up a bottle champagne, opening it in an instance, before taking a swig.
"So I can do this." Tony flicked a silver lever beneath the steering wheel. A red interface system appeared on the dashboard, similar to the one inside his suits. "Fri, turn on auto-drive mode; take us to the Tower."
"I'm your Pops, Peter, why the heck aren't you talking to me?" he asked, the anger in his question directed at himself and not his son.
Peter sat down on his bed, shuffling over when Bucky came over to him, sitting next to him. "So you're Spider-Man...You got powers, Pete?"
"Pete, I have to go... Pepper will kill me if I don't get ready for my expo tomorrow," Tony admitted, as the two headed back to Steve's apartment.
"Doesn't matter, you should still tell me everything about him. You've probably gone and tested some of your crazy inventions on him - gone and got him injured..."
Knowing that was true, Steve calmly replied, "Fine..." Then, muttered to himself, "I knew it wasn't an accident but I never imagined it was you."
Shaking his head in disbelief and confusion, the boy queried, "Who are you? How... How did you get in here?"
As Steve got closer to his ex, he realised his son was also in the room. Peter was sat on the desk chair, casually spinning it side to side, in an act of boredom. Natasha broke him from his trance. "Try not to break anything while we fix this."
"Pops?" Peter whispered, trying to reach Steve, stretching his hand out as far as possible. Steve moves over to Peter's side.
"Thanks, Dad," the boy whispered, leaning against his father's shoulder. "I don't blame you. It's not your fault. You didn't do anything. It was all Mister Criminal's fault."
They mentioned Bucky's death... leaving both Steve and Bucky in tears. Bucky saw how much worse his pal was taking it and decided to comfort him. He placed him arms around the soldier.
"It's fine. I've done it loads - just don't mention it to your Pops, he's got a soft spot for the government."
"Our son, Tony, our son." Steve looked across to the judge, who appeared to be scribbling something swiftly across his paperwork.
The man had had to cancel his date, drag his son out of the house and think of all the possible things to let things go the way he wanted them to. He didn't exactly want Steve in a cell... however much they disagreed.
"Fine," announced Peter, who seemed to have cheered up a bit. He pulled himself off of the bed and followed Steve out of the room.
"I didn't say not to wear them to breakfast, did I? Just that they will probably annoy your Pops... which isn't exactly a bad thing."
"Oh," Peter whispered, it being the best answer he could think of in the short space of time.
"Hello?" he called out, his voice rough and hoarse. He wasn't exactly expecting an answer, he just wanted to see if it still worked.
"Finally done, are we, актив/asset? It's taken you long enough," Zemo stayed roughly, "In future I hope you complete orders quickly."
"Felt something on my neck... Like a bite."
Peter spent an hour doing his schoolwork, before he tugged his suit out of his bag. He threw his blue, plaid shirt, denim jeans, and grey tee, to the carpet - stepping inside and pulling on his suit.
"Pete wants me to go, so, see you tomorrow."
"Want me to pick you up?"
"Well, Stark, he doesn't really have a choice now... does he?" the General said, smiling at the man's lack of control over the situation. The powerful Tony Stark finally having to listen to the law because he wouldn't want his son hurt, would he now? "If he doesn't sign then I'll have to detain him."
* * *
Tony met his ex's eyes. The blue in Steve's was turning teal, going greener than Tony had ever seen. The billionaire's own eyes were wide and teary. "If we don't do this now, Steve, its gonna be done to us later. That's the fact. That won't be pretty."
Tony smiled, shaking his head in disbelief. His son really was that modest... or ignorant of his own brilliance. Either way, it was rather adorable. "And you're smarter than most of the people I," he coughed, "Ms Potts, employ."
Peter looked at his Dad in shock, he mouthed, "Pops?"
No, that wouldn't work. No one could ever replace Steve Rogers. Ever.
Super Metabolism
"Bye," Tony replied, his voice trailing off as he got further and further away.
"Radioactive?" Tony echoed, turning his attention back to the road in front of him.
"Be prepared to get annihilated!"
Peter quickly closed his browser - deleting his search history - before spinning around on his chair. "It was just a lot to take in, y'know, Pops and Bucky..."
"You okay, Peter?" Ned asked, noticing his friend's pale face as they were led into a room, that was labelled Cross-Species Genetics.
"Petey, baby, it's okay," Tony whispered, rubbing Peter's back soothingly. "It's alright..."
Steve raised his eyebrows. He then exhaled before saying, "So you... The Winter Soldier killed Tony's dad?"
Playfully irritated, Peter chanted in a tone that made it sound like Tony was forcing him to say it, "I loved it, it was really well-cooked."
"That was different. I didn't exactly like Howard, did I, punk?"
Steve watched in horror as the pod, which was holding his boyfriend prisoner, was carried away by a military level forklift. He tried to make eye contact with the brunet but Bucky made no signal that he had seen him. The soldier then turned away, trying to ignore everything that was happening...
and smiled when the photo of his Dad started to glow on the screen. It was of Tony and Peter from the premiere of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, back on the eight of August the year before. They had gone for Peter's birthday, which was two days later - and it was one of the best non-sci-fi movies he had seen. Peter had eaten a giant tub of Ben & Jerry's ice cream, the one named after his Dad: Stark Raving Hazelnut, And had felt a little queasy afterwards.
"But, it's up to you. It would be dangerous. The UN could... they could d-deploy you for whatever battles they want. Even if I, or you, said no. You wouldn't have a choice. You'd be signing your life away..."
"Because of Bucky?"
The door opened, causing Peter to flinch back in fear of what was to come. There was a blond man stood there, one he hadn't seen before: but one he already knew not to trust. Everyone here was dangerous... even Bucky.
Peter sighed, picking at a few of the French fries from the plate on his bed. They were golden, lightly salted and seemed to have some sort of herbal marinate on them: nothing like the fries his Pops has ever made before.
"What's best for me is being with Dad," Peter stated, holding in the urge to clench his fists. His face was definitely red by now; he could feel his blood raging.
"Stand down, now," Rhodey ordered. His voice is stern, sterner than Steve has ever heard it to be before. He watched as Bucky remained still beside Steve, only turning his head slightly to watch as Steve placed his shield back on his back. "Congratulations, Cap. You're a criminal."
Bucky raised his eyebrows, "Bucker-what?"
"I felt like I got bitten. It was around the spider container in there. But I didn't, it was probably just because Katie, the tour guide, told us one was missing."
Maybe he could teach Peter to do it...
"Coms are down in the main sector. Hyde says Zemo's dead," one of the agents stated, occasionally staring at the Soldier before throwing his glance to the other side of the room.
"And they don't grant visas to weapons of mass destruction," he continued.
Bucky pecked a kiss on Steve's cheek, "He loves you no matter what... if he's even a tiny bit like his old Pops then he'll be fine."
The billionaire spun on the spot. He hadn't seen the group come in. "Secretary Ross wants you both prosecuted. Had to give him something," he stated, shrugging.
What could go wrong?
"Yes, Dad," Peter replied in a muffled voice, after removing his cupped hands from his ears.
He aimed the gun at Peter's shoulder, before continuing: "Any last words, Peter Stark-Rogers?"
* * *
"Two weeks," the judge answered, "Now any further questions, before we can end this session?"
Either way, he was content to stay in his penthouse and let them all carry on. Just because they all thought he was an Avenger didn’t mean he really belonged with them. He was happy enough by himself.
“I got delayed. It won’t happen again.” His voice came out monotone and Norman’s eyes narrowed. To Tony’s surprise, he leaned forward and sniffed a little. Suddenly his eyes went wide.
Steve rubbed the back of his head and turned away slightly. He smiled a little to himself.
He was absolutely stunned. What did that mean?
“I’m gonna
Steve rubbed his head tiredly. “Just-just don’t feel like you have to hide what you’re really thinking around me. I don’t think you’re a liability. You have me at your corner, even if you don’t know it. When we go to this party...” Steve dropped his hand and looked at him. “Don’t deal with them yourself. Come to me if you need something. Don’t feel like you’re bothering me because I’m telling you now, you’re not.”
“Sure! I’ll get on them right away. No problem.” Tony smiled, feeling something brewing in the back of his mind. He hoped it wouldn’t be the case but…
He was in complete and total darkness again.
He hadn’t slept well because of the nightmares and spending hours trying to decipher Steve’s intentions in the elevator. But he’d managed to reach some semi-lucid state where he’d been resting on the bed, at least trying to get some sleep. When the sun was just starting to rise at six-fifteen in the morning, he heard loud banging coming from the main quarters. Loud banging and howling laughter.
“Yeah. Thanks.” Tony said numbly, turning away to dodge Steve’s gaze before it could get any worse. This was borderline torture.
“Yes sir.” Tony smiled shakily and slowly knelt onto the bed, crawling over until he was leaning over Steve carefully.
His body throbbed as he knelt in the sand. What did he do now?
As Tony looked around, he waited for a reply, but before Steve said anything, they heard a small noise.
“You were so hungry. But don’t worry, I have plenty, today was a good day.”
Tony shakes his head and tucks his arms around his chest. He doesn’t feel so cold anymore. His body feels heavy but frail as if one wrong step will drag him down. “They w-won’t.”
“Y-yeah.”
“Yes. And very possessive, I won’t lie.”
“Uhh Tony? That guy keeps staring at you.” Jeremy suddenly pointed out and Tony frowned and looked behind him.
“Well...what about me? As I mentioned, I've been outside before and have survived just fine. I know how to hold my own in a fight and that way you won’t need to worry about my thirst.” Tony presented the idea again with his hands out-stretched, hoping against all hope. Maybe, just maybe Zeke would-
Whoever the Captain seemed to be, he certainly knew how to drive Zeke up the wall. And that was quite remarkable, considering Zeke was one of the strongest vampires Tony knew. Maybe he was a pureblood vampire himself.
“Steve...” But Steve just shook his head and carried on. Another button loosened and somehow Steve was on the last one before Tony could even catch his breath. The shirt opened and Tony’s abs were fully exposed under the blue glow of the reactor.
“Set-up.” Tony croaked, still struggling to breath over the vice around his neck. “Had to be.”
another vampire?”
“I-I hate this.” He whispered and tried to concentrate on slowing his breathing down.
“I can run scans if you like?”
When he opened his eyes and looked, Steve’s expression had darkened considerably. Those eyes were a deeper gold, and reflected crimson in the light.
“Anthony...” Norman’s eyes burned with anger. His lips stretched into a snarl.
“I’m so glad for you boys-“
The guard lowered his hand from his com and regarded them. Then he ducked his head a little in Steve’s direction.
He tried not to let the guilt grow. He'd not seen Stark since that day.
It's called
He felt Steve stiffen beside him. That was fair. He deserved it.
“ETA is ten minutes. Confirming we have Anthony Edward Stark on board. Report to base.”
The yellow was gone. Tony felt cold all over and Steve finally turned to him with burning look in his eyes.
.” Steve breathed and Tony tried desperately not to push Steve’s hand away as he slid his whole hands onto his shoulders. Carefully he began to slide his hands down along Tony’s back until finally they curled around and settled onto his waist comfortably.
“Really Steve?
“Your name is Anthony Edward Stark, or Tony, as most people call you. You are part of a team of humans called the Avengers, and play a part as a superhero called Ironman. A few months ago, you went missing and we suspected Skrulls had managed to kidnap you. Whatever happened after...you found yourself here.”
“Explain.” Steve said, with anger in his eyes and Grant wanted to duck under the force of it.
"I guess it feels good to be back in the..."
It was ridiculous. Childish. Why was he relieved to hear Steve was busy? What on earth did that make a difference to? Steve still didn’t care about him and he still didn’t care.
Tony chuckled softly. “Yeah. Ignore the suit. It was just a gift.”
Steve saw the moment Stark seemed to realize something was different but didn’t let that stop him. He pushed forward with both feet and sprang into motion, taking Stark by the wrists and pushing him so far back, they almost made it to the opposite side of the room.
“Could you give this to them? The Avengers? They were...they’ll...”
Before heading back to the cavern, he always made sure to immerse his scent in the cities’ natural flair. He’d scrape his armor against the alley walls, do some jumps in puddles, and smear a bit of blood on his calves to add more authenticity to his imaginary double life.
Steve shook his head. “I’m not interested in Sharon.”
"Oh Tony..."
Tony blinked slowly and didn’t say a word. Instead he slowly stood up and inched closer in a painstakingly slow manner until he was a breath away from Steve’s neck.
He was Shellhead once. Iron man, a brother, a friend, a hero, an
Wanda is crying. Not outwardly but there are tears running down her cheeks. Steve instantly thinks of his own.
Tony blinked open his eyes slowly and let his mind wake up.
be saved.”
The only thing that made it different from prison was the large window at the end. It was transparent and revealed the orange hue of the evening sky. Probably a reminder of the outside world.
And if Steve couldn’t help him,
“It took some negotiating. But between me and Barnes, we managed to wrangle about four months worth of supplies. Should be enough to get him back in the game. If he needs any translating, tell him we’re here.”
Tony heaved a sigh of relief. It was quiet.
Feeling a stone settle low in his stomach, he coughs and feels his body choke as he hooks one shaking finger under each side and pull the cowl back.
His heart ached. His mouth went dry and his eyes turned unseeing. Suddenly he was taken back to that moment where he’d learned about what had happened to Steve. And who he’d blamed for it.
Just before Reed leaves, he stops by the door. When he speaks, his voice is cool and indifferent, and Steve knows suddenly, that this will be the last time they speak.
Steve’s lips pull back into a snarl. It’s frustrating to be affected by Reed’s words but some things are off-limits.
The red eyes sharpened. “Many things. So many things but Anthony-“ She slid into the room seamlessly and reached him with ease, brushing a lock of hair out of his eyes. She tucked it behind his ear and tilted her head.
It was the back of a restaurant. The foul stench of sewage and rotting food filled his nostrils. His face was dragged through a pile of pulverized fruit.
Fingers slipped under his chin and pulled him until he was a breath away from Steve.
So why then, did he feel like something was sinking deep in his chest?
Back when he was younger and blue-eyed and his father was still alive. Back when he wasn’t reliant on another to keep him alive.
“Stark.“
Steve was beaming. He hadn’t felt so light in such a long time.
“Whitney.” Zeke’s voice was ice-cold. “Did you misunderstand what I said?”
“I don’t know what you’re talking about. Jeremy’s sweet and kind and much better than anything you ever-“
“No. I admit the situation has changed but you should stay here with Whitney. I can’t imagine forgiving myself if something happened to you my pet.” He said, and without further discussion, spun back round and picked up his pen once more, scribbling to his so-called friend or whatever.
“Tony that’s...” Steve leans back in his chair and looks up at the ceiling. He’s blinking away tears again. “That’s great news. I’m so relieved, I can’t tell you.”
“Ah, look at that! Boy comes in wearing this man’s colors, and he doesn’t even notice!” He cried, and even Fury huffed, rolling his eye when Tony glared at him.
“Thank you.” Steve said sincerely, wondering just how him and Tony had gotten such good friends. “What about the forged records?”
“Why does he need a psych eval?”
“Cheers.” Pierce said with a smile, eyes gleaming. “To Steve Rogers.”
“Well? Answer me.” Steve seethed, and Tony‘s eyes darted up at him in shock.
Tony feels Captain America freeze above him. He suddenly pictures a lion about to pounce.
Tony’s flat on the ground and his body is facing the sky like a twisted sculpture. His helmet and gauntlets are off revealing his face and hands, and for some reason that makes Steve ache more because he looks so vulnerable, and almost fragile. He looks human which is something Steve has always found to be not enough, when describing how brilliant Tony is.
Tony could feel himself getting his energy back. Slow and steady he was starting to feel more like himself. Better than he had in a long time.
“No, of course not!” Tony hurried to say, realizing he should’ve been more patient. Throwing his hands up in front of him, he took a small step back as Zeke turned and glared at him.
“Oh.” Tony remembered that. He’d just never thought Steve would pop a boner for him.
“Oh yeah. It only took five seconds before Mr. Nice at the front door decided I’d be much better on the tarmac. Not that I blame him or anything.”
“Steve?” Carol asks, turning to him.
The armor's face-plate was cold and harsh to his pleas. For the first time ever, Steve didn’t know what Iron man was thinking.
“You don’t even wanna look at me. Even now. I guess I shouldn’t be surprised.” He laughed with no humor. “I was awful to you. On the Helicarrier. I said some awful things to you.”
Tony raised a brow. “Moving?”
“Are you drunk?” Steve asked with a frown, eyeing stain on his shirt and the glasses on the table, including the one Tony was still nursing in his hand.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I see you’ve acquainted yourself with the role well.” Reed says quietly, looking around the office and anywhere other than at Steve.
Scoffing, Tony stormed ahead, not giving Steve the chance to see his own lips twitching. He hated how Steve managed to get so much out of him but at the same time, it was the most fun he’d had in so long.
“Why not? It’s true-“
Behind the soft triangle was a medium sized Iron-tsum. Only this was resting on a small blue plush circle and was watching everything ever so quietly. It’s body was rounder than Cap-tsum’s and when Tony looked closer, he saw a baby Iron and Cap-tsum peering from behind. And then it clicked.
“Yeah. It feels like a prison. Might as well be the Raft. Ross, you there?” He snickered and tried not to let his eyes shift up when Steve did the same.
“Oh, nothing. Just...” Steve cleared his throat and let his eyes run over Tony’s form. Finally he decided on what he wanted to say and Tony felt his breath catch in anticipation. This whole conversation was throwing him off kilter.
“The Avengers, Tony.” And Captain America stares at him like he’s surprised. “We’ve all been working together for years.”
“Come. Sit.”
Slowly, Tony trudges through the thin layer snow. As someone had correctly pointed out, a snow storm is coming and Tony knows it will be his last stop. He’s on his last legs-an animal needing to be put down.
When Tony woke up, the sun was just starting to peak through the blinds of Steve’s window. Sunlight marked the room in a square pattern, all the way across Steve’s body, highlighting the shape of his muscles and the pink of his skin.
“God, I’m going to kill him.” Rogers whispers and brushes Tony’s hair out of his face. “You’re not alone. Trust me.”
The mistake cost him. Hands yanked him by the collar and shoved him to the floor. Then he was dragged harshly into a dim alley way he’d never seen before.
"So, kid, should I set up the board?"
Peter tried to cry for help but his screams were muffled by Bucky - no, the Winter Soldier's, metal arm. He could barely breathe. Every step he was forced to take caused a burning pain to shoot throughout his chest. They walked down so many corridors, which all had the same grey walls and white lights, that Peter was beginning to think that Bucky was making him trek through an entire labyrinth just to get to this 'room'. To be honest, he was impressed that his lungs hadn't burst by the time they reached the Dark Room.
* * *
"What?" muttered Peter, quietly. "Is it something bad? Is it deteriorating? Is it changing? Is it evolving?"
A few minutes later, the boy was greeted with a plate filled with delicious food, of which was only slightly burnt. "This looks amazing, thank you."
"Again, that is all in the past: people," he slammed his hands against the wooden desk, "This happened, before I got this," he points at his arc reactor, "This happened, before I even considered having a family."
"No."
Steve backed up until his back was against a tree. "I thought it was! Maybe it's underground."
"I've just got a bit of a headache. Gonna call my Dad, ask if he can pick me up," said Peter. "Tell Mr. Harrington for me, will you?"
"Well, anyway, I was looking through some of the files and I came across one which had my parents' names on it."
What was it that Dad had told him? Name five things you see that are you favourite colour, four things you can feel, three things you can hear, two things you can smell and one thing you can taste.
Steve followed after the prince with Sam trailing along behind him, heading to where a certain Sharon Carter was stood. "What's gonna happen to him?" Steve asked, trying to mask his panic with the usual face of confidence he wore.
"And how many more people do we save?" Sam snapped, leaning back in his seat. "I understand that some lives are lost. But without us there would be no survivors. None!"
"The kid's fine, Steven, let it go. You didn't need to know at the time, it's not important," Tony exclaimed, sure now that this was his final chance to keep his son's custody.
Steve nodded faintly, "You keep telling yourself that, Tones." He placed the pen down. "Hate to break up the set." He walked out of the office, leaving Tony to himself.
It couldn't have been more than seven in the morning when Peter woke up, bleary-eyed with a knot in a muscle in his neck from the awkward angle he had been resting his head. He was positioned on the couch half-sitting, half laying down in a way that suggested he had been painstakingly moved into a comfortable position after falling asleep on someone's shoulder. All of these thoughts were floating about in the back of his head, however, as he couldn't bring himself to shake the sleepy fog from his mind. He was floating somewhere between consciousness and being dead asleep, hearing and feeling everything around him but not particularly caring either way. As long as what he was sleeping on was vaguely horizontal and not made of radioactive spiders, Peter Stark-Rogers could sleep just fine.

"Apparently some organisation - Hydra, I think - planned it. They thought that my parents knew too much to be alive."
"I'm not sure, bud... I'm not sure." The billionaire looked out of the car window, watching the buildings disappear whilst Happy drove them back to the Tower. A few more minutes of silence followed before Tony finally asked, "What do you want for your birthday this year, kiddo?"
"Now, back to the suit," he said to himself.
Peter struggled against the restraints, letting a few tears slip down his face. But it didn't last for long... The Soldier was quick to forcefully push the boy's head back into the metal, holding it back as parts of the machine began to clasp around it. "Bucky I-" Peter pleaded, his words cut off by a rubber mouthguard that was shoved into his mouth.
It was unbelievable. Sometimes Tony wondered what it was that Steve saw the world through. His giddy optimism, matched only by the same mule-headed stubborness that drove him to sink himself into the ice for years.  Tony often joked to himself that Steve was more stubborn than he was.
Ezekiel had returned with his most trusted advisors, Whitney and Norman, after a very specific hunt. Tony hadn’t been told any details and of course, he never asked. But he did listen.
Tony’s breath caught. He didn’t dare hope, not now, not after earlier.
“Yeah, no.” Tony shook his head and rolled his eyes. “How about no.”
“Good.” Steve replied in his ear but still wouldn’t turn which bothered Tony.
Reed looks at him. His eyes dart over Steve and finally, he breaks eye contact. But not before Steve sees the way his eyes glisten with pain.
“Waiting for my ride.” Tony decided on, gritting his teeth as he inched back a step. The guy was clearly trouble. Tony didn’t want to spend another second near him.
To Steve’s complete horror, he begins to cry.
Tony noticed he was frowning though. And looking at the watch on his-
“It’s fine. What’s wrong with you, Stark?”
“Thanks.” Tony said sincerely and felt a hand settle into his hair from behind. To his surprise, Dugan laughed from behind them both and Tony noticed Gabe glare daggers at Dugan.
“And they failed.”
“Yes...sir.” Tony parroted but it didn’t come out strong. He didn’t know what to feel.
Gathering up his sheets from his station, he stood up and left the lab. Thankfully the others didn’t stop him, even if they did make a comment or two about how the commander was pissed at him. They were probably right-word traveled fast.
“Steve please-“
“Hey-“
manoeuvre.
Steve went quiet. Tony got the impression he was having a silent discussion with his team. But then-
They spend the night together. Nothing intimate happens since Steve (as he’d insisted Tony call him) spends the night on the couch. They don’t really sleep and instead Tony asks more about what they do together as omega and alpha. What Steve tells him, makes him hopeful beyond belief.
“All the time?”
“You choose. It’s my treat.” Steve’s speaker-augmented voice said and Tony knew something had changed. It was almost as if the dark cloud over Steve’s head had lifted. He sounded lighter and happier, like he hadn’t even been on a mission.
"You're beautiful when you laugh." A soft voice said and Tony froze.
“Well? What’re you waiting for?” Tony smirked and tilted his head back, watching Steve’s eyes hone in on the smooth, untouched skin of his throat.
"S-Steve..." He whispered, and reached blindly for him, feeling a soft damp cloth press against his belly gently. He thought he felt Steve's fingers trace the bandages too, being careful as they did.
“Yes.” It was always the same. Nothing new there.
He got the distinct impression he’d stepped on nails. Steve’s face dropped the moment he said it, and his eyes grew pinched.
“Yeah Tony. We’ve been looking for weeks.”
Tony.
Then Steve turned his head and looked at him, making eye contact. For a moment, Tony was taken back to a time where they would stand side by side and Steve would clap his shoulder and lean forward until they were sharing the same space and-
Steve kept his palm on Tony’s cheek and swept his thumb over his cheek lightly. Feeling something deep in him relax, Steve sucked in a deep breath and swallowed. For the first time in maybe months, his shoulders relaxed.
Tony left the courtroom distraught. He had two weeks to prove that old Capsicle wasn't good enough to look after Pete. That would be challenging, though, seeing as the man had been rather great at raising the boy.
"Nothing's missing, актив/asset. But if you're scared, just remember Hydra is here for you. They will never let Captain America and Iron Man do anything to you ever again."
"Well he did try to stab me in the chest but he missed. I'm better than him."
"Yeah..." lied Peter, his answer not at all convincing enough to comfort Tony. They walked over to the table and sat down opposite them. "H-hi Pops..."
Cleaning his throat, Steve added, "How do you feel, Pete?"
Peter blushed, this was a lot of praise to take in at once. "Thanks..."
The brunet picked it up, quickly skimming through a few of the pages. "The Sokovia Accords? They want the team to sign it? All of us? They want us to work for them and them alone..?"
"Because he loves me way too much," Peter replied.
"It's Ned and thanks, Dad," Peter exclaimed, throwing his arms around Tony. He was almost taller than him at this point, meaning Peter had to move his head to the side in order not to hit his father's. "We are so going to finish the new Lego set you got me!"
Steve had been looking for Bucky but they hadn't been successful, even with the help from Sam Wilson and Natasha Romanoff.
He fumbled around his room, looking for his phone, and grabbed it in a sigh of relief. His fingers searched for the contact labelled:
"That is not what this meeting is about, Agent Romanoff," Ross declared, silencing the assassin. "As you all know, you - The Avengers, are the saviours of peace. You protect everyone."
“Quit messing around, we have a job to do.”
“No. You can’t have any.”
"Oh, you think you're special Stark? You don't get brownie points for knowing the Commander, you're not any more important to him than the lowest of the low. You're a risk to everyone you meet and I know it, they know it and
“I know you can. But it’s my treat. And don’t worry about the money.” Steve added, nodding to the driver who had just pulled in with their car. “I have a pension that’s been building up since the late 70s. I think I’m fine, rich-boy.”
“You hypocrite! You fucking-how dare you-“
After Steve pulled back, Tony blinked at him and reached up to circle Steve’s wrists.
“W’ll hurt you...”
Finally they reached the living room. And one by one Nat, Clint, Thor and Bruce settled in the couches, leaving just Tony and Steve standing in the center.
This is just one reason why.
to get what he wants.”
It’s not all of them. Only a few at this time.
Trish rolled her eyes and looked away while Ben and Sam just looked at him blankly, like he was some thief who’d come to take their food away. The two women just kept their heads down, sneaking glances at Ben and Trish.
“I did.” Tony said softly, looking up. “And well...you know what this law is. You know what it’s meant to do. How many omegas would have been in the same position? How many alphas do you think actually disagreed with it?”
Feeling his body coil in anticipation, Tony licked his lips and looked up, feeling a little pleased at Steve’s hungry stare. Steve's hands tightened a fraction around his wrists, holding him in place.
Thank you so much to everyone who's commenting so far! I really REALLY appreciate it!! PLEASE DON'T STOP!! :DDD
“It was.” Steve says with a sigh. “I don’t think I’ll ever be free of it.”
“Stark. Hey, Tony, are you with us?” Maria said firmly, shaking his shoulder a little and suddenly, he was back.
Separation.
Tony frowned and tried to make out who it was through the dark tinted windows. He couldn’t see a face but he could tell Steve had his arms crossed.
for me..."
Scoffing to himself, Tony stood and smiled. Could it really have been that arachnid that took the ghouls down? What did it have to do with big blond over there?
She was a resident. Surprising considering Tony had yet to meet one and it had been weeks of not seeing any. Still, no time like the present he thought and stretched his limbs out once again.
“Happy?” Tony frowned but paused with a raised brow. Was something wrong?
“None of us want you dead. Not one of us. Least of all me.”
“Tony, it’s okay.” Rogers murmurs quietly and when Tony turns, he’s surprised to find Roger’s looking back at him with concern. “You don’t need to share your room with anyone. I don’t want you to worry.”
“Like when you knotted me for the first time. You held me and I told you I loved you.”
Tony clapped a hand to his mouth and shook his head, and to Steve horror he saw Tony begin to blink rapidly. And he knew why.
“That’s a good name, don’t you think?”
“You’ll host the team Stark. I don’t care if you don’t like it. You’ll do it.”
“Steve?” Tony blinked and shifted his head a little on the pillow. Steve sat up from leaning on his hands and reached for the bottle he’d prepared.
“What, he just...
“They found out about the Dyson sphere.”
“St’ve.” Tony interrupts softly and smiles. “Th’nk you.”
“C’mon, go grab your suit and let’s go. Alive or not, someone’s gonna have to go.”
“Heads up Stark. Your number one fan.” Fury said, nodding towards the crowd but Tony squinted and tried to look closer.
“S-sorry, I didn’t mean-“
The Cap-tsum started to cry. It’s eyes went huge and frightened and it started to whimper like it had never been more afraid. And what was even worse was that even then it continued to try and climb the high step to reach its baby. And continued to cry as it always slid back and fell. All around them the other dozens of babies started to peep and whimper softly and some of them even started crying.
“Oh. I thought maybe you’d...” Tony glanced at the floor, instinctively curling away from all the people who were staring at them and fighting the burn in his cheeks. Something ugly settled in his stomach.
“Here, have a seat.” Tony said quietly and quickly got up to let the man take his place. As soon as he did however, Gabe grabbed his arm by the cuff and shook it firmly.
That was when Tony noticed. There was a bright red dot aiming straight for Steve’s back. He was totally exposed to it.
Tony knew he was the wrong choice. Steve probably knew it now too.
“Of course.” He scoffs and tries not to let her defeated look put him off. “They’re so kind. After betraying me and the entire team. Such good people.”
Something shifted in him then. Hearing Nat say it, changed something. His mind gained clarity and suddenly he knew what he wanted. The feelings he’d kept hidden away were doing no favours. They’d tried the diplomatic route once. It hadn’t worked.
“Tony. There’s no way on god’s earth we’re not doing that again.”
"I do." Steve's eyes crinkled with joy. Something bloomed in his heart at the thought. Tony Stark. A mystery but also a man capable of weathering any storm. He had something special that Steve could already feel himself admiring.
“Tony-“
“Tony. You’re okay.”
Shaken from his thoughts, Tony turned and met the man of the hour. Steve was wearing a very attractive light blue shirt and some very well cut jeans that did wonders for his ass. He’d gotten a haircut, Tony noted and he had to admit, it really suited him.
“You will. But we need to come to an agreement. I’ll send one out to you as soon as I can.”
Strange looks at him and swallows and Steve resists the urge to close his eyes and never wake up. It’s like being in the ice all over again.
“Wanna spar? Might be good to let some steam out.” Steve asked carefully, suddenly feeling glued to Stark’s eyes.
“He is my son and Tony is
Again.
Would lead to their marriage. And soon-to-be divorce.
“You don’t need to say it. In fact, it’d be better if you didn’t.” He ignored the look of shock Tony gave him. “You’ve spent the last month looking at me as a threat. I want you to get used to seeing me as you did before.”
“You care about hurting me. That’s why you’re here even though you should be with Reed. That’s why you’re not arresting me. You care.” Steve acknowledged and gestured towards Tony’s whole body. “That’s why you’re shaking.”
“Armor order, Disassemble.” He says and somehow, the whole armor starts to come away in a pile.
“I just worry. If our lord loses blood resources, how will we all survive? I want the faction to thrive.”
All good things came to an end eventually. Tony just wasn’t prepared for it when it did.
“Great.” Steve smiled and approached him carefully, reaching out to place his hands on his broad, shoulders. He had the body of someone who did a lot of heavy lifting and the height matched too, now that he thought about it. “We’ll go slow. Shadow boxing to start with. Then we’ll try some moves. It’s good. A good distraction.”
“Stark.” She said bluntly and Tony tried not to wince at the tone. That was definitely not an improvement from last time.
“Not the woman, although that’s Nat. She’s a friend too. The other one?”
With his shoulders held high, he made his way through the crowd to the bar again. Just as before, he made his request for Dugan and waited while the bartender got a glass.
“Reed-“
“When I saw you in it for the first time, I got so hard, I had to keep facing you. I couldn’t turn around because I was worried the agents would notice.”
The research and development department had separate living quarters to other departments. This group of twenty had a large living area equipped with couches, a TV, pool table and a couple of chairs and tables.
This time he had a different set of escorts. This group of young women didn’t pay much attention to him but they didn’t seem too bothered by him either. He counted that as a win.
Another splash. His eyes burned from the feeling.
“What have you done?” He whispered in cold fury, looking for all the world like he was about to tear Tony to shreds.
It’s calm. Steve thinks he can hear the familiar sound of repulsers.
“They don’t deserve it. That’s what you mean.” Steve finished quietly and Tony fought against the burning in his eyes as he nodded and swallowed.
A weird feeling of warmth swept over him at the touch. Almost instantly, he felt his mind start to go fuzzy and his body start to sway.
“This is a truce. You help us and we don’t beat you like you deserve.”
That evening, Tony is alone in his bedroom. Ty hasn’t joined him yet and Tony’s not ready for him to.
Then, to Tony’s surprise, Steve sniffed the air and wrinkled his nose.
A cold shiver ran down his spine and it took everything in him to keep his voice steady.
Tony moaned when Steve’s tongue slipped into his mouth. He’d never get tired of this. Ever.
He hated that his voice trembled as he said it. And he hated that Carol noticed too.
Tony wanted to cry. How the hell was he gonna get home?
Steve was watching him with a gentle gaze and there was something close to pride in his eyes. Like Tony was something to be proud off.
Besides, isn’t it more believable that anything Steve had said? It’s definitely the kind of thing he deserves.
"I know that look." Steve said dully. "This is the part where you tell me you regret last night, and that we shouldn't have done it, or that you shouldn't have enjoyed it."
“I’m taking this picture.” He blurted out and could hear Pepper’s frown.
“Friday, Thursday, Wednesday-“
“I need to go. I know it’s a bad time-“
Slowly he pressed the button and stepped in. It was was like he was on autopilot. The world was distant and his mind was drifting.
They get an incoming three weeks later. The Ironman armor is flying towards them at record speed. It’s the black and gold model that Steve had started to get used to but it’s not his favorite. He preferred the red and gold.
”Stark!
"I can't believe you'd actually consider..." Steve shakes his head and bites his lip hard enough to draw blood. "You would've...to yourself if I hadn't..."
Zeke’s eyes bore into him.
He ran as fast as he could. Through the sand and the dust and the heat. Until his body was weak and his vision was blurring and his mouth was raw and dry.
"Oh." Tony says numbly and just blinks tiredly. It makes sense he wasn't told. It wouldn't have been fair to involve Steve's killer in the mix.
But Steve isn’t convinced. “Tony, I need you to listen. I know this is a lot to take in but you need to listen to me-“
“Well you need to calm down. It’s not good for the baby or me if you keep fighting with everyone. Clint told me you nearly took his eye out when he was training with you.”
“Steve...” Carol breathed in his ear. Steve didn’t take his eyes off Tony, not even for a second.
“The arc reactor. Because you are Ironman.”
There’s nothing more you can say. You don’t own it anymore.” Tony whispered harshly and was about to pull away, only he felt Steve’s hands cup his waist from behind. Then he felt Steve’s lips brush his ear as the all encompassing heat stretched across his back.
“But I’m glad he listened to me. You’ve been an excellent addition to that team.”
Tony paused before the double doors. The building was tall and nicely decorated but didn’t seem over the top. He was surprised Steve thought it reminded him of him.
“Then why?” Steve whispered, sounding heartbroken. “Why did you send them? You never even spoke to me. Not once.”
“Ironman where are you!?”
"Taking out the biggest one. Head towards it and you'll see Carol and Thor flying. I'm on the ground."
“What are you doing-“
“I said stop-“
“Tony? Don’t do this to me, I’m sorry okay?” Steve begs and tears stream down his face as he chokes. “I’m s-sorry.”
“My lord. It’s good to see you.” Tony said, keeping his eyes to the stone floor to allow Ezekiel that divine respect. Ezekiel shifted on his feet and sunk his hand into Tony’s hair gently.
Steve was seated behind it, currently writing something down on one of the pieces of paper with quick movements of his pen. From here, Tony could see the highlights of his blond hair since his head was bent down a little, and could just about make out the finer angle of his clean-shaven jaw. His arm muscles contracted every so often with each new sentence of the pen, and Tony couldn’t help but think back to how strong had always seemed. Tony wasn’t short or small by any means, but Steve had always seemed bigger and stronger, in a way that had always made him feel safe.
As he flipped it open and flicked through, his heart soared. There it was, hidden in the dates.
Slowly he began to walk along the edge of the roof, observing the bystanders smart enough to avoid the abandoned alleys. There were some cars driving by and some small gangs of mummies who preferred the night but nothing extravagant. Nothing he could really use as a distraction.
“Thank god. I was worried you’d break.”
“You know.”
Just like the good old days when they’d sit on the couch and fight over what to watch. Tony could still remember how happy he’d been during those moments and how excited he’d been at the prospect of being so close to Steve.
“Right.” Steve tried to hide his smile.
“I think we’ve just started to solve the problems. The main one being your relationship with Captain America.”
“We’re gonna have problems pal.” Steve lifted up his chin and clicked his knuckles.
No mark yet. Or ever. Just like always. He skin was plain as a sheet. Nothing but scars and false hope.
“What is this about Doctor?”
Surprised, Tony grinned as an image came to his head. Steve bent over a laptop searching desperately for videos of him dancing. Then Steve going away to practice it until he could get it right too.
The blond was staring directly at him. And when Tony shifted, he followed the movement.
The effect was immediate. He let go of Tony like he’d been burned and Tony instantly jumped back, putting a good few feet between them. The werewolf didn’t seem done though, preparing to jump as well.
No one can replace Captain America but they need to move on somehow. Steve is just facilitating that. Was.
It was just him here. No one else. But he remembered vague details of several voices, one of which had been Steve’s for sure. His hand went up to his lips instinctively.
Tony grinned and took off his jacket. Nearly at the common area. “Sure. Thanks Jarvis.”
“It’s not taking advantage if the person wants it more than you do.”
liked Steve.
It reminded Steve of his mother. Seeing Tony like this, it really reminded him of her. Once, after his father had passed away, Steve must’ve been no older than ten when he’d walked into his mother’s room. He could still remember the thick cloying scent in the air. His mother, who he’d never imagined could be brought down by anything, not by something as concealed as biology, had been lying on her bed, sheets torn and turned like the end of a hurricane. Her arm had been thrown over her eyes, sweat creating a sheen over her skin, and her sobs had been so loud, Steve had been certain the neighbors would hear.
They’d unzipped the top half of his uniform and had already scrubbed away and wrapped his torso in several bandages but he there was still so much blood Tony couldn't even see his chest. The helicopter nearby was starting to open its hatch and Tony figured they were getting ready to take Steve up to the Helicarrier for further support.
He shakes his head and turns away. He’s not ready yet. He will be soon, but not yet. When the time comes, he’d rather not be awake. He hopes he’ll be lucky enough to be asleep. And when they find his body, maybe they’ll at least put him to rest.
“I don’t care.”
That was fine. He’d dealt with this before. Hell, it was his life now.
While he was stewing in his thoughts, the lift chimed open and he sauntered into the penthouse, laying the concealed suit flat on the couch. Taking off his blazer and loosening his tie, he dropped them beside it and leaned over his gift to unzip the black bag. As he did, his eyes raked over the sight in awe.
“You’re gonna go for it. Because it’ll help you. And I’m gonna say you should because you know me. You know I won’t go back on my word. I know how important your employees are to you.”
"Y'know I'm not part of Hydra - right? I never will be. I won't. I... won't," said Peter, in a way that was more of a reassurance to himself than a response to the man. His eyes followed the man, who was now picking up a large book, the cover of which was blue and coated in dust.
And this is where part one ends...
"Maybe I am a handful... but she won't leave me after one little thing."
Peter finished the book a few hours later, his eyes stinging as the final words made their way into his mind. He knew he had a somewhat decent memory, but he wasn't sure he'd call it photographic. However at that instance, he hoped he was just being modest.
"Steve? What did they say?"
"And that's it?"
"Yep."
"Oh shut up, Capsicle!"
"I don't wanna go!" the boy yelled, his sneakers scuffing against the marble floor. "You can't make me go!"
"Maybe, and squad? Tony questioned, eyeing his son weirdly.
"My kid promised that he'd call me," Tony said pointedly. "You got a problem, Rogers?"
"Oh," Tony smiled, "That's just the AI I put into your suit."
"What do you mean?"
"Kiddo..."
Tony pondered over that phrase: everything else. What else was Peter referring to? Did he mean the breakup between him and Steve? Or did he mean the spider bite and the powers he had received from it?
"Sure. Once we put out the PR fire, those documents can be amended. I'd file a motion to have you and Wanda reinstated..."
"From a certain point of view..."
"Hydra," Peter interjected.
"I'm 'fraid so, bud."
"You've know me your whole God damn life, Peter, it's not breaking news."
Tony wrapped his arms around Peter, "Have fun, kid."
"Cool..." Peter replied absentmindedly, trying to stay out of the headspace that overcame him every time he saw his Pops. It was nothing personal against the blond- well maybe it was, but it more to do with the tension that surrounded them that started whenever they were left alone together.
"You did fail one... you didn't kill me. You saved me." Steve blinked, holding back the tears. He could picture the moment. He could replay it through his mind. He was injured - in agony, even. Bucky was there, about to land the killing blow. But he hesitated. He didn't kill him. He just watched as the ground gave way and Steve plummeted. Steve could still remember the wave of memories that flooded his pal's face as he realised who he was fighting. As he realised who his mission was.
"Like, five thousand BC," Peter said, looking at ned for confirmation. "So, a long time before the phrase 'Iron Man' was coined."
"For once I agree with you, Cap."
Bucky stepped to the side, allowing the man to come into the room. "Come in... Is it serious?" He was worried. Worried for himself, for Steve, for Peter... What if it was to do with the court trials? What if it was to do with Spider-Man? It was probably just to do with school, he reassured himself, trying to regain his composure.
"Bucky isn't crazy!" Steve blurted suddenly, eyes snapping up to lock with Tony's. It sounded as if he hadn't spoken for hours.
"You're Steve..." Bucky replied, slowly. "I read about you in a museum." Steve quickly realised that Bucky was back to himself yet he didn't have his memories. Stupid Hydra and their stupid mind-wipes.
Hydra.
"Steve."
Sighing, Steve responded, "I'm okay, just a bit worried about what's going on back home."
“I'm not here to judge you. I just want to ask you a few questions. Do you know where you are, James? I can't help you if you don't talk to me, James.”
"W-hy? We lived through it... I was a freakin' mascot for our side... We know what happened," stammered Steve. The Captain was now turning pale, as if a faint coating of white paint had been brushed across him.
As in response to his question, Peter - and the many other things were swiftly flung to the ceiling. The gravity in the room. Gone. "It's remarkable what a reliable source of mining labour will get you, when you lend it out to a billionaire."
Steve sat down on the couch, a plate of avocado on toast in his hand. "Whatcha watching, Buck?" the blond asked, his eyes averting to the television in front of him.
Steve coughed in amusement, "Yeah, yeah, we all know that I still look like a twenty year old." Bucky playfully shoved him, earning himself a grin from the blond.
Peter searched through his memories: trying to remember what dish Vision was mentioning. "Oh... the one with toast, eggs, baked beans - which i remember finding odd - and some other stuff?"
"Do they... do they work?"
* * *
Zemo grinned, placing his hand on Peter's mess of brown hair and combing his cold fingers through the curls. "Oh yes you are, актив/asset... oh yes you are."
* * *
Peter shook his head, closing his eyes in frustration. He wanted to be fine. He wanted to be brave. He wanted to be like his Dad and Pops. But he wasn't anything like them: he was plain, old Peter. Might as well just be Peter, no Stark or Rogers fame. That's all he was... Just Peter. Yes, he thought to himself, that's how he should start referring to himself: Just Peter.
"Pete's."
The Stark raised his eyebrows, taken back slightly by the sudden question. "Uh, yeah... I've worked on a few flying cars. Did one for this guy who really loved his cars, once. Think he named her Lola, or something..."
Steve woke up to find Bucky curled up next to him, his breathing soft and calming. The blond pushed his best friend's hair off of his face, and sighed. This fuzzy feeling overcame him whenever he looked at - or even thought of - Bucky, every time. It wasn't like his love for Tony, which he was sure was slowly dissipating, it was stronger... more real. That worried him, he couldn't be dishonest to Tony, not whilst they were still married: so he'd have to sort it out legally.
Tony laughed, "Of course I would, Petey. You're my star... my sun... my whole live will happily work around you."
Grinning, Zemo pulled out a black pistol from his side. "You're right, we won't kill you. But that doesn't stop us from having a little fun with you - does it?"
"Hello, is this your car out front?" Zemo asked, slyly. He took a few steps towards the Russian, unsure of how easy it would be to gain the intel he needed. "I jumped the curb," he explained, "Maybe we could take care of it ourselves, though. If you wanna call the cops, tha- that's okay too, I guess."
Tony walked down the long hallways, searching for Steve, Peter by his side. The man had walked off, after their last talk. They were quick to find him in a glass office, which happened to overlook the control room.
"Hey..."
"Come on, kid," Clint exclaimed, tugging the teen off of the couch, "Your Dad would skin me alive if you don't finish your work."
"Bye, loser."
"And I still do," the billionaire said with a slight hint of rage in his voice. Yet, he was still keeping his calm relatively well, especially after the amount of 'definitely coffee, nothing stronger' he had consumed between the boardroom and the penthouse.
"And," Tony continued, "You're my son, so of course you're smart."
"Don't be, актив/asset... Hydra will make everything okay."
"The Avengers were formed to make the world a safer place," Steve said, pausing for a moment. "I feel we've done that."
Steve eyed his boyfriend, edging him on towards the billionaire, almost physically shoving him."I'm Bucky," he finally announced, a small smile trying to break through from his expressionless face.
"Well, I love them, Tony exclaimed - ruffling his hands through Peter's hair. "However, I don't think Pops will be able to deal with two Iron Men in this Tower. To be honest, I'm not completely sure how he deals with just one."
"On it, Sir."
"Are gonna fondue?" Steve said, in a slightly more hesitant way than he wanted.
Sharon and Sam both looked at the screen, watching as the two men interacted.
(Probably Enhanced Senses...)
Peter sat upright, rubbing his eyes - blinking rapidly, "Good news or bad news?"
"It wasn't just one thing, Tony. You and I both know that."
"Hydra being the good guys. It's not true. They tried to kill both your parents countless times. They probably even killed your birth ones."
Zemo responded with a sly grin. "He's not exactly innocent though, is he? The powers for one, they increase his healing metabolism."
"Of course, Petey. I'll never stop you from seeing him."
"You see old Spangles and the One-Armed-Wonder making out all the time, why can't I enjoy myself a little?" Tony said, teasing his kid. It was the moments like these, the happy ones, the ones where he could wind up his son, that he never wanted to forget. After everything they had all been through, Pete especially, even the smallest moments were special enough to be savoured.
Peter snarked, "I know I am." In a manner very much similar to Tony's. It made the man laugh, as they continued patrolling the city.
The man at the door smiled. He was clean shaven, his hair gelled to the right. "May I come in? It's about...," he looked over at the picture of Steve and a small child, "Peter."
"What?" Steve asked, taken back slightly. "No, Bucky did... how can you tell?"
"Just call him," Bucky insisted, watching as Steve hesitated outside the Tower. They had been been stood there for fifteen minutes. Luckily the weather wasn't too bad, especially after the cold weather he was used too.
Tony at that point untucked his shirt and waltzed out of the room, ready to head home to Peter. However, one thought kept flashing through his mind: where would Steve be staying? Surely he and Bucky wouldn't be staying at The Hub forever.
"You can't tell Pops. He'll kill me," Peter begged, pulling at the man's shirt. "Please, Bucky, please."
"Right," Bucky muttered, "You've gotta family, we can't..."
Peter's feet skidded against the marble floor as he was led along a hallway. It didn't look like the same one that they had come through yesterday, meaning it hopefully didn't lead to another room filled with torture. But this was the same Hydra his Pops had fought against during the war, so that was very unlikely.
"And how long will the temporary stay last, exactly?" Tony asked, trying his upmost best not to show his emotions. It was something he had mastered, not just from being famous but, from having Howard as his father. Howard had always told him to man up, prove that he was a Stark because: 'Stark men are made of iron.' Any show of weakness made his father mad at him, normally ending with him being punished; to be honest it was the only time Howard really interacted with him, even though it was in a negative way.
Twenty minutes into E.T. Sam and Scott walked in, carrying five closed and one half opened bag of takeout. "You two order these?" Sam asked, through a mouthful of chicken, "A guy outside was ringing the buzzer for ages, before me and Scotty, here, turned up."
* * *
"Who's who?"
Not bothering to question why, Steve did as he was asked. This time, he realised what Tony was so interested in. The ground was making a hollow sound.
"Do you think I'll be alright? You know, at the whole 'being an influence to a child' thing?" Bucky asked worriedly, and Steve chuckled.
Rhodey looked at Sam. "Boom!"
"Bucky, you don't have to do this," choked Peter, trying to get hold of his Pop's boyfriend's attention. He fidgeted but his attempts only left his feeling weaker and even tireder.
"Oh..." Bucky pondered for a second, knowing full well what Spider-Man did every night, normally alongside Iron Man. He had ended up on one of those websites, the first time he had gone on the internet, that was called The Spider-Fan Huh and had read all about him. Despite him being a fairly new hero, he seemed to have a huge fan base.
Laughing, Steve placed the wallet back in his jacket. "He does, doesn't he? We adopted him back after the Battle of New York, against Loki and the Chitauri..." Then, after noticing Bucky's confused expression, he added, "Thor, one of the Avengers - a celestial being - his brother tried to take over Earth. They were from outer space, Buck, and they were evil. It's how the Avengers was formed."
"I'll go get changed then," Peter stated sulkily, but he was stopped by his Dad's grasp on his shoulder: which was forcing him to stop in his tracks.
It rolled in a circle like a metal lid dropped on the ground, making a booming noise on impact and grating noisily for several seconds before Steve put his foot on it.
"Sure," Peter replied, shaking himself from the cuddle. "Love you.."
The teenage boy was still confused: his Pops had said that the meeting - the accords, or whatever he had referred to them as - was going to affect him in a big way. But... what were the accords, exactly? The billionaire had assured him that he would inform him about anything concerning him that had come up in the meeting. However, Peter had doubts that his father would tell him the whole truth.
Tony raised his eyebrows, "What do you mean, Capsicle?"
"Fine," muttered Peter, then as he saw his Dad's hands holding something behind his back, "What is it? Did you finish the suit?"
"Kid, it's half seven," Tony said, an idea forming in his mind. "Do you want me to order in pizza, then we go work down in the labs?"
Peter stopped swinging his legs, breaking eye contact with the glass table. "What do you mean?"
"Wake up, buddy, wake up." Tony's voice was straining; the billionaire was in pain. He couldn't watch his son hurt like this. They needed to get him back to the Tower. He needed private treatment, from a doctor who knew what they were doing. Not from some state hospital - that just wouldn't do for his kid.
"Dad?" Peter asked, "What's wrong?"
"He's also an alcoholic..." Steve continued, "Anyone who's spent a few minutes with him would know what. And he's had a few professions would would be deemed un-right for a father."
“I’d do it again. Every time.”
She scowled and folded her arms. “Don’t play coy with me Stark. You have been busy avoiding us.”
Trish’s eyes turned sharp as ice and she stared at him like her looks could burn.
His whole body hurt. He couldn’t move an inch without crying.
"Sleep Tony." He hears and before long, feels his eyes fall shut and his body loosen. He thinks Steve doesn't look away and silently he prays that this isn't a dream. That either Steve is alive or he is dead. Either one.
“Well I haven’t been Captain America for a long time. I think this job suits me better.” Steve sighed and rubbed at his forehead tiredly. “Even if I don’t leave this room half the time.”
"He asked me to work for Shield." He explained and glanced down at his uniform. It looked a little loose on him now, but maybe that was his imagination. "What are you doing here?"
What he saw, made his heart freeze.
There was a time where he had once been one of the most respected men in all of society. Where he’d stood among some of the greatest men and women of all time. A group of heroes who would risk their lives, day in, day out, just to keep people safe.
The werewolf smiled and nodded his head, clapping his hands. His canines were prominent even from a distance. He looked just as pleased as Tony was and Tony...
“You...you told us we were monsters. You called us killers.” Strange croaks, and behind his hands, Steve sees tears leak down from his eyes. “You said you were better, that you could never do what we have done, and yet...”
Steve had given him a little more blood than he’d needed. It was time to put it to good use.
“Right, sorry!”
“Such a triumph. And I can’t say Norman didn’t enjoy it, did you Norman?”
He could barely remember the last time he’d had an escort take him to the Helicarrier. Usually he’d fly in his armor and finish up the work there before heading home to meet the team.
He went to the first roof he’d spotted Steve from. He didn’t linger or dwell in the shadows this time and he didn’t bother to scope out the blocks.
Tony whipped his head around and glared at Steve instead. “Don’t patronize me.”
When Steve spoke, his voice was low and fragile, like a string about to break. Steve seemed to be struggling with keeping the emotions out of voice, but he tried his best.
Rejection, as it turned out was far worse than unpicked curiosity.
“Where’s Steve?” He asked, fidgeting when the medic placed a device in his ear and waited for it to beep.
Something in Tony warmed at the words. Earlier he’d been a bit stumped by Steve paying for his suit but now that he’d thought about it, he knew it was just a one off. It had been a nice gesture, even if it had caught him off guard.
“Nothing. But you have an appointment at three. Do you know where you’re going?”
“Hey Tony, that’s it. Open your eyes.” Steve said quietly, feeling the first hint of something more. A warmth he hadn’t known since he’d found out Tony had erased his mind. He felt so drained but seeing Tony moving and breathing-
Tonight’s night was a blessing. Tony had badly needed to escape the cavern after his encounter with Whitney. The whole week, she’d practically spent trying to kiss and make up with Zeke, doing everything to point out how right he’d been and how good of a leader he was.
It’s not wrong. She’s being fair to them. Too bad she didn’t have the first hand experience of having her memories wiped by these men. She still trusted them to an extent.
Tony was in the middle of adjusting one of the locks in the face plate. He really didn’t have time for this.
Steve stopped and took a deep breath. Tony’s heart raced but not with fear. It was something else he couldn’t explain.
Tony turns to Rogers and tilts his head curiously. Rogers has settled into a military stance, as if he’s prepared for what Tony’s gonna ask. Like he’s gearing to fight.
“I’ve been sick for some time. I think I’m dying. I don't know for sure but it appeared a few days ago, a-and-"
’, with a picture of a happy looking puppy on the front.
There are some things he’d rather not remember.
“Of course no-“ Tony froze and met the doctors eyes, feeling his throat catch.
Norman hadn’t changed his expression. Only his eyes were dimmed and they seemed full of disgust and pity.
The lead medic nodded encouragingly and continued to check him over. “Good, that’s very good, now four things you can feel.”
He’d fallen to his knees and used the position to press a shaky hand to his waist where the bullet had found its mark. Somehow, the bullet had managed to pierce through his armor, and Tony realized dimly that whatever these bullets were made out of, they were clearly designed for superhumans. How else did they get through the armor?
She was older. A human coming to the end of their life. If he took blood from her, she wouldn’t...
’!?”Tony spluttered, barely able to focus on his flight path for a second.
“That would be the blood loss and anemia kicking in. Please lie down, Mr Stark. Take a deep breath for me.”
“You’re the one who organised it.” Steve retorted and Tony flicked his eyes over the way Steve’s hands were fidgeting over the balcony. “So thank you.”
“Good...I think. It’s extremis.” Tony said with a growing frown and then looked up at Steve in complete awe. “You gave me extremis.”
that word after what they’d just been through.
“Mr. Stark?
“Hey, what is going on!?” Carol says, suddenly barging into the meeting room. Behind her, Maria, Natasha and Sam follow closely in full gear.
Norman met him at the door. He was leaning casually against the iron grates, as impassive as always. Wordlessly he pushed off and opened it, giving Tony the space to walk in. As soon as he stepped inside, the door slammed shut.
His thoughts were cut short when they entered the inside of the Helicarrier flight hanger. Through their, they crossed the mostly empty hangar (except for a few fighter planes) and reached the elevator at the end. Maria still had her mini-army of Shield agents but they waited for him to enter before clogging up the lift. With a single scan of Maria’s palm, the elevator began to descend. It was probably the most painfully awkward elevator ride he’d ever had in his life.
Slowly, he climbed in too, pushing past the net to join Steve in sitting inside the large square ball pit. It was pretty big considering Steve and Tony could actually fully seat themselves without touching each other at. It also seemed kinda cosy.
“No.” Tony repeated and shook his head slowly. “I won’t. I’m not Ironman anymore.”
Now he was apparently working with them full time. And he was on this team as Ironman.
“I’m sorry.” Tony whispered and bit his lip hard enough to split it. The harsh taste of copper and iron was enough to keep him awake. “I’m sorry I left you. I’m sorry I hurt you-“
“Like what you see?” Steve smirked and suddenly Tony was pulled out of his trance. Steve’s eyes were laughing but he allowed Tony a moment to collect himself. Or look.
. I won’t do it.”
“How do you think I get here so fast?”
For just a fraction of a second, Tony noticed Steve’s gaze lock onto him instantly. Like an instinctive response, Steve looked suddenly more alert and like he was about to face something extreme.
“Goodbye Shellhead.”
“Oh no, that would be me. Ben’s the main spokesperson for the team, but I’m the actual head of the department. I assign everyone with the tasks here.” Tyler smiled, and Tony felt his shoulders loosen. He couldn’t believe his luck honestly. He’d thought Ben would run the place for sure.
Zeke smiled softly and turned away. But then he paused a swung back round.
changed.
“Don’t worry about it.” Steve says and presses a kiss to his lips which Tony enjoys. “Just focus on recovering. It'll come with time.”
Not on the mission. But on the man he had feelings for of course.
Tony couldn’t accept. He didn’t deserve that.
“Here.” Steve says as he wraps it around Tony and the baby. “Is that comfortable? How are you feeling?”
“I can’t thank you enough for this meeting. I know things have been busy, what with being a CEO of such a great company.”
“Yes. Until then.”
“This is Anthony Stane. My loyal and trusted pet. He’s done everything he can to support the faction.” Zeke praised making Tony’s hair stand on end. He sounded like he was making a sales pitch like the ones his father used to make.
"The commander sent you a notification." Ben said quietly, and started to tap at the tablet, bringing it closer to read. "Says-"
“You will be granted a kinder sentence if you comply. Should we survive this by some miracle, you all will be put on some form of probation. Do you understand?”
Jeremy was obviously better boyfriend material. And with any luck, he’d make a better boyfriend altogether.
The white bandages around his waist were prominent. Easy as it was to forget around Steve, he was still injured and he needed to be careful otherwise he'd pull his stitches.
Or maybe he just liked the human contact. It had been months after all since anyone had even spoken to him properly. Steve holding him was like being able to sink into a mattress and relax.
“If you dare hurt him while I’m away, I’ll skin you alive.” Steve swears and this time there’s no growling, just Steve making his promise.
"You don't want that-"
He made his way to his bedroom without a sound. Empty corridors were all he was surrounded by. He was getting used to it.
“How’s that killing spree of yours going? You know, the one you warned me about?” Steve chirped behind him, making Tony jump back with a cry.
“Fine! I can distract it! You go for the back!”
“He is.” Fury said, inclining his head a little his way.
“Sure thing.” Tony smiled, feeling a little lighter as he stood. Just as he turned, Gabe grabbed his arm and beckoned him closer.
Steve had delivered that.
"I'm sorry I didn't say anything that day. I should've said-"
likes Steve. Steve makes him happy.
“You hate me don’t you?” Steve suddenly said, sounding extremely upset and wow, okay, that wasn’t what-
“Now go on then.” Gabe said vehemently and Tony frowned.
"I'm going to take your uniform off. Is that okay?"
“Come with me. I wanna show you something.”
“That’s strange. Do they have someone with a sharp nose? You’re usually so careful my lord.” Tony pondered, giving Zeke a small smile when the pureblood glanced at him.
It almost made Tony want to step back.
Steve looks devastated. His hair is ruffled and greasy, and his clothes look wrinkled like they haven’t been changed for days. Worse than that, there a traces of dampness on his cheeks that reflect off the light when Steve pulls away.
“But you said- “Tony clamped his mouth shut the second he realized what he’d been about to say. Sadly, Steve caught onto it and didn’t let it go.
The door swung open, revealing Tony’s worst fear.
“Steve.” Carol murmurs beside him and he knows she’s noticed the same thing he had. The three men had flinched at the words.
"She's a kid."
* * *
"One... Freight Car. Soldier?"
Nine hours later, Steve walked down into the lab, only to find Tony frantically running around the messy room. He looked at his husband with concern. The billionaire looked a state: his hair was sticking up all over the place, there were dark bags underneath his eyes. He appeared to have been down there all day, researching or experimenting or doing whatever Tony Stark does. "Tones, you need to get some sleep," the soldier stated, hoping to get through to him.
