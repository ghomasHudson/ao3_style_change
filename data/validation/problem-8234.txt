“That was Tony Stark! And he waved at me!” The student loudly exclaimed to his group of friends.
Tony looked at him with an interested expression. “Could what, Steve?”
Steve nodded back at Clint before facing Tony again. “Is this something we can talk about later tonight after we disarm this thing?” He smiled as he rubbed Tony’s other arm.
Tony’s eyebrows raised, completely surprised that Steve was talking about him while also being out on a date with someone else. It made no sense, but something about it made him feel like maybe Steve cared about him still.
Tony waited for Sam to finish his conversation before walking over toward him. He patted Sam on the shoulder.
Anyway, please stay well. :)
“Please, I would like for you to meet a few of Stark Industries’ board members!” Thor chuckled before pulling him over to a group of people. Steve went along, but he wanted to crawl into a hole and die.
Steve inhaled then exhaled as he turned the coffee mug he was holding around in his hands. He was leaning up against a counter.
Both Steve and Thor nodded.
As soon as the door closed behind him, Thanos motioned toward his daughters with a grin.
“You’re welcomed to use it. I’m sure he wouldn’t mind.”
Tony nodded slowly. “Yeah, that sounds great, actually…I..er…we miss you too, Steve.”
Loki shook his head as he bumped into the console behind him. “I’m not…he cut ties with me a long time ago…but it wasn’t just me with the lab explosion…”
“N-no…uh, w-what do you mean?” Steve tried his best not to sound utterly perplexed and horrified by whatever he might have done.
Fury uncrossed his arms to rest his hands on his hips. Tony turned slightly to watch Steve lean forward to rest his elbows on the table.
Peter clapped his hands together, excited about making pizza from scratch. Tony nodded yet he seemed skeptical of the idea.
Tony laughed as he stretched. “I can sleep it off later.” He smiled at Steve who reciprocated the expression although he was also exhausted from the night before.
Steve nodded as he waited for Tony to continue.
Would it be okay if I invited Tony over for dinner tonight?
Given the tense situation, Steve couldn’t help but laugh; something about Tony’s personality shone through the uneasiness in their relationship.
“It’s a minor security breech. The agents from S.H.I.E.L.D. handled it as effectively as possible.” Tony responded with reassurance which seemed to ease the board member.
“Yes, if they keep this up!”
Steve nodded as he looked downward at the tablet with Tony. “Lupho and Whoberis? Do their names sound familiar to you at all?”
Tony couldn’t believe what he was hearing, but he was unable to contribute anything intelligent.
Steve’s face flushed a little but then he reached over to grab the lube from the table drawer, managing to do so without toppling over. As soon as Steve retrieved the tube of lube, he looked at Tony then the tube. Tony laughed as he took the tube from Steve, squirting some lube onto his hand before doing the same to Steve. He grinned upward at Steve before reaching down to rub the lube on Steve’s cock. Steve moaned and nearly fell over on top of Tony from the sensation.
“You want to spend your whole
“Steve!” The sudden rise in Tony’s tone hushed everyone immediately, “Synergy is dangerous!”
education? Middleton?”
“Tony…” Steve stepped further into the lab, “…we can get through this. This is just a minor setback…”
Both Gamora and Nebula looked at each other, both signaling to the other that they had wished their father had sent them an email instead of calling them to his office to only remain coy concerning any concrete information for their plans.
He moaned some more from Tony touching him, his body pressing downward more into Tony as their cocks rubbed up against each other. Tony looked downward between himself and Steve, freeing himself and then Steve, feeling their naked cocks slide up against each other without missing a moment.
Steve nodded once more with determination. “Yes.”
Tony’s voice had grown quieter. He was crossing his arms, looking stern, but his expression managed to retain some softness. Steve tried to calm himself down as he listened to Tony.
Tony held onto Steve tighter, commanding himself to take it easy. Steve barely noticed as he continued to kiss him, taking his time.
Obadiah ignored again him as he calmly continued. “They would still like to have a private event to assuage investors. The timing of this is inconvenient at best. Thank god no one else was hurt.”
“I don’t know. Why don’t you break up with Natasha, don’t speak to her for a year, ask her to rejoin Synergy then ask me how
“I’m sorry I have to leave so early. But I’ll see you later this week. Happy Birthday.” Pepper leaned toward Steve to hug him, and Steve smiled as he hugged her back. Pepper looked back at Tony, waving before exiting the kitchen.
“Tony, you
“…uh…um…” Ned squeaked, perhaps too bashful around Steve to really answer.
Bruce patted Tony on the back. “Tony—”
Bruce only had to wait less than a second to receive a reply from Tony.
Steve grimaced; he also believed he should have been in the meeting but figured Tony had handled himself fine.
Steve turned the tablet around to see instructions for inputting figures into the Synergy device.
Steve sighed, but he was relieved that he wouldn’t have to lie to Tony about May answering the phone. “We’re fine…I’m just calling…” he glanced at the bedroom door, “…I’m just calling to see how Peter’s doing…”
Tony scrunched up his face; he had no idea why his relationship with Pepper had anything to do with Steve attending the event with him. He was now becoming more uncomfortable; something about the question felt like it was leading toward a conversation he wasn't calm enough to have.
“Obie.” Tony nodded at Obadiah, looking the other way as he sipped out of his drink. He smiled like usual, but something about it felt off to Steve.
“Sir,” J.A.R.V.I.S. called suddenly, “you have mail.”
Steve laughed as he unwrapped the tiny box, opening it to find what appeared to be his dog tags but they looked brand new.
Obie, wasn’t it?” He finally broke away from Steve, marching up to Loki, “he was the one who let you into the building and the lab, didn’t he?”
“Uh, that meeting at 10am is the one with the executive committee to talk about you and me…” Tony explained quietly.
“Peter’s better about this now…” Tony locked the door, “…but I should probably lock the door just in case he barges into the bathroom.”
However, Steve managed not only to be there for him, but also tried to calm him through the situation. That had to mean that Steve—
Steve sighed. It was nice of Sam to prepare for good news, but it could have easily been bad news. Which probably would have been easier to swallow with champagne.
Tony looked upward at Strange and smiled weakly. He appreciated the reassurance, but then his personality took over, trying his best to change the subject.
Steve smiled as he watched Tony and Peter then debate each other over what they should have for dinner even though Tony had already planned out their meal. The three of them regrouped to settle down for dinner; Peter talk about his day as Steve and Tony found little moments during each break to discuss the press event.
Tony nodded, swallowing a lump in his throat before quickly walking to front door, opening it and then nearly slamming it behind him as he ran to his car, trying to calm down so he could drive.
Steve pulled a blanket over his head, sighed, before flinging the covers away. He swung his legs over the side of the bed as he looked around for his jeans from last night. He looked over at Tony who was in the process of trying to make himself look more presentable.
“Nice to meet you, Sharon.”
Steve watched Tony’s expression change slightly before he finally smiled somewhat. He nodded as he hopped of his stool before walking to the counter.
“Look, Rogers. I’m sorry, but I’m more than a
Steve shook his head defiantly as he watched Tony walk toward him. “It’s not about the money, Tony. Synergy can save lives, that’s what it should be used for. Think of the damage you’ll be adding to if you let the board hand Synergy over to—”
Tony mused as he smiled upward at Steve, but then he began to feel that weird pain in his chest again. Tony coughed as he disengaged himself from Steve, walking back over to his desk, trying to remain as calm as possible.
“Good morning, Mr. Rogers.” J.A.R.V.I.S. greeted as soon as Steve entered. He watched Tony turned to acknowledge him with a smile. A version of “Les Boréades” was playing softly throughout the space.
He looked up at Steve again who appeared to be waiting for him to contribute. Tony sighed as he placed his glass on the counter behind him.
Tony sat up more in the bed. “Uh, that one’s supposed to be me. Iron Man.”
Steve laughed again, which prompted a soft expression from Tony. “I’ll see you tomorrow?” Steve asked.
Steve kept his arms crossed, but now his expression was coy. “You could probably figure out what I like to do in my free time? That sounds a little stalkerish.”
Loki erupted with laughter again, but Natasha stopped him by slapping the back of his head again.
“You are so fucking sexy, baby…” Tony whispered as Steve began grinding faster and harder against his body.
Steve felt terrible that their relationship had gotten to this boiling point. He cared about Tony, and that was before anything he was feeling romantically. He wished they could get back to working as a team.
Obadiah directed his anger toward Fury who was standing in the back of the room with his arms crossed.
Steve marched down the corridor until he reached Tony’s lab. He could see Tony standing near one of the consoles with his hands on his hips and his head hanging low. Steve waited before barging in. He could either cause further friction with his lab mate or let it go. He knew something had been bothering him, but it also wasn’t right for Tony to lose his cool.
Tony groaned to himself. He knew he would probably run into Bucky again at the hospital but figured he would also be with Sam.
Tony’s mouth popped opened slightly, looking quite surprised, before he broke out into an uproarious laughter which caused Steve’s face to turn even more red.
“Steve! You’re awake!” Tony instinctively reached out for Steve, rising from his chair to give him a hug, but Steve winced as he moved toward him.
“You can chill with the pleasantries, Thanos,” Tony responded curtly as he stood across the table from Thanos, “we know what you’re up to, and we know you’ve been using Stark Industries employees to do whatever the hell you’re trying to do. Tell us where this fucking super weapon is.”
After another minute of lengthy internal grousing about Steve, Tony marched to his bedroom. He tried to sleep, but he kept tossing and turning all night, thinking constantly about the letter out in the kitchen.
“I’m just interested in your life,
Tony and Steve barely spoke to one another as the private jet carried them from the west coast back to New York, landing in Queens at the undisclosed location Tony was storing his unmarked gadgets. They spoke even less as Tony drove them back to Stark Tower, and the tension was at an all-time high as soon as they arrived back to their lab, just in time to get a few more working hours in before calling it a day.
Obadiah looked around the room as his expression changed. He then chuckled, his whole body shaking from his witless humor.
Steve smiled before removing his hand. “Great.”
Steve nodded as he took his time entering the kitchen. He watched Tony looked through one box then another.
Tony crossed his arms as he listened; he knew that if Steve wasn’t on the team, he probably would have disbanded the project without further debate. Although not too concerned about his own safety, Tony was concerned about others, especially his team, despite what people perceived about him.
Tony sighed as he turned his head away from Steve. “I should probably get ready…should take a shower to clean up from last night.” He grinned with a wink at Steve.
“What do you think?” He asked quietly. Steve was sure he almost didn’t hear him.
Tony stepped closer toward Steve, placing his hands on his arms before rubbing gently.
And it was obvious that Tony had struck a cord with Steve; the object of Tony’s ire/affection was now cycling through a variety of expressions before settling on one that looked remorseful.
Shuri nodded. “Only if I get to interview properly.”
“…I know someone or multiple people at Stark Industries are helping him. That’s the only way he’ll get away with this, but…” Tony cut himself off.
Steve could barely form a single word, let alone a simple sentence, he was so humiliated.
Bruce shook his head again as he turned to face the group directly. “We embedded new scaling configurations into this newest version of the reactor…so long story short, it’ll let the device emit a reactionary blast if compromised before self-destructing as a last resort, but we’re having trouble trying to control the extent of the possible damage…the original schematics aren’t entirely helpful…so we can’t do much without completing the installation of the newest safeguards. The core keeps the device stable enough to use it for its original purpose, but as we’ve seen in the past…”
“Bruce should ask her.” Peter beamed at Bruce, who only shielded his face with his hand. Tony laughed hysterically.
Nebula scrunched up her face, already annoyed. “What?”
Natasha approached the window looking into Clint’s hospital room. She could see Clint sitting up in his bed, talking with his wife, Laura, while their kids played in a corner.
“Let’s get out of here, Cap. We’re due to try out that new place down the street.” Sam made a shooing motion toward Steve to get him to hurry up. Steve complied as he shook his head but then effortlessly drained his beer before tossing the bottle into the bin, which landed perfectly in the middle. Steve shrugged when Sam groaned again.
Tony placed a hand on Steve’s before rubbing it. He turned his head somewhat. “Thanks, Rogers, but we got it handled. Right, Parker?”
He laughed again as he turned to face Steve. “I don’t know why.
Steve smiled as Tony rose from the bed to find his shirt. Not so long after, both were in one of Tony’s classic cars on the way to Brooklyn. They rode silently for a while, chatting once or twice about Peter, but Tony was somewhat dazed by what had just happened between the two of them to fully articulate a thoughtful comment.
Tony hugged her back. “Thanks, Pep.”
Tony hummed to himself as he filed through his emails, deleting spam and flagging what seemed to be the most important to read later. He read along the list until he found what looked to be early morning spam; the message contained an interesting, yet incomprehensible subject line.
A moment or so passed as Tony stared at him. Steve stared back, too petrified to explain himself. Then, Tony suddenly cracked the most unnerving smile Steve had ever witnessed. He watched Tony saunter over toward the bedroom window.
Peter nodded quickly. “Yeah, Steve. It’s fine.” He looked up at Tony who was nodding back at Steve.
“Tony gives me a
Tony immediately noticed Loki as he crammed himself into the huddle. “Loki! Long time, no see!” He practically shouted, shaking Loki’s hand vigorously. To Steve, Tony sounded like he was already tipsy.
Tony pointed his thumb toward Peter as he smirked at Bruce. “See? Out of the mouths of babes.”
What was so nerve racking about texting Steve? Sure, Tony had come to terms with the fact that he thought his new lab partner was super sexy, but he had never been this awkward around anyone before. The only people who made him feel small and marginal were his dad and Obie, and he guessed now Pepper. But those were for personal reasons, not that he didn’t possess even a modicum of
Steve groaned. He wanted to get out of the suit as quickly as possible.
worst fucking time to say this to you, but I’ve been trying to tell you this since we talked earlier…”
“Thanks for watching him for me, Pep. I owe you one.”
Tony waited a bit as he continued to grin, motioning with his hands to get the crowd to calm down.
“I think maybe around 5? We’re getting an introduction to the project then a tour of the facilities.” Steve answered before sipping his beer.
Tony chuckled as he threw his hands up in surrender. “Okay, okay, just making sure we’re not stepping on any toes…”
Bruce nodded slowly as he shuffled around awkwardly. “I’ll mention something—just that I told you. I won’t make a big deal out of it.”
“Sam, come on. What if he had walked in on me?” Steve huffed as he used too much soap, splashing water everywhere from how intense he was washing.
“J.A.R.V.I.S., lights.” Tony called, sitting on the edge of the bed. He sighed loudly to himself before yanking his tie off.
Tony watched Steve’s chest rise and fall with assistance from the ventilator. Tony wiped his eyes as he watched Steve, thinking about the first time they had used the Synergy device together. He waited, now thinking he should try to catch up on work before taking a break to read to Steve.
"Okay, I'll see you tonight…"
They began to eat, talking about nothing really until Tony remembered that he had made plans with Pepper for the following weekend. A strange feeling overtook him; he wasn’t sure if he should say anything to Steve.
“How long do we need him?” Gamora inquired, absolutely exasperated.
“I know you wouldn’t, Tony…” He responded quietly, placing both hands on Tony’s face before kissing him.
“Hello.” Steve murmured, raising a hand to wave slightly. He immediately shoved it back into his slacks to avoid looking silly.
Steve moaned quietly as he continued to press down into Tony’s body, shifting to the side for a second as Tony managed to pull his pants down more. Steve turned onto his back to pull his pants off as Tony did the same; they reached for each other as soon as they were just in their boxers, now vigorously rubbing up against each other.
“Sorry, Fury’s orders!” Tony was practically outside of the lab as he shouted back.
Steve watched Obadiah watch Tony cross the balcony. The older man sneered before turning toward Steve again. Steve felt like leaving too, but he didn’t want to make a huge scene.
Thor stared at Loki before shaking his head. “Please be honest with me, Loki…please.”
Steve shrugged. “Maybe. Or he was having a bad day. I don’t actually know so I can’t really speculate.” Although Tony’s behavior had been irritating, Steve decided to give the man the benefit of the doubt. He often gave others the benefit of the doubt; it was something he had learned to do while in the army, but his natural disposition leant toward it.
Tony waved a hand around as he motioned toward Bruce to be careful.
T’Challa clapped his hands together. “There will be a dinner for everyone to meet later this evening, but feel free to explore the resort before then.”
different story!”
Tony waited for Bruce to respond; the anticipation was killing him.
Steve panicked, looking around the living room quickly before rushing toward the foyer to get to the elevator.
Peter nodded. “Okay, that’s fair.”
“Okay, Rogers. Favorite movie.”
“It’s more than that Buck,” Steve straightened up, “I really don’t want to get into it, but Tony had a rough time growing up…and I should have talked to him instead of going behind his back…”
Tony put his hands on Steve’s shoulders to get him to hold up. “…I know I already said this, but…thanks for being here…with me…”
“Keep going, baby.” Tony whispered with a smile, referring to Steve touching himself.
“Tony, I have it. Just slow down. It’s just a simulation.” Steve countered.
Thor broke away from Steve and Bruce. “No! I’m not going anywhere!”
As soon as Steve finished inputting the sequences, the device generated the information for the codes they needed to enter into the vault’s access panel, but the numbers were a jumbled mess.
Tony laughed as he continued against Steve, grinding faster and harder until he couldn’t last any longer. He groaned loudly as he released himself all over Steve’s chest. Steve came soon after, holding onto Tony as he touched himself.
Despite the new revelations concerning Dr. Selvig’s arrest, per Tony’s requests, everyone went about their normal tasks as usual, including attending the board event scheduled that weekend. However, everyone was still anxious about the stability of the project and whether they would be able to find Loki before an event similar to the precinct explosion unfortunately reoccurred.
“Another loss. When did you get so smart?” Tony hugged Peter as the latter bounced around in his lap.
Thor stared blankly at Loki. “I do not understand.”
Rhodey sighed deeply, glancing at Tony before turning to face the whole room. “My superiors are not happy that the explosion leaked to the press…” he took in another deep breath as he clasped his hands together, “…I know you all did the best that you could…but Synergy is too dangerous for the government to justify picking it up as a program…”
After a second or so, Steve reached for some tissues next to the bed, handing one to Tony. Tony grinned as he accepted the tissue.
Tony moaned from the comment and feeling Steve. He kissed him back; he could feel that Steve cared about him, but Tony couldn’t be that honest with his feelings just yet. Maybe he needed to give it more time before telling Steve that he was in love with him and wanted to adopt more kids.
Steve nodded as he reached down Tony’s body, feeling Tony’s hard cock before rubbing more vigorously. Tony chuckled as he shook his head.
Steve nodded, approaching Tony slowly. “I know how important this is to you, Tony, so I’ll do whatever you need me to do…I care about you.” He offered quietly, finally meeting Tony.
Both Tony and Steve looked at each other as Tony tapped on his earpiece. “We’re on our way.” He answered in time with Steve letting go of him before jogging out of the office. Tony grabbed his tablet on his desk before quickly following Steve.
Exhaling with relief, Tony slammed back down into the bed, but he groaned in pain as his body made contact. He looked down at his right arm, which was covered in bandages before craning his neck to look back at Steve.
“Uh, thanks…?” Steve answered, half smiling from the comment, yet clearly confused by it.
“…well…ugh…actually he could probably be better…” Tony laughed lightly as he rubbed the back of his head, “you’ll get to see him at the party…I’ll make sure before he leaves with May…he’s staying over at her place this weekend…”
Lupho handed Whoberis a tablet before crossing her arms. “It’s a deal. But we’ll need to get started on this soon.” Lupho responded.
“Tony…” Steve tried pulling Tony down to meet him face to face but stopped as a current of pain shot through his arm. Tony laughed again as he leaned downward to meet Steve.
He propped himself up with an elbow as he looked back at Tony who had his eyes closed, still rocking his hips upward. Steve’s eyes travel down Tony’s body; he was completely mesmerized. He took his time, telling himself to take it easy, before wrapping a hand around the base of Tony’s cock again, squeezing gently. He used his other hand to rub Tony’s hip as he situated himself into a more comfortable position.
Yes, Steve admitted he was attracted to Tony, but sleeping together? Steve hadn’t even processed his feelings that far. And to add insult to injury, Obadiah’s allegation made it seem as if Tony was still living up to his playboy image by sleeping around with everything in sight. Surprisingly, that angered Steve the most. Tony had his moments, but Steve felt like he could trust him.
Steve nodded back before he turned around to walk to a console, but he still felt sick to his stomach and wanted to avoid looking dejected in front of Bruce.
Steve could feel his face turn red as he rested his hands on his hips. “I think they might be a little too flashy.”
“Gotcha, Tony.” Bruce responded.
“Got it.” Natasha said through her earpiece.
Tony nodded as he took a sip out of his glass. “Yep, that sounds about right. The Colonel here is probably a better rep than me for this thing.”
Steve nodded, still looking a little worried. “We have to do the…thing...now?” He waved his hand aimlessly at the device.
Tony entered the code as delicately as possible before sprinting out of the basement then the building to help the rest of the team clear the area for the blast radius.
“Tony. You
Steve rarely lost his cool, but the environment and Tony’s behavior was bugging the crap out of him.
And sure, Tony was brash and harsh at times, but it didn’t really bother Steve. He was planning to give his lab partner a chance before writing him off just based on first impressions.
Both Rhodey and Pepper were aware that Tony was secretly working on a new Synergy device, but they weren’t aware of the specifics, most notably the location of Stark Enterprises in case the operation was compromised and they could deny culpability. Also, T’Challa had agreed to finance Tony’s new project considering that he still firmly believed in the original purpose of Synergy.
Soon after, everyone else except Tony began debating with each other over how best to proceed sustaining an attack from Thanos. As the cacophony of voices rose, Tony felt like his head was on the precipice of splitting in two while his chest felt like it was close to imploding.
“Thanos worked for me for about a year…we caught him using company equipment trying to build some sort of a weapon…but nothing I’ve ever been contracted to build…something more…diabolical, I guess…let’s just say, nothing a military couldn’t use without being charged with a war crime…”
“Little bit higher.” Rhodey repeated.
Steve decided to not ruminate on it as he switched the conversation back to the promotional tour which appeared to return Tony to his normal disposition.
Having Loki arrested was supposed to be a distraction. However, somehow the agents at S.H.I.E.L.D. managed to figure out that Dr. Selvig had also been involved.
Steve turned off the television with a remote before hearing the rest of Obadiah’s charges. He had been visiting Tony in the hospital as often as he could since the explosion.
Tony chuckled. “Fuck, baby. I had no idea you were so into this…”
He stared at the letter before whisking himself and his dinner plate to his home office to finish working. Later that evening, he passed one of the openings to the kitchen to get to the master bedroom. He stopped to look at the letter which was still sitting on top of the island.
Steve stared at Tony before resting his hands on his hips. “It was fine.”
“Sir, you—”
Steve chuckled. “It’s okay. But thank you.” He smiled before giving Tony a hug.
Several moments passed as the bathroom was filled with the sounds of splashing water and Steve and Tony moaning in unison. Steve smacked Tony’s ass, which stunned Tony but only for a moment. Tony grinned as he humped Steve who squeezed his body with both hands.
Tony shook his head as he ran a hand through his hair a few times. “Nope, I just took my lunch break a little early.”
Tony scrunched up his face, thinking quickly before placing his hands on his hips. He tapped his foot a few times before looking back and forth.
Tony sneered. “Well
“Oh, I am
Meanwhile, Steve had waited to ask Tony about dinner until they were alone in the lab; he knew it was super last minute, but he was hoping Tony would say yes.
Tony nodded, holding onto Steve’s arms, looking away as Steve gave him a firm hug before finally letting go. Tony cleared his throat and straightened his clothes out as Steve smiled at him before turning to walk over to a worktable.
“Tony?” Tony heard Steve repeat once more behind him.
“First, please don’t
“Uh…” Sam looked at Bucky who was coughing loudly before looking back at Steve, squinting his eyes in disbelief, “is, uh, Sharon busy…or something…?”
Steve nodded and straightened up slightly which prompted a coy smile from Tony. “There it is.”
Bruce sighed again, shaking his head. “I don’t think that’s a good idea. If Tony’s right and the missing link in this whole thing is Obadiah, who knows if those two are still working with him.”
Steve jumped out of his chair, swinging the office door open before jogging past his interns until he was at the entrance of the building. He threw open the door, looking down both sides of the sidewalk until he saw Tony getting inside his car with Happy sitting in the driver’s seat.
“…can we please get back to work? We got things to do, Banner.” Tony sighed before launching his body out of the chair, appearing as if he didn’t just have a heartfelt conversation over someone he knew he was in love with but was still too afraid to admit.
“Tony!” Steve tried through a half-whisper.
“Just say it.” Steve griped.
Tony sighed loud enough for Obadiah to get the point, looking directly at him before resuming packing.
Tony gave in and crack a smile as he grabbed Steve’s hand. He let Steve pull him up to sit next to him on the bed, but Tony made sure to stay near the edge.
Obadiah took a moment before sighing with relief. “Okay, great.”
Tony’s stomach lurched…
He then walked back toward his apartment, dropping his keys a few times before he finally reached the door. He turned back around and waved once more before closing the door.
“Tony? You…can’t be serious…” Tony felt Steve yank his hand away from his grip. He finally opened his eyes to see Steve sitting up straight in his chair with his hands on his thighs. He locked eyes with Steve and couldn’t look away; Steve’s gaze was intense and captivating, although it hurt to experience it.
Loki stared at Thor for what felt like an eternity before breaking out into a high-pitched maniacal laughter, shaking the tiny café table with him. Eventually his laughter subsided as he stared off, looking at nothing again.
“As you can see, as one of my esteemed colleagues describes it, the device itself is both lightweight
Steve smiled, but he was sure he was blushing ridiculously. It had only been recent since Tony had started calling him “baby”. And Steve couldn’t help from turning pink every single time.
“Thanks, Rhodey.”
Tony gave himself some more encourage, nodding to himself, becoming more confident with his plan to get Steve back.
“Nope, sorry. Can’t do it.”
“Ladies and gentlemen. We have an important update regarding Stark Industries’ Synergy project.”
Tony had turned his body around to face Peter. He had one arm on the island countertop. “Good start, Parker…hmmm…” he began, “…I’m going to go with the IBM 360.”
He used two fingers to zoom in, too focused on what he was doing. His other hand accidentally bumped a folder that contained some of his older photos, automatically displaying the photo he had taken of himself and Steve at Steve’s law school graduation.
Bucky shook his head. “You told him, after having sex the night before, that you wanted to be friends? Damn, Cap.”
“Wow, this is so awesome!” Riri responded as she continued to swirl around the image.
Tony rolled his eyes. He had spent the entire weekend after the party rehashing every single move he had made up until almost confessing to Steve that he also loved him and wanted to start over. However, needless to say, he felt too embarrassed and upset by the way he reacted and to losing Steve to really talk about what happened at the party.
Tony looked downward so that Steve couldn’t see that he was blushing from the comment. “Uh, well,” he cleared his throat again as the tingling sensation in the middle of his chest reappeared.
would be the one stuck in a love triangle?”
“Loki! This will be easier for you if you come with us quietly!” Steve shouted over the music.
Tony felt like crawling into a hole. That was the stupidest thing he had ever said.
Steve’s face flushed; he turned his head away, but nodded.
Steve kept smiling, but then he looked slightly away from Tony.
“Loki, why would you do this?” Thor’s expression softened as he tried to understand his brother’s actions.
“Steve!” Tony exclaimed in terror, “the weapon! Roosevelt Island! Thanos!” He tried to get out of bed, but he was still hooked up to the machines that were keeping him stable.
“Rogers, I was half joking about sharing the shower, but I’m glad to do so anyway.”
Tony half grimaced, but he only crossed his arms before shuffling around a little, feeling uncomfortable while trying to figure out how to escape the balcony without resorting to scaling the walls.
Tony stopped them both before walking through the archway that opened into the space. He squeezed Steve’s arm, but not too hard.
“What are you planning to do?” Steve asked, watching Tony file through the information.
Natasha nodded sternly as she pulled up on the controls. They hovered near the island as Tony went to the back to look at the Synergy device with Bruce on his tablet.
He sighed with a dramatic eye roll. “Steve talks about you
Tony sat up in the bed, laughing loudly. He hopped off it before walking to the bathroom. “I’m going to wash off, wanna join me?” He asked, smirking at Steve.
Steve smiled as he crouched down to be at eye level with Peter. “I’m picking you up today. Is that okay?” He asked, not really sure what to say to Peter without sounding overly forward.
“—Dr. Banner, I’m sorry, but this doesn’t really concern you.” Steve nearly added in time with Tony.
Steve shook his head as he backed away from Bucky, but he persisted. “I mean, I’ll admit I had issues with Tony in the beginning...but I see that you two care about each other. I can tell that you’re both supposed to be together, Cap…”
Tony grumbled as he snatched the tablet away from Bruce. “What about the style, Banner? You
But before he could respond, Tony interrupted him by calling over to Thor. “Hey, Thor!” He reached out over the table to grab his glass. “Pour Rogers—” he looked down at his glass as he struggled to remember what the cocktail was called, “whatever this is!”
this time…? He cringed, definitely feeling ridiculous.
“So, why didn’t you tell me about you and Tony, Steve?”
Clint had suggested that the team meet for drinks at a cocktail bar that was a few blocks down the street from Stark Tower. Ever since entering the bar, Tony had been trying to figure out the best way to approach Steve and talk nonchalantly like he was typically prone to, but for some reason had forgotten how.
“H-hey, Rogers…” Tony kept backing away until Steve stopped about a foot in front of him.
Tony shook his head again, turning to face Steve. “It’s okay,” he began as he sighed once more. He reached out to caress Steve behind the ear. “Thank you for offering though, baby.”
Steve nodded, hugging the pillow next to him as he gasped a few times. He lifted his body as Tony placed a pillow underneath him.
“Fuck.” Tony whined, letting Steve flip him over onto his back as he tried to free Steve from his pants.
Steve nodded back returning the expression. “Sounds good.” He then looked around awkwardly before spinning around to exit the room without saying goodbye to Tony.
“What would make you say that, Tony?”
After some moments of silent hyperventilating, Tony took his time rising to his feet. He slowly walked back to the bathroom door, slowly opening it to see Steve sitting on the edge of the bed, leaning forward on his thighs with his hands clasped together.
As everyone final settled, Tony took in a deep breath, closing his eyes for quick second. He leaned forward, interlacing his hands on top the table surface.
They shuffled around a bit, both trying to get a hold of the other from how ravenous the kiss between them had become. As Steve massaged Tony’s back, Tony remembered they were still in the employee express elevator. He reluctantly pushed away from Steve but was still holding on to him, prompting a whiny noise from Steve.
Tony moaned again as Steve pushed downward into his body, using both hands to rub along his sides and his waist. Tony pushed upward into Steve as Steve’s hand squeezed his waist before migrating down nearer to Tony’s cock, which had been growing harder with Steve’s every movement. Tony gasped as he felt Steve rub him, taking his time as they kissed each other. Tony placed both hands on Steve’s shoulders before drawing one arm around his back to hold him close.
Steve pushed downward even more before moving a hand to slip underneath the band of Tony’s briefs. He pulled the fabric down before doing the same with his own, rubbing Tony with his body.
Steve laughed as the three of them clinked their glasses together. Sam and Bucky began to debate one another over which part of the presentation they like the most while Steve sipped out of his glass, still watching Tony.
“Yes…the same floor with the device. No—but close enough…excellent…and he won’t be much of a problem…”
As with his comment about how great Steve’s massages felt, Tony felt comfortable enough in their relationship to make such an off-color joke.
He thought maybe he could have a conversation with Tony about the way he had acted the night before but was afraid that the conversation would escalate beyond repair. He was also afraid he might beg Tony if they could get back together, but Tony’s actions suggested that he wasn’t willing to seriously commit, especially after trying to make a move on Steve while he was seeing someone else.
“Good, you’re both here.” She said as she entered.
Steve leaned against the door, listening for the shower to turn on before turning the door handle to discover that Tony hadn’t locked the door. Steve smiled as he pushed the door open, finding Tony in the shower humming loudly to himself.
“Steve Rogers,” Tony smiled a little wider as he felt the sensation in his chest again, “will you marry me?”
The mocking comment bristled Bruce who only shrugged in frustration as he turned in his chair to look at Fury who looked almost as angry as Tony.
Bucky was standing on top of the portable airstairs to one of T’Challa’s private planes, calling down to Sam and Steve as they walked toward the aircraft.
Steve opened his eyes and observed an unrestrained Tony, doubled over clenching his sides. Steve stared, incredulous, as he waited for Tony to regain control over himself. Eventually, Tony slapped his hands on the table in front of him as if the table were holding him up from the uproarious bout of laughter.
Steve’s smile brightened as it widened. The last month or so had been like this between him and Tony.
the plan.” He offered curtly before spinning around to continue toward the testing room.
“…there are just some things I…need to figure out…okay…? Tony added without looking back at Steve.
Tony looked at Steve intently. “I supposed that could be a possibility. I wouldn’t put it past Obie to work with someone so shady.”
Steve shook his head. “No, but I’ve been checking on him before coming to see you since you’ve been here. Actually, Peter stayed over at my place last night and we played board games with Bucky all night.”
“Oh,” Steve appeared suddenly in the kitchen, “I’m sorry for interrupting…” He waved his hands around before turning to exit the space.
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve remained in the lab, debilitated. He could see Tony marching down the hallway through the glass façade.
Steve walked up to Tony, putting a hand on his shoulder before joining him to see what he was working on at the console.
As the song wound down, Tony stood up and bowed theatrically. He motioned toward the band before walking toward Steve.
Bucky ignored him as he walked further into the suite. “Wow, the couple suites
“Ah!” Steve yelped, letting go of Tony before rolling to the other side of the bed as soon as J.A.R.V.I.S.’s voice materialized out of nowhere.
As Tony explained how the suits were also temperature controlled, Steve took his time approaching him from behind. Steve inhaled then exhaled deeply as he slowly rubbed Tony’s arms from behind.
Obadiah was chatting loudly with one of Stark Industries more important investors. They had met early that morning at Stark Tower to discuss financial business. Ever since the fate of Synergy became even more uncertain, Obadiah had been calling and meeting with investors to convince them to support bidding for open contracts.
“What about that time I needed you to go with me to the west coast for that tech conference and you stayed out late with Happy and Rhodey the night before we were supposed to leave? You ended up missing the flight by an hour and I had to spend the weekend by myself because you decided to work in the lab rather than catch another flight.”
Steve shook his head a few times. “Thanks, but I should be getting home.”
I know things are difficult if you or someone close to you lives in a country hit hardest by COVID-19. And I know you're reading fanfiction to escape, so I'll keep this short: I wanted to thank every single one of you for reading/commenting on this. :) I live in the US and my family lives in Washington State (the state with the first outbreaks). I attend Columbia University in New York which moved online, but I live in Philadelphia so I've been stuck in my apartment with my boyfriend and my cat. Writing this story is really my only escape at the moment, so I just wanted you all to know that I'm going to keep writing and posting. It gives me absolute joy! :D
“…but it’s probably nothing.” Tony waved his statement off. He looked down at his half-empty drink, moping over his feelings for Steve. He sighed before switching the conversation to recent lab experiments.
Steve smiled up at Tony before closing both eyes again. “Are monitoring my baths now?”
Bruce’s breath hitched as soon as he saw Natasha already sitting at their table in the restaurant. She looked more beautiful than he had ever seen her, and he had no idea that was physically possible.
Steve nodded, although he felt apprehensive. He looked downward at his notes once more, clearing his throat a few times.
Tony cried to himself as he placed his head in between his knees. He stayed like this before turning slightly to look at the side of the bed Steve used to sleep on when they were dating.
Considering their history of miscommunication, Steve thought maybe giving Tony some space would lead to some form of closure, but it never came. As Steve mentally filed through the things they said and did to one another, he had come to the conclusion that while their relationship wasn’t perfect, being with Tony was great. Well, seemingly to Steve anyway.
“Whoa, hold up a minute, Rogers. I asked
Soon after, Tony’s penthouse was filled with laughter and music. He had invited his close friends and their significant others, a few business associates, some board members that he genuinely liked, and some other Stark Industries employees. The party was a one off, just something Tony wanted to have for some needed levity as Synergy was being officially closed down.
“Hey!” Sam waved at the trio as they approached, “we’re setting off soon!”
Tony let out a ragged sigh before shutting his eyes close, pleading he wouldn’t have another nightmare.
He thought he had made the right decision, but now that decision seemed like another mistake. He wanted to be with Steve, but then he remembered how he had treated Pepper and everyone else. He didn’t want that to happen to Steve.
“All right. Everyone in position?”
“That’s right. Stark Industries’ newest tech, the Synergy Device, is making
Steve sighed. “A few, a couple. Does it really make a difference?”
“Aren’t you the one who always says you’re not ‘Queen Bay’ famous?”
And indeed, the question had paralyzed Tony. As he slowly turned away from the counter, Tony told himself to remain cool, but hearing that Steve and Bucky were moving in together began to bother him.
Tony laughed. He was at war with himself over whether to bring up the morning after the party but decided not to; he didn’t want to ruin the moment.
Tony laughed again as he looked slightly upward at Steve. “Yes,
reading that.” Tony complained out loud.
Tony reminded himself.
The guard nodded before reaching out for the package, but the carrier refused to hand it over. “Uh, better let me take it up to him,” the carrier explained, “it’s
Tony waved his hands around theatrically. “Yada, yada, yada—bureaucratic nonsense—something like that.”
“I, uh, should have Fury send S.H.I.E.L.D. agents to Stark Tower in the offices and labs at Stark Industries…and of course at May’s…” Tony’s voice cracked as he thought about trying to keep Peter safe from all of this.
He then rolled over onto his back, smiling up at the ceiling, thinking about the way Steve felt on top of him. He looked at his phone before placing it on the bedside table. He returned to looking up at the ceiling, too excited to sleep. Tony then turned over onto his side to grab his phone.
Steve nodded as he went back to stroking Tony’s cheek. “Okay, let’s get some sleep then.” He smiled before settling next to Tony. He wrapped one arm around Tony to draw him against his body, feeling himself exhausted as he slowly drifted off to sleep.
Along with her own advice, Tony immediately recognized the words Rhodey had offered him a while back.
Steve sighed to himself again, thinking that his assistant was referring to Bucky who usually took some of the interns out to lunch whenever he visited the office. They were on a deadline for a major case and Steve needed everyone to work through lunch to prep.
He rubbed the back of his neck and tried to steady himself. He wasn’t sure how his conversation with Obadiah would affect Tony; he was trying his best not to get involved with the intercompany political war between Obadiah and Tony. But Tony was his teammate and Steve thought he deserved to know that Obadiah might be spreading lies about him.
“You guys did a great job.” Steve smiled as he reached over to rub Tony’s arm.
Obadiah wore a broad, satisfied grin on his face as he waited for the press pool to settle. He straightened out his suit jacket before resting his hands on the podium in front of him, waiting to give his speech.
Bruce settled in the couch. “Speaking of which, I’m not fun.”
Steve laughed again as he sat up in the tub, watching Tony run back over. As soon as Tony was within reach, Steve grabbed him by the waist, positioning him on top of his body. Tony held onto Steve as his body went under water, his top half out of the water against Steve’s. Tony wrapped both arms around Steve’s shoulders and both gasped as their bodies rubbed up against each other. Tony attacked Steve with a flurry of kisses as he humped Steve’s body. He gripped onto Steve harder than usual from how intense the feeling was but Steve barely noticed as he held onto Tony tighter, using both hands to squeeze Tony’s ass and guide it along his body.
Peter held the spoon out for Tony to taste. “It’s soupy like you said.”
Same 😊
For a moment, they remained like this before Tony turned his head slightly to kiss Steve as best as he could. Steve hugged Tony against his body to kiss him before Tony turned around fully to wrap his hands around Steve’s neck, pulling him in for a kiss. Steve kissed Tony back before turning him over onto his back, fully unbuttoning his shirt, pulling it off before making his way down the length of Tony’s body.
Peter’s friend nodded shyly as he tried to shake Steve’s hand. “…hi, Steve…I’m Ned.”
to get caught, okay, Rogers?” Tony smirked at Steve before walking over to another console.
Suddenly, a flood of tears released themselves as Tony laid down reaching out for the pillow Steve would have been sleeping on if they were still together. He hugged it against his body, too upset to really calm down, and too upset to really sleep. So, Tony just laid in the bed, crying for Steve the rest of the night.
“Mr. Rogers!” Obadiah shouted as he wedged himself between Natasha and Bruce, “so glad to see that you are well.”
Bucky nodded as he finally let go of Steve. “Well, maybe this is your chance. You guys should talk.”
Tony nodded as he let Steve lead him out of the kitchen and back out onto the balcony.
Tony repositioned his body to rest a leg on the cushion in front of Steve. He fidgeted a little as he ran a hand through his hair.
“…and! This should give us more leeway when replicating whichever gadget we need…”
Tony chuckled. “Pep!”
Clint, standing in between Natasha and Thor, peeped a small, surprised noise before staring directly at Tony. Everyone else in the room shuffled around awkwardly trying to avoid eye contact with Tony.
Steve nodded as he turned to the side to kiss Tony again. He reached out a hand to caress his cheek before turning back onto his back.
Steve laughed as he followed him. “Only makes sense that we’re on the same schedule.”
As soon as they reached the scene, Steve and Tony jumped out of the vehicle. They set themselves up somewhere near the crash but with enough space to generate specs for the equipment.
“Hey, Tony. How did it go?” Bruce turned away from the console he was working at to address Tony.
“Tony?” Steve whispered softly as he approached the opening to the balcony. He looked downward to find Tony reclining on the furniture, fully awake.
Tony groaned as he ran a hand through his hair a few times before shrugging. He shuffled back and forth on his feet, trying to decide on what to say next: should he apologize? But then he wouldn’t find out the truth about Steve and Bucky because he knew Steve was keeping something from him. There was no way Steve was this nice and reasonable.
Finally after Pepper made sure to remind Tony that he needed to mingle with some investors, Tony was able to free himself from his friends, making a beeline for one of the bar counters that was less frequented. He asked the bartender for a glass of water before leaning against the counter, trying not to look like he was about to have a heart attack.
Steve nodded again. “Right, of course. Do I need to do anything?”
Tony felt too overwhelmed to try to escape, now expecting Sharon to also mention that she knew that he and Steve used to date. He waited and waited as Sharon continued speaking, until it became clear that she had no idea that he and Steve had been in a serious relationship.
“Yeah, I figured. It could have been a lot worse. But Steve seems like the type who’ll adjust to anything.”
Tony stared at the draft before deleting the entire message.
Steve closed the diary as he felt his stomach summersault a few times. He placed the diary next to him on the bed as he tried to process what he should do next. Being in the house was affecting Tony more than he could comprehend so Steve told himself that they would need to unpack boxes as quickly as possible so they could leave before Tony had another emotional breakdown.
probably expect that.” Tony swung his legs off the side of the table, kicking them back and forth as he looked back at Steve.
“Ugh, I need this coffee to focus on some work I need to finish before the week starts…” Tony groaned as he settled in his seat.
team blabbed to the press, Stane.”
Steve wondered.
“You were going to ask me if Steve and Bucky are dating, right? They’re not, not to my knowledge anyway. And I don’t think they ever have. Steve treats him like a brother than anything else. Also, Steve…” Sam trailed off a bit, but Tony picked up on it.
Tony slid the image toward Steve who looked confused by what to do. “It’s like using a smartphone or a tablet. Just fiddle around with it with your fingers.” Steve watched Tony make a few motions with his fingers.
Steve grinned before motioning for Tony to follow him. Tony returned the expression and followed before he realized that Steve was leading him to his bedroom. He stopped short at the threshold and panicked.
Fury turned to face the console again, resting his hands on his hips. “Get some agents out there right now. I’m going with them.”
Pepper caressed the underside of Tony’s palm. He could feel his heart aching, but it was finally good to hear why Pepper had left, although it made him feel worse. He told himself to push through the pain in order to salvage whatever relationship he could have with Pepper in the future.
Obadiah shook his head, "I'm not talking about whether or not Mr. Rogers is well enough to attend the event this evening."
Tony sighed as he placed his hands on his hips. He could hear Steve’s steady breathing.
After some time passed, they came upon a winding driveway and a property covered with trees that had been orderly planted. Steve could see through the tress that the driveway led to a nicely sized, Modern house set quite a ways away from the main road. The driveway was unusable; the current owner was repaving it to restore it to the version it had been when Tony was a kid.
Steve only nodded but remained silent; he wasn’t sure what to say without sounding like a total idiot. Now he felt extremely silly and was sure he wasn’t hiding it well, but either Tony wasn’t aware or chose to ignore it.
Steve thought to himself.
Steve chuckled. “Sounds like a plan.”
“What’s up?” Tony answered still facing a projection of the Synergy device above his console.
“Rhodes, how did you get into my office?” Tony dropped his work bag on the floor as he slouched into his chair.
.” He said with a grin.
Steve barely responded as he carefully stacked the papers to the side to retrieve the diary. Tony continued to give instructions as Steve stood up with the diary, carrying it over to the kitchen for Tony to assess.
Tony rushed toward Steve again, stopping short. “He probably wrote whatever’s in that diary keeping in mind that someone will probably write a book or movie script about him in the future.” Tony threw his hands up in the air before placing them on his waist. He sighed deeply, looking downward at the ground.
Steve heard Sam shuffle into the kitchen and head straight for the fridge. He turned around to watch his friend then shuffle over to the table, nearly knocking himself over as he plopped down in a chair with a sandwich.
Tony laughed nervously as he finally let go of Steve. “I thought a salad would be the easiest thing to contribute to a meal that will be no doubt delicious.” He grinned at Steve.
Tony took his time rejoining Steve at the island, and they ate for some time before Steve took a moment to speak up.
However, Thor didn’t care. What was important was uncovering what Thanos was up to and the Synergy team needed all the help they could get.
Peter and Tony nodded, smiling back at Steve in such in unnerving way that made him cringe, but he brushed it off, knowing that it was no use in pushing the matter any further. Steve shook his head as he opened the door to leave the lab, looking back at Tony and Peter as he walked down the corridor to the elevator.
Silence reared itself again as both Steve and Tony tried to focus on the mission, but both were incredibly confused by their awkward conversation in the lab. In the helicopter, Tony maneuvered them away from the Tower as they headed toward the precinct.
“Steve…” Tony whispered as he let Steve hug him close to his body before scooting the two of them up the bed to lie completely flat, with Tony now on top of Steve.
It was the middle of another workday at Stark Industries. Both Tony and Steve were hanging out in their lab; Pink Floyd’s “Brain Damage” was playing in the background on low volume from a playlist Tony had created in college.
Steve couldn’t stop his face from expressing terror as he clearly heard the invisible quotation marks around the word “friend”.
Tony thought to himself but grinned to mask how confused he felt by Steve’s behavior.
Tony groaned before getting out the bed to head to the bathroom. “I know it’s from Steve. That’s why I’m not reading it.”
Tony chuckled as Rhodey looked back and forth between them, making it obvious that Steve and Tony’s shameless flirting was too saccharine for him to handle.
Peter banged on it a few times, perhaps a habit he had picked up from watching Tony work in his lab over the years. Peter then walked around the robot a few times, his head bobbing up and down as he scanned for any faults in the robot’s circuity before turning around with a thumbs up at his dad. Tony reciprocated the gesture as Peter ran back over to stand next to him.
Rhodey nodded. “Well, do you want him around?”
“Of course. Nice chatting with you.” Steve reached out his hand toward Obadiah who shook it firmly, but before letting go, Obadiah leaned in closer toward Steve, lowering his voice to a full whisper.
“…I would like to announce that Stark Industries is…,” but before he could continue, Obadiah felt someone brushed up against him to stand next to him on the podium. He stopped speaking to see that Pepper was now standing on the podium.
Thanos scoffed. “Loki tampering the device wasn’t part of the plan. He doesn’t have the grace that Dr. Selvig has with the device, hence the unnecessary lab explosion.”
Thanos grinned as he stepped back from the object in front of him. He was standing in a makeshift lab in an abandoned warehouse, surrounded by a couple people wearing white lab coats. Thanos produced a device from his inside coat pocket before aiming it at the object, tapping the surface a few times.
Bruce clammed up at once. He readjusted his glasses before answering. “…we haven’t settled on a date yet, because of all the commotion, but probably next week. The week after at the latest…”
Steve nodded as he looked away from Tony, sighing. “I’m only about to agree with you because it hurts to do anything else.”
Steve looked away, embarrassed that Tony’s comment made him blush even though he was still irritated with his behavior.
But before Steve could finish, Thor kicked the door handle, causing the door to fly open, taking part of the door frame with it. In the room were several people, including Loki, sitting on couches and futons, staring at the commotion.
Steve nodded, leaning in to kiss Tony before lying down next to him. “Of course, Tony.” He then hugged Tony against his body as they drifted off to sleep.
Steve eyed them both, making it clear that he didn’t believe them in the slightest bit. The standoff between the three lingered on for a moment or so before Steve finally backed down with a sigh.
“Well, I was a little embarrassed to say the least…” Steve sorely confessed.
Steve sighed. “I’m not going to press it…” Steve waited as he wondered if he should continue, “…it sounds like Tony’s got a lot going on.”
Steve smirked. “—had
Steve grabbed a towel to cover himself. He took a deep breath before turning to face Tony.
Steve bucked upwards into Tony’s mouth, now feeling ready to give in. He ran a hand through Tony’s hair, looking down to see that Tony was rubbing himself while he sucked his cock.
Tony smirked. “As if you had any doubt, Rogers.” He retrieved his phone from his pants pocket to look through a few emails as the boys continued working on their robot.
Tony clapped his hands together to indicate he was ready to move on to the labs. “Okay, let’s roll out, gang.”
Tony had to prevent himself from losing his shit with jubilation, but Sam saved him.
Tony turned away from Steve, sighing as he rested his hands on his hips. Steve waited bit a longer before continuing, now watching Tony finally put on something to wear.
doesn’t feel right. There’s more to it than just inside help, but I can’t quite put my finger on it.” He sighed heavily once more.
“Ah, nice of you to join us, Stark. And
“If you really cared about Steve, you wouldn’t have let some explosion in
Steve limped to the side of the bed he usually slept on, removing his shirt and his pajama pants before carefully sliding into the bed. Tony watched Steve undress before doing the same. As he met Steve’s body, Steve reached out to draw him in.
Steve looked up from the tablet to acknowledge Tony.
Pepper smiled as she pressed the number for the lobby.
Steve then guided Tony and Peter into the apartment building and up to the unit. They settled in the kitchen talking about the week as Steve finished plating dinner.
…but…in both of those movies, the couple splits up by the end.” He reminded Steve.
“…if more than half the things I’ve learned today are things Tony doesn’t know, then he has to wear the mask of shame.”
Natasha and Clint were dancing down below the balcony with the rest of the couples. Natasha discretely tapped on her earpiece.
Peter let go of Steve. “Could we have pizza?”
“Weren’t you the one who gave me a hard time about the failsafe, Rogers?” Tony asked, making sure to convey to him that he was only teasing, yet curious to hear Steve explain himself.
Tony rested a hand behind Steve’s neck. He used his thumb to caress behind Steve’s ear. “Yes, I
Steve turned around to acknowledge Bruce who then walked up to the console to fiddle around with the image of the Synergy device. Steve watched him pull the device apart. Bruce then zoomed into one of the pieces, running a scan. Both men studied the data has it raced up the screen.
“Hmmm, just happier…” It sounded like Peter had sensed Tony’s uneasiness and attempted to correct himself as much as possible.
Tony rolled his eyes. “I said
Tony managed to contain much of his excitement for his friend to himself as he listened to Rhodey have an incredibly boring conversation with a board member who still didn’t understand Synergy's purpose.
Tony scoffed. “I don’t know. Your grasp on popular culture is, well, suspect, at best.”
Steve kept stroking, taking his time replacing his hand with his mouth. He licked Tony as he took him in slowly, using his hand to stroke the base of Tony’s cock as he sucked.
“…how…did the specs turn out?” Tony still had his back toward Steve as he entered. His voice sounded stressed.
Natasha nodded as she watched Clint sallow his medicine. Her expression turned determined as she thought about Clint’s observation.
Tony breathed deeply as he pulled the diary out of the desk, turning it over a few times. As he slowly cracked it open to the first page, Tony recognized almost immediately the date of his nineteenth birthday.
“Really, Tony? That’s really no one’s business.” Bruce returned to eating. Tony sensed Bruce’s anxiety and decided to give him a break.
“Yep, will do, Cap.” He answered meekly.
Subject: CONFIDENTIAL
“Sir,” J.A.R.V.I.S. began, “you have a meeting with the Synergy team in a few minutes.”
“Are you telling me you want to suck my cock, Rogers?” He asked through a smirk.
Steve laughed. “This sounds like a serious game.”
Steve blushed, but before the conversation could go any further, Clint was in the front of the den at the karaoke machine. He had begun singing the first lines to The Rolling Stone’s “Wild Horses”. Natasha smiled at Steve before she motioned for him to join everyone as they sang along with Clint. Steve settled next to Sam who had been talking to Thor, spotting Tony hanging onto Bruce, both singing along way too loudly. Natasha walked over to stand next Bruce; they looked at each other, both half-smiling at the other before focusing on Clint’s passionate performance.
Yeah Steve was cute whenever Tony “accidentally” or on purpose touched him. Even more cute whenever anyone complimented him. Tony had long picked up on that one personality quirk of Steve’s and ran with it. Their first field assignment gave him the opportunity to tease Steve about it, basically on the brink of explicit flirtation. When he had commented on Steve’s penchant for blushing, Steve hadn’t seem turned off by it at all. Actually—but Tony wasn’t entirely sure—Steve seemed kind of into it.
Tony smiled shyly but then he grinned to mask his exposure. “You sure you’re speaking to the right Tony?”
The end of the receiver went silent before May responded. “Steve, Tony’s a good dad, I just wish he would believe it himself…he calls…a lot when they’re apart…he’s done it less since he started seeing you, though…”
“What? You want me to text or call you right away whenever something happens?”
Although being with Steve had managed to stave off any recurring nightmare about the night his parents died, Tony was still worried that he would end up having a nightmare soon while sleeping with Steve. Tony dreaded the thought; although Steve seemed willing to take him as he was and he did tell him some personal things about his dad, although not all of it, Tony was concerned that Steve would actually leave him if he knew everything.
Tony wondered to himself, debating whether he should even open the email whose subject line read: “PLEASE READ! THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING YOU'LL EVER READ!”
“Steve, how many times do I have to remind you that I’ve been around the block a few times?” Tony had meant for the statement to sound lighthearted, but it didn’t play well with Steve who let go of him before straightening up. Tony made a whiny noise because obviously the mood was possibly ruined.
stupid. He did come all the way to Brooklyn to talk to you, Cap.” He chuckled as he jabbed Steve in the side a few times, but Steve barely responded.
“But…what do you
“And remember when you told me about that time you nearly destroyed the house out on the Hamptons for a high school project?”
Tony shook his head; he got up from his desk to greet Steve at the door.
“Steve, I really appreciate that, but please don’t beat yourself up over it,” Tony freed a hand to point toward himself, “it was my fault, okay?”
Sam shuffled back and forth on his feet. “At this design expo thing…I didn’t realize who Shuri was until we had dinner.” He added meekly.
As he approached the stairs to the basement, Tony looked around cautiously before producing two neatly folded head flashlights from his pocket for himself and Steve. He waved behind him for Steve to follow as they slowly descended the stairs, single file.
Tony took another moment before resting his hands on his hips.
Obadiah nodded quickly again as he watched Gamora follow Nebula. Gamora closed the door to the penthouse, waiting a moment before joining her sister. She then pulled out her phone before looking through her sent messages, finding the list of sequences she had sent Tony a while back.
Clint slapped Steve on the back, but not too hard. “You’re going to fit in nicely, Rogers. I can tell Nat and Fury like you and they don’t like anyone.”
“…what if we, tried…” Tony shrugged as he moved his hand inward across Steve’s thigh toward his crotch, “maybe—”
“Tony…,” he whispered into the pillow he was clenching.
Steve closed his eyes shut, reminding himself to relax. He felt Tony feel from the outside before slowly pushing inward, prompting Steve to moan right on cue.
Steve’s body relaxed as he let Tony touch him. He finally felt his body melt into the mattress as Tony took it as a sign to push in further. Steve moaned loudly as Tony went in slowly before speeding up. He pushed up against Steve.
“…please prepare for takeoff in a few minutes…the flight should only last thirty minutes…”
“Not only is it physically possible, it’s
Tony slapped the edge of the countertop as he pretended to be upset that the score was now even. He pointed at Steve.
Steve sighed to himself as he turned on the lights to his office. He took every free, non-work moment before the workday officially began as he strolled to his desk, placing his workbag in its usual spot on the floor next to his desk before slumping down into his chair.
what I asked, Strange.”
“The security tapes were doctored…and…Loki set the explosive up at the precinct?” Pepper gasped.
“Steve, stop!” Tony wiggled around in Steve’s grasp. He could tell that although Steve was trying to get him to stay, he would let him go if he was truly serious.
Steve smiled at the two of them, signaling that he knew Tony was just giving him a hard time, before setting off to find Peter, leaving Tony and Sharon alone. Tony looked around, trying to escape but Sharon kept smiling at him.
.” Tony mimicked Steve with a coy grin before Steve could finish.
Steve took a deep breath before turning to the first page. The date was marked “May 29, 1989.” Steve instantly recognized that the entry had been written on Tony’s birthday, a couple years before Howard and Maria died.
Tony stared Steve as his mouth bobbed open a few times with disbelief. “Uh, you’re not upset?”
Tony inhaled sharply as he felt Steve unzip his pants, pulling them downward as he felt Tony through the fabric of his briefs. Tony pushed upward in Steve’s hand as his cock hardened with every stroke. Tony closed his eyes as he felt Steve pull down his briefs, feeling Steve’s hand against his skin.
Tony shook his head a few times. “No,
“Of course, Cap.” Sam nearly added in time.
But before Hammer could confirm, Tony had jumped up from the table, whipping out his phone from his pocket as he headed toward the exit.
“Hopefully not too much of a distraction.” Steve teased.
Steve’s facial expression grew even more concerned. His brow crinkled with indignation as he approached the stairs to confront Tony.
Steve nodded as he approached Tony again. “Let me know how I can help, okay?” This time Steve kept his hands to himself, probably sensing that he was making Tony uncomfortable.
Steve nodded as he reached over to rub Tony’s back. “This was really nice of you, Peter. Thank you so much.”
popular. I’ve never seen Peter so excited to see someone before.” Tony added.
Tony leaned on his forearms against the railing of the balcony, staring down at the cityscape.
“Hey! What the hell are you doing?” Tony demanded as he entered the lab.
Tony frantically chopped an onion into perfectly sliced rings before throwing it onto a serving plate.
“Remember to take it easy, Peter.” Tony called.
Tony squirmed as he laughed. “Ask me to suck my cock.”
And to add to his weird mix of emotions, also about a month ago, Steve had started seeing someone new, Sharon Carter; a fellow lawyer stationed at the main public defender’s office in Manhattan. They had only been out to dinner a few times; nothing physical had happened between the two considering Steve was still trying to get over Tony. Even still, spending time with Sharon was a nice respite from brooding over Tony. However, and even though Steve would never say it out loud to anyone, he sorely missed Tony.
Steve swallowed a lump in his throat as he nodded back again. He wasn’t sure if he should try to explain the situation. Of course, he was interested, but he also didn’t want his friends to think he was just sleeping around.
Tony smiled before reaching over to caress Steve’s side. “It’ll be easy for you to peek if I finger you first then make you come later…” He looked down the length of Steve’s body before looking directly at him. Steve’s eyes widened as he only nodded.
Steve stood in place as he watched Tony march away from him. He was tempted to follow, but figured it was probably best to give him some space.
Tony nodded back, trying to smile. “Why don’t you change out of your pajamas? We’re supposed to go to the park later with May, right?”
“Uh, Tony?” Peter backed behind Tony who was too amazed by the robot, “should we turn it off now?”
“Hey, Rogers.” Tony stopped a couple of feet in front of Steve.
“Fuck, Steve.” Tony let Steve flip them around so that Steve was now on top, holding back Tony’s legs as he fucked him.
As soon as the meeting arrived at a logical end point, Tony quickly gathered up his things before marching out of the conference room. Pepper followed him, managing to catch up with him at the private express elevator.
“Hi, Tony.” Steve made a move to walk out into the space, but then he stopped short.
“J.A.R.V.I.S. is Tony’s computer system. I thought he was just programmed to the lab.” Steve explained casually.
Bruce nodded, sighing as he removed his eyeglasses. “You know, Steve…I’m trying to stay out of it…but for what it’s worth…I thought you and Tony were great together…I always told him that…”
Rhodey chuckled nervously as he straightened up in the booth. “Yes, Tone. How many people do we know who go by the name ‘Pepper’?”
As soon as the group exited the room, and was at a safe distance, they all broke out into a sprint to get back to the landing pad, finding Clint and Thor standing near a helicopter with Natasha already in the cockpit.
“Speech!” Another voice followed up.
“…after we raided Thanos’s lab…” Fury began, slowly facing the group once more, “I noticed that something was off about the coordinates…but it didn’t dawn on me until we found the chemical traces that someone still working for Thanos had sent the coordinates…”
He then spun around away from Steve to get back to his console, still holding onto the diary.
Usually whenever Rhodey was in town, he would take turns with Peter’s aunt in watching Peter when the nine-year old wasn’t busy with school or any extracurricular activities. Although Tony really appreciated the commitment his friends put in to helping him raise Peter, he noticed that sometimes he would venture into helicopter-parent territory if he hadn’t received an update in a while. The feeling had grown significantly worse after the reappearance of his nightmare. It wasn’t as if he didn’t trust his friends, quite the contrary; he just didn’t know what he would do if he ever lost Peter. His own life was chaotic, but at least he could start over with Peter.
Rhodey nodded but he smiled at Tony. “Yeah, I’m fine…uh, so…would you be weird if I asked Pepper out on a date?”
“Sure. I can be there in less than an hour.”
Tony groaned loudly. “No, but—”
Tony nodded. “Yeah…I mean it’s not like we’re doing anything else…”
Tony looked up at Bruce, his face twisting into a skeptical expression. “Very funny, Banner.”
Tony took a moment before faking a smile. “I’m having dinner with Rogers, so you need to ask Romanov out.” Tony smirked, yet nearly doubling over from the weird feeling about Steve.
Fury nodded sternly before motioning for his agents to file out. Tony turned to Bruce and Shuri. “Banner and Shuri, I need you with me at Stark Enterprises. We’ll get the device up and running as the rest of you grab your safety suits and head out to the island with Fury’s agents.”
“Come in.” Tony called, leaning back in his chair with another sigh.
The three of them went silent before Bucky spoke up again. “Let’s get out of here,” he sat down at the table, “it’ll get your mind off this fight with Tony. You’ll probably have a clear head after.” He tried, clearly grimacing from his own comment.
we have footage of you attacking Barton.”
Steve waited to say his lines as images depicting scenarios the device could be used in projected onto screen behind them.
Tony kissed him as he continued to rub; his mind locked on the feeling of Tony in his mouth. Steve felt his body giving in as he gasped once more, groaning as his body speed up its pace. He groaned again as he finally let go, staying on top of Tony, panting somewhat before sliding to lie on his side. He felt Tony run a hand through his hair.
Rhodey blinked a few times, confused by Tony’s change in attitude. “What, Tone?”
“Tony! Steve!” Peter motioned for his dads before hiding behind a stand with Ned.
“Then make sure you do that after you make me some coffee, my dearest.” Tony shifted around to lie on his back, patting Peter on the leg.
“Rogers. There’s no time. You need to move quickly.” Tony’s voice sounded gruff and harsh. He sounded like he had earlier in the morning, but now there was no doubt to the tone in his voice.
After some time, Tony finally calmed down, but all he could think about was how angry Steve was with him. He waited for some time, making sure Steve was out of view before talking to a few people, but before he could completely relax, Sam settled next to him.
Tony let relief and self-gratification with his new invention wash over him, but before he could really appreciate how well Steve took to dancing and how well the device seemed to work, his lips were meet instantly with Steve’s. Tony had to prevent his eyes from widening with shock as Steve squeezed his body as he kissed him.
Tony nodded a couple times, counting to himself in his head. He thought maybe he should talk to Steve about the upcoming trip to the Hamptons because surely that was the reason why he was overly emotional.
Tony then cautiously walked toward Steve before stopping short. Steve felt like moving backward, but he was still hyper aware of possibly offending Tony.
However, Steve smiled back, fully thinking that everything between the two of them was back to normal now.
Tony nodded as he stepped to the side to let Steve in. “Uh, Peter’s over at a friend’s house…” He said as Steve walked into the foyer.
Silence hung once more in the air as unmistakable tension resurfaced between the two. Tony watched Steve mentally battle with himself before coming up with a good excuse. He sighed before taking a breath.
Shuri nodded before turning to face Steve. “I’ll see you at rehearsal, Steve.” She said with a smile.
Tony turned to Steve. His face was mere inches away. “Yeah, Your-mun-gandur, Rogers.” He pointed over his shoulder with his thumb at Thor as he severely mispronounced Jörmungandr.
Steve stayed still before rising from his bike. He sighed, reminding himself that what he was doing was for Synergy and not Tony, before walking into the warehouse. Steve walked pass the main space, seeing Shuri and Bruce working on the Synergy device. He waved at them before proceeding to the space he shared with Tony.
Bruce nodded. Tony could tell that he wanted to ask for more detail, but eventually let it go. Tony knew that if he told any of his friends that Steve had told him that he loved him and he didn’t say it back, they would give him a lecture about his relationship patterns, and Tony didn’t have the mental capacity to deal with that and Synergy.
A weird giggle escaped Tony before he gradually broke away from Steve. He quarter turned to gather himself.
Steve rolled his eyes as he slid underneath the sheets to lie next to Tony. “Because last time I saw you, you reeked like you hadn’t seen a bar of soap in a week.”
“I live here, but I don’t drive here, Tony,” Peter started, annoyed with Tony already giving him such a hard time, “that’s why I need to practice.” He sighed as he inched the car forward and backward, trying to get close to the curb, but was still quite a ways away from it.
Both Clint and Thor looked crestfallen over not being able to interrogate Dr. Selvig and Loki further.
Bruce laughed nervously as a waitress came up to their table to write down their drink orders. After the waitress left, Bruce and Natasha chatted for a bit. Ignoring Tony’s advice, Bruce tried to bring up work as a distraction from his nerves, but Natasha effortlessly maneuvered the conversation toward something more personal.
“Great first day, am I right?” Clint grinned at Shuri who was standing next to Bruce. He seemed wholly unbothered that the team was witnessing his assault on tape.
“What were you going to say?" Tony's voice continued to raise, "that he was
Peter looked away as he hung his head low. “…I got on top one of the stools…”
“Not for us,” Shuri laughed, “Sam said the same thing.”
Tony shook his head as he walked toward Steve. “Steve—”
Tony's face betrayed how annoyed he already was with the conversation, but figured Pepper was not too far away, so he decided to play along to prevent a frustrating start to their meeting. Besides, since Synergy was in such a precarious position, Tony still couldn't afford getting into an argument with Obadiah, especially after the explosion in his lab.
Tony reluctantly broke away from Steve, but he was still holding on. “Okay,” he turned to everyone else, “you can all leave now.”
“Great!” Shuri patted him on the shoulder, “I’m glad you liked the party. T’Challa has a habit of going overboard sometimes.”
“Remind me never to drink again, Cap.” He slowly commanded before unwrapping the sandwich. He immediately perked up as soon as he took a bite.
“Steve’s met Peter already, right?” Bruce asked. His question might have been innocent, but it was arresting to Tony.
Thor fumed. “There’s no time for planning. Loki will only drag us further into his lies.”
Fury sighed. “The government, with the help of Stark Industries, managed to strike a secret deal with the African country Wakanda that exports the material as a surplus—S.H.I.E.L.D. has a close relationship with their king, T’Challa. Needless to say, we’re paying less than any private or public company to import the stuff.” Fury explained. Everyone, except Steve, nodded in unison.
After leaving the army, Steve had struggled with post-traumatic stress disorder for some time which prompted his mother to get him into therapy. After she died, Steve struggled to bounce back but was saved by his friends encouraging him to stay in therapy. He didn’t know where he would be if he hadn’t.
Rhodey motioned with his glass toward a group of investors swarming Steve and Obadiah. “So, I can’t get into specifics…” He leaned inward so that no one could hear their conversation.
“…could…we start…over, Tony?” Steve voice grew quiet, “…I really miss spending time with you…I also miss spending time with Peter…I just want us…to be friends again…”
Tony turned sharply away from Tiberius’s retreat, steadying himself once more before looking around for Rhodey.
“Uh…maybe…” Steve shrugged, “…we can do something together this weekend? I miss seeing…you and Peter…” He shrugged again as he smiled weakly at Tony.
Steve pulled Tony up to his face as he gasped heavily from the intensity. Tony smiled at him before kissing him, taking his time as he used one hand to rub Steve’s neck again and the other to rub his leg.
Tony stood up to be somewhat at eye level with Bucky on the opposite side of Steve’s bed. “Bucky, I really don’t understand what your problem is with me, but not only is my kid safe with his aunt, I’m going to keep visiting Steve until he wakes up.”
“Tony, I’m worried about you…” Bruce responded in a hushed voice, much like he had in the past.
Part of him appreciated that Steve hadn’t taken a picture of the core on a smartphone, which would have been impossible anyway since his lab partner didn’t own one.
Obadiah laughed as he turned in his chair to face Tony directly. "I only want to talk with you about your plus one for the event this evening."
“What backup plan? Am I the only one who doesn’t know about this?”
Steve searched around as he lifted his ass to look underneath. He sighed as he laid back down in the bed. “I’m sorry…I thought I—”
Tony let out a sleep noise as he shifted his body weight on top of Steve. Steve held still before attempting to pull his body free from Tony.
Steve rubbed Tony’s backside, looking away before looking upward. He laughed to himself. “Me too, Tony.”
“I can move around just fine.” Steve countered with a whine.
Tony chuckled as he stretched. “Why are you interested?”
“What do you think?” Gamora leaned in to whisper as soon as they were out of ear shot.
Tony walked ahead of Steve out of the main space to one of the smaller spaces attached to it. One of the consoles had the mostly reconstructed Synergy device sitting on top.
“When you were in the hospital after that lab explosion…I kind of got into it with Tony…” Bucky sighed again, looking away from Steve, “but we talked and…it was
Tony nodded emphatically as he ushered Steve in with his arms, stepping to the side. “Yes, of course.”
He wasn’t sure if he should bring up the altercation with Tiberius; Tony didn’t want to talk about it or even think about it. However, seeing Tiberius reaffirmed why he was so bad at relationships and that this one with Steve was probably just doomed to fail like it had with Pepper.
"And how many stable, healthy relationships did you have prior to that?"
“Are you
Tony moved his head to face the direction of his bedside table. “You know what to do.” He teased again.
“Steve, I’m really sorry…” Tony looked down at the water glass he was holding, “…I shouldn’t have assumed anything about your relationship with Bucky without speaking to you first…”
Riding the private express elevator down to their lab felt like an eternity, as Steve kept thinking about the way Tony looked the previous night. He had to prevent himself from racing out of the elevator as soon as its doors opened. He walked as casually as possible down the hallway until he reached the lab, spotting Tony working alone.
Steve’s expression hardened. “…you’ll be no better than Dr. Thanos or…Obadiah…”
Bruce sighed loudly as he removed his eyeglasses. “Your guess is as good as mine. We never got the numbers from Clint.”
“Great work, Rogers.” She smiled before exiting the room.
Tony chuckled. “Uh, they were dancing to this one night…I only remember because my mother said it was one of her favorites…”
Tony chuckled as he walked further into the bathroom to lean up against a counter. “I’m supporting you, Rogers. Glad to know that those therapy sessions are paying off.”
This whole situation, or thing—was it a thing?—with Tony was so confusing to Steve. At times, Tony would be willing but then he would pull away or get upset. They had a discussion about boundaries before leaving for Malibu, but then they were all over each other at the mansion. Tony even came up the pretending to be married plan. Even now, they were touching each other, but the conversation felt tense and not intimate.
Yet, this was the moment he had been fantasizing about: finally seeing Tony again. And just in that one moment, Steve was experiencing so many emotions and feelings. He cared about Synergy and the team. He also cared about Tony, no matter what happened between them. When they worked well together, they were great. And even though they had their rough moments, they also found a way to work through their differences together.
“I’m not going anywhere.” He whispered.
“You know, Rhodey has a friend who works closely with the folks over at the Pentagon. Maybe we could use his connection as an ‘in’.” Tony watched Steve nod, but could tell that work was becoming a tired topic of conversation. He mentally berated himself for bringing up business in an intimate setting like this.
Steve nodded, not sure if he should ask Tony to elaborate since he had mentioned his father.
“Mr. Stark! We’re so glad you could make it!” One of the doctors shouted over residual helicopter wind as she and the other doctors greeted Tony and Steve.
Both Ned and Peter beamed at one another. “Mr. Beck is so cool!” Ned exclaimed.
“I already told you and the Synergy goons what I know.” Loki answered sharply.
“Where did you get this?” Tony asked as he took the letter from Peter, trying not to sound upset, but was irritated that Peter had not only interrupted his sleep but also found Steve’s letter.
Steve let out a ragged sigh. “…the last time I was with another guy…I was in college…so needless to say I don’t have much experience…” The words had sorely dragged out of Steve’s mouth.
Tony halted, but he remained facing away from Steve as he answered. “I’m fine. I need to write a memo about the device lock down.” He offered, although he mostly wanted to escape from the situation entirely.
“Dammit. What was the fucking code again?”
“How was the rest of your weekend after the party?” Steve asked before drinking out of his water glass.
“You saw someone in the lab next door?” She asked as she handed him medicine.
Tony smiled at him before leaning backward. To Tony, Steve looked like the hottest mess mixed with the most innocent reticence.
Tony chuckled. “Don’t worry about it. You barely missed anything.”
Tony banged on the robot a few times. “Okay, how about this?”
Steve smiled. “We were but I guess Sam and Shuri are getting pretty serious…”
Steve expressed curiosity. “Why would you say that?”
Tony nodded his head as he walked over to a console. “I know. J.A.R.V.I.S., show me the coordinates to this shindig.”
Steve breathed deeply. “I know you wanted…” he stopped as he looked directly at Tony who was now facing him.
Tony thought about Steve during the entire board meeting instead of paying attention to the agenda which included some paltry events and more Synergy close out.
Steve’s expression hardened as Tony pushed himself to continue. “Peter was at one of those sleepaway camps I usually send him to during the summer…so I was totally alone which made the obvious depression I was suffering through so much worse…”
Tony and Steve were in the former’s bedroom after putting Peter to bed who was still way too excited about Steve staying over once again, although it was becoming a regular occurrence.
Tony dragged his feet to the sofa, leaning downward to pick up a record from a pile next to the player before straightening up to study it. Steve hesitated before approaching further.
Steve groaned again, loudly, feeling his friend pat him on the back. Bucky chuckled.
Shuri turned slightly to acknowledge Bruce. “Correct. And the pattern I found matches those levels…but beyond that, I’m not really sure what I’m looking at, Tony.”
The lab explosion was being framed as an example of the Synergy’s device’s failsafe mechanism. And Obadiah was already in the process of interviewing several contractors to bid on the rest of Synergy’s hardware.
Steve stared back at Tony, seemingly on the verge of fighting back another fit of his own. Tony closed his eyes as he wrapped a hand around Steve’s arm to disengage himself. Steve backed away from the door so Tony had some space.
“J.A.R.V.I.S., show us the specs to the Synergy device—one of my best friends is in the military. Your mannerisms remind me of him, Rogers.” Tony explained as the specs to the device appeared above the console. To Steve it sounded as if there was a hint of tentativeness in Tony’s statement.
Tony paused before continuing, smiling at Steve again. “I love you…so much, Steve.” The sentence started at strong but then ended in a whimper of emotion.
Strange chuckled before grabbing his things to head out. “Anytime, Tony.” He answered as he patted Tony on the back before turning to leave. He stopped briefly at the office door.
“Uh, you all right, Rhodes?” Tony asked, taking a sip out of his water glass.
Nebula groaned. “Are you serious? He’s saying that to cover his ass.”
“Fuck.” Tony suddenly swore to himself as he tossed his tablet onto the nearest console.
“I, uh, don’t think I ever really apologized to you about that, Rogers…” Tony looked away before looking back at Steve, “I’m sorry for being such an asshole…”
"You have nothing to add? That's a first, Obie."
“Tony?” Steve said out loud, thinking Tony was in the bathroom.
, but I can see where there was a breakdown in communication.” He grinned.
Tony winced as he crossed his arms. He really had no idea where his relationship, or whatever it was, with Steve was now headed. Tony always looked forward to having Steve over whenever Peter was with his aunt, and although Steve seemed really into him, they hadn’t gone further than the occasional make out session or a night of heavy petting. Tony had admitted to himself that he was nervous to push it any further; he wanted to take his time and let Steve know that he wasn’t in it just for the sex.
“…Steve means a lot to me…” Tony admitted instead. There was no way he was going to tell Bucky before Steve that he was in love.
“Insert the chip in the core…,” Tony groaned loudly, “you’ll see it…”
“I can’t believe you’re worse than me and my failure to properly court Captain Rogers!” Both Bruce and Tony made a face at one another before making sure Steve was out of ear shot. They peered over the couch to see that he was still talking to Rhodey before settling.
Steve started to move, but Tony motioned for him to stand still.
Sam nodded again, but Tony could tell from his expression that he was genuinely concerned. However, Tony barely responded as he said goodbye before walking out onto one of the balconies.
“Some working music would be nice, J.A.R.V.I.S., if you don’t mind, please.” Tony teased as the computer began playing the remix to “Savage.”
Steve blushed, prompting a laugh from Tony. “Sorry about the late response, but thanks for checking about allergies. I’ll pretty much eat anything.” Steve clarified; his expression reticent.
Tony nodded as he pulled out a stool to sit at the island across from Steve. “Ah well…I think we could manage something….” He smiled at Steve before standing up quickly to walk to the counter, “I should probably have some plates and shit out, sorry about that…”
Tony stopped Steve before they reached the bar. “Trust me. I’m
Tony smiled, now feeling the sensation in his chest lessen. “Thanks, Bucky. That means a lot.”
“Thanks.” Steve grinned. He lingered near the entry of the room, thinking about Tony weirdly half hugging him in front of everyone before whipping out his phone to send a text to Sam.
Tony pointed at Bruce. “Got any ideas on destroying the rest and not leaving any traces?”
“Did you sleep okay?” Steve quietly asked.
Steve winced, trying not to make the moment any more uncomfortable than it already was. They then walked over to the bar to speak with some more people before calling it night.
Tony shuffled around awkwardly, his mind racing with trying to make sense of everything that was happening in the moment.
“Nothing happened…I…just wanted to let you know…” Tony looked downward before looking up at Steve, grimacing.
me?” Steve repeated, “Tony, how many times do I have to remind you that you broke up with me. I don’t understand why you keep doing this. You
Everyone murmured as they began moving away from the table. Tony remained in the front as he watched everyone dawdle a bit before exiting the room.
“Tell me when you’re ready, Tony.” Steve called. He hoped he didn’t sound demanding. Too bad, though, because whatever was irking Tony before was now a major source of irritation.
“…I don’t think I’m right for anyone, to be honest.” Tony chuckled quietly, trying to lighten up the mood.
Steve slowly nodded, trying to process the events from the night before until that morning. The night before, Tony seemed willing to start over, but something about him suggesting they just have sex bothered Steve.
It was finally time for the wedding ceremony and Steve and Tony had managed to avoid each other until the guests gathered at the venue. The ceremony was outside on a verdant patch close to the water. Everyone in the bridal party was wearing their whitest whites while the guests wore less formal attire to match the beachy scene.
Tony nodded with a smile before pointing toward the kitchen. “Want breakfast?”
He had a plan in case the conversation proved to be too awkward. Although reluctant to help Tony avoid his problems, Rhodey had agreed to call Tony and act as if there was an emergency in case things got dicey with Pepper. Mostly Tony wanted to avoid telling her that he loved and missed her terribly and possibly beg for her to come back to him.
Tony and Peter scooted out from underneath the robot to join Steve at the console. Both hummed and posed thoughtfully as they studied the numbers.
Fury looked down at his wristwatch and smiled. “Like a well-oiled machine.” Referring to how effectively and swiftly the simulation was playing out.
“Here’s a valuable piece of advice. Don’t let Thor touch you in
“This is serious, Tony.” Tony had never seen Pepper look so grave.
Thor, Natasha, and Bruce followed closely behind. Bruce walked up to Tony and clapped his back a few times with a goofy grin. Thor walked over to Steve and did the same, but Steve managed to hold his balance from Thor’s usual too force-filled greetings.
“Steve,” Tony looked upward slightly at him, “I’m not good for you.”
Steve nodded as he waited for Tony to give him the input information from the solved equations while Shuri and Bruce carefully packed up their equipment. As soon as the Synergy device began generating the detonator, Tony motioned again for everyone to slowly follow him out of the conference room.
“Uh, no,” Tony counted to ten in his head, “I don’t think you ever mentioned it.” He attempted through gritted teeth, trying to keep his expression soft, but he was sure he was grimacing instead.
Steve waited with anticipation; he knew May wasn’t finished but could tell she was trying to remain careful speaking about Tony in front of him.
Steve glanced at Tony with a smile. “Sounds great, but I can meet you here before dropping off Peter, so you don’t have to make so many trips.”
Steve rolled his eyes. “Out in the living room area…”
Tony inhaled once more. “…I really wish I could take back what I said, but then I think about everything else…”
Tony moaned and whined as Steve continued inside, feeling himself coming close. Steve held him down into the bed, his body also shaking from the feeling. One of his hands traveled up Tony’s body until Steve was near Tony’s face. He brushed Tony’s lips with his thumb, rubbing them gently until Tony stuck out his tongue lick Steve’s thumb. Steve moaned as he pressed his thumb inside Tony’s mouth before entering two fingers, watching Tony suck on his fingers as he fucked him.
Steve chuckled before Tony continued. “Also…I wanted to thank you again for coming out to the Hamptons with me…that really meant a lot…”
“Good question, Pep. We need to take the device out into the field a few more times to test any patterns and possible anomalies.”
Steve cleared his throat, which was picked up by the mic pinned to his shirt. “…our world is becoming more unmanageable…and destructive…by the minute…”
Nebula had assured him that the weapon was stable when not in motion, so Obadiah decided to leave the briefcase in a niche under a counter in the conference room. Before arriving, the tech conference staffers had agreed to providing high-profile participants with high-tech secure rooms.
Steve nodded; he couldn’t believe how great it felt to be that close to Tony. He shuffled to lie halfway on top of Tony; he couldn’t stop his hands from roaming everywhere.
the program to really participate.” Obviously emphasizing “running” in response to Steve’s comment about Tony being in charge.
“It would be best to commit those to memory, and only use the chip in dire situations, but let’s not hope it comes to that.”
Steve wrapped a hand around Sharon’s shoulder as they waited for Tony to say something. Tony gritted his teeth, knowing that he needed to project some sort of composure instead of yelling at Steve for not even telling him that he might be seeing someone else. Tony slowly looked directly at Sharon, flashing his most practiced PR smile all the while his insides were decaying into ruins.
Bruce took his time removing his eyeglasses to squint at his friend before crossing his arms. It was obvious that Tony was specifically referring to his breakup with Pepper.
Tony smiled as he buried his head into Steve’s chest, using one hand to draw him close to his body. Steve wrapped an arm around his shoulder to pull him in close. He kissed the top of Tony’s head before settling.
“Is this yours, Rogers? And how did I miss this the last time I was here?” Tony pointed at the bike with a toothy smile.
“What?” Tony shrugged.
Steve shuffled around to get more comfortable, still holding onto Tony. Tony leaned forward a bit to kiss him as he rocked his hips. He began to moan as he kissed Steve, his hips rocking steadily. Steve kept his eyes on Tony as he pushed upward. Tony pushed downward into his body before easing.
Maybe he was being ridiculous about the dream. Like Sam said, no one would ever know that he had dreamt about Tony or had fallen asleep in his bed. He reminded himself to get a grip and just go with the flow, let loose like Bucky had suggested.
Steve stepped toward Bucky and Tony. “Thanks for the invite, Buck, but I think Tony and I are planning to take it easy today—”
Tony scoffed with an eye roll. “Okay, boys. Let’s turn this thing on.”
“I think it’s all right so far.” He answered.
Steve smiled to himself as he buried his head in Tony’s chest. “Good, but…I’m sorry about the mess…”
“Bruce...help Steve get people away from the building...” He directed in the lowest, saddest tone although Bruce had awkwardly witnessed every single word exchanged.
“I get that, Steve. I’m so sorry for accusing you of keeping something from me…”
Tony watched Rhodey’s face morph into that all-too-serious expression that Tony swore to god Rhodey only reserved for him.
Sam turned toward Bucky. “Buck, may I speak with you outside, please?”
“Great!” Mr. Beck scribbled a number down on the pad before handing it to Steve, “I’m sorry to rush you along, but I have a faculty meeting in a few minutes.”
burden. It’s not worth it.”
interested. Why wouldn’t he be?”
Tony nodded before answering. “The team is fine. We rigged together an algorithm to test the device before taking it out in the field.”
He thought to himself.
“You told me…” Steve interrupted Tony, “…that Synergy would never be used for weapons manufacturing. I don’t know about you, Tony, but I’m not going to sit by and let all our hard work be destroyed for personal gains.”
minutes, and Steve can help me put you to bed.” He had offered casually with a wave of the hand.
Steve waited next to their seats as he pointed to the window seat. “Would you like the window seat, Tony?”
“Yeah, sure.” Tony finally responded, rising from his chair to follow Bucky out of the room.
Tony groaned, but he read the message anyway in an effort to distract himself from brooding over his failing dating life. As Tony read through the email his eyes grew wide over Hammer’s very detailed description of Thanos’s short tenure at Hammer Industries.
Tony braced himself against the table to stop blathering on about his personal problems. Something about being around Steve had made Tony relax even if he wasn’t entirely sure how Steve felt about him. However, going on and on about Pepper was a huge mistake; Steve was definitely going to bolt now.
did you get this?”
Sam smirked at Steve before turning to leave. “Don’t have
“I don’t know if you remember this…” Tony began in a whisper, “but do you remember when Peter and I were working on some wayward robot and it freaked you out?”
“I don’t know if it’s me or if you don’t want to talk about it, but I wanted to talk to you about it…when you were ready, of course…but I guess you never were…”
Loki grinned upward at Tony. “You have no idea.”
Tony nodded quickly. “Thanks, Bucky. I really appreciate it.” He tried to smile but felt too overwhelmed in the moment to do so without grimacing. Tony said goodbye to Bucky before hurrying out of the building to get back to his car before Steve came back to the apartment.
Steve’s last comment sucked all the air out of the space. He glared back at Tony, feeling a strange mix of emotions he hadn’t felt since they broke up. But after what felt like forever, Steve turned away from Tony, walking to his table, yet he was too angry to work.
Peter was in the back with May, bouncing along to the music, too excited for his aunt to get him to settle down, so she just let him enjoy himself before leaving the party. Fury was standing off to the side with his wife, just bobbing his head to the music, sipping out of his margarita with a long straw. And Thor was singing along as well, clapping joyously as he got caught up in everyone enjoying Tony’s performance.
Obadiah quickly followed him. “Bigger? Thanos, I understand that you’re trying to create your ‘super’ weapon, but you should take what you have here and sell it to the highest bidder. This is almost close to what Anthony managed to cobble together.”
Steve nodded, smiling at Tony which prompted that warm feeling on the inside. “Yeah…I should get some stuff from home.”
“I was…the one who set off the explosion in the lab—”
Tony shrugged once more; he wasn’t sure what to say right away. He was just feeling weird about Steve moving in with Bucky, but Steve was okay with him seeing his ex? It didn’t make any sense.
Everyone verbally responded to a degree. Bruce walked up to Thor, patting him on the shoulder.
Peter’s eyes lit up. “I really like Steve!”
The scientist turned around abruptly as soon as he heard his name called. “Y-yes?” He muttered, holding a tablet.
Tony rocked forward before leaning downward to kiss Steve’s neck. Steve tilted his head to the side to look at the bottom half of Tony’s body. His eyes traced from Tony’s arm behind his body to his hand, realizing that Tony was fingering himself as he kissed Steve. Steve couldn’t stop staring; he watched Tony’s fingers move in and out of his body which was causing Tony to moan louder than usual.
Steve felt too awkward to articulate a response to Tony, embarrassed that he had found him like that.
"Steve, please!” Tony jumped up from his chair, spinning around, before walking a few paces away from the kitchen into the living room. At this point, Tony was close to a full-on cry and couldn’t look at Steve without bursting into tears.
Tony shrugged. “
“Yep?” Tony looked upward at Steve who was looking downward at him somewhat.
Peter and Tony looked at each other slowly before looking over at Steve who appeared the most angry they have ever seen him.
As Steve spoke, Tony blinked a few times again, his brain suddenly piecing together a conversation he had a long time ago but one he had completely forgotten until now, sparked by Beyoncé’s voice.
Steve waved Tony off before glancing around them, making sure they were alone in the hallway. He placed his hands on Tony’s upper arms before rubbing them.
“So, how are things going with Steve?” Pepper asked causally, obviously unaware that Tony and Steve hadn’t spoken to each other in days.
Tony sat on the edge of his bed, tapping on his phone to pull up Steve’s contact profile from his favorite’s list. After talking to Bucky, he thought maybe he should wait to see if Bucky had managed to convince Steve to call him. However, as the hours dragged by, Tony could no longer wait. Now all he could think about was possibly losing Steve because he wouldn’t let him express himself in person.
Tony wished, as he followed the escort, he had a minute or two to get his wits about him; something about Steve being all over him just now coupled with not having discussed the kiss after Thor’s party made him feel uneasy again. He managed to regroup quickly in time before approaching the door to the billiard room, but the sinking feeling from trying to figure out Steve was beginning to overrun his composure.
Rhodey looked relieved. “Thanks, Tony. That means a lot to me.”
Steve sighed, knowing he needed to get to the point. “Sharon, I’ve really appreciated our time together,” he began slowly, “but—”
Steve turned slightly so he could see Tony out of the corner of his eye; he still looked on edge.
“Steve…” Tony began again. He sighed as he placed his hands on hips, keeping his back toward Steve. “…it has nothing to do with Synergy…”
Bruce sighed as he walked up to Steve and Tony who continued to stare the other down.
Tony nodded without responding verbally. Steve rubbed his shoulder before opening the box again.
“Fine, okay.” Steve shrugged.
? Now he probably thinks I’m an emotional wreck.”
Tony quipped as soon as he entered the lab, nearly making Steve jolt at the sound of his voice. He smiled at Steve before walking over to a table with the Synergy device rested on top of it. Eerily silent, Steve stood rigid in the middle of the space, resting his hands on his hips. Steve watched Tony pick up the device and turn it around a few times. After a moment, Tony stopped what he was doing to look at Steve.
Both Tony and Steve looked at each other, perhaps both sensing that it was awkward seeing the other in person again since that night.
Tony sighed. “Yeah, I know. I should have listened to your dad. Can’t really do anything about it now.”
Peter nodded quickly; “okay!” he answered as he sprinted out of the room.
Tony kept grinning as he gently turned Steve’s head so he could kiss him. “Why are you sorry?”
Tony groaned loudly into the pillow before turning over onto his side. Earlier that evening, he had updated Fury on the situation with the Synergy device. Some S.H.I.E.L.D. agents had been dispatched to the Tower in the labs, Pepper’s place and May’s. Tony had also sent Peter over to May’s thinking it would be safer for him to be there, but that only exacerbated the feeling of loneliness Tony had been wading through all night.
Tony fought back another sob that he ended up choking on, trying to focus on something else but the thought of Steve going through his personal items threw off his concentration. He then started crying to himself, thinking that he had finally met the right person before telling himself that being in a relationship never worked out for him so there was no use in trying to make things work with Steve no matter how close they had become.
“Thank you.” He answered, a little annoyed.
Steve took his time pulling his jeans on before exiting the bedroom with Tony closely behind him. He tried straightening out his hair, but he knew it wouldn’t help the scene Sam was about to witness.
Tony looked down at his loafers before looking back up at Pepper. He knew she was right, once again, but having an event to put on a show for the board sounded fucking terrible. He hated playing nice with Obadiah, but he figured that was the only way to simmer down tensions before they received the government contract. Afterward, Tony was going to fire Obadiah, definitely.
Steve had certainly thought so. Besides being overwhelmed by the setting, he had been seized by an especially intense conversation with Thor which involved a retelling of his usual hobbies. As the story progressed, Steve could no longer tell if its narrator was a fellow human being or the Norse god himself.
Bucky grinned as he finally accepted Tony’s handshake. It was a bit on the too firm side, but Tony didn’t let it show.
Obadiah was reading some papers next to a bookshelf near his desk. He looked upward somewhat to acknowledge Steve.
“Sir, I’m going to need you to step to the side.” The officer shooed Tony away as she returned to her communicator.
“Yeah,” Bucky patted Steve on the back a few times, “he manages to impress me every day.” He quipped.
Peter nodded, burying his head against Tony’s chest. Tony sighed quietly as he looked at Steve.
“Hey, Rogers.” Tony began, sliding his hands into his pockets.
Clint snorted as he pulled out his phone to tap on it a few times. “How did you guys manage to make it when I was in the hospital?”
“Steve…” Tony tried to push away from Steve, but Steve wouldn’t let go of his face. Steve pulled him closer again, nipping at Tony’s bottom lip.
“Please,” Tony held onto Bucky’s hand through a very awkward handshake, “just call me Tony.”
Steve took a deep breath as he nodded back. He took his time sitting next to Tony on the bed. “I know, Tony. You told me…” He hesitated before reaching out an arm to hold Tony around the shoulders. Tony was now breathing more steadily.
have to be a chore with you, Rogers?”
But to be honest, Tony mostly wanted to avoid Steve because he felt like he might have embarrassed himself by constantly staring at their newest team member during the project introduction. Something about Steve was very appealing, well besides the fact that he was extremely attractive. Yet, Tony knew he needed to get his own life in order before even considering asking anyone out. Also getting involved with another Synergy member would be a huge no-no. Although Rhodey had been kind about the possibility (again, if there was one), he wasn’t sure how others would react, especially the Stark Industries board.
“Good morning, everyone…” A voice materialized throughout the cabin.
“Morning, Steve!” Peter hugged him back before breaking out into a run to jump onto the bed with Tony, jumping so hard that it nearly bounced Tony off the bed.
Steve nodded back before turning to face the device. It glowed some more before humming quietly to signal that it was almost done constructing the detonator.
“Hey, Pep. You’re
Steve stood at the bottom of the staircase as he continued to glare upward at Tony; Tony had never seen Steve so angry before.
Tony could feel himself coming to the edge, and as he neared that edge, his emotions got the best of him again.
Tony shook his head. “Okay, whatever the hell that was about.”
Tony nodded as he stepped out of the elevator, grabbing Steve’s hand before leading him to the suite’s bedroom. As he opened the door, Tony felt Steve hug him from behind before turning him around for another kiss. Tony let Steve kiss him deeply and slowly before he turned them around again with Steve’s back facing the edge of the bed.
“…are you okay…?” Steve asked.
Steve shook his head again as he finally met Tony, placing his hands on his arms rubbing them gently.
“Open brackets: Ominus inverted, 56789 divided by 234, delta then another aleph, closed brackets.” Tony kept reading off figures, but Steve was having trouble catching up.
Tony watched Steve and Peter, feeling the urge to hug them both. Instead, he jumped up from the sofa, clapping his hands together to get their attention.
Strange shook his head. “No, just some murmuring here or there, but nothing substantial.”
Tony chuckled as he typed back a reply.
Peter began rattling off potential dishes he had seen Tony eat a few times as Steve drove off toward the Tower.
“I’m sorry, Steve,” he scooted closer to Steve, reaching out a hand to caress his side, “remember the first time we did this and I told you I would like to fuck you if you wanted it?”
“I thought you wanted us to show up late?” Steve scoffed.
He knew this would keep him up all night, so he figured maybe having a drink would calm his nerves enough to get a few hours of sleep. He took a moment before walking over to one of the cupboards to retrieve a bottle of aged whiskey before finding a glass.
Bruce readjusted his eyeglasses before crossing his arms with a shrug. “I think if we keep it on lock for a few weeks, maybe a month—tops—is fine.”
Bruce nodded, attempting to discretely write down with a pencil on a piece of paper notes for his date.
Steve huffed, clearly not amused, but waited a moment before finally smiling back at Tony.
Steve rocked forward for a second or so before taking a hold of his cock to enter Tony. Tony inhaled sharply as Steve entered; he nearly fell over on top of Tony from the feeling.
Tony returned to his phone which was now facing down again on his desk. He flipped it over and swiped once until the message from Pepper appeared. Tony sighed before he typed out an affirmative reply. He really needed Pepper when it came to dealing with Obadiah and he figured he owed her dinner and an update on Peter.
Steve nodded, but with a strained smile; although he and Bucky often poked fun at each other in front of their friends, they never had as viciously as Loki did to Thor.
“I think we should talk in person.” Steve answered sternly.
“This weapon is the most improved version,” Nebula began, “so it’ll get the job done no matter what, Gamora.”
“Rogers?”
Tony stared blankly at Bruce as he approached the console he usually worked at. “What tech expo?”
“Our vibranium guy? No shit?! Nice, Sam!” Tony reached over to clap Sam on the shoulder.
Steve smiled before answering. “Tony, I’m not asking…I’m confirming.”
Tony heard a hard knock on his door, praying for the best but obviously expecting the worst given how horrible the last day and a half had been.
“I, uh, tried making lunch…hopefully I don’t kill you…” Tony attempted to tease, but the joke sounded stilted.
Steve nodded again. He kept his eyes on Tony before walking back to the table with his workbag. Tony sighed with relief, thinking Steve was on the verge of bringing up the breakup again.
“…I’m really sorry, Tony…” Pepper began, casting her eyes downward, “I didn’t know he received an invitation…”
Bucky stared at Steve. “What, Steve? Tony and you, what? Please don’t tell me you fucked already.” He teased although his friend appeared distressed.
“Have Ms. Potts sign it.” Bruce removed his eyeglasses to rub the bridge of his nose as he motioned toward the frightened intern to exit the conference room.
Tony chuckled. “Thanks, much appreciated.”
As Fury concluded, Agent Hill reappeared, walking ahead before stepping to the side to reveal a person most of the group didn’t recognize, except for Steve and Tony.
Tony winced as Tiberius’s omen popped into his head again.
Tony waited another second before unzipping Steve’s pants. He then unzipped his own before reaching past the opening of Steve’s to his briefs. Tony moaned as he felt Steve through the fabric, before tugging it down to pull out Steve’s cock. Steve’s breath hitched as Tony felt around before pulling his own cock out. Tony then tugged on Steve’s shirt, struggling a bit to remove it smoothly, which prompted a laugh from Steve as it caught on his nose before he was freed. Tony laughed with him, straightening up to yank of his own shirt before pulling Steve back down on the bed. Tony hesitated before wrapping a hand around both of their cocks to rub them together; he wasn’t sure how far Steve wanted to go.
“You’re here early. And that’s saying a lot.”
Sam and Bucky looked at each other before staring at Steve again. “Damn, Steve,” Bucky started, “I’m sorry.”
Tony scrunched up his face. “Yeah, okay, dude.” He looked over at Peter again before returning to his food.
“No…I’m good, but thanks…”
Tony nodded; thankful he didn’t screw up again. He pointed back toward the café. “Can we drink our coffees together and talk about the weather or sports?” He joked, which made Steve laugh a little.
However, everyone else just stared at him as if he were an alien from outer space. Obadiah returned the stare before clapping his hands together, cracking a huge fake smile.
“Oh, come on,” Tony jogged to catch up with Bruce, “I was listening, I promise.” He finally caught up with the other who was by this time marching down the hallway.
He had forgotten to give Steve the instructions for inputting data into the Synergy device before going in. Through an exhausted state, Tony thought that he had given them to Steve the day before. Still, it was no accuse for practically trying to push his lab mate out of the way because he had lost his patience. He hoped maybe he could smooth things over with Steve; Steve was a diehard professional and would probably keep working even in the most dire of situations.
Steve nodded. He sighed mentally although he still felt uneasy.
They walked to the restaurant which wasn’t too far away from the subway stop, chatting about nothing really until they arrived. Tony had never been so nervous before about having dinner with someone, and it wasn’t like it was a date. Well, he wasn’t sure anyway; they still hadn’t verbally agreed on it. Yet, it did feel more than just two friends sharing a meal, so Tony took it as it was.
“…what the hell is this?” Tony squinted his eyes as he tried to make sense of the subject line that was merely a string of words scrambled together.
Tony squiggled a bit but felt distant at the same time. Steve waited patiently for him to answer.
“…uh…” Tony struggled as he tried to stay focused, “…um…”
tired of the maniacal laughter. You better fucking talk, right now!” He stared directly at Thanos.
“Thank, god!” Tony was on his phone emailing while Steve was talking, rolling his eyes as he leaned toward the bedside table to grab something from the drawer.
Steve looked up at Tony, feeling weird that he had picked up on his anxiety. “Uh…are you sure?” He asked quietly, too shocked to mentally parse through Tony’s proposal.
“You’re right. And I do remember…” he admitted, “I just…when I said that to you in the lab, I wasn’t thinking about after we talked. I was more focused on the fact that you’re the first—only person, besides my therapist, that I’ve talked to about that shit, you know, the shit with my dad.”
Steve took a moment before answering. Although he was still frustrated with their current relationship, it was always nice hearing Tony’s voice.
Steve shrugged. “I know you like the more fancy drinks once in a while, but it’s Sunday and I figured you would probably want the usual…”
Steve sighed before continuing, “…now it’s a little too much, don’t you think? I can’t eat a meal in here anymore…it smells…like really bad.”
“I can’t let him near the device. I have Bruce in the lab right now guarding it and deflecting him, if necessary.” Tony sighed as he glanced upward at Pepper. Her expression looked pained.
The board members murmured to each other, but no one appeared offended. Actually, every single one of them appeared impressed that even their high-level security clearance couldn’t even get them close to the device.
“Okay, Tony. You caught me,” he sighed before continuing, “I did take advantage of the whole pretending to be married thing to kiss you at that mansion.” Steve turned bright red again as he confessed.
Tony nodded as he slipped his hands into his jeans’ pockets. “Okay.” He had no clue what Pepper was up to, but he could sense that he wasn’t going to like what he was about to hear.
Steve looked stunned, although he eventually smiled back. “Sure, I would love to have dinner with you and Peter. I thought I wouldn’t ever get to meet him…” He trailed off, sounding dejected.
In fact, Tony
Obadiah slid his hands into his pants pockets, sporting the same disturbing grin from before. Steve felt unsettled by it.
Steve swiveled around in his chair, mimicking the call to attention that was given by everyone else in the room at the sound of Tony Stark’s voice. Tony stood in the doorway of the room, wearing a grey blazer with a Black Sabbath band t-shirt underneath, complete with jeans. He was fiddling with a pair of sunglasses in his hands. Steve hadn’t meant to stare, but he also didn’t think he would see Tony again until later in the project.
Tony hummed as he pressed downward into Steve’s body, losing himself again. He felt Steve push up into his body, feeling his backside with both hands as one hand traveled downward to squeeze his ass. Tony moaned as he felt Steve squeeze him, rubbing himself against Steve’s leg before moving his body to hump Steve’s hardening cock he could feel through the fabric of their clothing.
I made a mistake…ending things with Steve…” Tony leaned back into the chair. He looked everywhere except at Bruce who had placed his tablet back on the console.
hottest, I quite enjoyed this one.” Tony teased as his voice lowered. He straightened himself out as Steve finally let go of his face.
“Tony…we might have to implement the failsafe…” Tony didn’t have to be in the same room to feel Bruce staring at him intently.
? Is that a question?” He then knocked the tablet his colleague was holding out his hands with one sweep, causing the colleague to whimper some more.
Steve slowly turned to face Tony directly, nodding a couple times.
“Run the sequence!” Peter shouted, attempting to address J.A.R.V.I.S.
“Yeah, of course, Tone. I figured I would end up doing that anyway.” Tony could feel Rhodey’s grin through the phone.
Tony nodded. “Okay…” His voice cracked.
“That’s enough.” Tony pointed at his friend with delight.
Once they approached a hospital room, the doctor went in first to clear the ambassador’s entourage out. Steve felt a hand lightly caress his shoulder.
“Tony!” Steve pulled Tony into a hug, “that was amazing! Thank you!”
Steve yelped as Tony ran over to Peter. “Force shutdown, Peter!” Tony called, “force shutdown!”
Rhodey held up his hand with a kind expression as he chuckled. “Rhodey’s just fine.”
Tony crossed his arms. “Have you at least thought about it?”
Steve shook his head as he sat up straight. “Tony, it’s okay if you don’t want to go…I understand.”
It was a late evening at Stark Industries and two security officers were hauling a squirming Loki to escort him out of the building. Obadiah was standing in the lobby, chatting with some other officers as the two carting Loki appeared from one of the employee elevators. As soon as Loki spotted Obadiah, he winked. Obadiah scoffed, crossing his arms, glaring at Loki as he passed with the guards.
“…was it okay?” Steve asked, his voice low and a little coarse.
Steve nodded a little. “I’m sorry for leaving so quickly,” he sighed before continuing, “I wasn’t feeling well from the party…”
Sam had been in constant communication with Tony since the explosion, but Tony hadn’t heard a word from Bucky. The only time they had seen each other was the day of the explosion at the hospital and Bucky had refused to talk to anyone. Sam had told Tony that he and Bucky went to visit Steve about an hour before the team did yesterday. And Tony was grateful that he had managed to avoid Bucky up until now; he was still feeling weird from their last conversation.
“Thor! Hey! Where are you going?” Tony shouted after him.
Tony laughed again as he pulled Steve along with him. As the three went through the backstage, they found Happy standing at the end of the hallway, holding off a hoard of press agents.
The security officer nodded a few times before motioning for his subordinates to receive instructions. After a moment, Obadiah was left nearly alone in the lobby. He turned to watch the guards hand Loki off to some police officers who then shoved him into an unmarked police car. Obadiah grinned to himself before whipping out his phone to place a call.
“Jesus. I don’t want to talk about it, Bruce.” Tony knew his friend was referring to his behavior during the first simulation.
“Seriously? Aren’t you all supposed to be some of the best that Tony Stark could come up with??” The clearly irritated scientist then wedged himself into one of his colleague’s personal spaces.
“Thanks, Tony.” He ran a hand through his hair, but immediately clammed up as Tony continued to watch him.
“Of course…I’ll send you an encrypted email as soon as I get back to the Tower…or…” he shuffled back and forth on his feet, “I can call you? Your number is still the same, right?”
Steve looked down at the map as everyone else continued to offer their own opinion about the holographic slide shows. He could see that it was a topographic map of New York City and its surrounding areas with a grid grafted on top of it.
“Uh,” Tony turned some more to finally face Steve, “…are you still coming over tonight?”
Steve cringed. “I don’t think I’ll be good at that. I’ve never really done this before.”
Tony ran ahead to open the door to the lobby for Steve. Although he still felt weird about Bucky being so blatant back at the restaurant, Steve managed to finally smile as he watched Tony sprint to the elevator bank.
Steve nodded as Tony worked, tapping quickly before pointing to Steve. Steve nodded again as he quickly inputted the functions into the device as Tony called them out.
Silence enveloped them both as Steve could feel the tension rise between himself and Tony again. He shuffled on the bed with a cough, waiting for Tony to respond.
very important.” Tony teased.
Bruce sighed again; he shuffled around, trying to look away from Tony. “…I told Steve about the trip…I also lied about mixing the dates up so you would ask him to go with you…”
, Obie.” Tony shot back. Part of him wanted to jab Obadiah about accusing Steve of an inappropriate relationship with a superior, but thankfully he managed to contain himself.
Tony waited before sighing. “Remember when I took Rogers with me to the west coast for that tech conference a while back?”
The officer removed her sunglasses to study Tony. He stared back at her before cracking a smile, but the officer scoffed, unimpressed.
Hey…can I call you for a quick second? I would like to talk.
“Thanks, Tony.” Steve mumbled, too shy to really acknowledge Tony.
Steve’s face flushed; he was thankful that his friend couldn’t see his expression.
“…imagine the possibilities…” Tony waited for the faces to change again, “medical, military, perhaps cosmetic?” Tony winked at the crowd which earned him a spate of laughter.
“I think we have more than enough information to proceed.”
Steve smiled back as he hung the towel he was using to dry his hair on a chair near the bed. He then walked to the other side of the bed, taking the towel wrapped around his waist off which earned a wide grin from Tony.
Bruce and Natasha were working at S.H.I.E.L.D.’s Headquarters and had asked him to go back to Stark Industries to retrieve some numbers. He had trouble understanding why he had to get the fucking numbers or whatever they were; they could just wait until the morning when Tony was in, but Natasha and Bruce preferred to work late.
Tony groaned to himself, now annoyed that someone was yet again interrupting a moment with Steve.
“If you let something like this bother you, the rest of your life will be even more difficult. Trust me.” Tony continued with his back facing Steve.
Steve eased in another finger; his motions were picking up pace causing Tony to moan even more. Steve could feel his cock twitch with anticipation as he listened to Tony moan and squirm on his fingers. He kept watching, rapt by the scene.
“…but would you like to grab a drink sometime? Like just me—
Steve glanced up at the door, listening for any sign of Tony. He knew he was taking a chance reading the diary behind Tony’s back, but Steve was convinced that there might be something in the diary to explain Tony’s actions since they met. It was becoming easier trying to gauge Tony’s emotions, but Steve knew that Tony had to be dealing with more issues than he let on, especially since he kept the trip away from him and appears to be overprotective of Peter.
“Banner,” Tony called as he studied the numbers on his tablet, “do you see this?”
“Uh, should we go to bed now?” He asked awkwardly.
Both Bruce and Thor nodded at Tony. The three of them were sitting in the back of the mobile lab. After addressing Bruce and Thor, Tony took his time joining Steve in the passenger seat. He motioned toward the scene as Steve drove nearer.
“Steve?” Tony gasped automatically.
After spending some time in Tony’s lab, the rest of the team had gathered to view the facilities together as Fury explained their project timeline. From the tour, Steve had the chance to fully observe his teammates, who seemed like people he could rely on.
Tony let out an excruciating groan, which caused Steve to hold him close to his chest. Tony sighed again before reaching out an arm to half hug Steve.
The room became quiet as everyone looked back and forth between the door and Obadiah. Obadiah, for a brief moment, looked surprised by the accusation. Yet, he shrugged it off with a hand wave to avoid any further embarrassment.
Tony, as he let Steve hold him, groaned again. “Steve, it’s not about winning or losing. It’s about safety.”
If for some reason you would like to decline this offer, please let us know immediately. Otherwise, we look forward to you joining us in this venture.
Steve returned to studying the vibranium core. He took a notebook out of his bag and began quickly sketching. He jotted down a few notes around the drawing of the core before closing his notebook.
Obadiah slowly turned around. He was holding a little plate with a croissant and some fruit on top.
Natasha squinted at Steve before her face relaxed.
remembered, as Steve kept feeling him through his clothes, the advice his friends had given him about taking his time when pursuing future relationships.
Steve smiled as he turned to kiss him. Tony let Steve kiss him a few times before kissing him back. They both then turned onto their backs to stare up at the ceiling.
Pepper pressed on. “Or the other times you forgot any holiday or any other birthday or an anniversary? Anytime I needed you to be somewhere important? Or the times I needed you to be serious, especially about the two of us, but you refused to be?”
He continued with some more lines about cherishing Shuri and being there for her during the rough times. As Sam concluded, Tony accidentally looked over at Steve.
Tony chuckled. “The one in the middle is the one Peter draws of himself. I think Spiderman?”
“Everything will work out accordingly, my boy.” Obadiah nearly whispered with the most disingenuous expression that made Tony sick.
As Steve looked Tony in the eye while shaking hands, he was surprisingly met with a similar intense gaze. They shook hands and traded pleasantries before Steve left the office. He was told during the interview that he would only really work with Tony toward the end of the project when it came time to present the final product to the board. Steve figured that was probably for the best; he couldn’t stand the thought of working daily with someone who seemingly cared less about his team members.
Strange nodded with a heavy sigh as he stopped the car in front of Marcus Garvey Park where the medical clinic was housed.
“Hey, everyone!” Sam called from the upper level of the yacht, “we’re doing the bridal party photos now so everyone can rest before the party.”
“That’s great. Thank you.” Bruce responded as he drew nearer toward the table.
Tony flinched as Steve drew nearer; he had trouble trying to reconcile Steve’s current behavior and the situation they had stumbled into.
Tony made a small noise of disbelief. “Recently?”
“Tony,” Bruce began to speak into Steve and Tony’s earpieces, “where do you want us?”
“Tony, you can lie down if you want. I know it’s getting super late.” Steve offered as he pulled the covers back on his side. Tony look at Steve then the bed, then Steve again before looking back down at the bed.
“Could you follow me this way, please?” The voice asked.
As soon as the doors opened, Steve exhaled as he stepped out into the hallway. He looked to his left and saw two glass doors with the words “RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT” embossed on the glass. Steve easily pried open the otherwise unnecessarily heavy glass doors before walking up to the receptionist desk.
“J.A.R.V.I.S., lower the volume, please.” Tony waited before closing the door as the volume of the music lowered.
rich.” Tony said to Steve but loud enough for everyone else to hear.
“I don’t know, surprise me.” Tony answered curtly, his voice lowering in despair.
Steve nodded before moving his body to lie on top of Tony. Tony wrapped his arms around Steve, rubbing them along his backside as they kissed each other. Steve pushed downward into Tony’s body which drew a sharp moan from Tony. He could feel his body reacting which helped him refocus on some much-needed sexual relief instead of dodging Steve’s concerns.
“Okay,” Bruce huffed as he began to walk past Tony, “I’m going to start working out more, dye my hair blond, then grow a few inches taller. Maybe that’ll get you to pay attention to me.” He concluded as he described Steve’s key physical features.
“…uh…tell him…uh, I’ll…just follow you out…” Steve rose slowly from his chair and walked out of the office ahead of his assistant. He took his time surveying the cubicles until he spotted Tony chatting with another intern next to their cubicle.
Steve almost blushed. There was something about Tony’s smile that felt inviting.
As Steve’s fingers finally made contact with Tony’s face, prompting an “oh” from the latter, the jet shook somewhat from turbulence, launching Steve’s body forward into Tony’s lap. Tony laughed as he caught him.
“Well, what can you do?” Tony managed to coolly answer.
Ever since he tried fingering with Tony, Steve couldn’t get the feeling out of his mind and he thought maybe he could try taking things further. He read up on what he needed to do to prepare himself for such an undertaking and was now waiting for the right moment to talk to Tony about it.
Bruce was shielding the entrance to Tony and Steve’s lab, arms casually crossed as if he were a bouncer at a night club. Obadiah was standing in front of him, barely fuming, but he had his hands on his hips to indicate that he was not pleased.
Tony stared impassively at Steve before frowning. “Surely, you’re joking, Rogers. Don’t you remember almost dying in a lab explosion caused by the Synergy device not too long ago? I really don’t want to have anything to do with it at the moment.”
“Oh my god…you smell so nice…” Tony whispered through the kiss.
Peter rolled his eyes, looking over in Steve’s direction, pleading for mercy. Steve laughed as Tony looked at both his kid and his husband as if he didn’t know why he was being ridiculous.
“Look, Steve. I know how you feel about Tony. You brought him along because you want to get close again, like it’s
Tony let out a sigh as he fell onto his back on the bed with his arm dangling off the edge clenching his phone. Last night’s conversation with Steve had been so fucking weird. Tony’s mind spun from the confused mess: he had trouble trying to figure out why Steve would get so close then apologize profusely for being so close. And why he seemed so cool with Tony now even though he ran out of the penthouse after Thor’s party.
Tony let out another groan as he stopped stretching. “Eh, I’m just having some trouble sleeping.”
“Uh, sure…yeah. That sounds nice.” Tony smiled meekly, stumbling a little. He shuffled around himself. To Steve it appeared as if Tony had forgotten something; Tony was actually trying to hide his excitement.
Shuri unlocked a secure cabinet to retrieve the Synergy device. “So, I’ll just work on the device a bit before we have to rehearse later tonight.”
“The great thing about these uniforms is that I can wire J.A.R.V.I.S. to them. So, you have all the essentials: GPS tracker, hardware and software specs, etc. Also, the suits play music. Can’t possible do Synergy work without great bops, am I right?”
“From my mother.” Tony volunteered quietly.
Obadiah shifted a bit in his chair before answering. Tony remained outwardly nonchalant toward Obadiah’s glaring stare from the other side of his desk.
