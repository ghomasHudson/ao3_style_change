He crawled into bed next to Tony, pulling him close. He checked on Tony, seeing his eyes were closed. He laid his head down on the pillow and closed his eyes. Making sure he didn’t fall asleep until he felt Tony’s breath even out and was sure he was asleep. Once he did, he smiled to himself before letting himself drift off.
Skipping out of the room, after Tony, Steve called out again. “Stark. Hey, Tony,” then more softly, “Tony, wait.”
“I just - I don’t wan - I keep getti - getting these dreams, nightmares really, and they - they’re too much…” Tony whispered his answer, ashamed that Steve would judge him for it. When he finished talking he blushed slightly, wanting to lean against Steve and feel his arms around him once again but at the same time to nervous that Steve would reject him for showing weakness.
“Steve, fuck, I’m gonna c-” And Steve pulled his head away before Tony could finish his sentence, knowing that the ring would Tony cumming anyway.
The ice is getting closer. He’s not really aware of what he’s saying but he knows he’s talking to Peggy. He can hear the blood pumping in his head. He can feel his body shaking. He can’t move his eyes; they are stuck on the view in front of him. The massive expanse of ice growing closer and closer as every second ticks by; he can’t have many seconds left. Just about to crash, to die, the ice so close to his face and suddenly nothing.
“C’mon Steve, we’ve got some stuff to figure out.” Taking Steve’s hand in his, he leads the taller man out of the kitchen and towards his own bedroom.
“I don’t know what’s wrong between you two but I actively try to avoid drama so I’m gonna go and leave you two to sort out whatever – this – is” When he said ‘this’ he waved his arms around a bit, gesturing between the two men. As soon as he finished talking he got up and left the room, coffee cup still in hand.
The room was huge, but messy. There were bit of metal, screws, and half built gadgets lying on every surface; his desk, the shelves, the floor and even some on his bed. Steve looked around, his eyes taking in everything that he saw. He could have spent hours looking at everything, despite not knowing what any of it was supposed to do. Tony was stood near the bed, wringing his hands and watching Steve’s eyes travel across the room. Quickly realising he was ignoring Tony,  Steve turned his attention back to him. He took the few steps towards him and took his hand, guiding him to sit down on the edge of the bed as he did the same.
“Take your clothes off” It was the same voice he used when they were on a mission when he was being a captain, and he knew he much it drove Tony wild in the bedroom. It took Tony a second to react, but when he did he didn’t waste any time in taking all his clothes off his Steve. He was exactly graceful, nearly falling over when taken his trousers off, but it got the job done quicker.
“It’s okay, I didn’t mind helping you. I thought it was kind of sweet to be honest” Now it was Tony’s turn to blush as Steve looked up at him, unable to keep the surprise and hope out of his eyes. Tony laughed quietly when he saw the look on Steve’s face, unable to push the thought that Steve looked adorable like that from his mind.
He directed Steve towards the bathroom without saying a word to him. After setting Steve down on the toilet seat while he waited, Tony ran a warm bath for Steve. He was pretty sure he was going to have to bath Steve himself as Steve was in no condition to do so and Tony was worried he might accidently drown himself if left alone in the water. He decided against having bubbles, Steve wasn’t a child and this was a pretty serious situation.
He ran his nose along Tony’s jaw, one hand on his stomach with the other on the back of his neck. Placing gentle kisses along his jaw, he let his hand travel lower, resting just above Tony’s crotch; he wouldn’t do anything quite that sexual until he had Tony’s full attention and consent. With each kiss, Tony was reacting more. He now had his eyes closed, his head leaning towards Steve, silently asking for more.
Tony was still high from Steve's lips but now he was beginning to think. Him and Steve were about to have a pretty serious conversation and Tony tried to avoid serious conversations like the Black Plague. Normally, if he was with a girl, then this 'serious conversation’ would always lead to sex in a matter of minutes - that was Tony's kind of conversation. But the closer they got to the room the more Tony thought who he was with. This was Captain America, the world's golden boy, he wouldn't just be interested in a quick shag like all those female fans. He was going into a conversation about their relationship and boundaries and how their lives were going to revolve around this. This conversation was going to be a proper conversation and Tony wasn't so sure if he was okay with that.
“Are you okay, Tony?” Tony looked up at Steve’s face when he heard his name. Steve had concern written all over his face as he looked down at Tony, their faces only a few inches apart. Tony’s face was a few shades paler than usual and his eyes were dotting about all over the place, as if looking for some invisible enemy. After a few seconds his eyes settled on Steve’s face. He didn’t say anything, just nodded. They stood there for a few moments, not speaking, holding each other’s hands, before opening the door and walking into Tony's room.
Both men were completely oblivious to their surroundings, not that there was anything worth noticing. Tony had changed position so he was straddling Steve’s lap, his knees resting on the bed on either side of Steve’s hips. They were both getting quite heated, and this position gave them the pressure both men were beginning to need so desperately. Steve’s hands were beginning to pull at Tony’s shirt more and more as Tony’s hands were getting more and more violent with Steve’s hair.
“Is this helping?” Steve whispered between kisses, his hand putting more and more pressure just above Tony’s crotch.
He turned his attention back to Tony, still working away. He tried calling his name a few more times but still he got no reaction. He walked closer to Tony again and, putting his hands on either side of Tony’s shoulders, spun him around. For the first time that night, Tony looked up at Steve, a tired, empty expression on his face.
“Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck Steve please fuck” Both hands getting faster and faster, Steve knew that Tony desperately needed to cum, and decided he’d waited long enough. Taking his hand off of Tony’s cock for only a second, he pulled the cockring off and began pumping again. He added a third finger, normally as much as Tony could handle, and gave it all he had, moving his hands as fast as he could manage.
Steve sighed, taking his hand from Tony’s back. He took a minute to look around the workshop. The various work benches scattered around the edge, the expensive cars down at the other end, and, most importantly, his suits all lined up along one of the walls. Steve was amazed by all the suits, they really were  amazing.  All the different shapes, colours, all designed for a slightly different job, each one even better than the last. Looking from left to right along the wall you could really see how much Tony’s designs had improved, from that first suit built in a cave, mark 1, to Tony’s newest design, mark 42.
“And you?” Tony whispered, silently praying that Steve would say a similar answer and not something along the lines of rejecting him.
He loved them both with all his heart. He and Tony had been married for around 13 years now, and only a few months after which they adopted Peter. He thought back to the war, back when he was fighting side by side with Bucky, with technology invented by Howard Stark; if you’d asked him them, he never would have thought he’d marry Howard’s son and adopt a child together! He never even thought that sort of thing would have been possible back then in the 40s.
“You okay?” Tony just sighed in response, and Steve knew that meant he wasn’t, but he would never admit it, and that it was the stress of the job getting to him again.
Steve sighed, and pulled Tony against him again. Tony didn’t fight back, instead wrapped his arms around Steve’s waist, burying his face against Steve. They stayed silent for a while, neither man moving at all.
“What if I do this?” Steve teased, as he spent down and licked the tip of Tony’s dick, making him buck, desperately trying to get Steve to suck his dick.
He left his room and ventured towards the kitchen, in search of his morning coffee.  Walking into the kitchen, still bleary eyed, it took him a moment to notice there was already 2 people in the room. The first man was Bruce, sat at the breakfast bar sipping coffee, wearing a grey sweater and giving off the sleepy teenager vibe even though he definitely wasn’t a teenager. The second man was, of course, Tony, wearing some oily joggers and dirty white tee. He was wide awake, and no coffee was in sight, even though Tony always had a coffee in the morning. This just rubbed it in further that Tony had been awake a very long time and left Steve ages ago.  Deciding to stay quiet, Steve went straight for the coffee but before he got there Tony handed him one with an awkward smile on his face, which Steve returned.
Steve blushed again, but this time he was smiling as well. He inched forward a little more so that the gap between them was ow only about 6 inches wides. Tony smiled back up at him, eyes glued to Steve’s. The next thing Steve knew, Tony’s hand was coming up to cup the back of Steve’s neck and pulling his face down towards his. Even though he knew it was coming, Steve was still surprised when Tony’s lips landed on his. He was shocked for a moment, his eyes wide open, before he finally accepted what was happening and closed his eyes, leaning into the kiss.
Steve blushed again. He wasn’t used to having this sort of conversation with people, especially with Tony of all people. It had been a long time since he’d let himself love someone, or even just date casually. His life was too dangerous to let him get close to anyone. He’d learnt that the hard way when he’d courted Peggy. But Tony’s life was just as dangerous as his was, and that had never stopped Tony from dating, or at least having one night stands, so why should it stop Steve?
“Of course, I often get nightmares about that day that I crashed into the ice, making plans with Peggy despite knowing I was about to die. But we still have to try and function in everyday life.”Steve whispered softly. Tony was looking up at him the whole time, as though he couldn’t believe that the big strong Captain America had any weaknesses at all. Tony didn’t answer, instead he just put his head back on Steve’s chest and closed his eyes.
Steve smiled back at him, then leaned forward and kissed Tony properly, pulling him closer. He slipped his arms around Tony’s waist and pulled him closer so that Tony was sat on his lap. Tony wrapped his arms around Steve’s neck, one hand intertwining in Steve’s hair. Tony couldn’t help but think about how right this felt, how natural. All he’d wanted for the past few months was to be able to do this, and now he was he couldn’t believe it. Tony hadn’t felt this happy in a long time.
It didn’t take him long to finish making all the sandwiches. He’d made a couple BLTs for Tony, cheese and tomato for Peter and roast chicken and stuffing for himself, everyone’s favourites. Putting them on a tray, he made his way through the tower to their workshop. After balancing the tray on one hand, he punched the code in on the pad and the door swung open, letting him in. He walked over to the nearest bench and put the tray down.
“Liked you? A while now, maybe a couple of months.” Tony’s voice got quieter and quieter as he spoke, realising how vulnerable he really was right now. Steve could completely reject him right now, laugh at him and tell everyone all about how Tony had poured his heart out to him and how he’d made him look like an idiot. Deep down Tony knew that Steve would never do anything like that, he was a good guy, America’s golden boy, but that didn’t stop all his irrational thoughts from flying around his brain.
Steve seemed to pick up on Tony's panic, it was written all over his face after all, and knew he'd have to be a bit more gentle during this conversation. He didn't want to scare Tony away, he really liked him but at the same time they needed to sort out whatever this was. Tony’s hand was still in his as they walked towards his room. Steve knew why Tony was nervous, it didn’t take a rocket scientist to figure out! Everyone in the tower had seen Tony with a different girl every night and everyone had heard all the jokes about Tony just ‘talking’ to the girls when he was trying to play down what he’d done the night before. This was probably the first time Tony had ever had a proper conversation with anyone about relationships! Once outside Tony’s bedroom door, Steve paused and turned around to face Tony, taking both his hands in his.
“I don’t think you’ll be too fond of this though, love,” Steve said as he bent down to pick up the second item; a cockring. He slid it in place and sat back to admire his handiwork.
“Fuck Steve, that felt so good but please god let me cum okay? Please? I need it” Tony was almost in tears at this point; he could feel Steve’s cum pooling on his abs, and now he if he given the chance it wouldn’t take him long to cum.
“Tony…come back to me…” Steve whispered against Tony’s cheek, lips getting closer to Tony’s own. This time, Tony moaned, and Steve knew from experience that that was the signal he’d been waiting for and moved Tony’s hand slightly with his hand so he could press his lips against them. Tony’s hands moved to Steve’s waist, pulling him closer as the kiss went from slow and caring to rough and passionate.
“You know, we all get nightmares, we’ve all been through some tough stuff throughout our lives.” Steve whispered. He wasn’t entirely sure where he was going with it, but he wanted Tony to know he wasn’t alone. Tony looked up at him when he finished talking, still keeping his body pressed against Steve with his arms around his waist.
Their relationship had gone from strength to strength, and after 2 years, Tony had been the one to propose. He knew Steve loved the view from the top of Stark Tower, he loved to paint the skyline as the sun set, so Tony had made the roof as romantic as he could, flowers and candle everywhere, and when Steve had gone up to paint the perfect sunset against the skyline, he’d found Tony, down on one knee surrounded by the flowers and candles, telling him how much he meant to him and how much he needed him in his life. Of course, Steve had said yes straight away.
He continued making the sandwiches, knowing he was going to have to take them down to the workshop if he was going to get his family to eat something. Peter had definitely inherited Tony’s lack of self-preservation when working on a project. Both of them seemed to forget everything. They didn’t eat, they didn’t sleep, they didn’t shower, all they did was work. The only way Steve could ever get them to do anything was literally forcing them. Luckily, he was much stronger than them so using physical force wasn’t all that difficult.
“I believe he’s in his workshop, Captain Rogers.” JARVIS’s smooth british accent spoke throughout the room. The AI still confused Steve a bit, but he was learning to live with it. He sighed, not at all surprised at Tony’s whereabouts.
Steve and Tony glanced up at each other awkwardly, then both looked back down while laughing awkwardly. It took a minute before Steve finally broke the silence.
Steve sank his body down into the water, bending his legs at the knees, his eyes shut tight. Both men sat still for a minute; Steve with his eyes tight shut and Tony with his eyes watching Steve’s abdomen. Slowly, Steve’s body began to shake less and less as he warmed up, his face seemed to relax a bit more, even though his eyes still stayed tight shut. Tony let out a breath he didn’t know he had been holding; seeing Steve begin to relax made him relax too.
He turned his body towards Tony, pulled him closer and placed his lips on his neck. Tony didn’t react at all except for his eyes fluttering closer for a brief second. It was a start, but it wasn’t enough. They’d done this enough times, Steve knew how to distract Tony when he needed it.
It only took him a matter of minutes to get down to Tony’s workshop. He could see him through the glass, working away. He took a minute to watch Tony, before he typed the code into the keypad. Tony was bent over a table, dummy next to him, following what he was doing. He had a screwdriver in hand and was working away at something small and fiddly, his face only inches away from his work. He was wearing dark joggers and an old worn band tee. He was covered in oil and sweat, Steve couldn’t help thinking how good he looked like that. He pushed that thought to the back of his mind and walked into the room, stopping a few meters away from Tony.
said anything. Banner, Walters and Parker have probably noticed at this point, too, but whatever. They haven’t said anything either.)
Grimacing, Steve looks back at his phone. Bucky messages next which means he and Sam are having a very pertinent conversation about Steve’s love-life (what else is new?) either through text or in person. (Probably in person.)
“So, you’re definitely Steve Rogers and you’re definitely dating someone named James Barnes,” Tony flatly states. “Correct?”

“No,” Greer said, and Jess’ lower lip poked out.  Greer rolled her eyes.  “Fine.  I can use whatever help I can get.”
Steve tried not to smile. It was harder than it should've been. “The point, Mr. Stark,” he said, biting off the words with crisp precision, “is that you've rented out a six thousand seat house to plop a single child in the middle of a very grand, very empty room.”
“Yes.”  He brushed a kiss against Tony's temple, letting his lips linger there for a second.  “This is the happiest I've ever been, actually.”  He let his eyes fall shut.  “Thank you.  For the dance.”
"Not a problem.  Just unexpected."  He rocked back on his heels, his arms crossed over his chest.  Even when he was still, he gave the impression of being in motion.  Like there was some sort of energy churning in him that was barely under control.  "I wasn't aware that drafting was a skill taught by the police force."
Drew nodded, a slow, deliberate movement of his head.  “He’s…  Tony Stark’s kid,” he repeated, his voice disbelieving.
He gave a cursory look out the peephole before opening the door.  “Sorry to keep you waiting,” he said, as the steward rolled the cart in.  “Just-”  He waved at the coffee table.  “Put it there, please?”  He reached for his back pocket, remembering too late that his wallet was in the inner pocket of his tuxedo jacket.
"Because I'm the only person who'll put up with your maudlin self for more than a few hours at a time," Sam said, and he was grinning as he said it.  He bumped his shoulder against Steve's.  "And even though you are a little self-destructive-"
Jan gave him a look.  “You would,” she said, sweeping her neat, bobbed hair behind her ear.  She still had the bright, brilliant swirl of a flapper about her, as if the champagne bubbles had taken root in her blood during the twenties and now nothing could shake them loose.  She reached for her notebook, her pencil flicking over the page.  “Like two peas in a pod, you two.”
“I walked through the front door just in time for Sal to fling a pizza into the guy’s face,” Harris protested.  “All I did was pick up the gun when the robber dropped it.”
Down on the street, a massive, gleaming black car was waiting, the chrome glinting in the sunlight.  A tall, lanky black man in a neat, crisp suit was waiting next to it, his arms crossed over his broad chest.  As they approached, he straightened up, reaching for the handle of the back door.  He eyed Steve, his dark eyes sharp beneath heavy brows.  "This our escort?" he asked Miss Potts.
“As we say in my line of work, everything has a cost.  And not all costs are obvious.”  She smiled.  “Which means, you’re not afraid of me.  You’re afraid that if I proved to be a threat, you would not be able to stop me.”
“Right, because you’re dumb enough to marry someone with the codename ‘Black Widow,’” she said with a faint, crooked smile.  Her head tipped in Phil’s direction. “Apologize to Phil for telling Pepper you were eloping, because even though she is a woman of discretion and intelligence, that could’ve ended up being embarrassing as all hell for both of you.”
Steve was sprawled out on the bed, his shoulders braced on the pillows that were piled up against the headboard.  His jean clad legs were crossed at the ankles, his bare feet coming up just short of the end of the mattress.  His attention was focused on the book in his hands, and it was all so familiar and so domestic that for a second, Tony’s throat closed up.
Pepper slipped her arm through his, her fingers locking on his elbow.  "Let's all go," she said, her teeth flashing in a bright smile.
Tony settled into the chair, his back braced against the cabinets.  He let his head fall backwards.  “She didn’t help.”
“Absolutely,” Tony said.  “I’m going to put a little ball and chain on your wheelbase.  Your friends are going to have to learn how to send telegrams.  College is-” He flicked a hand through the air.  “Straight out.  If you write an essay explaining the many bad choices you’ve made, I might consider making an exception for your wedding day.”
Strange floated down to the ground, his cape settling with a disgruntled rustle of velvet.  “Clea, is it Wednesday?” he called over his shoulder.
“And I invited you,” Isaiah said with a broad smile.  “Because polite, proper citizens won’t get anything changed for us today.  You-” He reached out, poking Steve in the chest with one bony finger.  “Might just make so progress.  You’ll sure as hell make headlines.  If you’ll just unclench your teeth and step up to the damn microphone.”
“You're both delusional,” Tony said, as Marcy fell in on his other side.  He glanced from one to the other.  “Is this a flanking maneuver?” he asked, suspicious.  “Are you attempting to outflank me?”
“I don’t want to bring up the lying again-” Tony started, and she reached out, wrapping an arm around his shoulders.  When she pulled him in, he went without protest, aching down to his bones.
His chest hurt.  "I can't keep anyone safe," he said, and there was a wry note to his voice, an ache that he didn't want to examine too closely.  "Not even myself."
“I’m not talking to Steve,” Jess said.  “He left town and he didn’t call us.  We could’ve run his truck.”
DJ pushed out of his arms, scrambling down to sit next to him on the couch.  Tony offered him the cup, and this time he took it, wrapping both hands around it.  He took a drink, letting the cup linger against his lips, as if that could ward off any further questions.
Steve set the bowls of pasta and sauce on the table.  “It wasn't what I thought it was,” he admitted, with an easy smile.  “Still a good book, though.”  He wiped his hands on the apron, then untied it and slung it over the back of an unused chair.  “I liked it.”
Steve took a deep breath.  “Wondered if you have a moment to be…”  He stopped, his mouth going tight.  “I don’t know how to ask this, I’m sorry, I should-”
Somewhere above them, someone started hammering, the clatter of metal on metal echoing through the great hall.  Steve's head came up.  “Repairs?”
After a quick trip to his apartment to collect a sketchbook, Steve retraced his steps, heading down to the workshop.  He paused outside the door, just taking a moment to let his pulse settle.  Even through the glass, he could hear the driving beat of the one of Tony’s favorite albums, vibrating against his skin.  Inside, he could see Tony, surrounded by an ever expanding web of holograms.  He watched, his chest aching, as Tony moved, smooth and easy, his hands darting through the air.  His face caught the light, and he was the most beautiful thing Steve had ever seen.
Tony smiled.  “Okay.  So.  How do we make this better?”  He kicked his legs out in front of him.  “Too loud.  Too big.  Too many people.  Too much.”  He looked up, up at the ceiling above them, the germ of an idea forming in his head.  “Let’s go upstairs.”
Tony looked like he was asleep on his feet, his eyes glassy and unfocused, his skin a pasty grayish-white.  His hands shook, his breath coming in raspy, uneven bursts.  Steve glanced across the kitchen, catching Bruce's eye.  Bruce shook his head, his mouth tight.  Steve gestured in Tony's direction, his eyebrows arching.
“Don't care, and you're not dying.  You might have the flu, though,” Steve said.  Tony groaned, and it ended in a hard, painful cough.  Steve grabbed for the box of tissues that were sitting beside the bed, holding them out to Tony.  “Pretty sure you've got the flu.”
The crowd in front of him shifted laughter rippling through the group as they jostled for position.  It echoed through the foggy air, low and eerie, as the men pressed forward, their individual shapes lost in the dim light of the street lamps.  There were a dozen or more, and they were still coming.  Trickling from the dark alleys between the weathered warehouses and piles of cargo, they pressed in on him, cutting him off from any path back to the city at large.
He paused by a few doors, his footsteps slowing but never stopping.  Checking on the new wife who flinched when her husband's voice raised, when he came home swaying on his feet and smelling of cheap whiskey.  On the old man who worked all hours, his back bent as he strained to finish one last button hole in the depths of the night.  On the teenage girl who had four younger siblings, and everyone was politely ignoring the fact that no one had seen their parents in a week or more.
DJ's eyes disappeared beneath the brim of the hat, but his grin was still visible beneath it.  “Morning,” he replied, a giggle running through the word.
She laughed.  “Oh, I do like him,” she said.  “But I like her, too.”  She turned on her heel, heading up the front steps towards the door, her hips swaying.  “You might say I like them, no matter what they’re wearing.”
Stark turned, and for an instant, that was a relief, until Steve caught a glimpse of the curve of his ass in those shorts.  “Ah.  Agent.”
It was standing alone and untouched, and barely noticing the first waves that lapped against his toes.  It was watching, perhaps a bit annoyed, as the water rose around his ankles.   It was barely noticing when it hit his knees, because at that point, he was more occupied with keeping his balance as the sands shifted under his feet.  He’d take a step forward, or a step back, trying to find solid ground again, and in the meantime, the water kept rising.
“Jack of all trades, really.”  Without being asked, Clint handed over the cream pot before he tossed a heavy cast iron skillet onto the stove.  It hit like a brick, rattling the huge range.  He didn’t seem to notice.  “I have a lot of skills, and most of them…”  He spun a knife between his fingers, the blade a flash of metal and light.  “Come in useful here.”
Steve's hand shot out, catching his wrist.  “It's a dumb, it's..”  He heaved a sigh, looking very tired all of a sudden.  “I just thought it would look nice, don't make such a big deal of it.”
“It’s ‘I’m bored and you’re asking for something off the menu, so you have to humor me,’” Trip told him with a baleful look.  To his credit, he smiled.
“Yes.” The word was soft.  Steady.  Utterly implacable.  Obie fell silent, and Tony smiled.  “Yes.  I can.”  He leaned back in his chair.  “It’s possible, of course.  It’s possible that his parents are still out there, somewhere.  It’s possible that they’ve spent all these years struggling to make a life that could include him.   Making a home for him, making a place for him.  It’s possible that they’ve been working for all this time, and by some incredible, almost unbelievable, coincidence, that they’re on their way back to Hammer’s right now.
“Crab rangoon, egg foo young, shrimp chow mein, pork fried rice and General Tao's chicken,” Steve said, and Tony tried not to moan..
Apparently not.  Tony fumbled out, dragging the phone over onto the pillow.  “No,” he said, and man, his voice sounded bad, even to him.
Steve looked at Sam and Luke.  “Absolutely not,” Sam said.  “No.”  Luke just picked up a stack of boxes and walked out of the room, whistling cheerfully as he went.
The sudden shriek of an alarm echoed in the armor's helmet, drowning out whatever Gyrich was saying, and all of a sudden, Tony didn't care.  Because the robot had finally slowed, one great hand coming up.  “Target identified,” it rumbled.  “Target identified.  Surrender.”
“Doesn’t matter how good a trumpet player is if he’s going to put his foot through the bass drum ten minutes into the set,” Bobbi said, grinning.  “Or if the drummer’s going to take a cymbal to his.”
“Any number of reasons,” Miss Potts said, lifting the napkin off of the basket.  “This household doesn't keep to conventional hours.  There's always someone up, and likely as not, they're hungry.  Clint doesn't like waste, so whatever odds and ends he has leftover from the day's meals, they'll end up in the soup pot.”  She stirred her tea, giving the sugar bowl a considering glance.  “And the deliveries start before dawn.  Any number of drivers and couriers end up knocking on the back door, and few of them will turn down a meal.”
Steve caught his elbow, tugging him back around. “I love you,” he said, and Tony could swear his heart stopped beating. Steve grinned at him, wide and bright. “I love you, you make my life better, you make it easier, you-” He stopped, a flush sweeping up his cheeks. “You make me happy, and no matter how this works out, no matter what happens between us?” He smiled and it was beautiful, he was beautiful. “I'm always going to be grateful that when I asked you to marry me, you said yes.”
“There might’ve been a teddy bear or two on the invoices,” Tony said.  He rocked forward, resting his head on Steve’s shoulder.  “Tell me this is okay.”
Instead, he just leaned forward, and he knew he shouldn't do it.  He knew that.  But Tony met him halfway, their lips meeting with a surety, with a grace, that had been missing from their dance.  This was muscle memory, too, for all that he'd done it only a few times.
Turning away with a force of will, he looked around the edge of the door.  A black tuxedo jacket was hanging there, and he grabbed it, relief sweeping over him.  “You can take a shower, you know,” he said.
“Right, right,” Carol said.  “Decide what we want and set up a delivery schedule.  Have restaurants deliver every thirty minutes or every hour.  That way, something fresh is always going out, and our budget goes to the local places that we already know we like.”
“I never read it,” Nebula said, tossing paperclips at the hilt of the knife, still jammed into the wood of her desk.
Isaiah gave a snort.  “All right, then, Mr. Perfect.”  He pulled out a seat, sinking down into it with a faint groan.  “Can’t believe you made an old man chase you all the way down here.”
“I know.”  Tony pulled his shirt off, ignoring the way his back ached.  He tossed it in the general direction of the dresser.  “God.”  He rubbed at his shoulder, his fingers digging into the tense muscles there.  “No, Steve.  I don’t want you to sleep on the couch.  I’ve had my fill of sleeping alone for-.”  Forever, he wanted to say, but he knew better.  Not a smart thing to say, and he was, he’d always been told, a very smart man.  “For the foreseeable future.”  He looked up with a wry smile.  “Right now, my main regret is that the kid’s too big to come looking for a hug and a warm spot to crash.”
"Leslie, you wound me.  You-" Tony leaned forward.  "You.  Personally.  Wound me.  I thought we were friends.  I thought we had something, you and I, this can't just be on my side-"
Grinning to himself, Tony turned, looking towards the curb for the car.  A woman with a child holding onto each her hands walked in front of him, and he stepped back, out of her way.  She passed, barely glancing in his direction, and before Tony could move forward, a man stepped up, blocking his path.
Tony made a face.  “And it’ll be forgotten in a week,” he said.  “I’m not the only rich man who’s having problems with an angry public, Obie.”
He turned in Steve’s arms and gave him a lopsided smile.  “After all, you’ve had my back since we’ve met.”
“As I don’t see that as the basis of a lifelong commitment or even a particularly good short term investment, I have gently declined the offer,” Tony said.
“Between me, Richards, Jane and half a dozen of the other best scientific minds on earth, we might be able to,” Tony said.  “But not with any real confidence.  I’m not willing to risk it.”  He nodded towards DJ, even as he stabbed the straw home.  “I’m not willing to risk him.”
Obie’s smile was slight and gentle.  “Sit down,” he said, waving at the empty chair at the foot of the table.  “Before you fall down.”
“It certainly did,” Tony said.  He considered throwing his coffee cup over his shoulder into the wall.  “It abso-fucking-lutely did.”
Steve stared at him.  Sam's smile stretched.  “Turn on the charm, Steve.  Show him what you've got to offer.  Be the best husband you can manage.” He kicked his legs out in front of him. “Get out there and woo the fuck out of that man.”
Tony studied her.  She was the only one in the registration area, other than an older man in a checkered waistcoat and a cape, leaning against a nearby wall, squinting down at a clipboard.  Tony didn’t want anything to do with him, or the wooden wand tucked in the pocket of his vest.
It was clearly a photo printed off of a social media site.  Steve and Tony, in the green room of NYNN, both smiling as they kissed, their hands tangled together.  Written below it, in heavy black letters, it read, “Good job, both of you!  P.S. Dance class is now on the official team calendar.  See you on Tuesday!”  It wasn’t signed, but Steve knew Jan’s handwriting by now.
“It means you manage to knock the pins out from under me, every time,” Steve said.  He held up his hand, letting the ring catch the light.  His smile was slight, almost shy, but his eyes were brilliant.  Steve's thumb slid over the band.  “So, am I wearing this home, or are you having it wrapped up?”
Tony focused on making his legs work, Steve taking a lot of his weight.  He decided he was okay with that.  “Fuck, did I miss work yesterday?”  Everything was a hazy fog, and he was too tired to feel worried about that.  “What day is it?”
Talking to dead kids' families never got any easier. All the interns had done it at some point; they had to. Even after months of practice, having to tell the family there was nothing they could do, having them scream, wail, and sob—it never got any easier. Especially if it was a kid.
Bucky and Natasha returned with more books in hand, and the atmosphere changed as they continued their studying. There was only an hour left until Bucky needed to scrub in. Dr. Stark's craniotomy was scheduled right after.
Tony made a fuss at first, feigning weakness and the inability to walk just ten feet to the sofa in the living room. The soldier sighed, but he put on a smile and carried his husband to the living room.
Tony Stark was suave and attractive. It was no secret; everywhere he went, he could charm people in an instant. He never really liked to gloat about it, but he knew that about himself. He was always the pretty boy. (Alright, maybe he gloated to Rhodey once or twice. Or lots of times, especially when he was a drunk college kid trying to get over an ex. He was a pretty boy, thank you very much.) Pretty boys usually aren't the ones doing the pining. Usually
Megan took the glass from Steve and let her fingertips linger on his skin. "Are you still seein' that neurosurgeon?"
"It doesn't get better, Pep!" Tony bellowed. "Here you are talking about vows when you broke them! Don't you dare come to me talking about promises of how I loved you. Don't."
"Ugh. I'm so alone," she groaned, "You have Dr. Calvin Klein, Natasha clearly claimed Army Tags. I'm a loner."
The young boy in the hospital bed sat up straighter in response to seeing his favorite doctor. The boy glanced at his mom before standing up to greet Dr. Danvers with a hug. The cardiothoracic surgeon had looked so serious just moments ago, but all of that melted away when she took the boy into her arms. He squeezed her tight enough to rouse laughter from Dr. Danvers.
Alex laughed. "I'm glad they don't let you go home. You're always checking on Andy, even when I'm sleeping. Thank you for that, by the way."
"Sure thing, Pep." Tony took a sip and sighed in content. "Want some? The coffee places Steve goes to is great, you know."
"You said you loved me." Pepper was angry now. There were still tears, but her eyes burned this time. "It might feel like a lifetime ago, but once, you said you loved me. For better or for worse, Tony, please, this is the worst of it. There will be better after this if you'd just listen to me!"
"Can't do that in a restaurant, now can we?" Tony's smile was just so bright and pretty, how on earth was he not a real model? The sight still knocked the wind right out of Steve's lungs.
Steve nodded, grabbing his chart and pausing in the doorway of the patient room. "You aren't alone, by the way."
"We're stopping here and then going to get dinner," Tony said sternly. "Just a cat car seat. Or something that'll hold you down since you're crazy and won't sit still."
Steve took a step back and forced a smile. "I know. It'll all be fine. I just get panicky, but I'm fine."
a mistake. I was happy, Pepper. I'm sorry if I hurt you, but I know that being with Steve was not a mistake."
Steve can’t help but smile as Tony curls up against him in the sheets. He’s not really a morning person, but it’s days like these, seeing the same brunet pressed against him and exchanging sleepy kisses that make it okay again. Tony always makes everything better again.
"It's not weird," Bucky replied simply, "Anyways, just give me some fries and your secret is safe with me."
Steve only nodded in response, letting Pepper and Alex take a closer look at the child. Alex's eyes watered a little upon seeing all the tubes and wires that were connected to her baby. Pepper explained that they were all helpful to the baby's development, but no parent ever listened, not really. The medical jargon was already hard enough to understand, and parents were far too focused on their child to think about anything else.
"Thank you, Dr. Rogers. I appreciate it. It's been so scary," she said, voice trembling a little, "I sit here and watch her breathe, and I'm scared to let myself sleep. I only napped since a nurse said her vitals were good for now."
"Yes indeed, I am." Tony smiled, the same affectionate smile from this morning. "Good to see you again."
"We have one! We have a heart!" She threw her arms around Steve. "Someone from Northwestern is bringing the heart right now. They said they'd be in the lobby in twenty minutes!"
"He was looking for you," Dr. Rhodes continued. "I mentioned I would find you if I ran into you, so..."
" Steve sighed in exasperation. "I can't keep fighting you on this, saying the same thing over and over—Tony, this has got to stop!"
It was the Captain Rogers look. Everyone (mostly Tony) teased him for how he always had the same furrowed brows, the crossed arms, looking like a disappointed grandpa. He knew that Steve meant well, but now that he was sitting here on the bed, not wanting to reveal how sick he was, he really just wanted Rogers to stop giving him that damn look.
"Don't say anything, okay?" This time, Pepper's voice wavered. Those beautiful blue eyes of hers were watering now, but still, she forced a smile. "I know, Tones."
When Steve arrives in the fine arts building, he decides to stray from his usual study area on the first floor to venture up to the higher levels. The fine arts building is right near the quad of the campus, and he decides to devote the day to sketching for another class.
"I meant to warn you," Wilson said, "you do not question Carol Danvers. She's one of the best in the country; she knows more than you ever will."
They had barely eaten breakfast together; the first omelet burned once Steve had gotten busy on his knees. The couple then again tried to enjoy the pancakes that they whipped up, but Steve had been winking throughout the entire meal, and Tony practically drooled at the thought of what else the intern's mouth could do.
"She was...someone from a little while ago," Steve said simply. "We were together and now we aren't."
It’s him, fingers extended as he plays the exact piano that stands before him. The details are so intricate, so exact, Tony wonders for a moment of someone had taken a photograph of him; it’s so perfect, it’s surreal. The way his hair falls, the way his glasses slip on his nose as he looks down at the notes, the way his fingers curl against the black and ivory keys; it’s breathtaking.
He spotted some of the interns from the mixer, gathered at one of the booths. They seemed to have created their own little groups already, and Steve didn't feel quite comfortable just jumping in and joining them. The blond decided to take a seat at the bar, smiling at the same bar tender who served him his first legal drink.
Those same interns invited him to the bar that night after the party, and while he wanted to, he didn't want to be distracted. They insisted it would only be a few drinks, but Steve waved them off, smiling and reassuring them he'd see them the next day, only he'd be the one without a headache.
Tony’s arms are around him, but Steve’s never felt lonelier. He tries to ignore it. He’ll play along, he’ll be happy—Tony is going to change the world someday. He needs to let him go.
Bucky's voice grew a little loud enough for the surrounding people to hear. People whispered among themselves, snickering a little. There was a sheepish, apologetic look on the soldier's face, and he sunk into the couch upon seeing Steve's reaction.
"You shouldn't be alone in that apartment," Natasha continued. "Before you say no, Bucky fixes things. Sharon bakes. And I'm good with the cleaning. Plus we can split up the rent."
The interns stashed the rest of their lunches in their pockets before rushing to the library together. They picked up everything there was to know about subdural hematomas and appendectomies. Books and files were spread across the tables among sandwiches and french fries. Bucky's anxiety was almost tangible; Natasha nudged him under the table.
Steve threw an arm around Bucky's shoulder. "You'll be fine, Army Tags. We'll study right now. Let's go."
Bucky slumped down on the gurney next to Natasha, and Steve found his place next to Sharon. Natasha's nose crinkled up in disgust when she saw a bit of the rectal gel on Bucky's coat.
Steve and Alex went to check on the child before the intern's shift ended. Soon he bid goodnight to the mother, giving her a hug and saying goodnight to Andy as well. The infant squeezed his finger before he left, and Steve was content.
Steve can’t stop his smile now as Tony’s crawling back into bed, pulling the sheets back and curling up right up against his chest. Strong arms immediately engulf Tony, and he sighs, realizing that he’s still kind of tired, too.
Bucky came around the corner with two beers beer in hand and wrapped his arm around Natasha, who leaned against him. Steve raised his eyebrows at the soldier and smirked.
"I'm trying to be civil, or something like that," Steve said, "I just...I don't know. I'm tired of being pissed about everything. It feels better to be friendly instead of avoiding him and being angry all the time."
What was it about a mother's voice that could bring someone to tears after having a bad day? Steve hadn't even turned around yet, but he was ready to collapse into his mother's arms and burst into tears.
The moment of peace was brief, and the echoes of the monitor brought them back to reality. Across the station, Katie's vitals immediately crashed and seizing began.
Steve laughed and hugged her tight once more. "I'll see you in two weeks. Don't you forget about me while I'm gone."
Tony paled. "I know. I wanted to tell you. I did. There were so many times, it's just...complicated."
The radiologist looked impatient, but fortunately, there was no lecture on waiting around. Steve was just happy that Dr. Wilson wasn't around to chew his ass out. Once the scans were taken, Steve took the complaining teenager back to her room.
“You.” The blonde leans in against, this time pressing his lips to Tony’s. “I wanna to go bed, and I need someone to keep the blankets warm.”
The man chuckled abruptly, and Steve felt foolish until the man gave him a soft smile. "We don't have to do anything. I can just be the guy at the bar, and that'll be it."
Before Tony can protest, he’s cut off by the swift motion of Steve sweeping him off his feet. Tony sighs leaning in against Steve’s neck, eyes suddenly heavy with fatigue. He can feel Steve laughing a little bit as he becomes drowsy his arms.
Cheeseburger tilted his head, as if suddenly interested in the idea. Tony nodded and continued, babbling on and on to the kitten, who seemed pleased with all the attention and ear scratching.
Steve had spent the better part of a year trying to get over that girl. They had met during undergrad; they were both tutors for the science department. Steve had always teased that she should pursue medicine like he was—she always claimed that she wasn't as smart as him.
"I-I was assigned to Laura Peterson's case." The voice was shaky, but it was unmistakable. "It's Steve Rogers. I'm looking for Dr. Potts-Stark; I need the post op charts."
Unfortunately, his daydreaming was cut off by the last person that he wanted to see—Dr. Potts-Stark.
Bucky nodded. "Tell all the interns. And maybe the nurses—" Steve nudged him and he groaned in response— "j-just the interns."
"Pep doesn't drink much coffee," Tony lied, stepping a bit closer. "Heard you're off saving babies for this rotation."
Cheeseburger meowed loudly, pawing at Steve's ankles. The soldier picked up the kitten and cooed. "I missed you, too! Looks like Tony played nice after all."
"This is not friendly coffee, Steve! This is very clearly forgive-me-please-and-let-me-kiss-you-while-I-go-home-to-my-wife coffee!" Natasha threw her hands up in the air as if it should have been clear at this point.
The smile returned to Tony’s face once he finished the conversation with Steve. “Anyway, let me know how you and Eva like the recipe. Supposed to be one hell of a dish. I’ll see you all later.”
She seemed slightly annoyed with the nurse that she was speaking to. Hearing her voice snapped the intern out of his trances, and he couldn't help but smile as he heard Eva's choice.
Christmas decor lined the hallways of Chicago Medical Hospital. There was a bit of snow sprinkling the streets, too; there was usually something magical about the way a city glittered during the holiday season. The holiday wasn’t due for a few weeks, but with the decorations and the snow that dusted the rooftops, everyone was ready for Christmas.
"What made you change your mind?" Fury looked at the neurosurgeon curiously. "I know they pay big money in New York."
Tony raised his finger tips a little, waving them slightly. Steve waved back, motioning for him to come into the nursery. Tony never moved so quickly in his life.
"Let me get my laptop from my locker. We can stream some movies and stuff," Steve said with a smile. "Maybe I'll rent a movie online for you. My treat."
As he wandered the store, he encountered Bucky and Nat. The pair were giggling softly to each other, hushed and adorable. God, it was almost too cute to look at them; they were bonding in the goddamn soup aisle. He hated the twinge of melancholy he felt as he watched them. They were in their own little world—just the two of them.
Alright, so maybe Tony was his boyfriend. He acted like one; he pressed kisses to Steve's lips before heading out the door, as if it was a casual thing they did every morning. They'd steal kisses in the on-call rooms or stairwells, they held hands outside of work when they went on dates. Their relationship—or whatever it was at the moment—was picture perfect, something out of a romantic comedy special. Although Steve didn't like to admit it, it was fun to be dating again. It took the insane pressures of work off Steve's back for a few hours every day.
Pepper was shy, somehow. Barely eating, taking tiny sips of her wine and timidly speaking as the night carried on. Like she was walking on glass, and she didn't want to risk breaking anything by getting ahead of herself. She wasn't usually so shy; the sight reminded Tony of their first date.
Once the neurosurgeon fell asleep, Steve took it upon himself to move him to a private room rather than letting him spend the night in the pit. After alerting the charge nurses of the move, he instructed them to page Rhodes once the patient woke up.
Tony scoffed, dropping his hands from her grasp. "A mistake. You make it sound so simple. Like something you can fix."
Steve frowned. "I'm going to grab a thermometer. If you have a fever, I'm having FRIDAY lock down the tower just so you can finally get some rest."
Except that she was. Eva was more than just a good student getting good grades—she was an amazing tutor and mentor to everyone that ever asked her for help. She said that she always wanted to be a teacher; Steve thought that that was perfect for her. No matter how busy she was with her own studies, anyone who asked her for help was welcome.
The man behind the table didn’t even blink.  If anything, his face seemed to relax, smoothing out into a lopsided smile.  “Huh.  Well.”  He cleared his throat.  “That’s…  Quite a magic word.”
DJ returned from the house with the others close behind him, his arms wrapped tight around a large, leatherbound book.  He crashed down on the quilt next to Steve, holding it out with a grin.  Steve took it from him. “What'd you find?” he asked, turning it over in his hands.  It was a large anthology of fairy tales, each page illustrated with glorious color pictures.  “Okay.  Want to pick a story?”
It barely counted as a kiss.  If there was contact, it was fleeting, delicate, the brush of lips against lips for a bare second.  But when it was done, the bravest, stupidest thing he’d ever done, he lingered, Tony’s breath warm on his mouth.  When Tony sucked in a long, uneven breath, Steve felt it, felt it against every inch of his skin.
"Thank you, so much, for that vote of confidence."  Sue pulled out a pack of baby wipes and held them up.  "Come here, I'll clean you up without water.”
“Cool, this is all cool, in a very horrifying way,” Tony said to Fury.  “And I’m going to get you for involving me in this.”
Steve nodded, and Tony studied the sharp, hard line of his jaw, the angle of his brow.  He set down his welding torch, letting it drop to the workbench from just enough of a height so it would clatter against the steel top.  It wasn’t much.  But it was enough to get Steve’s attention.  He looked over, and Tony smiled at him, stripping off his gloves.  “Right.  We’re-” His head tipped in Steve’s direction.  “Mostly Steve, honestly, but we’re working on some other angles.”
Tony relaxed back into the couch as Steve frowned down at the thermometer.  “Ah, I've seen you've met Bucky,” he said to Eli, who burst out laughing.
"Probably not."  But Tony paused at the base of the stairs, letting Obie pull him in for a back-thumping hug.  "Seriously.  What are you doing-"
In the silence that followed, he tucked his hands in his pockets and wandered off towards the street.  “You'll be hearing from me.”  He glanced back over his shoulder at them.  “Soon.”
The man went flying, his body hitting the pavement hard, and bouncing.  Steve stomped down on an ugly sense of satisfaction.  Through the crowd, people darting away, ducking and running for any available cover, he saw Happy and Rhodes pushing their way out from the street.  “Get him out of here!” he yelled, and to their credit, they were doing that before Steve finished saying it.
He took a step away, and another, and dropped into a kitchen chair.  “Of course you are,” he repeated, his head falling into his hands.  “Okay.  That was…”  He laughed again, and it didn’t sound like a laugh anymore.  “That was kind of an overreaction, wasn’t it?”
DJ's face fell, and Tony gave him a rueful smile.  “Had enough of that last night, I take it.”  He looked down at the page, where a clear outline of a swing had emerged from the scribbled lines.  “Right.”  He pushed himself to his feet, and headed for the door, punching the call button before turning back to face them.  “You should have a picnic.”
Tony nodded.  “Right.  I’m not sleeping on the couch, as comfortable as it looks,” he said, trying to keep his voice light.
Obie took it, turning back to the sideboard to set it down.  “I consider this less being a bad influence, and more of admitting even the Irish may be right on occasion.”  He poured in a hefty splash of whiskey and turned back to Tony, swirling the cup in one hand.  “Besides, you’re so tense it looks like you might shatter if I breathe on you.”
“Ain't saying he's always right, but he's got ears everywhere,” Seamus pointed out. “But he said a big, cheerful looking fella came calling yesterday, and made Mr. Hammer quite the offer.”
Happy just considered the arrow, an easy smile on his face.  “Wasn’t that just a beautiful shot?  It would be, of course.”  He reached behind him, his hand closing on the shaft of the arrow.   He wrenched it free, tearing a shower of splinters along with it.
Isaiah clutched at his chest.  “This is the way you talk to an old man?” he asked, and Eli was trying not to laugh, a hand clamped over his mouth as his grandfather staggered, his face shocked.  “I'm trying to make nice with your boy, and this is how you-”
He shoved a hand through his hair.  "Not at all," he admitted with a faint smile.  "Thanks.  Though.  For this."  He looked across the polished marble floor.  "This is...  This is amazing, Jan."
“Nothing!” Bruce said, with more force than was absolutely necessary.  Everyone stared at him.  He took a breath.  “Okay.  So.  There might've been more alcohol in the punch than I'd realized.  It was a scientific symposium, I wasn't expecting the punch to be spiked.”
Tony’s stomach rolled over.  “I don’t want to be needed, it’s, it’s very stressful, that’s not something I want to handle, I don’t think that’s something I can handle.”
She nodded, a tiny dip of her chin.  "Yeah," she said.  She sniffed, and rubbed the back of her wrist against her nose.  "Yeah.  I think so."
She made a see-saw motion with her hand in the air.  "I'm too exhausted for anything strenuous," she said with a wry smile.  "But still.  I object."
“Wait,” he said, his eyes narrowing.  “At the theater.  Seamus said you said that Hammer’d been talking to someone.  Someone who’d made him an offer.”  He paused.  “I thought he was talking about Hogan here.  He wasn’t, was he.”
“Mr. Morrison?” Steve looked at him. His teeth flashed in a brilliant smile. “Be glad you're only dealing with me.”
Tony tried to swallow, but his throat felt like sand.  “Won’t.  Get out,” he managed, the words forced past a mouth that refused to help him.
“He usually has a point, though,” Shawn said.  Drew gave him a look, and Shawn shrugged.  “Sorry.  True, though.”
DJ snuggled down in his nest of blankets, a smile tugging at the corners of his mouth.  "Don't care."
“Well, it would appear that someone pulled another set of strings to get him sent back home,” Happy said, leaning up against the car, his arms crossed over his chest.  “He got his marching orders this afternoon.”
DJ leaned forward, his arms going around Tony's neck with sudden, desperate strength.  He latched on, and Tony wrapped his arms around him, holding on tight.  “Someone is coming for you,” he whispered.  “Always.  And if you find yourself back in that box, and I'm sorry, I'm so sorry, baby, I hope you never do, but if you do-”
Obie sighed.  “It’s been a while since you’ve put in an appearance,” he said, and there was a gently chiding note to his voice.
“I had thought so as well, as it turns out, I was incorrect,” Stephen said with a tight smile.  “As you might find you are.”
Tony jumped, and Steve realized that had come out too loud, too hard, the words forced past the lump in his throat, past clenched teeth.  It echoed in the empty kitchen, leaving a strange, pained silence in its wake.
“Hi,” Steve said, and movement in the parking lot below him caught Tony's attention.  He leaned forward, somehow not surprised to find Steve standing there, looking painfully attractive in a pair of jeans and a skin-tight white t-shirt.  He had a plastic bag in one hand and his phone in the other, and even from this distance, Tony could see the hopeful, lopsided smile on his face.
“I'm on it.” Eli dropped into the arm chair across from Tony.  Tony glared at him, and Eli grinned.  “Sorry, man, I owe him, so...  Just sit your ass down, okay?”
“Nonsense, we’ll have this sorted in just a moment.”  Strange smiled at him, his eyes crinkling at the corners.  “And the library has a number of protections on it.  You know that.  You’ll be safe there, I promise.”
Steve paused on the second floor landing, looking out across the rolling grounds.  Here and there, he could see men patrolling, their positions marked by the glow of lanterns and flashlights.  The walls appeared through the gloom, caught in slim circles of light.  He looked down, beside the gardens, but the greenhouse was exempt from the nocturnal movements.  It was as still and silent as the house, the windows gleaming in the pale moonlight.
Rhodey shrugged, his mouth curled up in a faint smile.  “What?  I'm just here to bribe the kid with donuts.”  He folded his arms on the edge of the workbench, leaning into them.  “Pepper offered me a ride.”
“I think it might be a bit different when it's not someone leaning out of a speeding taxi,” Victor said.
He didn’t know he was going to say it until he did.  He didn’t know why he said it, until he had.  Red metal.  The Roomba.  The chaos.
“When you make them, when you taste one, is that all tied up in the person who taught you?” Rhodey asked.  “On some level, can you fully separate the gift of the recipe, of the knowledge of how you make it, from the person who gave it to you first?”
“You would notice that,” Franklin said.  He stretched out a leg, bumping DJ's foot with his.  “You okay?”
Steve's mouth twitched, a soft, sad smile.  “I'm pretty sure that makes you a parent, Sue.  One who loves her children.”
“She’s very disconcerting,” Tony said to Charlie.  Bruce stood up, trying to wander in the general direction of the door without appearing to move towards the door. It was a pathetic attempt.  Tony snapped his fingers, and Bruce glanced at him then quickly away.
"Often enough."  She waved a hand above them, at the building in general.  "We're kind of a big target, for a lot of people.  Jarvis will let him know if we've got a particularly stubborn one, or if he's not around, he'll notify us.  We make sure they at least leave with a chance."  She shook her head.  "It's not a perfect system, but if we can get them to the shelter, they can give these kids a safe place to get things sorted out.  More than food or shelter, some of them need counseling, they need acceptance."
Tony looked at him, his eyes hidden behind the mirrored lenses of his borrowed sunglasses.  “The price tag on this is definitely lower than I’d expected,” he said.  He reached up, adjusting his baseball cap.  He’d chosen a Dodgers cap, and Steve loved him for it.  “And I wasn’t forced to invite anyone I hate, so that’s definitely a plus.”
“I made your favourite, bud” Steve spoke, laughing when Peter dived for the sandwich and began eating it as fast as he possibly could. He passed Tony one of his sandwiches, silently encouraging him to eat, which he did, but with only one hand so he could keep himself wrapped around Steve.
Steve was just beginning to unbutton Tony’s shirt as he moved his lips down to his neck, gently biting and kissing Tony’s skin as he went. Tony was gasping as Steve’s teeth dug into his skin repeatedly. The last button on Tony’s shirt had been undone and Steve pushed it down over his shoulders and onto the floor. He brought his lips away from Tony and took a minute to take in his naked torso. Tony took the opportunity to begin planting little kisses along Steve’s jaw, causing Steve to let out a little moan as his eyes fluttered shut.
And this time Tony did react; he didn’t stop walking away but paused briefly before slowing his walk considerably, allowing Steve to catch up with him. Within a second or two, Steve was by his side, placing a hand on Tony’s arm as he joined him.
you awhile ago” Steve was looking down at both his hands and blushing while he spoke. Tony noticing that Steve blushed all the way down his neck and couldn’t help wondering if Steve was a full body blusher. He quickly pushed the thought from his mind, now was a time to be serious. Imagining Steve naked, as fun as it would be, wouldn’t help this conversation.
Flying overhead, Tony could see everything going on down below. He was focused on the fight, shooting at the enemy from above, but he was still keeping an eye on Steve. Tony could distance himself from the action, shooting down the enemies from afar, but Steve was always right there in the middle of the action, throwing punches left right and center. There was always much more chance of Steve getting hurt than Tony. Of course, Tony had been getting more and more protective of Captain America, despite knowing he could handle himself amazingly well in a fight, but now that Steve was his, that protective instinct seemed to multiply.
Neither had Steve. Apart from Tony, he hadn’t kissed anyone in a very long time. There had been a few girls he had begun getting close to since defrosting, but it was difficult to find someone with shared experiences so nothing ever happened. It had never felt quite right, not since Peggy, but this did. Maybe every girl since had reminded him too much of Peggy but at the same time reminded him that he could never have her? Maybe it was something else entirely, he wasn’t sure. But what he did know for sure was that this felt right. Maybe, being with Tony gave him the change he needed. Maybe, Tony was just different enough that he wouldn’t make him think of Peggy every time he looked at him and instead make him think of how happy he could be with this man.
“You don’t have to be so nervous Tony, I’m not going to attack you…” Steve said softly, still holding Tony’s hand. The smaller man was still obviously nervous but he knew Steve would never even consider hurting him. They both sat in silence for a few minutes as neither man really knew what to say. They knew what they needed to talk about but neither knew how to start that conversation. After a few minutes it was Steve who broke the silence.
“Fuck” Steve whispered, as Tony just moaned at the sudden warmth surrounding him. Steve lifted himself back up, before sliding back down slowing again, still getting used to Tony’s size. Before long, Steve was bouncing up and down on Tony’ cock like his life depended on it.
Peter was the best thing in their life right now. He was beginning to grow up, he’d be a fully-fledged teenager soon and they knew to expect him to start rebelling and distancing himself from his dads so they were trying to make the most of every day they got with him.
Ignoring his growing embarrassment, Tony helped Steve towards the tub. Tony couldn’t help but notice how little Steve cared that he was totally naked in front of his teammate. Tony was sure his face was glowing red as he helped Steve into the tub; the poor man was still shaking. He was beginning to wish he had put some bubbles in the bath, that way they might preserve Steve’s dignity a little longer.
“I can’t help it, you mean a lot to me and I don’t want you to get hurt. But that doesn’t mean I’m going to stop you from fighting. You’re Captain America, you know what you’re doing” Tony said, saying much more than he was expecting himself to, but realising it was true as he said it.
“Tony, fuck, you feel so good” Tony had lost all capacity for word by this point, and just moaned in response, silently begging Steve for more.
“Thanks Jarvis.” Steve mumbled as he threw the covers off and sat up. He didn’t particularly want to go and fetch Tony, he wanted to go back to sleep, but he knew he was going to go anyway. If Tony was ever left to his own devices, he would completely forgot to eat and sleep and wash for days on end. He’d be too focused on whatever it was he was building to remember to look after himself.
Neither man said anything for a minute; Tony was lost in his own head and Steve was desperately trying to think of a way to draw him out of it. He had an idea, it wasn’t much, but it might just do the trick.
Watching them now, seeing how happy they were together, Steve felt nothing could ever go wrong, nothing would ever break them apart, no matter how hard the world tried to do so. Of course they would have their rough patches, where Steve and Tony would argue with each other, or with Peter, or when one of them got especially hurt fighting and the others would be worried sick about them, but they would always make it through, Steve was sure of it.
There was a fridge in the corner, so Steve walked over and took out three drink – a bottle of water for himself and a can of coke each for Tony and Peter. He placed them down next to the word and watched his family for a few minutes. He was aware that neither Tony or Peter had noticed him there, they were much too wrapped up in their conversation, and that gave him the perfect chance to fully appreciate them.
Tony jumped slightly when Steve’s palm touched his back, dropping the screwdriver onto the table with a small clang. He stood still for a moment, his empty hand still thinking it was holding the screwdriver, a mildly confused expression on his face. Then, still not registering Steve, he picked up the screwdriver again and began working again, as though Steve wasn’t even there.
“How long have you..?” He didn’t finish the question before he started to blush. Tony mentally scolded himself, as force of habit, for unconsciously noting how adorable Steve looked when he was embarrassed, before realising that it was probably okay to think about him this way now, given the circumstances.
“Steve, talk to me. What’s wrong?” Tony asked; his voice calm and quiet, his eyes gentle and searching, looking for clues as to what could be wrong.
Whilst Tony was slowly coming down from his high, Steve pulled his hand out of him and wiped both his hands on the bedsheet; they could change it later. He reached down to unfasten Tony’s ankles then did the same for his wrists before lying down next to Tony and caressing his hair.
“YES YES OKAY jesus” Tony shouted back, incredibly frustrated. Both men looked at each other and sighed. Tony gave Steve a quick kiss on the lips before he got off his lap and stood up, taking Steve’s hand and pulling him up with him.
“Steve, buddy, it’s okay. Don’t worry about it. I get nightmares too sometimes; we all need a little looking after occasionally. I just can’t believe I gave you a bath, I saw you naked” Tony spoke with a slight hysterical/amused laugh. He didn’t mind what had happened yesterday, it was just a bit strange between the two of them now. Steve blushed bright red at Tony’s words, remembering how Tony had even helped him get undressed and dressed again. Tony quickly noticed Steve’s embarrassment.
“You – You thought it was… Sweet?”  Steve questioned, unable to keep the mixture of confusion and hope out of his voice.
“Fuck Steveee, keep doing that” And keep doing that he did, getting faster and faster as time went on.
“Tony..?Tony, are you okay?” Tony’s hands were still resting on Tony’s shoulders as spoke gently, trying to get through to him. Tony didn’t say anything, he just shook his head slightly and leaned into Steve, his forehead resting on Steve’s shoulder. Steve didn’t try and stop him, instead he wrapped his arms around him and pulled him close. He didn’t say anything for a few minutes, just holding Tony. Steve’s bare chest was warming up with Tony’s warm form leaning against him.
Heaving another one of his weight-of-the-world sighs, Tony points at Peter with two fingers, “I need you to tell me if my readings are too hot.”

to hear about it and then would probably spend the next few days venting his mixed emotions about his best friend dating his other best friend’s ex-girlfriend.
“I'm obviously a millennial, what with my incessant need to kill the restaurant industry and addiction to Starbucks.” Tony shrugs both shoulders. “I'm twenty-seven.”
Jen almost smirks. Thor’s really cute. In general, of course. Anyone with half a brain can see how attractive the guy really is, but the way he looks at Bruce is just

because it’s far too quiet. Even her criminal justice homework does little to keep her attention; she’s spent the last hour nodding off in the corner, bits of drool staining her papers because she’s long given up worrying if they’ll be destroyed in any flash flood.

Standing above him is Jennifer Walters. She’s also not wearing a jacket and her long, dark hair is in shambles. She wrings her hands, her equally dark eyes wide. “I know you don’t know me, but uh, I just – I was wondering if we could talk for a moment.”
He gulps down another shot and wipes his mouth with his sleeve. It does little to slow his racing heart. “We’ll see what happens, I guess.”
Oh, okay. Good. Steve’s body relaxes. Everything is good. He forces a laugh, dragging a hand through his hair. “People just see what they wanna see, I suppose,” he says.
“Y’know,” Natasha says, absently rubbing Steve’s back; it seems to offer little comfort. He doesn’t budge. If anything, he looks like he’s trying to burrow
Surprisingly, Tony laughs. It’s a short, breathy chuckle, but it counts. And though Steve’s pretty sure he’s just asked the world’s weirdest question, he doesn’t mind as warmth spreads from the top of his head to the tips of his toes. If he can just hear that laugh again, all will be right in the world.

“Sorry!” Steve quickly says, holding up his hands. His phone flies out of his grip, landing smack dab on Bucky’s forehead.
Steve would call this a late start, but Steve’s also insane and gets up at the ass crack of dawn, most days.
“We have,” she eagerly says, finally meeting Bruce’s eyes. His expression is static, and she frowns. “But uh, I should – I’ll let you guys get back to work. Looks like you’ve got a lot on your plate.”
Sam pauses in his quest to dip his French fry in the ketchup overtaking half of Becca’s plate. “We’ll what now? I don’t wanna go all the way to Brooklyn.”
“So…” he says, rapping his eraser against the edge of the table. “You never did tell me what you’re working on, exactly.” It’s unlikely that Tony tears his eyes away from his phone long enough to even send Peter the slightest side-eye, but Peter still avoids looking up from his homework. Subtly never has been his forte.

Somewhere in the midst of drunk college students, Sam’s booming laughter rang out. Steve looked to find Sam standing in a half-circle with a few others; Sam’s arm was draped around a short, dark-haired girl’s shoulder.
“Nope.” Steve set the brush down and smiled, finally meeting Bucky’s eyes. He seemed a little too pleased with himself. “Just you.”
“I ran into her at a coffee shop.” She doesn’t dare lift her gaze from the papers, even if her brain can’t comprehend a word right now. “And she may have mentioned a guy. A guy named James. That she might be seeing.”
“He just brought something to my attention,” she continues, still frowning. She isn’t fidgeting her hands anymore though; they’re tucked under her armpits and it’s hard to say if it’s
When she looks back at Tony, he’s still staring at her, though his expression is less menacing, more… surprised. He nods at Bruce, quirking his eyebrows. On almost anyone else, she’d deem the motion unreadable, but on Tony –
“I don’t know,” she mutters, her gaze straying to her own feet. She’s still wearing her ballet slippers. “I guess – I dunno, I guess I just didn’t want them to think that I was just sitting around, crying my eyes out over him or something. That’s just pathetic.”

“Everyone deserves one.” Beth looks to Bruce, but he seems more inclined to stare at his hands. They’re still shaking, though he isn’t tearing anymore napkins apart. He’s just staring at his palms, eyes half-mast, like he’s grown bored of their existence. “Um, just let me know if you need anything else,” she eventually says, smile fading.
Hell, Bucky is too and he might have, kinda-sorta had a crush on Sam Wilson at one point. Like, a million years ago. (Not

,” Steve said, his voice strained. He set the brush down on the table and flipped the canvas around. “What d’you think?”
Steve raises an eyebrow, but doesn’t comment. It’s not worth the fuss. Instead, he takes small sips out of his glass and checks the décor: Fairy lights and plastic jack-o-lanterns illuminate the bar, while a set of pumpkin-themed curtains poorly cover the front window. If it weren't for the scent of cigarette smoke wafting through the air, Steve would consider it a good effort. Josie's is still a seedy joint, always will be, always loaded with odd characters that

A couple minutes later, the pair were back in Bucky’s car. Tony immediately rested his cheek against the window, eyes squeezed shut. “Thanks, I guess.” He held out a hand; Steve ignored it. “Tony.”

He had an indistinguishable sort of neutral expression overtake his features as he dug the toe of his sneaker into the carpet; Steve was an enigma, alright. “Okay, Buck,” he said quietly. He glanced at his watch. “I gotta go meet Pegs pretty soon.”
“If it were literally anyone else,” Bruce says, pinching the bridge of his nose, “I’d assume he was building it for a science fair or something. His father used to hold Modern Marvel expos, I guess.”
to long for something new or even just something familiar. He’d avoided Peggy’s last call, sending it straight to voicemail. She hadn’t tried since, and he couldn’t even blame her.

“Yes,” she says, expelling a breath. “I’m seeing someone, and I wasn’t sure how to tell you. I haven’t even told MJ either though, so –”
He visibly flinches, staring at the table. At least he isn’t making it snow by tearing up another hapless napkin. “I couldn’t,” he mutters. “She would’ve just blamed herself.”
Thor chuckles. It’s genuine, though not confident. He shifts his weight between legs. “Yes, I really do. I have a project in – in my history class, and I asked for Bruce’s help because you know, he’s smart. He’s very – smart.” He finishes lamely, his cheeks flushed.

Scribbled below his name is a phone number.

“Of course!” Tony returns the grin, ten-fold, and Steve wonders if he’s died and gone to Heaven. “I’ve always loved art. It’s a way of expression, y’know? Less dangerous than my own anyway.” He coughs lightly into his free hand. “I consider myself a bit of an amateur scientist. Which I think

For several seconds, Tony doesn’t say a word. He watches the road closely, sitting up straighter in his seat, like he’s forgotten where his own house is. Everything’s a bit of a blur under the guise of nothing more than the headlights and evening stars, but then he says, “Just for that, you’re sleeping on the couch.”
“You’re just lookin’ a bit red, Pete.” Wade frowns, pressing a hand to Peter's forehead. “You’re kinda warm. Do you want some water or something?”

Beside him, Steve hadn’t said a word. He had an ice pack of his own and kept it nearly stapled to his temple.
, Steve just shakes his head. “You don’t gotta treat me like I’m made of glass, Buck.” He looks back at Tony, Banner and Walters; they’re all crowded around a single piece of paper, it seems, and Steve can’t help but wonder if he’d be able to keep up with their conversation anyway.
“I’m feeling a bit disrespected,” Bruce lifts his head to readjust his glasses. “I’d hope most people know I have better taste than that.”
Bruce, on the other hand, just seems weary. The creases on his face make him seem so much older. “Don’t tell me you’ve picked up

Bucky rolls his eyes. He hasn’t been called anyone’s boyfriend in a long while, but this isn’t exactly what he’s had in mind. “Punk was up and out before I even woke up.” He waves a hand toward the empty bed; the sheets are catastrophically crumpled at the foot of the mattress, a catacomb of pillows laying some two feet away. “He’s just makin’ this thing feel like a
at the tip of his tongue. He glances at the lone headphone in Wade’s ear. Faint music pours out of the other one lying on the bed; it vaguely sounds like an 80s pop ballad, but it’s hard to tell.
He can’t even bring himself to argue when Sam suggests a trip to Josie’s. It’s been a hot minute since Steve’s even touched alcohol, let alone been to a bar. He’ll be far too jittery to sleep anyway, so maybe a nice rum will calm his nerves. Even if he goes to a seedy joint in the middle of Hell’s Kitchen to get it.
There was a bit of comfort in having people who didn't judge him right away. Ever since he had come out in high school, there was always a bit of judgement, especially among his male friends. Whether it was deliberate or an unconscious decision, it still stung. Sure, coming out got easier as he grew up, but it was nice to have friends who immediately accepted him.
"Book an OR now," The doctor instructed. She turned back to her patient, putting her stethoscope to the woman's chest.
"I—I don't finish my shift until tomorrow," Steve replied, "they make the interns stay for forty-eight hours."
"Dr. Rogers, I'll meet you at the nurses station when this exam is finished." He nodded again with a smile before turning back to Katie. The young cheerleader winked at the intern, motioning for him to come back later.
She was met by Steve Rogers once more, surrounded by a couple other interns that were officially assigned to the case. Steve was holding Alex away from the incubator, which was now wide open as one of the interns performed CPR on baby Andy.
Steve sat down on the hospital bed, trying not to focus on the smell of Tony's cologne as he sat down beside him. He unwrapped the present carefully and found a picture frame inside the box. The photo inside was a brain scan, one he hadn't seen in many months. Steve instantly recognized the photo—the scan of the subarachnoid hemorrhage that he diagnosed on his first day.
The dog seemed to be smiling just as wide as the owner was. Tony couldn't blame them; getting attention from Steve made him smile, too.
One of the interns last night was boasting on all the surgeries they got to witness during their medical school career. Her dark red hair matched her fiery passion for medicine, and it made Steve feel queasy. Surgery didn't scare him, but somehow, hearing this woman go on about someone's chest wide open, it made him sick. How the hell were they allowed to do this to people? Opening chests? Why couldn't he have stuck to internal medicine with the other physicians?
Peter and Steve fell in love with the cat. Before the teenager had to leave for decathlon or band practice, the two would spend hours spoiling the cat with toys and treats. Tony played with Cheeseburger every now and again, but it was clear that the kitten only had eyes for Peter and Steve.
“Tones? You alright?” Rhodey was tentative, quiet. Not the usual teasing mood that he kept up for years whenever they were stuck together for a trauma.
"Beautiful day outside, isn't it?" Fury cracked a smile before continuing. "With this storm coming out of nowhere so quickly, please back up any charts that are on the computers or tablets. Print out any documents and keep charts as updated as possible. If the power goes out, we need to be ready."
"I'm going to check on the NICU babies." Steve's voice cracked as he tried to smile. "I'll page you guys if I need anything."
Steve's day dreaming was interrupted by the same redhead from last night. She nudged him a little and smiled. "Hey. Rounds are soon. They're assigning residents."
Sharon rolled her eyes and gathered her paperwork to return to Wilson. Steve waited until Sharon got onto the elevator before throwing his pen at his friend.
Steve pulled the covers back, looking up at Tony with gorgeous pink lips turning up in a smile. "Will you let me finish my work down here before you leave me in this bed all alone?"
She was also hoping that it was helping Steve move on. She felt a little guilty about it, but she was sick of the friendly coffee her husband was getting every damn day.
Steve nodded quickly, grateful that the grueling and awkward conversation was finally over. "Thank you. It was nice to meet you, um..."
Steve groans in frustration, standing up and wrapping his arms around the engineer. He sighs, breathing in the scent of Tony’s shirt. No matter how many times Steve does the laundry, all of Tony’s clothing smells like motor oil. Steve doesn’t really mind though; he never minds. It’s Tony.
The cardiothoracic surgeon tried not to show it, but she was ecstatic that her patient received a heart. Her eyes lit up when the brand new heart beat inside Tommy's chest. Bucky felt sick, knowing that the heart inside that chest belonged to a little girl who was playing with dolls just this morning. Kissing her parents goodbye before school. Seeing them right after soccer practice. Crying out for her mom before she died.
Once the meeting ended, doctors returned to their respective floors. Tony waited for a few minutes before he was greeted by Dr. Rhodes.
Picking the tray that was now laden with sandwiches and drinks, he made his way over to his boys, shouting out to them as he moved nearer.
Steve didn’t reply, too preoccupied with his fingers moving in and out of him; his cock had been rock-hard after watching Tony, and if it hadn’t been for the super-soldier serum he would have already cum. But now he had to take care of Tony too, so he removed his fingers and moved onto the bed, straddling Tony as he did so.
When Steve woke the next day, he was alone. He couldn’t help feel a little disappointed that Tony’s arms weren’t still wrapped around his shoulders as he slept, but he tried to ignore it. He looked at the clock – 7:54am – and got up, deciding to stay in the clothes that Tony had dressed him in the day before. Tony must have left awfully early to leave; that thought making Steve feel slightly worse.
Steve pulled himself off Tony, with the smaller man letting out a little whimper at the loss of touch and the sudden cold on his dick. A little shaky on his feet after his recent orgasm, Steve reached back over to the bottle of lube and poured some more onto his hands. He moved his hands down to Tony’s cock, one hand rubbing up and down slowly while the other moved further south to his hole, and began rubbing two fingers in slow circles, the same way he had down to himself.
“On the bed, on your back. Now” Tony jumped into position, automatically putting his hand towards the headboard and feet towards opposite corners of the bed, ready for Steve to tie him into place.
He’d been aware that he was bisexual most of his life, definitely leaning more towards men, but he could still appreciate the odd woman every now and again – such as Peggy. He’d always preferred men, but was grateful that at least he liked women a little bit as that would make pretending to be straight for the rest of his life much easier. He never would have thought that he would be able to tell the world that he wasn’t completely straight, and he probably would have been stoned if he’d mentioned raising a family with another man!
“Mainly stuff from The Incident in New York, seeing all the Chitauri soldiers coming through that portal in the sky, the last thing I saw before my eyes closed, that bright orange light as the nuke went off. Sometimes I see Extremis soldiers, doing everything they can to kill me while I was without my suit. Sometimes I can get away, fight them off, but most of the time I don’t. Sometimes I wake up just before they kill me, other times the dream just changes.” Tony whispered most of what he said, but Steve was close enough to hear every work clearly. He cared about Tony deeply and wanted to do everything he could to help him, but he wasn’t sure what to do.
Steve was right there in the middle of the action now. Surrounded by numerous enemies, throwing his shield to take out the ones furthest away and punching and kicking the closer ones. It was amazing to watch him fight, he certainly knew what he was doing, but that didn’t stop Tony from worrying about him. The enemies were dropping, one by one, as both men slowly took them out. Every now and again Steve would get hit and he’d stumble, sometimes fall. But he’d get back up again and continue fighting.
“Tony?” Steve whispered, watching Tony closely. Tony grunted in response, not even looking away from his work for a second. Steve covered the distance between the two of them in a matter of seconds. He went to put his hand on Tony’s back but stopped a few centimeters away, unsure whether it would throw Tony of balance, but then decided to do it anyway.
Tony had been nervous at first, worried he would be an even worse father than his own, but Steve had helped him work through it, had held him when he’d cried about how Peter was going to end up even more messed up than he was, and celebrated all Peter’s little victories with him, like learning to read and building his first computer.
After a minute or two, Steve found what he was looking for and walked back to the bed, holding the two items behind his back so that Tony couldn’t see what he’d got. Putting one item on the floor, making sure Tony still didn’t see it, he walked up to him so he was level with Tony’s head before showing him the first item. A blindfold. Tony just grinned and nodded enthusiastically.
“You mean like this?” Tony replied with a wink, knowing damn well that was what Steve had had in mind. It only took Steve a second to get Tony secured with the restraints they kept hidden just out of sight under the bed, just in case someone else came in during the day and they’d forgotten to tidy up. Having done that, Steve stood back and looked at Tony, taking all of him in. Tony’s hips jerked up again, clearly needing Steve’s touch once again.
“Are you shitting me, Rogers?!” Tony exclaimed, bucking his hips into the air. Steve just laughed before asking if Tony really wanted him to take it off. Reluctantly, Tony said no.
“You don’t have to worry you know…” Steve was the first one to talk, making Tony jump. He looked at him, surprised, believing he’d kept him emotions a secret. “It’s written all over your face. You’ve been looking at me with the same expression on your face in almost every fight we’ve had over the past few months but over the last few days I put two and two together…” Steve’s voice trailed off, blushing as he spoke.
“Okay, hey, lets go sit down alright?” Steve spoke calmly, taking Tony’s hand and leading them towards Tony’s room. It only took them a second to get there and Steve led Tony over to his bed so there was room enough for both of them to sit down.
Steve smiled, he was tired too and covered in cuts and bruises. He needed to sleep. So that’s what he did. Jarvis was piloting the quinjet as they were both to tired to do so. Steve laid down, his head resting on Tony’s lap and closed his eyes. Tony’s hand absentmindedly stroked Steve’s hair as the bigger man fell asleep. Steve’s breath evened out and Tony knew he was sleeping. He smiled to himself and closed his eyes. A few hours sleep wouldn’t do him any harm either.
“Thank you” he whispered, barely audible. Tony didn’t reply; instead he smiled and pulled Steve closer towards him. Tony couldn’t help but think how annoyed Fury was going to be that they missed the meeting, but Steve was worth it. He didn’t regret a single thing that had happened so far today. They both drifted off into sleep, wrapped in each other’s arms.
After Tony cares for Steve in a very intimate way the day before, the two men are initially awkward around one another until they finally manage to break the ice.
So Steve decided the only way to get Tony to go to bed would be to take him to bed. He gave Tony a small smile before walking up to him and putting his arms around his middle. Tony automatically put his arms around Steve’s neck before realising what Steve was up to, but it was too late. Steve picked him up. Tony had been picked up by Steve several times before so he knew it was useless to struggle, he wasn’t getting away. He had no choice but to admit to defeat. He wrapped his legs around Steve’s waist and rested his head on his shoulder.
Tony gasped as Steve’s hand finally landed where he wanted it: over his semi-hard dick. Steve rubbed his hand up and down over Tony’s length through his clothes, never quite applying as much pressure as Tony would want; it was the perfect way to get his desperate and stop thinking with his brain and start thinking with his dick. Hips jerking upwards at every stroke, Tony soon lost concentration on the kiss so Steve moved his lips back down to Tony’s neck again.
But Steve didn’t respond as that was the exact moment he chose to take Tony into his mouth, bobbed his head up and down.
“At the very least, that wasn’t a no,” Natasha said.  “Which, in this case, is actually more important than a yes.”  She shook out the cloth between her hands, smoothing it flat before folding it neatly into a square.  She slid it into her apron pocket.  “Difficult, though.”
Everything went still.  Steve rocked back on his heels, shocked by the violence in his own voice.  It echoed in the small space, hard edged and sharp.  Slowly, carefully, the dark haired young man looked up, his face blank.  His eyes were flat and wary,  and Steve tamped down on an unreasonable feeling of guilt, even as the watchmaker pushed his stool back from the counter, his face wary.
Tony’s jaw worked.  “Buy an orphanage?” he asked.  “Can you buy an orphanage?  Is that something that goes on the open market?”
“You're telling me.  I had a champagne bottle used as a deadly weapon against me, and that's only the second time in my life I can say that.” Tony threw an arm around Steve's shoulders.  "Come on.  Let me introduce you to the joys of ordering food from a street vendor in the middle of the night while wearing a tux."
Martin Morrison's voice preceded him into the room by about two minutes. By the time he caught up to his bombast, everyone was staring in the direction of the door. He was, Steve admitted, a handsome figure of a man, everything sharp and clean, from his well-cut hair to the tips of his polished shoes. He barely glanced in their direction.
Happy chuckled, his broad face relaxing. “Yeah, the gardener.” The car shot forward, merging into traffic. “Before the boss hired him, though, he did go to medical school.”  He tapped a finger on the side of his jaw.  “He fixed me up, couple of months ago, and now?  You can barely see the scar.”
She met his eyes without flinching.  "It's legal."  Tony stared at her, his hands spread wide, and she set her tablet down in front of him, the gesture somehow gentle.  She took a deep breath.  "Tony.  I'm sorry.  But we can't touch them."
Steve smiled.  “It’s over now,” he said, which seemed easier than confirming that or denying it.  He picked up his bag, settling the weight against his shoulder.  Something dug into his arm, and he paused.  “Here.”  He swung it around in front of him, pulling out the tin Jarvis had given to him.  He held it out to her.  “It’s gingerbread.”
“I know.”  Tony met her eyes without flinching.  “Marry in haste, repent in leisure, Pep.  But we need to talk this over.”
DJ nodded.  “Welcome home.” Then, the niceties taken care of, he bounced off, and Tony let his head fall back on the floor with a thunk.
“My mama used to say, ain't a good idea to mess with anyone who handles your food,” Clint said.  He reached for a platter.  “Cut some slices of bread, Peter, you can almost be trusted with toast.”
“Sure, but when food is your-  When it’s that central, you are full of associations.”  He held up the croissant.  “You didn’t learn to make these from a book.”
There was a thump at the door, and she twisted around, just in time to see a boy with a gap-toothed smile poke his head in.  "Hello, Miss!" he said, his voice cheerful.  "Mr. Hammer's gettin' the files for you." He slipped inside, a battered tray balanced between his hands.  "He told me t' offer you some tea."
Clint's eyes snapped open, his arm already reaching for his weapon before the soft, even sound of Jarvis' voice fully sank in.  “Jay?” he asked, his fingers closing on the grip of his bow.
Rhodey took a deep breath, and Tony heard the answer in that simple hiss of air.  “They’re still looking  The grounds are...”  His jaw worked.  “There’s a lot of places to go.”
He reached for the handle of the door, and Tony realized that Steve had straightened up outside, his hands falling to his sides.  Beyond him, Harris was coming up the sidewalk, DJ darting back and forth in front of him.  He stumbled on the edge of the curb, and Harris snagged him by the back of his hoodie, hauling him back to his feet.
“Leave me to make very poor choices with this,” Tony said, making the man laugh.  “Thank you.  That’s all for now.”
“Nice boxers,” she said, and Tony considered shame but it seemed far too late for that.  Jess was wearing two t-shirts layered on top of each other, and Tony was pretty sure one was hers and the other was Carol’s, over a pair of oversized red silk pajama pants.
“Also you’re not driving,” Iron Man called after them, and Clint flipped him off without even looking back.  Iron Man chuckled.  “Yeah, that’s a Barton.  It’s comforting that some things never change.”  His head swung towards Tony.  “You want to give us a minute?”
Tony wasn’t surprised when his phone started vibrating in his pocket.  He’d honestly been expecting it before they made it to the airport.  Clint, halfway up the stairs to the jet paused, looking back at him.  Tony held up a finger in a quick ‘one second’ gesture, and Clint nodded, disappearing through the door.
Carol licked the tines of the fork, her eyes canting up towards the ceiling as she considered that.  “Maybe?”
“He’s safe,” Stephen said.  He met Steve’s eyes, his gaze steady and calm.  “I’m sorry.”  He looked back at Tony.  “You’re right.  At this moment, I cannot get him back, and I also can’t say why I can’t get him back.”
Steve handed her the bowl and she took it with a grin.  “Then, after a few days, we’d have a few solders dressed up to look like traders pass by, and they would offer to take him with them to the coast, where he could catch a boat, and he would be free of us and we would be free of him, and that?” She dusted her hands off against each other.  “Would be that.”
One of Steve's shoulders rose and fell, a half shrug.  “You're going to fire me eventually, sir  Probably because I piss off someone above you.  At least this, I feel like I'm being fired for the right reasons.”
“I’m going to take that as an ‘I love you,’” Tony said, pushing himself upright, groaning as his back protested the movement.  “And my spine hates me.”  Steve braced him with a hand on his back.
Jan gave him a look, a born vamp, and threw her measuring tape around her neck like a scarf.  “I'll just keep your vase.”
Stark took a deep breath, one hand resting on his chest, over the arc reactor.  His fingers bounced against the fabric of his shirt.  “I don’t forgive him.  But I don’t think I need to forgive him.  What I needed to do, and this was, this was me, what I had to do was acknowledge that how I was raised, the relationship the two of us has, it wasn’t right.  To be a better parent than he was, to be a better father, I had to just…”  He stopped, his eyes closing.  “Had to make a different choice.”
