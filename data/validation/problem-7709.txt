Tony is pulling on his arm, leading them through the now crowded coffee shop, and he discreetly worms his arm away from him. Tony's flipping the man off, and finally, they're outside in the cool air. Steve starts walking, one foot in front of the other, Tony's voice trailing behind him.
"That, one day, people will realize what they allowed to happen and that they'll take it away," Steve has to work hard to keep the tears at bay, "and I can't do that."
Tony kisses his blonde hair, and dips his nose into his cheek. "I know you might not believe me, Rogers, but people really are different these days."
"What?" He closes his eyes, a dopey smile crossing his face, almost against his will.
"Hey, we're getting out of here." His gaze meets Tony, and he can almost see the tension on his face being replaced with worry. He's fine, really, he just wants to-
"Stop what?" A whisper.
His mouth is burned, and he knows that it'll heal in less than a minute, but goddamn, that hurts.
Time skips, and suddenly, his back is against a brick wall in a dimly lit alleyway, sharp rock digging into his skin. He stares wide eyed at Tony, lights from the street illuminating the shine in his eyes.
Blue eyes sparkle as Steve looks up from his lap. "That- that wont' stop it. " He huffs, shaking so hard Tony thinks his heart is going to stop right then and there.
Tony knows he will show him that, if it's the last thing he does on God's green earth.
It's full out panic. Dizzy spots appear in his vision, and he swears he feels himself tilting, a shot through his brain.
He doesn't know what he wants to do. Go home, maybe, climb the steep stairs up to his apartment, and wrap his mom's quilt around his shoulders like he used to do when he was little. But that apartment doesn't exist anymore, none of it does.
"I can-" his breath rushes out of him all once, "I can't t- I can't-" he's swinging his head back and forth, chest heaving with the effort of taking in air.
"Oui." Steve pipes up, leaning his forearms on the table. Maybe he just had a question about America. Steve was Captain America, after all.
The change in movement crushes his lungs, it feels like, and he coughs, breath stuck in his throat.
There's a car horn that goes off, startling them both, and his eyes search the entry of the alleyway for the man. Or a horde of them, coming to drive their point home into his heart. Maybe with a knife instead of words, this time.
"I keep thinking it's...it's just, a period of calm." His voice breaking.
They decide to sit inside, which Tony says is because of 'all the crazies that come out at night'. Steve doesn't necessarily want to observe the drunken parties exiting for the night, and he assumed Tony knows what he's talking about. He was the travel seasoned one.
Damaged.
"Don't touch me, not- not here." Steve pants, holding an arm out in warning. He's breathing hard, and he knows he's hurting Tony, but he can't.
"We're going to get caught," Steve chokes, dragging nails in the dirt below him. "They, they'll find out, they'll kill us, Tony, I've seen 'em do it before, oh my god!"
He thinks that everyone must feel the rebirth of the season, and this shows its truth in the decrease of crime. Baddies enjoying the weather right alongside him.
In many ways more than one, spring felt new. And clean. He felt like pure love when he was outside in the spring sun.
Tony snakes his hand into Steve's, trying to provide him with the comfort so desperately wanted, but he's jerking away so fast he almost gets whip lash.
He lets himself be lead, observing the way the buildings rise high above Tony and him. It's breezy, and the wicker basket bumps against his skin. The sun is beginning to go down, and orange shadows drape the brick walls and concrete.
Hot tears stream down his face, and Tony can't help but notice how full of terror his eyes are.
Tony just nods, pulling his jacket around Steve and raising them to their feet.
In a few minutes, he feels a tap on his shoulder, and spins to find a black coffee in front of him. He takes it gently, relishing in the warmth, and he presses a quick kiss to Tony's cheek, dragging a hand down his arm as he heads to the booths. Tony follows, eyes smiling and head hanging with a blush.
It was a gorgeous day. The sun shone bright, gracing the planes of his face with golden warmth. His thin t-shirt billowed in tandem with the trees, wind swirling around air that had been stagnant for so many months.
They enter, and there are plants for sale on one side, and a counter with tables and chairs on the other. Steve whispers his order to Tony, trying to ignore the shiver that goes down Tony's spine, and heads over to observe the ferns.
"Don't," Tony interrupts, "It wasn't your fault."
Tony flips in his seat, and sees the scowl marring the guys face.
"Tu es étranger?" You are foreign?
It's funny, because Steve agrees. It's been work, work, work, for years, and it hadn't ever really crossed his mind to travel for fun. He'd seen France during the war, sure, Germany too. But those memories were covered in soot and blood and-
"Let's go home, yeah?" Tony walks them out into the light of the street and they walk, silent, down the sidewalk with the basket clasped between them.
He sets his sketchbook down on the patterned blanket next to him, and stretches his arms behind him. His head tilts back to the sky.
"There's this beautiful cafe around the corner." Tony catches Steve's free hand in his own, and they weave through the crowded streets. "It's right next to a flower shop, Beignet De La Terre."
Steve feels like he's just been kicked in the stomach.
It's too much. Apologies wait on his lips, but he knows that if he speaks, the things he's trying to keep inside will spill out like a waterfall of blood and hurt, drowning them both.
Phantom fingers are running through his hair, tugging viciously, and they make him gasp and pull his head under his arms.
He's spiraling, the ground below him turning to mud, laden with bullet shells, that sticks to his hair and his clothes. His lids flutter, eyes searching the alley in fear.
Steve finally allowed Peter to pull away, holding him at arm's length.
“Tell us where it is and we’ll be on our way,” Peter said from behind Steve.
, what kind of parent would be?
Steve shot up from his seat and walked briskly toward his son. “If we don’t get this stone, then billions of people stay dead,”
Steve furrowed his eyebrows, ready to reach out for his son before a deep voice called out to them.
“What you seek lies in front of you,” Red Skull stated as Peter and Steve peered down the side of the chasm. “As does what you fear,”
“I had a spare,” Peter said as he sat up, pointing at the web-shooter on his right wrist.
“You’re acting like he’s dead. We have the stones, right? We can bring him back if we just–” Clint spoke, voice full of unshed tears.
Peter raised an eyebrow. “I’m starting to think we mean different people here,” he said.
Peter quickly aimed his web-shooters toward Steve, attaching the webs to his shoulders and yanking him backward.
Peter let out a shaky breath he didn’t know he’d been holding. “Dad?” he asked, “What if he’s making this up?”
Steve physically flinched at Peter’s words. Steve had to take a few seconds to collect himself before responding. “I’m not ready to lose you,” he admitted shakily. Because,
Steve felt like he was underwater. Voices around him became distorted as he felt frozen in place. His legs felt like jello as he sunk to the floor.
Steve only made it a few strides before a web shot out at his feet.
Steve lifted his head from his hands and glanced at Peter, who was now pacing back and forth nervously. He frowned in concern at the terrified look on his face.
“Oh whatever, he eats garbage,”
“When did you become so grown up?”
“Welcome,” the voice bellowed. Steve pushed Peter behind him, raising his shield.
Steve stirred awake as the unsettling feeling of emptiness began to well up inside of him. His eyes shot open as he jolted upright into a sitting position, splashing the water surrounding him. Realizing he was holding onto something, Steve brought his hand out of the water and opened his clenched fist. Tears clouded his vision as the soul stone shone brightly against his palm.
Never again would he be able to hug his son. Never again would he hear his laugh. The reality of the situation came crashing down on Steve as the waves of grief suffocated him.
“Dad! Get off of me!” Peter screamed as Steve held him down.
“I’m sorry,” Peter sobbed, “Thank you for being the best dad I could ever ask for. You
Steve sharply inhaled, cutting clint off. “It can’t be undone. He’s gone,” Steve's voice was low, rough and emotionless, “It was supposed to be me,” he said, barely above a whisper. Tony clutched his shirt and sobbed harder in response.
Red Skull continued, “In order to take the stone, you must lose that which you love. An everlasting exchange. A soul, for a soul,”
so sorry,” Peter choked out as he used the momentum to propel himself forward towards the cliff instead.
“Who are you?” Steve demanded, shield still raised.
Steve swallowed back the lump in his throat. “You’re crazy if you think I’m going to let you go. You’re
“Dad,I–” Peter started before Steve cut him off.
Steve watched as his son exhaled wearily. “I bet the raccoon didn’t have to climb a mountain,” Peter sighed.
who he needed to protect at all costs. “Whatever it takes,” Steve whispered, mostly to himself.
Steve’s lungs burned. For the first time since he’d taken the serum, he felt like he couldn’t breathe. Steve clutched the stone against his chest, breaking out into uncontrollable sobs. He shook violently and squeezed his eyes shut, desperately wishing for his son to come back.
“Steve? Talk to me. Where’s Peter?” Tony asked again, more urgently.
Steve shook his head with a solemn look on his face. “I don’t think so, Peter. Thanos left here with the stone, and without his daughter. That can’t be a coincidence,”
Steve turned his head and looked at his son in horror, who was still on the ground, propping himself up with one arm. Peter had his other arm extended, pointing at him.
“We have to make it worth it,” Natasha choked out. She gazed down at the floor and let the tears escape from her eyes. “We
“Steve? Where’s Peter?” his husband asked him. Steve felt dread pool at the pit of his stomach.
“Peter, please,”
tell Pops that I love him and that
The next thing he knew, he was knelt on the ground leaning on Tony, with the rest of the Avengers surrounding him.
“He’s not… Steve, he can’t be,” Tony’s voice wavered. He pulled away from Steve just enough to lock eyes with him. “Damn it,” Tony gasped out before his body was wracked with an onslaught of sobs.
“He’s gone. Peter’s gone,” Steve breathed out as he collapsed into Tony’s arms, holding on for dear life.
“Steven, son of Joseph,” the voice continued, “Peter, son of Richard,”
A sob escaped from Steve’s throat, knowing that he was now good as glued to the ground.
“Child, if only it were that easy,” Red Skull replied, eerily calm.
“I’m so, so, so sorry,” Steve’s voice wobbled. He grabbed Peter’s wrists and squeezed them hard enough to only break his web-shooters. His heart shattered at the look on his son’s face. Giving Peter one last glance, Steve pushed off of him and dashed for the cliff.
Peter ran to the edge of the cliff and leaped into the abyss.
Peter looked up to meet his dad’s glassy eyes. “Well, then we know who it’s gotta be,”
“I’m so sorry it had to end this way, but I want to do this,” Peter swallowed before continuing. “I know that you’re gonna blame yourself for this, but, I swear, Dad, please don’t. This is my choice,”
The two walked further up the mountain when Peter whipped around to face Steve with wide eyes. “Dad?” Peter started, “Someone’s here,”
“Oh God,” Peter breathed out as he and his father backed away from the edge. Steve moved to sit on a nearby rock, burying his face in his hands.
Peter allowed himself to be enveloped in his dad’s arms and hugged to within an inch of his life.
Steve jumped to his feet and launched himself toward Peter, tackling him to the ground.
in comparison to his broad palms.
“Technically he’s not a raccoon, you know,” Steve said as he raised an eyebrow at Peter amusedly.
“Consider me a guide, to you, to all who seek the soul stone,”
Steve clenched his jaw, eyes wandering around the room dazedly before they locked with Natasha’s.
“I love you, Peter,” Steve said one last time before he broke out in a sprint for the cliff.
“And I’m not ready to go. But I gotta, y’know? Whatever it takes,” Peter began to pull away from his dad, who only tightened his hold in response.
“The stone’s down there,” Peter gulped as Steve stepped closer to his son.
Pops. I love you both,”
“Let me go, Peter,” Steve demanded, eyes pleading. Steve’s breath hitched as Peter threw himself into his arms in a fierce hug. Peter buried his face in his father’s shoulder, trembling, remembering what it was like to be a small boy afraid of the dark. Steve hooked his chin over Peter’s head and closed his eyes.
Steve nodded weakly, “We do,” Steve reached out to grasp Peter’s hand in his, which looked
Peter took a few more steps before he stopped in his tracks. A few moments passed before he echoed Steve’s statement. “Whatever it takes,” Peter said.
With tears in his eyes, Tony croaked out a meek, “What?”
But Tony insisted. “If I had reported this, would he have hurt them? Would they be alive?”
As midterms approached, hanging out turned into weekly quizzing, where Steve and Erin - who was studying for her Associate’s in accounting - answered quick-fire questions that Paulette and Sam read off cards (and sometimes made up, just to throw them off).
The audience laughed, but there were a handful of people who audibly gasped. Without thinking, Steve turned in the direction where he thought they came from and smiled shamelessly.
“You’ll probably find a better place if you’re not hurrying, too,” Tony said in agreement, “sometimes it’s worth waiting to find the right place. It’s your home, it should be the right one.”
Whether it was because of Tony’s obvious embarrassment or his squeaking reply, Steve’s expression warmed with a smile, but he didn’t comment on it. “Good,” he said easily, and with a final reassuring squeeze, he released his hand and stepped aside. “Go on, you go first.”
Violet refused to peek out from under Steve’s armpit and her tail was tucked firmly between her legs, so clearly scared that in his guilt, Tony forgot they were on TV.
“They made three sequels of that dreadful film?”
His words had little effect on Steve, and instead, the Captain turned away from him to address the Chief Director himself. “We need two more chairs.”
With Tony’s arms securely restrained, Steve pushed his free hand into the space between the mattress and Tony’s turned thighs, not that Tony knew what was happening until Steve’s fist closed around his cock. There was no pause, no gentle warning before Steve started jerking him off with a grip so tight it bordered on painful. Tony cried himself hoarse, cried out Steve’s name, and as Steve twisted his hand aggressively over the head of Tony’s cock, he sobbed in shock and in pleasure, his whole body convulsing uncontrollably under Steve’s heavy weight. Steve let go of Tony’s spent cock and instead grasped Tony’s forearm. With one hand holding Tony’s hand and the other grabbing the same arm, Steve had Tony well and truly trapped under him again, and he held Tony firmly in place as he pounded into his body, chasing his own release. Under him Tony purred and moaned his encouragement, still breathless and euphoric from his orgasm, and when Steve’s rhythm finally faltered and stuttered and groaned deeply with satisfaction into Tony’s neck, Tony pressed back eagerly to encourage Steve to stay, to not pull out yet and let Tony enjoy the satisfaction of being filled and used and so thoroughly satiated.
All around them, the bullpen fell quiet. Instinctively, Bucky and Steve turned to look at the figures occupying the hallway. They all matched, with their blue windbreaks and polished shoes. Their bored glances around the bullpen betrayed little, except for the guy at the very front. The guy with the sunglasses and the tailored suit.
Steve turned on the automatic spin, but dialed down power from 10 to an 8, and then further to 7. On the first buck of the bull, Tony rolled with the toss easily, but at least he had one hand on the saddle now.
With a wretched sob, Tony suddenly stretched out flat on the mattress, breathless, irritated, and unsatisfied. “Please, my love,” he pleaded. “The world has had you long enough. For me, Steve, please. Come home.”
The only thing that gave away Sharon’s surprise was a slight pause. Without a word, she stepped out of Steve’s office to hold the door for him, and by the time Steve stepped out to march down the hall towards Sitwell’s office, she seemed more poised, ready to fall in step behind him.
Steve went willingly as Tony reeled him in, melting into him with a gentle, tentative kiss. A delirious smile overtook Tony but he didn’t let it stop him from opening to Steve’s kiss, moaning softly in encouragement. He eased back into the couch until the full weight of Steve’s body pressed him into the firm cushions and Tony could bend his legs around Steve’s body to cradle him between his thighs. Steve’s hips jerked up instinctively under the familiar squeeze of Tony’s legs, grinding his growing erection against Tony’s until he caught it just right and Tony choked on a breath, moaning into the kiss, ever so eager for more.
On instinct, Tony sat up and knocked on Stephen’s wooden desk. The last thing he needed was the evil eye after him.
“Hey, isn’t that our Graham Norton episode?” he wondered, and without asking questions or thinking twice, Steve clicked over to the channel and rewound to the start of the show. They watched Graham Norton’s monologue, chuckling to themselves every now and then, and watched as Sarah Millican and Colin Farrell were brought on before the two of them joined the couch.
He came to an immediate halt several yards out. “Tony,” he whispered, “I thought we were going to a Christmas market. Why can’t we walk?”
This time when Steve added a third finger, Tony took to the stretch more readily. Steve twisted his three fingers as one, pumping slowly; occasionally, he reached farther and treated Tony to a tender and teasing massage of his prostate, but now his focus was on stretching him for the job. The next time he pulled his fingers out, he did so with his fingers spread wide, until Tony whimpered again at the pain of his three fingers held still at the rim of his hole, spreading him wide open.
Casual displays of strength had a way of turning Tony into putty, and he wasted no time wrapping himself around his boyfriend, kissing the smug smirk right off Steve’s face. The intensity almost had Steve toppling backwards, but as satisfying as it may be to fuck Tony on a bed of scripts, Steve found his balance, hoisted Tony into a better grip, and carried his boyfriend to their bedroom.
“I’m okay,” he hissed through his teeth, “I’m waiting, Tony. Do it,
“I got us a car,” he interrupted, “don’t trouble them, Tony, it’ll take them twice as long to make the trip to pick us up.”
Tony looked anything but reassured by the doctor’s suggestion, and stared openly at him for some time instead of answering the question.
“We’re across the hall,” he heard Tony say through the door. “Why are we meeting downstairs? You ready?”
Steve hadn’t meant to react the way he did, but he knew who Dummy was. The thought that he wasn’t safe from that giant animal inside of a house had him sitting ramrod straight in his chair and staring at Tony with startled, wide-eyed fear.
“Someone in the lab got a new bike,” Tony told him with a big grin, “he let a whole bunch of us test drive it around the building. Steve, it was
“Was that Steve calling?”
Brock opened his mouth, but he couldn’t seem to formulate any words. Steve smiled back at him, then made a show of checking his watch.
Tony let go of Steve’s arm. “You can’t agree with us both.”
“My assistant will have the address to you within the hour,” Steve told Jan before they parted. With everything delegated and taken care of, he handed his luggage to the driver and climbed into the car.
“Rogers, copy? We got him: he was in the parking lot.”
Steve’s face warmed with a smile of relief, and Tony felt a weight lifting from his chest at the thought that his support had been part of giving Steve that level of satisfaction. They would go to Pierce’s offices, Steve would learn that he was wrong, and at the end of the day Tony will have served him well because Steve could finally be confident that his steward would always support him.
Bruce blinked owlishly at the Chief Director’s back. He glanced at his partner as if to ask for help, but he’d spoken out of line too recently to dare disagree with a direct order. “Yes, sir.”
“I think that’s what stayed with me for days after I saw the movie, that inner conflict of who your character is or thinks he is,” Stephen said, serious one moment then effortlessly bringing it back to lighter humor by admitting, “it’s becoming a problem: I was in the shower two days later, shampooing my hair for five minutes because I kept thinking, if you take away reality, what is left? And is that who I am? Do I even want it to be real?”
Steve inhaled deeply to steady his nerves and hurried back to bed where he had left his phone. He hadn’t heard from Tony in almost two months. He had meant to reach out, starting one message after another without ever sending them, because anything Steve wrote sounded so sad and needy. Sure, it was great to become friends with your co-stars, but not like this—the business was all about moving around and never being in the same place twice, he knew that. Still, it was almost embarrassing to admit how badly Steve missed his friend, even to himself.
“I have? Yes—yes, uh, I have, he’s—he’s kind, and, and dreamy,” she replied slowly, managing to meet Hill and Fury’s scrutiny with a steady gaze. “I’ve been helping Steve with his bachelor party; I can show you my calendar, if you need dates. I don’t know what Jim’s doing, but Steve—Steve doing a historic tour of Brooklyn, and—”
With his heart lodged in his throat, Tony stared back, unblinking, as Steve grinned at him and winked.
“—Gay is gay to people here! That’s all that matters. Homosexuality is illegal, do you get that? Four hundred lashes and who knows how many months in prison. I can’t leave my fucking room without an escort, for the safety of everyone around us. So I don’t look at another man the wrong way. Can’t you see what you’ve done?”
“I know you do, pal,” Bruce replied quietly, then, feeling like words were not enough, he reached over to rub at Thor’s shoulder in a comforting, if awkward, gesture.
Even in his sleep Tony heard that familiar click-clack across the hardwood floors. Confident and purposeful, she gained on him faster than he could think of an escape.
Before Steve recognized what he had done, Tony groaned in complaint and pushed against his chest to be let go. Steve eased him back onto the mattress, and he followed him closely to brush his lips over Tony’s forehead, lingering intentionally, then to be sure, he pressed his cheek against Tony’s clammy skin.
“Except when you’re with me, of course,” he finished with a playful nonchalance. “You are my priority, Tony. What we have together matters to me.”
“I did! I was very fortunate—all actors dream of the day acting becomes our only source of income,” he said as diplomatically as he could. “And I’m lucky that they were all projects I’d do again in a heartbeat, but I didn’t know what I was doing. I didn’t have an agent; I didn’t know you needed breaks! We literally flew out the day MIB wrapped to start on
“Start with the more outrageous one,” Steve suggested, gently squeezing Tony in his embrace.
From start to finish, it didn’t take half an hour. Jane conferred the credits and led the way back to the car.
So much for leading the team, Steve mused ruefully to himself, but outwardly he nodded in the affirmative. It was, after all, better than anything he’d come up with himself and to the point. All he had to do was pull himself together, avoid all classic signs of anxiety or suspicious behavior, and try not to think about how there was a very real possibility that his closest friendship in this crazy new world could be irrevocably damaged if he said (or did) the wrong thing.
“Have you looked?” Sharon asked like she knew the answer already, and Steve’s dubious shrug only confirmed her initial suspicion. “Exactly, so how can you be sure?”
With a turn of his hand, Steve shifted Tony’s position ever so slightly, and with the next thrust, his cock grazed past Tony’s prostate. It was a cutting spark of pleasure, but not enough to give Tony that deep satisfaction; with every thrust, Steve drove Tony mad with pleasure, leaving him panting and hungry for more.
Silence answered him, and it took Tony a beat to realize Steve was caught out staring. He almost looked like he was about to cry.
“This isn’t a state visit, or a scheduled appearance. Nobody will know we are there. Unless that’s what you want three cars and ten security guards to do; it only invites trouble. How am I supposed to get to know the people from behind a wall of security, Tony?”
“Alright, sure, let’s go with that,” Tony said with a note of relief, “but guys, I didn’t think he’d go for it. Couples therapy! This could be a gold mine!”
Tony sat back on his haunches, and even with the gloves, he managed to get Steve’s jeans unbuttoned and tugged down just enough to reveal his briefs. He pulled down the waistband of his underwear inch for inch, until Steve’s already hard and leaking cock had enough space to pop out of its confines.
“Not sleepy,” Steve sighed muzzily, reaching for Tony.
“They’re double-oh’s,” Sharon explained with a roll of her eyes. “All they know is flirting, fucking, and murder. Flirting is the cleanest option.”
“I have to get someone on this right away. Stay here,” Steve said by way of excusing himself. He shouldn’t leave Tony alone in a room full of evidence, and he shouldn’t let this one potential lead go to his head so quickly, but protocol did not feel half as important as rallying some junior detectives to start a preliminary look into Antonovich.
“I thought you were pulling away,” Tony said instead, because at the end of the day it wasn’t about her, it was about
“You know,” he said, sounding too casual to be genuine. It was enough to catch Tony’s attention and shake off his own insecurities to listen to what Steve had to say. “Before you, I didn’t really… I didn’t think I’d be able to be with someone long term.”
“Tony, what a surprise! You’re on this floor, too?” he asked with a big smile that his face was too tired to support, and even he could feel how it collapsed into a lopsided grin.
“Thank god it’s you,” Tony wheezed and hauled his friend into his dorm room, then with a quick peek in both directions down the hall, he closed the door behind them. The door locked on its own, but he tugged on the handle to be sure, then slid the bolt he had added for extra security.
Halfway through the movie, none of them were good for anything besides laughing, drinking, and snoring. All of Steve’s calls went unnoticed and unanswered.
The sweet and savory smell of breakfast permeated the air more noticeably the closer they got to the kitchen. The lure of coffee and bacon, of buttery biscuits and French toast, grew stronger with every step.
“Such a good girl,” Tony murmured in praise once she was (relatively) calm, punctuating it with a kiss between her eyes. “Fine. Whatever: you win, Missy. No surprise there. Go get your ball, I’ll put on pants or, or …something. It’s supposed to be cold, right?”
“I was the one who spilled water on you,” Tony reminded him as they walked to a table in the corner.
“If you don’t want to admit we’re doing it for you, tell yourself we’re doing it for me,” Bucky told him in a droll monotone. “Cause I know you, and if you don’t find out what happens when they come out of that restaurant, I’ll never hear the end of it.”
Eventually, they got up. They picked up after themselves, and folded the blanket back up. There was a zip-up hoodie at the bottom of his bag, and Steve offered it to Tony wordlessly. Tony hadn’t really felt cold until that point, and he gratefully accepted it and bundled up. They walked down the boardwalk hand in hand and shoulder to shoulder, watching the people and excitement around them while sunlight faded in the wake of the sunset. Nobody interrupted them or even stared after them, and Tony and Steve were able to stroll along the boardwalk like any other couple out for a mid-week walk.
Their victories aligned with the holiday season, and fortunately, the seasonal excitement mellowed hard-working politicians with the joy of Christmas festivities. It was the first time since their honeymoon that Tony had the chance to devote Steve his full attention, and he didn’t waste a minute of it.
A painful and uncomfortable silence passed between them.
In the narrow width between the two bookshelves Tony had randomly pushed them into, Steve knelt directly behind him, so close that Tony could feel the soft gusts of his breath warming his exposed ass. Without warning or build up, Steve spread Tony’s cheeks with one hand and dove in to lick and suck at his furrowed hole as it pulsed under Steve’s mouth in Tony’s excitement. But this wasn’t the time for foreplay, and while Steve was enjoying himself and his view, Tony faced the aisle. He couldn’t help but feel the impending risk of being discovered, and while the coast was still clear, that didn’t mean it would be for long.
It turned out there was no luxury SUV. Avis didn’t have a Range Rover for Steve to take with him.
Steve and Tony had decided early on not implement direct changes to the cultural traditions of their united people. The freedom to practice any custom or religion that did not actively vilify or harm others was protected, but the rest was left to individuals and local government. There was only one exception.
“On one condition,” Tony murmured under his breath, threading his fingers through Steve’s thick, blond hair and giving it a firm tug that Steve hadn’t seen coming. After all these years - centuries - it was enough to leave Steve panting softly for breath and staring at Tony’s lips like a depraved man eager for a long, deep drink.
There was something quite soothing about ending your night draped across another human body, either shouting about dastardly bachelors, or lusting for
“I… uh,” Tony suddenly stalled, a little bewildered by the interruption. “No, sir. No, I am only trying to warn you, Captain Steve. As your steward in this transition, it is my responsibility and commitment to you to prepare you as best that I can for the 22nd. Your trust in me,” he started to say, then pressed his lips into a tight line of resistance.
“Not for me,” Steve said with a shrug, but Tony didn’t quite buy it. He narrowed his eyes at Steve and let Steve stew in the silence.
“Hold—hold up, hang on, Tony,” he waved his hands and tried to find the right words so he wouldn’t sound crazy. “You’ve left me instructions in the event of your death? What kind of instructions?”
“How did you know he was the one?”
at my place?”
“They’re screaming like you’re about to take your clothes off,” Graham laughed, and the couch laughed - all except for Channing, who blushed and gracefully declined. “Alright, well - we tried, so that’s our expectations managed for the night,” Graham quickly informed the crowd in feigned solemnity before turning back to his guests.
Apparently, the most common risk was the lack of reliable research on the species involved in the harvest. But Steve had spent years with humans, and months with Tony. He knew his pet. Already, Tony had produced an impressive stock of raw, unprocessed hormones ready to be sold to the highest bidder.
Steve nodded. “With a full ride, yeah.”
“It’s the Cryo-Prison,” he answered, though he looked as confused by the knowledge as Bruce.
The cop nodded, then put the device away to give Rumlow his attention.
“I, uh.”
“Grab it,” he said after a few seconds of consideration. “It’d be a good signal that you know what you’re doing.”
“Steve! My markers!” Tony suddenly cried, then looked right back at Chris. “How could—Steve, he got me markers for my birthday. Back on the set of Avengers, we’d see Steve doodling all the time. Anytime he’s not in a conversation, a meeting, or in front of the camera, he’d be attached to his sketchbook. And he’s phenomenal—”
Tony bent at the waist to bodily lean over Steve, murmuring words of praise and kissing him everywhere he could reach. “Fucking hell, you’re gorgeous,” Tony murmured as he kissed his collarbone, tasting Steve’s sweat and feeling the wild rise and fall of his chest as he struggled to catch his breath.
“No.”
“She will keep her word, I promise.”
Tony made a strangled sound and leaned back in his seat, leaning most of his weight against the armrest and glaring at the far wall. Steve could so easily imagine the veritable steam coming out of his ears, and he tried not to laugh at how agitated Tony was getting with his own plan.
Steve held Tony’s hand for support, and with his free hand he offered Tony an old iron key.
“Bake, but it’s very simple, it takes almost no time,” Steve told him, sifting the flour with sugar and some salt onto his wooden surface. He formed it all into a little mountain, made a nest in the top, then cracked three eggs into the center. He added butter, lemon zest, and a splash of dry wine to the liquid before digging in with his hand to knead it into a dough.
And you know Tony. Even though he wants to keep away, he really can’t. Maybe he went by to see Steve in an open practice, along with a smattering of Steve's fans (and also the opponent's fans, who come to see what they're up against for betting purposes), and the media, all of them there to see Steve train. It was a beautiful sight, whether he was sparring or if he was throwing power punches at the reinforced bags. Tony would try to stay in a corner, try to stay unseen, but when the new manager wasn’t calling the right shots, wasn’t keeping a close enough watch on the trainer, and maybe even getting swept away with the media attention, more focused on making sure a good photo is taken of them/Steve/himself, Tony would get fed up on Steve's behalf. This was not what you were supposed to be doing the week before a fight: you needed to focus.
“Steve.”
“Then let me explain it for you,” Hawley drawled. “You have worked very hard to be here, Mr. Rogers. We are all rather impressed with your progress. I would like to see you make similar efforts in your personal relationships,” she finished, with meaning.
The three detectives behind him stopped what they were doing and looked up. Tony glanced at them all in turns of quiet acknowledge, until his gaze fell on Natasha and lingered there.
“No, of course I told you a—my mother told me if I didn’t appease investors, if I didn’t, if I wasn’t like Howard, they would invest elsewhere. They don’t want the handoff to rock the boat. Without their investment, tens of thousands of families would be out of an income.”
“I will use it sparingly,” Tony promised, and to be on the safe side, bowed his head to press an affectionate little kiss to Steve’s shoulder. He felt more than saw Steve’s huff of amusement, but he straightened and held up his canvas bag before there was any time for Steve to comment. “Stopped on the way for snacks. You’re lucky: no cashews.”
“First time with 007?” he asked with a knowing grin. “He’ll get under your skin.”
Tony, who had hoped for another miraculous smile, quickly pressed his own lips together before he looked like a fool. “You bet,” he managed through what had so nearly been a wishful smile of his own. “Good night, Steve.”
“There’s a duck out there with a bigger dick than yours—”
Steve would agree in a heartbeat.
Steve’s orgasm drove through him like a stampeding train, devastating and inescapable. His hips skittered forward in uncoordinated, instinctive thrusts until he came deep inside Tony, but even as his lizard brain wanted to pump every drop into his mate, Steve pulled out before he finished and jerked his cock through the thick, frothy mess of lube and come to paint Tony’s perfect round ass with long bands of his come.
“Shockingly good at poker,” Steve filled in, to the surprise and amusement of their audience.
“I disagree, we’re clearly on to something,” he disagreed with a gleeful glint in his eyes. “I’m down for a demonstration—”
, Steve?”
“Okay, but then why is there American soil in a random square?” Steve wondered, “or is ...I mean, I thought I knew US history, but I don’t remember a battle of Trafalgar between America and England.”
Then, it was over almost as quickly as it had started. Tony started to pull off, releasing Steve’s fingers through his teeth, one at a time, just as Steve felt the first, sweet tension of his orgasm mounting.
Bucky glowered after his partner and marched after him to catch up. “And just for that, I’m driving: give me the keys.”
“Do I comment on the cost of anything you pay for?” Steve reminded him gently, but before Tony could stop himself, he glared back at Steve’s nonchalance.
“Hey.”
‘Sometimes the bravest and most important thing you can do is just show up.’
“Well… can’t fault his taste, you look… sinful, Steve,” Tony grumbled under his breath. He spared two seconds to just drink in the sight of Steve in his skin-tight uniform, so perfect and understated in its simplicity. Superman was an alien, a legend, and who knew if he was even alive anymore? But Steve, Steve was real and genuine and everything Tony could have dreamed of. He was every inch the super man Tony needed.
“Tony, stop! Tony, I
“Always,” he promised, and with a smirk of satisfaction, he lifted Tony straight up so Tony could wrap his arms and legs around him.
“I can’t believe you told her,” Sam seconded, and Erin could only agree.
IBD, tell me I’m crazy!!
“There has been an attack on the Kingdom,” he told Steve as they both watched the recent footage of six military jets taking off from Eisenturm. Like most of the military’s technology, the fighter jets were of Tony’s own design. “I can’t reach Rhodes or Natasha. Pepper’s last text said that Lila is safe.”
Except, Brock wasn’t the one he found first. Across the room he spotted Sharon with a few of her friends, all of them modestly dressed in cashmere and pearls.
“Tony,” Steve said in the same quiet, cautioning voice that he used when he wanted Tony to stop worrying. “It is only the first week of December, we have time—”
—fuck! When is it ever not your turn, Steve—oh,
“I feel like I’m missing something,” Tony told Steve between quick gulps of water. “It’s not like I’m less interested in you if they’re disappointed.”
Steve had been happy for him, but Steve had never called back. It had been months, and still Steve hadn’t called. Tony should be angry. He should be irritated that Steve hadn’t recognized the clear pattern of calling responsibility, but even he knew it didn’t matter. Did Steve not understand that, too? Tony would forgive Steve for anything if Steve would just call.
“Dummy’s probably just what he calls you for believing him,” Sam pointed out, and Bucky was nodding in agreement immediately. Steve could only stare at them.
This time, Steve had the advantage of sobriety. Thicker and longer than any of the canisters, Tony struggled at first to accommodate him, and it was only with his superior mass and strength that Steve managed to pin Tony to the mattress and keep him contained as he fucked into Tony in short, purposeful thrusts. With all that he had learned about Tony’s body in the past four months, he easily brought Tony to and from the edge multiple times before he let him taste release, wringing two powerful orgasms from Tony’s body before succumbing to his own.
When Tony eyed him skeptically, as if Steve’s choice was a test, Steve smiled and added, “Go have fun, Tony. I’ve got my phone on by the bed, call if you need anything? Anything, and I’ll be there.”
Steve might never understand what was going on, but he could see the care and attention that Tony put into his work—he knew where everything was, and even what the once-discarded scraps could be employed to do. Nothing was a waste, nothing was useless in Tony’s hands, and if Steve didn’t love him already he’d been a lost cause.
Steve gritted his teeth and glared up at the ceiling with a vengeance. How had his life come to this, a choice between helping his friend and preserving his goddamn dignity?
It wasn’t shaping up to be the kind of story Steve wanted to hear first thing on a Thursday morning, but since it no longer sounded like a story that would have him punching someone’s teeth in either, he figured he could just sit down in a nearby seat and let Tony explain.
“It’s a truck, we’re out in the plains: you don’t need roads,” Tony pointed out with a playful tone, and when Steve straightened to look at him, he found Tony standing directly in front of him, already reaching to undo the buttons of Steve’s shirt.
“Actually,” he said, partly sheepish but mostly eager, “what you think?”
body. Steve only laughed at Tony’s sudden burst of action and quickly covered him up with the blankets to keep them warm, drawing him into the protective embrace of his strong arms and proceeded to chase away every fear and worry plaguing Tony’s thoughts with his tongue, his lips, and his sharp, wicked teeth.
“You mean that, Tony?” he asked. “It wouldn’t have anything to do with the Superman suit I’m wearing, would it?”
Tony rested his cheek against Steve’s shoulder and closed his eyes. He concentrated on the soothing sound of Steve’s voice, the gentle, absent touch of Steve’s hands, and the warm water all around them, and slowly, he started to let the day fade away.
Steve took a deep, steadying breath. In what world had that ever seemed reasonable?
Tony pouted into Dummy’s cheek, stroking his horse’s velvety muzzle. “I missed you, too, little guy,” he whispered, before gently urging Dummy to back off. The horse snorted unhappily and went unwillingly when Tony pushed him away, but eventually complied and trotted off.
“Had you sucked his dick, he likely would have been far more pleasant company.”
“Prophylactics,” Tony corrected mildly and with a straight face, reacting only by nodding in encouragement. “Your mother is a very intelligent woman, and so are you. Keep it up.”
“I thought a bad girl would have had intercourse.”
“So, let me get this straight,” he said slowly, if irritably. “You can call me Captain Steven G. Rogers, Captain Steve Rogers, or Steve Rogers? But you can’t call me Steve even if it is my preference?”
“What—” Steve stammered under his breath, almost sounding shaken from his orgasm, as if he couldn’t quite find the strength speak yet. “What was that, Tony?”
“No, no, hey don’t, don’t worry. I’ll go get the—look, I’m gonna go do it right now, just, just breathe, and—mom? Can you get him water?”
He took another look around the room, and found himself corrected. There wasn’t a body in every chair.
“Your friend thinks he can just use people and spit us out when he’s finished just cause he’s got money? Well, tough titties!” Bucky shouted at him, “nobody’s taking advantage of my best friend! Not on my fucking watch.”
Bruce stopped talking when Thor and Tony glanced at him as one, and if he didn’t already regret his words, Tony’s look of alarm and Thor’s guilt really made him wish a hole would open up at his feet and swallow him whole.
Steve had gotten the message loud and clear. He had pulled away and shoved Tony down onto his back, pinning Tony to the mattress with one big paw over his chest. After that, it didn’t matter how Tony squirmed and thrust his hips. Steve was strong enough to hold him down, and he kept Tony spread out for himself like a banquet feast. Tony had learned quickly that day that Steve wasn’t a man to bullshit or tip-toe around sex.
I’m 20
“What Lieutenant Gramsci is referring to are individual codes,” Tony explained and held up his left hand. “You have one, also. Credits pass directly through the codes and cannot be used by others without explicit authorization.”
Steve jumped in before Bucky made a grab for Tony’s face. With a grunt of effort, he shoved Bucky a safer distance from the table. “Mr. Stark, this is the third victim found in seven days. Each of their bodies were posed—”
“Because you eat like a teenager but you look like—like—uhh.”
As Jane listened, her exasperated look calmed into a gentle smile. Tony knew it was friendship and kindness, but a deeply insecure part of him still continued to whisper,
“I might know something about what you’re talking about,” he replied under his breath, “and it’s all thanks to this man I found who listens to me, respects me, and who never lets me forget what it feels like to be loved.”
With a sad grimace and a quiet huff of regret, Tony nodded. “I wish someone would pay me to put on 40 pounds of fat. I’d cook everything in lard and eat pancakes for dinner. With real maple syrup, too.”
“What if it was a proposal?” Tony guessed, and when Steve nodded jerkily, he mirrored it,  nodding in understanding. “Right... okay, Steve? Listen. I like you—a lot, uh. Actually, more than I, I thought I would like someone after—you know what? It doesn't matter. I just don’t know you that well, Steve,” he said so sincerely that Steve really couldn’t fault him for the rejection. “I don’t know what all you’ve lived through. I don’t even—I mean, if you don’t want to talk about it, you never have to tell me, but, it’s not that I don’t want to know. To know you. Get to know you better. I do. But, if, if this’ll give you peace of mind, it’s… I mean, we can sign a detailed prenup, so nobody has to worry. If this goes south, we separate amicably with what we had before, like any other break-up.”
“Sorry, library,” were the first words out of his mouth, while Tony was busy making demands on his end of the line.
Steve froze inside Bucky’s empty bedroom. A part of him knew Bucky’s teasing had gone too far - he knew Tony was too smart not to put it together - but that didn’t mean he was prepared to confront it yet.
Steve stared, horrified. “No,” he said before he could think of a more diplomatic way to express himself.
Tony pressed two fingers over Steve’s lips to quiet him. “Very flattering, but I have to say it’s hard to believe you thought you were immortal, but you never considered Thor?”
Steve frowned into his empty glass, then glared at her. “What’s that supposed to mean? I’m not rich enough?”
“Clint’s two doors down, but at least we won’t have to worry about mom and dad on this side of the house,” Tony told him, his voice still lowered. “This was the whole house until I was eleven, when dad learned that sound carries through the air vents. So, he added a second wing and saved us all.”
hero.
“You already have,” Steve replied, a corner of his lips curling up in a shy, lopsided smile. “Look, I know it can be good, I’ve seen it. I just haven’t had that, yet. I want it to be you,” he added, his words stronger and more confident. This, he had no doubts about. “I want this to be with you.”
“It’s still pretty close, this way,” Tony said in a rush and took off. It wasn’t too difficult to keep up with him, and Steve found himself losing himself more and more to Tony’s concoction of wizard and muggle stories from London’s past. But sometimes, when Steve felt the urge to put his arm around Tony, to hold him close or to lean in and nuzzle at his soft hair, he was reminded of what was missing, and he would bitterly remember the boundaries between fantasy and reality.
“Tomorrow, Steve. Pack a weekend bag. First thing after we land tomorrow, we’re getting married—and this time, we’ll do it right.”
“And how does that make you feel, Tony?”
Whether he meant to pause or not, the audience’s reaction forced his hand. It started as thundering applause and grew into a standing ovation, whistles and hollering and an incredible, sustained roar that Steve felt deep in his bones. He wanted to run out to them and share in the excitement, but all he could do was thank them over and over again, until eventually they were reined in and told to sit.
Anonymous students passed Steve in a blur where he had suddenly become rooted to the asphalt. He couldn’t speak, he couldn’t move, he couldn’t even breathe. All Steve could do in those precious seconds was to listen to Tony’s stumbling silence as he fumbled for a natural way to save himself.
Five minutes later, Tony shoved Steve into the fleeting privacy between the stacks overlooking the reading room. His own belt and jeans were undone, and if he could only tear himself away from Steve’s soft lips and his clever tongue, he could get on to his prize. But Steve’s arms were quickly closing around him, too lost in the kiss to release Tony for anything.
“To be honest, I’m not sure why I’m on the telly either.”
Instinctively, Tony threw an arm over his mouth before he cried out and woke his neighbors. He threw the other arm over his eyes for good measure, because this couldn’t be real—this was not real, he must be dreaming, he was unraveling at the seams and Steve was only getting started.
“Thanks, Sharon. I’ll be there.”
They grabbed their food to go and wandered out to the sand. It was easy finding a spot for themselves, and Steve pulled a blanket out of his bag for them to sit on.
“I don’t know,” Bucky promised, speaking as calmly as he could manage. “Steve, he could be in a different bathroom of the palace for all we know: their foyer is three times the size of this apartment—”
“Fifty dollars for a jockstrap?” Steve muttered to himself as he inspected something garish and glittery (a description he’d only now learned wasn’t inherently redundant). Whoever Neiman Marcus was, he clearly was out to personally offend him. “It won’t even hold an avocado.”
“Right, him. Amy Adams. Eddie Redmayne.”
Steve had been too busy scanning the salon for an available manicurist that he hadn’t noticed the black man standing behind the reception desk.
“Any, uh. Tony, do you have time for drinks or, or grabbing a bite to eat? There’s something I want to talk to you, uh. Something I want to talk to you about.”
Steve pressed his lips together and was silent for some time before something else came to him. “Sharon Carter,” he said urgently, “my, my friend’s niece. Was she—”
“Not anytime soon,” Tony promised. “Sundown. Six, maybe seven?”
“Sorry, these, these are the standard Barking questions,” Chris said to Steve in a hushed tone of apology, “it’s what we ask everyone. They’re typically dog handlers, but—”
“That’s a good one! Good job, Captain America in the lead,” Carl grinned happily, “someone’s competitive, I see.”
“Try it, it’s good. Chewy,” Tony remembered to warn him. “Maybe just the tip? There’s more flavor there—what?” he stopped talking as Steve spluttered through a burst of laughter. Steve couldn’t yet speak coherently when Tony’s words caught up to him.
Slowly, ever so carefully, Steve pressed the fattest bead against Tony’s hole. Tony whined, strained and breathless, as his body stretched to accommodate a girth of two and a half inches. When he dared to open his eyes, the first thing he saw was the spellbound expression on Steve’s face as he watched the toy sink deeper into Tony’s body with minimal resistance. He pulled the toy out slowly, clearly wanting Tony to feel the burning sting of discomfort of every glass bead more than once.
Steve obliged him, even as he rolled his eyes and grumbled to himself about how they clearly differed vastly in their definition of what was sexy. “There, happy?” Steve asked rhetorically as the bedside lamp cast a spotlight on them, and then, before he chickened out, Steve reached over his head to pull the shirt off.
“I know exactly four things about Trafalgar Square,” Tony said on the way, walking closer than usual so they could easily hear each other while they walked down the busy street. “It’s named after a battle, it was featured in Hanson’s MMMBop video, it kind of commemorates the last execution of a British monarch, and it is the only official location of American soil in this country.”
“I can’t—it’s not my place to tell you, Tony,” Clint said more quietly. “But, I’ll say that she cares about you. A lot. She’s not binding herself to Chief Talia because she wants to, she’s doing it so we can be free. She’d rather be with you in some smelly, stupid cottage.”
“Yeah—yeah, got it,” he promised, taking the wasp before Sam ran off. “Buy me time!”
“I wasn’t trying to, or even trying to be funny. There was a time I thought maybe PTSD was interfering with, uh… That I couldn’t get excited. At twenty-two that’s a scary thought, it was awful - and one time, a woman even left. I was useless to her so she just stopped in the middle of, of everything and left.”
Tony scoffed and looked away from Steve long enough to give her an unimpressed look. “Cause he fucking owned you guys?”
“Where are you?” a familiar voice whispered.
“I’m afraid my good luck riding days are over,” Tony say with an exaggerated sigh, but he grinned up at him a moment later. “Let the young’ns have a go.”
The news was met with murmurs of discontent and shameless name-calling. Even though it was Steve’s first time leading an interdepartmental effort, his reputation preceded him and his experience on the force made it easy to delegate work effectively. He knew what detectives did, could do, and would do. He knew when to push and when to give people space. Federal agents tended to err on different ends of the spectrum: they either treated cops like untrained rookies or worked them like dogs for their own credit. All things considered, the detectives at the 62nd were about as pleased with the decision as Steve and Bucky.
Steve and Tony got disapproving stares and tutting as they made their way back to their table. Every one of their friends turned to give them knowing looks, but they said nothing. Steve quietly shifted his chair closer to Tony’s so he could keep his arms around him and rest his chin on Tony’s shoulder. He wasn’t so good about leaving distance between them after sex, especially when it was rough, but Tony only ever indulged in Steve’s after care.
“I have work in the morning, Tony. Everything I need to get ready is here.”
Steve closed his story book when Tony took a seat beside him. “Lunch break?”
“I’d like that, Tony,” Steve assured him with a smile, chasing his worry away with a chaste kiss. When he straightened again, he held Tony’s lunch up and pushed it into his hands.
“Chemistry wasn’t that hard, just took like, thirtysomething hours, and—”
Steve scrunched up his face in confusion. “Who? No offense,” he said to Bruce quickly as he realized that must have been the third person in the room, “I don’t know any of you, but at least Stark’s looks familiar. I’ll go with him.”
She promised him she was at peace. She promised him she was anxious to see his father again.
Distantly he knew it was a tiny detail to focus on, and that Steve was probably rushing to get to him, but that acknowledgement was overwhelmed by the reminder that soon Steve would not be calling him. Soon, Tony would have no reason to receive Steve’s texts, phone calls, or delivered flowers to remind him that Steve was thinking about him, that Steve loved him.
“Go before you’re late, do the show and come back safely. Please don’t die,” he felt the need to say even though it sounded silly, “because if you do, I will do my best to date Anna Kendrick just to get back at you for making me a widower. Okay? And if that’s not incentive enough,” he said, lowering his voice into a deep, guttural growl. “When you come home, we will watch tonight’s show together. I am going to suck your dick through the whole monologue, then eat your ass out for every second that the musical guest is performing. How’s that for clear instructions?”
"Uhh, sure," Bruce said, clearing his throat. "Your Highness, based on what I saw, I think we can expect quite a big assault. Thanos is the most powerful creature in the universe, and if the size of the ship that he attacked us with is any indication, his army is massive."
He’s wasted so much time languishing in despair over HYDRA and Bucky, when he could’ve been taking Natasha and Peter’s advice and asked Tony out on an actual date.
"Sounds good."
“I do understand your frustration, Master Peter,” said JARVIS.  “However, I do not believe that would be enough to uphold in a court of law.”
don't stop!"
"Yeah, I think we're good to go," Tony said as he finished inputting the final set of parameters for the projection. If everything went according to plan, once the glasses were able to form the connection with Bucky's hippocampus and the trigger words were spoken, whatever memory his mind recalled would then be outwardly projected inside the panic room for everyone to see, with Sam prepared to try and talk Bucky through it if it seemed like he was in danger of slipping away.
"Yeah, that's what Steve told me." He caught Bucky's eye, motioning for him to come closer. "It all right if JARVIS takes a scan of your arm? The holograms can be magnified, helps me see the problem faster."
"Oh, honey," he said, laughing. "He means that we're famous."
Thank you so much for all of the wonderful comments!  I’m so glad you’re enjoying the story! 💗
"I'm afraid it's too late, Captain," JARVIS said, so smugly that Steve gritted his teeth. "Mr Wilson reports that he will be up shortly."
Not. Fucking.
Removing his earpiece, Steve poked his head out of his simulator cockpit, smiling as he caught Tony's eye. So far, and despite Bucky's frequent teasing and innuendos, he and Tony had managed to keep things mostly professional during their simulator sessions. It had not been easy, though, especially since simply hearing Tony's soothing voice through his earpiece was often enough to get Steve aroused.
And he definitely still enjoyed being cuddled to sleep, sandwiched between his dads and listening to their distinctive heartbeats as they lulled him to sleep. It was something he hoped to never outgrow.
And Papa… Peter always could tell when he was trying to hide how scared he was, even though he knew that Dad and Peter could both see right through him. And he was
They’re all back at Ma’s house in Brooklyn, likely being fussed over as she passes out noise-makers and sparklers like it’s New Year’s Eve, ordering them all to cheer themselves hoarse for her ‘Steven’, or else.
"No, no, it's okay," Tony said quickly. He reached for a bowl of chicken broth sitting on the bedside table, bringing it under Steve's chin. "Bruce says you've gotta drink this before you get anything else, even though it'll probably only last you about three minutes or so. But if you're able to hold it down okay, he'll bring you something more substantial when he comes back."
"No, you don't have to fix it," Uncle Bucky said sternly. "What you need to do is get as much rest as you can so that when Tony does get Steve home, they'll be able to see you right away. Okay?"
"But he's all right now, JARVIS?" Steve asked.
Stepping back, Tony picked up his cup as the hologram brightened and the red dot appeared, bursting through the simulated missile until it emerged in a shower of sparks, this time accompanied by the smaller components he’d designed to break off from the main missile’s body.
"Okay, okay, we can work with this," Sam said. He took a sip of his coffee, his calm demeanour already easing Steve's frazzled nerves. "You said it was Peggy on the radio with you?"
"So instead it was just hanging over your head? That doesn't seem fair to me."
As it was, they had spent most of the night doing anything but sleeping, both trying to take the other's mind off of what was coming. Tony knew it was probably hypocritical of both he and Steve to use sex to distract themselves, but at the time neither of them cared. Any sleep they'd managed to get had been fleeting and plagued by nightmares, so after a while they just decided to hell with it and took turns pleasuring each other until they dozed off, only to wake and start all over again.
"Holy shit!" Peter exclaimed, wincing as he shot Tony an apologetic look. "Sorry, but… whoa! You actually held the Power Stone in your hand? That's insane!"
Finally, when their bodies were sufficiently relaxed and the water had started to cool, they towelled off and got dressed to head over to the school.  Tony was relieved to see when they arrived that thanks to Happy’s diligence with his security forces, the school grounds were completely free of reporters and cameras.
"Mmm," Peter grumbled as he moved another pawn. "I keep forgetting that you can hear like me and Papa."
"All right," Tony said proudly. Slowly, he raised his right hand, splaying his fingers just as Steve entered the lab, carrying two steaming cups of coffee.
"It is indeed, Master Peter," said JARVIS.
"Yeah," Tony said slowly. "That's gonna be kinda important too."
"Welcome Captain Rogers, Mr Stark," the chairman said, clapping his hands to ask for silence. "We appreciate your presence in this chamber today."
"Um, hi," Peter said with a rather awkward smile. "I'm Peter Stark-Rogers, and this is my dad. He's Iron Man."
"I believe that Master Peter gives Finley four pellets in the morning, and four again in the evening, sir," answered JARVIS.
"Yeah, I'm sure Liz's mentioned you once or twice," Mr Toomes said. He shifted his arm carrying the files, causing the top file to open slightly. "Well, if you don't mind, I've got some stuff to do upstairs, so…"
If the last year had proven anything, it was that no one, not a single person who was alive, dead, or yet to be born, was stronger than Steve Rogers.
"Anytime," Pepper said with a wide smile. "Talk to you guys soon."
"Pretty sure it's one of those things where if you have to ask, you can't afford it, honey," Tony murmured. "But why does it matter?"
"Nice one, babe," Tony said with a scowl. "Now you'll just end up watching it when I'm not around."
Flash gave a shrug as he bit into a slice of pizza. "Yeah, well, he kinda had an unfair advantage, I think. I'm sure if I got frozen for over sixty years that I'd still look the same too."
The next chapter will feature the big confrontation, and then a shorter epilogue will close out the story after that 😊
After playing a few rounds of Yahtzee with Bruce, Clint, and Pietro in the living room after dinner, he and Tony called it a night and retreated to their suite. Steve had no qualms that he'd be able to sleep that night. He never slept well on the night before a mission, but he had some hope that he and Tony would at least be able to rest a bit. After washing up and brushing his teeth, he climbed into the bed and turned out the overhead lights, idly flipping through his bedside sketchbook while he waited for Tony to finish up in the bathroom.
Nope, it was definitely
"Please, sweetheart?" pleaded Steve, shifting so he could reach for Tony's hand. "You have that look on your face again, and—"
"Great!" Ned said, his smile so wide that Peter was surprised his face hadn't split open. "You hungry, Peter?"
"No, I don't mind. And we were thinking of just holding the party outside, in the front yard. We'll get some tents and tables and portable bathrooms so there won't be any need for people to be traipsing around inside the buildings."
"I'll be right back, honey, yeah?" Tony said, softly kissing Steve's cheek. "Think you'll feel a lot better once we wash all this grime off of ya."
"No, you didn't! 'Cause I didn't ask!" Tony shot back.
"Mmm," grumbled Clint. "Tell me about it. And with that, I'm outta here. All this talk about food is making me hungry."
"About a week, bud," answered Tony. "Little less."
"Who else knows that you've been visiting my son?" he asked.
Apparently, this was God’s or the universe’s way of knocking him back down a peg or two.
"I don't know," Steve said, scanning the area as Clint notched an arrow. "Tony, Sam, can you guys see who's firing at us?"
“Thanks, old man,” he whispered.  “None of this would’ve happened if you hadn’t—”
But only if he kept on moving.
"Someone either associated with Damage Control or someone associated with a member of Damage Control's oversight, yeah," Tony answered. "But hell, Steve, that could be any number of people! D.C. is filled to the brim with wanna-be government leeches and lackeys!"
The walk to the infirmary passed in a haze of pain and nausea, and before Steve knew it, Bruce was pushing him down onto a gurney and taking hold of his right forearm, shaking his head as he examined the bloody, swollen mess that was his hand and fingers.
"Yes, please."
Complete silence met his words, with both women staring at him for several seconds until Nebula glanced at her sister.
Tony clung tightly to Steve's hand as they headed across the vast yard of the Compound to the main SHIELD building, where Scott Lang was being held in the sub-basement brig. Fury had offered to have Maria Hill conduct Lang's questioning, but Tony had adamantly declined. He wanted to hear directly from the horse's mouth exactly why in the
And that just wouldn't do. Becoming distracted was practically a death sentence for a fighter pilot, especially one flying an experimental aircraft, and Steve had worked way too hard to get where he was to just throw it all away.
“Oh, I’m gonna take that as a yes!”
"You're welcome," Tony whispered, just as Steve's large hand curled around his shoulder, pulling him into an elated hug.
"Yeah, I think I'd prefer that," Tony said. No sense in them getting arrested for treason before they'd even committed it.
Which was why they often had to buy Lucky Charms by the palette.
!" Tony shouted as he was slammed in the back by yet another missile, this one managing to dent his armour. "JARVIS, how many more of these fuckers are there?"
As it was, by the time they arrived at the hospital and Ma ran in for the wheelchair, Steve was closer to death than he'd ever been before. He could only recall a few moments of consciousness over the next several days as the medical people worked around the clock to loosen the thick, rock-hard mucus that had become lodged deep down inside his small airways so they could feed his oxygen-starved lungs. Steve shuddered as he recalled the claustrophobic oxygen tent, the eerie
"Nah, we're too old, or not cool enough, or some shit like that," said Bucky. "Isn't that what Петр said the other day when I asked him what the hell a vine was?"
"Is your Uncle Clint always this grumpy?" Gwen whispered when they finally arrived in their suite, with Uncle Clint making a beeline for the bar as soon as they stepped inside.
Watched as he audibly pleaded for Peter's numbers to return to normal. Or at least, to be better than they were.
"All right, all right, there'll be enough time for all of the sweet-talking later," Colonel Phillips cut in, clearing his throat. "Let's get this moving, yeah? I'm hungry."
"Go ahead and put her through, J."
"Are you talking like, a place? Or—or some kind of—"
"Yeah?"
"Peter—" Gwen started, but Peter cut her off with another kiss, hugging her lithe body as close to him as he dared. He wanted so badly to do more than just kissing, but he didn't dare push anything. Her dad was a cop, after all. And he was a gentleman, like Papa said.
“I’m fine, Tony,” Papa said, sounding anything but fine as the interface completed its connection.  Not three seconds later the lights dimmed, and the lab was suddenly filled with the dusty debris of a freshly destroyed cement building.  In the middle of the debris sat Papa, dressed in Army fatigues, his face covered in grime and camouflage paint and clutching his right upper leg, which was bleeding through his fingers.  Dad jumped as Papa suddenly froze, gripping Dad’s hand so hard his knuckles went white as Dad started whispering soothing words into his ear.
“Oh, God!” he said on a gasp, pressing the dog tags into his skin.  “Please, don't take him from us!  Not now, not—!”
"Oh my God," Steve whispered. "Tony, I wish you would've told me this a lot sooner!"
"Well, yeah, but I didn't know if your dad thought it would be safe for you to leave the Tower," Gwen said. "Although if you want, I'm sure my dad wouldn't mind coming to pick you up."
Sam gave a shrug. "And, what do you think?"
too much coffee, a beverage he had never really enjoyed.
Peter obviously hadn't been around while his father was growing up and therefore had only heard about the deconstruction of Dad and Grandpa's relationship from Dad's point of view, but based on his own observations and his relationships with them both, it wasn't too shocking that they'd had their various issues over the years. Both of them were stubborn as hell—as was Peter, but that was currently beside the point—and also very forward-thinking, something that Peter's father liked to call being a futurist.
Peter had said, which was absolutely correct.
Pepper gave a nod. "All right. I'm sorry I had to dump this on you, Tony, but like I said—"
"Only what I've heard through SHIELD and from Agent Romanoff, who had some prior experience in dealing with him," Tony said, as casually as possible. "I know that he was considered a prime suspect in the destruction of our Malibu home and also attempted to kill Director Fury a couple of times, but other than that I have no further information."
Steve laughed.  “And I’m sure it’s pretty fitting for you, hmm?”
"Yeah, that sounds nice. Thanks," Steve said as he slotted the idea into its appropriate mental compartment. Based on what he'd observed it didn't seem like Anthony got to go to his home very much, not too surprising since Peter wasn't there anymore, so an after-dark picnic might just be up Anthony's alley.
"JARVIS, is Peter all right?" he asked.
." Tony's teeth dug into his bottom lip as he glided his hands up the broad planes of Steve's back until they hooked around his shoulders, pulling him closer and pressing their foreheads together. "Feels so good, baby. You're too good to me."
"I know that," said Steve. Inside the room he could hear Tony still talking to Peter, telling him some story or something that only the two of them would understand. "I'm gonna ask Tony to marry me, Ma. As soon as I get back from the mission. I've already bought him a ring and everything."
"Honey?" he said. "Are you—are you still there?"
"And now we're gonna save him again, mo grá. I promise," Steve said. "Whatever it takes."
want a repeat of it.
"Steve, talking to your spouse about it is fine," said Sam. "Just let me know soon, okay? 'Cause as much as it pains me to admit it, the Mets are looking pretty good this year, and I'd hate for you to miss out."
"I'm the Captain, Tony," he said. "So that means I can't afford to do anything that'll shake the team's confidence, and especially not when we're so close to eliminating HYDRA. Once that's done and I know Peter is safe, then maybe I'll think about it, but I can't do it now. I can't do anything that might split my focus."
"No! Please, no!" Bucky cried as Sam grasped onto his right hand, not taking his eyes off Winter Soldier, who had almost managed to break through the restraints holding his metal left arm in place. Bruce was on his feet as well, standing by the back wall and looking like he was ready to pounce.
"I'm kinda hoping that Thor might show up again once we start," Steve said, watching with amusement as Tony scooped up the remaining sauce on his plate with a second slice of bread. For all his grumbling about Steve making him eat regular meals, Tony never complained all that much about the food itself.
"Well, I sure as hell never thought I'd be looking forward to fighting against Thanos' army again," Clint said as Steve wrapped up his speech. "But if that's what it takes, then—"
In fact, if his memory was correct, and it always was, Bucky had managed to skip out on paying the last three times, something Steve would be sure to pass along to Sam once he saw him again.
"All right. See ya in a minute."
"Peter!" Dad yelped again, causing the guy holding Peter to flinch. Dad held up one hand, his eyes as wide as pie tins as a huge weapon formed at the end of his other hand, pointing directly at Tattooed Guy's face. "Goddamnit, you idiot, I told you he's just a kid! You're really gonna hurt a kid?"
Steve chuckled as he leaned over to kiss the back of Tony's hand. "You know they always do. Bucky still thinks Peter hung the moon, so…" He trailed off, again shaking his head at the true absurdity of what had been the last several weeks. Scott Lang's sudden appearance at the Compound. Figuring out the quantum tunnel. Spying on the parallel universes, and getting to see his ma again.
too old to be pulling all-nighters.
“Tony, wait for me by the door.  I’m almost there.”
"Um… something else is wrong, isn't it?"
"Yeah, I know," answered Peter. "I'm just looking."
All the more reason for him to get his ass up off the floor and start working on a rescue plan.
Steve had feared his whole life that he would wind up alone, that he would never find someone who loved him, would never have a child he could call his own. That fear had thankfully,
"But you can't even agree on what's best!" shouted Peter. He tore himself from Dad's grasp and shot to his feet, running his fingers through his already wild curls. "You guys have been going round and round about this for weeks already, so which is it? What exactly is the best for me?" He paused for a second, his heart racing so fast that he felt lightheaded. "Sometimes I think you wish that I was still that weak, sickly kid that I always was, instead of what I've become."
Steve gave a nod, swallowing against the knot in his throat. "Yeah. Just went down the wrong pipe is all. No big deal."
Peter thought for a moment, contemplating if it was worth asking his next question. "JARVIS?"
"Yeah, I'm good," answered Peter. "Nothing much to report."
Steve, who Peter seemed to emulate almost as much as he did Tony.  Peter had loved books since he learned how to read at age three, and had taught himself how to draw almost as soon as he could hold a crayon.  Tony had already lost count of how many times he’d witnessed the two of them with their heads bent together over their sketchbooks, working on whatever latest drawing had caught their fancy.  Or how many times they'd gotten into debates about books, discussing character motivations and timelines and plot holes, and other such stuff.
"Holy shit, I can't even believe you," Tony whispered, pressing his lips to Peter's ice-cold palm. Then he looked his father straight in the eye, his jaw so tight he could hear his teeth grinding. "You are never to come near him again, you understand? Not. Ever. Again!"
And if he wasn't going crazy, which he knew was entirely possible, he could've sworn that the high-pitched piercing noise was getting louder.
"Well, they did a good job," Gwen said. "Your dad likes Audis, hmm?"
(See the end of the chapter for
"Yes it is, Captain," said Anthony. He gestured towards the two simulators. "If you gentlemen don't mind climbing in we can get started right away."
Too frozen to move, Tony could only stare at Fury’s face, his heart thudding as he waited for Fury to tell him he was joking.
“Yeah, okay.  But why the hell do you know his first name already?  Did he just tell it to you or something?  What kind of guy is he?”
“Because we have orders for those rifles, Tony!” Obie exclaimed.  “Orders placed via the military contracts that pay all the goddamn bills around here, in case you've forgotten!”
"Ah, yes," O'Brien said with a nod. "The Battle of the Continents. The day that will live in infamy, so people say."
Grief that Steve was still attempting to push aside, choosing to focus only on Tony at the moment. They could mourn Peter together once he was back on his feet.
"Oh. Yeah sure, that's fine," said Peter. "Did you remember to bring your sketchbook with you?"
“Yeah, I don't do too much without a backup plan,” says Tony.  “Got caught once without one, and that was all it took, ya know?”
"Thank you, Colonel Phillips," he said as he glanced around the room, pausing just long enough to make a quick eye contact with Carol before turning his attention to his slide.
He brought Steve's hand to his lips and pressed a slow kiss to his knuckles, still covered in bruises and scrapes from one of his morning workouts. It was going to be a challenge, and a very expensive one at that, but once he could get it figured out… well… like Beck had said, the applications could be limitless.
"Good. Then let's go with that," Tony said. He collapsed the hologram and reached for his coffee cup, which had annoyingly gone cold already. "Is Steve awake yet, J?"
And then, his left arm shaking with the effort of keeping it in place, Steve squeezes his arms against his head and locks his hands together.  The pain in his left shoulder ramps up to an almost unbearable level as Steve holds the position for three additional Brooklyns, but he forces himself to lower them slowly anyway, breathing out a long breath once they’re safely back in his lap.
It was almost funny the way Obie’s expression changed as they filed inside the office.  From the despicable
"He doesn't know, Tony, which is why he came here," Steve stated. "He brought the device that he used to enter the Quantum Realm, and he said he was hoping that you and Bruce could maybe figure out how to work it. And then—"
It was the first time that he'd managed a smile since HYDRA had ripped Steve from his arms more than a week ago.
"Long as I can get all the kinks worked out, buddy," answered Tony. "And then, yep. Yours is second on my list."
"No, babe, we don't," Tony said softly. "But like I said, we've already taken care of Smythe, so now we just need to focus on finding this Raxton guy."
Natasha laughed, tucking her hair behind her ear. "Well, you know it's not actually meant to be literal, but… hey. I didn't invent the language, I just grew up speaking it."
"Nine!" said Sam. Goosebumps pebbled down Tony's arms as he heard the word twice, in Russian from the colonel and from Sam in English.
There were a few caveats.  Taking Sam’s suggestion that maybe he didn't need to work every single hour the store was open—and Tony’s vehement agreement to that suggestion—Steve and Tony had asked the young lady who’d been covering for him, Andrea, if she would like to become a permanent employee.  She had responded with such an enthusiastic ‘yes’ that Tony had immediately told her she could transfer to the store while still retaining her usual Stark Industries salary, which was far more money than Steve could ever afford to pay her.  Andrea and Steve had already worked out a rotating schedule which would not only give him every other weekend off, but also allow him to take an actual vacation in a couple of weeks’ time, down to Delacroix, Louisiana for Sam and Bucky’s wedding reception.
"Tony—"
"But…
"Yeah, I guess it did. It sounded—ah, it sounded a lot like one of my son's monitors, and I guess—"
"Yeah," Tony whispered with a rather mechanical nod. "Yeah, okay."
(See the end of the chapter for
"That makes sense," Steve said, as he placed his hand rather possessively on Tony's shoulder. Chancing a glance up at him, Tony wasn't surprised to see that his jaw was tight enough to cut glass, as he could sense what Steve was thinking as clearly as if he were broadcasting it through JARVIS's speakers.
“Oh God, yes!” Steve rasps as he surges up to connect his lips to Tony’s.  And even though it’s brief and chaste and Tony’s lips are just as dry and raw as his own, it’s still the best kiss Steve’s ever had in his life.
"But don't you think it's a bit late for you to still be awake?" she asked. She placed the datapad on the bedside table and curled her bent fingers around Peter's hand, squeezing it gently. "You need your rest, dear. I'm sure your father is still pretty busy there at the base, so… he'll call when he can."
"Noted, sir."
"So… are we s'posed to just stand here and stare at each other now?" Uncle Sam asked a few seconds later. "Like they did in the olden days?"
But despite his team's lousy play that evening, Steve was very happy that he had decided to join his teammates for the game. It'd been a long time since he'd been to a baseball game, and while the massive and glamorous Citi Field wasn't quite the same as the old Ebbets Field that he and Bucky used to sneak into back in the day, baseball was still baseball.
Scott shrugged. "Well, I can't say I don't have experience with not abiding by laws, and I'm sure there's also a law somewhere out there that says that people can't communicate with ants either. Or turn into massive green rage monsters, but—"
It was an image that still haunted his nightmares, even now, almost four years later.
The first thing Steve noticed when he came to was that he was
Tony let out a heavy sigh as he watched most of the team shuffle towards the elevator. The fate of his husband was now resting squarely on the shoulders of his fifteen-year-old son, and his deaf archer teammate.
'Cause maybe if he would've been there, Tony wouldn't be so damned determined to shoulder the entire burden of his grief alone. Maybe he would be willing to let Steve in, to help him, so they could help each other. Lean on each other.
Damn him and his sneaky ways of forcing Tony to take better care of himself.
“I’ve already got someone in mind, Obie,” Tony interrupted.  “You don't need to worry about me.”
"Yeah, he told me that I could order pizza if he's not awake by now," Peter answered. "So—"
"So, you're not gonna forget what I said as soon as you get home now, right?" Gwen asked as they sat down on her front steps. She tugged on their clasped hands, drawing Peter's attention away from his study of the flickering light patterns on the distant buildings. "Peter?"
Summoning what remained of his strength, Steve turned away from Tony and Peter and looked directly at the window, shaking his head.
"And what about Gamora, and Nebula?" asked Mantis. "Are they dead?"
"Steve," Tony's voice suddenly said over the comm, low and wobbly with worry. "Steve, please, don't worry about anyone else right now, okay? You and Carol just get yourselves through."
"You said the drones would deliver a non-lethal strike, correct?" he asked.
"Uh huh. Love you too."
Tony breathed a sigh of relief.  At least one of his most important employees believed he was doing the right thing, and he had little doubt that Happy would agree with Pepper.
Tony thought, sniffing as a tear rolled down his cheek. The exact words he had used when he'd explained Peter's condition to Tony.
"Long as you're up for it," Sam said with a smirk. "And make me breakfast afterwards."
"And I don't mind that at all," Steve said quickly. "Don't even worry about the cost."
"Such as?" asked Colonel Rhodes.
"JARVIS?" Steve asked. "But I thought—I thought—?"
“Oh, yeah?” he murmured.  “And you can tell that just from my voice, hmm?”
I'm so close, you've gotta—" Steve mumbled, tugging on Tony's hair as Tony slid his hand under Steve's ass, squeezing it as he hummed around him, nearly coming undone himself at Steve's sharp cry of pleasure as he came, flooding Tony's mouth.
"You'll understand when you're older, Pete," said Tony as he slid off Steve's lap, smirking when Steve palmed his ass. "Much older."
“And with that, he hits the nail right on the head, ladies and gentlemen,” Tony said.  “And it’s not just the two of us.  I have a feeling there’s gonna be a lot of people who’re gonna be breathing a bit easier after today.”
"Well, I'm thinking that Thor's lightning is out of the question, so—"
“Ah, my darlings!” Mags cries as soon as Tony and Peter step through the door.  “It’s so good to see you!”
Almost like he had known it was coming.
. Even when you're all sweaty and covered in grease from working on one of the cars or something, you still smell amazing."
"What the—?" he stammered as his belly gave a violent swoop. Across the front of the woman's uniform was the very same symbol displayed on the pager. "Who are—who are—?"
"I said that I love you, and I want to please you," he said as he started trailing kisses along Tony's jawline, down to his neck as he slipped one hand underneath Tony's ass and pressed him up against him, with Tony's knees hiking up to hook over his hips. "Tell me what you want, mo stór. Tell me how I can make you feel good."
"Well, Fury's pretty good at stuff like that, 'cause he helped me with the exact same thing," said Natasha. She stepped forward, holding out her hand towards the woman. "I'm Natasha."
"Well, okay then, if you're sure," Sam said with a frown. "I guess we'll see you later."
"Yeah, it makes perfect sense," said Sam. "And you wouldn't be you if you did. But as much as we might hate it, there's just nothing we can do about it at the moment."
"Yeah, just okay," Peter said, rather impishly. He paused for a moment, glancing up at Steve as he bit his bottom lip. "So, do you think that I'll be able to—?"
"Nick Fury," Davis repeated. "And may I ask how it was that Mr Fury had enough influence with my predecessors to demand your involvement in this agency?"
Peter sighed, rubbing his nose on Tony's shirt. "You make it sound like I'm still three years old. I'm fifteen now, Dad, I can handle more than you think, especially when it involves my family. I could even be an Avenger if you and Papa would let me. To hell with that Senator and that stupid tabloid newspaper, you've seen me in training with the rest of the team. You know what I can do."
"No, probably not, but I'd really appreciate it if you could do it anyway," Peter said quickly. "Override Hufflepuff6."
As Peter watched them go, he couldn't help but smile at how Steve's hand was resting comfortably on the small of Dad's back, as if he couldn't handle being near him without touching him in some way.
And that ever since then, Dad had spent another of his birthdays frantically searching for Papa, and yet another mourning for Peter himself.
"Won't be for too much longer," Peter muttered as he shut down his computers and stacked them on his bedside table along with his glasses. Dad had mentioned at dinner that the MAUDE glasses were just about ready, so as long as Uncle Bucky was still up for it, they were planning on running the experiment sometime during the upcoming weekend.
"But is he planning on coming here?" demanded Dr Strange.
"I'll be the one who decides what's a waste of time!" snapped Dad. He pressed a quick kiss to the top of Peter's head. "If Strange won't help us, then we need to get the ship up and running, and we need to do it like, right the hell
Peter heard another blip inside his mask just as Dad got suddenly launched across the destroyed street, bouncing inside a roundabout over a block away. Peter cried out as he slammed to a stop against a clump of trees, only for the massive alien to launch his hammer and grab onto him, hurling him back across the circle right at Uncle Bruce.
Steve shook his head, shuddering as more tears dripped down his cheeks. Natasha had been saying the same thing for weeks now, absolutely insisting that it couldn't be over. That the snap could somehow be reversed.
"Um, thanks?" answered Peter. "I think?"
Steve reached for Tony's hand, relieved when Tony offered it without hesitation.
Steve's eyebrows knitted together as he pondered a couple different options in his mind, finally turning to Tony.
Tony let out a heavy sigh that turned into another coughing fit, one that had Steve gritting his teeth by its end.
Steve's heart was as full as his stomach as he stood up so Tony could take his turn, whispering something into his ear that made Peter giggle, even in his half-asleep state. Steve's heart nearly swelled out of his chest as he watched Tony tuck Peter's fluffy blankets up over his shoulder, like he was still the tiny eleven-year-old kid that Steve had first met in that hateful Afghanistan desert.
"Papa?" Peter said from behind him, trembling and frightened. "Papa, is Dad—is he—?"
A harsh, guttural groan sounded from Peter's chest, raising all the hair on the back of Steve's neck as Loki's sceptre was brought into the image. Peter was still conscious, but only barely.
"Are Dad and Uncle Bruce still working?" he asked as they headed out of the café. "I was kinda hoping to see what they found."
And then, less than a month later, she was gone.  Killed when a drunk driver decided to blow through a red light and t-bone her car.
Steve woke with a start, shivering and panting for breath as the dregs of yet another nightmare faded into the near pitch-blackness of the room. Instinctively, he reached his arm over to Tony's side, grunting in frustration that bordered on anguish when he found nothing except for the cool, bare sheets of the bed.
It was going to be a nice night for a late picnic.
"JARVIS!" Steve cried. "Where is he?"
"We've got Bruce and our personal physician standing by, so once we're able to get him out I'm sure she'll be able to get him fixed up in no time."
"Tony, I don't think this is a good idea!" Steve said firmly. He wrapped his arms around Tony's body, pinning his arms to his sides as he drew him close. "JARVIS, is Peter all right?"
"Pete!" he cried as Peter's head turned to the side, and he faded away. Tony pitched forward as he lost his hold on his son, his hands landing in the ashes that remained behind. Like grease, they stuck to his fingers and palm, but instead of rubbing them away, Tony curled into a ball on the ground and clutched his hand to his heart, hoping against hope that somehow Steve would suddenly appear over the top of one of the piles of ruins, just like he had in Afghanistan.
A few minutes later Steve returned, bearing an entire tray of sandwiches, fruit, and chips, along with a large Thermos full of Tony's favourite coffee blend. While they ate, Steve brought Tony up to speed on the repair estimates for the damaged SHIELD building, adding that Nick Fury had already managed to move his people into the temporary office trailers that Tony had brought out from storage.
“Yeah,” Steve said with a light chuckle.  “Something like that.”
… was it?
"Are you kidding? Heck yeah!" Peter exclaimed as he gingerly sat up. He could at least sip a milkshake without needing it fed to him. "Is it chocolate?"
"Uh huh, Papa, I got it," Peter answered, grateful when his voice didn't wobble. The last thing his dads needed was to be worrying about him. "You don't need to worry about me."
DUM-E let out a rather mournful beep as he stopped next to Tony, a fresh cup of coffee attached to his appendage. Tony patted him as he took the cup, which was only about two-thirds full because of how much had spilled on the short trip from the coffeemaker over to Tony's workstation.
be taking any pictures of our son!" Steve snapped, holding his hand over the photographer's camera lens. "Not without our permission, is that understood?"
"Yes, sir," said Steve. "That is correct."
"Peter, are you all right?" Gwen whispered after a moment or two. "You seem… tense."
"Ah, yeah," Peter said with a quick nod as he slumped down into his chair, ignoring the goofy look Gwen shot him. "Sorry."
"Yeah, I see it. Pete must've overheard something," Tony said, his voice laced with so much guilt and self-loathing that Steve's heart clenched. "JARVIS?"
Sam asked. "Guardians? I swear you just sounded like you were straight out of one of Peter's movies."
"Long as I don't see any issues, huh," Phillips said as he took the stack, shooting Tony a scowl as he flipped through them without even looking. "Tony, you know damn well that there's no way I'd be able to see any issues with these things just by looking at 'em written out."
"Patrol go okay?" Tony asked once they'd broken apart.
Tony laughed as he took Steve's arm, one of those delightful laughs that never failed to make Steve smile. "We definitely shall, honey. And I love the way you think."
No, sweetheart, please!
Tony huffed out a sharp breath, glowering at the viewscreen as Steve pursed his lips. The last thing he wanted at the moment was to have to leave Peter behind in New York before he'd had a chance to fully calculate the possibility of another impending attack from space. Rhodey was still up to his eyeballs in D.C. trying to help rebuild the Air Force's special ops after its decimation by HYDRA, and while Pepper and Happy were always an emergency option to watch Peter, as were the Leeds family—and even the Stacys, Tony supposed—neither Tony nor Steve felt really comfortable leaving Peter with anyone who wasn't an Avenger. The distraction of their constant worry for him was not conducive to a smooth Avengers mission.
Uncle Bucky sniffed, extending his metal left arm and rotating it at the elbow. "Yeah, it's been stickin' at the elbow joint ever since the bunker battle," he said. "I'm guessin' there's debris or somethin' stuck down there somewhere, so I asked if your dad could take a look at it for me."
"As I'll ever be," answered Steve. Returning his sketchbook to its secret pocket, he grabbed hold of his cowl and shield and got to his feet, squaring his shoulders as Sam cut the jet's engines and lowered the ramp. King T'Challa was waiting in the same place as he'd been during their last visit, flanked by his guards with his hands clasped in front of him.
"Carol!" Steve called from somewhere below. "We need an assist here!"
, Steve, Steve,
"I am all for the eating of large quantities of pizza," said Thor as he came up behind Peter, clapping a hand on his shoulder. "In fact, young Starkson, I do believe that you in fact challenged me to some sort of contest the last time we indulged in eating pizza together?"
"I was gonna tell you on the flight down to D.C. tonight, Steve," Tony snapped. "So just give me a break, okay? You're not the only one who's a bit stressed out about this whole thing."
"No, no, no, no, no," he chanted under his breath as he skidded to a stop next to his beloved boy, tapping him on the cheek with his palm as he shined the beam of his handlamp across the generator panel that powered Peter's overnight oxygen, a strangled noise escaping his throat when he saw that the hose connecting the panel to the mask was loose.
"Pete!" he pleaded, his panic spiking when Peter's head suddenly lolled to the side, his chest heaving as he attempted to suck in air. "Oh gods, Pete, don't do this! You gotta wake up, buddy, okay? You just gotta wake up!"
"Like that, baby?" Tony whispered, pressing another kiss to Steve's hipbone.
"I'll double-check with him tonight." Steve glanced down at his untouched croissant, finally giving into his growling stomach and tearing off a large piece. "I can't imagine that he's changed his mind though."
"Yes, Master Peter?"
And if Captain America was afraid of something, that never boded well for anyone.
But he knew that he couldn't. He had a battle to win first.
"Oh, really?" Quill said with a wide smile. "My real name's Peter too!"
Peter pursed his lips as he sighed, finally nodding. "Fine. I'm sure dinner's ready by now, so we should probably get into the kitchen before Uncle Thor eats it all."
"Then… don't be thinking like you're thinking, and he'll have no reason to make it," said Peter. "Right?"
"Oh God, please!" Peter screamed, clapping his hands over his ears. "Please, make it stop!"
He returned to the penthouse to find Bruce sitting in his lab, sipping coffee and going over some of his latest notes, which Tony could tell because they were still mostly readable.
Steve's heart started to thud. Why the hell hadn't it occurred to him before now?
"Well, let's not let it get cold then, hmm?" Tony said as he took Steve's arm, curling his fingers around his elbow. Steve, Tony had learned, was quite old-fashioned, always insisting on opening doors for Tony and offering him his arm like he'd seen Howard do for his mother a few times way back when. He'd finally stopped asking Tony if it was okay to kiss him after Tony had insisted they were way beyond that point, that if for some unknown reason he ever didn't want Steve to kiss him or hold his hand or something that he would let him know. Steve had told Tony a few times that he didn't have a lot of dating experience, which Tony still didn't understand because, hello? Shoulders? Arms? Blue eyes?
Deciding that he looked halfway-decent enough, Peter picked up his new camera—a birthday present from Uncle James and Auntie Carol—and headed down the hall towards the guest bedroom, where he suspected Papa was probably pacing back and forth while he waited for his cue to head downstairs for the ceremony. Like many military men—and Auntie Carol too, apparently—Papa was used to getting dressed very quickly, whereas Peter figured Dad was more likely to be pacing back and forth inside the master bedroom still only wearing his underwear and socks.
"Why don't we just take it one step at a time, okay Dad?" Peter asked, muffled against Tony's chest. "When are you supposed to meet with Colonel Phillips again?"
"Oh, he's doing fine," Steve said, so automatically that he cringed. "Well, I should say that he's going to be fine. It might take a few more days, but… he's getting there."
of an approaching sentry suit caused Peter to whip around, his heart giving a jump when he realised there were no decent places for him to hide except for the sand.
"The Stevie you used to know used to get beat up in the schoolyard all the time," Steve said ruefully. "And that was only when he was well enough to go in the first place."
"No, that's okay. You don't have to tell me," Steve said. He'd learned pretty quickly once he and Tony started dating that Tony's clearance level regarding certain things was even higher than his, and the last thing he wanted was to possibly get Tony into trouble for divulging things he wasn't supposed to.
Or at least, that was Uncle Sam's theory about it. Peter had yet to tell his dads that he was starting to remember more of what had happened down in Miami, and Uncle Sam had promised to keep it a secret unless he decided that it was doing Peter harm to do so. Dad and Papa didn't need anymore reasons to worry about him, they already had enough of their own.
"Well, it wasn't very funny," Gwen said with a sigh. "You're having bad dreams again, is that it?"
For a moment everything went so hot and blindingly white that Tony honestly believed that he'd been transported to some kind of afterlife. It wasn't until Steve tucked him against his sweat-glistened chest that he realised they had both come within seconds of each other, their hearts beating in tandem as Steve's hands splayed across Tony's back, holding him as close as he dared.
Dr Strange rolled his eyes, pulling hard on his set of shimmering ropes. "Whenever you're ready, Stark!"
Natasha sighed, but nodded. "Yeah, I get it."
"You sure you don't need anything else, honey?" Tony asked, now pressing soft kisses all along Steve's temple and cheek. "Maybe I can help take your mind off the pain a bit, hmm?"
"Okay, so why don't you give me a couple examples of these 'possible scenarios'," Tony said, his hand again curling around his left forearm.
“Thank you, little guy,” Steve said.  “This was a lot of fun.”
“Ah, Cap?” he asks.  “Ehh, you're not going into shock or something, are you?”
"That doesn't make much sense, Tony," Steve said. "For someone who loves power as much as General O'Brien, I can't imagine why he'd just relinquish it so easily unless he had something else up his sleeve."
The last thing Tony or Steve wanted was to cause Peter anymore hurt than they had already.
Tony thought as he slid his key into the lock, wincing as he heard it click open. Rhodey had told him that he was free to use the cadets' locker room as often as he wanted, and even assigned him a locker to store his toiletries. The only thing that he said he wouldn't do was wash Tony's laundry for him, even though, as Tony so helpfully pointed out, he used to do it for him during their time at university together.
"Then I'm absolutely not gonna tell him," Peter murmured as he tried to get comfortable. He knew he still had to get up to pee and brush his teeth, but he also knew that the amount of pity he'd see in Ms Sharon's eyes would be positively smothering, so he thought he'd just wait a few minutes first.
"Nah, no one got hurt," said Uncle Sam. "Might've scared the hell outta some birds, but no one got hurt."
Steve chuckles as Peter races off towards the changing stall, shifting from foot to foot as he tries to think of something to say to Tony that’s not too horribly awkward.
"Yeah, she is pretty badass," Peter said with a grin.
"Yeah, it would," Bruce said sadly. "Once the snapped people return, they'll be just as vulnerable as anyone else, so…"
Being this cold is not going to help his mood in the slightest.
"Here, baby, let me," Tony murmured as he stilled Steve's hands, undoing both his belt and the button on his pants. He gasped as Steve quickly slid his hands down Tony's waistband to his ass, squeezing both cheeks before hoisting him up and onto the bed.
It had been so goddamn
Peter bit his lip, his eyes flicking towards a door about six feet away from his bed. "Um… well… I gotta go pee, and since Ms Sharon is off today I don't really feel like calling the nurse to help me get up, so… do you think you could—?"
Scrambling to his feet in the loose sand, Peter ran back towards the monster, aiming his right fist directly for his abdomen, his jaw dropping behind his mask when his hand went right through him.
Steve watched him go, dropping his head into his hands once he was done. He'd been planning on visiting Peter that afternoon, but since they had finished their simulator session a bit early he figured that Tony would be in a hurry to complete his own work so he could get out and visit Peter before curfew started, and he didn't want to risk running into Tony at the hospital.
"Well… no, Steve, we can't be a hundred percent positive," said Bruce. "I mean, we're working with a hundred and fifty year-old Russian Bible that's got at least seven different language dialects within the translation, and that's not even including all the different variations of the modern translations. So no, we can't be absolutely sure. But I also can't see how we're wrong about this either."
"Me either, honey, me either," Dad replied. "But we'll get to the bottom of it. We always do. Whatever it takes."
Steve was
“Oh, that,” Steve says, swallowing hard.  “Yeah, I—I’m pretty sure that I—”
Which Steve had every intention of doing so, starting with the first Avengers training session in the newly remodelled training centre.
"Ever since my meeting with Beck, I've had JARVIS running a tracer on that off-site server he'd been using," Tony continued. "And that night he got a hit. He wasn't able to figure out who had accessed the server, only that it was someone in New York City, but he was able to see what they had accessed."
Home.
was supposed to be Captain America, and yet, there were some days when he couldn't even convince his own husband to eat, much less even think about attempting any kind of hero work.
"That's all right, little guy," Steve said, relieved. "Just come to bed now, okay? You have to be exhausted."
"Yeah, I know," answered Peter. "And I will."
Blaster Guy paused, his grip on Peter's neck wavering ever so slightly until he was able to regain his composure. Gritting his teeth, he pressed the tip of the blaster even harder into Peter's temple. "I swear to God, if you don't tell me what the hell you're doing here, I'm gonna French fry this little freak!"
"Tony—"
more."
Almost as soon as it registered in his mind Peter broke out into a cold sweat, setting down his fork with a shaking hand and reaching for his water glass, hoping against hope that the water would help calm his churning stomach even as he knew that it had never worked in the past. Not three seconds later his fingers and toes started to tingle and burning hot pain shot from his neck down his spine and out to his arms and legs, as if his very nerves were singeing, and he couldn't help but let out a gasp at the intensity of it.
"And?" he asked, bracing himself for the answer that he suspected he already knew.
Including his
I can’t wait to see what you think!  Please don’t forget to hit the kudos button and leave me a comment!  💖
"We could drive up with Uncle Bucky and Uncle Sam, and with Uncle Clint and Auntie Nat and the twins already there we'd be surrounded by most of the team, and not to mention all of the SHIELD agents and the drones, and—"
"No, we can't," Peter said, grinning as he pulled into the theatre's parking garage. Ned had even already asked Peter if they could go see
Steve silenced him with a soft kiss, gliding his palms up Tony's back. "That's all that matters to me, sweetheart," he whispered. "I love you and Peter more than anything, and I'll do whatever it takes to keep you both safe, you know I will."
Again.
"Ohh, Captain Rogers!" he said breathlessly. "Please, sir, feel free to come in and join us! I'm sure you would have some incredible first-hand input into these events that we're discussing!"
"You know that essay I told you about, about the vaccines and stuff? I've been working on that."
And in the chaos that followed that earth-shattering moment—literally, thanks to the earthquake that rocked Malibu almost as soon as Tony hung up the phone—Tony went from being a genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist designing weapons alongside his father and living his life without a care in the world, to a young man struggling to adjust to sudden fatherhood.
“Of course I’m here about the Jericho!” Obie exclaimed.  “You wouldn’t take my calls all weekend, and that damn imaginary butler of yours wouldn’t tell me anything about it, so…?”  He shook Tony’s shoulder, leaning so close that Tony could smell the Scotch on his breath, combined with the tobacco from the expensive-as-hell Cuban cigars that he favoured.  “Tony, do I need to remind you yet again of how important this missile is to the company?  I mean, you know how much I hate repeating myself, so—”
"They're just gonna wind up in the same place anyway," Steve muttered as he raised his fists and took his first swing at the second bag, biting back a curse as he heard another one of his knuckles snap, sending a fresh bolt of burning hot pain ratcheting up his arm. He immediately punched again, and again, and again, finally sending the bag sailing towards the wall, where it landed directly on top of the first. Without missing a beat, Steve stepped sideways to the third bag, swinging his fists so fast that sweat began flying off his forehead and nose, mixing in with the blood from his busted-up knuckles and leaving a sort of avant-garde splotchy mess across the skin of the bag.
"Nah, Cap," said Clint. "I can do it."
Tony silenced him with another kiss. It was on the tip of his tongue to say something funny, but he held back. Despite what they had found at the Mongolian bunker and how worried Steve was about it, at the moment he seemed completely relaxed, and Tony wasn't about to ruin it with one of his ill-timed snarky remarks.
"Tony, Bucky's got a point," Sam said carefully. "I know Peter's your son, but you can't fight this for him. He has to do it himself or none of it will mean a damn thing."
Until next time, thank you all for reading, and for all of your lovely comments!
And Tony would never fault him for it either. It still filled Tony with rage that it took the government leaders over a month to decide to allow the surgeons to attempt to fix Rhodey's spine after his accident, by which time the damage had grown too severe for him to ever attempt to fly again.
"Yeah, kinda like a back door that only certain people would know about," Peter said. "You told me that Dad said they undercovered a database that had all sorts of Langaran stuff in it, right?"
He couldn't.
As soon as Bruce and Scott were gone, Tony turned to Steve, tipping his forehead against his chest as Steve's arms curled around him, gathering him into his solid warmth.
"Carol and I will take off at the same time as the assigned A-shift patrols, which means that you guys," and he pointed to John and Cam, "along with Majors Lorne and Kowalski will be our air support."
But, Tony couldn't help but notice, he was also not offended or disgusted by it.
Steve grinned, clearing his throat as his cheeks flushed hot.  “Well, I’m pretty sure
"Good," Tony stated. "'Cause you know that the team's only as good as its Captain, right?"
"You sure it's not just because you want his popcorn?" Tony said with a rather cheeky grin. His heart gave a flutter as Steve pressed his lips to Tony's neck, just below his ear.
Someone had been giving Meridia Langaran tech. Keeping the playing field level enough to keep either side from getting ahead.
“Pardon me, sir?” JARVIS asked.  “I didn't quite catch that?”
He impatiently tapped his fingers on the not-glass as he waited for her to return, trying not to itch at the healing cuts on his face and growing more and more anxious by the second until he saw her coming back towards him, a slim metal device in her hand that kinda looked like a pen.
Sam scoffed as he bit into a fig. "Nah, that's nothing. Not even what I'd call work. Just… home is home, ya know?"
He had to act fast.
Gwen smiled that smile that never failed to send warm fuzzies shooting through Peter's body like confetti, and always made him grin like a complete fool right back.
Sam had also warned all three of them that Steve’s recovery was not going to follow a linear line.  That there would be setbacks, and that it would be especially important to not throw in the towel when those occurred.  Sam had spent almost an entire afternoon explaining that processing the kind of trauma that Steve had experienced didn't just mean “talking about the traumatic shit”, but that it also meant giving himself grace to make mistakes and time to rest, just like one might take a rest day after several days in a row of hard exercise.
"Well, okay then, Mr Goody-two-shoes," Bucky said as he shot Steve a frown. "What're you so testy for this morning, hmm?"
Rhodey asked. A second later, about a hundred guns slid into position on the ventral half of the ship and began firing shimmering blue bursts of energy onto the battlefield. Screams immediately erupted as T'Challa, Valkyrie, and Steve all ordered their teams to find cover, while rage and fear surged through Tony's veins, just as blue-hot as the energy blasts peppering the battlefield.
Whew!  Hopefully now things can move forward for our three favourite boys 💖.
"But I thought you said something like that went against the many-worlds rules?" demanded Papa.
"Wasn't it obvious?" Steve's words were slurred like he was drunk, his limbs deliciously heavy as Tony kissed his way back up Steve's abdomen and chest to his mouth. They laid there wrapped in each other's arms for what seemed like hours, just kissing languidly until their lips were swollen and Steve was achingly hard again.
“Steve, actually,” Steve replied softly, and while Tony struggled to keep from toppling over or dropping Steve unceremoniously to his feet, Steve indulged in the easy target Tony’s lips became now when they were finally so close. He kissed Tony, over and over again, sometimes playfully, sometimes tenderly, but always with an adoring smile on his lips. “And, if you wouldn’t mind taking me home to that cottage of yours,” he whispered against Tony’s eager, kiss-swollen lips, “I’ve been wearing this bitch of a dress for seventy years, and I’d love to get out of it as soon as possible.”
Steve wetted his lips again, eyeing Tony with no less interest than Tony felt with every buzzing nerve in his body. “What if it’s not the same?”
“You know the Beckhams?” the cellist whispered, still frozen in disbelief.
“Dinner will be starting soon,” Sharon told them once they inevitably had to move on to another group of friends. “Don’t miss it, okay?”
When Steve wanted to end the night by sharing a memory of his Christmas tradition, Tony had kissed his husband to within an inch of his life. The kitchen had been a plot twist - Tony had never visited the palace kitchens longer than to thank people for their good work - but standing around the table with Steve and their friends, rolling dough and frying it up, Tony could have burst with gladness.
“Tony, we’re not supposed to—ah, fuck it,” Steve muttered and gave up pretending to care. They both knew by now how resistant Steve really was to breaking the rules, and Tony laughed into his mouth, grabbing Steve by his ears to reel him in for a kiss so eager and passionate that Steve’s smirk faded and only his want for Tony remained.
“Tony made it clear that time was of the essence,” Dr. Odinson said as he led them through the apartment to a large, brightly lit office where a small couch had been made ready across from an armchair. “Please, have a seat.”
“Well, first of all, this clown,” he muttered, hooking at thumb at Steve. “I wasn’t on set for
Before Fury could bark at Tony for disobeying such clear laws of privacy protection, the names of all prisoners scheduled for a hearing that morning in the conference hall were projected onto the translucent wall.
It was almost too much. Tony’s blown pupils and the mess of drool already wetting his mouth, his chin, and drawing long, wet lines of spit down his throat… he knew exactly how to get Steve's blood pumping by using that thin, strained sound of his pleading voice as he shamelessly played into to one of Steve’s favorite fantasies of Tony feeling incomplete and hollow without Steve’s cock fucking into him and plugging his ass up.
“You want me to what?”
Tony followed his superiors as they were all taken through to the conference hall where Captain America—Captain Steven Grant Rogers—had been rolled out in a hospital bed. He still shivered violently in the open air, wearing nothing but the heavy cloth covering his eyes. The Captain’s long, slick hair was tied up in a bun on his head, and his beard had been hastily cut in uneven chunks. His long hair and unusual beard was to be expected; cryostasis slowed down prisoners’ heartbeat and natural cell cycles, but even so, slow hair growth over centuries added up.
Tony husked out an uneven answer in the affirmative, and what he couldn’t express in words he tried to communicate with jerking nods.
Fear shuttered across Steve’s expression, and it was so unlike anything Tony had seen in his eyes that he couldn’t begin to interpret what it meant. Steve even tried to look away from him, but Tony wouldn’t let him go, and he waited patiently for Steve to lift his gaze again to meet Tony’s eyes.
“He’s helping you out,” Bruce agreed, and Tony vindictively shoved a whole old-fashioned chocolate donut into his mouth in reply.
“He’s in his lab! He practically lives there,” Steve told them, desperate to be believed.
“Are you trying to make enemies, Rogers?” she growled, then shouldered her way past him into his room. In the time his drowsy senses processed that her anger was on his behalf, Natasha stepped into the light.
“What are you wearing?”
Caffe Italia was an unassuming little spot not five minutes from Vauxhall. Five minutes was enough distance to discourage most SIS employees from overwhelming the space at every hour, but close enough that those in need of a break could entertain a short stroll for a decent cup of coffee and some homemade shortbread.
“What about the relationship you ruined, Tony?” Steve called after him before Tony got to the elevators. Tony slowed to a halt and turned to look at him, frowning in confusion.
“Paulette’s out for the month and Erin’s got a client coming in any minute,” the man explained as Steve sank into his seat and listened. He watched the man walking away for a moment before coming back with a dish of warm soapy water for Steve to dip his fingers into.
Steve had heard through the grapevine that Brock and his study group would be getting together for the first time on Tuesday evening, so he packed up his books and grabbed his big basket of bribes to join them.
Steve frowned down at the phone again. This felt different. They weren’t at a place where they could talk about anything and everything anymore, not like they had before, but they also didn’t ask for permission before a conversation. This sounded serious.
“So empty, Steve,” he whined into the cushioned back of the couch, his eyes barely focused anymore as he drooled into the plush velvet fabric. “Need you, baby, been so long, Steve, need your big cock inside me—”
“We would like to speak with your agent—” Steve started to tell him, but Tony wouldn’t even let him finish the question in his anxious rush to be helpful.
“Right,” Bucky drawled, drier than dust. “Cause birds have dicks now.”
“I scrambled eight so far. That’s not too much, is it?”
“She pointed out how not all women have dutiful husbands supporting them, and how women were the only people punished for the consequences of sex. And then, here: General Electric, a company that had once made all women quit upon marrying, for excluding pregnancy coverage on its employee plan. GE’s lawyer told the Supreme Court with a straight face that, after all, women didn’t have to be pregnant. If they wanted to work, GE’s attorney suggested, women now had legal access to what he called ‘an in-and-out noon-hour treatment.’ He meant abortion. Astonishingly, a majority of the Supreme Court agreed. Rehnquist wrote for the majority that pregnancy was special, because unlike race or gender itself, it was often ‘voluntarily undertaken and desired.’”
At least Tony would be, no question about it.
Tony stared up at him and swallowed. He nodded, and without another word, he resumed his downward climb.
“I’m gonna show you how much you mean to me, sweetheart,” he whispered softly into Tony’s ear, “how happy you make me, especially today...” he twisted and scissored his fingers inside Tony just to hear him suck in a breath and groan, and with his fingers still spread he pulled out of his ass, leaving him whimpering Steve’s name, desperate for more.
Tony tried to sound like the indignant, blameless victim in this whole travesty, but he got no further than wheezing Steve’s name before Steve’s strong, devilish fingers honed in on the most sensitive, ticklish areas on Tony's body. It didn’t matter that Tony had grown since college, or that he’d put on noticeably more muscle since starting his company two years ago: Steve had matched him step for step. Every now and then - when Tony wore something particularly fitted around his shoulders or his arms were bare - Steve would forget whatever else required his attention and gather Tony up in his arms, testing to see if he could still lift his lover without difficulty.
“Let me in!” a male voice was shouting from the other side of his front door. “I know you’re in there, let me in! I’ll DIE!”
Steve read his expression like a book, and with a roll of his eyes, he said, “Don’t give me that look, Tony. If I’ve had anything other than gyros and baklava, I’ve forgotten it.”
Quietly, he asked, “Why would you—”
She is Cuban, Steve. She escaped Castro. She ain’t afraid of shit she will take you down
“Yeah, sure. Text me the address, Tony. I’ll be there right away,” Steve replied despite his (and Bucky’s) better judgment. Now, all he had to do was explain his momentary lapse of good judgment to his best friend.
He’d been so distracted by his friend’s unexpected appearance that he’d almost forgotten he was raising his hand. The class tittered with gossip as Steve faltered, but he did his best to shake it off and make his point.
“You’re an idiot.”
But then he heard a snap and the tension in his shoulders suddenly eased and the unyielding plastic digging into his wrists fell away. Voices spoke over him, and Steve peeled his eyes open. Dark figures blurred into the darkness of his prison, but the one nearest him, the one touching him all over and helping him lie on his back, had short dark hair and a confidence that made Steve feel safe.
Tony narrowed his eyes, and Steve smiled back, happy as a clam. If Tony didn’t want to count their important conversation about a potential relationship just because their food was reheated homemade comfort food, he was going to have to fight Steve for it.
Tony hung up the phone before Steve could respond. He dropped the phone in the chair cushions and closed his eyes to sit in silence for some time, struggling to distance himself from that humiliating conversation.
“He must have a great respect for you to be so bold,” Steve whispered in a voice so soft only Tony would hear it. “If you only knew how happy that makes me, mein Schafes.”
“Sure,” Steve whispered very, very quietly, trying not to shrink in his seat from embarrassment. His monosyllabic and unenthusiastic reply seemed to do the trick, however: Tony didn’t speak again.
Steve nudged his forehead against Tony’s with the biggest puppy-dog eyes. “That’s not fair,” he pouted playfully, “I’m not always away.”
It wasn’t long before Tony came to the bedside of an older woman who had no-one watching over her. The little sign at the foot of her bed clearly indicated her name, that she was allergic to shellfish, and that her language of preference was
There was a lot of unconnected information tied together in that one sentence, and it took Steve a few seconds longer than usual to digest what Tony had said. “What about the US embassy?”
“I… am happy for you both,” Steve figured was the most polite thing to say to Thor, but after that he was a little lost. Their secret moot had so far only accomplished revealing Steve’s intention to tell and/or show Tony how he felt, witnessing a few bets being settled, and getting their collective support.
They shared unhurried, indulgent kisses, each time pulling apart when their play got too heated so that they could ease off and try again. Tony quickly learned that Steve responded to gentle bites, but found ways to back off if there was too much tongue. He wanted to drive, that much became clear early on, and so eventually, Tony surrendered, encouraging Steve’s every touch.
“And the whole time he’s sitting across from me with his arm around his mistress, laughing like his wife isn’t home cleaning toddler vomit out of the curtains. Nine years, two baby boys, and he’s on his fourth girlfriend of the year.”
While the water bubbled up, Tony joined Steve at their kitchen table again.
“Only on better days, Graham.”
“There are twelve people I am not allowed to marry?” he repeated, slowly and disbelieving.
Steve stared at him, and even Bucky looked taken aback.
He watched as Tony wriggled free of Rhodes’ grip and stumbled back to the workshop
“Are you shitting me?” Bucky hissed across the phone before Steve could say hello. “I had to find out about you and Tony from People Magazine?”
“You are on site: the car is within a hundred yards of where you’re standing,” Tony informed him. “If you can’t get it out of there, radio back and I’ll blast it remotely. They cannot get their hands on that tech, do you copy?”
,” Tony said through his gritted teeth, “I’m free to be who I want, where I want to be. For the first time in my life, I get to be myself without answering to anyone. Does that answer your question,
“Tony: how many languages does Steve speak fluently?”
While peering around the room in search of curious insights into this man he barely knew, Steve noticed the clock on the far wall. It was well past eight on Friday morning—the judge would expect them (and especially Tony) within the hour.
Almost by accident, the alien’s silken finger brushed over Tony’s spot, and all at once Tony’s body lit up with feverish excitement again. His sudden show of interest was all it took. With renewed confidence, the student used his unusual features to his advantage, and with a dexterity that had Tony’s eyes rolling back into his head, he rubbed his long, silken thumb over Tony’s prostate and used his other fingers to caress and roll his balls in the palm of his slippery, cool hand. Tony’s skin felt like it was burning and his cock hung hard and heavy between his thighs, so hard now it was flushed unnaturally dark against his skin.
“What’s family for?” he replied with a big smirk, then with a more genuine smile, he came forward to shake Steve’s hand. “Good to meet you, Steve. No hard feelings?”
A gentle touch slid over his neck and down his shoulder, where long fingers curled with a proprietary comfort around his bicep. Steve startled out of his thoughts and jerked his arm away. He wasn’t sure what was happening, but whoever the man was, he was about to find out that Steve was more inclined to pushing back than people gave him credit for.
“Update,” the computer told them in its pleasant voice. “Specification deceased. Do you wish to assign a coroner?”
Steve grumbled in frustration, but dropped his arms in defeat. “Fine,” he muttered. “But come get me in five minutes. We have work to do.”
“I can’t get enough of you, baby,” Steve groaned breathlessly, and slowly, reluctantly, released Tony’s balls. Predictably, Tony whined his discontent, spreading his thighs further apart and arching his back to needfully press back, chasing Steve’s touch.
Tony glanced down at his hands again, this time busying himself by rubbing his thumb over the plastic label on the bottle until it came loose and peeled away.
Unrelated fun design fact: Portugal also handled their problem with storks nesting on poles guiding power lines really fucking well (imo) -
“And, and you need me to…”
After all, he knew what would come next. He could feel it, the hot, heavy weight of Steve’s hard cock trapped between them, nestled against Tony’s ass.
Except here he was, two semesters from graduating with his Bachelor’s in cultural anthropology and two minutes from being asked the question he’d been dying to hear for one and a half years. From day one Steve had known that in those confident, adventurous eyes was his future, that there was something special about this man.
“If you would just—” Steve shut up abruptly, setting his jaw and wringing his hands on the wheel. Tony watched him like a hawk, waiting for the truth to spill out of him now that he’d gone as far as to raise his voice, but it seemed Steve stuck the landing and managed to calm himself again.
A few minutes later, Steve caught up to Tony on the porch. He had pulled on his boots, and he was lingering on the first step of the porch with a mess of rope in his hands. Steve couldn’t quite tell what the rope was for, but the way Tony was tying it up had him momentarily spellbound. The effect wore off when Tony brought two fingers to his mouth and whistled twice quickly in succession, two similarly long, high-pitched notes.
Steve swallowed the last of his doubt and answered him with a subtle but certain nod. Tony smiled up at him, cupping his cheek with a hand to guide him back down for another kiss. One tender, adoring kiss skimmed into another, each more curious, more playful, more eager than the last until Steve had no reason to question how Tony felt for him.
Mischief was bright in Steve’s eyes as he hugged Violet closer like a shield between them and hid his face against her side as he laughed, and laughed, and laughed.
One after another, he laid out photos of each crime scene. “Tied down over a barrel, lathered and paddled, page 159 out of Treasure Trail. Amy Nguyen, posed in a bed of flowers in the dumpster behind a flower shop using computer cords. Page 142 of Fathers in History.”
Without breaking their slow, steady rhythm, Tony bent over Steve’s back and pressed a kiss against his shoulder. “Breathe,” he whispered, easing his fingers out. Steve whipped his head up so fast he nearly knocked Tony in the head, but Tony was already straightening behind him.
“I don’t want a history lesson, Hal!” Rumlow snapped. “Where are the fucking guns!”
The alarm in Steve’s voice caught Tony’s attention and he looked up in time to see Steve heading for the door to the hallway.
Living on East coast time in LA meant that he could wander through Vons in the morning without tourists approaching him to tell him they thought he was shorter, or shouting at him that they were with him 'until the end of the line.'
“It isn’t New York, but it sure as hell isn’t New Mexico either, you know what I mean?”
“Four years ago, I got promoted. I didn’t think I’d need to be Steve anymore, I didn’t think I’d need that life. A life of my own. I was selfish—”
“Oh, you think that’s it, it’s over? You can’t just leave us hanging!” Stephen finally complained, and Tony’s composure broke with another burst of giggling, delighted laughter. “Stick around, we’ll be right back with more Tony Stark!”
“Don’t you dare pretend she isn’t hot,” Tony narrowed his eyes in anger, and if Tony wasn’t so stressed, Steve would have argued the point just for fun. Instead, he held up his hands in a show of surrender and gestured for Tony to continue.
Don’t tell my mom
When Tony had showed up at the gate with no luggage, Steve had assumed he’d checked everything. But it turned out the man really had traveled with nothing but his wallet and his phone.
“Tony, this… this might be it,” Steve said slowly. In a rush, he turned over the original envelope to find it had been sent on October 23rd from Long Island City. Suspicious, and conveniently local.
“No… no, this is regular Coke,” Tony complained after another hesitant sip, and without another word, he dumped it in a passing trash can. “I can’t drink that.”
“You can say hello,” he heard Steve say, “but don’t spend your come.”
Steve returned to bed with a travel size tube of lubricant and a small box of condoms that he sat down on Tony’s bedside table. “No judgement,” Steve promised with a little smile when he climbed back into bed, pressing himself against Tony’s side this time.
, Tony,” he whispered, his lips brushing over Tony’s skin with every word. “You, not the money. Never the money.”
“You should see the pantry,” Clint said with a smirk. “There’s a rolling ladder.”
Brock Rumlow
“Or else? That’s some weak shit,” Brock said with a slow shake of his head, but as he looked them all in the eye, one after another, his smug smile turned darker and more maliciously gleeful.
“Yes, mom,” Tony drawled, hugging Steve a little closer to himself when Maria gave him one last shamelessly lecherous look before leaving them to it.
“Scout’s honor,” Tony promised, which wasn’t technically a lie since he’d never been a Boy Scout in the first place (right?). “He… he’s a good guy. If we get to a month, you’ll be the first to meet him - unless Rhodey’s in town, of course.”
“You are breathtaking,” he heard Tony murmur up at the dragon with great reverence and tenderness, and Clint’s stomach roiled in horrified despair. Tony was already lost, there was no chance for him now; Clint should turn and run while he still had the freedom to save himself.
“If you only knew,” Tony murmured dramatically between ravenous mouthfuls, “Bruce—I gotta carb up, I’m running on a deficit here! Captain fucking America—”
“I wouldn’t do that to you,” Steve said as he took a little side-step, knocking his arm against Tony’s in a playful nudge. “I’ll stick around, just… in the background. Starch your shirts, iron your ties.”
Tony kept his promise to take Steve under his wing. He gave Steve a domestic model of the Stark cell phone, one that precious few had access to outside of Machtberg. In difference to the Stark phone dominating most of the global market, the domestic phone boasted features otherwise unheard of, including guaranteed worldwide reception. In that first year especially, Steve was attached to his phone like a lifeline. Terrini’s foreign minister, Peggy Carter, was often at Steve’s side for him to lean on for the big questions, but if he was honest, the small problems were the ones that caused him most frustration. He couldn’t ask Peggy how he was meant to blow his nose at a restaurant with cloth napkins, it was too embarrassing. Asking Tony felt natural. Why was it so wrong for him to handle money now, and would he make a fool of himself if he pushed back against the equerries who now handled all of Steve’s purchases? If Germany took down swastikas and Nazi symbols, why does Spain still treat Franco’s bull as a national icon? Why do Japanese toilets play music? (Speaking of music: why is Eurovision so important? And who invited Australia?)
“Alright,” Steve eventually said, setting his jaw against the roar of disappointment and frustration, and instead he just pushed the pan aside and walked out of the kitchen before he said or did something he would regret.
How had this become his life? He had a dream job that he was actively sabotaging, a partner whom he admired and was actively misleading - who had now become a potential romantic interest he was lying to about his damn biology - and even with superhuman speed and strength he was still not fast enough to be ready before Tony came to pick him up. How did Tony even do it? All Steve had managed to do was shower.
“So, did… in the time you were in the city, were you involved with any nurses or doctors?”
“Hi everybody,” he said with a big smile. “Harvey, looking sharp, I like those shoes; Yuan, I’m loving those bangs on you, you look spectacular! Arlene,” he added, when the little girl shuffled to him in a hurry, shy but eager to hug him. He smiled and gently patted her back. “Always a pleasure. How’s your mother’s practice?”
“He’s worth it, I promise,” Tony said with a quiet, distracted sigh as Sharon brought him a cup of tea. She sat down with her own cup while Tony comfortably perched on her desk. “He’s considerate. He admits when he’s wrong, he works on improving.”
his ass,” he eventually told Tony before making his own demands. “What was that, Stark? Why are they stealing food?”
Steve stopped in his tracks and turned with a hesitant (hopeful) smile. “Thank you, Professor.”
It wasn’t a question as much as an invitation to discuss, and Steve stepped aside to let Natasha into his room. They gathered around his couch, Maria and Natasha on either end while Steve got comfortable on the rug. Quietly and calmly, he recounted everything: his first conversation with Tony about their priority to keep joint custody, and Bucky’s forgotten episodes of infidelity and intoxication.
They traveled only by night, and when they slept, they slept in shifts. One fortnight passed before Clint relented and allowed Tony to ride on his back; they both traveled barefoot, but in this case, Clint was clearly advantaged by his curse.
“Close your eyes, Tony,” Steve murmured then, his voice so soft and soothing against Tony’s ear that he nearly melted with it. Seconds later, Steve readjusted behind him so he could lay his hand over Tony’s eyes, a gentle, reassuring pressure that reminded Tony how nothing else mattered in this moment between them. It was so easy for Tony to close his eyes and lose himself in Steve. He forgot how to breathe as instead he mimicked the rise and fall of Steve’s chest; he forgot where he was since all that mattered was the way Steve’s panted his name like a prayer and whispered moans of praise into his hair.
There was a pause on the other end of the line. “Mr. Stark?” Steve asked, alert but audibly confused.
“Oh—no, of—sure, it’s only my baby sister’s bachelorette party, and I’m her maid of honor, but—I’m sure it’ll be fine,” Sharon explained as calmly as she could, but Steve had already stopped listening and stepped into his office. “Yeah, I’ll just—yeah, I’ll cancel, no problem.”
Tony looked down at his cold, untouched burger and his chin jerked in acknowledgement. He sat absolutely still, then cautiously asked, “Just friends?”
“Inform them that I will take the meeting,” Steve said before Pepper had to ask. “If other calls or meetings come up, either schedule them for next month or direct them to me. Until Dr. Betz arrives, bring me something for his fever. A lot of tea, and a bowl of room temperature water with some towels. And inform the staff that I don’t want any service without explicit invitation while he is recovering. You and Natasha are welcome as needed, but that door is closed to all others.”
He tried to ask ‘who is it,’ but he couldn’t get his tongue to work yet, so without waiting for an answer, he tugged on the door until it opened.
Steve watched him with a slow dawning horror, but Tony interrupted him before Steve even got a word out.
“What is this?” he asked Steve.
Later that night, Tony would all but drown himself in tapas and wine (and wine, and wine, and wine) and complain about how perfect Steve still was and how he didn’t deserve to be punched in the face for a living. That face was too perfect. Rhodey, it'd be like punching Michaelangelo's David in the face, and wasn’t that a war crime? And when Tony's finally stopped ranting long enough to breathe, Rhodey'd casually point out, you know, he thinks we're together, right?
“Hey!” the man greeted him cheerfully, as if he wasn’t as surprise to see Tony as he looked. He patted his curious terrier and waved Tony over. “Seamus and I are really happy to see you, come in. Did you sign in at the desk?”
Steve didn’t turn around to look after him to be on the safe side, but when Maria came back to him a few moments later, he quietly asked, “Did it work?”
“It was a
“It’s Howard’s grandmother’s recipe,” she told him. “It’s the only recipe we allow in this house. I’ll show you what she showed me,” she added with a smile, “so if Clint doesn’t get his act together before I die, you can show Laura.”
“So good,” Tony whispered softly, “you’re doing so good.”
getting married in fucking Jersey,” Tony rumbled against him, until finally he had enough. He grabbed Steve by the hair and hauled him in for a kiss, deep, hungry, and possessive.
Tony didn’t have two brain cells to rub together for a coherent response. His brain was melting and dribbling out of his ears, but it was okay, the way Steve held him, used him, cherished him was worth it, and it was only in the scant seconds when Steve pulled away that Tony roared his disapproval.
“Human?” Tony offered without judgment.
“No, no—of course not, I couldn’t,” Bruce said immediately, though he seemed a touch regretful about it. He looked unexpectedly close to tears. “Just, you know. They want to start a family.”
The thought of anyone else seeing his husband so vulnerable, his eyes unfocused from his head cold and shivering with a fever - it angered Steve to the point of violence. The public shared so much of their lives, but he would not let any of them have this intimacy. No one should know how he frowned every time Steve washed his hands and feet with a cool, wet cloth, recognize his thin, quivering groans of pleasure over leisurely foot rubs, or ache over the quiet sounds of discomfort and pain Tony whined into Steve’s shoulder when he sought comfort.
With a slow, reverent touch, Torin skimmed his fingers across the breadth of Ean’s back, wondering at the power yielding to his touch as he fingertips followed the curve of his spine down to his generous, muscular ass. The body offered to him was not one that any man could touch - his skin was too sacred, and respecting his purity was crucial to observing Brigid’s virtue. Now, a year since Ean’s last ritual mating, Torin could feel the chief priest tremble at his softest touch and arching his back to lift his hips up into the Mayor’s hand, begging to be touched.
“Have you been to a game before?” Steve asked through his teeth, trying to look more pleased than furious about Tony’s apparent lack of boundaries.
Steve didn’t stop to answer him. The figures were moving quickly, and like some gastronomic horror film, there was no quick exit from Taco Bell.
“They’re college students, sir,” Happy pointed out, far more skeptical. “They’d do more for less.”
, I’m not gonna—”
It was just a divorce case, Steve tried to tell himself. Yes it was a big deal to him because it was his first real case, and yes he’d still do his best to represent their client, Mrs. Hansen, but at least it wasn’t a murder case or something where someone could go to prison if they (he) made a mistake. Alimony and child support could be renegotiated in the future if necessary, which was so much better than trying to free an innocent soul who ended up in prison because of bad representation.
Steve growled, and hesitant though he was, he tried squeezing his muscles around Tony’s cock. It worked like a charm; Tony’s hips thrust forward hard enough to rock Steve’s body, and Steve groaned softly in pleasure.
“I wasn’t strong enough to do chores when I was little. The other kids… anyway, now it feels wrong,” Steve muttered, grabbing a pear off the platter Clint had carried out. He turned it over in his hands, rubbing its unblemished skin to a shine between his thumbs.
looks. "Um… yeah!"
"Only two left, babe," Tony said over the comm. "You guys should be good to go."
"Yeah, sure."
"Captain Rogers has just returned to the penthouse, sir," announced JARVIS.
“I knew you could do it, Papa, I just knew it!” Peter said as he carefully placed the glasses in their case.  Then he crawled onto the chair, giving Papa a long, tight hug.  “I’m so proud of you!”
"We're all set. JARVIS, go ahead and activate the interface."
I'm supposed to be the Captain of this team, the person that everyone else looks to, so
Dr Strange pursed his lips, as if he was already impatient with the conversation. "Yes, Captain, I did," he said evenly. "And as I explained to both you and Mr Stark at the time, I did not routinely treat children, and therefore did not believe it was feasible to—"
"You are an absolute saviour," Tony whispered to Rhodey as he handed him the phone, cradling the precious coffee cup in both of his hands as he practically stuck his nose down inside it, inhaling the delectable scent. It had been far too long—weeks, in fact—since he'd been able to find any of his favourite beverage, and after the horrible couple of days he'd just had it couldn't have come at a better time.
“Ahh!” he cried sharply, groaning as the noise only made the pain impossibly worse, ratcheting it up to such an intolerable level that Steve was shocked he was able to stay conscious.  He attempted to breathe in again, to try and force his mind back into its biofeedback mode, when he suddenly heard what sounded like a large, heavy metal door swing open from the end of a long hallway, followed by the sound of footsteps
"That's just 'cause Stevie's afraid to look weak in front of his kid," Uncle Bucky said, obviously frustrated. "Which is just goddamn ridiculous, if you ask me. That kid adores him, so I just don't get that at all."
Which meant that all he could do was keep going.
"Oh my God, that sounds awful!" Peter exclaimed. "And I thought it was impossible to destroy Mjolnir!" Peter couldn't even imagine Uncle Thor without his ubiquitous hammer; it would be like Papa losing his shield or Dad trying to fight without his armour.
“No!  Buddy, I know this really,
“Ah, your hair is wet, young Peter?  Out in this cold?” she asks as she walks them to a table.  “You had another soccer game today?”
But like Steve frequently told Peter while they worked on Peter’s history homework together, learning history was paramount to ensuring that the bad stuff was never repeated, and Tony supposed that HYDRA’s quiet concealment within SHIELD for seventy years would definitely qualify as bad.
It was the perfect example of, 'do as I say, not as I do'.
"Oh, I know that," replied Gwen. "And he knows it too, but… there's also the survivor's guilt that he carries. He lost one of his longtime partners during the alien invasion, in the same bank where Captain America saved all those people that were trapped inside, so… it's probably irrational, but I think there's a part of him that wonders why your papa couldn't save his partner, too."
"No!" Peter cried as he swooped down from his perch, launching his webs at Thanos' face. The webs landed across Thanos' eyes, disorientating him enough to allow Peter to kick him hard in the head as he swung across. A second later Drax and Gamora jumped from their hiding places, Gamora drop-kicking Thanos in the head as Drax struck him hard in the legs.
Steve's throat tightened as he smoothed Tony's hair from his forehead, leaning down to brush a gentle kiss there. "It won't, mo grá. I've ordered it to stand down for the moment." Given the time, he figured Peter would be waking up soon enough, and Steve could send him to get him some food once he came in to check on them.
Grandma shrugged her bony shoulders. "When you're a parent, there are sometimes things that you deliberately keep to yourself out of love for your child."
He had just grabbed his wallet and keys and closed his bedroom door when Howard suddenly appeared in front of him, his eyes all hooded and bloodshot and still holding the highball glass in his hand.
Of course, Tony is a business owner, and one that relies heavily on word-of-mouth reviews to grow his business, since it seemed like at least half of the Yelp reviews were from people who’d heard about Tony’s shop from one of their friends.  So he could just be that charming to everyone, which means that Steve is pretending to see things that aren’t even there.
"I do apologise for my tardiness, ladies and gentlemen!" Thor—
Before Steve could reply, an alarm began to sound overhead. Steve gulped as General Okoye pressed a bead attached to a bracelet around her wrist, generating a holographic image of Earth in her palm.
Phillips huffed, his frown deepening. "All right. As a matter of fact I do know the kid you're talking about," he said. "His full name is Peter Stark."
"Who's a poor kid?" Peter asked.
Peter studied the chessboard, contemplating if it was time to bring out his queen. "Thanks, Uncle Bucky," he said as he moved the queen, taking Uncle Bucky's other knight in the process. "I… needed to hear that."
Which only made Peter even more determined to get to the bottom of what was going on. If he could somehow keep his family from being torn apart and help them actually catch all the bad guys, then he was going to do it.
"Yeah. I guess I was. But, Pete, I—"
"Nah, Danvers, Stevie knows that," piped up Bucky from his seat behind Steve. "It's just been so long since he's tried to court anyone that he doesn't remember how."
Peter grunted, sucking in air through his teeth as he thought how best to condense such a moment into a single sentence. "Ah, the Solidarity Movement began as a Polish labour union in one of their shipyards, and eventually grew powerful enough to win control of the government from the Polish Communists in the late 1980s."
"Position locked, Master Peter," answered JARVIS. "But I am unsure as to why—"
Another Nay vote, by a lady from Virginia, followed by another by a man from Oregon.
“Whoa!” Peter exclaimed as Steve moved one of his bishops in front of his queen.  “Steve, that’s an awesome move!  You’ve got me in check!”
"Just humour me, okay, J?" Tony said, suppressing an eyeroll. "Just trying to make extra sure no one can get access to any of my stuff."
"I am very well, sir, thank you," JARVIS answered. "How may I be of assistance?"
"Copy that," Tony murmured. He glanced back at Rhodey and Wilson just as Steve's comm went completely silent, indicating that he'd broken through the atmospheric barrier. Thirty seconds later both Barnes and Carol went silent as well, just on time.
Papa's lips twitched at the question, nearly causing Peter to burst out laughing. Once again, "okay" was a very relative term, with such a fluid definition depending on the circumstances that it was pretty impossible to quantify. And it wasn't only that way for Peter and his dads, but for the rest of their family as well. In fact, Peter was shocked that some psychologist or psychiatrist hadn't yet tried to have the entire Avengers team committed after all the crap that they'd been through, not the least of which was dealing with the very same Chitauri aliens who, if Peter was guessing correctly, were trying to come back.
"Thanks."
But this was hardly any normal time.
The elevator doors had barely closed when JARVIS spoke up. "Pardon me, sir, but Mr Beck has now been officially escorted from the Tower. Mr Hogan reports he will deliver the contents of Mr Beck's office as soon as possible."
"Are you sure?" Steve asked, kissing across Tony's throat. "It has been awhile."
He heard Dad pull out his phone. "JARVIS, any info you can give me on a New York City policeman, last name Stacy?"
"All right, sweetheart," Steve said. Slowly, he withdrew his fingers, slicking up his cock before settling onto his side and rolling Tony towards him.
"Come here, honey," Tony murmured once he felt capable of speech, winding his arms around Steve's neck. He pressed a long kiss to Steve's lips before tucking his head under his chin, stroking his fingers through the hair on the back of his neck.
"Hey, Dad."
The piercing honk of a car's horn cut Peter off, and he jumped, turning towards the police car to see Chief Stacy impatiently waving his hand out the window.
After they pay their bill, which takes at least five minutes thanks to Mags’s constant fussing, Tony and Peter head down the street to the car.  They’re quiet on the ride home, as Peter seems to have talked himself out for a moment.
Wait, and try to
"Hey buddy!" Tony said as Peter stepped inside, a wide smile stretched across his round face. "Have a good day?"
Papa chuckled, his pale cheeks flushing a light pink as he switched off the television.
Careful to avoid jostling any of Peter's wires and tubes, Tony and Steve settled in on either side of him, both of their arms draped across his stomach. Not surprisingly, Steve was out in a matter of minutes, with his face smooshed into the pillow exactly like he slept back at home. Tony's heart ached as he smoothed Steve's hair back from his forehead, trailing his fingertips down his cheek to his strong jaw.
And Steve, desperate to serve his country in any way that he could, had readily agreed.
"I love you, little guy. You've got this," he whispered before stepping back. A tear rolled down his cheek as he watched Tony smoothe Peter's hair back before kissing his forehead, whispering that he'd see him soon.
And then what?
"Hey, Steve?" Natasha said as she entered the anteroom off of the Avengers' main Compound training area, quietly so as to not startle him. "Everyone's ready if you are."
"Yeah, that makes sense." Tony paused for a moment, squeezing Steve's hand. "It's a good thing you picked up those extra records from your ma then, hmm? Big band probably doesn't play very well with hidden listening devices."
"Tony, where's Steve?" Sam said again.
As it was, Dad ended up falling asleep first, falling victim to Papa stroking his hair and the fact that he'd missed one or three of his evening cups of coffee. Dad's arm was draped across Peter's side, and as he shifted slightly he felt Papa readjusting one of his heating pads before gently kissing Peter's forehead.
And with that, Steve felt his entire body relax, because of
Peter thought as he whipped around to search for the potential perpetrator, and saw nothing except sand.
Apparently Colonel Phillips still had some hope.
If there were any other space-faring races out there, they apparently didn't live anywhere close.
"And you didn't call or text me to bring them to you… why?" Papa gently asked. "You know I don't mind doing that stuff for you."
Gwen giggled as she leaned closer, so close that their lips were almost touching. "Well, now I'm hoping that we'll get that question in one of our competitions, seeing as how you already know the answer. Nothing like impressing everyone else in the room, right?"
The only thing missing was Dad.
“Pete,” Dad said, cursing when he almost dropped his phone.  “Buddy, you know I’m slammed here at the moment, and—”
And, just like Steve had promised Tony when he'd confined him to bed, once he was well, he found his unfinished armoured suit waiting for him in his lab, right where he'd left it.
As soon as they tucked Peter into bed, Tony took Steve’s hand and led him to their bedroom, outfitted in furnishings and fabrics in varying shades of blue, Steve’s favourite colour.  And there, on their brand-new bed as snowflakes fell outside the windows, Tony made love to Steve for the next three hours, showing him over and over again just how much he loved him.
"As long as it's okay with him it's okay with me, buddy," Tony murmured. He pressed a kiss to Peter's temple, wishing so badly that he could somehow make all of this just go away already.
"Wait!" Mantis suddenly said, so alarmed that both Peter and Dad froze in their tracks. Turning in her direction, Peter's heart skipped when he noticed her already freakishly-large eyes widening.
"All right, now for your back," said Grandma, gently pushing him forward. She slid her stethoscope bell under his shirt, moving it four separate times as she listened to his lung sounds.
But with no idea when or even if another attack might occur, at the moment, that was all Steve could do.
"Goodnight, Steve."
But based on what Grandpa had told Peter—and multiple times too, since he often tended to forget what he'd told him—his arrest had been nothing but a frame. That he had been set up from the very beginning by a disgruntled colleague who had somehow fled the country—apparently along with some super-secret Langaran military tech—by the time Grandpa was released from custody and hadn't been seen or heard from since.
At first Tony shook his head, still working the logistics through his mind. Finally, he snapped his fingers.
Dr Bruce Banner sometimes drives you to school," she said. "That's like… well… it's just like—"
"Yeah, it was that book that I showed you," said Peter. "Your whole family is in it. The one that Ned asked you to autograph?"
"Okay, but…" Steve bit his lip. None of that made any sense. "Bucky, my ma was an Air Corps widow too, and she told me she was forced to get a job only a month after I was born or we would've been evicted from the house. Was that compensation fund around back then too?"
Or such perfectly broad shoulders, or such strong arms, or such gorgeous, soft-looking blond hair—
“Very good, sir.  Shall I erase all public SI backups once I’m done?”
Gwen gave a nod as she walked past their History classroom, leaning against the row of lockers next to it. "And you? You're doing okay?" she asked quietly. "I know you weren't as hurt as Captain Rogers, but my dad told me that you were still pretty beat up."
Peter had also already read the assigned book, Mary Shelley's
"Yeah, I saw that firsthand with the tesseract," Steve said, remembering how the cube literally burned the Red Skull into ashes right before his eyes. "Okay, so, what are you suggesting we do about this?"
He would lose. Again.
He had taken around five or six pictures when Uncle James suddenly appeared at the slightly opened door.
Tony wound his arms around Steve's neck, rubbing the back of it. "I'm sure. Like Pepper said, she's pretty much slammed right now, and in her position she shouldn't be worrying about something as mundane as performance reviews, but she does anyway because she's that good at what she does. I'm just taking a tiny bit of her workload off of her, nothing more than that. And if this engineer Beck is anything like me, then he'd rather be doing anything else besides filling out performance reviews. I promise, honey, it's no big deal."
"Jesus, Pete, how do you even know that?" demanded Tony. "I told you that you weren't allowed to watch that stuff."
Peter watched through wide eyes as his father's face, already that sickly greyish colour it got whenever he was really scared, paled even more, and he gulped as he reached behind him, searching for Peter.
“Well…” Tony trails off, glancing around.  “I’m guessing this was like their trial area, kind of like a mini pocket dimension, but the fact that it’s still here and the Tesseract isn’t is what’s got me worried.”
coursing through him like hot maple syrup.
"Ah, yep," Peter said with a nod. "See ya." He watched as Gwen walked over to the police car, giving Chief Stacy an awkward wave as they drove away.
"Eh, no problem," said Dad. "Let me know if something goes wrong and I'll tweak it for ya."
At least not until their current crisis had passed, which, despite all of his numerous attempts, Steve was still no closer to figuring out when something might happen than he had been before the team's trip to Wakanda.
They hadn't been waiting long when Peter felt the wind suddenly pick up near the surface, throwing huge clouds of red dust into the already thick, stale air. A few seconds later the red dust gave way to a bluish-black portal, out of which stepped a giant purple dude.
Peter groaned, his belly giving a hard swoop as he watched Papa's jaw tighten, only for a second before assuming what Dad always called his
"That's 'cause he's gotta play the strict uncle right now since he's the babysitter, while I'm just—"
"Eh, I'll take a look at that later, yeah?" Tony said. "Probably something I can tweak."
"Yeah, I'm sure." Peter smiled as he sucked in another deep breath. "I'll be back in a minute."
—door. Steve had insisted on calling his barracks room "their" room ever since Tony moved in most of his clothing, but it still hadn't quite sunk in yet. Having lived in Howard's small house for his entire life, Tony wasn't used to having something that he could call his own. He'd even gotten up the courage to tell Steve about the log cabin he'd been lusting over for the last several years just a week or so ago, after which Steve had proceeded to pull out his sketchbook—
And Tony was just too tired and too frazzled to try and even render a guess as to what the hell he was up to.
"Right now we don't really have a choice, Steve," said Natasha. "With the political environment the way it is we need to tread very carefully, and going through the proper channels is the best way to do that. That doesn't mean we can't keep our eye on stuff too, but for now it's best if we play by their rules."
Even something like a simple oil change on a Lamborghini runs into the hundreds of dollars, which means that Dad could probably close up the shop for the rest of the week and still turn a nice profit.
"Oh, Dad and Papa are gonna be so mad at me," he muttered as he pushed off from the bus, shooting his web towards the top of a passing bridge, his feet brushing through the water as he swung towards the spinning ship.
Doctor List tilted his head, once again regarding Steve with an air of disappointment.  “Oh, Captain,” he said with a sigh.  “You may have believed that your little stunt with Schmidt’s aircraft was enough to kill HYDRA completely, but I’m afraid that even with your, shall we say, flair for the dramatic, you still only managed to cut off one head.”  He paused, stepping so close to the window that his long, rather beaky nose was almost touching the glass.  “And now, two more have taken its place.”
Peter chuckled as he set down the duster.  “No, Papa.  I meant it’s embarrassing for them.  It’s not like you and Dad are asking for ‘em to make fools out of themselves.”
Barnes Lane 3: 47.82
“It’s gonna be okay, sweetheart,” Steve whispered.  “I promise.”
"Well, then I know they both appreciated it," Steve answered. He pressed a quick kiss to Tony's temple then took his hand, interlacing their fingers. "Sam and I discussed my plans for the raids today on our run, and I'd like to go over them with you once Peter goes to bed, is that okay?"
"And you know I wouldn't ask for anything but your honest opinion on it, mo grá," said Steve. "We'll just take this one small step at a time." He drew Tony close again, his entire upper body trembling in anticipation. "One step at a time, so we don't get ahead of ourselves."
Steve had caught him.
"But he's doing all of that because he loves you," Peter said. "I've seen it. He loves you like my dad loves my papa."
"Hey, Steve!" Sam said as he and Bucky jogged over to Steve, sweat dripping down both their faces. "A bunch of us are heading out to the ball field for a while, you wanna come?"
universe.
Thankfully, Peter seemed eager enough to start practising with him, and his father seemed eager enough to grant Peter his wish, that Steve was able to spare himself that embarrassment.  He’s actually rather proud of himself that he asked for the amount of money that he did as well, when only moments before he was debating whether or not to charge less.
