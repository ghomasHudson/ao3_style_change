There’s a slick sound, picking up in pace. Unbidden, images spring to mind. It’s like he never left. The wall is doing nothing to protect Tony’s modesty. Steve has swallowed his tongue. His mouth is dry. He shouldn’t. He shouldn’t stay here. He should go. He should leave, and come back in the morning, and forget this ever-
Tony nods. Of course not. That would be too easy.
They’re all back from Florida now. He knows this because Peter marched in and told him so, a determined glint in his eye that was readable even through the mask. It was his posture, maybe, or the way he held himself. It spoke of an argument, and what Steve wouldn’t give to have heard whatever it is they argued about that involved Steve.
“I hear you, alpha,” Steve whispered, pressing his forehead to the glass near Tony’s thigh. He wanted nothing more than for Tony to stroke his hair, to kiss him, to tell him this was going to be okay.
There’s a click behind him, and then Bruce’s wet hands are braced across his lower back. His thumbs dig into the dip at the base of Tony’s spine.
“That is true, Agent Romanov.”
Beth laughs and goes up on tiptoe to kiss Tony’s cheek. “And don’t you forget it, mister.”
Steve smiles. “So you wouldn’t mind driving him around?”
“Do you think you’ll be able to do that effectively, and still command your team in the most objective manner possible? Even if what is necessary to the mission endangers him?”
"Testing a theory." Tony yawns a little and picks an apple out of the fruit bowl, taking a bite out of it. "What can I do for you, your incorporealness?"
“I’m not doing anything,” Steve says, completely unconvincingly, and Tony huffs a resigned laugh. He uncoils himself from around Steve’s limbs, swishing his tentacles around in the water to wash away the tight, itchy sensation caused by Steve’s sweat.
The way she looks away and turns back to the toaster says a lot.
The wide black doors to Pepper’s office swing open, and both of them turn to see the woman in question standing there with her eyebrows raised in two perfect, disdainful orange arches. She’s dressed slightly less aggressively than she had been when Steve saw her last, in a chic white pantsuit that speaks to her elegance and grace. Steve knows very few people that can wear all white and not get a speck of anything on themselves all day, dirt or otherwise.
“Oh, this is the good stuff,” he hums, blowing across the top. “Made with milk?”
“I wish I’d been more understanding,” Tony confesses. Steve isn’t sure he even remembers he’s talking to Steve now. It’s almost like he’s just talking to get it out: excise this wound that lives inside of him, clearly still bleeding even after all these years. “I’m sure it took a lot for him to share that with me. Looking back, I can see that he was doing the best he could. He loved me in his own way.”
“Be a good man and lock up after me, would you, Sheriff? You still have a key, don’t you?”
"I'll just go around this rock and think
, in its own way, he thinks.
In the end, as always, Tony saved himself. If that left a bitter taste on Steve’s tongue, well, that was something for him to carry. All that mattered was that somehow, Tony had gotten a GPS ping to JARVIS, and so the team was on their way to an abandoned Atlas F missile silo in upstate New York.
“Bruce?” he tries, but there’s no response. “Okay. What’s the situation on the ground?”
(And no, I have not abandoned my Superhusbands/FrostIron fic for anyone wondering. That monster is still chugging away. It's just slow going right now.)
“Maybe,” Steve admits, and Logan eyes him thoughtfully. “Tony and I’ve been talking about expanding. Everyone else here’s pretty attached to the life, but I know you’ve always been a bit of a rolling stone. You haven’t changed much since I first met you.”
Tony’s eyes are wild in his face. His hand is wrapped firm around Steve’s throat, trying to stem the bleeding, and he looks so frightened. Steve’s always hated to see Tony frightened, probably because it’s so rare. Tony is the futurist. He always knows what to do next, and so he’s never afraid. If he is, he knows better than to show it. He’s always been too proud for that.
“So when you pulled me in here?” Tony asks, curious now.
“Any word on Strange?” he asks.
“-and I think I’ve been pretty clear on my stance on Gyrich,” Ulrich is saying, while Perino nods. Tony’s always thought she was less horrific than plenty of her compatriots on the channel. “Gyrich’s proposed policies towards enhanced individuals have been labelled as draconian by some, and I myself have raised some serious questions about the comments he’s made regarding the situation in Latveria. So it’ll be a huge change to see McCoy, who is of course enhanced himself, as the face of American influence on the project. Many will see it as an improvement.”
“He says ‘you’re welcome’, because he’s a flaming pile of horseshit and trouble but also actually pretty useful.” Tony shivers, then freezes, remembering in a rush that he’s only wearing a pair of fitted red boxers and everything that Bruce said to him upon their little morning chat all at once. “I…have an R&D meeting. That I am late to. So. I’m gonna go put on some pants, and do that.”
The tower is always a little eerie at this hour of night, lit only by the radiant light of the city below. Tony pads silently through the dark bluish living room and steps into the golden light spilling out from the kitchen. Clint is humming a little, clad only in a cotton tee and boxers, barefoot. He gestures with a spatula at an aluminium pan filled with an uncut sheet of brownies resting on the island.
, you know that?” Riri demanded. “They do say never meet your heroes…”
“We were in the Dark Dimension,” Stephen says, frowning. His arms are folded across his chest, storm-grey eyes sharp and narrowed at Steve. “Dealing with a recurrent issue.”
“Toh-nee,” he says, dragging the syllables out. Dani offers him a smushed clump of banana, and Tony shakes his head gravely. “Oh, no, that’s your breakfast honey. You eat that for your dad, ok?”
“What was that? You don’t need me to make you any more taser arrows?” Tony calls, heading for the door.
“I know I’m not handling being cooped up well, but what you’re going through is just how your biology works. I can’t hold that against you.” Tony smiled, just the barest quirk of his lips. “I’d be a hypocrite.”
. He’d lost years, because some masked, enhanced assailants had appeared and attacked him and Cap while they were trying to run off a drug dealer outside the centre.
“Agent Barton has told me to inform you that he doesn’t have to be awake for that, and that you should just ‘dump’ the captain in bed next to him and be done with it.”
Steve frowns. He shakes his head against Tony’s forehead, noses catching. It makes him want to press his mouth to Tony’s, to draw their bodies together again.
Tony turns down the comms again, then pauses, looking down at Cap’s slack face. He eases himself out of the armour with a hiss, stepping down from the metal to take Cap’s pulse. His leg is burning, wet blood trickling down his back from where the plating cut into him just below the left scapulae. He feels like one giant bruise, but Cap’s breathing. His pulse is slowing down as Amora’s magic fades.
“Kiss me, I’m Irish,” Steve deadpans, rolling his eyes, and oh, that’s-
“If I wanted his ring size,” Steve said, knowing JARVIS was smart enough to figure out what that meant immediately.
Natasha glances over her shoulder. “There’s a bed. There’s a sink for water. There’s a toilet. I ate already.” She shrugs. “Better than camping.”
Tony hums in thought. “Is there security footage?” he asks.
“Yeah.” He glanced back, towards the door where the storm raged outside. “Want me to try to fetch Doc Banner?”
“You always want a drink,” Rogers groused, and that, at least, was familiar enough. “Stark-”
Loki flashes a feral grin as a dagger carves out a piece of fabric and flesh around Nat’s floating ribs, and Tony swallows thickly. “Um.”
Steve thinks. No, wait.
“Tony,” Steve rasps. “You can’t tell me you didn’t know.”
“I’m sorry, sweetheart,” Tony cooed, pressing a soft kiss behind his ear. Steve arched against him slightly, and Tony let out a low hissing breath. “Fuck. I really have to go.”
“Right,” Tony mutters, body slumping against the door. “Great.”
Steve’s whole body locks up. He’s terrified, Tony knows, of hurting anyone, and so instead it’s like he turns to stone. He doesn’t manage to keep his eyes open, his back bowing as his climax shudders through him, jaw creaking audibly as his teeth scrape together. The sound he makes is stifled and almost inhuman, a muffled scream, and some of his come shoots up out of the water it’s so strong, splashing hot over Tony’s wet chest. Tony works him through it, his pulse thundering his ears, weirdly echoed by the feeling of Steve’s against all of his tentacles.
Steve nods. “You wanted him to be less reckless.”
The sound of frustration Steve lets out at that approaches a scream. “Please, I’ll come again, as many times as you want, you know I can-”
“But!” Tony says, gesturing with the sandwich again, “you’re fine, and I’m fine, and we have Girl Scout Cookies, which are the best kind of cookies, because you get both cookies and vague feelings of moral righteousness and goodwill.”
“I guess I’ll try to sleep and see what the situation is when I wake up,” he said, drying his hands in the dishtowel hanging from the oven handle. “But that’s a good idea, the workshop blanket. I’ve pulled out everything I could find from the laundry.”
“Agreed.” Collins spares Tony a speaking glance, and he nods at her. The Maria Stark Foundation had just approved a grant for five million dollars to Head Start that week. Collins was the only moderate republican on the security taskforce, and Tony desperately needed her on his side if he was going to win this thing. People respected Collins. Cochran was the whale, though, and Tony needed to find out exactly what it was he needed to do to get Cochran to see things his way.
“You think you’re so smart,” Steve bites out, and Tony
Loki takes a sip of his scotch, waiting.
“Yeah, yeah,” Tony says. His expression is wry; dark circles linger under his eyes, lips pressed into a thin line of exhaustion. He places a gentle hand on Steve’s chest, pushing them apart. “I’m sure you’ve got a lot you want to say to me right now. Save it for when we can actually talk face to face, okay?”
“Well,” Tony said, and there was something strange in his voice now, something longing and desperate and sad. “We could go into your heat without a BiteBlocker, and see what happens.”
Loki’s eyes flash, then, bright gold and dangerous. The portal snaps shut, fast enough to send a shockwave rippling outwards, the wash of energy making all the hairs on Steve’s arms stand on end. It sends an unpleasant ripple through him, just enough of a distraction for Loki to take two dangerous steps into Tony’s space. The height difference between them looms large, and Steve presses an instinctive hand to Tony’s shoulder even as Thor moves forward, his own hands hovering near Loki’s arms.
“Steve,” Tony said, reaching out a hand, but Steve couldn’t bear feeling the barrier between them again. He took a step back, then another, feeling as though he was tearing his skin from his frame with every step he took away from his alpha.
Loki: Or, you could do that again. That’s cool. That’s fine. I’m not shouldering the entire burden of preparing for Thanos’ army or anything because I literally don’t have anyone who trusts me.
“I didn’t listen to you, and it almost got you killed.”
Steve smiled, turning to put the butter back in the fridge.
Natasha smiles, a little frighteningly, and Tony blinks hard.
“That’ll be all, Miss Potts,” he says. He takes a step back, waving a jaunty salute at her. “I’m gonna go. I have a meeting with the best and brightest STEM minds from the specialised high schools of New York in twenty minutes.”
Bruce shrugs. “Let’s go to California. You’ve got multiple bedrooms in your mansion, I assume? Or is it all one giant glass loft?”
“What else can we do you for?” Tony adds. Steve moves to stand abreast with him, eyes slanting towards him with something cautious. He’s only wearing the top half of his battle armour, his bottom half decked in sweatpants. He looks oddly vulnerable, caught between Steve Rogers and Captain America, soft and dangerous all at once. At least he has the shield.
The priest sighs. “Lord, what evils have been wrought in Your name,” he murmurs. “Scatter the nations who delight in war.”
“Look, Sir, I can see you're really upset about this. I honestly think you ought to sit down calmly, take a stress pill, and think things over.”
Actually, you said
“Did you need something?” Tony asks him, because he’s enjoying this way too much.
“I never meant to hurt him,” Steve says, but it sounds hollow even to his own ears. Pepper’s disappointed expression is both expected and stinging, and Steve isn’t surprised when she turns to leave.
“Nah,” Tony says, waving a hand. “Salt water hot tubs are a thing. Supposed to have health benefits. Crunchy granola bullshit, mostly, unless you count the people who want it as an alternative to chlorine in which case, sure, yeah, fewer chemicals…” Tony tamps down on his babbling and clears his throat. “It’ll mix faster that way.”
Steve wet his lips, taking a slow, obvious breath.
Sam raises an eyebrow at him. “You went on a date?”
“I know that,” he says, gesturing at her with his spoon. “Ross was already as safe an ally as a rabid dog. Now that he’s got fresh ammo to lob at us, well, time for shit to hit the fan.”
Steve’s smile stayed with him as he headed into the bedroom. Clint was curled up on his side facing the doorway, and he blinked one eye open when Steve entered.
Steve nods. “You think Natasha wouldn’t have tried to kill him, if she was in her right mind and found him on her sweep?”
,” Steve says, more packed into those two syllables than Tony had let him say in the whole nail-biting conversation that preceded the sex. It’s enough to make him concede his defeat, and he turns his head enough for Steve’s mouth to brush the outer shell of his ear. Steve obligingly nuzzles closer, lipping at the thin skin covering the cartilage, and Tony relaxes into his attentions with a soft sigh.
“I think you would, if you felt it was necessary.”
His eyes flash a warm, spring green, enough to make Tony suddenly very glad that he made the choice that he did. He sits back on his heels as Loki comes to sit on the edge of the bed, close enough that Tony can tell he wasn’t lying. There’s no coolness where his body comes close to Tony’s knee, no wafting scent of alien forests in snow. The bed doesn’t dip under his significant weight.
Steve fixes him with a knowing look. “That’s some endorsement,” he observes, before shaking his head. “That’s not the only way to hurt someone, anyway.” He offers Tony a wry smile. “You’d know. You’re good at that.”
“I am Amora, sometimes called The Enchantress,” she says haughtily. “On Midgard, I have been known as Frige. You have not heard of me?”
“Yeah. Come on, Tin Man; let’s go try to wake Sleeping Beauty.”
“I got the impression that’s not what NIA thinks happened,” Rhodey corrects him. “Apparently, his equipment is mysteriously missing. I’ll let you know if I get anything else, but right now we have a positive ID on the body.”
Okay.
Steve laughs. “Alright, alright. I’ll leave it where it is,” he concedes. “I’m just saying, Tony’s a flawed man. He’s not always easy to take care of, but you stay with him because you think it’s where you belong. If that’s not love, I don’t know what is.”
“Awesome! One enormous architectural Frankenstein coming up,” Tony says, clapping his hands together. “Think you can source a team of minions for me?”
“I-” Rogers says, then stops himself. “Right. I’ll just…I’ll be outside.”
“Oh, did you make a new friend?” Tony asks, delighted.
“Have you had that much?”
“Sleep,” he slurs. And then, because he feels it needs to be said, “Thank you.”
“You heard our conversation, in the kitchen,” Peter says, because that’s the kind of man he is. Steve can’t help the fond smile that spills over his face.
He walked over to the fridge, pulling it open. “Bacon? Toast?”
“Yeah,” Tony says, dazed. “Yeah, you do that.”
“Don’t call me that, Rogers,” Tony says, pointing a finger at him. “I can’t- this can’t be happening.” He sucks in a shuddering breath, visibly trying to patch his manufactured panache back together even as it flakes off of him with each word, with each ever-strengthening beat of Steve’s heart as he steps a little closer towards Tony.
Tony scraped his teeth over Steve, and it was enough to spur a genuine scream from his mouth, his hands fisting behind Tony’s head to keep from hurting him.
“So he’s getting better at being a ghost!”
“No, you won’t,” he says.
Steve can literally feel his heart breaking. His chest is wracked with horrible, aching pain as he searches Tony’s face.
“Hudson Yards,” he says, making a face. “Inside a trashed Patek Philippe.”
Something hits him from behind, hard enough to force him to his knees. He rolls over in time to dodge a second bolt of pale green light, firing back only to hit a very familiar energy shield. Amora is standing there, eyes wild and red, hair waving of its own accord with the strength of the power humming from her hands. Tony can feel it in his chest, like a strong bass beat, and he fires a few missiles at her to distract while he pulls himself up again. He keeps firing as he powers his way to the green light in the centre of the parking garage, dodging around thick pillars and using them as cover as Amora rallies.
“Rude!’ Tony crowed, but he melted satisfyingly into Steve’s embrace when Steve took one of the tendons of his neck between his teeth and pressed down, softly. “Oh.”
Steve sucks in a breath. His nose stings. He tilts Tony up to face him, and the look in his eyes is so fierce and lovely and lost that he barely even notices the way his own chest shudders. The way his own mouth is trembling.
“Have you eaten?” Clint asked, and Steve shook his head mutely. Clint wasn’t wearing his hearing aids, and Steve wasn’t feeling particularly chatty. “Well. There’s some Thai in the fridge. Knock yourself out. I’d offer to cook, but I’m more likely to set fire to the kitchen right now, so. Come in whenever you’re ready.”
Steve glanced up through his eyelashes, smiling when he was rewarded with the sight of Tony’s beautiful eyes half-lidded and desperate, so dark with desire they looked black all around, both pupil and retina. “You’re mine,” he growled playfully, but both he and Tony knew he wasn’t really kidding. Then he dipped his head, and swallowed Tony down.
Natasha considered him, then rose, slowly. She approached him as though she’d approach a wild animal, and Steve still flinched when she put a hand on his arm. Here was an unbonded alpha, touching him while he was in the throes of bond-sickness. If she wasn’t so firmly entwined in his pack, he might have lashed out, but instead he just jerked underneath her hand. She pulled back with an apologetic expression.
Steve is used to most of his teammates solving much of their problems with copious amounts of alcohol. On a bad day, he envies it of them, remembers a room that was more rubble than building, a hollowed-out shell of a place reflecting the aching, empty places inside of him where a brother used to be. Still, he can’t begrudge them for it. He knows that, in many ways, he’s had a charmed life compared to some of this new, strange family he’s made. He had a mother that loved him. He wasn’t introduced to the more horrific parts of humanity until later in his life, the cruelty of fellow children aside. He had a childhood, for the most part. It was enough.
“I think you know a lot,” Steve says, knowing they’re stepping into dangerous territory now. Or rather, maybe they have been, all along. “You stay with us because you love him. Us, too, I like to think. But mostly him.”
He puts himself through a rinse once he’s sure he’s rid himself of blood, running his hands over his skin to check for any remaining tackiness. Then he realises he’s stalling, trying to avoid getting out of the shower with Loki still sitting on the counter.
“Hah!” Tony says, gesturing at Bruce with an apple slice.
“Put- on my chest, I want-”
“You didn’t trust me,” Steve says, and Tony winces.
"Yeah."
He disappears before Steve can dredge up a response to that. Tony has the decency to look sheepish, and Steve rubs at the back of his neck in the ensuing silence. Tony stands up, draining his glass and putting it in the dishwasher.
“I’m an omega,” Steve said hotly, and Tony offered him a leer.
Tony stretches his wrist a little closer to Steve. “If you like,” he repeats, and Steve
I think that's it. Stay safe everybody.
“Fuck,” Tony rasps, fingers clenching in the crinkled plastic sash, and his grainy face looks caught halfway between awe and desire. The corner of his mouth curls, just the barest twitch.
“I wouldn’t try to keep you out with a retina scanner,” Maria scoffs. “But I
Tony slides his hand down and cups Steve’s sac, pulling gently at the soft skin. Then he slides his hand down deeper, fingers pressing into Steve’s stretched out rim. The sound that Steve makes is obscene. It makes all the hair on Tony’s arms stand on end, a shiver of arousal running over his body. He pistons his hectocotylus harder and faster. He’s getting there. He can feel it, different than any other orgasm his body has ever experienced. It feels…he doesn’t know how to describe how it feels.
“I could have saved them,” he says. “Cap forbade me from going in. Like I was a fucking child. It was selfish. I could have taken the building collapsing on me in the armour, if that was what he was worried about.”
Steve considers this. He holds it up to the proverbial light, turning it, weighing the pros and cons. “Tony won’t much like being forced into something like that,” he murmurs, considering. “But it might be good for him, actually. To know that’s what the team wants, and to hear why. I’d get to be in the field, watch his back, provide support without being in charge. And for all that we fight, Tony will listen to me on tactical decisions. He might not agree, but he’ll listen. We tend to do a lot of that together, anyway.” He chances a glance at Xavier’s inscrutable face. “You’re a dangerous man, Professor.”
“Je suis allergique aux fraises,” Pepper confesses, clearly a punchline, and Loki chuckles, his eyes flickering to Tony. Pepper turns in her seat in reaction, and Tony raises his eyebrows at them, heading across the room and past them towards the kitchen.
“No,” Tony gasps, waving a hand. “No, Fri, don’t.” He hitches another sob. “Don’t…I just. I need to sleep.”
An arc of lightning snakes out from Amora’s twitching left hand, lancing into Hawkeye’s side and sending him to one knee. Tony repulsors her in the face twice, then a third time, pushing her body back a good ten feet. She’s still convulsing, probably more automatic reflex than a real attack, but when he turns back Widow is running into the room, one hand on her comm as she barks a status update to the rest of the team. An Iron Legionnaire follows behind her. She’s leaning over Hawkeye in an instant, and Tony trusts her to take care of things there as he limps towards Strucker’s tech. Cap is hooked up to a dozen different machines, and he braces his hands on the edge of the cot and does another scan.
Steve considered that, doing a mental inventory. The muscle pain he’d felt from the bond sickness had completely dissipated, replaced by the delicious ache of a few days’ worth of lovemaking. He felt sore in the best possible way, and he closed his eyes and took a deep breath, savouring the smell of his and Tony’s bonded pheromones surrounding him.
“We’re soulmates,” he says, wonderingly.
He places a hand over the light of the arc reactor, looks down at the blue gleaming from between his calloused fingers. Tony’s heart has always been weak, in every sense of the word. Soon, the Bond Sickness weaken it further, or the Bond will wither and die. He’s been here before, hasn’t he? He survived long enough to stop an alien invasion and save all of the New York Metropolitan Area from a nuke. Roughly 12 million deaths, give or take. The whole world, if the Avengers lost the battle without his help. He’s revolutionised clean energy, medical technology. He’s on the verge of a breakthrough in material science. Nanotech. True, adaptive, fully-functional nanotech. In a few years, probably, he can make it work.
“Wait, Thor, it wasn’t-”
Pepper didn’t see it that way.
“Or, perhaps not?” Professor Xavier asks, amused. He blows gently on his tea, raising an eyebrow at him. “How are you feeling?”
“Oh my god,” Tony says, laughing despite himself. “We are not doing this right now.”
“I mean literally.” Tony says. He scowls at whatever he’s working on, pulling up another holoscreen and examining a long string of data that Steve couldn’t make heads or tails of even if pressed to at gunpoint. Naturally, Reed reaches over and points to a variable, and Tony lets out a delighted noise. He closes the data stream and opens his project back up, moving a few pieces around. “He’s a ghost, and he spends all his time following me around and touching me and telling me things in old-timey American Morse code.”
"Captain Rogers is not getting a birthday present," she says, twisting her lips into something angry. "The nerve of him."
Tony shakes his head, lips pressed into a thin line. Syrup trips over his fingers and down his wrist, and he lets out a small curse. His tongue catches the drip, following it up over his fingers. He pushes the last of the waffle into his mouth, sucking his fingers clean, and Steve’s mouth is so, so dry.
Tony grins as a path lights up for him, directing him through the maze of hallways and towards silver elevator doors where an empty elevator awaits him. He takes down two guards as he goes, the rest having fled to deal with the sudden Avengers incursion. The doors open with a ping, and Tony steps inside with a clank and a worrying creak from the interior. He checks the max weight, then winces.
Thor spears him with a sideways glare, and Tony shuts up. “Part of me hopes for deception, because it would mean that I have not been repudiated. Yet the other wishes only peace and happiness upon him. I certainly would not wish you harm.”
“You didn’t, Steve-”
“You know, nobody gives me any credit,” Tony says musingly, tilting his head to the side. “Am I not the genius in this equation? Or am I just so hard to deal with that expectations are really that low?”
“And what gift is that?” Steve asked, leaning in to add a bit of backlight from the shine of the reactor to the bottom of Tony’s chin.
“Yes, father.”
“Dick,” Spidey grumbles, not quietly enough in Steve’s opinion. Still, despite his manners, despite his professional respect for Strange, he can’t help but feel a little bit like he agrees.
Steve nods, shifting awkwardly on his feet as she scampers away, half-running, half-walking. Her pointed ears twitch slightly as she moves, and Steve watches her go with a strange feeling in his chest. He can’t imagine what she must have gone through before coming here, but she looks happy enough.
“Plenty of time to work on refining our anti-magic project, huh?”
Loki does not answer him, and Tony sighs and rubs a hand through his hair, face screwing up a bit as he remembers the gel too late. He stares at his fingers with a frown, then gets up to wipe his hand on a bar towel and fetch himself a drink. He has a feeling he’s going to need it for this conversation.
Loki sneers at him. “Do you wish to test your boast and lose?”
The Black Widow steps out of the elevator, already suited up and ready for combat. Tony takes a moment to admire the competence projected with every step, the predatory grace that accompanies her in this form. He gestures to the oyster tray, which she ignores. Typical. He eats the last one himself.
“I understand,” Steve says. He may not like it, but he gets it. “I think I should maybe talk to him, too.”
They go to Yasuda. Tony hasn't been since the eponymous master chef returned to Tokyo, but apparently Pepper wants to see what Tamura has done with the place. Tony wouldn't want sushi after a week in Japan, but he's never pretended to understand Pepper's tastes. Tony just likes good food.
“Remember to drink some water before you go to bed, okay?”
“Loki, baby, deep breaths,” Tony says, holding his hands out in placation. “Stay with me, okay?”
“That was definitely censored,” Steve said, rubbing a hand over his face. He put one foot in front of the other.
“You’ve been waterboarded!” Steve snarled, feeling his pulse rise, and it was the serum, he knew it was. It was the serum making him protective, angry, alpha. “You’ve been through open heart surgery in a dusty cave with no anaesthetics! That is not comforting to me!”
“We do our best,” Widow says, folding her hands behind her back. “Dinner Thursday?”
“Thank you, sir,” JARVIS says warmly. Tony clears his throat, reaching for the towel. “You should leave in twenty minutes to get to your meeting on time.”
With a gentle nudge from his human brain, Tony’s tentacles coil around Steve’s thighs and calves, spreading him apart with gentle, unyielding force. They’re strong, his tentacles: thick bands of muscle and nothing else, sinuous and clinging. Steve lets out a quiet sob into Tony’s mouth, jaw slack as he licks inside, and Tony sucks on his tongue as he manoeuvres to get both of Steve’s nipples attached to suckers, one curling around Steve’s cock in a tight grip to prevent him from coming.
He’s caught between letting Tony drag him around behind him, dizzy and in pain, or shifting himself over to stay with his body, but he decides that there isn’t anything he can do to stop him. And he’s been meaning to try climbing back into his body, to see if he can affect it in some way.
“Soon,” Tony murmurs, as though he can hear him. He nudges Steve’s legs open, wheels his chair between them. He presses his cheek to Steve’s chest and wraps his arms around his waist.
a single mother,” he allows, and Pepper sniffs. “Honey, you know I have to.”
Tony didn’t reply immediately, and Steve paused with his fingers around the creme fraiche, turning to glance over his shoulder. He was staring at Steve with a furrowed brow, mouth twisted in a confused sort of smile.
Y O U F O R G I V E Y O U
“I’m sure.” He turns back to Steve, who is glancing between them with an expression of abject horror and embarrassment on his face. Tony spares Loki a speaking look. “Uh. I think Rhodey can handle the return trip. Why don’t you get some rest?”
“Just a little further,” he tells it. He taps his fingernails against the crystal pane, that familiar clicking. “Give me just a little longer.”
“Do you really think I would die so easily? Did you not learn your lesson?” Loki’s voice is scathing, and Tony reaches back to jab him in the ribs with an elbow.
A shared drink at Casino had led to a hand of poker at the jailhouse, and then a friendly bout of wrestling on the ground of the jailhouse back office as a laughing Rogers accused Tony of hooking his chits. He’d demanded to check up Tony’s sleeves, and Tony had fought him, and then Rogers had been straddling him, bright and handsome in the lamplight, and Tony had been hard beneath the tempting V of Rogers’ legs.
Tony settles into one of the two remaining chairs out on the deck with two fingers of Glenmorangie and watches him work. It’s a strange reversal of their usual roles. Steve’s aware of him, Tony’s sure. He always seems to be hyperaware of Tony, no matter where he is or what he’s doing. But he seems content enough to keep painting, and so Tony leans back and slips his eyes closed. He lets the warm summer breeze wash over him and listens to the sounds of New York, alive and still ticking along.
Tony would react to that, if he wasn’t completely paralysed by the pain that bursts open in his chest like a blooming flower. Tony has left his body. Tony isn’t even here.
“Rhodey,” Tony begins, sighing, but Rhodey cuts him off with a hand. He turns his body turning to face Tony, loose and rolling with disbelief.
“He’s the man you loved,” Tony finishes. Natasha doesn’t answer him, but she doesn’t need to. They’ve always been good at this part. They understand each other. “What are you going to do?”
“No, I didn’t think so.” He makes his way into the room in that strange way of his, almost more like a snake than a man. When he reaches Tony’s side he pauses, always awkward with human emotion, before pulling a chair over and sitting catty corner to him. “What can I do?”
“Luke…”
“Tony,” Steve says again, and then he’s pulling on Tony’s flies, unlacing Tony’s shoes and tossing them in the corner, followed by his boxers and slacks. “
“What am I missing?” Tony demands, rubbing a hand over his face. “I’m missing something big, Rhodey. What the hell am I missing?”
When death came, you said, "I'll go there."
“No,” he admits, “but think about it. She had knives, and she didn’t use them.”
“What do you need?” Tony asks him. He sucks Steve’s earlobe into his mouth, teeth grazing the soft skin. “What do you need, baby?”
Steve yawns, running a self-conscious hand through his hair as his fist comes up to cover his mouth.
Maria frowns. She crosses her arms over her chest. “You know, once upon a time, your business was my business.”
“Was she Catholic?”
Sam fixes him with a reproving glare. “And you drove all the way out here? Get your ass home and sort out your life, Jesus.”
In that way, Loki was an easy choice. There was no worry about living up to anything Loki had done or was. Loki had been beautiful and willing. Dangerous and complicated, to be sure, but that had never stopped Tony from doing anything. He genuinely doesn’t remember a time when he didn’t know how to disassemble a firearm. Servicing a beautiful weapon had always been where a Stark was most at home. There is nothing else he loves more than breaking something open and putting it back together again better than before.
“A repeat, huh?” Happy asks, and Tony tips his head back and closes his eyes. He remembers Lacey’s perfect French manicure gently resting against the arc reactor, soft brown eyes gleaming up at him from beneath thick eyelashes.
Tony pulls a very specific tentacle out of the water and curls it in front of Steve’s face. “This,” he says, twisting it so that Steve can see it from all sides, “is called the hectocotylus.”
“Permanent damage is how I would conceptualise harm,” Loki says flatly. His black eyes are flat, and Steve, with a sudden, strange bout of clarity, reads hurt there. He’s hurt, that Tony is questioning him like this. Gutted, in fact, for it to be so obvious to Steve.
Tony opened his mouth to ask how in the hell he’d managed that, then closed it again. He wasn’t sure he wanted to know.
Eventually, he turns around and heads to the workshop. The wet sciences have never been his forte, but cold metal he understands.
wants that to be true.
Loki says nothing, but emanates a clear air of displeasure. His shoulders are tight, body perfectly poised. Tony takes another sip and comes around the bar, stopping just short of touching range. He searches Loki's face, pulling his lip between his teeth.
He thinks about who he might have talked to about this when he was younger. Not his mother, certainly. But maybe…
"Pepper!" Tony says, scandalised. Pepper smirks at him.
“I’m sorry,” the professor says a rueful smile breaking across his face. “That was rude of me.”
“Yeah,” he managed, chest so tight it was a wonder he could get the word out at all. “Yeah. Two humans of the same nature can’t bond. But they can get married, the way betas do, now. That was only legalised recently. In some rare cases, beta-omega pairs can bond, too. But there’s only a small handful of documented cases where an alpha was able to bond with a beta. It’s almost unheard of. I’ve heard it hurts like hell, too, but that might just be the propaganda.”
“I will leave you just outside of the city, off the coast to the south,” Loki says, gesturing to a series of markings in a large circle around the landing pad. “The doorway will be high above the sea: to allow space between for you to gather your bearings, or should your craft react unfavourably to my magic.”
"Most of us have done terrible things," Nat says mildly. She's looking at Steve, and Tony knows he's thinking of a certain soldier buddy of theirs. Steve stares back at her for a long moment before he exhales, nodding. He trains that infamous piercing gaze on Tony.
Steve licks the dryness from his lips, fiddling with the spoon from his earlier meal. It’s still in his hands, for some reason, but he appreciates the presence of the metal between his fingers now. It’s skin-warm and well weighted for fiddling. “You want me to see a telepath to check for any mines Amora might have left behind?”
Steve closed his eyes, resting his face in his hand. His palm covered his eyes to block out the light. Everything was just so much, and he was so tired, all the time. Everything had become a chore: waking, eating, sleeping without Tony in their bed. The scent of him was both torture and balm, necessary and abhorrent. Everything made Steve want to scream.
“You something her, that’s for sure,” Tony mutters, which startles a laugh out of Bruce. It’s a calculated risk, but that’s all Tony is these days. “I’m being as careful as I can.”
“Stark killed Loki,” the woman says, dragging a hand over his chest. Everywhere she touches burns like a brand. “So I will make sure that when he comes for you, there will be nothing of you left to find.”
“Daddy’s home,” he calls. “J, what’s the damage?”
"We do love you," he calls over his shoulder, because sometimes Steve Rogers is a coward. "I just wish you wouldn't make it so hard."
"We both know I am, who am I kidding?" He puts the car in drive and pulls away from the jet, heading towards the road. He carefully doesn't look at her. "Loki wants to come in, and he's picked me as negotiator. He keeps popping up, but he's playing nice, so I thought you should know in case, you know. He pops up. Don't shoot him unless he gives you a reason, etcetera."
“I can tell that you’re embarrassed, about, y’know.” He gestures to the light show that is currently Tony’s lower half.
There’s a low curse from the centre of the room, and Steve gives in to the urge he’s been fighting for three hours and glances up to look at his soulmate.
Tony shakes his head. “I know you have,” he begins, but Steve taps again.
Steve quirks a smile. He pulls away from Tony’s embrace. “You’re something else. I never could’ve imagined I’d have a soulmate, let alone one like you,” he chuckles, and it hits Tony sure as a blade to the chest. It cracks him open. A lump forms in his throat.
“Fuck,” Steve whispered, watching as the girl and Tony were both shoved into one of the vans. Two of the students were sobbing, one blond boy clearly hyperventilating with his hands over his mouth, staring down at Tony’s belongings scattered all over the pavement. A quick-thinking Desi student took a photo of the two SUVs, and JARVIS helpfully pulled the photo up, the licence plates enhanced to show the numbers.
“You’re avoiding me.”
Tony watches Steve, expressionless, watches him crumple.
Steve lets out a wet breath against Tony’s neck. Tony can feel the flutter of his eyelashes against his skin as he blinks.
that!” Tony says, throwing his hands up.
“I can’t,” Tony gasps, but Carol only clutches him tighter. “I can’t, Carol. I can’t.”
“As usual, Thor understands nothing.”
“Hey Capsicle,” Riri said, voice lilting over the nickname in such a familiar and dear way that Steve wanted to cry. As it was, he froze in the middle of one fluorescent-flickering hallway, his hands clenching at his sides. “Tony says, get your stubborn butt home and, uh. Keep the bed warm for him.” The girl’s voice was awkward for the first time, and Steve couldn’t help but laugh about it. “He says you need to sit down before you fall down, and that you look like crap.”
“Ms. Potts is fine,” Pepper says, not buying Loki’s act for a second but a little charmed all the same. Tony grins at her, and enjoys the resulting flush.
Steve frowned. “Oh.”
Tony was staring at him as though he’d lost his damn mind, mouth hanging open loosely in shock. The rest of the Avengers didn’t look much better, except for Thor, who looked almost proud for a reason Steve didn’t want to examine. Steve felt embarrassment settle over his shoulders like an old friend, a familiar and well-worn coat. He rubbed a hand over the back of his head, stepping backwards once, twice, three times until he was out of Tony’s view.
Steve blushes, but he’s grinning, too. “You like it when I take initiative in this area,” he says, like he’s providing a piece of intel for a mission.
“Not every enhanced is a WMD,” Tony pipes in tiredly. They’ve been going in circles for an hour, and he’s sick of it. He’s so fucking sick of it. “And I’ve got no powers, remember? I was the first super out of the gate, unless you’re counting Captain America, and there is absolutely nothing enhanced about my DNA. And before you can ask, I’ve had the tests.” He slides a StarkPad down the table with his results for good measure. “And speaking of the Olympics, Michael Phelps has increased lung capacity and huge flipper feet, and he’s not an enhanced. Do we take away his medals because he’s got better chest and foot measurements than everybody else? Come on, ladies and gentlemen, we all know registration is off the table for now. So what are we really looking at, here?”
Tony opens the cabinet and pulls out his deodorant.
Steve’s face smooths out. “Ah…not enough, probably.”
“Are you sure?” Thor asked, and Steve paused and glanced up at him. There was an uncanny shine in his eyes, some kind of shared grief that Steve could barely dare to look at. “We could take some wine onto the balcony, look at the mountains. It is a fine night.”
“For what it’s worth, I really am sorry for the whole…fake murder thing.” Tony offers him a sheepish wince. “Look, I think you’re just…immature, comparatively.” Thor raises an eyebrow at him. “I know, I know, you’re two thousand years old or whatever. But, I mean, how old are your parents? It’s not really fair to compare your wisdom or whatever to theirs. And sometimes you’re wise. In ways that surprise me, and…well, I’d say humble me, if I wasn’t me.”
There, at the very end of the worktop, is a bowl of steaming stew. Steve is nowhere to be found, and Tony wheels over to the bowl. There’s a piece of paper pinned under it, and he tugs it out, tilting it into the light.
Tony turns around, the coffee maker rumbling pleasantly. Then he leans over the counter and pokes Loki in the nose, his hand passing right through him. "Huh." Definitely not awake enough.
Tony sighs. He’s still been reticent to tell people about Steve, even now when he has evidence and witnesses to back his claim. With a few gestures, he brings up more files: crime scene photos, ME reports, DNA testing. “These were a warm-up,” he deflects. “To get noticed. Appetisers.”
Tony lets out a slow breath. He closes his eyes, breathes in once, then out. “Why are you telling me this, now?”
"He was in the tower?" Steve says, looking horrified. "Tony, you could have been killed!"
“She does not seem to take me at my word.”
“She got shot!”
Tony smiled, leaning himself ever so slightly into Rogers’ hands. To the average passer-by, nothing was amiss: just another night where the sheriff had to haul the town drunk down the street. The pinkening tips of Rogers’ ears betrayed him.
“Well, if he cared he should have Claimed me, then,” Tony mutters.
Steve closes his eyes. A single tear leaks out, trailing down his face. Tony has the strangest desire to take a photo. He’s going to remember this moment for the rest of his short life. He wonders if it’s going to hurt this much every time.
“Thank you for telling me,” he says formally. “I’ll…uh, I should get to bed.”
Anyway, I looked kind of desperately for that really cute page of Tony and Reed singing along to the radio and driving together but I couldn't find it, so if someone wants to hit me in the comments w/ a link that would be great. The true comics #ScienceBros (for those of us who like to forget about Hank Pym on account of him being an abusive husband in Ults and a crappy one in 616 lol.) [/rant]
Bruce looks at him for a long time. A small smile quirks at his mouth. “What would you have me do?”
“You are grand, Tony! You are everything you say you are, and so any scrap of attention is everything. You speak, and people really listen to you. They’re not just pretending because you’re famous, I mean they really listen. Do you have any idea how rare that is? Haven’t you ever wondered about that unshakeable loyalty you inspire, in everyone from old flames to paid employees? That’s not normal, Tony, that’s you.”
Steve’s head snapped up, shock filtering over him in a nasty prickle. “What?”
“We’ve done this every year, Shellhead,” Steve reminded him. “Natasha even did it, two years ago, remember?”
“You could tell him, y’know. That this isn’t your home.”
“I was-”
“Is Tony around?”
“Why would she do that?” Steve asks, voice flat, but his eyes are narrow. Assessing.
“Morning Cap,” Clint called, not even turning around on the couch. On the television, four anthropomorphic turtles talked to a giant rat.
Even forever didn’t feel like it could be long enough.
Tony flinches bodily. He can’t stop himself from doing it, because the words hurt. So, yeah, maybe he is actually kind of pissed at Steve.
“You know I’m going to figure this out.”
“Yeah,” Tony says, quietly.
And then she’s gone: a clack of heels, the elevator dinging. They are once again alone.
“– regardless, you liked it right? You liked it when he…called you Big Papa?” Her previous stoic face was quickly crumbling at what Steve assumed was her own joke. He was starting to feel insecure.
“Aw, come on, this is my part of the punishment, she’s gotta hear how–”
“I’m not your guy, buddy.”
“I’ve been wanting…a mother to talk to. It’s why I reached out to Carolyn, constantly try to hang out with May – who is my little brother’s mother and doesn’t owe me anything. I have two amazing dads but I’m a selfish jerk for wanting more…” she practically choked on the tears free falling down her face.
He reminded himself he still needed to shower and hoped skipping the run was a good idea before dealing with an undoubtedly stressful situation his kids had gotten into.
And she thought Thor was huge.
"Morning baby!" the father laughed along with his youngest, interrupted by his middle child.
with Vivienne.
“Not really. I have little snippets of my Aunt and Uncle, who I was with before these two clowns,” Peter said shooting a smirk at his dads. “They died in a car accident. Similar to how my birth parents died, except my aunt and uncle didn’t get hit by a drunk driver, they lost control in the rain. My birth father was actually Dad’s cousin.”
Their fourth date was a mutual agreement to see a movie. Steve still wanted to be careful and avoid any pictures being taken – reassuring Tony it was an ‘out thing’ rather than a ‘Tony thing.’ And they seemed to get away with it, Tony driving them back to his mansion as the two continued looking around for lurking cameras. Steve of course spent the night, loving the way he gets to wake up with Tony as the little spoon in his arms.
For the first time in her life, she finally got what
Steve promised to stay out of it after confronting Clint one morning. But Bucky didn’t recoil or shy away from Clint’s… ‘Clint-ness’... and overall he did think they would make a cute couple...
“No you won’t,” Steve countered with a fake glare, small smile breaking across his handsome face as he walked over and kissed Tony on his cheek. “But I still like you.”
“She was?” Daci asked, voice small and still sounding unsure. He nodded back at her as he tucked some hair behind her ear. “Have you seen her? I think she was there at the base.”
He had seen it coming, since it was a trick his Pappy had taught him years ago - distract before attacking when their guard is down - and mimicked his brother with a dramatic groan. Pappy, playing the referee, began counting to ten as Steve slowly got back up before he was vertical again.
Stephen floats up to the top of one towering bookshelf, replacing the tomes he’d taken out to research Tony’s condition one by one. It’s getting late now, the sun spilling rich golds through the huge glass windows. Stephen’s cloak gleams blood red in the light.
“Steve,” Tony panted, scrabbling weakly at his shoulder, and Steve pulled off with an obscene, wet sound that made him shiver, his cock twitching in his hand. “Fuck, come here.”
“Bye bye!”
Tony smirks at the small tic.
Eventually, he stepped out of the shower and dried off as quickly as possible, pulling on some sweatpants and a t-shirt. He needed to get out of the penthouse. He couldn’t handle being there without Tony, not when he’d been so close.
“Am I that transparent?” he asked.
I did not think this series would get so out of hand. I also did not finish even a single line of BINGO. Sometimes these things happen. Still working on my WIPs, if you’re waiting, so sorry about that. Just trying to muddle through this shite winter. Hope you’re enjoying the angst I guess?
“Hey, no, I just had no idea if Amora would know if I said anything. I figured if I could trust your brother with anything, it was his own life.”
“Thank you for trusting me,” Natasha said, and Tony turned to look at her with a raised eyebrow. “I know you’re both feeling somewhat vulnerable right now. It means a lot, that you asked me up.”
Steve shook his head, hands clenching at his sides. That little speech had taken all the bravery he had, and now he just felt small and stupid and wrong. Omegas weren’t supposed to be the ones to propose a bonding, or push for one, or ask someone to marry them for god’s sake. He was fucking everything up, as always.
Xavier smiles kindly. “I think every so-called superhero should probably be in therapy, yes.” He holds up a hand to forestall Steve’s protests. “Captain, I suspect this is a cultural barrier. Therapy is not indicative of any failing. Think of it as mental housekeeping. It’s good to tidy up every so often, isn’t it?”
“Eh,” Tony says, rocking a hand back and forth. “I mean, like all teens, I got radicalised in college. So now I’m a True Believer™. Got the shirt and everything.” Steve blushes then, bright and showy. “What?”
“I am your last defence against Loki, if you are compromised,” she tells him. She turns her head to meet the cool blue gaze of the armour’s mask. “Loki acknowledges that I am dangerous. Admittedly, I was very surprised. I thought things were going quite well.”
He lets himself take comfort in Pepper’s embrace for the space of another score of heartbeats, letting the familiar scent of her perfume wash over him, the feeling of her long ponytail as it slides through his absentminded, fiddling fingers. Eventually, he pulls away, brushing a stray single hair off of her blazer.
Tony stiffens at the feeling of a hand between his shoulder blades, a tingling calm spreading out from it in a slow creep that makes his hair stand on end. He lashes out, batting Loki’s hand away and shoving at him until his wrists are caught, held fast within inhuman strength.
“Can we go now?” Peter asked, wiping his mouth after finishing his second crepe.
Joey smiled and reached out to grab his arm to stop him. He turned back to her with a confused expression.
Emerson waited a beat, took a breath and made her way to one of the stools, sitting next to Tony.
The choked sound that breaks out of his mouth is inhuman. It does not echo in the space, instead landing flat and quiet against Steve’s folded fingers like a dead thing.
Tony was building speed now, skimming over the top of the wave and riding the edge before dipping down again, back and forth like the shuttle on a loom. He looked pretty impressive, honestly, and Steve grinned at the knowledge that Tony was most definitely trying to show off for him. Eventually, Tony turned and rode the wave back towards Steve, and Steve laughed and kicked his feet gently in the water where he was straddling his board, leaning over to paddle towards him and meet him in the middle.
Steve glances over at him, and the smile wins the battle. His eyes crinkle at the corners. “Yeah?”
Tony bit down on his bondmark again, and Steve let out a skirling cry, arching into the pleasure. It caused Tony’s knot to catch at his rim, and he could feel himself getting wetter as Tony came in a rush, warm heat seeping into his abdomen. His knot swelled even further, and Steve whined and rocked on it, letting it press into his sweet spot, feeling Tony inside him so hot and full and close.
“Steve,” Tony says, because he doesn’t know what else to say.
"Was I?"
Steve looks down at the matte printed photograph that’s sitting on his desk. He presses one shaking fingertip to the gentle slope of muscle that marks the inside of Tony’s sun-darkened thigh.
“After three weeks of not knowing if your mate was alive and healthy, you’re lucky you’re even standing,” Clint continued, stubborn. “The only thing that’s keeping you up is the serum and stubbornness.”
Bruce had been a hard-line advocate for the cells, but then again, Bruce didn’t trust himself. Together, they’d worked on a cell for Hulk, dug deep into the lowest sub-basement that Tony could get cleared by the city zoning commission. He told them it was built to house a laboratory that would be dealing with energy testing, with a small potential for high-payload explosions. With the arc reactor being what it was, it was easy for people to believe that Tony needed a space that could hold in a small nuclear-level blast. Tony had pioneered hard light forcefields for the Hulk’s cell, with their structure heavily based on vibranium. The knockoff was what he’d given to SHIELD, which had ultimately ended up being used for the Pleasant Hill project.
Wordlessly, Steve turns around, his phone held up in his hand. A grin breaks over Tony’s face.
“Yup, sleep, you’re totally right,” he says nodding, and Beth rolls her eyes at him.
“JARVIS,” he said, and his voice sounded as though it was coming from very far away, “where’s Tony?”
Tony shakes himself, his hair flinging water across the wet tiles. “Sorry,” he chuckles. “I haven’t. Uh.”
Tony hums, the faint hint of a smug smile playing over his lips. “I inspire indulgence, hmm?”
Tony laughs at him. “Right here?” he asks, voice dropping, and Steve takes a shaky breath.
“Tony,
Steve shakes his head, mute with gratitude and relief. He feels, embarrassingly, like he might cry.
“And you’re gonna rectify that, being the good town sheriff and all,” Tony observed sagely. “Can’t have a booze hound ruining this sacred day!”
“Can’t lose you in here,” Tony said, and he could feel Rogers smile against his skin.
Chapter title is from Neruda's
Steve falls to his knees on the bed between Tony’s thighs, his hands hovering over Tony’s trembling legs.
“Thank you, Cap,” Tony says, nestling closer. It’s the last thing he hears before he’s out.
“Uh.”
Loki crawls over him, then leans in for an absolutely filthy kiss. Tony presses up into it, then rolls them, pinning Loki on his back and straddling his waist. He grinds their hips together, grinning at Loki’s moan. He grips Tony’s hips tightly, and Tony leans over to grab the requisite items from the nightstand.
Tony let out a rough sigh, a small smile lifting his lips at Steve’s words. “Then how come…?”
“Widow, be advised we have unknown enhanced in the field, I repeat, unknown enhanced. Shots fired. Iron Man’s suit has already sustained damage from a single shot, requesting backup. Do you copy?”
“The heat room is fully stocked, and I shall enact the usual protocols as soon as it is necessary.”
“Because I’m not!” Steve bursts out, but of course, no one can hear him.
Bruce’s expression darkens. Tony inhales, takes a bite of toast, chews forcefully as he waits for Bruce to look less terrifying. When this doesn’t happen, he swallows with an audible click. Bruce mutters something in Punjabi. Tony eats his toast. Then he licks his fingers, for good measure.
“Don’t even start with that. Every super from here to K'un-Lun would slap you for even suggesting it. You’re not the only one who cares about Steve.” Beth frowns, then: the first sign of weakness Steve’s seen on her face since she burst in.
“Come on, you can do it,” Tony says encouragingly. Then he shifts, his body turning lissom, insouciant. “Or do I have to get naked again?”
“Well then,” Steve tells him. He tips Tony’s face up so that their eyes lock. “Feeling’s mutual, hm?” He kisses Tony, chaste and warm. “Just talk to me, okay?”
“Do you know how many people he’s killed?” Rhodey says, waving an impassioned hand, and Tony rolls his eyes at him.
“Did you bring it?” Tony asks, choosing another at random, and Pepper sighs. She pulls a little black box out of her purse and passes it to him, and Tony takes a moment to be grateful that she knew to conceal it from his vision in some small way. He restrains the surge of fear and nausea, pushes it down, puts the box at the far edge of the table.
Pepper narrows her eyes at him. “You know what I mean.”
“There are many ways that one might die without intent in Loki’s schemes,” Thor agrees, nodding seriously. Tony rolls his eyes heavenward. “You are not the first to be tricked by my brother’s sharp tongue, and you shall not be the last.”
“What?”
“They’re worried.” Steve took a long drink of water, closing his eyes.
“So you know I don’t want to see you, and you’re ignoring my wishes,” Tony says, mostly because he knows it’ll hurt Steve. And he kind of wants to hurt him. This whole situation has been a bad hand all around, and he hates it, and he wants to spread his misery. He’s never claimed to be anything but petty. “Also, fuck you so much for using the predictability of my AA meetings against me. That’s a low fucking blow for anyone, let alone Captain America.”
Bruce grinned ruefully at him. “Sorry.”
Usual warnings: canon-typical violence, arguing, general sad times all around lol. Shit's getting real now.
“Hasegawa’s dead,” Tony says dully, and Steve’s fingers tighten around his scapulae.
“I’m tired, Steve,” Tony says, and Steve exhales like he’s run out of fuel. Just stops, slumps forward. “And I don’t want to be something you fix. I don’t want to be the thing that breaks you, that changes you. You said it, didn’t you? I don’t want you to be less you. You’re perfect. It’s me that’s got you chasing your tail, jumping through hoops, walking on eggshells…that sentence got away from me. Whatever. My point is, aren’t you tired of trying so hard all the time?”
“Tony,” Steve says, helpless, and Tony smiles broadly at him.
Bruce, sounding exasperated and quietly furious. Steve tenses, but knows better than to question his teammate’s control.
“There’s never gonna be a good time, Tony,” Steve says stubbornly. “What we do doesn’t leave time, and I made the mistake of waiting too long once, I can’t-…” He stops, suddenly unable to look at Tony’s face anymore. “Either of us could, at any time, we…”
“Sorry,” Riri said after a few moments, subdued. Steve nodded and kept on going.
“You have your therapy appointment,” Tony reminds him. “I’ll see you around dinnertime.”
“Do you think her actions are in conflict with her words?”
“Mmk,” Tony says, yawning. “Night Reed.”
“Don’t be a jerk, Tony. It’s childish, and cruel. People will look to you for guidance, now that Steve’s gone. You know that.”
“Yeah, just great,” he agrees flatly, picking up his mug. Steve smells the familiar sweetness of jasmine as he moves towards the door. “Don’t destroy too much property on your brunch date when it all goes to hell. It reflects poorly on the rest of us.” His smile is bitter with self-hatred and directed malice, all teeth.
Tony decides,
Steve looked down at his hands. “So when we argued, and I let my anger flood the room, that was…offensive.”
“I, just,” Tony babbles. Think,
Beth sighs. She reaches into the cupboard under the sink, and pulls out some clean clothes: an old blue t-shirt and sweats. She passes Tony the sweats, keeping her body angled away from him in some farce of modesty. But when she unfolds the shirt, she stops. She reminds Steve of nothing so much as a wind-up toy, suddenly out of turns. A look of intense betrayal crosses her face. There is no other way to describe her expression, and Steve moves a little closer, curious. Then he covers his mouth with one hand, because of course. Of course this is the shirt that Tony keeps in the workshop for when he’s too tired to go upstairs and change and face the world. Of course this is the old, comfortable clothing Tony keeps squirreled away down here in this small, private bathroom.
“Steve wanted to go out,” Tony sighs, sounding a little guilty, “and he thought The Lobster sounded kind of weird and fun.”
Tony doesn’t say anything. He rubs his fingers over his mouth, then pulls them away to look at them, as though he expects to find blood. The sound that he makes then is brutal in its heartbreak. Disappointment and grief made manifest. It breaks Steve’s heart in two.
Something hits her in the back, and Amora screams and drops like a rock.
“I figured.” He took another gulp from his mug. “Why are you telling us this?”
Still, he isn’t sure if Tony even wants to see him right now. And it was only four. Nobody ate dinner at four.
Steve takes a breath, then nods. “Call Loki and Clint up here, now.”
The Steve of right now isn’t thinking much of anything. He’s stumbling away from the blinding blue light beaming down onto Bethesda Terrace, sucking Loki and Thor up into a world he can’t even imagine. Steve’s been confronted with a lot of things he can’t imagine lately: powerful beings calling themselves gods, and flying barges, and Tony Stark being so simultaneously different and familiar in ways that twist him up inside. So far Steve’s been clinging to his sanity with all the pain and precariousness of a hangnail, because what else can he do? He feels like if he lets himself stop and think about anything he’ll just unravel bottom to top, like an old sweater caught on a nail.
But instead, what he says is: “I don’t know.” He remembers Tony dying, over and over and over again. He’s not sure he’s ready, yet, to see Tony jump off a building without the suit, or take a missile to the chest. “Tony always acts like the best way to come back from this sort of thing is to jump right into it. If something scares him, he’ll build an army to crush it and then go out and call it to his doorstep.” He doesn’t know if he’s that kind of man.
Steve’s expression sharpens. His nostrils flare. “What are you saying?” he asks, and his voice is rough. He’s angry. Tony is so, so glad they’re doing this over video. The scent of Steve’s fight pheromone would break him, now. It would send him to tears. It would be so easy to bend to his will.
“Cap, it’s great to see you up and moving.”
Steve shook his head at him. “Go on. I’m happy to listen.”
Okay, spoilery cws for this one: light BDSM, bondage, mild pain play, filming during sex
“Fine,” he says. Then he laughs: a short, sharp bark of it. “Go on, then.”
Natasha smiles, that small tilt of the right corner of her mouth. It’s his smile, he knows. He doesn’t quite have it in him to smile back.
Steve rolls back to lie in bed, his StarkPhone dwarfed in his hands as he fiddles with it. He turns to offer Tony a sheepish glance, and Tony looses a weak huff of laughter at the realisation that he’d woken to Steve’s morning alarm. It’s not yet daylight, the slow purpling of pre-dawn the only light visible from the outside. The automated shades haven’t even activated yet.
“Then I’ll listen,” Steve conceded. “But it’ll be for you, not for me.”
“Nope,” he replies, and walks out of the room towards the elevator. “But that’s never stopped me before.”
Sam laughs. “You’ve got a weekly date night set and you still can’t manage to talk to each other or admit your feelings. Unbelievable.” He shakes his head. “If you ask me, Stark’s an asshole. I don’t understand it, but if you want something you’ve gotta work for it. That’s always how it is.”
“This isn’t your fault,” Tony tells him again. Steve isn’t listening.
“Steve,” Tony says warningly, but Steve just tilts his head up to look at Tony. His eyes are sharp, assessing. That familiar, awful stubbornness overtakes him, an expression that Tony has learned to hate as much as he’s wary of it. It’s enough to make the low ache of pain in Tony’s skull flare with warning.
"Are you alright?" Steve asks, a small crease between his brows. Tony's smile widens.
“Shh,” Tony hushes him, pulling away. His mouth is red and wet. Steve wants to devour him. “Save it for when you’re back in your body.”
“You’re…” Steve falters, then offers Tony a wry smile. “You’re lovely like this.”
you think, but you’re probably wrong.” Tony, for all that he’s struggled with depression and alcoholism and God knew what else, wants to live more than anyone else Steve knows. He isn’t sure he knows anyone else with that kind of fortitude.
Tony opens his mouth. Closes it. “I’m hot, I’m a genius, I’m a billionaire. I have everything I could ever want.”
, he knows as well as he knows Buck’s laughing, judgemental face,
If he wanted to be honest with himself, he’d admit that he’s not actually that surprised. This isn’t half as bad as it could have been. He and Cap have been friends for years now, and they respect each other. Cap rarely gives Tony orders anymore, instead couching his directives as questions. Tony responds better to inquiries than imperatives, and Cap is a lauded tactician. He was being
Here we go! Almost there. Formatting this fic is a beotch let me fuckin' tell you kids. Why did I need an epigraph for every fuckin' chapter? Because I am extra, that is why. Smh.
"I don't want to move my stuff!" Steve blurts out.
“That’s bullshit, come on-”
“Yes, it was.”
Mostly, he kissed Tony because he’d wanted to, for months now. Maybe years, he didn’t know. All he knew was that Tony moaned quietly into his mouth, shifting to press Steve back into the island, their bodies flush up against each other. He could feel Tony hard against his hip, a shock of arousal spiking through him at the evidence. He’d kept his eyes above waist level, but he could feel him now, imagined he could feel Tony’s pulse against his hip as he buried his fingers in the soft mess of Tony’s morning hair. Tony’s mouth was warm and gregarious on his, giving as much pleasure as Steve had ever felt from a kiss. Tony’s mouth was soft and warm, and his hands were clever where they skimmed over Steve’s stomach, up the back of his shirt, stroking slowly over the lines of muscle bracketing his spine. The feel of him made Steve whimper, an embarrassing, high noise that Tony swallowed with a low rumble of pleasure. It was enough to make Steve’s head spin.
“No, no,” Tony tells him. He gets it. Steve wants cuddles after a near-death scare. “Come on in. Water’s tepid.”
“And you’ll never know.”
“Now she tells us,” Clint muttered into the coms, presumably off somewhere shooting at things “Classic.”
“So?” Natasha shrugs, eyes as piercing as ever. She pins Tony in place with her stare. “Prove them wrong. Isn’t that your whole shtick?”
“I like you,” Steve huffs, and that’s good. It means he’s relaxed enough to sass Tony. “Anything you do is good. I told you; I don’t need anything fancy.”
Steve’s breath stutters in his chest. Guilt, maybe, and fear. “Right,” he says.
Quit milling around the yard and come inside.
“Yes, sir?”
“Are you a good thing for Tony, Steve?”
“You are so cheesy,” Tony complained, but he was laughing. He took a scoop of gelato for himself. “How are you feeling?”
He let Tony walk out to the balcony on his own. It was hard, maybe the hardest thing he’d ever done, but he let him do it. Tony had went from an underground silo to a basement prison to a heat room, and Steve hadn’t even realised until Tony told him. He’d been so caught up in his own relief that he hadn’t thought about how stir-crazy Tony must be feeling. His alpha hadn’t flown in weeks.
“The doctor will be with you soon,” Thor put in on the coms, and Steve swallowed. “Are you well, Captain?”
"Wait, why - I mean what do you mean?" she stumbled out, nervous as fuck.
“Not right now, baby,” he whispered as he pulled her back into his embrace. “He’s in surgery right now. Still alive though…”
“Hi Mr. Bucky!”
“Of course honey, just don’t feel obligated because of your ridiculous father,” his Pop chided at the man before he went back in their pantry to grab more ketchup.
“Oh, yeah, you’re uh...welcome,” Peter said with a weird look on his face. Tony scoffed from behind her before he gently ushered her to sit next to Steve as he passed out the snack bowls to the others.
And now, her fucking locker wouldn’t open. The noise of banging the accursed metal contraption meant she didn’t hear a crowd approach her – the flat-chested anorexic looking bitch at the forefront.
“I think he was in for vandalizing…” she cut off quickly when she noticed Peter staring intently at her. “I mean, he was being awarded for uh…epic heroism for…saving a bunch of nuns stuck in a tree.”
But he was still silent as he kept walking over to the couch, before turning around to sit. She stopped short and just stood, waited for him to speak but ended up talking first when he simply reached over to grab his drawing pad.
“Fine. Whatever. You can enjoy my sloppy seconds -” Stone began before Steve’s fist collided with his face, knocking the pathetic Alpha back onto the ground. And when the sniveling coward tried to stand back up, Steve found it easy to use his Voice against him.
“Alright baby girl, walk to Uncle Steve,” he encouraged as she toddled a few steps forward. Steve reached his arms out invitingly just as she plopped down on her diaper. She startled to crawl to him before her dad pulled her back to try again.
And had taken half of the weapons and some of the best designers with him.
…and he said
’?” Clint asked with such enthusiasm Daci couldn’t refuse the request.
"Well, considering the analysis I think a cystoscopy would be best. It would flush your system out and end the cramping. And if it makes you feel any better I have done this procedure plenty of times all around the world. I have seen many...vaginas." Tony couldn't help but laugh at his friend's awkwardness, glad to see his kid smile a little at that as well. Steve elbowed Tony to pay better attention, turning back to Bruce as he tried to explain himself better.
“Tony’s an adult?”
." He tensed below her so she quickly spoke up to reassure him.
"Peter," his Pop said addressing the teenager again. "You cannot be a superhero twenty-four seven.
“When I was six, they got drunk and stoned and drove into oncoming traffic on the highway. Took out a family of five as well as an old couple…” Clint trailed off, releasing Bucky’s hand before it slowly trailed up his body and touched the ear sporting a purple aid. Something heartbreaking and rancid twisted in brunette’s soul.
If he was being honest, he was mostly mad at himself for how jealous he was of the man. The incredibly good looking, obviously rich and apparently long-term partner of his husband. Thinking of that man touching him…
“Thought you said this wasn’t a date?” the brunette asked innocently. Steve’s jaw snapped shut and panic began to set in. “I’m sorry, you’re just very easy to tease. Like you said, this isn’t a date. Just two friends getting to know each other. I’d apologize but honestly I’m not that sorry, you’re even cuter when you blush.”
“Isaac, Lillian, this is my friend, Leo. Leo, this is Lilli and Izzy,” Wade introduced the three as the twins enthusiastically waved at their new friend. Leo nodded to the two, though Pete could see the beginnings of a smile forming on the little boy’s face.
"Oo, do I hear wedding bells?" her obnoxiously blonde father piped in. Before she could remind him they had had
“Cause I smoked pot?” she asked hopefully.
Almost two months into their relationship, Tony noticed he was starting to feel funny. It was a familiar sense but he couldn’t quite put his finger on it. Until he woke up one morning nauseous.
Must be some kind of protective reaction from the spider bite.
“I was thinking of…I don’t know…going to school for business and maybe…one day…running Stark Industries?” her voice raised as if it was a question, looking weary at the two fathers. Their Dad dropped his fork and sat back to look at her. He quickly got up from his seat to wrap her in a hug.
! He’s responsible for my arm,” Bucky said, way more drunk than Steve and waving his metal prosthetic around.
“Wade?” he heard his Pop ask, this time his voice was much closer. Heavy footsteps came to a halt at Peter’s side. “You…you’re Deadpool?” Peter’s eyes sprung wide, just now realizing his father must’ve heard Wade say that. He, apparently, was able to skip past the whole died and came back to life part.
"What the hell I thought you were trying to win me over??"
“Don’t look at me,” Peter said throwing his hands up in surrender. That leaves one.
“Do you actually think that,” Steve spoke dangerously quietly, “after nineteen years of being married to you?”
Now this man, this fucking man Steve was familiar with. Though he’s been dead nearly twenty years, Steve still wished he could bring that man back long enough to kick his ass for what he did to Tony.
speak about my son that way again,” Joe said with an alarming calm, towering over the man who was struggling to sit up. “It’s bad enough you speak to your sweet boy that way, who I’d be honored to call a son-in-law, but you will not speak about
Spiderman, then we're cool," Tony said with a smile, which dropped a little at the weird stare the kid was giving him. Miles looked back up to his sister in awe.
"And you two were occupying your workout area, so we thought this room had enough space to practice."
Only a few more chapters left of this story! Thank you all for such lovely comments <3 it honestly inspired me to write way more than intended
. I am also very mad about what that…
“No one is doing that, Buck. We’re just concerned about you,” Steve said as Stark returned, no longer on the phone but now holding a bottle of some kind as he made his way back to the others.
“Yes baby?”
That earned a snort from Em and a deeper glare from Steve. “Peter…son, that is two marks at my age. Do I need to remind you what the punishment is for making fun on my age?” Peter sat, unfazed.
He smiled at Wade as the man smiled back, hugging the boy tighter into his embrace as they walked along back to the car; refusing to let homophobic idiots ruin their perfectly happy day.
“So, Tony, what was the problem?” he asked the man who was currently tickling both toddlers.
He had no idea how his brother had this much patience, watching him chase her around with a diaper, pleading to the toddler.
“Holy shit,” she said to no one, hand slightly shaking from shock. She shook her head and put the drink down, using both hands to peel the envelope open. It was a single page that she flattened out, not even recognizing the handwriting since she’d never even seen Kimberly write anything. Emerson thought offhandedly that it was pretty before she began reading.
His anger surged him forward, taking the steps to join the others in their shared space. The group’s conversation died as they all turned to him in bewilderment.
“It’s what I am, isn’t it? And plus, you already took Daddy.”
“Bruce is in his lab and I’m sure when he and Natasha get back from shopping Clint won’t mind helping you,” Steve said as he gently pushed his husband in the direction of their bedroom. Peter and Harley joined them a moment later as Daci took a seat on the couch, her father heading to the kitchen to no doubt call Vivienne.
A…man? A man in a red mask standing against twenty guys? Peter hesitated rushing in when he saw the vigilante pull two guns from his holsters and fire back at the men. All the goons the masked man were up against quickly fell and soon the red-suited mystery man stood alone, even when most had returned gunfire.
Not that he wasn’t great in the beginning; his boyish charm and rugged good looks made Tony an instant gonner. He just remembers how he had been a little…inexperienced.
“Just…maybe let me…” she tried to compromise.
“Thank you, let me tell them first then I’ll follow you,” Steve said, turning to inform his kids. He walked up as Sam was throwing a tantrum – how he was losing this early in a children’s game Steve didn’t know.
Clint...was the reason he had broken out of HYDRA the last time. The reason he was able to escape and eventually find his kid.
The rest of the evening was spent playing various board games and charades as one by one the Avengers slowly made their exit. Each offered another smile and hug to the teen, and she hoped no one noticed her red face when Shuri also gave her a hug goodbye. If they did, they didn’t say anything.
“Actually,” she teased with a smile, “I’d rather go on Ellen. You know, gay teen with gay dads on a gay woman’s talk show. It’d be
?" his Dad asked incredulously.
"So you just waltz into my country with a new haircut after we hadn't seen each other in years, and you're suddenly too good to greet the princess?" Emerson completely froze as the young woman came to a stop in front of her. She ignored her Dad snickering behind her as the silence grew between the two.
It worked on the blonde too.
“Fff-udge,” Steve gritted out, glad he caught himself with a toddler looking up at him in confusion.
“I’ve already forgiven you for Jarvis, squirt,” the genius said ruffling her hair. He took a moment to share a glance with his husband before continuing.
the one grave-robbing,” pausing to hear her laugh. “Hey, so I was calling cause I was wondering if you had any plans today?”
“Yeah well, Pointe Break has his hands full with two depressed and hormonal teenagers,” the brunette responded, hand pulling away as his husband threw his head back to laugh.
“Uncle Clint! Can we have pizza for dinner?” Peter asked the man as he flew past them, joining his siblings on the floor.
She sat on her Uncle Thor's lap as she watched her dads take their first dance as husbands. It was a small wedding, just the Avengers along with Pepper and Happy. Aunt Tasha had been her Daddy's best man while Uncle Steve had been her Tati's. Uncle Bruce had initiated it while Peter and Harley had been ring bearers and Morgan had been the flower girl. Daci stood next to her dads and had been included in the exchanging of vows, where her Daddy promised to love and support her forever. He had also adopted her, and the family of three had poured different colored sand into a glass vase. Daddy's was purple, Tati's was red while hers was blue. The three colors swirled around each other in the vase, which was currently at the head table for all to see. She was thinking of where on their floor the vase should go when the crowd cheered and Daci looked up in time to see her Tati dip her Daddy as the song finished.
“Tiberius Stone?” Steve finally said, hand drawing back when Tony practically scrambled off of him in panic.
Tony, the same man who had a wisecrack response to every statement, looked at Steve without so much as opening his mouth.
Peter stormed off in the direction of the lab, Em hot on his heels in curiosity. When they got to the glass door, Emerson could see Tony and Steve off to the left scrambling when they realized they were home. She followed in after Peter punched in his code, smiling as she saw the two adults looking utterly flustered and embarrassed.
“–Miss Rogers-Stark, you will call her by her legal name.” Mr. Jefferson stole a glance at Joey before turning back to her Dad.
He huffed and rolled his eyes as his uncle once again made a dramatic threat should he ever “scare the living shit out of him” again. He had explained three times that he didn’t care; he would do whatever it took to save his family. So now he sat quietly as his uncle went on and on, his Aunt Natasha letting him as she stood leaning against the wall inspecting her nail beds.
"Klaue," T'Challa accused immediately, frowning further when she nodded in response.
Before Tony could reprimand him, the Omega’s phone went off.
He was looking at his reflection in the foggy mirror, guilt seeping in as he heard a small knock on the bathroom door.
“You’re right,” Steve said quietly.
“Oh you traitorous snake!” Tony cried in outrage as Steve helped the baby rinse off. “Daci do you want to help me get a snack ready and leave these traitors to clean up?” Daci looked back and forth between the men before speaking quietly.
This stopped the teen, feeling as though the woman had literally stabbed her through her heart – chills going down her spine. She was equally amazed and furious.
“I thought you said you wanted a fair fight,” Joey tried, fists clenching and beginning to raise. She stole a look at Cara, who was hanging slightly back…but not making any move to stop what was about to happen.
“I know I’m not, but I
“What were you thinking, Peter?” Steve asked, wiping his hands on a towel.
He put down a wild card as slowly as possible, glaring at her the painfully slow way down. She smiled at him as she tried to glare back; too entertained by his antics to have any real anger behind it.
“Ngh,” he grunts, swiping a hand over his face. “What time is it?”
“Gonna paint me with your come?” Tony murmured, dark eyes wicked, and that was it for Steve. He fell forward with the force of his orgasm, bracing one hand on the ground next to Tony’s head as he felt like his entire body was turned inside out through his cock, long white stripes stringing over Tony’s stomach, his pectorals, the cool blue light of the reactor. It was that last that made Steve shudder, eyes closing briefly because it was just too much. The reactor was Tony’s life, his heart, metaphorical and physical, and to have it marked like that…
“Now murder is of course a cardinal sin, so even if it’s part of your job as a soldier, I think we’ll set you to a corporal work of mercy for every life you’ve taken since your last confession. At least one hour.”
“For the tentacle yaoi joke.”
Steve frowns. “But father-“
“Mine,” Tony was whispering, when Steve was able to concentrate on him again. “You’re mine, oh my god,
you. I wanted to hate you and you were so fucking beautiful, Steve, you’re unreal, you know that? The photos really don’t do you justice, it’s…” He pulls himself out of Steve’s embrace, stalking back to the bar. Every line of him is pulled taut, the corded muscles of his arms tight as he moves to pour himself another drink. His hands slice through the air with violence, each gesture sharp and economical. “Talking to you was like a nightmare. Everything…I know we don’t talk about my father, but-”
just couldn’t say it out loud.
“I need something immediate,” Tony says. Then he bites his lip. “Actually, text Tracey, too.”
Tony rocks his fingers in, back and forth. “Been a while, huh, Captain?”
,” Tony tells him. He laughs a little, shaking his head. Bruce’s fingers tangle in his curls. “You think I’m being kind? Bruce, I am the richest man in the
Tony blinks. He chews his mouthful of waffle, then swallows it very deliberately.
“Isn’t it?” Pepper glances at the slim gold watch on her hand, then stands. She buttons and smooths her blazer with a quick, graceful sweep of her hands. “I have a meeting in twelve minutes with the Chief of the NYPD Counterterrorism Bureau, so if you’ll excuse me.”
“Yeah, what of it?” Tony cuts in, speaking right over Cap. He can see where this is going, and he doesn’t anticipate any sentence that might come out of his mouth as particularly useful to avoiding a firefight. Cap stiffens, and Tony turns his head slightly to see Natasha behind him, likely restraining him in some subtle way. Good ol’ Nat.
Tony had come to his house Saturday morning and worked on their project together. The brunette had an idea to make a short film out of it, which got Steve excited about as he began sketching out some of the scenes Tony described. They were a pretty good team.
“Sup?” she said, not looking at him.
” she said with a smirk.
“What’s adekit mean?” Peter asked the two, seemingly unaware of them mock-glaring at each other as he continued coloring.
“I’m better knowing I have a Peter. And yes Mama, I just handed him back to the nurse after scenting him. He’s perfect. Just like his big brother,” Tony answered his parents while snuggling his pup that much closer to his body.
“But I didn’t raise a brat, Steve. Oh who am I kidding, this is clearly all my fault. He’s a spoiled pup and I failed as his Daddy and I’m going to fail this one too -”
"Alphas are so silly, aren't they Petey?" Clint cooed to the baby, who giggled in response and got a chuckle from the two Omegas.
"Language!" Peter said, tiny finger pointing at the teen.
“You’re welcome,” she whispered, still in a daze. Until her Pop pinched her arm, slightly annoyed at his two loves.
“Daredevil.”
But this one put a look on his husband’s face that demanded explanation.
“- don’t lie Steve. I see him. I know he doesn’t sleep. I see that look in his eye. He’s sad. And I can’t...I can’t change that. He needs...he needs what you and Tony have.” That got a quirked brow from the super soldier before a smile slowly spread across his face.
"Great, works good," she said with a smile as Helen moved to sit next to her on the couch, absolutely beaming with pride at her wife.
“Fine. I pick red,” Sam said smugly.
“No, but Uncle Bruce Uncle Clint and Uncle Thor aren’t either and I still call them uncle. ‘Cept for Aunt Tasha, obviously.”
“Steve, I swear I wouldn’t have left without a note, but there was a family emergency…” And oh, using one of the oldest excuses in the book to spare Steve’s feelings…
was because we needed to discuss something with you, and I was hoping to do it before dinner.” Joey felt herself freeze at that, not immediately digging into her plate as she watched the two of them carefully.
“You...you distracted me,” Tony replied weakly, a pout still on his cute face as he got another sheet of paper to copy whatever had been written on the other.
“You are! Daddy…stoooooop,” she said between laughs, breathing heavily in happy exhaustion when he finally did stop.
“You jerk!” he laughed out as Bucky held his hands up in defeat, chuckling along with him.
“Am I…am I spoiled?” Tony looked in the rearview mirror, surprised to see his boy was looking out the window with his question.
–” she choked the last word out before hiding her head in her hands, sobbing loudly in the otherwise quiet room. He saw his husband reach a hand out in comfort before Emerson threw a hand up, stopping him. He gently lowered his hands back onto his lap and Tony could see tears glistening in his super soldier’s eyes. She took a few more breaths before continuing.
They were silent as they made their way to his car, her Dad speaking up when they started making their way back home.
Peter was giddy the rest of the evening, even more so when Wade kissed him goodnight. The butterflies in his stomach continued fluttering as he made his way to his bedroom, glad everyone was asleep.
“You wanna help me pick out a new balcony couch?” he asked suggestively at his husband. Steve looked up at him in confusion, before mock glaring at the brunette. He leaned back against one of his work tables before responding.
[In a meeting, what’s up?]
...a textbook in his hands.
“And that is very sweet, Daciana. But that isn’t your job. Your job is to learn how to be a kid. And you are doing a great job with that,” he said with a smile, bringing his arms up to give her the option of a hug. Thinking about his earlier conversation with Bucky, he gave her the option patiently. She was already better with physical touch, and Steve would be lying if he said he didn’t love that after Bucky, he was the one she requested the most physical affection from.
“They count,” he said before lifting the smaller man’s legs up to focus on the other scars on his legs and feet from more ‘lab incidents.’ Tony laughed but otherwise remained silent, watching his love tenderly kiss each and every scar before moving up to another tattoo on his other rib.
“You’re…Peter Pan?” he asked confused, still confused when the heartthrob laughed before continuing.
When she had asked Steve later why they needed to be alone, the blonde’s cheeks turned pink and he just muttered something about ‘adult time.’ She would’ve liked to have asked Clint, but he and Natasha were away on a mission. Clint was still pleasant around them, but she could tell the archer was avoiding her and her Tati.
things so you can build a robot, right?" he asked, continuing when the boy nodded in response. "And you probably want to build a robot to build something that can't die, can't leave you...right?" he asked, looking into dark chocolate eyes that seemed to connect with his as the sweet boy nodded. Like they understood each other in that moment. Tony quickly pulled the boy back into his hug.
He hadn’t had another anger outburst - on the twins anyway. If the boy was extremely angry or upset, he lashed out at the pair. Mostly words, sometimes tiny fists. When Peter talked to his Pops about it on the phone, he said Leo was ‘testing him.’
And what made matters worse, was how inadvertently rude he was to Steve.
“BREAK PUNY BANNER’S LAB.”
“Bad dream?” he asked with a kind smile. She nodded in response as he pulled her into a hug, wrapping her arms around the man that had been nothing but kind to her since they day they met. His love and comfort gave her the courage to confess her fear to him.
," the Alpha growled, with the sheer audacity to try and use his Voice on him. At a bonded Omega. Who has long since been able to ignore any other Alpha's Voice but his mate's.
“Noooooo,” she cried out dramatically, flopping herself on the ground by Steve’s feet for good measure. Steve just continued drawing, focusing on the imaginary castle he was creating instead of the toddler currently giving him a headache.
He was finishing his second run of the day, enjoying their long driveway when he saw his son-in-law’s car parked next to his. Steve slowed down, putting his hands on his hips as he finished walking to the front door, trying to remember if his son mentioned anything about visiting today.
“Pop?” she asked, knowing he damn well deserved it and she keeps forgetting to try it. He froze a little at that, hand moving to gently grip her shoulder. “What happened to me?” she asked, refusing to look at him as she felt tears prickling her eyes.
“Hey, so…I don’t think either of your dads are dying.” Joey practically had whip lash turning back so quickly to him.
he had gotten these new powers and web shooters? Or because he had trapped an innocent kid in his web, mistaking him for a thief? Probably all three, he thought as he swung quickly home – after he had helped the panicked mother, of course. He changed before arriving back at the Tower, frowning to himself on the ride up to the elevator. The frown deepened when the door opened, revealing a voice he didn’t immediately recognize.
“–No, see I don’t pay you people to give me this bare minimum bullshit.”
why I saved you," the princess confessed, eyes cast down as Emerson stared at her incredulously. The teen's mouth open and closed many times before any sound came out.
Tony moved away from the food, anticipating his son’s next move as the pup dropped the ball and kicked it at him. It came at him faster than usual, so Tony ducked at the last minute and let the ball fly.
“Rhodey deserves a plague of locusts on his house for this. I’m serious,” he continued when Steve started laughing, “I should send a mariachi band to follow him for a month, I’m seriously considering murdering my best friend.”
“After tonight, neither of you can bug me about going out for at least six months,” Steve said as he tossed Clint his keys, following the two out to his truck. Natasha and Sam were already at the bar, as was Thor who was chugging a beer. The bar was crowded but not claustrophobic and when Thor put a shot in front of him he instantly took it.
“It’s in regards to this evening’s attire…” the brunette began as they made their way into the entrance and saw the toddlers attacking Miles, while Pete, Wade, Emerson and Leo were curled around one of Tony’s tablets. “You see,” his love continued, “one of our brilliant toddlers decided to be a Disney princess for Halloween and now insists
Now, where the hell do I get a tux?
“Maybe she’s in the shower?” Tony offered as Peter stayed cuddled on his lap. Steve frowned before answering.
“It’s the senior luau! You promised I could go last week!” she whined to the two.
She stopped in her tracks when she heard another voice and realized he wasn’t alone.
“Leaving,” he answered honestly looking his Pop in the eyes. Steve’s heart had been through a LOT in the last twenty four hours. But this was his son, and he could spare a little longer for him. He steeled himself to continue, putting an arm around his boy’s shoulder.
“Who are you guys talking about?” Clint asked as he ate some grapes on the couch.
“I know, bear, it’s gross but it’ll make you feel better,” Steve said sympathetically, taking the cup back when he finished.
“Well,” Tony offered, “I do have a Californian King should you need some company, kiddo. I promise Steve and I will be fully clothed and everything.” She smiled as Steve rolled his eyes heavily.
“Hey Em, think you can handle keeping these fools in line for me? I’m going to go grab a quick nap with your brother.” She stopped making a mess as she smiled at him.
“I told you she apologized for that.”
“Right, but someone else could have, if you found it. Right?” Bucky asked with a knowing smile, that had Clint wondering if Bucky knew he pickpocketed him.
Physically, he was fine. The teachers rushed over the second Harley kneeled at recess and separated the little assholes from his son before a fight could break out, but mentally...well...his pup was essentially a zombie.
“I go nakey!”
“Like…a decade?”
“Don’t worry about it, man.” Steve sighed heavily.
A few minutes later he heard feet approaching, looking up to see Jarvis looking down at him with a smile. His parents weren’t as forthcoming with physical signs of love, but Jarvis and his wife always were. He reached his hands out and Jarvis immediately pulled him into his arms, cuddling with him on the couch.
He stole a glance at the sky, knowing his big brother was probably smiling down at them.
“You...hate being with Peter and Wade?” He looked up at that in shock, quickly shaking his head no before explaining.
“Come on,” he offered to Emerson who sat laughing in her seat, “let’s go watch a movie and let the love birds do the dishes.” She got up to join him.
Finally, he unlocked his phone and dialed the number, pressing the green button before he could chicken out.
“Too late Steve, pretty sure she’s officially a Stark now,” he said as he swayed her back and forth in his arms. And damn, if Steve couldn’t help smiling at that.
Steve definitely should’ve called in to work the next day. He was beyond exhausted. He even tried going for an additional run this morning. But now he was mentally, emotionally
“Ah, and how did the router ‘accidentally fall’ from the table?” Tony asked as the kid shrugged his shoulders in answer, a smile still evident on his face. “Uh huh, well why don’t you help Steve and I’ll go have a look, okay?” the brunette asked before leaving the two blondes alone.
"Uh huh! Papa told me you lost it when you were little, Mama helped me find one!" he said excitedly.
“Who is she?” she asked, eyes trained on the woman who was smiling down at the girl. The smile was real, but she could see a subtle shift in the woman’s blue eyes that kept her weary.
“She said I had a pretty drunk
Bucky was sitting on the couch with a sleeping Peter in his lap, his index finger held up to his lips for emphasis. The two men immediately quieted and walked carefully over to the other super soldier holding their son.
," she said shooting a glare at her taller father. Tony once again couldn't help but chuckle, realizing that crossing his arms revealed the red marks around his wrists from the cuffs he was wearing earlier. The blonde blushed furiously as he stretched the sleeves back down, moving to stop Emerson as she began walking back to the exam room.
"Poppy," Samantha garbled with a smile.
“You should be more concerned for your own life,” Bucky growled as he moved to stand up, but not before a tiny hand shot out and grabbed his flesh wrist.
“I dont give a flying fuck about that, what do you mean little hot piece of Omega-ass??” Steve couldn’t help but smirk at that, happy to have the attention taken from him.
“Fine. So…when Staci…”
He figures buttering them up would instantly look suspicious, but also knew his ridiculous parents enough to know getting them things wouldn't hurt. Not as much as his words, anyway.
Steve was looking increasingly angry, good. “Please, don’t tell me this is about Bucky…”
"It's a Simba!" she cried out in excitement as she showed everyone the toy. "Peter did you know I used to have one of these?"
“You’re right, I wouldn’t have let you drink alcohol in a back alley because you’re sixteen fucking years old!” he yelled as she hung her head in defeat. He made himself take a breath, calming down to continue.
Peter’s hands went up in shock, standing back in fear a little away from the superhero. Clint’s eyes burned with so much anger Peter wondered if his uncle would actually hit him.
, he thought as they both use protection when having sex. He needed further consultation, so he dropped Harley off with his parents and went to see his favorite doctor - Bruce.
"Even though I...
play the game she picked.
I don’t need anyone else…
“Fine. But only because you’ve never even been to a party. And have drank a total of …?” he asked, waiting for Steve to answer.
But right now she was too distracted by the fact her father was going on
“Okay,” May began, “what first? I’m particularly interested in leading this conversation and just absolutely validating the shit out of you, but I wanted to give you a chance to steer the convo,” she offered. Joey bit her lip as she smiled at this incredible woman, genuinely thinking her offer over as she chewed her lip for a moment longer.
“You did good little one, we’re all done now,” he said with a smile in his voice. She curled up further into his embrace and smiled when she heard him chuckle at that. He wrapped both arms around her again in a bear hug and resumed kissing the top of her head.
Tony stayed behind to pay as Miles was allowed to rip all the tags off before running to join his father and sister's walk back to the palace. Peter stayed behind, still wearing his new outfit out of the store, but staying to give his Dad some company.
To explore his new home, Clint thought with warm and fuzzy feelings welling up inside of him.
Miles was silently watching the man with an intriguing look on his face, while Emerson was watching with a glare and occasionally grumbling to her self.
“I don’t care. I like Melanie,” the boy said simply. The happiness etched on his face made Peter’s heart ache in a way he couldn’t describe. Wade looked at Peter a moment longer before shrugging and turning back to their foster son.
“Why don’t you go to your room and give us some privacy?” he asked in a less demanding tone, moving to help her down off the counter. She begrudgingly obliged, shooting a look Tony’s way before hobbling out of the room.
“Hey, I gotta let you go, the most beautiful girl in the world just walked into my office,” he said with a wink to her as she sat across from him.
“Alright, time for you two to go. I’m not taking any pictures, so save your selfies for the actual prom. Go away, don’t drink and drive, be safe yadda yadda yadda get out of here,” Barney said as he shoved a laughing Bucky off the couch.
“…Deadpool?” he asked incredulously.
“Alright…Aunt May…” Jo said with a smile and looked down at her lap. She felt her Pop teasingly pinch her shoulder, but chose to ignore him in favor of focusing on joining her brother and coloring like the kid she still was.
“I never wanted any of that from Tony or any of that tabloid BS for Peter. I have a career because I never want to have to depend on a man. I mean, Tony will pay for his first car, college, that I have no problem with,” she paused as they both laughed again. “Tony’s my friend and we both knew we never would’ve worked out, we’re way too similar. But we’re a good team for Petey.”
“That’s not funny,” she said, yanking her arm away when they approached Mr. Jefferson’s door; mortified with the sudden turn of events.
“–ditto,” their son added, getting a choked laugh from the teary girl.
She also stole a glance in the mirror, frowning at how very red her ass and upper thighs were. She quickly but again, gently, put the pj bottoms on before walking to her parents’ bedroom. She had to stop once along the way to readjust her pants, suddenly feeling childish enough to confidently walk in.
“Enough Miss Smith,” said the mediator, “we agreed to have this meeting under the preamble you would control your language.”
Tony couldn’t help smiling, secretly glad for the reminder of how freaking adorable his son was as a kid. He made a mental note to get the recording from JARVIS later.
This was one of the few times he was actually glad he married rich. Including this whole trip, of course.
His good mood was soured, however, when he walked in the front door and was immediately chastised by his brother.
“I can’t believe this,” Peter sighed out, bringing his hands up to rub his eyes in frustration.
“It was great! We talked about what we want to make for Mother’s Day. But hey, Papa?”
“You can’t stop me Miles. I figured it out. This spider is the key to everything! I’ll be strong, superhuman strong - not some weak and pathetic shrimp. I’ll be a hero! My father will-” his speech was interrupted by the groans coming from the ceiling. Miles reached for him, but was knocked back by some debris as the ceiling came down on them.
“When’s he getting here?” Jo asked as she walked ahead of him to the kitchen.
“Jo?” he asked gently. The teen looked up at him, throwing herself up off the couch and into the brunette’s arms. He easily caught her, kissing the top of her head as he saw just a few scrapes on her, still wondering what the actual fuck had happened.
“Harley was waiting for an hour before I went to get him,” Steve explained, further fueling the fire. Because fuck Tiberius Stone.
“Aw, come on baby. Come sit by me and I’ll make it worth your while,” Steve said with a wink while patting the seat next to him.
When he thought about the possibility of bonding with Steve...he didn’t hate the idea.
“I’m trying to lay low, obviously,” he teased, smiling at her unimpressed look.
“I’m…I’m really sorry Steve,” Tony said sadly, causing the blonde to stop in his tracks. He walked over to Tony’s bed and sat next to him, smiling at him as he rested his hand on Tony’s knee.
“Yeah Steve this is Nanny’s house,” Becca added in a smug tone, reaching for a cookie and getting swatted away by their Pop. “Hey!”
“My favorite movie, it’s Jurassic Park.”
“And neither will I.”
“Thank you…Peter,” he said, laughing immediately at his own joke as Joey grabbed a pillow and smacked it on his head
“More than enough,” she grumbled after rolling her eyes.
Steve made hot chocolate as the teen showered in one of the guest bedrooms, Tony not helping but providing company.
On the Saturday about a month before their vacation, Emerson finally decided on a haircut and asked the blonde to take her. Tony was gone for the weekend at a Stark convention in LA, which she asked if they could surprise him by not telling him until he saw it in person. Steve almost disagreed but decided it would be too great not to. They'd text Peter pictures, but they knew he always loved keeping a secret from their Dad. That morning, when Emerson refused to show her idea to her father, Miles had joined them and asked if he could also get his hair cut.
“Huh,” Tony says, because that can’t be right. “Um.”
Tony leans down and takes a kiss, this one deeper than the others. He slips his tongue into Steve’s mouth, slow and sexy and a little filthy, and Steve takes it. He closes his eyes and lets Tony take whatever he wants from him. He bunches his fingers in Tony’s shirt to keep him close, traces his fingers over the muscles in his back.
“I didn’t know that,” Peter says, frowning. “Weren’t you a kid?”
“You promised me a way out if I asked. Anywhere I wanted to go.”
“That would be wise.”
There were a few scattered laughs at that, which was enough for Steve to count as a win. Slowly, the group began to break up, Bruce going back to trawling through data logs, Clint turning back to the holoscreen as well to track some of the contacts he and Nat had reached out to in the hopes of gaining more information about the team that had taken Tony. Natasha, predictably, rose from her seat and slid in next to Steve at the head of the table, folding her hands together over the worktop screen. Her green eyes were unflinching, assessing him for a long moment in which Steve tried to decide if he should look away or not.
"I'm willing to help, Captain, not an idiot," Loki scoffs. The prickling feeling disappears, now that he's looking for it. Tony grunts and lands next to Cap.
“Green,” Steve says, immediately. “Neon, flashing green. Jesus, Mary, and Joseph, Tony, can’t you tell-
Well. That’s news to Steve.
“What the
“If I remember in the morning,” Tony mutters.
Steve glanced at the satellite view of the town where Hydra might or might not have been spotted. “If I were Hydra I’d pick one of these concrete residential towers. If this is anything like the rest of post-Soviet Europe, the locals probably rent the apartments out to tourists pretty often. It would be easy to bring lots of different foreign folks in and out of an operation like that. Disguise tech inside big fancy cameras, bring things in and out through designer shopping bags. If you pay in cash, it’s untraceable, unlike the hotels. A lot of these folks are happy to take a wad of Euros or Dollars and stay quiet. They don’t trust the authorities, honestly with good enough reason.”
Tony thinks. God, why couldn’t he have bonded to Bruce?
“Bruce was right, you know,” Natasha said, and Steve glanced over his shoulder at her.
“I am sorry, Tony, for what I must say now. Perhaps it is best that our captain is not here.”
Tony wakes up to the cacophonous honking of midtown traffic with a muscle ache in his neck and sunlight streaming bright into his bedroom. The bed is empty, and he scratches at his scalp for a moment in confusion, licking the dryness from his lips.
“What do you mean,” Tony says flatly. Steve doesn’t really know. He looks at his hands, fingers wrapped oh so carefully around the yellow cardboard. A little girl with riotous curls smiles back at him from the box. After a while, he hears Tony take another bite of sandwich.
“-love you, beautiful, sweet omega, so good for me-” Tony was saying, and Steve whined and opened himself up as much as he could. He was so sensitive, Tony’s fingers skating up his body, grazing over his nipples, and Steve squirmed and cried out.
Steve couldn’t really understand what Tony was saying. For alpha-omega pairs, the biological urge to bond with a partner that someone had been monogamous with for as long as they had was almost overpowering. The likelihood that they’d come out the other side of it unbonded was slim to none. Was this Tony’s way of saying yes without having to freak out about actually saying yes?
,” Steve blurts.
“Are you asking me to infiltrate the NIA and retrieve their surveillance footage, sir?”
Tony sneers. "It's hard to love me, yeah, you said."
Tony laughs softly, caught somewhere between disbelief and embarrassment. “Thanks?” he says. He isn’t sure if he should be flattered or not. That did seem a little backhanded, but he can’t help but feel like Thor’s just given him his blessing or something equally ridiculous.
“Iron-Man!” Hawkeye shouts, running towards him at a full tilt, but Tony isn’t paying any attention to her. He’s watching Amora, veins crawling up her neck a sluggish black. She’s shaking with electricity, eyes rolled back into her head, a hybrid syringe and taser arrow sticking out of her spine.
He loves New York in the summer. The city is always alive, humming with energy, but there’s something intensely satisfying about the palatable joy of the first weeks of warmth, the way the collective populace seems to get up and stretch off the cold and the dark. Flowering trees bloom on every street, tulips rioting down the street dividers. The sidewalks are flooded with buskers playing music, free concerts and movie showings filling the parks with the raucous sounds of laughter and life. It took a while for him to learn her newness, the different form she’d taken, but the city now is everything he’s always loved and more, new sights and sounds and smells. She’s still beautiful, after all these years, still too much and everything at once. Steve closes his eyes, waiting for a walk sign, and drowns in it.
