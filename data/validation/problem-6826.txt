"For a genius, you sure are an idiot." He chuckles at her shrewdness, but it's not really malicious or an insult, it's just her way of breaking the ice between them with a harmless joke. "In all seriousness, I think you should talk to him. Ya know, considering you guys haven't talked in five days, it might do some good."
. Fucking. Touch me." The God of Thunder just looked at him, understanding where his anger was coming from. "I tried to help solve this whole situation, and instead I put myself in danger; no, not just myself, but the rest of us as well! I'm not going to do this, I cannot and
"It can't be that bad." And for once it felt like everything was okay- that he and Tony were going to be fine. They were talking, they were communicating, that was good! It was as normal as they were going to get at the moment while everything was hectic around him. But for now, he was just going to enjoy hearing Tony's talking to him, joking with him, voice so full of care and concern. It was enjoyable.
your fault. What happened to me sucks, believe me, I know it does, but you shouldn't beat yourself up over it. We can get through this together."
"Steve?" Tony's voice quivered slightly, silence being the only response. "Romanoff, Barton?" He tried calling the others. He looked at the screen where he was connected to their commlinks, a red hue with white words that read "DISCONNECTED" ran across the screen. "Fuck!" He swore, slamming his hands on the desk. "JARVIS, what happened? Can we get them back?"
it had taken place. I was able to crack it in time and try to warn them, but... Jarvis said an EMP took out their communication devices. So, whatever it is you guys encountered, it's serious and we need to do something."
"Please wake up... I can't do this." He whispered. He crumbled up the sheets in his hands, squeezing them until his knuckles turned white. The first wave of tears dripped onto the sheets, a sob escaping past his lips shortly after. He whipped them away as fast as they came but soon enough, more replaced the first wave. He released the bed sheets and placed his head in his hands, letting his sobs wrack his body as the noise coming from his mouth was muffled behind his hands. He didn't even acknowledge when the door to the room opened and a hand was placed on his shoulder, causing him to jump and flinch in response. He turned around and noticed Natasha, a deep scowl etched into her face as she looked at him.
"God it feels good to kiss you again." Another giggle found its way out of Steve's mouth, pecking Tony's lips shortly after it was released into the air.
"No," he responded softly at first, clearing his throat and putting away the sketchbook between the headboard and the mattress before speaking again, louder this time, "no, Jarvis, I'm fine. I just... Need to clear my mind."
"Can I kiss you?" He quietly asked. It was the broken chuckle that he heard first, and the sad smile he saw first, accompanied by the tear that hit his cheek that he felt first before Tony nodded his head. And he seized the moment because this is what he's wanted all this time; to feel this man's lips against his, to be in love with someone who was the complete opposite of him, but complimented his personality so well because of how different they were.
"It's all so confusing, J. But I wanna make him happy." It was the truth. Kissing Steve made him feel things for the soldier, and while it was weird that Tony was falling for a guy, let alone his best friend, it still felt right. Don't get him wrong, he was no stranger to exploring his sexuality, nor was he a stranger to inviting guys over and having copious amounts of sex with them, but this wasn't just having sex with them. No, this was starting a serious relationship or trying to form one with someone close to him. He didn't want to fuck it up, but some changes would happen. However, he was sure they would work it out, and it was that fact alone that made him smile.
He removed himself from his lab environment and made his way towards the elevator that carried him towards the kitchen. There were a lot of things Tony usually tried to prepare himself for, but as he entered the kitchen, he was not prepared to see Pepper, sitting there accompanied by Bruce. Actually, he hadn't expected to even see Pepper come by the tower even by herself, so he was quite shocked that she was even here, considering that he thought she would be most likely dealing with SI.
"Captain," a deep, accented voice called out to him, which belonged to none other than the King of Wakanda himself, T'Challa. "You appear to be deep in thought, are you alright?"
And he wondered to himself if he should really believe that. This whole mess started because Tony called him under pretense, which led to him being sent to the raft where he got beaten every day, basically left there to die at the hands of Ross. And now, could Steve put his faith, his broken trust, his damaged, aching heart full of love for this man into believing for a second, that the words Tony was speaking were the truth. Could he
"Well, that's certainly a mood killer," Bucky said. Steve shook his head and jogged forward, making his way towards the double steel doors.
There are many things that Tony Stark is willing to and not to do. One of the things he is willing to do is to protect those he cares about. He doesn't like to see the people closest to him hurt, that's mostly why he spends copious amounts of hours locked in his lab to make sure that the team has their equipment up to tip-top shape to minimize any casualties or injuries. Well, that and sometimes he locks himself in his lab to escape some of the harsh realities or unnecessary conversations people want to have with him, but that's not the point. What Tony is not willing to do is sit back and relax knowing that those things that hurt Steve are still out there. That he wasn't going to let go so easily, because once again, he cares about those closest to him.
health when the person fighting for their life is laying there, broken, bruised, and bloody." He spoke as calmly as he could. It was hard to even tell himself that everything was going to be ok, but he didn't know if it really was.
"So, Uhm... Did you have fun chatting with those two?" He speaks quietly. He doesn't think much of it, and just simply offers a nod. "That's good, I'm glad you're comfortable speaking to others that aren't me." And now he's confused because it sounds like Tony is just a bit furious with him, if not just a little bit annoyed. Why would Tony be mad at him, he didn't really do anything wrong.
"Steve?" The voice says. He looks towards the couch and half sees both occupants looking at him. And he was right, on who was sitting there. Bucky and Natasha. "You ok?" Natasha was the one to ask. He opens his mouth to reply, but looks down to the floor and closes it shortly after. He doesn't want her to know about his predicament, it's already hard enough having to deal with it by himself now. But as he looks up, he just sees a knowing smile on her face.
serious, because if there was something terribly wrong with Steve, he would not be able to live that down.
"It was a wild ride, wasn't it? You seem to be just as weak as I imagine, and yet you act like you're tough." I whimpered, he was right. He's seen what's inside my head, all the repressed memories I choose to forget and move forward from, they made me stronger but... Reliving them again only made me realize how weak they truly made me. His smile grew and I could see him reaching for something. He brought what looked like a syringe in front of my eyes, bright yellow liquid sloshing around on the inside. "Why don't we get a look at you, the
"Yes, boss." Came the quick reply, as well as the quick action. He stepped away from the screen, wanting to occupy himself with work instead of the thoughts swirling inside his head like a tornado. He had adjustments to his suit to make, and he's come a long way in nanotechnology and is hoping to put the finishing touches on his suit.
"Technically he does, considering it was S.H.I.E.L.D. who found your body in the ice and thawed you out. So whether you like it or not, your S.H.I.E.L.D. property." The word 'property' left a bad taste not just in Steve's mouth, but Tony's as well. It also left a feeling of anger swelling inside the chest of the super soldier, his hands forming into fists at his side.
He brought the tip of the bottle to his lips, savoring how refreshing the water was to his parched throat. He let out a content sigh and offered to buy her a drink from the vending machine, but she politely declined. He didn't push it and instead decided on sparking a conversation with her as they walked around S.H.I.E.L.D. for a little bit to clear his mind.
"Remind me never to listen to anything the government says," Natasha said as he walked past her, making him chuckle. "Anyways, better get back to Wakanda. Gotta upload some files onto the internet." She smiled at him and looked down at Tony, casting a warm, gentle smile his way before bounding past him and up the stairs.
"I'm so sorry." He said softly, placing his hand on her shoulder. She turned her head in his direction, her eyes glistening with unshed tears. "I know sorry doesn't fix what happened to your family, but I want you to know that my company was run by my evil second-in-command, and I didn't know about it."
being around, or at the very least seeing him. He needs confirmation that Tony is okay because he won't be okay if he doesn't hear Tony's voice ever again.
"You seem a bit more jittery than usual, Tony. Are you sure you're ok?" The good Doctor, Bruce, asked him. He took a sip from his cup, enjoying the feeling of hot liquid trailing down his throat and igniting a fire in his chest that always sent a spark of energy coursing through him. He placed the cup down and smiled brightly, but it was nothing more than a way to get them off his back.
"The timestamps are similar, same date, same time, but different places. So, there actually is another Fury running around here..." He whispered to himself. He watched as one Fury was talking with his teammates, and watched as the other Fury was talking to the field agent department. His ears picked up on the faint sound of Fury speaking in the footage.
"Would you change what you did?" He looked Tony straight in the eyes, serious expressions on both of their faces. "If you had the chance to take back what you did; if you could have changed the decision you made about crashing that plane in the water, would you?"
Are you people liking the story? I do hope it does keep you interested, and I'll update the story here and there when I can, given that I want to keep you guys interested haha. Just tell me what you think, and I'll try to respond!
"You should give yourself more credit than you tell yourself, Anthony." That got the gears in his head turning, nobody, and he means
"Fear is a powerful foe, isn't it?" It whispered. The sound of crushing metal resonated in Tony's ears, pressure being felt in his left forearm. He looked down quickly, noticing the vice-like grip of the fake Steve that made the metal groan and creak until eventually, it broke, bits and pieces of his suit falling onto the floor, the blue light of his left gauntlet flickering until it too, just like his right gauntlet, turned grey. The right side of his helmet was the next thing to chip away, caught in the grip of the alien, his eyes wide like saucers as it held his face, a malicious glint shimmering in its eyes.
"Oh, right." They shared a small laugh, a happy warm feeling spreading through both their chests. "I'm sorry."
So, he spends his time listening to T'Challa talk about how he's been rereading the accords and feels as if there is a way to change the documents so that it will be able to guarantee the safety of Steve, and the other rogue Avengers as well. He thinks that this is a great opportunity to get the entire team back together, and hopefully make amends to the terrible situation everybody is in, but while he is totally on board with what T'Challa is saying, he also tells the king that Steve is his top priority right now and that he wants to try and help him out first.
"It makes sense," Natasha spoke softly, "anybody at S.H.I.E.L.D. giving those mission details would've looked suspicious. With Fury being the Director he can bypass most of the rules here and nobody would bat an eyelash. So, that means there is another copy of Fury running around here, but the question is where?"
"This is some powerful stuff." I heard Tony mutter, the now empty syringe dropped on the table. The sound of metal scraping against metal met my ears, and I felt my head being pulled back once more by Tony's hand gripping my hair. "You want this to end, right? You want this pain and suffering to end?"
"Not even with Pepper?" He gazed down into the once again bright blue eyes, reverted to their natural color that he absolutely cherished looking into. He also noticed upon closer inspection, that there was a hint of green mixed in with the blue, but it didn't overpower them, no, rather it complimented them.
I was back in Brooklyn, everything just the way it was before I went under the ice; the streets were bustling with people, gals with their arms around their guys, kids playing in the streets where the cars didn't drive through, normal people just carrying on with their daily lives. I miss this, I miss
While he waited for the call to go through, he had to try and move Steve so when medics came it would be easier for them to transport him. There was just... So much blood. He doesn't have hemophobia, it's just the fact that it's
"Look if you're not gonna say anything, just know that breakfast is ready." It was then that he wasted no more time and stood up, causing Tony to flinch. He frowned for a second, but he pushed away from the fleeting sadness that tried to claw at him, making his way out of the door and into the hallway. He waited for Tony to close the door before the genius started to lead him down the weird curved hallway, familiar steel beams that had just enough space between them for him to see the rays of the afternoon sun beaming down on the great grassy yard outside. And suddenly, it made sense where he was.
"That's not really fair," Steve said, a hint of defiance in his voice. Tony furrowed his eyebrows, a crease forming between them. Just what was going on?
"Alright team, listen up," he started, making eye contact with all of them, "the streets are overrun, and the Triskelion is probably crawling with these things. Wanda, Nat, I want you two with me on the ground. We need to evacuate all civilians we see and clear the streets. Clint, I want you high in the sky, you see anything out of the ordinary, you inform us, or you shoot it down. After we get the streets cleared, we move in. Banner, you see the situation take a turn for the worse, you Hulk out. Thor and Tony, I want you guys to get inside the building. Clear the inside, and we'll move in on your command. Understood?" They all nodded their heads in response. Steve dismissed them, Natasha and Clint heading back towards the front of the Quinjet where the pilots sit, Wanda, Bruce, and Thor casually take their seats inside the jet, and Tony was still standing in the same spot.
He sighed heavily for what now felt like the tenth time, even if realistically it was less than that, and he picked up the screwdriver again, working on the nano-reactor for his new suit, all thoughts of Steve pushed to the back of his mind, but just slightly buzzing around his head in case he dared to forget the man he still loved.
"I'm so sorry. I'm so, so sorry, Tony." Steve cried. The genius placed soft kisses on his forehead, wrapping his arms around the blonde's neck, whispering sweet things into his ear to calm him down.
of a time where someone said they thought he hated them. Don't get him wrong, there are things worth him hating, but he had hoped Steve never thought he truly hated him. They had their dispute on the helicarrier, words laced with venom thrown back and forth like a game of dodgeball, trying to take the other out of the game. It was a vicious game, words were said that neither could really take back, but they've come a long way since then, and it kinda hurt to hear those words come out of Steve's mouth.
"The inside is pretty old and abandoned, so far we still haven't seen anything. However, it does seem like we're in some sort of Hydra facility." Steve said.
His feet led him to the couch where he promptly sat down, cloud-like cushions contorting to his body shape as he leaned back to relax.
"Steve! Hang in there!" He shouted. He couldn't hold on, because death was already creeping closer to him, holding his hand and metaphorically whispering in his ear that it was his time once more. And he didn't fight it, he's lived a long life just like he told himself he did, as he chose by putting the Red Skull's plane, the Valkyrie, in the water.
In reality, this is very true. Even if he shared somewhat romantic interest in Sharon, it didn't really feel right. He regrets kissing her; not just because she's the niece of his dead first lover, but because in a way he might have led her on, and that's not who he was. He was a simple guy, born and raised in the 1940s with non-complicated ideologies. He respected anyone and everyone, except bullies, he hated bullies. He didn't care what your race was, your gender, nor your sexuality, to him you were a person. Even if you were a bad guy you were still a person to him, but he would have to apprehend you rather than get to know you because that's his job as a superhero. Actually, that's more of who he is as a person; a law-abiding citizen with no bad bone or dark side.
"Oh, God, Stark they... Whatever those things were, they're out of this world. I... I couldn't stop them, I'm sorry..." She whispered into his ear before the doctors gently pulled her out of his grasp, setting her back down on the stretcher and hooking her up to some IVs. He stood there, watching as Clint fought for his life, and Nat's eyes spoke volumes to how shaken up she was. One thing crossed his mind as he slowly backed out of the room to sit on the chairs, just where exactly is Steve? He needed answers, and the only answers he could get were from the spy twins. He placed his hand in his head, and waited, hoping that they would be ok.
"Harder!" Steve begged. The brunette let out a shaky breath as he heard the soldier beg for him to increase the intensity of his thrusts. He moved closer, body flush against the soldiers, holding his hips and his thrusts got harder, his balls slapping against Steve's ass. He watched Steve reach down and grab himself, jerking himself off in time with Tony's thrust, and it excited him more. He graciously offered his own hand, placing it on top of Steve's as they both jerked him off together. His pace quickened and so did the speed of Steve's hand, the blonde a moaning mess under him. Suddenly, his back arched and he wrapped his legs around Tony's waist, squeezing just hard enough that bruises might be left on him, but he didn't care. Tony smiled wide as he hit Steve's prostate.
." It was the use of his last name, spoken out of anger and disdain that it made his skin crawl, littering it with goosebumps. Tony only ever used his last name when he was either angry with him, or just didn't care to call him by his first name; which by this point he's sure Tony will never call him that ever again. He's lost the privilege of being called Steve.
"Because now I know how you feel when you didn't know whether I was going to come back alive or whether I was going to die. Steve..." He trailed off, he rubbed his face to try and regain some composure before speaking once more. "Steve means a lot to me, and the fact that I don't know whether he's going to come back alive, or he's hurt kills me. I know he has the super-spy twins, Barton and Nat with him, but it's still the thought that I am not there to help him, or prevent anything to happen to him." He looked at Bruce, "you asked me if it was more than just hanging out, and honestly maybe there is something more. We kissed, believe it or not, and he's been a lot happier because of me. He smiles more and feels less lonely, but... But I can't..."
"Steve!" Tony yelled. "Steve, if you can hear me please say something!" It was a long shot, but there had to be a way he could pinpoint a location where he was since the tracks were starting to get covered by snow. It was proving to be useless as there was no sound coming back to him except his own voice. But, then he heard something in the distance. It filled him with hope as he tried to call his name again. "Steve!"
When he arrived, Natasha was already waiting for him outside of HQ. No words were exchanged between them as she led them to the interrogation room. He felt antsy when they stepped into the elevator, and as they were getting closer, he was biting the inside of his cheek to try and calm his nerves. It was funny to him, really. How fast he switched from anger coursing through his veins, significantly prominent to him that he could feel the tips of his ears turn red out of anger, how hot his palms were when his fingertips touched them, and how tight his jaw felt when he clenched it, his teeth hitting each other and making a small, subtle dink sound in his mouth. Now, he was significantly nervous. His eyes were roving around the inside of the elevator, the sound it made as it descended was loud in his ear, he continued to bit the inside of his cheek, almost to the point that if he continued he would break the skin and taste his own blood, his hand felt sweaty, even though they weren't, but he still wiped his palms on his pants. He was swirling with emotions, and he hates it because he's usually got a tight lid on them.
"I lost control of my powers, and I ended up killing everyone inside. It was in the lowest part of the bunker you were in, and from there I escaped. I ran away back to Sokovia and wanted to start a new life."
He descended the steps one at a time, the best he could without stumbling due to his screwy eyesight. He stumbled upon another steel door, only this one was singular and had key code needed for entry. He sighed heavily.
"Oh, fuck. Fuck, fuck, Tony!" He felt the blonde shiver violently, his swears becoming louder and louder, his name being called. He hallowed out his cheeks, sucking hard and drawing more swears and moans of pleasure from Steve's mouth. Before he knew it, another violent shiver coursed through Steve's body, and his mouth was filled with a warm sensation. He happily swallowed the liquid, breathing heavily through his nose as he slowly rose after swallowing all Steve had to offer. He panted heavily, looking at Steve who was also panting heavily, a glazed look in his eyes, mixed with a lazy smile on his face.
"I wo-would l-love tha-that!" And he's so happy that he places one final kiss on the short male's lips before setting him down, inching away slowly as he grabs his plate of food and starts to eat happily.
"Fine." He whispered back, letting his head rest against the cushion and he tried to enjoy watching the movie. However, there was an insatiable urge to at least satiate his curiosity, so he thought why not at least make conversation if the spy twins were going to ruin his super-soldier time. "Did you guys find anything interesting about the strange Hydra agents?"
"Sir, I'm detecting a secret passage to your right," Jarvis said. The hologram disappeared and his hand pressed on a hollow part of the wall, revealing to him a staircase behind the wall. His breath hitched as he slowly walked down the stairs, footsteps echoing around him. When he reached the bottom, he noticed a desk littered with abandoned S.H.I.E.L.D. tech, rows upon rows of old tech taken apart, mixed in with ordinary human technology. His eyes gazed upon the floor stained with water, stained with just a hint of blood to turn it a shade of crimson. His eyes moved onto the lab table, noticing a scalpel coated in fresh blood accompanied by an empty syringe, the sight making his stomach knot. He noticed the chair with restraints tied tightly on the armrests.
"When you get inside the building, do everything you can to make sure it's safe. Once you're done with that, head to the top and we'll meet you there." A quick nod of Tony's head had the Captain leaning forward, placing a gentle, and carefully slow kiss on Tony's lips before he pulled back. "You can do this Tony, I believe in you."
"Holy fuck, Steve," he groaned, lost in pure ecstasy due to Steve's mouth. Steve held down Tony's hips so he wouldn't buck as he went down on him, hallowing his cheeks on the way down, sucking hard enough to draw out loud moans from the genius. Tony arched his back off the bed, letting pleasure take control of his body as Steve's surprisingly experienced mouth drew him closer and closer to the edge. He admits that the guy is a great kisser, despite only having kissed one person, but the fact that he was here, right between Tony's legs, sucking him off expertly as if he's done this before shocked him. "S-Steve wait." He managed to say. The pressure on his cock subsided, and a pop sound could be heard. He looked up, and the sight in front of him made him both blush, and turn him on more.
"I'm always picking up after you boys." She muttered sourly, but there was still a small twitch and the corner of her lips that ensured him she was just teasing. She turned her head and nodded her head towards the glass window where Bucky was. He nodded back and opened the cell door Tony was in, making him turn back around quickly and bring the genius into his loving embrace.
To Tony, Steve's teeth feel like fire against his skin; a hot, blazing fire that sets scorches the area it touches and litters his arms with goosebumps and makes a shiver run down his spine, causing him to arch into the blonde. It doesn't burn him as the super-soldier twists his skin between his teeth, no doubt making a very noticeable hickey, but he doesn't care because it feels
Steve's eyes opened for the second time in the same day. Instead of bright blinding white lights hanging above him, he was met with dense and enormous darkness. It was different; where he could see everything from when he was at S.H.I.E.L.D., which helped him to get a grip on his surroundings, the darkness effectively did the opposite and unnerved him.
He smiled and got off his stool, walking over towards the computers that were located near the couch, just a few feet in front of it. As he sat down in his rolling chair, he clapped his hands and two holographic screens appeared in the air. One screen was a direct communication link to the other's, the other one was of JARVIS hacking into S.H.I.E.L.D. 's files, some smaller screens appearing showing the AI's progress.
"From what we Asgardians know about Axelons, they indeed are a small race of shapeshifting creatures, however, they don't usually work in small groups. Since our new friend Wanda said she only saw three of them, then I fear the rest may be scattered."
"We're ok. Get inside the building, we'll meet you there." The corner of Tony's mouth curved upwards, a smirk plastered on his face.
It's as he walks through the door does the guilt overwhelms him, overflow past his breaking point. It's when he walks over to the seat next to Steve's bed does he start to break down, continuously chanting in his head that it's all his fault and that he should have done more. While the tears flow down his face, he grabs the soldier's hand with both of his and places a kiss on the back of his hand, bringing it up to his forehead so he may rest against it while broken sobs fill the room.
The genius might have been over his head, but if there's anything he's good at besides being himself, it was always doing things in the heat of the moment, and they sometimes tended to work out. He stepped out into the broad daylight, Ross and his guards still there. The smug look on the secretary's face seemed to falter as the brunette came outside without Steve.
So, they stayed there while Natasha dealt with Clint and the rest of the Avengers who filtered into the Compound, making sure they stayed away from the top floor. It was a nice peaceful moment for the couple, and after everything that has happened to them.
"I'm gonna g-get you out of h-here." He said. Tony nodded his head, but then his eyes went wide. He was confused at first, but then he felt the cold barrel end of a gun pressed against his skull.
"Like I said Bruce, perfectly fine. I feel great, actually. Hey, how about you? How are you two doing, let's talk about that shall we?" They stared at him, and it made his skin crawl. It was the kind of skin-crawling experience where you wanted to reach down and just scratch at it until it went away, nails digging into your skin and creating temporary red lines that eventually would fade after a while, as well as the itch. However, for Tony, it was the kind of skin crawl that came with the feeling of alcohol consumption, and as much as he wanted to feel the taste of amber liquid swirling in his mouth, touching his taste buds and sending a shock of joy down his spine, he was trying to fight the urge as best as he could, which was weird. Shit, it must've been Steve that made him want to be a better person.
He felt arms wrap around his waist, causing him to smile as he felt a kiss being placed on the side of his head. It was nice to have this sort of affection around whenever he was down here, whether it be for too long and Steve missed him, or the soldier wanted to sketch him working, or his bots.
He didn't even know the compound had this little room because he's never seen the door before. He turned his head, looking over his shoulder upon picking up the faint humming sound behind him. He saw the door disappear before his eyes as it looked like the wall was sliding over it. Well, that certainly explains why he never noticed it.
"Hey, Tony," Bruce said softly, causing the genius to look at him through teary eyes, "it's not your fault."
A memory of a loved one is always accompanied by the good memories and the painful ones of their death. Emotional scars exceed the visibly physical ones because it's always those who smile the most that are suffering the hardest. He knows this very well because he is one of them. He at least expected the pain to be there for maybe a split second or two, but instead, he felt nothing. He was just numb. Like he couldn't feel anything at all.
"I'm glad you could make it, Mr. Stark. I'm certain you're in the right state of mind before I let you in?" Fury spoke calmly.
A flash of scarlet mist fluttered past his line of sight, and the lab around him faded into black. He knew exactly where he was; it was a nightmare he was so familiar with, one that always recurred and left him gasping for breath, left him sweating in the middle of the night. He let out a shaky breath as he turned around.
He heads back to his room, slamming his door open and then closed. He hates himself for loving someone so much because evidently love hurts you in the end. But he doesn't regret it; doesn't regret loving Peggy, and he most certainly doesn't regret loving Tony, it just hurts too much for him to handle. Realistically he should be fine with it, he's been hurting all his life with every person who hurts him or ends up leaving him, but with Tony he wanted things to be different.
"I know, and I'm sorry for that." He looked her in the eyes and conveyed as much emotion as he could into them. He truly was sorry for putting her through so much of his shit, and he loves her so much more for always putting up with him. He now knows what it feels like to worry about someone, and it's not a good feeling, so she deserves an apology. "I never meant to make you worry about me so much that it caused you pain, but I'm not sorry that my life is this dangerous. I've made many mistakes in my life, but being a superhero is not one of them. But I truly believe you deserve an apology, and a thank you for all you've done for me."
"Stark," his voice boomed from the megaphone, "I know you have Rogers, and I'm going to make this very clear. Either hand him over willingly, or we're going to have to blow apart this little compound of yours till we find him."
He's angry with Tony, but he's angry at himself for believing in the genius that this was something they were going to get through together. He's angry with himself that he thinks that because he's still in love and thinks it's hypocritical of him to be angry with Tony considering he said the same words that he did, and he left him on the cold, hard floor back in Siberia. He's angry that he has no confidence in himself anymore, because what's a leader without his voice or his eyesight to be able to guide his team, let alone have a civil life where he's allowed to relax and draw and speak sweet words into his lover's ear. And yet, he's lost those privileges; he's lost the privilege to see clearly, lost the privilege to speak, lost the privilege to speak to his lover, and it eats away at him every day.
"Yeah, we do." He sighs heavily and looks down for a bit, dreading this conversation. But it was bound to happen sooner or later, and he'd rather get this over with now than deal with it later. "I just want you to know that I understand why you did what you did. Bucky was, well
"Be patient, my dear Captain." He moved his finger slowly at first, enjoying the way Steve's face contorted out of pleasure, the way he bit his lip to suppress his moans, and the way his cock twitched in response to his ministrations. A second finger was added, and then a third. He could feel how Steve's hole was stretching to accommodate his fingers, and he absolutely adored how Steve swore and begged him for more, how there was just a hint of pre-cum slowly dripping down from his tip, and how Steve gripped the sheets and whimpered, wanting to touch himself so badly. It turned him on how Steve reacted to what he was doing, and it only increased his urges to want to just take the Captain right then and there. He took out his fingers, listening to Steve whimper this time at the loss of pleasure before he pressed his tip against his hole, rubbing it up and down ever so slowly to tease not only the blonde but himself as well.
He yelled at himself in his thoughts. He was careful as he put his arms under Steve's legs, the other under the upper part of his back. He lifted him slowly, shivering slightly as he watched the blood drip from Steve's head onto the Quinjets floor. He heard a small groan and saw Steve's eyelids start to flutter. He positioned him in a way that his head was gently resting against the suit's shoulder as he walked out, keeping his eyes on Steve's bloody face while he still tried to open his eyes. He was careful as he stepped out of the jet, taking a few more steps away from the damaged vehicle before he gently knelt, laying Steve's legs onto the solid leafy ground, moving around while he held his head for him to sit down and place it into his lap as his eyes finally opened.
"Secretary Ross." Steve's breath hitch, and looked at Tony in fear. The genius didn't meet his eyes at first, instead, he got off of the stool he sat on, making his way towards the large entrance in the front of the compound.
"I guess while I'm literally tired, your body seems to want to go for round 2; which I'm not opposed to, by the way. Just let me catch my breath first." He looked down and shook his head, his erection already back up thanks to the serum. It was embarrassing, to say the least, but the kiss on his lips that came from his genius told him that Tony didn't mind; and really he didn't mind, because as they shared their intimate moment again, their names being spilled forth out of love from the other's mouth, it wasn't just an act of sexual frustration, nor did it come from wanting to just have sex, no, it was an act of lovemaking, and it was a special night for our two heroes.
"You let yourself get caught so easily. And I'm so disappointed in you." He whispered. The gentle caress of his hand on my cheek soon turned into a vice-like grip on my chin. I couldn't turn away from him, I could only sit there and let my eyes stare into his. "Why were you stupid enough to get caught like that? I thought you were stronger than that."
"Yeah. There's more of him, but I always have a soft spot for Dum-E. He may not be the smartest, but he was my first creation." He watched as the robot settled itself into its charging station, its claw dropping slowly as it powered down and entered sleep mode. He smiled, memories of making Dum-E in his father's workshop coming back, and he kept him all these years. Tony cared for his creations, even if he gave Dum-E a hard time and always threatened to turn him into scrap metal or send him off to a college where they can use him for spare parts, he'd never do that, because he cares about him very much.
When did he ever have the time to tell Tony about his parent's death while he was still trying to clear Bucky's name? Everybody thought it was Bucky who bombed the Conference Hall in the United Nation, but Steve believed otherwise. How could it be that suddenly Bucky would do something like that when he remembered Steve for a fraction of a second? He knew his best friend was in there somewhere, and he wanted to believe that he didn't do this. Of course, he was right, Bucky didn't do it, but while defending his friend he learned dark secrets that he had to keep to himself.
"How do you plan on doing that when you're at gunpoint?" He growled in frustration, realizing the creature was right. He couldn't do anything right now, he was in a life or death situation. "It's funny really, we, or rather
He sits down on the familiar blue cushioned bench he remembers from when Steve first went to his therapy session. He remembers being so proud that Steve was doing this, and he looked so happy when he saw him sitting there waiting for him. It even brought a smile to his own face as he sat there and remembered the days that passed after that one.
"What's gotten into you?" Tony asked, breaking the silence. Steve let out a small laugh, shaking his head against Tony's shoulder before he slowly removed it, looking into his beautiful brown eyes before pecking his lips softly.
"Yeah. I'm fine, thanks." He smiled at her, appreciating the fact she was here to help calm him down. His mind was all over the place, it was a whirlwind of emotions, each trying to scream at him to just reach out and figure out exactly what he was feeling. He felt mentally exhausted, and it must've shown when he looked into this girl's eyes and saw compassion.
He was at his happiest when they were talking, and throughout the week he's noticed Steve has gotten him to get out of his lab just a little bit more often and to sleep a little bit early. However, when there were things he really needed to work on; such as polishing up the final touches on his Iron Man suit, Steve was willing to let him stay awake a few more hours for him to finish it. The blonde was also more than happy to stay up in the late-night hours for Tony as well since their time zones were different. Steve would sometimes call when it was morning for Tony and nighttime for him, and vice versa. Of course, Tony knew the blonde didn't need sleep considering he was a super soldier, although it didn't stop him from also telling the man to sleep as well.
Maybe it started back when he was just a skinny kid in Brooklyn, equipped with Asthma, and a medical list so long telling him what was wrong with him, that this feeling of loneliness started. No, that can't be right either. He wasn't really alone back then; he had his mother, - bless her heart, she was a strong woman and he still remembered all the things she taught him and how hard she worked to make sure he had all the necessities in his life - he had his best friend Bucky, the guy who always saved him from getting his ass handed to him on multiple occasions just because he didn't like bullies, and he had the girl. Peggy Carter was her name. A fine name for a fiery girl such as herself, but he lost all of them when he decided to put that plane in the water.
"I'll make it up to you, just try to relax and enjoy the movie," Steve whispered to him. He turned his head to look at Steve, taking in the way his bright smile reached his eyes seemed to calm down the whirlwind of fury that was close to being spewed in the living room.
"You," Tony said, mirroring his smirk. The soldier blushed more and pulled the genius closer to him, Tony's head resting on his chest. He was careful to not hold his side since he was healing, but that didn't stop him from gently rubbing it up and down, kissing the top of his head as he did so.
"No! No, you didn't say anything wrong it's just... Yesterday was really hard for me, but you're treating me like everything is fine. I don't know if I should say thank you, or be worried. It's all confusing." He admitted. He wasn't planning on telling Tony how he felt, but it was hard to resist. There was this nagging feeling in the back of his mind, screaming at him to voice his thoughts, but he wanted to ignore it. He wanted to ignore how uncomfortable he was that everything seemed normal, even though it isn't.
"It's kinda surreal that after everything that's happened, we've finally gotten down to the root of the issue. I guess it's just some last-minute jitters." He shrugged it off like it was nothing. The soldier simply smiled, nodding his head in understanding.
"From the footage you had me record, if you take that piece of data and put the hologram side by side with the screen on the top right, click on the image in the bottom left, the timestamps are similar." He picked up the hologram and did as his AI instructed.
"Peggy Carter saw something different," Tony said softly. He looked up from his plate and gave a sad smile, nodding his head slowly.
"Six, and they're all suspicious so they might come through that door soon." Friday alerts. He reaches the bottom of the step and swiftly moves towards the door, stopping for a few seconds to take a calming breath.
He stares at the iron bars that go across his cell horizontally past the glass door locking him inside. The cuffs specially designed for him encasing his hands midway up his forearms that cut off his powers so that he couldn't break free, and the electric collar around his neck that hummed so softly, waiting to be activated. Blood trickled down his head from the countless hits he took from the back end of guns, coupled with the bullet holes that haven't healed due to the loss of his powers, his lips cracking and dry, parched from lack of water, and the insatiable gurgling of his stomach from being so hungry. They didn't feed him properly, they didn't give him the water he needed, they just kept hurting him, over and over again, hoping he'd crack. But he never did. He did not shout, nor scream, nor cry, as they kept beating him with their weapons when they shot him in his shoulders, his legs, and even when they kept shocking him with the collar around his neck just for fun to hear him scream out in agony.
The final blow never came, however. Instead, the sound of bodies rolling across the floor was heard. Tony slowly opened his eyes, the sky the first thing he sees once again from his position, the same grey clouds high in the sky which metaphorically felt like his mind; grey and thick with clouds, rolling slowly through the sky- only the sky was his mind, vast and broad, harboring many different things all at once. He groans, willing his limbs to respond to him. The pain is immense as he rolls to the side, setting every damaged nerve into sensory overload as he finds the scepter laying there within arms reach, discarded. He reaches out for it, fingers coming into contact with the metallic object, the light of the mind stone shimmering in his view. He grabs the scepter and slowly turns his head.
So he sits in his room, staring at his lap. He wants to say sorry, he wants to hold Tony close and tell him that he's sorry for pushing him away, sorry for making him sacrifice so much time and space for him. He wants to kiss Tony's lips, feeling those calloused lips on his soft ones, holding him close to his body and he forgets his problems while kissing the man who holds his heart in the palm of his hands, tending to it like a person would a wounded animal. And that's what he feels like right now; a wounded animal who needs to be cared for and nurtured back to help.
It was surreal to think that they've come so far; from practically betraying each other, watching the other die and go through immense pain, to finally getting together and living under the Avengers Compound once more. It was nice to see a familiar place that he's missed more than anything, and he wouldn't be lying if he said he was shocked that the government even let him back on New York soil.
"No, no, I don't mind, it's just... Maybe some other time we can do that. I-If that's ok with you, that is." It was cute the way he worried and stuttered. The genius leaned up and pecked his lips before leaning back once more.
when he wakes up." She sighed and nodded her head solemnly. She turned on her heels and started to exit the room, leaving Steve to his thoughts.
you. I haven't been the best at showing it, and I know I said we'll get through this together and I mean it! I'm not going to do what I've been doing these past five days, I really wanna do this together, I promise."
"That little witch had one job, and it was to make sure the Captain died before we made her work her way into your little crime-fighting group. Instead, she saved him and got away."
But he's too stubborn for his own good, so he just continued to sit there, staring and not even bothering to attempt reconciling the problem he caused. He's too hurt to even think about consoling the man he still has a beating heart for because he's too focused on how hurt he was by his actions.
"How do you know my name?" He watched as she bit her lip and looked away, the telltale sign to him that she knew something about him that she probably was contemplating on sharing. "If it's something bad, believe me, I've heard it all before. Most people refer to me as what they like to call, an asshole." She chuckled in response, shaking her head as she looked back at him.
It was for just this moment that he forgot about all the hate he harbored for this man; this beautiful, blonde, muscular, strong yet so gentle, man he had come to love for the majority of his life. He didn't see the fugitive that had betrayed him, left him to die in a cold, arctic tundra in Siberia, abandoned him for his best friend, he didn't see any of that. He just saw Steve. The man out of time, the guy who time and time again was always there with Tony; holding him close in the night, whispering sweet nothings in his ear after a nightmare, always bringing him coffee, or food in his lab when he forgot. He just saw his super-soldier. He just saw his
"Yeah... So, that's why I also think these files were so encrypted because they weren't supposed to be found until
"I'll be back, and maybe we can have some fun if you know what I mean." Steve winked at Tony, making the brunette blush a little.
If Tony had anything to say, it was lost in his own throat as the elevator doors closed, the super-soldier disappearing from his eyesight. Steve carried his weight over to his door, hand clasping around the doorknob, unwilling to turn the knob to enter his room. His forehead rested against the door, his eyes dead, staring at his feet again. He dropped to his knees, letting go of the doorknob, retracting his head from the door, and leaning it against the wall. It felt hard to breathe as if he was the ninety-pound asthmatic he used to be, but really it felt more like there was ice in his veins, numbing his body until he couldn't feel anything anymore. He didn't bother moving, he didn't bother wiping away the small tears that cascaded down his cheeks, he simply just closed his eyes and sat there, broken, and lonely.

"Yes, you did. According to what you've shared with the rest of us, we know that they disguise themselves as the thing we care about the most, getting inside our head and letting our guard down. When the opportunity presents itself, they attack."
He finally got to Fury's office no a moment later, his hand reaching for the doorknob and finding the door locked.
"Tony, please listen to me." The line was silent, and he took it as his queue to continue. "Both wings are down, and I'm heading towards the ground. I'm sorry, Tony. This is the end of the line for me."
"Nah, I'll get some coffee and just work through the night. That way if you call again I'll still be here."
He felt his actions slowly start to transform into Steve taking control of what he wanted, and Tony was ok with that. He let Steve continue pushing his head up and down in a slow manner, letting the blonde go at his own pace. Tony moved his free handoff of the soldier's thigh, moving downwards. He placed a finger against Steve's entrance, brushing up against it, but as he did, the soldier froze, stiff as aboard. Tony grew concerned and looked up, popping Steve's erection out of his mouth so he could speak.
"Please... I'm sorry, Tony! I'm sorry I'll be better next time!" He swallowed the lump in his throat as he heard the way Steve's voice quivered, the way his body visibly shook as they stared into each other's eyes.
"You know something, Cap," he placed his hand over his arc reactor, a fake pout evident on his face, "that hurts right here." Steve rolled his eyes and continued to stare at the genius, waiting for his answer. "Alright, fine," he said, breaking from his earlier facade, "yes I made reservations here already, and I was going to invite you even if you said no."
A small click was heard behind him and he turned around. His eyes widened as he saw Steve, standing there with his shield, and a gun pointed at him with his lip split, scratches on his throat, clothes ripped, and his bandages bleeding. He raised his hands slowly, an instant reaction from having someone hold a gun at you, his mind bringing back the image of the fake Fury threatening to kill him.
He hasn't felt this weak ever since he was that scrawny kid from Brooklyn who housed an entire medical list of every possible disease, and ailments known to man. How hard it was to be able to be normal and play with other kids without suffering from an Asthma attack, how many times he'd seen white walls of a hospital bed due to catching whatever virus or disease he was unlucky enough to come into contact with.
right in front of him. The shock wore off as quickly as it came because right now, was no time to be thinking too hard about what to say. He just needed to speak, keep him and Steve preoccupied until help arrived. He could do that, he was Tony Stark, talking was his specialty.
He held his hand, thumb brushing over the back of it, silently hoping and praying that he was alright, that he was going to wake up any minute now. The doctors didn't have hope, but he did. They told him that there is a chance that Tony might not make it due to the severity of internal damage he suffered from the scepter, and he was scared that he might end up as Coulson did.
"Not as much as her, but yes I am upset as well. Not much you can do when it seems like you're chasing after a ghost story, and every time you think you've gotten a lead you end up short." Steve sighed, and Tony honestly felt for the guy. It's been pretty hectic for Steve as well, with the suspicious activities of Hydra and the agents they've been apprehending disappearing, mixed in with illegal alien tech, he'd be pretty pissed too.
He made eye contact with the creature, and he could feel all the emotions he was trying to suppress early come crawling back in a tidal wave, but the most obvious one was the anger he felt coming here, bubbling inside of him like water that was being heated to a high temperature, and before he knew it, he reached across the table and punched the alien in the face. He felt hands grab his arms, leading him gently back into the chair as they remained on him, firmly holding him back.
"I spent years hating you, and wishing revenge upon you for what happened to my family, that I myself have made poor choices." She shook her head and wiped her eyes, a sad expression etched into her face. "My brother and I wanted revenge on you that we enlisted the help of Hydra, which is where I got my powers from. They used this thing called the Mind Stone and... Well, I was the lucky one who got my powers while my brother..." She trailed off.
"Ok, this should be simple, right? 'Hey, Cap, I'm sorry about what I said.' No, that won't work, I hurt him badly. 'Hey, I know I said some really horrible things, but I was wondering if you could forgive me.' Fuck, this is harder than I thought it would be." He spent a few minutes going over possible ways he could apologize to his best friend, but time soon ran out as the elevator doors opened, revealing to him the broken, unmoving form of Steve, sitting there in the hallway in front of his door.
He saw the way her lips flattened into a line and the way her shoulders squared, the way her hands clenched her upper arms at his words. It made him flinch a little. If she wasn't already pissed off with him, then he might've made her fuming at this point, she was just doing a very good job at hiding it.
The silence in the room seemed to drag on, minus the heart monitor that was alerting him that Clint was still alive. He sipped his coffee and just stared at the end of Natasha's stretcher, his courage to ask what happened at the bunker slowly fleeting. He needed answers, but was he really about to put stress on Nat to make her remember everything that happened?
When he heard the confirmation from Thor, he continued his flight to the top of the Triskelion, the bright yellow light getting more blinding by the second, until suddenly it diminished in strength. He uprighted himself once he reached the top, cutting his thrusters and landing gently on the roof. He walked slowly, eyes boring holes into the back on the creature that was standing on the roof with him, a staff- no, a scepter, Loki's Scepter, in its hand.
"You're right," he agreed, nodding his head and getting out of his seat, "I'm going to go and talk to Steve right now." They all smiled at him and said their goodbyes, but before Tony completely disappeared, he turned back around and shouted, "thanks for the wonderful meal, Romanoff!"
and make an attempt. He hesitantly opened the book to a fresh new page, and already he started to feel anxious. That stupid milky white spot in his eye that appeared from time to time made the paper look weird, like a weird blurry white blob. Regardless, he brought the pencil tip down onto the paper, slowly drawing the first line. And it was hard to draw anything without focusing on the fact that he can't accurately see what he's drawing, and it frustrated him. The anxiety he felt soon turned into frustration, his eyebrows furrowed with a small crease in between them, and a deep scowl on his face.
"I love you, Steve," Tony said quietly. He looked down at his lover, a smile quick to break out onto his face. He leaned down and gently placed his lips against Tony's, savoring the moment just for a little before he pulled back slowly, keeping his face close to the other males.
"Alright, I'll be right there." Fuck, Tony was so close to seeing all of Steve, but now he had to watch as the soldier pulled up his pants, pulled down his shirt, and clipped his belt back into place, a sour expression splayed on his face that didn't go unnoticed either. "I'm sorry."
"I love you, t-too, T-Tony." He said back, just as quietly. Once more he leans in, brushing their noses together and slowly attaching his lips to his lovers. He walked up the stairs slowly, careful not to jostle the brunette around or to lose his footing.
"Finally putting on the finishing touches for the suit. God, it has been a hectic week for me, but what about you? Get any closer to figuring out the strange Hydra bullshit."
tony to look at him; acknowledge him as the person that he is, rather than the criminal persona that he is making him out to be, because by heart he is not a criminal, he's just a man who tried to do the right thing, but ended up being branded a criminal by the other side. The genius coughed, clearing his throat and biting his lip before speaking.
"I meant the Tower in general, but you're right. We'll fix that later, right now I have other important things to worry about."
It was short-lived, however, once he heard someone coughing behind them. So, he turned and saw the person who he hasn't seen in so long, the person who he's missed more than ever, but at the same time has felt a tad bit angered by. And he doesn't exactly know what to feel in this moment, but for now, he'll just listen to see what the genius has to say.
"Hmm? So you're not here to kill me?" He saw the corner of her lips curve upwards, a glint of a sadistic smile on her face before it disappeared.
"I wish you good luck and a great night, sir." He smiled at his AI's courtesy before removing himself from his lab.
It felt like a journey until the elevator finally released them and his feet carried him towards the room, opening the door and wasting no time to shut it behind him.
"I know that, but I mean I missed you when I was... Ya know." And of course Tony knows what he means, how could he not? He was the one who found Steve practically hanging on to his life by a thread. He won't forget how close he was to losing him, how his head bobbed around as he carried his body. He couldn't, and wouldn't, ever forget that. "I know I'm traumatized, and I'm willing to admit that, but I miss spending moments like this with you. And I'm sorry we can't be as close as we were, I know it must suck."
"Alright you two, let's cut this short. We have a genius, billionaire, ex-playboy, philanthropist to save." Natasha said. He grabbed the doorknob once more, twisting it and pushing the door open, and letting the sunlight over the mountains wash over their bodies.
"You can't accept that." Bruce finished for him. Tony slowly nodded his head and bit his lip, his hands finding their way into his hair, tugging on the messy curls of brown locks. "Why can't you accept that he feels something for you?"
He let out a shaky breath, carefully putting his feet onto this ground. He stood up on wobbly legs, his strength not quite back yet as he fell over-similar to that of a toddler who was trying to take their first steps in life, or maybe someone who didn't have their sea legs and got seasick really easily, or even someone with motion sickness, but either way he laid there on all fours, shifting ever so slightly so he could rest on his ass instead.
"You know she's right, Barton," Tony agreed, "just give me a few more minutes and I can try to get you as much detail on the mission as possible. Not even Fury's encryption can keep me out." The genius smirked to himself.
"Well spit it out! I don't have all day to sit on my ass when I could be trying to find Steve right now."
His eidetic memory always came in hand whenever he drew, always being able to recall everything perfectly. Tony flipped open the book and was met with the usual drawings he saw at the beginning of the book. Flowers; from roses to lilacs, to chrysanthemums and daisies, it was true beauty how detailed every flower was. Flipping through more pages, he remembers the buildings he drew. Avengers Tower, the Shawarma shop they went to after defeating Loki, the Avengers compound, was all magnificent. The best part about the book, in Tony's opinion, was the drawings of him. Steve captured every detail, once again, perfectly; from the way Tony's shirt hugged his torso, showing off his curves, to the way his pants clung to him, showing off his ass, how he always bit his lip when he was concentrating really hard on a project, and even small moments in the lab where he slept on the couch, hung out with DUM-E, and even moments where Steve was involved, whether it was cuddling in his bed, watching movies together, you name it, it was within this book.
"Wow, you learn something new every day," Bruce said, earning him a playful shove from the genius. It was times like this where Tony appreciated the Avengers, who he happily calls his family. Yes, they were family to him; he doesn't actually know when he considered them that, but it's nice to know that they were always there for each other. Sure they may argue, bicker, have disagreements, but they cared about each other and always helped each other when they needed it. It was touching to see how close they got, and Tony cherishes them all, but they didn't need to know that.
"I'm sorry..." The words caught him off guard because he did not expect Steve to say that while he is
"Steve, no! We can figure something out, I can get there fast if I put everything into my thrusters."
I wanted to ask you guys something important. Would you rather I: Upload the rest of the chapters so that way you can read the entirety of this story at your own pace up until the end- meaning, just upload the other nine chapters. Or: would you rather I keep the uploads as they are now- meaning, just upload the next chapter as I see fit, rather than posting all the chapters. Which would you guys rather have? Would you like me to keep it as if where I upload whenever I see fit that I should publish the next chapter, meaning you guys get to see it unfold. Or would you rather just be handed all the chapters?
"It's not your fault that the villains we fight can't stop being assholes for a few god damn minutes, to let us enjoy some quality time alone." His mood softened a little as he heard the light chuckle out of Steve's mouth, followed by the heartwarming smile he got used to seeing recently.
He knows while his life is full of danger, what with being a superhero and all, but for once life can feel normal for him. He has a sense of place and purpose, and it's all because Tony gave him the second chance to prove himself and didn't turn his back on him a second time. He had all right to leave him there at the Raft, and yet he chose to stick with him until the end. He's thankful for the genius, and by God will he show how thankful he is every day he's with the beautiful man he gets to call his.
"You thought what you wanted was revenge, so when you seized the opportunity, you took it. I understand where the anger came from, and trust me it makes me sick to my stomach to know what you did to him. But the fact you came back, to save someone so close to me, proves that you have a heart and that revenge wasn't the answer. You saved his life, and that's all I care about."
"Glad to hear that, these are the best burgers this side of New York. It's good to have you back, sugar bear."
It doesn't really matter anymore, because all his actions have already set him up for the consequences that he's facing right now, and if pain is the only way to try and make things right between Tony and him, then he's willing to endure it all to try and fix this thing between them. He knows Tony is hurting deep down, because while Tony had put on his metaphorical mask again-the one he originally wore to keep others from knowing the real him, to keep others from hurting him and breaking down his walls, Steve could always see past that.
and whenever he's around him, his heart threatens to burst out of his chest with how fast it beats around this man.
"Hurry back, I'm already missing those super-soldier lips against mine." Steve snorted in response and promptly left the room. Tony laid back on the bed and sighed, staring up at the ceiling.
He locked himself away in his lab, forgetting the necessities of life; food, water, sleep, all three foreign concepts to him that he couldn't quite grasp as he spent day after day working on upgrades for his suit and the other Avengers. He wasn't willing to admit that he missed the days when Pepper would drag him out of his lab and force him to drink something other than coffee, or go to sleep, or even eat, because it was so much easier to stay in his safe space, surrounded by his creations that wouldn't harm him, and in a way understood him. They wouldn't judge what he was doing; and even if Jarvis on occasions did scold him and suggest that he should step out of the lab, the AI at least made sure he was in good health, and if things got bad the other Avengers would be notified.
"Quite powerful isn't it?" Fake Steve whispered into his ear. With quick, sudden movement, the spear was yanked out, and Tony was tossed onto the side. He groaned in pain, a shaky hand moving towards his abdomen area where his suit was pierced. Blood started flowing out of him, staining the rooftop and the area around him, his blood pooling around him. His breathing was labored, his vision was partially going blurry, he was trying to hold on until the mission was done, but he was slowly losing the fight. Strained sounds made their way past his throat once more as he moved, every nerve in his body telling him to stop moving.
The doors open for the last time, and he's being pulled once more by the soldier out of the elevator. His feet press against the cool wooden flooring, which soon turns into marble titles and he knows since he's the one who built this place alongside Pepper, that they're on the rooftop. He feels Steve let go of his hand, and so he patiently waits for his queue to open his eyes.
Waking up with blurry vision was pretty overwhelming for him, as one half of the room, while he was laying sideways, was completely in focus, while the other half was just blobs and specs, unrecognizable. He looked at the door and just hoped that Tony would come through any second, but as time slowly passed, it was clear that wasn't going to be the case any time soon. And it's just this moment that makes him wish he was back at the compound with the genius because back then, Tony would always come to his room and get him for breakfast.
"Why were you back at the bunker? Surely if you wanted a new life you wouldn't go back to the place that ruined your life."
Natasha, Clint, and Steve nodded to each other, exploring the interior of the bunker. It was old and worn down, cobwebs literally the expanse of the walls, moldy walls with chipped paint crossing their eyesight as they moved down every corridor, doors creaking under the weight of finally being used, it was like an old facility that Hydra used back in the day, or rather, they stopped using it. As they got further into the bunker, they decided to cover more ground by splitting up.
"It's fine. Whatever these things are, they need to be stopped. And we need to get Cap back, the team that brought me and Clint didn't bring him back, so it's safe to assume that he was captured. Or worse..." She whispered the last part.
He sat up, groaning just a little as he still felt slightly weak. It was a similar situation just like when he woke up, only different. He remembers hearing the radio going on in the background, playing a Dodgers game from May, in the year 1941, and how easy it was to recognize that something seemed wrong from that mere object alone. And now, once again, he finds himself in a weird place, but he can't really confirm if it's a room or a prison cell since he can barely make anything out other than the bed, but he does seem to notice that the room seems pretty small.
"Your room is more home for me, but we still need to get that fixed after the... Incident." Steve spoke, blushing.
He let out a huff of breath and looked at the Black Widow, who simply rolled her eyes at him when she saw the smile on his face.
While this story has already been finished on my Wattpad, I am still posting this chapter on Tony Stark's birthday! So, happy birthday to Tony Stark, a wonderful character that many people can either relate to, learn from and hold a special place in their heart.
It hurt, and why would it not hurt? He loved the way his hand fit perfectly at the small of her back, guiding her around the Galas they went to, making sure she was with him for the majority of the event, scared to let her out of his sight in fear that he might lose her to someone better than he was. Truthfully he always thought Pepper could do better, but he kept her for as long as he could, selfishly keeping her all to himself like a rare, precious diamond. She was his diamond; perfectly polished, bright, and overall beautiful to look at, stunning, absolutely beautiful. He was in love with her, and he never really got over her after they broke up.
"Something smells good, besides you, of course." He froze in place as the voice of his genius was heard behind him. A small surge of heat pooled at his cheeks, embarrassment washing over him. He turned around to look at the genius, who looked absolutely stunning in his attire.
It was the way he said his name that made him falter. It sounded like he was pleading, but it was so soft that it was more so of a whimper. He didn't care though, because his heart was already aching, and his feet were already moving towards him. He knelt, and once more found himself looking at how pale and pained Steve looked, how his forehead started to break out into a small sweat. He couldn't sit there and do nothing this time. He wasn't going to act as if this was ok, because it's not. So, he acted with his heart rather than his mind.
"Not a clue," Clint answered. "We're not particularly sure where they're going, or where they are, so it's kinda impossible to make a plan." Steve sighed and turned his attention to Thor and Wanda.
"Mr. Stark." Fury's voice boomed, a hint of warning laced within his words. "Need I remind you why you are here?" Tony scoffed in response.
"I love you, Anthony." The special nickname that only Steve was allowed to call him just made his heart metaphorically flutter, widening his smile just enough that if he kept this facial expression for too long, his cheeks would start to hurt.
"Wanda Maximoff, it's nice to meet you, Mr. Stark." He looked at her and furrowed his eyebrows, a crease forming between them.
that Steve wanted to ask? There were too many why's to ask: why am I here, why aren't I dead, why did you save me, and so many more options to choose from, but all of them seemed redundant. He didn't know what he wanted to ask, so he simply just didn't respond. How could he respond, when he wasn't even sure just how deep Tony's question went, considering the genius might be asking his own form of "why did you's" in his own head.
"I'm saying maybe they weren't human. What if they were something else disguised as Hydra agents, the weapons were modified, and humans just don't disappear like that." Steve had a really good point.
"A little," Steve walked over to Tony and stood between his legs, leaning down to peck his lips before speaking again, "but the present has you in it. That's what really matters."
Unlike last time as well, where he saw Tony's back as he tried to retreat to his lab, this time around there were two plates on the island. The day just kept getting better and better for him. He ate in silence with Tony, but it wasn't uncomfortable silence, it was actually quite comfortable. Tony kept that small distance between them, but he just looked so comfortable next to his side, it was wonderful. He sent small smiles in Steve's direction, which he happily returned, chuckling a little to himself.
Realistically he never stopped loving Steve, but it was easier to put up all the walls he built and the mask over his face, replacing any feeling of love he had for this man with hatred; pure, righteous, roaring flame-like hatred that coursed so heavily in his veins. But he never killed that emotion completely, it was just hiding away deep down in his bruised heart, crying for attention like a lost puppy, or a child needing attention and someone to care for it. The love was still there, it was just smothered by the hatred.
He watched as the scalpel made contact with his skin, cutting him open, creating a crevice in his chest where he could see a hemostat making its way inside of him. He shuddered, which only grew in size as he started to watch himself convulse, heard himself scream, watched these people put their arms on him to hold him down as he thrashed about, prodded at him, and felt around inside his thoracic cavity, feeling every ounce of pain he knew he was in. He closed his eyes, not wanting to look anymore, and then suddenly the screaming stopped.
Steve's words seem to have effectively caused the genius to properly digest this bit of information. It never really occurred to him that this wasn't the only time Steve has had nightmares before, he actually thought that this was the first time. As someone who constantly is in his lab, ignoring the necessities of day-to-day life such as food and water, only occasionally leaving the lab for coffee before continuing his 72 hours of no sleep, he knows what nightmares can do to people. He's had nightmares ever since he put that nuke into outer space, but this wasn't him they were talking about. This was Steve. Pure, innocent, 1940's, selfless, Steve Rogers.
"Since when did you learn how to cook?" He stabbed his eggs with his fork, bringing the bits of food to his mouth. He stopped chewing for a second and just savored the taste of the eggs. They were so fluffy, such an amazing texture that caused his mouth to water as he continued to chew, his eyelids fluttered and he let out a satisfying moan. "Holy fuck, this is amazing!"
"Bye, Tony." The hologram miniaturized as the call ended, the genius letting out a small sigh, the tightness in his pants thankfully subsiding.
"Do we have any idea where Steve might even be? We cannot waste any more time, we need to find him now before something happens."
"How do I know that!? How do I know you're not one of the things that just attacked me not too long ago pretending to be him again?"
"I'll explain on the way there. Right now, Nat and Clint, I need you two to get the Quinjet ready for take-off. Once everybody is on and we're in the air, I'll explain the plan." The spies nodded their heads. "Alright Avengers, assemble." With that, they all left the common area. Well, everybody except for Tony. He sighed to himself and turned around to look out of the window which gave him a great view of all of Manhattan. "Tony?"
"As you already know I wasn't always like this," he stopped briefly as their food was placed in front of them, thanking the waitress before continuing again when she left, "I was the scrawny kid from Brooklyn who always got beat up because he didn't like bullies. I didn't care that they were bigger than me, I knew they could kick my ass, but it didn't matter." He took a small bite of his food, savoring the taste before continuing once more. "My mom was always making sure I had everything. Sacrificed her food so that I wouldn't go hungry, putting herself before me. Taught me how to appreciate the little things."
"You really mean that?" Oh shit, did he just say that out loud? "Yes, yes you did." Fuck, he didn't mean to, but oh whale the cat was out of the bag. He waited for Steve to stop his fit of laughter before he spoke.
"Your wish is my command, Captain." He whispered seductively, climbing down off of Steve and leading him to the bed. The soldier sat down on the edge of the bed, watching as Tony's hands fumbled with his belt, successfully unbuckling it and working on the button in the front. It was a sight to watch as skilled hands who have probably done this many times pulled down his zipper, watching as the hunger and lust in Tony's eyes grew more as he continued to explore the barriers between Tony's hands and the soldier's erection. It excited Steve that Tony was all his, and that his old playboy ways were no more, that he would only be doing this with him. It made him smile, but soon that smile turned into a gasp of pleasure as he felt a wet feeling along the underside of his shaft.
He was in a weird spot; not weird in the sense that he was uncomfortable in his current position but weird in the sense that usually he was the one to leave the other before they woke up. This was ironic cause nowadays, Tony never would get up early due to always spending time in his lab. Guess he was more tired than he thought he was, but that's what 3 days of no sleep will do to you before you decide you want to hang out with a super soldier and
"I love you, Steve." And it was those four words he spoke, and nothing more did he cry into the other male's chest, letting himself be comforted. He didn't need the brunette to speak anything else, because despite how cold he's been, he still loves him through it all. And he allows himself to be comforted because he needs it, and he allows himself to feel loved because he misses his genius. He knows that right now things are going to be ok, but tomorrow is a different story. Right now, he doesn't want to be cold and distant, he wants to be warm and close.
"You and I both know that you're weak, and it's because you're in love with me isn't it?" I didn't answer him, I refused to. He never made me feel weak, he always made me feel strong. The things I can do are because Tony has impacted my life greatly, I feel like he always makes me feel like I can do anything. I hissed and struggled as I felt a sudden pain in my abdomen area. I could feel my skin tear, the grip on my face getting tighter, his breath hot against my ear. "Say you're weak. If you love me, tell me you're weak and I'll stop." I forced myself to tolerate the pain, I wasn't going to admit to something I wasn't. I gasped as I felt nails dig in deeper, and I cried out when he let go of my face and dug his finger into the wound on my shoulder, forcing me to comply.
To him, it was a big surprise, really. It's been a few months since the Loki incident, and in those few months of staying up all night in the lab, there was always this soft spot he had for the blonde. Whether he chose to act on them, or ignore them, was entirely up to him. He didn't wanna jeopardize whatever he and Steve were, considering that he most likely wasn't ready to act on whatever he was feeling after the whole Pepper fiasco, but at the very least he could keep this warmth to himself for the time being. Just being friends with Steve was enough.
The first thing he wanted to do was obviously to go on that date with him. He wanted his normal life back, not this one he has now where he's a wanted fugitive to some, mainly Ross, in New York. That's his home- well, in actuality it's the place that harbors his home back at the Avengers Compound. He wants to be able to wake up back at the compound and see his family getting up for breakfast in the morning, watching Tony be the one to always walk in last because he was tired from staying in his lab for consecutive nights. He wants to wake up in bed once more next to Tony because he had a nightmare and needed comfort, or simply because the genius wanted to spend time with him. He wants to just be at home and know that everything is going to be alright and that at least he's in a familiar environment.
He did everything he could try and lose the enemy behind him, working with the damaged Quinjet as much as he could. For a second he thought he was going to be okay, that he could do this because his motto was: "I can do this all day." And he believed that he was going to make it out of this, but it all went downhill as the second wing broke off, damaged by one of the missiles that got lucky enough to hit its mark.
It shouldn't have affected him, but just hearing it once more after so long of the genius not calling him that brought back everything. It was morbid, in a way. It was like his own form of torture, and once again the serum could do nothing to heal his broken heart, nor his broken mind. It couldn't take away the tear sliding down his cheek, dripping down onto the white floor he sat on, and it couldn't stop the memories from overloading his brain.
It was very confusing for Tony, to say the least. He was confused as to why Steve might think that he's not loving him. He's told the man he loves him, has come to grips that he finally loves someone after the whole Pepper fiasco, and he's even showing it. But why would Steve think anything different?
"Now that's where this whole thing gets complicated," Clint groaned as he sat up into a sitting position, "we went on that first mission which was simple reconnaissance, a mission given to us by the Director himself. We were then ordered to apprehend any Hydra agents we found, but when we did we found more than what we wanted. We found out they were using S.H.I.E.L.D. tech spruced up with their own alien technology, and then they disappeared out of nowhere." His eyes locked onto Fury, gaze cold and unwavering. "Then all of sudden, we get this mission out of nowhere, as if suddenly Hydra has been on the move again. The funny thing is that you didn't give us your usual information; ya know, the usual talk about how there was suspicious activity. Instead, it was a specified location you gave us as if you instantly knew they were there." His gaze turned to Tony standing next to him before looking at Fury once more. "Then Stark can't crack the encryption that's keeping the mission data classified, which, frankly, Director, you and I both know that Stark can easily crack any firewalls you put up, but this one was too complicated for him to get on the first try. So, it leads me to wonder if you're actually Fury, or you're just one of those things that attacked us."
"Ok, so hear me out," Tony said, slightly out of breath and holding up his phone with all the data present, "you issued the first mission right, officially?"
"Why?" He interrupted, causing Tony to pause in front of the metal door, back turned towards him. He rolled his shoulders, standing up more straight.
"No, no Steve," Tony said, getting off of his stool and slowly walking towards the super soldier, "that's not true, you're not weak at all. You're so strong Steve, stronger than me that's for sure." He stopped his advancement when the soldier finally turned his gaze onto the genius, scared and hurt blue eyes staring into sad brown ones. Tony so badly wanted to just reach out and draw the taller male into his arms, but he held back, not trusting himself that the action would do anything other than hurt him.
"Aye aye, Captain." He started up his thrusters and ascended into the air. His flight was clumsy, occasionally he had stutters in his flight and he would have to readjust the balance onto his other side as best as he could. "Hey, Thor."
What exactly would he do if he never got to see Steve again? Well, for starters he'd go crazy. He'd blame himself for not being able to be there to make sure Steve was alright, was that a little clingy? Hell if he would know, it probably was, but can you really blame him? He would most definitely lock himself away from the outside world, doing whatever he could put his mind to, to distract him. But he couldn't distract himself from that because Steve would always be on his mind, even after he's gone. Fuck he's digging a hole for himself the more he keeps thinking about this. Steve is fine, he has Natasha and Clint with him, nothing can go wrong.
"I swear to God, Fury, if you ask us if we can get in contact with Heimdall, I'm going to strangle you," Tony said when Fury opened his mouth. The spy rolled his eye and opened his mouth to speak again.
As he turned his head to face forward again, he couldn't help but notice Tony out of his peripheral. He could see how the geniuses shoulders were squared, one hand covering his left side, and he noticed the distance that Tony put between them, and how he seemed to slightly curl inward on himself. It was like he wanted to put as much space between them as humanly possible in this situation, and once again Steve cannot blame him, but it doesn't mean he accepts what Tony is doing, because it's so uncharacteristic of Tony. Then again, pain and suffering do change a person- and it's not a good change, much like how a caterpillar enters its chrysalis and emerges as a beautiful butterfly, because as beautiful as Tony is to Steve, he's more comparable to a bird whose wings were clipped. He soared above everybody else, high in the sky, enjoying his time in the sky only for someone to fuck up the wings he soared with, making him crash and burn.
"I l-love y-you t-too, T-Tony." And once again those words hold a powerful meaning over the genius, that this time he doesn't leave during the night. This time he stays throughout the night, snuggled up close against the soldier's body as he holds him close, feeling his hot, steady breath against his ear, and the steady rise and fall of his chest. And for Tony, well, he's right where he should've been. He's right where he's always wanted to be
"Oh God, T-Tony." He stuttered quietly, kneeling and sitting on his knees once he was directly in front of the genius. He could visibly see the shock collar around his neck that he remembers wearing when he was brought here, and he could only imagine what horrors Tony had to go through. He also noticed that the genius's hands were not visible, hidden away under his armpits. "W-what did he d-do to y-you?" A simple question had caused the genius to let out a loud, strangled sob that caused a surge of pain to go through the soldier's own heart.
The first instance wasn't really his fault. He made his decision, and in the end, he saved countless lives, including his first love; which died just a few months after this whole shit show happened. Ok, maybe his heart broke three times, because he lost her once, and then lost her again. He actually never suspected seeing her again after he put the plane in the water, he just expected he would have died from the impact itself, but alas that was not his destiny.
Once he felt like he enjoyed the look of the world upside down, he righted himself and activated his thrusters, accelerating himself towards his destination.
be allowed to relax and enjoy themselves, but it's quite rare that times like this happen. For the Avengers, it's completely rare. For Tony, these moments spell nothing but trouble; because the whole situation he and Steve went through, as well as the other's, began simply as nothing but a normal day in their hectic lives.
"See something you like?" Steve asked. Tony nodded his head slowly, watching the way Steve stood up off the bed, his fingers dipping into his pants and pulling them down. His boxers soon followed, and he was mesmerized by the sight of Steve naked in front of him. As Steve laid down next to Tony, the genius crawled on top of him, littering his body with kisses on the way down.
"Yeah. Well, I've fallen from the sky before, and believe me when I say it's going to take more than that to take me out of commission." He retorted. The creature slowly turned around, showing its face to the genius, who in return, sneered. "You're a lot uglier than those other guys, so I'm guessing you're the leader."
"That's not my name, but I'm glad you liked the kiss." A hearty laugh erupted from his chest, transferring itself to Tony as he, too, laughed in response. "This isn't weird for you, is it? Considering..."
"JARVIS had to help me with that one. Took a while to figure out the coffee maker since it wasn't my order, but I'm glad I got it right."
"If they take you out, man of Iron, then we lose our intellect. You're the smartest out of all of us when it comes to these types of things, Fury has told me all the data you've collected, and it proves that you know too much."
He was a human just like everyone else, regardless of his enhanced body, he was still flesh and bones, muscles and cartilage, organs and tissues. It didn't take away from the fact that he was still a man; a man who could still get hurt, who could still experience trauma. The serum can't fix emotional, nor psychological damage, it can only fix the physical. It heals bullet wounds, bruises, gashes, all of it regardless of it takes its time. A broken heart, shattered or manipulated mind, emotional stress? The serum can't fix that, only time can.
He tried to go to the gym to blow off some steam, just like he used to when he first got here. And it was a bad idea, to say the least. Each punch he tried to give to the bag, ended up with him missing and striking the air in front of it instead. For anybody who didn't know about his condition, they would laugh at him, thinking it was funny. To him, it wasn't funny in the slightest, it was torture, it was agonizing, every second he spent not being able to see, not being able to talk properly, added to the self-hatred brewing inside of him.
"What if you get inside my head, and show Cap what I'm most terrified of. I'm sure if he sees how much I truly care about him, how scared I am of losing him, that he might be willing to at least see me eye to eye and work on this instead of avoiding me." Wanda nodded her head slowly, taking in every word he said. It made sense really; when she brought forth Steve's fear of him being weak, they were suppressed memories, things he didn't want himself or anybody else to see. Of course, they didn't include Tony, because she made him relive memories, she didn't alter his mind in any way, she simply pulled forth things already stored in his brain. If she were to use her powers to make Steve see into the mind of Tony and what he was scared of, then it might just get him to open up a little.
be doing. The mission that Steve and the spy twins went on, definitely falls under his "shouldn't have done it in the first place" list.
"It's not that I don't wanna hear it," he sighed loudly, "it's just I don't want to hurt Steve. I don't want to force anything onto him. That's not what our relationship is based on; it's based on communication, trust, love, and I want him to remember that I share these things with him. I want to earn Steve's trust so that I can be there for him. I don't want to do anything he isn't comfortable with, because that's not love."
He was ok with waiting patiently because, in the end, it would be worth it. He knew Tony was going to be ok, and after everything that has happened to them, they were stronger than ever. He knows that the bond they have, and the relationship they have formed grew over the course of what has happened around them. He's content knowing that if his life is ever in danger, that he can trust Tony with his life because once again he has proven that the soldier is what's important to him. And he would do the same thing as well because Tony is his top priority. He's the love of his life and he's going to keep him around until the end of the line.
"I think you made Stark a little upset, Clint." Ah yes, whenever Clint was Natasha was close behind. Tony watched as she took her spot next to Clint, sitting next to him and elevating her feet on his lap, turning her head towards the movie, a small smirk on her face as well.
"Because I'm not ready for him to see how fucked up I am, ok?" He sighed again and let his shoulders slump, a wave of tiredness washing over him. "I don't want him to leave, and if I tell him all about my daddy issues, then maybe he'll think I'm just saying bad things about his friend and we'll start an argument and we'll say more shit we don't mean and I... I just don't want the helicarrier incident to happen again." Her face softened, her arms uncrossed and she walked over to him, placing a hand on his shoulder.
He watched Steve hesitate, the gun in his hand shaking just a little bit. He watched Steve's face, the serious expression crumbling into one full of relief, the gun and his shield dropping onto the floor as he moved towards Tony, picking him up and wrapping his arms around him, resting his head into his chest as he sobbed.
There was a roar in the distance, and before I knew it I was on a train. It seemed like a normal cargo train by the looks of it, but I knew better than that. I knew what this was, and I hesitated to turn around as I picked up the faint sound of shouting. My hands shook, and with some ounce of courage, I turned my body around.
For himself, love is the driving force he has for Tony that will either kill him in the end, or help him renew what he so desperately wanted from the genius; a blossoming, healthy relationship, where he could hold, and tell Tony he loved him on a day to day basis. And it was his love for Tony that kept him from screaming in agony as the collar's intensity rose, and the grip on his hair tightened.
The walk towards the Wakandan facility was just as long as he remembers it, and it actually was quite amusing to him hearing Tony complain about how tedious and exhausting it was, and why the agents who flew them here didn't just land closer. Which actually was a good question and would have been a lot easier. Regardless, they made it to their destination. It was T'Challa who greeted them, as per usual of the king of Wakanda; always so humble and kind, spoke with true kingly ship and modesty, as well as understanding. He was glad to know T'Challa and was glad the king assured him that the therapy would be of great help to him.
He thinks that maybe he hallucinated and that he dreamed of Tony once again. Because not only was the bed empty just like the first time but there was also nothing but the sketchbook on the dresser. He sighs heavily and moves the pillow that is comforting his head towards his chest, clutching it firmly as if it was Tony. He doesn't know what to think at this point. If he is dreaming, then the dreams are way too real and it's more like he's being tortured, which a dream isn't supposed to do because that's a nightmare. Dreams are like feathers; soft and gentle, nothing more than a simple way to send a tickle to the brain that leaves the body relaxed and tingly. On the other side of the spectrum, dreams can be the ocean, or maybe even a flower; beautiful when gazed upon much like a flower is to the trained eye, but submerged within the depths of the dream, much like the ocean, is a hidden meaning into the dream, and while the depths of the ocean may be black, and harbor deadly creatures, when a dream is compared to the depths of the ocean does not mean the dream itself is ugly, but that one has to look deeper into the dream. And while, yes, the deep black bottom of the ocean may be scary to some, realistically there is an unexplained beauty in the unknown.
"To change the accords, we thought it would be best to appeal to the people who still consider you and the rest of the Avengers as heroes rather than vigilantes. To do that, we needed the footage of your imprisonment, as well as a digital copy of the accords and on Secretary Ross himself. So, we made a plan to send him to the Raft."
"I took her to the gym after that creature came in here pretending to be you. And I... Oh God, Tony I
Tony's slumber was disturbed by a buzzing sound somewhere in the room. He tried to ignore it, snuggling closer into Steve, hand wrapped around his waist, cheek pressing up against the top of his head. The buzzing got more prominent, and he grumbled in response, turning away from Steve ever so slightly, opening his eyes just enough to form a glare. The source of the irritable buzzing sound that rudely woke him up from his peaceful slumber next to his super-soldier, came in the form of none other than his Stark phone. He ever so gently, ever so quietly as to not wake up Steve, moved off of the bed, and trekked over towards his pants, fishing out his phone from his pocket.
"So, this is what these bastards really look like?" Fury said. It took some willpower from Tony to cast his eyes at the man standing in the doorway, agents coming over to look at the commotion in the room. "Alright, don't act like you haven't seen a dead extraterrestrial body before. Pick it up and bring it to the science lab." He watched as the agents carried the dead creature out of the room, the sound of Fury's boots loud in his ear as he, too, walked away.
He wasted no time entering the tower, wishing the damn elevator would hurry the fuck up and just get him to his room. Eventually, the doors opened to his floor, and he was already running to his room. His footsteps slowed until he came to a complete stop. He was frozen in place, his eyes noticing how the door to his room was cracked and bent in half in front of where it used to be on its hinges. He dared to step closer, wanting to see what the inside was like. His breath hitched and he swallowed the lump in his throat as he looked at the mess around him. Glass was shattered on the floor, curtains ripped, the bed flipped over and resting halfway inside of his closet, the drawer was broken, wood mixing with the glass and the contents of the drawer laying on the floor. Holes tattered the walls, some mere dents, and the other's actual gaping holes. It was a sight for sore eyes, to say the least. But there was no Steve anywhere to be seen. Terror soon turned into panic, his heartbeat picked up in speed as he slowly exited the room.
"Don't get me wrong, I loved Pepper, still do, but things didn't work out between us. I miss her greatly, but I know I'm not the guy she needs, my life is too dangerous, mixed in with the fact that I am an alcoholic with daddy issues, PTSD, and tons of emotional baggage. I'm a mess, let's just put it at that."
"I want to accept I feel something for Steve, I do accept that I feel something for him. But what if I hurt him again? How can I live with myself if I hurt him when I just wanna make him happy?"
"A nice homemade dinner, just the two of us. Clint and Nat are at S.H.I.E.L.D. right now, and Bruce won't bother us. So what do you say?" Tony inhaled a shaky breath, his body reacting to the way Steve's fingers left a blazing trail across his hips, the front of his jeans starting to get a little uncomfortable.
He nodded and moved over towards the door, holding it open but not walking through it just yet. He looked over his shoulder and asked: "h-how do you feel being b-back in the compound?" And she only shrugged in response, but she didn't need to say anything for him to already know what she wanted to say. She just smiled, and it was the look in her eyes that told him everything he needed to know. It was the type of connection they had, where they didn't need to say much to convey how the other was feeling. So, he nodded his head and gave one last smile and said: "feels like home to met-too", before he finally walked out of his room and closed the door.
He first noticed that the scene around him was different, he was by himself and was no longer on the roof of the Triskelion. The second thing he noticed was that he didn't have his armor. The last thing he noticed was the area he was in was dim, barely lit except for the lights that shone above his head. His breath hitched and a lump formed in his throat when he realized where he was.
"So, you're telling me these guys are like mini assassins? If their job is to eliminate potential threats, why are they only keeping Steve captured? Why are Nat and Clint still here? No offense guys, but if the Avengers pose a threat to them, then why just Steve?" Tony inquired.
"I think I can trust him." Eyes turned to look at him, he swallowed the lump in his throat as he looked at the disbelief registered on Clint's face.
"I'm here, Tony!" He replied, a small chuckle and a breath of relief making their way past his lips and out of his mouth. He leans his head back again, wearing one of the biggest smiles on his face, showing off his perfect white teeth, making the ends of his lips curved as upwards as they could go without hurting him.
"Well, think about it, if the mission details are hard for even Iron Man and his AI to crack the encryption, then something must be wrong here and we've walked into a trap. Doesn't that seem suspicious to you, Cap?" In reality, Clint was right, this did seem very suspicious. It felt like they were being led into a trap, considering that throughout the week's Fury hasn't given them any form of update on Hydra since the first time they've apprehended them, something must be going on.
He taught himself how to be strong; because all his life that's what he needed to do. He needed to be strong when he lost Bucky, or when he had to put the plane in the water. He had to be strong when Tony risked his life to put that nuke into the wormhole, or when Peggy died. He had to be strong when Tony betrayed him, basically leaving him to die at the hands of Ross. For lack of a better term, it was fucked up.
"No kidding, huh?" He chuckled softly to himself, nodding his head and taking up her offer to get some liquid in his system. The walk itself was quiet, besides the sounds of their footsteps against the marble flooring and the voices of the other agents, but the silence between them was welcoming.
He scowled as he thought. He tried to occupy his mind on anything that wasn't Tony, but that was the only thing he could think of at the moment. It wasn't just on where said male could be, but it was happier thoughts too.
"-Eve?" It's static at first, but it makes him jump in his seat, his heart almost beating out of his chest. "Steve?" It comes out more clearly this time, and it causes him to smile.
"That would be correct." The thing in front of Tony was just like all the others, except this one, who wore a skull mask over its face, covering everything except its eyes and its mouth. Where all the Axelons had simple black eyes, this one's right eye was pure white, and Tony could make out the small wrinkles on its face. Needless to say, he was disturbed and disgusting, and it seemed to pick up on this fact. "Oh I'm sorry, maybe you'd prefer a more suitable appearance. Where are my manners?" The creature grinned at him before taking in a deep breath, a small white light temporarily blinding Tony, causing him to look away. The light dimmed down, and once he looked back, his eyes widened.
"As good as I'll ever be. Got any ideas on how we're gonna stop these things?" Steve questioned, looking at her.
"No." The words flew out of his mouth faster than a bullet. The super soldier furrowed his eyebrows, a crease forming between them, and a small frown on his face.
"Uh... I made us dinner. But it's not anything fancy. I'm sorry if it's terrible, I should've made something different. I-"
He kissed the top of Tony's head as the lights in the lab shut off, the glow of the Arc Reactor being the only light source between them. Steve smiled down as Tony's eyes closed and he started to fall asleep. The soldier placed one last kiss to Tony's lips before he, too, started to close his eyes, and drift off to peaceful slumber with a smile on his face, and his favorite genius next to him.
And there's a loud piercing sound in his own ears, and it takes him a minute to realize that it's him, yelling out in anguish as he drops to his knees, fresh tears fastly overflowing from his tear ducts, cascading downwards to kiss his cheeks as they leave ghostly trails. The love of his life, the man he's always cared for so deeply, and the man he always held a special place for in his heart, was lying dead on the floor, blood pooling around his blonde hair, his once vibrant blue eyes now faded, and a gun resting limply in his hand. He also took notice of his sketchbook turned upside down next to his abdomen. He picked it up slowly, turning it over, and letting out a strangled sob as he read the words scribbled as neatly as the now-dead blonde could have made them, but still slightly messy.
"Uhm... Steve, can I talk to you in private?" Tony asked. And truthfully he didn't expect that to come out of the brunette's mouth. Actually, he doesn't what he was supposed to expect, but he knows it at least wasn't that. Regardless, he obliges, stuttering out a quiet "excuse me", to his friend before he stumbles on over to the genius.
When Tony returned home later that day after a few agonizing hours of doctors taking his vitals, he was allowed to go back home to the Avengers Tower. He was, however, under strict instructions from the doctors to take it easy, and that very well included fighting crime and staying in his lab for excessive hours. Normally he would complain about it, but this time around he was ok with it. The reason for this being that he would have more time to spend with Steve after all the shit they've had to deal with.
"So, he really didn't have any idea where they were. He's been trying to figure that out this entire time..."
"You should see yourself," Tony responded, gazing into Steve's eyes. The soldier leaned in and gave him a small peck on his lips, nothing more than that. "I hope me buying us Burger King is ok? I know it's nothing fancy but... I kinda just wanted something simple for tonight."
However, he calmed down when he felt the soldier wrap an arm around his shoulder, pulling him close and kissing the side of his head. The affection he receives dissipates all the negativity swirling inside of his head, replacing it with memory fragments of the male next to him. And he gets even happier when he says that T'Challa can help him. He tells him about how the medical team can correct and realign his fingers. Of course, he'd be knocked out while the procedure happens, but that gives the medical team the chance to use a harmless laser pointer specifically designed to penetrate the skin and fix any fractures in bones. It was actually really cool, and he was excited to give it a try.
The drawings he cared most about, however, were those of Tony. He opened the book and instantly landed on the first drawing he sketched on the genius. It was when he couldn't find Tony in his room that he had asked Friday where Tony was, only for the AI to notify him that he was in his lab. He brought his sketchbook with him, and Tony happily let him sit on the couch and watch him work. It was then that Steve got the chance to sketch Tony in his most natural habitat. He was working on upgrades to his Iron Man suit, leaning over the table with a screwdriver in his mouth, head slightly tilted as he looked inside the components of the suit.
"I can, and I will." It was his stubbornness that got the best of him, making him not want to admit to Steve, or rather himself, that there were things he was responsible for. It was just so easy to put all the blame on the soldier due to how the other made him feel, for what he's made him go through for all these months. "Don't think for a second that I won't ship you straight back to Ross' hands. Just cause you're here doesn't mean you're safe, not even for a second. Keep that in mind before you speak to me again, Capsicle."
"Well you've been working pretty hard, and I thought I'd do something nice for you." Steve took his own bite of his burger, and he has to admit, the flavors were so divine. He loved the way everything was cooked to perfection and the way his nose also ran due to the spice, the way the cheese melted in his mouth and mixed with the juicy flavor of the meat, he's glad he made the stop on the way back. "This just became my favorite burger place too."
Tony decided that he would carry himself to the kitchen to search and figure out what was taking Steve so long. He traversed the hallway leading to the kitchen, his footsteps a mere pitter-patter against the wooden floorboards. As he got closer, his steps got quieter and slower, his ears picking up two voices speaking to each other. He hid behind the wall, leaning forward just a little bit to see Natasha and Steve. He focused on their conversation, listening to every word that was spoken without trying to reveal himself.
It was the fifth day of him walking by Shuri's lab and seeing him there, all happy and carefree, and he thinks that maybe what he and Tony had never existed in the first place. He thinks that, maybe, Tony didn't love him as much as he thought, and he might have dreamt the genius being in his arms, telling him that he loved him, dreamt that his hands were cupping the sides of his face and his lips were against his. But it felt so real, and yet at the same time so imaginary now that things seem different. He's lost- just like how he was lost when he woke up in this strange little word and everything was far too different for him to comprehend. He doesn't know where to go, or what to believe in, he's confused and hurt and it's all too much.
The doctor offers him just a slight brush of her hand on his cheek, and while the gesture isn't enough to stop the overflow of emotions within his body, it's just enough to reassure him that he can do this, that things could get better in the end. He watches her walk away from him, leaving him not only to his thoughts but to have his alone time with the person who might not even be able to speak to him.
"Because I'm scared I'll fuck it up." There was a familiar prickling sensation behind his eyes, and he blinked rapidly to force the tears that threatened to spill back. "I hurt him once because he wanted to know more about my dad, and the stupid daddy issues I had yet to resolved made me mad and say something I regret saying to him. He was so... Destroyed. He told me when I asked him what he wanted, he said he wanted to die, and you wanna know why? It's because of what I said to him. I can't... I won't... I don't want him to get close to me because I don't want to hurt him again. It kills me on the inside."
"You can do whatever you want, honey. I'm all yours." Tony's smile widened and he slowly leaned in. He placed his lips gently against Steve's, moving his body so that he was in front of the soldier and had his back pressed up against the elevator walls. The kiss started slow, hands roaming until Steve's found their place on Tony's hips, and Tony's found their place around his neck. Things started to heat a bit, small, soft moans emitted in the elevator, Tony's hands running through Steve's hair, his teeth biting his bottom lip, and his tongue swiping across the same spot, asking for entrance. The soldier obliged mouth opening and letting Tony's tongue dance with his, allowing the shorter male to dominate the kiss. They could feel a tent in both of their pants, excitement coursing through them. Steve pulled back from the kiss and threw his head back, letting out a groan as Tony ground their clothed erections together.
that Steve wouldn't do that a second time, but he's scared. Scared of losing him, scared of bad things happening to him, scared of many things he actually doesn't like talking about, but with Steve, he's the most scared he's ever been. Regardless of him being scared, what he did was stupid, and he should have at the very least tried to make time for Steve, even if what he had in mind with staying in the lab for five days was with good intentions.
It felt like hours watching Bruce come in and out of the room checking his vitals, making sure to refill his IV drips, occasionally bringing coffee to the genius which he thanked him for. It felt like just as the seconds ticked by, the big hand of the clock moving ever so gently closer to the little hand, that he heard the faint sound of a groan from the blonde. He perked up, his eyebrows lost in his hairline, his eyes wide as he looked at Steve's sleeping figure. He wasn't the only one who heard it as Bruce was already by the soldier's side.
"Definitely a memory to keep." The ride to their respective floors was soon accompanied by silence as the elevator continued its ascension. Invisible words were hanging in the air around Steve and Tony, and it took a few minutes for Steve to finally inhale those lingering words, and let his voice carry them into Tony's ear. "Can I ask about your father?"
"I know you're out there. There's no use hiding." He spoke calmly. His hands were clenched into fists, ready for the first sign of trouble that would start the fight, but instead, they unclenched as a familiar figure walked out of the shadows, his eyes softening as he rushed over.
The door creaked as it slowly opened, and his breath caught in his throat. He didn't really expect to see
"Oh god," Tony groaned, rolling his eyes, "my AI and the super-soldier are teaming up against me. Careful, Rogers, soon he'll start to like you more than me."
His shoulders slumped and he could feel how sore his eyes were. He rubbed his eyes with the back of his hands, trying to dissipate the sleep from within them. There was this weird squish sound once he opened his eyes, and he frowned in disgust. He looked back at Tony and sighed heavily, slumping in his seat.
"Sorry, we don't have to do this if you don't want to." He said, placing a chaste kiss on Steve's thigh.
"This might feel uncomfortable." He warned. He slowly pushed his index finger inside, causing Steve to arch his back and clench around him. His toes curled and he threw his head back, his cock also twitching in response.
As Steve nodded his head, both occupants heard the sound of footsteps entering the common area. When they looked behind them, they saw the rest of their team; Wanda, Nat, Thor, Bruce, and Clint, wasted no time in making their way over to the couch where the two superheroes resided. Tony grabbed the first aid kit off the table in front of him, standing up and walking towards the stairs so he could put the kit back in the medical supplies cabinet he got it from.
"I know this is my first time and all, but don't you want me to... Prep you, before I uh..." He trailed off, blushing.
"What," Tony growled. It effectively pissed him off knowing that his love life was just a game for the spy twins to bet over, and he's even more pissed to just find out about this.
The scene changed and suddenly I found myself in an alleyway, the voices of everyone around me nothing but a murmur in the distance. One sound, in particular, made its way into my ear, and that was the sound of soft whimpering. My feet moved forward, the sound getting louder as I got closer to my destination. My breath hitched as I stopped walking, remembering exactly what this was I was witnessing. I watched my younger self, laying there, arms wrapped around himself, lip broken, small traces of blood where the skin on my lip was torn, quiet sobs wracking my body, and the occasional whimper that forced its way out. I never knew when to quit despite my small stature, I was always willing to let myself get beaten to a pulp by whatever bully I decided to open my mouth too.
"I know it's not fair, but Fury said that we all have to be there. There's nothing you can say or do at this point."
Instead, he carries himself over to his room, dealing with the issue in the worst way possible. It's not that he doesn't want to fix the problem, because of course he wants to, but he doesn't know-how. It's bigger than just a simple sorry; the word sorry itself only holds so much value until it loses it completely. Sorry doesn't simply make up for five days of pain and anguish the super-soldier must have suffered, and sorry doesn't make up for the tears almost made him shed.
"Doing what on purpose? Enjoying a nice movie with our Captain and his favorite genius?" Clint answered, a mischievous smile on his face. Oh yup, they were so doing this on purpose. Tony clicked his teeth with his tongue and a small wave of annoyance was starting to fester in his chest. Why couldn't it have just been Steve to come back and Clint and Natasha could've just stayed busy with whatever the hell they were doing before they came home? He just wanted some Steve time, and it was being ruined.
"Can you blame me? This feels so good. No one has ever done this to me before. Hell, nobody has even touched me before, you're the first person to do this to me."
He moved his hand from its place on Tony's, placing it on his left cheek, his other hand finding its spot on his right. The genius didn't move, instead, he sat there, waiting patiently and staring at the blonde, waiting for him to move and act. He saw the soldier lean in slowly, and he, too, started to lean in slowly. His pulse quickened, his heartbeat loud in his ear, or was that Steve's? It didn't matter at this point. Tony placed one of his hands on Steve's shoulder, their lips coming closer to each other until they were nothing more than a few ghostly inches away from one another.
"Trust me, my little witch, you can put all the blame on yourself if you want to, but that doesn't make things better. You messed up, but who hasn't messed up in their life." He pats her shoulder and smiles; a real genuine smile, not a fake one he reserves just for the public, but a real genuine down-to-earth smile. "I know I've messed up a lot in my life, but we can only move forward."
"Cap," Natasha yelled, drawing his attention towards her, "we're coming up on our destination in fifteen minutes." He nodded his head at her and turned back towards Tony. "You ready?"
have, in his own mind, done more for him, which the genius was beating himself up over. He sighed and looked down before continuing to speak. "I'm sorry for not protecting you. I'm sorry that I let all of this crap happen to you. I'm sorry that I wasn't... Good enough to do anything to prevent this from happening to you."
, so refer to me as such." He scoffed and crossed his arms, ignoring the way the soldier looked down at his feet. "Dad already wished you were his son anyways." He muttered, forgetting that Steve had enhanced hearing, making him feel worse.
"I hate to interrupt, sir, but it appears Captain Rogers is requesting access to the lab." He froze in his seat, eyes looking towards the door. Through the glass he could see Steve, standing there, fidgeting as he looked into the room. The soldier gave a small awkward smile, accompanied by a shaky wave. His eyes moved around, looking at anything he could focus his gaze on. His hands found their place on the front of his shirt, playing with the hem, squeezing at the fabric out of nervousness. It was an unusual look on Steve that Tony wasn't even familiar with seeing, but remembered that it must've taken a lot of guts for him to come down here.
Pepper Potts had his eyes always on her, from the way she moved, her hips swaying from side to side, the way she carried herself, head held high, shoulders rolled back, spinal column straight, picture-perfect posture, down to the way she talked to him. She left no room for his bullshit, always seeing right through him and calling him out on it, but understanding on a deeper level what he was trying to hide from her. She was his better half, and he adored every minute he got to be with her, right up until he let her go.
"He went alone to keep you safe, Captain. He did not want to risk you getting captured again, and he felt that your recovery was more important than what he wanted to do."
"You're right. I trust that you'll be ok. But, please make sure to call me, or video chat me. Actually, let's take a few moments to teach you how to use those things." This time it was Steve who chuckled, nodding his head and placing another small kiss on Tony's cheek.
In an instant, as quick as it came, the fear was replaced by the cold, steel gaze he was first met with. Tony looked away once more, a sigh escaping past his lips, the hand not holding onto the door was slowly forming into a fist, the tension in the air thick, and in Tony's case, suffocating.
"No," Tony said firmly, "Steve's too damn stubborn to die, he's gonna keep fighting." He stared down at his coffee cup, knowing that it was the Captain's stubbornness that was going to get him killed, or even worse, damaged beyond repair. Tony wasn't ready for that, he didn't want Steve to come home damaged and broken, it would tear him apart. He felt a hand gently run through his brown curly locks, effectively calming him down. He leaned into the comforting gesture and raised his head, looking at Natasha, the corner of her lips curved upward in a small half-smile.
All eyes were trained on Fury, the Director's calm exterior never faltering as he looked at every one of them. It was like some twisted scheme was playing out before them, like those movies where someone you thought you could trust ends up being someone else, or worse, potentially evil. It had Tony's nerves on end as he and everyone else waited, that was until he was the one who spoke up.
Maybe it started when he woke up in this new world he has yet to become acquainted with. Yes, maybe that sounds more realistic. Encased, or rather, as anybody else would put it, sleeping in ice for 70 years only to wake up in the future where everything was so... Different. The technology was more advanced, everything was so much bigger and brighter, it was all so confusing and so much to take in. He lost his best friends, lost the girl, lost everybody he ever knew back in the forties.
"Steve is going to be ok, Tony. I promise you that." Bruce spoke back just as calmly, trying to relax his friend. He knew that Tony was completely on edge, the poor guy hadn't left Steve's side.
"I'll make sure to take it easy." He said with a smile, making his way out of his room and towards the elevator. Any form of exercise was out of the question since he could still feel aches in his body. He looked down at himself, and his eyes widened. He wasn't small, he was his normal super soldier self. He could've sworn that whatever they injected into him had turned him skinny again, he could feel how weak and fragile his body was, he could feel how shallow and painful each breath he took was. But here he was, once again the picture-perfect specimen of human health.
"That's Dum-E, one of my creations. Say hi to Wanda, Dum-E." The robot opened and closed its claw, making some sort of sound that Wanda could probably interpret as happiness. She giggled and patted the creation's claw, making Dum-E move closer to her in its own special way of hugging her. "He likes you," Tony said smiling. "Don't stay up too late Dum-E, you need to recharge ok?" The robot nodded its claw and proceeded to head over to the corner where its charging station was.
"So you're saying aliens might be at work?" Tony inquired, turning around to look at Fury who still had his back to him.
Steve just stood there and watched him leave, unable to get his voice to work. He made his way to the table Tony once sat at, his elbows resting against the surface as his hands held his head. He watched as his tears hit the tabletop, and how his body shook. He let out a small sob as he sat there, missing when things were normal, missing when he wasn't so broken, and most of all, missing his genius, more than anything.
I felt tears cloud my vision as I stared at myself and Bucky, my best friend, hanging off the side of the train, his hands just barely gripping the railing to keep himself from falling. I watched myself reach forward, trying to get him to grab my hand, trying to save him with every ounce of power I had coursing through my body from the serum. I remember the feeling of my heart hammering in my chest as I tried my best to save him, I remember the sudden drop of fear as I watched the bar snap, I remember the guilt coiling inside my chest as I watched my best friend plummet to his death. Even after I got the serum, after literally becoming the peak perfection of a human body, I was still weak.
"Why don't you just shoot me right now, get it over with?" Tony's voice quivered. Why the hell was he saying things on autopilot? Of course, he didn't want the guy to shoot him, but when you're scared out of your mind and have limited options, you tend to say things that you shouldn't.
There's another scream, and once again he realizes it's his own, but it's different. He's sweating, hyperventilating, clawing at his clothed-covered body and his eyes move rapidly in different directions. And he realizes he's in his room, but he doesn't care. He's not worried about where he is, but about where he isn't. He races to Steve's room, dreading the worst that he might already be too late, and he might already find his dead body on the floor instead of hearing the gunshot go off.
"Wouldn't we, or rather someone else at S.H.I.E.L.D. noticed that something was wrong. It would raise suspicion that Hydra or these things suddenly have access to our tech." Natasha spoke.
"So far, nothing interesting has happened. Just boring reconnaissance. If I'm lucky I'll be back at the tower before you know it." That little sentence made him jump for joy on the inside. On the outside, he was nothing but happy, if the smile that has yet to disappear off of his face was any indication.
he had for Tony that made him think for a fraction of a second that going back to New York was a good choice. It was that choice that he made that landed him here, in the Raft Prison.
"I know nothing is interesting about the edge of the stretcher, so something's on your mind that you wanna ask." She spoke, causing him to jump in his seat next to her. She smirked and it was a nice sight to see.
Regardless, his dreams feel more like a way to play with his emotions rather than soothe them. Whether the dreams are sexual, or tame, the mind always has a certain way of either playing with the brain or giving it contentment. Right now, he feels like his mind is being played with and it's far worse than the beatings and bullet wounds he received from Ross and his guards. It's worse than the whole Siberia situation, the whole "Civil War", as people call it, that tore apart the Avengers. They were bad, don't get him wrong, but nothing can compare to the feeling of wanting to see your loved one, but finding out they're no longer there.
"Well, I don't mind enjoying moments like this and being yours exclusively, talking is nice, too. But you know I'm shit at dating, right?" Steve chuckled and shook his head, his nose rubbing against Tony's a little, causing the brunette to giggle.
"I'm not gonna do anything to your finger, if that's what you're worried about. I need you to let the machine scan your fingerprint so you can place the mug under the nozzle, let it scan your fingerprint, and make your coffee." He motioned for his finger again, and Steve held out his pointer finger to the genius. He placed the soldier's finger on the side of the machine, watching as a small blue light lit up under his fingertip, disappearing a few seconds later, and listening to the satisfying sound of liquid filling an empty mug.
"You feel that even though you acknowledge that someone else is in your presence, you yourself feel unhappy because you assume, or rather, you feel as if you are just existing there. That you're unneeded, or you don't want to be there."
"Hang on," he whispered, grabbing his shirt and quietly exiting the room. "Alright, continue. What's the issue?"
He was thrown onto the ground, and he bit back a groan of pain that almost forced its way past his throat and out of his mouth. Another set of footsteps was heard while he lay there, face down on the cold steel flooring, eyes half-lidded, blood oozing out of his wounds and soaking his clothes. He couldn't move, he was too weak to do anything. He just accepted what was about to come.
"I know, but what if something happens to you? I don't want you to get hurt, and if anything happens how will I cope knowing you got hurt and I can't help you? What if... What if you don't come back?"
It was a weird moment for him, and as he continues to look at the soldier groaning slightly in pain, he starts to wonder if what he's doing is wrong. And, of course, it is wrong, but in Tony's mind it was two sides clashing against each other; one that held all the hatred he had for the blue-eyed man who hurt him, threw him aside like a second option, the side that only sought to seek revenge and make him suffer, while the other side was filled with compassion, telling him that he was in the wrong for what he was doing and that he didn't want to see Steve like this.
he's never seen Steve like this before and it's just turning him on even more. But then the soldier stops and places his head against Tony's shoulder, peppering small kisses on the appendage as he continues to leave him pressed against the wall. It's silent for a few minutes- other than the steady breathing of both males.
"Wanna," he paused to bring his arm up and his hand over his shoulder, thumb stretched out and pointing out the door, "get something to eat?"
He had good news for Tony once he finished his therapy session, and he was really excited to tell him. He got his stuttering down to a minimalist proportion- meaning that he could at the very least attempt to form a coherent sentence without stuttering too much, but that didn't mean he was going to stop stuttering. Tony said he'd be back soon, and he thought that he'd be back by now, but as he opened the door he saw no sign of the genius. So, he waited, and waited, and waited. Seconds turned into minutes, and then the minutes soon rolled into hours, and he was getting more worried with each time measurement that was dwindling.
He couldn't take it anymore, and he turned the dial on the side of the device all the way down, deactivating the collar. He watched as Steve slowly brought his head away from his knees, and Tony's breath got caught in his throat as he heard the audible sniffle of the soldier. He watched as Steve wiped his eyes, bringing his knees closer to his chest, holding them there as his head rested against the white walls of his "room." He found it awkward that he hated watching Steve disassemble right in front of him, showing his vulnerability because he's so used to seeing Steve hold every emotion in with a tight lid. He might have liked seeing the hurt and vulnerability in his eyes as Ross and his guards whisked him away in those special cuffs designed just for him, but now it was unnerving.
"Tony?" He turned around and as he made eye contact with the genius, pain coursed through his shoulder. He grit his teeth, his left arm flying to comfort his right shoulder. His eyes widened in panic, the genius in front of him holding a gun, barrel sizzling with smoke from the shot he just took. "T-Tony? W-What are you-", he was cut off when the gun was angled down at his left leg, effectively dropping him to his knees, painful gasps making their way past his lips. He looked up and stared into brown eyes, a hand caressing his cheek as his eyes trembled.
"Don't be, it's alright really. Eventually, I met Rhodey in my MIT days, and he was the only person who didn't care how wealthy or smart I was, he saw me for me. He stood up for me when people bullied me, I even remember when he punched one of the bullies in the face. Of course, he got in trouble, but he said it was worth it." He chuckled a little at the memory. He felt a hand placed on top of his, causing him to look up. He saw concerned blue eyes staring back at him, a small smile splayed on his face.
It's been an eventful week for Tony, or as eventful as he wanted it to be. He spent the week enjoying his time talking to his super-soldier, enjoying how the lab was full of laughter and the sweet sound of his voice. It was a nice touch to drown out all the busy work he was doing; which included building two robots for Dum-E who goes by the name of Butterfingers and You. Butterfingers was the first robot he started working on, and the reason why he named it Butterfingers was because, well, as the name implies, the bot is very clumsy. He remembered giving it Dum-E's favorite blender to hold, and the appliance met its untimely end when the bot dropped it, shattered glass spilling all over the lab floor. In return, sparked him to create his next robot, You. The way he came up with that name was, well, he simply said "hey, you, clean this up," and the name seemed to have just stuck since he couldn't think of anything creative to call the robot. He also had to build a new blender for Dum-E, since he was so emotionally scarred, or rather, Tony felt he was emotionally scarred.
"I like everything about you, too. That's why," he laced his hand with Tony's, looking the genius in the eyes, "I wanted to ask you if I can be your boyfriend?"
," he said harshly, causing the blonde to flinch a little at his sudden flare of anger, "it has never been Anthony, and it will

"No," he answered truthfully, "because one life isn't worth millions. If I didn't do what I did, everybody would've been dead. If I didn't do what I did," he paused for a second, a small, genuine smile splayed across his face, "you wouldn't be here." It was nice to see Tony smiling, as weird as it was for him to feel that way, but really who cares. It was different when he saw Peggys' smile, that's for sure, but right now he felt happy, and that's really what mattered to him. "Thank you for today, Anthony. I'm glad you were willing to show me around. Makes everything a little bit easier."
He sighed to himself, running a hand down his face, biting his lip just shortly after returning the appendage in its place at the side of his body. Regardless of his own stubbornness, or wanting to stay as far away from the blonde as possible, he wouldn't be able to sleep tonight knowing that he had caused the other male tremendous amounts of emotional, and psychological pain.
I sat there, for what felt like minutes, or maybe even hours. It was hard to tell past the numbing sensation in my body and the fuzzy haze in my mind. I felt paralyzed in my own body as if it wouldn't respond to me. I didn't know what to do except just sitting here and accept what was happening to me. I had no choice but to sit here and wait for Tony to return. I just wanted to go home. I just want to go back home and make everything right, I want Tony to love me, I want him to hold me how he used to and tell me everything is going to be alright. I didn't want this pain, but Tony assured me I deserve it. He's probably right, I do deserve it. I deserve every bit of pain he gives me for letting myself be weak and get captured. I don't deserve Tony, he deserves better.
The walk to the hallway at least gave him some time to think about what he was doing. He wasn't going to lie and say he wasn't uncomfortable at the gesture he was about to do, because quite frankly he hasn't been very nice to the soldier. Suddenly, out of nowhere, he gives Steve his sketchbook and art supplies? Yeah, if that isn't very suspicious or weird for him to do. He was also uncomfortable at the thought that he might have to apologize to Steve, and well, that would be harder to do. You see, pride is a dangerous demon, one Tony has yet to conquer sometimes. It's controlling, manipulative, it keeps a nasty grip on you, gripping your throat tight in its imaginary hand so tight if you so much as think or try to say the wrong thing because pride won't let you admit your faults. It's one out of the many demons he has yet to surpass, but hey, one thing at a time.
