“Ever heard of breathing machines, Cap?” Iron Man was clearly dodging the question.
, not the other way around.” Steve paused for a second, considered his next words and then continued, “That is why I love him.”
While walking, his thoughts had been interrupted by a small, faint meow, coming from somewhere near. That’s when he had noticed a worn cardboard box on the ground right next to him. The meows came out from there.
Iron Man first looked at Steve, then at the box on his hands. “Is there a bomb?” He asked. Steve shook his head. “No, no. Just come over here and take a look.” Iron Man did as asked, and came over to Steve. He slowly peeked inside the box, and Steve was almost completely sure that he heard the man gasp.
, and rose back up. “They are fierce, too.” Steve hummed in response.
Steve, who was currently making his side of the bed lifted his gaze up to see, as a bunch of almost fully grown cats laid on top of Tony, who was still laying in bed, although it was already past 9 in the morning.
“Don’t worry, Avenger. I’m as fine as ever,” Steve assured with a smile on his face. “It’s just that, well, come and take a look, will you?” He lifted the box in his hands a little higher, prompting Iron Man to come and take a look inside. The kittens themselves had stopped their constant meowing after Iron Man had come in. They probably didn’t like his metallic voice as much as Steve did.
“Actually, a little help wouldn’t be too bad,” Steve admitted to Tony. It almost sounded like Tony sighed, but he could have just imagined it. It could have also been just one of the kittens making noise, like always.
“Oh, it wasn’t anything significant, don’t worry,” Iron Man assured. And Steve believed him. If Iron Man said that it wasn’t significant, it probably wasn’t. Steve was, on top of everything, just really glad to finally have a chat with his old friend. His life was starting to feel dull. Of course Jarvis was there to keep Steve company - when he was around - but balancing his duties as the Avenger’s new leader, and trying to find a real social life at the same time was tiring. He always felt like himself with Iron Man, which was what he really needed right now.
He recalled his dream. It was all kind of a messy fuzz, which was unusual. Usually he could remember his dreams perfectly, sometimes even weeks after they had occurred. But now all he could remember was Iron Man and this feeling. It weighed down his chest, but surprisingly, not in a bad way.
“A romantic relationship,” Steve simply answered as a matter of fact.
Right now James was laying on a cushion on the kitchen floor. Iron Man and Steve checked up on it every once in a while, making sure that everything was okay.
“You don’t even know him, his name, or his face,” Tony countered. Steve huffed. He wasn’t sure if Tony was on his side or not. “I know enough. And I trust him.”
“But in all seriousness,” Tony continued, “what exactly do you mean by a relationship?”
“Right,” Iron Man mumbled and looked around. “I must have thrown it somewhere, then. Probably while moving the medicine from here to the bathroom upstairs. I’ll go and take a look.” Steve nodded and Iron Man left the kitchen, leaving Steve alone with the kittens.
And so Steve picked up the phone, and dialed Tony’s number without much of a thought. If he didn’t answer, Steve could just find Iron Man in a different way. He didn’t know how, but he’d find a way.
“Is there really nothing else you can do?” He asked. He was ready to help, if there was a way. Steve didn’t know how, but he’d be ready to do almost anything.“No. Cap, Steve, I’m begging you, don’t worry about it.”
“I appreciate your offer, Steve,” Iron Man said after a couple of seconds, “But I manage on my own. You shouldn’t worry about me. You already have the kittens.”
Steve understood that, of course. The kittens were small, smaller than the palm of his hand. Even he was afraid to genuinely touch them. He couldn’t blame Iron Man.
Walter kept trying to jump off of the table, but Steve kept stopping him. It must have annoyed Walter, because after a while he started to bite Steve’s fingers. It didn’t hurt, because the kitten’s teeth were still quite small. Steve just gently moved his hand on the table while Walter used it as his chewing toy.
Steve huffed out a laugh and shook his head again. He did actually kind of hope that the situation was something like that, because at least then he would have an actually good reason to bother Iron Man. Even though it looked like he was delighted to see the kittens, Steve knew that Iron Man had other things to do.
“I was wondering if Iron Man could come by, if you don’t mind,” Steve carefully proposed. There was a couple of seconds of silence. Steve wondered if he had said something wrong. Then Tony cleared his throat. “Right, right. I’ll call him and ask him if he’s available.”
“Hey, you know what, Cap?” Iron Man suddenly asked. Steve switched his gaze from the kitten back to him. “Maybe I can help you out a little bit, eh? It looks like these little guys could really use something to eat.”
“Oh, please, just call me Tony. No need for formalities,” Mr. Stark, or actually, Tony requested. Steve mentally noted that. He didn’t consider the two of them close. Of course they had their talks and Steve respected Tony - he was the one to give Steve a home after all - but they never really talked outside of work. The same could definitely be said about Iron Man, since they never really saw each other outside duty, but it felt different. At least for Steve it did. He had experienced so much with Iron Man, and the two of them just shared a bond in and outside of the battlefield. The same could not be said of Tony
“So, what about you, then?” Tony suddenly asked, waking Steve back to reality. Steve realized that he had been so lost in his own thoughts, that he hadn’t said anything for a moment. It must have been confusing for Tony to just sit in silence as Steve was lost in his own thoughts. And out of everything, the thoughts revolved around his bodyguard’s voice.
Steve started to carefully pet Walter, who enjoyed the attention. His thoughts drifted towards Iron Man, like they had done many times these past days. He had been really lonely ever since he got out of the ice. It felt like the world was moving on, and he couldn’t keep up with people no matter what. But now, when Iron Man kept him company every day, it all felt a bit better. It really felt like someone was there with him, listening to him, and spending time with him. Of course most of that time spent together consisted of taking care of five kittens, but that was on itself enough for Steve.
“They’re really cute,” Tony murmured. Steve agreed. “They are. Iron Man would probably like to see them too. Do you know where he is?”
“Well, to be honest, the kittens weren’t the only thing I came here to see,” Tony revealed. “I did come here to check up on you, too.”
“Mhm,” Steve hummed and sat on the bed right next to Tony and his fluffy attackers. “I feel like
It wouldn’t have bothered Steve as much as it did, had he not constantly dreamed of Iron Man. He still couldn't quite tell what was going on in those dreams, but he had this endless, heavy yet warm feeling every time after waking up. Sometimes the feeling was boosted by a fluffy kitten laying on his chest.
“Where’s the bottle? I left it on this table last time,” Steve asked and searched for the eye drops with his eyes. The kitchen he was in was a mess. There were empty cans and cat food everywhere on the floor. Sticky notes full of instructions and reminders regarding the kittens were posted on the walls and cabinets, making the kitchen more colorful than ever before. It honestly looked like a dumpster.
Sure, Iron Man was a good man. He never failed to make Steve smile. But Steve didn’t know anything about the man behind the mask. No names, no age, not even the color of his hair. Iron Man could be anyone, even someone Steve has already met. And to be completely honest, it didn’t bother Steve as much as it probably should have. He had already taken a liking to Iron Man in these conditions, anyway. But it would most likely bother Iron Man. There was likely a reason for his secretiveness, and he probably didn’t want to reveal his identity to Steve.
“It’s okay,” Tony assured and then laughed a little. Steve didn’t understand what was so funny. “I’m honestly taken by your words. I don’t know if anyone has ever talked about me like that before. Or about Iron Man. I don’t know if you feel the same way about, you know, me.” Tony gestured at himself.
“Do you know if Iron Man is currently open for a relationship?” Steve asked. It felt odd voicing that question out loud, especially to Iron Man’s employer, but they were friends, right? It wasn’t too big of a deal.
“You’re makin’ me blush with all the compliments, Winghead,” Iron Man responded. Steve raised his eyebrows. Was that a joke, or did he really make Iron Man blush? That wasn’t his intention. He just said what he generally thought of Iron Man.
“You sure?” Tony asked. “You don’t need any help with them?”
While working, the two of them also had some general small talk. They mainly talked about their work. Steve told Iron Man about the latest adventures of the Avengers, and in return Iron Man told him about the latest updates of his armor. It felt nice to have someone to talk to properly, and after everything was set up, Iron Man left, leaving Steve and the kittens together in the mansion.
Steve worked after breakfast. He checked the possible alarms and calls for help. If there was nothing, he spent the whole day with Iron Man and the kittens.
“I insist, Tony. I want to at least see him,” Steve maintained. Because that was it, he wanted to see Iron Man in person. He didn’t need Iron Man’s help everyday, he just wanted his company.
Only now Steve really realized what an idiot he had been.
“Captain! Good morning,” Tony grinned. He looked good.
‘Seems only fair. I know the Daredevil is Matt Murdock. You know Spider-Man is Peter Parker. Just swing by Queens if you ever need a hand in Hell’s Kitchen.’
’ Tony cuts off the man’s speech by punching the wall next to his face, feeling another twinge of satisfaction as Ross flinches.
‘Everyone is on their way, estimated time of arrival for last person is three minutes. Call coming through now.’
‘You know what Tin Can? I think maybe this was a bad idea. Maybe I should just say goodbye to you and Spidey and-’
‘Oh! Or we could send him after wildebeest! They deserve it after what they did to Mufasa!’
Loki takes the figure of his mother back and places her on the side, placing a spell to ensure it would never melt. ‘I am not used to being somewhere with Thor where I am not seen as second best; only Mother ever made me feel equal to him before coming here. I am not sure how I feel about celebrating Yule, its bringing back a lot of memories that are not all as happy as Thor’s are.’
Steve doesn’t reply, just follows his friend back inside and up to the briefing room. Despite everything he feels a little lighter, and much more determined. Just like Bucky says: he’s going to get his fella back, and anyone who gets in the way was going to get hurt.
Rhodes laughs to cover the lump in his throat. ‘Mama you
‘Why does every AI I create end up learning sarcasm?’ Tony wonders aloud as he quickly leaves his workshop. ‘Make sure you save all of that, FRIDAY, I was close to a break through.’
‘You’re the only female Avengers, no?’ Vision asks.
‘Tony-’ Steve feels his heart breaking at the sight of the man before him and walks up to stand a couple of steps in front of him, wanting to reach out and touch him, but unsure if he can.
‘Mantis stop eating the dough or there’ll be none left for Christmas!’ Wanda laughs.
‘No! Tony how much else have you been keeping secret from us? First the hydrophobia, now this?’
‘What did I do now?’
‘Francis is the fucker that did this to me,’ he gestures to the scars on his face, which he’s become a lot less self-conscious about around the team now. ‘He was the one in charge of the experiments, stupid bastard called himself Ajax but I got his real name off his laundry-’
Okoye appears at his side. ‘Thank you,’ she tells him, ‘I can protect them from here. You find out where they are coming from.’
‘Wow, uh, hey,’ Harry extends his hand for Wade to shake. ‘Sorry you just aren’t what I was expecting when Pete told me he had a boyfriend.’
He’s grateful that the king doesn’t try and give empty words of comfort; everyone can see how badly shaken Steve, Natasha and Clint are, and it’s knocked the rest of them. Tony barely slept last night, keeping watch over Steve when the soldier managed to catch an hour or two of fitful sleep. Everyone this morning has dark circles under their eyes and lines showing the strain on their faces. ‘HYDRA is wanting to get the entire team under their control or kill us, so we’ll go back to the US where we can fight on home soil with home advantage.’
chance.’
, Tony thinks with an internal chuckle.
There’s another pause. ‘How about we do tacos tomorrow? Say eight at our usual place? I can update you with anything then.’
It easily ranks as one of Wanda’s favourite ballet lessons ever. Peter was wrong when he said he wasn’t a natural, or perhaps it was his improved balance from his powers and the core work he’d been doing as his training, but he quickly grasped the more basic routines and was able to keep up with her.
‘The hell I can’t,’ the other voice responds, and Bucky gets his answer when the door to his room is opened and there’s Doctor Blake standing the doorway with none other than-
‘I can’t say the same for disruptions from the team though.’
Tony shrugs and looks away. ‘Even before the Accords the team was the only family I had left, except for Pepper and Happy. Happy works for SI and Pepper and I had just broken up so weren’t on the best terms. I just-I wanted that back. I needed my family back.’
A/N: I'm a terrible human being I totally forgot I hadn't updated this week! I'm so sorry! I hope you enjoyed this chapter, although it is a little bit of character bonding rather than pushing the story forwards.
‘Better not answer her, Snowflake, you know you’ll only fuck it up no matter what you say.’ Wade laughs.
Love to you all as always,
‘I can give it to him, miss,’ Ned volunteers, and Peter sends his friend a thankful smile before he steps out of the classroom.
‘Clint come with me,’ Natasha says, ‘let me explain outside.’ He looks ready to argue again, but she grabs his arm, twisting it behind his back in a lock, and all but shoves him outside.
‘I just did,’ Stark replies, shutting the door in Blane’s face. ‘You,’ he jabs a finger at Belinda. ‘Go and get Doctor Strange. Now!’
‘Are you eavesdropping?’ Tony asks her.
‘Gamora is Thanos’ daughter,’ the only one not to have spoken so far says, ‘she would know him best of all of us.’
‘I’m scared,’ he admits quietly.
‘He’s here,’ Loki manages to get past a suddenly dry mouth. ‘Thanos is here.’
‘And they call
‘I did. I’m assuming you’d like a distraction?’ his voice comes through into her ear.
Next to him the other man sighs. ‘I had to, baby boy. Not all the jobs at Sister Margaret’s can pay, if I take the occasional big paying job I can keep on with those.’
‘-set back your recovery because you know how impatient you get with doctors and-’
‘See this is why I like it when the kid’s here. At least someone appreciates me!’
‘No,’ she gives a little huff. ‘Who are you as a superhero?’
‘Hold up,’ Tony puts his cutlery down on his plate and puts his hands up in front of him. ‘Did you just say
Steve shrugs. ‘Just didn’t feel right. I guess none of them was the right partner. Not until Peggy, and then I hit the ice before we could go for a dance.’
Love always,
Peter just stares at him as Wade continues to knit away as they talk. ‘That really doesn’t answer the question.’
‘Here,’ the soldier’s voice is soft as he lays Tony back on the bed and starts to work at the muscles in his back; he gives a groan of appreciation as knots that had formed years ago in the workshop are finally worked free.
Tony looks up and sees a frown on the god’s face. ‘What do you mean?’
‘There’s an exit shaft on the south wall, just below where your room is, that’ll be the better one to use,’ he answers. ‘I’d normally go for one on the opposite side, just underneath my room so they’ll have that one covered. Head straight until you get to the third right, then you need the fourth left, slide down and then you need to grab the third exit above you. Climb up there and then you need the fourth grate underneath you. That’ll take you into the room with the flag.’
Hopefully the sneak peek gives you an idea of what the focus is going to be for a couple of chapters. Let me know if there's anything you'd like to see from this series, or even other stories. As always thank you so much for the truly wonderful and overwhelming support for this story.
‘No!’ Peter’s eyes go comically wide. ‘No I’m just saying I was doing what I was taught by staying on the ceiling. So no one can accuse me of cheating.’
‘Oh Thanos!’ I manage to sing-song, waving at him with the gauntlet. ‘Yeah so I thought Cable was butt-ugly but you really take the prize. How about I see you in hell, motherfucker?’
Peter raises an eyebrow at him, then looks to the blond. ‘He’s not expecting an answer to that is he?’
‘Right,’ Tony’s face is set and he stands up, ‘Nat I need a location on this guy and I’m going to make sure he leaves New York unless he wants to spend the rest of his stay in a cell.’
‘How is he?’ are the first words out of Steve’s mouth once they get back to the facility and join the others in the common area, Vision is in one of the chairs with Wanda knelt next to him trying to heal the wound in his side, both Bruce and Peter are stood nearby with FRIDAY projecting screens in front of them showing the extent of his injury.
‘Sorry,’ she says, ‘just, uh…just need a glass of water.’
He tries not to wince as Natasha’s fingers tighten involuntarily on his face. He can’t meet Steve’s eyes, with the weight of his failure on him.
Tony taps his arc reactor, letting the nanites spread around his body until he’s encased in his armour. ‘Come here, soldier, I guess that means no coffee’ he says, just as the helmet snaps into place. He puts an arm around Steve’s waist as the soldier steps onto his boot and they take off, heading directly for the Sanctum.
Taking a deep breath he slowly looks up from the table top, taking in the casual clothes, until he reaches the mask and tries not to let the disappointment show on his face.
‘Thank you,’ he says as Sam leaves, giving him a small salute as he does. Yeah, Rumlow does
Thor and Valkyrie have been demurring to Loki’s obviously superior knowledge in the case of Yule preparations, and the trickster has been in charge of organising everything which has meant he’s using his ability to be in two places at once, if not as a solid shape, to his full advantage. Peter, Wanda and Vision can tell when it’s one of Loki’s illusions, rather than him, and Thor can as long as he has something to hand to throw at Loki’s face. Sam also suspects Bucky can tell, but the man is more stubborn than Steve and Peter combined when he wants to keep something to himself.
‘Eh, you know what Stark’s like. He likes to show off,’ Rumlow shrugs. ‘But that means you need to get your dress uniforms ready, boys. We got a party to go to in four days’ time.’
Steve finds the cold doesn’t bother him as much as it used to.
‘And get me an ETA on Wanda and Vision.’
‘Pete what is it?’ Ned all but shouts at him, running over from where he’s been talking to Sam and Rhodes. Peter reaches into the box and pulls out an old Iron Man gauntlet. ‘No way!’
‘Thank you!’ he says, grinning in reply and gives Bucky a mock salute.
‘Who the hell is Loki?’ he demands.
‘No thanks,’ he says, straightening up and getting a chopping board out. ‘You mind going and telling the others it’ll be ready in about thirty minutes? Oh and tell Bucky it’s his turn to lay the table, since he’s managed to worm his way out of it the last three times.’
He turns in surprise as Pepper lets out a small sob and rushes to where he’s sitting to give him a hug. Too stunned to do anything other than react on instinct, Steve puts an arm around her shoulders as she cries into his shoulder. ‘Thank you,’ she whispers, barely loud enough for him to hear.
‘Usually goes to one that helps ex-emergency services who’ve been injured in their line of work and their families,’ Tony explains.
‘Steve-’
He does the only thing he can think of. He reaches up and pulls the man’s lips down to meet his own again, stifling the surprised sound as he kisses him. Wade’s arm tightens around his waist, his other arm cupping Peter’s cheek; both of Peter’s arms wrapped around the taller man’s neck.
‘Thanos was able to best him in combat,’ Thor explains, ‘and I believe it has rattled Hulk.’ That statement is met with quiet dread. If Hulk isn’t playing ball they’re down their biggest metaphorical gun.
‘I’ll keep quiet then,’ he reassures Vision. ‘Come on we better get back before anyone gets suspicious.’ Vision goes to speak to Tony and T’Challa and Peter returns to his friends; Natasha has joined the group in his absence and is giving MJ some tips.
‘Boss, should I let Captain Rogers in?’ FRIDAY asks.
‘Tony, when did you learn to cook?’ Rhodes eyes the inventor suspiciously.
Steve shakes his head, his smile turning decidedly mischievous. He can’t help but wish he had a camera so he could see that smile a lot more often. ‘I figured you could use some entertainment.’
T'Challa and Steve present the Wakandan Accords to the UN; Tony sends Wade to Europe
‘-quiet you. Loki has to come because he’s the only one who can potentially read these damn things, and he and Bucky can’t be too far away from each other or we risk them turning into brain dead zombies. Which, I’m not really sure you could tell the difference, but it’s always best to be safe.’
She turns to face the approach giant, holding the flag up and waving it at him. ‘Come on Big Guy! Come and get it!’
He gestures for Bucky to follow him out of the workshop and the two say nothing until they reach the elevator.
Peter cheers in victory, sitting cross-legged in front of Natasha on the floor. ‘Yeah, yeah, you go sit by your Mommy-Spider,’ Sam sighs, then frowns at the two soldiers. ‘What did he do to you two?’
“Excuse me?” was the only thing Steve could say at that moment. He was fully prepared for a simple
Tony sighed. Steve patiently waited for his response, fingers crossed. And to his delight, Tony accepted his demands.
“I could ask the same thing from you.”
That was… weirdly casual.
Tony scratched the back of his neck with his other hand. “I think that you deserve better.”
“I feel like an idiot right now, if I’m being honest,” Steve admitted. “I’m sorry. About all of this. You probably didn’t expect this, when you came here to see the kittens.”
“Care to join me in the living room and talk about it?”
“I’m in the living room,” Steve immediately called back and shifted on the couch. He carefully stood up, lifting the box up as he rose, while Iron Man‘s heavy footsteps could be heard approaching the room.
It was rude on Steve’s behalf to change the subject so suddenly, but could he be blamed? He hadn’t seen or heard of Iron Man for a week. He needed some answers. At least he wanted to know
As Tony had promised, the secretary let Steve inside Tony’s workshop. He couldn’t actually see any living humans there, after he stepped in. Only machines and some furniture, like some chairs. Only after looking around, he noticed a familiar man dressed in red and gold, sitting kind of lousily on a chair at the corner.
Iron Man showed up at around 8 am, usually with some food or other necessaries. Steve would eat breakfast, while Iron Man watched the kittens. They would chat about random things, sometimes about the weather, and sometimes about their lives. It never got really personal, but Steve appreciated it nevertheless. Everything Iron Man talked about was interesting. He always knew how to choose the right words and express his opinions.
A couple of days later Steve realized that he was falling into a routine.
“Because I’m Iron Man.”
It turned out that Iron Man knew more about kittens and animals in general than Steve originally estimated. He could tell the kitten’s ages, knew what to feed to them, set up a heating pad for them, and even helped Steve create a nice fort for them out of the countless cushions and pillows in the living room. Iron Man himself refused to actually touch any of the kittens, but the help he gave to Steve was still major.
Tony looked nervous. His hands were on his legs, clenched in fists. It didn’t look like he was disgusted with Steve’s words, rather distressed. He clearly tried to hold his composure, but his glossy eyes betrayed him. When Tony didn’t say anything, Steve decided to continue again and asked, “Tony. Is there something I don’t know?”
That was a hard thing to ask for. When Steve starts doing something, he won’t stop until he’s done.
“Fine. Iron Man is currently at my factory, in my personal workshop. My secretary will let you in.”
Tony was quiet for a second, and then asked,“With who?”
It came out so suddenly. Tony clamped his mouth shut, like he just let out the biggest secret of his life. And it most likely was. Steve, for sure, had not expected that. And while they both sat in silence, processing everything that had just happened, everything started to finally make sense to Steve.
At 9 o'clock Steve started to grow worried. Iron Man had never missed a day before. Sure, they never outright agreed to see everyday, but Steve had just figured that Iron Man would come by daily. He tried to come up with every explanation for Iron Man’s absence. Maybe he was still sleeping? Or maybe something else came up, which needed his immediate attention. But no matter what, Steve couldn't shake off the worrying feeling he got. Maybe he should just check up on Iron Man, and see if he’s doing alright.
Tony nodded. He tried to look relaxed, but Steve could read his face like an open book. Something was wrong.
To top it all off, right after Steve had finally gotten the kittens to settle down, the phone suddenly rang right next to him. He grumbled, but set the kittens in his hands down, and reached to pick up the phone. The caller was most likely a telemarketer. He had recently received a lot of calls from them. It’s not like he didn’t like telemarketers, but their calls did manage to annoy him.
Steve started the day off like he normally did. He woke up at six, fed the kittens, and did his workout. But Iron Man didn’t show up around 8. Nor 8.30. At first Steve just figured that he had to be stuck in the morning traffic, but he soon realized that Iron Man didn’t need a car. He could fly. So traffic was most likely not the problem.
But Iron Man didn’t show up the next day, like he usually did.
Or so Steve had at least thought, because immediately after Tony made a high pitched, surprised noise, and started coughing, most likely from shock. Steve stood up, ready to help Tony out, but he raised his other hand in order to stop Steve and drew in a couple of heavy breaths. The kittens had had enough at this point, and one by one jumped out of Tony’s lap.
“Have you given Walter his eye drops yet, Cap?” Iron Man asked, while opening yet another can of cat food. Steve shook his head, and picked up the black and white kitten from the floor, where it had been wandering around. He gently lifted it up on the kitchen table in front of him. The kitten tried to immediately jump down, but Steve stopped it with his hand.
“Hello, it’s Steve Rogers,” Steve responded. “I’m sorry to bother you once again, but I was just wondering if you could connect my call to Iron Man again. I need to talk with him.” He tried to play it professionally. Although Tony probably wanted to be casual with Steve - at least Steve thought he did, with the way Tony was always so casually talking with him - he still wanted for them to be more like business partners, than friends. It wasn’t anything personal towards Tony himself. Steve was just a bit more involved with Iron Man at the moment.
Steve nodded and took a seat on a couch opposite of Tony. Rest of the kittens swarmed around Tony, checking him out. Even though Tony’s whole body radiated nervousness, he still smiled and one by one picked all the other kittens onto his lap. They all remained seated, which was a miracle on itself. Steve usually had to struggle real hard in order to keep any of them still.
After everything, one thing that still hadn’t changed, though, was Walter’s resentment towards eye drops. Steve once again found himself sitting at the same table in the kitchen as always, frowning and huffing in annoyment, while trying to handle the little squirming hooligan and hold him still for the drops. It was a real struggle to try and hold Walter's head as gently as possible, and at times like these Steve started to miss Iron Man again.
“Sappy,” Tony murmured, but Steve could still feel him smile against his lips. “Now get these cats off me and help me up. We have a lot to do today.”
“-But I don’t think that Iron Man would be good for you. I mean for
Tony took a sharp breath and Steve noticed how a troubled expression flashed in his face before changing back to normal. “He’s doing just fine. He just needed some time off, that’s all,” he reassured, but that wasn’t enough for Steve.
As time went by, and Iron Man still hadn’t arrived, the little kittens started to grow restless in the box. One of them tried to climb out, but Steve stopped it gently with his hand. He had to keep them in the box. Such small animals would get lost in the large mansion. Ten minutes had already passed since the call with Iron Man. Steve knew that the man was obviously busy, and even though Iron Man’s suit of armor was most likely the most brilliant invention of their time, even he couldn’t travel at the speed of light. Still, Steve wished that he could.
Tony sighed. “Iron Man uh… He’s not feeling too well at the moment.” Steve’s heart sank a little after hearing those words. He didn’t let himself get incredibly panicked, but Iron Man not feeling well didn’t mean anything good.
Steve wanted to ask, but didn’t bother. Instead he just let Iron Man continue speaking. “I really appreciate your kind words, I do. It’s... Not something I hear everyday. But I’m not sure I know how to help you with this one.” He gestured at the box. “I like cats, sweet little animals, but I’m afraid I’ll only accidentally crush one of them with my hands.”
“Steve,” Tony whined out, “Help me. I’ve been attacked.”
“I’m sorry, I’m sorry,” he quickly apologized, “Just wanted to make sure that you were alright.”
Tony didn’t respond. Instead he looked away and brushed his hair with his other hand. Steve was growing restless. He didn't like it, when other people kept him in the dark.
Steve leaned in close and softly pecked Tony on his lips. “Into loving you.”
Steve nodded. “I know, and I’m not expecting him to be perfect.”
“Ah, well, in that case, the kittens are doing better. I took them to the vet in the morning and had all of ‘em checked out,” Steve said. He hooked one leg over the other and tried to sit down more comfortably, but noticed just in time that a kitten had crawled on its own behind his back, and Steve was close to crushing it with his back. He huffed and picked the little rascal up. The kittens were slowly proving themselves to be even more annoying than the criminals, who tried to take over New York every other week.
“Steve,” he started, then fell quiet for another second, and resumed, “Are you really sure about this? You know, Iron Man is not perfect. Far from it, actually.”
Tony cleared his throat quickly. “Iron Man used to update me and tell me everything about the kittens every day. I haven’t heard of them after he stopped his visits. Believe it or not, I really enjoyed his stories “
“What is going on with you, Shellhead?” Steve asked. He probably shouldn't have asked that, since Iron Man was always so strict about personal information, but he couldn’t help it.
But to Steve’s astonishment, the caller was not a telemarketer, but Tony Stark. It was honestly a surprise to Steve that a man as busy as Tony Stark called him in the middle of the day.
He woke up every day at 6 in the morning. He didn’t need an alarm clock, because the kittens started to demand breakfast at exactly 6 o'clock. He put some clothes on, walked in the kitchen with a trail of meowing kittens following him, gave them food, and spent an hour in the gym.
To Steve’s surprise, the kittens seemed to be completely fine with the sudden change. It was almost like they never realized that Iron Man was there with them. He figured that it was most likely due to the fact that Iron Man never had any close contact with them. Or maybe they didn’t like Iron Man, and were just glad that he was finally gone.
“Whoa, whoa, whoa. Calm down there, Capsicle,” Tony cut in. “He’s just fine. He’s just, well, sick. All he needs is a day off.”
“Right. I’ll come over immediately,” Tony announced, and that… wasn’t exactly what Steve had hoped for. He bit his lip. He didn’t mind Tony, but he just preferred Iron Man. Besides, Tony was a busy man, it would be rude of Steve to interrupt his busy life with some kittens.
Right after it seemed like Walter finally exhausted himself to the brink with the constant struggle and gave up resisting, Steve heard loud knocking, presumably coming from the mansion’s front door. He wouldn’t say that he was startled by it per se, but surprised he was for sure. It was currently 9 am and he wasn’t expecting any visitors. Jarvis was supposed to come back from his vacation in a couple of days, so it couldn’t be him. Unless something happened.
Steve was at a loss for words. “Better than Iron Man?”
“No. Actually, I’m not sure how to take care of these kittens,” Steve admitted. It felt kind of embarrassing to voice that out loud. A man like him doesn’t know how to take care of some kittens. Iron Man must be appalled. “You see, I found these little guys from an empty alleyway, inside this very same box. They seemed so sick and unfed, obviously abandoned to survive on their own. I couldn’t just leave them there to starve. I had to do something, you get me?”
Tony shrugged, already recovering from the shock of revealing his secret identity. “For now, I am. It varies. Sometimes it hurts less, sometimes it doesn’t hurt at all. Sometimes it’s so bad I can’t move. That’s why I want you to choose someone better. Someone, who’s heart isn’t on the brink of failure every second of the day.”
liked. And that wasn’t a good thing.
He gently drummed the box’s side with his fingers, while also eyeing the clock on the wall. It was half-past eleven. Steve wondered if Iron Man had run into some type of trouble on the way. It wasn’t like him to not show up.
Tony was silent for a second. “Not really. Take care of the kittens, that’ll help enough.”Steve frowned. He understood Iron Man’s need for privacy, but if he was ill, he should accept help. And Steve was more than ready to offer help. It was the least he could do at the moment.
Steve managed to find an unopened can of soup from the workshop, and after heating it up, he served it to Iron Man with a straw. He was hesitant at first, because according to him, drinking hot soup through a straw wasn’t very ideal, but later agreed to drink, after Steve pursued a little. It didn’t take long for Iron Man to empty the whole can, which to Steve just proved that he did need at least some help.
Iron Man turned his head completely towards Steve. Steve, once again, really wished that he could see Iron Man’s face. It would make things so much easier. Right now his only way of reading Iron Man was through his voice, which surprisingly didn’t give away much this time.
And then there was James. He was the smallest, as well as the sickest kitten. According to the vet, he had worms. He had to be fed dewormer regularly, but he was usually too weak to eat anything properly. Steve was worried for James. Iron Man was too. But they just had to hope for the best.
Steve bit his lip. He hadn’t honestly really thought much of the kittens, because Iron Man was the only thing in his mind. Iron Man had been the only thing in his mind the whole day. He wanted to do something. He had to do something.
Steve couldn’t see his face, but it sounded like Iron Man was slightly smiling.
, but this was something else.
“Yes.”
“Missed?" Steve asked in sudden confusion. Tony had never actually visited him or the kittens. Only Iron Man had.
Steve huffed, as Walter continued to struggle in his grip. He was more uncooperative than usual. “Do you need any help?” Iron Man asked from his side where he was watching. Steve wanted to ask Iron Man to hold Walter still for him, but he knew that Iron Man still refused to touch the kittens. It was the only thing he still refused to do.
“I appreciate your concern, but I feel like I’m making the right call. Iron Man and I have been through a lot together. To be completely honest, I feel like the time I’ve spent with Iron Man has been the best time of my life. He makes me happy, really, and less lonely. And I’d like to think that I make him feel the same way, too.
But soon enough, for his relief, he heard the front doors of the mansion open and a familiar, metallic and kind of static voice of Iron Man could be heard calling out from the hall. “Cap? Steve? Are you here?”
And so he ended up in this situation. Sitting on a sofa at the Avengers Mansion’s living room, a box full of meowing kittens on his lap.
But as it turned out, everything wasn’t as simple as Steve first thought. The first time trying to properly feed the kittens was a nightmare. He tried to feed the kittens one at a time with a syringe, but he made the mistake of sitting on the couch during feeding. He soon found himself trying to prevent three kittens from jumping on the floor from the couch, while also trying to feed one carefully. The kittens were more active than he had originally thought.
He should have gone to an actual vet, but according to the clock on the wall opposite of him, it was currently 11 PM, which meant that no veterinary was open.
It had only been a week, and everything was already chaos. Steve couldn’t count the times he had had to run after the kittens around the mansion, or prevent them from jumping a floor down from the staircase. Iron man did come by every day to check up on them and help out, and Steve didn’t know what he would do without him, but everything was still extremely complicated.
It was the last day of Walter’s eye drop treatment. To Steve's delight, his eyes had gone through a great recovery. There was no red lining, rheum, or glossiness visible anymore. It seemed like his overall condition was also getting better. More specifically, almost all of the kittens were finally starting to get better. No more shying away or leaving food uneaten. Even Charlie got more playful and now joined his siblings at play whenever he could.
Steve thought about it. He could ask Tony to wish Iron Man a speedy recovery from Steve’s behalf. Or he could update Iron Man on the kittens and their conditions. He could do that, or he could finally ask that one question that has been dwelling in his mind for a while now.
“He’s in his own home, most likely resting. It has been a rough week for him,” Tony answered and casually petted Charlie. It was a relief to hear that Iron Man was at least still alive. Steve relaxed a little.
Steve hadn’t anticipated that. He didn’t know much about machinery or things like that, but plugging yourself into an electricity source like a TV sure wasn’t the usual way to treat your bad heart. Does Tony know about this? Does he put Iron Man in danger as his bodyguard, while knowing that the man suffers from a heart condition?
“Do you want any coffee? Unfortunately Jarvis isn’t here right now, but I can brew some,” Steve proposed, as Tony sat on one of the couches in the living room, followed by Charlie, who jumped on his lap.
“Is there anything you’d like to talk about with him? I can answer some of your questions. Or I could forward a message from you to him, you know.”
On his way home, after sorting everything out, Steve had decided to deviate from the normal path home, and instead walked through an old alleway. He hadn’t thought much of it, and just wanted to change things up a little. The alleyway had been quiet. No sign of any activity could be seen. It had given Steve some time for his thoughts, which were mostly about the Avengers. After Thor, Iron Man, Giant-Man and Wasp had resigned, Steve was left with the responsibility and leadership over the whole new team. Although he wasn’t the one to usually complain about minor issues, he had to admit that managing the new team was sometimes stressful.
“Okay.”
That should have been a good enough reason for Steve to just brush off the silly feelings, because he knew that they could do nothing good. But he didn’t. Instead he dwelled on the idea of being in a relationship with Iron Man. Maybe they could make it work, even if Iron Man never revealed his identity. There must have been weirder relationships before, right?
“Aye aye, captain.”
Steve thought about it. He could leave Iron Man now, when he knew that he was alive, and not about to die. Maybe. But he still didn’t even know what was going on with Iron Man, and why he was plugged into that machine. Iron Man could be in serious pain, and just hid it really well from Steve.
are the one who brainwashed me, and these cats are trying to help me break out of it.”
Tony hummed. It didn’t look like he was experiencing any emotional turmoil anymore. It was honestly weird to see Tony as open as he was right now. There was no pretentious smile, which didn’t reach his eyes. It was still hard to fully comprehend that Tony really was Iron Man. The two of them seemed so different from each other from their manners to self-presentation.
Steve was about to reassure that he was doing fine, but paused. He was clearly in quite a jam with the kittens, and an extra pair of hands wouldn’t be that bad. Steve wasn’t the type of person to shy away from help, especially when he needed it. And to be quite honest, he was hoping to see Iron Man again. Because he was his best friend, of course.
Iron Man waved his other hand. “Ah, don’t worry about it. I was just joking.” Steve heard himself sigh in relief. Iron Man continued, “But seriously, though. What now?”
There was only one problem. Steve didn’t know how to exactly contact Iron Man. It’s not like he knew his address or phone number. He could, of course, call Tony and ask him to connect the call to Iron Man, like he did before, but he didn’t want to bother Tony too much. To be honest, it felt like he already was. But as much as Steve wanted to respect Tony’s privacy, he couldn’t shake the worry off. He had to at least know if Iron Man was still alive and kicking.
“Oh,” was the only thing Tony answered. He leaned back on the couch, still in shock, like he had just gotten the worst news of his life. Or the best. It depended on the context.
“Captain, Steve, good evening,” Mr. Stark said right after Steve answered. It sounded like he was happy, or at least smiling. Something good must have happened. Maybe that’s why he called.
When Steve picked one of the hooligans up and moved it back on a cushion, a second one jumped down and tried to explore its surroundings. One of the kittens also kept biting his hand whenever he picked it up. It didn’t hurt, but it wasn’t nice either. Is there a way to teach cats not to bite? Maybe Steve should hire a cat whisperer.
You could say that Steve was quite surprised, when he opened the door and the person behind it turned out to be none other than Tony. He had to admit that he had hoped to see Iron Man instead.
Iron Man tried to nudge one of the kittens - the smallest one - carefully with his finger, but right as he touched the little creature, it swatted his finger with its paw and hissed. Iron Man let out a little
“It’s what you get for not getting up on time. You know that after 8  the bed is for the cats, right?” Steve teased, but still lifted James off of Tony’s shoulder.
“I know this is intrusive, but do you know if I could see him again soon?”
“How sick? Normally sick people aren’t plugged into machines.”
“I just wanted to check up on you and the kittens,” Tony continued. Steve frowned. He didn’t remember telling Tony about the kittens.
“I’m sorry, was that too much?” Steve asked in a hurried voice. Maybe being blunt wasn’t the way to go after all. Tony wiped his mouth with his sleeve and shook his head. “It’s okay, it’s okay. ‘twas just unexpected, that’s all.” Steve sat back down.
“You know what I’m talking about. That machine does not look like your typical breathing machine. Just tell me what’s going on, please. I care about you. And I’m worried.”
To be completely honest, Steve only now realized how caught up on Iron Man he was, even when he was taking care of the kittens. Only now did he actually realize how much all of them had grown and changed since he first saw them. Soon enough they’d be old enough to be adopted. Steve hadn’t thought about it too much. It was obviously the right decision to give the kittens up for adoption, but secretly Steve selfishly wished that he had a chance to keep them all. He had already grown used to them running around the huge mansion, which usually felt empty.
After a moment of nothing else than just silence, Steve decided to speak again. “So is that a yes?” Tony looked at him in disbelief and kept opening and closing his mouth, trying to come up with something to say.
Steve sighed heavily and also leaned back on his couch. Dorothy jumped right next to him and he petted her slightly, but didn’t take his eyes off of Tony. He was trying to figure Tony out. There was something going on, something much deeper and complicated than Tony let him know. Steve wasn’t going to let that stop him.
The only kitten still in bad shape was James, but he was getting there. Steve had to pay some extra attention to him which, of course, was starting to again tire him out, but he didn’t bother to ask for any help anymore. He’d be lying if he said that he hadn’t gotten a little attached to these kittens.
When keeping Walter still proved itself to be too tough of a task, Steve sighed in defeat. “Could you bring me a blanket? Or a towel? Or anything to wrap around this little rascal?”
“Right,” Steve said and picked up Dorothy from the floor in order to stop her from tearing up his socks with her teeth. This seemed like the perfect opportunity to ask about Iron Man, and so Steve took it. “You know, I’ve been actually meaning to ask about Iron Man and his condition.”
After cautiously approaching the box and looking inside it, Steve had seen a litter of kittens. There were five of them, to be exact, differing in size and colors. They looked quite filthy, obviously abandoned. Some of them were just laying at the dirty bottom of the box, but two of them had noticed Steve and started to meow continuously, demanding attention. At that moment Steve knew what he had to do. He couldn’t just leave them there.
He drummed his fingers anxiously against a table right next to him, while waiting for Tony to answer. At first he didn’t expect an answer. Usually Tony answered the phone fast, and didn’t keep anyone waiting, but now he took his time. But Steve just kept waiting for him, even after a couple of minutes had passed.
Iron Man looked around the room, and then picked up a cloth from the floor. Steve hadn’t even noticed it before, which now felt kind of foolish, if he was being completely honest. “Thank you,” Steve murmured, as Iron Man handed him the cloth. “Anytime,” he responded.
Suddenly one of the kittens, a white one with orange patches, decided to start making noise again. It rose up to its back feet and tried to reach out for something. Honestly, it looked like it was trying to reach out for Iron Man. Or at least to Steve it did. Steve and Iron Man both looked at it, as it tried to claw its way out of the box. It was probably hungry. Steve wished he knew what little kittens ate. The smallest ones drink milk, of course, but when does it stop? How old were these kittens anyway? Their eyes were already open, but didn’t tell much.
Tony shook his head and gently pet Charlie. “No need, I’ve already had enough coffee today.”
Steve stood up and gently set Walter down on the floor with his siblings. He skipped over Dorothy, who was once again trying to attack his feet, and calmly yet cautiously walked to the door. He heard small footsteps from behind him as some of the kittens followed him.
‘You’ll be fine, kid,’ Tony assures him as they finally leave the city limits and start heading upstate. ‘Just be yourself and try not to get too nervous. Now tell me what’s been happening at school until we get there.’
‘Shut up!’ Peter hisses in reply. ‘Are you trying to get me skinned alive?’
Peter since yesterday and we have no idea what’s happening after that last Elemental attacked in Prague?’
a food fight before?’ Peter asks.
‘I swear to you Hammer,’ Steve growls, Brooklyn accent nearly as thick as Bucky’s ‘when I get hold of you, you’re going to wish you’d stayed dead the first time.’
Love always,
‘Hmm…I shall look through the rest of your mind if you are prepared?’
Everything is going pretty well so far. Everyone’s making a fuss of the Barton children, and Clint’s finally meeting Peter properly.
‘What the fu-’
‘I am Groot,’ he repeats, this time with additional branch made scenes.
‘Anything except sleep with me,’ he can just make out Peter’s mumble. Steve groans next to him and Tony pats him on the shoulder. Poor Steve probably doesn’t want to be involved with this conversation, but Tony’s going to find it hilarious. Whilst obviously being very supportive to his inebriated, under-age, basically adopted son and protégé.
Natasha watches as Peter nods; then he sets his jaw and looks up to face his mentor and she knows they’re all in trouble. She’s seen that look before. On both Tony and Steve. ‘Oh this is going to be interesting,’ she says, moving back to stand with Bucky.
‘Half responsible,’ Loki corrects him. ‘I believe it was the three of you decided it was a crime that I hadn’t tried it. Apparently there was good reason behind it.’
‘Tony please,’ Bucky pleads, falling to his knees and gripping his head. ‘Stop, I don’t want to hurt you. Please.’ But Tony ignores him and, eventually, he reaches the end of the ten word sequence.
‘Are you two done being all mopey yet?’ Rocket asks, appearing next to them and taking a seat on Bruce’s other side before taking something out of his bag and starting to tinker with it.
‘If your little protégé would pick up his calls I wouldn’t have to,’ Fury snaps, then sighs and rubs his forehead.
‘Lucky for me or I’d have had a weight in my face,’ he mutters.
‘Thank the Allfathers. I was about to commit regicide,’ she breathes a sigh of relief.
‘Well we’ve worked out these guys are morons,’ Shuri jabs a thumb towards Bruce and Tony and Steve tries very hard not to laugh at the offended look on Tony’s face.
‘Stark, move out of the way,’ the Secretary orders. ‘We are here to arrest Steven Rogers on charges of treason. The rest of your little
There’s a pounding in his head that is similar to the beat on one of Tony’s tracks that usually plays in the workshop.
‘Pretty sure you just did, but you can ask me another one.’
‘Right. We’ll get him transferred and have an actual
Baby Boy,’ he gives a small laugh. ‘Thank you.’
‘He’s fine,’ he can hear Bucky’s metal arm waving around.
‘What? Winter Warrior? That is your title is it not? Similar to Tony’s Iron Man, and Peter’s Spider-Man?’
‘What the hell?’ Steve asks, looking at his friend, who simply shrugs in reply. He’s still getting used to seeing Bucky walking around looking as fit as ever, albeit with a metal arm attached to him. A metal arm that, true to Tony’s word, is functioning as well as a regular one, if not a little better. Steve’s got the bruises from sparring practise to testify.
‘Just as long as it makes some form of sense,’ Sam grumbles.
Rhodes and Sam he catches by the breakfast bar, where no one had realised one sprig had been hidden amongst the glasses rack above them.
‘I don’t give a fuck what the balloon animal wannabe says,’ I snap. ‘I’ll die. I’ll come back. Now give me the fucking gauntlet before Thanos kills everyone!’
‘By taking the blame publicly for it,’ Pepper says, stepping forwards, ‘he’s taken the pressure off of all of you.’
Bucky shakes his head in answer to Tony’s question. ‘Something feels….’
‘So easy,’ the older woman laughs as comprehension dawns on Peter’s face.
Steve shakes his head, a look of surprise on his face. ‘No… how did you know?’
Steve reaches over and takes his hand, rubbing circles on the back with his thumb. ‘If there isn’t I’ll get you some. And when this is done, we’ll spend a whole day in bed.’
Bucky snorts. ‘Like you could. Come on, Spider-Man, let’s see what Mommy Spider’s been teaching you.’
‘Don’t forget the chillis, Baby Boy.’
‘This is payback for swearing at you all the other week, isn’t it?’ he mutters.
Sam narrows his eyes at the teenager. ‘Is that Flash still giving you trouble?’
Rhodes chuckles. ‘Just as long as I can DJ so I don’t get pulled onto the dancefloor I’d say I agree with that suggestion.’
‘It’s not about being productive,’ Peter’s head appears above them, and Tony’s heart does a little lurch in fright before his brain catches up and reminds him the kid can stick to ceilings and will not fall. ‘It’s about taking time to appreciate those around you and making time for family and friends that you wouldn’t normally see during the year.’
‘Let’s hope they’re not as enthusiastic as he is about Pop Tarts,’ Natasha says with a smile as they’re joined by Wanda and Vision.
'I'd throw more than a book at you if you tried to make me feel better,' Peter mumbles, wondering just what the soldier had tried to do.
Loki puts a hand to his head and groans. ‘Perhaps I was not as recovered as I believed,’ he admits, ‘but they will have reached their destination. It just took a little more out of me than I anticipated.’
‘Yeah,’ he sighs, rubbing his temples as Fury ends their call, his face disappearing from the screen, ‘yeah I do.’
‘What? Sell you to Hydra? Why not?’ the man laughs. ‘This one especially would fetch the highest price. A safety blanket if you will against the Avengers.’ Peter feels fingers reaching under the back of his mask. ‘What’s say we take a look at the little superhero, and find out just who it is that seems to have caught Iron Man’s interest?’
‘What-’
‘You still haven’t told me who you are,’ Wanda glares at her. ‘And I’ll never help HYDRA.’
‘Yeah but she obviously felt it was worth the risk,’ Steve replies. ‘I hear they continued working closely together, she must have found his multiple languages useful; I hear he learned more after the war.’
Loki just smiles and shakes his head fondly. Each visit it gets harder to leave this group of miscreants behind as their bonds strengthen.
‘And he came from the mind stone that was inside of Loki’s sceptre, or at least in some way he did? Well the sceptre had been owned by HYDRA, Loki
‘What for? Not for asking me to come in? Tony you know I don’t mind-’
As always here's your sneak peek:
‘What do you mean “they’ve got people down here”?’ Natasha’s heart drops.
‘That looks genuinely terrifying,’ Betty mumbles next to Peter, looking over the assault course. She looks at him out of the corner of her eye, leaning closer and whispers. ‘Can you do that by yourself?’
‘Not-’
‘I’m pretty sure we should be taking this more seriously if he’s actually got a psycho fan stalking him,’ Rhodes points out, finally calming down enough.
Tony sighs. ‘And a shit ton of cookies, FRI.’
‘Hulk not stupid,’ is his response.
‘NO!’ he cries, upon seeing the figure clutched in Thanos’ non-gauntleted hand. He’s moving before anyone can stop him, because he will not let one of his people die because of his orders.
,’ Bucky mumbles. Steve chuckles behind him and Tony shoots him a look.
‘Pete,’ Tony sighs, ‘you know I’d say he could spend it here with us. But he doesn’t know who you are outside of Spider-Man, and you’d have to show him May too. Do you trust him enough to tell him who you are and who your family is?’
Loki looks up over the top of the book at him, one eyebrow raised. ‘Are you speaking to me?’
‘Nothing you need concern yourself with, Stark,’ Strange’s stare is hard. ‘And you need not worry we will be able to help defend against Thanos.’
The soldier takes a deep breath, then looks straight into his eyes, the blue ones filled with pain. ‘Tony, the doctors aren’t sure they can remove it. When they put it in… when they put it in they apparently caused a lot of damage to the structure of your chest. They think- they think if they were to take it out, your chest may collapse. Tony taking it out could kill you.’ He finishes on a whisper.
The Yule Feast begins; the team decide on a new Christmas Eve tradition; and Valkyrie bonds with Nebula
They continue along the line, with Strange’s team consisting of Peter, Loki, Clint, Tony, Bucky, Rocket, Nebula, Bruce, Thor, Scott and Drax. Wanda’s team made up of Natasha, Wade, Valkyrie, Steve, Sam, Carol, Quill, Rhodes, Hope, Mantis and Groot.
‘What’s wrong with it?’ he asks.
Strange nods. ‘We’re not coming out of this unscathed,’ he warns.
'Pretty sure it's impossible for him not to come back in one piece,' Peter rolls his eyes.
Strange frowns at him. ‘What do you mean?’
teaching any of the dances. Get the idea out of your head.’
‘I’m sure you do,’ Bucky growls, standing up and glaring at the hologram.
There’s a pause before Peter’s voice, sounding very small, comes through the ear piece. ‘It’s just… every time something big happens all I seem to do is screw up.’
‘Why not?’ Bruce asks.
one of them, Quill. No arguments.’
They’d landed on this planet, Thanos’ retirement plan as it had been lovingly referred to, the original six Avengers, with Rhodey, Carol, Rocket and Nebula alongside them, and faced Thanos. The gauntlet he’d used to harness the power of the stones was fused to his arm and he’d been about to use it once more: to destroy the stones and any hope they had of reversing his snap. Unfortunately there had also been the remnants of his army with him.
Which really, Tony doesn’t need to know any more than that. He lifts the glass to his lips and gulps it down without a second thought. Surprisingly it’s got a nice taste, as opposed to what he was imagining. It slides down his throat easily and then pools in his stomach, a wonderful warm feeling spreading out slowly from his belly to his extremities; as it travels through his system he feels all tiredness and sickness being driven out. By the time Loki comes back he’s feeling the best he’s felt in months.
I am. I don’t care what destiny has written for me; I will make my own destiny. I will find a way to harness my powers and I’ll destroy myself before I destroy those closest to me.’ Wanda can feel her magic flowing around her, her hair whipping around her face. ‘And I will not let you try and use me to hurt them again.’ She wraps Agatha in her magic and sends her plummeting to the floor.
‘There you go then,’ Valkyrie raises her tankard. ‘To the ones we loved and lost.’
‘You have nothing to apologise for, Thor,’ Loki’s voice is low, ‘it is this group who shall be sorry they have touched our friends. The full wrath of Asgard
‘Clint can you buy us some time?’ he asks.
He takes his shot and waits before its Peter’s turn again before replying. ‘I didn’t get chance before I left and I forgot my charger. I was getting Weasel to charge it so I could call you.’ He frowns at the brown-eyed teenager moving past him. ‘What’s
Loki tries his best not to jump, but from the smirk on Bucky’s face he’s certain he failed. ‘Will you stop sneaking up on me?’
Nakia joins them. ‘We are taking you all to the Wakandan Embassy,’ she explains, ‘we’ve sent people to collect your belongings from your hotel rooms. You’ll be safer there and, I imagine, be better able to relax knowing you are among friends and are well guarded.’
‘Certainly not,’ Strange responds, ‘I speak for myself. You are trespassing in this city and on this planet.’
‘I swear it’s never been this hard to find a tree for inside before,’ Bucky says as they finish chopping down the last of their outside trees; Steve had stopped them at five, pointing out they needed to save some for other people. Bucky had still insisted on one huge tree, though, saying it was now a tradition for them. Sam thinks Quill is slightly worried about how they’re going to decorate though.
‘Wakanda would certainly be more willing, and more able, to help and support the team under the new conditions,’ T’Challa agrees. ‘However with my role as king of Wakanda I do not think it would be a good idea for me to be one of the nominated leaders as there could be a conflict of interests.’
version,’ he argues, ‘it’s
‘When I was little,’ he continues, eyes never leaving the gun, ‘just after I’d started making things I got hold of one of Dad’s guns. I took it into my room and modified it, then gave it to her when she next visited. Dad was livid,’ he gives a weak chuckle, ‘it was one of his favourite guns. Mom wouldn’t let him take it back though.’
‘Better to be safe than sorry,’ Bucky nods. ‘We’re staying.’
‘-can you stop interrupting me to ask questions about unimportant parts of this story please? Anyway as I was saying I was trying to jump back to the present and something went wrong. Instead of ending up back in the present in the flat I shared with Cable and the others, I was in a flat here all by myself, one that I recognised though because I’d shared it with Vanessa. So I thought maybe I’d got the dates wrong on that thing you know? But when I checked I was here on the correct date; and then I realised the device was broken again. So I thought: hey why not find Negasonic again and see if she can fix it and tell me what the hell happened. Maybe I’d changed stuff in the past and things were all fine here now you know? But Negasonic wasn’t at Xavier’s school, because Xavier’s school didn’t exist. So then I went to find Weasel and I was talking about stuff he didn’t have a clue about. He didn’t know who Colossus was, who the X-Men are, nothing. Then he was talking about stuff that
‘What the
-Must you think so loudly?- a familiar voice demands. –My headache is bad enough as it is without you contributing as well.-
‘You never learnt to play have you?’
‘Can we eat now? I’m starving!’ Peter complains. ‘I know I definitely had bigger portions than May and Stewart, but I’ve definitely got used to eating more here.’
‘Time to make some chimichangas!’
‘Baby Boy? You alright? Do you need-’
Alright he’s got her there. ‘How’s May?’ she asks instead.
‘What is it?’ he hears a familiar voice snap and looks over to where the Cloak is now trying to get Doctor Strange’s attention.
‘Wanda,’ she tries not to wince at the note of hurt in his voice, ‘you know you can trust me.’
‘Am I not allowed to be genuinely curious? Besides this has just come out of the blue!’ Bucky addresses his statement to Peter, rather than to him and Loki resists the urge to smirk. He needs to not provoke the team if he is to stay here.
‘Tony’s with him,’ he reassures her, helping her stand from the bench she’d been forced to stay on since the paramedics arrived.
‘Get the hell away from my family,’ she snarls at the alien, her magic snatching the hammer from its hands and sending it smashing into its master’s head. The alien slumps down motionless in front of them.
‘What do you think I’ve been doing for the best part of a year, Rhodey? How the hell do you think everyone is sitting here in this room right now?’
‘You say you haven’t really thought much about how your extra sense works, Peter,’ Steve ignores the others and starts to explain, ‘so we need to start looking into it. If something happens and you can’t trust your other senses then this might be the only thing you can rely on.’
Peter elbows Harry surreptitiously in the side when the other boy starts to cough to cover a laugh. ‘Sure you don’t want to try instead Harry?’ he glares at his friend.
‘I’d say it’s the opposite,’ Steve argues, and the other man nods.
A/N: Hi everyone. I'm giving you a double update this week as this is a bit of a slow chapter!
Valkyrie shrugs. ‘Would you have wanted her to shut herself off from everyone just because you weren’t there?’
‘Tony we’re not running
Thank you so much to everyone who has stuck with this story, and for all your support!
, Thor, and he’s on his own.’
Tony puts his arm through Steve’s. ‘Wouldn’t have it any other way.’
‘Come on Wanda you can do better than that,’ the older woman says as she loses her balance and nearly goes flying to the floor. ‘Where’s your head today?’
‘Touché,’ he chuckles. ‘I promise these are only filled with a new harmless powder. I made it after our last mishap so that it’s easy to see the effectiveness whilst we test them.’
‘He’s not going to tell anyone, he’s just having fun winding me up,’ Peter tells Matt.
Steve winks at him then follows the steps that Peter had outlined, slowly making his way towards him; Peter feels the platform dip suddenly just as Steve launches himself backwards, catapulting him upwards to easily grab hold of the bars. He just had time to look down and see Steve running towards him before the soldier jumps, reaching out his arm.
One night, Steve woke up from a dream. He wasn’t sure what time it was currently, but the whole bedroom was pitch black. All of the five kittens were sleeping right next to him, some next to his feet and some right next to his pillow. They were curled up, breathing slowly. Steve wasn’t, because his heart was racing.
“Let’s see what I can find.”
As it turned out, Iron man hadn’t eaten anything yet. He was feeling too ill. It honestly shocked Steve, when he found out that the only thing Iron Man had done the whole day, was just sitting by that machine, plugged in.
There had been a bank robbery alert last evening, and Steve had been the one to respond to that. It was an above average situation. Some fellas had somehow gotten highly dangerous weapons to their possession, and had quite literally melted the door of the bank vault off. There was a lot of cleaning up to do in the aftermath, but fortunately the incident did not escalate too far.
After the visit, Steve had gotten a list of all the things he should keep in mind, while taking care of the kittens. It was a long list, and kittens needed a lot of care, but Steve was confident that he knew what to do. The instructions were clear.
After Walter had bitten Steve enough and exhausted himself, he just decided to lay down on the table. Steve took this as an opportunity to look at the other kittens on the kitchen floor. Steve had noticed that ever since their conditions had gone for the better, their personalities had also begun to grow more individual. Dorothy was more playful, and liked to bite everything. Steve had woken up many times from his sleep at night, because Dorothy liked to chew on his nose. Charlie was the opposite of Dorothy. He was the easiest one to manage, because he slept most of the day. Charlie especially liked to curl up right next to Iron Man, which was quite sweet in Steve’s opinion. Ethel was the only kitten, who hadn’t gotten used to humans. She dodged touch and tried to squirm away every time she was picked up. Unlike Charlie, Ethel didn’t like Iron Man at all.
“I thought you were busy?” Steve remarked. He didn’t want to waste Iron Man’s time. Knowing him, whatever he was doing before this was certainly important. Or, at least more important than Steve and his box full of kittens.
If only Steve could see Iron Man. Then he could confront his emotions head on, and maybe actually make some sense out of them.
“Steve,” Tony murmured, but didn’t say anything else, although it looked like he did want to.
“Good morning. What brings you here today?” Steve asked and winced a little, as Dorothy bit his foot in protest. Her teeth had grown and were sharper than they looked. Almost like nails.
Tony has fought off Steve and got Peter to himself down in the workshop; they’re working on the old Mark II suit that he’d given the teenager for his birthday. Peter’s body is currently half hidden by the suit as he has a look at the de-icing system that is situated in the back of the torso.
‘Boss, Sergeant Barnes is currently sitting in the kitchenette with a bottle of whiskey and a gun on the side in front of him,’ FRIDAY’s voice interrupts Tony’s train of thought just as he’s reaching a ‘eureka’ moment with an improvement to his flight navigation system.
‘Just do it, Ned!’ he says, pulling off his shirt and toeing off his shoes as he searches for his suit. He hears Ned talking to the merc and hanging up just as he finds it and, taking off his jeans, pulls it on up to his waist and shoves his clothes in his backpack.
‘Good enough for me,’ he says with a smile. ‘Now come on I need to get something for Vis before we head back.’
The rest of the Guardians who don’t know the songs go to stand with the residents, and Tony sees Mantis’ antennae glowing as she goes to each one, perhaps offering some comfort as they continue to make their way through the carols on the sheet.
‘Wanda literally turned up with a new outfit after facing Agatha,’ Hope points out, ‘and Strange and her were acting like she’s a ticking time bomb, yet neither of them know enough of what the Scarlet Witch is to know what to do next. And the only one who knows anything disappeared after the shapeshifter got her out from under our noses.’
A/N: Hello everyone! Thank you so much to everyone who has read this entire story and come on this journey with me. It has been absolutely incredible and I've really enjoyed reading all your comments along the way. Please do let me know what you think of these last two chapters and where you think the series is going to go. Any predictions from this epilogue?
The closest he can come to describing it is like a bat’s sonar reading you see on films and TV; it’s not quite a clear as that, but it’s the best comparison he can come up with. He wonders if this is how Matt fights and makes a note to ask the vigilante when he next runs into him. Or just to text him later.
Whatever insult he is about to say is drowned out by the ominous rumbling sound coming from around them. Steve looks up to see a crack forming in the ceiling. ‘Look out!’ he shouts, pulling Bucky back as the ceiling begins to collapse. Luckily there’s an exit down a tunnel just behind them and they manage to get far enough down it to be safe.
Giggling cuts off Tony’s retort and they look to the hallway to see Wanda arriving with a red faced Peter, who promptly drops his bags by the entrance and comes over to drop next to Tony on the sofa with an exaggerated: ‘You are the worst person in the world!’ at Wanda.
‘I’m not sure I’ve forgiven myself.’
‘Not to my face.’
‘Course I am, Steve’ll be too busy to notice and we’re not going to get through enough to get you drunk if it took a couple of bottles of Vodka last time.’
‘Please take it,’ Tony repeats when they pull apart, still so close together that Steve can feels his lips moving against his own. Steve nods, looking down and taking the band from Tony’s hand and slipping it back on his finger. ‘Steve?’
Peter looks away from Sam. ‘All I ever do is make more problems for him.’
‘Only just got in,’ he answers. She pulls back, a huge grin on her face, and holds up her left hand. ‘Congratulations!’ he says, pulling her back into a tight hug.
‘That’s what he told me, but I don’t really believe it,’ Peter responds.
‘I am Groot.’
‘We should look at the new agreement,’ Sam suggests, ‘take a day or two to look over them and come up with any questions, then we can decide if we’re going to go ahead. It’s not exactly going to be an easy road.’
‘One more step and I’ll put a bullet through his brain,’ a voice Peter doesn’t recognise says. He tries to turn his head to take a look but the gun presses harder into his head. ‘Don’t even think about it. Hands on your head, Spider-Man. You even think about webbing anything and I’ll blow a hole in your skull.’
driver, but I have yet to have an accident in a car I modified.’ As he opens his mouth again Tony waves for him to forget it. ‘So come on it can’t just be my driving, otherwise you wouldn’t have said anything about it.’
and you know last time I’d met most of them I was helping fight them. Yeah I did tell you about that it was when I went to Germany. Anyway it was all like super awkward at first, then Wanda came up and gave me this huge hug to thank me for saving her life. Which totally overplaying what I did by the way.
(See the end of the chapter for
‘I have FRIDAY recording everything from the minute I leave the facility,’ he explains. ‘You can do the same if you want, but I thought this would save some of your privacy.’
‘Boys versus Girls,’ Natasha’s grin is predatory. She, Valkyrie, Shuri and Carol are still standing for the girls; Loki, Bucky, Thor and Steve for the boys.
‘I’m not sure whether I’m scared or intrigued,’ Sam says.
The other man shrugs helplessly, holding out a cardboard box to him. ‘Tacos?’
I was getting a marriage proposal from Death? Cool!
‘It looks like a wolf,’ Loki says quietly.
Steve admits this is probably the best idea. They’ve rented out the whole of the registry office to hold the ceremony so it’s just the Avengers and a couple of additional friends that are here, all dressed in their finest. Even Nebula has changed into something less combat worthy for the event, which Steve is strangely touched by; next to her Gamora looks stunning in a skin-tight dress that he’s pretty sure is the reason Quill is drooling.
and Clint’s lost the knife in his hand to Peter.
Before Peter can reply his senses go haywire and he feels something pressing into the back of his head through the mask. The merc’s eyes go wide and he scrambles to his feet.
‘Hey I’ve been waiting for you to get hitched for a hundred years,’ Bucky protests. ‘Do you know how long I’ve been writing this best man speech?’
Apparently mollified the teacher takes up their supposed topic of discussion with the rest of the class.
‘What do you mean?’ Natasha asks him.
‘Can I hear what it is first?’
‘When they went in the owner greeted Tony like an old friend, and then made such a fuss of Wanda I hear she nearly cried. She told me the owner gave her a free slice of cake and sat with them and asked all about her time at the facility. She even joked that she needed to tell her if Tony was being too hard on her and she’d sit him down and set him straight. When they came back it was as if a dark cloud had been taken away from her. They stop there on their way back from every demonstration now, and she’s taken me there several times.’
. I told you you’re nephew is an incredible kid, Ms Parker, and I meant it. I promise I’ll do all I can to keep him safe.’
‘You barely know what day it is, how is this surprising?’
‘The suit hasn’t repaired itself! When are you going to let Tony-’
‘I think that if anyone can do it, Sergeant Barnes can,’ Tony replies. ‘He’s continuing working with the team as we speak.’
‘And who would you suggest this neutral party is?’ Ross sneers.
‘FRIDAY do you know where Peter is?’
‘Mind the volume, munchkin,’ Tony says, ‘Pete’s got sensitive hearing.’
Tony bursts out laughing. ‘As much as I appreciate the offer I don’t think you want to be talking to a teenager about his sex life.’
‘Uh…well, Steve you see-’
‘Can I see a pass?’ Peter can hear the soldier at the gate ask the driver, despite being at the back of the bus.
‘I know everyone else is as scared as I am, and in a way that makes it better, because I know I’m not alone. Even if we
‘You look more like an ice sculpture than a walking nightmare,’ Peter says, walking closer to the god. ‘Looks kind of cool if you ask me.’
! No I am not going to date her, why would you even suggest that? Because she’s going out with Vision is pretty high on that list, and I’ve only met her like a couple of times. Ok seriously this is why I don’t talk to you about girls.’
The three of them walk along the tarmac to join Vision and then they make their way to the car. Rhodes and Bucky sit in the back, while Vision rides shotgun with Tony. As he turns the key in the ignition he looks in the rear view mirror. ‘For the love of all things holy, Rhodey, get those damn things off of him.’
‘I think we should do this more often,’ she grins, counting the notes she’s won as Peter lines up for a break.
‘Fine then I get Bucky,’ Sam says.
make you ache,’ Sam grumbles as he sinks into the couch with a sigh.
‘Maybe, that would explain why he was so wary about giving you information. If you thought he was just doing it as a way to get revenge on an individual would you have let him go?’
Feeling her panic ebb away, she opens her eyes again and looks over at the man next to her, brow furrowed in thought.
For six months Tony has worked non-stop on getting the Accords changed into something that he hoped Steve and the others could live with. Or at least come back and help him change more. He’d argued, he’d bargained, he’d
‘Wanda? That you?’ his tongue feels too big in his mouth and the words are a little slurred but he thinks they’re intelligible.
‘I resent that, Snowflake!’
‘Oh and can you start teaching me other languages? Like I know Spanish but I think I’d like to know more, just think it’d be really useful.’
‘I mean, this is only on the understanding that you’re still happy with all this, Baby Boy; because I am more than happy to turn around and go back to my apartment. Jack and Daniel are still waiting for me and there’s plenty of Christmas movies to get through.’
* * * * * * * *
‘So every one of you bastards has one of those things on then?’ Tony asks, relieved when he spots tendrils of red light creeping around the straps on the front of Peter’s vest. ‘And the others are supposed to set theirs off if yours goes off am I right?’
‘Hey, it looks worse than it is,’ he tries to reassure her with a smile, but she can feel the pain he’s in.
‘Well he didn’t greet me with a “fuck me” at any rate. Unfortunately.’
He sighs, takes hold of the man’s wrist and, in a move Natasha had got him to perfect a couple of weeks ago, has the burly man pinned down against the bar with his arm twisted up behind him. ‘Don’t even try it,’ he says, releasing the man and hopping back up on the stool. He turns back to Weasel. ‘Believe me when I say you’re not going to get me to leave?’
Peter and Ned look up from the floor of Peter’s living room where they’re busy building a couple of tie fighters to go with the Lego Death Star they’d finished months ago. On the TV Tony looks calm as always.
He can feel Loki’s surprise and indecision.
,’ he mutters to Matt.
As always here's your sneak peek:
‘Yeah? Join the club,’ Clint grunts. ‘Where are you?’
‘Hey Pete,’ Ned grins. ‘How awesome is this?’
‘This time,’ Fury says as they enter the main room of the suite of rooms again, ‘I’ve got you a little more backup.’ He gestures to the woman sitting next to him. ‘This is Monica Rambeau from SWORD and I have just put her in charge of a new team whose primary focus for now is to hunt down any HYDRA agents.’
Peter reasons as he eases his window open and crawls in; dropping down in the centre of the room he allows himself a rebellious thought.
‘Have they finished yet?’ Vision asks as he rises through the floor behind the two soldiers.
Wanda finds the strength to raise her head and meet Agatha’s gaze, behind the other woman she sees the first symbol starting to appear. ‘Don’t you remember your first lesson?’ she asks the other woman. ‘In a given space, only the witch that cast the runes can use her magic.’
‘Mr Stark-’
Natasha opens her mouth to say something when the roar of a jetpack has them looking up. Sam flies over the top of the facility and lands right in front of the gathered crowd just as the last person steps off the bus.
‘They should be getting everyone. We’ll, uh, we’ll be there in a minute Tin Can.’
‘I take it that’s the guy in charge?’ Bucky asks him.
Tony, running on minimal sleep, lacking in full strength coffee, and trying to push back all the memories and feelings being back in the old house is bringing back, is not in a peacekeeping mood.
‘They care about you, Petey-Pie, so I’m sure you can cope. I know I can.’
All my love,
‘Where’s Loki?’ the inventor asks.
‘You’re such a party killer,’ Tony mock-glares at his friend. ‘Fine! Let’s go get in the car. Make sure you’ve got all your stuff, kiddies.’
‘Calm down, Spider,’ Natasha says. ‘Most of the time you’re not looking when you dodge hits in training anyway, you’re focussing too much on not being able to see.’
‘A little loose but nothing a belt won’t fix- ow! Give a guy some warning,’ Wade grumbles as the aforementioned item of clothing hits him in the chest. ‘You know I’m still kind of getting used to the fact that very few of you seem bothered by my scars. There’s not many people would let me try on new clothes around them.’
‘Not without EDITH,’ he shakes his head, ‘Beck’s tech is advanced, but before he had access to EDITH he was limited to smaller scale illusions.’
‘Honestly, Tony. From being the guy who said he’d never have kids, you’ve sure decided to adopt a few without their consent. You’ve already got Wanda and Peter, any more you want to pull out the woodwork on us? Maybe we should be getting Clint to name you godfather to their next kid,’ Rhodes teases.
‘Loki, Thor and Valkyrie still look at it as an extension of their Yule celebrations,’ Peter adds as he jumps down to join them, ‘and that’s very different to what we celebrate it as. Just look at it as an excuse to study human behaviour and decide if it’s something you want to join in with in the future.’
‘Tony took a hit, but aside from acting like a baby over it he’s fine,’ Natasha smirks.
Loki blinks away his thoughts and nods with a smile. Once he sees Tony’s shoulders relax he darts forwards, gently cupping the inventor’s face in one hand and presses his lips to Tony’s as the inventor opens them on a gasp of surprise. He tries to hide the satisfied smile when he feels Tony’s hands clutch the front of his shirt, and the small pleased noise he makes before he pulls away.
‘It’ll take you down as well,’ Tony points out.
again after losing Gamora and I just…’
‘That’s not going to happen,’ Steve responds.
‘What-’
‘You can’t blame me for that!’ she protests, laughing as he regains his feet and gives chase.
‘Alright shut up.’
‘Think you might want to leave now,’ Weasel suggests, ‘we don’t take kindly to people trying to poke their noses into our business.’
‘That’s not going away any time soon is it?’ she sighs.
‘Steve are you having a freak out over coffee?’ she asks incredulously.
mask on!’
Wade puts a dramatic hand to his heart. ‘I was suggesting we do some sparring, Spidey, you need to get your mind out of the gutter. Honestly! Perhaps
‘He started it!’
Steve stop him from walking past and says quietly, ‘I mean it, Tony. No one’s splitting us up again.’
In answer Tony pulls him in for another kiss, running his tongue along the soldier’s lips, begging for entry. Steve complies with a small laugh and shifts further up the bed to pull Tony closer against him, the hand on the back of his head running down his neck and back to rest on his waist. For his part all Tony can do is grip the broad shoulders like Steve is his lifeline.
'What's up Nat?' he asks taking the tablet from her and frowning down at it.
Peter presses his knee against Wade’s under the table. It was the one question he’d been too nervous to ask himself, knowing how self-conscious the merc was about them. Wanda catches his eye, and turns to her boyfriend. ‘Vis, I don’t think we should-’
‘It was pretty impressive,’ Hope says from her place next to Scott, ‘even better than anything I pulled on Hank.’
‘This is true. But my point still stands. All of this that happened? This is not because you are a terrible person, Tony, it’s because of other people’s greed.’
‘There’s no cameras in our bedrooms,’ Tony hastily adds. ‘But she is able to monitor vitals and sound, so you do have privacy. She tends to only pay attention to sound from your room if it sounds like you’re in trouble or if you’re asking her for something.’
Loki gives a long suffering sigh. ‘He decided to accept Valkyrie’s challenge to a drinking contest. There’s plenty on the stove if anyone else needs some.’
‘It’s closed up.’
Tony manages two calls before his lungs protest and he starts to cough after he hangs up on his conversation with Stark Industries’ top legal team. He gasps, reaching for the glass of water on his table, but sends it flying, the water spilling out over the table top; tears start to cloud his vision as he struggles to catch his breath.
‘Just trust me bird brain, I’ll get the sweaters sorted. Who do we need for?’
‘I’ll keep them in line, honey,’ Steve assures him, ‘and Wanda will make sure Deadpool is still in one piece.’
‘We’re not sure,’ August admits, looking over his shoulder briefly. ‘That’s partly what we’re hoping Mr Laufeyson will be able to tell us. To think: we actually had alien writing in our site! No will believe it!’
He tries some breathing exercises that Frigga had taught him when he first started learning magic to calm his racing mind, but his thoughts were in such turmoil that he wasn’t even able to pinpoint what was causing him such distress. Raising a hand in front of him he starts creating small ice sculptures in his palm, bringing the ice back into his veins to create another one. He finds it finally helps to calm his mind so that, when a knock comes on his door, he is not quite as irritated as he perhaps should have been.
‘-and two,’ Wade’s voice becomes soft and he pulls Peter in for a brief kiss, ‘I
‘Perhaps you would have done, had you not had my number on divert,’ the man himself answers as he enters the kitchen.
‘Not exactly,’ Daredevil replies. ‘It seems Deadpool is just being his usual irritating self. Me on the other hand, I asked him to let me know when you were moving against HYDRA. I wanted to make sure none got away, I don’t need them establishing even more of a foothold in this city. That was the agreement we made when I said I’d help him try and find out where Tony Stark was being kept.’
