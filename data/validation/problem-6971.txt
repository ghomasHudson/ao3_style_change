“But he’s just standing there,” Peter says as he points out the window. Steve looks over the back of the couch.
It’s quiet in the house and both men are exhausted from the day. Tony feels a pressure building on top of his head. It’s dimly lit and they can barely see each other’s shadowy figures. The refrigerator is humming, the large clock on the walk is steadily ticking away.
“We’ve lived here since we got married many years ago. We remember a lot of the families that lived in that house,” Marie says as she pours herself another cup of coffee.
Tony groans and rolls away from them. Steve scoots to the edge of the bed and Peter climbs off of him. “Let’s leave the room and let Daddy get some more sleep.”
Steve doesn’t hesitate and pulls over as soon as it’s clear to do so. Peter was still crying hard and showing no signs of calming down. Tony climbs into the backseat, unbuckles Peter and pulls him into his arms. Letting him cry against him.
Steve is using all his self control to hold back and not say, if you loved me you would do this. It’s a phase that never ends well. The ultimatum where you hope they’ll choose you but it’s a losing battle. The other person will walk away and leave you in pieces. He had been alone since he was eighteen he knew how to manage. How to get through life without depending on anyone else. Something hurt deep in his chest, in his throat. If he pushed Tony too far would he just leave? Take their son and leave Steve to be alone again? He couldn’t raise Beverly on his own. If he was going to do it he would need Tony at his side.
Tony steps forward, his eyes never leaving Steve’s. In all honesty, it was freaking him out. Tony was supposed to be dead and not looking at him like he wanted to eat his brain.
Steve moves to kiss Tony on the lips, wanted to get the stressful thoughts out of his mind. Placing little kisses against his lips before he presses his tongue inside. Tony groans and rubs his hands up and down Steve’s biceps.  Tony breaks the kiss and pushes his husband back. “Sleep! I wanted to sleep!”
Medicine dropper is shoved in and Tony presses down on the bubble. Peter starts to whimper as the liquid sloshes precariously in his mouth. “Swallow it. If you spit it out you’re going in the corner.”
He thinks about it in the shower and then when he’s in the bedroom getting dressed. Vaguely he is aware that Tony is watching him from the bed.
“Tony, I told you not to wake them up!” Steve complains in the doorway of Peter’s room. Tony is coaxing him awake, covering his small face with kisses. Telling him it’s Christmas and time to get out of bed.
“Of course,” Steve answers as he rolls on his side and slides his hand over to Peter’s small one. Tony was on his side facing his husband, Peter curls up against him like a little spoon. Peter felt safe with his two dads so close and he was able to fall back asleep. No more bad dreams came that night.
“Are you kidding me right now?” Tony scolds as he leans down to Peter’s level and grabs his shoulders roughly.
“Not much of anything. That you kids are doing well. That Pepper is getting married in a few months.”
Steve had found a pack of cards in the gift shop and they were playing games to pass the time. It was a welcome distraction from the constant worry, even if it was only a few minutes of relief before they remember why they were here. The first twenty-four hours pass like this. The two parents trying to distract themselves from the awful reality of sitting in a Pediatric ICU wondering if their child is going to survive.
Beverly is standing up again playing with Tony’s messy morning hair. He seamlessly pulls her onto his lap and holds her still for a second.
“Papa, turn on the waterfall.” Peter runs to the far end of the shower and presses his hand against the tile. “And this one too.”
“Yes, I am. Now don’t go letting him wander around too much,” Fury says sounding annoyed before he turns to leave.
“It’s just a phase, right?” Tony asks as he taps the steering wheel. He wasn’t going to bring up, what Peter had said about Steve hurting him.
Peter resumes crying and kicking his legs, working up to a full-on tantrum. Tony presses the button to the call for the nurse. The two men try to calm their son down with little results. He kicks the blankets off and pulls up his hospital gown.  Steve automatically tries to smooth it down and cover his son’s nakedness.
Steve slides an arm around him. It’s a nice feeling, having someone else sharing his bed. The warmth of Tony’s body against his. He hadn’t realize how lonely he had become
“He’s a mini version of you. Plus you stress out if we leave him alone for the night. How many times did you call the babysitter last time?”
“She’s the goddess of the forest. She often appears to those lost in the woods and brings them home. There’s been sightings of her for hundreds of years. Sometimes she appears much younger especially when she’s helping a child. We’ve classified her as fairly harmless. She is a daughter of Odin so that alone puts her on a watchlist.”
Today he was taking a virtual meeting with Clint, Natasha, and a few other agents. They were discussing a Hydra strong-hold they had been watching in Turkey for months, gathering intel. The plan was to break in within the next month. The mission would take him away for a week, two weeks tops. He worried about leaving Tony for that long with the two kids. Tony tended to get hyper focused and overwork himself. They hadn’t found a nanny in the area yet. It was another thing they would need to get done before he left. The children were playing in the living-room, he had kept the door cracked so he could hear them. Blue Planet was playing in the background, he tried to limit television to educational shows. Although the cartoons always seemed to sneak in.
Peter is excited when they get inside and they have trouble keeping up with him. He’s small so he easily moves around people and get up the stairs quickly so he can get into the lantern room and see the lamp and the lens. It’s a full fifteen minutes before the rest of them catch up. They take the tour as intended listening to the guide tell the history. Tony grabs Peter’s hand when they finally catch up with him.  “You run off again and we’re going home.”
“You have to ask Daddy and me before you accept someone’s invite. We’ve already made dinner at home and everyone is waiting on you. ”
They’re summoned to the kitchen when dinner is all done. Everyone gathers around the table and begins to eat. “This is really good,” Steve comments.
Steve is quiet as he finishes Tony’s thought in his head. Afraid you’ll spank him like you did over the painting.
After a minute, he hesitantly sets Peter back down on his feet. He pulls him into another hug before he goes over to pick up Beverly. A quick hug and kiss before she’s asking to be put back down. Steve leaving isn’t a big deal to her and she wants to continue playing with her toys. She was showing Clint all of her stuffed dogs. He goes to Tony last, pulling him into a tight hug and whispering I love you into his ear. A quick peck on the lips because he had spent the last hour kissing every inch of Tony’s body. But Tony is greedy and deepens the kiss forcing his tongue inside.
Steve takes a sip of his coffee before heading into the bedroom. The only sound is the ceiling fan whirling and Tony’s soft snores.
Thanks for reading. It was a hard to write with everyone being in conflict with each other. The weather has become really warm here so that's helping for the summer setting. We even had a thunderstorm last night which is really unusual for December.
“Don’t start with me. My children turned out fine. Peter is working on his PhD at MIT and Bev will be graduating from Johns Hopkins in a semester. She already has job interviews lined up.”
“They locked down the school and brought the police in. Dad was so pissed off. He actually showed up to sort everything out. He yelled at you the whole ride home.”
The atmosphere becomes tense as Steve realizes he’s alone with Tony. The conversation from that morning running through his head over and over. They needed to talk to each other. Actually listen and talk everything out. It was something neither of them were good at. It wasn’t going to work if it led to another fight. He gets off the couch and stands by Tony’s chair.
It goes on like this for an hour and Tony starts to accept that he probably isn’t going to get any sleep tonight.
Peter leaves the spot on the floor where he’s playing with his toys and walks up to his father. He shyly grabs his hand as he looks up nervously at Coulson.
Steve freezes because he doesn’t know how to answer. The right thing would be to tell him about Pepper and Morgan.
“Hey!” Tony shouts as he closes the distance between them, grabbing Peter’s arm roughly when he catches up to him. He pulls his child towards him. Peter’s movements are rag-doll like and he doesn’t acknowledge Tony. He pulls against Tony’s hold, his arm out like someone else is dragging him away.  “Hey!” Tony shouts at him again but there is no response. Tony raises his hand and smacks Peter’s bottom. Tears spring into Peter’s eyes, he looks confused back and forth between Tony and his stinging backside.
He takes her temperature next, waiting for the thermometer to beep. He pulls it out of her mouth and frowns as he sees that she has a fever.
Tony feels the steady rise and fall of her chest against his. She’s still asleep or very good at faking it.
Steve sighs as he closes his laptop and runs his hand frustratedly through his hair. They would have to move again in the morning. He and Natasha were up late, biding time before they had to head out on their mission. Natasha stands up from the couch across the room and pulls out a chair at the table. It scratches loudly across the floor before she sits down heavily.
Blood starts to seep through Peter’s fingers and Tony thinks he must have bit his lip when he fell. Beverly’s small hand grips his arm tightly and he looks down to make sure the soap bubbles aren’t too high and blocking her face. He crouches down and picks her up too, his back be damned. The two kids were heavy together. He walks slowly to the bathroom that hasn’t yet flooded. Jarvis had stopped the dishwasher and he would send out robots to suck up the mess once they were out of the room.
Instead Peter had no choice but to stare up at her pale face, her lips blue and her eyes white. White and dead like the fish Steve had caught the last time he took Peter fishing. The eyes scared him and he kept asking why they looked like that. Suddenly the figure pounces down on him like a cat, hitting his stomach hard causing him to gasp. He sits up and screams as loud as he can. The figure dissipates into a black cloud. Peter doesn’t wait to see what happens next he jumps out of his bed, tangling his legs in his sheets and slamming his knees hard into the wood floor. He pulls himself up and runs for his door pulling  it open and racing down the hall to his parents bedroom. He launches himself onto their bed and dives into Tony’s arms. Both his parents are sitting up in bed seconds away from getting up to check on him. He bursts into tears as he buries his face into the crook of his father’s neck.
Peter wipes his eyes and rolls over so he’s no longer facing against the wall. He thought he had heard something in his room. He sits up and notices some of his toys in the middle of the room. They were definitely not out earlier. That’s not what catches his attention though. It’s the little boy from outside, sitting there playing with his things. He sniffles and wipes his eyes. “Hello…how did you get in my room?”
Dinner has been cleared from the table and adults are gathered around drinking and playing cards. Beverly climbs up on Tony as they are in the middle of a game. He wraps an arm around her and kisses her forehead. “Are you going to help Daddy play?”
Peter gets off the bed and hurries out of the room. He makes his way to his bedroom and starts to strip off his clothes. He goes into his attached bathroom to shower. He’s settling into bed trying to sleep when he hears the door to the house opening.  He opens his eyes slowly and fumbles for his phone that is supposed to be on his night stand. The glare of the phone causing him to squint as he reads the time. It didn’t feel like it, but he must have fallen asleep. A couple hours had passed since he lied down. He drops his phone on the table and throws off the covers. He ventures out of the bedroom and down the stairs.
Steve’s chest feels tight as he watches his son upset like that, seeing the deep purple bruise sticking out of the top of his t-shirt made him feel worse. A reminder of the emergency CPR performed on him after being pulled from the creek. He pulls his crying child into his lap and up against his body. He rubs Peter’s back as the child sobs into his shoulder. Steve closes his eyes and tries to ignore the negative thoughts. He couldn’t help feeling like it was all his fault. How did he not know his son was missing?

Ben goes to the kitchen to search for one and eventually finds one in a drawer. He returns to the couch and shines it on the boy’s head. Tony returns to the room with the first aid kit Steve always brings on vacation. Peter starts to squirm in Steve’s arms as May cleans up his cut. Steve holds him tighter trying to stop his fussing but it only causes the boy to fuss more. He flails his arms knocking the cotton ball out of May’s hand. “Hey!” Steve scolds. “Knock it off. If you don’t stop squirming I’m going to spank you.”
They sit around eating their popsicles. Tony sits close to Peter putting an arm around him. “Did you have a good time at Thanksgiving?
It worried Steve and he wanted to talk to Tony about it. Peter’s behavior this whole week had been worrying. He was going to look for the number of the therapist Peter saw the first year after the adoption. Peter puts his cup on the table before settling back into the couch and finding a comfortable spot, resting his head in Steve’s lap and curling his legs up under the blanket. He quickly falls back asleep. Steve disentangles himself from his sleeping son a few times to refill his coffee. The movie ends and the rest of the house starts to wake up.
“Peter!!” Steve calls from upstairs. The brown-haired boy jumps up so quickly he knocks the cup over. He looks up to the ceiling listening to his parents call for him. “I—I have to go.”
“Can someone please explain what is going on here? Because something is not right,” Peter says as he straightens out his collar.
“Have you taken something for it? I have medicine in my room,” she asks as she heads down the hallway.
Steve suddenly releases Peter almost causing him to fall into the floor. He looks over at Tony horrified. “Is everything a joke to you? Is there no line you won’t cross? Get out of my way,” Steve demands as he pushes past Tony to leave the room. “I can’t stay in this house. I need to punch something,” he complains as he makes his way to the door, grabbing the car key and his phone. He assumed there would be a gym in town with a punching bag he’d end up breaking and Tony would have to pay to replace. It was better than hitting Tony, there was no coming back from that.
Tony observes his husband setting his daughter down in a chair, leaning over and giving her options of drinks to have with dinner. She’s asking for chocolate milk and Steve is lying to her like they do so many times with Peter. There’s none left, only plain milk at the moment. Tony starts to eat as Steve is begins doling out drinks. Steve sits across from him and just stares for what seems like a full minute before eating.
“Oh I changed it up. Mint chocolate chip. And there’s nothing wrong with vanilla. It’s a solid flavor.”
Steve kisses his forehead. “Let’s get you home and cleaned up.  You’ll be feeling better in no time.” Steve accepts Peter’s hand into his time and they walk up the long driveway to the house.
They weren’t talking about the situation either. Steve focuses on driving and Tony turns around so he can reach Peter, wiping the tears from his son’s eyes.
Peter only re-emerged from the room to switch his laundry around. He finds Tony laying on the couch watching some old movie he doesn’t recognize. An empty plate with a napkin crumpled on top of it resting on the coffee table. Peter felt awful for what he had said earlier. He makes his way to the couch and sits next to Tony. He realizes that Tony is asleep as he gets closer. He leans in to give Tony a hug. Peter feels the man tense underneath him and Tony grabs Peter’s side roughly, ready to push Peter off when those brown eyes open and look at Tony. The grip softens and Tony pulls him close as he shuts his eyes.
Steve walks up behind him and greets the neighbor. “The couple from down the road. Jerry and Marie. Peter plays with their dog,” Steve explains to his husband.
The little ghost boy appears from behind some boxes, he runs past Peter giggling before circling back. “Peter! Do you want to play?”
Steve sits on the bed a pulls the phone from Tony’s hands. Placing it on the bed as he leans in to kiss him. He starts to pull up Tony’s shirt, before leaning back to pull it over his head, he whispers against his lips. “You’re so infuriating.”
Steve starts to feel frustrated as the minutes pass, that Tony’s taken Peter out of his seat. He can’t drive off with them all over the backseat like that. He almost yells at him but stops himself. Wondering where all the anger comes from. Even though deep down he knows the exact cause. It was every time he watched his father’s fist make contact with his mother’s face and body. Every Time he hid but still watched because he couldn’t leave his mother alone. Scared but quiet as a mouse not wanting his father to see him. Not wanting to feel the sting of his father’s belt across his back. Not wanting to hear the insults hurled at him for being small, for being weak, for being a worthless son. It was long ago and his father was long dead. Forgive wasn’t the right word but he had accepted his father as the flawed person he was.
“My parents are long dead. Same with Bucky. And Peggy…Peggy is slowly starting to forget things. She’s not always aware of what age we are or where she’s at. Besides you and Peter what do I have?”
Peter walks down the street exploring. He finds a dog on the property up the road and across the street.* After a bit Steve goes to look for him; walking the property and calling his name. He decides to walk down the road before checking in the woods for his son. He sees Peter rolling around with a husky. He approaches the yard and decides to go up to the door and introduce himself instead of trespassing. He was definitely going to be lecturing Peter about that later. It’s an older couple in their sixties that answers. They introduce themselves as Jerry and Marie Fields. Steve introduces himself.
“I remember being in my bed and then Papa woke me up and told me to follow him. Then I woke up on the couch.”
Steve perches himself on the edge of the couch, body angled towards the bathroom and waits for Tony to re-emerge. Tony exits the bathroom still as full of energy as when he came in the condo. Steve wonders how many coffees he had on the four or maybe five hour drive there.  Tony pauses in front of Steve. He probably likes this. Steve being the one sitting as he stands over him.
Peter can’t find the air to answer and instead pushes up Steve’s shirt until his skin is touching him. Steve flinches away for a second but stops himself. “Tony, he’s freezing.” It wasn’t a cold night and the cabin didn’t have air conditioning. It was a little on the warm side. Ben opens his bedroom door and takes in the scene. May is standing behind him. Steve picks Peter up and walks back to their room. Tony and Steve sit with him on the bed and try to calm him down. Find out if he’s hurt or scared.
“You left and you weren’t supposed to leave me,” her voice comes out so sad for a child so young. She balls up some of his shirt in her hand and she starts to cry.
His skin is blue tinged and he’s shivering. He isn’t breathing that clearly so Sam moves him onto his side. Peter continues to throw up water. Tony reaches out and grabs his son’s hand.
Tony shakes his head. “Let me check Daddy. Open your mouth. We got to take your temperature. Papa get me the thermometer.”
“Papa!” Peter’s loud shriek interrupts him and he quickly closes everything before locking his phone.
“Ow!” Peter cries and Tony pauses watching him concerned. “My arm,” Peter cries as he clutches his left arm with his right.
“Pick it up,” Tony yells and his son’s brown eyes glisten with moisture as Peter finally looks up at him. He blinks and tears slide down his face but he listens and picks up the popsicle before looking up at his father confused.
“Don’t be so hard on yourself for losing your temper with him. That’s all I’m saying. You could stand to be more firm with him.”
“But you’re all the way up there,” Peter says holding his hand up to demonstrate. “If I don’t see your face then you’re similar to Daddy.”
Steve places the platter of roast carrots on the table and steps back observing that everything is in its place. “Is Peter home yet?”
She stops walking and looks over at him. “I only pretend to know everything. She took a leave of absence. Sick mom or dad. When she came back she was married and with the baby. Quick but you assume it’s grief. I had no reason to look into her.”
“I’m sure he’ll enjoy that. My parents used to take us camping. Ricky and I when we were boys. He loved it. Being out in the woods like that,” Ben says softly thinking back to his childhood and of his long dead brother.
“Let me go. Please let me go,” Peter begs. He can’t hear his own voice but the creature seems to react to it.
Natasha uncrosses her legs and stands up abruptly before slowly pacing around the room. “I’ve had the exact amount of sleep I need. I could say the same to you.”
Each man is on his own side of the bed, an obvious space between them. It’s so quiet Steve can hear Tony breathing. They had taken their time getting ready for bed, and Steve being a gentleman gave Tony his choice of side. He hoped Tony would just fall asleep and they could sort everything out in the morning. What was there to sort though? Pepper had moved on and was marrying another man. Either Tony would be devastated or somehow reconcile with Pepper and destroy what she has with current guy. Or at least bring it into question.
“Daddy,” he implores reaching out to shove his shoulder. Tony throws his legs over the side of the bed and scrubs his face with his hand. Peter moves in between his legs and goes to grab his hand. “Daddy you have to hurry. It’s gross.”
“I love cool summer mornings like this. The quiet stillness before everyone wakes up. I’ll be missing the city by the end of the week though.”
Steve fixes bagels for both of them. They eat a small breakfast before Steve decides to head out for a run. He sets Peter up on the couch with some cartoons and a cup of water.
Steve storms out of the study and into the living-room. After calming himself down, he starts to look around for Beverly. Tony looks around their condo as Steve starts searching the hallway and the common areas of the building.
A few months have passed and they’re getting settled into a routine in Malibu. Tony has been going into Stark Industries daily, coming home in the afternoons to tinker in his workshop. Steve started working in the local SHIELD office. It’s small, nothing compared to headquarters back in DC.  He went in early so he could leave in time to pick up the children from school.
“Of course I’m home. I went to go see some friends,” Steve says being short with him. Peter walks up to him and wraps his arms around him. “Peter come on, give me some space I just got home.”
Steve puts his arm around him and kisses his cheek. Tony turns his face and catches Steve’s lips with his own. Peter squeezes between his parents again and breaks their kiss. “Do you want to come inside?”
Tony tries to ignore the pounding in his head as he hears Peter moving through the house. He’s slamming a first aid kit  and a white towel onto the table next.
“I didn’t...I didn’t... I...He told Tony that I’ve been hurting him. And when Tony confronted me on it, I just felt betrayed. You know? He’s my husband. He should trust me. How could he think—” Steve pauses again trying to collect himself.
Steve grabs the sleeve of his pajamas and points out the paint. All over his right sleeve and on the front of his pajamas. Peter’s eyes go wide and he tries to find a logical explanation. He had not gone anywhere near it. Steve starts to lecture him but he’s not listening that closely. He keeps denying that he’s done anything. Tears are flooding his eyes, too early in the morning to be dealing with being yelled at. Steve must have asked a question because he’s looking at Peter expectantly. His mouth goes dry and the angry look on his father’s face is only making his mind go more blank.
Suddenly Peter is shoved to the ground and the woman is shielding him with her body. The creature has attacked them from behind. “I’m going to get up and I need you to run,” the woman says as she spins around and pulls a sword seemingly out of nowhere. Peter doesn’t stay to watch the fight and instead he takes off running. He doesn’t stop until he came to the creek. He looks it up and down trying to find a spot where it’s thinner or perhaps where there is a bridge.  No such thing is found and there’s choice but to walk through it. He didn’t know how long he had been running but the woman or the creature never showed up again. The sun has risen in the time he’s been out here. That much he knew. Rain had started to fall causing the ground to become muddy and slick. His parents would be up soon and notice that he was missing. He had to find a way across and quickly. He didn’t want to think of the punishment he’d receive if his parents found him sneaking back into the house.
Tony sighs as they exchange a look. Peter did not do naps. It had been a fight the first year when they tried it. He was in a better mood after his nap but it took him forever to accept that he actually needed one. “You can try.”
“It’s no problem. I’m going to wake the kid up,” he says as he stands up and goes back inside. He walks down the hall before slowly opening the door to Peter’s room and peeks inside  His child always cocooned himself in the blankets, the only thing sticking out was a tuft of messy curls. Steve sits on the bed and starts to untangle the blankets earning a whine from Peter. “It’s time to get up buddy,” he says softly and Peter loosens his grip on the blankets and lets them be pulled away. He cuddles into his father not ready to open his eyes.
Peter gives him a weird look before heading back into the bathroom. Steve wouldn’t approve of drinking directly out of the sink. He returns to the room and climbs over Tony to get to the middle of the bed. Under the covers, he slides in between them before pressing his back against Steve’s and stretching his legs out until they touch Tony’s side.
“What do you think Aunt May and Uncle Ben are doing for Thanksgiving? Oh! I just thought of something! You need to put the turkey in the oven. Papa always puts it in early in the morning.”
“That was my little boy growing up. Of course I cried. It was harder when he started first grade and went all day.”
Peter is transfixed by a cartoon on the television as the adults are busy getting ready for the day and discussing the plan for the afternoon. Ben is sitting at the kitchen table reading the news on a StarkPad. A plate with dirty silverware and a half empty coffee cup sit next to him. May is in the bathroom blowdrying her hair. The sound permeating out to the main living area. Everyone is doing their own thing for breakfast. Steve walks into the room all dressed for the day. He scoops up Ben’s plate on his way to the kitchen. “You done with this?”
Steve glances up, tears welling in his eyes. It had been a long night and emotions are swirling through his head. Tony wasn’t an easy man to be married to but he couldn’t help who he loved. They had fallen for each other hard and the relationship progressed quickly. Marriage and moving in together. Soon they were adopting Peter and becoming parents. It was harder and harder to imagine a life without him. Everything was so intertwined together. Tony’s playboy past was hard for him to accept. He trusted that his husband was faithful to him.
Thor agrees to watch the children while Tony gets in the shower. Beverly is at the tailend of her cold and starting to feel better. Peter is still pretty sickly. Thor helps get cleaned up and into fresh pajamas and starts to make them lunch. He picks up the house following Peter’s instructions. Once he’s sure Tony is asleep, he tells Loki to show himself. Peter is looking at Loki shocked but Beverly looks excited.
“Tony and I are looking to expand our family. This little one should be returning to New York with us soon.”
“Stop!” he squeals causing Tony to look over at them. His parenting style was more of let’s see how this plays out where Steve probably would have stopped it right away. Tony instead turns on the news station to see what is going on in the world.
Steve is surprised by Peter’s explanation having never stopped to think about how his son would perceive the world. “Daddy and I don’t sound the same either.”
Tony stands up as Peter hops down and reaches for his hand. Peter is fine until Tony tries to go into the bathroom with him. Peter rips his hand out of his grasps and screams, “No! I can do it myself.”
Tony packs the small lunch bags and starts to clean up the kitchen. He can hear Beverly screaming from her room that she doesn’t want her hair done. The crying as Steve starts to brush her hair and pull it back into some kind of pony tail. Her eyes are still red rimmed when they return to the room, her light blonde hair pulled into pigtails. Steve walks with her backpack to the counter and puts her lunch bag into it.
“Yes,” Coulson says. “She fell in with Hydra but remained working at SHIELD. Her whole mission may have been to date you and get pregnant. We’re thinking she had second thoughts about letting them experiment on her daughter. She was left at the daycare facility and no-one realized anything was off until she wasn’t picked up that night. By the time we tracked her parents down the next morning they were already dead.”
Steve comes into the room later to check if Peter is awake from his nap. He finds Peter sitting on the floor staring down at his toys.
“You look deep in thought,” Tony says rolling onto his side and decreasing the distance between them. “And you’re just sitting up in bed.”
Peter shyly offers his hand for them to shake, not leaving Steve’s side. His left hand threading through his fathers belt loop. “Nice to meet you.”
Steve returns the embrace and closes his eyes as he leaned his head against his long lost friend’s.  He thinks he feels Tony kiss his neck but maybe it’s just his lips brushing innocently across.
Tony is already heading into the room with a pink sippy cup full of milk. She takes it reluctantly giving a look like she thinks he might be dumb.
This chapter was hard to write. It took a while to get how I wanted. I have some scenes I cut out from this story that I'll probably post in My Notebook - my short stories and drabbles series.
It’s a welcome distraction when the food is served. Soon the plates are empty and being cleared away. The chef is packing up and leaving. Steve is watching Tony worriedly.
Steve turns around when there’s no answer. Tony is looking around the room taking in every detail. “We lived here?”
“Shh, you’re okay,” Steve assures him when he tries to hug him again. Peter really starts fighting him and kicking at him.
Steve holds him a little tighter, he never realized how much he wanted to hear those words from Tony. Or that he had even wanted to hear them at all. He had given up on the idea of settling down and falling in love. He had missed his chance with Peggy. There was no way to play that life out. He had lost Tony and any opportunity to explore those feelings he kept pressed down deep.
He knows he’s responding poorly when he sets her on her feet and grabs her chin so she’s facing him. “Don’t you ever, ever, leave this condo without telling someone again. Is that understood?”
Tony and Steve laugh at him. Steve reaches out and tousles his hair before placing a kiss on top of head. “Oh Jeez. Tony, he tastes like dirt.”
Peter gets up and walks into the guest room grabbing a few books and notebooks. Returning to the living-room he drops them heavily onto the coffee table. Throwing his pen on top.
Tony is half leaning onto Steve’s chair, holding onto his hand as if it’s a lifeline. Coffee is sitting in front of them getting cold and barely touched. Bruce had grabbed it from the machine for them earlier. Natasha had tried to get them to eat food but neither one had an appetite. Everyone had left after getting to see Peter.  He was lying in the hospital bed hooked up to monitors and an IV. He was breathing on his own but not well. He has a mask over his face that is delivering high-flow oxygen.
“Our little boy,—” Tony groans and shifts under Steve’s weight, “—who loves you and thinks the world of you. ”
“Hi Steve. It’s Marie. If you don’t have plans we wanted to invite you over for coffee and pastries.”
“We should get going. We have plans for the afternoon,” Steve says quickly,  as he stands up and glances at Tony waiting for him to do the same. Jerry stands up and Steve reaches out to shake his hand.
He worried how she would deal with him being gone. She hadn’t reacted the same way as Peter. She was so nonchalant about it after she asked her questions. Satisfied that Tony would be there to take care of her and Peter there to play with her. Something about it didn’t feel right and he felt she should be more upset. It was the same with her losing her parents. Her whole response seemed muted.
Tony and Steve both glance into the rearview mirror back at their son slouched down in his seat. “A few more hours baby. Do you need a pee break?” Steve asks.
“Katie never played over at their house though. There was something off about that man. The father. After a tragedy like what happened at that house, people always say something like he was so normal. He was a nice guy. It was unexpected. Now of course it was unexpected but he wasn’t a nice guy. Even from down the road we could hear the fighting. We called the cops plenty of times but the wife never wanted to press charges. It was just a sad situation you could tell the little girl didn’t want to go home at night.
“What the fuck? What the fuck? What the FUCK? He could have been kidnapped! Anything could have happened? What the fuck were you thinking?”
Steve lets go of Peter and sits on the ground, adjusting Beverly so she’s on one side of his lap. He opens his right arm and Peter stares at him uncertain now that he’s getting his way.
“He’s a fucking dick, that’s what he is,” Tony scoffs angrily, “Look, now DUM-E’s all scared and I spent ages trying to teach him to be kid friendly! And I ended up shouting at him in front of the children Anton! The
Tony grimaces at the reminder as he flies toward the portal with a nuke. Like, fucking obviously. This wasn’t exactly his first choice for… anything really.
"Think about it Pep," Anton wheedles, "Sure the plan is a little convoluted," Pepper snorts, "But think of the benefits, you get to wrangle up only one of us instead of both of us for meetings- and how great would that be? I like the stuff on business and PR, and Tony wouldn't sulk his way through every single meeting."
Neither Anton nor Tony understood it well, they just knew that it's effective. And it still is if the way Rhodey slumps over, defeated and annoyed is any indication. Pepper too looks like she's faltering, so Anton steps up his game as well. Rhodey is easy when it comes to Tony, Pepper is far less willing to jump into their shenanigans. It's partly why Anton adores her.
Tony can't look at his brother's eyes and it hurts. For both of them. Afghanistan has broken them but what's the most unforgivable thing is that they weren't broken the same way. They are shattered mirrors with different cracks and it's like they can no longer look at each other and see their own faces anymore. Tony and Anton had always had contrasts but now it felt like they were completely separate colors. There's an armor that separates the two and that armor is Ironman.
“We need you to look at this,” Agent Agent Phil Coulson says, getting straight to the point and handing out a file toward Anton. “As soon as possible.”
They also had the same problem of their father consistently being disappointed at them. The same shadow of some hero they could never possibly hope to be.
When Tony and Anton were twenty-one, their parents died in a car crash. They became the heads of Stark Industries overnight. They finished off six bottles of their father's most expensive bottles of alcohol that same night.
Anton raises an eyebrow, “Okay, now I’m intrigued- by the way, I would bang Loki, date Thor and marry Ironman.”
they totally need to order from Little C’s soon. It’s been far too long since he’s had their Mediterranean pizza. It’s so good. Damn. Maybe tomorrow.
Anton makes a sweeping gesture to his right and the crowd of reporters gasp as Ironman flies down to his side. Tony in the suit waves and they all go wild.
The doors to the workshop close with a soft 'snick' sound and they wait a minute or so before talking.
Rhodey had snatched Tony's phone the moment the younger man had pointed it dramatically at him, and ran. "Not a chance Tones!" He hollered as he furiously looks through Tony's contacts while getting chased circles around their dining table, "I'm not going to take another second o- did you really list Anton as 'The Twin with a Smaller Dick'?" The man shakes his head and hits the call button.
"Oh how could I forget?" Tony mocks harshly, all meekness gone and bitter self-hatred coloring his tone, "You think we can actually atone for the shit we've done by throwing money at it? I'm tired of making weapons Anton! I'm tired of being associated with war and death and building fucking bombs that are used to try and kill us with."
Of course literally nothing went right and she was forced to reconsider her initial opinions. Tony was not as easy to manipulate as she had first thought. He was unwilling to be distracted by her.. assets and was more than committed to his newfound relationship with Miss Potts. Stark has definitely changed from what she has seen, not that she could see much to be honest.
Some people commented about their closeness. Accusations of incest and forbidden love that never seemed to go away no matter how much money was thrown at them. It didn't help that people kept claiming they've been invited up for a night as the meat in that Stark sandwich. And it really didn't help that at least half those claims had been true.
Okay, so when Anton said sufficiently prepared he meant just enough not to jump in shock at the intruder but definitely not enough for a clever quippy pun. If Tony were here they could play it off, make a fun game of it in front of the agent but unfortunately, Tony is playing dead and trying to figure out how some stupid secret agency managed to hack JARVIS well enough for them not to have noticed the breach in security.
“Right, this is ridiculous Rhodey,” Tony complains. “I still need to design the new protective clothing line for the army that Anton had fucking promised your pack of military dogs in order to get them off our backs about Ironman. Not to mention I’m almost done with War Machine.”
“Really?” Tony sarcastically replies as he diverges slightly from his brother to head to the given coordinates for the commotion happening in Germany. “I didn’t realize, thank you for clarifying this to me for the fiftieth time.”
"No. No fuck you," Tony stands up from the table furiously, "I- I can't even look at you right now you asshole. I need to go check on Rhodey and see if I can salvage back my first ever real friend and then maybe we'll talk."
Well, that's not entirely true. Coffee was probably the best thing to happened to the twins. And Jarvis. And Rhodey- though that was debatable for Anton. But Pepper was definitely up there.
"Okay, hold up," Rhodey says for the nth time. Pepper looks close to stabbing everyone with her heels. "I get that Tony wants to, uh, stop being Tony. I mean, I don't actually get it but Tony promised to explain that mess to me later."
The redhead shook her head, "Stark, I won't tell anyone if you're not ready, but don't even try that bullshit on me." She turns on the sad, serious eyes on him. He wouldn't call them puppy dog eyes, per say, too dangerous to describe someone like her, more like the eyes of a betrayed knife-wielding ninja cat. Yeah, let's go with that.
Justin would come to any event the twins attended. He would try wow Tony with second-hand knowledge and second tier inventions despite even his best work barely up to par with Anton’s, well, maybe not worst works, but definitely down there.
“That’s why they made SHIELD in the first place.” Anton brutally points out, “Her whole ‘secret secret’ crap flies immediately out the window once she joins the very public avengers. I mean yeah, maybe for negotiations and infiltration she’ll be good but come on. This project has been in the making for how long? And they couldn’t even get like, an X-men or a mutant.”
Just because they were twins, that didn't mean that they didn't fight. It doesn't happen often, after all they practically share everything with each other, however when they did, well. Let's just say no one wins in a war.
That was also a valid point. Recently, especially that last two years or so, mutant activity was starting to form and gain attention, opinions on them were varied and unfortunately skewed toward the negative. It would’ve been much more beneficial to have picked a mutant for the Avengers Initiative in the long run.
Funny, sarcastic, banter and flirtation flows easily out of their mouths. It doesn’t hurt that they’re both handsome too.
“Huh. Well whaddaya know,” Anton drawls as a SHIELD agent comes up from the elevator, Tony has texted him the breach just a few seconds ago so Anton was sufficiently prepared, “If it isn’t the Agents who thought they could, no wait, the Agents of the legless round table, fuck,”
When Anton was seventeen he was accepted into MIT to pursue business, engineering and marketing. He was already one of the most popular kids there. When Tony was seventeen he was already working on his third doctorate and was playing with many other degrees. He had made exactly one friend and one robotic arm named DUM-E.
Pepper purses her lips and if Tony had looked at her he would’ve seen the pained anguish in her eyes, “Tony... Rhodey doesn’t want this.”
Maybe in a different universe Tony only had one copy of the new arc reactor and was forced to use his original one in the fight against Stane. But that was in a universe where Tony was alone and had to fight to juggle the press, the company, and Ironman, alone.
Anton makes a face at him. “You know, one day you’ll be so old you’ll wish you’re four minutes and sixteen seconds younger like me.”
Tony is the planner, the calculator. He is the architect that builds and devises and creates the impossible from the possible. Anton is the wild card, the artist. He is the designer to his brother’s architect, polishing, improving and finding the possible from the impossible. Together they are unstoppable. Together they’re ready for anything.
A few weeks after the return from Afghanistan. After Obie’s betrayal. Obie’s death. Tony Stark realized that something was very wrong with the arc reactor.
“You don’t have to listen to bossman over there if you don’t want to Dr Banner,” Tony sighs fondly, before adding, “But seriously, I would go Loki all the way, he seems like the fashionable, sassy one with brains, and I like that.”
“Not that you’re complaining,” his twin says bemused, “also don’t think I’m going to forget you just fan-gasmed just by saying the guy’s name near him.”
There’s this new chick. Natalie Rushman. She’s Pepper’s new hire to help her out with all her work that’s been piling up recently. Anton was going to hire her but apparently having another hot redhead working under him wasn’t exactly met with approval from Pepper. Ex-supermodel lawyer or something.
His face was pushed in unexpectedly, and water immediately filled his nose and mouth in his surprise. He was forced to stay there for what seemed like forever and a half before he was pushed back up. This time he was more wary with his freedom.
ridiculous. Your brother is especially ridiculous. The plan to drag you out for sunlight and fresh air is genius. Hell, with all the chlorophyll crap your drinking you might even photosynthesize, and then I can cross feeding you off my list for today.”
“Ironman is one of us,” Rhodey growls possessively, apparently far more angry than Pepper about founding a spy in their midst. Though in reality, it is Pepper that is probably leagues above in rage than Rhodey, a shouting outburst from her means anger, but it’s when she gets all quiet and smiley that’s when you should really be afraid.
It takes him about a month and a half. Usually, it would’ve been much faster considering their almost unhealthy dependence on each other but the younger twin had been on cloud nine since Pepper had started dating him.
The gasps and hushed whispers were louder now. Anton can practically hear the room, how they immediately blame Obadiah for treason, greed and the loss of a Stark twin. With two words he has the whole room. Anton should feel guilty for doing this, using his brother, himself, but it was for himself, for his brother, for the both of them that he deceives.
“Hey, who’s more your type tincan, Loki or Thor?” Anton asks gamely while he works alongside Bruce. Tony, inside the Ironman armor, crosses his arms and hums while his mind whirs as he takes in the data spread out on his helmet screen.
Anton tilted his head in vague acknowledgment before speaking again, “Just, I get the feeling of wanting to try to be as smart as you Tony, I mean, I’ve made peace with being second place on the IQ listings but that doesn’t mean other people will.”
Strong, intelligent, beautiful. In her more whimsical thoughts, Natasha actually thinks she and her could’ve made quite a pair if she hadn’t tried to pursue Tony Stark after being told by Potts herself to, in no uncertain terms, back off. Apparently, you don’t push Pepper Potts unless you wanted to be shoved.
Anton massaged his temples, he was always the more emotionally mature out of the pair, “For fuck's sake Tony, just compliment him and he’ll... well actually he definitely won’t back off but he’ll be less desperately aggressive about everything.”
to make sure. Faking your death was a cliche but a good one. Tony knows firsthand of it. He finds the Russian, struggling but alive.
Anton is more of a risk taker. He has plans and backups like Tony, but he embraces the ridiculous frivolity of the world known as luck and happenstance. Anton knows that he cannot plan as many contingencies like his brother, but he can adapt quickly, he is far more flexible with unknown variables thrown their way. It was why he was always better handling the press, Tony would freeze the moment someone asked him an unexpected question, needing to recompute his carefully formulated answers, but Anton barely even blinks as he smoothly spouts off bullshit with a shark-like smile.
Maria used to be able to tell them apart, before they decided to change themselves, to become a better whole. Howard stopped trying altogether, if one was in trouble both were in trouble as far as he was concerned. Jarvis and his wife Ana was the best at figuring out though. They weren't perfect what with their age and failing eyesight but the couple tried and gave it as good as they got. It was more than they'd ever gotten from anyone else at least.
"And I couldn't be myself because everyone knows I'm a genius, but I'm about a level and a half lower than Tony." Anton adds, "It would be much more convincing if it was Tony designing the armor instead of me."
Shawarma was like that one classic movie you promise yourself you’ll get around to watching soon but never do because of reasons. Shawarma was like the weekend road trip you and your friends planned in passing but never got about actually doing it. Shawarma is like telling people you’re planning to volunteer your holidays helping sick African dolphins but ended up never getting around to filling in the application.
"We can do good things too," Anton replies angrily, "Billionaire playboy philanthropists, remember?!"
But behind closed bedroom doors, they were no longer the charming Stark twins. It was just Tony who hated galas and wanted to read his newest Captain America comic book and Anton who cackled incessantly about how he had managed to pour a whole cup of wine in some snooty lady's purse when she wasn't looking. Anton would regale Tony about all the interesting gossip he'd managed to overhear while Tony half listened as he read. Then Tony would point out something interesting in his book which would turn the conversation to more interesting debates like if Captain America would defeat Darth Vader in battle or which theory for time travel is better. And if they had a really bad day, they would curl up in the same bed together and whisper their secrets and worries and doubts before they finally went to sleep.
“Not like this!” Pepper bursts out, angry and so goddamn sad, “Dammit Tony, your brother is out there trying to find something,
The public loved the whole together thing. The concept of rich genius playboy twins never seemed to grow old, and there was barely a photograph in any media that had the two by themselves. Anton, the Merchant of Death and his brother Tony, his Scythe Maker by his side. The offense and the defense. Always together, never apart.
“Now you know how I feel,” Anton smirks as he lays down in bandages. “Doesn’t feel so good now does it?”
They had to call Happy to pry the twins off each other and by then they were both covered in red marks that would bruise terribly in the morning. Tony cried and drank. Anton did the same thirty floors up.
Rhodey was Tony's roommate in college. In less than two weeks, a roommate had become a friend and in a month, a friend had been elevated to best friend. The brother from another mother. Tony's grumpy giant honey bear.
“I get absolutely no respect around here,” Anton complained but complied obediently, albeit with exaggerated sulkiness that he knew amused his lover greatly. He takes a sip before making an annoyed clicking sound and pointing at the SHIELD agent with his wine glass, “And you, you might as well sit down and tell us why you came before we call the cops about your little B and E, Stark Industries has made great friends with law enforcement these days and if we make the call I’m fairly sure no pizza delivery guy is going to beat them here.” Fairly sure. Pizza delivery service here is pretty amazing these days.
Even fighting, they are in sync, their hips swaying to the same beat and there is never a point in the dance where they truly separate from each other. There’s a point where it almost looks like the pair is about to break the growing furious tension with a kiss, the ultimate act of sinful depravity and yet an entrancing vision of symmetry. It leaves the viewers breathless. Wanting.
She whirls around to see Ironman leaning against the doorway, giving her a little wave as her eyes widened. "As much as I'm flattered you think I'm secretly a genius billionaire, Mr Stark's ass could hardly fit into my armor."
The older Stark twin gasped for air desperately, thrashing as much as he could just to be able to get barely a lungful of much needed oxygen before once again he was pushed face first in the dirty water. Scratch that. They were total dicks.
Tony bit his lip, Anton knew exactly how he would feel when he pulled out the ‘I’m the dumb twin card.’ After all, Anton may be lower in IQ but he certainly ran circles around Tony with EQ. Bastard.
“You can understand why I’m so uneasy to trust at this moment.” He tells them, soft, tired, weary, lower your voice, make it hoarse, make them believe, “Why even now Stark Industries weapons business is being downsized and temporarily shut down. We’re working alongside the CIA and such for some serious housecleaning and we will be looking toward other business ventures for the company to make up for the losses.” Anton smiles, self-deprecating but strong, a hard combination but he can do it, Obie- Obadiah taught him well, “Anton always said we needed to branch out.”
It’s both a sweet relief and a suffocating disappointment when they move apart to complete their piece, the fire slowly burning down from something hungry and passionate to something soft and simmering. The music ends and the Stark twins once again drape over each other, Tony wrapped around his brother’s body as he is dipped down, while Anton has his head against his counterpart’s collarbone, posed possessively, teeth bared against Tony’s exposed curve of neck in a twisted, indecent visage of fraternal protection, domination, supplication and above all love.
“They probably would have if they had a mutant under their employment. Well, one they can trust anyway.” Tony snorts, from what he understands from gleaming the files, with an agency as paranoid as SHIELD it would be impossible for them to trust anyone more powerful than the average human much less find someone that would trust them. Having Captain America fall into their laps was quite the boon really.
“Drink your chlorophyll Tony,” Pepper sighs, handing the older Stark twin the cup of untouched smoothie, “Seriously, it’s starting to... clump.” Her nose delicately wrinkled in faint disgust. Tony doesn’t blame her. It’s not a pleasant thing to look at.
"I've seen the papers. I've heard the reports. That's why I want to put an end to all this wild speculation. The truth is-"
“Anton, get Tony into the Ironman suit and to come to the address Rhodey’s going to text you.” Pepper orders one day early in the morning. And when Anton says early in the morning he means, eleven o’clock, which, to be perfectly fair was incredibly early for a Sunday and seriously, they just had incredible mind-blowing sex last night and it’s a little rude that she had left just to wake him up via phone call.
"That one was for good luck." The torturer jeered as he left the room, the guards replacing him in his stead. Anton was suddenly beside him, pale and furious. Someone must have unchained him from the table then.
Rhodey at the time. He seethed every time Tony brought him up like a jealous lover and the first time the two ever met, Anton had straight out declared Rhodey as his arch-nemesis over brunch.
“Can’t I just sleep with him?” Tony whined. “I mean, I don’t really want to fuck him much less let him fuck
“I’m pretty sure it’s only good because you put strawberries and ice cream in it,” Rhodey says, amused.
Natasha narrowed her eyes and cocked her head to the side, "You should really come clean." Is all she replies with, and it comes out much nicer and assuring than they both expect it to be, "No one is going to be upset."
She was pretty, and patient, and once she finally got a decent footing around the whole billionaire genius twin thing, she became the snarky badass in heels who took no shit. Tony loved her. Anton was in love with her.
“I didn’t,” Anton would shrug back, puzzled at why someone as smart as his brother couldn’t understand, “S’just quick thinking that’s all.”
Obie was... he was the cool uncle they always had. He let them into a boardroom meeting once, he listened to their ramblings and ideas, he even once asked to use one of their designs as a product to be marketed. Tony liked Obie a lot. But Anton, Anton looked up to him.
“Please, I am Agent Phil Coulson,” the man says courteously, but with as little emotional inflection one could possibly make without coming off cold. It was like the man screamed unassuming and bland. While Tony and he had done some research about SHIELD they hadn’t really personally met anyone from there other than Fury and Natasha. However Natasha had come off the whole situation looking incompetent and like any other corporate spy that exploited their good looks, and Fury had quite a… personality that suited a drill sergeant than a spy. Phil Coulson though, that’s the sort of guy Anton and Tony always imagined a real spy would be like.
So when Obie became Stane by ripping out Tony's robot heart, Tony couldn't help but wonder if the irony or metaphor or whatever messed up thing it was here, was more relevant to him or his brother, who watches, paralysed in a corner with tears in his eyes.
“I better,” Tony mutters as he remembers the absolute reaming he got from their father afterward. God Tony hates how stupid he is at this stuff. Why couldn’t people be like math problems and be satisfied with one answer?
"It's Yinsen. And you need rest." The other man replies, "They'll be coming back to check on us soon."
“N’uh,” Tony protests but now he’s grinning too, “I’m the oldest one, that means I have to protect you!”
When Tony was nineteen he graduated MIT. He asked to stay another year to help with research as an excuse not to leave his brother. It didn't work. When Anton was nineteen his first real scandal in the form of a sex tape came out. Well, it was his, but everyone thought it was Tony's. Anton felt guilt about the unwanted increase of attention toward his more introverted half and learned the idea of discretion.
“After Afghanistan,” A still bleeding wound that can be milked for all its worth for the people to suckle onto, “I find myself... there is very little in the way of people I can trust, I have discovered. Obadiah Stane was my role model, my uncle, my godfather... my advisor and my friend,” Anton wears vulnerability like his newest suit, perfectly. It helps that he still feels truly wretched about Obadiah’s betrayal. It’ll probably be a gaping wound for years. “And yet he was the one responsible for selling my weaponry under the table to terrorists.”
There was literally nothing SHIELD could offer the twins that would benefit them save some extra firepower. And even then it was a little iffy.
Anton is forced to don on his own emergency Ironman armor, but of course, while it’s far more advanced than before, Anton hardly uses it as often as Tony. He defeats whip man, Vanko, obviously, but the suit is horribly damaged.
“Should you really be telling someone like him this?” Rushman, if that really was her name, asked coolly, eyes cold and assessing as she took in Ironman. Tony can’t help but shudder at her icy demeanor, Anton shared a similar sentiment, possibly more unnerved than his brother since he had been more personally acquainted with her false persona. The contrast was quite jarring to say the least.
“So what type of things do you draw?” She asked innocently,Her curiosity getting the best of her.Steve chuckled as he motioned for her to sit next to him,smiling to himself as she happily complied.He gently handed her the sketchbook allowing her to flip through the pages and examine his drawings.He stayed quiet smiling as she continued to complacent him which he actually found very sweet of her.
Tony just looked at her for a few moments before turning around and walking towards the kitchen ignoring the laughter that taunted him as he left “I think you made him mad” He heard Natasha say blankly.He shook his head in either amusement or annoyance,(Not even he knew) as he picked the cup of coffee that was left for him and returned to the group he had become so familiar with.
“Can I talk to you for a moment…” She had already stood up and was already making her way out the room,Expecting Steve to follow.Steve glanced at Natasha who was briefly trading words with Clint.He sighed as he stood up and walked to where willow seemed she was bouncing off the walls “Why did you call me over?” She stared up at him beaming with joy.
He gave her a confused look “Could you be a little more specific cause I don't know what you're referencing too”.Natasha rolled her eyes in annoyance at the snarky response “Why do I even bother?” She mumbled.
He remained silent as he slowly made his way to floor 66 only speaking when one of the staff members greeted him.He sighed as looked for the young girl he had known so little about not even sure why he was taking the time to look for her in the first place.
She smiled brightly in response “Thanks Tony!” She looked back towards the machine “So,is it a power source some sort?
Bruce frowned Slightly as he thought about the topic at hand “Yeah but he must design a lot of stuff I wouldn't blame him if he couldn't remember”
When the two men got there they had assumed that Willow was already inside but before they could open the door the spotted the small figure running down the hallway,Carrying far too many water bottles for her to handle.She quickly ran up to them “A little help?”
Clint cleared his throat in order to gain their attention “We heard the entire conversation from out here and so,I think what Natasha means is since when the hell did you get mom instincts?”
Anton Stark dies in Afghanistan. Anton Stark becomes Tony Stark. Tony Stark becomes Ironman. It's brilliant.
The last Stark heir inwardly groans and makes a 'what the fuck' face at Ironman. You do not outright tell a woman is mistaken. Especially if that woman is the Black Widow. That is just pleading for a widow bite in the face.
“Uh, a billionaire, playboy, philanthropist?” Anton smirked, rubbing his nails against his chest before blowing on them arrogantly. Anton’s good at brushing away insults but that doesn’t make it stop stinging, Tony can see the way his counterpart’s shoulders are tense, angry, hurt. It makes him boil.
Hair pulled back, buttons all done up but colors soft and pastel, she looks good. Natasha packs make up and small weaponry disguised as makeup, her favorite blade, and an emergency communication device if anything goes south. She had been ready for anything.
Tony, Ironman was already deemed suitable for the Avengers Initiative on a part-time basis. Part-time partly because SHIELD is squeamish about bringing in anyone when they don’t have a solid grasp on their personality or background, and partly because neither Anton nor Tony were very interested in working under SHIELD in the first place. They were used to being the bosses of their own thing, they had each other, Pepper and Rhodey as their team, they’re able to let my Ironman out with the public and government’s blessing, and honestly, it wasn’t like they weren’t capable of retrieving whatever information SHIELD has as well.
Knowing exactly what Tony was thinking Anton makes the verbal equivalent of a scowl. “Or one they could control like Captain Popsicle.”
Hell, they don’t even make a good second impression. Or a third. Or a fourth. Or a- anyway, it took a lot of time and effort and a certain level of patience and the ability to see through years of bullshitting experience before they could even begin to see beneath the mask. Tony was a people pleaser to those he liked and Anton was the enabler. Tony made and Anton bought. Anton never forgot a date or a meeting and Tony never missed a deadline, and if he did, it was only because he was improving the product further than anyone asked him to.
But when Tony Stark, sole Stark survivor of Afghanistan began to show up for debate tournaments, throwing parties and bringing along Ironman, the public cried.
“Give me a minute, I need to finish off the suit for Rhodey,” Tony mutters, eyes glued onto a hologram with schematics for a new suit in front of him. He needs to fit more ammunition in somehow, Rhodey is more fight than flight type of guy so he’ll discard the streamline design for a little more built.
"Tony would become more productive now that he has more time in the lab," Anton adds, "and we've agreed we won't completely shut down our weapons industry." He looks at his twin who stares back solemnly. They've fought about this, Tony being more insistent on shutting everything down altogether, but Anton knew how the public, their stockholders, would react if they quit cold turkey. So they compromised, "Instead we'll just focus on non-lethal products like body armor, and stun guns etcetera, while also branching further into clean energy, biotechnology, medicine."
So when Pepper invited her for brunch, after months of nothing but ice cold professionalism, she had readily accepted. Maybe a little too eagerly but she
“Alright, Agent Agent Phil Coulson,” Anton smiles charmingly, “You have two minutes to tell me what you want before I kindly ask you to leave the premises immediately.”
“Don’t, don’t you fucking dare Tony,” is the first thing Anton says, low and hoarse and terrified, “Don’t you, Tony, please, don’t,
"Okay this is getting ridiculous." He says one morning. Tony had been staring forlornly at his phone again and it didn't take someone of Stark's IQ to know who he was thinking of calling. "I am not the handmaiden that the prince falls in love with and willingly gets cut off from their disapproving family before running off into the sunset to open up a diner in the woods."
Still, while he watches the steady breathing on his twin’s face, the dark bags under his eyes, the faint track of tears on his cheeks, he takes the time to mourn their lives lost.
They were part of the community. Anton especially was quite the social little bird, the twins may regularly pop into engineering clubs and universities to personally scout for prospects, but it’s Anton who loved to judge debate tournaments, Anton who once won an award for a fiction story he had written as a bet with some teenager over the internet, Anton who convinced Tony to help build a human-sized robotic dinosaur for the children’s hospital which eventually had to be given to a museum because of… well… being a human-sized robotic dinosaur really. Anton defied the stereotype of being a socially awkward genius just as much as Tony embraced it.
"I hope he falls into a well." Anton hissed as he helps a shaking Tony up from the ground. Tony gave a weak laugh at that.
“Worse still, he was the one who hired the Ten Rings to take me and my,” Anton made choked a little, remember the horrors in that cave, what they have gone through, how Tony had suffered, “my brother.”
“I feel like we’ve missed something,” Anton says back in the tower, watching from the camera in Tony’s faceplate.
“Agent,” Pepper says politely enough but there’s a faint undercurrent of warning there, “you should sit as well.”
The point is. It takes a little while for Anton to notice. It takes the same amount of time for Tony to accept the inevitable. He’s dying. And there’s no way to save him now.
While Tony tinkered on his projects and clung to his childhood idol Captain America, Anton had moved onto admiring real role models in his life and learning how to sell ice to Eskimos with Obie. Sometimes Tony found himself jealous at Anton's close relationship with the man, maybe even resentful when he was left behind with a father who barely looks his way and a mother whose never there, just so Anton can get all Obie's attention.
Howard Stark was frankly overjoyed when he heard the unexpected news. He had barrelled into the room with a wide grin and zoned onto his tired wife and the bundles in her arms like one of his recently created homing missiles. Howard's always prided himself in his plans and blueprints and failsafes, but he had never foreseen this.
If pressed, the twins would say they've had four major fights. The first was about who stole the last cookie when they were eight. That lasted two weeks and was only resolved because Howard had called them babies who needed to grow the hell up.
The agent gave him a bland smile and failed to comply with Anton’s sitting down suggestion. Which. Totally rude.
The second was a fight on who Jarvis loved the best. It was a very Cold War type situation which lasted for most of childhood really. It finally ended after Tony and Anton drafted up a long and biding contract in metallic red pencil on the exact terms and agreement for Jarvis' custody when they were eleven. Jarvis had framed that piece of paper proudly on his bedroom wall, where it remains even after his death.
“It’s just,” Anton says, clearly ignoring his brother which was such a dick move because Anton established this private conversation between suits in the first place and had done something to make sure Tony couldn’t override and mute him whilst in said suit. “Okay fine seeing Captain America in the flesh will be kind of cool but it’s not like he’ll do much in comparison to us. Then we have Natalie-“
"You are going to die!" Anton wailed, its dramatic as fuck but it's a hundred percent genuine fear in there so Tony just hugs his brother tighter. He feels worn as he looks at his sobbing younger brother. Worn and exhausted and far too frayed around the edges but this decision feels right, it settles on him like the armor and Tony knows he will not back down on this.
“Good, blast some kick-ass music,” Anton replies as he arrives deftly on the quinjet. “Also how does he look?”
. Which isn’t exactly ethical now, but the point is they, at one point, had consumed dried whale meat in Japan. And jellyfish noodles. And haggis. But not shawarma.
The Agent immediately complies, looking at the woman with far more fear and respect, which, while completely understandable, does not make it any less rude. Like, come on. He doesn’t want to be that guy but it’s
could ever be without the serum Captain.” Tony, Ironman, steps in. He wishes the voice modulator was more emotive but the fury and derision were clear enough. “Everything that makes you special comes out of a bottle.”
Anton waits until his brother finally loses consciousness once more before he lets himself breathe again. Tony is safe. He helped. He saved him. He almost didn't. Tony was safe. Tony barely made it. For a second he hadn't. For a second Anton almost lost the best thing he ever had. Oh god. Anton trembles as he runs to the corner of the cell and vomits what little contents in his stomach he has.
He dumped Anton, which was just as well because Anton was thinking about dumping him at the time anyway, already growing bored and wanting to move on to prettier things. It seemed altogether rather amiable. Justin even looked regretful about it, but Anton and Tony barely looked back. To Anton they could still be friends, he’s good with keeping things casual. To Tony... Tony didn’t notice. He had more important things on his mind than his brother’s ex.
“I’m sorry Anton. Tell Pep and Rhodey, sorry too.” Tony whispers, he’s close to the portal now. It’s terrifyingly vast now that he’s so close into it. He doesn’t want that to be the last thing he’ll ever see.
Ironman tilted his head, pretending to check the man out, "Sculpted is right." He jeered provokingly, "No fat, only bone is what I see sir."
"Oh god, oh god, shit, fuck, shit, Tony," Anton mutters under his breath, his hands are trembling violently as he helps some random stranger practically shove a car battery in his brother's chest. He's never been good with stuff like this, he went completely vegan for six months because he saw twenty minutes of one of those animal torture fast food documentaries. He would've gone longer but... Well.. Bacon.
“You could say Ironman is our little... mascot.” That earned a few chuckles from the reporters and small whispers of smiles from the government agents. Anton’s grin only faded once the laughter did, “Ironman shows the world StarkIndustries refuses to be used by terrorists, to be manipulated. Ironman is our offensive defense and I refuse to cross that thin threshold between that and turning Ironman into an outright weapon by giving it up to the military.”
"To be fair, she wasn't exactly wrong." Ironman replies but the other could tell the hero was this close to losing it as well.
"Gee, thanks for the confidence bro." Tony deadpanned but his dry wit was ruined by the wet tears running down his face.
“I’m not sure that I appreciate that being the only reason you’ll accept my ring on your finger, Doctor.” Tony laughed, earning a small twitchy smile from the other.
People love the Stark twins. Their names on the few household inventions they produced were always considered the best. Their phones were so far above Apple and Samsung it was laughable. And most of all, they were so much more real than any boring CEO corporate billionaire stereotype everyone can’t help but imagine in their heads.
"So what you're saying is that you've fallen arse over teakettle over Miss Potts." Tony translated easily and with a shit eating smile. Anton hates that smile.
There’s this video. It was a long time ago. During a time where the closest thing to going ‘viral’ was magazines going over it with the occasional official newspapers and shows. Tony and Anton had gatecrashed a dance competition on a dare.
"You are not allowed to sleep with British Kyle anymore. Seriously, yesterday was 'fancying a nice hot cuppa tea,' and today is 'arse over teakettle.' What next? Will I wake up tomorrow to find you pledging your alliance to the Queen and country? Because I will not stand for such patriotic betrayal." The younger twin groans, artfully deflecting the topic. He's always been skilled at that but unfortunately Tony has decided that now would be the time to muster up all his attention span into a laser like focus and proceeds to tease him for the rest of the week.
Tony used to complain about that, especially when they were younger, when their differences were more apparent when their flaws were so obvious. “How can you just, do that?” He would ask frustrated behind closed doors, “How did you know she was going to ask us that?”
Tony remembers an equally grinning Anton snatching up their number, 84, with a cocky little, “Thank you.”
Tony reared back like he had been slapped. Anton quickly realized his mistake and tried to backtrack. "That's not what I- Tony, I didn't mean it like-"
"Nothing!" Tony eeped before frantically fiddling with his fingers like they were the puzzle to unlock the secrets of Atlantis. Anton side eyed his brother suspiciously, whatever the other man had on Tony clearly was embarrassing enough that he didn't know about. Because Tony may be the shy one but that's like saying a house fire is not as hot as a bushfire. The man is still pretty shameless is all he's saying.
Both Rhodey and Tony chuckled, immediately earning some ire from Pepper, but it was tinged with exasperation and fondness.
"Is- is that a reference?" Tony asks, "Because I'm kind of hoping this is the one reference I didn't get, instead of the fact that clearly you've finally gotten a crippling addiction by watching too many soap operas on your laptop."
Inwardly Anton winces at the sight, that particular invention was his project after all, and yeah, it works okay, he’s particularly proud of the motion constriction sensors- but it was a disgustingly ugly design, gunmetal grey and clunky in a way that brings back the image of that marshmallow ghost from Ghostbusters. Tony doesn’t think so but then again, Anton’s always been the more artistic and fashion-forward of the two. Unfortunately, they do not share the same opinions on that topic.
"You sick fuck!" Anton screams at the sidelines. It's a thing the torturing bastards like to do, make one twin suffer while the other watches. It's a good strategy, Tony can admit, hurt one to make the other move faster. It's certainly successful, Anton was always a bit lazy with his own designs, and Tony's fairly sure that the gun prototype in his twin's hand would be done in record time. "You fuckers, I swear to, stop it! I'm done! Time!"
Tony and Anton never really cared if no one could distinguish the pair, if anything it was just another thing they knew more about then the rest of the world. Their own little secret which was only known by the two.
are a businessman and an engineer.” Tony pointed out. “Both of which, are leagues better than Hammer.” Admittedly Hammer and Anton actually were probably on the same level in terms of business but Tony refuses to be objective about this. Hammer was a fucking dick who built shitty robots that malfunctioned and almost attacked a kid. Hammer could be the best businessman to ever business in man and Tony will insist he couldn’t sell a diamond for a nickel until he’s blue in the face.
If Hammer wants Tony’s attention, he’s certainly got it now. Instead of ignoring the man, he goes out of his way to point out what Hammer’s done wrong, his inventions, his clothes, his handling of his staff. Try and correct him. Help him.
"You are strong," Anton protests annoyed, but his voice sounds suspiciously choked. Not that Tony's doing much better. "You protected me from those bastards, if you hadn't decided to be such a stupid idiot and pretended to be me when I clearly didn't need the help-"
It doesn’t work. For some reason, Hammer got even more obnoxious and annoyingly needy. Anton says he’s doing it wrong. Tony doesn’t give a fuck. He has no fucks. His fucks for Hammer have flown off like geese in migration season that have gotten shot down by trigger-happy hunters and are never coming back. Why? Because he hates Hammer.
“I think I’m the only one in the world who can actually say- I’m going to bring you back to life just to kill you again.” Anton hisses through his wet eyes and clenched teeth. His hands were trembling from the stress of it all when he finally replaced Tony’s arc reactor. Just another layer of horrifying nightmare fodder to haunt him with, overlapping uncomfortably with Afghanistan.
It’s fast. Dramatic. Powerful. It’s a tango and it’s somehow so appropriate. They dance for dominance, switching the male and female roles, challenging the other to move better, faster, stronger. Tony slips out of his brother’s grasp with a sharp spin, sliding behind Anton like a snake, arms outstretched as he pulls him back toward his chest, into his embrace. Anton falls back with a half snarl, a half grin on his face, pushing forward like a lion reasserting his place with a roar, chest up, hands gripped harshly on shoulder and hand as he forces Tony to step back.
Natasha looks at both of them, eyes narrowed, pinning, reassessing. "This isn't over." She suddenly says, before turning her heel and leaving the lab.
Justin and Anton secretly dated for a decent amount of time. It made sense, they thrive on being businessmen, showman, sly and cunning and opportunistic. Their version of foreplay was investing in companies and seeing whose total stocks rose higher. Apparently the sex
Pepper’s phone buzzes and when she glances down at it, her posture immediately relaxes, making Anton relax as well. Tony must not have found anything too suspicious then. His smile becomes a touch less fake in response.
On the other hand, there is Anton who watches Hammer get arrested. Romanov is off talking to her superiors while Anton keeps an eye on his old friend. He wants to groan and sigh and blame Tony for not humoring Hammer, maybe the man wouldn’t have turned out like this if his brother had heeded his advice, or maybe it was always destined to be like this, maybe Justin Hammer was always going to be this desperate, sad man-child looking for ways to be better than he could ever possibly be. It doesn’t matter either way. Hammer tried to hurt him, hurt Tony, he is a threat that Anton can’t afford, not when there were so many unknown enemies in the future, hiding in every shadow of their past.
"What should we call the other one?" Maria asks softly, she cradles Anthony Edward Stark in her arms as a nurse gently plucks out the other one to hand to the awestruck new father. Howard looks at the tiny squishy human he had helped make and feels pride. They will be his greatest creations.
Anton just barely manages to carry Tony with him. Tony who had passed out from exhaustion at finishing the final touches of Anton's arbor, who had been unprotected and shot in the fight. There's sweat pouring into Anton's eyes, tears pouring out of his eyes, everything feels hot and close, too close.
“You’re not going anywhere, Tony.” Anton rasps as he enters the workshop. He looks terrible and exhausted but his eyes are hard with rage and determination. “Don’t fucking say that shit.”
In this universe, Tony teaches Anton to create another arc reactor, because Tony always teaches Anton whenever he learns something new, and that is the reactor they use when Tony suits up to fight Stane.
Anton looks at Pepper who takes the file and hands it to him. “Thank you,” He gratefully tells her and they both share a smile.
A few weeks after the return from Afghanistan. After Obie’s betrayal. Obie’s death. Anton asked Pepper out to her favorite Italian place.
Anton would lead the press by the nose with a winning smile, a glass of scotch in one hand and his brother by his side, adding any technical jargon he'd missed. Tony would shine in his research and inventions, his own pride shown to the clients and his fellow scientists with his brother oozing in the real charm to smooth the path to a successful negotiation.
There was a literal week where Ironman had to be put on hold because Tony had to pretend to be Anton pretending to be Tony because the real Anton didn’t leave his floor. And since Pepper was so kindly accompanying Anton, their self-imposed isolation meant that Tony had to handle some of Pepper’s shit, which was practically all Anton’s shit but with color-coded sticky notes. It was all very stressful and Tony ended up overriding the privacy protocols and sending a fire extinguisher-wielding Dummy up into his twins bedroom to run the couple back out into reality.
Tony fiddled with his hands awkwardly. "Promise, more like forced to agree under duress." He mutters snidely, because if there's one thing the Starks all have, other than amazing intellect, it's the inherent need to avoid all gooey emotions when possible.
Anton shuffled his feet uncomfortably, which meant that Tony needed to put down the wrench and pull all focus onto his brother because nervous shuffling meant feelings, genuine ones too. "That wasn't what I meant." Anton backtracked. "I meant that I may have... emotions. Toward Pepper. That may or may not be slightly stronger than what I feel for one night stands."
"Just because I don't have a porno bubble butt like yours-" Anton spluttered, deeply offended, before glancing at a rather baffled looking super spy. "-uh, Miss Romanoff? Are you quite alright?"
The Ten Rings asshole dunking him, pulled Tony's hair back painfully. Not that Tony could bring it in him to care when he had sweet, sweet oxygen-
"Nat please stop harassing Mr Stark." The metallic voice of Ironman spoke up amusedly. Now it was the spy's turn to drop something.
“Other than Banner I’m not exactly psyched about this lineup,” Anton complains as he flies in a more stripped down version of the Ironman suit to the Helicarrier. Just because Ironman was his official bodyguard didn’t mean Anton wasn’t willing to wear the armour at all, however for the public’s reassurance, he and Tony decided the ‘Tony Stark civilian’ suit should be more aerodynamic, focusing on speed and escape tactics than power and weaponry. Not that there wasn’t weaponry. A good offense was the best defense after all.
'Of course,' he said, without any hesitation. He came over and took her hands, full of concern. 'Is everything alright? Are you coping okay?'
'Really? The other day he killed someone just for playing music while he was on a date with your godfather.'
They didn't marry the girls, but they did keep chickens, and they did grow grey together, sitting on the porch and drinking coffee. In the end, when the new Sheriff clearly had even less intention of doing anything about it than the old one had, people got used to it. Their days had mostly been peaceful ones.
,' Sarah breathed, looking at it. 'Oh, sweetheart, that's... that's just breath taking.' She sat down on the bed beside him, pulling him close. 'It's your best work yet. I'm sure Tony Stark will love it.'
'You're burning up again,' Sarah said. 'The painting is beautiful, but you really need to take better care of yourself. You can't stay out all night.'
And the next few minutes were a blur of pain and anger as he struggled against the restraints, being pummelled from all sides, doing his best to headbutt, to bite anyone that came close enough. If he could just get a hand free -
'I got you a few things.' He sounded nervous. 'The people at the store said it would help.' He gestured at the table. Natasha looked and saw a small mound of chocolate sitting next to a hot water bottle, already filled, and wrapped neatly in a tea towel.
'Here, let me,' Jan said. They had been a thing, here, but it hadn't been right. In the end, she had picked an abuser over him. Maybe that was just how it was. Maybe Hank was her Tony. She did the cufflinks for him.
. He thought this was an exchange, his body for getting him out of trouble – he didn't realise, didn't know -
'You know, I can probably cover your rent for a while,' Bucky said quietly. 'Or you could stay with me. With work, I'm hardly ever home anyway. It would be like having your own place, except-'
'I wish I had some sugar lumps for you,' Steve said, regretfully, suspecting the real reason behind their warm greeting. The driver laughed, but Tony said, 'Check your pockets.'
It was harder climbing up the car than it had been climbing the hospital wall. He was still a little scared, and the car wobbled, and the windows were all broken which meant he had less surface to use and there were shattered bits of glass all around. But just like his dad had always told him when he was sick and trying to do stuff, he just had to do one step at a time. Slowly, he inched his way on top of the car and balanced along the length of it. He wanted to stop when he got to the end and work out the right angle and force for his jump, but there was no time. He didn't want to be spotted, and his dad and Mr Stark needed his help now, so he didn't even stop to think before launching himself off the car and onto the fence.
If Stark gave him any new evidence of his Iron Man activities, Steve decided, he would tell Shield about it. If he gave the slightest sign of being a threat to Peter, he would tell Shield
. Planned in full – and in secret – by Steve. It was big and lavish and excessive and everything Tony loved in a party and Steve didn't, the absolute bastard.
'Oh crap, crap, crap,' Barnaby said, helping him to his feet. 'I'm so sorry, James, I knew he'd go off if he saw us but I just wanted to – I couldn't
, according to his dad. Her grandparents were old friends of Jarvis' family, apparently, and so when she had come to do her year abroad she had come to the old gamekeeper cottage in the grounds of the Stark Mansion pretty regularly. Tony had liked her immediately. 'My year is almost over. I don't want you to be lonely when I'm gone.'
A tread came on the stairs and his head whipped up in hope, but it was only Ms Potts, surveying him as she came back.
'Perfect,' Tony said. He'd planted a bug on Steve for this exact purpose, so that Jarvis could listen in on the meeting. He'd remove it the moment his husband (and he still loved saying that,
Charity Marriage is a practice originating in the United States where a wealthy person marries someone living in poverty. It is a type of
His dad laughed at the joke, and Peter laughed too, because it felt funny feeling the laugh vibrate in his dad's chest.
Tony had never heard Pepper speak with so much emphasis, but that wasn't the real reason he was looking at her in shock. He turned to look at Steve, who was slightly red in the face, but held his gaze.
'Enough quips, ape. Though it does not yet function as we desire, this machine does already have a very useful function. It can inflict a most unusual and unpleasant torture. But perhaps I shouldn't spoil it for you.'
They were discovered too soon. They hadn't yet worked out a way to regulate the power to flow evenly from the arc reactor to all parts of the armour without burning out in seconds, and in normal circumstances Tony would have ditched it as a power source altogether and replaced it with solar panels or something. There was certainly more than enough sun here, on the rare occasion he got out to see it. Unfortunately, he didn't have any solar panels. Or any decent tools. He was working with a soldering iron he knew for a fact was older than he was. It was a miracle the armour worked at all.
'Well, happy birthday, kiddo,' Steve planted a quick kiss on his hair. 'Sorry, I must have forgotten all about it.'
So here we are at the final chapter! A huge thank you to everyone who has read, and especially everyone who has commented. You helped keep me motivated so I could see this fic right through to the end.
They looked good together. Right. Natural. Well-suited. And Tony was still looking at her like she was an oasis in the desert, like his every dream had just come true. Like he had just fallen in love.
'Eh, who even missed you?' Bucky said, giving him a friendly shove in the shoulder. Steve suspected Bucky was the one behind all this. They lived in the same apartment block and it had been Bucky that gave him a ride in this morning. He'd made Steve wait in the car whilst he sent a text message, and now Steve had a good guess as to why.
With that, it was gone, powering away from him again. Steve gave chase unthinkingly, because there was nothing else he could do. He would follow this thing as far as he had to to find a way to stop it. He was going to take Venom down, and get Stark back.
'You'll still live and do your other lessons here,' Meredith said. 'But for your science lessons you will attend lectures at Caltech, and work towards your undergraduate degree.'
And even though Tony had intended to troll him back, he couldn't let Steve worry about it a second longer. So he laughed, rested his head back against Steve's chest and said, 'It is romantic. I love it. I don't know what I did to deserve you.'
So, bubble tea. It was perfect; if he got one of the yoghurt-y ones it would be almost like food and drink at the same time. And it wouldn't take much swallowing, which he wasn't sure he was up to at the moment.
Well, that didn't sound fun at all; but it was too late. With a decisive shove the table was shoved into the hole, taking Steve with it.
The monster did turn round then, laughing. 'I don't want to talk, sweetheart.' It's large pink tongue lolled greedily out of its mouth.
got so bad it was like it exploded out of his stomach and had made an alarm go off in his head, and Peter tried to pull away, but Mr Osborn didn't let him, holding him tight and pulling him from the room. And Peter knew he had been really stupid, because obviously Mr Osborn had been the guy in the goblin mask, and now he had Peter captured and was pulling him from the room, and there was nothing at all Peter could do about it.
'Would it help you?' Steve asked, quietly. Beneath his hand, Natasha felt herself go stiff. This was the moment, she knew. This conversation was hard, it was so hard, but if she missed this chance – she nodded.
It was a stupid move. He'd seen bullets bounce off this thing; no matter how straight and true his aim was, Venom wasn't going to be hurt. And yet, he must have caught the thing off guard because the impact sent it flying, rolling over itself, the tentacled mass receding into something more man-shaped. Steve caught the shield as it came back to him, went to try for another hit, but before he could Venom was already back on his feet, snarling.
Steve shrugged. 'I thought about saying something a few times, but there didn't seem to be much point. And every time I thought about saying something I'd remember Bucky's face and...'
'Steve,' Tony said, knowing he shouldn't be smiling but unable to help it. He'd never seen Steve blushing like he was now. 'Don't worry, okay? It's a coincidence, it's based on
'You thought I was replacing you?' Tony asked. 'Don't be stupid, Clementine. I told you, didn't I? You're my whole world. And we are never doing this again, understand?'
Steve looked at him for a long minute, then turned on the tap, turning his attention to washing up the wine glasses. Tony waited, and sure enough, after a moment, Steve answered with a story.
Tony always lost track of time when he was in his lab, but when the cure was ready the tracker he had placed in Peter's phone was still showing at the hospital, so hopefully he wasn't too late. He flew over there, stepped out of the armour, and continued inside wearing only his flight suit and armed only with a syringe and what would look, to the untrained eye, like an innocent nicotine patch. If all went to plan, it would be all he needed. He followed the tracker to Peter's room, and peered through the small window in the door.
Consideration – Separate meetings take place where each marriage candidate meets their potential partner's parents. The exact form this takes can vary from a casual chat to a
Barnaby came back to the table carrying two beers. He set one in front of Steve, sliding into the other side of the booth before sipping his own. His face contorted in disgust.
‘Wouldn’t it be easier to just do whatever it was you said you did?’ Steve asked. ‘It would definitely be cheaper.’
Steve did, and it was every bit as delicious as it looked. Stark's smirk grew, if possible, even wider; but Steve finished the starter anyway. It was too good to pass up for the sake of pride, and anyway, he had agreed to come out to dinner. That generally involved eating.
There was no particular reason. He didn't even realise he was doing it until Mary pulled him into her arms, and he didn't know why he was crying, and he couldn't articulate it, why those buildings had set him off, but it was just one more thing that was gone, one more thing he had missed, and he hadn't even seen the street change the first time, and how much more had already been and gone while he was asleep? It wasn't just that Bucky was dead, and Peggy was dying, though those facts hurt like hell. Everyone he knew, everyone he had been at school with, everyone he had lived with, worked with, every guy who had ever beaten him up in a back alley, everyone he had ever walked past in the street was dead, or nearly. He was more alone than he had ever been before, and they were knocking down buildings he had never even seen. He'd cried like a child, detached from his own shame, with no understanding of his own distress. Afterwards, they'd ignored his embarrassment, told him it was the most natural thing he had done since he had woken up. Mary went to bed, and Steve slept on their couch. Richard stayed up for hours, listening, and Steve had talked and talked until his throat was hoarse about Peggy, everything he'd hoped they'd had and how little they'd actually enjoyed, about Bucky, how losing him had been like losing an arm, but worse; about dying to end a war and waking up to find it over, but not in the way you hoped, and not with the result of long-lasting peace. He talked about everything, really, and Richard listened to it all and stayed until Steve finally fell asleep.
She willed him to go away. She needed to use the bathroom - better to know the worst now. Unfortunately, Steve did not pick up on her desperation; or at least not far enough to realise he ought to go. Instead he sat down next to her.
He didn't pick up the Hershey's like the other man had. He got chocolate raisins, because he was pretty sure he had seen Natasha with a bag of them once. As he got towards the counter, though, he started to doubt himself. Surely chocolate was chocolate, and the man would have said if only Hershey's would work, but... well, until fifteen minutes ago he'd thought tampons were condoms. He was in way over his head. Steve went back to the shelf of confectionery and grabbed the same bar the man had got too. Just in case.
Bucky shook his head and rolled his eyes, then turned back to the fire. Tony made his way to the kitchen, where he found Steve standing by the sink staring into space. He hadn't yet turned on the tap.
'Don't sit down,' he said, not wanting the sheltering stranger to get kicked in the head, but it didn't look like Bucky was staying.
Tony kept right on staring, then set the bowl carefully back down again. He covered his face. For a moment, Steve thought he was crying. Then he realised Tony was laughing. Maybe a bit of both.
They headed to the door together. For a moment, it looked like Agent Romanov was going to say something else, but then she simply smiled, nodded, and left. Steve went back to Peter.
He still felt guilty over even this small lie. He prided himself on his honesty, and yet, when the truth would lead to disappointing someone, it was like his brain clicked off. He’d panic and lie and get himself into a much bigger mess. He just couldn’t bear to have let people down, even though he knew, really, the lie was letting them down more.
when Tony turned up. He hastily swept it into his pocket and shot to his feet, trying not to look too guilty.
'I'm trying to stop you passing out,' Steve replied, looking up the street. He gently reached forward and pressed on the back of Tony's neck, moving his head down. 'Stay here. Drink those. Keep your head down.'
Agent Meason nodded slowly. 'Okay. Peter, everyone else has gone to help your dad so I'm going to need to go check on that. I'm going to ask you to hide, okay? Just for a little bit while we make sure the house is safe, and then you can come out.' He cast around them, looking for somewhere for Peter to hide, and then gently nudged him into what Steve would call a broom cupboard but everyone else would probably just call a closet. 'I'll be right back,' he promised, and shut the door.
, the rate of Charity Marriages declined even further as even the wealth of the very rich was perceived as less certain.
But sometimes, you didn't want a customised item. You just wanted something basic to do the job, and you couldn't find it. Today was one of those occasions.
'I bet he will,' Dr Moore smiled, then settled her face into a more neutral position. 'Steve, when you first adopted Peter, you told me that you always wanted me to be straight with you about Peter's health and his condition.'
'What?' Tony asked, hunting around for something to mop up with, and eventually settling on a sweaty shirt that had been bundled up in the corner waiting to go in the wash for weeks. Given his distraction, it was Jarvis that answered.
'I just don't get why you're so tied to this, especially if his family is so awful,' he said. 'There has to be another way.'
'I don't know,' Peggy said, and turned to him with mischief in her eyes. 'I'd suggest there's only one way to find out.'
his super power and it was letting him down. What was wrong? Was he going crazy? Losing his mind? Or was it Alzheimers or dementia kicking in? No, no, he did not want to end up one of those empty shells of a person, wandering around lost, taken home by the police to somewhere he didn't recognise, friends and carers he didn't know – he needed to get home and run a full set of scans,
'Yes,' she said. 'I do.' Then, with an air of having made a decision, she pushed back her chair and walked over to him, high heels clicking efficiently over the floor. 'I am Mr Stark's personal assistant,' she said. 'But I am also
Despite everything, Steve felt himself lighting up, a light so strong it was as if his whole body was the bond mark, inside and out. He beamed.
given me medicine, I knew it would work, I just knew it, because everything you make works and I can do forward rolls now and look!' He took a deep breath in.
'Not long.' Dr Moore said. 'I'm sorry. You need to think about what you want to do next. He can stay here at the hospital, we'll give him the best care, but... I need you to understand. At this point, we would just be prolonging the inevitable.'
'The meeting is scheduled to finish in ten minutes, sir. However, Captain Rogers has just asked whether they expect him to lie to the general public just to make Shield look good, so I suspect it could go on for some time yet.'
'No, no more than usual anyway. Honestly I don't have much for you. It's a new material that could be made into some dangerous stuff. I don't know who made it or where, though I have a few suspects. One of -'
'I shouldn't be doing this,' Barnaby said. 'I'm supposed to be... but I don't care. I just...I need to see you. Please.' He sounded like he might cry. He sounded drunk. Steve was already on his feet and heading out the door.
'Do you think this is how they got the recording?' Steve asked as they walked, his shield raised and ready. 'That it came through this rift thing?'
'Don't,' Bucky said, 'Just doing what I should have done in 1938, and trying to make you happy, whoever you love.' He fixed Tony with a sceptical look, which made Tony's heart flutter, because if he was saying what Tony thought he was saying, then it would mean... Bucky smiled and turned to leave the room again. 'Merry Christmas, Stark. Merry Christmas, Steve.'
Steve knew what was coming and went limp, readying himself, because he was pretty sure Venom would be dropping him any second.
Soon after, Osborn became head of Oscorp too, and all deals were off. There were more drinks, more parties, more girls, and the satisfaction of his stocks trashing Osborn's. It was never quite enough. Tony tried to ignore it. By then, he was old enough and sort-of mature enough to realise they had just been stupid kids, that if he had been in Norman's position he might not have confessed either, and that a revenge trip wasn't going to do him any good.
When they broke apart, breathless, a long moment later, Tony's hand was on the back of Steve's neck; the warm blemish burning up again at his touch.
'What, you want me to prove it?' Steve asked, going and collecting the bag. 'You want me to open this and show you all the sprouts?'
‘They’ve made you a permanent exhibit.’ Stark pulled a tightly-folded museum leaflet from his pocket, unfolded it and started to read. ‘Due to popular demand, we’re happy to announce that this summer’s exhibit,
'Perish the thought,' Tony said, solemnly, trying not to giggle. He was remembering some footage he'd seen of the time the Howling Commandoes were invited for dinner at the White House, and the President had made a welcoming speech, had asked Steve to step forward – only to find out that none of them had turned up, as the administration had refused to allow Gabe Jones to use the front entrance with the others. It had been so hilariously awkward as the President tried to brush it off and sidle away.
want to ask Captain America to do a tampon run for her. Not in the slightest. She wasn't even sure she physically
'What? No, of course not,' Tony said, and Steve realised he'd spoken aloud. 'Not one second of it. Except,' he hesitated, then trailed off.
Steve did so, deliberately shoving against Bucky to get past. It was a well worn argument, one they had more out of habit than anything these days, but it still would have been nice to win at least once. He settled into an empty booth near the edge of the dance floor, remembering fondly the time he had given Bucky a purple band (
Steve had just readied his shield, prepared to take the man down, but Tony got there first. From the middle of his flight suit, a thin, whip-like tentacle suddenly shot out, moving so fast it crackled like electricity, and with one quick jerk snapped the man's neck. Steve looked down at the body. There was nothing he could do.
Judging by the address Barnaby gave him, Stark Industries obviously paid very well. He had the penthouse in a modern block of serviced apartments, all blacked-out glass and discreet spotlights. There was a concierge on the front desk who asked him which apartment he was here for and called up to check before he let Steve into an elevator that was probably the size of Steve's bedroom, and had nicer décor. It opened at last into a small lobby with just one door. Steve knocked, only to find it was already ajar. Barnaby was sitting on the floor, head on his knees, just inside. Steve dropped down beside him.
He and Norman went way back, and Tony had never yet managed to deal a finishing blow in return for what Norman had done to him.
The view out here never ceased to amaze him. It was one of the reasons he'd hired the place. For their first real trip away together, he'd wanted something special, and Steve had wanted to see Europe when it wasn't, quote,
Rhodes also came once or twice, even though Tony hadn't apologised to him in his speech, and spent the whole hour of his visit telling Tony what an idiot he was. Tony knew he was forgiven.
Steve seemed to be weighing his options. Finally he shrugged and said, 'Alright, fine. How did you find out?'
It was beautiful, much better than anything Steve could have achieved. Nestled in amongst the wrapping and a decorative layer of fern strands were carnations, lilies of the valley, peonies, dahlias and – yes, Steve reached forward and ran his fingers over it just to be sure – what was definitely a single dandelion, right in the middle. He was already smiling when he reached for the card that had been attached:
'That isn't really any of your business, blue-eyes,' Stark replied, and he reached forward to pat Steve's knee under the table. Steve moved his leg. Stark moved his hand. The pat was definitely becoming more of a rub, but just as Steve went to say something, there was a sudden flash of light.
Peter knew he had to stay on the bed, but all his toys and birthday presents were in the locker across from his bed. He lay down on the very edge and stretched as far as he could across the room. He didn't get anywhere near.
Maybe it had been a mistake after all. Stark was clearly insane; and while he seemed to be taking some twisted pleasure out of the constant rejections, Steve had to wonder how long this could go on for. Would Stark get fed up and leave them in peace? Or would he go the other way, and try to get what he wanted by any means necessary? Was he putting Peter at risk by refusing Stark’s advances? He knew he ought to talk to Shield.
Like everyone else that lived in the city, Steve had heard plenty of stories about Stark Tower. Chief among them was that nobody had been allowed inside since he had made it home from his kidnapping years before. Coming to it now, he could believe it. Although the door stood open, and Venom had clearly just gone in, the whole place had the eerie stillness of a ghost town.
The charcoal snapped on the page. Steve looked at him in horror, and Tony looked back at him in delight, because there he was, immaculate in full black tie, clean and shaved and ready, and Steve was there in only his jeans and an old sweater, bare-footed and hands black with charcoal. He'd even managed to rumple some of the dust through his hair. All of this added up to mean that for the first time
The engagement ring had arrived next, delivered by a man in a suit and the sort of face you couldn't remember if it wasn't right in front of you. Steve had put the black velvet box on top of his dresser, and stared at it, rubbing absently at the cold patch of skin beneath the blemish on the back of his neck. Given that it had only been a couple of days since the meeting between his mother and Stark, and that Stark hadn't been interested in knowing about him as a person, it obviously hadn't been chosen with him in mind. They'd probably bought the ring ages ago, ready to send out to whoever would take it.
He had never had cause to regret his decision. The creature from the cave served as the perfect flight suit, a perfect companion that helped him take back control, remove the variables from his life, and power the suits. Once he had sorted out his own life, Tony had remembered his resolve to make the world a better place, and had started to remove the scum from it. His flight suit remained, always present, content against his skin.
'Osborn has a dozen bases around the city and about a hundred that I know about around the world, but I don't think we need to worry about most of them. Given his note and his charming personality, I think the most likely bet is that he's taken Peter to where I stole the research, which just so happens to be his nearest stronghold to the hospital. I've got the computer calculating the probability and strategic benefits of each of the other locations in case, but I think we need to start there.'
'-knew you would, well, I didn't know you were trying-' Peter was babbling, as Stark dropped him onto his feet, awkwardly patting his shoulder. 'But once Steve said
And when they had danced together, it had just felt right. When Barnaby's hand left his neck, he had left it glowing. It had felt like fate was drawing them together, and when Steve had gotten home, he had painted like he had never painted before. His best work, the work that was going to be his ticket out of this marriage. The painting that was hanging right there in front of him at the end of the hall.
There was that word again, and about his mother. Tony obviously just used it as his adjective for everyone. Steve swallowed his disappointment and forced himself to focus, trying to remember which flowers he had already used. Tony would definitely notice if he doubled up on meanings.
Talk about incognito – he was basically unrecognisable. He had several day's worth of ungroomed, untamed beard growth sticking almost straight out of his chin. His face, what you could see of it, was greasy and pale, and his sweat pants were stained with coffee and oil. His hands were almost black. Coupled with the g;asses and the hoodie, which it was far, far too hot for anyone to reasonably be wearing, it was no wonder no-one had realised Tony Stark had just entered the store. If anything, it was amazing they hadn't seen him out. If Tony had seen himself walk in just then, he would have assumed he was here to rob the place.
Reaching the sleigh before him, Tony introduced them to the driver before climbing into the back and immediately burrowing into the blankets that had been left on the seat for passengers. Steve took his time, getting the owner's permission before saying hello to the horses, stroking their noses and flanks and getting nudged and nuzzled affectionately for his trouble.
If he had been a little slower, the bullet would have gone right through his heart. He'd turned away just in time, curling up instinctively, and the bullet had gone straight through his right shoulder and into his wrist.
It was a picture of Peter's drawing, the one Steve had shown him at the bar. It was taped to a gleaming chrome fridge.
where the wealthy party can demonstrate their charitable nature, and that their wealth is so substantial that a lucrative match is not needed; whilst the poorer party is able to access financial security and a more affluent lifestyle. It is often referred to as a 'Dime Marriage', a slang term pointing to the small amount of money the poorer party brings into the marriage.
'Well, he can keep wanting,' Steve snapped. 'I just endured half an hour of his dad lecturing me on his
obvious manner. The box of tampons, along with most of the other groceries, crashed to the floor; and with the part of her brain that wasn't completely taken up with Steve, Natasha thought maybe he was right. She was strong. She was strong, and so, so much happier than she would ever have thought possible.
habit, but he just couldn't help it. He'd made up a whole scrap book of full and part completed sketches that Steve had deemed unworthy of preservation, while Tony himself couldn't bear to see them discarded; in fact that had been how he had first begun to suspect that Steve returned his feelings in the first place – when he found picture after picture after picture of himself cropping up. Anything else in there, receipts or the notes Steve wrote to himself, he made a point of always throwing back into the bin unread. Always. No matter how curious he was. Except.
'Uh...' Tony looked at the man, and the mop, and had no idea who he was. 'Do I know you?' His voice was rasping, hardly recognisable as his own. Damn, he needed that tea.
being pressured into it. I got the feeling he just wanted us to be the ones to pull out rather than him.'
'You'll like it here, trust me, it's great, bubble tea is great, know what I recommend? Strawberry and peach, Steve!' It was getting hard to breathe again. He needed to trick Steve into taking him home. But bubble tea first.
'You don't like it?' Steve asked, taking a tiny sip of his own. It had been years since he had drunk anything and he could feel the alcohol shooting straight into his brain, not to mention his stomach. He was going to have to go slow on it.
In the early hours of the morning following his little visitation, Tony woke up to found his grief had been somehow dulled. He was ready, he thought, to start taking the painful steps towards moving on. Steve would want that, so Tony would. Maybe he had skipped straight from denial to acceptance. But the hand in his hair had felt so real.
That last afternoon was a memory that Tony would cling to, later, though it pained him like he was looking directly at the sun. Because it was only a few short hours later that their party was interrupted by Natasha telling Steve they had a mission, that they had to go, that the
Then, one day, he was sitting in their lounge having just finished loading the dishwasher after dinner, arguing that it took just as long to load and unload as it would to just wash things by hand, when something on the news made him pause. It was just a small local-news bulletin, showing some derelict old buildings being demolished. But Steve realised he knew the street, or had known it, once. The buildings they were knocking down weren't even the ones he had known, they were ones that had replaced those he was thinking of. And as he watched the report, Steve found himself starting to cry.
'Doctor,' she said, and because she knew his next question would be if he should go and get a doctor, she added, 'Wouldn't help right away anyway.'
The thing that he was lying on was the hospital floor, and the thing that had crashed into him like a freight train to put him there was Steve, just a little too late. Apparently Tony had wildly underestimated either how much sedative was needed, or how much difference Steve's instincts to protect Peter would make. Either way, he was now being dragged to his feet and lifted, slammed into the wall, pinned by the neck. Dots swam on the edges of his vision.
'That's some view,' Steve said, leaning out for a closer look. He'd always fancied trying skydiving, imagined it would feel like flying, but even if they had been able to afford it he would never have passed the medical. So he stepped up onto the bottom rail of the barrier, boosting himself up on tip toes, leaning out as far as he could, feeling the wind on his face, and thought it must be pretty close.
'Ask Peter to stay in his room, please, Jarvis,' Steve said, and Tony sort of loved that Steve was comfortable enough in his house to do that, and because he was thinking that, he didn't have any time to mentally prepare for Fury sweeping his way into the room.
But Happy or no Happy, Tony needed bubble tea as a matter of urgency, and the shop was only a block or two away. His aching muscles would probably benefit from moving a bit further than the confines of the lab, too. And so Tony made what was, for him, a fairly radical decision and decided to walk.
, thinking of the ludicrously flashy engagement ring still sitting on his dresser. But he hadn't sent a return gift yet, hadn't even started painting it, so he wasn't technically off the market just yet. He slipped the pink band on next to the blue. The Diva cooed sympathetically.
'Wait, where are you?' Tony demanded. 'Are you swinging? Kid, how many times, land before you call, if you get distracted -'
Tony rocked on the balls of his feet, his expression uncertain. Steve hated that that look was because of him. From now on, he was going to do everything he could until there was no trace of that uncertainness left.
. He had no idea whether Natasha's level of distress was normal for women or not. He had no idea how much pain it was normal for her to be in, or whether he had got her enough tampons, or, or anything. She was a member of his team, and if she had to go through this every month, he needed to understand it, to know how to fix it. No matter how embarrassing it was, ignorance was no longer acceptable.
One night, finally, out of sheer exhaustion, he fell asleep. And he didn't believe in spirits, or ghosts, the afterlife, angels, or visions coming through dreams, but after a while he felt a gentle hand combing through his hair, the palm broad and rough, and knew it could only be Steve. He didn't dare open his eyes. He didn't want to lose this. He hardly dared breathe.
And hadn't stopped thinking about him since. It had been an agonising torture not to use the number in his phone, but he'd decided he couldn't until he was totally free. Which meant he needed to wait here for Tony Stark to show, no matter how long it took.
'What?' The Skrull said, and then Tony shot him in the face with a repulsor he must have had concealed up his sleeve. Tony ran over to him, and Steve opened his arms for an embrace – but Tony stopped short.
'Knew you'd come,' he mumbled, then looked up at the person carrying him. He looked tired, and confused.
They had burst into the dance hall with sunglasses on and suits so expensive they could probably exchange them for a relatively cheap car. Tony with a jacket and pants colored with a deep red, just one tone above the darkness of blood, and Anton glittering in gold, they had no ties, but a handkerchief of their twins’ colors folded in their breast pockets.
"Just the ones that aren't on R&D." Pepper muttered but she did look at Anton thoughtfully, "Which is ninety percent of them."
"Anton's a better liar." Tony explains. Again. "He'll do the whole mourning schtick better than I ever could."
Rhodey learned that if you wanted sweet, nerdy time to hang out and chill with you give the older Stark a call, and if you wanted a wingman to help you score some pretty ladies at a club it was the younger Stark to ring up. He found they were both sarcastically quippy, childish and stupid in their own special ways.
Anton wonders how many times Tony must suffer? How many times must Anton watch his brother hurt? How many times until the Stark brothers stop drowning in their sins?
It sort of snowballs from there. Tony felt bad for the Captain, he didn’t know that he picked a two for one deal in the Stark department, but the man certainly gave as good as he got. Bringing their father into it was a low blow and Tony can finally see what Anton had been telling him all those years back when they were teenagers.
Steve sighed “I'm going to be totally honest,We were trying to figure out a way to trick you into getting your arm fixed”
Willow nodded patting Dum-E a couple of times as he made his own way to voice his concern,Pulling a long strand of hair out of her neatly tied ponytail “You're worried about me?” She guessed earning a concerned frown from him.
Bruce sighed “In order to prevent any other fights I'm going to tell you all,except for Tony,to get out.I have work to do,starting with fixing Tony's arm and I don't want to lose my sanity in the process”
“Hey,how old are you by the way? I mean, know it's rude to ask a lady her age but-” He looked down to face Willow “-spoiler alert I'm usually a rude person”
Tony sighed as he walked through the lobby wanting to get to work on some of his incomplete projects as soon as possible so he could just distract himself.Just for a moment. “Hey Tony!” He turned around to see Steve walking towards him his sketchbook in hand “I thought you said you were going to head out for a while” Tony sighed and tapped his foot angrily on the floor “Well I was,but the goddamn media wouldn't leave me the hell alone,In fact I'm surprised that they didn't follow me inside”
Tony let out a breath he hadn't known he was holding once one of the doctors told them the girl would be ok.He and Natasha followed a doctor who Seemed to be a surgeon down the hall and to a door on the right that led to one of the many patient rooms.The doctor swiftly opened up the door for them to reveal the young girl laying on a hospital bed.Inside where multiple monitors that recorded her condition such as her heart rate and blood pressure.Inside the bottom left corner of the room was a large brown chair and beside the hospital bed was a small desk with a lamp placed on it.
Willow made an attempt to stand back up “It was that funny,forget being old you two fight like preschoolers”
She was sitting contently on the couch focusing intently on making some sort of doll,With a sewing kit.He’ll ask her about it later,And then he'll tease her about it once she told him.Natasha,Clint and Thor had also sat on the couch,While bruce went to sit next to Steve,Each of them holding a cup of coffee,Even thor,and he didn't even know thor was and coffee person.Oh well.
“Tony we’re here” Pepper reminded,An amused smirk on her face as she opened the door but remained seated, Wanting to see the interaction that will transpire between the two.
Fury turned in the direction of the pen as it clattered against the ground,Stopping abruptly in the middle of his sentence.He looked at it for a moment his eyes flickering to where they sit before he picked it up.Willow quickly took the opportunity to walk over to Bruce and grab the flash drive,putting her figure to her mouth once more to empathize how important it was that they remain silent.She quickly went back to her original position,Fury never taking notice of the young girl.
Fury nodded in response “We didn't have to search much,it just fell out of the creature's mouth much to our surprise”
Landing without so much as a thump Tony immediately began to take in his surroundings. Looking down he was greeted with the sight of craters scattered across the street along with a bit of the sidewalk, a bomb would be his first thought if not for the shape of said craters. For starters, they were smooth and didn't have any cracks in them, as if someone sanded them down, and if that's the case then maybe they were made by a large drill of some sort? Tony filed away the possibility under ‘thoughts to bring up at debrief’. He looked at the surrounding buildings, some sporting more damage than the rest. His eyes fell to one in particular with really nothing special about it, just another office building like many in new york, Glass windows, which were now cracked, destroyed, or completely missing, lining the entirety of the building from top to bottom. Due to the damage done to it, It was thought to be the primary target.
Tony sighed there was no getting out or this was there? “We’ll go together ok,So I can prove it to you.He’s probably in his lab right now,we'll go there first” She nodded in agreement as he lead her to Bruce’s lab.He was gonna be so pissed at him for bringing a kid but fuck it his day might as well get worse.
“Oh that's sounds like a challenge....Challenge accepted!” With that she quickly ran off leaving Tony and Bruce to themselves.
She sighed “No rest for the weary” She reassured him with a smirk “I just have to deal with some paperwork.That's all”
She turned around to face him and seemed to think for a while “No.It wouldn't” She finally answered. “But if you really want to keep her in this city bring it up with fury and in quick”
“Well how do you plan on monitoring her?” Steve questioned “We don't really have anywhere to keep her in and I'm sure this girl has family that's looking for her” Fury seemed to think about this for a few moments “We’ll keep her in the avengers tower,I needed to transfer some agents any way,And as for her family,We’ll search through missing children reports and see if we can find a match.Until then she will be under the protection of  S.H.I.E.L.D, understood?”
They all stood up Tony taking longer than the others still lost in his thoughts.He sighed as he stood slightly surprised when he noticed Steve was standing beside the door watching him intently “Something wrong cap?”
“Alright,So what is it that you've found for us fury?” Tony asked actually interested in the subject at hand.At the question fury pulled something out of his pocket and slid something small and black through the middle of the table and to him.He quickly caught the...flash drive?...Before it could fall off the table,holding the device in his hand tightly ,Examining it “So I'm guessing you found this,In one of those…things?”
“Does it mean I'm gonna give any kids the talk!” Tony yelled at him “Besides you're the one who mentioned it”
Hello Avengers it seems that you have managed to hack into our system.Either you are smarter than we thought you were or you got help from outside sources but we could not care either way.I think you understand our motives but if you do not more fun for us.I know you are probably annoyed that this is not any information but since you have worked so hard to get this message I’ll make sure your hard work was not all for nothing.Right now there is a weapon on your perimeter and somewhere in your tower.You might also want to know that it will detonate once the clock hits 7:00 good luck not dying.
Tony frowned,letting his words set in.Who would do that to such a sweet kid?He had only known her for a few days and already he could tell how nice she was.Maybe it was someone she knew or someone she was related too.Or maybe she was just afraid,she doesn't deserve to live like that,And what ever happened to her family what if-
She seemed to think for a moment but smiled as she shook her head “No nothing special happened today,I'm just happy you're here!” He chuckled as she hugged him the height difference becoming very obvious.
Bruce paused his writing for a moment before chuckling,an edge to his laughter  “What's wrong kid? Think I'm gonna hulk-out on you over a chemical equation?” She took note of how he seemed to put more pressure on the pen as he spoke.
Fury looked at him for a moment before speaking again,Talking about possible solutions.Tony’s gaze lingered longer than the others,Watching out of the corner of his eye how Clint bit his fist as he placed as hand on Natasha’s shoulder shaking her slightly.She put her hand over her mouth as Clint shook her as if to conceal a smile.
He heard the others laughing lightly at his new name as he took the jacket off his head “Tin man? Really?” Tony couldn't help but question.
She chuckled as she placed the folder of files down beside her chuckling as she looked up “It's easy to sneak around this tower,Plus I learned the schedule of the shield agents and workers,all I had to do was wait for the right moment” She chuckled again “I just didn't expect you all to come in here,and something else I didn't expect was for you all to not even notice me when you walked in”
“Hey bruce your watch time is up!” Natasha called startling bruce while Willow didn't react.He put the clipboard down “Alright,Willow Natasha is going to take you now alright” Willow simply nodded as she stood up and began to walk out.Bruce looked back to the slip of paper he once wrote on but jumped slightly when he head a loud thump.
“But,if we can't tell you what hurt her then you can at least tell us the damage it did” He watched as the doctor walked into the room,placing the clipboard down on the desk “Like I said any longer and she wouldn't be here” The doctor quickly stated ending any more discussion on the topic. “Now if you excuse me,I have other patients to tend to” the doctor swiftly exited the room leaving Natasha and Tony to their thoughts.
Fury remained quiet for a moment “That information does not apply to you stark,For now all you need to know is that she is going to be monitored”
He was glad Steve wasn't angry at him for getting dazed,and nearly getting himself ripped to shreds.
“You know-” They quickly turned their attention to the table that was behind them “-It's rude to talk about people behind their backs but, don't worry,I can keep a secret”
She smiled as she walked out oblivious to the stares she got as she left the room.Steve exchanged a confused look with bruce who just shrugged.Tony quickly noticed the interaction “What?”
He began to run again bumping into someone who was walking in the direction of the elevator “Hey watch it!” the woman yelled.
She rolled her eyes “Please,I doubt that,Besides if I were to make quotes it would be insulting something”
“Tony where are you going?we have to meet up with director fury for our debrief” Steve once again glared daggers at Tony,obviously annoyed.
She looked at him for a moment,Confused before the realization of what he said hit her “Ohhhh,Was I rambling again?”
“Don't worry,We’ll be only a few minutes” Steve reassured.The nurse simply smiled before leaving saying nothing more as she headed down the hallway.
“...All I'm saying is that It had to be done” A man's voice said “I Mean, Look at how the bitch got my arm” he argued in an exasperated yet amused tone. A chuckle from a second party, a woman from what Tony could tell, followed soon after. There were a few seconds where neither spoke.
Tony quickly turned back around,And for a minute of so they both stayed quiet just looking at each other the silence stretching on for far too long “Um,make sure you don't spend to long in the workshop…”
She remained standing not facing him but quickly turned around,Smile in place “Ok” She swiftly sat back down earning a smile from steve “Hey when did you find out our full names anyways?” He could have sworn she avoided his gaze for a moment.
She quickly snapped back to reality and looked back up to him “Well my family didn't really let me watch TV much.They said it was too inappropriate,and my father and mother never really told me any news so that could probably be why I've never heard of him”
It had a bone structure similar to that of a German Shepherd except it was fucking huge compared to a actual dog.It had 4 large canines that looked like they came from a Saber tooth tiger,and if Tony was to be honest it looked like they had been sharpened.It had large brown fur that was wet with blood pointing to possible wounds it had or the wounds of somthing that got really unlucky.
Tony has alot of questions to ask Willow,but he won't he'll just pile them up on his head for now.He'll just allow what will happen,happen without question.
“Someone must tell her” Thor mumbled earning a few glances in his direction but no words of protest.
This will be fun to explain “Well it's just a cut I got while fighting my team says I should get stitches but it's just an overreaction”
Tony would be lying if he said he wasn't slightly surprised at her immediate interest in machinery,He was also shocked by how quickly she had known what it was.He hadn't even announced this to the public yet “Yes it is.Im trying to create a power source that could power large areas but takes up little to no space areas has no effect on the environment” Other details of the mashinery he kept to himself not even sure if Willow would even know what he would be talking about.
“Since When-how- ” Steve started but quickly closed his mouth unable to gather his words. He sighed not willing to attempt to ask his question again “Suit up”
Yep,That was not a fun conversation at all.It was just him and fury going back and forth about why and why not she should stay but all in all they stayed to their original arguments.Steve argued that ‘relocation’ choice could prevent her family from ever finding her and fury argued that he couldn't focus on his work and a curious child who continually snuck around the tower.
For most of the time willow sat quietly in the lab as Bruce sighed,looking down at his notes,Quickly scribbling them out and crumbling up his original piece of paper and getting a new one to write on.At first she didn't say anything but when it was the third time he had repeated the process She decided to speak up “Maybe you should take a small break,It's not good to work while frustrated”
“Oh,That's right,I said I would explain when we came back…” She seemed to think about something for a moment “So wait what were you doing while Tony and me where gone?”
Bruce nodded “Bingo.It ended up as everyone arguing in how to read whatever was written on the computer,some sort of code”
Her time with Natasha was similar to her time with bruce,She stayed silent most of the time and made sure to not cause any problems.Natasha and Clint had chose to stay in the gym and decided to combine their 45 minutes,both choosing to watch her for the full hour and ten minutes together.Willow didn't react as Natasha and Clint began talking,never objecting to the topic of their conversation “So wait she made her way into HQ?” Clint motioned towards Willow who just stuck out her tongue playfully when she realized she was being acknowledged.
Natasha leaned up against the door frame as the doctor began questioning them. “What did this to her?” the doctor went to face Tony as if he expected him to have an answer.
“Because that's my job-” She smirked           “-doing the unnecessary crap that makes your lives even harder.Cause I'm young”
He needed to get out of this fucking place.These god damn suits were not helping him forget or at least pretend like nothing ever happened.He quickly stood up Jarvis saying something but he couldn't care less about what it was.He quickly opened the door to quickly walk out but bumped into something
IM SO SORRY!!!! I'm really sorry guys that this is later then usual but I wanted to edit this chapter to the best of my ability but I hope you like it and I know that the first few chapters are pretty slow but I promise that in future chapters I will fix that.Anyway I hope you guys enjoy!!
Pepper glanced at Tony,impressed,before turning back to Willow “The pleasure is all mine,Tony has told me a lot about you”
She quickly walked if not ran over to the computer and studied the symbols on it for for a while longer “So you want me to just read this straight up or…?”
It was a mumble;barely even a whisper but in their silence it was heard,Tony tore his gaze away from pepper’s to face Willow who still had her gaze downcast “Willow...?” He spoke softly as if he was afraid he would startle her.He watched as a mix of emotions made it's way across willows face as she realized what she had said before quickly sitting up “We should get out of the car before it's overrun by Tony's fangirls” She stated casually happily acting as if nothing happened “Surprising how many girls fall for a guy that flies around in a can”
Hey guys! Sorry for taking long on this one.it's not as long as I wanted it to be but since I promised to update sooner I tried to make this chapter as soon as possible.I'm also sorry if there are any errors in the text I hope you enjoy!!!!
“Don't know kiddo,Probably best not to think about it right now” He he said ruffling up her hair,learning she was quite fond of the gesture.
Steve turned around to see Natasha and Bruce smiling as they greeted him,He smiled as bruce motioned him to join them “Hey Steve,What are you doing here?”
“Don't know” Natasha responded her answer slightly muffled by the large crash of,Something,in the background which Tony was guessed was probably from the hulk.
“Who tony?” Bruce found himself asking.She shook her head “No,He had a sketchbook,So It was Steve?” Bruce nodded “Yeah that's Steve” He smiled “Also be careful I don't want to hear news of you getting hurt” She paused for a long moment before smiling “Thank you Dr.Banner I wish you the best of luck on your chemical equation” She waved goodbye to him exiting the lab,The entire time bruce watched her warily.
Tony chuckled.This kid had way too many manners “No,It's fine if you're down here as long as you don't distract the developers” He waved vaguely to the scientist that had been scrambling around the room with clipboards in hands writing down the results of each test.
“Know?” Willow continued with a chuckle “Your codes are easy to crack,You adorable little bot made all sorts of panicked noises when I first came in”
“Ok,enough chit chat come over here Tony I need to remove your bandages” Bruce quickly stated ending any more discussion on the topic.Tony said nothing as he obediently walked over to Bruce who immediately started to take of the blood stained material.
He snapped out of his thoughts,His gaze settling back on Willow who just smiled without end “....thanks kiddo” his mind
“She's a smart kid” Clint finally thought out Loud grabbing everyone's attention “What I'm just saying,Probably would be a sneaky politician”
He smiled “No need to call me by my last name,You, little lady can just call me Tony” He smirked as he whispered to her but still loud enough for everyone else to hear “That's what my friends call me” She giggled at the response.
“You two having fun?” He asked in hopes of getting his mind focused on a different topic,his work also becoming a distant memory.
Tony gasped in a playful amazement “Brilliant solution Dr.Banner,You know,You never fail to impress me”

“What are you doing here?” His tone was harsh but it wasn't as bad as it was when he spoke to her.Tony couldn't help but smile.
“Exactly” Tony said never taking notice of how she jumped up and down with excitement when he turned to grab a tool.
“Hey bruce!” He entered the laboratory Willow following close behind him.He didn't have to look for long since he quickly spotted bruce...and the others.What the hell was happening? “I don't mean to interrupt your conversation but,I totally do mean it” He paused for a moment “Anyone care to tell me what you're talking about?” They exchanged glances with each other before looking back at Tony.
“Here he is” Tony entered the room wearing a black t-shirt and gray sweatpants,quickly taking his seat already getting annoyed glances from the small group.
Willows eyes lit up with interest at the words,That was strange “Yeah I know,You said you were friends from the start.I understand that you have no romantic feelings for her”
The briefing would have taken to long, he argued. He told the Captain that Fury could give them information on the situation in the jet and surprisingly Steve agreed with him. He was quick to get into his suit and fly as fast as he could, everything else be damned. The rest of the team were flying in the quinjet Steve once again agreeing with him, encouraging him (Insane right?) to just go. “Tony, what's your position?”
“Shit 50 minutes had already passed?” Tony mumbled changing the topic unconsciously,Internally scolding himself for not keeping track of the time.
“A doctor told you,you needed stitches but you didn't get stitches?!” She asked nervously,She looked at him worry written all over her face “Holy crap,Holy crap! You should get stitches now!” Shit,He should have left out the stitches part.
She looked back up at him “How do I know you aren't just saying that to calm me down?!” She tapped her foot on the ground impatiently.
He wore a silver mask that covered up his nose and wrapped around the bottom half of his face while keeping his hair and eyes exposed. He wore all black pants and shoes (Cliche isn't it?), along with a bloodied T-shirt to match. Tony's eyes drifted down to the man's right arm, Examining the large gash that went down from his forearm to his wrist. Small droplets of blood slipped off his hand which lay limply at his side while his other was firmly planted on his elbow, probably in some vain attempt to ebb the pain. Despite the distance, Tony could see how his eyes narrowed for a moment before shifting into an icy blue glare. “What, What is it?” The women asked from behind him, pushing him out of the doorway and into the hall so she could see what all the fuss was about. Her eyes widening as they landed on Tony.
“Next sentence!” She repeated ignoring Clint’s statement “Hello Avengers it seems that you have managed to hack into our system….oh that's not good.Either you are smarter than we thought you were or you got help from outside sources but we could not care either way.Oh their rude,Rude bad guys are the worst”
Tony didn't know what to say to that, so he chose not to say anything as he tried (and failed) to make his way towards the door while avoiding the puddles of blood. Good thing his suit was redder than it was gold or else it would have looked like he stomped someone to death.
Clint chuckled “She reminds me of someone” He turned to smirk at Natasha before walking up to Willow waving as he did so “So Nat here says that you gave captain and Bruce quite the scare when they saw you in HQ,names Clint by the way” He smiled as she shook his hand,Confused at the long pause after the handshake but didn't question it “If you want my advice on sneaking around I suggest you use the vents”
“Ok so I get the no strings tied part” She started earning a nervous glance from the super soldier “But-”
“Oh,get me a cup too” Tony glanced at the ‘Fox’ and sighed “Something tells me we are gonna be in here for a while”
Willow giggled “So?I've heard so much about Ms.Potts and I would love to meet her,plus she must be a good friend of yours”
“Oh screw you I'm 14,kids aren't creative.Now common or else I'm gonna use your credit card!” She was already out of the room when she spoke the last sentence.
”-Organism,wasn't alive when this process to occur? Even Though there are signs of oxygen and carbon dioxide there are very few amounts”
Taken the amount of time that's passed and Tony's regular habits bruce had probably finished with his arm and he was most likely hiding away in his workshop,Fixing his armor or something.He sighed as he navigated his way through the tower and to Tony’s workshop and He smiled as he heard the faint sound of rock music through the metal door.
“Whoa kid easy,it's just me” He reached out a hand,ready to steady her if she was dizzy from getting up so quickly.
She shook her head “It's nothing,Just some lady noticed the scar and started to ask a lot of questions and just wonder stop staring...” She tapped on her neck a few times as if Tony had forgotten where it had been located.
She returned the smile “Then let's not focus on work then.Oh I've been meaning to ask you,Who's this pepper I've been hearing so much about?”
“Um,yeah I don't have anymore pictures drawn in there yet” Steve quickly said changing the topic from the picture.
She glanced at Fury waiting for his response “Well….I think this time I can let it slide but next time…” He paused for a moment “Next time ask the agents if you can watch them,I would hate for you to get into some serious danger for knowing too much” Willow smiled as she nodded causing him to sigh in relief “But we still need to find out what the screen says” He glanced at Tony “Stark,Do you think you can get us in?”
He shook his head “No everything's fine,In all honesty I was going to ask you that question” He paused “Are you alright Tony?” His eyes drifted to the large bandage on his cheek,that bruce was kind enough to give him.
Bruce shrugged “Well it's something toxic as hell cause it's been leaking radiation ever since it was put on that table”
Steve shifted quietly in his seat “There was no way it was on there by accident.Either it was horribly hidden or they wanted us to find that”
“Captain rogers sir,How may may I assist you?” The computer greeted.He would never get used to Jarvis would he?
“Hey Willow calm down” Oh crap she's hyperventilating “How am I supposed to calm down?! You need stitches! Do you know how many bad things can happen if you don't get medical treatment?!” She quickly covered up her face with her hands.
“I would have been indirect,Scientifically indirect!I expected it from Bruce Ya know him being a doctor and all”
“What it with you and all the old jokes?” He chuckled as she stuck out her tongue and shrugged in response.
