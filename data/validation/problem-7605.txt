Pepper stared at him in bafflement.  "...you know what a gynecologist is, right?  A doctor for women?  An omegologist is a doctor for male omegas."
It was weird how this all felt normal.  Tony understood why Steve hadn't wanted to kneel at the Expo; this was clearly and undeniably a submissive posture.  It was very un-Captain America.  But between them it felt right, intimate, and Tony didn't feel like they were in any sort of power dynamic.  It was just a set of roles that happened to work for them.  He didn't think of Steve as less than him, just different.
"That man's my friend," said Tiberius simply, and a moment later he'd clocked Pietro in the jaw.
"There's...locks on them?" Steve asked, a little confused as he took it from her. The metal felt cold under his fingertips but the back was padded with some kind of leathery material, presumably for comfort. He felt kind of ill just holding it. The fact that one time he'd wanted Bucky to buy him one of these was
"Now come on Tones. Stan needs his privacy right now," Happy said in a slow, easy tone whilst Pepper dared to step closer to Tony. But she didn't touch him.
.'" There was a glint in his eyes.
"Afghanistanniversary?" repeated Steve.

"Steve," she hissed.  "He was on the
Steve found Tony passed out on the sofa. Maybe he'd been heading upstairs, but he clearly hadn't made it the whole way. Steve sighed and went to put the food in the fridge before he gently scooped Tony up. The Alpha mumbled something Steve couldn't understand, but didn't really wake. He frowned as he looked down at him, spotting a few bruises to accompany the one on the back of his head from earlier. Tony had carried on working, then. Steve carried him upstairs and moved to set Tony down on their bed. He fetched a damp towel and wiped away the evidence of his work, the grime and grease from the workstation.
strip into three-dimensional space is
"It's no one's business. But yes, obviously you're with me... obviously you're not an acer," Steve breathed. "Maybe you should do a interview with some Alpha magazine about it. Something that will make you feel more..."
"You can open the water, man."
"See you," Steve murmured. The massive crowd of omegas honestly intimidated him more than any of the Alphas in here, mostly because he cared what they actually thought of him. He swallowed and stepped into the mix, heading to the bar in the corner because that felt most natural. Barely any of the drinks were alcoholic and there was nothing stronger than Riesling wine; even the glass sizes were small.
to me, you'd already know that I've been involved in omega rights for my entire adult life."
"Access.  Right," repeated Tony.  He lacked a comm but it didn't matter; anything wireless was something he could jerry rig and pick up in the helmet.
"I don't want to talk about it," said Tony firmly.  He just knew Steve was probably thinking up some speech.  "Let's just move on, okay?" Tony had always preferred to deal with things by crushing them into boxes and then burying those boxes deep.
Buck stared at Rogers and he had a sudden memory.  The two of them on a worn couch, Buck stroking his face, gently bending his neck, biting down on it... a vase of tulips in the dining room, a silent plea for him to understand that he was just too sick to be mated, that none of the beta girls
"Plums."
"No, he's gone, oh, God, my omega, this is my fault, oh God."
"I'm going to try and talk to him," Natasha said quietly. "Alpha to Alpha, see if I can talk some sense into him-"
"It's a good suit," Pepper said as Steve walked out, praising Aria's choice. "You ready?"
"You mean to end them," clarified Phil, looking like he was on the verge of putting his face into his hands.
listen to you."
"Tony?  Tony!"
"Yes."
DeSoto shrugged weakly.  "Lots of people, um, camps, and maybe... maybe people who wanted a house omega... um... maybe... maybe people who... who rent them, you know..."
"I'm sorry, you think I’m a spy because I didn't
. Steve didn't have to deal with all that today.
"Give it."
"Or what?  You're gonna make me?" demanded Tony, his face breaking into a grin.  "No, that's cute, really, Rhodey... but you shouldn't try on other people's clothes without asking, it's rude... careful with that reactor, by the way, that thing'll burn you... it looks good on you, I gotta admit... is it weird that I think you're kinda cute in the suit?"
Pepper let out a barking laugh, clearly a stressed sound, and ran a hand through her hair. Steve put a hand on her arm. "I'll make you a coffee," he told her and she shot him a grateful smile. She had a complicated coffee order but Steve still remembered it from being a PA. He had been a good PA and he almost missed it; Pepper had been a good person to work for. It was why so easily they'd fallen into such a good friendship now. Or at least, Steve hoped.  Lately, since his heat, things had felt weird between them.
"How can they even say this?" Aria shook her head, her voice a little thick. "Don't they know what the goddamn word
"Now, if
Steve let Tony get the towel himself, not wanting to emasculate him in anyway, and tilted his face up for his Alpha to clean up when he returned from the bathroom. Steve blinked up at him as he wiped the last of his spent away, blue eyes shiny. "Tony." He nuzzled against his Alpha's thigh, hands curling into the sheets as he resisted the urge to grind against the them like a frustrated teenager.
"...I need it."
"I have a
"He can't go in wearing a collar, can he?" asked the man on Malick's left.
Happy laughed from the front seat. "Don't worry. They use the same thing over and over. They don't mean anything."
!"  Tony swiped for it yet again.  "Phone!" he barked. "Put Pepper on!"
The audience laughed again.
the Winter Soldier."  She lifted the hem of her shirt a little.  There was a scar on her stomach.  She locked eyes with Steve.  "I don't even know if he's human, Steve.  It's not him."
Tony went into the fridge and grabbed a new carton of orange juice, fighting to open it.  "No one knows about his...?"
"Shh... sh, sh, sh... I won't hurt you if you behave.  I only want you to kneel for me, Steve. I want you to kneel and to call me Alpha."  There was a note of perverse excitement in Gideon's voice. "I want to feel your cheek on my thigh and to put my hand on your head and, for just a moment, feel what it would have been like.  That's very little to ask. And then you can go back to your mate and we will hopefully never cross paths again." He rolled his fingers over Steve's scent gland. "Surely that's not too much to ask?"
"Where are we going?"
were so damn happy?  How come Natasha didn't have to deal with this stupid trio crap?  Was it because she was more dominant than him?
"Hey, get some sleep, boss," said Happy.  "See you tomorrow!"
"I always go up to the lodge for Christmas Eve," interjected Tony.
him.  He didn't even know his own name, but he knew that smell, that familiar smell he'd known since childhood.  That was his omega, and his best friend, better even than Colonel Karpov, and he smelled scared and he wanted to go to him, reassure him that everything was under control, he'd completed his objective and everything was just fine.
"Go ahead, try it on.  We won't lock it," she encouraged Steve, then laughed.  "If you lock it, you buy it."
"No, it's always are you going to have
him.  I'm on
"Hm?"  Justin looked down.  "Oh, I didn't even notice."  He didn't let go, still stroking the skin on the inside of Steve's wrist.
? Are you kidding me, I don't need you to treat me like I'm some neglected kid or something, I take
"...and I never told anyone before," added Tony, voice cracking.
Slowly, he sat up and clapped sarcastically.
"...Malibootium?" repeated Tony.  "Well, it does have the word booty in it, so that's a plus..."
to Steve.
Maybe he just needed some fresh air.
Pierce tented his fingers thoughtfully and swiveled in his chair at the head of the table.  "Oh?"
"Oh.  Right.  ...I can't believe you fell for that.  He's Captain America, seriously.  And you're... well, kind of a shitty Alpha.  Hey, don't worry about it.  At least you got approved for action.  C'mon, get up, we'll get some drinks."
Tony cracked one eye open.  "I am not a morning person," he growled.  He looked over Steve's bright, sweet face.  There was some peach fuzz on his jawline and upper lip.  Steve looked damned good in the morning, in a rugged sort of way.  "What's the point of having a day off if you wake up at six, anyway?"
His accent was vaguely Eastern European, maybe, but he couldn't recognize it.  He felt guilty for listening to the man's conversation on the phone so he picked up the magazine and pretending to be interested in it, even though he wasn't reading anything in particular.
"Okay.  Are we all ready?  It'll be better to get there early just in case we hit any technical bumps."
.  Steve's expression was one of fake shock.  He had a feeling it was actually Aria's suggestion.  But he saw the humor in it.  And it was also making a point.
"It felt really good at first, but now it just kind of hurts. I think I need to sleep. Maybe if I sleep then I'll heal and it won't be so bad again," Steve murmured. Still, even now, his body was responding to Tony rubbing up against him. He could feel himself getting wet but he also logically knew how sore he was down there.
Tony grinned.  "Yes. Yes it does.  So afterwards, we'll have to go take a shower together... or go skinny-dipping in the pool.  We can shoo out the reporters, if you want, go for a swim. Unlike the ocean, my pool is heated.  Should be a cool eighty degrees." (Steve had seen the steam rising off the pool into the cool night air earlier.)  (Tony had absolutely zeros qualms about being naked in front of his party guests; he'd probably slept with a good third of them, anyway.)
over and over.
"Steve," he repeated, mouth watering.  He paused from the small, circular little motion he'd been making with his fingers, but kept them pressed behind Steve's ears.  "Steve, would you... um... would it be okay if you wore the collar for me?"
Steve leaned his head on Tony's shoulder. "If they hurt you because of me I don't think..." He trailed off, not wanting to finish that sentence.
There was a strange tugging sensation in Steve's gut. It reminded him of the miscarriage. He felt
There was a pause.
"...you disapprove of my drinking," said Tony flatly, looking at him.  "I'm getting a vibe... like you're disappointed.  ...you never drank, before the serum?  Whiskey is like super-soldier serum for Starks, you know.  Dad practically embalmed himself.  ...it's not that bad, is it?  I keep an eye on it, you know.  I just need a little, to take the edge off.  ...like how you exercise for like, four hours a day.  Six?  Whatever."
He watched Tony with his concern. His mate was clearly uncomfortable. "Hey, Tony, maybe take the collar off for a minute. You don't want to make your neck all sore," Steve said, a hand on his arm.
He ran his tongue over Steve's head and tasted a drop of precum; he shuddered a little, not sure if he liked it or not.
"...good morning, Mr. Stark," said Dr. Brazinski.
Between outings with Natasha and Sam and Tony, Steve was wading through press releases and public appearances, guided by Aria.  He had an upcoming dinner at the White House and had spoken in passing with Agent Coulson and Director Fury about getting into the field.
Steve went quiet for a moment. He moved to sit down, his other hand rubbing over his face. "Thank you for letting me know Clint. I appreciate it," he murmured. For some odd reason it comforted him, knowing that Bucky in his little freezer box had Clint close by...it was better than thinking of him all alone, in the middle of nowhere. "Look. Me and Tony are about to head out, so I better go...but thanks for keeping me updated Clint, and I'm glad SHIELD aren't being too awful."
"It's easy, you just pop the cork out."
"Yes?"
"How bad's that?"
He checked his watch.  "We should see them soon.  They're going to go in first and clear it for us."
"You can blame Steve.  He's the one who got me prepped," said Tony.
Steve kissed the edge of his jaw. "How do you want me?" he whispered.
He was reluctant to ask anyone for help but he was pretty sure he would need to ask another Alpha for tips.  Unfortunately most of his friends were either unbonded Alphas or betas.  The closest thing he had to a friend who was a bonded Alpha was...
"I didn't feel the bond before when Bucky was
"Do you know Spanish for ironing clothes?  I think Gideon must have misinterpreted my name... Iron Man does not actually have any idea how to press a shirt..."  Tony was keeping his tone one of forced casualness but his heart was pounding in his chest. If the omegas didn't walk, he'd have to make some hard decisions.  And once they were bought... then what? Maybe he could just "hire" him, like how he had "hired" Happy.
"Swift.
"...status?"
That made Lydia blink.  "...certainly," she said.  The elevator pinged for their floor (the second to the top) and they stepped out.  Almost immediately an omega was offering Tony a glass of scotch; Tony took it gratefully.  The omega glanced shyly at Steve. She was young, with dirty blond hair pulled into an elegant braid.  And she was wearing a heavy silver collar with what Steve suspected were several hundred thousand dollars' worth of rubies set into it.
He moved to sit on the pool floor again, closing his eyes as Tony's silhouette rippled over him through the water. Steve smiled and opened them again as he saw Tony drifting further along the pool, practically seeing the tension easing out of the other. Steve pushed off the bottom before he ran out of air and gently ran his fingertips across Tony's back, emerging beside him. He took in a long breath.
She pulled him into a one armed hug, her other hand holding a glass of wine. "It's good to see you." Her smile was bright, genuine. "My mate insisted we come. You know, big history geek and all that... she is getting one of those orchids, or else she might kill someone." Haley laughed then winked.  "This is kind of insane though, huh?"
"I'm not allowed to drink," said Donner.
"I'll play with them," said Natasha, sitting up.  "You take my seat, Laura."
"I need you to get out as quickly as you can!" Steve shouted over the rumble of panic. He moved to the nearest pillar and knelt down, tucking his hands underneath and gritting his teeth. With a groan he lifted the thing up. It was goddamn heavy and he could only lift it so high, certainly not over his own head. The people rushed out from the gap he'd made, though they had to duck as they went. Steve's arms trembled a little with the effort, he couldn't stand like this before. With a grunt a moved backwards, leaving a decent enough gap before he set the pillar down. His arms felt odd once the weight was gone, a few beads of sweat having broken out on his forehead.
"Donner," he said, standing close to Tony for his own sanity. "Please."
"Maybe we should call it a day," Jane suggested tentatively, a hand on Derick's arm. The male beta looked ready with some kind of retort, despite the 'threat' having been aimed at Callum. "It's been lovely to meet you both," she told them, turning to face Tony and Steve. "And we hope you have a wonderful birthday, Mr. Stark."
"...Dad liked war," said Tony, watching Steve stare at the photo.  "I don't mean he wasn't aware of how awful it is.  But you gotta understand... he was rich, and he wasn't really affected by things like war rationing or the draft.  To him, it was like... like an extreme sport or something.  He loved being a pilot, he loved building weapons.  He built weapons because he liked winning and I guess he wanted to keep people safe, or at least, that's what he said.  ...one of the first songs I learned on the guitar was
Tony looked up, then suddenly seemed to snap back to himself.  "No," he said quickly. "I mean-- I mean sorta-- no." He was actually turning red.  "You can open it upstairs. ...it's just for you. And, um, I guess Donner can see it, too."
"No more chips, Stark.  Either throw in a collar or get out."
"Still counting. The donations won't stop coming in for a while, Steve. But thousands, hundreds of thousands." Aria looked excited herself, she was practically bouncing on her feet. "This was awesome. You're awesome!"
Tony stared down at the muffin.  He wanted to ask Steve if they were really bonded but he didn't want to look stupid in front of Sam or Natasha.
, it was a Captain America cake.  Bunny was sitting on the table beside Tony, a birthday hat on his head.  Tony had no memory of that and felt something akin to betrayal that Peggy Carter had these photos; if they ever leaked, it would ruin him.  They were...
"...I daresay that's how this whole mess got started.  You know, people putting ideas in their heads. Director Fury has a soft spot for them.  He got one or two loyal, obedient ones and before you know it..."
"It was a very complicated time," Steve tried to offer. "It's been a long week. I really think you should both try to calm down before you have this conversation..."
"We should get you some water," he murmured and leaned forward and kissed Tony's forehead. Steve took his hand and gently lead him towards the kitchen.
Dr. Gleason filled in the silence.  "...did you know
Well, he was sure as hell awake now.  Steve was probably making breakfast.  Tony was starving.  He crawled to the edge of the bed and found his jeans, pulling out his phone.  Notifications: 100+.  Not surprising, considering what had happened in Monaco and at his birthday.  He went to delete them, but before he could, a new call came through.
"I can't...I c-can't work out if I'm hot or cold," Steve frowned up at the ceiling. "Am I getting frostbite? Tony. Tony I don't want frostbite. Please...."
emotionally equipped to handle this.
recognized me, instead of replacing me completely.  ...but if it had, I would've deserved it. I pushed you away." He scooted closer to the edge of the pool to dip his feet in, observing the way the light refracted so that his legs looked they'd been sliced apart and then pushed back together a little off-center.
"We've all been there," Natasha hummed. It took all three a moment to realise she was serious.
just... I'll be ready to go again in thirty or forty minutes, okay?"  Tony didn't want Steve to think he was losing his edge.
She laughed. "Easy?  You're joking," Pepper said and patted his arm before pulling away. "Night Steve."
Tony looked from her to Steve.
Tony, on top of him, groaned, rolled off, grabbed the phone, and threw it at the door, clearly trying to kill two birds with one stone.  Or one phone, as the case may be. Both of them could have predicted an early wake-up call, thanks to Steve's actions the previous day and the consequential fallout... not to mention, of course, the media explosion that had come with rumors that they were going to buy a collar.
He reached up and placed a hand on Steve's jaw, gently turning his head and brushing their lips together.
The man was backing up, slowly.  "Yes, yes, all very inspiring. As impractical as it is motivating.  I can't wait to start seeing omegas joining special forces teams. It will certainly make my job easier."
Steve could feel like a tug in his gut and he felt sick almost instantly. Tony was upset. Tony wanted to leave. Tony was...disappointed? Steve blinked and rubbed a hand over his face, pushing wet hair back from his forehead before he stepped out of the shower. Why had Tony flipped? What had- was it about-
"His hearing," repeated Trickshot.  Tony still looked confused.
Steve took all the blue pills he'd missed under Gleason's instruction, especially considering all the ones he'd thrown up. He felt weak and shaky, like he'd just recovered from a virus. When Sam had fetched the pills he'd also grabbed the blanket, and he put it back over Steve's shoulders gently. Steve offered him a quiet thanks.
Worse, they got up early.  Like, horrifically earlier.
Tony closed his mouth, clearly disappointed that Pepper had anticipated his quip.
Tony blinked.  "You got me a present?  But I don't need anything," he said, stroking Steve's hair.  "I'm rich, and I got you." He stretched a little, feeling himself twitch inside of Steve and Steve's body respond in turn.  He smiled a little. "...it's not another orchid, is it?" He kissed Steve's temple and settled down on top of him for a nap.
.  He felt like he was eight feet tall.
"Fuck!" he squawked at the crimson liquid blooming in his palm.  He sucked on the cut, looking around for a pair of car keys.
I'd found home."  Steve swallowed when Tony remained quiet. "Please," he said after a moment. "Just...say something."
isn't even close.  You look
They'd spent the last two months apart because of Steve's previous bond, which had mostly healed.  But now it was back, big and bold and unapologetic. Steve's bond with Bucky was no longer the ancient, wispy thing it had been.  It was a real bond... or at least as much as it could be, considering the state of Bucky's mind.
Steve blinked and a terrifying realisation washed over him. It was Tony's phone he just answered and now Pepper was on the line and she knew that they were together in the same place at ten in the morning...
MAJOR CONTENT WARNING FOR THIS CHAPTER.  I don't want to give spoilers to our tiny but dedicated fanbase, but I want to warn you that Steve gets hurt in this chapter and there is some medical/physical trauma.  THIS IS ABOUT AS BAD AS IT GETS.  The angst machine is going full-tilt and we offer no apologies.  You have been warned.  - T
"...I wonder what's gonna happen to Jack," Tony murmured.  If Jack had been in on Justin's plans, then maybe he would go to an all-omega prison.  If he hadn't, he'd be on the outside, his mate incarcerated.  Then what?
Steve paused to think about it. He was pretty sure he had watched Bucky dance with some girl to it once. But he shook his head. "Nah. Sorry Banks," he said. "A lot of my old memories are kind of fuzzy anyway."
"I'm having a baby," said Donner, hand going to his stomach.
They all seemed terribly inappropriate considering the apparition Steve had just seen.
"Tony, I'm locked in, I'm not in control here- the suit's gone rogue."
"C'mon, Steve," he said quietly, dragging Steve off toward the bar, hoping no one would talk to them on the way.  Clearly this had been a terrible, terrible idea.
"Are they...coming to the house?" Steve asked in a murmur. "Or do I have to go out to see them?"
She smiled at him.  "The first one can take a while."
Bucky stared hopelessly at the array of spiral notebooks, unable to make a decision.  After a moment, he hesitantly pointed to the red one again.
After she'd left he'd grappled with his feelings, then been hit with such a sense of panic that he was overwhelmed by it.  He didn't remember crawling under the bed or shielding his head. He just remembering babbling about Germans and trying to figure out where the hell his extra clips were, which made no sense.  Maybe he was quoting
bonded.  Come on, Tony, seriously.  That was just a recruitment tactic.  I mean, I'm flattered, but obviously, I'm with Bucky.  Sorry."
A reporter dashed out in front of him. She was a blonde, her smile bright. She thrust the microphone out at Tony and half out at Steve in the process. "Good evening Mr. Stark. Is Captain America your guest of honour for the night?"
A camera flashed off to their left. Steve ignored it. He leaned down and kissed him.
Everyone was leaning forward.
"Hey," Steve said. "Give me your phone. I'll be two secs."
"Please don't put magnets in your head!" Steve called back, grabbing Tony's favorite shower gel and shampoo and shoving them in the floor of the shower. The selection they had was ridiculous. A few weeks into first moving in Tony had decided that Steve had to try
Yet another person he'd never have and didn't deserve.
The Clint thing was a tricky one. Clint had essentially told Steve to drop it...he wasn't sure how he would handle this new information. Steve was almost tempted to call Nat. But he knew that if say, Sam, went around his back to Tony before telling him something important that he wouldn't like it. "I'll Clint later. He's an adult. We don't need to protect his feelings."
"The Avengers Initiative is about strong people with strong personal relationships making up a stronger team. Any bond comes with strengths and weaknesses- I've seen that in Nat and Clint," Steve said slowly, speaking his thoughts aloud. "My bond with Tony is no different. I can't promise I won't sometimes be biased towards him but I can promise I'll try my best not to be. And on the battlefield, doctor, I'm not an omega. I'm just their captain. Plenty of Alphas followed me in the forties; I think with an adjustment period, Tony could manage it now. Not that that's relevant now- he hasn't even been approved for the field yet.
?!  God
"Fury's Avengers Initiative went belly-up... the World Security Council nixed it," disagreed Tony.
Steve laughed gently at Tony's joy and ran a hand through his hair soothingly as he cuddled against him. It felt pretty good, actually. It felt good that people knew and that the response was positive and supportive...that meant so much to Steve. He represented the people, didn't he? If he was going to make change then this felt like the right way to do it.
omega.  His ex-omega.
"We need to go home," Steve said and reached for Tony's hand. "Come on. I'll keep an eye on you."
. Is Tony there too?"
"You want to break?" offered Callum to Steve.
"...let's say maybe to the platinum one and go shop around some more," suggested Tony, handing Kitty the half-drunk glass.  "...and maybe we should talk about... about what we're really looking for, y'know?"
"Where'th Captain America?"
Nine overheard him.  "Oh, you'll be fine, Greg.  You're super cute and nice."
He admittedly wasn't entirely sure what Tony meant by 'bow' like this but Steve had an idea. He moved to place his hands flat on the bed, his forearms pressed down too. His fingers bunched lightly in the sheets. And then he leaned down, his forehead pressed against the mattress but his ass still in the air.
He spun around in his chair and pointed to the lab bench.  "Sit. Roll your sleeve up."
Steve didn't have to see Tony's face to know he was feeling. He was disappointed in him, or at least, that's what it felt like. Steve realised Tony was just like the Alpha on the floor who had sneered that Steve wouldn't be able to torture him; he'd been brought up on the history of "Cap." The playing cards, the comic books, the propaganda... but not the reality. That Steve was a soldier. He killed people, he
"It's not your suit anymore," replied Rhodey calmly.
Natasha pulled back and cupped his cheek briefly. "It's good to see you too. Come on, Clint's inside."
The two of them began walking down the dark corridor, Tony's footsteps loud, Sam's quiet.
Stress, obviously.
"I listened to her music this morning.  Still super undecided on that..."
, by the way, I love you even if you hate black licorice.  But you'd better not.  Naw, seriously, it's fine if you do."  Tony nosed the back of Steve's neck, running his hands up and down Steve's forearms.
Boswell waved a hand.  "Oh, four, five years, that's nothing."
He frowned at that and stood, moving to grab clothes to just not be naked in front of the other. Steve heard a tapping sound and ignored it. He busied himself with buttoning up his shirt and then pulling on trousers. Howard made a sad sound as his long legs disappeared under dark grey fabric. Steve rolled his eyes. The Alpha really was awful.
"But Mom promised!"
"...Steve," he said suddenly.  "...Steve, I just thought of something.  Remember how I sort of joked we needed a medication nanny?  ...what about Ty? He's your friend, and my friend, kind of, and we know we can trust him, and he's an omega but he's not an omega who goes into heat... I doubt I'd even be able to smell him while you were in heat."  Ty's unsettling smell always caused people to lean unintentionally away from him. But when Steve was in heat Tony doubted a tire fire could have bothered him.
Perhaps Peggy appreciated the simmering resentment because she dropped talking about Howard and went back to taking Steve through a photo album of Tony's early childhood.
Without any prep before Steve was probably going to be sore later on. But he didn't care. He would revel in it. Fuck. Sometimes turned Steve on about being taken like this...the whole of America thought he was some pure golden boy. Something tickled Steve the right way about being the opposite of their expectations. He also reveled in the rebelliousness of it all.
The waiter caught Steve's eye.  He didn't smile but there was a silent approval in his look.  He disappeared as quickly as he'd come.
This, he understood, was why so many Alphas on the news were saying no one would want to bond to Steve, why they were saying he was practically feral.  An omega with Steve's level of independence was difficult to be bonded to.  Tony had probably aged more since mating Steve than he had in the five years previously.  The stress was killing him.
The scientist walked out and there was the sound of a door closing down the hall; a moment later, a young, blond omega was standing in front of the door.  He was in track pants and a t-shirt, and his arm was in a sling, his hand heavily bandaged. He rapped his knuckles against the glass.
His note-taking paused abruptly at a case with an extremely wide, ornate collar.
Sam hopped down. "I'll go get them."
Boswell grunted.
Tony was feeling calmer.  Here in the dark quiet of the backstage bathroom, where the only smells were cleaning products and his omega, where it was just them... yes.  He felt better.  His lip was throbbing painfully.
With his hand on the wall he made his way out without into anything. Steve was tempted to call for Ty but he couldn't really do anything about it, and Steve didn't want to scare him.
...fucking heats.
There was a pair of legs in front of him.  Someone was sitting on a couch beside him, one leg crossed over the other, shoes shined to an immaculate gleam.
Phil sighed quietly. "I don't think anyone really is."
"Tomorrow, you wanna go see Churchill's war rooms?" asked Tony.  "I know you've already been there but I think it'd be cool... and then you can choose the next thing to do... as long as it's not Trafalgar square..."  (The last time Tony had been there, a pigeon had landed on his head. Tony was not a fan of pigeons, who probably carried all sorts of germs. Pepper had gotten a picture, which Tony had made her swear never to show anyone.)
!  You want me to get you ten million dollars, cash, within seven or eight hours?
, ignoring Sam and Tony's fight and Pepper's entrance. He'd bitten down hard on his index finger and then started drawing on the pale flooring beneath him. Even with blood, Steve was a good drawer. His eyes were glazed over and he looked focused, muttering quiet nothings to himself as a face was soon drawn in red by his hand.
Steve couldn't get back to bed after being kicked awake; he got up and went down to the gym to smack around some bags before getting in the shower.  He jogged downstairs to make Tony his favorite breakfast, hoping to tempt him to get up, but Tony seemed resolutely determined to sleep in.  Steve decided to let him.
"I'm not hurt."
Steve was terribly hyper when the reality of what they'd just achieved hit him on their way back on the drive. Steve was practically bouncing in his seat.
"Hey, look, Clint's with it, SHIELD is guarding it, it's okay, it's safe... I'm gonna get into the files and it'll be fine, we'll learn all about it and we'll be able to handle it... "
Banksy returned a few minutes later, grabbed Steve (pointing out that Steve had promised him a breakfast for coming over the night before), and dragged him into another room. 'Breakfast' apparently consisted of the leftover doughnuts from last night (and a brusque "get in!").
"Steve!" hissed Fury.  "It's fine!  Go!  You're worth more than I am!  Go!"
"I'm not like Fourteen or Twelve."
...was it because of the lab, or because of him?  Was Tony disgusted by him?  Repulsed at seeing Steve in action?
Gently, he carried Tony to his bed before Steve began to systematically search his apartment. It took a good few hours, going through his books taking over an hour in itself.
"It's at least sprained," Doctor McCloud hummed and knelt down to look at it. She then grabbed some scissors to cut the bottom off of his jeans before pulling off his shoe. She didn't expect Tony to be prepared to move away from his mate again just yet. "I need this X-rayed. For now I want it bandaged with a splint," she told the nurse who was finishing up Tony's face.
"Well, I was around for his first heat, and other than a single incident, he seemed pretty with it," agreed Mackenzie.
appreciated it. He knew that this was a big thing for Tony. And it certainly felt fantastic...he would maybe ask about that other thing Tony had done with his mouth the other day. That had felt fantastic.
"Get a pitcher at the local dive?" suggested Happy.
"Yay," said Tony dully.
What she was saying was true, but that didn't make it hurt any less.  He didn't want to be Steve's silver medal.  But Bucky was dead.  That should have been the end to it.
"Very common, actually.  Alphas in particular are prone to mood swings when their mate is in heat," said Gleason, pulling off his glasses to clean them.
He looked up just in time to see four people before something slammed into him, rattling his bones to the very core.
He looked out the clear door again, but the hall was still empty.  Where the hell was Karpov? How could Karpov abandon him like this?  He wanted Karpov. Wanted the comfort his handler provided to him, the knowledge that the world was an ordered place and that he was a cog that rolled smoothly through it.  A grain of sand on a vast, incomprehensible beach that only needed to
"They always ask such stupid questions, don't they?" sighed Irshad quietly. "Not, oh how are you going to make the world a better place? Or, how do you feel about climate change?"
"Wait, can I get your autograph to send to my dad?" asked One quickly.
"...stop undressing me with your eyes, Rogers.  ...come on, put my mental clothes back on.  We're friends.  Look, let's... let's look at this logically, right?  You're an independent, modern omega and you don't want an Alpha, and I'm a modern, independent Alpha who doesn't want an omega.  We'd regret it if--"  Tony stopped, mouth watering.
“I’ll wake you up in four hours, Tony,” Steve assured him softly as he slipped down off the bed.  He resisted the urge to tug the duvet up over Tony’s shoulders.  “Sleep well,” he whispered before he slipped out the door.  Tony didn’t respond.
he did. But Tony was also half awake still, or at least dopey. "Give it five more minutes," he mumbled, sliding down on the bed to wrap his arms around Tony and tug him against his chest.
"A singer type of artist. Last I remember you guys were yelling about Pitbull. Because if you still need someone I might have something, I just wondered...you know," Aria said, not looking at him as she tapped away on her phone, replying to all of Steve's emails.
"Steve," choked out Tony, though his labored breathing.  He congratulated himself on maintaining some semblance of being cool.  "Steve.  I love you.  If I lost you... it would be like going back to that cave."
, for what it's worth.  Yes, life's been wonderful for
Tony's possessiveness.  Was he just being nice or...?
Tony's stomach turned yet again and he realized that David Gleason was in his fifties; he'd probably been born in the sixties, during the very first civil rights movements for omegas.  That his brother might well have been forced-bonded as part of a completely legal ceremony. That Boswell's casual description of his bonding ceremony to Banksy ("He cried the whole time.") was something much more sinister.
Tony knew Steve's mind was already made up.
"Any other questions?  Anyone else find any typos?"
"I know," Steve said quietly and glanced up at Natasha, leaving the topic there.
"What do you mean,
"They go to a gynecologist."
Steve's phone pinged with a text. He opened it. "Happy says he's picking us up in twenty minutes."
"What if I mess this up, Tony?" Steve whispered. "What if I already have? What do I do then?"
"So, uh... Hawyeye works for the government, huh?  ...how's he... how's he doing? I mean, we haven't seen each other, since, well..."  He laughed awkwardly and rubbed the back of his neck sheepishly. "I guess it's been about twenty years.  How did he end up...? Is he bonded? Kids?"
Tony wearing a squirrel outfit was only helping him feel even crazier."
"I know, love."
"You did well to get him here so quickly."
"Hey," Steve breathed as he stepped inside, smiling at the sight of Tony still curled up in his bed. He leaned in the doorway. "How are you feeling?"
"This device is designed to create an electromagnetic field that keeps the foreign objects from moving in your atrial wall.  However, the electrical output also appears to be affecting your sinoatrial node."
to ask, the people want to know, Captain... any plans to expand your family?"
"Alright, Boz," said Banksy, giving Boswell a kiss.  "We'll try to keep the rowdiness to less than a hundred decibels."
His hand froze in the air instantly.
"I'm nearly done."
"...shut up, JARVIS.  Yes, remove it," snapped Tony.  He'd thought he'd told the AI to forget about that.  Sometimes JARVIS was too smart for his own good.
He ran a hand down the other's back and looked up at the ceiling. It was white with some kind of textured pattern drawn across it. Steve thought he could make out birds amongst the swirling shapes.
"It's a
He popped a strawberry into his mouth and then dusted his hands off on his suit.  He was dressed casually, probably because Pepper wasn't here to tie his tie for him.  She was caught up in meetings all week. Tony had opted for a pair of dark jeans and a button-up shirt; he'd left the top buttons open and rolled up the sleeves, the result being a sort of sleek grunge that suited him well.  The arc reactor was peeking out, but Tony didn't seem to care.
"And how's the..." Banksy made an awkward gesture with his hands. "Neck situation?"
Steve gasped out an empty breath, his cheeks stained a dark pink. "Fuck," Steve breathed, the air knocked out of him as one leg fell off the side of the bed, letting Tony sink in deeper.
in there.
Ivan's parting words will still ringing in Tony's ears.
Tony drew away with a nostalgic smile.  "You remember when we first met? Not when you smacked Happy onto the floor, although that was hilarious.  Not when you interviewed. I mean like your first day as my PA, when we started talking about omega rights.  And I called you uppity. And nicknamed you Sparky. And thought you were such a smug little omega... oh my God, I was just like the rest of them, I was such a tool."
"This dinner is supposed to be about your anniversary and you're over here getting drunk and flirting with four random women!"
"Every day, Tony," she teased, kissing his cheek, leaving another mark on his skin.  "Are you going to suit up later?  Jenny and I were hoping Iron Man would put in an appearance..."
"Are you ticklish?"
"I know. I know you wanted to get them together but trying them out in front of other people really stressed me out Tony. I'm sorry. I wasn't very good yesterday...in a lot of ways. Sometimes I just feels like I have to be above everything, like I'm immune to stuff- and when I'm not it just comes crashing down."
"I have your bird!" shouted Justin suddenly.
Tony blinked in confusion.  How the hell had-- why were there omegas here?
"No.  No, it's not the same.  And anyways I'd never ask that of you, Steve.  I would feel too bad. Just forget it, okay? ...and... thanks.  You know, for... not thinking I'm a terrible person."
"Oh, no, you don't!  I killed you!  You're dead!" yelled Tony, lunging into the fray.  No suit, but they were already dead, so what did it matter?  He wasn't afraid.  Not anymore.  He had been chewed up and spit out and now that he remembered who he was, he was going to come out swinging.  The complete and total lack of logic didn't bother him anymore.  He remembered his name and he knew that this gorgeous blond fellow needed his help, and that superseded any of his earlier miserable musings about inadequacy.  In death, all men were equal.
He stared at Karpov, uncomprehending.  The words that came out of his mouth next were utter nonsense and he had no idea why he said them: "Howling Commandos."
"Tony!" hissed Pepper.  "Behave!"
"Hey... guys... can you, um, can you see about tracking down an Ashtray and a Trickshot?  They were two omegas that were sold to those camps," said Tony, casting a glance around the room.
Still talking.  Tony didn't dare turn to look at Malick; he just wanted to go back to their room and hide out for a while before dinner.
Pepper's phone went off.  "Oh and now Chloe's in on it.
that's an old article, sorry... oh, but look at these pictures!"  He flipped the tablet around to Natasha to show off a picture of Steve, shirtless.  "And who's going to get to mate that hot piece of ass?  ...maybe a certain spoiled tech billionaire...?"
"That your bond is exploitable," said Coulson with forced patience.  "The Winter Soldier is an Alpha.  You're an omega.  We'd expect you to see Stark and for Stark to be possessive.  But for the Winter Soldier to show up, unprompted, and call you
Steve looked confused by the key and Tony realized he'd never driven a modern car.  Steve got around on a motorcycle, a Triumph, and those hadn't changed much.  Cars were another matter.
"--that was the last time I saw him.  Fighting, yelling... twenty-two years ago.  It's been too long. He's dead. I know he's dead."  Clint voice was bitter but had gotten back its steadiness.  "...thanks for telling me, though, Steve."
" cried Tony, immediately getting sucked into the crowd.  It was an eclectic mix of tuxedos and short dresses and bizarre make-up and even though Steve had been unfrozen for well over a year, it was a reminder that he was in the future and everything was different.
"Steve," said Tony loudly, striding over.  "For the last time, it's a valet, not a car jacking!"  There were a few nervous giggles in the room; Tony was already embracing Steve.
"Steve?" asked Tony, trailing his fingers through the water.  "I'm glad you're in this century, even though I know it's probably real hard.  Because... because omegas get treated a lot better here.  I know it's not perfect- not by a long shot- but... back in the forties...hell.  Now you can go to college and buy a house and vote and everything.  And I know I'm not the most progressive guy in the world, but I always thought omegas got a tough break."  A pause.  "I mean, I know how they get treated."  Another pause.  "They treated me like an omega.  In Afghanistan."
Tony felt relieved when Steve disappeared again.  He sipped his whiskey happily, finding a rerun of
"Call Gleason," Aria murmured to Pepper with sudden urgency as she sank back down onto the heels of her feet. "Pep, call him now."
Everyone must have looked shocked.
Steve's eyes shot up, his hand hovering over his keys. There was a red headed woman outside the window, tapping wildly at it. She was speaking to him but no noise made it through the glass. She looked afraid.
"If we stop listening to omegas who decide to be housewives than you're going to cut off about sixty percent of them," Steve pointed out calmly. "I'm a soldier. I have nothing in common with people who lead domestic lives but I don't think judging them by it will help us much, Tiberius."
Was Steve a nester?  Was that it? Bucky couldn't recall.  He would have promised just about anything to get Steve to mate with him.  Obviously Steve wasn't entirely ready yet, though. Not mentally, at least.  Physically, Bucky could smell his desperation, smell it on his skin and smell the delicious juiciness between his legs.
. Stop." Steve screwed his eyes shut tightly. Every time Tony tried to pull out his ass burned at the attempted rejection. It made him whimper and squirm uncomfortably, his cheeks hot from embarrassment instead of pleasure. "You need to breathe. Breathe. Calm down."
But Steve was already hit.
"I think I like Taylor Swift." Steve grinned. "Doesn't mean I should be in a music video, though. Don't think that's quite my jam."
"--can separate our their pair-bond from their work," finished Coulson.  "Can you?"
, Mr. Stark!"  With that, she turned and walked out the door, slamming it behind her.
"No.  Fuck-" he gagged again, but didn't throw up.
"They're happy to be here.  They're moving up. They're going to good homes, with Alphas who protect them," said DeSoto.
"Too easy."
Tony had forgotten all about that.
He settled down with them, pressing up to Steve, cuddling him unabashedly.  He wasn't normally one for displays of affection but Steve's heat had turned him into an emotional mess.  "I'm so glad you're okay," he mumbled into Steve's collarbone, still worked up from the brief moment of not knowing Steve's whereabouts.
"I still don't remember it happening. I've tried to, but I don't," Steve said in a whisper, head still bowed. He almost felt guilty for it...like he owed Tony the truth. But he didn't even know it himself. Did Steve encourage Bucky? Did he give him permission? He was shaking a little; his hands were clammy.  "Least it isn't messed up, I guess," Steve said and before he knew it he was leaning back against Tony, his head against the curve of his shoulder. He felt like he was floating... like he wasn't really quite here. Tony's touch was grounding as he stared up at the ceiling. "I don't want people to see that."
Bucky couldn't be here. Steve moved to back away and then loudly walked into a metal cart behind him, knocking off files, medical instruments, and several small tubes full of bright blue liquid.
"It's certainly one of a kind," said Mackenzie.
, are you kidding me?  Are you
Every single omega waiter and waitress (and there was a lot of them) moved to set down their trays. Most of them just put them down on the floor. They untied their aprons, undid the 'uniform' collars they were wearing, and dropped them too. It was all very calm and very well coordinated. And then they started walking out behind the five auctionees. And suddenly it wasn't five omegas walking out; it was about thirty.
Tony gave Steve's hand a tug.  The collar had ruined the experience for him.
Oh, how he'd missed this.
, he'd claimed him, after all, and Steve had accepted him.
"Focus, Pepper, we're talking about me."
read the caption.
We love hearing from you, readers!  Your feedback gives us the warm fuzzies.  :)
Steve smashed the little ceramic pot that the orchid had been in.  He picked up a chip and crushed it like it was a beetle; Tony let out another noise of protest and grabbed his hand.
But neither of them understood.
Bucky's entrance and attack had been too sudden for Fury to react; he was slammed against the wall.  Phil and Maria drew their weapons. For a split second, it appeared Phil was going to shoot Bucky.
Tony froze, mid-pace.  Of
Steve didn't quite know what to say to that. It was so sweet and sincere that it rendered him speechless. His cheeks tinged pink and his expression was raw and exposed as he watched Tony pull of his top. Steve reached up, his fingers tracing around the arc reactor tentatively before they dipped down into his abdomen.
It was a bright, beautiful day; Tony pulled out of the dive and shot himself straight into the cloudless blue eyes.  It was the same blue as Steve's eyes.  Tony's heart hammered.
Tony patted Steve's head.  "Thanks, Stevie."
Steve grinned and leaned his down to kiss the top of Tony's head before he moved to grab the shampoo. Steve squeezed shampoo into Tony's hair and moved to rub it into his scalp before gently rinsing it out too.
Aria mumbled something about stepping outside to have a smoke.
He felt... close.  He couldn't quite describe this feeling, post-heat.  He felt an intense affection for Steve. Love, intimacy... going through it together, he felt like their bond was... well... stronger or something.  This, he realized, was the point. Heats were all about knocking up omegas, biologically. But emotionally, afterwards... he felt closer to Steve than ever.
"-and I can't take it back because I joined some government spy organization, very hush-hush. I'm doing that now-"
Tony’s hackles went up.  “Yeah. Book literally anyone other than Pitbull,” he instructed her.  He walked over to ruffle Steve's hair, still holding the carton of juice.  Phil's nose wrinkled at the idea of Tony drinking straight out of it.
"Can I leave you two lovebirds alone now?  Can you go a day without having some sort of over-dramatic mental collapse?"
Steve nodded. "He looks kinda scary."
"He's a super-soldier; he's healing great," said Tony petulantly, pushing off the covers and sitting over the edge of the bed.  "...and why don't you serve drinks on hospital wards?  Ethanol is a disinfectant, isn't it?"
Steve sighed and shook his head. "Forget it.  I'll just our room and wait for you. A nap sounds more tempting right now... you have fun at the dry cleaners." He leaned over to kiss Tony's cheek.
"I don't think she can do it. I think she lied."
"Sorry," repeated Donner.
"Takes a lot for me to work up a sweat," Steve pointed out a little breathlessly. It was true. Clint had once despaired at him. They'd been sparring for over an hour and Steve hadn't even broken out in a sweat. The archer had just rolled his eyes as Steve offered him a hand to pick him up off the floor yet again. "
Tony only got to hear Steve's side of the conversation but he wasn't especially enthusiastic about it.  He shook his head at Steve as Steve asked what Fury needed them to do.
"The nature of our relationship?" Steve echoed and raised a brow. "My-- my first Alpha gave me a miscarriage."
Once he was home he tried out some of the yoga poses he'd learned before with Aria, seeing how far he could stretch on one of the gym mats. He let JARVIS play him Ludivico Einaudi. The music was serene and it washed over him with a sense of calm. He wasn't sure what the meeting with the Wakandan king would be like later, but it sounded like it was more a formality than anything else.
That was the straw that broke the camel's back.
"Hail, HYDRA," called Yasic after him.
"What do you want to know, about, erm..." It was like he was afraid to say it. Like they would find him if he did. Rex looked almost afraid. It reminded Steve of that Voldermort thing in the Harry Potter books.  People being scared of saying a name in case the thing found them. (Steve had loved those books. He tore through them in two weeks.  He hadn't sleep much during.)
"No one's left you anywhere," Pepper supplied gently. "We're all here Steve."
He looked the pair over.  The woman was wearing a very long, thin shirt over a bikini bottom.  The man was wearing thin, flowy pants and a shell necklace.  These people did not seem like a threat, except for maybe the dog.  If they could command the dog to attack him then he could be hurt.  He knew he could take the dog, but he felt weak and shaky and he hurt all over, especially his head, and he didn't want to get bitten.
He was sad they weren't holding hands anymore.  His mind was still looping through all the things this blond had said to him.  That they were bonded, that he'd never even put his tongue--
Steve was woken up by a pang of arousal that tugged low and deep in his gut. His Brooklyn drawl crept back out when he spoke. "Why don't you take a picture? It'll last longer." Then his eyes fluttered open to land on Tony who was watching him. A sleepy smile found its way on Steve's lips. He had actually used that line a hell of a lot in the forties. People would stare at him
Tony's face was largely expressionless; he just nodded.  "...Dad was... progressive for a guy born in his generation.  He liked omegas. He hired them, worked with them. But I don't think he saw them like people.  Jarvis was kind of like... a beloved dog, I guess. He did love him. Just not as an equal. ...maybe that's why our relationship was so piss-poor.  He saw me as a concept, too. And the problem with concepts are, they're perfect. And people... yeah, people aren't perfect."
He gave a small, experimental tug, wanting to get out of Steve.  Still too early.  He heard Steve give a small noise of pain and he buried himself back in quickly.  "Sorry."
Tony was shocked.  He wasn't even sure he'd said it, but...
She blinked. "Er, yep. Mr. Stark?"
Tony pulled his omega against him, smiling.  "Pretty awake, yeah," he purred, kissing the top of Steve's head.  "I would still appreciate a cup of coffee, though."  He propped himself up on one elbow, looking down at Steve.  The soldier was curled up against him sweetly.  There was something strangely dichotomous, almost perverse, about seeing an omega in such incredible shape, with a body so hard and toned.  The serum had made him look every bit an Alpha.  Not that you could always tell just by looking at someone, but the truth is, no one would look at a picture of Steve and possibly think he could be an omega.
Peggy. A fearless female Alpha in a sea of sexism and Alpha men. A woman who was worth ten of every man in there. Steve's chest ached to think of her. He'd been to visit a few times.  She was old, now. It was hard- seeing her like that. But he was still forever grateful he'd gotten the chance to see her at all.  Most of his other friends were dead.
"...it's all faked," he whispered to Steve as blood splattered everywhere.  "They dye corn syrup red... it's just special effects."  He made a mental note not to show Steve
Upstairs, Steve cooked them bacon and pancakes for breakfast, or rather late lunch. He knew Tony needed food and he certainly did. Steve made them both coffee, put it all on a tray and then headed down the steps to Tony's workshop.
He sighed. He reached down wordlessly and picked the Alpha up. Steve unlocked the door and put Tony in bed, tucking him in gently. He didn't know how to feel. He felt numb and humiliated. He should have known he'd just be another notch on the bedpost. Steve felt like an idiot. Sure, he wasn't expecting Tony to propose. But he also wasn't expecting him to immediately want to date other women and talk about it in front of him. He wasn't prepared to be an accessory in Tony's life, another Jarvis. It wasn't the forties. And maybe he was biased, but triad relationships always put omegas on the bottom (pun not intended).  He would never be first choice. And Steve didn't want his relationship to become a competition.
He let Tony take his hand when he reached for it, squeezing their fingers together gently.
"Oh, fuck you, Stark!"
"Take the rest of the night off, Jarv.  I'm done for now," said Tony, sounding exhausted.  He staggered over to the door, leaving the disassembled suit pieces and tools all over the shop floor, feeling wrung-out and ready to crash.  His earlier excitement at Steve being gone was replaced for a desperate need to hold and be held by his omega, who, thankfully, knew exactly how confusing and gritty and morally ambiguous war could be.
"Don't you have, like, servants...?"
Steve didn't know where he was walking to. The direction was automatic. He just felt foolish, lost in his own thoughts...he should have known that Yemen hadn't really changed anything and that Pepper would always come first. Jesus, he and Tony weren't even properly mated anymore...why was the Alpha clinging on when he clearly wanted someone else? Why did he even want Steve?  As a prize to spite his father? That was something he refused to be.
He got up and started pacing.  He was halfway across the aisle when he stopped, lifting his head.  He'd caught a whiff of something tantalizing.  He wasn't sure what.  It made his mouth water.  It was a comforting smell, but also musky, sexy.  Oddly familiar.  It was the smell of a juicy steak when he was hungry and the smell of his bed when he was tired.
"Yep . Anthony 'Rule-Breaker' Stark, that's me," said Tony, swaying a little.
-arms dealer."
"Are you kidding?  Without us giving them unwavering adoration, they would probably eat each other alive," said Lola, grinning.  "I don't know if you've noticed but this conference is a giant knot-fest."
"I... no. I think- it needs to be face to face."
"I really don't think you can throw the party in light of--" began Mackenzie.
Steve looked down and poked at his ribcage. It ached, but the pain was nothing like before. "Healing," he hummed and then ran a hand through his sleep-mussed hair. "What's up? Did we miss anything?" he asked.
He jumped at the sound of Karpov's voice and wheeled around, saluting automatically.  "A... wing?  Sir."
"...my God, did anyone else know she could do that?" asked Banksy in a hushed voice.
Steve sat there stock still, his throat going dry. "Still trying to figure that one out," he admitted. "Did Malick really buy Donner because he looked like me?" he asked, still alarmed by this. "Because the guy hates me... and... and what happened to Ashtray?"
"You got kids?"
"...you can't
!  I hate this!  I hate being a zero!  Why is everything so messed up?  Why can't I just
Tony was having a minor fit under Steve's arm.  "I'll kill him! I'll fucking kill him! You're mine!  I'll rip him to shreds!" Tony was shrieking in between growls and grunts of effort.  Steve was obviously trying not to hurt him, which was making pinning him difficult, because Tony was doing everything short of biting to get out from under Steve's arm.  Nonetheless, Tony was still pinned against the wall, like a butterfly to a board, and he was alternatively trying to get out and to grab the phone back. Being pinned beneath Steve's arm was like being under one of those metal bars on a roller coaster seat; it was solid and heavy and unmovable, but Tony's instincts had hijacked his reasoning skills and he was going berserk, even though, logically, he should have known he couldn't easily escape the weight of Steve's grip.  Not without a suit.
In fact, the only person who did was Rhodey.
"No, no, it's fine," said Tony quickly, checking the cloth in his hand.  "I think it's stopping. ...his was bleeding
"Hey, can I grab another scotch?"
"Steve!  ...are those waffles?  ...are those
Tony had to admit, he wasn't
"No, no, I'm great.  I'm fine," insisted Tony.  "It's just that... Dan, what the hell?  ...I didn't know you were into this shit."
"Watch me ramp off this building."
He stayed where he was, as far away from Bucky as possible and said nothing more. Steve wasn't sure who was standing in front of him right now; Bucky, the Winter Solider, or someone else entirely?
"Sure." She sounded a little hesitant. "What is it?"
Steve turned to his head to look up at Tony. "Did you really not know?" He asked softly. "That Alphas do that?"
Bucky stared down into the cup of yogurt.  He'd finally settled on peach. He had picked the fruit off the bottom and was now stirring it morosely.  They were outside the grocery store, sitting on a bench, enjoying the brisk spring day. Or at least, Wanda and Pietro were.  Bucky was clearly bothered.
"We know! You mention it like every day..." Kerry sighed.
"They did that 'cause he kept trying to run out," offered Vim, peeking in the doorway, still wrapped in her sheets.
"No," Steve told her, tone soft despite his words. "I don't."
"Yeah," Steve muttered. "I'm not."
smart," purred one of the Morgans.
He threw himself onto the nearest couch with a groan of misery.
His whole body was quivering with the anticipation.  He wanted to create the perfect environment around them and then fuck Steve stupid in said environment.
Tony looked up sharply.  He had lost track of time; he'd been flitting between his father's notes and the prototype for his newest suit.  Currently, he was listening to Van Halen and trying to unbolt a panel from what might someday be a compartment for anti-aircraft missiles or maybe a heat sink for a laser.  He wasn't sure yet; the current designs were still very much in the planning stages.
Steve laughed gently when Tony nosed against a ticklish spot and playfully pushed at his shoulder. "Hey, don't be mean," Steve complained in a grumble, his eyes a little glazed over still. He wasn't as gone as Tony but he was still far from sober.  "Where did...where did all our clothes go?"
And what the hell was this about
"Oh I'm sure they're fantastic. George is great."
"Tony, you act like you're dying.  Is this some sort of midlife crisis?"
But the soft music and the warmth of Steve's body was mollifying.  Tony leaned into him, closing his eyes, the two of them swaying idly.
...unlikely though.  Tony's stomach twisted a little.  Howard Stark had been extremely open about his feelings for Steve.  He loved Steve.  Not in the same way he loved Maria, no.  It was more like the love he felt toward Jarvis, a selfish, proprietary sort of love with a clear power dynamic.  Tony had heard him say, more than once when he'd been drinking, that he loved Steve, that Steve was one of the best and truly good things he'd made in his life, that he was proud of Steve and that Steve was too good for the world.  Tony had always silently raged against both Howard and Steve in those moments.  What was he, chopped liver?  Howard never told Tony he loved him or was especially proud of him, but he wasn't incapable of saying those words, because he was more than willing to say them about Steve.  Tony never understood why Howard withheld his affection for Tony but was so open about his fondness for Steve.
"How... sweet," Steve said, entirely unconvinced that that was the real reason...because they cared? Ha. No way.  More likely, they cared about how Steve's public persona affected SHIELD's public credibility.  Steve was used to being used as a mascot.
Steve's breath hitched a little when he saw him. It was unsettling to see Tony look...unsure of himself. He was supposed to be the confident one. Steve swallowed, his gaze flitting to the floor nervously. He rubbed his hands together. "I... I was upset and I walked out and I shouldn't have and I'm sorry. But I got him to Fury. He'll be safe with them, they're-- they're putting him into cryo." Steve couldn't hide how his voice broke a little. "Nothing happened. He hugged me. That was it." He didn't add that Tony would have probably felt it if Steve had had sex with Bucky. He knew what it felt like when your mate slept with someone else- it was the strangest feeling in the world.
She pulled the trigger.
"Holy shit," said Tony, who couldn't believe such rules had actually been written down.  Aria looked murderous.
"...Tony?" Steve whispered, failing to conceal the hope in his voice. "Is this you?"
"No.  No hmming."  Pepper walked around to Tony's side of the bed, and Steve saw she was carrying a stack of binders easily eight inches thick.  "I know this is probably a lousy time, but I need the two of you to sign a bunch of documents. Mostly debriefings for intelligence agencies for Yemen.  I drafted more than half of them myself. Luckily I'm also a notary public so we can just take care of this right now. Blue tabs are Tony's signature, green tabs are Tony's initials, red tabs are Steve's signature, yellow tabs are Steve's initials, purple tabs are items I'd like you to specifically review for yourself, and orange and pink are areas subject to revisions at a later date so please pay attention.  Orange was previously revised and pink is
"I thought we already established that?" Steve said, hiding his impatience poorly.
Fury swore.  "Which base was the target delivered to?"
there Tony. Just a remnant of it. I can't feel him right now- I can only feel
"Is... is it a good party?" he asked weakly.  Even if he was up here, freaking out under a bed, he wanted to make sure his reputation was intact.  Judging by the pounding music and screams of delight from below, everything was going well.
"In a teepee in the living room," said Sitwell derisively.  "He and Rogers cycle together."
"A lot of people did a lot of things. It was the forties. I was new and shiny," Steve said quietly, his gaze flitting up to Tony's face. It hurt to tell him. His memories of his father were fractured enough. He didn't want to taint them even further. But Tony asked and Steve was done with lying. He exhaled slowly. "...I didn't really think anything bad of it at the time. I didn't know any better."
"Just relax and I'll give you all the details, okay?" said Rumlow.  Steve kept swatting him off but he kept trying to stroke Steve's hair.  "Relax, Steven. We're going south, to Ventura. There's a base there. It's less than an hour north from your home in Malibu and Tony can come pick you up as soon as we get into contact with him, which I'm sure will be later today.  You'll be home before your full heat hits. We just want to make sure you're safe, that's all. Having you blind and mentally compromised in the middle of a Ralph's parking lot isn't a good look for Captain America." He threaded his fingers gently through Steve's hair.  "Do you want us to turn on the radio for you?"
"...do you want gum?" he ventured.
?" barked Sam; Natasha had already fired, but the bullet hit the wall.  Pietro was gone. So were the notes. The door was closing; Sam raced over to it to look down the hall, but there was no sign of the omega.
Tony tried to get up, but was yanked back.  Hard.
Steve hummed affirmatively. "I think Aria's got photos."
"...I missed you so much..." said Tony, and suddenly he realized he was feeling a hell of a lot more emotional than he'd previously expected.  That moment in Yemen when, briefly, he hadn't been able to feel Steve... when he'd thought he'd lost him...
Tony wouldn't admit it directly, but he'd spent a lot of his lonely Christmases binge-watching holiday specials while getting drunk.  In fact, last year, he'd ended up weeping at a Mormon Christmas special called "Mr. Kruger's Christmas." In his defense, he was three bottles of wine and a bottle of eggnog in at that point.
"Tony?  This is Natasha.  We just found Steve.  He's dead."
"...no, you can't come.  And yes, I'm very sure I'm not at a preschool.  Put Steve on, Tony."
"It's illegal to put locks on collars here, right?" Steve said, glancing over at the docent.
Tony set his chin on Steve's shoulder, his goatee tickling Steve's skin.  He often used Steve as a pillow while he was working. His handwriting was both messy and tiny, making the graph paper in front of him give the appearance of having been thrown up on by a calculator.  Tony's bow furrowed with its usual, faraway look of concentration, the one that meant he was deeply invested in whatever problem he was working on, the one Steve knew meant that nothing short of a bomb blast could tug him away from it.  He'd seen that look many, many times before.
Shit.  "Terminate learning algorithm six and re-calibrate your self-awareness, JARVIS.  I don't want you going sentient and trying to destroy the world."
Steve smiled.
Tony shoved past Pepper and Aria, sitting on the couch beside Steve, cuddling up to him.
He sighed fondly when he saw Tony pounce onto the bed and grabbed a towel. He walked over and tried to dry Tony off in the least sexual manner possible. Steve could tell the other was still enjoying it far too much though. "You... you lie down. I'll shower very quickly and don't you dare try and get in with me," Steve warned him, but his tone was light.
. Ha. Steve wished.
"Can I go to the doctor?" asked Cooper, not willing to let it go.
"Earlier morning," said DeSoto.  "They hang out in the hospitality suite all day.  It helps, you know, the Alphas aren't allowed to talk to them, but they let the omegas talk to them and then we can tell our Alphas if they're worth buy-- if they should bid.  You know, if they seem good and we get along and everything."
"Let us know when you get him home safe."
"I knew it, I knew this would happen if he went away to that school, I told you he was too young--"
"Couldn't have put it better myself," said Tony with a hint of sarcasm.
"Slow down."
Tony sat up and sniffed, then looked over at Steve with an exhausted grin.  "Was... was that it? It's over already?" He rubbed his eyes, then reached for his glasses on the bedside stand.  "That was easy. Only one assassination attempt, and most of the skin on my dick is still there." (He was half-joking.  The chafing was actually pretty bad. He couldn't remember where the balm Dr. Gleason had given him had gone. He'd have Pepper locate it for him later.)  "I'm starving. You wanna go get some breakfast?" he offered, slipping his hand into Steve's.
"I wanna come!" Tony whispered loudly to Steve when he caught his eye.  "We can take the chopper, please, wanna come, why can't I--"
Granted, they could have been anywhere and Tony would've said that.  Even if they weren't in a HYDRA base and about to be attacked, Tony still would have said it wasn't the time, because he didn't like talking about his emotions, and didn't think there ever really was "a time."  And he sure as hell didn't want to hear Steve talk about his feelings, either. When he and Steve were alone and Steve was calm, he was reassuring, sure. But in the heat of battle, Steve's emotions were more complex.  His statement earlier, about HYDRA taking those he loved... Tony knew who Steve was talking about.
the one whose smell is permanently changed?  Did they even tell him to bond you, Steve? Did they?  How do you know he's not faking to get you back? Huh?"  Tony didn't really care if Bucky was "sick" or not. A rabid dog was sick, but it got put down, right?  As far as Tony was concerned, even if Bucky hadn't been responsible for what happened to Steve, he was still dangerous and beyond saving.  Also, he suspected Steve was standing up for Bucky because they were bonded. Naturally, Steve would side with Bucky. Naturally, he would want to help him, to nurse him through a "sickness," because he was a good omega and that's what good omegas did.
Steve moved to sit on Tony's sofa. He could smell the alcohol in his coffee. He wondered if the bite mark had helped given Tony the confidence to do this, if 'fixing' the way Steve smelt meant he could more easily go all 'Alpha' on DeSoto.
"I can't," Steve said.
"Business as usual, sir?" asked JARVIS drily.
.. when I smell you... I want more than that.  I want to... to protect... I don't know.  I want, like
Tony folded his arms in and dove under an overpass, zigzagging through the concrete pylons.
"Is this about what happened on the plane between you and Stan?  I mean, Steve?  Is that it?  Oh,
They drove quietly for a while, no one saying anything. It was a peaceful quiet, not imposing. But soon Steve's thoughts forced their way out again.
Tony insisted they take a selfie before leaving.
"Don't do it again," repeated Tony.  "Run away like that." His voice was sterner than he meant it to be; he ran his fingers through Steve's hair, just to let him know he didn't mean it to sound so cruel, and then gave his head another encouraging little push.
just like 1944.
Steve sank down onto the bed and slowly undressed. Then, once down to his boxers, he helped Tony get out of his shirt. "Maybe we should spar sometime. I could teach you some new moves," he tried to joke before dropping back onto the mattress. Steve just wanted to sleep.
Tony, wide-eyed, slowly closed the front door.
Pepper wasn't here.  Happy wasn't, either.  But hey, who needed them when he had all of
While Tony was fiddling with his suit Steve had ended up drifting off. He was a super soldier who needed his sleep and he'd been working out for a good four hours. The plane moved slowly and rhythmically and lulled him into unconsciousness, his head leaning against one of the windows.
"Soldier!"  A familiar voice.  "Soldier!  ...Mother of Christ, what did he do to you?"
Noise.
"I wouldn't have brought you in here if you couldn't," Steve reassured him gently. When Tony appeared to be stepping in with his dressing gown on Steve stopped him with gentle hands on his arms and reached down to untie it for him, pushing the fabric away from his shoulders before they both stepped under the hot spray of water. It wasn't as hot as Steve was normally run it, but he knew Tony didn't like it when it was too hot.
needs you."
"--no," Steve finished quickly. "He didn't.  Just the bite."
"Speaking as an Alpha," said Natasha, "I don't want to dismiss Tony being pretty sympathetic about this.  But I also want to point out that his touching your neck... that's also instinctual. He wants to re-establish dominance.  I'm sure he always wants to make you feel better and let you know he still loves you. But you should know, there's probably a part of him, subconsciously, that's feeling extremely territorial about all this."
"A new element.  Badassium.  Named after yours truly.  Okay, see you at brunch, Larchmont Village, tomorrow at ten.  Ciao, Peppercorn!"
He let Tony pull away when he said good bye, their hands still together. Tony holding his hand was about the only thing stopping Steve from punching a wall. "We won't be able to afford to buy everyone at the auction," he murmured. "People here are stinking rich. But...but we could try and protect the youngest." Steve cringed when he realised those would also be the most expensive.
"Oh.  Yes. Well, I feel... I feel a little better," said Donner, taking a few steps forward.  Pepper and Tiberius blocked him, both glowering at Gideon, who looked not the slightest bit phased.
"100%," Steve told her dryly. "Tony doesn't want to buy anyone. He doesn't want to see anyone get
"What on earth does that mean?" she asked, sipping her wine.
She'd been wearing a blue dress.
Steve blinked in surprise, watching Ty go with a strange feeling in his chest. Huh. He felt giddy and strange. He was glad he could something back to Tiberius, he guessed...even if it was like this. Steve didn't still quite get why the man didn't try to date betas.  But it wasn't Steve's place to ask.
"Louder!"
Tony was moaning lustfully; he felt Steve's mouth on his neck and was vaguely aware of Steve making noises, mewls and cries of desire, maybe the occasional cry of his name, but  he was too focused on the physical sensations to really process or answer those noises; his knot was so swollen it was almost painful and even time he felt it slip back into Steve his hips jerked upward, involuntarily, seeking to fill up the omega, wanting to get more of himself inside him.  He'd never had his knot worked like this, never, and it was so good, so tight... Steve's body was moving on top of his fast and hard, desperately milking him, and Tony was lost in wave after wave of pleasure.
don't know. This is the day where everything goes to shit for you, do you understand? This is the day," Steve whispered, walking right up to her. "That you realise that everything you
"No.  I'm here to pick up Donnie," said Gideon.  He leaned to the side a little, to look over Tony's shoulder.  "Hello, Donnie."
"Oh.  Sure," said Steve.  He let them drag him to another floor of the building and plonk him into a makeup chair before he could protest, a woman had removed his scarf.
Bucky was feeling fairly confused, but generally optimistic.  Yes, Karpov was gone. He wasn't really sure where the hell he was, or why.  He'd lost his dog tags. He was having trouble making sense of how they'd gotten here or what they were supposed to be doing.
Steve heard Tony talking but he didn't really register it. As soon as Tony pressed that magical spot he was out of it. He was gone. Steve trembled a little, his lips parted... but he didn't manage to actually speak. The longer Tony pressed down the wetter he got between the legs and the more his dick began to thicken against his thigh.  It was like being in heat but instantaneously, all the more powerful because of how sudden it was.
been a fun one but Steve really didn't feel like he ought to make a habit of it.  Aria would kill him.
Tony felt a pang in his chest.  Not a lot of people offered that.  Stane was seen, at the end, as a dangerous madman.  To Tony, he'd been the guy who taught him piano. He'd almost forgotten that Boswell had interviewed him, too.  "...thanks," he said. He decided to change the subject. "Thirty years, you've been with Banksy?"
"--it's okay," Tony said quickly.
Tony growled.
to see him again.
Tony hadn't realized how much he was drinking.  And... it wasn't doing a damn thing.  He was getting sicker.  The veins on his chest were creeping up to his neck, ugly red-purple bruises and streaks appearing, hot and painful, under his skin.  He shoved his concerns aside.  He would be fine, probably.  He just needed to swap out the core.  Then he'd be fine.
"It's so stupid," said Tony.
"I can't believe she actually said the word clientele! It's like they're not even putting on a face anymore," Ian said, laughing quietly in despair. He shook his head. "I wonder how these 'clientele' choose from the omegas. Maybe they hold meetings, or events--"
Tony stroked Steve's abs longingly, his breath catching at Steve's words.  "...would you?" he asked, also in a whisper.  Why were they whispering?  It felt right, somehow.  "...what if I asked right now?  Right this instant?  Would you then?" he asked, softly.  He wanted to believe it, wanted to so badly.  Steve on the floor, Steve on his knees, Steve gazing up at him, his face against his thigh... Tony craved to go back to that position so badly.  He'd never felt anything like that in his whole life; it felt natural, perfect... Tony had to believe that that feeling had been mutual.
He didn't really want to think about it right now, though.  He was
"I think so," Happy hummed.
Pepper frowned at Tony.  "Tony, put some pants on."
Tony waited until he had slipped past them and padded away silently down the hall before he looked at Steve.  "Even if you convince him, he'll never be able to say no to Gideon if he shows up. That guy has zero backbone."
is what Project Guiding Star could have accomplished, if they weren't so damned obsessed with making super soldiers instead."
"How romantic," said Tony dryly, looking over the roses.  "Question. When Clint's in heat--"
He stared at the graves, hands clasped behind his back, unmoving.

"I'll call him when we get home. Come on," Steve curled an arm around Tony's shoulders as they walked out.
but it can take longer... six, eight months, even."  He took Steve's hand.  "...so we'll have to get Mark the lawyers and the money personally, if he's already three months along.  Is what I'm saying," he finished.  The only thing Tony hated more than getting involved in personal affairs was doing nothing.  He intended to get the kid help, anonymously, and leave it at that.
He was inside one of the canvas tents, looking sheepish as people squeezed his biceps and cooed over him.
"So ready, Nat. You have no idea. I
It was all very well for him and Natasha and Sam to go in.  He was already forty and didn't have a family. Natasha, a female Alpha bonded to a male omega, couldn't have kids.  Sam, like Tony, appeared middle-aged and without any ties. But Steve was still young, technically. He could still start a career or a family, go to college... there were a million things Steve hadn't yet done or experienced.... he'd never even heard Lynyrd Skynyrd (to Tony's knowledge) or gotten a blowjob, and here he was, looking giddy with excitement, like they were going skydiving or something instead of going into a fucking battlefield.
"No... I don't think so.  They just give them away to someone else."
women.
Which is how one day in mid-October they ended up in a high-rise in Queens, New York, where John Jameson greeted them in his usual manner.  "STEVE! TONY! GREAT TO SEE YOU AGAIN!" he shouted. He was smoking a cigar; Tony coughed.
"Roger that."
He tilted Steve's head back and began trickling water over his head and down his back, his expression one of intense concentration.  He'd never cared for another person before and he tackled it with the sort of intensity he usually reserved for electronic problems.
A headache stabbed suddenly behind his eyes and he squeezed them shut.  In retrospect, staring at the sun wasn't the smartest thing to--
on time.  Aria ushered them into the studio, looking more focused now they'd arrived.
"It's okay. The Stark jet has amazing autopilot and don't worry, I can ask JARVIS to forget the coordinates once I land. Promise," Steve said. "I got it. Anything else I should know?"
Steve frowned at being told off. "I'm sorry I'm not really at my best right now." Logically, yes. He did know that.  But right now he was in heat and couldn't make the make mental jump between stopping Tony  from being too hands on, and not touching his hands. The first option had been the priority.  Besides, Tony hadn't reacted, initially.
Rhodes gave a grow of frustration and tipped the couch over, depositing Tony on the floor.  Tony sat up indignantly.  "Get out!" he snapped.
"Make it an even dozen," said the scientist with the bag, adjusting the shoulder strap.  "Better safe than sorry."
"Who the hell is Trickshot?  ...and how come all these omegas have such dumb names?  ...no offense, Hal."
"Pep, we're in the middle of our honeymoon.  I've been through worse.  I wanna go home," said Tony stubbornly as he limped down the steps from the plane and onto the tarmac.  California was wonderfully warm and sunny; he squinted happily in the light.  "Hold my calls, will you?"
"Karaoke is the best goddamn thing in the world," said Tony.  He gave Steve a quick peck on the lips and untangled their hands, then gave Steve a friendly slap on the ass.  "C'mon, Sam.  First round's on me.  I got this splitting headache and I thought I was going to throw up but..."
"He's
Tiberius smiled sadly.  "I know what it's like to have an unpalatable neck, believe me.  Just mate him without biting him, Tony. Take him from the front, look into his eyes.  Relax. Steve chose you. The gland doesn't have a brain. Just ignore it."
Steve reached out and touched Tony's hand before he pulled it away. It took him a moment but he sat up and then he turned to face Tony and reached out to touch his cheek, the backs of his fingers just lightly grazing against it. "Don't ever compare yourself to that man," he breathed, voice low. "You might have been indifferent before, Tony, but you're trying to best. And I'm so proud of you. The difference between you and Malick is that when you realized Omegas were people too, you felt bad about it, where as isn't capable of
Sure enough, they were headed down into a second, smaller lobby; a man at a desk was chatting amiably to another man; the man and girl fell into place behind him.  The man in front of them was wearing a suit; the girl (Tony couldn't bring himself to think of her as a woman; she looked like a high school kid) was in a denim skirt and a t-shirt, looking like she ought to be hanging out at the mall.  She had strawberry-blonde hair that hung down to her shoulders and Tony imagined she looked a bit like Pepper might have at that age. On her neck was a dainty rose-gold chain collar with what looked like emeralds.
"...name?" she asked, even though she obviously knew who they were.
Donner shrugged a little.
, and not being able to remember how he'd gotten here was terrifying him.
"You also don't wanna go into heat whilst he's going into labour," Aria pointed out bemusedly from where she'd started munching on the grapes they'd brought. "Everything okay, you two? You look... weird."
"You know the DoD is ready to call in an airstrike if necessary?"
"Just lemme know when you, ah, want me again," he said, voice distorted within the helmet.  "Cause if you change your mind, I, uh, I'd like dinner."  He turned with a whirling of gears, opened Steve's window (breaking it), and climbed out heavily.  "Bill me!" he yelled before dropping.
Downstairs, a few minutes later, they could hear banging. Sitwell oh-so-subtly flicked the radio on and turned the volume up. Pepper sent him a grateful look. Then he was pulling a hand gun out of his pocket and pointing it at the doorway. An omega in a plaid shirt and a wooden jumper, who looked utterly harmless, put his hands up.
"Tony?" His tone was cautious as he stepped in front of his boss. "Tony? Are you...are you okay?"
He lunged.
Dani stared at Steve with almost narrowed eyes. Could she tell him and Tony were together? Tony's scent must have been all over him, but she was a beta, so she couldn't smell that, right? Charlie was obviously far too indifferent to comment on it- Steve had always liked her. She was a grounded and realistic person in the midst of all this money and power. She cared more about the new episode of
This was going to be a long night.
"I get I can't understand your Alpha problems properly. Just like you can't understand all of mine...but even if I don't understand, I can still listen, you know? Sometimes it just helps to say things out loud. Just because I can't fix your problems doesn't mean you have to be alone with them," Steve said quietly, his blue eyes remaining fixed back onTony's face.
"Sorry.  I'm in love," said Tony with a broad grin, letting her go.  "Where's Coulson?"
"Great minds think alike," joked Dr. Brazinski, and both laughed lightly.
Steve's scent was intoxicatingly familiar.  It made Tony sleepy. "...so today's Banksy's birthday, huh?  That's kinda cool," he said drowsily. "Y'know my birthday's at the end of the month but... I don't really care that much about throwing a party this year... let's just duck our early for our anniversary.  I figured England would be nice. We could go see Aunt Peggy." The words were out of his mouth before he'd even realized it. Shit. He cleared his throat a little, then grudgingly explained, "She's my, um, godmother."
When Tony crooked his fingers inside of him Steve saw stars and he came moments later. He moaned loudly as he came undone in Tony's mouth, his fingers leaving fresh dents in the table. "Ah..." He slumped against the bench, his legs shaking a little as they really did threaten to give way.
Greene!"
"Oh, like how I'm being
He woke up with a face pressed into snow. Steve was shivering, his eyes glassy. He tried to stand. "F-fuck..."
"We want to able to mourn our dead, and avenge them, on our own terms," said T'Chaka calmly.  "I find your desires sympathetic and understandable. But we do not have any need for Iron Man, or Captain America.  Wakanda has her own defenders."
The way Tony undressed him and looked over him and explored him with every touch...it made Steve feel precious. It almost made him feel breakable, in a way. Something he hadn't felt in a very long time. The drag of those dark eyes and engineer's hands over his body made him shiver and squirm under the scrutiny - though it was very,
"...people like to talk.  I'm kinda used to it," Tony added with a purposeful nonchalance.  He looked away, still holding Steve's hands.  "I mean.  Yeah.  Our relationship is... weird.  You don't have to worry.  Mostly, people think I'm the asshole and you're just, you know... a poor smitten omega.  That's maybe the one benefit you get from being an omega.  Even people who don't like our bond still like
was what SHIELD was worried about.  Whether Steve liked it or not, he was a weapon, and a dangerous one.  And his nickname, Captain
A shoulder flare went off and burst next to Tony's right ear, leaving it with a loud, insistent ringing that drowned out all other sounds.
"Oh my God. I love you," said Steve, laughing and accepting the coffee.
It was a unique experience to Tony, to put this level of trust in anyone.  Aside from Pepper and Rhodey, he lacked that with just about everything else in his life.  Perhaps even only with Pepper, who was (un?)fortunate enough to see him drunk very often.
guy from the WSC, Alexander Pierce, who called the meetings in the first place?  I'm worried Steve. Really worried and--"
From Clint:
One man was swiveling idly in a chair, tapping a pencil against his lips.  "To be fair," he said, "if the Winter Soldier were as good as Captain America, we wouldn't need Captain America."
He got goosebumps from the praise.  Karpov rarely ever praised him. He lay there, holding the blond down.  Once Karpov and the witch came, they could bundle him up and take him back to base and that would be that.  There was probably a half-pack of cigarettes for it in him, too.
The director turned and walked away; the scientist stayed for another several minutes, taking notes.
"But what if he was? What if he shacked up with some women for a few days? Could you forgive that? Would you stay?"
with me?"
DeSoto was still smiling; Tony edged away, hating both of them.
"I'm not sure if it counts if you tell him to say yes," said David.
to you? Wanda! Wanda! Help!"
?" asked one woman.
"He needs to make his own opinion of you," Banksy waved a hand. "Just give it time. But I do agree, making sure he doesn't go back to Malick is very important."
And more than a bit angry.  Steve had jumped to sterilization without even consulting him.  Tony had wanted that, earlier, and Steve had fucking vetoed it... oh, but if it was for
He remembered the pamphlet Gleason had given him.  He frowned. The group met Saturday.
Steve ignore him, nuzzling into his head.  When he told Tony he was good person, Tony's heart seized a little in his chest.  He wanted to refuse it, to deny it, but he didn't have the chance; there was a knock on the door.
"Yes.  Yes, they are," agreed Pepper, flipping a page for Steve to keep signing.
How was the media going to cover this?  Their announcement was supposed to be joyous but it would no doubt be completely overshadowed by the attack.  Steve was so wholesome, so noble; Tony felt terrible for dragging him into this.  Tony was used to be shit on by publications, especially liberal ones.  He was aware that as an ex-weapons designer and tech mogul and part of the "1%," he was an easy target.  But Steve didn't deserve that.  Now that they were bonded. Their actions spoke not only for themselves, but for each other.
"You trusted me with James."
"No, please, Aunt Peggy--"
Aria and Pepper disappeared together once they had passed Tony and Steve off to the hairdressers.  Outside, Aria stood leaning against a box with a cigarette loosely held between two fingers. The boys were the studio's problem now until they went live in forty minutes. "Has he always been like this?"
this."
"You're right.  Rogers, you any good with the metro?  Can you get on a train and disappear if we hold them off?  Create a choke point?" asked Fury.  His eye never left the road; they were coming within inches of hitting other motorists, and being greeted with a lot of angry honks, but slowing down would only mean that the black vehicle behind them would catch up, and you didn't have to be a genius to know that it was not filled with any well-wishers.
But if Steve took his corners a
Dr. Gleason looked up at Steve.  "It does feel dilated.  You're going to probably be spotting and have some nausea for a few days, along with some cramps.  If you need anything for the pain, I can write you a script.  But you'll be fine.  Are your heats cycling regularly?  Taking any suppressants or anything like that?"
There was the noise of a door opening; Tony looked over lazily.  Pepper was peeking out. "Steve, Gideon Malick wants to meet with you this evening."
"And there's no need. I know you would do the same for me," Sam said. Steve couldn't argue with that. "Are you and Tony better now?"
The imperative was so strong and so sudden it was like the Voice of God.  (Not that Tony believed in that stuff.)
"No more drinks.  Period."
"The gym."
Seeing  as HYDRA had heat-inducing technology it had seemed best to leave the omegas back. But now Steve was apparently in heat with Bucky with him... considering both Natasha and Sam were Alphas too, things could get messy.
"You know I'm not your PA anymore, right?"
Maria had no idea what he was referencing but remained silent.
Sometimes she just knew exactly what to say.
The baby was like magic. The mood shifted immediately, from one of impatience and pain to something like relief. But it was more than just that. "Tony. Tony, let me--" With some persuasion, Tony let Steve stand up so he could walk over to the bedside properly and see Granite close up.
Below him, Steve's body was still breathing, in and out, rhythmically.  Hypnotically.  Tony could have fallen asleep on him, but he was too stressed out to sleep.  He might never sleep again.  Every time he started to relax he remembered the smell of Steve's blood and the dander on his neck went up all over again.
"What do you mean, it's
"I know I need to stop going off and doing shit by myself," Steve whispered. "I think it's... just self-destructive.  I do it because that's how I've always done it.  But I know I need to stop."
"An RC Cola-ectomy?" repeated Tony, confused.
have feelings for Steve.  But that was impossible.  Steve was an omega.  Tony didn't really run with omegas.  He felt it was sort of pathetic and old-fashioned, Alphas and omegas, pair-bonding.  He'd once told Pepper that and she'd laughed.
Tony stared at the forest of orchids, thinking about the lone white orchid in his father's study that he'd never questioned.
"You're Captain America.  You're a badass, Steve.  Maybe even more than I am.  We're unstoppable, okay?  You wanna go home now, we can do that.  You wanna go in there and rub shoulders with Irshad from the WORC and Ellis, talk about safe spaces-- ironic, by the way, considering-- I'll be behind you every step of the way.  You're in charge here.  I'm with you now.  We're together and we got this, right?"
Donner slowly peeled away the last bits of paper from the water bottle.  "...where would you take me?" he asked in a low voice after a moment.
"Tie!" yelled Pepper after them.  "Tie and
Coulson looked up from the couch.  "Morning. I made coffee," he greeted Steve.  "Natasha just e-mailed me. She and Clint were delayed but said they'll be in for the party tomorrow, no later than six.  ...did Tony have another late night?"
"Come here," he murmured, pulling Steve against him, into his lap.  Steve moved with him fluidly, responding to every little touch, eager to please, eager to obey.  Tony made sure Steve was settled against him before reaching down, wrapping one hand around his length, groping Steve's entrance with the other.  Steve was wet; Tony gently worked two fingers into him, feeling his body twitching around his digits.  "...good boy..." he whispered into Steve's ear.  This felt... right.
Were those thoughts
Dr. Brennan frowned.
The rest of the day passed in a blur. Aria and Pepper spent most of it on the phone yelling at various people while the rest of them milled about with the odd job.  (Tony's was to "not touch anything" and "put the whiskey away," something Pepper emphasized every thirty minutes.) Steve mostly drew, filling up his walls and also putting a lock on he door so he could keep the room safe during the party; he didn't want drunk people to wander in and spill drinks in his studio. The drawings were precious to him. Clear memories of his and Tony's first months together, and his past life, from before the ice.
It was...strange. He could feel Tony's presence- like, really
"Okay..." said Tony, trying to relax into the couch.  "...I feel... lemme think... I feel... definitely hungry."
Clint grinned at Steve.  "...I don't mind the vacation.  Oh, this is Cooper."
And then what?  Did he just... release them into the wild or something?  What if he ended up with a dozen teenage omegas?
"Oh, and welcome back, Captain," he added as they wheeled Steve off the jet.  It was a cool, brisk day. Late February, partially cloudy. California was as stubbornly pleasant as ever; it was probably in the sixties.  "I'll have a chat with
But, Tony reminded himself, he was also a liar and a backstabber and a former friend of his father's.
"Okay.  I have your trip to England booked, it's May 27th to June 6th, so you'll be leaving in sixteen days, on Thursday, and coming back the Monday following... Tony?  President Ellis is inexplicably giving you a medal for bravery at the Expo--"
"It's what you pay me for," she shrugged. "Now get in there before the rest of your noodles go cold." Aria smiled  lightly and punched his arm with no real force behind it.
One of the failures of television was that scents couldn't be communicated.  On the surface everything was going great. But Tony could still sense a bit of tension between him and Steve.  And Danielle was radiating a certain kind of defensiveness that Tony didn't understand. He had heard of Status Alliance but knew no more about it than he did anything about, say, the Society for Creative Anachronism.
"If we went to do an interview together..." Steve murmured into the quiet. "What do you think it will be like?  Sooner or later people will want to hear from us."
Tony rolled his eyes at the Mr. Recommended-Bedrest jab... sometimes, Steve was as bad as Pepper.
Steve wasn't sure what to do with his hands; the photographers hollered out suggestions.  Some made sense to him ("Now drag your fingers through the paint!") and others, not so much ("Now give me some bedroom eyes!")  Mostly, he just tried to not look awkward or to second-guess letting them paint a flag on his stomach.
"He probably always will.  But Steve's good for him," said Pepper.  "...this is literally the longest relationship he's ever been in."
Natasha called Dr. Gleason ahead of time to be at their house so he could patch up Steve's neck. They needed someone to check over both Steve and Tony and it certainly couldn't be either her or Sam right now.  Gleason sounded quite alarmed when Natasha told him Steve had had an included heat in a fight and a bad bite mark that needed tending to; getting an early-morning call of that sort probably would have alarmed any doctor.
Bucky's stomach turned.
Tony remembered, with a pit in his stomach, how Boswell had described it.
But he managed to get through the meeting with Gene relatively easily.  There was only one moment where Rhodey panicked slightly; Tony's name came up during a casual conversation about the AU conference.
The museum staff was grinning as Tony and Steve entered; the museum had refused to close itself down for just them (much to Tony's dismay) so there were other patrons milling around, but not many.  Steve didn't really
and then
"Yes. What's going on, Steve? Are you okay?  What was that noise?"
Tony grinned as Steve stayed his hand.
"You mean... Donner?"
He reached out and groped for Steve's hand.  "I don't wanna do this anymore, Steve, c'mon... my childhood ended a long time ago.  I don't wanna go back.  This isn't helpful at all.  Fury must've hit his head, there's no reason for this film to even be in my dad's files at all, it's not like there's anything useful in here, nothing scientific.  This is just, you know, a promo for the Expo.  Dad shot promos all the time."
"--land the plane, I wanna get out, I'm serious, let's go crazy, let's go to Paris, let's go to Oslo, I just... I need a break, come on, Pepper, you and me, it'll be a blast," insisted Tony, looking a little more wild than usual.
Pepper winced.  "...sort of. He threw up earlier."
Pepper gave her head a shake of uncertainty.  "He's bonded to Tony. The guy's a walking disaster.  And I say that as his best friend. The two of them were fighting earlier but... now..."
A glass of wine in his hand, Tony stood in front of the fire with a tablet, pulling up the story.  The living room was dark except for the fireplace. The fire cast long shadows. The orchids stood silently; everyone looked happy, curled onto the couch.  Tony, always a showboat, insisted on standing in front of them to read the story, but he'd been drinking through dinner and parts of it were a bit slurred.
"Dilation," said the doctor from between Steve's legs.  He was two fingers deep inside him.  "Sometimes, the cervix dilates when there's been a miscarriage."
"Oh... it's sort of lovely, isn't it?" she said.
"He's in shock," reported the nurse into the phone.
"Are you guys trying?"
"Hey, Steve... congrats," said Tony weakly.
Pepper looked alarmed, but Rhodey felt that hard love was probably the only thing that would work at this point.  Steve looked lost, anxious.  Not as bad as Tony, but certainly not well.
"...I'm not letting anyone carry me.  It'll only churn up the rumor mill.  It's better that everyone sees us walk out together," said Tony stubbornly.  He'd already pulled out his phone to text Happy, Pepper, and Charlie.  One of the benefits of being filthy rich was that he could go anywhere he wanted at the drop of a hat.  And currently, he wanted to go back to California, far away from New York and, more specifically, far away from this stupid hospital.  His foot didn't even hurt that much!  He was pretty sure that, with a few shots of scotch, he'd be able to walk on it without the slightest hint of a limp.  This was one of the ways he kept Pepper from protesting suit tests too much; he took a few drinks every time he accidentally smashed into a wall.  Alcohol was a perfect pain killer and his tolerance was high enough that he could keep working even after a couple of shots.
don't care about winning doesn't mean I don't either," she snapped, pacing around the table, checking all the different possibilities.
Steve cried out, almost in relief, as Tony began driving into him properly. It even made the bed shake a little and Steve's thighs quivered again as they were spread wider with each thrust.
Time to change the conversation.
"Seriously, I barely even notice it anymore."
Steve suggested that he bite his shoulder, but... it wasn't the same.  There was something so intimate about biting Steve's neck. It was like Steve had suggested Tony jerk off his arm instead of his dick.  What was the point?
"Is this good enough?  Now can we mate?" he asked desperately, eagerly.  "I got you out of there and there's no cameras in this room.  Is this good enough? Have I completed my objective now?"
"And what about now?"
auctions aren't for people like you, Mr. Stark."
"Is he driving?" asked a woman next to Steve with undisguised curiosity.
Steve leaned down and nipped at Tony's jaw softly, an intimate gesture. "Is it...is it weird if kinda like your age?" he asked in a murmur. "That you're...you know." He blushed a little. "Experienced."
. On their stupid, goofy relationship working out."
He let out a small, eager whine and his eyes met Steve's, briefly, before Steve looked away.
"Yeah," he said, trying to sound sexy but repressing a laugh only just. "I want that."
Tony stared at her for a moment.  "...are you done with that vodka?" he asked finally, reaching for the bottle her hand was on.
About an hour must have passed. Bucky still hadn't moved. Steve was getting worried. The 'lunch break' would be over. How long would it take them to make an inducer that would work on him? Days? Weeks? ....hours? Steve shivered and peered over to see the same blank reflection of Bucky's face in the glass.
"Oh, he's gonna be fun to work with, I can tell," said Sam, giving Steve a look.
As usual, he was well aware that Steve was big and strong enough to push him off, but some emotional or psychological barrier prevented him from doing so, and Tony felt strong as he pushed Steve down and crawled on top of him.  He ran his lips over Steve's jaw, recently shaved, soft and smooth; one of his hands reached up to cup Steve's cheek, and Steve's head turned automatically into the touch; Tony pressed his nose into the junction of his jaw and ear, his tongue flicking out to taste Steve's skin.  He could feel Steve's body quivering under him, vibrant, longing; Steve's smells were nothing but pleasant, eager, willing, accepting.  Tony couldn't quite describe Steve's flavor, only that it screamed comfort to him; it was the smell of his sheets when he came back from a long, hard business trip and he was exhausted and the promise of sleeping in was imminent; it was the smell of Christmas morning when he was eight years old and Jarvis woke him up and he ran into the front room and, inexplicably, Howard was there, even though everyone had warned him that his father was probably still going to be in Tokyo and he shouldn't get his hopes up much; it was the smell of Pepper's hair when she had just washed it and she was bending over an earnings report with high numbers, her breasts just barely concealed by her blouse, her green eyes sharp, intense, talking numbers to him, a recently sharpened pencil scratching over the page in front of him, the sun rising at his back from the thirty-second floor of their Manhattan office, a fresh cup of coffee within arm's reach.  It brought back a million memories that Tony didn't even know he had but every one of them was a perfect moment, perfect and peaceful and intensely nostalgic, and every one of them missing this one thing, his omega; Steve was the missing puzzle piece to a perfect life.
Steve didn't fully understand what was happening; they were watching the TV screens backstage; Justin, in his orange suit, was addressing the crowd, a line of armored suits like Tony's behind him.  Tony's reaction told him about everything he needed to know; Tony's face had blanched white.
"We left him there," Natasha said, helping Clint stand. "We had to get out, Steve."
But the choice had been made and here they were.
"Ugh," said Pepper.
Tony?"
parents wanted an Alpha.  So I got the
"...thank you, Tony," said Tiberius quietly.  "I appreciate that. ...you know what they say, charity starts at home.  You want to treat omegas well?" He nodded to Steve. "Start with this one."
Howard Stark's death was an assassination made to look like an accident, but that was known only to a select few.  The local police had closed it long ago; only in the deepest depths of SHIELD's archives was there any documentation on it.  Steve doubted even Natasha knew.  The investigation had remained untouched but had never been closed because no assassin had ever claimed credit for it.  Could it have been the Winter Soldier?
"You can't possibly be this emotionally constipated."
Steve tried to get Tony to look after himself better, sure. He made him wear that cute little Santa waistcoat. But he didn't really ask for things, did he? He never made demands or enforced them.  Tony did whatever he wanted.  And Steve let him because he didn't believe in forcing another person to do something they didn't want to.
"Have you met China Bacardi yet?" shouted Jameson, leading them through the lobby.  One of the nice things about being part of Jameson's little group was that everyone else was giving them a wide berth.  "Direct descendant of the Bacardi founder! They're one of our sponsors! I don't drink myself because of an ulcer! I blame work!  You're a businessman yourself so you know how damned stressful it is!"
"Yes," said Ji-Yoo, her face flushed, giggling; Tony and Trey's brother were fighting over a pair of shakers, arguing about how to make a Sidecar.
Tony couldn't stop checking his phone.  He had hoped he'd meet Steve here, but Steve was a no-show.
At least his mark was still partially visible; at least he still had some small claim to Steve.  Bucky's mark was bigger and deeper but Tony's was still there, at least.
"Okay.  Okay, let's... hash this out," said Tony slowly.  "I have Jack.  You have Steve.  Hammer has... a bird, apparently.  Let's just agree to get the omegas, civilians, and birds somewhere safe, and then settle this like men.  Okay?  Deal?"
"Maybe it's time to take them home," Steve murmured and Sam stood too.
He sat up to clutch his hand, eyes watering against the stabs of agony traveling up his arm.  "Fuck... oh, fuck... I'm fine, don't..." Steve's face was shining with concern and he was at Tony's side, clearly bent on helping him.  Tony got up unsteadily on his own. "...I'm fine... shit... well, that was a wake-up call... can you help me with shaving and stuff?" he asked plaintively, still clinging to his right hand.  "...by 'and stuff,' I mean jacking off, obviously... I'm kidding, I use my left hand for that... still, you can help." He forced a cheeky grin. He could tell Steve wasn't fooled.
space and he felt calmest there.
Right. Tony was mad at him. He didn't like him. He didn't want him. Steve had betrayed his trust. All that screwed up stuff.
No, none of that mattered now.  The world had shrunk to Steve, who Tony could tell was aroused; he's kneed apart Steve's legs but it was useless motion and he felt trapped in the goddamn armor; he was seriously considering trying to just tear it off himself, but he didn't want to let go of Steve's wrists or neck...
Tony was already walking away.
"That's
?  Why are you being so
But he needed to reassure him. "Please, Alpha," he said, voice seductively soft. "Tell me what to do, how to be good for you."
Back in the army, in the SSR, Steve and Peggy had both been outcasts.  He was an omega, and she a woman, and they'd had to be strong, have a constant wall of professional up.  They were always on guard. They did not talk about men or Alphas or children or mating or marriage, ever.  Things had changed, for the better.
"It's fine, we'll handle it," said Pepper.
Steve woke up as the helicopter landed in Tony's front yard. He felt dizzy and a little sick but he was no longer in any sort of heat. He was in the aftermath. His neck burned with a dull sort of pain, and his insides felt sore, as did the dart wound on his leg. Natasha, not smelling any danger, stepped into the door way just as Steve looked up.
"...what,
Once the suit was assembled around him and his digital display was lit up, Tony clanked his way out of the garage.  "How're we doing Jarv?" he called as he left the garage and made his way toward the back of the house.
Steve shivered as Tony's fingers danced down lower. And then his Alpha's breath was trembling and steamy against his neck and Steve felt himself responding in every way, blue eyes darkening as he shifted against Tony a little. He hadn't known before mating it was possible to be this horny- and yes, the serum made that crazier too.
"--I'm trying to negotiate with SHIELD about getting you a temporary pass to Switerzland, but worst case scenario, there's a secretariat in North Carolina where we can carry on with the proceedings."
Steve turned around to see Tony fiddling with wires. He let out one short breath as he set the shield prototype down on the desk. That was all the exertion it had taken. To take down a goddamn wall. He could see the focus on Tony's eyes, he recognised it. He could do this. Hope seized in Steve's chest.
"I didn't follow any of that," said Clint.
"He's out."
Outside, Tony and Steve were cuddled up on a lounge chair by the pool.  Tony looked down at Steve.  In order to be held, Steve had to curl up a little, and Tony had to stretch, but they managed.  Steve's eyes were on the barely-visible outline of Tony's arc reactor. Tony's gaze followed his.
"Look, all I've seen it do is kill a load of people--" Steve sighed and then paused. "I guess, there was a point in the fight..." He hesitated. "This is gonna sound ridiculous. But it hit a wall and the energy kind of, spread over it? And I could have sworn for a second, I saw a part of outer space."
Alpha, Captain?  He's still alive, isn't he?  What's the nature of your current relationship with him, given his age and Stark's previous reaction to discovering you two were still bonded?"
"...that's
"Anthony Edward Stark, you'd better have a really good reason to cancel on five of your six appointments today.  Do you have any idea how difficult it was to arrange for all of the private showcasings in
"She let herself in," Aria supplied, in other words. "You okay there, Steve?"
Someone above him patted his shoulder sympathetically.  "Don't worry, we'll leave that in.  I'm just disconnecting some electrodes.  The simulation is over.  I know, it's a little disorienting when you first wake up."
"I think maybe you have PTSD. Okay, so I know you shouldn't Google stuff-- according to WebMD, you apparently have five types of cancer--" She shrugged. "Whatever. But all this reckless self-destructive shit, self-esteem, self-sabotage. It's
"Shit!  ...you know, my house used to be a private place!" he snapped.
.  He felt weird, denying Steve.  Steve had looked so excited, so happy and eager.  But Tony's hurt was so fresh and he realized, with horror, he couldn't trust Steve.
"...yeah.  I'm in."
He'd halted weapons production at his company three years ago and still, weapons kept cropping up like bad pennies.  The entire Delegate line, the Ambassador IV, the late-model Contenders... even a few Jericho rip-offs.
your outside exploits," Steve pointed out. He was still holding the door open.
But then, Tony found himself worrying about the kinds of relationship questions they would ask.  Tony's dating life was one that the media doted on; there was always a new girl and she was usually famous and pretty and Tony had had several blow-up break-ups, which the tabloids lapped up with glee.  Tony was worried his famed promiscuity would come up.  Especially in Hollywood, trios were still fairly common; you might see an Alpha and their partner on the red carpet, trailed by an omega. Sometimes, there would be two Alphas, coupled, trailed by two omegas. Becoming bonded was something lots of celebrities did, and after the initial media frenzy, that omega would usually fade into the background, loyally trailing their Alpha as they found other partners, other Alphas or beta, and maybe even got married.  But Steve wasn't one of those omegas and he'd made his expectations clear to Tony.
He was too tired to be distressed anymore. Steve just felt sad, if anything.
"Objectives... this isn't about objectives. This is... this is about choosing a side."
"How far does this thing limit me?" Steve asked, poking the box. They all knew he could crush it in a matter of seconds if he wanted to. But he wouldn't. "Can I leave the state?"
"I'm turning on a machine.  It'll go zap and then create a material that will help me not die," said Tony.  "Much like how a coffee machine would."
pregnant right?"
There was no bite in his words.  Tony's brain was running at full capacity to try to figure things out.  This wasn't rocket science, and that was the problem. Tony
Tony chanted inside his head.  He refused to let himself get swept up in emotion.  But he also didn't move his hands.  He held Steve's cheek; Steve held his other hand; they were perfectly frozen in time.  It was that moment in the basement, all over again.  But this time, no Clint to break them apart.  No Phil to get a phone call from New Mexico.  No Natasha to smirk and tease and make Tony feel defensive.
"No."
"We, er, can't stop them walking out the door, sir," the man explained awkwardly. "They're people. They're allowed to walk where they want."
Steve's hand itched into take Tony's into his in the car, to interlink their fingers together; but he wasn't sure the other would appreciate it. He let his hand sit between them in the seat, a silent offering, but not pushing for anything.
"-discuss the future of the company. I can't handle this anymore, I just can't . It's too much-”
He and Tony were both rolling around outside, throwing drunken punches and clawing at each other's clothes and hair.  A small group was watching and filming it on their phones, giggling. The two were rolling around dangerously close to the edge of the pool; sure enough, they suddenly fell in, and yanked apart, sputtering.
"...I don't know if this helps, but Tony's here," said Clint quietly while Phil poked around Steve's mouth.  "He came with us. He's the one who carried you out."
Karpov bristled.  "There is no failure in his program."
If there was one thing he'd learned in his undercover operation to observe Stark, it was not about Stark, but about himself.  Steve did not like being undercover.  He liked being
But Steve didn't really feel like looking through right now. Compared to the very real issues they were facing, the photo shoot seemed almost silly.
"Turn around for me?" asked Tony hopefully.  Steve's ass in those shorts.
"No. I'm not going to go be mated to a freezer," Steve assured him. "He's probably...well, he won't be let out unless they have a solution. And even then he's mildly insane. I don't really think there's a person to go back to, is there?  Besides, he touched without asking, Tony. You never do that."
"Alright.  ...let me confirm that with Rumlow and I'll get off your back," said Fury.
Pepper huffed and let it go.  After seeing how Tony had been without Steve for two months, she was just glad they were back together.  Also, Tony was at present too distracted to think about the upcoming anniversary, for which she was grateful.  "Fine, do whatever you like. Just sign these documents."
Right on cue, his chest flared suddenly with a searing, white-hot pain and Tony let out an involuntary gasp.  He reached out for Steve's hand, seeking comfort automatically.  He grabbed Clint's by mistake/
He realized he was responsible.  He had gotten his Alpha in trouble.  This was his fault.
Tony didn't want to admit he was panicking, but he was.  Of course he was.  Because he was arriving alone to what was frankly Steve's dinner.  Steve was Captain America, for cryin' out loud.
Steve shot Natasha a pleading look, but Natasha's eyes only narrowed further when the waitress brought over all of Tony's drinks.  Maybe service might have been denied to a lesser man, but everyone in the bar clearly knew who he was, and they were all not-so-subtlety gawking.
"Come on.  Try me.  Try me.  Take your shot!" challenged Tony, bristling.
"No, thank you."  She watched as he pried the lid of a Styrofoam cup and stirred in some creamer.  She liked him quite a bit better that Jasper Sitwell, that was for sure. "After Steve's heat, is the surveillance team going to be lifted?"
"No.  I want you to clear up your Friday night for a sit-down with the King of Wakanda.  They're having some civil unrest in the north and a lot of the insurgents are using old Stark technology."
"...I guess I always knew, deep down, that this would have to come to a head eventually," continued Tony, relaxing against the bar.  "Because, you know, my experience in Afghanistan was so humbling and it really put so much in perspective for me. It was an easy choice to make."
"Because Steve and Pepper are there."
Clint had already severed the connection.  Tony looked down at his notes.  He'd written "1960s," "neck glands," "bite Steve," and "gross."  He tossed the notebook back onto the desk and frowned, swiveling his his chair, tapping his fingers against his chin thoughtfully.  Biology was not Tony's strong suit.  He was a whiz at engineering and programming, at anything involving math or mechanics.. but when it came to the organic side of science, he was well aware he was no brighter than the average person.
Clearly, he thought the scuffle was stupid as well.  But Steve had the impression Jack wasn't used to actually voicing opinions like that.
"It's... going okay.  ...did you know Steve could sing?  Listen to him in there."
organizations?" griped Tony quietly, annoyed by Steve's popularity.  He was used to being the popular one. It felt weird to live with someone who was more famous than him.
was why Tony was such a lousy Alpha, because his role model wasn't even an Alpha at all, just one of Dad's little jokes.
"G'night Steve.  Wake me up when it's tomorrow," mumbled Tony, pulling Steve close to him, cuddling their bodies together.  Steve's was smooth and warm against his.  This was how honeymoons were supposed to be; not scrambling away from exploding artillery shells and dodging electrified whips and flinging I-beams around.  This was normal, domestic, safe.  Even with the sunlight filtering in through the ceiling-to-wall windows that lined the west wall, Tony passed out easily, his head resting on top of Steve's, his arms around the blond.
How to communicate to Pepper all the wonderful things that had happened?  A new heart.  His own omega.   A second chance.
"He's still in New Mexico, isn't he?" asked Sam lightly.
They all sat around the table, Aria and three SHIELD agents and Tony and Steve.  Tony was in a good mood despite yesterday's foiled lodge plans; he hadn't had anything like this for a long, long time.
"Ugh..."  Tony preferred to go in, guns blazing. His suit was a lot of things.  "Quiet" wasn't one of them. He scanned the forest line anxiously, but couldn't see much; he popped on the face plate and switched over to infrared.  Two heat signatures were stalking toward the back door. Steve's was crazy bright, a result of his overactive metabolism. Tony watched them move, slowly, stealthily, heart pounding.  He couldn't see anything at all inside the building; the concrete walls of the bunker were too thick. It was half-warehouse, half-bomb shelter, and it was no conducive to easy spying.
were thrown into the bottom of a cupboard, as they definitely weren't needed anymore.
Because none of his emotions came out in a constructive way, Tony's awful coping habits spiraled.  His drinking went up, his sleeping and eating patterns became more erratic, and he woke Steve up more than once yelling in his sleep.
Tony's rutting paused for a moment.  The surface of the water was still.
The corner of Tony's mouth twitched.  "You got it, Cap," he said quietly, with a sarcastic little two-fingered salute.
tasting him.  His body went limp and if he hadn't been grabbing Steve's neck his knees would have buckled.  It was like nothing he'd ever experienced, this kiss.  It was rich and raw and perfect; their mouths were like puzzle pieces, made specially for each other; Tony had never kissed an omega but suddenly he was lost in his desire for Steve, mind unusually and blissfully blank; he was a creature of pure instinct and emotion, and his emotion was one of joy, fulfillment, love.  His tongue ran over Steve's lips, his jaw worked against Steve's for a brief, perfect moment.
"We've got most of this situation under control," said Councilwoman Hawley, "But we're relying on this next hour to go smoothly.  Excuse me, Mr. Stark, you can't wear that pin."
And they'd made an example out of him.  When they'd shot him with the gun, the one labeled STARK, Tony had felt something wet hit his face.  That kid, the one Tony had scoffed out, had gone out a hero. His last words?  "Fuck you."  He'd spit in Raza's face.  And Tony?  He'd knelt when he'd been told to, because he didn't want his brains blown out like that kid's.  He was a coward.
"Must have been very uncomfortable," Boswell commented from the sofa. He was the most dressed down Steve had ever seen him, in dress pants and a v-neck sweater.
Tony tracing the scar behind his neck made him shiver. "I really hope we don't ever have to go to one of those conferences again. We got our info and we made our point. Though if there is another we should ask the staff to hand over names, so we know who the assholes are." Steve reached up to run a hand through Tony's hair and kissed his head. "Sleep well Tony."
"Clint, don't tell him that!" protested Laura, but Cooper was already eating with gusto.
Sean laughed.  "Uh, well, we have wine.  Come on in."
"We're not
fans are omegas.  I guess we get fans based on what people relate to.  I mean, don't know what it's like to have heats."
He hadn't really been sleeping.  Just sitting, staring blank-eyed, thoughtless, empty.
"Good boy, JARVIS."
"Pietro?  What happened?"
"Most people like to focus on their careers in early life first," she pointed out. "Steve is still young."
Steve listened to Tony quietly, his throat welling up a little. A family? Friends? Sure he had Natasha and Clint but that was where it stopped. The fact that Tony was being so sweet was a big comfort. His chest ached with some strange kind of relief. He wasn't alone. He wasn't in danger here. He had no war to fight. It was all okay. And Tony was okay. Better than that. He felt
"No, asshole, I just woke up. Why? This about your 84 thing?"
, but
That question though... it made him pause. Steve swallowed.  "If I felt like I could communicate with him then this would be a lot simpler. I don't even know if he's capable of communication, Tony. I'm not even sure he's still...a person anymore," Steve whispered and felt almost mournful. If Bucky had died in the fall it might have been easier than this...seeing him as a weapon for the very cause that he died fighting against, that wasn't easy. It made Steve feel sick that they'd ruined the memory of him like that.
Karpov gave him another cigarette for giving the right response.  The rewards were already raining down.
"Pietro says stairwell four is clear.  Let's go. You can't fight with a bad ankle," he said.  He put a hand over Steve's on his cheek, wishing Steve could be more consistent.  Karpov was wonderfully consistent. Karpov wouldn't have said they'd mate after the objective was complete and then turn around and change the objective entirely.  Bucky was feeling a surprising amount of irritation about being denied mating rights when he'd followed Steve's orders after bonding.
"Hey," Aria waved to Tony with a smile. "Hey. Those pancakes smell good!  Did you actually make them?"
"Omega," he murmured with delight, nosing Steve's ribs playfully.
The need for modular, self-assembling armor, thought Tony, was obviously greater than he realized.  His current armor was chafing his dick to hell. And he was completely fucking trapped. Although, he thought, in a way it was good... if he'd had the ability, he would have stripped naked and fucked Steve stupid right there on the floor of the HYDRA based.  He wondered if such a thing had ever happened to Natasha and Clint. They both seemed too cool for that to happen but of course, it had at least once, when they'd bonded. Losing control was an experience Tony had mixed feelings about. He lost control often, but generally it was on purpose.  A controlled sort of losing control. He'd never had his brain completely hijacked like that, not until Steve had entered his life with his sexy little omega smells. God damn.
Clint sounded like he'd just woken up when he answered. "Why are you doing this to me?" he grunted. "Oh-- and happy birthday."
"My neck hurts," Steve said instantly. "Ankle is minimal to how it felt before." Considering he hadn't been standing and walking on it, it felt much better. The serum was doing its magic and within a week Steve was sure he'd have no pain in his foot at all.
Tony's jaw tightened a little more as Steve ran his fingers over his face.  "We're both sterile, Steve.  Or we're... supposed to be."  He huffed a little and shifted on top of Steve, unwilling to get off of him.  The idea of another Alpha out there, going after him...
Tony pulled Steve against him, folding him into an embrace.  Steve's smell was almost terrified and Tony felt awful for him.  He couldn't tell Steve about Ivan, not now; he couldn't tell anyone else, either, because it was probably bounce right back to Steve.
Back in the kitchen, Boswell had wandered down looking thoroughly rumpled.  Donner kept glancing up at him with a shy sort of awe.
do that."
"Ah!  I had nearly forgotten!  It is eleven months late, but I believe this is the custom in your country?"  One of Dora Milaje stepped forward and placed an enormous orchid on the table.  Tony resisted a groan.
Upstairs, Tony was hugging Steve to him, heart pounding, breathing heavily after another orgasm.  He nosed Steve's ear. He was still furious, yet also affectionate; his mind and his body were tugging him in all directions.  His knot throbbed inside of Steve, who was wrapped around him like a spider monkey.
"May I?"
it himself), and a lot of Alphas wouldn't. Steve wasn't the only one who was struggling to get used to equality.
"All yours," gasped Tony, tensing.  "All yours..." He arched into his omega, hips stuttering and jerking, spilling his seed into him.  He sank back into the couch, Steve still sitting on top of him, his cock twitching as it pumped the last few strings of semen into him.  Tony smiled up lazily.
"Okay. Okay...the contact lenses sound good. Let's get you in bed, come on."
"Okay. That's it. I'm leaving..."
Pepper sighed quietly, looking between both of them. "What am I going to do with you two?"
Tony zipped up the fleece onesie and pulled out his phone.
"Aria Platsky is downstairs for you."
"I never let him--" Steve didn't finish that sentence, pressing his lips into a thin line.  "This isn't the same Stark, you know that right? Howard and Tony. They're different people. I would never have let Howard bond me; guy was a jerk." He smiled almost sadly. "But then all guys were jerks back then."
"There is a message from you from Dr. David David Gleason, Captain," JARVIS informed Steve.  "He describes it as urgent, but personal in nature. It is with regards to Mr. Malick's health.  Due to HIPAA regulations, he cannot give you the message without Mr. Malick's presence and consent."
"I'll meet you up there," said Tony, turning his head to steal a kiss.  "Maybe we could fool around a bit." He linked arms with Steve. Malick's room was two floors above theirs, so Steve walked out of the elevator, leaving Tony on his own.
Pepper swept over.  "A word, Mr. Stark?" she asked with a tight-lipped smile.
"You have any idea what brought this on?" Rhodey asked and Steve shook his head.
Tony didn't care.  Nothing short of a nuclear blast could have stopped him.  Steve's smell enveloped him; Tony was biting his neck and the taste was incredible; Steve was so juicy, so impossibly wet and squishy and tight and every thrust of Tony's hips made him see stars.  Steve was so wet and pliant that Tony was able to move the knot in and out and the sensation was incredible; it came out with a wet pop and the feeling of Steve's entrance tightening over it again and again was almost unbearable in its intensity.
an omega and
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah," said Tony dismissively, waving a hand at her and leaving.  "I'm just gonna go down to the pit, check on my car, you know, get some air... I'll be fast, don't worry."
"So... can't you just drink like a whole bottle?"
"Pepper, please," begged Tony.
"You know, I'm actually showcasing one of them at your Expo. Did you know that, Tony?"
"She lives all the way in Westwood," said Happy evasively.
"...I got Tectonic's autograph!" said one of the bodyguards with a grin.
A second woman dropped onto the couch next to her.  "Oh my
He wanted to try to justify it.  Protest that hat guy was a guard, not a scientist, and Tony wasn't exactly trying to kill him, really, and he certainly hadn't tortured him, it had been over quickly.  Obviously there was a moral grey area, but Tony had done what he had to do... right? ...but...
