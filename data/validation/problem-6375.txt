“Of course not,” Steve replied. “Bad for Captain America's image. Couldn't have a drunk Irish dad could he?” He shook his head. “Besides, people didn’t talk about things like that. Not the way they do now.”
“Oh good,” Bruce said, glancing over. “I was afraid we might have to pry you from the lab with a crowbar.”
“Beautiful, so fucking beautiful,” Tony murmured.  Steve was still shivering with orgasm as Tony eased his fingers free and pulled Steve to his knees.  Tony stood facing Steve, legs spread and cock dripping.
(Was this what he talked about in therapy?) Tony’s heart twisted sharply. (Somehow, he’d imagined Steve talking about culture shock in the modern world. PTSD from the crash. Not that sick guilt, the self-loathing, the thought that the blood on your hands would never come off, the clinging stench of death, it would always be there, and that even if--)
“My name is Farhad and it will be my pleasure to serve you this evening,” the handsome bearded Dom said with a slight bow. “To start, Mr. and Ms. Ahmadi would like to welcome you with some
“Good,” Steve said.  It was all terribly awkward. He tried a smile and added, “No alien invasions, so it’s officially a good day.”  It wasn’t a very good joke and she didn’t pretend that it was. But it
“It’s lovely, dear,” Mrs. Rhodes cut him off and wrapped him in her arms. She held him in a long, lingering hug. “I’ll see you in the morning.”
Clint rolled his shoulders and said, more seriously, “Ok. We were working on rushes, so you start then we’ll trade.” Then he grinned and waved his hands. “Come at me ‘bro!”
Tony shrugged. “Sure. I mean, they’re spies and they probably won’t approve, so it’s not like they’re gonna leak it to the press.”
Tony stroked Steve’s hair, relishing its softness and the little contented humming noise Steve let out.  (Huh.) Tony smiled.  (That didn’t turn out so badly, did it?)
Steve drew back and looked down at him, smiling. He caressed Tony’s cheek and asked, “Can I get a check-in?”
“Last time I flew,” Natasha said, “you complained the whole time that you were bored and wanted to fly.”
“Good,” Tony murmured, still stroking him, “because I want you to.  I want to make you feel so good. I want to serve you.”
Meanwhile, between phone calls and calculations and projections, a stupid little part of Tony’s brain kept insisting that by the time he solved this R&D disaster (which was also now on the verge of being a PR disaster and a legal disaster too), Steve might have changed his mind.  (Stupid.  He’s not going anywhere. He already
: and, if it helps, just know there is literally nothing you could say that would make me think less of you
Rogers cut himself off abruptly; he’d managed to stop just short of blurting out “it’s not ‘cause you’re a sub!”
Rogers took a sharp little breath and the expression of his face was . . . strange. (Huh? Weird.) The Captain cleared his throat before answering in an odd tone, “You may be right at that, Mr. Stark.”
(Please give me the courage I need to face what lies ahead, whatever it may be.  Thank you, Lord, for bringing Tony into my life, for this miracle.  Thank you for giving me back a sense of home, a sense of purpose.  Thank you for my friends, for their patience and generosity.  For letting me serve my country.)
Of course, she’d said things like that before—plenty of times—yet it always left Tony wrong-footed, touched but awkward.
“Yeah,” Steve said, sounding grateful for the intervention. “But we haven’t been together very long so I figure we don’t have to say anything to them. Not yet. Right?”
“So, let me see if I’ve got this,” Steve said. “Either, it looks like other aliens saw the arachnoid invasion and are trying to copy them. Or these are semi-natural phenomena, randomly occurring in the environment, kinda like a tornado.”
“Oh wow,” Steve said, gazing at the motorcycle with what looked like surprised nostalgia, maybe edged with sorrow? “A Norton Dominator? It’s like my old bike.”
They jerked each other off, rough and frantic.  It was all too much.  Steve was gasping and panting.  He pressed his flushed face against Tony’s neck.  “Tony, please,” he whispered desperately, not exactly sure what he was asking for.
Steve shrugged at Clint, then took a deep breath and threw a sharp punch. The bag shook on its chain, but for the thousandth time didn't break.
should have put his coat on. Stupid.) Steve didn’t turn around. Even over the sound of the wind, Tony could hear Steve’s choked breathing. He was crying.
Steve bit his lip.  “Um, before,” Steve started haltingly, “in bed, the first time, when I tried to, uh, go further . . .”-- he fumbled-- “. . . it made me choke.  I-- I gagged.  It just—“  Steve frowned, then took a deep breath.
“Well, if each Avenger has his or her own floor, I’m not sure how much team bonding we’ll really get from living together.”  Tony frowned and Bruce continued.  “I mean, we each have our own bathrooms, living rooms—even our own full kitchens—but no designated communal space.”
?)  Rogers must have read his expression wrong, since he added a bit sheepishly, “Well, of course they have mass at ten also, but then it’s in English.”  Tony focused on his eggs.
This chapter touches on issues previously dealt with in the story, especially so PTSD and harassment.
“Ridiculous,” Tony mumbled again.  Steve stroked his neck gently and Tony paused.  “Why would you even ask something like that?”
She never told him how stupid he’d been.  Or complained about losing the merger she’d been working so hard on.  Or mentioned the hit their stocks had taken.
“Wow,” Steve breathed, their faces still close together. He ran his thumb over Tony’s cheekbone again, then took a little step back.
“Yeah?” Tony asked. But instead of answering when Tony looked up, Steve placed a tender kiss on his lips. (Oh!) Steve’s fingers clenched at his hip, pulling him closer. Tony stroked his hands across the broad expanse of Steve’s chest, as Steve’s tongue caressed his lips, soft and inquiring, and Tony met him eagerly.
“But,” Carmichael faltered, “we haven’t even started going through the briefing packets I made you!”
Rogers’ tone was a little mournful as he added, “I just wish there were something I could do to help.”  Tony’s eyes had already been drifting back to the schematics when Rogers added, “If there’s anything I can do, Mr. Stark, anything at all, please let me know.”
“I notice that as we’ve been talking, you always refer to your teammates by code name or title when you talk about them. Are you always that formal?”
The note popped up when he hovered over the little (a) the note created.  Even writing with the stylus, Tony’s handwriting auto-formatted to a typed font.  (Of course it did-- he had terrible handwriting.)
“No!” Clint shook his head urgently, then grimaced. “Well, yes—but not like that! Just with all the purity bullshit back when Cap was growing up, I figured, even if he always seemed like a basically decent guy there was still . . . stuff. Under there.”
The very faint sound of the elevator’s buzz on the way to the penthouse was a comfort, almost like a purr.
“I love you too, Tony. So much.” Steve took a sip of his own coffee. He was still giving Tony that absurdly besotted smile.
“If you’re already making changes . . .” Steve began hesitantly, frowning, “uh, do you think you could make it not quite so tight?” His voice lilted up hopefully.
After letting the tea steep for a bit—though probably not as long as he should have—he plucked out the tea bag and padded over to where Pep had curled up.
“Related?” Katie asked steadily. “Yeah.” She blinked quickly a few times, then added: “My sister. Paramedic.”
Rogers snorted. “What are they going to do? Fire me? Tell the press I lied?” Rogers shrugged. “They were worried about PR and I’m pretty sure saving New York City was good PR—“ he said it with a grimace, “so why would they rock the boat? They’d be the ones making bad PR then.”
“True, but here our agents have the training to help contain the Hulk. Stark Tower and its environs are vulnerable.  So’s Stark.”
Once Tony was sitting, Steve used the leads at Tony’s wrists to pull his hands behind his back. He rubbed his cheek against Tony’s again and nipped at Tony’s throat. Tony’s heart sped.
(Duh! Because it's an external arc reactor! Introduce a secondary core! Paladium or metanoym alloy that can double shielding output and absorb-- shit. No, wait, no. Temperature spike, toxic discharge. Shit. Did this. Did this already. Fuck.)
“You know I’m active duty, right? I could be, like, in a fire fight? Or a dangerous location? You do know that. But you just hack right into my system!”
And nothing humiliating or degrading.  No surprises there.  Steve Rogers hated bullies and it didn’t seem like behavior he’d be able to separate even in a sexual context.  Steve had been humiliated and degraded by bullies enough in his life.  Tony’s heart seized a little at the sight of the “X” for “HARD LIMIT” by “medical play.”  Tony felt a swell of protectiveness and tenderness so intense and sudden it nearly frightened him.  (Calm down, stupid.  He’s fine.)  He took a deep breath.
“Likewise, JARVIS,” Rogers said politely towards the ceiling.  Well, okay, fair enough—that was where the speakers were located.   But, boo!  Somebody must have warned Rogers about JARVIS just to spoil Tony’s fun. Tony’d been looking forward to watching Rogers freak out a little.
“Tony,”  Steve repeated softly, running his hand up and down Tony’s chest through his pajamas.  (Don’t hide from me again. Don’t cover up the arc reactor.  I love you.)  “It was a lot, but it wasn’t too much.  It was perfect.”
Steve was swimming through paradox, frantic but calm, desperate but content. . .   It was like being underwater, but warm not cold.  Floating, floating . . . He felt like he was being held by Tony everywhere at once.
(It had to be there somewhere—he kept some in all the kitchenettes of all his properties in case she visited.)
Steve cleared his throat and answered, “No, of course not.”  He slid the pancake onto a plate, then added, “I was thinking about you.”
. Notes on the qualities and characteristics of the aliens. The best strategies to fight them. The most effective unit formations. Weapons. Gear.
, Bruce dropped by Steve’s suite to wish him “happy holidays.”  He was going to an academic conference in Buenos Aires and decided to stay on for a while to do some sightseeing.  Steve wished him a pleasant trip.
“Dr. Banner asks that I remind you of your need for sustenance, sir.  He says dinner will be ready shortly.”
“I wasn’t suggesting we set up a bar.” Steve tried not to snap, but the words came out with a bit of an edge.
“Me?” Tony said, eyebrows raised. “Fine. I’ve felt great all day,” he lied. It was on the tip of his tongue to protest that he hadn’t been that drunk, but it was such a cliché it could only make him look worse.
Tony headed toward the elevator, then paused to add, “Oh, and you guys can just leave the dishes.  The staff will get them in the morning.”  He called over his shoulder, “Good night!”
Tony suppressed a wince when Belford tightened his grip again and tried to maneuver Tony towards the corner rail. Ah, fuck. He didn’t want to be in full sight of the ballroom for a confrontation, but he didn’t feel great about being out of sight either. Lose-lose.
Rhodey grinned up at him. “Relax, man. Just a little banged up. War Machine had a rough week.” Rhodey grimaced. “You know how it is.”
“Oh?” Steve said, trying to sound casual. “That sounds interesting.” He swallowed. “So, you’ve seen Tony? I thought he might still be holed up in the lab.”
After a few moment’s silence, Rhodey said, “I know you think you’re crap with people, but you’re not. At least, not always and I think—“ he paused a moment, considering, “you’ve got a really good team, Tony. I didn’t get to know them all very well, but Steve, well . . . Steve is a really good guy and I could tell he admires you. And, hey, that’s a more illustrious beginning than we had! So, don’t sweat it, Tones. You’re fine. Really.”
“Hey, Tony,” Steve said, looking up from his notes with a smile.  “You weren’t in the workshop when I dropped by.  Guess I know why now.”
“Huh?” Tony looked over. (Oh yeah. Lieutenant Whatsit is still here.) “Oh. Right. Thanks. JARVIS'll show you out. Freight elevator to one, J. Dismissed!”
With a little luck in RL and a little writing inspiration, I'm hoping I might have the next chapter up soon.  Say, Valentine's day?  :)
“I’m a billionaire because my dad was a multi-millionaire,” Tony said. “Most super-rich people are super-rich due to accidents of birth. That isn’t an accomplishment; at least Erskine chose you for the serum because of who you were before it. I’m rich by birth, and it’s easy to be a philanthropist when you’re filthy rich.”
The elevator ride felt interminable.  Steve wasn’t exactly sure what was happening, but Tony seemed content to touch him only at his wrist and Steve felt oddly unable to move.  He wanted to slam Tony into the elevator wall—wanted Tony to slam
When she looked up, it was to smile at Steve, though she was clearly still tense as she joked, “So I’d be very grateful if you could convince all the super-villains of New York, Asgard, etc. to take a bit of a break until this is resolved.”
When Tony arrived on the common floor, Bruce was peering into a steaming pot while Nat King Cole soulfully wished everyone a merry Christmas and a happy new year.
Tony felt a pang, part gratitude, part melancholy. After his parents had died, the Rhodes had offered him a place in their family, invited him for Thanksgiving, Christmas, family vacations, but he’d never quite let himself accept, not fully. He’d come around sometimes, pushed them away at others, by turns too needy and too proud. (Obie’d said they wanted his money, but Tony’d never thought that.) Tony’d mistaken kindness for pity and couldn’t bear to accept it.
Tony pressed up against him, kissing him, thrusting his tongue into Steve’s mouth.  Tony reached down, finally touching Steve’s aching erection.  His hips bucked off the bed and he whimpered into Tony’s mouth.
And now Steve laughed, but his shoulders were still bunched up tight and tense.  Tony pressed himself into Steve’s arms and said a little more softly, “He couldn’t change my mind. Especially about you.”  Tony rubbed his cheek against Steve’s massive chest and Steve let out a long deep sigh.
“Listen, Tony,” Bruce said, in that gentle tone that Tony loved and hated, “I've never found it easy to make new connections.”  He gestured around the lab.  “Not unless there's something to do, a scientific problem.”  He swallowed and fidgeted slightly. “But, I do want to try.  I saw some of SHEILD’s research and it matches my own and . . . Betty’s.”  He stumbled over her name.  “The secret to controlling . . . the Other Guy . . . might actually be bonding this team as a unit.  So, I’m focusing on the positive.  I think it will help.”  He added softly, “It might help us both.”
Steve gave a hesitant nod and Tony rushed on, “And then, if you want, we can keep working. I put your laptop over there so it wouldn’t fall, but I left the files alone. And, hey, if you don’t mind giving me a hand with a few little things on the devices, that would be great.”
(But, yeah, okay—after some of the shit they’d all been through, maybe not a good surprise for Pep…)
Up next: Steve reads SM101...  The chapter has been in the works for ages, so I hope you're looking forward to it as much as I am.   :-)
Steve bit his lip, looking pleased but embarrassed. He opened his mouth as if to protest, but Tony cut him off.
“Anyway,” Tony said, charging ahead, “Thanksgiving. I thought we might make a thing of it—order a turkey and whatnot.”
Tony was sorely tempted to go down and check on Steve right then, but he felt rough and exhausted and far from ready. Besides, Steve’d be in good hands with JARVIS. Tony gathered up his duvet and went back to the penthouse.
Deputy Commander Hill had the most perfect poker face. (Besides Natasha, of course, but Natasha’s a friend now so it’s not the same).  It always made Steve a little uneasy.  Maybe she was still angry that he’d called her “ma’am” the first time they’d met?
“I’ll tell you what to do—you know, like one of those tv shows where a doctor walks some random dude through performing a tracheotomy.”
“I, uh,”  The king’s eyes roamed him, up and down, then he blushed brighter.  “Let us go sit by the fire where you’ll be warm.”
Tony propped up suddenly to watch Steve who had just *moaned* while *sucking his cock.*  (Oh fuck!)  Steve’s eyes were closed and his hand kept twitching where it rested on Tony’s hip.
“And it shouldn’t even have been a surprise,” Steve added, sounding frustrated.  “I’ve already seen you kneel for Pepper at the Tower.  I know you two are--” he paused, searching for words, “--like that.”
“Of course you did! It’s a classic!” Tony said. He turned to Bruce. “Do you want to finish off the chow mein? I know it’s a favorite of yours.”
“Well,” Tony said suddenly feeling awkward, “surprisingly enough, uh--” He licked his lips. “Captain America's sub is… me.”
Steve gave a tight nod. Tony stroked his thumb back and forth across Steve’s wrist, trying to get him to loosen up.
Tony licked his lips and took a cautious step closer, not breaking eye contact.  Steve was still holding his hand; Tony squeezed it.
“Now what?” an Agent asked, giving voice (whiny, irritating voice) to what Tony’d just been wondering.
Tony smiled as he said, “They’re not tremendously sturdy.  Certainly not built for a super soldier.  Not yet anyway.”  Tony dropped his voice lower as he leaned in and said, “But you don’t really want to pull free, do you sweetheart?  You want to keep your hands right where I put them, don’t you?”
Steve thought about some of the videos he’d seen on the internet, where the men had seemed by turns cruel and vindictive, their behavior degrading and humiliating.  He’d still been hard watching those videos, but they left him with a sick sort of churning in his stomach.  It looked more like abuse or rape than lovemaking.  (“You don’t deserve my cock, you stupid whore . . . I’m gonna fuck you ‘til you bleed whether you want it or not, you pathetic piece of shit . . .”)  Steve shuddered.  His research had assured him it was all pretend, all consensual, and nobody had been hurt (thank God!), but it had left him feeling gross and unwilling to touch his cock, a little ill to find he was still hard.  (He’d stopped exploring videos after that.)
“So beautiful, sweetheart,” Steve murmured softly.  “You’re perfect, Tony . . . Love you . . . Love you so much . . .”
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
“I live here too,” Steve snapped. “You have no right to do that! Especially without my permission, it’s . . .”
“But you've been keeping busy, haven't you?” Bruce asked. He checked on something in the oven and put a lid on his curry, turning down the heat. “I saw that another order of art supplies came in for you.”
Steve was breathing deeply in sleep, brow slightly creased and lips slightly parted, his arm slung loosely around Tony’s waist. With a bit of regret, Tony slid carefully out from under his arm and headed to the bathroom for a piss and a glass of water. He considered heading to the workshop, but Steve looked so beautiful . . . and if he woke up, Tony’d hate for him to be alone.
(Shit.)   Tony hugged Steve close, continued the little caresses.  Should he let it drop?  Did the ‘I love you’ seem manipulative?  He hadn’t meant it to be.  Tony was fumbling around, trying to find a way to turn the conversation back in the right direction.
“I will,” Steve assured him, but he sounded a little nervous. He glanced at the door and back to Tony. “Okay. Well, I’ll see you later.”
“Tony, I didn’t mean it like that,” Pepper said firmly. “You know how it is, though. Famous people get death threats. I may just be a CEO, not a proper celebrity or superhero, but it happens. They’re idle threats and, well, if I start taking them seriously I’ll never live my life again.”
“I’m very glad to hear it,” Steve added, smiling--not quite able to keep the words in.  Something tight in his chest seemed to loosen at the thought of Tony’s return. “And he’ll have the full support of all the Avengers here.  Once he’s back.”
“Uh, thank you,” Rogers mumbled. And when Rogers settled a little stiffly, Tony made a point of sitting next to him, a silent reassurance.
Rogers sighed. “I know that too, I guess. I just—it’s all so . . . disorienting. Lots of things are obviously better—so much better—but then some things seem worse and then it’s like this punch in the gut to see it because of all the other things that have changed.” He frowned. “I mean, sure, people made nasty remarks before too. Called each other names. But--” He gestured at the tablet. “—not like that. Not that I heard.”
“Hey, it's okay,” Steve murmured. “Rhodey won't be flying War Machine for weeks. You have time. Rest, come back fresh. It'll be better. But--” Tony could practically feel Steve hesitating, like his reluctance was a physical force, heavy and bludgeoning, a powerful contrast to Steve's soft fingers lightly caressing his hair. “There are some things engineering genius can't solve. Injuries happen. It's not your fault. You know that, right? And no amount of genius can keep a man in combat 100% safe. It just-- it can't be done, no matter how brilliant you are.”
As they approached the red and gold, rope-shaped alien, both aliens started emitting terrible, shrill screeches. (Oh man, yikes.) Tony reminded himself that to The Eewoo, Steve’s lovely baritone probably sounded horrible too.
for the military without looking at it carefully.) He was vaguely aware of Lieutenant Johnson talking in the background: something something really honored something something workshop something Avengers something. Tony signed with a flourish and handed the paperwork back. He was eager to get War Machine into the workshop, though oddly reluctant to see the damage up close. (Rhodey's fine. You saw him. Really, he's just fine.) Tony brushed the Lieutenant aside and took over the handcart.
“We’re only recruiting one additional trustee at the moment,” Tony said. “But of course, if you’re not interested . . .”
“Bullshit.  Total bullshit.”  Tony shook his head.  “All right, enough stalling. What have you done to it?  Where’s the suit?”
. . . . . .. .  . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ..  .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
“No, you’re not,” Deetz said firmly, letting go of Tony’s wrist. “Go with Rebecca.” The Dom crossed his arms over his chest. “We won’t lay a finger on you until you’ve registered a safeword in the house system.”
“No, it’s fine.” Steve shrugged. “They’ve probably got all the samples and statistics they could ever need by now and will be done with their study soon.”
“You know I’m going to steal some of your tiramisu, right?” Tony asked as their server took her leave.
submission so openly in front of the others. He hardly wanted the movie to end--except for the hope that his offering had pleased Steve as much as it pleased him to make it and that Steve might show his appreciation in private with something . . . special.  Tony tried not to let himself focus too much on that possibility lest he make an embarrassing display of his anticipation.
As always, infinite thanks to everyone who cheers me on with comments and my incomparable beta, thatwhichyields.
A frown flickered across Rogers’ face before he smiled again and said, “Well, if they’re all like you, I have nothing to worry about.”
Tony continued, “My metaphorical rolodex, oh wait—have you seen one of those yet? They held these little index cards for contact info in the eighties and, anyway-- My, you know, little black book, is ten times the size of Natasha’s. So, just set some basic parameters and I’ll do a way better job finding you a date. Is it for the gala?”
Steve’s hand sped up and he was making a steady stream of desperate little noises.  (Oh fuck!  Steve!)
Steve waved his hands.  “They’re a team, Tony!  And, okay, at first McCoy and Spock don’t get along, ‘cause they’re so different, but they eventually figure things out.  They’d all lay on the wire for each other or for the good of the Enterprise!  And, even in the little things, they take care of each other. They work together!”
“Great,” Tony said, setting the damaged StarkTab aside. “So let’s go not sleep together. I’m thinking
“Don’t know if we’ve ever spent this long in my suite before,” Steve said pensively, sliding a fresh rash of bacon onto the platter. (He was clearly trying to
Steve pressed a little closer, the length of his body so close Tony could practically feel it. (He wondered if Steve were growing as achingly hard as he was, but couldn’t make himself move to find out; he wanted to let Steve . . .) Tony dropped his head to the side, exposing his neck.
“Deal,” he promised, offering to shake on it, but Pep threw her arms around the armor for a clattering hug.
Steve’s cheeks heated even at the careful euphemism, but he took the card without hesitation when the Professor held it out.
“Well, excuse me, if I find it a little insulting that *real* heroes are being beaten on the commercial market by a fictitious alien who would *so totally loose* to the Hulk!”  Tony waved his hands, narrowly avoiding his glass of wine.  “And our stuff raises money for children’s hospitals and disabled veterans!  They’re just using the money to fuel more shitty Batman movies.”
As he rambled, Steve’s smile grew warmer and wider, chasing the sad shadows from his face, until he finally laid a hand on Tony’s arm. Tony fell abruptly silent.
“Mr. Stark,” Rogers said, with a smile, holding out his hand.  “Welcome aboard.”  And holy fuck, Rogers just said it so
Mrs. Rhodes shook her head. “I’m making all your favorites already; no need to butter me up. Enough butter in the crust.”
Well.  If Steve’s kissing had been anything to go by, he sure as shit hadn’t changed his mind. He’d seemed pretty riled. And, hey, maybe he had exciting plans for tonight?
"He wasn’t my alpha," Steve snapped, then added, "sir.” Steve took a deep breath.  “I'd be honored to serve where he did."
“Now, I—” Steve said, then paused. He swallowed thickly, then said in a rough, low voice: “I’m going to do with you as I please.”
Tony frowned. Had Steve found his contract off-putting? Had it been too much, just offering him everything all at once like that?
“I know,” Tony said gently.  “You’ve said that before, sweetheart, or don’t you remember?”  Tony ran his thumb across Steve’s cheek.  “I know I don’t have to.  I want to.”
An hour later, Tony threw up his hands.  He’d made computation errors.  Computation!  It wasn’t even math.  He couldn’t concentrate.  He downed his coffee and resisted the temptation to go get something stronger.  (Bad idea.  Don’t.)  He’d been planning out The Conversation with more than just the back of his mind-- obviously, if he was screwing up his specs with fucking
Steve kind of shook himself. “Yes, of course,” he said to Tony, then addressed the Quinjet more generally, “Good job, team. Successful mission.”
Tony drummed his fingers on his workbench. Maybe he’d go check on Bruce in his lab, where Bruce pretended that he wasn’t still looking for a way to eliminate the Hulk. (Tony played along and pretended not to know, because he was nice like that.) Tony considered it for a few moments, but decided he was too fidgety for anyplace with test tubes.
Rhodey just laughed. “Bull-fucking-shit, man. No way. You’ve got fractured bones and had some sort of space coma. Don’t even think about it.”
“No, I’ll go,” Natasha assured him and, light and swift on her feet as ever, she glided after Bruce.
. . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
“And I got these,” Steve said, showing Tony a lovely set of hand-painted ceramic birds: a peacock, a wren, a chickadee, and a bluebird.
“You know that it is,” Bruce snapped, then took a deep breath and relaxed his fist.  “I am interested.  Very interested.”
Tony made a noise of protest as Steve deprived him of something to suck, but then those lovely fingers were rubbing at his hole, slick and insistent and he thought his heart might burst.
“Yeah,”  Rhodey nodded.  He finished off his beer.  “So,” he hesitated a second, then asked, “do you think he’ll come out?  Eventually?”
Tony looked up indignantly.   “Just ‘cause I didn’t get hopped up on domosterone at puberty doesn’t mean—”
Tony wasn’t sure how long he’d been working, when he heard Steve begining to stir. Steve’s eyes fluttered open and his gaze immediately fell on Tony. His lips curled up into a beautiful sleepy smile and he murmured, “Tony?”
.  Tony rested his chin on Steve’s shoulder, his goatee scratching a little, and put his hands over Steve’s heart.
“The point is, doing the research isn’t cheating.  It’s important.  No matter what, we’ll still figure out how
“He’s--”  Tony fumbled.  “He’s everything he was in the comic books.  Only better.” Tony knew he was probably smiling like a loon.  “So much better. Because he’s
INFINITE GRATITUDE to thatwhichyeilds who made the photomanips for this chapter.  Aren’t they lovely, folks?
“Now, get out of my workshop,” he ordered, waving his hands, “I’m on a roll! Besides, it may be Friday, but it’s not dinnertime. See you then!”
“A fine for breach of contract—the price point for various potential infractions is on page 144—or your removal from the Avengers’ Initiative.”
And then Tony was padding towards him, quiet and barefoot.  Head bowed, Steve could hear-- could practically feel-- Tony pacing a slow circle around him.
Belford stepped a little closer. His cologne was expensive—Versace’s Masterful for Men—but applied with too heavy a hand. Tony took a step back and a sip of his G&T. Belford angled himself closer into Tony’s space again. When Tony glanced up to look around the ballroom, he found Rogers’ eyes fixed on him, but as soon as he made eye-contact Rogers looked away suddenly. His expression was blank. Or perhaps it was a slight frown. Tony couldn’t tell, but he didn’t like it. And maybe the NYT’s gossip columnist—Scott or Sanders or whoever wrote their trash now—was watching him too.
“That it wasn’t right,” Steve said, “for me—as Captain of the Avengers—to . . . how did he put it?  Expect ‘certain things’ from you?”
It was just as well Tony hadn’t needed an excuse for Steve. But, come to think of it, Steve hadn’t asked to come down to the workshop after their last training either. Tony shrugged it off.
“Obviously,” Tony said a little sharply.  “If I didn’t, I wouldn’t have a dozen lawyers working on the contract.”  There was a soft humming noise overhead.  Tony looked up at the quinjet.
Steve couldn’t seem to breathe.  His face was scalding. He nodded, cheek pressed against the sheets.
“See you next week!” Rhodey called out as Tony started to walk away. Tony just gave a distracted little wave and Rhodey chuckled. “Well, that's it. He’s going down the rabbit hole,” Rhodey added to Steve. “No prying him out once he's got War Machine to play with.”
“Thanks,” Steve said eventually, looking over at him. “For coming to get me. Sometimes, I just . . . I get so mad, you know?”
"With your build--even masking your scent and wearing that ridiculous outfit--you must have known we'd realize."
Does he not understand that he can always say no, he doesn’t have to force himself to please me?  Oh fuck.  We really didn’t talk enough.  He didn’t even know what a safeword was!  Fuck, fuck, fuck.)

Steve shivered.  It seemed like it had gotten chilly in his living room.  He reached out to pour himself a cup of tea—something soothing, something to ease the strange twisting in his guts—but the tea had gone cold.  He took a sip anyway; it was over-steeped now and tasted bitter.
they have waited until they got married?  The strange mirror world he’d been imagining dissolved into gray impossibility.  The early parts were easy to imagine: in a lot of ways dating was like making a new friend, but he’d never wanted sex with a woman and he never would.
—but he’d just stammered something he hoped was polite, then fled.  Or kept fighting.  He’d never reacted like that.  It was weird.
Rogers’ fists were clenched, his expression tight.  He may be an orientationist throw-back in general, but Tony felt pretty sure that he wasn’t faking his outrage.  He didn’t seem like that good an actor.
“I’m afraid my schedule is very busy for the next few weeks,” he told Harry gently, “and, now that I’m an Avenger, I’m not that involved in the day-to-day management of the Stark Scholars. But you’d have a chance to meet and help select our brilliant guest speakers—some of the finest mathematicians in the world. There would be lots of opportunities for you to share your love of mathematics with others.”
It was too hot and the air felt thin. Tony’s words made Steve’s cock leak and throb, but they made his stomach twist miserably too. Steve closed his eyes.
She was wearing one of her usual, sharp military-inspired suits and high heels; Tony wasn’t used to seeing her expression so vulnerable while she was wearing her armor.
At the penthouse, they walked hand-in-hand down the hallway, Steve’s other hand a warm pressure at the small of Tony’s back. When they reached the threshold to Tony’s bedroom, Steve paused. Before Tony could start talking contracts, firm limits, and seductive offers, Steve said softly: “I believe you offered me a kiss.”
Tony swallowed and glanced at Steve’s feet—hesitating only a moment—before taking a seat on the couch and cuddling up to Steve’s side.
Steve huffed.  “Well, I hope that’s not entirely true,” Steve said.  (Huh?)  “I, uh, hope you’d say no to someone else.”
Tony’s music went quiet and he looked up.  Steve was stepping into the workshop with his sketch bag over his shoulder and a pizza box in his hand.
—  upsets you, use your safeword.  I’ll never be upset or angry with you for safewording, okay?  Do—do you understand?”
Rebecca smirked at Tony and pinched him on the arm. “See? That’s what you get for hooking up with committed liberationists.” She looked over at Sam, her eyes brimming with affection and a certain sweet pride; Tony felt something depressingly like envy. The two of them were good together.
Tony palmed Steve’s balls, massaging and tugging a little, testing the response—Steve’s hips jerked again, to Tony’s delight. (Good to know.)
“It’s fine,” Steve said, starting to feel embarrassed now that the anger-adrenaline was fading.  He felt drained.  “I, uh, overreacted.”
“The fresh air will do you good!” Clint exclaimed. “Besides, all the reporters are busy now. Nobody’s gonna notice us going out for burgers.”
Hope you enjoyed the (long delayed) update.  I hope to have the next chapter up in not too long and I promise you some sexy time in chapter 16.  (Sort of.)
Tony hesitated. “I didn’t,” he admitted, shamefaced. “Steve had to help me see it; but now I do. I’m sorry.”
“Chill, it’s fine,” Tony said, scooping some of it onto his fork.  “Sorry my table manners aren’t up to old fashioned standards.”  He shoveled a bite into his mouth—
“Yeah, well, variety’s the spice of life,” Tony said, suddenly uneasy that Rogers must have guessed that Tony had decorated for him (like a good little sub).  Tony swallowed.  He threw his shoulders back, and added with a little smirk, “And as you may have heard, I’m a big fan of
, no visiting the workshop, and now no brunch?” Tony gestured. “No church either, by the looks of it.”
Pepper’s face tightened with hurt and frustration, that expression all too familiar.  She threw up her hands.  “Tony, five minutes ago you were excited to tell me all about it!  And--”
Steve propped up on one elbow to look at Tony.  His expression was curious and intent, but not distressed in the least.  (Good sign!)  Reassured, Tony continued.
“I--” Steve clenched his fist, then relaxed it and took a deep breath. “Jimmy Stevens froze.” Steve’s voice dropped to a whisper; there were tears shining in his eyes. “We thought he was sleeping.”
(Fuck, fuck, fuck.)  Tony faltered.  (It’s fine, he’s fine, everything’s cool.)  Tony swallowed heavily and cleared his throat.
Tony set his frame down very carefully, even though he knew the plastic covering wasn’t breakable, and then slid a narrow box over to Clint. Clint tore at the wrapping paper with glee, tossed the lid aside, and discarded the layers of tissue paper.
Steve pulled Tony’s long greatcoat from the hook and shook it out a little before holding it open and lowering it carefully to Tony’s height. Tony put his hands into the sleeves and Steve slid the coat up, then smoothed the fabric across Tony’s shoulders. Tony thought he might be near to blushing again. It was strangely intimate to let Steve help him into his coat. He’d had no idea—probably because he’d never let anyone do it before.
When Tony woke again, things were beeping and Pepper was sitting at his bedside still (or again). Her lipstick was a muted but somehow cheerful shade of pink, and she had changed into a crisp green sweater. She was doing something on her StarkTab when he opened his eyes.
“Shhhh,” Tony mumbled, rubbing his back.  “It’s okay. You have permission.  When you’re ready, okay?”
Tony used the facilities, checked himself over in the mirror (fabulous), and went to rejoin Steve. Steve: the last person in New York City who didn’t take out his smartphone when his date went to the bathroom. He just sat quietly, looking around the restaurant.
“We were just about to have a beer in the sun room,” Rhodes said. “You should join us. I’ll grab another--”
Would Tony actually say no to anything Steve wanted?  (Of course!  Well, probably.  Maybe.)  But if Tony thought it was a condition of being together?  Steve’s heart was pounding and his stomach dropped.  (
“The Avengers Initiative was designed to protect America.  And the world. Iron Man will do that. Everything else is secondary.”
Tony’s fingers were wonderful and relentless, caressing that spot over and over, making Steve jerk and shudder.  Steve’s balls felt tight and heavy, his whole body pulsing with anticipation.  He was so close . . .  (Am I supposed to ask?  Always?)  Another hard thrust-- he cried out.
“Certainly, sir,” the AI answered.  Steve had finally learned not to be startled by him (it?), but he still looked up at the ceiling every time, even though Tony had explained that JARVIS wasn’t actually in the ceiling.
Tony’s heart was speeding up even though it was just a story. Steve hung on his every word; his hand tightened posessively on Tony’s hip.
“No, no,” Tony cut him off. “I know you didn’t. Just, I figured you’d want to know. If you want to talk about Femme Doms and male subs as a group, we usually say ‘minority orientation,’ or ‘presented minority.’ Not a value judgment, just statistically more rare. Get it?”
“Of course, sir.”  Steve turned to the Avengers and added, “I’ll meet you at the car. Shouldn’t take long.”
Steve nodded. “Yes. That makes sense.” A pause. “Thank you. I, uh-- It’s still . . . disorienting. Here. Sometimes.” Steve swallowed and looked down at the city.
Ta-da!  Extra long chapter is extra long (and moderately speedy)!!!  I hope you like it.  Do please cheer me on / let me know your favorite bits if you have time and inclination.  :-)
Tony sighed and turned around. He started towards the table, then rerouted to the bar for two glasses of scotch.  (What?  It was 4:30-- practically happy hour.) He slid one glass down the table to Rogers who looked at it intensely, like he didn’t know what it was for.  Like it might be a test.
The event had started out as they all normally did. There was expensive jewelry that once belonged to a queen, a gold record signed and dated by a famous blues singer, and various other belongings of famous and important people. It wasn’t until the end when they released their biggest item of the day, that things got really interesting.
Tony was sleeping. The trip back had been a little too much for him; he had promptly passed out upon their return.  Steve freaked out of course, but Bruce had been there to reassure them; picking up Tony and looking him over enough to deem it was due to fatigue and residual power convergence from the stones. Whatever that meant. Steve just relieved that Tony would be fine after some rest.
“I can’t believe...I just—I thought I’d never see it again. I thought I’d never see any of these things again,” Steve said, in supposed awe of the many things dispersed in the room.
The words immediately brought a strong flush to his face, but the silence that ensued gave Steve courage to meet Tony’s eyes.
But, staying a couple more minutes couldn’t hurt. Plus, he needed the rest, and slowly he too found himself drifting off, joining Steve in his quiet slumber.
"I want you to draw me like one of your french girls." Tony had said, the very first time he had walked through his door.
“Ya, I’m gonna have to agree with Legolas over there, so you got anything else for us fake Cap?” He turned back to face Future Steve, quirking a brow to urge a response to his words.
Steve who had felt the same guilt that Clint was, didn't bother to convince him otherwise. Bruce had given it a shot, talking about how his family needed him, and not to worry, they would come back with Nat in tow, but Clint stayed put.
As he saw Steve walk in he was about to speak first—rip the bandage off as quickly as he could so to speak— but steve beat him to it.
The final member at the table sat beside Winter and had the odd stage name of Captain America. It was a name that only a man like him could pull off.  The man carried a presence that captivated the attention of everyone around him. He had an inane talent for inspiring people with the words he wrote as the main lyricist of the band. As the lead guitarist of the band he was probably the most popular (but honestly that could just be Tony’s bias speaking). Cap-as fans often called him-was the man of Tony’s dreams. Tony could tell from the songs that he wrote, that Cap was an earnest person, who laid his heart on his sleeve and was just so very good to the core. Tony hadn’t met many good people like that in his life and couldn’t help how drawn in he felt by Cap.
Steve starts leaning in, and Tony finds his brain short circuit. This is it, he’s about to kiss Captain America, his childhood hero, now teammate and maybe something more. Just before their lips touch, Steve pauses and whispers against his lips “Can I kiss you?” And Tony just closes eyes and nods against Steve’s lips, a hair’s width apart.
Natasha had then stepped up, walked past them and up to Loki. “What do you mean you’re from the future.”
"Yeah, and then Thanos brought him back to - ” Bruce started off nonchalantly, and then as if he had come to the same line of thought Steve had “ - no. You can't possibly - you think?"
Steve hadn’t realized he had a Sugar Daddy, until Bucky pointed it out to him. Although to be fair, Steve didn't think you could have a Sugar Daddy who was both younger than you and who received no sexual favours whatsoever in return.
Normally, Steve would never have accepted; he had heard enough stories from his fellow art colleagues to know about what really happens at private jobs for commissioned portraits, for him to ever consider doing one himself. But he'd been a little down on his luck in terms of jobs lately and with the looming threat of due rent, well it was all too easy to get him on board when the job also came with Natasha's vote of confidence for the select individual.
, started to enter him then. The slow burn giving way to both pleasure and pain. But fuck, if this wasn’t what Tony wanted. No, needed.  God, how he missed this. Just him, Steve, and this slow build up of sensations until eventual oblivion was reached.
At the end of the applause, Steve carefully spoke. “Thank you for the performance Tony, we’ll get in touch with you when we come to a decision.”
For so long he had operated on the basis of the next mission, the next life to save. The next, the next, the next.
Tony remembered watching TV and seeing his hero destroy Nazis and save the day. His father would sometimes see these occasions and briefly stop and stare at the screen, probably reminiscing about when they had worked together in the glory days. Tony wasn’t all too sure what he thought, but he always remembered the attention the Captain got from his father.
This was it, this was the moment that Tony knew he couldn’t go back. Steve would leave taking everything with him, and Tony would finally have to learn to cope without him.
“Surveillance did reveal an unauthorized man in standard SHIELD uniform at the scene.” Natasha confirmed for them.
Decided to add another chapter cause I felt guilty. But it's so shit I feel even worse for posting it. I'm having such trouble with tenses. Sigh.
Steve brought him into his arms, and that caused the dam to burst. He was sobbing now. It was as if all his feelings were just now being allowed to come out after holding them in for so long.
So much had happened since the Avengers first met on the quinjet. Many ecstatic victories and heartbreaking losses. And at the centre of it all was their relationship. The dynamic between Tony and Steve had always shaped the team, and nothing had ever felt right since his departure.
The words shot straight to Tony’s dick. Steve being filthy in bed wasn’t too rare a sight back then, but paired with the fucking rugged caveman look that had started this whole fucked up occurrence in the first place? Had Tony whimpering. He quickly made himself spread his legs, exposing his entrance before Steve could say anything more.
Thinking about how perfect Steve was, only seemed to further bring to his mind how inadequate he was in comparison.Yeah, his relationship was going well with Steve, but that didn’t mean that Steve shouldn’t have better.
Tony who was staring at the screen frozen with his mouth perfectly agape, while he blinked profusely. It had seemed he had finally broken Tony Stark.
“On a date.”  Steve confirmed, while looking Tony in the eyes and giving him a firm nod to further confirm his words.
Tony quickly got off Steve then, leaving a confused Steve in his wake, but it only took him a moment before he was back to sitting on top of Seve, having left to grab the lube from the bedside drawer.
“Ya and the guy also came ready to sing, if you wanted me to get started on that anytime soon, instead of asking pointless questions.” Tony drawled, the epitome of cockiness. That pulled at something in Steve. He was never good at listen to authority himself, but people seldom went up against them; Tony’s attitude was quite intriguing.
"It has come to my attention that my team has not been forthcoming about the Loki incident. Particularly concerning our certain man out of time." He looked at him then.
"Tony!" A shout was heard to the left of him and was his only warning before he found himself off his feet and engulfed in a bone crushing hug from Bruce - Hulk - BruceHulk?
He had stared dumbfounded at the picture the young man presented: wrapped in a fluffy white bathrobe, Tony had lounged on a black leather sofa, red wine glass in hand, while he twirled a familiar necklace in the other.
at Tony, like he was drinking him in; or the way they each left a hand on the table, so they could sometimes reach out to emphasize a point with a little pat or a squeeze or a subtle caress, eager to touch and relishing the newfound liberty but not quite willing to venture so far as to sit there
Steve gasped and gaped at him with shock. It didn't hurt--not much anyway, barely stinging. It was a weak blow, uncoordinated, softened by the bandages, but he hadn't expected--
“Wait,” Rogers said, looking more and more distressed, “wait, so . . . so, every time I did that, for
Though maybe it had been when Rhodey, yielding to Tony’s entreaties, had been passionately flailing his way through “Smooth Criminal.” (Again, fuzzy.) Rhodey really was a terrible dancer, but he
Pepper sighed heavily and added, “I used to think I could manage it, if I had the right co-parent, but that feels even more hopeless.”
“I apologize for him,” JARVIS said. “I’m afraid the older bots have a poor command of figurative speech, Captain Rogers.”
Steve felt something flutter in his chest, but he tried to tamp it down.  (He’s just curious.  He probably doesn’t even realize tomorrow is Christmas.)
“Bruce has some tests on a chemical compound running up in his lab,” Tony said.  “I’ll ask him what time they’ll be done; we’ll be free after that. Not sure about Steve’s or Natasha’s schedules.”
“Hey, man! You ready to head out?” Tony jumped when Clint tapped him on the shoulder. “Cause the others are all pooped out on all this swanky shit. You coming home with us or what?”
It was pleasantly crisp in the workshop—too much food or warmth made him sluggish.  Tony  tossed his suit jacket over a stool and grabbed a hoodie from the workbench.
“Stark Industries,” Tony said by way of explanation, with his mouth full.  “Excuse me.”  He hopped off the stool and padded into the next room.
Tony said to come and he hadn’t yet.  A wave of anxiety washed through him and his breathing sped.  (He told you to!  Go on!)  Steve shivered and felt a hot rush of humiliation.  (Obey.  You want to!)  Steve closed his eyes tight and strained, still panting, but he couldn’t, he wasn’t—
Tony stared at the papers on his workbench.  Somehow, Rogers had done it.  The entire “morality and public conduct” segment had been dropped. Every word of it.  Tony flipped through the document again, half expecting it to reappear as if by evil magic, hidden in another section.
“You’re the one who brought up the subject of sin,” Steve said, voice going a little harsh as he jerked his hand away. “You wanna talk about sin?
.” Natasha leaned down to kiss him on the cheek. She smelled of spruce and bergamot, something rich and spicy.
“My pleasure,” Steve said with a shrug, eyes still fixed on the horizon. A few late (likely illegal) fireworks went off, blossoming into brilliant reds and whites. Tony studied Steve’s face in the glass reflection, but couldn’t read it: sad, pensive, tired, he didn’t know, but he need to--
They went quiet as Tony filled the kettle and set it on the hot plate to rapid boil.  He grabbed one of his MIT mugs and rummaged in the back of the mini pantry for Pep’s favorite green tea with jasmine.
“S-so good for me, Steve,” Tony said softly, still shivering a little.  “So beautiful. . . I’ve got you . . . I’m right here.”
“No!” Tony swallowed. “I mean, uh, say, ‘thank you, but no need.’ Tell him I already ordered a pizza, so I’m all set, okay? Just working away.”
Tony rolled his shoulders, trying to ease the ache.  He really wasn’t supposed to sleep in the workshop.  Martina was going to yell at him—she was awful loud and bossy for a masseuse.  Weren’t they supposed to be zen and shit?  It was worth it though.  He’d been on a roll with new hardware for the StarkTab 5.  Nothing revolutionary, but smaller, lighter, with a longer battery life, all features in high demand that translated into a huge profit margin.  Not bad for, uh, how many hours in the lab?  Pep would be here soon and she’d be pleased.  Well, not about the lab marathon without proper sleep, but about the result.
“I’m not asking you to,” Tony said with muted exasperation. He took a deep breath and let it out in a sigh. “You said you heard the conversation. Did you know what Title III of the Submissives’ Protection Act is?”
Pepper sighed.  “Well let me look at it, but assuming everything’s in order, when do you sign and when do they move in?”
“Mr. Stark,” Rogers said, voice intense, perhaps a bit distressed. “If they’re making inappropriate demands, I'll report it.  I won’t let them just—”
Sorry no Steve in this chapter!  I promise he'll be in the next one! I was originally going to write a big long chapter with all of this, and Steve, and the media, but it was taking a long time and I didn't want to keep you waiting.  So, sorry no Steve, but, hey, no more cliff hanger, right?  :-)
“I’m afraid I’ll step on your feet. But—” He reached for Tony’s hand and gave Tony a hesitant smile.
since Tony’d been under properly, not since— (No. Stop. Don’t go there.)  Tony couldn’t tell if Bruce was flirting back or not, which was unusual, but it didn’t worry him. They hadn’t even known each other a week. The attraction could simmer at the corner of his mind, a pleasant back buzz to the challenge of building a mini-spectrometer.
as she helped Jarvis decorate the house herself. And she’d always taken Tony to midnight Mass over Howard’s objections about ‘that superstitious rubbish.’)
Clint’s face must have given something away because Steve growled—rage stamped on his face—“What the hell is the matter with you?  Don’t you think he’s been through enough without people—who’re supposed to be his friends—piling it on too? I had no idea where that crap was coming from, but trust me, whatever you said, he read between the lines and heard you loud and clear.  How could you?”
Tony blinked. He’d gotten plenty of red roses—no need to look that up, romantic love & passion, not that many of them had meant it—but never yellow roses. Friendship. Paired with red roses? Tony swallowed thickly.  It left him feeling more flustered than it should have.
“Don’t you want your concubine?” Tony asked in a sultry voice, leaning forward to look up at him through his eyelashes.
“What?” Tony asked, jerking his attention away from the Planck constant and wave vector diagram.  “Donuts? Oh. Right. Yeah.”  Tony blinked, shook his head.  “I mean, yeah. No. No. Just, coffee’s good.  Yeah.”
(So, improved evasive maneuvers and dummy targets to throw off their locking systems. And maybe an emergency reverse EMP to take them out on the ground?) Tony tapped thoughtfully at the arc reactor. (Or maybe--)
Of course, everyone had heard the news about Captain America and Tony Stark; SHIELD Agents were bigger gossips than his grandmother’s bridge club. (Maria Hill asked Jason Nowicki to add a note to their personnel files; Jason Nowicki told Jenny Shaefer who told Andrea Chen who told Martin Gaydos who told
“Duh. Obviously. Anyway, I think we’re gonna watch a few episodes tonight. You should come hang out. If you spend any more time meditating on your floor I’m gonna think it’s emo instead of Zen. So, yeah, come hang out.”
He was (sadly) too spent from his own wrenching orgasm and the reflected satisfaction of Steve’s to be ready for another round yet, but Steve’s body was an inspiring sight. (Maybe in the morning.)
“Go ahead, Tony,” Steve said. “I’ll go test out the suit while you talk to Jim. Tell him I said ‘hi.’”
“JARVIS?  Have Darla send him on up to the Captain suite.  Use the private elevator.  I’ll meet him there.”
Steve could practically feel Ms. Potts guard go back up (or up even more), but Steve pressed on, “I was wondering if there’s any news from Tony.”
Tony glanced down. He could feel the telltale tingling that meant he might blush, but it was just Rhodey so whatever. (Seriously, he’d spent most of college blushing at the man, so yeah. Whatever.)
Tony was primped, primed, and ready to go fifteen minutes early—he deserved a fucking medal. Or a scotch. Tony took the stairs from his private floor to the common area. (Maybe just a small glass before the limo…)
“Mmm.”  The silence lingered again.  Tony wouldn’t break first, even under Pep’s communication voodoo.
“Busy,” Johnny said, smiling. “It’s his first semester back since the girls arrived. Poor Jake’s finding it a hard adjustment, but he really loves teaching.”
I love Tony but seeing him on the red carpet with Captain America really makes him look . . . like, super old? I mean, still rad, but I hadn’t noticed how much older he looks.
“Tony?”  he whispered, short of breath.  His whole body was hot and tingling, his heart pounding.  “Please?  More.  I’m—”  Steve shuddered. “More?”
Steve hesitated. “No, no. We all love Park Chop Sui so let’s just-- Wait, will they be open on Christmas?”
Steve nodded. His mouth was dry as he tried to swallow around the damn lump in his throat. Now Tony had turned to look at him too. He wanted to disappear.
“Oh?  What are you making?”  Steve leaned forward to peer at the lines of code and graphs.  “Are you still working on the new arrows for Clint?”
Tony frowned. “It’s hard to say. We’re never getting a complete data pull and I haven’t been able to accelerate the intake process. Those things really need to stay open for 45 minutes to get a full read. And they never seem to.”
“There you are, dear,” Mrs. Rhodes said catching sight of Tony, “I was starting to wonder where you’d gotten to.”
that. Rethreading was the worst.” He hesitated. “You probably already checked this, but was top tension wound too tight?”
“It’s actually a pretty major deterrent,” Tony said. Of course, Rogers wasn’t wrong—fear of legal repercussions could only do so much. (And after damage’s been done . . . well.) Rogers looked ready to protest, so Tony held up his hand and conceded, “But I’m not saying to ignore harassment. If I’d overheard somebody talking like that asshole, I sure as shit would go over and check on things and offer assistance if necessary.” Rogers gave an approving nod. (A little too satisfied, actually.) Tony continued, “But I wouldn’t make a scene or assume the other person can’t handle it.”
Tony let out another rasp and she turned to the side table where there was a glass of water with a straw. She offered it to him and Tony drank greedily. He wasn’t thirsty, but his mouth and throat were parched raw.
Steve came into sight; Tony got to his feet with a nervous look and Rhodey turned a little on the couch. His face was a mess. Steve yanked the glass door open and rushed into the sunroom, his earlier train of thought entirely derailed.
wants or needs. . . )  Steve glanced over at the book.  He knew Tony had read it.  (Tony ‘affirms and reassures.’ That’s what a good Dom is supposed to do.)  Steve’s eyes were stinging.
“I was doing the reading you gave me and it just—“  Steve paused then started again.  “I was skimming through the later sections and it was all about how careful the, um,
“It is. So if you ask me about the Avengers, I can tell you about Hawkeye, Widow, Dr. Banner, and Iron Man.” The Captain smiles. “But the Avengers are also the dearest friends I’ve got here and that’s personal. Clint tries to teach me to play videogames and caught me up on comic book history. Natasha beats me at poker and Bruce beats me at chess. And Tony . . . ” Rogers trails off with a hint of a smile, staring at the floor.
“I think it’s safe to say, you’re a submissive or ‘sub.’  I’m your dominant or ‘dom.’  People call what we’ve been doing BDSM—which actually stands for six things: bondage, discipline, dominance, submission, sadism, and masochism.  At this point though, we’ve really only done the bondage, dominance and submission parts of that.  We may decide to explore discipline and sadomasochism, we may not. We can figure that out later, but this is all vocabulary that matters.”
Tony stroked his hands along Steve’s chest, and initiated another long glorious kiss. (He loved kissing Steve—the right amount of sweet and the right amount of dirty.)  Steve hummed with approval, but didn’t take control of their kiss. Or move things along in a more orgasm-producing direction.  (Hm.)  Tony pushed the kiss a little hotter and more urgent before pulling away.
“Give it a rest, Rhodes!” Tony cried in exasperation, throwing his hands in the air. “Cap’s been great. And I can take care of myself, you know. If he’d taken a step out of line, I’d have let him have it. And I sure as shit wouldn’t cover for him afterwards!”
Tony downed the rest of his coffee, but it sat uneasily in his stomach. Suddenly, discrete lines of data were shifting and sliding: what if rather than coincidence or correlation, there was
Steve went back to the living room and settled in the chair nearest the hallway. It was unlikely he'd be needed again--really he should go to bed, but he doubted he could sleep. So he sat with his notebook.
When he turned to offer Clint a plate of food, Bruce’s grin was so wide it looked nearly giddy. Tony was startled to realize how touching he found it—that Bruce could be so enthusiastically, truly happy for Tony’s romance, even when he was hurting over Betty. He gave Bruce the plate instead.
Steve said it so earnestly that Tony wondered if he could lie. (Well, clearly, he could, but somehow Tony found it hard to imagine Steve lying to
“Got it. It’s running Hypothetical 36. Do you think we can just add a patch to the current devices to close it?”
Tony pressed at his entrance with slightly more pressure.  Steve held his breath, but then Tony was pulling away again, barely touching him.
“Look, I never actually put a bet in!” Jerry stammered. “Or gave it a try! I’m a happily married man! And it was all Dominick’s idea! He started the whole thing!”
century and even now all the lights felt just a little too bright, the corridors just a little too narrow.  The open floor plan at Stark Tower had been an immediate relief, even if the furniture had felt too cold and the size of it somehow wasteful.
Tony hesitated. Normally he hated the fuzzy feeling of morphine or whatever the hell it was, but he hurt so badly and the drugs made him sleepy and sleep would mean . . . not thinking. It felt like weakness, but he nodded.
“Johnny,” Tony said with a tense smile, trying hard to set aside his anger. “I mean, Agent Ishida.  I didn’t realize you would be at this meeting.”
“Sure,” Bruce said politely as the agent turned to some sort of phone mounted on the wall.  A phone with a cord.  Tony rolled his eyes.
After a few long moments, Tony glanced up from under his lashes. A hint of a smile was playing at the corners of Steve’s mouth. Tony looked down again.
“Having fun?” Pepper asked, her smile a little bemused and rapidly trending towards a frown as she looked at him.
He’d pictured how it might be. Maybe Stark would have JARVIS call him—“Captain? You’re needed in the kitchen.”—but when he'd get there it would just be Stark--Tony?--grinning his cocky grin, with a giant pizza. "Hey, you said you don't hate pizza!" And they’d eat pizza and maybe watch the next of those “Back to the Future” pictures while Stark did something incomprehensible with his tablet. And it would be nice. They wouldn't fight. (And maybe later they—)
“Yep! That was the idea,” Tony said, not quite with the tone of a grand announcement he’d been aiming for. But, then, Steve wasn’t exactly showing the rapturous delight Tony’d imagined for this moment.
Steve’s fingers carded roughly through Tony’s hair and caressed the back of his neck, stroking the sensitive spot behind his ears.
Tony simultaneously loved and hated seeing Steve so nervous. He hated that it was detracting from a happy moment for Steve, that he felt stress on their date, that this wasn’t just like a happy hotdog run. But (selfishly) Tony loved it too: loved that Steve cared that much about their date going well (cared that much about him); loved seeing little Steve Rogers in black and white under all the glamorous muscles. Besides, this way he could be the one to calm Steve’s nerves (instead of being distracted by his own).
“Dr. Banner,” Fury said with a polite nod to Bruce.  “I didn’t realize you and Stark were planning to leave.”
“Oh, okay. Good, good.” Tony hesitated. “But if you wanted it remodeled, you know with chrome and granite, something more like this, we could do it.”
“I mean, I’m pretty sure people still give flowers in the twenty-first century, right?” Steve said it jokingly, but there was an underlying ripple of uncertainty as he stood holding out the flowers.
,” Tony sneered.  “Let me guess, you’re still single ‘cause subs only like assholes?”  Tony snorted.  “Bored already.  Bye!”
“Come here,” Tony murmured, pulling Steve down so they were partially propped up by the pillows at the headboard.  Tony reached out to pour a glass of something thick and sweet-smelling.
Steve blinked.  (And, yep, there it was, right on cue—the “I’m remembering that and will look it up later” face.  Tony kinda loved that face.)
Steve grabbed Tony’s hand and pressed it to his head again.  He sucked *hard,* moaning and fucking his hand.  Tony clenched his fist in Steve’s hair and shoved him down on his cock and --
--want me to.  It’s not because I’m weak.  I never was weak—I mean, physically sure, but not . . . not
“Steve, up... fuck, get up here.” He made grabby hands towards Steve, and getting the hint, Steve sat up, kissing him again as they fucked.
It was then that Steve heard the doors to the elevator opening and sprung to his feet in anticipation with the team right behind him.
Up front was the uniform that Captain America wore when he went on his first ever heroic mission to rescue Sergeant James Barnes. At least, that’s what the auctioneer told the crowd.
"Yes, well, I believe it’s worth a shot.” Steve stated. But then he looked at the flicker of doubt that had come across Bruce’s face, Steve leaned over the table and placed a hand on Bruce’s arm. “We owe it to them to try, Bruce."
He had woken shortly after he had learned of Steve’s departure, along with the others to go and defeat Thanos.
Tony himself was shocked at first, but when he felt Steve’s lips pressed up against his he couldn’t help but melt into it. The feel of Steve’s warm hand as it slid from his waist to the small of his back had Tony in a slight shiver and a small gasp at his mouth. Steve used the opening to further deepen the kiss with a brief touch from his tongue. When Tony gave a moan in response, Steve finally pulled back.
He feels, rather then sees the moment where Steve gives a little jerk as if to stop himself from sudden movement. But Steve starts reaching out anyway, and now Tony definitely sees Steve as his hand lightly cups the side of Tony’s face, with his fingers curling into the back of Tony’s hair. His heart is thumping rapid fast; he wouldn’t be surprised if Steve could hear it with how loud it sounds in Tony’s ears.
For as long as he could remember, Tony’s life had always involved Captain America, small in some ways and big in others. As a child, it was easy to latch on to the Captain. He was a popular hero, and all the children had been in awe of him.
Tony broke off their kiss again, pulling Steve’s head into his neck, “Steve, please... your beard, I need -” Somehow Steve managed to understand Tony’s intent, and he shoved his bearded face into Tony’s neck.
Tony yanked Steve’s head down and kissed him as deeply as he could. Steve stood there dumbstruck, taking all of Tony’s ferocity as he kissed him senseless.
“Er, well... no. I mean he did start it—it was only a couple items at first, but then he stopped and I was, well, pretty fascinated by you when I was younger, so I just kinda, took over?” He gave Steve the short version, and Steve seemed to realize it too.
"-ngers, yeah. Their lead singer Sharon Carter just dropped out. Apparently her and Cap had a huge falling out and she quit the band. Needless to say, they're pretty screwed at the moment. So they're holding auditions for a replacement."
But he’d been so focused on his drawings and the man behind them that he’d miss the fact that when they stopped to eat, it was Tony who ordered and paid for the take out, or that when he offered to whip up a quick meal, it was Tony who had bought and stocked the ingredients beforehand.
Time Travel was tricky, but as Bruce had explained to him after his discussion with the Ancient One, he had to make sure that the stones did not leave the timeline for more than a split second. He had already returned the time stone to the Ancient One at the exact moment Bruce had left with it, but had to re-time his return of the mind stone to the moment Scott had left.
They both panted as they came down from their high. Steve slowly rubbed his face into the side of Tony's neck, causing his beard to once again scratch at Tony’s skin. Tony felt his dick give a half hearted twitch before settling down again, but Steve had felt the movement and he raised his head to look at Tony in wonderment.
Essentially it all came down to his guilt. He had told Tony that when they fought they'd fight together and he hadn't kept that promise.
"I'm sorry, but I can not help you. It's a matter of impartiality. We have a code to uphold." Strange, or Dr. Strange as the man introduced himself as, said to them after Bruce's explanation.
Tony had been too furious and fucking turned on to even pay attention to whatever in the hell Steve had been trying to tell him. The fact that he was turned on made him more furious, and a furious Tony was a horny Tony. It was a never ending hell.
ugh I really hate how I ended the chapter and I wanted it to be longer, but It was driving me crazy so I just had to post it. Sorry. Hopefully it's ok enough. I'll definitely come back and fix some stuff up at some point.
Finally,  Nat opened her mouth and said, "Well not all at once boys." The dam broke, and all at once they were rushing up to go and hug her.
And Steve now knew that Tony hadn’t moved on either. The proof was in way Tony had looked at him when he finally had managed to pluck the courage to go visit him. It was in the way that Tony had ripped his heart out and given it to him after calling him out on not being there for him. It was in the way Tony had admitted he’d missed Steve, hiding his true feelings in the plain sight of his witty comments.
“Ya Cap, it was a minor malfunction. Damn son of a bitch messed with my arc reactor.” Stark took a swig from his glass, frustration evident as he palmed his chest and continued, “I don’t know how- yet, but it looks like it was diversion tactic for Loki to get the Tesseract.”
Stark himself also seemed to been taken aback by this, as he halted and blinked back at Future Steve.
And that was how they spent the rest of the evening. Going through all the items Tony had obtained throughout the years, while Steve shared his memories of them from before the ice.
He looked to Tony then, eyes trailing over the sleeping man’s form.  Steve’s heart broke at the fragile sight the man presented. Ever so tentatively, Steve reached out and grasped Tony’s hand, holding it in his own. He couldn’t erase the past, and he wouldn’t even if he could; it brought him here to this point in time where he now fully understood this man and how far he could go for the people he cared about.
“Let’s get back,” Steve smiles, “ I can’t have you staying out so late on the first date.” He gives a wink and tentatively grabs Tony’s hand again, while he starts to walk them back to the Tower.
"Fuck your code." Bruce clenched his fists as he spoke. "Natasha and Tony sacrificed their lives for us, if there's a chance that they can be saved, we owe it to them to try." Echoing the words Steve had said earlier.
It was a deep kiss. Steve had one hand entwined into Tony’s hair tilting his head, while the other was curved around his waist, holding him close.
“Tony, I didn’t really mean an actual... you know. That would imply I’ve been... and we both know that hasn’t been happening. It was just something Bucky mentioned the other day, and well, it got me realizing. Why do you spend so much on me? You buy me all these things, you fix the things I won’t let you buy, and you just spend so much of your time that I know cost so much... on me. Why?”
He had grown to rather like Tony. He was a bit odd at times, reacting rather peculiarly whenever Steve complimented him on his features, like the strength evident in his hands or the unique shade of his eyes. Steve just figured he had heard them all too much and was too tired of saying his gratitude. But he was fun company. He made Steve laugh an awful lot and was always teaching him new and interesting things.
Something white then caught the corner of his eye, as it rolled off the table. Tony tried to reach for it but Steve’s quick reflexes allowed him to catch the ball just before it hit the floor.
Clint and Nat were crying now, and Steve stepped up to intervene. "Save some tears for the rest of us."
Sitting at the left end of the table facing the stage was the drummer of the band who was known as Hawkeye. He was notorious for doing tricks with his drumsticks and throwing them with scarily good precision at fans who were being terrible. Despite the antics he had quite the following as he played both the drums and electric keyboard beautifully even while needing hearing aids for being nearly deaf in both ears. Tony felt a strange kinship towards him and couldn’t quite help but like him.
Maybe that's why he was still here. There was still a Tony Stark in this universe and by god if he had been given a second chance to do right by him, he was going to give it his all.
They had formed two teams for the infinity stone retrieval. Bruce and the Doctor were being sent back to 2012, to ask the Ancient One for the time stone - again. Steve did not envy them in their task.
Now, Tony wasn’t the sort to blush or find embarrassment in the things that he enjoyed, but this had him blushing a little. Tony averted his eyes, looking upwards in clear avoidance of Steve’s curious gaze.
"Ya fine, maybe it's not about me being busy, but that still doesn't change the fact that I'm male and they're probably looking for someone that is not."
"Okay, what!? Sharon and Cap had a falling out?" That was news to him. "When did that happen?" Last Tony heard—according to the fan pages that he definitely did not follow—those two were still cozing it up on the daily.
"I'm not saying anything definitive but it could be a prospect, yes. But you would need both the time and reality stone for it to even remotely have a chance of working. Reversing time on small objects is a lot simpler than reversing death, the reality stone would be needed as a stabilizing agent..." He broke off then, seemed to realize - probably at the huge smile on Bruce's face - that he had pretty much confirmed he would be willing to give it a try.
But this? This was something that he never would have expected. I mean, sure, he’s thought about what it would be like, being with Steve. He’s a handsome guy, okay an insanely hot, sculpted, breathtakingly handsome guy, so you can’t really blame him for thinking about what it would be like having a go at him, sometimes. Okay a lot. But that’s as far as he’s ever gone with entertaining thoughts about Steve. Because, really? Steve liking him as a person and wanting to have a relationship with him?  Yeah, does not compute. Error. Mission abort.
Steve turned to look then, and was astonished to see Strange and Natasha floating up to join them. They landed, and all was silent for a few seconds. Steve found himself frozen in place. This is what they had come here for, but a little part of him had believed that maybe it was all just wishful thinking on his part.
He had just finished returning three of the infinity stones to their correct timelines, leaving only the mind and space stones. He appeared in the alley in New York at the exact moment Scott had left the timeline with the mind stone.
Tony knew that he should take this opportunity to get up and leave, after all he had gotten it out of his system, right? And either way, Steve was no good for him, there was no point in him prolonging their inevitable ruin.
It was at this particular charity function that Howard (and then later on Tony) developed a real interest in the collection.
He was shocked to see himself seated in the same position that Strange had just helped him up from. He took a step back to analyze the scene. All around him were the Avengers that he had fought with, surrounding a replica of himself in a slumped state. His comrades were all frozen, as if time had stopped for everyone except Tony and the ones who had rescued him.
It had shown up on his doorstep via delivery man in all its sleek metal grey glory, looking like it had come to life straight from Steve’s fantasies.
Though they got along swimmingly, they didn't have much in common so Steve could find no further excuse as to how he could continue further interaction with Tony.
Natasha seemed to not show any emotion as she calmly replied "It's my job Stark." But Steve knew that the comment had affected her.
“Yes!” Tony replied as he scrambled up from his seat and quickly got up the stage, proceeding towards the mike.
He ran his hand over one of the tables in the room—a wooden one, that had a rickety leg--he said he remembered it from way back when he and Buck used to eat on it in their younger days. Apparently Bucky had always complained about it and said that they should fix it, but they never quite got around to it.
“Tony, I—I’ve loved you for a while now, I can’t believe all this time you’ve felt the same way. This is just—”  Steve didn’t get to finish because Tony was pulling back and cutting him off.
"Yes, Tony, it's me. Try not to get sappy on me now, we'll explain later. First, we need to get you back home." She nodded over at Strange then, and gave him some sort of indication that Tony was too tired to properly pay notice to. All he knew was that at one moment he was standing in the middle of a frozen battlefield, and in the next he was gone.
Tony strode away and this time Harris let him.  Tony just wanted to get this fucking meeting over with.  SHIELD was like a warren.  Or a labyrinth.  (The bad kind, with no David Bowie.)  Tony checked the map on his phone.  (Hm.) The break room, but more importantly
She blinked at him, still surprised. (Had she really thought the ‘ooh, we’re both minorities and I’m so discreet’ was gonna have him eating out of her hand?)
Tony shook a slice of pizza at Steve— “And, no, just no!  You could seriously crush Batman with your pinkie, so don’t even start!”
Tony pushed and pulled Steve’s head up and down on his cock.  (Amazing.  Beautiful.)  Steve’s body rocked gently as Tony moved.  Tony dragged his eyes from Steve’s mouth around him and looked lower.   The sight was nearly enough to send him off then and there—Steve had a fist curled around his dick, pulling and stroking as Tony moved his head.
Then Steve was standing, holding Tony in his arms and kissing him, mouth still heavy with the taste of his seed.
“Sure, Cap!” Tony didn’t bother turning around, just kept his eyes on the circuits spread out on the table. He was tinkering again, a much-needed break from Bob. He’d been working away—come up with three more hypotheticals and started tinkering on a containment device that would attempt reverse polarity if—(Shit.)
Thanks everyone for your kind words and well-wishing!  I had my big interview yesterday and I think it went extremely well.  If they don't offer me the job, it won't be because I was poorly prepared or gave a bad interview.  It's out of my hands now, but I feel like I did my best.  So that's a good feeling!
(Of course, technically, as the first and only Agent Tony’d ever subbed for—before Dom started the damn bet—Agent Ishida could have claimed the glorious title years ago. But because he was a fucking class act he’d never said a word.)
In the comfort of his own luxurious bathroom, the water was hot and wonderful, but the wait gave Tony time to get nervous. His first impulse was to call Pepper. Which was ridiculous because there was nothing to be nervous about. (And it was two in the morning.) And what would he say? ‘Making new friends is scary’? What is he, a kindergartener? Tony rolled his eyes. He gave one last vigorous scrub and reached for his towel.
“Oh,” Rogers didn’t do anything so undignified as ‘slump,’ but his shoulders dipped slightly and his face fell.  He frowned at his shoes, then looked up at Tony again, “In that case, I guess, never mind.”
Steve watched as Tony’s delighted grin slid slowly from his face, turning more melancholy by the moment. (He loves her. Of course he still loves her.)
“Hey! Just because I’ve been letting Bruce and Cap feed me lately doesn’t mean I’ve forgotten how to call for delivery myself. Sheesh.” Tony rolled his eyes. “So, speaking of, breakfast burrito, stat.”
“What!? No!” Tony cried. “You’re kidding me with this shit, right? How often are the three of us actually together?”
.  Then he gave Tony a mischievous little smile, full of erotic promise.  Tony faltered.  (Er, not like that.)  “Because I wanted to talk with you.  In private.”
“Yeah, sure.”  Tony opened his mouth—(you’re always welcome)--  and said, “Yes.  Yes, of course.  Um, pajamas?”
“Excuse me?” A plump, attractive, and very Italian looking woman in her late forties approached, wearing the white apron of a chef.  “Please forgive the interruption. I, uh--- How is everything this evening?”
Steve felt a swirling sense of arousal, abandon, and something like embarrassment or even shame but it was a heady rush and he wanted more of it.  (All yours . . . for you, Tony . . . you’re in charge . . . yeah, make me beg . . . )
Tony snorted.  “Hey, JARVIS?” Tony called, walking to the elevator.  “When did Banner become the new Pepper?”
“I’d say that’s understandable,” she said with a shrug, then added matter-of-factly, “He wants to impress you.”
“JARVIS?” Tony called softly. “Would you keep playing that last episode on loop, volume on low until he wakes up?”
Tony held his hand up and examined it for a moment, then shrugged saying, “Hand, gauntlet, whatever.”
“How’ve you been?” Tony asked, smile growing more real with every moment.  (He’d always liked Johnny…)
. Please. There is nowhere I’d rather be right now.” Tony gave him a tentative smile. “You’re my friend.”
Tony curled against Steve’s legs and glanced surreptitiously around the room.  His teammates were all focused on Gandalf’s battle with the Balrog, but as he looked up Bruce glanced over and smiled warmly at him.  Only Pepper had a slight furrow at her brow--she raised an eyebrow when he caught her eye.  Tony grinned and gave her a little thumbs up; she smiled and turned her attention to the screen.
She said it as though sandwiches were one of the great mysteries of the universe. Tony shrugged. “He has a thing for feeding people. Who do you
“Was it just the accumulation that was too much?” Tony asked. “Or did I touch on a specific trigger?  Or was it something else?”
Cap got the door and gestured them all through. Clint took the lead, Bruce and Natasha trailing slightly behind him talking quietly. Rogers was giving Tony an uncertain look—his eyes flicked to the door, then back to Tony.
(Maybe he should ask Bruce to cross check the diffusion spikes with nearby storm patterns. Maybe lightning would--)
Rhodey sighed again and took a sip of his beer, straight from the bottle.  “I was on a mission—and, no, I won’t tell you about it—and they had rocket launchers.  A lot of them.”  Rhodey’s face went tight.  “They managed to take out my ground support.  At least temporarily, so I didn’t have anyone to cover me.  There were too many missiles all at once and I got hit.  Put half the repulsors out of commission and then, well—”  Rhodey gave a grim smile.  “--I fell.”

Tony raised his eyebrow, and Steve admitted with a sheepish look, “Is it weird I’m already angry about what I think they’ll say about you?”
My infinite gratitude to thatwhichyields, Mary, pandowl, shards-of-divinity, and lilragekitten for EPIC beta reading and cheer leading!!!!!!
It began by reprinting Shakespeare’s Sonnet 57: “Being your slave, what should I do but tend / Upon the hours and times of your desire? . . .”  Steve smiled and continued as the author asserted with confident eloquence that: BDSM is not an illness; it is not cruel; it is not abusive.  (Yes!) Danger comes from misinformation and misrepresentation.  Wiseman wrote, “Another purpose of this book is to ease the terrible pain and isolation SM people often feel.”  Steve swallowed thickly and continued.  He read:
Steve nodded in acknowledgement. “By our fight.” He sighed again.  “But now that you’ve had some time to think, can’t you see that what you did was wrong?”
Tony rolled his eyes.  When the elevator doors opened, the common area was pungent with spices. Cool.  Bruce knew he liked curry.  Tony turned the corner and froze.
“I’d just ask JARVIS to keep an eye out. So I could avoid you,” Tony said. He gave a vicious smile. “JARVIS is always watching you for me.”
(Of course, they came down when he’d presented; Cap was supposed to be his role model, not his pin-up fantasy.)
Tony spat out the screwdriver and frowned as it rolled off the workbench with a clatter.    “Smartass,” Tony muttered.  He heard the line connect and called out, “Sugar pie, honeybunch!” as he crawled under the bench for his screwdriver.
Steve raised his head to look at Tony, trying to focus on him, on this moment, things that made Tony
“I’d mind.” Steve shook his head. “I’m not gonna ask someone on a date if I don’t mean it. And I couldn’t actually— I mean, I’m not --“ Steve looked away again.
Steve smiled. He shrugged out of his robe and settled under the covers; he opened his arms and Tony curled up beside him, head on his massive chest.
“Nope, I’m good,” Tony said, then, “Hey, what are you doing bringing people tea? Aren’t you supposed to be roasting a turkey?”
, Black Widow and I have been training in the gym you designed.  It’s been wonderful, but I think it’s high time to get us all together in one place to train and talk about what we bring to the team.”
Rogers looked up at him from under his lashes and Tony was quick to deflect, “Though I doubt your poor StarkTab would agree. It’s not the tablet’s fault there’s crap on the internet.” Tony joked, “Don’t shoot the messenger, man!”
Thanks for sticking around while I dealt with all the madness in RL.  It's great to be back to writing at last!  Hope you like it. :)
And, it's been a while (like, years) since chapter 51, but when Fury takes Tony aside to make sure that Steve and his relationship is above board and he's not being coerced, Tony says:  “Fuck you and your concern,” Tony growled. “Where was your concern when—“ He snapped his mouth shut, nearly vibrating with outrage. “Tend your own goddamn house, Fury.”  :).     Also, this out-take: https://archiveofourown.org/works/8450386 .
“Tony, look!” Bruce cried. Tony looked at the readouts. All the energy levels were dropping. The portal started flickering.
The Captain stepped out of the elevator and glanced around the apartment curiously, eyes bright.  Rogers’ dockers and plaid were horrible, but he wore them beautifully.  (
The creature now standing in Central Park immediately below Bob looked like a giant spider. It was roughly six feet tall, with four legs on the ground, four in the air, and a segmented body. Its exoskeleton was dark blue. It had four luminous grey eyes and a pair of huge black fangs. It bobbed and spun in a circle, seemingly taking them in.
“That’s true,” Pepper said, giving him her encouraging smile.  (She tactfully doesn’t remind him he’s refused to set foot in The Pierre for years.)
Steve’s sincerity left Tony feeling flat footed and it was too early for bantering comebacks, so Tony just mumbled: “You’re too good to me.”
“Just so you know, I won’t be pulling my punches,” Tony said, doing his warm-up stretches in the training room. “I’m not afraid to hit an old man.”
Tony sucked in a sharp breath.  (Shit.  Rhodey really could have-- )  Tony scowled and bit his lip in concentration. (So, improved evasive maneuvers and dummy targets to throw off their locking systems. And maybe an emergency reverse EMP to take them out on the ground?)  Tony tapped thoughtfully at the arc reactor.  (Or maybe--)
“No, no.  I mean, there’s always stuff to do, right?  But it doesn’t have to be right now.  So shoot, babe.”
“Should have done that sooner,” Clint said. “Then you wouldn’t have missed Cap.” He threw another paper ball at Tony’s face; his reflexes were still too slow to dodge it. It hit him on the nose.

Steve shook his head, lips twisting a little ruefully as he said, “See, I’ve been wrong before, especially in this century, so I just wanted to make sure that this—
“Mmm,” Tony murmured with a leer and said in a sultry voice, “You can hold me captive any time, darling. Especially if you chain me to your bed.”
Tony was looking at Steve with increasing horror, but having spoken without thinking a moment ago, he was especially anxious to find the right words now.
“Nice work, Avengers!” Steve called as they finished the training module. Steve looked up and added, “And thank you for your assistance with the holograms, JARVIS.”
“Sure.  Well, mostly the Air Force.  I mean, if the only time they let me off to come visit you is when my suit’s shot to hell, what kind of message are they sending me?”
“Threatening people isn’t funny,” Steve insisted.  “Besides, why are you getting a shovel talk? They’re *our* friends.  So I should get it too.”

(It had to be true. Tyrone was leaving his empire to his daughter.) There had been some scuttlebutt about him pushing his eldest child—the son, the Dom—out for his daughter, but Tony’d never taken it seriously. Dynastic families were so traditional.
After what seemed like ages, Tony dragged his fingernails down Steve’s back with one hand and finally
“Hey, Cap?” he said softly. “What’s up? I mean, we got there in record time, nobody was even injured, and we helped the Eewoo get home. So, victory, right?”
holding a grudge against JARVIS for his epic cockblocking.) In his weaker moments, he considered begging for it--something nice to distract from all the shit--but it felt wrong. Steve was well aware of Tony's desire in that area, so Tony just had to accept that Steve wasn't ready and he couldn't (or at least
This chapter was a real struggle and it went through about six drafts which I gutted, scrapped, glued back together, then gutted again.  I really hope you enjoy the results!  *looks nervous*  Yeah.  So, if you liked this or if there were any bits you especially enjoyed and you wanted to take a moment to let me know, I’d really love to hear it!
Tony ate his chicken Parmesan, surprised to find he had such an appetite.  It really was delicious.  He shouldn’t be so surprised—Steve made lots of good food—but he was anyway; it wasn’t exactly an Irish boy meat-and-potatoes dish.
“So, Dr. Banner,” Agent Dominick said, turning to Bruce. “Why don’t you start by telling us what your team has come up with?”
(Okay, fine, eavesdropped on. It had been overhearing at first, but around the sixty second mark, let's face it, you're not
Tony’s landing and entrance went smoothly and spider free—a faint glimmer of luck in the shit storm.
