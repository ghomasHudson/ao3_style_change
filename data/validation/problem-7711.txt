“I – are you sure?” Tony asked in a voice so desperate it made Steve want to cry – or go back in time and kill Howard Stark.
“Do you want to talk about it?”  Tony shifted off him, twisting on the bed until he was kneeling beside Steve at his hip, able to reach out and stroke Steve’s chest – which he did.
It had been a clusterfuck of a mission, which meant Tony knew exactly where to find Steve.
“It wasn’t an argument, it was a conversation,” Tony argued.  “Does it count if it’s accidental?”
Steve shuddered.  “Yeah, okay.  That’s – that sounds good.”  He nudged Tony onto his back, a hand sliding down between the brunet’s legs.  He was completely shocked to discovered Tony was already slick and partially worked open.  “What—”
“Do it.  Fill me up, baby.”
“Sensitive about it?”
In answer, Tony latched his ankles around Steve’s hips and pulled.  They both groaned as Steve’s cock pushed in – but Tony didn’t wait.  He tightened his thighs, forcing them closer together and panting.  Steve could take a hint, and leaned in until he was fully seated inside Tony.  “More,” Tony breathed, his hands scrabbling at Steve’s back.  “Fast and hard, baby, please.”
“I’m sorry.”  Tony would have pulled away, but Steve was holding him too tightly for that.  “I shouldn’t have asked you to come—”
Tony pushed Steve into an elevator, and then down the hall to the captain’s quarters.  Steve’s passivity concerned him a little, but he let it ride for now.  Once inside Steve’s room, Tony urged him to strip out of his uniform.  “Goddamn, you’re a thing of beauty,” Tony whistled, watching skin bared.  “I could eat you up.”
The first time Steve had called him that, it had bothered Tony.  It didn’t anymore.  He felt a warm glow of pleasure instead, and repaid it by dragging his tongue in a circle around the head of Steve’s cock before taking it into his mouth – just the head, for now.  He closed his lips around it and sucked, reveling in Steve’s choked off groan.  God, he loved giving head – loved rendering his lovers inarticulate more, and Steve was the most responsive lover he ever remembered having.  Buoyed by the noises coming from the blond, Tony shifted again to loosen his throat, ready to attempt deep-throating tonight.  It wasn’t an everyday thing, not with a cock the size of Steve’s… but this was supposed to be therapeutic sex, right?  That should be cause for some special effort.
Steve’s arms tightened around him.  “I’m not gonna leave you to do ‘em alone, doll.”  He kissed the top of Tony’s head.  “I’ll learn, or not – but I’d rather be with you than sittin’ at home thinkin’ about all those ladies hangin’ off you.”
“Holy shit,” Tony breathed.  “That was – Jesus, Steve, I didn’t know you had that in you.”
They remained there, panting.
“You’re allowed.”  Tony’s hand came up to stroke through Steve’s hair.  “Do you want me to go?”
It felt different to run his hands over Tony’s body now – fresh, and almost sacred.  He bent his head to Tony’s chest, pausing when he felt the engineer’s breath catch.  “Is this okay, doll?”
Steve raised an eyebrow.  “About two male lovers running the most powerful team in the world?”  He squeezed Tony’s hand.  “I can get on the horn to the Howlies that are left – they can attest to the fact that it doesn’t hurt a team.”
“No, I don’t.”  Bruce cut him off.  “But I had to be sure.”
“I’m a scarred up old man with a night light embedded in his sternum,” Tony protested mildly.  “You’re the beautiful one here, baby.”
Knowing that he’d fucked up so monumentally as to let his two oldest friends find out about his relationship with Steve via media blitz rather than from himself… that was a lot harder to deal with.  And it was definitely ruining the afterglow from what had been a pretty nice after-date sex romp.
In answer, he wrapped his arms around Tony’s waist and pulled his close.  He wished he had the energy to kiss him, but all Steve wanted to do was rest his head against Tony’s chest, right next to the arc reactor.
He was close – and he obliged his lover, blue eyes meeting brown and holding.  The prolonged eye contact was as intimate as their lovemaking – more so, at times – and it was just what Steve needed to send him over the edge.  He pumped Tony’s cock in his hand, hoping to bring him to completion as well – hoping, and succeeding.  Tony spilled between them, pulsing in long ribbons as Steve emptied himself into his lover, gasping.
Reaching out to stroke Tony’s chest, Steve raised an eyebrow.  “Yeah?”  It didn’t surprise him that Tony needed rules – or bother him.  “And what were the old ones, doll?”
Steve carried him straight to the bathroom and started peeling them both out of sweaty, dusty clothes.  “She makes sense.”  He turned on the water.  “Bath or shower, sweetheart?”
“Oh, please.”  She rolled her eyes.  “Pet names and public affection aren’t you, Tony.  What’s the game here, what’s your angle?”
Steve shifted, tugging him closer.  “Yeah, sweetheart.  And no, I’m not asking you to tell me.  Rule two is great, but some things need time.”
"Oh, hell."  Tony's head dropped forward.  "God, yes."
Rhodey’s lips pursed as he watched them.  “There is exactly one person on this planet that I would commit treason for – and you’ve got your arm wrapped around him.”  Tony started to protest, and Rhodey shook his head.  “Don’t argue with me right now, Tones.  Steve – can I call you Steve?”  Steve nodded.  “That man is the brother my mama didn’t give me.  I have loved his stubborn, frustrating ass since he was a pimply fourteen-year-old MIT freshman.  I haven’t always liked him,” he added drily, “but I’ve always loved him.”
Eventually, Steve pulled away.  “Shower,” he decided, getting to his feet and looking for their clothes.
"God, that was so lame, Rogers."  It might have sounded more like an insult if Tony hadn't been breathless and grinding back on Steve's fingers.  "Okay, lubed up, come on.  Opening act is over, I need the main event."
Steve pulled away and offered Tony his hand.  “C’mon, then.”
Steve tugged his hands free and rose to pace.  “Can you just… not.”  He rubbed at his face.  “I can’t pretend anymore, Tony.”
“Yeah, we shredded those.”  Steve leaned forward to kiss him.  “What do you have in mind for new ones, then?”
A second finger joined the first, making Tony groan.  Steve took his time opening him up – steady pressure with his fingers combined with one spectacular blow-job.  Tony was nearly as hard now as he’d been when they’d started.  “You ready?” Steve asked, pulling his lips off Tony’s cock and looking up at him.
Obligingly, Steve bit down, enjoying the way Tony bucked against him.  He shifted carefully, hovering above Tony to reach the other nipple without putting pressure on the arc reactor.  “You’re so beautiful,” Steve breathed.
“I’d really rather not,” Steve laughed.  He slid his hands to the waistband of Tony’s pants, gently teasing.  “But if you’re very good…” he let his voice drop to the low register that he knew drove Tony slightly insane, “I’ll fuck something else.”
“Fuck, yes.”  Steve crowded against him, rubbing his cock along the inside of Tony’s thighs, teasing him.  He curled over Tony’s back and bit down on the back of his neck.  “Mine,” he growled, before nudging his cock into Tony’s hole.
Well.  That was clear enough.  Gripping his cock to stave off an embarrassing finish, Tony pushed the head of his cock into Steve’s hole, grunting as the tight heat closed around him.  “God, you’re always so tight,” Tony moaned.
“Yeah.”  Tony chuckled, slipping onto his back on the bed.  He kept his eyes on Steve, wanting to make sure he hadn’t hurt the larger man – not that he really thought he could, but… well, hurting Steve was never the idea.  “How much time you need before number four?”
"I ain't gonna hit you, Tony," Steve growled, bucking up against him.
Steve laughed, low in his throat, and slid one hand down to join his tongue.  Carefully, he worked a finger into Tony... pressing firmly, twisting it just right.  Just like he knew Tony liked.  Tony was whimpering now, almost to the point of begging.  Steve grinned and placed an extra kiss to the tender skin as he added a second finger.  He crooked the two towards him.
“Yes, Captain.”  There was a pause.  “She has left her office; I believe she is headed to speak with Sir.”
Maybe it was the brevity of the answer or something in the tone, but Tony’s eyes were drawn to Steve’s.  “Hey.”  Tony caught his hands where they were starting to peel the uniform down his hips and stilled them.  “We don’t have to do this, Steve.  I just thought – I thought it might help, not to be alone.”
“Fury.”  And that single word explanation was enough to make Tony nod in sympathetic understanding.  “He… wanted to know how I manage you.  What my secret is.”  He bit off the words, feeling the simmering anger rise again.
Tony laughed.  “Alright then.  One orgasm down – three to go.”
“I want it all, everything you are.  Every broken piece of you.”  Tony tensed in his arms.  “And I’m not going to try to fix you, doll.  You’re the mechanic, the engineer.  I’ll just hand you the tools you need and sit back to watch you be amazing again.”
“Just checking.”  Tony sat up and scrubbed at his face.  “JARVIS, has Rhodey texted recently enough to think he’s still up?”
“Can’t deny I like the good stuff.”  Tony lapped up the last of Steve’s come, kneeling over Steve.  “I can’t decide how best to punish you for that egregious coffee sin.  I don’t think I can match your stamina to count strokes.”  He reached out one long, callused finger and ran it along Steve’s cock, feeling it twitch.
Tony chuckled and strutted towards the bathroom.  “Mine may be pretty, but yours is a national treasure.”
“Neither did I.”  Steve nibbled another mark into Tony’s neck.  “Feel how hard I am for you, doll?”  Steve rocked his hips against Tony, letting his cock rub against the inside of Tony’s thighs.  “God, what you do to me.”
Steve let one eyebrow wing up.  “Oh?”
When they broke apart, both men were panting.  “You are not expendable,” Steve repeated, this time in a low snarl.  But he couldn’t say more – not without tilting into areas they didn’t talk about.  Instead, he started to fumble with the clasps of his uniform.
Tony nuzzled into Steve’s hand, letting his eyes flutter shut.  It was several long minutes before he answered, but Steve didn’t rush him.  “I don’t want to be the person making you into a dancing monkey again.”  Steve blinked once and opened his mouth, but Tony shook his head.  “You hate it.  I know you hate it.  I… I can’t avoid the press, I’ve never been able to, but I want to keep you out of it, keep you… safe.”
“Well.  I am going to remember that,” Tony murmured.
“No, no!  Good!  Very good!”
“I love you, too,” Steve whispered back, gazing down at him.  Neither spoke or moved for a moment, just soaking in each other.  Steve broke first, closing his eyes and leaning in for a kiss.  It started gentle, tender – but a moment later it transmuted to something hot and impatient.  “Clothes, off,” Steve panted.  “Hell, you turn me on like nothin’ else, babydoll.”  Steve sat up, tugging impatiently at his shirt.
“Fuck my knees,” Tony mumbled, shifting his attention to one of Steve’s ears.
“Well, yeah.  We’re sparring.  It’s expected.”
“Mostly just teasing,” Tony admitted, kissing Steve again.  He couldn’t get enough – never could.  “But I wouldn’t mind taking turns… I like seeing you fall apart on my cock.”  He nibbled his way to Steve’s ear, only half aware that Steve was carrying him to the bedroom.
“Oh, Steve,” Tony purred.  “I’m really gonna.  You broke the rule, after all.”  He reached over to stroke his fingers over Steve’s nipple.  “Four pots of coffee, four orgasms.  It’s only fair.”
“I vote for Thai and a cheesy action flick,” Clint groaned as they climbed back into the QuinJet for the short hop from SHIELD HQ back to the Tower.
“Just go,” Bruce said kindly.  “And Tony?  If the headache gets worse, I’ve got meds.”
“Just… you… said earlier… post-fight ride… like you wanted…”
Steve shook his head.  “That doesn’t help, doll.  Knowing what I ain’t don’t help.”
"I think we both win."  Steve kind of wanted to collapse there and get some sleep, but... "Please tell me you disabled the cameras in this alley before -- "
Ten minutes later, they were both acceptably dressed and curled up on the couch.  Steve had put on a pair of Iron Man fleece pants that Clint had bought him – mostly because they made Tony smile.  They were silent when JARVIS chimed.  “Sir, Miss Potts is requesting entry.”
“I think we’ve established I’m making poor choices tonight,” Steve said wryly, looking up at the punching bag.  “If we go with my methods, you’d be strung up next to the bag.”
“You like my ass.”  Steve wiggled it in the air, grinning.  “I’ve got proof.”  He dove back into the blow-job, still smiling.
Steve looked back over his shoulder with a raised eyebrow.  “Why, am I gonna be here awhile?”
Tony grinned into the kiss.  “Yeah, yeah.  We get started on that, we’ll never get to dinner.”
“That’s the cardinal rule of the Tower,” Tony agreed.  “This is… not.”  His eyes flashed to Steve, finding the supersoldier’s expression fondly amused.  “Nuh-uh, do not cite rule two at me.”
“Baby, you could ask me for the moon and I’d be on the phone with NASA to work it out,” Tony answered.  He should undress too, but he leaned against the doorjamb to watch Steve instead.  “You’re kind of incredible, you know that?”
Tony rose from the coffee table and crossed to him in two long strides, wrapping his arms around Steve’s waist.  “Jesus, that is so not what I thought was going on.”  He buried his head in the crook of Steve’s neck, breathing hard.  “God, I thought you were done with me.  Cutting ties for good.”
“I kind of figured that part out, what with the someday promises,” Tony chuckled, wiping at his eyes.
“I’m not glass,” Tony grumbled, rocking against Steve’s fingers.  “I won’t break.”
“I’m glad.”  Tony rubbed his cheek against one firm pec.  “You deserve to feel good, Steve.”
“I know damned well what fucked out Tony looks like, and I know what in love Tony looks like, thank you,” Rhodey said drily.  “Maybe she can’t tell the difference – hell, maybe she didn’t realize you two were knocking boots, which… well, she can be awfully blind where you’re concerned, Tones.”
Steve groaned.  “This is why you let me go first, isn’t it?”
“Look, I appreciate everyone being supportive – or silent, if you aren’t supportive – but I’ve got one hell of a headache brewing, thanks to that anxiety attack… I’m going up to bed.”  Tony rose and held out his hand to Steve.  “Coming?”
“Fuck, Steve, yes that’s – don’t stop,” Tony begged, squirming to get Steve to continue.
“Love you too, Princess Elsa,” Tony murmured.  He shoved lightly until Steve laid down on the mat, throwing a leg over him to straddle him.  “Want you to fuck me.”
“Maybe I want you to push.”
Partway through dessert, Steve rose to visit the men’s room.  As he passed Tony, he leaned down to whisper, “If you’re so inclined… follow me in a few minutes.”
That earned a groan, and the slow removal of fingers.  “I’ve got you, beautiful.”  Steve kissed him again as he shifted between Tony’s legs, one hand bracing him to the left of Tony’s head, the other guiding his cock.
Abruptly Tony was no longer sleepy – and Steve was no longer amused.  If they’d been in the Tower already, Tony would have walked away.  He was tired and hungry.  He’d bruised his torso, banging around in the Iron Man suit – and their interlude in the little building hadn’t helped his bruises.  All of that combined meant he was already sensitive – and now the person he’d been sure would understand was acting like Tony’s relationship with Steve was somehow abnormal.  Instead of being able to remove himself from the situation, he was stuck here, feeling like a bug on a card –
“I’m pretty much a sure thing, baby – although we’ll have coffee, not a drink.”   Tony finished tying Steve’s tie, giving it a pat.  “Time with you is too precious not to spend it sober.”
Steve folded back the blankets first and picked Tony up, sliding them both under the covers.  “I’m glad you’re home.”
“Oh, hell,” Tony groaned.  He lifted one hand to his mouth and bit down on a knuckle, the other twining in Steve’s hair.  It was hotter than he’d have guessed.  He’d had blowjobs in public places before, but nothing compared to this.  Steve’s mouth was a thing of beauty, and the way he worked his tongue along the bottom of Tony’s cock –
Steve blinked.  “What…?”
“No.”  He really, really wanted Tony to stay.  He just wanted it for different reasons that Tony was willing to give.  Steve dropped down onto the bed, still wearing his uniform from ankles to hips.
He teased Tony all throughout dinner – never to the point of discomfort, but always touching.  Tony was almost dizzy with arousal – and an even headier feeling of having Steve’s complete attention.  He couldn’t remember the last time someone had been so focused on him – so absolute in their awareness.
“That you’re worth it, doll,” Steve said from the doorway.  He was wiping paint off his hands, unapologetic for having eavesdropped.  “I really don’t care what the press says, Miss Potts.  I didn’t care before, and I don’t care now.”  He set the rag he’d been using next to the sink before pressing in close to Tony, tugging his partner to rest his back on Steve’s broad chest.  “You and Tony’ve got history, and I get that.  You bein’ his friend and runnin’ his company gets you some slack.  But don’t you be thinkin’ it’s okay to come into our home and accuse my partner of not bein’ worthy of my love.”
“And miss out on my post-fight ride?  Come on, Cap.”  Tony tried to make light of it – really.  “I’ve been watching that ass for hours, you wouldn’t ask me to deny myself now, would you?”
That worked better, and they continued in that configuration for forty-five minutes.  Steve called a hydration halt and considered them all.  “One last scramble.  Clint and Nat, Thor and Bruce, Tony – you’re with me this time.”
Tony turned his head to catch Steve’s lips with his own.  “I love you too.”  For a moment he ignored the insistent demands of his libido and focused only on the overwhelming love he felt for his partner – for Steve.  “God, do I love you.”
“Are you close, sweetheart?” Steve panted in Tony’s ear.  “Can you come just on my cock?”
“God, yes.”  Tony tugged at Steve’s hair, trying to bring him up close enough to kiss.  Yeah.  Kissing Steve was as paramount as breathing right now.
Tony made a soft, sad noise.  “It was implied.”  He twisted on the stool so that he could reach up and cup a hand around Steve’s cheek.  “You got pretty Brooklyn there, sweetheart.”
“I sure as hell don’t.”  Tony shoved the magazine in his hand across the table towards Pepper.  “You promised no press, Potts.”
Tony knew better than to argue that point.  “I’ve got a history, and it’s not… well.”  Tony looked away.  “You’ve seen what people think of me.  Fury’s not the only one who doesn’t respect me.”
“As old as you are, baby.”  Tony grinned and tightened his grip on Steve, who groaned.  “You getting close, love?  Or do you need more?”
“You’re not the only one who can plan ahead, baby,” Tony purred.  He rocked his hips against Steve’s hand, encouraging him to touch.
“It’s alright, baby,” Tony murmured.  “She’s… I think that’s her way of approving.”  He smoothed his thumb over Steve’s hand in his.
Any thought Steve had been entertaining of ditching the event evaporated at the plaintive note in Tony’s voice.  Glad he was out of sight in his closet, he covered his face with his hands briefly.  Damn everyone who’d ever given Tony reason to doubt himself, because it was fucking heartbreaking that he was so unsure about Steve.  “Of course I’m going, love.  I told you I would.”  It had just been easier when he thought this was a command performance as Captain America.
“Ready to head home, love?” Steve murmured in his ear.  His hand slipped under Tony’s jacket, fingers teasing along the waistband of his pants.
“Okay.”  Tony tugged him towards a couch and pushed him onto it.  He settled next to the supersoldier and pulled out his phone.  Steve looked at him blankly.  “What?”  Tony felt his cheeks heat.  “Did you think I was going to leave you here alone?  Jesus, Steve, if somebody isn’t here to make you sit down you’re going to cause heart palpitations in the staff, marching around in here in that uniform.”
“I like that.  I can get behind that.”  Tony leaned forward to kiss Steve, a surprisingly tender kiss that lasted for several minutes.  “Do you follow your golden rule too?”
Steve’s whole body shook.  “Tell me – ” he gasped.  “God, Tony, tell me – ”
“I don’t listen?!” Steve barked back, incredulously.  “You flew into hostile fire when I expressly told you to stay the fuck back—”
“Very funny.”  Steve rolled his eyes and got back on the bed, straddling Tony’s knees.  It might not be the easiest position to do this in, but it would be hot.  “You just gonna lie there?”
Tony’s hand came up around the back of his neck.  “If I’d known speaking Italian got you that hot, baby, I’d have done it weeks ago.”  He didn’t struggle when Steve hoisted his thighs up, just wrapped his legs around the supersoldier.  “Didn’t know you had a language kink.”
"So good," Steve repeated, thrusting into Tony again.  He slipped a hand between them and found Tony's cock, grasping it and smoothing his thumb over the head.  "A body made for sex, a mind made for genius, and a heart... God, that heart."  Steve dropped his head to nibble at Tony's neck, alternative between sharp nips and sweet kisses.
“Partner,” Tony cut him off.  “Not that word.  We’re not using that word.  It’s cursed.”
Steve lost track of time entirely.  Nothing existed outside his bedroom – hell, even beyond the bed.  All his focus was on Tony, and the incredible touches of his hands.  This wasn’t sexual, but it was intensely intimate.  Steve was drowning in sensation, swamped with – yes, damn it, with love.  He knew he couldn’t ever say it, but that’s what this was, and –
“Jesus, Tony.  Not everything can be solved with sex.”
Steve understood the fear.  He didn’t like it – and he’d be a lot more comfortable when the team knew – but he also was aware of how quickly Tony would shut down, if he were pushed too hard.  Still… with all the downtime, it was frustrating not to be able to just pull Tony onto his lap during movie night.
“I hit you,” Tony repeated, and Steve was alarmed to note his eyes were a little glassy.
“You remember that giant crocodile we fought down south?  Where were we, Georgia?”  Steve smiled a little.  “You got covered in slime when it blew.”
“Whatever you need, love.”
“Fuck you,” Steve shot back, shifting his kisses to the base of Tony’s cock.
Steve tried to talk Tony into sleeping, but gave up when he realized the engineer was nearly vibrating with distress.  He sat up again, pulling Tony into his arms.  “Is Miss Potts still calling, JARVIS?” Steve asked softly.
Walking out of the restaurant and into the camera flashes was an experience.  Tony’d done it before – Steve looked a little surprised.  The solder recovered quickly.  Happy was three cars down in the pick-up line, so Steve pulled Tony a little aside to wait.  He didn’t look directly at any of the cameras, keeping his attention focused on Tony.  “How would you rate the date so far, doll?” Steve asked, brushing his fingers over Tony’s hair.
“I don’t care.”  Steve’s jaw was set.  “You’re the best thing to happen to me in this century, doll – and I’m not backin’ down just because some bullies think it’s wrong.”
“You say that, but… you’re upset about something,” Tony said slowly.  “Tell me?”
The waiter arrived – and he managed to contain almost all his starstruck expression.  Steve was mildly impressed with how nonchalantly they were offered drinks and menus – he reminded himself to tip well.  Tony ordered something pasta related in flawless Italian.  Steve seconded it, and added two cups of espresso.  When Tony raised an eyebrow, Steve smiled.  “I’ve got plans for you later, sweetheart,” he murmured softly, uncaring whether the retreating waiter heard him or not.  “I’d like you to be wide awake for them.”
Steve slicked up his fingers and smirked.  "To fuck you?  Yeah."  He pushed his fingers back into Tony.  "Never know when the opportunity will... arise."
Steve had to clear his throat before he could continue.  “Stevie,” he whispered into Tony’s ear.  “And – and punk.”
“It’s not important.”
“Doubt it would be for you… you like uniforms,” Steve teased.  He gently stroked his fingers over Tony’s hole.
“Bullshit.”  Movements fluid and languorous, Steve slipped off Tony and grasped his cock with one large hand.  “Lie back and think of SHIELD.”
“Obviously.”  Steve sucked lightly at his earlobe.  “Know some AC/DC too, although I always thought ‘Thunderstruck’ suited Thor better.”  He added a peculiar little twist to the end of a thrust, drawing another moan from Tony.  “Maybe more appropriate tonight…” he hummed ‘You Shook Me All Night Long.’
“Please.”  It was rare that Tony outright begged, and it never failed to ratchet Steve to the next level.  “Please, Steve – I need – ”  Tony gasped and met his eyes.  “Make love to me.”
He didn’t normally come out of them feeling murderous… but there was a first time for everything.
Tony refused to admit how adorable it was that Steve squeaked in bed.  “Right, then.”  And Tony took the head of Steve’s cock between his lips – and didn’t cover his teeth.  He wasn’t biting, just… letting his teeth scrape over the skin lightly.  He was careful not to use too much pressure – still wanted Steve to enjoy it – but he wasn’t be any means gentle.
“That’s not… it’s more than that.”  Steve huffed in frustration.  “It’s… lewd.”
Tony chuckled a little as he was covered in a supersoldier blanket, running his hand up and down Steve’s arm.  “I love you, sugar.”
“I am yours,” Steve laughed – but he understood.  There was something primal about it, seeing Tony dressed to match his own uniform.  “But doll, if we’re late – ”
He shook his head.  “Just Steve, ma’am.  I’m not the Captain at home.”  He gave her a crooked smile.  “And for the record… home is where Tony is.”
They were late, but not so late that they earned more than an eyeroll from Pepper.  Tony took it in stride.  She’d have been shocked into catatonia if they’d managed to be on time.
Steve pulled away from Tony long enough to turn to face him, wrapping one arm around Tony’s waist and settling the other at the back of his neck.  He didn’t want to talk about the mission – didn’t want to think about the wounded or the dead.  He’d wanted to lose himself in physical activity with the punching bag but… perhaps Tony was right, and a different distraction would serve as well.  He slotted his leg between Tony’s and pulled him tight, bending his head to draw the engineer in for a long, scorching kiss.
“I am not opposed to adding that to the menu.”
“The answer to that question is never going to be no.”  Before Steve could move, though, Tony bent to kiss him again.  “You still okay?  Not too rough?”
On the other hand... Tony.
“Technically, neither of us is gay,” Steve interrupted again.  He wasn’t about to let her run rough-shod over Tony… or him.  “I’m not sure how Tony prefers to identify, but I’m pansexual.  Although for the foreseeable future, I’m Tonysexual.”
Tony chuckled, sitting up enough to pull off his own shirt, squirming to unfasten his pants.  “I used to think this level of arousal only came with toys and games.  Imagine my surprise to discover I just needed the right partner.”  He shoved pants and boxers off, catching his socks on the way because really, who left socks on for sex?
“We can never, ever tell Director Fury that his comments today are what prompted us to get our heads out of our asses.”
As soon as the lock was engaged, Steve was on him, kissing hungrily.  “Need you right now,” he moaned.  “Christ, I could eat you alive.”  Heedless of his suit, Steve dropped to his knees in front of Tony and unfastened the engineer’s pants.  Tony sucked in a startled breath but didn’t object.
“Damn it.”  Clint groaned and banged his head on the couch.  “Phil’s going to be insufferable.  He was off by one fucking day.  How does he do that?”
“Sir, yes, sir.”  Steve kissed him again, picking up the pace.  Tony shivered beneath him, his hands tightening on Steve’s trim hips.  “Would you prefer a different tune?”  He pressed closer to Tony’s ear and hummed again, this time a Black Sabbath song.
“Yes, please!”
“Night, platypus.”
“Like that one,” Tony gasped.
They were quiet in the car – and though there was arousal simmering between them, it wasn’t the fierce need that would have made them act in the car.  (Happy appreciated that.)  Steve lifted their clasped hands to his lips and presses along Tony’s fingers, but that was as far as they took it… until they arrived back in the penthouse.
Tony rolled his hips, forcing Steve’s fingers deeper into him.  “Yeah?”  He meant to sound challenging but the breathy quality to his voice kind of ruined the attitude.  “Prove it, soldier.”
“Like it when you beg,” Steve mumbled into his neck.  “Sound so sweet for me, babydoll.”
Steve laughed again.  "Maybe you'd rather I take you in front of them, hmm?  Team building exercise, to see it?  See you on your knees for me... begging.  You beg so sweet for me."
“I don’t know if I’m…” Tony gestured vaguely at his cock.
Once they were both clean, Tony tugged imperiously at Steve’s hand under the supersoldier followed him to the bed.  Tony nudged him onto his back.  “My turn to lay claim,” Tony murmured.  He found the lube – one of far too many bottles stashed in the penthouse – and slicked up his fingers.  “That alright, sugar?”
“Take it easy, Spangles.”  Tony’s touch turned soothing.  “It’s not a race.  Don’t hurt yourself.”
Tony blinked.  “Um.  No.”  Other than being an odd mix of confused and aroused.  He started to peel off his undersuit as well.
Steve looked down to realize – yes, he’d almost crumpled the skillet.  He set it down on the stove and stepped back, rubbing his hands on his khakis.  “Sorry.”
It took Steve a moment to realize it wasn’t the physical sensations that were overwhelming Tony, and his heart flip-flopped in his chest.  “I love you,” he whispered into Tony’s ear as he started to thrust.  “I’ve wanted to be able to tell you for ages, and having you here in my arms like this is just fantastic.”  Steve met his lips for a long kiss even as he continued his slow, rhythmic pace inside Tony.  “To look down at this incredible, beautiful man and know he loves me too is just – it’s everything, doll.”
And God, Steve wanted it to be real.  Almost too much – almost enough to call this off, because the idea that this was… some kind of game… it hurt.  He couldn’t, though.  He would take what he could get – and greedily.
“Pepper had the first one put in a display case, labeled ‘Proof that Tony Stark Has a Heart.’  Never was sure if it was meant to be sweet or sarcastic.”
“Language,” Tony gasped.
“Only in my nightmares.”  Steve tucked the soiled cloths away in a pocket and pulled Tony in for a kiss.  “It’s not fair that you look perfect again so fast.”
“You got no idea, doll.”  Steve added a third love bite before switching tactics.  He lifted Tony a little higher and slid a finger to his hole.  Cursing, he realized he’d once again forgotten the lube – only to be handed a small packet of it by his smirking lover.  “Thought I was the boy scout here,” Steve said wryly.
“How can you not be able to operate an iPhone, but be able to quote memes at me?”
Steve smirked up at him between kisses, edging down towards his bellybutton.  “I like making you roll your eyes at me.”
Steve whined again.  Tony obliged by switching to suckling kisses, adding a quick lick of tongue occasionally.  A few minutes of that and the whining had turned almost desperate, and was accompanied by muscle twitches in Steve’s thighs.  Grinning, Tony patted the bed with one hand, searching for the lube.  Steve found it first and handed it to him.  Tony slicked up his fingers and used one – just one – to ease into Steve.
“Because your life would be so boring without me?” Tony snorted and rolled his eyes.
“Rule four,” Steve murmured, making Tony’s eyes sparkle.
“Did,” Steve agreed on the end of a moan.
Tony feathered his fingers through Steve’s hair and leaned forward to kiss him.  It was indeed tender – almost achingly so.  The soft press of lips unlocked something in Steve that he knew he could never share aloud.  “Everyone’s home safe,” Tony murmured between kisses.  “You’re a good captain, to care about your men.  We’re safer for it.”  His kisses extended to Steve’s cheeks and then over his closed eyes.  “When one of us gets hurt, it isn’t your fault.”
“Umm…” Tony’s eyes were a little wild.
Tony’s hands scrabbled against the dusty wall.  “Fuck, I love it when you talk dirty.”
“Mad super secret agent skills?” Tony suggested vaguely, but his attention was mostly on Steve, kissing his hand.  Every time he did something so overtly romantic, Tony fell a little bit more in love.  He’d never been wooed like this, not really.
“That’s a good rule.”  Steve kissed him again.  “I like that rule.  Can I suggest one too?” Tony nodded.  “Open.  As in, not a secret.  We don’t have to make an announcement or anything,” he added when Tony’s eyes flickered away, “but I don’t want to lie about us, either.”  Tony didn’t answer right away.  “Yes, I’m sure.”  He pulled at Tony’s hand until the engineer rolled again so that his back was to Steve, and the supersoldier gathered him into his arms spoon-fashion.  Neither of them mentioned that it would probably have been smarter to clean off – they needed the touch too much.
Steve didn’t have the same problem.
“Yeah.”  Tony didn’t pull away – couldn’t look at his teammates.  “Um.  I suppose it’s too much to ask that nobody stuck around?”
“Wasn’t planning on it.”  Steve pulled back, smiling, and tugged Tony into the theater.  “Let’s see a show, love… now that we’re done giving one.”
Steve snorted.  “The word might be new, but likin’ all sorts isn’t.”
“Oh.”  Tony blinked.  “I… suppose you aren’t used to being objectified, are you.”  It wasn’t a question, and Tony sounded very sad.  “It gets easier.”
“Bedroom.”  Tony started peeling off articles of clothing, abandoning them along the way.  “Think I should reward you for putting up with this tonight, sweetheart.”
Tony laughed as he bent to clean Steve’s stomach with his tongue.  “Coffee doesn’t usually wind you up like this.”
Tony raised an eyebrow.  “Not about this, not later.  But if you’re eaten up by something so bad you can’t stay relaxed during a Stark Special Massage…”
“Yeah, seconded.”  Steve twisted onto his side, throwing a leg over Tony and pulling him close.
“Yeah… God, Tony,” Steve was almost whimpering, pushing back against him.  “Please.”
“Sonofabitch,” Tony groaned into Steve’s neck.
Tony’s eyebrows went up.  “That’s clever.”
“Tony, babydoll,” Steve said from his closet – because of course, Tony had given him a closet in the penthouse – “relax.  This is supposed to be fun.”  He selected a different button-down shirt and started rummaging for a tie.  His wardrobe had gotten sharper since he’d agreed to let Tony pick out the majority of his clothes… though he still wore weird tees and pajamas that other people purchased.
Tony drank it all down, humming contentedly.  When Steve was limp with satiation, Tony carefully tucked him back into that splendid suit and put him back to rights.  Steve was still a little dazed when Tony finished retying his tie, patting it into place with a proprietary air.  “Thank you,” Tony murmured, leaning in to kiss Steve.
And fuck if that wasn’t enough to push Steve over the edge.  He came hard, his hands tightening on Tony’s ass – probably leaving fingertip bruises – and spilled between then.  Tony held on for two strokes more before burying himself as deep as he could in Steve and coming as well, panting for breath.
“Is that a hint you want more sucking?”  Steve’s lips curved against him.  “Should I mark you up, babydoll?  Make it so everybody can see you’re mine?”  He nipped a little further down, across Tony’s shoulder blade.  “Map a constellation of kisses across you?”
Tony’s eyebrows shot up.  “You’ve given this a lot of thought, then?”
Obligingly, Tony picked up the pace.  He’d been trying to stay gentle – but he couldn’t, in the face of Steve’s hunger.  “You’re so good for me, baby,” Tony whispered in his ear.  “You take it so well.”  Steve arched beneath him, a desperate moan bursting out of him.  “That’s right, sugar – just let go, I’ve got you.”
Tony’s eyes went wide.  He nodded slowly.  “Right.”  He looked down at their hands.  “Barnes?”
Steve tipped his head further and nipped at Tony’s neck.  “Should make you run for it and catch you – go for the hat trick.”
“Well, I know how you feel about being polite.”  Tony stepped up to the bed and rubbed his cock around Steve’s hole, spreading lube around.  Then he dipped his fingers back in.  A desire to be rough warred with the urge not to really hurt Steve.
“Just – go away, Steve,” Tony sighed as the Iron Man suit disassembled.  He was tired to his marrow, exhausted in a way he hadn’t felt in years.  He wanted a drink – a lot of drinks.  No matter how delicious Steve looked in plaid pajama pants and a tight t-shirt, Tony wasn’t in the mood to talk.  (And who the fuck managed to look good in plaid pajama lounge pants?  It wasn’t fair.)
“Time to face the music, I guess.”  Tony pried himself off Steve – though he really just wanted to curl back up and take a nap, safe in supersoldier arms.  “This isn’t how I envisioned rule two playing out.”
God help him, Tony did.
Rhodey’s eyes blazed.  “Doesn’t she have fucking eyes?  I know it’s real for you, kid.  I’m not sure about the big blond lug, but I know it is for you.”  He made a motion like he was reaching for the screen – reaching to touch Tony.  “Christ, I knew that months ago.  How could she not – ”
“Can’t,” Steve said easily.  He let his eyes drift down Tony’s form, admiring the undersuit and the man inside it.  “I needed to have a talk with you.  It’s very important.”
“This was all for you, sugar,” Tony said softly.  “I’m really not in the game.  Happens sometimes when I’m stressed – or have had an anxiety attack.”
“I’m sure.”  Steve held out his hand and, when Tony slid his into it, pulled the engineer into a tight hug.  “I’m so sorry, love, I didn’t even think about it.”  Tony burrowed close, hiding his face against Steve’s neck.  “God, I’m so sorry.”  Steve glanced around for somewhere to sit down – only then remembering that they weren’t alone.  Well.  He’d wanted openness.  He just hadn’t counted on it coming at the end of an anxiety attack.
“What.”  Tony stared blankly at him.  “That’s – what?”
“You’ve been listening to Darcy’s feminist rants again, haven’t you?” Tony asked weakly, shooting for humor.
“I can be persuaded.”  Steve started to strip as well.  He’d thought Tony didn’t do baths – that’s what Rhodey had told him.  He wasn’t sure how to ask, though.  It didn’t seem smart to question an anxiety trigger… not when Tony was already coming off one panic attack.
“If that were true, we’d already be there,” Steve said drily.  He pulled Tony to him once more, before his lover had to step back into the Iron Man suit.  “Taking you up against a wall in the dust and debris is not a Captain America responsibility,” he murmured.  “It is, however, very much required to keep Steve Rogers sane.”
Chuckling, Tony tangled his fingers in blond hair.  “I’m a middle-aged man, Cap – no matter how good your mouth is, it’s probably going to be awhile before I get hard again.”
“Hey, it’s been seventy years since I got to whisper ‘I love you’s into somebody’s skin,” Steve told him, carefully working his index finger into Tony.  “Allow me some romance.”
This thing between them, it was only for the battlefield.
Tony laughed.  “I didn’t want you to be.”  He stroked the long planes of Steve’s back, feeling the hot welts he’d left earlier – already healing.  “I’m not too sore for more.  It’s easier for me to hold off coming when you go hard – and I wanted to make it to round two.”  He pressed his cheek against Steve’s.  “Whether round two is more of this or trading places is up to you.”
“What – ”  She looked utterly confused.  “We have things to discuss – ”
~ * ~
The supersoldier dragged himself out of the bed and held out his hand for Tony.  “Shower.  Right.  And then all the sleep.”
Once Tony was assured he wasn’t going to startle a PTSD flashback out of his lover, he stepped up behind Steve and pressed his own sweats-and-t-shirt covered body into the firm back.  “Liar.”  He placed one hand in the middle of Steve’s chest and let the other slide down his stomach to the waistband of his sweats.
“You’re adorable when you’re high on endorphins, baby,” Tony teased.
Steve started to laugh.  "That was terrible."  He caught Tony's lips for a kiss.  "Your own stripes?  You didn't mean to say that one out loud, did you?"
Perhaps he should be grateful that Tony was facing away and couldn’t see his face.  Steve wasn’t sure if he wanted to rage or cry.  “Sorry.”  If he could have reached him, he’d have run a comforting caress down the line of Tony’s back.
That leisurely pace couldn’t last forever.  Steve was swearing and begging, thrusting back against him.  Tony didn’t have it in him to resist that kind of lure.  He snaked a hand beneath Steve to reach the supersoldier’s cock and wrapped his hand around it, pumping it in time to his own thrusts.  Scant minutes later, Steve was coming in his hand.  The resulting muscle contractions around Tony’s cock proved too much for him, and he spilled into Steve, gasping.
Steve kissed him, hard.  “Next time you try to tell me to ignore your orgasm, I’m going to spank you.”
“Alright!  You win,” Tony chuckled weakly.  “God, we need a shower.”  He ran a hand through the cooling come on his stomach – a mix of both of theirs and though theoretically that was romantic… in practicality, it was cold and sticky.  “Get up, you big lug.”  Tony elbowed Steve, who was pleasantly drowsy.
“I am, I promise,” Tony groaned, pushing back against Steve’s hand.  “Scout’s honor, pinky promise, solemn vow, cross my heart.”
“You got somethin’ against the gym?”  Steve tightened his hand around the nape of Tony’s neck.  “Want you right here on the mats.”
“You know I wouldn’t – ”
Steve smiled against Tony’s lips.  “Yes, I am.”  He dropped a kiss along Tony’s ear.  “And you’re mine.”
Tony pursed his lips.  “Hate to break it to you, Cap – it isn’t just the women.”  Naked now, he closed the small distance between them and put both hands on Steve’s pecs.  Steve shivered just from that little touch, and Tony smiled.  So, it was going to be one of those?  He loved the times that Steve was so sensitive.  He dipped his head and extended his tongue, lightly touching Steve’s left nipple.
“I do,” Tony murmured.  “Trust you, mean.  And… I love you.”  He twisted until he could kiss Steve on the lips.  His hand slipped down to Steve’s cock – barely hard.  “Why haven’t we invested in waterproof lube yet?”
A date.
“Agreed.”  Steve nuzzled him again, settling in more comfortable.
“I live to serve,” Steve mumbled, canting his hips forward to meet Tony’s.  He was already hard, tenting the plaid fabric.  “Will you –”
“Thanks, Brucie.”  Tony flashed him a smile before tugging Steve to the elevator.
“Hard to object to a request like that.”  Steve pulled his fingers free with a final kiss to Tony’s cock.  He poured more lube and smoothed it on, groaning a little.  “I don’t know how much staying power I’ve got right now.”
“So you’re the only one allowed to be insecure in the bedroom?”
Tony twined his arms around Steve’s shoulders.  “He doesn’t like people knowing.  Says they look at him different.”
“Yeah,” Tony sighed, rocking back against him.  “Yours, baby.  God, you feel so good.”  He caught his breath as Steve bottomed out.  “Take me, baby.  Show me who I belong to.”
Steve pressed a kiss to the back of Tony’s neck.  “I can do that.”
He set up a grueling pace, trying to push Tony’s limits without actually hurting him.  Tony met every thrust with an almost desperate hunger, heels digging into Steve’s ass, thighs slapping against Steve’s.  The soldier tried to hold out, but it wasn’t long before he was gasping.  “Tony, if we don’t slow down I’m going to come right now.”
“It needed to be done, and I’m the one that needed to do it,” Tony barreled on.  “I’m sorry I couldn’t explain, but—”
“Measure of experience.”  Tony folded his hands behind his head, watching Steve with a small smile.  “You gonna put on a show for me, soldier boy?  Should I have J queue up your USO theme?”
It was that simple gesture – not the kissing and touching and declarations – it was Steve’s hand on the arc reactor that triggered realization in Pepper.
Carefully, Steve slid one finger into Tony’s hole, moaning at how easily he took it.  “Jesus, I love it when you’re slutty.”  He added a second finger, swallowing hard.  His cock had softened some after his orgasm, but was now harder than it had been in Tony’s throat.
Steve smiled and pressed their lips together.  “You love me,” he whispered against Tony’s lips.  “Sap and all.”
“I know.”  Tony tugged at the thighs of Steve’s sweat pants until they slid down, revealing the toned muscles.  Another tug, and the plain boxers were removed as well.  Tony sucked in a breath as Steve’s cock was revealed – it was always a little awe-inspiring.  Jokes aside, the serum had been kind to Steve… and Tony definitely appreciated the benefits.  Leaning forward, he placed a kiss just at the base of Steve’s cock.
At first, they only had sex when the both of them had been in the field together – usually amidst dirt and debris, filthy and fucking delicious.
Tony dropped his head against the wall and spread his legs.  “This what you want?” he asked, looking back over his shoulder.  “Me to present to you, like a good little slut?”
“Sweet Jesus, you’re good at that,” Steve groaned.
“No, I don’t think it does.”  Steve turned off the water and slid into the tub, holding his arms out to invite Tony into it with him.  It took another deep breath before Tony could join him.  “You’re not a victim, love – you’re a survivor.”  He kept his touch gentle, cradling Tony against him.  “And you’re mine to love now – mine to protect.”
"Yes, sir."  That smug, trollish smile that Tony adored spread across Steve's face -- and then the engineer found himself spun around to face the concrete, his pants yanked down to his knees.
“Holyfuckingshit,” Steve gasped.  His hands clenched in the fabric of the bedsheets, scrabbling and desperate.
Steve laughed and rolled onto his side next to Tony.  “Sorry.  I didn’t mean to push too much.  I should have known better than to throw gratitude and love into one comment.”
“Oh.”  Tony froze.  “Oh, shit.  Holy shit.  Steve, we have fucked up.”
Steve leaned into Tony shoulder, turning to press a kiss to his cheek.  “You wanna explain that, doll?”
When they rose from the table, Steve offered Tony his hand.  “I know you’re worried about photos,” Steve murmured quietly.  “I’m not.  I’d rather they get pictures of us like this, well-fed and in love, than to try and stalk us at a battle.  Let’s choose to let them take our photos, love – where they can be safe.”
~ * ~
Tony definitely wasn’t feeling all warm and swoony over that.  Nope.  “Romantic sap.”  He wrapped one arm around Steve’s waist and twined the other in his hair again.
Bruce watched the two of them, his eyebrows drawn together.  “What triggered that panic attack, Tony?”
“Love you too, honeybear,” Tony murmured.
Steve grabbed his cock with his slick hand and positioned himself carefully, then let gravity ease Tony down onto him.  “Fuck,” he breathed as Tony slid onto him, feeling the intense heat.  “Goddamn, you always feel like coming home.”
“I know you do um,” Steve agreed, smiling.  Beneath the table he slipped his foot out of the very expensive leather shoe that Tony had picked out and pressed it against Tony’s calf.
“I feel it,” Tony promised.  The pleasure was drowning him, but he wouldn’t look away from Steve’s gaze.  “Do you feel it too, baby?”
The engineer frowned.  “Then I get Captain America’s Eyebrows of Disappointment.  Why?”
Steve lifted an eyebrow at Tony, who shrugged his assent.  “We’d be delighted.”  He tucked Tony’s hand in his and gestured for the woman to lead them backstage.
“That ain’t none of your—” Steve began hotly, but Tony silenced him with a soft kiss.
Tony bucked against him, the slow pace doing nothing to stem his arousal.  "Steve..."  He wasn't even sure what he was asking for, just... begging.
“No.”  Tony turned his head into Steve’s neck.  “But I think I’d better.”  He sighed and rose, pawing through dresser drawers for something to wear.  “You don’t have to stay.”
Steve sat up, changing the angle and lighting up new pleasure for Tony.  The supersoldier rolled his hips, his cock bobbing obscenely.  Tony reached for it, but Steve batted his hand away.  “Want to come just like this,” he moaned.
Tony debated pushing – but something in Steve’s eyes suggested that wouldn’t end well.  Alright.  Tony could roll with that.  He leaned over and caught Steve in a kiss.  He kept it gentle, no matter how horny he’d gotten given the supersoldier a very thorough massage.  This wasn’t about a quick bang – Steve needed to be taken care of tonight.  It had been awhile since Tony tried – and he’d never done it for a man – but he figured it wasn’t much different than pampering Pepper had been.  (Except Tony wasn’t likely to get told tomorrow that he needed to take a refresher course, or that he’d been ‘acceptable.’)  “Alright.  Just… try to relax for me, okay?”  Steve nodded, and Tony kissed him again in reward.
“There’s rough, and there’s mean.”  Tony stretched up to kiss Steve.  “You’re too precious to me to be mean, love.  Not when you’re promising to someday make an honest man out of me.”
“Always.”  Steve gripped Tony’s hips to still them.  “Would rather we move to the bedroom, love.  I don’t really fancy bein’ walked in on.”
“Only to me, baby.”  JARVIS, bless him, had already started the tub.  They only had to wait a few minutes for the water to be deep enough to climb in.  At Tony’s gesture, Steve sat down in the tub first, and Tony nestled in between his legs, leaning back against his chest.  As soon as they were situated, Tony let out a long sigh.  “This is good.”
“Six out of ten,” Tony grinned.  “You’ve got some ground to make up, Rogers.”
Steve cried out, his back arching.  The movement of his hips stuttered and Tony tried to make up the slack, thrusting up into him.  “Oh, fuck,” Steve whispered, “right – yes, right there, babydoll.”  His eyes fluttered shut and on the end of one long moan, he came – spurting hot come onto his own chest, splattering down onto Tony.
“Just – just fuck me harder,” Tony begged.
“Now who’s the fucking troll?” Steve griped.  He leaned forward, propping himself up on one hand while he reached behind himself with slicked fingers.  “Mmm… this is better when you do it, love.”  Steve could already tell he wouldn’t be doing as thorough a job – no matter how good his own fingers felt, they were nothing compared to Tony’s touch.
“Yes!” Natasha, Clint, and Bruce chorused.  Thor merely chuckled.
"Nope."  Tony made quick work of it, and in ten minutes they were standing by the Iron Man suit again, looking... well, not normal, but not like they'd just fucked each other's brains out, either.  "Tower or SHIELD?" Tony asked, his hand on the suit to climb back in."
“Let her in, J.”  Tony sucked in a breath.
Steve pulled back to look at him.  “That was… profound.”
Steve kissed his way downward, pausing to pay attention to Tony’s nipples – and to lightly kiss all around the scar tissue surrounding the arc reactor.  Those kisses were feather-soft, always mindful not to put pressure on the area… but it was important to Steve that Tony know he didn’t find it repulsive.  Tony’s breath stuttered when Steve kissed him there – it was more intimate than he’d ever admit aloud.  The trail of kisses continued downward as Steve worked two fingers in Tony – probably longer than was necessary, but they both enjoyed it.  He added a third finger as he reached Tony’s cock, timing it is that he was slipping the broader digits into Tony just as he sucked the entire length into his mouth.
Steve’s hips stuttered.  “I’m so close,” he murmured.  “You gonna come with me?  Can you?”  Tony nodded, panting.  “Come on then,” Steve urged, his hand speeding up on Tony’s cock just as his hips did.
“I do – fuck, yes – right there, baby.  God, your hands are… so nimble and… long fingers…”  Tony let his head fall forward against Steve, moaning.  “I could come just like this, just on your fingers.”
“Something real?”  She snorted in disbelief.  “You know what I think?”
Pepper raised an eyebrow.  “I did not.  I said I’d do what I could to keep the press off your back.  This is different.”  She pointed at the magazine.  “They want to interview you two as a couple, as role models for LGBT youth.  It isn’t an Avengers interview and it isn’t a Stark Industries interview – this is two very famous men in a very famous relationship being open about their struggles.  Imagine the teens you could reach, Tony.”
Tony yawned and pressed his head more tightly against Steve.  “’Course we have rules.”
Despite his confusion, Tony’s orders were easy to follow.  Steve peeled off the remainder of his uniform and stretched out on his back on the bed, his hands folded behind his head.  To his surprise – and a little shame – he wasn’t even fully hard.  He didn’t think that had ever happened in this close proximity to an undersuit clad Tony… which only reiterated how damned shaken he was.
Tony eyed him with a smirk.  “Oh, such a loaded question.”  He sat up, ignoring the vague pull of muscles.  Tony watched Steve for several minutes, running through different positions and combinations in his head.  It had the added benefit of making Steve squirm in anticipation.  “We’ll start with you kneeling at the edge of the bed.”  Tony stood up and stretched, watching as Steve obeyed.  “There you go.”  Tony caressed the curve of Steve’s very lovely ass.  “Comfy?”
The engineer froze. “I… I wondered how long it would take.”  Tony’s throat wanted to close up, but he forced himself to keep talking.  “Everybody gets to that point with me, sooner or later.  I’d hoped…”  He trailed off, looking at Steve’s broad back.  The supersoldier was looking out over the city, his posture tense.  “I shouldn’t be surprised,” Tony continued dully.
"A closer look, sure."  Steve stepped closer to Tony, still in his uniform.  "Maybe you'll give me a lift over there?"
Steve grinned.  “Can do.”  He kissed down Tony’s chest, his hands stroking as he went.  He spent some time on the lovely defined abs – how people ever thought Tony didn’t keep in shape to pilot the suit, Steve would never know – and finally arrived at his target.  Like any good soldier, he did recon first – mapping Tony’s cock with his fingers before placing a kiss right at the tip, and then swallowing him down.
Steve didn’t notice him come in, lost in his own mind and movement.  His punches were perfectly calculated and precision placed with a rapidity that put many robots to shame.  (Particularly DUM-E, though Steve was inordinately fond of Tony’s bots.)
“Whoa.”  Tony’s eyes were wide, startled – but he didn’t pull away.  “Yeah, okay.  I changed my mind.  We are definitely having a discussion… just not here.”  He looked around the communal kitchen.  “Your quarters or mine?”
Sighing, Tony tugged Steve’s head down to rest against his again.  “I don’t think it ever will, sweetheart.  It hasn’t for me.  I was fifteen the first time a magazine article described me as having ‘bedroom eyes.’  They’ve covered my sexual exploits – in detail, sometimes in high definition – for almost that long.  And what we deal with?  That’s nothing compared to what they say about Nat.”
“I never said that,” Pepper protested.
“Yeah,” Steve breathed.
Steve put his hands on either side of Tony's head.  "Brace yourself and think of SHIELD," he teased, before pulling out and burying himself fulling, gasping as he bottomed out.  Tony lifted his ass slightly to meet him, rocking his pelvis.  "Christ, don't do that, I won't make it another -- " he repeated the stroke, and Tony doubled down by squeezing his muscles around Steve's cock.  "God, Tony," Steve breathed -- and gave in.  One more thrust and he felt himself come, filling Tony and spilling onto the dusty ground.  He managed one more, gasping, as the pulse of orgasm swept through him.
“More,” Steve demanded, his hands latching on Tony’s ass.  “God, please, more.  Harder.”
“Yes and yes – God, yes.”  Tony arched up against Steve, his own cock trapped between them.  “I’m so close, Steve.”
Tony held out a hand.  “It’s a big bed,” he said awkwardly.  “You can stay… if you want.”
Thor pushed a bench close to him, then made a hand gesture that Steve interpreted as giving them time – or quiet.  Steve sank onto the bench, cradling Tony against him.  His lover was shivering still, but after ten minutes of silent comfort, Tony regained some composure.
“Wouldn’t dream of it,” Steve said solemnly, his eyes twinkling.  He leaned in and kissed Tony instead.
“Exactly what you’re doing – be here.  And maybe a cup of coffee,” Tony added thoughtfully.
“I have no idea.”  Steve sank onto one of the couches, pulling Tony down with him.
“Deal.”  Pepper rose.  “You’re doing a good thing, Tony.”
“I was trying to stay tender,” Tony said ruefully when he could breathe again.  “You kind of derailed that plan.”  He leaned down to kiss Steve.
“Don’t care.”  Steve closed his eyes, plastering himself against Tony.
And then freaked out.
Steve smiled broadly at her.  “Yes ma’am?”
“I’ll fix it when I’m done,” Tony promised.  He finally managed to slide Steve’s tie off his neck, rapidly unbuttoning the collar so that he could bury his neck in the warmth there.  “So beautiful all dressed up – ”
“But it’s a lot.”  Steve hugged him, tucking Tony’s head into his shoulder.  “I didn’t plan it to happen that way either.”
“I promised you I’d take you hard up against the wall,” Steve reminded him, viciously yanking on fasteners.  “And right now, it’s either continue to scream at you or fuck you – and I’m choosing door number two.  You got a problem with that, Stark?”
He surrendered.  There was no point in arguing, not right now – not with Steve buried inside him, Steve’s hand on his cock.  Tony ignored the emotions and just let arousal swamp him.
“Smart ass.”
“I know that!”  Steve so rarely raised his voice outside fighting and training that it made both Tony’s eyebrows raise.  Steve halted his pacing and rubbed his forehead with one hand.  (He’d shed the gloves, at least – Tony liked that.)  “Sorry.  Just – sorry.”
~ * ~
“Thanks,” Tony murmured – and the pair made their way to an elevator alone.
“I think Nat ordered them,” Steve said, shucking out of pants, boxers, and shirt.  “Might have been Darcy.  I don’t ask.  Clothes turn up in my room, and the women of the Tower smile at me when I wear them.”
“It was exactly what I needed.”  Steve shifted his hands to Tony’s head, tangling in his hair and guiding the kiss.  “Thank you.”  There was more he wanted to say… needed to say… but didn’t.
Steve was writhing under his touches, trying not to buck too hard.  “You gonna – Jesus, Tony – you gonna use your teeth on me there too?”
“When was this?” Tony asked, lifting an eyebrow.
Ice dripped down Steve’s spine.  His jaw clenched and he rose from the table.  He wouldn’t be explaining the odd form of discipline they’d stumbled upon – the not-relationship between himself and Tony that they didn’t talk about but that somehow gave them both balance.  He couldn’t let the open criticism nigh derision of his teammate stand, though.  “Try respect,” he ground out.  “Amazing what mutual respect can do in the field.  You might try it, now and then.”
“Hell, that’s hot,” Tony whispered, gazing up at his lover with wide eyes.  “Alright, sweetheart… you just take what you need, then.”
“It’s alright,” Steve said softly.  He forced himself to put out of mind his four teammates in the gym, and focus only on his partner.  “Tony, I’m okay.”  He held out his hands.  “Come here, it’s okay.”
Tony pulled away, lapping up any spilled fluid as he went.  The problem with deep throating, in his opinion, was the lack of cum to taste.  No matter… there were always second helpings.
“Well, in that case,” Steve chuckled, pulling his fingers free.  Tony keened at the loss, even knowing he’d soon be filled with something much more satisfying.  Steve poured more lube on his cock, slicking it up with a groan of his own.  “Look what you do to me,” he murmured to Tony, his hand tight around his cock.  “Look how hard I am for you, sweetheart.”  Steve shifted, pressing the head of his cock against Tony’s entrance.
Steve tugged Tony on to his lap when the video call ended.  “Better now, love?”
Media coverage of their date – their very lovely, extremely romantic date – was bad enough.  Tony had dealt with the press his whole life – he could compartmentalize that worry and set it aside for later.
“It’s not that bad,” Tony protested as he selected a watch from a drawer.  “It’s a charity benefit, sugar – not the blitz.”
Tony’s cheeks heated.  “About that—”
Carefully, Tony slid an arm around Steve’s waist.  “You do respect me, sugar.”  The endearment slipped out without his permission, but he let it stand.  He called Rhodey all manner of such things, surely this could be overlooked.
Steve managed to wait until Tony had found a tiny little building at the edge of the fight zone – somehow restrained himself until the inventor had secured the cameras and they were in no danger of inadvertently becoming PornHub stars – kept his cool while Tony stripped out of the undersuit.
Tony laughed, bouncing Steve on his chest.  "Yeah, J got them as soon as we landed."  He tugged at Steve, brought their lips together for one more long kiss.  "Sex that good is not an incentive to keep from breaking protocol."
“Yes I am.”  The answer was out before he could stop it.
“It’s okay.  It’s… he’s got reason to ask, baby.”  Tony looked down at their joined hands.  “It’s the first time we’re sparred since – becoming more.  I didn’t… it just clicked all of a sudden that I was hitting my partner, my lover.  And I… have issues with that.”  He looked up, met Bruce’s eyes.  “I know you do, too.  That’s… I promise, Bruce, Steve didn’t do anything to prompt me freaking out.”
“Yeah.”
"I love it when you beg."  Steve pulled his fingers out of Tony, making the engineer whimper again.  "I ain't takin' you dry."  He twisted, reaching for a pocket on his uniform pants and extracting a small bottle of lube.
“Ones of you always are,” Steve mumbled back, and Tony grinned.
“No!”  Tony tugged on Steve’s arms until they were tighter around him.  “Just… making expectations clear.”
Steve grinned at his affront.  “Anticipation’s good for the soul.”  His eyes sparkled.
“Yeah.”  Tony tucked his head against Steve’s neck.  “I don’t deserve Rhodey.”
“And you took that to mean that talking would be the end of – this?”  Tony shook his head.  “Baby, that’s not – ”  Steve made a soft, sad sound that drew Tony’s eyes to his face.  “What did I say?”
He should be the better man and protest, but Steve couldn’t imagine pushing Tony away now.  He slid his fingers into the soft strands of Tony’s hair instead.  “You’re always good to me, doll.”  Tony managed to get his cock out – and without any other warning, took him fully down his throat.  “Holy hell!”  Steve’s knees threatened to buckle but he managed to stay upright without yanking on Tony.
“Yeah, I can understand that.”  Steve covered Tony’s hands with his own, just holding on.  “I mean, that kind of explains why he’s so… um…”
“You knew?”  Tony blinked.  “You didn’t – we weren’t – ”
When the aftershocks eased, Tony released Steve’s cock from his mouth and gently pulled his fingers out.  He sat back on his heels on the bed, watching the blond regain his breath.
The supersoldier pulled his fingers free.  "You're only up to nine thrusts... you really think you can hold out the whole time?  By my count that's twenty-seven left."  He pulled his cock free from his uniform but didn't undress -- he knew the rough fabric rubbing against Tony's ass was an added level of arousal.
“Thanks, I think?” Steve laughed.  “You want me on my knees, or…?”
Blinking innocently at him, Steve used his free hand to lift a glass of water to his lips.  “What?”
Tony pulled back to meet his eyes, just for a moment.  “Alright.”  He kissed Steve’s lips – slow and unhurried.  “You don’t have to make it sound like a chore, Steve.”
They panted together, desperate clutches turning into soft caresses.  Steve slipped out carefully as he softened, shifting to the side to pull Tony into his arms.  “We should shower,” he said eventually – though he didn’t move.
He came back to awareness some moments later, breath still wheezing, feeling Tony stroking his back.  “With me again?” Tony whispered.
“Here I thought I was subtle about it.”  Tony squirmed until he could press down on Steve’s fingers.
“What?”  Steve was partially distracted by the taste of Tony, the silken slide of skin against his tongue.
“Yeah.”  Steve caught his lips for a kiss, slow and tender.  “Fuck, that was incredible.”
“Be rough?”
Tony returned with the bottle and dropped it onto the bed next to Steve.  “I’m guessing you’d like to face me, yeah?”  Steve nodded.  “Alright.  Lift your leg up… there you go.”  Tony’s hands were gentle as he guided Steve’s legs open, slicking up his fingers and starting, very slowly, to prep Steve.  “You’re so beautiful like this,” Tony murmured as Steve relaxed into his touch.  “All spread out for me, practically begging to be touched.”
Apparently that was mutual need, because as soon as Steve was within reach, he was kissing Tony hungrily.  “Never enough,” he mumbled against Tony’s lips.  “God, I can never get enough of you.”  He didn’t leave Tony time to dwell on that, though.  Grasping his cock, Steve nudged it against Tony’s hole, then slid home.  “So tight for me,” Steve gasped.  “You feel so good, doll.”
“Other than ‘yes please’, I’ve got nothing.”  Steve shifted to the side so that he wasn’t caging Tony on the bed.  “What about you?”
Arriving at the theater was a bigger spectacle than arriving at the restaurant.  Happy – who possessed that ability of all the best chauffeurs, manservants, and aides to fade into the background – pulled up to the entrance silently, and got out to open their door.  Steve stepped out first, scanning the crowd before offering Tony his hand.  Tony got out as well, standing next to Steve and feeling exposed.
Steve got to his feet, immediately crowding close to Tony again.  “Sometimes I like the risk… sometimes I’d rather just concentrate on you.”  He tilted his head, catching Tony’s lips in a long, slow kiss.  “I don’t want battlefield fucking right now, doll.  I want to make love to you.”
“Yup.”  Tony made a show of getting comfortable, grinning up at his partner.  “If you’re really tempting, I might have to jack off.  Just a little, you know, to get warmed up.”
Tony didn’t argue – just started to clean up.  They were both sweaty and gross – it hadn’t been a quick fight.  He might have ordinarily objected to getting clean just so they could get dirty again… but he didn’t particularly want to get the bed this filthy either.
Steve smiled slowly, and Tony felt a twitch in his cock.  The man was so damned attractive, it shouldn’t be allowed.  “There’s been a very serious breach of protocol while you were gone.”
Laughing, Steve shifted behind Tony and lined himself up, pressing slowly in.  Even with all the prep, it was tight.  God, Tony was always so tight and Steve didn't understand how it was possible.  "Christ."
Laughing, Steve rocked back against him.  “Sorry, not sorry.”
“No, she didn’t.”  Steve’s arm tightened around him.  “You let it drop, and I didn’t push – but she didn’t apologize.”
“Yeah.”  Tony nestled his head against Steve’s shoulder.  “Me too.”  He couldn’t quite settle – couldn’t quite believe there wasn’t going to be a big discussion.
Shaking her head, Pepper let herself out.  Maybe she’d go visit Natasha… and they could discuss how obnoxiously cute the pair was.  Besides, Nat was very good at manipulating the press… she’d be an excellent ally.
God, Tony loved this man.
Overwhelmed with emotion, Steve returned the kiss.  His hips stuttered, rhythm interrupted as he tried to show Tony with his lips how deeply those words affected him – how desperately he loved this madman, this visionary builder that had given him a home and a future and something to wake up for.
“It’s a good thing the team approves,” Tony said ruefully.  He started to shimmy back into his undersuit.  “Can you imagine the hell if Natasha decided she wanted to keep us from slipping away?”
“Need you right now,” Steve growled, peeling his uniform off.  “Holy Christ, right now.”  He stalked forward, pinning Tony against the wall of the tiny space.  “Do you have any idea how hot that was?  Jesus, Tony.”  He dropped his lips to Tony’s bare neck, sucking a mark into the olive flesh.
Steve groaned and his cock twitched.  Few things got him hotter than Tony being overtly loving – it was silly and romantic and if he said it aloud, his partner would scoff.  “I’m open enough, please,” he said instead, panting against Tony’s shoulder.  “Just go slow, it’ll be fine.”
“Sure.”  Tony paused.  “I’m sorry I didn’t call earlier.”
Laughing, Tony swatted at his hands.  “Let’s at least get to the penthouse first, baby.  I don’t want to give the team a free show.”
“You got a thing for my abs,” Steve grumbled – but he complied and lay on his side on the mat, drawing Tony into his arms.  “How do you want me, doll?”
He tried to answer – really – but the words were stolen from Tony when Steve added a third finger, twisting it just right.  Tony cried out, his hips lifting without his permission.  “Please – ” he managed to choke out.
Tony was silent, shivering in Steve’s arms.  “Defining the relationship has always been the beginning of the end for me.  And I – it’ll damned near kill me if you wind up in the same category as the others… an ex.”
It wasn’t that Tony didn’t want to be open with Steve… but he kept seeing tabloid headlines and splashy listicles in his head.  Tony didn’t care what they said about him, but worrying about Steve’s reputation kept him from reaching out, most days.
“You’ve got me, baby.”  Tony tugged Steve closer, finding the bottle of lube and wetting his own fingers.  “Budge up, let me in there.”
Tony pressed his forehead against Steve’s shoulder, feeling tears prick at his eyes.  “Okay,” he breathed after a minute.  “I’m – you can move.”  Steve nuzzled his cheek and started to pull out, pausing when Tony let out soft whimper.  “It’s okay, I’m just – it’s – a lot.”
Steve shifted closer, tugging at Tony until the engineer nestled into his lap.  “I can’t avoid the press either, love – haven’t been able to since Rebirth.  But damn, I love that you want to protect me.”  He leaned his forehead against Tony, smoothing his hands up and down the work-hardened muscles of his back.  “You hate it too, love.  Maybe nobody else can tell, but I see it.  So I’ll make you a deal.  We do press together, or not at all.  Even if that means I’m sittin’ off screen, or you are – but we’re partners now, love.  We don’t have to do shit on our own anymore.”
The cast was – well, starstruck.  Tony was used to that… but it was amazing to watch Steve.  His partner didn’t just sign autographs and pose for photos – he chatted earnestly with each of the actors about their roles and the play in general.  He discussed similar shows and the changes in theater over the decades – marveled at the costume design and gushed over the elaborate sets.
Steve’s arms came up around him automatically.  “I’m trying to give you space, doll.”
Tony wasn’t sure if the crazy part was because Steve wouldn’t settle down and stop moving or because he hadn’t changed out of his uniform yet, and his ass looked amazing.
Steve’s hand clenched in Tony’s hair.  “I’m gonna – ”  He didn’t even get a chance to finish his warning, spilling his come into Tony’s eager mouth.  Tony drank it all, lapping up every spilled drop even as his fingers picked up in speed.  Steve wouldn’t be too sensitive to continue for at least another orgasm… and Tony intended to be inside him for that one.
“The other kind of strokes?” Steve suggested, rocking his hips up to meet Tony’s touch.
Tony groaned and arched up against Steve’s mouth, his hands moving to the blond head.  “It’s – it’s your turn, isn’t it?  I owe you a – ”
He made his way down from the workshop at the three hour mark.  That was sufficient for the rest of the team to have settled into their own coping mechanisms.  (Tony didn’t ask, and he’d never tell.)  It meant the gym was empty save for Steve, and likely to remain so.
Pepper crossed the room and sat down on the stool next to him.  “This is going to hurt his reputation, Tony.”
"You win," Tony chuckled, carding his hand through Steve's hair.  "That last one made thirty-six."
"You like my uniform."  Steve nipped at Tony's neck, lips curving in a smile.
“I don’t know,” Natasha drawled, and Tony’s eyes snapped to hers.  “The anxiety sucked, but watching our good captain go all gooey taking care of you was pretty adorable.”
Tony looked back over his naked shoulder.  “Stop overthinking it.  I can’t take them alone, but you’ll be there to protect me from the scary water.”
“TV and a cuddle,” Tony decided, reaching for Steve with grabby hands.
Steve hand slid down his back to cup Tony’s ass.  “You’re probably tired… you know I don’t expect – ”
“Damn it, Tony,” Steve muttered, grabbing for his discarded t-shirt, “you didn’t tell me you wanted video.”
“Anyone else this touchy about partner abuse?”
“I can imagine cop involvement is a bit of a boner killer,” Tony drawled.
Steve stepped out of his closet, tie in his hand.  He met Tony’s eyes in the mirror.  “We don’t have to do this.”  He kept his voice level, not betraying any emotion.
“You aren’t Sunset,” Tony whispered.  “Or Ty.  Or – or – You wouldn’t…”
“Mmmhmm.”  Steve closed his eyes.  “I’d rather not talk about him tonight.  This is about us.”
“Fucking troll,” Tony sighed again, but with remarkable affection.  The hand in Steve’s hair combed through the strands and he was fighting a smile.
And God, that question stung.  Steve knew if he said it – knew if he was honest about what he wanted and needed right now – Tony would be out the door in a heartbeat.  The man didn’t do emotions, and Steve knew that.  But Steve was worn raw right now.  He’d had the worst flashback since defrosting when Clint dropped out of his reach – it had been almost identical to Bucky’s fall, and Steve couldn’t deal.  Even knowing Clint was safe, he felt worn thin.
It completely shocked – and secretly delighted – Tony that Steve was not only serious about rule two – being open – but that he legitimately wanted to take Tony out on a date.
“Time for a remix.  Clint and Bruce, Nat and Tony – Thor, you’re with me,” Steve announced.
That changed when Tony returned to the Tower after a mission in the Middle East – one that he never should have been sent on, because it meant he had to fly over the desert he’d been held captive in those years ago.
Steve hummed in appreciation.  “Look at you, so eager for me.”  He curled inward, kissing soft skin on the inside of Tony’s hip.  “Like you were made to open up to me.”  He crooked his fingers, grinning when Tony let out a sharp cry and bucked against him.  “You’re always beautiful, babydoll – but coming apart for me like this, you’re fucking transcendent.”
Enough to be reminded that they’d been training with the whole team.
“Before we break for today,” Fury said, leaning forward over the conference table.  “I wanted to compliment you on your handling of Stark.”
“I don’t keep score.”  Steve nibbled delicately at Tony’s nipple, making him groan again.
More words he couldn’t say pushed against Steve, but he merely nodded and pressed his shoulder against Tony’s.
“Moving him in with you?  Playing it up in front of me?”  Pepper scoffed.  “You really think I’ll buy that?”
“More than.”  Tony rubbed his thumb on Steve’s scalp, amused to see the supersoldier leaning into it.  Maybe the cat metaphor was applicable more broadly… that was a hypothesis to test another day.
“Poetic little shit.”  Tony squirmed beneath him – which did lovely things to Steve’s cock – and managed to kick off his boxers and lounge pants.  “You know what I think?”
“It’s always better when there’s love,” Steve said fondly, kissing him again.  He wanted to ask if Tony had really never had emotionally connected sex – but it seemed like the wrong time for that particular conversation.  “Thank you for letting me love you, Tony.”
Tony tightened his fingers just this shade of painful, thrust to the hilt and ground into Steve.  That was all it took – for both of them.  Steve spilled into Tony’s hand and all over the bed, gasping and panting.  Tony came inside Steve, thrusting twice more before he was too sensitive to continue.  He didn’t pull away immediately, resting almost on top of Steve and breathing against the back of his neck.
Tony might have lost a few braincells thinking about what Steve had been up to prior to the serum to wind up loose and sloppy.  “You were a pretty little twink, weren’t you?” Tony guessed.  “Had a whole stable of men wanting to dress you up, make you call them daddy?”
Steve shucked his gloves off, throwing them at the feet of the waiting Iron Man suit.  "You want to feel me, hmm?"  Steve slid his hands down Tony's back to grab his ass two-handed, then lifted.  Obligingly, Tony wrapped his legs around Steve's waist.  Steve took two steps forward to press Tony's back into a concrete column.  "I should make you work for it," Steve whispered, his teeth closing on Tony's earlobe.  "Five minute delay for every ignored protocol in the battle."
"No..." Tony groaned.  "God, how are you still hard?"
“More experience with quickies, I guess.”  Tony returned the kiss and helped Steve straighten out his uniform.  “Are we going to the Tower, or SHIELD?”
Steve struggled out of his own clothes, clumsy in his eagerness.  (And if that clumsiness was both adorable and made Tony preen to know he was the cause of it?  He’d never tell.)  “If we got hotter with toys and games, we’d combust.”  Naked now, he flung the last of his clothes carelessly to the side and knelt on the bed, pinning Tony beneath him.  “You ever miss it?”
The first inch – that first stretch – God, Steve loved it.  He arched his back, taking more in with a deep groan.  Mindful of Tony’s concern, he didn’t rush to take all of Tony – though he wanted to.  Wanted to feel Tony’s cock deep inside him, claiming him completely.
Natasha laughed in delight.  “This is better than TV.”
“Okay, so what’s the cardinal rule?” Tony mumbled into Steve’s neck.
“Wrong on both accounts.”  Steve slid his arm around Tony.  “I blurted it out in the middle of an argument – ”
To his surprise, Steve tensed, groaned – and came.
The lightbulb went on in Tony’s head, and suddenly he wasn’t angry – or tired.  (Well, no.  He was still damned tired, but not too tired for this.)  “You fucking troll.”  He leaned in and kissed Steve, hard.  “Yeah.  Yeah, I can do that.”  He tangled a hand in Steve’s hair and tugged until Steve tilted his head back, exposing his neck.  “God, I didn’t know I needed this until right now.”
“Been a while since I saw you this nervous, boss,” Happy said from the front seat.
“You,” Tony retorted, his eyes sparkling.  “It’s always you.”  He rocked his hips against Steve’s, testing the waters.  He was sated enough from earlier not to have a specific desire… just a general need to be close to Steve.
Steve barked a laugh.  “God, am I that transparent?”
“I don’t hold with people talkin’ bad about my partner,” Steve shot back in the same tone.  “So mind your tongue.”
“I’d say anytime, but you’d take it as a challenge.”  She smiled.  “Goodnight, Captain Rogers.”
“ – didn’t mean to make it awkward.  I wish I could just give you what you need but I can’t pretend that I’m not in love with you anymore, Tony, I just – I just can’t.  I’m sorry.”
“Mmmhmm.”  Tony paused with his mouth hovering over Steve’s cock.  “You got a problem with that, soldier?  You wanted rough…”
Laughing, Steve rolled onto his side next to Tony.  “I think I can fit it in my schedule.”
Tony flushed.  “Can we keep this version of discipline between us?”
Steve’s hand stroked up and down his back.  “You’re not the only one who’s scared.”  He tilted his head to kiss Tony’s temple.  “What if what I want – need from you is forever?”
“What can I do?” Steve asked, rubbing Tony’s arms.
“You know, the… other stuff.  Toys.  Kink.”  Steve dipped down to nibble at the line of Tony’s neck.  “I know I’m not exactly the adventuresome type in bed.”
As soon as the doors closed behind Pepper, Tony was on Steve – kissing him hungrily, hands sliding under the t-shirt to feel the warm, broad back.  “Tell me you meant it, Steve.  Tell me – tell me you really want me.”
Tony pressed back into him, reaching to pull Steve’s arm tight around him.  “Rule three… being partners doesn’t… it doesn’t replace being teammates and friends.  Just… adds to it.”  He paused.  “Right?”
Rolling his eyes, Rhodey nodded.  “Fine.  Partner.”  For all his apparent irritation, there was a smile lurking.  “Now, if you’re done being an overdramatic ass, I’ve got a meeting with a General in – ” he glanced at his bedside table, “ – less than six hours.  Can I get some sleep, please?”
Steve laughed.  “Yeah, okay.  God, why am I arguing when the most beautiful man I know has my cock in his hand?”  Steve lifted a dripping hand to cup Tony’s cheek.  “I love you.”
“No, of course not.”  Tony wiggled experimentally.  Yeah, he’d be sore – but the good kind of sore, he thought.  “You okay?”
“Your forever is going to be a hell of a lot longer than mine.”
“I’m… you really scared me, Tony.”  He said it softly, almost too quietly to hear.  “And I wanted to be mad instead, because that was an easier thing to be than scared.”
“Traitor.”  Tony shot an amused look at one of the sensors in the elevator – just as he would have at a human eye.  Steve reflected again how very human Tony’s creations were and wondered how much of that was because their creator treated them as though they were human.  “I’ll settle for a kiss.”
Steve surged forward and seized the front of Tony’s undershirt and for one panicked moment, Tony was afraid.  Then the supersoldier yanked him close and latched their lips together.
“Traitor,” Tony hissed.
Tony groaned and thumped his forehead against Steve’s shoulder.  “No.”  He sighed.  “I’d kill for a cheeseburger.”
Steve grinned in satisfaction.  “Love to make you beg,” he murmured, swiftly kissing Tony on the lips before adding lube to his cock and settling between Tony’s legs.  “This what you want, doll?”  He teased the head of his cock against Tony’s entrance.
“Yeah.”  Steve pulled him closer, kissing him messily.  He was losing what control he had in the face of relentless tenderness, unable to continue to be stoic when basking in Tony’s warmth.  “God, you feel so good.”  He rolled his hips, taking Tony even deeper.
That desperate whine was enough for the supersoldier to lose control.  With one long moan he buried himself to the hilt in Tony, feeling his cock spurt as he spilled into his lover.  He reached for Tony’s cock but his touch wasn’t necessary – the friction between their torsos had been enough, and Tony came with a loud cry seconds after Steve had.
The breath caught in Tony’s chest, and he stared up at Steve like he’d never seen him before.  “I love you too,” he breathed.  “I might not say it often because it’s hard but – ”
“God, you never fucking listen!” Tony shouted, slamming the door shut behind him.  As soon as the door closed, he ordered the Iron Man suit to disengage.  He didn’t like arguing with Steve in it – well, he didn’t particularly enjoy arguing with Steve at all, but it was easier without adding ballistic armament to the discussion.
“Oh, hell – do that again.”  Tony’s fingers tightened in Steve’s hair.
“God, yes.”  Tony arched into Steve’s touch.  “More, baby, please.”
“Duly noted.”  Steve yawned.
“Can we – ” Steve gasped as Tony rubbed his thumb over the head of his cock, “Fuck, that feels good.  Can we not talk about your robotic children right now?”
Steve cupped his hands on Tony’s ass, chuckling as the engineer hummed in eager response.  “You wanna move this to the bedroom, doll?  This position is hard on your knees.”
In public.
“Now, please!” Tony begged, tugging at Steve’s hair.  “Need you, baby.  Please.”
“Fuck,” Steve groaned.  Tony would have grinned, if he hadn’t had his mouth full.  He hummed instead, which only made Steve tremble more.  Tony doubled down, swallowing around Steve’s length – and then braced himself and took the whole of him, down to the root.
Turning away, Steve sucked in a breath and forced it out, slowly.  “I just watched our team’s sniper sharpshooter fall off a really high drop in front of me, and I couldn’t get to him.”
“I’m working on that,” Tony promised.  He rolled over as well, so that they were facing each other.  “I think we need new rules… we broke all the old ones to hell.”
“Back with me?”  Steve ran a hand up and down his back.
Bracing himself on his toes, Steve pushed back against Tony, groaning.  “You can – ” he gasped “ – go harder.  Please.”
Tears spilled out as Tony nodded, unable to speak.  He met Steve’s kisses, his hands flat on the broad expanse of the supersoldier’s back, his legs curling around Steve’s thighs.  “I do,” he whispered back.  “Love you back, I mean.”
Tony latched one arm around Steve’s waist and held a coffee cup in the other.  It held the dual purpose of making it very clear that he was there as part of a couple, and it prevented people from shaking his hand.  It also was a good way to gauge Steve’s state of mind throughout the evening… which wasn’t positive.
Tony signed autographs too – allowed himself to be photographed, and said all the right things.  His mind wasn’t on it.  He wasn’t even thinking of what awaited them at home – of pinning Steve to the bed, maybe up against the wall – Tony was too caught up in the unfamiliar sensation of being cherished.
The supersoldier parried most of them easily.  Their fights were never really about brute strength – when Tony won, it was by tactical advantage.  Or because Steve wanted to be pressed into the mat by a sweaty Tony… thoughts of which distracted Steve long enough for Tony to land a hit to his face.
Tony did – and the clutch of his body around Steve tumbled him over the edge as well.  They clung together through the aftershocks, trading kisses as their heartrates evened out.  Steve was careful not to put too much weight on Tony’s chest, but he made no move to get off entirely – Tony had him wrapped up firmly.
“What happens if you break the rules?”
“I know, sweetheart.”  Steve nipped at his lower lip, then tenderly kissed the tears away from Tony’s eyes.
Steve reached across and took Tony’s hand.  “Relax, sweetheart,” he murmured.  “This is just two people who love each other very much having Italian food.”
Thor chuckled.  “A friendly wager, Steve – but one which we should like to cash out.  There has been a declaration of feelings, yes?  Who spoke first?”
Tony hummed impatiently, wandering around the room touching things.  Steve’s shield.  A pile of random tools culled from pockets when he’d undressed.  A framed sketch of himself with the bots that Steve had drawn.  “In case I forget to say it later… um.  Thanks.  For coming with me.”
“She apologized,” Tony demurred.
Laughing, Steve knelt over him, bending to press a kiss to Tony’s lips.  “I don’t need them either, sweetheart.  I’m just teasing.”  He kissed Tony’s neck, then proceeded down to his nipples.
“Trust me, Steve-o.  By the time you’re reaching for the fourth one, you’ll be cursing.”  Tony reached up to stroke Steve’s nipples, feeling Steve shiver at the touch.  “Got any special requests?  Beyond rough?”
“Ohmygod.”  Tony was backing away from him, panic stricken.  “Oh my god.  I hit you.”
By dinner, the supersoldier’s shoulders were rigid with tension.
“I don’t need any more incentive to – take care of you, baby.”  Tony dropped a kiss to the inside of Steve’s knee.  He’d almost said a forbidden word there, quickly stifled.  In deference to the tender tone he’d taken thus far, he worked Steve open slowly – all the way to four fingers.  By that point, the supersoldier was rocking against him, whimpering.
Steve noticed he hadn’t mentioned Bruce… the scientist’s reluctance to whole-heartedly support their relationship bothered Tony more than the engineer wanted to admit – and he wanted to distract his lover before he could get upset again.  “Did you catch this morning’s tune?” Steve whispered in Tony’s ear.  “He stopped so fast you might have missed it.”  He hummed a few bars, very softly, of ‘Going to the Chapel.’
“You had me at ‘we’,” Tony told him solemnly, and kissed him again.
“Need you,” Steve panted.  “Do it, Tony – please!”
“This isn’t really fair without the suit,” Tony protested as he stretched on the mats.  “I’m just going to get my ass handed to me.”
It was probably a good thing that no one else was in the communal kitchen upon his return to the Tower.  Steve’s foul mood only deepened as he thought about the implications of Fury’s comment.  Christ, it was no wonder Tony had such low self-esteem, if that was what Fury thought of him.
"Whoa, easy there, tiger," Tony gasped.
“You’re just going to leave me guessing?”
Tony sucked in a breath.  “Jesus.”  He fumbled at his tie, loosening it a little.  “You’re killing me, Steve.”
That’s all it took, and Steve’s hand tightened on his skull as orgasm seized him.  Even in the throes of it, Steve didn’t pull – just held on as his hips bucked and his cock pulsed.
Steve cupped his hand around the back of Tony’s head, stroking his hair.  “We really should go, sweetheart.”
Tony cupped a hand around his cheek, drawing him in for a kiss.  “Anything for the war effort.”
Fair point, Steve reflected as he slicked up his cock, but he was game for a challenge.  "Winner picks the movie tonight?"
“I’m so close, baby,” Tony breathed.  “Are you close?  Look at me, Steve – I want to see your face.”
“Yeah.”
It was so close to the line – that line they didn’t cross, words they didn’t say.  Tony nodded slowly.  “I’ll try.  Genuinely, honestly, legitimately try,” he promised.  His hand stroked Steve’s face, brushed back his hair.  “You’re sexy as hell when you’re that mad, and you just gave me the ride of my life… but I don’t like seeing you this scared, baby.”
“I’m pretty sure that’s my line here, sweetheart,” Steve protested, tucking Tony close to him.
“Just a towel,” Tony murmured.  “You don’t have to—”
Tony locked his legs around Steve's waist, the heel of one foot pressed into the flesh of Steve's ass.  "I appreciate."  His own orgasm had left him loose and relaxed -- and yeah, a little oversensitive, but he'd never stop Steve now.  "Come on, Cap -- give it to me."  He meant it to sound like a challenge -- instead, it was a plea.
“Mmmhmm.”  Steve’s foot moved higher.  “Good thing there’s these nice long tablecloths, isn’t it?  I mean… some people might even select a restaurant based on that.”  He leaned over the table.  “And maybe the fact that the bathroom is nearby – and has a lock.”
JARVIS was unfazed by his creator’s displeasure.  “Brian Banner was arrested but not convicted for the bludgeoning death of his wife, Rebecca.”
“I know that.”  Tony was already dressed, standing in front of a mirror trying not to obsess.  Was his pocket square symmetrical?  Shoes buffed perfectly?  Any hair out of place on his goatee?
Tony returned with his arms full – two steaming hot towels, a bottle of massage oil, and several dry towels.  He nudged Steve aside and laid out dry towels, then urged him back onto them on his stomach.  Carefully, Tony spread one hot towel across Steve’s shoulders and the second across hs ass and thighs.  “Just relax, baby,” Tony murmured, bending down to kiss Steve’s cheek.
Steve slid a hand around Tony’s neck and held him close, guiding the kiss with the pressure of his fingertips.  “I can do that,” he murmured when their lips parted, leaning his forehead against Tony’s.  “I will happily administer as many kisses as you want, love.”
Steve leaned closer.  "You'd like that, wouldn't you?" he asked, continuing the steady rhythm.  "Like it if I worked my way through the team?"
Tony blinked, his mouth half open – and then he started to laugh.  “You – what?  Steve, that’s the cardinal rule in the Tower, don’t drink my coffee.”
“Yup.”  Tony kissed his ass again, leaning in to do the same to the rim of his hole.  “I like to torment you, and it’s easier once you’ve had one good orgasm.  You’re so fucking tight, Steve.”  He returned his attention to the task at hand, licking and kissing as he fingered Steve open.  When he’d managed a second finger, he nudged in carefully and slid his tongue in as well.
“No.”  Steve put his arm around Tony’s shoulders, pulling him close.  “Not more than this.  I’m not gonna do that to the actors… they deserve to be the stars tonight.”
Steve rubbed his thumb in circles on Tony’s waist, turning to kiss his cheek softly.  “We were kind of blind to it ourselves until pretty recently.  I know when I started to have feelings – well.”  He shook his head.  “I didn’t think they’d ever be returned.  I’m… really happy to have been wrong about that.”
“Yeah.”  Tony smiled a little.  “But your Cap sensibilities are going to insist on doing the responsible thing.”
Tony was silent a long moment, his arm snug around Steve’s waist.  “Do we need to have a conversation?”
“Maybe.  Sure.”  Steve’s eyes were on him now, forcing him to maintain the gaze.  “You couldn’t have told me that in the field?  Let me send somebody with you?”
Tony grinned.  “Thought maybe you’d take a turn and fuck me.”
Seven wounded SHIELD agents and one that wouldn’t be going home – that meant that, left to his own devices, Steve wouldn’t leave the gym for at least eight hours.  Tony doubted that Steve realized he could be counted on to put in an hour for each casualty, but it was true – and JARVIS would corroborate it.
He wanted to argue the point, but it was difficult to keep his thoughts in order enough for that with Steve’s tongue on him.  Tony gasped as Steve added a hand to his other nipple, lightly rolling it between thumb and forefinger.
Steve turned to him, smiling.  “Right back atcha, love.”  He tossed his tie aside, followed with his jacket and shirt.  Belt and pants followed, until he stood in his undershirt and boxers.  “You’re overdressed for this party.”
Steve had no idea what he was even asking for – just trusting Tony to know, and to give it to him.  “Just… just… please.”
Desire shot through Tony, almost robbing him of breath.  “What do you say we get out of here, soldier?”
Tony gasped.  “God, don’t fucking call me that or this is going to be over too fast, and I really want to feel you come on my cock.”
Tony tried not to let the praise go to his head but… well, who was he kidding.  “They don’t call me a playboy for nothing.”  He trailed his fingers along Steve’s abs.  “I’m guessing from how you liked my fingers that you wouldn’t object to taking a ride.”
“Cute,” Rhodey drawled.  Tony startled – he’d forgotten the line was still active.  “I’m not done with you, Captain.”
Steve couldn’t maintain the slow pace forever, not with Tony making those gorgeous noises beneath him.  His breath caught on a particularly sharp thrust, feeling Tony shudder around him.  Steve shifted again, wrapping his hand around Tony’s cock.  He was hard and leaking precum.
“Deal.”  Tony nipped Steve’s bottom lip, grinning at the shiver it produced.  He shifted position again so that he was leaning over Steve, and started to nibble down his neck and chest.  He avoided the sensitive nipples for now, biting small marks down the center of Steve’s torso on his way to meet his hand on the supersoldier’s cock.
Captain America might not pout, but Steve Rogers was doing a hell of a job of it anyway.  “I don’t like it.”
“I know that,” Steve cut him off.  “Don’t mean I wouldn’t rather be there to stare ‘em down myself.  Even once I do put a ring on your finger… you’re irresistible, babydoll.  I can’t really blame ‘em for it.”  He grinned, using his hand to tip Tony’s face up to make eye contact.  “Think of it as payback to Pepper for insistin’ we go to ‘em.  Her choice – you not goin’, or us going and makin’ spectacles of ourselves.”
Finally dragging himself out of medical, Steve was almost surprised that Tony was still dogging his steps.  “You don’t have to stay.”
Laughing, Tony accepted the inevitable.  Sometimes he could manage to get Steve to shower afterwards – but times like this?  Waking up later, sticky, was a fair price to pay for cuddling an affectionately sleepy supersoldier.  Tony caught the edge of their duvet and pulled it around them.  A nap wouldn’t hurt anything, after all.  “Sweet dreams, sugar,” Tony whispered, and kissed Steve’s temple.
Steve slammed his hand into the door beside Tony’s head.  “Don’t.  Just – don’t.”
Once inside the room, Tony started to tug at his undersuit.  “Off with the clothes, Cap.  Can’t discipline you proper in your pajamas.  And who picked those out, you look ridiculous.”  He looked delicious, but Tony couldn’t say that.  That would break more rules than just fucking off the field.
Entering the gym, Tony had to appreciate the view Steve presented.  Grey sweat pants that clung to a trim waist, slid over a delicious ass and powerful thighs.  Sweat-soaked white t-shirt always purchased just a little too small (God bless JARVIS) to hug those obscenely broad shoulders, cup the well-developed pecs.  And God, those abs – Tony wanted to run his tongue over them like right now.
“I will be.”  Tony didn’t try to find his bravado – not at home.  Not with the team.  “I’m sorry you guys had to see – ”
“What do you think, doll?” Steve asked, pulling his tie loose.  “Did I earn a second date?”
“Yes, damn it!”  Tony wrapped his legs around Steve’s hips, pulling him closer.  “God, just fuck me already.”
“I don’t want it to get easier – I want it to stop.”  Steve would deny whole-heartedly that he was whining.
“Are you choosing that for your sake, or mine?” Tony asked with a knowing smile.
“Oh, you better believe it.”  Steve leaned forward, pinning Tony firmly against the door, and started thrusting.  He wasn’t holding back.  His hands were tight on Tony’s hips, creating leverage as he drove up into him.  Tony’s hands curled around his shoulders and dug in as the relentless thrusts sped up.  “What’s the golden rule, doll?”
“From the looks of it, I’m more okay with it than you are.”  Steve raised his hand, cupping it around Tony’s cheek.  “Why’s this bothering you so much, love?”
Already, Steve’s breathing was fast and headed towards thready.  Tony didn’t bother to slow down.  With his serum enhanced refractory period, it wasn’t unusual for Steve to hit three orgasms for every one of Tony’s.
“What?”  Startled, Tony slid forward until their knees touched.  “Why would you – no, Steve.  Jesus, is that why you looked like I was dragging you to the pyre?”
Prior to their renegotiation of the rules, that would have left Tony and Steve both a little… edgy.  No fighting meant no post-battle sex.
“Maybe.”  Tony wouldn’t argue that point – he’d never win.  Steve would and had take responsibility for the fate of the world.  “But that doesn’t change the fact that you’re still human.”  Tony gently kissed down the underside of Steve’s jaw, lightly tugging at his hair to better expose the neck.  “It is possible to commit no mistakes and still lose.  That is not weakness.  That is life.”
It was easy to figure out which hand was going to win.
The supersoldier kissed him again, sweetly.  “Come for me, babydoll.”
Tony flickered his eyes around the room before stepping closer to Steve.  “You want to get out of here?”
“Tony.”  Steve lifted his hands to hold Tony’s where they were tying his tie.  “I could not care less what the press or the public say about us.  I want to take my partner out and show him a good time – then I’m hoping he’ll let me bring him home, invite him up for a night cap and a roll in the hay.”
Pepper Potts strode out of the elevator, dressed immaculately in a white designer suit.  Her heels clicked on the hardwood floor, demanding answers before she’d even spoken.  “Since when does JARVIS hold me in the elevator, Tony?”
“I know this is going to come as a surprise, but I don’t actually expect sex from you all the time,” Steve said, kissing his neck again.  “I just like to touch you.  Do you want me to stop?”
“Baby, for you, there aren’t many ‘-ist’s I’m not willin’ to try.”  Steve propped his head up on his elbow, gazing across the table at Tony.  “Too bad people would notice if I slipped under the table… I’d like to suck you off right here in front of God and everyone, see if you can keep quiet while I take you apart.”
“Nice to see you have such faith in my dating ability, sweetheart.”  Steve released Tony’s hand to slide his arm around the engineer’s slender waist instead.  “Granted, I’m a bit out of practice – but I ain’t doing so bad.  Maybe it just takes havin’ the right partner.”
“Not gonna really hit you, baby,” Tony warned, but he brought his hand down again – more noise and sting than anything, the kind of slap he’d do on the bare shoulder of a teammate.
"I was in the fuckin' army, Tony," Steve reminded him.  He'd have snapped his hips forward but -- despite being hard enough to pound nails -- he didn't want to hurt Tony.  "You feel so good."  The words were inadequate to describe the sensation.  He leaned forward until he could wrap one arm around Tony's waist, propping himself up with the other.
“So demanding,” Steve chuckled, letting the head push past the rim but no further.  Tony growled, low in his chest.  He started wriggling, trying to force more of Steve’s cock into him but the supersoldier held him firm.  “Don’t rush me, doll.  You’ll get what you need, I promise.”  He pressed forward slowly – so slowly – sinking his cock into Tony at an agonizing pace.  They were both panting and desperate when was fully seated, but Steve didn’t immediately move again.  “I love you,” he whispered into Tony’s ear.
“I can get behind that idea,” Steve agreed, smiling.  “Burger and fries, and maybe a shake?”  He ran his hand up and down Tony’s back.  “Any other takers?”
His orgasm wasn’t the fiery burst he was used to, but a slow and almost agonizing roll.  It went on longer than he expected, until Steve was limp and satiated.  Tony chuckled, leaning in to kiss him again.  “Good?” he asked, easing his finger out of Steve.
“Someday, I’m going to tell the press you’re a cuddler,” Tony threatened.
“Now who’s being a romantic sap?” Steve teased, sliding his hands up Tony’s sides and catching the hem of his shirt.
“Other than me?” Tony flinched away from him.
“You’ll get more, baby, I promise.”  Tony kissed one ass cheek, resting there briefly while he worked that single finger in to the second knuckle.  “You know it’s good when I go slow.  Be patient.”
"Can I?" Tony chuckled breathily.  "Can you?"
He might once have protested against being manhandled like this, but Tony loved the way Steve could move him.  “It’s mutual,” Tony whispered up at Steve.  “You’ve got me, too.”
That hurt too.  “So… you just decided to come out to the paparazzi, tank SI’s stock, put the Avengers in the news as some sort of gay cult, and… neglect to tell me?”
Anger flickered over Steve’s face, brutally stifled.  “You didn’t do anything wrong,” he said after a moment, tucking Tony just a little closer to him.
“No game.”  Tony had to set down the tea kettle.  His hands were shaking too much to keep from spilling.  “No angle.  Is it really that hard to believe I might – that he might – there might be something real there?”  He was grateful to have a reason not to look up at her – couldn’t bear the look he knew she’d be giving him.
Something swooped in Tony’s stomach and he ignored it.  “I got you,” he promised softly.  Leaning forward, he pressed his chest against Steve’s back.  The hand he’d used to slap slid around to Steve’s cock, grasping it firmly.  “This what you need, baby?”  Another nod, this one accompanied by a groan.  “God, you’re so hard again.  God bless America.”
“Yep.”  Tony leaned into Steve’s chest.  “Agent cleaned up in the betting pool, apparently.  Natasha thinks we’re adorable.”
“Yeah, but you and I both know that’s not why you listen to me.”  Steve sighed.  “I’m not sure I even know why you listen.”
He wasn’t the only one frustrated by the downtime.  They were used to a certain level of activity, and though a few days of rest was nice… two weeks was a long time.  To alleviate boredom and hopefully prevent mayhem, Steve scheduled several practice sessions for the six of them.
Steve slung his arm around Tony’s waist as they got in the elevator.  “Hm.  I’d say it was an insufficient data set, doll.  Might have to repeat the experiment.”
“Yeah.”  Tony wound the fingers of his right hand into Steve’s hair.  As many positions and varieties as they’d tried, Steve had always been careful to avoid the arc reactor.  “Just… be careful?”
“What about you, Tony?” Natasha asked, startling him out of a doze.
“Caffeine is not suggested following an anxiety attack, Sir,” JARVIS interjected.
“I know.”  Tony shifted a little, feeling Steve’s cock hard against him.  “But just because I’m not in the game doesn’t mean you can’t be.”
“I don’t want space, Steve, I want you,” Tony whispered into Steve’s neck.
“Yeah,” Tony groaned.  “Yeah, ditto.”  He hooked one leg around Steve’s hips, pressing his heel into Steve to keep him close.  “Give it to me, Rogers.”
The rippling clutch of Tony’s ass around him was enough to send Steve over the edge as well, and he flooded Tony with come.  He kept thrusting until they both were too sensitive to continue, then held himself on a trembling arm above his lover, pressing sloppy kisses to his face.
“Do you think I don’t know that?”  Tony shook his head.  “He says – he says it doesn’t matter.  That I’m…”
Steve nodded pliantly, letting Tony tug him in through the living room and to his penthouse bedroom.  Steve had never been in it – somehow, that seemed important.
Steve tugged Tony to a standing position, then cupped his face with both hands and kissed him.  “Deal.”  He pressed their foreheads together again, just for a breath.  “I love you, Anthony Stark.”
“Yes I am.”  Steve pulled away carefully, tactfully ignoring Tony’s wince.  His lover would pay for those minutes of ecstasy, but neither of them would regret it.  “How do you want me?”
Tony slid his eyes sideways at his partner.  “Do you mind, baby?”
“Yes, sir.”  Steve set a steady rhythm, punctuating it with deep kisses.  It was a leisurely build-up, this time – not hurtling towards the precipice at top speed, but allowing it to build gradually.  Steve propped himself up on one hand (which had the added advantage of making his biceps flex in a way he knew Tony appreciated) so that he could reach between them and grasp Tony’s cock, adding to the sensations.
Tony beat him there by scant seconds, his body tightening around Steve’s cock as his own spurted between them.  The sensation pushed Steve over the edge and he spilled into Tony, filling the absolutely maddening man with his seed.
“Kinda fond of that myself.”  Steve laid Tony on his back on the broad mattress, hands gentle.  “I’d like to have you first… if that’s okay?”
Steve lightly licked along the scar tissue.  “I don’t need that as proof.  You show me a thousand ways a day how much heart you have.”  He kissed across to Tony’s nipple, nibbling gently.
Steve moaned, his hands fisting in the bedsheets.  “Fuck, you feel so good.”
“I’ve got a mouth like a sailor, it’s not hard,” Tony snarked – but sighed in pleasure as Steve started to work his fingers in and out.  “Feels good, baby.  God, your fingers are just – you’re so fucking deft.”
“I’ll let you two talk.”  Steve rose, ignoring the scathing look Pepper gave him.  “I’ll just be down the hall in the studio, doll… have JARVIS buzz me if you need me, alright?”  He ignored Pepper right back, brushing his fingers over Tony’s cheek.
Steve bit his lip.  “Take me?”
Tony shrugged a little.  “I’m working on it.”
Steve smiled.  “Later.  Night’s still young.”  He shooed Tony away.
“Don’t mind if I do.”  Steve set an almost brutal pace, his thighs flexing as he rose and fell on Tony’s cock, panting and keening.  “Feel like – like you’re made for me.”  He ground down, taking Tony as deeply as he could.
Steve’s lips curved against Tony’s skin.  “Thank you following rule one so well, babydoll.”  He used his thumbs to stroke whatever skin he could reach without loosening his hold on Tony.  “Just because this all started with sex doesn’t mean that’s all I want from you.”
Chuckling, Tony stroked the small of his back lightly.  “You’re not in charge right now, Cap.”  Steve groaned beneath him, and Tony gave in – a little.  He sped up his pace some, though it was still slower than Steve wanted.
Steve grinned, kissing him fiercely as he fumbled in the bedside table for lube.  “Can’t give you more than my everything, sweetheart.”  He returned to Tony’s side with slick fingers, nudging his way between Tony’s knees.  “Open up for me, gorgeous.”
“And then sex after?”
“I like this plan.”  Steve kissed Tony’s abdomen one more time before pulling away, moving to the nightstand to dig for lube.  Half a moment later he’d returned with slick fingers, carefully easing two into Tony.
“There is nothing I will not do to keep him safe and happy.  Do you understand me?”  Rhodey leaned forward, his eyes intent.  “I do not care about your rank or your enhancements.  If you leave him broken, there will be nowhere safe for you to run.  Is that clear?”
Steve shifted, sinking down to his knees between Tony’s knees, the better to put them at eye level.  “What do you want tonight, babydoll?” Steve asked in a low voice.  He cupped a hand around Tony’s cheek, leaning in to kiss him.
“Sorry.”  Steve closed his eyes and leaned into Tony’s hand.  “You want I should go?”
Tony chuckled and kissed Steve’s neck again.  “You’ve got a safeword, sweetheart.  I didn’t hear you use it.”
Naked now, Tony sat down on the edge of the bed to watch Steve.  “You’re beautiful,” he murmured.  “Not just your body – although, hello, duh! – but you have the most expressive eyes.”  Tony held out his hands for Steve, who came to him willingly.  “I could get lost in them.”
“Hey, soldier,” Tony said from a safe six feet away.  “You gonna bang on that bag all night, or can I interest you in a suitable substitute?”
Steve bit back a remark about how lovely that ass was, considering all of them were in the gym.  “Humor me.  I’d like you to spar with Clint.  I’ll pair with Bruce – Thor can work with Natasha.”
Neither of them spoke the remainder of the flight – and when they landed at the Tower, Steve carried Tony off the QuinJet and up to the penthouse without another word.
Tony rocked his hips against Steve’s hand, wanton and desperate.  It took so little for him to be out of his mind with lust for Steve – had since the very beginning.  Speaking openly of their emotions had only added to that.
“Yeah,” Steve sighed.  “Always like it when you make love to me, babydoll.”  He spread his legs wider, propping his head on his hands to get a better view.
"Your uniform should be fucking illegal," Tony groaned, dropping his head forward onto Steve's shoulder for a moment before shifting to seize Steve in a fierce kiss.  It was desperate and possessive, and spoke of emotions that neither of them would voice.  "Goddamn it, Steve, did you have to fucking crouch there like that?"  Steve had been bent over a captive for a good ten minutes interrogating him before releasing the man to SHIELD custody -- long enough to give everyone a very thorough view of that glorious ass.
Steve looked up – their teammates were sitting on the mats about twenty feet away… trying not to watch them.  “They looked worried about you, love.”
Steve detested these private briefings with Fury – a bi-weekly ‘discussion’ of Avengers missions, personnel, and expectations that always left a bad taste in his mouth.
Tony scrabbled for purchase on the concrete, instinctively shifting his weight to give Steve better access. "Fuck, I love it when you do that."  Steve hummed in acknowledgement which just made it hotter.  His tongue flickered in small, kittenish licks before he settled in, thrusting his tongue deep into Tony.  Steve kept his cheeks spread with both hands, using only his mouth on Tony's hole.  He licked and sucked and kissed like a starving man -- like it had been months since they'd done this.  "God, Steve, please -- " Tony gasped.  "More."
He hadn’t actually intended that to be in relation to their dalliances, but… well, this worked too.  Steve carefully squeezed lube onto his fingers and eased two into Tony’s tight passage.  They’d made love the night before, so Tony was partially stretched – enough not to have to be too gentle.  “Wanna make you swear, babydoll.”
“Since I’m not the only one living here, Pep.”  Tony closed his hand around Steve’s.  “It’s not fair to have you barge in on Steve.”
“Oh, yeah,” Tony moaned, rocking his ass back to meet Steve’s touch.  “Just – just move your hand a little faster – ”  Steve did, and a scant few seconds later Tony was cursing and writhing, spilling come onto the wall and floor.  Steve was only a thrust or two slower – the rippling of Tony around his cock was too much for him.
Tony briefly considered making a run for it – except that would likely only compound things.  He was vaguely aware of the rest of his teammates making themselves scarce – traitors.  He’d have to face the Captain’s wrath on his own, then.  Looking around, he tried to find a section of the semi-destroyed street that would give them at least a little privacy… because he didn’t particularly relish this conversation being filmed by passersby.
“God, you’re sexy when you’re determined,” Tony blurted out.
“Fuck,” Tony groaned.  “God, I forget every time how fucking good at that you are.”
Well, if wearing this suit got Tony that hot… Steve would wear it a lot.  “I spent a lot of time getting’ it right, doll,” Steve deflected the wandering hands with another laugh.
“You, Steven Grant Rogers, are a fucking troll.”  Tony tried to sound irritated and missed the mark entirely.
“The nickname.  Like it,” Tony repeated, rocking against Steve.
“You’ll want to handle this one personally,” Steve promised.  He stepped closer to Tony.  “I’m afraid I drank all the coffee in your workshop.”
It probably wasn’t smart to say it, but… “I’m not so tired I want to watch you hurt yourself, sweetheart.”  Tony carefully worked a third finger into Steve, smoothing his free hand down Steve’s side when the supersoldier bucked against him.  “I know the serum would heal you, that doesn’t mean I want you to hurt.”
Steve considered that seriously.  “I think I’d like you to make love to me,” he decided finally.
“Yeah,” Tony breathed when they broke apart.  “Okay.  Bed?”
“Not gonna pretend otherwise.”  Steve grinned against Tony’s lips, then hoisted the smaller man up into the air, guiding his legs around him.  “Did you really want to top, or were you just pullin’ my leg?”
“Sure,” Tony sighed into the kiss.
“Cap.”  Tony inserted himself in Steve’s pace path.  “He’s gonna be fine.  At worst, it’s a broken leg.  Chances are he just sprained the hell out of it.”
Tony turned wild eyes on him.  “We went out on a date.  In public.  But.  We didn’t tell Pepper.  Or Rhodey.  Oh my God.”  He sucked in a breath.  “Pepper’s going to fucking murder me.”
Steve scooped Tony up into his arms.  “The real thing,” he agreed.  “Long haul.  Forever and a day.”  He carried Tony towards the bedroom.  “And right now, I want to make love to my partner – because this time I don’t have to pretend I’m okay with just fucking you.”
Steve did – fiercely.  For more reasons than Tony’s undersuited-clad body.  (God, Steve loved that undersuit.)  “I can’t.”
“Every minute of every day,” Steve promised.  His kisses shifted from Tony’s lip to his neck, where he duplicated the mark Tony’d left on him.  This one would last longer than an hour, they both knew – and Steve reveled in leaving this sign of possession on his lover.
Tony had chosen to ride back with them rather than take the suit.  Steve slid his arm around Tony’s waist as the others talked.  Natasha seemed to be arguing for a different film genre.  Bruce protested Thai and suggested Indian instead, but was mollified by Thor’s suggestion that they just order both.  None of them mentioned their co-leaders cuddling… and Tony was pretty sure it counted as cuddling, considering he was nearly asleep on Steve’s shoulder.
“There’s just one other thing.”
Tony blew a raspberry.  “Bullshit.  I like making you feel good.”  He twisted so that he could face Steve, their legs tangling together in the bathwater.  “This is a case where you should learn to just accept what I give you gracefully.”  He reached for Steve’s cock, bobbing in the water.
“Only for you,” Steve promised, groaning a little as he forced a second finger inside.
Chuckling, Tony obliged.  He kept to small kitten licks, reveling in the sounds Steve made.  Then he remembered Steve’s earlier request for rough, and caught the nipple between his teeth, biting down.
Feeling a strange fluttering in his heart, Steve nodded slowly.  “Yeah, okay.  I promise.  I’ll follow it if you do.”  He freed a hand and used it to lift Tony’s chin so they could kiss again.
“Now that’s taking rule two just a little too far, don’t you think?”
Steve rose and padded on bare feet to stand behind Tony, wrapping his arms around the smaller man.  “I’ll give you two privacy if you want it, but I’m not leaving.”  He kissed the side of Tony’s neck.  “This is at least partly my fault, I’m not going to leave you to take all the blame.”  He reached into the drawer and pulled out one of his replica SSR shirts, handing it to Tony.  “I’m pretty sure bailing on you now violates the partner code of conduct at the very least – and probably the friend one, too.”
“Name it.”
As parting lines went, it wasn’t awful.  Not as powerful as it could have been, but Steve didn’t dare try to think of something better… he was already vibrating with the need to get away from Fury and get home.
Tony grinned in triumph.  He wasn’t working at the best angle, but apparently he’d hit the mark.  Victorious, he gently massaged Steve’s prostate as his other hand worked rhythmically up and down Steve’s frankly beautiful cock.  “It was your shoulders, for me,” he admitted.  Tony leaned in to kiss Steve deeply.  “I’d watch you in the gym, and see those broad muscles – God bless America.”
"Good."  Tony let the suit envelop him.  "Climb on."  Steve clambered up again.  "Let's just hope we don't interrupt anyone else's... disciplinary action."
“They aren’t surprised,” Tony said blankly to Steve.  “Baby, why aren’t they surprised?”
Tony nuzzled into Steve’s neck, sucking a mark that wouldn’t last an hour.  “Dealer’s choice.”
“No, but you beg real pretty when I go slow.”  Steve shifted his lips back to Tony’s neck, nibbling there.  He edged lower so that he could leave a mark – biting and sucking until a nice purple circle remained.  All the while he was probing with two thick fingers, searching for that spot that would make Tony arch up into him.
“How are you better at this than I am?” Tony hissed.  “I grew up in the spotlight, I should be – ”
“I really, really hate being called Anthony.”
Tony was done waiting.  He rolled his hips and forced himself onto Steve’s cock, moaning as the head crested that first right of muscle.  “More,” he demanded, his arms coming up around Steve.  His hands pressed flat to the back of Steve’s shoulders.  “God, Steve – I want more.”  He wriggled, trying to force Steve’s cock deeper.
“Yes, sir.”  Steve pressed a kiss to the center of the arc reactor, making Tony’s breath hitch again.  “This keeps you safe for me,” he murmured.  “Sure, it lets you run the suit and that’s amazing but – that isn’t what I adore about it, doll – it keeps you alive.”  Steve stroked his fingertips along the scars.
“I need you to understand that,” Steve continued, licking Tony’s ear softly.  “I can’t – I can’t lose you too.”  Tony’s eyes widened, gaping at him, utterly at a loss for words.  “You got that, Tony?”
“There wasn’t time—”
Tony's eyes burned but he refused to acknowledge it.  He fisted his hands on the ground to prevent him from reaching for Steve, but it didn't matter.  Steve was pressing into him again, covering him with that star-spangled body.
“That will be all, Miss Potts,” he answered automatically.  “And Pep?  Thanks.”
“No.”  Tony leaned in to kiss him again.  “I don’t think so.  That’s not what I want, anyway.”  His face shifted, showing his inner vulnerability.  “Unless you…”
Tony coughed.  “Alright.  Eight.  But you’ve got to maintain… we’ve still got that show to make it through.  Who knows, you could bomb miserably.”
“I’ll deal with you in a minute, Captain.  Tony…” Rhodey’s voice was firm.  “Do I need to have a chat with Pepper?”
“No, I’m okay, honestly.”  Tony wiped at his eyes.  “Those were good tears.  Also tears of relief, because Pepper just left and she was… well, she was pissed.”  Tony looked down.  “I didn’t mean to leave you guys out, I just… got caught up.”
Steve propped himself up on one arm to free the other, stroking Tony’s cheek lightly.  But no tenderness could stall their lust for long – not that Steve would want it to.  He pulled out almost entirely before thrusting in again, feeling Tony rock on the mattress beneath him.  “Say it again.”  He tried to command it, but his words were more of a plea.
“Maybe.”  Tony plucked at the fabric of Steve’s pajamas.  “She was pretty upset.”  And she’d upset him as well – but Tony didn’t see any reason to tell Rhodey that.
“Do you want me to…” Tony gestured vaguely.
“Baby, if you suck me again I’m – ” Tony caught his breath as Steve’s tongue flickered in his navel.  “Please, I want to come with you inside me, please.”
“That’s more your gig than mine, Spangles—”
“My brain doesn’t.  My heart is fucking terrified.”
In answer, Steve rolled them over until Tony was pinned beneath him.  “No.  I know how you feel about conversations,” he teased, nipping at Tony’s neck.
Tony groaned, his hand cupping the back of Steve’s neck.  “Vampire.”
"Tower."  Steve ran a hand through his hair.  "I'd like to get cleaned up."
“Yeah,” Tony agreed, leaning his head back against the door.  “Not too – not dry, or anything.”
Pepper looked between them, her brain working quickly.  “I’ll call in the morning.”  She leaned over and kissed Tony’s cheek.  “Will that be all, Mister Stark?”
“No…” Tony said hesitantly.  “Just us.”  He paused.  “Just me.  I mean.  You’re… um.  She didn’t order you to go.  I… was assuming… hoping you’d… go as my partner?”
Satisfied with that answer, Steve bent to his task with the same focus he used on the battlefield.  Every inch of Tony’s crotch was kissed and licked.  To Tony’s surprise and Steve’s evident delight, the engineer’s cock began to respond.  “Told you,” Steve smirked as he mouthed the swelling member.
They waited a minute or two before the call connected.  “Martini,” Rhodey said immediately, “tell me this isn’t another Bain or Stone.  I don’t want to have to kill Captain America.”
“Now who’s being a sap?”  Steve stood between Tony’s knees, his hands coming to rest on the engineer’s shoulders.
If Tony had a dollar for every time he’d heard somebody in his life say ‘Damn it, Tony’ in that defeated tone, he’d have been – well, a hell of a lot richer than he already was.
“I don’t need – ”
Steve’s cheeks heated.  “You’re in mine.”  He stepped closer to Tony, touching his finger to the blue suit fabric, immaculate white shirt, and red pocket square.  “I think I like it.”  He leaned in to press a kiss to Tony’s lips.
"Deal.  Now please..."
Steve eyes opened and he met Tony’s gaze, expression tender.  “Feeling’s mutual, doll.”  He slid his hand up Tony’s chest, resting lightly on the arc reactor showing through the thin fabric of the SSR shirt.
Steve chuckled and dug for his utility belt and the handy package of wet wipes.  He handed Tony one and took one for himself.  “At least we’re off the street.”  He glanced around the tiny shopping kiosk – not much to speak of, but at least it provided some privacy.
“And bed.  For both of us,” Tony added, when Steve raised a disbelieving eyebrow at him.  “I’ll make you a deal.  I won’t disappear into the workshop tonight if you come to bed with me.  We don’t have to sleep, just…”
That was a fair point – Steve knew Tony would never push him past that limit.  Maybe he’d been right about the denial.  He found himself leaning back into the smaller body behind him, tipping his head back to rest against Tony’s.
The young woman flushed – most did, when faced with a smiling Steve Rogers.  “The cast would like to invite you to meet them backstage, if you’re… interested?”
“Nat and I have this rule,” Clint interrupted.  “No apologizing for what was done to you.  That includes whatever gives you nightmares or panic attacks.”
Rhodey clearly could see it in Tony’s posture, and Steve’s estimation of the man grew several orders of magnitude when he nodded slowly.  “I’ll call her.”  He paused, and when he spoke again it was very gentle – almost as one would address a frightened child.  “What did she say, sting ray?”
“Damned right.”
“I like the fucking.”
Steve pulled back to stare down at Tony.  “What the hell do you have to be insecure about?”
“Visiting the bots,” Steve answered automatically, though he was pretty distracted by Tony’s hand.
“So good,” Tony moaned.  “God, Steve – how is it always so good?”
Tony lifted a hand to Steve’s face, cupping his chin gently and drawing him in for a soft, chaste kiss.  “You are edible, love.”
“I don’t know if it’s stupid or not.”  Tony leaned into Steve’s embrace, tilting his head up for a kiss.  “But I guess it doesn’t matter – it just is.  I promise that I’ll tell you in the extremely unlikely event that I’m unsatisfied in the bedroom.”
He moved on to the next item on his agenda, a thorough exploration of Steve’s pecs and nipples with his tongue.  At some points, Steve would be so sensitive that the bare touch of tongue or teeth on a nipple could send him headlong into orgasm.  That didn’t seem to be the case tonight – or maybe Tony was just being gentler.  He laved each nipple with careful passes of his tongue, pausing to lightly suckle at each nipple.  Steve moaned and one hand came up to cup Tony’s head – a hand that was quickly pulled away.  “It’s okay, baby.  You can touch,” Tony assured him before returning to Steve’s nipple.
“Please.”
Stalking towards him like a colossal star-spangled lion.
Eventually they got their breath back – though it wouldn’t have taken as long, if they’d been able to stand to stop kissing.  Steve pulled away carefully, feeling his come immediately start to leak out of Tony.  “You want a shower, or just a wipe down?” Steve asked, slipping off the bed.
No sooner had they landed than the Iron Man armor started to peel back from Tony, revealing him in the tight black undersuit.  Steve growled, low in his throat, and reached for Tony.  "Already hard for me?" Steve murmured, letting a gloved hand slide down the black fabric to the bulge of Tony's arousal.
“I really don’t care.”  Tony hooked a leg around the back of Steve’s thigh to pull him close.  “Thirty seconds or an hour, it’s all good.  Just want you.”
Steve leaned close to whisper in his ear.  “Yeah?  You factor the bathroom into that ranking?”
“No, I don’t.”  Tony stroked Steve’s cheek, amused when the supersoldier made a purring noise.  His big jungle cat, tamed by a simple stroke.  “I’m sorry for how you found out, Pepper.”  He didn’t look at her again, had eyes only for Steve.  “I’m not sorry we went out on an amazing date.  And I’m really, entirely, most definitely not sorry about loving Steve.”  He stretched up until he could kiss the underside of Steve’s jaw.  “I think he might be the best thing to ever happen to me.”
“Ungh… yes, please,” Steve panted.
Steve laughed.  “Alright, I yield.”  He leaned up to press a kiss to those maddening lips.  “Not in the bath though, alright?  Let’s get clean and then go to bed.”  Shower – or bath – sex sounded fun, but in reality there were usually banged elbows and cold drafts.
“Really?”  Tony raised an eyebrow, rubbing his thumb over the head of Steve’s cock as he carefully worked one finger into his hole.  Under water it wasn’t easy to do… and for some reason they hadn’t invested in waterproof lube yet.  Tony didn’t worry too much about it though – he wasn’t going to use more than a finger.  He just wanted to be able to find Steve’s prostate.
(Tony would never admit how much he’d needed that approval.)
“God, yes.”  Tony squirmed a little, making Steve moan into his mouth.  His arms came up to hold Steve tight.  “Just – just stay there a minute, baby.  Please.”
“It is my pleasure, Sir.”  There was a loaded pause.  “Perhaps you would consider listening to – and answering – your voice messages.”
The fighting wasn’t anything spectacular.  Bruce refused to shift into Hulk – and he was not well suited to sparring otherwise.  Thor was holding back against Natasha out of some misguided sense of chivalry… despite being fully aware that Natasha would kick his ass for it (and Sif would help).  Clint seemed to enjoy taunting Tony more than teaching him.  After ten minutes, Steve called a halt.
(Steve would never have forgiven Bruce if he’d withheld it.)
They rocked together a moment or two longer, Steve’s motions growing slower and smaller as his breath calmed.  He leaned down, resting some of his weight on Tony, and kissed him.  Tony stroked the blond hair back from his forehead.  “You didn’t come,” Steve mumbled into Tony’s neck.
“Easy there, darlin’,” Steve laughed breathlessly.
“No… sir.”
“He’s just surprised, love,” Steve said in a low voice, glancing at Bruce.  “He’ll come around.  Look how long it took us to wrap our heads around it.  We can give him a pass for a little bit, yeah?”  He lifted his hand and stroked Tony’s cheek.  “Rule two, doll.  This time I’m citin’ it, and I mean it.  We ain’t got nothin’ to be ashamed of, sweetheart, and I ain’t hidin’ this from our family.”
