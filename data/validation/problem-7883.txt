Even though he didn’t mean to flare out his wings consciously, they knew what his heart desired. He had never fully presented intentionally for anyone in his life but the truth is he really wanted to for Steve. But someone like Tony Stark does not deserve someone like Steve Rogers, wings or no wings, he deduced that out even from the few days he had known the blond so what Steve said about Tony was true. Also there was no denying the fact that he was going to die, there is no point in leading him on.
“Wow buddy you getting old there?” he said with a smirk while saving all the work and closing the projections.
“Congratulations pepper” Steve couldn’t help but smile back. She was clearly happy as she deserved to be.
‘Do you believe Pepper Potts is qualified to be CEO?’
"It doesn't matter he will never, who in their right mind would" Tony laughed one of his self-deprecating laughs that everybody who actually likes him hates to see.
Steve was silent on the passenger seat and things were getting pretty awkward.
“The arc reactor is a power source that keeps the shrapnel in Mr. Stark’s chest from shredding his heart”
I love hearing from you guys always.
The other man didn’t even wait for a reply; he just strode out through the door as if he owned the place. Steve was positively confused with everything that was happening but he was sure of one thing that all this is going to end up in a killer headache for him.
(See the end of the chapter for
Bucky looked like he was about to cry but nodded and returned to the living room instead.
He still wasn’t sure about his boss hating him for having no wings as the man himself tried to avoid any topic remotely relating to them like a cat that saw water.
“Look Greg I’m sorry, I didn’t see you coming okay” normally on any other day Steve would fight back until both or one of them (usually Steve) was left bloody or broken nosed or until Bucky came up to break up the fight but today he had places to be.
“So how soon can you start working Mr. Rogers?” she asked while carefully placing all the papers inside the portfolio and stood up.
“It’s nice to meet you meet you Mr. Rogers, feel free to ask for whatever you require” JARVIS replied in a very polite tone that Tony didn’t remember programming into him. The genius smirked when he saw the blonds eyes go wide and scan the room for the source of the voice.
“I shall ask right away Mr. Rogers” Steve just stood there waiting looking at the ceiling and pulling at the hem of his jacket not knowing what else to do. A few minutes later JARVIS called his name not to startle Steve and get his attention but Steve jumped anyway.
Tony laughed at that and brought the half- filled glass to his face and watched the light reflect off the liquid. Half of him wanted to smash it across the wall and never touch it again and the other half wanted to drown the entire bottle.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
After a while he realized that Steve had fallen asleep and carefully lay him down on the bed.
“What?” that was a chorus from both a surprised Happy and Steve.
Steve Rogers was not the first man that Tony had seen without a pair flying appendages. Yinsen didn’t have any but they were broken off by the terrorists that imprisoned them. The other few people he came across had lost theirs because of grave accidents. Then why was this five foot five, gawky man bothering him? May be a small part of him; the same part that would tell him that his own soul was broken and tainted, believed it too.
On her walk back to the car, she thought of Stark. They had to deliver the things they found from the archives tomorrow along with the antidote. Even if she loathe to agree it, Steve was a good friend perhaps her only friend in the outside world so if anybody hurts him……..…Nat was ready to cut a bitch.
The next few weeks were all sorts of torture. Tony made himself scarce from anywhere the other Avengers might be and busied himself with SI and his own projects. Natasha was glaring daggers whenever he happened to cross her path of sight and had to physically shoo her away whenever she suggested surgery. Bruce and Clint tried coaxing him to go out with everyone with various offers ranging from food to science. Pepper and Rhodey were worried and constantly tried to get him to talk. The worst was Steve who would throw worried or sad glances at Tony whenever he resurfaced from his self-allotted exile. In the meantime Tony was coughing up a full-fledged flower assortment in his workshop. Slightly blood stained complete camellias and a new addition of rose petals were all over the floor and breathing was getting difficult by the day. Okay maybe he was dying now.
The other man closed his eyes and let out a loud huff “I understand you might think this is all shady but it’s how we operate but don’t you think something similar is going on with Mr. Stark”
Steve's lips.
He held out the coffee, which tony accepted gratefully looking at Steve like he was his sun, moon and stars. His throat was burning with that familiar itch and he willed himself not to cough in front of everyone.
Such, in the fond illusion of my heart
To Steve’s surprise the red head smiled “Very observant, I can see why he’s gone on you” the smile turned into a smirk.
“Wait, where are you?”
When he fell, he fell fast and hard. So the hopeless romantic sap part of him was always intrigued by Hanahaki, he found it tragically romantic but always prayed no one had to suffer too much.
“Good luck Steve” Sam said smiling up at him from the car.
“Whatever you think I did, I didn’t do it” he turned around blurted out before Pepper could say anything. She gave him a confused tilt of her head and immediately shook it off, already done with Tony’s antics for the day.
The genius kept reassuring him every chance he got but Steve just kept muttering he was fine and would like to go home. He refused to look at the very worried brunette during the whole journey back but Tony equally reused to leave his side. If it were anyone else Steve would be feeling claustrophobic instead with Tony he oddly felt safe but would loathe to admit it out loud.
“I’m gonna be a dick again and ask you to pack up for tomorrow” he looked to Steve’s face bracing himself for an outburst but the blond didn’t even bat an eyelash “Where are we going?” he asked instead.
"I'm assuming you didn't eat flowers for breakfast" she said in a rather clipped tone as she strode in.
She had long ago learned not to judge people by how they look (comes with the job really). She approached Steve with something she had never done before in her life- no expectations. He had already agreed to pass on any information so there was no need for her to pretend that she was someone else other than Natasha Romanoff even if it was too early to divulge that little bit of information.
Steve walked a few steps backwards facing Tony and turned around in quick succession only to crash onto a man that just walked out the front door. Tony winced when Steve fell to the ground along with some of the things the other man was holding.
Tony stuttered with his reply and when he knew it wasn’t looking good for him he resorted to his trusty tactic of deflection. He could see that the other man saw right through it. Then someone walked in from god knows where and Tony’s jaw dropped open “Huh….You’re fired”
Tony was expecting that question. He knew this exact one is going to be thrown at him before anything else in the press conference. “Well she does most of the job anyway and I know she can do better than me besides I’m busy with being iron man and all so this is the wisest decision” he replied with practiced ease.
He got back in the car and sped off as fast as he could from there ignoring Steve’s wince and several red lights. Well he was angry at Steve. They were not friends yet but were certainly getting there and things were so good between them. God people were disappointing, that’s why he loved machines, they don’t piss you off by being an ass to someone who was only trying to help. By the looks of it a lot of things were getting broken in the workshop tonight.
“We are up to eighty ounces a day to counteract the symptoms sir”
Even after Tony placed Steve on the bed he clung to him like a limpet so he decided to stay. The blond kept sobbing softly and eventually fell asleep from the exhaustion.
“Next time you ride with me. Okay.”
The universe is under no obligation to make sense to you.
"Should ask you the same, thought you wouldn't come out for two more days. Hot cocoa?"
“Steve, you’re not a member of SHIELD” she stated with an arch of her eye brow.
Tony opened the face plate “Yeah” he answered not really looking at the lights anymore and he realized this moment holds more weight than any other in the forty years of his life.
“She deserved it so” he just shrugged.
He gave JARVIS one of the patented Tony Stark eye rolls and gulped down a glass of green goop he got from the refrigerator with a grimace and went on to prick a finger on one of the portable toxicity scanners he had developed.
The apartment was moderately furnished, looked like a place where an actual working woman with an actual office job would live. It’s exactly what Steve expected it to look like as a cover.
The man narrowed his eyes at Steve, which honest to god was terrifying “A few days ago one of our agents was send to an interview for the new PA of a certain someone. They were supposed to get the job but something happened and a certain other someone got it in the last minute instead”
“Oh this was with them” Bucky said and extended an envelope towards him which Steve grabbed and opened immediately to reveal an ornate card.
He didn’t know whether he should be insulted or grateful. Any way he couldn’t accept these, maybe the fruit basket but the rest had to go. Bucky was never going to stop teasing him about this. He rubbed a hand over his forehead in annoyance.
They were out for coffee on one of those quaint little bistros taking about casual things when Steve dared to ask
“As I do not have AID and currently alive and kickin, I’m gonna go out on a limb and say heavy metal poisoning” he scoffed.
“Well you are looking at the new CEO of Stark industries” pepper said smiling proudly.
Her face-it was enough for me;
“Instead of Happy your actual bodyguard” Pepper chimed in.
“Shall we go?”
Tony memorized all their firsts from then on, their first date was at Steve’s favorite diner which Tony absolutely adored. Their first fight was about Tony’s blatant self- sacrificing tendencies. The first I love you which was by Steve right after the fight. But the moment he kept going back was the moment where Steve held his hand for the first time, the moment where he fell in love.
“Very well sir” He tried to ignore the tinge of disappointment in JARVIS’s reply.
The sight that welcomed him wasn’t something he expected. He was used to a cluttered work shop or as Tony calls it organized chaos but this, this was horrifying. The floors were covered in bloody petals and when his eyes finally rested on something on the screen; something else, something entirely new broke in Steve’s heart, a will, Tony was preparing his will.
“Aww…how cute. Don’t you think the little flightless one is cute Ivan?”
They were so lost in the moment that Tony missed the first time it happened. The second time Tony snapped back with an audible gasp which left Steve staring back in confusion.
“Are you alright? I mean it was really short notice” Tony asked trying not to wince.
He was having a mini breakdown on his bed and failed to notice the cup of coffee on the night stand. When he finally did, gulped it down in one go and gathered his courage to venture into the kitchen.
“Come on, I promise to not violate any air spaces. It’ll be great trust me” and he started to assemble the suit around him even before finishing that sentence.
He hated them.
He didn’t realize he was screaming in real life as well until a soft soothing voice was shushing him and telling him to calm down and breathe.
“He knows and I’m no longer undercover”
On the drive back to the hotel he thought of buying Steve more clothes but remembered how the blond reacted the first time he did so. Steve probably accepted this time because there was no other option, there was no use pushing his luck so he decided against it.
Steve couldn’t believe what he was seeing and for a split second he thought it was some intruder inside the elevator. The two men inside were (how should he put this) sucking face without even realizing that the doors were open.
“What the fuck you pansy!!” the man grabbed Steve by the collar, hauled him up and literally screamed in his face.
“Does it have anything to do with me” He blurted out.
So yeah Steve was screwed ten ways to Sunday cause Tony stark could have anyone he wants, why would he choose Steve; stubborn, boring, antique Steve. Therefore he was going to suffer in silence until he gets over it or so he thought.
"No he could never.......wait what? How do you know it's a he?"
Steve’s face went a little red at that but he needed someone to know. It might not be the best of times to spring a revelation like this upon the other man but Steve wanted to let this one vital piece of information out.
Thank you again for the support. :D
His wings were molted and rapidly turning black only held together by the dye but still they looked ugly. The nerve endings were damaged so it’s like they had a mind of their own ever since Afghanistan.
Large sobs racked the larger man’s figure as he clung to Steve’s shoulders. He gently rubber soothing circles across the brunets back and just held him in silence.
All Nick Fury or so the man says managed to do was disrupt his sleep.  He was plagued by the questions about Shield or sword or whatever, Tony Stark, Iron man, the agent and himself. After much tossing and turning he fell asleep somewhere around four in the morning.
Steve visibly relaxed; thankfully they were still on the first name basis. He gave a small smile “It was fine……Tony I’m really sorry for yesterday”
He felt a fluttering behind him and turned around to see his wings spread high across each side of his shoulders. He placed a hand to his mouth and gasped, eyes going wide at the realization that he was indeed presenting, that too at a photo.
All Steve could do was stand there and stutter like an idiot.
“Nothing to worry about Steve” she replied calmly but Steve could sense an undercurrent of worry in her voice.
And Steve gradually changed her view on Stark as well.  The Tony Stark everyone else saw was very different from the Tony, the blonde often talked about. And by often she means all the time.
“And that would make me not call the cops because?” Steve asked raising an eyebrow. Something about the eye patch wearing man clad in black and with wings tucked inside his equally black coat was telling Steve that he meant business, not the bad kind though.
So he never asked about Stark’s own expect to JARVIS who vaguely suggested that the issue was taken care of and there was nothing to worry about, which meant that Steve should just drop it. But he couldn’t help but notice the color getting darker with each day and soon the real wings would be distinguishable from the prosthetic ones.
It all started when he was four, his first scar. He scrapped his tiny fingers along the edges of something sharp on his first ever circuit board. He didn’t even realize he was bleeding until he saw spots of red on the work table. The pain was immediately forgotten for the rush of excitement of showing his creation to his father. Bloody and trembling little hands held up the circuit board with pride only to be mocked and thrown into a trash bin across the office. Some kids might never approach a piece of machinery ever again after that but Tony wanted to keep going, keep making it better until one day his father had no choice other than to find it perfect. Unfortunately that day never came.
So a wingless man with an art degree and barely any experience huh, that’s who the assistant of Tony Stark is going to be…… if he comes to work tomorrow that is. Tony was very angry, at who? His unfortunate new assistant? Pepper?  Oh he is definitely going to go ballistic on her the next time they meet. He threw a screwdriver across the work table in frustration.
Steve was choking on air by the time he finished reading the rather vague rather short note but he got what the genius meant.
comments and kudos are my life blood.
“Besides you said he would come to me” That was reasonable-ish.
“I’ve got my car outside”
He was nursing a glass of god knows what at this point when a stranger approached him from the side and Tony was instantly drawn to the blond hair and blue eyes.
“May I ask what you are?” Steve asked as if the question could personally offend the AI.
The brunette looked offended “You think- I seriously don’t know how to respond to that” Tony crossed his arms across his chest.
“Why was he discharged early?”
The expo and the start of a road trip.
“Fine. I’ll take you” and Steve didn’t protest.
, some argued that there is some kind of arbitrary science behind it. Tony usually ignored it, why would he waste his precious time thinking about a silly disease, besides he was above unrequited love. Yeah mostly the second reason, well until now. If the bright yellow flowers he just coughed up is any indication, he is in trouble, one big super soldier sized trouble.
Steve literally jumped at that and walked towards the counter when he realized that it was Tony.
As unsure as he was Tony was the one who initiated their first kiss. It was during one of their patch up sessions, while he sat on top of a table and Steve stood in between his legs, while he was focused intently on Tony’s battered knuckles with a kind of fond exasperation on his face. The urge to just lean in and kiss was clawing at Tony’s will. In the end he just gave up and did, ready to jump up and run any moment he felt like it went south. Which is why he was surprised when it was returned.
Feel free to tell me how you feel about this chapter ;)
This would be the happiest day of his life since he woke up from the ice and the next thing he knew, he was laughing. Tony looked scandalized for a second and the next he was smiling one of those real smiles where the sides of eyes would crinkle, not that Steve noticed often, no okay maybe all the time.
“Boyfriend?” it slipped out before he could stop himself.
“Come on it’ll be fun. You two can spend more time practically joined to the hip”
“Relax, I’m not on the job” Nat answered which only raised the confusion in the room.
Steve half carried half dragged Tony to the desk and lowered him down to a chair. Tony removed his reactor momentarily forgetting about the fact that the other man doesn’t even know about its existence.
“I’m sorry but I have to ask, did something happen between you two?”
such picture would i at that time have made:
Even in his drunken stupor Tony understood that Happy wasn’t pleased. He dropped them by the garage of the tower and left without a word.
"I love you.......I LOVE YOU" He jumped back into Steve's arms where he was held in a tight embrace. He leaned in and kissed Steve again coz that's apparently something he could do now boy oh boy.
Tony just raised one of his brows at a nearby camera for that particular answer. He got a fairly decent medical facility on the tower itself. So he ate his lunch which was set out by his assistant and tried not to think about not offering the man any because the rudeness was deliberate, tinkered a little after and drew some of his blood himself to send it off for testing.
“I’m not in a position to discuss this matter with anyone”  which was code for ‘my master is stupid and has forbidden me from talking about his well being to others’.
Steve’s head snapped up to face Tony in surprise “Oh no Tony I could ne-“
There was nothing to worry yet, the toxicity is manageable until he could find a cure. JARVIS was running every possible permutations and combinations for replacing the palladium core in his chest. It would only be a matter of time anyway.
"Shit!"
“Did you find out anything like Fury asked?” She just rolled her eyes and asked instead.
"Not everything is about you cap" Tony replied deliberately sounding annoyed, may be that could get Steve to back off.
After pepper becoming busy with being CEO and Rhodey with being the Iron patriot ( war machine was way cooler, no he doesn’t take criticism) the daunting task of taking care of Tony fell into the hands of the new Avengers.
Okay maybe once.
“Anytime man. Sure you don’t need a ride back?
“It was just a meeting with the lawyers” the blonde shrugged.
“I’m not sure it’s a good idea” Steve said looking a little apprehensive yet the little glint in his eyes gave him away.
Steve stared at the things in hand biting his lips unconsciously for a few seconds and then let out a long sigh “Fine I’ll keep the suit……..if you can call me Steve” he looked up at Tony with a small smile.
For a hot second there he let himself believe that Tony Stark: genius, billionaire, playboy actually wanted him. He couldn’t believe he let himself be this stupid. Tony wasn’t wrong why would anyone want Steve, he didn’t even have a soul.
“why? He doesn’t want to” okaayyyy he might’ve sounded like a petulant child right about there. Natasha just raised an eyebrow at that.
“Must’ve been tough”
He didn’t even notice her walk in until the billionaire turned around and literally ogled at her. Steve recognized her instantly. Natalie Rushman.
“I don’t think it would be worth it. He is kind of a dick.” Steve hid his face behind his cup. There was a distinct sound of something being dropped on the kitchen floor and Sam came rushing after a few seconds. Bucky sat up straight from his place on the couch.
When Tony woke up the next day, it was about four in the evening and his body hurt all over. The first thing he wanted to do was rush out the door to find Steve and then he remembered how Steve had literally ran away last night so he didn’t move from the bed for another hour.
“Umm……let her in” he wiped his grease stained palms on the side of his jeans covered legs and looked over his shoulders at the door a bit worried if he should run and hide after glimpsing Pepper’s furious stride into the workshop.
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve would happily take Tony’s side in this one especially when the people on the other side are sleazebags like Senator Stern and Justin Hammer who have this amazing ability to make his skin crawl just by thinking about them.
It was their last night at Malibu; they would go back to New York the next morning. Steve found himself quite restless. He was avoiding Tony as much as he could and his employer was doing the same. He was worried how long this tension between them would last. He couldn’t sleep and decided to take a walk along the beach but as it was getting too cold he went back so when JARVIS asked him to help Stark he was still laying wide awake in his bed even when it was past three in the morning.
“It’s late why don’t you stay” Wilson was the first to speak. The ‘with Steve’ remained unsaid.
"We need to talk Tony" Steve's eyes were wandering around the workshop taking in the sight of all the blood stained flowers and finally stopped at the display of the will. Tony quickly closed it but it was too late.
Rogers just gave a tight smile “I really need the money Mr. Stark”. The blond dutifully dived back in to the papers at hand.
Normally Steve didn’t mind that he was not the prettiest person in a room anywhere but right now, watching his employer’s undivided attention on a pretty red head, that didn’t set right with him at all.
“Alright Steve I’ll hopefully see you tomorrow”
He was greeted by silence.
“Tony?” It was a loud whisper lamented equally with disbelief and sadness that almost sounded like a whimper which made the two of them spring apart as if electrocuted.
“Now Steve” that was almost a shout and he jumped up from the bed and bolted out the door.
“You brought your assistant with you?” It was Rhodey who broke the trance first.
He sat by the console and clapped as in to activate everything including JARVIS. “Wake up daddy’s home” The holograms and panels lit up and music started playing instantly.
"But I do love you Tony" He pressed a gentle chaste kiss on Tony's lips still smiling. It was like breathing new life into him or so that's what it felt like for Tony.
Tony scooped Steve up once again and asked where the bedroom was. The burly looking man just stood there frozen so the other one, Sam stepped up and pointed him toward it.
(See the end of the chapter for
To say that he screamed his lungs out when he got a glimpse of his wings in the mirror was putting it mildly. The doctors did their best to save whatever that was left but apparently it wasn’t enough.His artfully placed primaries were long gone and what remained were of a dull ugly shade of red, the edges no longer a glimmering gold but a matte dirty yellow.
yeah its a slow burn. Sorry.
“Thanks Sam and thank you or dropping me”
“Just take your seat at the stand Mr. Stark”
) Would be really offended and second this is not the first time, come on Rhodes.” he said finally placing the glass away from him.
The hearing was in two days and Steve found himself getting calmer instead of anxious. He firmly believed in justice and the support system of the people he loved also helped plenty. Even Pepper and Natalia were doing everything they could. So he insisted on going back to work even though Tony and Nat downright begged him and threatened him respectively, to take a few days off (paid leave of course).
Those locks from summer's golden skies,
Tony laughed and promptly passed out.
The initial shock wore off immediately and he offered Tony a cup. He was glad when Tony accepted, happy to get some kind of food in the genius. His mind was still in a haze, plagued by confusion and doubts and he had to get it out, he had to know.
“I don’t think I can afford this” he bit his lips in indignation.
? He thought he had more time, well no use in panicking.
Black
Saying thank you every time sounds repetitive but i love your comments, each and every one of them.
“umm…..about two hundred ,two fifty miles” Steve shifted uncomfortably on his seat.
“You!! I swear to god I’ll dismantle you, I’ll soak your motherboard, I’ll turn you into a Wine rack” all empty threats really but the bot gave a sad whine and lowered its claws nonetheless.
“Your query is duly noted and I will check with Sir about it as soon as possible” JARVIS replied which wasn’t a definite answer but the AI sounded a bit surprised and worried to Steve.
“That might not be a good idea”
“Oh no Mr. Stark i think I’ll pass, you guys enjoy”
"Who is it?........Who wouldn't love you back Tony?" Steve was literally pleading. His baby blue eyes were dark like storm clouds with a mix of emotions Tony couldn't exactly place.
“You know Nat?” he asked, face contorted in confusion. He looked across and saw that his best friend also wore the same expression.
“I think I’ll ask him myself” that was not the answer he was looking for, looks like he has to pry it out of Tony himself after all.
Steve was still standing in the exact same spot staring at the door when Bucky came in literal seconds later asking him what happened. Steve waved Bucky off as always, he was not going to make his best friend worry until he can make heads or tails of the situation.
“But I do love you Tony” he was probably grinning like an idiot. He leaned forward and pressed a sweet kiss on Tony. He pulled back and wondered if he was able to pour all his love on that simple press of their lips.
Another Chapter
“Okay, see you tomorrow” Steve nodded and stepped out of the car walked a few steps then tuned back and smiled again.
She could see right through it “What happened?”
The redhead quirked a perfectly immaculate eye brow at that. Steve could also feel a bit of tension behind those words.
The genius looked like he was shocked out of a daze recoiled back and stared at his wings with a look of horror and shame when he realized what had happened.
The landing was probably the coolest thing he had ever seen. It was his first time seeing Iron man up close despite working for Tony Stark and the armor was really a work of art.
“Wait, how do you know Steve’s work friend Sam?” the man with the broken wings asked a bit quieter probably realizing Steve was trying to sleep in the other room.
The dinner was pleasant. Rhodey came as promised and along with pepper, Happy and Steve it was great. He forgot that he was dying for a few hours. All through the night his best friend kept glancing across the table and then back at Tony, he didn’t know what that was about but didn’t bother with finding out.
“Fine just forget it I’ll behave this time. Who is it? It’s that pretty red head isn’t it” he amended pulling up photos of Miss Natalie Rushman.
“You don’t want to tell me who it is, fine I get it but you’re dying so please get the surgery Tony”
Nobody came for no one after that. Tony was nowhere to be seen, he was avoiding Steve like the plague. It’s been two days since he stepped out of the work shop only sneaking out when no one especially Steve was not around. He would never let Steve inside always dismissing him via J.A.R.V.I.S with one bullshit excuse or another. Steve was growing more and more worried by the second and all he could do was keep destroying the punching bags in the gym.
“Pep not this again”
The blond just smiled wider.
“Would you mind waiting here while I meet Mr. Stark and then I can introduce you?”
By the time Steve blinked back to reality a video of Howard Stark was playing on screen and Tony was nowhere to be seen. When Steve finally found him, Tony was hunched over a small box like thing and shoved it immediately into his pockets the second he saw Steve approach. The man looked sad and almost guilty for some reason. When Steve was close enough he schooled his expression into something more stoic.
he mentally face palmed.
Oh baby we are playing hot and cold with our hearts.
“That’s not what I meant and you know it” Steve sighed “just look at my clothes, way too big” he placed both his hands inside the suit pockets on each side and waved them around as if to prove his point.
his mind supplied followed by a small ‘Language’ echoing in the background, the voice of it sounding vaguely like his mom’s. He just stood there; mouth opening and closing like a fish out of water and eyes wide staring at the closed elevator doors, the same ones where his apparent ‘Boss’ all but vaulted into.
“Uh….what? me uh no uh” Steve just sputtered like an idiot.
“I’m a hundred percent not qualified or this job, they’re not even gonna let me past the lobby” the blond said looking down at his shoes with a sad smile.
Athira and her team were freaking out a bit because their prime witness had not arrived yet. Bucky and Sam kept throwing worried glances at Steve and the door. Natasha looked unfazed as ever until the moment they were about to call for the only witness. She was about to walk out when the doors burst open and Tony sauntered in true Tony Stark fashion.
“Do what hurt?” Tony blinked owlishly at the blond.
Steve let out a shuddering breath and tried to compose himself. If he goes back like this Bucky will definitely sense something is wrong and would murder Tony in his sleep if he found out. Talking about it with Nat right now would be infinitely better than going back home and dealing with his best friend.
“Well whatever it is you boys figure it out okay?”
Tony walked out to the bar and proceeded to chug half a bottle of scotch before unceremoniously plopping down on the couch.
oh dear now i don't have anything to wish for.
Steve sighed and sat down on one of the chairs “Nat told me about her but I didn’t know about Sam” “You know he can’t go around telling everyone right?”
The next morning he woke up early after a few fitful hours of sleep to Steve arranging the papers required for a shareholders meeting. To his surprise his PA came up to him to apologize for the harsh words he said to which Tony had no option but reciprocate.
“Yeah you do that and be ready by six”
"Would you believe me if I said I did?" well he had to try.
Steve and Nat along with a guy with dirty blonde hair and a bow (?) were allowed to go through old SHIELD archives to look for anything that might help. They had already stumbled upon a lot of Howard Stark’s earlier research which was a sort of revelation for Steve. Fury’s motivation to help Tony suddenly made sense to him.
Pepper gave Steve a sad smile” I’m sorry, he’s not a bad man, just vary of new people, he’ll turn around once you two get to know each other”
“Tony, this is Ivan Vanko my chef engineer, he’s a bit of a genius himself” the man introduced.
“That didn’t last very long” He removed the reactor and replaced the core with a new one. Even the mere seconds it took left him a little breathless.
“uh huh” his best friend raised an eyebrow at that but let it go as dramatics and Tony Stark are practically twin siblings “Well it is nice to be appreciated” the man added raising his glass.
“During his kidnapping Mr. Stark sustained some grave injuries that led to shrapnel being embedded in his chest. The arc reactor which powers an electromagnet was developed in order to inhibit its movement towards the heart muscles”
But what followed the threat on his life made his loyalty flare up a little, even if he had only been working for less than a week “Look I don’t know what your play is but I don’t want to be involved in this and I’m never going to spy on my employer”
“Help me to my desk, there’s a box”
“Well why don’t I show you now” Tony said tilting his head towards the basement stairs.
Tony seemed to relax and a ghost of a smile graced his lips “Well you know Iron man can repulser blast him in the face right”
The Steve side of things.
Steve was sure he could see the ghost of a smile on her face. He was even more confused now.
But Tony Stark managed to surprise them all by making a speech about how grateful he is for everyone present at the table. The three people who knew him more where staring with their mouths open by the end of it.
It was about six in the evening when Steve woke up from the small nap he took in hopes of setting his thoughts straight. He took a much needed long hot shower and put on some (nicer than what he normally wears) clothes. It wasn’t much just a light blue button up and black trousers, something suitable for dinner with friends.
Apparently there are things even the great Tony stark couldn’t do. He build a kind of prosthesis to cover up most of the damage and that’s all it was and all it could be, a cover up. He could never fly again. As stubborn as he was he refused to admit defeat, instead shifted his focus on the armor. The primary function of any wing is to fly of course so a suit of armor that can do just that isn’t much different and if it comes equipped with long range missiles and repulsors, that’s nobody’s business. And so Iron Man was born, like a phoenix rising out of its ashes. His flames burned down his captors, freed a village and he didn’t even look back. He should have because may be he would’ve seen Stane’s betrayal coming, may be.
“Thank you Jarvis”
That shut Tony up from his ranting. Well that was a fair enough reason. Stark tech was the best out there but it probably wouldn’t be affordable for someone like Steve or his friend even with military funding.
“Very well sir. Good night”
“It will get harder to hide the discoloration of your wings as they are affected the most and had started to molt. Unfortunately the device that is keeping you alive is also killing you” Jarvis informed in a grave tone.
To Steve’s annoyance the conversation morphed into an inquiry about his mental state and he had to jump off that boat as quick as possible so when his eyes fell on the armor he saw the opportunity and took it.
That was…….okay Steve had to admit that hurt, really hurt especially that last one but he didn’t want to show it so he held his chin up and replied before walking out.
Before he left he really wanted to ask JARVIS about something that was bugging him. It would be best to actually ask the owner but after the not so warm welcome he would be lying if he said that he wasn’t a little pissed off.
They didn’t talk much that day and went to bed with curt good nights which was the usual for the rest of the week, both of them going out of their ways to not be in the same room for extended periods of time.
In the morning he woke up to hushed conversations from the living room and was quite surprised to see Tony sitting on the couch with Bucky and Sam, nursing a cup of what would probably be coffee looking like death warmed over.
“I’m sorry Steve” It was all he could manage to say before turning back to the tower. Steve looked confused and worried but didn’t say anything.
The second he saw 53% toxicity staring back at him, he knew there was no turning back. Somehow everything felt final. He stepped out of the bathroom and looked around for Steve. Frowning when he couldn’t spot the blonde anywhere Tony decided to step into the hallways to check.
His instincts were screaming at him to run out of that place but a mad Bucky was scarier so Steve pushed himself and practically ran into an elevator.
I tried my best to upload the image as it is but it wasn't working so please use the link above which will take you right to the image posted on Deviant art ( yes I had to make a new account, the things I do for love!)
“The miniaturized version is embedded in his chest cavity, yes” JARVIS confirmed.
Steve nodded and then they were off.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here is another chapter and this is by far my favorite. The whole story actually stems from this idea.
I turned about and heard her cry,
As soon as they stepped outside numerous cameras flashed and mikes were shoved in front of his face.
“You’re the assistant to the CEO of stark industries Stevie; I think ti’s reason nuf to celebrate” Bucky countered letting a little bit of Brooklyn to bleed in.
Tony raised a brow at that and faced pepper raising his hands in mock surrender before she could get a word in. “Pep it’s not like it matters if I’m there or not, you select them anyway” that was reasonable-ish.
Steve had watched with a pounding heart when Bucky would lean unnecessarily closer to the edge when they were sitting on the roof or when he took too long to cross the road during heavy traffic or when his eyes lingered on sharp objects. He had watched with extreme sorrow and helplessness how Bucky had drank his nights away and wasted his days curled up on the couch. He had tried to push Steve to the limits with all his might and tried the same with Sam.
Then she abruptly called for the waitress and asked for a new fork. That’s when Steve noticed the one in her hand been bend in the middle. Eyes wide he looked up to her face. She was thanking and smiling at the waitress. This was a very dangerous woman but he felt oddly good that this woman was on his side (and also never arm wrestle with Natasha. scratch that, never go anywhere near her arm. Period)
This was a bad idea, a very bad idea which was repeated by JARVIS inside the suit every five seconds but Tony chose to ignore it for the naked awe and appreciation on Steve’s face.
“Steve, please” he tried to act as if what happened a few seconds ago didn't phase him.
Tony was in the middle of preparing his will just in case, when someone punched in the override code and walked into his workshop.
that cannot help thee to retire!
Everything came crashing down and he was really overwhelmed so he let himself cling to Steve’s shoulders and cry.
Well Tony’s offer was certainly beyond generous; Steve didn’t know what to say he thought to leave the decision to Bucky and just smiled hoping it would convey all his gratitude.
“Why…..why are you doing this?” Steve asked narrowing his eyes at the man.
A high pitched whine made the other man jump and turn around to see Dum-E extending his claw inquisitively at the new face. The blond looked to Tony as for an explanation to what was happening.
“Purposes” Pepper parroted back with a questioning look. He slid back down as smooth as he could and nodded while hiding his face in the pretense of taking a sip.
As a last ditch effort he begged Tony to do something, anything. The “it’s you” blurted out from a dying man’s lips didn’t register at first. It took Steve a few seconds to make the connection and when he finally did he didn’t know what to say. Tony stark, the Tony stark was in love with
Please enjoy.
His heart was thumping away wildly in his chest and Tony wondered when was the last time he felt like this, how in the world had he managed to fall in love with a man he hadn’t even kissed……yet.
This maybe the only thing he could offer Steve; the one last gift the universe would allow him to take, this moment they have together perhaps this single kiss if Tony mustered up the courage to actually do it.
Pepper noticed that Steve still wore a sad look even after she came back from visiting Tony.
Better three hours too soon than a minute too late.
That part was what compelled him to ask the question of why Tony was handing over the company now and the answer he got didn’t help one bit. It was one of those practiced press answers that the genius gave at conferences and interviews that Steve had the pleasure or rather displeasure of witnessing in the short amount of time he worked. But he filed it away to dig through later and steered the conversation into lighter paths, that’s when Tony, to Steve’s infinite surprise offered to show him the Ironman up close.
“So, did you get it?” it was Sam who asked. Even if both the other men looked somewhat impassive Steve knew they were dying to know on the inside.
“Trust me on this one Rogers when its time you’d be the first one tony would come to” with that she turned around and walked away.
They drove to the hotel they were staying and Tony refused to put Steve down till they got to his room. He gently placed the smaller man on the bed and whispered his name. The moment their eyes met Tony could see something break inside Steve and he started sobbing.
Tony almost set the floor on fire with the speed at which he hightailed out of the dining room. He locked himself inside the workshop; took off the fake wings and tried to focus on one of his projects, tried being the imperative here because he couldn’t focus even if his life depended on it. His mind kept wandering back to Steve and to their almost whatever that was in the dining room. His barely functioning heart was pounding way too fast for its own good.
The lunch and drive back to New York were lively. They talked more about both of their childhoods and Tony even told Steve about his father as difficult as it was and also about the real Jarvis. He didn’t fail to notice how easy it was to talk to the blond.
“You know what? never mind”
Everything was going okay until the defendant started accusing Tony of not being sound of mind and the whole case being a ploy by Stark industries to save their dropping Stock values.
The other members of this little celebratory dinner were also dressed somewhat similar so he breathed a sigh of relief and walked further into the room. The moment Tony caught sight of Steve he called him over with a grin to where he was talking with a very intimidating looking man with large brown wings quite like Sam’s but with a bit of white at the ends who Steve identified to be James Rhodes.
“Don’t worry about that. Tony and I have nightmares all the time. More likely than not, we’ll already be awake.”
“Of course sir,” the A.I. says.
“Why are YOU fighting me on THIS?” Tony asks.
Steve fought hard to control the blush that threatened to creep up.
Scarlet, like the delicate petals of spider lilies or like the final rays of the setting sun or if you’re not squeamish, like drops of blood from a fresh wound with a bit of gold at the tips for that right touch of class. Tony Stark’s wings were just like him, eccentric but elegant.
Things got better after Bucky and since growing up, the number of people who openly scowled at him got lesser as the modern world didn’t care about much. By the looks of it Tony stark was not that modern at least when it came to wings.
It was pepper’s way of comforting Tony from what he lost, that he was not the only one. He appreciated her effort to understand and help and that was exactly why he agreed in the first place. But that didn’t mean he had to like the people themselves, if anything it only made him feel more miserable. But now Pepper had one upped herself and went out and got an assistant, a man with no fucking wings. No goddamn soul.
Pepper hightailed from Tony’s side towards the man waiting nervously near the couch. They were going to have a serious talk when she gets back.
So its the death Anniversary of us Fans today (tomorrow for my side of the world) . can you believe it has been one year since Endgame. :( :(
“Oh shut up, you secretly love this” Sam said waving a hand in Steve’s general direction. It was clear that he still hasn’t registered where the blond was. Too busy laying all his attention on his boyfriend.
I did not speak- i saw her face,
That happy gleam of vernal eyes,
Tony was holding it together quite fine until the day he saw them walking into his office smiling to each other.
“Thank you for dropping me Tony”
“Steve………you gonna talk about it” He asked not really framing it as a question.
Steve was smiling at him holding his own cup when Tony dared to look up from his plate.
“I wouldn’t have to keep doing it if only you refrain from scaring them away” pepper replied pinching the space between her brows and her wings sagging. Okay she was getting the wrong kind of annoyed now.
“Hello Mr. Stark, a pleasure to meet you” the accent was thick which Steve suspected to be Russian.
Steve had had enough “Okay, whatever the hell is going on you can explain it to me in the morning now I’m going to bed. Good night” It was clear that Sam knew Natasha somehow and he was not in the state of mind to give polite introductions anyway.
and will ever be.
The face plate snapped back down and he was immediately bombarded with warnings blaring across the screen.
“SHEILD can do that besides you have a hearing tomorrow remember?”
“What was that thing he replaced from the reactor?”
Steve paced back and forth not knowing what to do. He went into the kitchen to help himself to a glass of water hoping it would calm his nerves.
"Steve-" he was cut off by Steve
Bucky stood up and came around the table to give him a hug “you’re gonna do great punk, I know it”
“You might not remember me but I was with the tech group that toured SI labs last month”
It all made sense now; the reckless behavior, the excessive donations, pushing people away.
The disgusting state of his wings would probably be all over the internet by now “Did Pepper call?”
Justin Hammer. Steve could see the instant Tony’s expression soured before he turned to the intruder.
But where friends fail us, we'll supply
“What makes you think anything’s wrong?” He got up and walked over to the bar clicking off and yanking away the prosthesis attached to his wings. An alarming number of feathers fell to the floor.
He was pouring every bit of energy left into helping Steve. One last act of righteousness before he…..
“Any one would be lucky to have you Tony” he let an affectionate smile slip and then Tony was on the floor spitting out more roses with more blood than before. He could see Tony struggling to get air into his lungs as he leaned heavily on Steve, it felt as if the last of his life was leaving his body. Steve felt so helpless, hot tears sprung up in his eyes.
“You sure?” Sam asked in a tone mixed with anger and worry.
That officially took the cake for the most absurd interaction Steve had ever had, for all he knew it could easily be the most absurd human interaction ever too.
“It’s alright Steve it’s just a prototype that needs testing, if anything you would be helping me” which was a big fat lie because currently he wasn’t working on any new prosthetics but plan to start as soon as he gets back, maybe also cut down the prices of the ones in the market while he’s at  it.
Steve knew he wasn’t at a place where he could make such a demand but he was desperate enough not to let the love of his life die. Tony seemed to think in a similar sense as evidenced by his reply. Tony’s body language was telling Steve to back off but he wasn’t backing down without a fight or just more pleading this time.
It’s not because he doesn’t trust doctors after that entire shit show with his wings, no sirree.
“I’m exhausted Nat. I just wanna go home and rest”
“Tony, I want you to meet agent Romanoff” the other man introduced like an over enthused father.
Whenever any of them especially Natasha, caught him sporting a burn or an injury, be it anywhere, they would yell at him and then proceed to wash and dress it. In the beginning he thought all the yelling was because of the fact that he was the only civilian in the team but later realized that it was simply because they cared about him. Now that was one mind blowing revelation. But there was one problem, he noticed them flinch every time they grabbed hold of his hands; everybody did, well everyone except Steve.
Was he ready for this? Maybe not. But he was Steve Rogers, he won’t go down without a fight not when he had all these great people beside him.
“Steve-“ she started, finally looking up to meet his eyes.
After arguing and him being a general ass for ten minutes straight he finally got a stunned pepper to agree. They were enjoying a glass of celebratory champagne when pepper suddenly remembered something. “Oh I almost forgot, Steve is waiting upstairs”
During the entire press conference and returning home debacle, his wings were in bandages and casts. Tony knew they were not gonna be pretty after what they went through but what he saw were not what he expected.
Before he could apologize, a hand grabbed his collar.
“Tony you’re bleeding”
“First of all Mathew (
Tony looked shocked for a moment and before he could say something Steve interrupted
“Steve, remember what I said” She stopped as if she wasn’t supposed to say it out loud and continued after a sigh.
“I’ll explain everything” the other man amended and that was her signal cue to escape if she didn’t want to be part of a very awkward conversation. It was clear that the other man doesn't know what his boyfriend does for a living.
“Haps……yeah you’re here of course uhh……show Steve to a guest room. Yeah great idea. Steve you can rest until dinner. You guys go do that. I’ll be in the lab” the genius blurted out in a frenzy and almost ran out of the room.
Pepper and Rhodes insisted on going back that night itself so he let them. The men who were left settled on the couches and talked around some more. Eventually Happy retired for the night leaving Steve and Tony alone. There were a few seconds of uncomfortable silence until Steve spoke up.
So he watched in awe as the red and gold enveloped the genius and transformed into something not less than the pinnacle of scientific brilliance.
“Captain, I am under strict orders not to alert anyone of sir’s condition, but I can switch on the speakers”
When Tony finally calmed down he started an endless string of apologies but still held Steve close. Steve’s heart ached at the sight. Tony did have his fair share of demons and this was the most vulnerable Steve had ever seen the genius. It made him realize that behind all the bluster and cockiness Tony Stark was just human, a struggling one at that.
Steve felt like he wanted to run all the way to his apartment and curl up like a ball on his bed. Everything was over whelming and he was exhausted. Just one more night and he can go back. He mentally steeled himself and went back inside.
“You, I know you…….You were with that fagot weren’t you” the other man, snapped.
Steve agreed to take the suit in hopes of returning it after the expo but after wearing it he noticed that it fit him perfectly as if it was custom made to his measurements. Honestly he’s not even surprised anymore.
Enjoy....
“Jarvis?”
At first Steve thought the man was insulting him a part of him still believes that he did but another part was telling him that Tony genuinely meant it. It was all really really confusing.
The large man with long hair standing next to Sam almost shouting in her ear was not helping her temper one bit. She directed a kind (read fake) smile towards the couple “Any way nice meeting you gentlemen, I’ll get going now”
“I’ve always been wise, jerk”
“It’s fine, like you said I should be used to this by now” Steve sounded somewhat annoyed. Tony tried not to focus on it maybe he could make it up to the man somehow.
Tony accompanied Steve all the way to his apartment once they got to Brooklyn. They were met at the door by the worried faces of Steve’s only friends who he had informed beforehand through a very painful phone call.
The other man walked around and stopped near the latest armor hung from the ceiling and ran his nimble fingers along the edges.
“You’ve got a delivery, come and open it grumpy cat” Bucky got off the bed and walked into the living room knowing that Steve would follow.
There, in the back of his brain buried behind all the equations and schematics and occasional bullshit, was his love for Steve, (which he thought would never be returned) for all intents and purposes would have stayed buried until the day he decided to be stupid for once (or not stupid, either way).
The other man with them had abnormally large brown wings that dragged on the floor even when folded. He was eyeing Steve with an unreadable expression on his face all that time and then Nat leaned in to whisper something in his ears. The man turned to Steve and flashed a grin along with a double thumbs up. Steve heard something close to a ‘clown’ from the other direction, confused he turned to Nat and caught her rolling her eyes with fond exasperation at the other man.
Guys i'm really really sorry for late updates. I don't know if any of you were waiting for updates but if you were i appreciate your patience.
" you've been avoiding me lately" something like hurt flashed across Steve's blue eyes in that moment and Tony felt really bad for putting that there. No Tony can't reveal the real reason and add more guilt and hurt nope.
By the time Steve said okay the genius had turned around to his work.
“I want to come with you” Steve abruptly stood up.
As the first measure he apologized (he wasn’t anything if a man of principles) and proceeded to ignore the billionaire for the remainder of the day. He noticed Stark throwing sad glances his way during the meetings but ignored them with a vengeance; yes he was going to be that petty.
So he took the other man to his bed and contemplated staying by his side. But his mind was still reeling with questions which made him too flustered to stay still.
“Yeah I was just watching it” Steve stood up to face the windows. The curtains were drawn letting warm sunlight shine in through the glass.
Steve left with Happy while Tony went down to the workshop again to get in the Ironman armor.
“Why do you think there is something wrong with them?” she asked instead, her face a cold nonchalance.
Tony thought hiding his smirk from pepper.
He had to admit, he was blindsided the first day but was fully prepared to take whatever the other man threw at him from the next day onward. To Steve’s surprise their second interaction was very polite which left Steve blinking his eyes in disbelief for a few seconds.
“I …..who?…….what?” Steve spluttered.
There was a palpable tension inside the car while they were on their way to the court. The three of them were lost to their own thoughts.
“Purposes”
“When did you get so wise Punk?” Bucky asked with a bump of his shoulders and set the cup down in front of him.
“uh….Than-“ before Steve could finish someone called the brunettes name from behind him.
Tony was about to call for a suit when the director raised both his hands half way and said “we do not have time for this Stark”
PS: Tony's shocked face (read- surprised pickachu face)
Steve rose up to his feet with a sigh and plastered on a fake smile. He followed the redhead out the door. They discussed the transfer procedures and when it was time to leave she asked him to walk with her to the car. Steve followed somewhat skeptically failing to hide the pinched expression on his face.
Tony just sighed and ran his fingers through his hair. “Just…..just monitor them J, daddy’s gonna go get some shut eye”
“Check palladium levels”
It was way too late in the evening by the time Steve found Natalie’s address and started pounding on her apartment door.
Wrong.
“You don’t have to if you’re not up or it Steve” his best friend voiced sensing the faint change in Steve’s tone.
My soul will cast the backward view,
But if you think it came out of nowhere it's because its Tony's POV and is better explained in the next chapter.
Steve found himself making more and more excuses to slip his hands into Tony’s. He started Camping in the workshop to see if Tony hurt himself, which happened on a fairly regular basis. He took the utmost care in treating them while Tony watched with a twinkle in his hazel brown eyes. The other Avengers backed off slowly and the task fell to Steve exclusively, he was secretly grateful for it. He was confused when he caught Tony rubbing expensive moisturizers relentlessly onto his palms. He never liked them except for the fact that they smelled really good.
and suddenly we see
“Hey what have I said about touching people, back off, off you go” He made a shooing motion with one of his hands. The bot lowered its arm and backed off a few feet with a sad whine. Steve’s face fell instantly.
“Yeah sure” and the line went dead. He whispered a quiet sorry to the empty room.
“Mr. Stark my systems are being overridden” so JARVIS is still pissed off.
His thoughts were derailed by a gorgeous red head sitting at the end of the couch reading a magazine. She looked so professional and put together and her wings were the most beautiful things Steve had ever seen, raven black interspersed with deep red feathers, they looked perfect. She looked up and smiled at Steve as if she could feel his eyes on her. Steve’s eyes went wide and he ducked his head in embarrassment, no doubt that his cheeks were going pink. In the corner of his eyes he could see her shaking her head with a smile and looking back at the magazine.
In a moment of weakness he asked the blond to stay and to his surprise he agreed.  He had been having night terrors since (you know what) but this was the first time someone was there by his side to help him and hold him and his weak heart just couldn’t let it go, not yet.
“I’m afraid that’s not wise sir, shall I prepare one of your fifteen cars instead”
“It’s beautiful……Can I paint them sometime?” it came out like a whisper.
After a few seconds JARVIS broke the silence “The results appear to match with Type III Hypersensitivity, Heavy metal poisoning and Carpet viper bites but they are not conclusive and I suggest you see a doctor sir”
“uhh……Buck?” there was no sound other than Steve’s erratic breathing. He was debating whether to get the baseball bat from under the bed or get to the light switch.
His lungs had other plans, coughing and gagging he fell to the floor spewing out roses with more and more blood. Steve had a look of absolute horror on his face as he knelt beside tony frantically grabbing at his shoulders. Tony could feel his vision blur with the lack of oxygen and clung to Steve for support.
“That was cheating” the man in his arms accused.
“No, other than him hiding a suspicious box thingie a lot, I got nothing” he shrugged.
Before he could react the elevators opened to reveal Director Fury.
Steve seemed to calm down at the response and gave a grateful smile which looked good on the blond. Steve should smile more…… and he himself should think why his brain was supplying these kinds of stupid thoughts about his assistant cause
“Hah I knew it, Congrats you Punk” Bucky gave him an one armed hug as he still hadn’t set the bottle down.
“The core is about to expire sir, I suggest you turn back immediately” JARVIS alerted in a rather stern tone.
Steve narrowed his eyes as if he could see right through that lie, well half lie but seemed to relax after a few seconds. The other man turned to stare out the window with a forlorn look. This wasn’t the first time Steve would get like this, as if the weight of the world was resting on his shoulders.
They say wings are the extension of our souls, something that lets us soar through the heavens while we are still living. Tony used them for more than flight. His wings fascinated men and women alike. It was equal to owning a flashy sports car or an island in the Mediterranean; not that he didn’t own both of those, more than one actually. His wings were a subject of pride. Flash a side here or flutter some feathers there, was all the flirting he needed on a good day and they would just follow him anywhere.
JARVIS turned to his task wordlessly. Tony took back the previously thrown screwdriver and fidgeted with it.
She opened and stared with furrowed eye brows and flared wings, clearly in a defensive posture but eased down when she realized it was Steve.
The other man shot up from the couch when he heard the now familiar ping of the elevator. The moment Tony laid his eyes on Steve he knew what the blond had that others didn’t or rather what he didn’t have in this case. Tony turned to pepper with the most thundering expression he could muster. She shrank back a little at that, knowing exactly what she did.
(See the end of the chapter for
He extended an armored hand towards Steve and as the blond was about to take it, Tony just scooped him up in his arms instead. Steve grabbed on to his shoulders with a small yelp.
“Wait you wouldn’t need an assistant anymore” She announced gesturing with the glass towards Tony.
“Thank you……..for being there for him” the other man said in a raspy voice.
“uh huhh” Tony crossed his hands on his chest and narrowed his eyes at a camera thinking why  in the world he programmed his AI like this. He decided to let it go this time and with a huff told JARVIS to let the other man in.
he smiled at that thought
Tony recognized it as an obvious ploy to steer the subject away from Steve but indulged the other man anyway. He didn’t know exactly how to answer that question given that Steve had never flown for even a day in his life.
That got Steve sputtering incomprehensible things while looking down at his feet. She only smirked harder.
“It’s Michael but it’s fine. I can see myself out” the other man said with a small smile and a shrug. . Judging by the look, the guy probably noticed the resemblance but just didn’t comment about it.
“I’m assuming you are referring to the palladium core, which my protocols prevent me from discussing about”
Both of them fell back almost into what they used to be before the fight as if that little situation didn’t happen at all. Steve could tell that Tony wasn’t ready to talk about the nightmare issue either.
) but the prospect of asking its creator in person sounded more horrifying.
The drive to stark tower was silent, neither men spoke anything. Steve was lost in his own thoughts and Sam just let him be. It only took about thirty minutes and before he knew it Steve was staring with his mouth open at stark tower. He was dropped off at the entrance.
As you are such amazing readers there is a little teeny tiny surprise in this chapter.
Every time he looks over at Steve she is right there next to him, their heads almost touching while leaning down to look at some documents or simply talking in faint mumbles near the coffee machine. That’s fine really, it’s just work but he had also noticed them go out a few times and she would give a sly smile whenever Steve shuts down Tony’s bullshit.
The burly man who Tony assumed to be Bucky Barnes whispered a soft “Steve” and held out his hands to lead Steve into a hug but as soon as his fingers touched Steve’s arm, the blond flinched back eyes wide and collapsed into Tony who was standing behind him.
Enjoy!!
and busied himself with his latest designs of Clint's arrows for some much needed distraction.
The two of them stood there for a few seconds and watched pepper walk away.
The proceedings for civil and criminal assault is different but for the story's sake i'm going with a mixed system.
He would’ve let it slip when he admitted that Tony was very much needed but caught his tongue at the last minute. Tony was about to say something when he was thrown into a coughing fit, he spat out roses
And seen the soul of truth in every part;
"It's you"
“Okay that came out wrong, I’m sorry what I meant was, believe it not I want yo-my employees to have nice things. Ask pepper I buy her shoes all the time and I see you accepted the fruit basket”
Tony braced himself on the counter with one hand and rubbed his aching chest with the other. “Thought what?” he interrupted before the other man could finish. It would hurt too much to hear it.
“Come on platypus is it really the first time?” he asked with a self -deprecating chuckle while rummaging around for a glass. “Okay so then what were you doing with the XL version of Steve?” There was no humor in Rhodey’s voice this time and Tony knew he was being as serious as he can be.
“I know” Steve turned around to face the larger man standing across their kitchen counter.
Really grateful for the support. :D
I searched the night sky for a star to wish upon
(See the end of the chapter for
When Steve finished work at Stark tower for the day and decided to pay a visit to the workshop, Tony was neck deep in research about something. Steve could see articles about Ivan vanko among scientific journals and videos on the screen behind the genius.
“Umm……Jarvis? I know it’s not my place to say this but did Mr. Stark’s wings always have black in them? He blurted out before he could chicken out. JARVIS was quiet for a few minutes as if the AI was contemplating Steve’s word vomit.
Steve pursed his lips and tried to sit as stoic as possible. She looked as if in a trance for few seconds then her face visibly lit up and took another look at Steve’s documents with renewed interest.
Well at least now he knew what to look for. He told JARVIS to watch over Tony until he got back and rushed out of the tower in search of a familiar red head.
Tony’s blood froze at the scene before him “You fucking bastard” he lunged at the Russian and managed to land a punch to his face. The man scrambled away and disappeared into the corridor. Tony dropped the plan to go after him for helping Steve who was still on the floor.
This is the biggest chapter so far. Enjoy.
“yeah bout dat, that little shit is proving to be even more stubborn than you so” She stopped as if expecting Steve to finish the sentence and her lips quirked up in a small smile.
“Made Steve swear, really must be a dick’ Bucky said smiling and looking over at Sam. The other man just laughed and sat back down next to his boyfriend. Steve took it as an invitation to launch into a detailed retelling of everything that happened. In the end both the other men just shrugged it off stating that what all the newspapers and tabloids say must be true and Tony stark was just an asshole despite Iron man being a hero. Steve sighed and settled back into the couch.
“The same thing powers the tower right but this one is in his chest?”
“Mute” That was the last thing Tony wanted, making the people he love worry about him. Until (or ‘if’ really who was he kidding) he could find a cure no one has to know and after that maybe he will casually inform them that he was dying and deal with the repercussions then.
JARVIS chose that exact moment to speak up “Sir if I may, it has been brought to my attention that there is some anomaly in your wings”
Guys i'm not on Tumblr but if you want to DM me i am on Instagram. i'll probably post the art for this fic there as well but only if i cant post it here. My ID is the exact same as my AO3 name.
The bald man was walking around the apartment with his hands clasped around his back, taking in everything inside the room. He oozed intimidation from every pore.
Steve grabbed a coffee and walked back in the living room where the other three men were still in conversation.
There was definitely something strange going on.
“You don’t expect him to chuck me in a normal place and go by himself do you”
The evening was proceeding in a way he didn’t even expect but the billionaire was too drunk out of his mind to turn around.
As he didn’t own a smart-phone and didn’t think it would be appropriate to bring the stark- pad home borrowed Bucky’s phone to google about Tony stark.  The results were less than savory but Steve was only after the images of the man. He was a bit surprised when he found what he was looking for. Although Stark’s wings were a little worse for wear after the kidnapping they certainly didn’t have any black to them. He was right.
They were going over some things about the expo late in the evening of the fifth day when Tony made a joke about Steve being the first one to last this far. Something about it rubbed him the wrong way. It was probably the insinuation brought by that comment that Stark was being a jerk to Steve on purpose.
“Holy shit Stevie”
“Steve you really should be used to this by now” Tony said with a smirk while he opened the car door and got in behind the wheel.
And also if the space bar and F key of my keyboard barely work so if you find it odd that i miss a lot of those that's the reason.
Steve reached out to trace its smooth edges and was struck by a sudden realization. Tony never let anyone he didn’t trust into his workshop; it was his own personal heaven and it was a privilege just to stand there. Steve’s heart fluttered at that.
that love costs all we are
“I went through all the documents you send Mr. Rogers, do you have anything else to add” She asked finally taking her eyes off the screen and resting them on Steve’s profile with a soft ‘oh’.
Coming back to his dilemma, which has an actual medical name. Hanahaki, quite a common knowledge these days. Some said it was magic
“And that’s what you do isn’t it Mr. Stark, throw money at everything. I don’t know if you know this but it doesn’t mean shit how much money you have if all you are, is just an asshole” the blond raised a defiant chin at Tony and stood his ground.
Okay maybe a few times when he was younger and then pepper.so let me rephrase that, Tony Stark never fell in love with people who didn't love him back. Sure some were after his money or technology or any of the other perks associated with dating a billionaire-playboy-genius, but most of them always made him believe that they did love him. He's not complaining, he probably doesn't deserve to be loved at all any way.
The blond was standing near the dining table with a few folders clutched to his chest  looking guilty and was giving him what Tony thought to be the most adorable puppy dog face on a grown man. Well so much for not getting close.
Steve reluctantly walked through his own door, and carefully shut it once inside. Then he slumped on his bed face first and shut his eyes. His fingertips trailed along the pillow next to him. It wasn’t nearly as soft as Tony’s skin was, but it was all he had to simulate that sense.
“Yikes, seems you got a little… Schmutz…” Tony gestured to Steve’s face.
Carol ran in from behind Luke and Danny, her pace so quick that her hat blew off and her blond hair unravelled. She was known for her strength in the team, that’s how she’d earned respect, not only because of that but also due to her discipline. Back in the Air Force she was a true hero and a wonder, most people even considered her a marvel, earning her the nickname Miss Marvel; that was, until she had been promoted to colonel.
They made their way toward the doors, and cracked them open. With the power gone, the bars were lifted, and both of them had to shield their eyes when they stepped out into the light. The clouds above had faded, and the sun cracked through those that remained, beaming rays of sunlight into the huge building littered with fallen drones.
"O misery! O misery! "
And then Steve moved closer, barely an inch barely perceptible and all his self-restraint flew out the window. He would be selfish one last time, he would take this and only this and keep it away before he’s gone and so Tony leaned in and closed the gap between their lips.
It was a hassle walking through the crowd of other important people and fans but most of them gave Steve a wide breadth which he was really grateful for sometimes. There was someone waiting at the apparently new car Happy has previously brought to the back exit.
“Add the New York Mansion to Steve’s name” Steve would probably hate it but he can’t actually complain to him in person (he would certainly be six feet under by that time of course). He could write something personally to urge the blond to keep it. Tony had rarely known happiness in the time they lived in that house but some of his fondest memories of Jarvis and Ana were associated with it as well. Maybe Steve could move in and raise a family of his own or he could sell it and buy another place.
Tony understood that the forties were a very different time but Steve never showed any signs of that kind of hatred.
Thank you lovely people for the kudos and comments. I am so happy to know that you love the idea of Steve's wings. This story is actually a dream i had and had absolutely loved it so i wrote it down.
"They appear to be sunflower petals sir. They are thought to symbolize warmth and adoration" the trusty AI replied.
Half of Steve’s mind had been preoccupied since that little incident at the dining table. No one thought anything was wrong with it, just Tony being Tony and his friends being exasperated with that. But something about the way Tony has been acting seemed weird to Steve but the thing was he really didn’t know Tony all that much so Steve’s assessment could just be wrong even though a part of his brain kept telling him that this was familiar almost as if he has seen it somewhere else before.
“You wanna talk about something else”
“Oh I’d would never, not because I know I could never fare with half of Manhattan but because I wouldn’t stoop that low and Good night Mr. Stark hope you sleep well”

It was a morning like always, no one else was up yet except Steve. After his usual morning exercises he jumped right into his self-proclaimed breakfast duty and one by one the others started walking or rather dragging themselves into the common kitchen. The last one to arrive was Tony, still half asleep, hair in a mess and clothes all rumpled. Steve couldn’t help but stare, happy that the man actually listened to him and slept for the night.
I'm back again.......late....... as usual.
When Tony eventually calmed down, Steve tried to extract himself from the embrace but Tony held on tighter.
"Fancy meeting you here Rogers"
Even though he was exhausted, Tony knew he wouldn’t be able to sleep as his brain kept replaying that moment in the workshop, Steve with his hand outstretched and something in his eyes that said deep longing. Tony was the last person Steve should want right now so maybe distance could be the best option.
The lawyer Tony mentioned came to visit them at the apartment to discuss the proceedings with Steve and just like he said, she was a highly capable woman and Steve felt reassured.
“Why do you think i went to art school? but I’ll let you be the judge this time” Steve teased back easily with a smile.
“uhhh…..Yeah” Tony said narrowing his eyes. It certainly wouldn’t even come in the top twenty of weirdest things he’d done.
“You’ve been avoiding me lately” Steve could swear something close to sorrow flicked across Tony’s face before he schooled it to stoic, his expressive eyes clouding over with something dark.
Tony was off to the air field for his dramatic entrance while the two of them made their way to the expo. Steve decided to check out some of the pavilions till it was time for Iron man to literally drop out of the sky. There wasn’t really anything he had to do as an assistant as Tony was only giving the key note speech. When it was time Steve made his way back stage.
“Perfect… follow me please” she said with a smile and strode out of the office with her dangerously high heels clicking behind her, all Steve could do was follow. As soon as they stepped out of the office he could feel multiple pairs of eyes on him. Steve just prayed that his work didn’t include frequently visiting SI offices.
“You had this in your body?” Steve asked while handing over a new palladium core from the box.
Tony never failed to notice how the captain went for his hands every time they were in close proximity even in public. He was convinced Steve had some kind of super tolerance or something. He thought he would make it a bit easier for the captain with creams and moisturizers but was always met with a frown from him. Yet he continued using them until the day Steve told Tony why he loved the brunet’s hands while he asked for them, in marriage.
“Uh Kevin …..Sorry…….I’ll get someone to take you back”
He needed the job, pay was good and if he could prove the genius wrong about his assumptions of Steve, that was an added bonus.
Tony could see that it was taking everything in Barnes’s power to not to look offended at that considering the situation. His eyes were glazed over as if he would cry any minute.
“I would appreciate it but then I would be the one who has to deal with all the paper work….. Thank you Tony really” Steve smiled back.
“Like what” Steve asked, a bit confused.
Steve suddenly stood up afraid where this conversation would lead to “I’ll go get ready”
“Why? Because of the wings?” Bucky took his hands off the table and crossed them across his chest while narrowing his eyes at Steve. Steve knew that it was his best friend’s ‘do-not-fight-me-on-this one- Stevie’ look and cut him short before the other man could admonish him further.

“Budapest?” Steve parroted in confusion “Did something happen there?”
Steve sighed still facing away “Not now Buck………not today”
Steve’s mind was oddly blank all through their ride. He never went anywhere outside of New York so he was really focused on the sceneries that passed them by. Tony was driving faster than Steve liked but he was trying to absorb everything he possibly can. He was focused on the ride that he forgot to call and inform his best friend until Tony asked him.
“Miss Potts is approaching, I suggest that you inform her-“
Tony seemed to be contempt at that. They sat there; inside a ridiculously expensive car, eating delicious Mexican food talking about their respective best friends. Steve told the Sam-Bucky love story which Tony listened raptly with a smile. Tony talked about Rhodey and Pepper and a multitude of drunken shenanigans which made Steve tear up from laughing too hard.
Steve continued with making pancakes all the while stealing little glances at Tony, who was on the couch graciously sipping his coffee. Their eyes met once and all Steve could do was smile, the next thing he knew Tony jumped up from the couch and all but ran away right into the elevator. Steve was staring with his mouth open and barely saw Natasha following.
That got a chuckle out of the inventor; he shouldn’t overdo it after all.
When Steve came to visit him at the workshop that day, Tony was having the third existential crisis of the week.
He sounded serious so Steve agreed not really understanding what his friend actually meant by it. He took a shower after the call had ended and came back to a relatively dark room. He could’ve sworn the blinds were open when he left. Steve felt a sense of déjà vu wash over him and looked to the darkest corner on instinct.
He was pretty sure the talk was going to be awkward for him and Bucky would probably not live it down till the end of time.
Tony stepped out from behind the table strode towards the blond while gulping down a glass of very very expensive scotch. “Alright Rogers you get the drill, you have access everywhere except the workshop, JARVIS will help if you want, J say hello”
“Your wings……….what happened to them?”
Steve is confused for a second and then his expression morphs into something of shock, blinking away the tears.
The moment it was announced that the court was adjourned for three days on account of the new witness, his lawyers and friends escorted him out the room.
“You know I’m not worried about that”
“Buck. What happened?”
. It was him all along. Of all the times he imagined how their conversation or his eventual revelation would go down; this was not what he imagined.
“I know I know…….sometimes I feel like a leech around him”
effect on Steve.
Steve had struggled a lot while growing up; from various ailments to his mom dying, so trailing behind Tony Stark while the man behaves like a complete ass was not that hard.
“Hey you’re early” Steve stated as the other two men sauntered into the living room.
A part of him thought it was absurd to give away expensive things to someone he barely knew but considering the things he gifted to his flings and one night stands this was tamer and also Steve deserved to be happy.
He jumped a little when Jarvis announced that Tony was coming up. The genius looked a little worse for wear. His wings still had the dye and prosthetics but were drooping on either side clearly stating that the man was exhausted.
Pepper or Rhodey would be barging into the workshop only to find blood trailing down Tony’s hands. The first thing he would hear most days after a particularly long engineering binge would be a
“Undercover?” broken wings chimed up again, visibly very confused and annoyed that he has no idea what’s going on.
“I’ve got to report back to base”
Someone large and intimidating with dirty ash wings walked up to them after a few seconds.
“But you kept him” The bot in question was at the counter trying to make the stupid green smoothie again, pouring it all over the floor rather than the glass.
“If it’s alright I can start today” He replied, standing up along with her.
“Care to explain why you are getting thrown out of bars”
Like the insides of an underground cave, like a void of nothingness that sucks in everything. Tony was being pulled into it, he was screaming and clawing at the air and suddenly the dark nothingness latched onto his back and morphed into something hideous that resembled a pair of wings. He was cursed with a wicked soul this was proof of it. He lay there in the middle of a large field surrounded by men whose faces vaguely resembled Stane and his captors and even his own father. They rushed forward and started pulling his feathers off laughing and chanting about his unworthiness and then the hands started clawing at his chest. He screamed louder.
This is worth it he thought while watching the unadulterated glee on Steve’s face as they soared through the air, hair billowing in the wind and lips stretched in a wide grin.
Steve hesitated for a minute. Tony obviously didn’t want anyone to know the existence of the arc reactor in his chest; wouldn’t telling a spy from a secret government organization be the highest form of deception?
A part of him was convinced that Tony’s whole disappearance act had something to do with him. That paranoid part wouldn’t let him eat or sleep. By the second day or third as it was three in the morning, after much tossing and turning in the bed he decided, to hell with it and get something from the kitchen. He hoped that no one would be awake at this time as most of the Avengers had awful sleep schedules. Can’t blame them either, nightmares were not something in short supply in their line of work.
“For what?” Steve asked looking up at the ceiling.
“What happened to Tony?”
After what seemed like a short ride in the elevator they arrived at the penthouse of the infamous Tony Stark. Steve had to agree the penthouse was even more beautiful with its clear cut edges, chrome finishing, marble surfaces and glass panels as far the eye can see. But something was missing though, he couldn’t really place his finger on it but.
“I thought you could use the rest luv.” He trails his fingers down Tony’s arm.
“Alright Hannibal, let's get you cleaned up.” Tony walks away with Mari chattering on about what happened.
“We are still gathering intel. I’m here to actually talk to you about a search you ran yesterday.” He holds up the folder.
Tony leaned back and mulled that over. The file said that they had been given all the appropriate notifications but there were a lot of vital files missing from Mari’s case and this lined up with what she had told him about her time in the system.
Tony glances up from where he was wrapping a blanket around Mari. She had fallen asleep on him while they were waiting for Bruce to finish Bucky Bear’s surgery. He stands up as carefully as he can without jostling her. Then he takes slow steps to where Bruce has the bear laid out on the table. He’s got a collection of small metal parts sitting in front of him next to the bear. When Tony leans down for a closer look he threads a hand in her hair so he can keep her head pressed against his chest.
When Mari goes to get back up he shoves her back down with more force, sharing a laugh with his buddies. He does it again and adds a kick for good measure.
“Come out and play little Peterdottir.” The hulking form comes to stand inches in front of the shaking toddler. “Are you under here?”
Mari shakes her head.
“Yeah but before that I was just a little guy from Brooklyn.”
“That’s not what I meant.”
“It’s your room Kiddo.”
Mari giggles and eats the last of her eggs. “Are we still shopping today?”
“Mari!?!”
“How is that possible?”
Tony jerks to his feet but winces and wraps an arm around his ribs. He shakes off Bruce who reaches out to lower him back to the bed. “Oh cut me a fucking break. I may rag on SHIELD security but it still takes a large amount of skill to get through.”
“Go ahead but since when do you knock?” asks Bruce.
“Is that olive branch coming yet?” Mae asks.
Mari only curls up tighter.
The Asguardian turns in time to see a small figure barrel into his legs and wrap her arms around his knees in a hug. Tony comes inside after her, carrying the empty plates and the folder tucked under his arm. Sam and Clint follow soon after.
Steve then takes the presents the new arrivals brought and puts them aside on the table behind the couch with Mari continuing to cling to his leg. Rhodey and Pepper move to sit on the couch. Steve joins them and pries Mari off his leg to sit her on his lap. Since she seems reluctant to speak Pepper and Rhodey tell her about themselves and working with Tony. It doesn’t take long for the conversation to deteriorate into ‘Embarrassing Stories about Tony Time’. It has Mari rolling in laughter so Tony just pouts from the breakfast bar, nursing a fruit punch. Ten minutes in, the elevator bings. Mari looks over the back of the couch and watches Happy and Sam walk in. Tony takes their gifts to put next to Rhodey and Pepper’s.
“Oh well. You two want to get in on a training session? Clint and Thor are already down there.”
“Yeah? Yeah. Maybe you’re right. I can do this.”
“Oh no. I’m not leaving till-“ Tony turns to glare at Agent Hill but is interrupted when Natasha comes up and pinches his side. “OW! What the hell!?!”
“Come now, Marianna. Communication is the first step to solving the problem,” says Dr. Krevin.
“Speaking of doctors,” Steve closes his sketchbook and sets it aside. “How did today go?”
“Hey squirt! Say hi!”
“And then he saved me from drowning. After I broke his arm. He’s not under HYDRA’s grip anymore.”
“Yeah, we all know your love of being a real pill, which reminds me.” Steve goes to the cabinet and pulls out Mari’s medication box. “Let’s get these sorted before you start eating.”
“Of course not.” Tony slides the phone back into his pocket. “I’m pretty sure it was just her mother. Her father worked for Osborne though so I’m sure he has more than one skeleton in his closet.”
Ms. Flander smiles. “Yes. Pops and Daddy.”
“Ha. Jokes on her. I’m wearing the Lord of the Rings ones.” Clint pulls is waist band down enough for the cartoon face of Legolas to peek out. “I’ll take a rain check on that trip to the park. I’ll just have to pick up nannies another time.” He salutes them and moves to the elevator.
“Your language sir.” Jarvis reminded.
Steve lets out the breath he was holding as Natasha comes up to his side and asks, “You said three were injured. Who’s the third?”
“It’s just going to be real quick Kiddo. You won’t even notice,” Steve says in a gentle voice.
“Aye! Natasha and Lady Potts told me that while the scoundrel was distracted our young warrior snuck a ‘Medusa’ and a ‘Euryale’ onto his file device.”
Tony shoots her a glare and leads Mari over to the sitting area Pepper has off to the side of her office. He sets the bag on the coffee table and pulls out Mari’s coloring book & No Mess Markers. She sits down on the carpet in front of it.
“I did?” She looks up with raised eyebrows.
“What!?!” He runs to stand next to the Count. “B-but you still need me!”
Steve sighs and the tension leaves his shoulders. “I’m sorry Clint. Today just needs to go perfectly.”
“Are you trying to buy our niece?” Mae demands.
Mari nods not meeting her eyes.
When Mari enters the living room she finds Tony sitting on the couch with his head leaned back and his eyes closed. His arms were crossed tightly across his chest, his knuckles white. She ran and leaped, landing on the cushion next to him with a bounce. “Daddy!”
“Morning greetings little warrior.” He bends down and pulls Mari from his legs, lifting her onto the counter. “How are you fairing after your epic battle?”
The two heroes laugh as they rush to do what she says. Mari calls out directions but she stumbles over the words and has to keep the pages close to her face. They repeatedly have to go to the pages themselves which leads to the couple bumping into each other and trying to work around the other. Things quickly go downhill when Tony grabs a pan to close to the heat.
As she settles back into her chair a pain flares behind his eyes. He cringes and when he opens his eyes again his vision is blurry on the edges. The living room flickers and instead of the sleek black floors they’re scraped, stained wood floors. Instead of a plush modern armchair he saw one that was threadbare and faded. The woman in it was younger but her hair was just as red if not curlier. He thought he could hear the static of an older radio in the background.
“Um, Mama. Mama wait!” Rhodey rushes after her.
“She sounds upset Ironman.” Tony turns and watches him back up down the stairs. “What you gonna do? Catch the bad guy or save the girl?” With that he turns and runs down the stairs.
"I've seen those bugs before in different lairs,” says Clint. “SHIELD has even been looking into their own versions. Trying to steal my job the little fuckers."
"How do you know he's not staying at some hotel?" Sam asks.
“Never, dorogoi.”
“Yeah. I’m ok.”
“You're more than welcome to play with it either way.”
“You had a tough day yesterday. Lets talk about this another time. Think on it.”
“You did what you had to, to survive.” Steve leans over and runs his hand through her hair. “There’s no shame in that and your father and I are just glad you came out in one piece.”
Mari buries her face in Mae’s shoulder and sobs. Ben leans in and whispers something low in Icelandic.
“Oh good, so we can come to you at the start of cookie season?” Tony smirks.
“You can’t keep her locked away in the tower forever Tones. That’s probably how she got the cold in the first place. No exposure to the outside world.”
“Bucky Bear’s head ‘sploaded,” she wails.
Steve stands and goes out into the hall. “Hey Mari?”
“Get moving, now. I’m done playing your games. Sorry sir.”
“It’s not that simple Steve.”
Mari climbs down from the chair and goes to the cabinet. When she opens the door there are thick scraps books and a single teddy bear. The bear is wearing a blue pea coat, boots, and shorts with red tights and gloves. On its face is a little black bandit mask. It smelled like dust and the clothes were a little tattered around the edges but the fur was soft and it still had all the buttons and eyes. She takes it out and brushes back the tuft of fur on the top of its head. “A teddy bear?”
She pauses and turns to Tony. “Really? I’m a Stark now?”
“You can see shapes though right. Follow my voice.” He starts waving his hands. “Look over here! I’m the handsome moving blob. Can you see me moving?”
“Who the hell is Bucky Bear?”
“I don’t know. I’ve been a little busy Steve!”
“Tony, we need to get to the meeting,” Pepper says.
“For what?”
“You make it sound like I go out jogging for the sole purpose of annoying him.” Steve says as he slides Mari her plate.
“Yeah! Your bad. Where is Bruce?” Tony looks around. “We paired him with you for a reason!”
“Please.”
“Bottoms up.” Tony winces as the first dose is injected into the flesh to the right of his reactor. He sits patiently as Dr. Wu injects the major muscle groups along his chest and diaphragm. When the doctor finishes and turns away Tony rubs at his chest, then takes a deep breath. He smiles when he can breathe easier. After having his chest cut open and having a hunk of metal shoved in, Tony seemed to carry a constant pressure. His muscles struggled against the new configuration they had to work in even after all these years. But since Dr. Wu had brought this new therapy to him, he’s been breathing easier and easier after each visit. Now if only he could get a goodnight’s sleep.
“Yes sir.” Steve sits up and slides Tony’s sweats and underwear off in one pull. He flings off his jacket and starts to take off his shirt only for it to get tangled around his head and arms when he feels a pressure against his crotch. Tony rubs the heel of his foot along the zipper of Steve’s jeans. He applies a little more pressure when Steve pauses. “Something wrong Soldier Boy?”
She nods, coming out into the open. She reaches out and rubs the soft material of the scarf between her fingers.
“Or just let her sleeeeeeeeeeep.” Mari loosens up and tries to reach for the drawer again.
Dr. Wu’s smile grows wider and he turns to his assistant, speaking in Chinese. The assistant stares at him confused before the doctor points to a tray with five syringes on it. The assistant nods and rolls the tray over. Dr. Wu removes a syringe and examines it. He turns to Tony.
“…but it’s art time…”
Over the sound of crumbling rubble and the ringing in his ears Tony can hear crying.
“I’m not keen on sending her off as well but we’re running out of schools pip. And I don’t want her to be home-schooled. She needs to make friends her own age. We can’t keep her locked in the tower.”
“My Pooh plate is pink and yellow.”
“Watch your mouth. Next time I’m cleaning it out with soap.” Tony reaches up to entwine their fingers together as he closes his eyes again.
“No. Stand over here where I can keep an eye on you.” He points to his left, beside the desk.
“Uh no. Natasha just sent me some data from her mission. Asked if I’d look through it for her.”
“We have an agreement,” he says in a dry voice. “Besides, she was only able to do that with Steve’s laptop…”
“And you didn’t let Mr. Romanoff know because...?” asks Sam.
Steve pats her shoulder. “That’s okay. When I was your age, I got sick a lot too.”
“Mommy always said you should treat people like they’re out to get you. Cause they probably are.”
Happy begins the process all over again as Mari looks up to Steve and Tony and asks, “Do I get a lawyer appointed to me if I can’t afford one?”
“I’m sorry sir, but I’m new. If I don’t follow orders exactly…well…you understand what position that puts me in.” A sheepish smile spreads across the agent’s face.
Her head jerks up. “Ice cream?”
“….Is that like anime?”
“Bye Thor!” Mari runs to the glass wall across the lobby to see Thor’s take off.
“What about this one?” he asks.
Steve gives him a swift elbow to the side.
“Sir, your guests have just entered the building,” says Jarvis.
Steve snorts and starts laughing uncontrollably. Mari snickers next to him.
“Thor! Let’s ring the bell!” Captain calls, disarming an agent and swinging him into another one.
Steve snorts and tries to restrain his chuckle when he sees that the metal facets of Tony’s reactor have left red patterns on the side of her face.
If anyone reading this knows Icelandic feel free to correct me. I unfortunately don't have any Icelandic connections nor the time or talent to learn the language so I resorted to google translate. May the language gods have mercy on my soul...
“It was...at first. But...we grew close. Closer than we should have. I don’t know when it happened exactly but one day I woke up and realized we weren’t just pretending to be in love anymore. I wanted to be with you, and you didn’t want to let go. You wanted something that HYDRA couldn’t take from you so we found a priest and got married in secret. That way no matter what happened, no matter how many times HYDRA wiped you, no matter what they took from me, they couldn’t erase what had happened. That was the first decision we had made for ourselves in a very long time.”
Bucky tries his hardest to glare a hole into the back of Steve’s head.
A voice that sounds as if it is coming through a speaker yells, “Are you ready to rumblllleeeee!?!”
Tony pecks a kiss to her head when she nods in understanding. “I love you Kiddo. Ok Pep!” He stands and props his hands on his hips. “Ready to be bored out of my mind.”
“You’re better than your father.”
Mari nods again and sees him move away.
Bruce smirks and stands to turn the screen back on. “A week here and she’s already playing you like a fiddle.”
Clint rolls his eyes. "Point is they are made by a third party that likes to sell to both sides. So this could still be related to Count Douche-ula." He stares right into Steve's eyes when he says the nickname.
“I think you mean Dodgers,” says Bucky.
It feels like his ears pop and sound rushes back.
“Go ahead.”
“Well then,” says the caseworker as she stands, gathering files in her hands. “Just follow me.”
“Don’t Tony me! I don’t care who it is or why! Anyone puts a bullet THAT close to my kid’s head I’m putting one in there’s. What if she had moved Steve!?! Slipped into the shot!?!” He glares at Bucky. “Did you think of that? Did it even occur to you that your amazing marksmanship could have been flawed?”
Steve goes to the jet and finds Sam and Janet talking in hushed tones, staring at the screens in the cockpit.
Steve arches an eyebrow and kneels down to open the drawer. He stares at her curled up form hiding under her quilt. “…What are you doing in there?”
Ugh. Life sucks. But this fic still lives. Reality can claw it out of my cold dead hands.
“Yes!” Thor answers. “In Asguard this would be about the age when a young girl would begin her training as a shield maiden. Thus,” He holds up the shield and hits his fist against it. “Her first shield.”
“To SHIELD’s not mine. My system is better protected.”
“Fight!” Clint yells in his best impersonation of a Mortal Kombat announcer.
“Daddy!”
“We lost communication with the tower,” says Sam.
As they pass a trash can Bucky tosses the paper in. “She can’t.”
Steve picked up the Stark Tab next to him and hands it to his husband over Mari’s head.
Mari lifts onto her tiptoes to look onto the table top. Her eyes catch on one of the sheets with a group of smiling children on it. “Are you buying me friends?”
She jerks her arm away. “Neither. Just drop it.”
When Mari hears the elevator doors close she asks in a small voice, “Are they going to take me away?”
He bursts through the door and jerks the covers back calling, “Mari!?! Mari where are you!?!”
The swear tone goes off.
Ben kneels down next to them. “Oh Mami, they wouldn’t let us see you. We tried to visit as often as we could but they kept moving you. We fought so hard to get you back.”
“Nefaria could have more gear that could worsen your condition close range. We should be able to get through this mission without Ironman. And if we can’t you can pilot the suit remotely.”
“It’s just a little red Steve. No big deal.”
“It’s one o’clock. That’s art time until two.”
“Protected her as best you could.”
“My good…oh you don’t want me. I’m de-I’m defoonk-I’m broken.”
“Ragh!” Sam is made to tilt and his wings clip on the side of the walls sending him careening into a dumpster. “Ugh. Fuck you Barnes!”
Tony struggles to pull the brush through her hair without jerking her head back. On one particular stroke the brush gets stuck halfway through. He tries to extract the hair brush from her hair. “I feel like Paolo…”
The social worker turns to stare at Steve and Tony with an arched brow.
“Biscuit?” Peggy holds out a small plate with various cookies on it.
“I’m sorry Kiddo. Papa has gotta go find his friend. He needs me.” Steve tears himself away and steals himself against the screaming wails behind him to go get his bike.
A loud garbled voice replies over the speaker.
“Are you alright Captain?”
Steve intercepts his path before he can get close. Tony tries to step around him but Steve wraps an arm around his waist. “Tony it’s okay! He wasn’t aiming at Mari.”
“…but how…?”
“I take it since you’re here you didn’t find him.”
“That’s just how it is. My father says so.”
The same garbled voice speaks again.
She whimpers but nods.
“Is that to me or yourself?” she asks in a dry voice.
“Well I am,” she says as she pulls her shirt up.
“You think that matters? I know that logically he doesn’t blame me but you don’t just get over something like that. And with everything that happened after...you need to give him some slack Steve. I’m YOUR long lost best friend. Not his.”
“A shy Stark?” asks Nat. “I never thought I’d see the day.”
memory. One very old memory that is probably outdated.”
“We have a handful of boys in our nursery. Would you like to meet them now? See if any are a good fit?”
Bucky's back straightens. “Who is it?”
Tony and Steve stare at her and then look at the gift wrapped box she has.
“I watched her interview. She was really sad talking about you. Did you love each other?”
“Right away sir.”
“Don’t worry we’ve got everything handled here. I mean really,” Peggy sets the tray down when Mari has her cookies and starts to add a bit of milk to her own tea. “We’re having tea not leaping out of a plane into enemy territory.” She takes a sip of her tea and stage whispers to Mari. “Don’t know where all this caution is coming from, he certainly didn’t have any during the war.”
“Steve is working.” Tony says with a pout.
“Tony…”
“They aren’t wasted, my friend, they’re just put into a different place. You see, the schematics that were used to create me were… Mine and Reed’s brainchild, we thought of them together, with a lot of input from my friends back in the Air Force in regards to the jets and thruster power. I couldn’t have done it without Rhodey’s help. But anyway, Reed helped me build it and so now you have the best tool that the NYPD could possibly have!” He held out his hands, shimmying them a little to make a jazz hand gesture with tiny pieces of confetti flying from his sleeves.
Tony Stark – Inventor extraordinaire, socialite supreme but most of all - business tycoon, one that the world had learned much more about in recent years, particularly more so about the fact that the ‘comeback kid’ seemed to be a name that stuck to him for a reason. After his company was under threat and had actually been fully acquired by Obadiah Stane during the hostile takeover of Stark Industries, Tony had found a way to push himself out of the sticky situation and regain full control of his company through independent companies that he had acquired and built up from scratch. It was a long and trivial pursuit, but Tony emerged triumphant and stronger than ever.
“Please come back… Save me from him, please…”
“I have the confidence in you Tony, I know we can do this, together.”
Steve smiled as he watched each blip on the map fade, turning to Tony. “You did it, everyone’s free again, we did it Tony.” He said, kneeling down next to him and placing a hand over his chest, just over the wires, the gaping wound in his chest still pouring but by this point the flow had lessened.
His body arched upward to Steve’s encouragement, eager to feel more of the surges of electrifying pleasure that jolted through his entire body, and he just kept going. His hips rolling into him, heavy pants as Tony moaned so loudly that he could hear his voice become raspy and his throat felt extremely sore, but he had never been in so much pleasure in his entire life.
Tony jumped into the passenger’s seat, clipping his antenna on the roof of the car causing it to bend a little, but he didn’t seem to realise nor react to it. “What’re you waiting for? Let’s go!”
Steve retracted his arm from around Tony and gestured to his room. “I should get going.”
Steve made a loud sound and ran ahead of his partner, grabbing Tony’s hand to pull him to follow. He could see darting shadows, getting as close as he could to them, distracted by each movement. There was something and whatever it was moved very quickly.
Tony’s sad expression lightened a fraction. The agony and weight on his heart was solid and still very heavy. “You know… I loved her a lot, during the accident the shrapnel from the explosion went into my chest, near my heart. I always say that she took my heart when she left, since... I guess it’s never been the same.”
“Carol?!”
With a sharp gasp, he opened his eyes again, trying to clear the murky vision, that copper taste tainting his mouth once again. His body jerked forward sharply. Grimacing in pain and yet, with his body so numb he was able to feel the fizzling continue in his chest.
Hours passed…Steve tried to sleep, but his insomnia prevented him from doing so. He decided to head down to the empty kitchen for a snack, only to spot Peter Parker swooping in for a midnight snack which consisted of fruit loops, as usual. Steve decided to follow his lead and made himself a midnight snack of the biggest bologna sandwich he could make, devouring it in around five minutes before returning to bed, hearing the faint echo of “You should be a professional eater,” from Peter in the distance, to which he snorted and returned to his bedroom.
Steve tapped the tip of Tony’s nose and smiled. “The king inside the castle is the thing I like the most.”
“We’ll diffuse it. No biggie,” Tony said with a shrug. “Looks simple enough. I just want to know who’s behind this… And why.”
Peter got ready to lift her, having to reinforce the webbing around her again, particularly around her hands. It was then that footsteps behind them were heard, loud clunky steps that made the pebbles of concrete shake.
“Just hold on a second, y’mind giving me the skinny? Listen buddy, detective, all I’ve heard about you is that you’re a special detective but all this? Rocket boots, gizmos coming out of your leg? Glowing hands? I need to know what the heck is going on!”
And with that, he left, leaving Captain America in his dream world, giving him sanctuary, solace and peace.
She gave his arm a light spark, pouting before flying over to the large device.
Then a burly version of the Captain appeared in place of the Colonel, one with a pentagram on his chest, large elongated canines. “Cancerverse? The name alone doesn’t make me like you. Come on, I want someone in between, I want him
“Try isn’t a reassuring word for me, Tony.”
Steve made the motion as though he was breathing, his shoulders raised and slumped accordingly but Tony knew not a breath was escaping those cherry red lips.
The floors were black marble, the walls lined with fine portraiture all of Victor himself, but the style of the paintings gave off a renaissance vibe, that along with the peculiar looking suits of armour that they’d passed in the hallways. Everything about Victor screamed a lust for power and Tony kicked himself for not having noticed this sooner.
Before Tony could reach behind him to say something, the heavy doors slammed shut, the wind pushed Tony’s jacket forward and he was forced to place a hand on his head to help hold his hat down. The sudden gust only made Steve grab onto Tony’s arm protectively, it’s not like a gust of wind could have done much but still, from the second he’d entered this place all he’d wanted to do was look after Tony.
“Stark tech! It works just like a real shield!” Tony explained, though quickly as they dodged another blast.
He was the last thing he had seen – having opened his eyes before the darkness befell him. The last person he had
“Killgrave?”
Zemo was stood proud and tall in the observation deck, laughing as he leaned forward to press on the comm.
“Tony… Please, listen to me… Fight this… You need to fight this.” He breathed heavily, pushing himself up with his pure core strength to reach up toward the man towering over him. He wished he could move, he wished he could stand up to reach for him and grab his face and look into his eyes – but he couldn’t. He couldn’t even move his legs and that made his chest ache with worry.
His fingertips curled over the metal circle, getting a firm grip and pulling himself up to scout left and right. He scoped the now desolate terrain. There was nothing in sight but broken buildings, fallen objects and a couple of large bodies.
Tony just flinched in return, palms placed on the sheets of the fine silk sheets, his grip tightening once he felt the skim. It was difficult to try and keep his knee still, to prevent it from jerking backwards but still he stayed.
“How long is this going to take?” Steve whispered impatiently whilst they waited outside Doom’s mansion. It wasn’t hard to spot that it belonged to him either, it may have been located in the outskirts of the city but it was a giveaway, what with the huge statues of Doom standing outside – the huge caped menace standing with his hand in the air in pose that just resonated a lust for power.
The punch had made the super soldier falter too, he staggered in the air and nearly fell, quickly kicking into action again the moment he felt the surge of pain run down his spine. There was a warm spark he felt for a while, luckily it was that same jolt that brought him back to consciousness before he’d fallen completely, glad that his own thrusters were keeping him a lift.
Peter crept a little closer and reached out to touch her shoulder, his shoulders slumped, very slowly lowering his head to follow and hide his rage. “I listened to you Tony… I stayed down there…”
Tony glanced up from a circuit board he was working on, lifting his large golden framed goggles to perch on top of his head, “There’s a small glitch, Reed…it doesn’t seem to be working properly on some people.”
Tony knelt down and tried to look Steve in the eyes, but they were glazed, unfocused and empty. He needed to snap out of it. Tony would give him time to do so, knowing the pain of flooding memories first hand, when he had lost his own memories not so long ago, it seemed. With deep worry he focused on the man before him, placing his hands gently on either side of Steve’s face and ensuring his head was raised, unable to bear him looking so helpless.
“What about… Steve’s?” Tony stuttered weakly.
“Gone.”
birthday party made him open a seemingly empty can and a spring-snake popped out and scared him so much that he fell over and started crying.
“Bingo.”
Tony’s eyes narrowed, using his zoom in vision to take in the sight much clearer; long armoured covered legs with such defined and intricately made sheets of metal, a long emerald green cape with a hood shadowing his eyes and of course… A mask, with hauntingly stern features that seemed so rigid and robotic it was clear its purpose wasn’t merely for display, it was to instil fear into those who dared to gaze upon it. It sent a shudder down Tony’s spine and he swallowed thickly, this wasn’t the Victor he was used to seeing; he remembered a man with brown hair, relatively handsome features, bright blue eyes that would pierce his soul and give him the creeps simultaneously.
I hate being insecure. Tony Stark is a man of confidence. But what happens when that confidence is nothing but a façade? He drowns, I drown, in my own self-loathing and hatred once again and I become that monster, just as I said I was. I see my father’s face in the bottles and I grab them and I try to drown.
“Tony, listen to me! You can fight this! You’re being controlled; you can fight all of this…” He reached up, with a slow shaky hand to press against Tony’s face as far as he could before Tony looked back at him. “I know you can fight this.” He whispered.
JARVIS let out a bark and MODOK swivelled around to face him.
“Tony, you’re a helluva inventor, pardon my French.”
“I know Buck, we’ll try to get to it!” He said, reaching his hand up and starting to climb the moving jet, which was even harder now that his hand continued to have that tremble to it, the ringing in his ears persisting even though he’d managed to snap out of the daze, it still left that residue.
To honour his fallen companion, he asked the other to repair Tony’s armour for him and he replaced his augmentations with Tony’s, as well as the red and gold slicked armour, that was refined to the standard Tony once had. He wanted part of him with him forever, and with Tony deeply embedded into his heart, he felt that he would always be with him. The armour was just a show of his loyalty to the man; his legs and arms were Tony’s, his chest was the bright star powered reactor. The Captain wanted to show that Tony was part of this team, and no matter what, he always would be. So he stood representing him, he stood representing the saviour of this world with pride and valour. He was now the leader of the Avengers, the sole leader, the guardian of the city and of the world.
Immediately confused, he stammered. “I, it’s not, I wasn’t… I can’t remember I just… Tony, listen to me. I want you to listen carefully while I’m still of a sound mind.” He pressed his palm to the glass to leave a cold print stain. “If something happens and I’m beyond saving, I want you to do it. I want you to kill me. No one else, you.”
“What?” Clint asked over the radio.
Then there was silence as Steve kept his head hung.
“The… Computer…” Tony whispered.
Every time he heard so much as a whisper escape Steve’s mouth he would remember the words that he said and would attempt to stop his eyes from tearing up again. He felt like a child again, scared and alone, wishing his hero was there to shield him from the pains and sufferings of everyday life.
“Guys! My sheets are missing!”
That was Tony’s way of consoling himself.
Tony’s widened eyes focused on the man before him, getting closer and closer until he stopped inches from him. “Steve..?” He asked, with a meek tone tinged with hope. Though he should have known from his countless experiences that sometimes hope was the hardest and most devastating feeling to succumb to…
Natasha brushed her shoulders off, turning to face Tony and Steve properly. “Janet told me… I’ll fill the others in.” There was a sympathy about her voice when she caught sight of Steve’s legs with her own two eyes. It was different hearing about it, but seeing it in person just didn’t sit right. Nonetheless, she signalled a nod at the others, and they too replied with an understanding stare. Everyone knew Steve by this point and knew that he wouldn’t want to talk about what had happened to him when they had other concerns.
“I’ll hold you to that promise, Steve,” Tony murmured against his shirt, reluctantly pulling back to look at the screen.
time.” An extremely unenthusiastic Clint rolled his eyes…then turning his head back to the left. Concern touched his voice. “That smells
“Not just any ‘mutt’, a sophisticated supercomputer, capable of hacking your systems.” JARVIS replied in his thick, pronounced Queen’s-English accent.
She tapped the side of her nose with another all-knowing glance “Your posture gives away more than you think, boyscout.”
That was their end.
Tony cleared his throat. Steve couldn’t help but smirk when he saw a huge arrow pop up from Tony’s hat, pointing down to him in a flashing neon red.
Tony watched the two and gave them an eyebrow raise. Truthfully, their relationship was always obvious to him. In fact, it was something he admired; that subtle adoration. But Tony knew nothing about him was subtle, so he just admired it and knew he would never be a part of such a thing.
There was a flash of embarrassment as he attempted to slope his shoulders a little, give himself a little slump in pose, but it didn’t work. The second he tried to lower himself by instinct his shoulders raised again and chest out to show off his broad frame. Anything else just felt uncomfortable.
Tony knew that they had always had that connection and never acted upon it, but Steve seeing Tony in such a desperate state had finally been the key to the lock. The man was affectionate when it came down to the line, and now they knew mutually.
“It appears that he’s suffering from a large mental instability… Post-Traumatic Stress…”
Tony realised he’d had to explain it all from scratch, and he wasn’t half as good at explaining this sort as Reed was. “There’s… Your body… And well…” He was already fumbling over his own words, so he took a moment to try and compose himself; reaching for his yellow mug once more and taking a huge sip from it. Steve could see the flash of yellow even with the glare from the light above him that obscured his vision of the other side a little, realising that it was Tony’s favourite mug – one that he had gotten him when they had visited Paris together; a yellow mug with a black cat sitting in an red square, a tribute to the ‘chat noir’. His eyes were drawn toward it and Tony could see that. Even when he drew his lips away from the mugs rim he found himself staring at it with nostalgia. Tony had to clear his throat to snap himself away from the wonderful memory of spending such a wonderful time with Steve in Paris.
Steve shrugged off the initial thought that arose in his mind that said ‘guy in a sock’ could’ve been Zemo. This was years later, and hopefully he was long gone. Then he was taken up to his room which at present was bare and white. Tony hadn’t exactly had time to prepare or decorate, considering that he didn’t even realise that Captain America was real yet alive until what was just a day ago.
Extremis’ powers now had little to no limitations, especially with the new symbiote-infused armour that he was using enhancing his abilities even further. This meant he effectively had no limit, at least, he was yet to reach the limits of his armour; Extremis was all bio-tech, all controlled by mental stimulation. He strode past, his headset taking in each exceptional detail of every immaculate device that he passed ranging from a small scale Hadron Collider to modified versions of the nanny-bots that Richards had used to look after his children whilst he, Ben, Johnny and Sue were on missions together. Reed
The director lowered the folders he held extremely slowly, unsure if he was just becoming delusional from all the stress he was under, but he could’ve sworn that he noticed Steve’s hand move. Was it possible that he was waking up after the wires were pulled, that soon?
Tony knew exactly what they had done and even though it was for Steve’s own good, there was a part of him that was just considerably overwhelmed with guilt for knocking him out like that. It looked as though they had just thawed him out from the ice again, the way he was resting on that table with others staring at him. It sent an unmistakable and resounding sense of déjà vu coursing through his entire system. Throwing a man that had rested for 70 years back into a coma and induced sleep for further scientific testing was a hollow experience for Tony. Slowly he exhaled yet another sigh of overexertion, oozing pure heartbreak. His hand brushed up over his chest and clutched his aching heart while his eyes stilled upon the profile of the sleeping beauty before him. It even hurt to
“Did you hit your head too hard there, Tony? You’re starting to sound like those sappy soap operas that you enjoy watching.”
Oh, and that very evening Steve Rogers indeed discovered that Tony Stark had a gadget for
His moment was interrupted.
“We’re not going to die,” she said, clutching a little tighter to Jessica. She was firm, reassuring, giving the other woman a strength from her heart that the fight had worn at.
“Don’t be absurd. If that was the case don’t you think all of you would be zombies to the government?”
As soon as the doors opened he saw his lab in disarray, the bots fallen, the screens flickering to life, a red flashing light and siren going on and off until Tony stepped inside himself and turned it off by commanding so. Seeing his bots lifeless made his chest tighten. Stricken with panic, he went from one to the other, seeing that they all had been taken down.
“Steve? Cap!?” he called out – but no answer.
“You’re late…” Steve murmurs in a groggy tone.
“Steve…! Steve! What’s wrong?!” Tony yelled over the microphone.
“I can prove it to you!” Steve said in a determined voice, “You had a false bottom on your drawer, you kept a figurine of me in there!”
“What’s taking so long?” Tony asked, looking up at Peter with his hands placed on his hips.
T’challa stepped through large metallic doors and stood still until they slammed shut behind him. He squinted at Reed, whose body was on one side of the lab in front of some spare parts while his neck and arms were extended to the other side of the lab. T’challa shook his head in profound lack of understanding as to why he would insist on using his powers so unnecessarily.
“Go go Stark radar!”
“…Stairs would be the other option.” Tony groaned “Thirteen flights of stairs…”
As much as he tried to adapt, there was a flaw with the powering system which was why he was using these chips. In the morning he’d try and find something to use to make some solar technology. A lot of hospitals were powered by solar technology when he had been caught in the initial explosion, so there was a thought in his mind that maybe, just maybe, there were scraps of some lying around which would make his job much easier. In truth, he was tired of using makeshift items; although it tested his ingenuity it also became tiresome and reminded him of the countless times where he’d had to act using what he had. It was nice to be tested now and then but this test seemed endless.  If something or somebody out there could cut him a little slack at least, it’d be appreciated.
Killgrave laughed. “Soon your friends will walk in here and they’ll be under my control, but when this device finishes calibrating completely they won’t have to come in here – everyone in this city, and soon the world will be under my control!”
“Seems we’ve rescued all the cats in the city,” Tony concurred, resting his head on the back of the chair, his hat just balancing on the top of his head, about to tip off at any small movement.
Naturally, the tower was only built after the entire city was cleaned up and restored, and one of the first pieces of mail that Tony had gotten when the tower was finally built was the IOU that he had left the store keeper for those clothes. Needless to say, the store owner got more than they bargained for when a cheque for $1,000 was sent in return.
“He clearly wants to get out.” Reed murmured darkly.
Tony had never felt so much yearning in his entire life. Living a ‘privileged’ life meant he could have most things, but someone to love had always been something he was inches from obtaining before it was so cruelly stolen from him. But as he felt the gentle touches to his hair his eyes fluttered open, to finally notice that Steve was awake, to feel his breath, to feel the warmth of his fingertips as his thumb brushed against his jaw. Steve was cupping Tony’s face; one hand there the other with its grip tightening in Tony’s spectacularly soft black curls.
“Okay” Steve nodded and they started walking.
“Steve” came the concerned voice from behind him.
“You look good today” Tony said from behind the glass.
“Steve? What’s wrong?” the red head asked while letting Steve inside the apartment. Even though he was a panting nervous wreck and jittered all over the place, Steve noticed Nat tuck something that suspiciously looked like a gun behind her back.
God would anyone believe if he said Tony Stark was irrecoverably in love with Steve Rogers
“But I’m not everyone. Am i?” there was a faint trace of hurt in the other man’s eyes now.
They were getting along really well and sometimes Steve believes he could see glimpses of the real woman under her fake persona.
Sam also congratulated and hugged him while Bucky went to the kitchen to get glasses. Turns out the bottle was expensive champagne which they were now sipping from coffee mugs because Steve and his best friend didn’t find the need to buy any other kind of glasses and waste money as they rarely drank anything other than beer inside the apartment.
JARVIS interrupted his stare down with the glass “Sir, it’s time for your regular shot of chlorophyll”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Won’t be enrolling her in sports then huh?” asks Sam.
“Oh I know the kinds of parties Tony throws.” She says as she pours tea into a tea cup. “And I’m fairly certain they were more party than tea. Here you are dear.” She hands the cup and its saucer to her.
“On a scale of 1 to 10?”
“Hashtag get that out of my face.”
Steve turns and sees Mari at the pantry pouring Coco Crunchos into her mouth. “Mari no! You put those down right now.”
Tony sighs and picks her glasses up. He cleans the lenses on his shirt before putting them on her face. The moment the spectacles are on she is rushing off again. Tony chases after her and calls, “Slow down! I swear it’s like chasing a squirrel.”
Tony sits up. “Lets take this out of here.”
"...please?"
“Prude.”
Bucky arches a brow at him. “Are you serious?”
“Where is Tony now?” Steve asks.
“You have a file on Mari’s mother?”
“Hey!” Mari shoots up and races after him.
The figure standing over him looks up. Then with a slow movement the rifle rises.
She looks down and hugs her bear to her chest. “Yes Papa.”
“Some form yeah, like body armour. This here? This is a fucking tank. That kid was either fucking lucky and grabbed the right files or is fucking brilliant. In which case do you do assassinations? Job security ya know, can’t be out done by toddler.”
“You don’t think our daughter is gonna change the world?”
“Run,” the creature rasps out before roaring and leaping forward.
“You think we’d just be satisfied with visiting my dead nephew’s only child?” Ben asks leaning forward.
Tony arches an eyebrow at him. “Excuse me?”
Steve goes into the elevator and gives them one last wave before the doors close. Tony turns and sees Mari staring at him expectantly.
Steve nods and runs to the stairs. The rest of the team follows and the agent returns to the lobby.
She giggles and wiggles her legs. “It’s a really naughty word.”
Steve takes Mari’s hand and leads her back towards her room. Over his shoulder he says, “Surprisingly enough, none of them wanted to work for us after Loki turned the last one into a frog.”
Steve’s shoulders slump. How could he not have seen this? He had been running around all day looking for the man that had inadvertently taken so much from Tony and his husband had been worrying himself into a fit about whether it would be Bucky or the Winter Soldier he found. That maybe this was the one time he didn’t come home. He walks over and pulls Tony up by his arms.
As Clint and Mari start to acquaint themselves with each other Tony goes to the elevator.
Steve and Tony share a look with each other. What kind of therapist had they been sending her to?
Tony groans leans back into him. “Where’s the Kiddo?”
As Bucky puts the salt and pepper on the table Steve asks, “Mari, what do you want me to add to your porridge?”
Three days later…
Bucky glances around and flexes his hands.
She answers with a grumble. Then, without lifting her head, she stretches out her hand reaching for her fork.
“You mean Stark’s brat right? Hey just between us, she’s an android right? Like they wanted a kid so Stark Pinocchioed it and whipped her up in his lab. Been reading the things they’ve been posting about her on Youbook. No way is a five year old that smart unless she’s some sort of freak.”
“Tony, the head,” says Bruce.
“Fuckin’ bullshit.” Bucky looks up confused when the swear alert goes off.
“There was nothing to tell you. They’ve been filing complaints, social services keeps turning them down. They’re still unfit to care for her, they still don’t have custody, and they still have yet to contact Mari.”
Just as Tony places his hands over the keyboard, Bruce reaches across him and turns off the screen.
Bucky glances over the back of the couch and has to swallow down a sigh when he sees Steve’s tense shoulders and kicked puppy look. Did he have to look like that everytime he asked how Bucky was doing? “It was...not terrible…”
“Why didn’t you come to us? To me? Why this hiding in the shadows game?” Steve takes a step towards him but Bucky takes one back.
The social worker holds her hand out to Mari.
Steve leans against the counter next to him. “So what do you suggest?”
“Oh. Is she the reason we have to put a child lock on Jarvis?”
“Yeah,” Clint says holding up his hand. “Is it true Stark got hacked by a five year old?”
“I didn’t think you’d remember this place,” says Bucky.
“You used a bad word,” she says in a quiet voice.
Mari goes quiet and looks away.
“It’s amazing really. If you cut a flatworm in half it will regenerate into two worms. My ma used to say love was like a flatworm.” He laughs when Mari’s face scrunches up. “Yeah, not the most appealing analogy but it’s not wrong. She used to tell me that love was like a flatworm because no matter how many times you cut it up and give it to people, you still have a whole worm to give someone else.” He unwraps the towel and uses it to squeeze at her still damps ends.
“And get a chance to spoil you rotten and turn you into a stereotypical rich kid? Definitely,” says Tony.
“That’s all anyone expects.” She gives her cheek one more pat before leaning back. “Now go into that cabinet over there and open the bottom door. There is a little something in there that I think will help.”
The super husbands look at her and burst into laughter.
“They already hate me. Looking like I’m from Mr. Roger’s neighborhood isn’t going to change that. Besides, you’re stressing out the k-i-d-d-o.” Tony nods down at Mari who is looking between the two with her hands fretting at her hair.
Tony turns and gives his husband an annoyed frown. Ignoring this, Mari gasps and turns to her social worker.
“What happened!?!” Steve demands. The minute he had gotten the call that there was an attack and his family had been involved, his heart had been beating a mile a minute. The fact that no one outside the tower seemed to have any information only frustrated him to the point where he was five seconds from punching through a wall.
“Do you want me to eat the eggs or watch this gross amount of semipublic affection?” Mari asks, looking up. “I can’t do both.”
“That’s a bit old school for you.”
“Did you have a good time today?”
“Especially with Mr. I-got-my-ass-handed-to-me-across-all-of-Brooklyn as her Pops,” says Nat.
Mari yelps as he tries to yank the band off her wrist. “Stop! That hurts!”
“Take your time pip. I’m right here. Always will be. I’m not going anywhere.”
“Well, one might say that the delicate science of measuring highly combustible materials to create a symphony of volatile reactions is an art…”
“Well I’ve got it from here.” He takes a step forward but pauses when the agent steps back and pulls Mari with him.
"He's at this one." Bucky points to the one in the States.
“I swear to God Barnes, you ask me one more time if I’m okay with this, I’m making you move into the penthouse with us.”
“I don’t mean to make problems…” she squeaks, staring at her shoes.
“Yeah, that. And it matches the Hawking radiation predictions but-um-but string theory has been able to-to guess certain types of black-holes so THAT’S constin-consthent-”
“What are you trying to say?” Steve asks.
“Are you satisfied enough to go to sleep now?” Steve asks.
Tony turns and frowns to see the frazzled social worker stomping back down the hall. Her shoes make loud snapping noises as they make contact with the tile floor.
“I figured you’d like to join your family at the park.”
“Punk! You get back here and explain why you named a teddy bear after me!” Bucky goes racing after him.
He always hated therapists. He hated talking about his feelings. They were his feelings he did not need to pay some quack to tell him what he was feeling. But he was not going to pull Mari out of care she may need because he was emotionally stunted. This Dr. Krevin was a psychiatrist who worked with the state and ran a small practice. He did not have any complaints or suits filed against him but the reviews were ho-hum. Tony would have rather sent her to a therapist him and Steve had vetted but Bruce was concerned that changing therapists could hinder any progress she had made with the current one.
Tony pulls her back a little and runs his hands over her head and over her body. “No. I think she’s alright.”
“Still a little sore but I’ve been breathing easier than before we started.”
“You’ll have to go send someone down. Intercommunications aren’t working. More specifically they’re not being processed right. You’ll get to the desk but they won’t be able to understand you.”
“That you’re chicken?” Steve tries to pin him to the ground and gets an elbow to the gut. “Just talk to me Buck!”
Bruce watches them whiz up with slumped shoulders. Thor steps up next to him. “May I offer my assistance?”
“I know but Pops is really worried for his friend. He’ll be back soon.”
“Right!” She nods before her mouth twists up. “What shots am I calling?”
Both Steve and Callaghan pause. Steve arches a brow. “She really told you that?”
“Didn’t you say she was the daughter of an Icelandic immigrant?”
“Sorry we’re late. We got a little sidetracked,” says Ms. Flander.
“No it’s not. Those files have nothing to do with Jarvis’ system. That looks like a data-“
“You never know how deep these things go Captain. Besides I’m surprised you’re not keeping an eye on them yourselves.”
“Please Mari. I know it’s a big drop but you can make the jump. Trust me. I’ve seen you hyped up on sugar. You can make this, easy.”
“That’s not necessary Mr. Stark. Vacations just make me antsy to get back to work. I just need a day home with a cup of tea and bad TV. Thank you though.” She nods to Tony and Steve and gives Mari a little wave before leaving.
“Yes. Thank you.” Tony walks over and sits on the chair across from them.
“Sam. Sam Wilson.” He holds out his hand and Mari gently grips a finger to give it a quick shake before coiling back behind the couch. “I’m a friend of Steve’s.”
“Now do you kiss your mother with that mouth sir?” he asks.
“Then you are clear to go. I’ll see you next month to see how everything is.”
“Bucky wait!” As Steve breaks into a run so does Bucky.
Tony pursed his lips and sighed. “Well, hopefully you’ll find whatever it is you’re looking for in the desert.”
“I saw red.” He breathed out, but that didn’t lift the heavy feeling in his chest.
There they stay…
“No, I can’t lose you, too…”
“Seven!?”
Two to the left entrance, five to the right, six in the middle that would rotate every two minutes and walk in a circle – Having figured out the pattern, he turned to whisper it.
“It’ll have to do; we need Thor’s strength and Carol’s power too,” Tony justified his choice.
“It wasn’t worth it...” He muttered to himself, placing the tip of the bottle to his lips and inhaling the bitter smell that rose into his nostrils that flared at the smell.
Even though they had let go, Steve kept his arm around Tony’s waist. “God… This is beautiful…” The view was breath-taking. After going to every gallery that day, observing and taking in every piece, not one of them could match up to how beautiful that moment was. He could see the entire city, all lit up, New York in all of its beauty was something unparalleled by anything he’d ever seen before. But of course, nothing made the moment more beautiful than being by Tony’s side.
Tony’s mouth opened wide, letting out a yelp at the feeling but then what came next surprised him. Steve’s movements were short and jerky, quick though, as the fingers began to pulse inside him. Steve had managed to get the fingers to vibrate. The flush extended from Tony’s face down his entire torso, his body filling with jolts of pleasure.
it. He enjoyed watching each of them, every single person that had ever doubted him and his abilities squirm because they simply weren’t strong enough to handle the sheer power of the gift that Tony wanted to bestow on them, because they simply weren’t ready.
“Tony Stark, detective extraordinaire, master of technology. I’m sure you’ve heard of me.” Tony shook Steve’s hand too. The first thing that Steve noticed, however, was how cold Tony’s touch was. It sent a shiver running through his spine, and just as he pulled back the tips of their fingers met and there was a small spark, causing Steve to sharply withdraw his hand and shake it in the air a few times.
“It hit me, Tony. You think that’s a good sign? It’s not good. I don’t hate technology, as you think I do, I just… I can tell when it’s doing more harm than good, it doesn’t take a genius or a technical practitioner to figure that out.”
“Great! I’m going to have fun doing this…” His finger lowered on the button before pressing it with a triumphant grin plastered on his face. The many screens in the room revealed the robots, and the police fighting them. Steve stood by, noticing the familiar faces from the precinct, it was a relief to see no one was hurt and that they had all banded together. The second Tony pressed the button the huge bots fell in unison, slamming to the ground with dust clouds surrounding their now lifeless bodies.
“Okay, okay! I give!” he yelped in surrender. “He’s… Through that door…” He pointed to one of the main doors.
Janet giggled to herself. “They were doing their own thing… Together.”
“Yeah…”
“So you think we’re beyond pleasantries, and yet I still catch you calling me director?”
Half of the words were swallowed by the static, the other half were inaudible. Steve did all he could to relay the message but he wasn’t sure what exactly he was dealing with, or why the puppeteer decided to control those villains, but it did occur to him that one of the villains they were dealing with wasn’t exactly subject to influence; a Doombot. Robots couldn’t fall under the powers of the master of persuasion.
“I was discriminated against Steve,” Tony was hesitant to admit. He hated being the victim like that, but it was true and had been very evident in the park during their first mission. “But you… You stand up for me every time.”
“Killgrave! Come on, take Stark back!”
The explosion was huge, but they were all out of the way.
Gazing above him and catching the dark hollow eyes, Steve stepped forward, closer to Tony and picked him up, raising his hand and punching through the already dented armour until he could feel the weak crack in Tony’s body. Tony wretched in pain, screaming out with a voice hoarse and strained, trying his hardest to keep his eyes open to meet Steve’s, his tear ducts brimming with crystal tears.
“Verily…” Thor replied, using his usual booming tone as partially hushed with seriousness as it was, spinning his hammer a few times before using it to smash through the window, latching onto the handle and soaring out, with Carol and Vision flying after him.
“Mysterious shootings and heart-attacks huh? I’m no CSI agent but this is starting to all add up.”
Tony ran into the kitchen to see the others there for breakfast, running to the fridge and pulling out some burgers from the night before, and other bits and pieces that he could find. While T’Challa insisted that keeping Steve on a strict diet was important to observe any changes in his system or any potential reactions, right now Tony didn’t have time to think, nor was he particularly capable of thinking clearly. He grabbed what he could with the others staring at him, utterly bewildered.
“Implanting these chips in our heads and making us slaves; a price for you saving us…” Rhodey added with fury in his voice.
“As long as we assemble and work together, we’ll take any threat down. Remember, Barton!” Carol encouraged them in a loud commanding tone that was strong enough to light the flames of urgency in the rest of the team, that and trust as well as the courage that they needed at that moment in time.
Then darkness.
The pang of metal was all Steve could hear for a while, it were as though he could feel himself slipping again but was quickly jolted back to full awareness the moment that Tony threw one of the creatures to the wall with immense strength, making a loud crash as it swooped through some of the equipment that was set up. It was as though Tony had to fight his way through all of these deformed creatures to try and get to Zola who was busy running from machine to machine to trigger chemical releases.
“You’re going to kill us all!” Tony yelled in desperation.
This is what he had become; a monster.
“I’ll save you.” He promised.
it, he could feel every ounce on his frame, he could feel his bones bending inwards and caving in on him.
“You have yourself a deal. Didn’t they name those after you?” Tony felt a huge weight lift off his shoulders, coaxing him wasn’t as hard as he thought it’d be.
“You can feel my wings… See, only other angels can feel each other’s wings…” Steve explained, drawing off what he could remember being told during his ‘dream’ of being in limbo.
Nerves overwhelmed him as he stood before the final door, but with Steve by his side he felt invincible.
All Tony could hear was mutters in that extremely strong Brooklyn accent. Tony could tell. Growing up on Long Island meant that he was used to hearing a particular accent, and Steve’s was definitely out of the blue – old school, strong, a hint of rough edge to each word, a slur. It had a hint of Woody Allen’s voice, or like the guy was straight out of ‘The Wise guys’. He’d always noticed it would flare up when Steve was concerned, and would return to its formal well pronounced accent when he was trying to deliver instructions. It was soothing, strangely.
Anyway, after his visit and return home, he was a little tired – not exhausted, but ready to fall into bed. His mattresses were rather hard, used to the rigid feeling of his own bunks, modern mattresses provided little to no lumbar support for the larger framed super soldier.
“Cap, look! Catch!” he said, throwing it at him to try and at least slow him down, though not throwing it hard enough to hurt him. Steve was smacked in the back before he had the time to turn around and he jolted in the air, spinning around and grabbing the shield, with a growl, placing it on his back.
“I have a heart!” It yelled. “You do not understand, you will never understand!”
“Damsel in distress.” Steve said through clenched teeth, attempting to keep the armour away as it stood with its heels digging into the floor, making an extremely loud screech on the metal tiles below and began to throw its weight into the shield.
“What?” Tony asked, turning his head.
“Tell me if I’m hurting you.”
He took a breath, raised his head and regained a strong confident posture again, exhaling as he folded the letter and kept it in his chest pocket of his white shirt.
“Yeah, good idea.” Tony waved a little too eagerly, running to the car and almost tripping again over that last step, but Steve ducked down instinctively and caught Tony.
“Steve, I’ve learned a lot from those games. And one thing I’ve learned is to not waste your resources for the boss fight on the lackey before it!” He pointed to JARVIS who was by the computers, already wired in via his tail and collecting data, but before he had the chance to MODOK turned around, yelling out frantically before shooting a blast at him. Tony ran in front of his prized creation.
“You wouldn’t have come searching for me if I wasn’t valuable.” Steve replied, reaching out for the mirror and touching the surface, his fingers pressed against it, glowing azure meeting Tony’s cyan, locking with such a fierce intensity.
“You okay, Tony?” He asked.
Steve nipped, bit and lapped, unable to get enough of the handsome man he had in his lap.
“Tony, while you were sleeping I’d managed to get some food for him, I got him just as T’Challa and Hank had asked; the balanced diet but it’s still not enough.”
“Are you kidding? Are you ranking me lower than Danny Rand? I feel insulted.”
“Because it’s my work, and my work will always, always be better than Oscorp,” He replied firmly, showing off his hand as he held it up and wiggled his fingers. Peter huffed happily in return and then crawled a little closer to Tony.
“He’s not a lab rat!” Tony screamed with frustration, pulling out of T’challa’s grip. Perhaps it was a mix of lack of sleep and too much coffee but he felt heated, his emotions were brimming and he threw a couple of papers off the table. “He’s not to be studied like that! He’s a person, he’s alive, he’s a real man! You can’t keep him like this!” He blinked away the tears.
“I want to feel more of you…” Steve said, dazzling eye looking up, biting on Tony’s lower lip. It dragged and Tony was pulled down by the strong grip.
“Tony Stark.” It replied in a child-like voice.
“Do…”
Steve nodded in understanding; that and he was all too familiar with those comic books, after all there was once upon a time when the policeman had been an aspiring comic book artist – but that was another story for another day.
“Did you get what I asked for Rhodey and Pepper?”
It looked as though Steve hadn’t a clue as to what he’d done, or didn’t know how it happened.
Tony staggered out, practically falling on the window. His heart was beginning to hurt; a familiar constriction that made him lightheaded from overexertion as it beat rapidly in his chest. A shaky hand rose to pinch the bridge of his nose, Tony sighed and tried to rid himself of the fit of fear that had been building in him only moments before but only managed to exhale shaky breaths. His fingers slid down the screen in front of him before he jumped back at the sudden thud Steve had made with his scratches. He trembled with fear, attempting to try and slow his breathing down for that moment, arms wrapping around himself in dire need of some comfort. It had all happened so quickly, so much so that Tony still had to process what had just happened.
An old man peered out of a window of the old, beaten down set of apartments they were parked outside. Steve lived in the heart of Brooklyn which wasn’t exactly the nicest of areas. Tony wasn’t used to it, that was for sure. He shook his fist at the honking car and yelled.
“What do you mean, you gave him two servings right? You know he’s a super soldier so his metabolism…”
“You promise me?”
In his grazed hand he held the bright pulsing light, limping up to Tony who had regulated the systems, leaning on the huge computers for support, barely able to stand himself. Steve stood opposite him and handed him the pulsing device. Tony stared at it with hatred and resentment, pain and agony, so much so that it made his blood boil, to think this made him hurt Steve, and made him distance himself from his friend. All because of this hand held device that empowered hatred, all because he tried so desperately to fix it as though it were a part of him. But Steve’s words had spoken to him, they deeply did and had managed to embed themselves enormously into his heart, and with that held the light, holding it out and crushing it in his fist.
“Incompatibility with upgrades. System failure.” The Captain swung his arm up and kept it directed to her, firing a powerful shot which she countered with her own, screeching with a mix of agony and pure corruption. She switched to dive at them, Tony ducking out of the way this time as Steve grabbed her with ease and slammed her to the ground. He didn’t stop there; mercilessly he swung her from side to side until metal shards flew from her face, cracks appearing in the newly fitted plate.
“Oh yeah, where is Doom? Where is Reed Richards?!” Tony asked, firing the repulsor blast only for it to bounce off the same sort of invisible barrier.
“I miss flying. I could’ve been there in two seconds flat.” He mumbled while walking, head low and focused on his hand. His mind drifted back to the armour he had to discard earlier before sifting through the rubble, sighing at the loss.
Observation mode activated.
Slowly he eased him on the Egyptian cotton sheets.
Technically the Avengers Mansion classified as a castle but it had nothing on what he had in store.
“Definitely… It’s like we’re…”
“Norman, up to your old tricks again?!” Tony shouted, coughing a bit as the smoke seeped through the eyeslits of the mask, causing him to shut his eyes tightly before they began to water.
“So, about that room…”
“You can undress me.”
The repulsors shot a burning ray which Tony managed to sidestep. His eyes widened and he tried to make his way toward him without being shot in the process.
“Stop it.” Tony clenched his fists.
Tony didn’t reply, then moved, the purple light giving Steve a better view of the damage; Tony’s entire arm was missing, his left arm was severed from the shoulder down with only segments of his shoulder armour left hanging from it.
“Hey hey now.” Tony said with a pout, looking up at Tony, “I do believe you, it’s just angels I don’t believe in. I trust you with all of my heart Steve, as cheesy as that sounds.”
He was confident and gentle, they both were, but right now Tony wanted to see more of the Captain.
At that moment, he saw it. He saw a man in glorious red and gold armour step out and fire a blast from his palm at Tony, knocking him flat on his back to the ground. Tony roared and tried to get back up, clawing at the leaves around him before a man in stunning red white and blue stepped up to him, standing over him, staring with wonderfully azure eyes as he held a strange looking gun to his forehead.
“It’s a start,” Tony finished, ushering the Fantastic Four to show off his and Steve’s personalised floor filled with joy, and unable to explain how happy he was that they had built that room together. That they had built themselves a home again, and it would always be
“Jump start…” he mouthed.
Boomerangs eyes narrowed, sucking at his tongue and clicking it. “Tch, you’re no fun.” There it was, a thick Bostonian accent took its place.
“Let’s finish it!”
“Steve!” Tony yelled over and over, his own hands hitting at the glass before he decided enough was enough. He ran to suit up, putting on the very suit that he had used before, being sure to push through both doors and then into the box itself, rushing up to Steve as quickly as he could to sling his arms around him.
Tony pulled at the flesh that he had between his teeth and stared up at Steve, the tendrils of blood dripping from his mouth as he feasted upon the poor innocent soul that they were ripping apart. The taste returned to him, that sensation and buzz he felt from the kill, and reached for the part he craved the most; the heart. Before he managed to get there Steve punched his hands through the ribs and yanked out the heart as he’d done before, taking a bite into it himself. Tony let a guttural growl escape the back of his throat and pushed himself closer, biting into the exposed side of the heart while Steve ate too. They both shared the heart together, eating with such joy.
