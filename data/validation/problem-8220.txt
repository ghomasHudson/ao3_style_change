God. They used to kiss each other goodnight every day.
They sit like that for a few hours while Peter sleeps. They check his temperature every half an hour and continuously place cooling towels on his forehead, but it takes until the early hours of the morning for Peter’s fever to break.
Tony frowns. “You -”
“But you chose to lie to me, for
His suit’s taken considerable damage, he he can’t fly as fast as he’d like and his faceplate isn’t fully closing anymore, but damn it if he’s gonna let that stop him.
But this was why he was doing this - because this century was his home now. And he missed Brooklyn. Not just the Brooklyn he grew up in, but as his home in general.
A sob wrenches itself out of his throat, and before he can even feel embarrassed, he’s being pressed against Steve’s chest.
Tony eventually comments on his sudden shyness, and Steve just tells him he only wants to make sure he treats him right. That’s all.
, at least, and because since Tony avoids thinking about Siberia and Thanos and Titan, that’s what counts.
Steve flinches like Tony slapped him, and yeah, Tony definitely still feels the tug in his heart whenever Steve looks like that.
Steve drives the car himself, even though Tony could effortlessly acquire a chauffeur for them, because it’s more personal like this - or so he says.
Tony shudders and revels in how safe he feels.
Steve forces himself to shut up. He’s just making it worse.
“Also...” Tony goes on without indicating that he’s picking up any of Steve’s reactions. “Half the Universe is dead. Hardly matters.”
Steve forces himself to take a deep breath. “Sweetheart, I can’t believe you were scared to tell me that.”
A guy with a weird masks and repulsor blasts on his shoes, a screaming man with a naked, blue torso and a woman with what looks like antennas growing right out of their head.
The waiter brings them sparkling water - because Tony’s trying to stop drinking, and the pride shining in Steve’s eyes is worth it.
Tony glances back at Rhodey, who’s watching their exchange silently.
Tony freezes. “What?”
“Oh,” Tony responded brazenly, “you know, the usual. Kept Bruce from murdering Clint, and Thor from starving, so I think we can call this evening a success.”
Because Steve isn’t talking to him anymore.
Tony extended his hand to Steve, and Iron Man and Captain America flew into the sky, off to save New York once more.
“Is everything okay between you?”
On the floor, things were lying about that Tony had accumulated here over time: blankets and pillows, some of Steve’s shirts, a sling from when Tony’d broken his arm that Steve had to beg him to keep wearing almost every day.
The waitress stopped by to bring their drinks. Steve didn’t do a very good job of hiding his sceptic looks towards Tony’s order - after a few minutes Tony held up his drink and offered it to Steve. “Wanna try?”
He feels Tony getting ripped away from him and there’s nothing he can do except sit there and hope that Tony really wasn’t scared, that Tony didn’t lie to him.
(Wanda and Sam were back and well, and save for Rhodey, nobody else had any severe injuries. It does little to calm his nerves.)
He knows it’d probably be better for him to get to work, and distract himself, but his hands won’t really move towards it.
Dummy returns, this time thankfully with the right bottle in his claw.
Steve has, in fact, made it worse.
Maybe it hadn’t been such a good idea to bring Thor and Hulk along though - shortly after they had sat down in their seats, they noticed a vendor carrying snacks walking through the ranks, which was when the quiet, relaxing part of their outing was over for a moment.
Tony held up a hand to silence him. “Hold up right there. Are you seriously asking me to fund your weapons project?
Tony declines. He knows he has to do this by himself.
“I never wanted it to end like this.”
“Thought it’d be a nice throwback,” Tony says when they’re standing in front it.
Tony breathed out and focused on the task in front of him.
His chest feels tight; guilt and longing both fighting for space.
The thing is, Tony doesn’t even know if he’s even avoiding Steve and his team. Or if repairing his suit is the only hing he knows how to do anymore.
Tony’s face softened and stepped towards Steve to take his hand. “Hey, that’s okay. There’s no rulebook here. You’re enough.’’
And he did try, to let Tony handle things by himself, even if that made him worry sometimes.
“And Mr. Whitman’s lectures are just
It wasn’t like he thought Omegas shouldn’t speak their mind, but talking like that would even get an Alpha into a fight.
Steve just shakes his head, still smiling. “Sure he did.”
The stab wound in his side might or might not be infected; he hasn’t looked at it yet, and the pain faded into background noise ever since -
Tony blinks at him. “So? ‘m barely sober anyway.”
(Also, a foolish part of him is hoping they’ll be able to reconcile after this.)
Throughout he whole flight, he’s aware of Rhodey’s worried glances, but forbids himself from returning them. He’s right after all; this is
“I’m sorry,” was the first thing that cake out of Steve’s mouth and all Tony could do was stare. “I shouldn’t have... said what I said. Earlier, I mean. I realize you probably don’t feel the same way and -”
It wasn’t like flying. Hell, it wasn’t like driving a fast car, either, but he couldn’t seem to shake that ridiculous grin. Steve was yelling something behind him that Tony couldn’t quite understand, by it sounded happy, and Tony’s heart swelled even more.
Peter blinks at him quizzically and Tony doubts he understood half of what he just said.
They remain like that for what feels like ages. Steve is a silent, steady presence next to him; one hand around his shoulders, the older holding Tony’s palm to his chest.
“I want to make things right with you,” Steve whispers, quietly, like a confession.
"Aye, Ma’am,” Clint responded, and off they went.
Steve huffed, but didn’t say anything.
(He wasn't proud of it, the way the thought of Tony made heat pulse through him; he was in way too deep.)
Tony snorts; he can’t help it.
The dance at their wedding. Tony smiling brighter than Steve’s ever seen.
Tony takes a deep breath, as if sterling himself for something. “Thank you for watching Peter. You know, last week.”
Steve doesn’t even know why he’s so unprepared for that, because it clearly shouldn’t be a surprise.
He didn’t even get to say goodbye before Bucky had fallen to the ground. Again.
“Steve.’’ Tony’s tone was calm, resolute. He cut Steve off, but Steve was almost grateful for it. He didn't know how to properly express the feeling of never wanting to loose Tony again, even though he wasn't even really sure they'd get back together. “We can’t do this now, not here. Do you understand me?’’
Steve gets up and turns away from him. He can’t bear to look at Tony’s face, knowing it’ll miss the warmth he used to look at him with.
“Someone get to Nat, she needs help!”
suit of course, the one that makes him Captain America, but the fancy, uniquely tailored ones Tony used to buy him for every event he dragged him to.
He recognizes FRIDAY threatening to end Lockdown Protocol on her own behalf, which just seems ridiculously funny to him; he’d created her after all, who was she to abolish protocols he’d put in place?
It sucked, plainly spoken. To have the possibility of Steve returning his feelings right before his eyes, without anything that he could do about it.
Steve handles him gently, looks into his eyes for confirmation before removing his clothes, kisses him all the way through prep, runs a soothing hand along Tony’s side.
In the end, Rhodey hauls him bodily up the stairs, and since Tony’s not really in control of his limbs, he can’t put up much of a fight.
Tony latches onto that like a lifeline.
“My turn!” Steve heard Clint yelling. He was trying to wrestle the remote away from Natasha, without much luck.
“I love you all,” Steve informed them brightly. “You’re like, like a family to me, you know?”
Tony glances at the dining hall, biting his lip. “But this reminds me of better times.”
“Stupid mortals,” he growls, swinging at them with his fist. “I have a
Which also makes him painfully aware of the fact that they need to talk.
Stark huffed, his stature remaining tense, even though he was a good foot shorter than Fury. If Steve didn’t know better, he’d think Stark was Alpha too. (And he had, for a good amount of time, until he’d caught a whiff of his scent just a few hours earlier.)
“Excuse me. I’m only being efficient!”
Tony tenses.
It’s not surprising, really, that Steve would try to settle in again, but -
“I said no, Steve!” Tony interrupts him loudly, his eyes are wide and frantic.
Tony sighs. “What do you think I called you for? Come in.”
“Yeah,” Tony whispers. “I bet.”
It’s not like Steve hasn’t apologized already; the letter proves otherwise. But it’s different to hear it from him in person after they held their son through twelve hours of fever.
Before Afghanistan, he was used to waking up to one scandal more each day.
It hurts. It fucking hurts, knowing Peter’s with Steve and he’s not. But that’s not even the worst of it; oh no. The fear of losing Peter
Tony grumbles and hides his face in Steve’s chest. He’s avoiding the conversation, but that’s okay. Steve will just tell him how stunning he is that much more often now.
Tony looks up. He’s completely disassembled the nano-particle holder, determined to start from scratch and eradicate any possible malfunctions.
“Tony, I lo-”
“Alright.” Peter gives him a lopsided smile and drops back down into the sheets, immediately out like a light.
They go to the hospital on the same day, on Steve’s insistence. (
Rhodes sighs. “Look, just... please just tell me you didn’t force him.”
It’s laying in the cupboard of Tony’s bedside drawer, dangerously close to where he’s tossing and turning in the sheets every other night.
Grinning from ear to ear, he put it down on the table front of Steve.
“If you would excuse me, I need to borrow him for a second. Thank you.”
A sob escapes Steve’s throat.
And Tony melts under his fingers.
Steve interrupts him gently. “It’s okay Pete. You just concentrate on getting Peter.”
He also doesn’t need to, because in that moment, the figure of his worries enters the room with quick and erratic steps that promise no good news.
They fit right together, as if the last two years never happened. Steve responds almost instinctively, his lips part for Tony’s tongue when he licks at Steve’s lips, and it takes a few seconds too long for him to remember himself.
It’s mostly silent. Tony doesn’t want to risk the tentative peace between him and Steve, especially not with Peter right between them. (He also doesn’t want to burst the bubble he’s in himself; enjoy these few hours of being a normal family.)
Or so he thought, up until that day.
Tickets to the Smithsonian, from when Tony took him and then laughed at Steve’s shocked expressions upon seeing that his old drawings were on display there.
“But fighting you...” Steve concentrates on the smooth feeling of Dodger’s fur beneath his fingers. “It was the hardest thing I ever did.”
“Come with me.”
It’s bad enough that he got tipsy and had sex with Steve, Tony thinks as Washington disappears behind them. But the morning after, had to get completely wasted and start crying in front of him, all because he couldn’t handle the thought that Steve regretted him.
Tony squints at him. “Steve? What’s going on?”
But Steve barrelled on. “You said you missed me. You said -”
Tony sighs, exasperated. (Just like he used to.) “I don’t know if you’ve noticed, but we have a giant purple dickhead to kill. The sooner I get that suit to work the better.”
“He was better than all of us,” Tony whispers and buries his head in the fabric of Steve’s shirt.
Four days after the crash, Natasha bodily drags him out of Tony’s room.
Tony smiles wryly. “It’s not fair, is it? I made mistakes too, but I got the easy way out.”
In that moment, Tony’s suit appeared in the sky, dropping Steve’s shield into his hands and assembling itself around Tony in seconds.
Peter eventually stops rambling when one of the teachers stop at the table to congratulate him on his work. Steve steps back a bit to give them space, and Tony follows him.
“That’s right,” Steve murmurs soothingly. “But we brought you all back. You’re in Wakanda now, it’s all going to be okay.”
Steve, Natasha, Bruce and Rhodey all look about as battered as Tony feels. Okoye and Shuri are both dressed in formal Wakandan wear; they appear almost too put together. In the back, the raccoon is sitting on Thor’s shoulder. Nebula is next to them, and her eyes haven’t lost any of that murderous glint.
Steve was still frowning and Tony knew he probably should’ve given Steve a chance to refuse. Who knew if the man even wanted to have anything to do with him, for all Tony knew Steve had just wanted to get away from New York - Yeah, he didn’t really think this whole thing through.
She’s about Peter’s age, Tony realizes, and the next few hours pass in a painful blur of grief.
“You know, if you want me to talk to him …”
It was a big sketchbook. And every single page, every single drawing was of him.
, Steve thinks, almost frantically.
Tony refuses to back down and leave, walking across the room to get his coffee. While the machine hums, preparing his drink, he desperately tried to think of a way to defuse the thick silence that had settled in the room.
It’s a whole twelve hours after the doctor gave him three, that Tony’s fight is over.
“No, it’s okay, he -“
Peter’s blinks confusedly, like he can’t quite make sense of what he’s saying.
“Don’t lie to me!” Peter shouts, almost frantically. Then, his voice lowers (almost breaks). “I know you’re not even talking to each other.”
Tony doesn’t even question that last one.
Tony glances at the clock on the wall; it’s nearly midnight. “Nightmares?”
It gets to the point that the others notice.
“Okay.”
It’s the middle of the night, and they’re on their way to bed, when Tony stops dead in his tracks and folds over.
“I miss you too,” he says quietly.
A small sniffle.
Clint raises his eyebrows. “We haven't even said anything.”
Tony feels like crying.
This time, it’s Steve who can’t look at Tony. Can’t look at him while the doctor explains that there’s little they can do except bring the blood pressure down, can’t look at him while he also explains that this will raise the risk of a heart attack.
In bed, with Steve’s arm wrapped around him and the certainty that all their words were too little too late.
“Dad, he’s...” Peter swallows. “He’s been in the workshop all day. And last evening, he was... I haven’t ever seen him like this, Papa.”
Rhodey goes very still. “Last night?”
And yeah, there’s a storm of emotions fighting for space in his heart, but he’s not about to deny his son this, even if something in him is shivering nervously.
“His condition hasn’t changed,” she says. “But he’s stable for now.”
The suits hits the street with a sickening crunch.
At first, they saw nothing. A moment later, a blue and red spot came flying towards them at terrifying speed. They jumped aside just in time. Spider Man crash-landed on their table, totalling both of their drinks.
, and fails. “I’m sorry. I’m
“Okay,” Steve said. His voice was quivering a little, Tony noticed distantly. “But we should get you home. And to the MedBay.”
One side of him hates himself for not getting up, for wanting to preserve the moment for as long as he can. Whatever he has going on with Steve, it’s not as important as getting Peter back.
Of course he does. These days, he always spends the better part of the day looking at Tony, he’s bound to see changes.
Bruce just shakes his head and hugs him.
, not a Christmas tree. Trees are allowed to be that big you know.”
“I wasn’t going to,” Steve says hurriedly. “I just want him and Peter to be happy.”
But Tony didn't
Tony obliged.
He doesn’t need to walk down the hallway and open the door to her office.
Steve sighs and lowers his head. “Yes. I know I probably got the good side out of all of this. I know I shouldn’t have left you like that. It was just -”
Then Natasha decided they needed a leader for the second group, and it all came down to this.
“Las’ night,” Tony slurs, ignoring the little voice in his head telling him he ought to stay quiet about that.
Tony swallowed and stared down at his hands. He clenched them into tight fists.
(As if they never fought.)
Then, modified weapons based on Stark technology started appearing all over the east coast, and Steve knew he couldn't sit this one out.
They’re standing in the hallway, and Steve’s glad Rhodey isn’t there to listen to them.
It’s almost painful to hold the words back.
They’re sparring without weapons, just attacking and dodging like they’ve done every other day before.
“Exactly!” Tony cried.
decision to make, not yours,” he tells her firmly, even through the tears wetting his cheeks. “So let me out of here and drop it.”
, but what they all don’t understand is that he knows Tony better than Tony knows himself. He doesn't need any of them to tell him what Tony would've wanted. As long as there’s still a chance, Tony would always fight to come back to Steve, he
) he saw Tony doing a quick double-take when they met in the common room. Tony himself was also dressed quite casual, which Steve was glad for. He wanted Tony to feel comfortable after all.
“We need to get your temperature down a bit, okay?”
“You have a workshop here,” Steve responded, and Tony had to give him credit for not even making it sound like a question.
“Everyone attack and push Thanos’ army away from the woods,” he tells into the comms. “We can’t let them get the advantage.”
“Tony?”
“Yeah,” Steve said slowly, contemplating. “Maybe I should.”
Steve stared at him.
“Repressed a lot of stuff, huh?”
“We should get him away from here,” Natasha whispered. “Before he says something even worse.”
“Yeah,” Steve breathes.
Then, “Throwin’ me off the team now ‘s a bad idea. We still need to kill the ugly purple raisin.”
Now, he looked at Tony during team meetings and yearned to warp his arms around him and bury his nose in the crook of his neck, where his scent was strongest. Sometimes he happened to stand too close to Tony and the memory of his scent would follow Steve until he was under his sheets or in the shower.
“Ssh.” Steve laid a hand on his shoulder and shushed him, but that couldn't calm Tony’s racing heart.
Tony had already spotted a small, round stall with pink decorations all over it that made it look old-fashioned. For some reason, it looked charming to him, not silly.
“Did you really…” Tony swallowed. Suddenly, it was hard to breathe. “Spend the whole year…”
It’s been about six days, and Steve knows Tony’s had times when he went off the radar for even longer.
“I don’t like the cold.”
Two months after the crash, Clint and Natasha coax Steve into training with them. (They have Bruce watch Tony for the two hours Steve’s gone, which was Steve’s condition to go with them in the first place.)
Tony just snorts.
Every day they have like this is a present, a treasure that they greatly cherish.
“Where’s Tony?”
Tony didn’t have a sleigh at his cabin, much less any maps of the surrounding area, which had given him hope of getting out of this, but Steve had just flattened out some cardboard boxes and used Google Maps.
Rhodes is right, there’s no denying it.
Tony doesn’t watch him leave. He’s back inside before the buzzing of the engine fades out, already scanning the building for his son.
He starts drinking his coffee and stares at his scattered tools.
“It doesn’t matter,” Tony says, but Steve can tell that it does. Perhaps more so than anything else.
“What happened?” He asks, voice cold.
Steve feels a horrible lump build in his throat. Tony hadn’t been going to therapy that long when Ross had presented them with the Accords. Steve had been so proud of him then, for finally working on his mental health. And then, just a few months later, they’d ripped everything between them apart.
That evening, Peter doesn’t talk about his day. Instead, he asks about how Tony’s feeling and really, he always knew he didn’t deserve Peter, but the universe doesn’t have to rub it in like this, thank you very much.
He knows Tony’s been discharged, but for the past three days, the billionaire was holed up in the lab he’s been provided with. It’s so achingly familiar that it takes every ounce of his self control not to hurry over and steady Tony’s exhausted frame.
Steve shrugged. “There’s so many movies I haven’t seen yet… Might as well start catching up on all of that.”
“Please.”
Clint just shrugged. “I’ll happily take that chance.” Then he took the tinsel from around his neck and started wrapping it around the treadmills. Tony paused in his assault of the boxing bag to stare. Apparently, Clint was very much not kidding with this.
“Tony?”
After she removes the tube that kept him alive for an entire year, it takes almost an hour for Tony to go.
“If you think that’s wise,” his AI replies briskly.
They all work tirelessly to come up with a plan.
“We agreed that for most of us it would be counterproductive to go back to America, but if you and Rhodey wanted to -“
The rest of the team wasn’t exactly impressed they were leaving for Christmas, but as soon as Clint made he first joke about what they’d get up to during that week all alone by themselves, their disappointment soon turned into teasing.
“Come with me,” Tony repeated. “To Utah, I mean.”
, steel himself for this conversation.)
He doesn’t have to search long. Peter’s standing in front of the ceiling-to-floor windows right next to the door, staring at the driveway.
Their first dance, at a gala like this one. Steve clumsy and nervous, Tony with a small smile and flushed cheeks.
“We need you up there,” Bruce says, softly.
The soul stone is glowing innocently on his knuckle, and Steve concentrated on it as best as he can and snaps his fingers.
“I know it took us a while to get along at first -”
, that’s -
, but that’s where he currently was.
So yeah. Dating Tony Stark was a whirlwind of good and bad, but Steve wouldn't ever regret him.
“You have to get out of here and sober up.”
Tony just stares at his expensive carpet and wonders how his best friend can sound so sure.
His therapist says it’s due to his mind being used to war, to being alert all the time. Even though Steve’s never bothered to tell her, he knows she’s got it wrong. He has a lot of issues, but the soldier in him usually solidifies in sudden triggers that make him flinch, or plain and simple nightmares.
Tony takes a step back and shakes his head, like a confused animal. “Why? I know you regret it, you shouldn‘a gone back to a slut like me.”
Now, Tony does sigh.
Pictures from their wedding and honeymoon, from numerous trips all around the world that Tony took them on.
When the monitor flatlines, it feels like the noise is cutting right through Steve’s heart.
“It’s not looking good,” Natasha says matter-of-factly.
Steve swallows against the pressure building up in his throat. Their old life is there right in front of him, and yet still out of reach.
Steve wants nothing more than to give them time to recover and rest, but that’s a luxury he can’t afford right now.
He tries to find words to thank Steve, but fails.
Tony smiled and went to work.
Steve can’t blame him; it wouldn’t be surprising if the kid went into shock, with everything that’s happened to him.
Christ, Tony hadn’t even been sober.
“I’m gonna call him, yeah? And... and no matter what, I’ll make him come here and cuddle you.”
Many months later, Steve felt Tony’s arms around him again.
“Don’t you want to come upstairs?”
“Tony really invited you, huh?”
Tony’s face looks so pale and Steve’s hands won’t stop shaking.
He’s abandoned some of his old ideas here, some of which were just tinkering, some real weapons he’d meant to include in his suit.
It’s slow and subtle, but Steve notices.
, is what he meant to say, but the words get stuck in his throat.
Twelve hours after the crash, Steve is at Tony’s side again.
The small parcel, given to him late at night, when they were on Tony’s floor. Steve’s hopeful yet nervous smile.
“Well, that must feel nice,” Tony snaps, all while hating himself for pushing them both into this
He’s ashamed to admit how it all felt so familiar he’d let himself go.
“Why do you keep saying that?” He can practically hear the frown in Tony’s voice. “I can’t give you the forgiveness you want. I’m not him.”
Tony’s eyes lit up. It made him look even more beautiful.
Steve smiles sadly. “That’s not quite true, actually. They were... murdered.”
He clung to that soldier attitude when Bucky fell, and he’s doing it now.
He looks better, with the blood and the dust off his face and in normal clothes, even though his eyes are red-rimmed.
Steve hesitates, voice unsure. “What’s going on?”
He let his hands wander over Steve’s pectorals to his belly, gliding lower and lower over twitching muscles.
Steve stares at him as if he’s a fairy that just materialized in front of him.
“I miss you.” It escapes his mouth unbidden, and he flinches in response, tries to backpedal as quickly as possible.
All the while, his thoughts circle around Tony and he’s helpless to stop it.
Steve’s voice went quiet, so much Tony almost missed his next words. “I haven’t been out in the snow like that since the ice. I’ve never wanted to, even.”
Peter immediately starts yelling.
“Oh you’ve got to be kidding me!” Tony exclaimed upon realizing that, since the lights weren’t working either, the power had most likely gone out.
an honour. Tony tensed while still keeping his eyes on the dance floor.
They actually don’t have a plan on how exactly to bring back those billions of lives - they only know that the soul stone inside the gauntlet is their best shot, and whoever was closest to it would have the responsibility to try. So, Steve doesn’t know what he’s doing, and even worse, the second the gold metal slides onto his right hand, he knows that the stones are powerful enough to get even the strongest of minds to crumble and bend.
“There’s nothing any of us can do. And you’re no good to him if you don’t take care of yourself.” Steve speaks carefully, knowing that in the state Peter’s in, he would get upset quickly.
Too fast for Steve even, who’s standing right there when Tony comes crashing to the ground, falling from almost a thousand feet up in the air.
But he doesn’t know how to mend the miles-deep gap between them.
Peter’s shoulders sag. “Yeah,” he whispers in obvious relief. “Please.”
“Yeah,” Tony snaps, feeling the anger build in him all over again. “We had one too. Until you
Tony smiled. “Yeah.”
Five months after the crash, Steve goes on his first mission.
When the sun begins to set, Steve’s waiting for him, in a dark suit and bow-tie, his hair neatly combed and he kisses Tony on the cheek.
“I thought we were over this,” Steve says tightly.
Steve smiles in relief. “Don’t worry, we’ll sort that out.”
“He offered to meet me more often,” Peter says hesitantly. “‘Cause he and... and the others, they have a place outside of town.”
Tony blinked, stared at Steve. “Okay. Hold on. What?”
Careful not to dislodge the small sensor clipped to Tony’s finger, Steve takes his hand.
His teammates come and go, but none of them can really reach the horrible place Steve’s mind is stuck in.
“I’m sorry,” Steve said softly.
“I said I’m not doing it! Fuck off!’’
Tony cleared his that and banished the thoughts from his head. All that was over. His relationship with Steve was over. He wasn't in the depression stage of a breakup anymore.
He was supposed to
“No,” Steve says and forces himself not to stare too obnoxiously.
Peter grows quiet at that.
Tony frowns. “You know him?”
“He seems to be... intoxicated,” Thor offered.
Still, he’d fought in a world war, for God’s sake, and had stared into the face of many extraterrestrial threats since then. So, really, he didn’t have an excuse.
“Don’t leave.”
(What’s worse, he’d still feel better if Peter wasn’t talking to Steve.)
Tony had never told anyone, not even Pepper, and by now the memories had a dark feel to it, as though someone had laid a filter on them, made them seem like a horrible, alternate reality instead of something that’d only happened a year ago.
, he should just
Tony playfully shoved his shoulder. “What’s the matter?”
Steve keeps his head firmly facing forward, just like Tony is. Looking at the skyline and the few stars gleaming in the sky is easier than looking at his husband and all the mistakes he’s made.
“Tony,
“Stop worrying about me.” His voice is stern, but it has to be. “I
Yeah. It’s still not much of a good idea to sleep hunched over a workbench.
So he follows after her without protest.
Tony simply shakes his head. “We weren’t in High-School anymore, Steve. This isn’t how it works.”
A few decades ago, he’d scold Steve for making the situation awkward when it didn’t have to be.
Tony takes a deep breath, and tries not to panic.
And he’d dragged him away to
” Tony was suddenly not looking at Hammer anymore, but at a broad, muscular back.
Tony breathes in deeply to push all of his initial reactions out of the way. “Jesus.”
Bruce smiles at him. It’s shallow, exhausted. “Working on your suit?”
“Oh thank God,” Bruce exclaims. “I don’t like him doing this all by himself.
“I hope to god you’re not planning to be a boy scout here and leave me like this.’’
“So what?” Tony meant to snap, but instead it just comes out tired. “I need to repair the suit, Bruce. I barely got him to bleed last time, and I can’t... I
Steve swallows against the lump in his throat. “I thought you could use the company.”
“Good morning,” Steve replies quietly, without looking at him.
“Thank you, Pep,“ he whispered. “I- Thank you.”
, they’d been on the couch laughing at one of Tony’s terrible puns, and now they were here.
“Oh.”
Steve breathed in deeply. “Tony, we need to talk.”
(He almost wants it to be someone else, with the way Peter’s shaking and crying.)
Tony snorts. T
Knowing Tony, the damage is already done. And as it is, he’s on a small metal cot fighting for his life and Steve might never get to say any of it in the first place.
He turned around to check on Tony every few minutes, his cheeks a lovely red and with a stupid, encouraging smile on his face.
Tony leaned to the side, steadying himself with one hand on the counter, and was just able to see Hammer taking a run for it and disappearing in the crowd.
Rhodey finds him like that about half an hour later.
Tony doesn’t know if Steve knows that, or if he’s trying his level best to make their relationship as cheesy and perfect as possible because that’s just the kind of good person he is.
Steve smiled, hearing his name said in Tony's voice was like a bunch of butterflies settled in his stomach, he thought he'd have to settle for 'Captain' or 'Rogers' for a while and mentally prepared for the pain of it, and here was Tony – pleasantly surprising him.
(See the end of the chapter for
He knows Steve understands he should not go to Tony's room again, he knows he understands Tony would not be able to bear the sight of him – and that it's not his fault, or Tony's. he just hopes the man's stubbornness would not compel him to try to change things on his own.
No, that wasn't it. It wasn't just anger he felt when he heard the words Tony thoughtlessly spewed from his venomous mouth. The man played him, brought up Bucky and the brainwash knowing full well how he felt about it.
He dreamed, sometimes. When nightmares of war and loss and ice let him have a brief respite, what Tony would look like when the inevitable finally happened and they both admitted their attraction. He dreamed of angry, violent sex fueled by fights and disagreements over the most stupid things, infuriating Genius billionaire grinning at him as he slammed in, moaning and pulling on his hair when they kissed. Steve found those dreams scary at first, wondering why his fantasies were not focused around more gentle interactions – the way Tony could make him laugh, his enthusiasm as he talked about technology and science and space and the future in words Steve would never truly understand, his idealism hidden under a mask of realism which he allowed nearly no one to witness. But as days went by and the Avengers grew closer as a group, the dreams became an enticing desire for such a reality to even be a possibility.
"Relax…" Steve's voice pled, "If you don't it will hurt, and I know you don't want this to be like our first time."
There had been incidents when someone tried to enter the room despite the warning – most noticeable were any members of the Avengers who attempted it and failed, one by one. The attempts weren't violent in nature, all concerned were acutely aware of their surroundings and understood the potential risk a provoked un-manned Iron Man armor could entail. But it was dirty. They had tried diversion, they had tried negotiation – and even – at one point, one of Clint's EMP arrows to deactivate the suit. It didn't work and almost disabled the entire ward, Clint earned a zap from a stun gun by hospital security before being kicked out and warned about ever returning if he is not actually injured. They later learned that Rhodey and Tony averted disaster and fixed the damage the EMP caused themselves.
Steve smiled at him warmly, knowing he had a friend who believed him was really comforting. "Are you saying or asking, Sam?" he said, placing his own hand on Sam's arm when he sighed in relief and smiled back at him. It seemed that he successfully countered the question.
He did however leave his motorcycle standing with the keys in the ignition and the jacket neatly folded on top of it before going into the store, and talked to the pharmacist while the exhaust roared in the background as it was inevitably swiped away by some very unlucky person. He only hoped they would wear the helmet he left with it, and not get into too much trouble over the theft.
Better than hearing screams and explosions and death all around him, probably. He wasn't quite sure. It was too quiet now, the wheezing sound weakened…
He wasn't even offended when he later found the tracer Sam placed on his jacket, he understood that certain precautions had to be used and that his friend was pressured by the team, by Rhodes, specifically, playing up the blame game and guilting him into committing the betrayal. He didn't hold it against him.
"My brother died repenting for his crimes against Midgard, as you well know. I will not hear his name and memory be tarnished this way." He said with a dangerous tone, "Even he would find the act of plundering a man's body on his deathbed deplorable and beneath his honor."
Steve returned Banner's smile, even if he didn't feel like smiling at all. Everything felt wrong about this – the person he supposedly saved? He
When he gave the press conference, that was apparently the last straw.
Despite what Tony said, Steve knew better. He knew Tony
Thanos smiled at his children, they were ruthless. With them, he would impress his precious soul stone and would be able to conquer the universe. After this, he would present his soul stone to his lady and everything would be perfect. She would give her blessing for them of course.
“By the way Rhodey, you are walking this is so cool man “ smiled Clint unaware of the tension in the room
“Well I need Tony Stark here so I can test my brain against him,” winked Shuri
“And why are we here?” asked Tony again
“Young Master Peter, why are you in the kitchen?” asked a guy next to the oven with a strong french accent
“Don’t forget me for the team Stark” laughed Gamora.
“I know, we will” smiled T’Challa
“Hello Victor long time no see” smiled the man “It’s been so long”
Tony smiled at Okoye and she leave him in his room. The humans were funny, the wizard was very sexy, but the god of Thunder as well and the other blond guy too. Well he is going to have so much fun here. Peter was still cute as ever and the princess too. He walked toward the bathroom. He took his clothes off and stepped inside the shower. Tony was thinking about tonight dinner with the awesome wizard.
“We will listen” said T’Challa smiling sweetly
“Wouah Language Punk” laughed Bucky
“They defend someone who wasn’t here when your friend insults him. They did nothing wrong” simply said T’Challa “ But Thor please next time, use your words rather than your fists”
“Stop playing with them” smirked Thanos more “ My precious soul stone’
“Oh you have a love one, who is he or she?” asked Tony even more curious
So sorry for the delay but my finals were kind of this week so sorry again
“Peter?” asked suddenly someone from the back “I’m very happy that you are well”
Shuri was working on Tony with the doctor. The injuries seemed to be easy to heal, but some of them were so profond, Tony was in very deep coma, and his heartbeat was weak. They were trying their best to stabilize him. After a long time, they managed to stabilize him but he was still under respirator. She passed the emergency toward everyone who was waiting for Tony
“Thank you for the answer Sam” smiled T’Challa before leaving the room.
“Yes, of course, Thanos is a really bad guy so I want to kick his ass” smiled Carol
T’challa nodded quietly before leaving the room. Strange and Gamora followed him toward the meeting room where were all the others heroes minus the Peters. Quill was still unconscious but he was getting better and Parker was talking to his aunt through the phone. Wanda was talking with Vision. Steve was arguing about something with Drax, Rhodey was laughing at them. Okoye was talking with Natasha about fighting style. Mantis was listening to Bruce explaining her a lot of things about the human way.
“Well, he wanted to talk with my children about you my precious stone” smiled Thanos
“No I will not, not until he had apologize for insulting Tony” snarled Thor
“Are you a friend of Mr Stark?” asked Peter curious
Border of Latvria
“We are not all here” replied Gamora standing up “ But what do you need?”
Ok this one is a little more dark. (Thanos is becoming mad)
Peter smiled brightly, he was so happy with Shuri, she was clever and clearly understand him about science and technology. She was a bit like Ned except that she was a princess, clearly more beautiful and intelligent ( Sorry Ned thought Peter laughing). Shuri was happy with Peter too, he was really smart and funny, finally someone of his age, who was interesting. So now, it’s time for him to see the best part of her lab.

“So Peter how was your day?” smiled Stephen
“Which kind of plane?” asked T’Challa walking toward him
“Doom invited me, glad to see that you are unarmed kid” smiled Erik before sitting next to his friend
“Don’t concern yourself, Peter. Doom will protect him against any threat” said Doom standing up and walking toward his personal bar
“You should have wait for her” smiled Peter
“Thank you” said Thor bowing his head “ Have no fear i will bring him quickly”
“Hey your highness,” said Tony suddenly
Carol watched Tony, leaving Earth and she was really worried. Thanos was really mad and he could do anything to hurt Tony. He knew his weakness and he could use it. She headed back inside.
“Saving the universe” answered Rhodey tensing a bit
“So how can you explain the empty cell, you will suffer for this, take him in the torture chamber.” Thanos yelled to the others chitauri.
Thanks for the comments, kudos ^^
“Maybe” smirked Tony
“Ah I see, she is really smart”
T’Challa silently asked her to stand down, which she immediately did. Shuri was running in the corridor with a huge smile on her face, she finally did it. She arrived in front of the room and opened it
Niðavellir was finally in front of them, but everything was so dark, the star was frozen as the rings. Something was seriously wrong here. The ship landed not far from the forge and Thor asked to be very careful here. They walked inside the place with some comments from Rocket. Suddenly they saw the mold for Thanos gauntlet and a dwarf just threw them out of the way.
(See the end of the chapter for
“What a romantic set-up” smirked Tony” This place is truly beautiful”
“Doom said that any child of Tony was welcome in Doom’s Castle” smiled May sweetly
Tony looked at Thanos, curious but well he was too damn hungry for asking questions,so he opened the bag and he ate the cheeseburger. But what Thanos didn’t notice when he leave, was that the orange glint inside Tony eyes was not leaving anymore. The awakening was close
Doom’s Castle, Latvria
Erik was looking at the window, lost in his thoughts. Doom had explained everything about this Hammer. He was beyond furious and was already preparing a way to torture him painfully.
And tell me if you want some Loki points of view now that he escaped
Peter was listening to the conversation between Doom and Magneto. He was very focused on it because he really wanted to know more about the threat around his mentor. He was really tired of all this shit. Tony couldn’t rest and Peter was getting angry.
Doom’s Castle, Latvria
Vision was looking at the window thinking, when Wanda came inside his room. She had a big smile on his face.
“So you’re right, it’s a really bad sign” concluded Bruce, while everyone in the room nodding
T’Challa was thinking now, Vision wasn’t in the palace so for the King it was very easy to guess where was the android. Vision left for Latvria as Peter did. That was a true mess but Vision would not create a diplomatic incident. Latvria seemed to be the best option for Tony and when the genius would wake up, T’Cahlla would ask to be forgiven for leaving him in Siberia and chatting more with him.
“Can i come in?” asked Thor
He flew away from the room before heading toward the dining room.
Well it's been a long time. Covid + blank page syndrome were my downfall I guess. I never gave up on this story but couldn't write a thing. I will try my best for now on to be regular with my updates. Thank for the kudos and comments even if I didn't update.
Carol was watching the sky from her room in Wakanda, she was really getting worried. Before coming here, she asked some information about the mad titan at different peoples who had encounter him and well that wasn’t glorious. And thinking that Tony was alone with this guy even if he was the soul stone, was not good at all. She made a decision and maybe that will no be good for the future but she will save Tony. With her new resolution, she flew toward the stars looking for Thanos’s ship.
“Well his anger was justified, i killed his ma, and he learned it from a video. I will have react the same away” replied Bucky “ And if he was really trying to kill me, he would have.”
“That was intense” said simply Rocket sitting next to him
“Thank you Shuri, I will go then, go back to Wakanda, I don’t want you to be in trouble,” said Peter getting off the aircraft
“ Yes, i’m really happy” smiled Vision but moved a bit away from her
“This is truly amazing” replied Stephen smiling too
“No, I don’t trust any of you” smirked Doom before unleashing his power
“Maybe i can try but i don’t want to hurt you” said Carol shaking his head
“Mister Erik? Why are you here?” asked Peter very confused to see Magneto here
“Thank you daughter, it please me but right now i need to see my gem so we will discuss later” simply said Thanos passing her
“Justin Hammer” answered Doom “ And he has a man inside Wakanda”
Again i'm late, but i'm so busy it's awful. This one is a bit shorter but hope you will like it^^
Steve was walking in his room furious. That wizard was a real bastard. He wanted to hit him so bad. But he couldn’t, he needed to save Tony first and defeat Thanos and then i could hit the wizard.
“Why are you so nice to me?” asked Tony suspicious
T’challa was bored, really bored. Shuri was listening a bunch of things about well a bunch of annoying stuff. He was practically falling asleep right now. He prayed for an event any event for letting him leave.
Steve was walking all around the one if the numerous room like a lion in a cage. There wasn’t any news about Tony and two guards were guarding the door now. He was highly furious and he couldn’t do anything about it.  Natasha was looking at him from the couch, wondering why she had followed such a person, Steve was instable, his love for Tony was very toxic. How could you beat someone you love down?. That was just insane. Clint was sitting next to Natasha. He was pissed off, he couldn’t say anything about Tony anymore and that was just purely stupid like this guy destroyed the avengers and was a coward. However, everyone loved him because he sacrificed himself for some people and now he was in a coma. Wanda was looking through the window, she was really missing Vision and she began to understand why did he ask for a break. She wasn’t the nicest person with him and hated Tony who was pretty much his father. She was also beginning to understand that Tony wasn’t responsible for her parent’s death and she was having a lot of regrets right now.
Thanks for the kudos and the comment ^^
“Tony is that important for you?” asked Peter looking at the tank
“I’m following you about what happened here,” said a man in a wheelchair” Someone care to explain?”
“So you have questions then?” smiled Rhodey encouraging the witch
“I really hope that he will wake up soon,” said Peter to Stephen watching Tony
“It’s perfect Eitri” smiled Thor slapping Rocket playfully.
“We need medic now” screamed Captain Marvel
“You are very strong as well” smiled Okoye giving her a hand
“Yes Thanks you Edward” said Rhodey standing up “ Right on time”
“He’s going to wake up right?” asked Stephen frowning
“I’m not in my full potential and if i made a bigger protection than in the room. I may fall in a magic coma and all of my spells will be down. Meaning my disguise will shutdown as well as others things” concluded Tony “ And that will not be good.”
Thanks again for the kudos and for the comments ^^
“The king is still furious as you can see and well, it’s not going to end well for them” whispered Strange back
“Doom always loved Tony’s brain and I'm pretty sure that he is in love with him” laughed Charles. “ I have to go my love, Logan is restless and i need to calm him down”
“Tony asked me to protect his kid, and well Peter is really great” smiled Strange sweetly
“No, he reminded me of someone and that was really strange” answered Peter looking through the window.
“Mr.Barton, I will ask you to refrain yourself from talking badly about Tony Stark” finally said T’Challa “Or I will drag you out of Wakanda myself. Same for you Miss Maximoff, refrain yourself for using your power”
“Doom happens” groaned Rhodey furious
Sorry for all the people who wanted a threesome hehe
“Who was on board?” asked T’Challa again
“No i refuse and like i said i can’t do it” screamed Tony this time
“I’m here for Tony, release him please, I don’t want to lose him again,” said Peter standing in front of the tank
Morgana La fay it's her http://www.listal.com/viewimage/2138239h
Carol raised an eyebrow at Rhodey but she smiled sweetly at the end. Her boyfriend was really soft. Mostly because, everyone loved Rocket and Groot, they were so nice and funny. Even if Rocket was a little shit most of the time but that was the part of his charm. He was going to get along with Tony so well and that what was scaring her. Two mad genius on the loose. Rocket was coming closer to Tony and stood on a chair.
“Stop saying shit about Tony Stark” said Peter looking angrily at Wanda
“Justin Hammer” answered Doom pouring himself a drink “ He was released a few months ago.”
Again the delay so sorry but once that my finals are over i will update more. So sorry again.
“So when are you going to wake up, I want a genius pal. Shuri is awesome but she is too young for my jokes. And Groot and I want to thank you” said Rocket patting Tony’s leg gently
“Tony,” said a voice quietly “ Tony where are you?”
“Well he is too arrogant” answered Steve “ And he think that he know everything”
“A spider in Doom’s Castle how interesting,” said a voice behind him “ Your stealth is remarkable for not being detected by Doom’s sensor.”
“Are you hungry little one?” asked Thanos gently
“Master Doom asked us to call you Young Master and I’m just following his wishes. I’m the chef here, I cook all the meals. My name is Louis” smiled the chef bowing slightly
“If you are really going to help us” smiled T’Challa standing up “ Allow me to offer you a room for your time here”
“I want to ge to know him, and create amazing stuff with him” laughed Rocket
“Hey, i bring you some asgardians food” smiled Tony “ I kind of used my powers for it”
“This is unexpected,” said Charles raising an eyebrow “Not the “Tony is safe” part but your nephew being a guest of honour”
Doom’s Castle, Latveria
“Erik, please calm down my love,” said a voice in his mind
“This scum insult Tony” said Rhodey pointing Clint “ And i’m really tired of that kind of shit”
“This is unfair” replied Steve furious” Tony is our friend, he need us as well”
“Hey Punk, still in your thought” said Bucky from the door
“It’s fine you didn’t know” smiled Tony
“He insulted Anthony” growled Thor “ And I can’t stand this”
“This is stormbreaker, in theory it can summon the bifrost and kill a god” said Eitri smiling
Sorry late again
“Thanos has the reality stone” said Gamora getting the attention of everyone
“Yeah” smiled Rocket “ Your friend seemed a really nice person”
(See the end of the chapter for
They all turned toward the voice and they know that would end well if he opened his mouth about Tony or anything related to the civil war.
“Quill, i’m so glad to see you walking” smiled Drax hugging Peter strongly
“He decided to save us. Thanos gave him the choice and he sacrificed himself” explained Stephen.
“Yeah, Doom seemed to like Tony so no worries” smiled Peter “Any children of Tony is welcome here so I guess you are one of us now.”
Carol was still flying around the galaxy, looking for Thanos’s ship. She had picked the heat signature of the mad Titan and she was more than ready to save his best friend. She stopped when she finally saw it, the ship of the dark order. She dived under it hiding from Thanos and his minions.
“No you are the soul stone, you can take any forms if you want.” smiled Thanos madly
“Sire are we going to finally destroy those avengers,” asked Proxima smiling
“Strange, you don’t even know him” said Steve totally shocked by Strange’s boldness
Unaware of what happened, the conversation in the room, was still on. T’Challa was trying to remind perfectly calm but his sister wasn’t making it easy. May was on the sofa with Pepper, they were chatting quietly between each other, mostly a fair punishment for the recklessness of Peter. Erik was chatting with Logan and Charles, trying to find a solution for the current situation.
“Pepper” said Rhodey standing up “ Please don’t scream Tony need a quiet environment”
Everyone fell on the floor when Doom disappeared. They were shocked by the display of strength and how easy was for the villain to take Tony away. They stood up and checked the damage made.
“Dead, Tony killed him” answered Rhodey with a smirk “ You will learn that Tony’s enemies tend to die”
“Are you fucking mad?” asked Tony raising a shield around him
“ About that, i would like to take a break from our relationship, my main focus right now is rescuing Tony and that it. I need to think about other things as well” said Vision leaving the room “ I’m sorry Wanda”
“I’m the team leader,’’ Steve mumbled. “And he’s, well -’’
And Tony looked at him with such desperate hope in his eyes Steve wanted to cry.
“He needs both of us,” Tony says quietly, tugging Peter towards him to make room for Steve. “You know that.”
She squints at him. “He’s got Rhodey. What makes you think you being there would change anything?”
“Now I get why you watch those telenovelas,” Clint said to Nat and was, predictably, hit by a pillow.
And, yeah, it’s not like they can’t ignore all the elephants in the room, but Steve feels bone-deep tired when remembered of the task before them. And all he wants, even if for a little while, is rest. For himself as well as his team.
He can still feel the dampness of his skin, Steve’s touch on his thighs, the cold lube inside of him.
Tony doesn't respond.
Tony shook his head. “Nothing to be sorry about. And I’d say being stuck in a cabin with a national icon is a pretty good outcome.”
it provides. In the training hall, he doesn't have to think about the big, black hole of grief that’s threatening to swallow him whole.
Tony took him out to a lovely Italian restaurant where they were seated in a private room in the back. Steve hadn't known Tony had Italian roots, but over the course of their meal, Tony told him about his mother. How she’d taught him to cook and play piano, and how they used to fly out to Italy once a year.
Which doesn’t mean he’s happy about it.
Steve wants to cry. Whatever he said, it would all be too late. The damage is tone, and it’s been years since Thanos.
was making Steve burn inside in the best and worst ways – the desire to dominate him until he rolled over and showed his vulnerability until he let go of the insecurity and control issues and just conceded to receive the help Steve was giving...
"he came in here unauthorized and attacked me, I merely defended myself." He said under his breath, "And made sure he would never do this to anyone else." He turned to look at Ross, watched as the goons picked up the body, Still the one of the super soldier, but not for much longer.
Tony’s breathe hitched, his chest constricted. He curled around himself, nails digging into the flesh of his forearms, trying to bring them even closer together. He longed for the whales to return, if only to drive away the sense of loneliness that settled in his chest once they left. The moisture of tears breached his closed eyelids and his body curled tighter, shivering from the cold.
He was answered by silence and closed his eyes as the tears started to fall, biting his lips as the salt in them seared in the cuts remaining from Rogers' fist. He didn't open them even when he felt one delicate hand on his shoulder, thinking it to be one of the nurses who noticed him standing alone in the ruined, restricted room.
The problem was that instead of letting Steve guide him with the same lax quality his body possessed before, Tony chose to grab the shaving knife, and somehow – despite his nylon covered, casted hands – succeeded in the endeavor.
Tony promised himself that there would be no need for that.
She found Steve standing outside Tony's room, at first glance he looked tired – but okay, but as she got closer she caught glimpses of mussed hair, a split lip and a little bruise on the cheek turned away from her, she went to his side, leaned on the wall and handed him one of the cups. If he wanted to talk – he'd talk. In the meantime she looked around, finding several spots where the struggle was evident, and the worry started to gnaw at her after all.
And with Barnes… the lackluster brand of brainwashing Steve dabbled in could possibly work, too.
They filled him in, every person in the room adding his or her own tidbit about the occurrences after the Iron Man armor got debilitated with Tony inside it and flung aside. The breach he created in the defenses of the enemy's invasion army – Bruce noticed a slight twitch in Tony's eye when the word
A sense of impending doom was the exact description of what he was feeling on the way to the tower. And said doom arrived promptly as he watched the video and the still pictures, again and again. Some of the time with commentary from other members of the Avengers, later - alone in his room. A feeling of a noose tightening around his neck every time.
… Some suggested the two Avengers had a romantic affair behind the backs of their teammates and had eloped, another suggested that it was actually Iron Man who caused the disappearance of Captain America and blamed a Russian conspiracy, and more ideas of the sort kept polluting the air all around them for as long as TVs were around.
Rhodes nodded mutely. "of course, if I'm needed beforehand-"
." His hand moved, stroking Tony's limp cock with newfound vigor. "You moaned and smiled and you whispered my name, and it took time – I won't say it didn't, but you got hard! And… God, Tony, I know it hurt, I know… It wasn't the best time or place…" he paused to listen to Tony's choked moans as his strokes managed to do what they, scientifically speaking, could not have managed during the first time because that was not how bodies worked – a fact that Steve was not willing to accept. "But you can't say that you didn't enjoy it, you can't say it didn't help."
"And yet you begged for me to do this? Do you think I am stupid, Tony?" Steve rolled him so he laid on his back, his other hand – the one that gave him the hand-job just moments before, covered in his spill, held to his chin to keep him from looking away. "Who was it? Who were you thinking about?"
"Well, I don't like being kidnapped and brutalized repeatedly, so I think we might not be the best match." He said, more like rasped quietly, with not nearly as much bite in his tone as he was capable of, and yet somehow his words managed to get a deep hiss from the bottom of Steve's throat as his hand reached and seized Tony's collar, pushing him further against the wall.
He filled a plastic cup with a straw lid and a cute "Captain America & Iron Man" cartoony graphic with water, chuckling at the thought of what Tony's reaction to it would have been had their relationship been as it should be, instead of fractured like this. He would have loved it – called it childish but drink out of it all the time – like those coffee mugs with the bad jokes etched on them he always used.
Tony wished he'd known those things too. He wished he believed them.
Eventually, Tony would have to acknowledge his efforts.
Not many people were able to take on the Iron man suits, even unmanned. Whoever that person was, he was a lot more dangerous that he anticipated. Strong – yes, but also very determined in his quest to take Tony away, no matter the stakes. "I take it we have nothing on this psycho, Jarvis?"
"Finally, I have some… worrying news." Bruce whispered. "Usually I would wait for Tony's consent to reveal those findings, but right now this could be the most vital damage to his person, and he will need our support to move past it." The man breathed in, then out. Steve must have imagined the slight green tint of his eyes and skin. "It seems that Tony was… assaulted, when he became indisposed. Sexually, violently." He breathed out again. "I am not going to repeat the details of that to you, was bad enough reading about it in the report myself without his consent for it, I feel very uncomfortable revealing it to you, but I also know he is going to need support, and Tony… he won't ask on his own."
When he touched his shoulder – barely touched, hovered a hand over more like, his suspicion on the matter was confirmed. Tony's head shot back and turned to look at him immediately, his eyes wild with terror Bruce didn't think he'd ever see in his friend's eyes. The terror calmed down after just a moment, maybe after recognizing his friend, but to Bruce's own horror – it still remained there, ready to leap back out at the first sign of danger.
Natasha was released from observation that same afternoon, Bruce went to get a couple hours of well-deserved sleep and put a different doctor in charge.
There was none of that attitude present in his slumped form as they walked slowly through the street towards the hospital, Rhodes carrying a kit-bag filled with Tony's own clothes, snacks, and gadgets while Sam was… not very sure why he offered to join the trip to the hospital.
Before, he was willing to let Tony die if that was what he had to do to keep his image untarnished in his mind, but after seeing him with the knife to his throat Steve didn't want that to happen anymore, the pain of losing him all over again would drive him crazy.
No wonder Stark chose to be moved there - he couldn't just settle for a regular room like everyone else – had to have the best, fanciest commodities while everyone else was given less than adequate treatment. Sometimes he couldn't really tell if the man's behavior was endearing or plain spoiled and thus annoying as hell, this time it was very much the second option – getting to be treated in the hospital after a large disaster was a privilege, and Tony was milking his to the last drop.
Tony got up and moved away from the TV, instead he picked up a StarkPad and looked at the silent calculations Jarvis was making as they happened. He understood some of them, but as always, the rest caused him to develop a migraine as his mind tried to access old information that long since been corrupted or overwritten with new information –
(Rhodey/Tony MIT days)
He only had a few moments to take care of the cheap alarm system by smashing its control panel to bits just before it went off, He left the place in a mess to cover what he had taken, and took several more items than what he actually needed. He found himself looking over one shelf in particular, a feeling of uncertainty eating at his gut. Of course, he wanted to do it – show his love to Tony again, this time properly. He imagined their next time over and over again since Tony was confirmed to be alive and safe after his surgeries – it would be the same as he imagined the first time around. Tony's pale skin warm under his hands, his body pliable and soft and open for him, this time they will go slowly, use proper lubrication and, despite not actually needing it – protection, For Tony's peace of mind. This time will be different.
