When he caught sight of the arc reactor, he couldn’t help but halt his clothes-removing-actions and kiss tenderly around it, just like the first time they’d made love. This artifact was the reason Tony’s heart was still beating and he couldn’t be more grateful for its existence.
The sudden realization that he and Tony had never talked about those months hurt Steve even more. He didn’t know if Tony had forgiven Steve for belittling him for not being like his father. Steve knew now that Tony was so much more.
The morning in the cottage was like all the others when they had the luxury to rise next to each other.
“Well… Since I seem to be incapable of thinking of nothing but ‘the gutter’…” Steve lifted Tony bridal-style, who totally shrieked in surprise. Steve didn’t give him time to complain when he threw him almost immediately towards the bed, making him land perfectly on the middle before he could protest the ‘princess treatment’, as he called it. Super aim did come useful in a lot of different ways. “Why don’t we give it a try?” he asked while crawling over to Tony, positioning himself between expecting legs.
Why? Well, she simply thought that Steve was nuts for thinking that Colonel Rhodes, as Tony’s best pal, wouldn’t stick his nose into their love life.
“But I started it,” Steve accepted in a whisper. “I made you feel miserable for a while and you didn’t deserve it.”
“Damn straight,” He wouldn’t deny that even if he were able to, anyway. “Even inside the tower,” Steve finally retook those inviting lips with his own and dominated them when Tony pulled close again, rubbing himself against Steve in the process. He kissed Tony hard, passionately, possessively and he couldn’t be more pleased when he received an equally fervent response.
“Peter-” Tony tried to pacify the teenager as Clint obediently moved out of the way with a shrug, but Steve beat him to it.
Anthony knew that his gorgeous alpha was aware of what he was attempting, but the reproachful glare turned into an ‘I’m not fooled by your tactics’ scowl, so he counted it as a victory.
“Steve…” he tried to yell in surprise at what the presence of the shield represented without daring to take his eyes away from it. However, Anthony knew that it probably sounded more like a relieved sob that his alpha had arrived at last and was there for him. The brunette's pride could take a downfall for all that he cared at the moment; he would have time to regret his damsel in distress attitude when he was alive and safe between his saviour's arms.
Then the miracle happened. Even if Steve was prepared to make amends for the rest of his days to earn forgiveness from Tony -the Tony that
“I do,” Steve knew it was now or never. “I love you so much; more than anything I have ever loved in my life, and it kills me that I had to resort to this so I could get an honest answer from you.”
“Neither do I, you know that.” Anthony tried looking at the blue eyes above him, but he found that he was completely immobile by brute force alone. When nothing changed in a few seconds, Anthony tried to lighten the mood, “Never knew you were this jealous, Steve. I'm truly shocked.”
“He’s a duke, his name is Victor von Doom, and I have a bad feeling about him.” Anthony said with the bitterness back in his voice. “I really don’t like him.”
“Well, yes. That’s what mature relationships are about, but you do realize that if you left it to Tony to fix your arguments, you’d have already broken up, right?”
The annoyed groan that James made was enough to make Steve laugh. “Nothing, man! I’ve tried everything to court her proper and she just refuses to look my way!”
“For one, the immeasurable desire to punch your teeth out for the hellish potion that you forced on me and that won’t let me fucking stay quiet. For the rest, I can’t be selfish all the time, Steve; I will not be the one responsible for breaking up the best thing that has happened to us,” Tony confessed with determination.
“Steve?” the familiar voice calling him from the doorframe of their room made him relax at least a little. “Are you okay?”
“Desperation,” Steve completed for her, not wanting her to finish her sentence to try and dissolve his resolve about this, inner voices be damned. He was pretty sure of what Tony was going to say. No, he was
“Yeah, it really is important to Tony,” Steve added, thoughtful. “He was really nervous when he told me he thought it was time for him to tell Rhodes about us.”
This time, Steve couldn't found the energy in him to do anything but let Tony leave. He then allowed himself to collapse on a chair by the table with an enormous sigh. When he stopped hearing Tony’s hurried footsteps, he put one hand over his eyes while the other pulled not-too-gently at his hair.
“Hey, guys, coffee’s ready…” Just when Steve wanted to make Rhodes understand, possibly by shaking him a little or perhaps a punch here and there, Tony came in with three cups of coffee. Apparently, the atmosphere was so suffocating that even Tony caught on that something was off. “Everything alright over here?”
“And he really loves me in return.” Steven decided to answer knowing full well that James was a little more than sceptic over Anthony’s feelings, considering that he only saw them together when they had to pretend to be nothing more than a servant and his prince. “Last night he almost got eaten by a pack of hungry wolves in order to see me.”
“Fine!” Rhodes almost yelled while slamming his cup of coffee rather forcefully on the table. Steve was too worried about the sound and the thinking of how was he going to get out of this without turning his lover’s best friend into a bloody pulp, that he was slow to process the simple word coming from the now resigned Colonel. “Fine, Rogers, fine!” he repeated as if to confirm it for Steve’s slow brain.
He went to the door and yanked it open, although just enough so that his body stood between the man on the other side and his living room.
“Bucky, snap out of it!” Steve ordered before anything could escalate as he slapped his friend in a swift movement.
“Rhodey, I’m not exactly fucking perfect; I can’t expect Steve to be perfect either.” Tony replied as if that explained everything, but there was something there, in his voice, when he said it. Rhodey couldn't figure out what it was.
“He’s in another dimension,” Wanda replied somberly to the yet unasked question. “He’s been there for weeks now. I don’t know when he’ll return.”
He’d tried everything that his friends had subtly and not-so-subtly suggested, everything the movies had shown him and even what the internet advised him to do. He couldn't do it anymore. He needed extraordinary options that equalled to Tony's extraordinary personality and stubbornness. Every plan had to fit the scene, otherwise, it was bound to fail. That was when he decided that he needed a plan that was so far from normal that he had to consult some expert in the abnormal to achieve an unexpected, out of this world, solution.
The genius didn’t try to spare a glance towards the commotion, he blindly head-butted the brute on his back, which at least earned him a grunt and the missing feeling of the gun jabbing against his back as the soldier fell with probably a broken nose. Thank god that the gun had had the safety on. Then, Tony tried to force himself out of the grip of the other two, but they seemed less put out at being unable to see and yanked him backwards and away from the flying sparks of the guns firing at where Tony had last seen his son.
“Hey, don’t be like that,” Tony tried to say it casually, but Rhodes swore he heard a tremor in his voice.
It only served Steven to get angrier, especially when von Doom’s arm wouldn’t leave Anthony’s lower back even when the prince kept subtly squirming.
Wanda’s warnings had held some true, after all. The tightness of Steve's chest only intensified as he waited for Tony to be taken by the enchantment he was most feverishly fighting to honestly answer the question. He knew that he was betraying Tony’s trust and he was determined to make it up to him, no matter what. No matter the answer. He swore that this was the last time he allowed his selfishness to hurt Tony.
After what felt like a moment that Steve didn’t want to end, Tony broke the kiss too soon in order to look him in the eyes.
It was turning out to be a beautiful, tranquil day in his luxurious bachelor’s flat when his doorbell rang.
Steve tried to keep the disappointment away from his expression when Wanda Maximoff announced the bad news.
“We shall celebrate!” Thor continued as if nothing had happened behind him, “We had two glorious victories today! The one where Steven and Anthony finally won each other’s heart and my mighty victory that granted me a lot of dollars to take my lovely Jane out on a mortal’s date!”
“As much as I am aware of your tendency of listening to unhealthy decibels of music to keep yourself awake, sir, I shall-”
here." Steve accused with crossed arms. But even if he ducked his head a little, Rhodey could hear the whispered "Thank god” that left his lips.
“I love you,” Tony finally choked between dry sobs, but a second later a couple of tears escaped his eyes and rolled down his cheeks at his confession. The world recovered its colours in Steve's eyes; the air returned to his lungs and the unbearable weight that he had been carrying all along for months disappeared like a revitalizing punch. Steve felt reborn. He clung to each of Tony’s words, wanting to remember each letter, each sound until the end of his days.
Then, Bates looked at the anxious-looking Peter, “The young lad didn’t want to share his daddy, but I’m sure you wouldn’t have a problem with that, right, Captain? I hear you already have a lover. Your loss is my gain and all that.”
The morning routine came back to its normal path and Rhodes effortlessly resumed it; he finished his coffee-tainted breakfast and proceeded to go watch TV, being particularly careful to avoid the news because even he had to admit that Rogers didn’t deserve the fake gossip. They were probably even insisting that Tony cheated first or something stupid like that.
already talked with Tony about, and he really didn’t appreciate Rhodes referring to it as if it was something that Tony couldn’t change. That he HAD changed a long time ago.  It was as if the Colonel was trying to say something that Steve didn’t appreciate. “What are you trying to s–”
“I just needed to clear my mind,” Tony answered with newfound confidence, “I thought it would be good to run things by you for once, since you’re the last one to get the heads up on things.”
“What?” Steve asked naively, not understanding what the big fuss was over. “I thought that we could fix things. Maybe start again?”
Anthony thought better the situation when a low growl vibrated under him. He hasn’t ever felt this much jealousy from Steven before, not with this much… passion, if the arm squeezing him to the strong chest below him was any indication.
“Tony, that’s not true,” Steve denied honestly, managing to sit up slowly with the intention of not spooking Tony and repeat their chase around the workshop. He took a breath to fill himself with enough patience to avoid at all cost another fight with the brunette, even when apparently Tony was trying to induce one, “What are you talking about?”
Waiting for that moment, Steve was ready to dive for Tony instead just before he could get to the exit and managed to trap him firmly in the by now familiar cage of his arms. He spun the genius around in one swift movement and then he threw him over his shoulder as if he weighed nothing.
“And I don’t doubt that, Colonel, not at all,” he conceded. “I don’t know anyone more capable and willing –besides myself and probably Jarvis, of course–, to look out for him.”
Steve was now seeing red. He knew what exactly the Colonel was bluntly hinting about; he could almost see Tony in front of him calling him a laboratory experiment just after he told him in lot of words how he was such a
, and judging by the increasing frown on Tony's face, he thought was not amused, so Steve tried to direct the conversation away a little, "but I am bossy!”, he denied... or tried Steve to, only to realize that those were definitely
“Besides, this isn’t about me and my daddy issues.” Tony clarified with a smug look, probably at Steve’s lusty face. His lover’s arms clinging around his shoulders left Steve wondering when they got there. “We get enough of that.”
The darkness of the forest was absolute. There was nothing but a world of scarcely recognizable shadows following a weak, dying flame emerging from the torch that Anthony Edward Stark was carrying ahead of him during his haste.
“How could I not when I have this gorgeous alpha under me?” and before Anthony could say anything more, Steven flipped them so Anthony was back being pressed against the mattress. “Or over me… My kind of man. Efficient.”
“Indeed, it seems the vote also included to start 'movie night' early today because Miss Van Dyne has a prior engagement this evening,” JARVIS explained with what could be interpreted as amusement. “About the rest of the team's whereabouts, apparently they got suspicious about your lack of participation in this morning's debate and decided to come down to the workshop looking for you. They appear to find your 'theatrics' amusing, even though they are not capable of listening in on your conversation, and Agent Romanov is currently attempting to enter using Captain Rogers’ codes.”
It didn’t take a genius to know who it was, but it took a lot of Rhodes’ will and control not to simply grab one of perfectly hidden guns in the apartment and start shooting through the door. He was pretty sure he had a sniper rifle under his bed.
At Tony’s obvious reluctance, Steve thought the worse, but really, he couldn’t feel hurt about it since he complained about Tony a lot in those days, too. “Please, I’m going to have to meet him eventually and I want to be prepared.” He added.
Steve knew he was trying to subtly kick him out, so he resorted to the always useful reverse-psychology, at least when Tony was involved.
“If that’s what it takes, then yes.” He accepted with determination, the words more for his sake than for the witch's.
“Yes,” came the immediate response while Tony was making himself comfortable on his lap. “You do; you own everything I am and it’s so goddamn unfair.”
In contrast with his former captors, Thug-number-one proved to be a thinker when he stuck Tony’s back to his chest in an effective judo keylock and he didn’t lose any second to put a gun on his temple with clear intent as he took the safety off and quickly covered his back to the wall. It was insane the amount of precaution they got over an injured human with his hands still tied behind his back, he should be flattered, really. All the punching and yanking around had made him dizzy and this hostage thing was becoming tiresome
A massacre had also taken place outside but wasn’t yet completely finished, which seem to distract his captor but for a second. No longer afraid to die in front of his son, Tony immediately took his chance and head-butted Bates with all he got left. Tony got enough leverage to barely avoid the first shot at where his head had been a millisecond ago. Finally, adrenaline was taking over his body and his body was battle-ready in a second. Except, in that same second he seemed to forget that his hands were still tied behind his back, so his victory was inevitably short-lived. He seemed to have missed Bates’ nose and the goon had recovered quickly enough to kick the genius right on the butt before he could turn to face the soldier and he lost his balance. Tony fell face-first onto the concrete that used to be the parking lot of the warehouse and now resembled more a gory cemetery. He managed to turn his body’s weight onto his right shoulder to try and run for it, but it was already too late.
He thought he couldn’t be more livid when Lord Obadiah proved him wrong as his hands shined a shade of blood red and blasted some directly at Anthony.
“That won’t be a problem,” Steve assured with haste. He was grateful for the trust she was giving him; he knew she didn’t give it to anyone easily these days. “I just need one chance.”
“And you like that?” he asked with honest curiosity. Steve didn’t really know if Tony was enthusiastic about his so-called righteousness. Even if he didn't feel all that righteous right now.
to you. If Tony ever found out that Steve sometimes thought that way, he would laugh at him before making bad jokes about the honorable Captain America wanting to kick ass rather than
Noted, when he thought that he had it easy with Tony’s lack of parents to impress and apparently normal friends with normal jobs, he wasn’t really thinking of how
“Nothing. He hasn’t done anything out of normal lately, really.” Steve defended his lover a little. It was true that Tony was a troublemaker, but he’s always been able to find his own way out of every problem he caused, even when sometimes his solution was to self-destruct and it would cause more harm than good. Now that he thought about it, perhaps Pepper was a big reason why both Tony and his company were still alive and functioning.
“What?” Tony now looked confused. “Is that what’s been bothering you? Why? That was like years ago.”
Not knowing what else to do and finally finding himself alone, Steve hurried to dress as he had never rushed before to go to Tony's rescue. It was a matter of time before the Avengers realized that they were both hexed and started to have fun at their expense. But first, he had to collect all of his and Tony's clothes.
. There was simply no other option, all their ‘one night stands’, all their misunderstandings, their martyr behaviour, their talks, their shared moments, the way they overcame every obstacle together... it was enough proof of the feelings that swam between them. It wasn’t just sex for them, they both had their fair share of casual sex to mistake what they did with anything other than love-making. “I came here because Tony is stubborn and self-destructive and it doesn’t seem that he will ever be honest about it. I want to know why.”
In conclusion, even Captain America, hero of war, national icon, Boy Scout Magnificent (as Tony would call him), and proud leader of the greatest superhero team in all history could admit:
Steve knew it should feel weird to hear this kind of stuff from someone other than Tony himself, but he couldn’t help the pleasant curling of his stomach at thinking that his genius has loved Steve for as long as he’d loved him.
“A~nd that’s my cue to leave as if hell-hounds were after my butt,” Peter said, acting exaggeratingly as if all of this situation was giving him goosebumps, and hurried up after the others, “At least up there I'm not at risk of having to bleach my brain for involuntary voyeurism!”
Before Tony and the girls could get completely out of the workshop, Tony's eyes searched for his. Today they came a long way. Especially if the open, love-sick expression that was now being directed willingly at him was any indication.
“Tony, for a genius you’re a total idiot, you know that?” Steve made sure that he was making eye contact with Tony to make this point. It was easier now that they were almost at the same eye level to see the change of expression from aroused to insulted.
“No, we don't have to talk about anything,” Tony denied easily with a more forceful, useless push, “And
“Don’t even try to look innocent and cute, Steve,” James demanded with slyness while he approached the blonde. James was one of the handful of people that knew about Steven and Anthony and that was because he caught them early in their relationship in the middle of making out in the proximity of the forest. Not that Steven could’ve hidden it from him for long, anyway. He was the reason why they decided to build the cottage in the profound of the woods, though.
In a blink, Steve’s disc had hit one of the thug’s head and the other one was being chocked by Black Widow’s tights. However, it was too late, the bullets were already flying and no dexterity could avoid so many bullets at such a close distance.
“Hey! I resent that!” Tony complained while playfully trying to push him away. Steve only held on tighter regaining his smile. “I’m a perfectly pliable person when I want to be.”
“Steven Rogers, I am disapointed in you! I can’t believe you’re Tony Stark’s lover and you can’t think about the big, HUGE, cavalry!” she stated with somewhere between excitement and bemusement.
“But we can’t leave him with that psycho!” Peter shouted out, turning his attention to said smirking psycho who was already safely at the door, “He’s going to get
“It seems that the Avengers were gathered around the living room inquiring about yours and Captain Rogers’ whereabouts before they decided to take advantage of your absence this morning and selected the movies that will be displayed this evening, forgoing both your votes.”
Steve couldn't stand still anymore and before he knew it, he was on his feet with his hands tightly curled in fists, walking in small circles and ready to punch something into another dimension where not even Reed would find it.
It took stealing a quick glance at the barely visible shack and then back at the sight of the dead wolf to reassure his mind and body that it was real; that he wasn’t imagining the shield and that Steven was really there. Just then he snapped out of his scared, conflicted trance and regained the strength of his resolution and, by extension, of his legs.
Every morning was a routine for him; he would wake up with the sun, turn on the coffee machine and go take a warm, quick shower. He would then put either his perfectly ironed uniform on if he had to go to headquarters, or simple clothing on a rare-free day; just like that morning. He’d go to the kitchen again for his freshly brewed coffee and he would make himself something healthy for breakfast and eat it while reading the newspaper.
“I want to ask him about his true feelings for me,” Steve answered truthfully, “I don’t want to keep asking his eyes or his body; I want to hear it from him so we can stop tormenting each other over this and actually start enjoying it as it’s supposed to be. Life as superheroes is short enough as it is and I'm done with us being on different pages because he wants to be a martyr. I won't give up on him.”
that some of that was right; he had looked at Tony expecting him to fill a void within Steve than no one else could for being the only remote connection to his past. The impossible expectations and the disappointment he felt when he believed that Tony only fought for himself. “Oh my God, Tony, I’m so sorry.”
“If you’re talking about sex, and you always are, then I would totally discard the quiet thing. It’s simply not possible for you.” Steve replied pulling Tony closer to hug him completely, tucking his lover's face under Steve's strong jaw. His lover’s hands adjusted to the new position and were transferred to Steve’s back, resuming their soothing spell in the form of lazy circles. “I really love the way you are noisy in bed. You know that, right?”
“Only three should be adequate.” Lord von Doom replied instead while stepping away from the stall and dragging Anthony with him so the stable boys could do their work faster. He was obviously sending the message that he didn’t like to wait. “And do be quick, this place smells horrible and I want to leave as soon as possible.”
“I appreciate the consideration, but as honoured as I am by such a proposal, I must humbly decline, as I rather enjoy riding by myself.” Anthony declined gently and with all the diplomacy that he carried in his blood. Steven was always bemused to witness it.
!” Clint cursed loudly, slamming his hand down the nearest workstation and making Dummy start running in circles around him in alarm, “You can't even hook up when you're supposed to, Stark! You weren’t supposed to be together until next month!”
“One more step and I will kill him, you freak!” Scarred-face sneered at his son without stopping his pace.
“I cannot care less if you are an alpha or whatsoever-!” Anthony interrupted a little too high pitched to be casual to Steven’s ears, he even kicked off some of the hay on the floor in a very un-princely way. The blonde knew he was trying to keep the attention on himself, but it was too late; the two lords were now eyeing with disgust at Steven being restrained by Bucky.
Anthony’s fascination over his horses had significantly helped Steven's initial crush on the noble evolve beyond the unthinkable long time ago. Well, what felt like long ago only had been four years and counting.
Jan stopped her now furious flying around the coffee table in order to look at the blonde with a soft, understanding gaze. She had refused to sit before in favor of scuffing the floor with her heels as she stomped over it with more force than necessary; it was her way of showing how much the situation angered her.
He greeted everyone with a “good morning,” and a small wave, and was equally acknowledged by the others with a couple of small nods, a jovial ‘morning!’ and even a hung-over ‘what’s so good about it!?’ from Clint.
Immediately, he searched for Peter and found him stuck to the closest wall, he’d probably barely escaped the first round of bullets and guided himself with his spider-sense. However, Tony could see the two goons that were originally by Peter’s side dead on the floor, an arrow sticking out of their necks.
Steve, being Captain America and all, wasn’t convinced that their conversation could realy mean the end of the whole situation. Things were never that easy no matter the finality in Tony’s voice. Instead, he gave Tony a well planted kiss and before it could turn into a passionate one, he pulled back and continued with the topic at hand.
“Maybe he thinks that Rhodey will come around?” she asked hopefully stretching her tiny hand to take the one that Steve wasn’t using to hold his cup of coffee. It was then that the super soldier realized that his own cup had turned cold as well, so he put it on the table beside Jan’s, using it so that both of his hands covered one of hers in appreciation.
“He didn’t know I was there, okay?” Tony clarified, but surely Rhodey was hallucinating because there was no way that Tony’s tone was a tad defensive. Of his cheating boyfriend. He surely wasn't.
“I care about Tony,” he stated with all the honesty that he could muster. This was something that Steve felt was completely necessary to get across the Colonel’s thick skull in order to proceed. “I care about him more than I should considering that I’m the leader of a superhero team whose main job is to keep the world safe and I should care equally for all my people, but I don’t, and that’s something I’ve come to terms with.”
with each other, Steve still couldn't figure out what occurring inside the brunette's head that resulted in retreat the moment Steve started talking about what was happening between them. It was frustrating beyond words and it has been wearing Steve down for such a long time in a way that he didn't know how to handle it anymore.
“Hey, you shouldn’t be. Stop looking at me like that, Steve.” Steve knew he meant the pained face he was probably pulling right now. “I called you a brainless gorilla wrapped in a flag. I think we’re even.”
“Tony, he’s cheating on you,” he said it as if Tony was missing that single little detail. “You will never be in your ‘right fucking mind’ if you don’t think that the obvious solution is to send him to hell and make him stay there.” when Tony looked as if his wording confused him, he explained with all the annoyance he could muster “Break up with him!”
This time it was Steve who chuckled. He did feel way more at ease by the fact that he now knew that at least two of the list of people Tony care's about what they think just approved him, and he was confident enough to think that Jarvis did too if the satisfied smiles he threw his way everytime he physically forced Tony out of the workshop to make him eat something, sleep or both were any indication.
“Just like you, it would seem,” Steven smiled smugly looking at the responding member between Anthony’s legs.
Then, perhaps they would be disrupted by a sound in the forest, usually a singing bird or a gentle push of the wind swaying the trees, and be reminded that they should get going, Steve always being the first to put his foot outside The Circle. The walk back would be bearable, amazing even, because they would hold hands on their way to the castle while talking about what had happened over the time they last saw the other freely like that.
"Hey, it's too early in the morning to start attempting to empty my alcohol cabinet!" Tony yelled after them. Then reflected his words and added, "At least leave something for me!"
And then, there was silence. Tony took a quick look around the warehouse only to find that the battle was over, at least inside; he paid more attention and he clearly heard a fight still going on outside. Typical; it was taking Steve’s team no time to wipe them all out; acting more like a strike team now than an actual superhero’s team. Nevertheless, Thug-number-one’s grip on him didn’t loosen a bit and by the looks of it, he didn’t have any intention of giving up just yet.
“Yes, she is scary like that…” Tony agreed with a shudder, “So let me add to what you just said that the fact that she includes you in her schemes of world domination is so unfair in
They were in an empty warehouse but for a pile of boxes on the far corner away from the entrance and the two desks and two tables full of things Steve haven’t ever seen before and knew better than to ask about.
Nothing but Anthony’s good reflexes saved him as he rolled the moment he made contact with the ground and lashed out to the wolf's snout with his torch, eliciting an angry and wounded bark from the animal as the blow landed directly on its eye.
“I’m glad to hear that, I really am,” Steve decided to push his luck with a small kiss on the forehead that had been just slapped by its owner. Tony snapped back as if burned and now looked Steve with glare full of mistrust.
to say! What happened to the freedom you always appear so fond of? You can’t just fuck my brains out and expect everything to be peachy!” With a firm glare directed at Steve, Tony tried to explain with his arms just how angry the brunette was and how not-forgiven Steve was, “You’re just too-!” the genius continued, struggling with the spell to find the right word to curse the supersoldier with, “Fucking bossy! And way out of line!”
“Tony,” Steve in a persuasive tone, “I know this is very important to you. Maybe I should try one more time?”
Since there were no howling of the damned in the horizon or fire alarms all over New York, Rhodey came to the conclusion that the article represented the paparazzi being desperate for something to write since the last alien invasion or great robbery that would sell. Rhodey could feel a big lawsuit coming their way on behalf of a very pissed off Tony Stark.
“Captain Rogers, a word?” War Machine asked, when Steve turned to face him with a raised eyebrow. The tone that was reserved for him was back; dark, threatening, full of the promise of a painful death.
“I don’t want to end anything! I want you to apologise immediately, you ass! Tony raged at him. But then seemed aware of this own words and became even angrier. Judging by Tony’s furious expression, Steve knew that he was planning on saying something completely different and hurtful, but not honest enough to pass the Honesty Serum's test. Before Steve could apologise again as he was asked to do, Tony decided to keep their horrid tradition when he probably thought that it was enough honesty for the day and went for a hasty retreat, “If you’re not getting out, then
“You’re amazing,” Steve confessed what he always thought, especially at this kind of moments, but never said aloud, “You’re everything to me, Tony. I wish I could have you like this every waking moment.”
“As flattered and tempted as I am,” Tony pointed out running a playful hand slowly up Steve’s inner thigh. “Wouldn’t you be always jealous when I needed to leave the tower?”
I totally believe you took the same thing,” Tony declared after a small silence took place in which Steve tried to get his skin colour to resemble something at least more human, “It really is a bitch not being able to stop, isn’t it?”
“How stupid do you think I am?” The super soldier asked annoyed, uncrossing his arms to curl his fingers into fists. "I know he is here, Rhodes."
“It does when it is quite obvious that you would be riding with me, of course.” Von Doom answered with a little darker voice; it would seem that he wasn't amused at Anthony's first outburst.
Steve couldn't wait for the whole world to know about them so they could actually go to those things as a couple and for the dames to stop trying to hit on Tony and himself in front of each other; there was so much that he could handle.
Denying himself the human instinct to submit before the sudden fear that traveled through his veins, he kept the same rhythm as before, knowing that if he fell, the wolf would get an advantage that he couldn't afford, therefore he kept his eyes on the soil surrounding his steps, searching for any unwelcomed pieces of nature that stood over the ground and seemed determined to make him trip.
I really hope you enjoyed this chapter and that you'll leave your comments, kudos and constructive criticism! Remember that I'm not a native speaker and I sometimes need a nudge to the right grammar direction. Thank you for reading!
“I’m a complicated kind of guy, comes with all the genius, you know?” Tony’s smirk was so false that it almost made Steve grimace at its sight. “Maybe you should go bother a nice simple girl with all this instead, don’t you think?”
"So?!" Janet asked the second the doors opened and pushed her way to the front, "What happened? Are you guys finally together?" she finished with an excited clap of her hands.
“Am I sensing some sarcasm somewhere in between those words?” James asked bumping his fist lightly on Steven’s shoulder, “Because if there is, you’re doomed to work by yourself all day, let me tell you.”
“I love you so much that it hurts.” Tony continued when some air got into his own lungs, “Sometimes I can’t believe I haven’t died yet over how much it hurts me to listen to you saying you love me over and over and not being able to say it back, no matter how much I yearned for it. I’m so sorry, Steve, this is all my fault. I shouldn’t have let us get this far; I should have pushed you away the first time we kissed right on this couch.”
"Weren't you supposed to be the one watching my back on this?" Steve asked indignantly at the assassin.
Steven arrived at the stable just in time to start his tasks. He didn’t have time for breakfast, but it was nothing against the extra minutes that he got with Anthony. Satisfied for a breathtaking night and a magnificent morning, he put on his overalls and his work boots from his small room near the barn so he wouldn't dirty his clothes.
“Do you want to say something, servant?” Lord Obadiah asked mockingly as if daring him to speak up before his supposed masters. The utter bastard.
So! I totally couldn't update this sooner, I had a long business trip to surprise me and ruin my publishing schedule. So I decided to post it with minimal editing for now and continue editing later tomorrow or I will take even more to update this chapter. Sorry about all the possible mistakes this have as it is now. Please do help me with the editing and point me in the right direction, it would be appreciated.
“Ah, don’t worry about it,” the chauffer dismissed with a pronounced wave of the hand closest to him. “I’ll come clean with her today; I don’t think she’d care, though. I really am just cutting you some slack, considering the fact that in a few minutes you’re entering into a war zone and I’m personally taking you to it. Guilt makes you spill the beans, my friend!”
“Seriously, Steve, let it go. So what if my best friend doesn’t like you? I love you and that’s what it’s important, right?” he finished his statement with a chaste kiss on Steve’s lips and a good grope of his ass to show his encouragement in his own way.
Queen Maria Collins Carbonell of Stark had been quite the character not only within the world of humans, but in the magic realm as well. She'd been the first human, never mind beta, to be the head of the white fairy foundation, The White Court, which had granted her the Grater Name of the White Queen between the humans. Her contributions to the city had been full of helpful magic and human kindness; everyone in the kingdom had loved her and had mourned her death sincerely.
It was said with so much intensity that Steve was a little shocked at his lack of surprise when he realized that she not only knew that he was pulling something but exactly what he was about to do. Instead of saying something incriminating and remembering that he had decided a long time ago to let the mystery that was Black Widow alone, he opted to take the offer that she was making and said, “hold the fort while I’m gone.”
A small silence took place as Tony seemed to search for something in Rhodey’s eyes. When he appeared to be satisfied, he let go a long suffering sigh.
“Tony,” Rhodey called for him to further explain. When the genius didn’t seem about to open his mouth or at least look at him anymore, Rhodey decided to push it, "
“Let me go!” Tony demanded as he forcefully pulled against Steve's grip with each word in a futile attempt to free himself. But Steve was sick of this,
“I just want you to be happy!” Tony said defensively, matching his rise of tone and instantly crossing his arms in front of his chest.
you have to tell me,” his lover demanded with clear indignation on his behalf and Steve thought that was adorable. “Did he call you?”
“Hey!” This got Clint and Jan's attention alright. In a second after they exchanged a challenging look with each other, they bolted upstairs as if it was a matter of life or death, “Flying is considered cheating, you cheating cheater!”
"No! I swear we didn't, honeybear! You stopped us right on time." Tony promised with those ridiculous pleading eyes he oftened used with Pepper when he wanted to get out of an important meeting. Judging Rogers' expression, he knew it well, too.
Captain America was when he blushed! Believe me, ‘adorable’ is not a word within a Stark’s vocabulary if it’s not accompanied with sarcasm. I was really shocked; I almost missed a red light... that’s a funny story for another day, by the way.” Happy concluded.
“What happened?” Tony inquired gently while running his hands slowly up and down Steve’s neck. The Captain gave up his tense demeanor and found comfort by rounding Tony’s slim waist with his arms. “You seem really frustrated, and don’t you try to deny it because that’s my normal state and I can recognize it from miles away.”
They woke up with the first light of the sun; Anthony would kiss Steven for as long as he was allowed because someone had to be the responsible lover and Anthony was surely not going to be that. The alpha would say that it was already late and that they should get up. Then, they would slowly leave the comfort of their cheap bed, the only other witness of their activities the night before, and dress while throwing as much caresses at each other as they could, hidden behind playful pretensions of helping the other to get dressed faster, even if in the end it would have the opposite effect.
At Tony’s confusion and lack of response, Steve decided to elaborate, “You said I should go, but do you want me to?”
“Please don't be scared of how I feel for you, Tony. You can’t possibly imagine how happy I would be if my words wouldn’t make you this frightened, how wonderful it would be for you to feel joy about a love confession I make. In return, it would make me ridiculously happy to hear something like that from you,” as Tony chewed on his lip as if trying to stay quiet, Steve knew the time had come when he had to stop playing around and go to the core of the matter, “I really hope that you will forgive my selfishness after I ask you the main question I wish to ask. Would you forgive me, Tony?”
“Now, we’re even. You can ask me anything you want as well and I will have to be truthful to you, too.”
“Are you taking that to Tony?” Natasha asked while staring at him with an elegant, raised eyebrow as she buttered her bagel. She already knew the answer, of course, but it was her way of letting him know that she knew he was up to something.
Steve didn’t even try to stop the blush of utter embarrassment when he realized that he had said that out loud. Tony was rubbing more and more on him if he was starting to talk out loud without his own permission. Not a good sign. “Sorry.”
Even if Rhodes frustrated him big time, it would be unfair of him to get him in trouble with Tony over the phone call that Steve had initiated. Besides, like hell would he go to his lover to
"Yes, we are together." They blurted out and looked at each other; Tony with an accusing glare and Steve with an apologetic smile.
He took a calming breath, if Steve was going to hear the details of the rapist situation, he wanted Tony to explain it to Steve himself. That last one, though, the ‘playboy ways’, he
“True.” He teased with a smile. “So let’s get to the part that started all of this: What was the Colonel's response to
"Longing, rusted, seventeen...” Bates started to chant, and Tony could only look as Barnes started to lose his control over himself, grabbing at his head as if it was hurting, “...daybreak,-”
Many questions remained unasked even if the spell held power and Steve was sure that there will be even more as they started building their relationship. Some questions will be answered, some others will be forgotten and some will be replaced. The difference now was that Steve now knew that, even if stubborn, they could figure out anything that came their way. Together.
, so that he can stop denying it and we can, you know, have an honest conversation to end this nonsense.” He finished shyly.
As if to prove Steve's thoughts right, Tony’s hands let go off his shirt to move them slowly up along the supersoldier's chest and to surround gently Steve’s neck. Steve grabbed the opportunity and angled Tony’s face using his grip on the brunette’s jaw while the other slid from the wall to pull Tony impossibly closer to him. They kissed like that for what felt like hours, Steve denying any attempt from Tony to deepen the kiss, wishing for this peaceful, gentle moment to go on for as long as it could.
I hope you enjoyed it! I'm sure there are still a lot of mistakes (it will never be perfect) so if you find something to improve, please do tell me so I can fix it. Thanks a lot for the support! Now that my soul is more at peace, I can finally concentrate on finishing up 'The Royal Circle'.
A name has high meaning in the magic world and has been sacred for all the living creatures, magical or not, to treasure and respect their given names. A name is power and protection, a reflection of the soul and the marked history of its ancestry. A nickname, a twist of one's name, was frowned upon in most societies and considered insults with sometimes the exception of when loved ones pronounced them. The consensus of allowing someone to twist one’s name meant giving power over oneself and creating a powerful bond.
Tony seemed to take his words into consideration because a few seconds later, he sighed and murmured “Yeah, you’re right.” then he went straight to Rhodey’s bathroom without even sparing a glance at the guest’s room.
“He’s not here. Fuck off.” He said simply, summoning the most deadly glare he could twist his face into.
Still, there was the possibility that he didn't have a clue, especially considering what it took Steve to make the genius believe that he was in their relationship for the long run, and that Tony actually deserved to be happy with someone he loved.
It was impossible to miss at this distance, but Tony knew it hadn’t hit him when there was no additional pain pounding through his wounds and nothing turned into infinite black as he died tragically. He slowly opened his eyes even when he heard another three shots being fired at him.
“I won't ever hurt you purposely. You are worth it, Tony, no matter what you say to yourself every time you look in the mirror, you are and always will be worth it to me.
“It is, a little.” Steve agreed mockingly, but at his friend fake-gloom, he decided to add, “But you get enough ‘action’ from Sharon, don’t you?”
It seemed that Steve really lost this round. He was done. He couldn’t take it anymore; the physical closeness, the emotional fortress around Tony's heart, the lies, the hurtful words, the screaming at each other, the draining of his physical and mental energy with every word. He let Tony go completely, finally deciding to let Tony have his desired space in order to pace around the kitchen, even at risk of Tony fleeing. He was again glad that it was three thirty in the morning and no matter the decibels of their yelling, it was highly unlikely that someone would step in on them.
Steve always considered himself, overall, an honest man; not needing to resort to any form of foul play to get the job done and trying at all times to fulfil his goals in the most righteous way possible. He was a man who knew what he wanted but preferred to go to the moon and back to get it rather than to find shortcuts and get an innocent party hurt just so he could obtain anything the easy way. He was Captain America, after all.
“Really, Steve,” she said as if explaining to a particularly slow child. “Don’t you know that the first step to a relationship free of rocks in your path is to ALWAYS make sure that the best friend likes you?!”
“Of course I’m jealous,” Steven groaned while putting his free arm over his eyes to hide his face. “I´m an alpha male, I want to reap apart every single person who looks at you in a lusty way all the time. Not to mention what I want to do to whoever touches you in general. And let me tell you, that’s
“Why does Tony's friends always think that something’s wrong with him?” Steve asked with humor. He figured it would be best not to lead this conversation anywhere near to a repetition of the call with Rhodes, so he has started with a little humor. But this time he wasn’t nervous; this was Pepper. Pepper
Steve’s smile faded a bit when as his mind reproached him. Steve then wondered how it would’ve turned out if Howard was still alive and the super soldier was looking for
“Tony…” Steve called with all the gentleness he could muster. He caressed Tony’s cheekbones with his thumbs to comfort him, to ask him for forgiveness and to coerce him into looking at him. Steve got the desired effect as Tony slowly opened his eyes to look him in the eye.
“Tony,” Steve pleaded with exasperation, taking a step towards the retreating genius and thinking about the right question to ask. He found it: “What do you want?”
“I covered for your ass so you could go and play with the Royal Fire all night, so now you must cover
Also! There's only one very-fluffy chapter left! I hope that you're enjoying it so far and that you'll leave me lots of comments! Also, because this is part of a huge fic that I might never finish, you guys can ask me anything about the story and I'll try to answer any question.
“You can’t be serious,” Tony disagreed while slowly shacking his head. “Steve’s the best thing that’s ever happened to me.”
“Do not talk to him like that.” Everyone turned as Tony almost spat those words. Even Steven was surprised at the defence, considering they knew they couldn’t show any affection towards the other while having any kind of witnesses around. “He has a name, it is Steven Rogers, and he is about to put the saddle on my horse so we can go on our way. Does that displeases you, my Lord?”
The answer he received was rather fast for Anthony to process fully as he suddenly found himself against the door, pinned by a gorgeous, muscular, tall, perfect, blond body and with a tongue in his mouth, stealing all the air he worked so hard to get back to his lungs. Not that Anthony was complaining.
He hadn’t had only lost his beloved mother, but his father as well as he got consumed by grief and addictions. Not even Prince Robert Bruce Stark Banner, the alpha son of the first wife of the king and heir to the kingdom, had been able to help him out of his grief and misery at the death of his second wife. Soon, the heir had given up and decided to take care of the kingdom instead of their father. Both King and Prince had surrounded themselves with their own problems and forgotten all about twelve-year-old Anthony. Everyone but Virginia Potts, the youngest prince's favourite maid, and Edwing Jarvis, his trusted mentor, left him alone.
Just when he began to wonder where James was, he heard a loud yawn near the entrance of the stable. James “Bucky” Barnes was stretching out and looking at Steven leeringly and with a huge smirk on his face, causing the blonde to turn red in a matter of seconds.
!” Steven started the scolding of a lifetime that Anthony had predicted the minute he'd decided to go into the woods in the middle of the night. The genius figured that now it would probably be even worse considering the ‘almost greeting the god of death’ situation. “How can you be so absolutely
“Happy,” he acknowledged the smiling man with a small nod. “What are you doing here? Did Pepper ask you to come for Tony?”
It was exactly two minutes later when the two of them, one barely clothed and the other soaked wet, emerged from the colonel's room in a quick step, heading straight to the door.
“All night,” he confessed for the sake of having a little fun at his lover expense. “He wouldn’t take no for an answer.”
The blonde almost fell down when he saw that indeed Anthony was there, but he was trying to discreetly put some distance between himself and the disappointingly handsome gentleman that was walking way too close beside him for Steven’s liking.
Something must have shown on his face since Happy chuckled and put a reassuring hand on his shoulder. “Nothing like Pepper and Rhodey, Captain, rest assured. It’s simply not my style and I’m sure you’re doomed to live through Jarvis’ polite harassing in the near future, and let me tell you something; British butlers can be quite scary. So my condolences and my most sincere sympathy. ”
“Your loss.” Happy assured with a chuckle. “But that’s the whole point, Captain, since the moment you two stopped fighting like a divorced couple, the boss’ve been love sick. You should’ve felt the aura around him when you both were in your ‘its-unrequited-love!’ phase; he was a complete mess... more than usual.”
“We are all a family, I agree, but it won’t break apart if we have an argument, Tony. That’s just part of life and, let's be honest, it's a part of how we communicate with each other. If it’s not you and me fighting, then it could be Thor and Clint over the remote, or Janet and Hank if you want an example more relationship-wise. I mean, they
“You did something to me!” He yelled pointing a finger at Steve accusingly, “There’s no way in hell I would’ve said all that willingly just for being sleep-deprived!” When Steve didn’t comment or defended himself at his accusation, Tony grew even more irritated, “I wouldn’t have believed this if I weren’t experiencing this myself! Steve! What the hell did you do to me!?”
“How can you even say that? Why can’t you give us a chance, Tony?” Steve asked trying to make those eyes look at him again to no avail, not without letting him go, and they were finally talking about it. “Why do you have to make something so simple this complicated?”
“No, Rhodey, we are talking about the sport section where my cricket team lost big time against the weather.” Tony replied with a tone that screamed sarcasm. “Yes! We are fucking talking about that article!”
Steve wondered if Tony would be upset if they actually got into a physical fight, because Steve could almost
“Dad!” Peter called suddenly and Tony snapped out of it when he noticed that Thug-number-one was moving them towards what looked like a well-camouflaged door. Despite his concussion-induced dizziness, Tony tried to move away from his captor, but the hard press of the gun’s barrel into his skull was warning enough. He didn’t want to die in front of Peter, so he would have to dial down the risk-taking until he found a more realistic opening.
“That’s great!” Steve tried to express with more enthusiasm than he was actually feeling, “You’re in the most capable hands considering your… situation.”
“Captain, let’s get something clear,” the moment those words left Rhodes lips, Steve knew he was due to long series of calming, just-don’t-kill-him breaths. “I really didn’t know Howard Stark; I was introduced to him by Tony once and I spotted him in a couple of events from afar. Let me tell you something, I didn’t need to know him, or hear the guy out, or read about him on the newspapers or anything to hate his guts; I only needed to know how Tony was doing his best to kill himself over impossible tasks while trying to make a father that wouldn’t even bother to give his son the time of the day for something other than complaints and disappointment.
As if suddenly turning on a really bright light, Tony looked sharply at Steve as if he suddenly understood everything that was happening in his mind.
“Bates,” he returned, walking calmly where Bucky and Peter were standing. It seemed that the situation demanded them to stand over an invisible line that seemed to mark the limit of how close they could get to Tony without ‘Bates’ blowing his brains out. Bates is
“Don’t push your luck, Rogers.” Steve turned back to offer a confident smile in response. Rhodes just shook his head as if regretting giving him a chance in the first place. When their eyes met again, the hostility was back on full power. “If you ever break, make unhappy or hurt him in any way, I’d recommend you to stay low for a long while, Captain, ‘cause all the Air Force will be tailing your ass to make sure you don’t show up your face on the surface of the Earth ever again, do you copy?”
The tense moment passed when Rhodes decided to redirect his gaze to Tony again. "You better call me in the morning, or I'm calling Pepper."
“Maybe you should take a bath before your meeting,” Rhodey suggested with a mock sniff at Tony’s disarrayed figure. His friend response was to push him away and give him the finger, only provoking Rhodes to laugh at his antics.
He really hoped it didn’t get to that point. He was rather conflicted about it but, again, it was his only shot and he had to do it right.
Their relationship was as complicated as it could be with Anthony being royalty, always surrounded with fake and superficial people that only wanted to take “their” share of the Stark power and fortune, and Steven being just a stable boy that happened to know enough of fighting and combat techniques to be the current champion of the annual low-class' warrior tournament, not having enough prestige to even participate in the ones that Anthony was forced to attend to.
“But you deserve better than that.” Rhodes was tempted to follow his sentence with a complete catalogue of despiteful adjectives that could describe the icon, but he knew it wasn’t the way to get through to Tony, the genius was loyal; the more he insulted fucking Rogers (he could insult him in his head), the more Tony would stand up for him. He was weird like that.
Wow, could this be more of a DRAMA?! Still, I hope you liked it! I wanted Steve and Tony to have a conversation right away, but it just wouldn't happen... don't worry, no matter what, I plan to make the next chapter my last one... I'll try VERY hard to not make it longer, especially since it wasn't that popular, hehe, which I understand, cause it was horribly written, really.
"Thanks, Happy", Steve said as he got into the limo and on the copilot seat so Happy could close the door behind him. Steve thought he may have imagined the little pleased smile that flashed on the driver’s face as he rounded the car to get on the pilot’s seat. For what? Steve would never know.
“No! You cheating, tyrant! Let me go, now!” Tony demanded along with more struggling. Steve wasn’t even a little winded, though. As the struggling progressed, Steve secured his hold on his lover with his right hand and got the other purple vial out of his other jeans' pocket with his left one. He held the vial up to Tony's face so he would calm down enough to see what he was holding. It worked as Tony finally stopped struggling, “What? Do you plan to poison me even more?”
Steve suspected that Rhodes’ dislike of him was based only on superficial reasons considering he actually didn’t know the guy very well and Steve didn’t think he deliberately did something to piss him of, therefore he did not find it necessary to spend much time thinking about it and also hadn’t deemed it necessary to take the time for self-reflection regarding the situation. Besides, the super soldier had spoken to the man for no more than a few minutes a handful of times and even during those extremely rare events, they'd only talked of Avenger’s business and nothing else.
“Man, you’re going to make me cry,” James commented while fake wiping his face, but never losing the soft look on his eyes. “You really do love him, don’t you?”
Confession! I had this chapter written a long time ago, but I really wanted to get to 650 kudos before updating... BUT! That never happened and I got tired of waiting, so! I decided that no matter who liked the story or not, I had to finish updating this small part of the whole story if only for the people that already kudoed and commented on it! To those people, this is for you, thank you for the support!
“I don’t want to dump him, Rhodey.” Tony admitted quite lamely still from his defeated position on the ground. He was probably feeling so down that being on the floor gave him some kind of mental comfort. Or so Rhodey thought because his friend seemed unwilling to stand up, as if he lacked the energy or the will to do it. “I don’t want to give our relationship some time. I don’t want to freaking break up with him.”
It seemed like Rogers was about to try to tackle him to the ground after the colonel's comment, but Tony, quick thinker he was, intervened hastily.
His heart stopped for a moment and strained his hearing to try to pick his son’s voice out from all the loud noises of shooting, grunting and the bodies hitting the ground. Before the panic could settle into Tony’s soul courtesy of his wild imagination, the backup generator kicked in and there was light again. Not as glaring as before, but a faint kind obviously made for lasting longer while in emergencies.
That was probably why when he saw the headline on the first page of a neatly folded Daily Bugle, he thought nothing but an easy
“Hey! You mean that!” Tony said with indignation putting some distance in between them. Of course, that only provided Steve with a better view of Tony’s body.
“This may be the smartest thing you’ve ever said, kid,” Logan stated with finality, but he still passed by Steve and clamped on his shoulder amicably, especially for Logan, so Steve took it as a subtle congratulation. The mutant didn't lose any more time and asked Storm to join him upstairs for a beer. She amusedly agreed and followed him out. At the mention of a good beer, Coulson and Luke also decided to skip the drama and go straight to the alcohol.
The supersoldier, of course, just wanted to crawl under his bed and die quietly. He had been ready to open up fully to Tony, but not to the whole team. However, his admission of their sexual activities only seemed to amuse Tony because he started laughing at his lava-red-blush. Maybe the genius was just glad that karma was already collecting his dues.
It was all it took for Steve to reposition themselves on the couch. He turned them both so Tony had his back on the cushions, giving Steve the chance to pin him down with only his weight. Steve looked at Tony intently without moving, he waited till Tony’s eyes opened searching for his own sky blue; impatience and frustration at the sudden halt of the movement were easily read all over his face. That’s when he decided to thrust into Tony slowly, carefully.
Now, Steve was a soldier himself, so he knew how hostile some of his fellow soldiers could get over a simple misunderstanding, except Steve could not think of a moment with the Lieutenant Colonel when such a thing could have happened. He wracked his brain and yet the results always ended with not a single clue popping up in his mind because, once again, he had only ever talked to the man about the Avengers… and maybe about Tony.
“He… asked you to dance repeatedly?” Steven asked with a new voice. Anthony tried to connect it with a previous moment in their relationship when he'd heard it, and after just a second, he recalled the tone as the one that rarely showed his visage but in special occasions; Steven was jealous.
At this, Rhodes looked a little startled. For once, Steve noticed he didn’t immediately find the words to throw him off, so he grabbed the opportunity and continued;
For Tony, though, it was all about avoiding him and any form of feelings that could relate to the supersoldier, even to a point where human nature seemed to break its own laws in favour of granting the genius super-speed to run for the hills of solitude where Steve couldn't reach him. That or Extremis, Steve couldn't be entirely sure. He had to admit that he wouldn’t have been able to grab the genius’ arm to physically stop him if it weren’t for his enhanced reflexes.
Okay, this is nothing new, I know, sorry about that. I just found myself recently reading this thanks to an unexpected comment, after all these years, and I decided to prove to myself how much my English has improved. That's why I started to re-write some of my stories (starting with The Royal Circle) and noticed the number of mistakes that this had! It was outrageous!
James Rhodes wasn't a news fan. It was too much drama and easy sway into believing anything the reporter was payed to say. Written words were better for him, easier to read between lines. He learned that a long time ago.
“Shut up,” Steven demanded with a scoff, but secretly revelling in the fact that he had someone who mocked him about his relationship with Anthony. It made it more real. “You know why he calls me ‘Captain’, and ‘Tony’ may not be much of a nickname, but it comes from somewhere deep, so don’t mock it. Not even his family calls him that.”
about giving Tony up to someone I thought wasn’t good enough; even if I knew he would still be there for me no matter what.”
“Don’t presume that I need his permission to do anything, Captain.” Rhodes seethed, taking a step out into the hall to get face to face with the super soldier. “Besides, I don’t think he would even vouch for you; he’s pretty upset.”
“He was pissed that I was going out with a national icon that ‘probably just have a crush on me’. I told him that his lack of faith in me was insulting.” He scoffed. “I can’t believe that he actually told you directly to leave me alone or something. I was pretty clear when I told him to leave you alone.”
? You have nothing to threaten me with, Captain, you’re clearly going to kill me either way. Or at least, you’ll try.” Bates answered with way more confidence than Tony was comfortable with, he just made a point of it by embracing Tony to him harder, making sure he didn’t leave any openings to an attack and in the process making pressure on what probably was a bruised rib. Really? Fuck this guy. Though, Steve looked impossibly more murderous by the hydra soldier’s lack of compliance, “Either you keep the kid and let me walk away with your husband-”
“Excuse me?” Lord Obadiah asked in disbelief, Steven could see his hands glowing with dark magic already. “I believe that you are being disrespectful to our fine guest.”
sick of this. He was just so tired of Tony running away from what has been obviously happening between them, and Steve, for once, wasn’t willing to respect his wishes, anymore.
“Peter,” the supersoldier called firmly, turning to look at his step-son right in the eyes, “You have to trust me. He
“Of course you are,” the genius conceded sarcastically eyeing the destroyed device. “I can even see the wonderful piece of art you were trying to create with the wall, the floor and the newest Starkphone. Very modern, let me tell you.” Tony didn't give up his need to comfort Steve and he followed his walk until he was standing infront of him. At seeing his calmed, worried stare, Steve at last relaxed a little and let Tony cup his face with both hands.
Crown Prince Bruce was quite dense if he couldn’t see the sheer terror on his brother’s face at the mere idea. Steven wanted nothing else but to push the touchy noble away from his beloved and enclose him in his arms just to never let go. Instead, the young future king led his beautiful wife away after the proper courtesies were exchanged and exited the stable.
“I know you only want what’s best for the boss and I don’t think there’s anyone better suited to deal with him and keep him alive at the same time.” Happy complimented while pointedly looking at the road. Steve couldn’t stop the smile reaching his face at the words. He felt a little guilty for doubting Happy’s honest and free spirit. “Pepper does think so too, by the way. She’s just holding a grudge for what she calls ‘Tony mopping over me for months while I had to deal with everything at the company at the same time!’ stage when you were still fighting like five-year-olds. In reality, she’d blamed you for saying stuff that hurt the boss at first, but she’s over that, she knows it was a two way street and she can see how good you’re for the boss.”
“Fuck.” He cursed and shut the front door quietly as he re-entered the apartment. He knew since he first spoke to the soldier that he was determined to speak to Tony came hell or high water and it was just a matter of time before he got to do it, or at least a location in the off chance that Tony really wasn’t here. Still, misunderstanding or not, it was Rhodes’ job as a friend to give him the hardest time he could manage.
In one swift move, Steve got Tony’s face between his hands, bodies touching and blue eyes staring at him with fading anger. Tony was never good at staying mad at Steve when they were looking at each other’s eyes and the supersoldier wanted to take advantage of it.
“What are you saying? I’m perfectly awake! Vegas awake! You just don't understand my impeccable taste in music, Jay.”
Even Rhodes had to stop looking for his specially developed and manufactured match-grade military ammunition
“But that, Steven, is what makes you so amazing, in my opinion,” she finished softly. Steve was startled by her words and he was sure the confusion on his face was showing because Wanda immediately elaborated with a small smile, “You’d give your everything to someone, to something, for the sole convictions that live within your heart. This is why people follow you everywhere, no matter what,” she stated without giving space for arguments, “Anthony Stark is a really lucky guy. Too bad he’s giving you a hard time, you deserve better.”
Steven could recognize the imploring eyes on Anthony’s face anywhere, but this time, they were directed to his lover’s half-brother, who seemed to be considering the situation.
“But it’s more about Colonel Rhodes.” He finished trying to ignore her implication. It seemed that out of office’s duties Tony was rubbing a little on Pepper, or maybe this sarcasm came with her and was the reason they got along so well.
Anthony’s favourite lesson would be, even before mathematics and physics, horse riding. Being the only one they could spend together out under the bright sun.
“Anyway! That's a story for another moment!" She dismised his cuestion with a wave of her hand. Steve was going to complain, but she continued with a malicious glint in her eyes and the blond decided to leave it for now. "Now, my friend, if you’re that determined to talk to Rhodey and try to patch things up (or at least get a little revenge for what he said– just saying! No need to glare at me like that!), then we call in the big cavalry.”
The gall of the fucking guy. He even sounded honestly relieved that he'd found Tony. James now was truly regreting not having gone for the gun. Even a knife would have sufficed. Damn his self-control.
“That’s exactly what the boss said you always say when he tells you you’re sulking!” the chauffer remarked with an easy laugh full of amazement. “But before we touch the subject, you should probably get in the car first. Rhodey will literally kill you if you are late. And let me tell you, Captain, America’s biggest hero is not having a painfully death under my watch.”
Rogers, the sneaky bastard, seemed to have waited his opportunity to enter the apartment without engaging with physical contact with Rhodes. So when Rhodey moved back to grab the door, he gave the supersoldier the opportunity to side step him so he could enter his home with the same grace as he would dodge a supervillain attack. As unflattering as that thought may be.
He wasn’t even looking at what was happening around him, he was going straight for Tony in a way that only an enraged and determined Spiderman could, identity be damned. Sensing the danger, the hydra soldier on his left took aim at Peter and fired three quick shots which were no issue for the young hero’s spider-sense and dexterity.
Anthony was barely minutes away from his destination when he heard the howling of what he fervently hoped was a trained, hunting dog, but knew in his brilliant mind that it was most likely a hungry wolf. If fate hated him —and it usually does
“Not my husband anymore, Thug-number-one,” Tony couldn’t help but remind everyone in the room of that
“Yes.” Steve stated while he resisted averting his eyes from Rhodes’ who was still staring, or scowling, at him without blinking. Steve thought it was important to maintain eye contact, especially after finally realizing that the Colonel’s problem with him was probably because he didn’t like sharing Tony. The stare only got worse when Tony put his arms around Steve’s waist as if he wouldn’t let go no matter what.
“Hey, my fan club is awesome! At a safe distance, of course. They pulled me out of prison once.” At Steve’s incredulous
“Jan, darling,” Hank tried to contain his wife's excitement by taking her hand and pulling on it gently towards the door, “why don’t we just head to the living room before Steve dies from embarrassment and you can choose a different from the horrible one that Clint chose?”
With a grunt, he silently wondered who could it be at nine o’clock in the morning and was shocked to find no other than Tony Stark on the other side of the door.
Steve moved slowly, as if not to scare Tony any more than he already had. He felt his own heart breaking at the pain he was causing his love, but he had decided that there was no turning back. He took his beloved’s face between his hands again and forced him to look directly at his own. When his sky blue eyes met Tony's dark blue ones, the genius’ eyes turned glassy, imploring. A dry sob escaped his lips.
“You think?! And you are not even sorry for the right reasons!” Tony accused angrily, “Steve, you can come here and just force a confession out of me!” They both had to pause to reflect on what left Tony's lips for a second. They both realized that neither could even try to lie to be sarcastic or to complain, apparently. It only served to get Tony even more upset; he threw his hands up in the air with exasperation and openly cursed his life, “Okay! You
And there went Steve’s gratefulness for the lack of hostility down the sewer. Apparently Tony knew how to pick friends, because these ones cared enough to threaten Captain America personally one by one. But Hogan was right; he really did want to get this friends-bullying phase over with.
ass while I’m being lazy and take my time to enjoy my breakfast.” He paused after that as if in consideration, “Do you realize that it’s really depressing that you get all the good action and all I can come up with is about food?”
“I told him the truth, Rogers;” Tony was using the tone of voice that was clear for anyone that knew him that he was upset, “that I saw you kissing another woman before I arrived to
For one instant there, he wanted to ask about the so called rapist. It was something that had been nagging him since it came out of Rhodes’ mouth. But considering the urge of shaking answers out of his lover so he could hunt down the responsible and make them pay dearly, he decided, for the sake of avoiding a big argument, to voice his other concern instead: “I never apologized for the things I called you when we met.” He confessed finally.
“Your denial has gone too far, Tony. You don’t have to lie to me to convince yourself,” Steve interrupted Tony’s insulting excuses, “I’m not you, I can actually come to terms with my own feelings and the ones of the people around me. Why can’t you just accept it? Why are you trying so hard to keep us from what could be a wonderful thing? From what
“Who is this new guest in your castle?” Steven asked after a long silence filled with caresses and sounds of contentment from both of them. Steven rubbed circles on Anthony’s back while the genius did the same to the blond’s chest. “Who’s so important that
“Well, I thought it wasn’t necessary considering that I wasn’t a defenseless victim enduring your evil harassment since I was striking right back at you, Steve. We are both guilty.”
Well, that was as close to an apology as he was going to get and there was a “please” there somewhere, so Rhodes complied.
“Why do we not hasten our steps so we do not lose more time of this lovely morning, gentlemen? We only have one hour, after all.” Anthony asked in another attempt to keep the attention away from Steven. The blonde appreciated the effort to protect him, but it only made him angrier.
“Well, I probably deserved that,” Steve agreed with a wince when his mind started running all kind of scenarios of Tony being tortured and dying in the dessert. Accepting it didn’t mean that it had to make him feel any better, though.
Then he would continue following down the hierarchy of his lover’s favourites and work on Dummy, a German Black Forest foal, then You, a Dominant White horse and lastly Butterfingers, an imported Irish Sport steed; not that the last one wasn’t loved, but the blonde horse did tend to make Anthony fall quite a lot, even though he was more social than Dummy, who was only interested in Anthony and got jealous of Vision all the time. Why Dummy was higher ranking in the affections of the prince than You, who was truly efficient, only Anthony knew.
Steve was tired of debating to deaf ears and exhausted of demonstrating to blind eyes. He’s been trying to dance with someone who refused to even step into the dance floor when it mattered and he was starting to get desperate.
Bates shook him into silence, hustling again his wounds enough for him to gasp in pain, making Steve resume his stare-of-doom, and the Hydra soldier allowed himself to continue as if Tony hadn’t said a thing, “or I will kill him and you will kill me. Nothing else to it. So, either we both die or we both live. I don’t care much which one, mind you. I have been ready to die for Hydra since my enlisting, and what a way to go: taking Captain America’s true love down with me and leaving his only son traumatized? Beautiful.”
“Are you implying that you only need a few minutes to manipulate him?” Rhodey asked. If he were a dragon, he would be spiting acid with his words, “You’re the fucking worst, Rogers. He’s not here, so
“Lord von Doom was not asking, Anthony,” Lord Obadiah intervened darkly already from the horse he was sitting on as he was being tended by James. The lord’s always loyal henchman on the horse next to him.
“And you were doing so well,” Tony said with mock hurt. “Besides, it doesn’t matter, Rhodey, I’ll probably end up forgiving him even if he did kiss that woman.”
“Do you love me?” the supersoldier whispered with the most hopeful tone he has ever accomplished. Steve felt the air missing in his lungs. He felt like drowning under freezing water all over again, along with the feeling of knowing that he would never get to stop the cold.
“Okay, his part I’m gonna make a small polite resume.” Tony announced warily. Steve could tell that he wasn’t going to like it. “He said that you were nothing but a big asshole that didn’t read the files before judging me and that your ego got to the point where you couldn’t see beyond your ‘greatness’ and that you should shut the fuck up when you didn’t know shit.”
“I just want you to know that.” Steve lied smoothly. But maybe not so much considering the skeptical look he was receiving from Tony.
“Get away from me!” Anthony yelled uselessly at the hungry growls that couldn't be fooled by a hidden passageway now that they had his scent to pursue him.
Two years after the death of the queen, King Howard Anthony Walter Stark passed away and the problems of the kingdom multiplied with his death.
“And will that work?” Steve asked tentatively, not knowing what to think about the name change. Was it really necessary? It probably was; if Tony discovered he was being hexed before Steve wanted him to, he would certainly close his mouth and walk away in order to never speak to him again. He had one shot at this and any wrong movement would cost him Tony forever.
After that they’d been forced to come clean with the whole team.  Ever since, Tony had been afraid of Jan’s lecherous smirk, whilst Steve had made her his go-to person when he had relationship problems.
Steve was a smart guy, maybe not on Tony’s genius level, but smart enough to know that Tony’s issues wouldn’t disappear all of a sudden. Steve was aware that he did something desperate and awful, and that they wouldn’t have said a lot of things they had had without the serum. He knew.
Unjustly, he only counted with two advantages against the beasts: the memorized and familiar lane, and a greater motivation than just a possible satisfied stomach.
“More nervous than when you were going to tell us?” asked Jan, bemused. Tony had almost passed out when she’d lecherously asked him, in the middle of a movie night when they were the only three present, about the Stark-sounding-moans coming from Steve’s room the night before. When Tony had refused to answer her, and Steve was a speechless, blushing mess, she’d told them she already knew they were together and that she had tons of proof to back her up, so they should probably stop trying to hide their relationship.
Jan transformed back to her normal size and then let her full weight fall graciously on the seat next to Steve with a dramatic sigh. She took her formerly forgotten cup of cold coffee and took a small sip, grimacing at his now undesirable flavor.
“Bates, I’m warning you, let my husband go. I won’t say it again.” Steve threatened. Peter looked from his stepfather to the villain, to his father, looking by all means like he didn’t have a clue of what to do, but not willing to be the one to screw things up and get his father killed.
“Steve…” Tony made a needy sound that went straight to Steve’s own arousal. When Steve cupped him fully, Tony moaned loudly.
“Possessive much?” Tony probably intended that as a rhetorical question, but Wanda’s magic apparently couldn’t distinguish such a concept and forced him to answer anyway.
“Rhodey, say something!” Tony demanded excitedly, but Steve could hear the nervousness in his voice.
At Steve’s fidgeting and evident blushing, Jan decided to spare him a little from embarrassment and instead continued with the important topic. “Anyway, for someone like Tony, Rhodes’ opinion of you is very important. If Rhodey dislikes you, the Colonel may try to persuade Tony to move on to someone ‘better for him’” she finished, with air quotes.
Steve thought about it, about all the flaws and even more qualities that his lover possessed compared to his own. He thought about the good Tony did for the people and never gave himself the credit that he deserved. About the way he struggled when Steve carried him forcefully out of the workshop for a well-deserved (and forced) rest. About the way Steve left food near the equipment Tony was currently using because it was the only way that he would subconsciously eat and how adorable he would look when realizing that some of his tools had been replaced for fruit. He thought about the way he tried to make him smile with his sarcastic humor when Steve had had nightmares or he’d been sad over something. He thought about how he would wake up with a tangled Tony all over him because he wanted Steve to wake him up for a morning kiss before he left for a run.
“You wouldn’t like that answer, now would you?” Rhodes mocked, unfaced by the angered superhero. "And it's Lieutenant Colonel Rhodes for you."
“Captain Rogers,” Rhodes said instead while gesturing at the chair opposite to him. “Please take a seat.”
“No, I called him.” Steve confessed which made Tony blink his eyes in surprise. “Yeah, I asked JARVIS his mobile phone number, but apparently he already had mine because he knew it was me the moment he answered.”
“You know what happened;” he scoffed looking at his eyes with an expression that Rhodey couldn’t define, “You always read the paper first thing in the morning.”
“You shouldn’t endanger yourself like that because of wanting to see me, Tony.” Steven explained gently now. Anthony lulled by the voice of his love, “I wouldn’t forgive myself if something happened to you because of me. Because of anyone.”
And Steve’s mind went blank just for the voice alone. When he processed the words and stuttered for a response, Pepper had already hanged up on him.
Suddenly, Steven was looking directly at his eyes, his expression as serious as it gets. Without blinking, he stated without a doubt in his voice; “I’m yours as I’m able to be. And maybe not now, but I will one day be able to give you the world you deserve.”
of your presence by ordering us around; that I couldn’t stop seeing you as a brainless gorilla wrapped in a flag and couldn’t picture myself following you anywhere.”
“Thank you, Colonel.” Steve repeated while awkwardly standing up; his smile never faded, though. He offered his hand again, still knowing well that it wouldn’t be shaken back and the Colonel didn’t disappoint as he occupied his right hand to grab his cup of coffee and lead it to his lips instead. “I’d really like it if you’d someday call me Steve.” He threw the comment while already turning his back on the table and started to make his way towards the entrance, just in time to hear the answer.
“I won’t,” he said simply with the resolve Captain America was attributed to, “We are going to stay here and be honest to each other at least until the duration of the enchantment is over and that’s final, Tony. I’m serious; we have to end this torturous little dance that we have been doing right now.”
Steve tried to sound calm, he really did, but he was way past the point of simply annoyed. He almost had to leap for the brunette’s arm the moment Tony’s typical cowardice manifested again anytime the conversation turned anywhere near feelings and
“Tony!” he said surprised while making room for his best friend to get into the apartment. Before he could ask, the dark haired genius stomped his way in while rambling like a champ.
“Sorry.” He whispered sincerely, soothed by Tony’s touch and sarcasm when once upon a time it would’ve surely triggered another fight.
at the pregnant silence that followed Rogers' appology. He held his breath until Tony finally responded.
“You doubt them enough for you to try to find closure within the mystic ways," she insisted, "You want to hear it from his lips so you will know for sure that you’re not imagining his love expressions, that the way he speaks your name while you’re together can only mean what you are convinced it means. You want to know if your pining for him will lead to the result you seek so desperately.”
Soon, they were touching like it was the first time. Exploring, adoring, respecting each other’s bodies and the roles they took in their personal ritual. Steven was searching, patient, controlling the rhythm despite Anthony’s insistence to be faster, rougher.
“I almost lost you,” Steven whispered while lifting Anthony enough for him to bury his nose in his omega’s neck, squeezing as hard as he dared. “If I had been even a second late, you would’ve been…”
“Steve,” Natasha called before he could exit the kitchen so Steve could turn and meet her serious eyes, “good luck.”
“That’s the spirit! Now go on ahead and if you need anything, just call me,” Happy offered and Steve knew he was sincere. “I have to go and pick up the boss, you see, but you’ve got my number.”
Steve responded in kindly. He decided to stop it after a while when he noticed that there were too many clothes between them.
Tony seemed to have enough of listening to Steve and resumed his struggled, trying to use whatever Steve had shown him in the training room, but again was distracted when he saw Steve open the small bottle with his thumb, and stared in shock when he witnessed Steve swallowing the whole thing down in one go, wincing at the flavour, throwing dramatically the empty vial somewhere around the workshop's floor.
After that, everything went fuzzy. Steve allowed himself to continue only by instinct, all his consciousness was focused on Tony; the moans, the noises, the choked gasps, his expressions of pain and pleasure mixed together as he stretched him faster than normal.
“What's wrong?” Steve questioned, immediately disappointed that Tony was moving out of the range of his arms, “I thought we had it figured out.”
Making sure that Tony had no more demands, Steve's answer was simple: “I want that too, Tony,” he said with conviction, even the apologies were meant to last for all their lives and that was something Steve was willing to do for Tony. His genius finally let Steve close the distance between them enough for the supersoldier to put his hands over Tony's shoulders, “So what stops you to make it all happen? What's going on in that brilliant mind of yours?”
"Before you accuse someone of oversharing, I can assure you that you guys are totally obvious and we all have known for a while." Storm clarified with a smile.
Steven hesitated before answering, “Tony was the one who insisted. He said that he didn’t want his beloved,” Steven went a shade of red at his own words, “to call him anything like ‘Royal Highness’ or ‘Lord Anthony’. He said that he had enough of that for when we meet in public; he wanted to be more than just a title to me.”
she guessed easily and it was obvious that she didn’t need an answer to her own question that she didn’t wait for him to reply,
” Bucky whispered in a last attempt to calm him with just that one, meaningful nickname. It didn’t work completely; it wasn’t the right voice coming from the right lips. But it worked good enough.
“I must admit that there has always been this special vibe between you, even from when I used to live in the tower I was aware of it. I am not saying it is impossible that he returns your feelings, but-”
“Listen to yourself, man!” Rhodey said with exasperation, throwing his hands to the air to emphasize. “The man is a super soldier, for fuck’s sake!” he paused to calm his nerves a little before continuing, “Tones, you’re either being cheated on or you’re not. You can’t be both, so what
“Tony, for the last time, I swear to God! I was shocked and didn’t know how to pull back without physically hurting her.”
“So what are you suggesting, Tony?” Steve asked in a dark tone, “That you don’t want me to touch you again? That we should just pretend that this never happened and move on because you honestly believe that
!” despite Tony's words, he still didn't make any movement to break Steve's hold on his arm. With a controlled pull, Steve managed to crowd Tony against the wall of the kitchen again, finally being able to let Tony go so he could stop hurting him and trap him between his arms instead. They both knew at that point that any struggling on Tony's part with result in Steve catching him again and waiting until the stubborn man tired out.
“None of that, Lady Janet!” Thor boomed indignantly, “I’ve correctly predicted the exact week in which their relationship publicly began, as indicated by the Widow’s fair rules!”
Another good-hearted laugh came from the driver’s mouth.“Don’t worry, Captain, you should see the way the boss looks when he talks about you.” And before Steve thought that his blush couldn’t get any deeper, Happy continued, “And let me tell you something, if someone knows everything about the boss’ conquests, that would be me, don’t think Pepper knows everything about the boss; I’ve drove enough times to his Malibu mansion way too early in the mornings with the specific instructions of going to take boss’, let’s call them ‘party friends’, back home.
“Yeah…” the genius confirmed somberly, “he’s tried to call me like fifty times already. Maybe I should give up and call him back.”
Rhodey left a tense silence settle in the kitchen with the only intention of giving Tony enough time for his mind to catch up with his heart. Or maybe it was the other way around with the genius. Ten seconds later, the colonel thought it was adequate to continue.
“So what you’re saying is… that all of us must be rational or Tony would be already dead?” asked Steve honestly confused. It did make sense in some twisted kind of way, but not enough for him to link it to the topic.
It was faint, but the miracle came. Not in the way that Anthony grew wings to fly away from certain death, but in the form of a human response above the wolves’ barking. “Tony! Tony, where are you!?”
Perplexed but for a moment by the sudden declaration, Tony's lips twisted into a smirk and pushed them back together with a little mocking laugh, “I know
But they would never be even because Steve knew that Tony not only surpassed all his expectations, but he really
“I was quite desperate!” Steve defended himself in what he already knew it was a lame excuse. True, but lame anyhow. He then decided to not dig himself into the hole he was in any deeper, so he stood up and went in search for and put on his own pants, “I know it was awful and that I don't deserve your forgiveness. I know I decided this by myself and that nothing will change the fact that I abused your trust, Tony. I am sorry. I swear I'll make it up to you in this life and the next. I was just going crazy with all the mouse and cat nonsense. I thought it would be worth it, for both of us, if the potion created an opportunity to stop messing around and get together, already.”
“She did? That’s so like Pepper.” He responded dreamily. Steve saw then one of the things that Pepper possibly liked of Happy; if a simple thing like that could get him such a love-gaze, then he really must adore her. “Yes, I do love her a lot.”
“I will forgive you, but please don't ask this of me, Steve,” Tony’s eyes were begging now. He was obviously wanting to tell Steve to stop; that under normal circumstances he wouldn’t be confessing to all this. However, Tony's mouth kept moving, forming words that he didn’t mean to say without his permission, “I wish I wouldn’t forgive you after all of this, I really do, but I’m not able to deny you anything, not even forgiveness. Not even that after everything we've put each other through.”
It wasn’t long before Tony closed his eyes and responded with emotions of his own; fear, despair, sadness, insecurities and, under it all, love.
“Don’t be like that, Steve,” James asked with a dismissing hand. To break the sudden seriousness, he added, “Or should I say ‘
Steven saw red. He was glad that he had James by his side to give him an elbow to the ribs to help him put it back together. The alpha took a calming breath that drew the attention of Anthony, and in consequence, of the pompous noble at his side.
the marks on your body were mine alone. I felt as if I owned your body and you weren’t even aware of it.”
"I sure did, thanks for asking." the genius replied with a smirk firm on his face even if he seemed to have trouble getting his shirt on.
“I want you to be happy, okay?!" Tony screamed suddenly, but then his volume suddenly dropped when he continued, "I want you to be mine as well; I want to be with you; I want to live in a universe when you and I can be together without repercussions, alright?” the genius confessed and, for a moment, Steve's heart clenched in a mix of sadness and joy when he realized that this was Tony talking, not the spell. That he was freely choosing his words as if admitting to himself that he was as tired as Steve was for all the drama that they were carrying between them and the genius finally just wanted to honestly talk to Steve to sort this out. The blond was going to comment on it, expressing how amazing it was that they were finally on the same page, but he noticed that Tony wasn't finished and Steve immediately seized all attempts to interrupt him.
His bravado fell a considerable amount when he heard once again another terrible howl remarkably closer than the first one.
“I said to him that you’d insinuated that I was nothing but a spoiled brat who made himself an expensive toy in order to cure some of my boredom; that you told me that I just fought for myself and didn’t give a damn about anyone else and that I should stop acting like a hero because I was too selfish to ever become one.”
That provoked another laugh from Rhodey, the same one that died as soon as he saw that Tony was still on the depressed side despite his efforts to hide it.
He went straight for his sniper rifle under his bed while he tried to listen to the two arguing. Apparently he missed the beginning of the conversation, since when he finally managed to understand the words behind the wall, the discussion seemed to have skipped a portion.
Steve was about to put himself together when Tony's lips left his own and whispered in a low, sexy tone, "This does
Anthony just hoped that the panicked yell was real and not just a product of an overactive imagination granting him a final wish because its intention could be good, but it was still plain cruel to give false hope like that.
“What? Wait! Steve, don't let them drag me away! I want to stay here and help undress Steve a little more. Steve! Help!” Tony yelled after him, the girls didn’t even seem winded at his struggles and started a conversation between them as if Tony was just the purse they were dragging around, “These girls look like they are plotting something wicked! Hurry, assemble the team!”
The guest even had the gall to smile leeringly at the prince and looked incredibly pleased with the turn of events. He then positioned Anthony so he properly sat on the horse. The moment the prince was arranged as the Lord wanted, he surrounded him with his arms more tightly than necessary.
“Tony, are you even listening to yourself?” Rhodey asked disbelievingly along with a dry laugh, “I’m asking because you don’t seem to believe your own eyes, so maybe you don’t understand what comes out of your mouth.”
“Tony,” He said as quickly as he could. Trying to decipher the meaning behind Wanda’s neutral expression at the mention of the name, Steve couldn’t decide if her eyes showed confusion or maybe shock. A few seconds passed and the witch still didn't say a thing, so Steve elaborated in case she didn't hear him correctly or just to break the awkward silence, “Tony Stark?”
, Tony.” He summoned his most menacing words while emphasizing with the sound of a loading sniper rifle.
Moved by his alpha’s words, Anthony just thought it fair to reciprocate with all the honesty that he could muster, even when it was so hard for him to talk about feelings, but this was Steven, and he deserved more than just the world. “Steve,
“You do know that I only want what’s best for you, right?” Rhodey held his serious expression while asking this; he didn’t want to give Tony the chance to minimize his words with mocking or sarcasm. Not with this.
When Tony didn’t answer with any sarcastic come back and just pulled his cup of coffee closer to him instead, Rhodey frowned. “What happened?” he said in a voice that was more of a command than a question. He took a sip of his old coffee and took a sit directly in front of his friend so that the stubborn man would have to look at him at some point.
“This was probably the only agreement Pepper managed to force out of Rhodey.” replied Happy with simpathy in his eyes. “She did mention that he wasn’t exactly…
“And if I need to refresh your memory, my ma’ used to call me ‘Stevie’ when I was a kid, but in her last few years she started calling me ‘Steve’, saying that she refused to call her own son like everyone else and that it was more appropriate for a future little gentleman like myself. And even if it’s not a disruption of my name, there's a reason why Anthony calls me 'Cap' or ‘Captain’ as well; it has something to do with a personal dream of mine to become Captain of the Knights” Steven thought that he should as well finish the story. “I want Tony to call me 'Steve' because that's what I allow people precious to me to call me. But only Tony can call me 'Cap' because, for me, it’s like a promise to him that I’ll become a true gentleman, worthy of his hand one day.”
“You wish,” Rhodey scuffed and a real smile turned his lips. He knew that Tony meant that he came to Rhodes’ because he needed his best friend in order to make a decision. It was a shame that the decision included Steven fucking Rogers to be forgiven, but Rhodey was Tony’s best friend because he knew to respect the genius’ decisions, even if he didn’t like them. “Pepper get’s to know everything the moment it happens god-knows-how and she tells me, so I’m second to know everything; I probably know things that haven’t even happened before you do, man.”
the hostility in the air. It’s been a while since he wanted to take a defensive stance outside a battlefield.
“I’m Tony’s best friend. I’ve been with him through it all, Captain; his loneliness, his drinking problems, his parents passing away, the fucking rapist–”
Steve had proposed the idea to Wanda when they were nearly finished with Tony’s vial. He had hesitated to ask her before because he hadn't wanted to inconvenience her even more with another favour, but he had spent sleepless nights thinking about how he wanted Tony to be honest to him no matter what but also how he wanted to give Tony the same treatment in return. Wanda had agreed wholeheartedly.
, shall we?” this time, Rhodes sounded more hesitant. Steve didn’t mind the tone too much, so he lighted up again; that was more than what he thought he would get out of the meeting, anyway. He’d learned to appreciate the small victories. “Now stop wasting my time and go wherever superheroes-that-are-not-Tony go in their free time, Rogers.”
Some of you may have noticed I was trying to hone my description skills in this chapter. Boy, did I struggle. But how did I do? I hope you liked it and could clearly imagine the whole ballroom and the beautiful romantic scene. With that! I finish updating this story and leave this chapter as its end, hoping that one day I'll be able to finish the whole story. Thank you for all the kudos, comments and hits. See you in another one of my stories!
With the scare alone, Anthony thought all of the beasts deserved the painful death by the spikes-trap that he himself had helped to assemble.
The brunette’s dark hood fell from his head to his shoulders with the increased speed, revealing his young and handsome features to the darkness; his dark hair and deep blue eyes, accompanied with full lips and moderately sharp jaw with the beginnings of a beard colouring it.
“Jarvis, I love you and your infinite wisdom, but what you should do is put my music back on so I can continue building… whatever this is.”
“Wanda, I don’t doubt his feelings. Please stop trying to make me doubt them,” Steve reprimanded as gently as he could.
we’re talking about here, Steve.” Suddenly, Janet was completely serious. “I mean, if we’re protective of him, can you imagine how protective someone who has been with Tony through all of his problems since they were like, sixteen would be?”
The way things were going, he was probably condemned to be threatened by Dummy as well. Now that he thought about it, the robot probably did try in his own way when he first met him. Thank God that he passed that test with flying colors if Dummy’s robotic affection was any indication.
Steve was getting angry at being ignored, and even though he knew about most of the points Rhodes was trying to overwhelm him with, and was aware of their veracity, the one that had disturbed him the most was the one that he didn’t know anything at all. Just thinking of someone taking Tony like that…
"What I'm trying to say, is that I thought I could do it. I really thought I could, Steve, but I don't think I have it in me to be able to keep waiting for the moment when I have to watch you walk away with your American dream, anymore."
He went to the kitchen to start with the beverage and perhaps for the first time he felt relieved that Tony wasn't anywhere to be seen, and the only occupants of the room were the others having breakfast. Steve guessed that Tony was probably engrossed with something in the workshop; he seriously doubted that he would be in his room sleeping so shortly after they’d had an argument of the magnitude they had had a week ago. Tony normally needed at least that much of avoidance to get over it and start acting as if nothing happened, to Steve's utter frustration.
“Whatever keeps my mind at ease.” Rhodes finished ruffling Tony’s hair just to spite him. “How about that coffee you offered just before you dropped that bomb-of-news on my face?”
“No! It’s nothing like that, I promise! It’s not about Tony.” At the disbelieving scoff over the other side of the line, Steve tried to elaborate. “Well, it
Steve experienced the serum’s effects when he was ready to lie subtly or at least change the topic but instead, when he opened his mouth, words he wasn’t even really thinking poured out, “That was me, I tried to deny it because Clint and I were playing catch with a small ball in the kitchen when the coffee machine started distracting me with some noise and I was suddenly jealous of how much you love the damn thing and how you’re always ready to profess your love for it to the whole world while I was caught in your ‘these are only one-night-stands!’ speech. So I purposefully threw the ball to it with more strength than what was strictly necessary and I was glad it shattered because I was able to spend a lot of time with you while you were trying to fix it. I asked Clint and Thor not to tell you and we decided to act innocent and let you think it was Hulk who did it. I felt awful for Bruce, though.”
“Nothing, since Dr. Strange is not here. But it was really great to see you again, you should go to the Tower sometime, it would be nice for you to visit more often, I'm sure everyone would like to see you're doing well.”
“It would be if the spell would only last for the moment you interrogate him, but considering this is the first time that I prepare this particular hex, I don’t know the exact duration of its effects. You will have to keep him isolated so no one tries to take advantage of him and you must protect him from any harm while the spell last.”
When they pulled apart for air for the third time with their breathing a little more laboured, Steve couldn't help but think, for the second time that day, that it wasn't enough. Never enough. That even though Tony had feelings for him beyond their physical attraction, that Steve's own insecurities needed to assert some kind of ownership over this amazingly stubborn man. There was a limit to what Tony's actions could mean behind shared touches and they needed to actually let words label their twisted connection and put an end to both their fears.
“It seems I was. It’s a normal thing now, I'm even getting used to the feeling,” Steve, at that point, probably had just discovered a new kind of bright red since he felt like his face could catch on fire spontaneously any minute now by the amount of blushing he was sporting, “I was intrigued about it at the beginning; I never knew I was a jealous person until I met you. I can’t stand seeing you with anyone else. I even feel weird when you’re laughing around someone who’s not me. Even with another Avenger.”
“When you’re right, you’re fucking right, I’ll give you that;” he commented while shaking his head in surrender. “I should talk to Steve about it.”
“And what is ‘it’ that he has to be honest about?” The Scarlet Witch questioned with serene eyes. It was obvious to Steve that she already knew the answer to her question and she just needed first-hand confirmation.
Without much of an option, the Colonel followed his friend and refilled his cup with the last of the beverage when Tony finally relented his hold on the pot with a clear sign that he expected more coffee to appear within the promptly future.
?!” Rhodey asked outraged. All the implications that could be read from Tony's announcement suddenly made the situation as clear as water. Rhodey was then inspired; every dark thought he had had when he’d first seen the picture that morning reemerged, only this time the scenes were tainted with a lot more red than the original. Unless this whole thing was some miraculous misunderstanding, he was going to make Spangles pay, “You saw him kissing some other person with your own eyes? With you in the same room?!” Screw that, he was calling Happy
“That’s how his mother used to call him,” Steven confessed in a whisper in case someone was nearby, shoving the fodder in the last of the sacks with a little more force than necessary. “He told me that if she were still alive, that she surely would have supported us; she was a White Witch and she believed in true love above all else.”
If there was any doubt in his mind about what he was about to do, it was totally whipped out just for the thought of no more if’s alone, even if it was for a few hours at the most.
“Hey,” the military man called giving him a friendly punch on the shoulder. He was careful to say it with as much of sympathy that he could muster. As much as Rhodey didn’t think Rogers was the perfect match for Tony, he didn’t want his friend to be miserable. “I know you don’t want to, Tones, I really do…”
“Yes, you do,” Tony admitted with a dazed gaze. He started to pull Steve’s own shirt up, tracing his abdomen and making Steve gasp, “You have owned my body ever since the day you fucked me for the first time.”
“You’re kidding, right? Oh, that’s right, we can’t joke right now.” Steve was glad that Tony had somehow relaxed a little; his muscles more pliant under his fingers, even if his eyes were still harsh and unforgiven. Still, Steve considered it safe to loosen his grip and start rubbing his hand slowly over Tony’s back, “This is the first time I’ve ever seen you do something this
“Yeah, excuse my babbling. It was because, surprisingly enough, I give a damn about your opinion.” Tony muttered while trying to tame his hair once again. “I’ll go get the damn coffee,” he announced louder, heading for the kitchen.
“Really? Would you do that for me? I would really appreciate that.” Steve thanked relieved that he was going to let this situation on very capable hands. For a moment, he understood plainly Tony’s appreciation for the redhead.
That made Tony jump out of his chair and spin around to look at him with surprised, nervous eyes. Steve could see now the deep circles around his blue eyes. The defence stance the genius took at the sight of the supersoldier, though, was somewhat insulting, but he had to fight the sudden desire to make sweet, slow, protective sex to him to show the genius he wouldn’t ever hurt him.
“The more reason why I should talk to him.” Steve insisted, "please." he added as if that solved anything.
“Steve, it’s been a week since we've met with each other properly, I wasn't willing to wait any longer,” Anthony insisted stubbornly. “Besides, nothing happened.”
the prince’s eyes were yelling desperately, only to be widened by shock when at the next moment, there was a red light evolving him like a whip and then elevating the prince as he struggled. Steven was too slow to react as his lover was thrown carelessly on the horse, right over Lord von Doom’s lap.
“I give up!” Rhodey said dramatically – something he learned from all the time of being friends with Tony –, making a show of going to fetch his phone, “I’m calling Pepper.”
“Well?” Lord Obadiah dared him to comment on his actions. And that’s when Steven realized something; the evil lord was talking insistently to the stable boy. Something completely unthinkable in the days before when the lord used to pretend he didn’t exist.
“I don’t need something to force him to love me! He already loves me,” he argued a little indignant. She was not getting his point. It was starting to appear to Steve as if Wanda couldn’t believe in true, romantic love. But Steve got enough scepticism from Tony as it was, he really didn’t need someone else adding to it, “I just need to give him no escape for the feelings that he already has for me. I need him to talk to me so we can solve this together.”
It was a good thing that Tony had reinforced all the furniture in the tower in an almost unsuccessful attempt to stop buying a new living room every week. Steve didn't even notice when his hands stomped over the surface of the kitchen table, making everything on it jump. Tony didn't even blink, instinctively trusting Steve not to hurt him, but he stayed silent and tense.
Steve had naïvely thought that he could get this done without having to explain himself; the fewer that knew about this, the better. Tony's and his problems were theirs and only theirs. However, Wanda was making a solid point and he knew he had no right to be demanding privacy when he was asking huge favours. This may even be a perk of finding Wanda instead of the doctor. He could only imagine the horrors of trying to explain love issues to the wizard.
