He makes a surprised noise when Steve draws him in. His body goes rigid, but he doesn’t pull away, not even when Steve rubs circles into his back and rests his chin on dark hair that’s gone curly.
“Let’s go with that,” Steve quickly agreed before the suggestions became any more outlandish. Truth be told, he could use a fresh perspective on his missing item, but he knew better than to ask outright. Daryl was listening, and while it was one thing for their close-knit team to know he carried a torch for Tony Stark, but he wasn’t about to spill his business to a stranger and make work for SI’s PR team.
At that, Bruce and Thor exchanged a knowing look. Daryl’s expression compounded to pained and baffled.
When Laura finds him alone in the kitchen, scrubbing dishes by hand, she’s surprised, but doesn’t try very hard to dissuade him from doing the work. Maybe she’s too tired to argue, or maybe she senses a deeper need in his willingness to single-handedly clean up after nine people. She is Clint’s partner after all; Steve bets on the latter.
“Is that me?” Tony asked, voice nearly a whisper.
Clint whistled. “So many questions, and all of them wrong. Listen, just promise you’ll go in and get it yourself. No hiding behind ‘Tash or Sam, none of that sneaky-sneaky.”
Steve cast a suspicious glance to the side. “How do you know where it is?”
Anthony laughed. “Those who stand before progress in favor of peace deserve neither,” he said to Schmidt. From his pocket, he produced a vial of something wicked and blue. “Let him drink poison and prove you do not tolerate this sort of weakness!”
As leader, Steve’s own role is to punch through the roadblocks. Even if Wanda and Pietro were a problem he could solve, he doesn’t know what to do with the damage already done. As if he senses he’s being watched, Tony looks up, eyes flicking at once to where Steve is leaning against the threshold to the kitchen.
Though Steve would not ask him to risk the journey to the edge of the kingdom, Sam still offered his help. He advised Steve to ask the king for a strong horse, two bottles of Asgardian wine, and a special gift from the forges. Taking these, Steve journeyed to the edge of the kingdom where the creator of the marvelous armor lived.
Well, almost.
“Seriously?” Steve groaned. “Why do this?”
“Sure thing,” he agrees. “Come on.”
Abruptly, Steve shifts to his side, eyes fixed on Tony. He keeps his voice down out of courtesy, but he has to ask, “Why? I thought you had faith in this team, Tony, why do you keep finding ways to end us?”
Tomorrow’s a new day, when they’ll put their respective armors back on and get back to arguing about trying to win wars before they start, but for tonight, they hold on.
“What is it? What can I do, Tony?”
Later that night, Steve met Sharon in a modern speakeasy that was somewhat busy for a week night. Still, they’d managed to find a quiet spot in the corner and were hunched over a couple of beers, a basket of fries, and the ugliest mugshot ever taken. Seriously, how was HYDRA still claiming to be a master race when their latest lieutenant looked like a syphilitic thumb with tiny eyes?
“That is my battle to fight,” Steve replied. “You, who captures the sun to shine at night, you do not deserve to create things that kill for Schmidt.”
“Sharon, you can’t just say that here!”
In a kingdom far away, there lived a king who was obsessed with power and would do anything to obtain it. The king had a squire, who was small and sickly, but always strove to be good. The good squire had a dear friend with whom he would spend time hunting or training. One day, the two friends were walking upon a path in the woods when they stumbled upon a mask half buried in the dirt.
For a hopeful moment, his comm crackles to life. Instead of Tony quick and assuring voice, it’s JARVIS who answers. “Two agents of SHIELD are located on the eighth floor and two more on the ninth floor, Captain. I have already asked for emergency evacuation.”
Tony needs some of that, especially after the night he's had. Twenty-one days into their current catastrophe, Thor had paid him a visit to talk about it and the whole thing was far from encouraging. If anything, it felt horribly like deja vu.
When Steve was bathed and well-fed, he could not help but notice Anthony was as good looking as he was clever. He had warm brown eyes, and sported a well-trimmed beard. His arms were muscular from working the forge, and his hands, which must have shaped the golden faceplate Steve found all those days ago, moved fast and gracefully as he spoke of his work. Anthony, Steve learned, was an inventor.
He was smiley enough, but seemed more subdued than before. Steve nearly offered to cancel his plans when Tony looked up again.
He did this by leaning over Steve to gesticulate wildly, flinging water everywhere and letting his bare body bump up against Steve’s equally bare flank in the throes of passionate argument. Natasha argued back, but given the lack of conviction in her tone, Steve suspected she wasn’t trying to win more than she was trying to get a rise out of Tony.
For his part, Tony was staring back at him, expression strange. If Steve didn’t know better, he might have called it appreciative, but he did know better, so he braced instead for a retort from a man offended.
Beside Tony, Hill clears her throat. “The guys are almost done out there,” she reminds him, indicating the maintenance vessel. “We’ll let you know when it’s wheels up, Sub-director.”
Steve skids to a halt in front of Iron Man, mouth dry. Tony doesn’t have his helmet on and there are large gaps in the suit, like each piece has been arrested mid-undress. Between these gaps, Tony’s undersuit is dark, but there’s enough light to catch on the blood pouring out of his shoulder and pinpoint exactly where he ended up impaled on the steel bar.
The higher he climbs, the more hazardous things get. Steve holds his shield up over his head and the sound of pelting concrete and metal becomes a grim soundtrack. He is greeted by piles of rubble and the smell of hot steel when he enters the tenth floor. Wretchedly, he notices how the explosion’s torn the builders’ progress apart– unfixed concrete lies in huge chunks, spiked through with twisted rebar. The steel rods jut out like teeth behind a thick curtain of gray dust.
Steve falters a bit and Tony raises a pointed eyebrow. “I...?” he prods. It’s maybe a bit mean to do it in front of the SHIELD crew that Steve was pretending didn’t exist, but he needs to learn.
Truth was that Steve was utterly taken with the perfect craftsmanship of the golden mask. Looking at it, he did not share Sam’s unease, but felt a great longing for its creator. When he took it back to the castle and presented it to King Schmidt, the power-hungry king felt the same. But the king was not good like Steve, and he had different plans.
This time, Tony also rolls on to his side. He’s curled in on himself, so tight that Steve can’t imagine he’d been sleeping just moments ago. His eyes are wide and bright in the velvet darkness. “You said we’d win together or lose together,” Tony says. “But what if we don’t? I was shown the future, Steve, you were all dead. And it was my fault. Where’s
This is the statement Captain America makes to the world, flanked by Captain Marvel and Rhodey in the War Machine suit. It’s a good statement, bold and brave, and Tony is as inspired as anyone. He’d always quietly envied Steve Rogers' ability to make people find the best in themselves, but Sam has a way of reaching the exhausted, at encouraging the most depleted, downtrodden person on Earth to find a grain more of their strength and keep going.
“Oh no, we’re still meeting,” Sam replied quickly before Steve could make up something painfully unconvincing. Then, traitorously, he moved away from Steve and nodded at the newly cleared space. “Take a seat.”
That...was a fair point, but nobody ever said Captain America never came prepared. “What if the situation compromises the Avengers?”
Butterfingers chirped excitedly at that, and Tony snorted. “You’re a sucker for nostalgia, you know that?” he told the bot.
Tony jaw clenches briefly under another wave of pain. “Don’ mean t’be cheesy,” he says, each word strained. “But, mmm, kiss me?”
Unable to tolerate anymore, Steve refused, saying, “No, I won’t steal from a peaceful nation to power your machines of war.”
But Tony just exhaled through his nose and ventured to ask, “Is it, uh, anything to do with Peggy?”
At the moment, the elevator opened to Steve’s suite. He gave Tony a quick salute as he stepped out, but Tony still held the doors open. “Listen, Steve,” he called, and Steve turned back. “Not saying it won’t be hard, but nobody’ll stand in the way of a good thing. We trust you and, y’know...we’ll be there for you. And all that jazz.”
“Relay status,” he commands. “The armor, injuries, anything I need to know.”
Steve went straight back to the Tower and parked his motorbike in the expansive garage. “Is Tony out yet?” he asked hopefully.
Steve steps back and watches in disbelief as a small needle emerges from Tony’s open gauntlet and docks in his vein. Seconds later, Tony’s eyes flutter open again. This time, they’re just a little cloudy, a little absent.
Butterfingers actually jerked like it was taken aback at the accusation. Then, Tony chimed in to ask, “You accusing my robot of theft, Rogers? Do I need to get his lawyer on the phone?”
Steve bolts out of the hovering Quinjet, barely noticing the 15 foot drop, and his heart nearly stops when he sees the smoking crater blown in one of the higher floors of the building before him. It’s an office space still under construction and in any case, civilians have been cleared out of it hours ago, however…
“Oh,” Tony nodded and sat up on the couch. He scratched at an oily smear on his wrist. “Another time then, just have your people talk to my AI.”
Clint shrugged. “You’d be disappointed if I didn’t.”
“You’re such a basket case, Steve,” he says. “This is hardly our first extinction event and you have to go and be dramatic about it. After this is over, you bet we’re going to have a long talk.”
Steve must have looked pretty eager, because Bruce was quick to deny it. “Theoretically,” he said. “There is currently no feasible way to actually time travel.”
“Tony…”
“Mmm,” Tony sighs. “And it’s not like you couldn’t have moved my ass, no problem.”
“Yeah yeah,” Tony muttered, albeit indulgently, and tapped Steve’s shoulder on his way out. “Stay weird, old man.”
He closed his eyes and slumped back in his seat anyway. “Goddamn it."
“What’s plan A?”
“They’ll be fine,” Steve replies crisply. “Sam has them.”
The national news had been hacked and some Mandarin copycat wannabe was informing everyone from coast to coast that he’d rigged several New York city high rises to blow for every hour his demands weren’t met–his demands being the delivery of Tony Stark and the Iron Man.
Tony shudders in response, but it seems to do the trick. He burrows in, wrapping his own arm around Steve’s waist. It’s needful and tight, yet so fiercely protective that Steve thinks he can weep at how terribly he needs this himself.
Steve nodded. “Yeah, but that’s not the point, really.”
“Then, let’s order a wallet. You ok with leather?”
His hands shake when he approaches the ARC reactor. The clear, cyan glow ignites a surge of protective anger in his chest, the likes of which Steve has felt only a handful of times in his life. He can deal with general villainy all day, but for someone to have the audacity to reach for his family–
, but shivers.”
Surprisingly, Clint replied without extra commentary. “It’s in the Tower, Cap. Go home after this and find today’s copy of the Times. In it, there’s an article by a Ms. Huggenkiss. Read every third word and follow the clues.”
While he suffered in silence, Natasha reached around Steve’s elbow and took the last donut. Behind her, the Iron Man stared back in impassive judgement.
Steve considered. Outwardly, it did look like the Avengers tagged along with SHIELD. Their status was pretty ambiguous internally as well, which meant SHIELD would try to make decisions on their behalf and Tony was right to be concerned about that.
Steve made a frustrated noise of his own, not because he was particularly invested in the exchange rate between US Dollars and Asgardian space gold, but because his woes had nothing to do with money.
, and Steve really had no other choice but to notice how he was dressed to spar— cutoff shirt, hand wraps, trunks that hugged his waist just right... “And losing."
“Something needs to be done about that thing out there,” Steve replies. “And I came to help.”
“Yeah,” Tony agreed. “Turns out it hurt more than I thought. I mean, do you ever feel something, but you let it lie because why not, you have time. But then, life moves on, and next thing you know, you’re in the fucking elevator at 3AM and the guy you want to build a team with is giving you his 2-week notice, and⸺”
definitely was. Panicking, that is.
When he took it back to the castle, the king laughed with glee to receive the firebird armor. He duly dispensed the reward he promised Steve, then immediately set another task. “Since you were clever enough to fetch the armor, you must find it’s creator, Anthony, who dwells at the edge of the kingdom in a mansion of golden light. I must have him, and only him, to furnish my armies with weapons.”
“Ok, why?” Tony demanded, pitching forward curiously. “What’s so special about a wallet? Brooklyn diner won’t give you the early bird special without your AARP card?”
owner with second amendment
Steve winced. “I’ve plans tonight. Dinner with Sharon.”
As if on cue, the TV switched to an image of Tony speaking into a mic. The Thumb shouted something obscene and threw his beer bottle at the screen, which resulted in surprisingly less chaos than Steve anticipated. Mostly because almost all the other patrons had also drawn weapons.
Tony raised a brow just as the elevator slid open. “Uh-huh...”
Bummer.
He wipes down the counter after that, thoroughly so it gleams in the dim light. It brings him no satisfaction, but Steve doesn’t think Laura would appreciate him polishing her entire kitchen.
Steve raised his brow, taken mildly aback. “No,” he replied softly. “It’s nothing like that, Tony, I meant it’s sentimental.”
Steve held his smile for the eternity it took for the elevator doors to close, and slumped back against the wall as soon as they did.
“But I have witnessed such a judgment from the host before,” Thor had told him gravely. “A very long time ago. The Judge has decided that this planet is not viable, and has sent his Executioner, who will remake the Earth until all evil-doers are destroyed.”
Natasha laughed. “That’s cute. So last century, but cute.”
Tony grins, or rather, he does a grotesque impression of one. “Love it when you go full Cap, babe, but real quick…”
As it turned out, he needn’t have worried on that end. Tony was wearing briefs. Tight black ones, certainly, but they were there, thank god, because master tactician or not, Steve didn’t have a plan for dealing with a naked Tony lounging beside him in a hot tub.
“Woah, language.”
“What are you doing?” Tony asked, and lightweight that he was, Steve could already feel his face grow warm.
Tony drew his fingertip down the photo of himself, which had started this whole thing in the first place. “What was I even looking at?”
Anthony immediately let him into his house of wonders. Steve noticed all manner of curiosities crowding the rooms— ever-moving sculptures, half-formed constructions, mechanical creatures that moved by themselves, and those powered by blue light, very much like the armor.
“Well, spit it out,” Tony says. “The suspense is killing me.”
Steve pursed his lips. “Where is it?”
The monotony doesn’t make his annoyance go away, but it helps. Steve feels his shoulders relax as water sluices over the last plate, and the beige amalgam of gravy and soap give way to smooth white porcelain. Shaking excess water off, he transfers it to the drying rack to join the rest of the dishes, similarly clean and lined up like soldiers.
“Hilarious,” Steve deadpanned. “I have other important things in there.”
“I do not need much more time, love,” Anthony murmured. "Rest assured, I have not forgotten my promise. You shall have freedom and much more.”
Up close, the armor turned out to be empty of knights, but it was incredibly beautiful. As Steve secured the ropes, he marveled at intricate patterns of gold on the red sheath, gorgeous and intricate like the wings of a firebird.
Not to mention, the nation was better off with Tony overseeing operations than playing a bargaining chip. Indeed, while the rest of the team handled groundwork and evac, Tony and a handpicked contingent of SHIELD agents had located and disabled all of the explosives over the longest twelve hours anyone cared to remember.
The mask shone bright gold in the sun and it was warm to the touch when Steve picked it up. Overhead, the trees rustled as a breeze passed through the leaves, and the squire’s friend shivered.
And that blitzes the annoyance clean out of Tony’s head.
Steve sunk a fraction deeper into the jacuzzi so the warm, foaming water lapped at his throat. “Kind of.”
Tony doesn’t meet his eyes. Steve can hear him swallow heavily. “You don’t understand.”
“Since you were able to fetch Anthony from his mansion, you must acquire vibranium from the Golden City,” he said. "Do this, and your village shall be rewarded. Otherwise, all of Brooklyn shall be razed.”
Before Steve could respond, however, the door to the speakeasy slammed open and The Thumb walked in, flanked by two henchmen.
“Calm down,” Steve interrupted, hysterically unsure whether he was telling Tony or his own dick. “I think you’ve made your point. Government routers don’t make downloading any safer.”
“Iron Man, report!” Steve barks into the comms, running for the entrance without a thought for its stability. When there’s not answer, he tries again, “Tony! Where are you?”
From the branches above, Sam whistled and a flock of birds emerged from their nooks to surround the knight. One by one, they herded the knight off the path until it stumbled into a nearby pond and went under with a splash. Steve heard a series of crackling noises right after.
“Confirming by facial recognition,” Sharon said crisply. “But this is not over, Steve. Wherever you’re getting these batshit ideas⸺ “
the overtone hangs in the air as Hill signals the rest of the personnel to clear out. Tony doesn’t presume upon her opinion, but the way she smiles at Steve and says "It’s good to have you with us, Cap." is a pretty clear indication of where she stands on the matter.
“Oh, can I join you?” Steve asks quickly. Tony can see his fingers curled around the edge of the tray table, as if he’s ready to throw it off and Tony suddenly, viscerally
Fascinated, he listened to descriptions of irrigations systems, durable types of bridges, and lamps that collected the power of the sun in the day to illuminate his house at night.
Tony shakes his head. “Don’ be mad.”
“Tony!” he greeted instead. “What are you doing here?”
“So, you’re just going to leave it there?” Daryl frowned. “Won’t it go bad?”
Steve raised a brow, and mimicked Bruce’s tentative wave. So this was Daryl. When Thor first mentioned a flat and roommate in Australia, of all places, Steve admittedly hadn’t given it much more thought than he did stories about wild bilgesnipes or the Ginnungagap, but now, well, it was nice to put a face to the email address from which he’d been receiving irregular and rambling updates about Thor’s life down under.
“Like what?”
“Shouldn’t be alone, either,” Steve finishes. Tony can see his jaw set, his hands dig just a fraction more into the bed like he expects to be thrown out any minute. “I came because I wanted one of us to be at your side, Tony. We may not be the Avengers anymore, but it doesn’t mean we’re not a team.”
Surrender once, Steve realized, and they will never let you stop.
Tony frowned. “What?”
Steve spared one eye to the latest proposal to upgrade his shield, and kept the other on Tony. He was laid out over the length of Steve’s couch--one of those microfiber numbers that didn’t look comfortable to sit on, but was good for a power nap or two. His dark tanktop was wrinkled and his hands were grease-stained as he scratched thoughtfully at his beard.
Tony smirked. “You know, there’s no shame in asking for help, Capsicle. There’s a trick to these newfangled encryptions.”
“I’m not mad!” Steve counters, fully aware that he isn’t helping his case. “I’m just–you could have used the morphine five minutes ago!”
“We nearly did not,” Thor replied. “Odin and all the Skyfathers were no match for him. Our mothers prevailed, but through great sacrifice, which is why I must find my mother in Valhalla and seek her counsel.”
“All I think about is losing you,” he continues. “And I can’t let that happen.”
Tony got to keep Bruce, who was working with Strange and Reed Richards. Natasha and Clint were coordinating things in Eastern Europe. And last Tony heard, Steve was checking on his pal in Wakanda. Not that he looked very hard; Steve had taken his name off the Avengers roster, so locating him hadn't been a priority. Tony had 'retired' too, but things swung a bit off center after a space god showed up and he quickly found himself in charge of some parts of SHIELD that Nick and Maria had scraped together to deal with the crisis.
Steve thinks it might not have been loud enough after forcing its way through the lump in his throat, but Tony stirs. His expression is pinched in pain and his eyes are wet with tear tracks clearing a path down his right cheek, but he recognizes Steve.
“Do I⸺ you have no idea!” Steve exclaimed, unable to stop the sheer happiness inside him bubble up as delirious laughter. “The Avengers are my home, Tony, all I want is to make this team the best it can be. With you. God, especially with you.”
Steve figured the metaphor had gone too far at this point. Thor just shrugged. “We are immortal,” he said. “The pain of…disagreeable ham smarts a long time. Perhaps, it is best to wait for it to cure some more.”
His brow wrinkles promptly. No, that’s uncharitable. Despite everything, Clint still gave them sanctuary; Steve can hear him and Laura reading to the little ones in the den. Thor is out finding answers, but Natasha’s here, her hand wrapped around Bruce’s still shaking one as they talk to Fury. Tony has an empty space beside him and he’s uncharacteristically quiet as he sips coffee, but Steve can see his finger moving on the tablecloth, tracing trajectories and equations that would no doubt lead to something wondrous if not always perfect.
“Sir,” the feed from the UN shrinks to be replaced by Hill’s face. “We have a man overboard.”
“I want to apologize,” Steve says. “I shouldn’t have lost my temper earlier today.”
“You haven’t lost anyone,” he murmurs, as Tony’s breath grows hot on his collarbones. “I’m right here.”
Ok, maybe that wasn’t the best phrase to use, but it wasn’t inaccurate as Steve helplessly stared at the side of Tony’s head, where small droplets clung to the dark hairs at the nape of his neck and occasionally slipped down his shoulder and heaving pecs…
“Try me.”
“Of course, I would,” Steve assured them quickly. “And no need to assemble, I just lost my wallet the other day and I’ve had a hell of a time looking for it.”
“That’s a relief,” Tony said, then shrugged. “No offense, Cap, but FRIDAY tells me you rage quit the CyberSec module I prepared for you.”
The term emotional purgatory is probably not going to take off anytime soon, but it’s an apt description, Tony thinks, of what he’s feeling now as he listens to Steve describe the last 24 hours.
Another farcical debate began and this time, Steve felt his breath hitch as Tony’s ass directly wedged against this bare thigh and, wow, those were some really form-fitting underwear...
Steve looks back at him with equal wonder. “Tony, hi.”
And that’s the thing about Steve: he may be a terrible casual liar, but he was made to get out of potentially ruinous situations that might threaten the very structure of the team.
them, as Sam put it; he outfitted everyone on the team with the latest, meticulously customized tech so they could not only protect others, but themselves to the highest extent. And if something was beyond even his considerable expertise, well, Tony’s funds flowed on to the right people like water, too. Steve pulled his own weight by strategically throwing it around on Capitol Hill until he managed to procure hundreds of acres upstate, dedicated, like Tony asked, to the current and future roster of Avengers.
“Where are you going?”
Tony raised his brow as the elevator doors slid open. “I...that’s,” he took a deep breath while they stepped inside and punched the buttons to their respective floors. “So, it’s really serious?”
To say the following hours were tense was an understatement. Since the message was broadcast, Steve had everything thrown at him, from sharp words to actual garbage because some people saw his refusal to negotiate with a terrorist as reckless favoritism. They were wrong, however; Steve certainly acknowledged his bias for Tony, but giving up a teammate or any caliber of Starktech to a madman was certainly out of the question.
When he met Steve’s eyes again, however, his skepticism had already melted into something softer, more wondrous and promising.
“I’m sorry,” Tony says eventually. “I just...can’t, I can’t see the world like you, Steve.” His eyes are far away, fixed on something Steve suspects is much higher in the sky than the roof over their heads.
And so, Anthony demanded vibranium, for only the rarest and strongest metal in the world could withstand his inventions. None other would give Schmidt the army and the power he sought.
Steve caught sight of his forced smile and deflated. “About that,” he ventured. “Tony, can we talk? I’ve been an ass this week, and I’m sorry, but believe it or not, I thought I was doing the right thing.”
Tony pauses with his hand on the door. “Just to my quarters.”
The room he’s sharing with Tony is tastefully decorated with a handmade nightstand and a quilt patterned with daisies. A nightlight shaped like Tinkerbell casts a soft glow by the door, and by its meager light, Steve sees that Tony’s already taken up the far side of the bed. His first instinct is to leave, flee really; he doesn’t need much sleep anyway and there are some interesting books in the hallway shelf, but he reminds himself once again that this is not his floor in Avengers Tower.
“No other seafaring vessels or SOS signals in the area,” Hill says, joining Tony in a brisk pace down the corridor to the infirmary. “I want you to know we’re the only ones out here for miles.”
Tony looked skeptical. “Trust no one without a dark side, remember?”
“Uh, right,” Steve nods, and notices the silence. It’s not total— he can pick up footsteps on the floor above, and voices coming from the den, but they’re all muted in polite observance of an unspoken curfew. Even after a day of battle, of seeing strange visions, and watching cities get crushed, the silence reminds him that this is still somebody’s home and homes followed their own timetables.
“You took troubled, my friend,” Thor stated. “Your lips are drawn, and your face, pinched like a squalling babe. Is there something amiss in New York?”
“Hey, you find your wallet?”
“I do,” Steve grumbled back. “But the one in my wallet is still out there somewhere, where anyone can find it. Look, I’m not forcing you guys to help
“What?”
He’ll go back to his rooms; maybe make a pros and cons list of sending Steve back to the mainland on the maintenance boat, maybe make a pros and cons list of even starting that fight...
“Sorry, Captain, but no,” FRIDAY replied.
Oh, like hell.
“How does a crush on your teammate compromise the Avengers?”
“I didn’t rage quit,” Steve countered. “I just...we had emergencies.”
Steve was reminded of it on the times Clint joked about them going from measuring dicks to being joined at the hip, when Maria Hill started addressing memos to Cap I.M., and always whenever they were on mission and Tony casually tossed a ‘call it, boss’ or ‘what’s the plan, Steve’ over the comms.
“Ok…” Sam grabbed the last Boston creme from the box and licked it to protect it from Natasha. “Hey, do you still carry that picture of Stark around with you?”
Steve managed to pull off a mostly casual stroll to the elevator to head up to his suite. He smiled genially at Tony through the doors while pressing the button to his floor, and Tony stared back at him with undisguised suspicion.
Tony took a deep breath, like a drowning man taking his first gulp of air. He scrubbed his face again and said, “Good. Good, ‘cause I was...not taking that well.”
Steve spent his days in the lab doing as instructed—buying metals and powders and drawing up arcane blueprints— and his nights were spent in Anthony’s bed. They made love as concoctions bubbled away and the forge crackled in the distance. Steve could not tell what was in the works, and Anthony kissed and caressed him to distraction each time he thought about asking.
“I showed up for the weekly,” Tony replied. “but the conference room was empty and FRIDAY mentioned you all were here.” He smirked at Steve. “Forget how to update the calendar, Captain, or is this not that meeting?”
Tony looked skeptical, but didn’t actually say anything about it. He rattled commands off to his AI instead, “FRIDAY, order replacements for Cap’s charge cards and report his IDs as lost.”
“He wants to experience Earth,” Steve replied, swiveling back and forth on his office chair because Tony’s mood was catching. “What so bad about that? He’s not living in the trenches.”
“It was certainly something,” he said with a rueful smile. “I mean, don’t get me wrong, I love the action. And Sharon, she’s...well, she and I happen to be very good at action.
“Limit it to my recorded locations.” he commanded brusquely. “Last 48 hours."
“He jumped out into the ocean and swam 150 miles,” Tony translates. “I want that on the record, too.”
At 11 o’clock, Steve found himself struggling into his old uniform, which he he was sad to discover had not been mercilessly burnt months ago. It made him look like a cartoon, but the production team deemed it ‘child-and-adolescent-friendly’; not like his current uniform, which was just proficiently hostile, Captain Rogers, we’re talking to kids, not terrorists.
It was exhilarating. Without bureaucracy, ideas flowed like water. Tony...
"The lord is getting impatient,” Steve said weeks later, as they lay wrapped around each other. Anthony’s larger limbs smothered him in customary warmth and affection, but Steve was tight with worry. “Something will happen, I can feel it.”
On Tuesday evening, Steve signed into his weekly conference call with Thor and Bruce. There was an interesting friendship. Nobody had been surprised when Tony whisked Bruce away to bond over science, but it quickly became apparent that Thor not only had better insight into the kind of science that Bruce liked, but also lent a broad and supportive shoulder when it came to the whole uncontrolled rage monster aspect. A couple stories about berserkers casually slipped in at the right time, and Bruce discovered the one Avenger he didn’t have to worry about Hulk-ing out and hurting.
A troupe of Wakandan aid workers had given Steve a lift to northern Africa, where he took a Quinjet heading to the States. Once in New York, Bruce had helpfully briefed him on the locations of the rest of his original teammates, including Tony's new gig as SHIELD sub-director. And from there, it was easy enough to learn that the helicarrier would be making a scheduled maintenance stop near Hawaii.
Tony rubbed his eyes momentarily. “It’s bad PR,” he complained. “Thor’s an Avenger, not a broke grad student. And what kind of a name is Daryl? Anyone do a background check on the guy?”
“No, I’m sure it was an accident,” said Steve. He turned back to Butterfingers and looked into the blinking panel that he thought of as its eye. “I didn’t bring you anything when I was here to discuss upgrades last week, so you thought my wallet was a treat, right?”
“I’m not negotiating till I know the intel’s good, Clinton.”
The colossal entity was responsible, of course, and it was only because of knowledge gained during the course of their previous fight with Thanos that they managed to identify it as a Celestial. Tony remembers being grimly glad that he’d insisted on chronicling everything as he floated through space all those years ago. Unfortunately, that knowledge wasn't enough. Nobody knew how to stop a Celestial.
Tony seems to relax at that, very minutely. Agonizingly enough, Steve notes how careful he is not to lean on the very rods lancing through his flesh. He works quickly and carefully to clear bits of rubble from the cracks in the suit.
When they settled before the fireplace, Steve produced his bottles of Asgardian wine and offered Anthony a taste of the vintage. They broke the seal together and sighed at its fresh, crisp taste and faint echoes of Asgard’s sunny orchards. Steve remained careful not to partake of too much, but Anthony’s smile was intoxicating him nevertheless. Anthony himself did not have any reservations; he let Steve fill his glass over and over again, as he listened to stories of Brooklyn and Steve’s friends. He did not travel much toward the capital, Anthony admitted, because his mansion had all he needed.
He couldn’t help it, Steve positively beamed at the thought of seeing to his team’s best interests with Tony at his side. Now more than ever, he was determined to do what it took to clear their path, so Tony’s sharp wit and genius could build great things on it.
“It’s dead weight now,” Sam said. “You can take it without trouble.”
“Distracted,” Sharon snickered. “Was a certain billionaire philanthropist flexing in the vicinity?”
Whatever Wanda Maximoff did to his head leaves him feeling like a ghost, trapped between present circumstances and a dream of the past.
That night, they returned to the woods, and Steve did as Sam instructed. He hid himself behind a tree with a length of rope and watched Sam climb up the tree. Within the hour, the wind kicked up and the evening mists parted to reveal a knight, clad in a suit of armor painted in the colors of the sun. Amazed, Steve saw that the knight’s boots did not touch the ground, but hovered upon blue light pouring from the soles of its shoes and palms.
“Reed and Bruce are cooking up something called a Null Generator,” Tony replies. “My billion-dollar contribution to the idea is to put a jetpack on it. Damn straight, this’ll be over.”
Tony stared back at him, possibly for the first time, speechless. “Well, shit,” he managed to sigh. “How did we miss that?”
“I like you too,” Steve admitted. “Very much. I know it’s a lot, even in this day and age, and you’re a public figure, too.”
As if on cue, Clint shows up at the door in old pajamas and a bedhead. “Leave something for the chore wheel, Cap,” he says lightly. “It’s getting pretty late.”
Steve snorted, because after his disaster of an evening? Yeah. “I’d say it’s pretty damn serious, Tony. We can’t live divided like this.”
Steve watched Thor’s imitation of his face in mild alarm, and considered denying that anything was wrong, but then, Bruce also chimed in. “Not the way I’d have put it, but he’s not wrong, Cap. You’d call us if we need to assemble, right?”
“If you do not take me to your king,” Anthony pointed out. "your family will be forfeit. I know Schmidt’s ways.”
Completely to oblivious to the effect he was having, Tony made himself at home in his own jacuzzi, curling his arms over the rim so his right extended behind Steve’s back and his left behind Sam’s. If Tony didn’t stop squirming so blissfully under the warm water, Steve thought frantically, he was going to have a hard time in more than one sense of the phrase.
“It is your cash, then,” Thor guessed. “Worry not, if you require rent money, I shall send you some.” He upended Daryl’s urn so bright golden coins spilled across the desk. “Asgardian gold; each of these is worth a gazillion of your human dollars.”
Steve resisted the urge to fidget nervously. “No, I’m still looking.”
“Guys, good talking to you, but I have to go,” he told the webcam. Then, Steve smiled kindly at Daryl, “And about the Asgardian gold...contact your local SHIELD office, son.”
Despite Steven’s protestations, Anthony proved to be equally stubborn and won his way. Soon, they set off for King Schmidt’s castle.
“Already done, boss,” FRIDAY replied, more pleasantly than she’d done for Steve.
Steve watched as the Thumb seated himself at a barstool in front of the TV, and sighed fondly to himself, because yeah, Peggy believed in giving people a choice, even if she ended up with the short straw sometimes.
He didn’t want to be Sub-director Stark, but it let him work, gave him clearance to communicate with Alpha Flight, and a highly trained troupe of problem-solvers. Speaking of whom…
“All my friends are dead,” he begins, and waits out Tony’s answering groan. “Listen, not every nightmare comes true, but take it from someone who’s living yours, it⸺”
, Peggy had said, but Steve, plagued now with the same general malaise he feels whenever he remembers the events in DC, knows it’s not. There would always be a battle to win; nowadays, he’s less sure about who’s left to fight it. The Avengers were supposed to be different from SHIELD⸺ a team united not by what they hoped to gain, but by what they had to give. They were supposed to be better.
Steve rolled his eyes. “I forwarded it to Nat for a double check,” he said, and wondered if he should be insulted at how quickly Tony brightened again.
Steve leveled a last, displeased look at Clint and took up his cowl. God, he looked even stupider with his glorified stocking pulled over his head. Still, he quickly managed to school his features, paste on a winsome smile and straddle the chair provided because he’d been assured this was how the kids did it these days.
A moment passed in which nothing happened. In the corner of his eye, Steve saw Tony push his goggles up onto his head to observe, and he really hoped he didn’t look like a complete tool, bantering with a robot.
“Sam’s got the New Avengers at his back,” Steve replies. “And you know T’challa and Carol have their own troops, Tony, but you
Tony tastes bloody, yet he gives no indication to stop. Steve only pulls away when something starts beeping and JARVIS says, “Sir, I must insist–”
“I did,” Steve answered immediately, unable to help the proud uptilt in his voice. “Daryl buys a few more lottery tickets than he really should, but no signs that he’s a HYDRA sleeper.”
leave him here alone...
Also, since he would be asking them to cancel whatever plans they had at eight o’clock in the morning, Steve let Natasha pick refreshments and agreed to meet in a place of Sam’s choice. Naturally, he found himself wedged between the two in Stark Tower’s rooftop jacuzzi, sharing a box of donuts and drinking sangria before noon.
Luckily in the meantime, Nat had actually launched into a spiel about secure comms and text messages, which kept everyone’s libido pretty well in check. The problem only arose when she brought up the topic of government email servers and Tony got all up in her face for daring to compare their shoddy security to his.
Tony dropped his face into his hands and Steve trailed off. Perfect. He was a creep and Tony was embarrassed. Steve just began to contemplate finding the nearest block of ice to crawl back into when Tony looked up, eyes wide and mildly haunted.
“I’m really busy, Steve.”
Honestly, he’s missed Steve. For all of their natural tendencies to butt heads, things still feel better when they’re together. Sometimes, it feels like they show up in the strangest, most twisted parts of each other’s lives. Mostly, Tony feels like he’s twice as good as he ever was without Steve.
“Really?”
“Have a care how you speak to our friend, Daryl,” Thor warned mildly. “Captain America carries a ham in his wallet, true, but he does not eat it because he is afraid that though the ham is delectable and a very fine cut indeed, it still might disagree with him.”
“Why go through all the trouble, Steve?”
Throat tight, Steve watched his brown eyes struggle to remain open, then finally close in deep slumber. When he pulled them from his bag, the adamantium chains he bought alongside the wine glinted silver and cold in the hearthlight.
“Where do you expect to get vibranium?” Schmidt asked.
The sea of medics part when Tony enters, revealing the patient. Tony nearly stops in his tracks at the familiar sight of long blond hair and lean face behind a normally well-kept beard.
Steve immediately felt his cheeks heat. Barely hearing himself over the sound of his own pounding heartbeat, he said, “Yes, Tony, I will kiss on⸺”
When Wednesday morning rolled around, Steve didn’t see hair nor hide of Tony. He ate breakfast alone and went to debrief with Phil only to find out that Tony had emailed his update instead of attending. Three texts went unanswered, and when he asked FRIDAY to make a call, the AI informed him that her boss was on lockdown in his lab and that a huge chunk of Steve’s own day was blocked off for an outreach engagement.
“Tony,” Steve breathed in to steady his own breath, because his brain was having trouble reconciling what Tony said to what he’d convinced himself Tony would say. Nevertheless, he placed his hand over their engineer’s on the table, and felt it shake under his palm. “It’s ok. Really. I understand.”
“So,” he compassionately said to the camera. “Your bodies are changing...”
When they arrived, King Schmidt looked greedily upon Anthony and bade him to create terrifying weapons for all his troops. However, Anthony was not a compliant guest; he was sarcastic and irritable, and prone to fits of rage that only seemed to ebb as long as Schmidt provided him with a personal forge, a laboratory of his own, and many articles of science. At a particularly loud and explosive request, Schmidt even pressed Steve into his service.
“Putting aside that some kind of space gods think they’re entitled to say whether we all live or die, the Earth is still kicking, right?” Tony said. “How did you beat the Executioner back when?”
Sharon readied her gun. “You know what, Aunt Peg always told me two things: don’t put things off, and don’t think for others.”
Daryl looked pained. “I told you, nobody will exchange that.”
“I have allowed you time and resources aplenty,” he declared. “I demand you show me what you have done with it. Otherwise, I shall either assume you are not the inventor you claim to be, or that Steve has brought me the wrong person. In both cases, you have tricked me and shall pay the price.”
“The kingdom of Wakanda possesses a store of it so large that its people sew it into their clothes and build it into their homes,” Anthony said.
“We’re not fighting,” Steve agreed slowly. “But it’s touch and go, y’know? Last thing I want to do is throw off the team...balance.”
“Good morning, kids!”
in that?”
Steve flipped through it skeptically, but lo and behold, there was indeed an article by the person Clint mentioned. Amanda Huggenkiss, hilarious. And to top it all off, it was a critic’s review for a movie about⸺ Steve checked the title twice⸺ mobile phone emojis. Incredible.
He thumbed tensely through the video feed on his Starkpad. A panoramic view of every common area in the Tower was right there at his fingertips, and some not-so-common areas were just a passcode away. In addition, he had access to satellite feeds and other methods of surveillance that walked a thin line Constitution-wise, but none of them really solved his problem.
Steve sighed and took a sip from his own water bottle, carefully so he didn’t ruin his makeup. “Great, back to Plan A, then.”
“Captain, I’m doing my best,” FRIDAY protested. “A full building scan takes time, y’know?"
“Not today, fella,” Steve told it. “I have it on good authority that you took something of mine the other day.”
“You’re gaga over a ham?” he asked in a tone which made Steve suspect he was quite over the myth of superheroes.
Tony immediately folded his arms across his chest, looking troubled.  “Wh...um, what about the Avengers?”
He shook his head as images of lurid web articles and plummeting stocks charts did a macabre sort of conga through his brain. “Tony’ll hate me. The team splits, taking sides, and it’ll be too weird to work together anymore and
swarm that made the air thick with tension.
“Four hundred miles from the coast,” Tony interrupts then, drawing a sharp glance from the nice SHIELD interviewer. “I just, you know, I want that on the record. Four hundred miles out.”
“You don’t have proof that I was pickpocketed,” Steve told her sullenly, chasing a bit of sriracha mayo on his fingers. “I probably just misplaced it while distracted.”
“You’re asking me?” Clint feigned shock and awe. “Captain America wants
They didn’t need to see behind the shades to know Sam was rolling his eyes.
“But what about VPN?” Sam piped up innocently.
He’s at a loss for words because there’s nothing to say in the face of Steve keeping his promises. To defeat Thanos, they’d made a peace on which, as time passed, a new relationship started to grow. Tony didn’t give it a name, content as he was to let it make a name for itself. But somehow, it feels like Steve had been holding up his end of a line that Tony had let go slack.
Steve examined the lines of fascination and reverence etched into the picture. “The future, if I had to guess.”
billionai⸺,” Steve started to correct her without thinking, then closed his mouth in panic. Quickly, he inventoried people entering the bar: two guys in sports jerseys, a goth kid, and three women wearing identical red saris and flowers in their hair. Not a thumb among them, thankfully. But still!
Steve can’t help it, he’s a tactician. His eyes observe, his brain catalogs it all with indelible precision; Iron Man is impaled in three places: right shoulder, right gauntlet (there’s no evidence the flesh is wounded), and the left side of his abdomen. Steve doesn’t even have the time to think about all that can go wrong before the medics arrive. He just drops the shield and tries to say Tony’s name.
“Not a person,” Steve corrected. “My wallet.”
Sam didn’t look convinced. “You know it’s creepier to carry a picture around like that, right?”
Twelve hours ago, they’d been in bed. Twelve hours ago, Tony’s head was in his lap, and Steve was admiring how the dappled light streamed in through the window and stained his lover’s skin in bright little patches. Tony was expounding on the merits of breakfast in bed, mainly how he found it benefitted his health to just lie back on his supersoldier boyfriend while Steve fed him fruit and brioche toast.
Whatever it was, Steve was charmed to note that it matched the photo.
“Leave it, Steve,” Sam advised. “I sense misfortune if we take it with us.”
Tony had readily agreed, and as ever, he took it a step further, negotiating room for the future⸺systems to keep an eye out for more enhanced persons, proving grounds, and a dedicated home for what he called the world-saving sciences. Of course, he put this much thought into it. Steve wasn’t surprised, but he was strangely warmed at the notion of working with Tony, of being in step with Tony.
“I thought you were leaving the Avengers to be with Sharon.”
When they’re alone, Tony takes the opportunity to give Steve another once over. His cheeks are already showing signs of better health and aside from hair that needs a good shampoo, Steve seems as physically fine as can be expected. He also looks mightily interested at the contents of his food tray, so Tony figures this is as good a time as any to give him some space to recover.
It took a special kind of writer to create a teleprompter spread equating the super soldier experiment to puberty. Steve was impressed, learned a few new things, and yet he still left the studio in polite haste because there were whispers about USCIS wanting in on the PSA action, and he was in no mood to stand before a backdrop of the Statue of Liberty and talk about being an ‘immigrant of time’.
Taking the question as an invitation, Steve wandered closer and lay his wallet on the table between him and Tony. He flipped it open and slowly slid out the polaroid nestled in an inner pocket. It was slightly faded, but it was unmistakably a picture of Tony in a bespoke suit, leaning over to watch something obviously fascinating because his eyes were wide with wonder, and his expression almost loving.
Steve snapped his eyes open at the wry tenor, instantaneously flipping the Starkpad over. He found himself face to face with Tony, much like a deer in headlights. It was not a good look on him, and Tony’s brow rose in predictable confusion.
“You two are...so well-adjusted,” he sighed, diving back into the safety of booze and donuts. “Seriously, if I ever call you guys for advice, assume I’m a Skrull.”
Steve’s heart grew cold.
Steve stalled behind a long sip of his sangria. It was a good drink even if it wouldn’t get him buzzed, but it didn’t have a magic answer to Sam’s question, either.
Luckily, Butterfingers retreated to a corner of the lab and extricated something from a pile of other textile scraps. It came back with Steve’s wallet clutched carefully in its arm, and dropped it in his hands with a series of sad beeps.
As he listened to Bruce talk, Steve thought about how, for all that he knew about the longevities and loyalties of friendship, he’d underestimated the virtues of plain old peace of mind.
“So, I guess you didn’t walk away alright after all,” Tony says.
“Mr. Stark is on the tenth floor,” JARVIS says. The terse reply makes Steve more anxious, because he’s never had to drag good news out of Tony’s AI.
“Yeah,” he nodded. “That about sums it up.”
The director’s quarters on the helicarrier are pretty luxurious by the standard they have on these things. Still, two people are a tight fit because Tony’s arranged the space to suit himself and Steve has to adjust for his extra dimensions.
Steve must look exactly as pained as he feels because Tony immediately winces. “S’ry, that was offensive.”
“Absolutely, I’ll have to think about it,” he agreed. “We all know SHIELD’s definition of liaisoning is a bit skewed.”
“Come on, man, don’t mope,” Sam nudged at Steve’s calf with his foot underwater. “We’re just wondering, as friends do, why you haven’t told Stark how you feel. He’s single, you’re single; and now that you guys aren’t measuring dicks anymore, it can’t hurt to go out on a date or two.”
Steve wearily turned to the bartender, “And you?”
soldier, punk, plucky kid from Brooklyn
“But look at it,” Steve said breathlessly. “If we take this to the king and find favor with him, will it not benefit our families?“
“You had twenty dollars and fifty-nine cents, a visa credit card, a picture of Stark from the Expo last year, and about ten receipts from Fro-Yo Mama,” Clint smugly rattled off the contents of Steve’s wallet, then leered knowingly. “That’s interesting; wouldn’t have pegged you for such a fan of frozen yogurt.”
“And I hid in here to lick my wounds instead of fighting for you,” Tony mumbled. He slid his hand out from under Steve’s and intertwined their fingers together instead. “We’re both hopeless, but we got this far, somehow.”
Clint watches him hang the washcloth to dry. “You ok rooming with Stark?”
Tony scoffs. “I’m sorry, do we or do we not have a team on every continent? Are you seriously telling me Wilson or T’challa or Danvers couldn’t find you something to do?”
“Um.” Steve stared back speechlessly. Bruce took his glasses off to clean them, which he often did when he witnessed something impressive. Thor beamed proudly, but he still took pity and offered, “And if that fails, friend Bruce has been working on a way to travel back in time.”
“That’s ok,” Steve replied quickly. “I’m here to see Butterfingers. Won’t bother you at all.”
Steve obeys without a thought. He gingerly steps over the concrete and carefully leans over until their lips touch. Unsurprisingly, Tony is not as eager as usual, but he doesn’t stand for a chaste peck either. He makes small, needy noises until Steve brings both hands up to cup Tony’s jaw and dips his tongue into his mouth.
“Homeland Security,” announced one of the three sari ladies, flowers tumbling over her shoulder. “Sorry, kid, this one’s ours.”
“I’ve got some spare uniforms in the closet,” Tony says when he catches Steve glancing at the shower. He still has salt dried around his jaw and temples; he must be sticky as hell.
When he sensed Steve watching, he turned and asked, “Really, a roommate? What, did Thor take an ad out on Craigslist or something? Why didn’t he just ask me to arrange a place?”
“No,” Steve replied abruptly, then more calmly. “No assembling; we keep this between us. Need-to-know only.”
“I won’t take you to the king,” he said miserably. "This began with a bit of armor, but damned if I will traffic in human life.”
It’s likely just meant to be one of Tony’s off-hand jokes, but Steve winces anyway. He remembers the disquiet on Tony’s face when he ripped that log apart with his bare hands; it’s not his proudest moment. Sure, he’d been jumpy and unmoored, but that wasn’t anyone’s problem but his own.
Stepping out of the elevator, Steve scratched nervously at the back of his neck. The living room was empty, but bright with natural light, and immaculate from a recent visit by the maintenance staff. Couch cushions were rearranged tastefully, coasters replaced in their holder, and on the coffee table was a neatly folded copy of the Times.
“Only if Tony finds out,” Natasha said, which Steve gratefully followed up with, “Which is why I need to find my wallet before someone else does!”
The bartender steadied his own pistol and shrugged. “Sir, I am a private, tax-paying
Steve watched Bruce scratch his head. “Well, he and the ham kinda disagreed before.”
Ah. Steve’s breath caught when Tony’s lips touched him, and he closed his eyes, savoring their proximity, the stubble scratching his mouth. Instinctively, he bought one hand up to caress the side of Tony’s cheek. It was a chaste kiss by any standards, but it was happening. At long last, it was happening.
“Thanks,” Steve rasps. He picks his way to the bathroom and immediately peels the infirmary gown off without bothering to close the door. Tony can hear him puttering around, gathering soap or whatever. It’s better there, somewhat, because Tony hasn’t filled the bathroom to capacity with his stuff. The shower stall is actually big enough for at least two people, provided those two people weren’t both supersized and didn’t mind cramped quarters.
He stood and clasped Tony’s shoulder. “Because I’m a weird old man, remember? Let me live.”
, he tries to reason with himself. Surely, there are more important things to be done. Yet all that could be done was already underway. There’s nothing that can be particularly improved with Tony’s personal attention, and, honestly…
Still, he glanced dryly at Sharon and asked, “Is this where you encourage me to confess my feelings?”
“Done,” Tony echoed. He flashed Steve a thumbs up. “Mission accomplished?”
“Don’t,” Tony interrupts, features curling into familiar lines of vexation. “...don’t say it gets better.”
“Sounds a bit like I’m doing all the work,” Steve had said.
“Your wallet,” Sam echoed. “Slow crime day, if the Avengers are assembling for a wallet.”
Tony doesn’t reply immediately, but there’s a susurrus of shifting blankets. Steve doesn’t have to look to his side to know they’re both awake now.
Nobody expects the explosion when they hear it.
Steve laughed softly and triumphantly waved his wallet. Tony made an ironic gesture of applause. “Great job, detective Capslock. Guess life goes back to normal now.”
“Trust me,” Anthony insisted. He pressed his forehead to Steve’s, breath hot on his lips. “Trust me."
The poison was terrible, and Steve felt it burn through his whole body and bones until darkness consumed him. But behold, when he came to, he found that he had grown larger, and that great strength suffused his limbs. He could see and hear better than he ever had.
Tony grinned. “Oh, just my thing,”
According to Maria, they nearly didn’t spot him in the water. The waves in the Pacific being what they were, the body blended in with the blue gray waters so it was only through sheer dumb luck that a scout on the fringes of the maintenance vessel spotted something weird and called it in. Radar identified the bogey as human, which was strange because the helicarrier and maintenance vessel staff were all accounted for.
Steve shouldn’t be as surprised as he is. He remembers Clint watching him and Tony by the woodpile today. He knows he hadn’t exactly kept it together.
“My friend from work, whom you know as the Incredible Hulk,” Thor pointed at Bruce first, then he jabbed his finger at the screen. “and that is our fearless leader, Captain America. Steve Rogers, meet my roommate, Daryl. D, Steve Rogers.”
Captain America didn’t panic. Serum-enhanced national treasures usually didn’t, and good for them because Steve Rogers
Steve hardly cares. “I’ll be more offended if you don’t save your strength,” he says. “Please, Tony, I need you to stay with me. Help’s on the way.”
“I was scared,” he confesses, just loud enough for Tony to hear him over the shower. “I thought I was ok with the way things are between us, but when the Celestial landed and I realized I didn’t know where you were, I couldn’t think. About anything except for what happened last time an alien landed and we weren’t together.”
They’re at the infirmary now. Tony sees medics buzzing around a bed, but nobody seems particularly panicked.
Steve homes in on a smear of red behind the gritty haze. The distinct shape of Tony’s armor is hard to miss, yet disquiet paws at tentative relief, then stifles it completely upon getting up close.
He’s getting deja vu from a dinner plate.
“I lost my wallet,” Steve admitted.
Steve examines the red and gold sheath, identifying what might be dead weight. He asks JARVIS if some extra paneling is safe to take off, so Tony might feel a little lighter…
Tony gave him a once over and commented, “I take it dinner was good?”
“How…” Daryl wet his lips. “How does he know that?”
Tony blinks at that, comically slow, like Steve’s behavior is irrational. “Then, I wouldn’t have…” he tries to raise his arm again and fails. “…wouldn’t’ve felt you.”
“Clint.” Steve rolled his eyes and plopped into his own chair. The uniform fabric squeaked and strained, but valiantly held together. “I said I was sorry.”
Steve tapped his fingers on the Starkpad. “My wallet is still missing, so no.”
Sam Wilson’s speech to the world at large is muffled over the speakers in the small hours of the morning. Tony knows it by heart by now, but he still likes to hear it spoken whenever he needs a bit of help to face the day.
After Iron Man and his little helpers finished their final sweep of the office building in Midtown, Steve had decided, he was going to haul his boyfriend home and right back into bed.
Clint made a face. “I didn’t say that.”
“Why?”
“Tony, no.” Steve shook his head. “I don’t want a new wallet, I’m going to find my old one.”
. Yet they’re marked for extinction by Tony’s efforts, crippled by their own worst fears, and Steve wonders if they were always meant to implode.
“Oh jeez, still?” Steve asked in a voice that might have been called a whine if someone who was not him were describing it.
Steve exhales shakily, once, twice before turning in the tight circle of Tony’s arms and embracing him back. Tony can feel the muscles in his arms twitch as Steve tests and tempers his strength, but in the end, they’re pressed together and it feels like everything is in place.
A Steve predicted, Schmidt bade Anthony come before the throne less than a fortnight later.
Steve heard the king and was consumed with dread. He wept bitterly, feeling betrayed, but Sam stood by him. “I told you not to take the mask,” he said. “But do not give way to fear, Steve, or the worst will be yet to come. I shall help you fulfill your task.”
Anthony’s mansion at the edge of the kingdom was not made of gold, but of brick and stone like all others. However, it shone bright as day even in the night. It was well known among the local populace that Anthony helped all who came to him in need, and it was no different when Steve stumbled up to the mansion with his paltry belongings and begged him for shelter for the night.
Was it? Steve thought about his evening, and bristled at the implication of four intelligence agencies blindly converging on one throwaway henchman and tipping off actual high profile targets in a hundred mile radius.
Steve doesn’t dignify that with a response. He meets Tony’s eyes, kisses his palm one more time and informs him, “ETA 1 minute. We’ll get you out of here, then I’m going after this bastard myself.”
“Well, wouldn’t that be something,” Tony replied casually.
Sharon smirked, hand on her gun and eyes on the Thumb, who was now snarling at the news. “Actually, I can appreciate you being cautious,” she said. “But, Steve. Neighborino. You’d better not be holding back because you already made Stark’s decision for him.”
His shirt came off first, revealing a tanned torso, one definitely more cut and powerful than it looked under his clothes. Steve understood this because he was an artist, of course, with an eye for form and mass, although that didn’t explain his sudden, perverse curiosity as to whether Tony would be wearing underwear once he shuffled out of his yoga pants.
It's light, so much light, riotously at odds with the scarlet darkness in his head.
Steve stills, blinks the ceiling for a moment. “I don’t…I don’t have a preference.”
Sam wiggled his toes and squinted at the sun from behind his sunglasses. “More missing persons?” he asked. “This guy got a metal arm and an attitude, too?”
“Condoms!” suggested Thor. The coins jumped when he smacked his fist on the table. “A loyalty card for the bar of blow drys? Or a snack of cheese and savory ham!”
“Sorry,” Steve said soothingly. “but stuff in my pocket’s off limits, ok? Promise, and I’ll bring you some nice original transistors next time.”
“Tony?” he asks breathlessly.
“I like sleeping on the right, but I’m not married to it,” Tony says, blearily peeking out from under the quilt. “If you got a compelling argument, I can be persuaded.”
Steve raised his brow pointedly, only to catch Sharon staring back at him baffled. “What the actual hell, Rogers?”
“Should have known something was up,” Tony says. “He’s too smart…to just keep a fuckin’ list of bombs on his hard drive.”
Of course. Steve closed his eyes and cursed inwardly. So much for a satisfying night.
She shrugged. “And you can’t commandeer SHIELD resources for stuff you just misplaced.”
The Avengers had been a team for the better part of two years, yet Steve could only count a handful of times he’d seen Tony completely relaxed. The man had a sixth sense for being observed, and he could go from zero to PR masterpiece in no time at all, so it was a rare thing to catch him in ‘off-mode’.
Nevertheless, life went on and villainy persisted. The rest of the team trickled in slowly, each of them orbiting closer and closer to the Tower until one fine day, the Avengers once again manifested like destiny.
Steve huffs, but falls into a thoughtful silence. He drops his gaze and follows the curves of daisy petals on the bedspread. It only feels like he’s spent a lot of time being disappointed, but the truth is, the last year has been better than he can ever remember. Before that, he’d had a job and a routine in DC, but he could never shake the notion that he was there because he had nowhere else to go. But New York, Avengers Tower, Tony⸺ despite everything, it's like he’s finally arrived. These people, this team, it could only belong to the man who came out of the ice, not the one who went into it.
“I guess you updated the controls since we were last on one of these?”
Eventually, he and Steve made a home for themselves by each other’s side, and the kingdom flourished under the just Captain and the clever knight whose armor shone like the feathers of a firebird.
“Batshit?!” Steve protested, surreptitiously reaching under the table for his shield.
Steve slips out of his shoes and socks and slides into the vacant spot as lightly as he can manage. The sheets are cool under his back and the natural white noise of the countryside is more pleasant than either the noise of the city or the airtight calm of soundproofed rooms. Still, it turns out getting in bed is the easy part, and sleep is far more elusive. It doesn’t take long for his terribly unsubtle tossing and turning to wake his bunkmate.
Schmidt agreed and summoned his soldiers. Steven felt his heart break, but he did not falter. His own life meant nothing in the face of doing what was right, yet, even as the king’s soldiers forced him to his knees and held his jaw open, Steven sought Anthony’s eyes for the last time. They were not as pitiless as they were moments ago; Anthony still looked upon him with sadness and love. He tipped the vial into Steven’s mouth, saying without speaking,
'Negative,’ replied the AI.
“It’s fine,” he replies, with a smile that fools neither of them. “Let’s get some sleep.”
Anthony pressed a kiss to his ear. “Then, that is what you shall have.”
When, after DC, Steve moved into Stark Tower, he found that Tony had already heard from Natasha. Tony’s seen the leaked files, analyzed them, and even set up a series of missions for Iron Man to go and nullify any use of Stark tech by organizations in HYDRA’s network. Steve picked up missions of his own to help with the backlog and to look for Bucky, and in doing them, he dwelled less on the magnitude of what he’d lost.
Steve stared at his friend in disbelief as Tony swallowed the bait and whirled the other way with an indignant, “Wilson, you know that’s not how it works!”
Steve wipes water from his eyes and slicks his hair back, but otherwise doesn’t move.
Steve startled. “What? Why would I⸺” he began, then remembered the night in the elevator. Ok, yes, he could see how that might have been misconstrued. He hurriedly shook his head and said, “No, Tony, that was something else. Something we need to talk about, sure, but it has nothing to do with me leaving the Avengers for Agent 13.”
However, Anthony would not hear of it. He spoke to Steve affectionately, saying, “Your courage is one of a kind, Steve, and the hours you have spent in my company have filled me with love for you. So, take me to your king. I will secure your freedom.”
“Uh-huh,” Tony said. “But let’s get back to the part where you like me...and want to raise the Avengers with me?”
Ok, the metaphor had definitely gone too far. Even Bruce was making his experiment-failed face, but before Steve could change the subject to something less stressful, Daryl stared fiercely into the webcam.
In a way, Steve knows exactly what compels him to do what he does next; he’s been looking at it all day without really seeing. The solution to the Maximoff problem has always been in sheer physicality, and if, as leader, Steve’s job is to make things easy for his team, then Tony is as entitled to his efforts as anyone.
this is why Steve was a master tactician.
"Do this, and your village shall be rewarded,” Schmidt said, with a terrible grin. “Otherwise, all of Brooklyn shall be razed.”
“The agents…?”
Before Steve could rattle off all his disappointments, however, somebody called out from the middle of the set. “We’re ready for you, Mr. America.”
Tony sighs, flecks of blood on his breath. “I must be a sight, huh?” he slurs. “Very…St. Sebastian.”
“Shower on,” Tony deadpans back, and a spray of water immediately descends from the showerhead. “I start with 112 degrees and go from there.”
Steve felt his lips pull into a stupid grin again, like this thought would forever fill him with joy. ‘Raise the Avengers’, god, did Tony have a way with words.
voices, he was pretty sure, but Tony’s had been the strongest, the clearest, the loudest, ever-present. Tony grounded him and brought him back.
Bucky asked, and while both Avengers knew that he was talking to Steve, that didn't stop them. Tony undid the mute on Clint's comm upon the archer's request.
know?" Steve asked, helping the shorter man get the armor off of him. "I mean... other than me, now."
The other man’s response had Steve stopping dead in his tracks. He turned his gaze on the man, twin blue flames watching him with a hatred he hadn’t felt in ages. “I don’t need your help
crashing…”
time you decide to drop by, we can see exactly what it's like to have two Captain Americas and two Iron Mans in one bed." Stark gave him a predatory smirk, and Tony had to admit, he'd never really thought about trans-dimensional intercourse before, but it might be fun. Sure, he'd have to talk Steve into it, but...
working in the lab, I'm just showing Steve some of the stuff that I
"Uh, Tony? I know this is weird, but this whole place is strange. I can assure you, I'm still me, though. Like Clint, he's still him even though he... looks like a bird," Steve murmured. His arms were still roped behind his back, so Tony got up to undo those. God was Steve gorgeous. Being a centaur, he didn't exactly have a shirt on at the moment, and Tony was definitely not complaining. He leaned up, trying to get the ropes.
Yes, they’d been willing to do whatever it took to right the wrong Thanos had done five years back, but that didn’t mean that he wasn’t ready to keep that same promise to do everything in his power to make sure they get their happy endings, too. After all, he promised. Whatever it takes. Not every ending needs to end in tears, not every ending needs to end in bittersweet heartache. Not every ending needs to end in death.
"So," the unknown guy said as they headed towards the kitchen. This place was so different than his own tower! "...Cap's in your world, and so is Hawkeye, but... I don't exist?"
He was staring into the eyes of a
"I'm sorry," Steve mumbled, a light blush crossing his face. They'd had a light conversation going on since the beginning, though it had died down a bit. "I don't really know what to say... other than thank you, for going out with me tonight."
, our team will probably want to know the good news, right? That’s not something I should just hide from them, right?”
And then she was gone, nearly giving Steve a heart attack because she was just back and then gone again already.

to do something,
. He couldn’t do a thing to help his teammate, his friend, his… his crush. Nothing.
“I’m going to see if I can get him calmed down,” Bruce said, going through the medial drawers, no doubt looking for a tranquilizer or something. “The stress can’t be good, and if the system
He looked so earnest, and there was a hint of that sorrow still in his features, like he'd thought about what would've happened had Tony taken the full blast.
And then Bucky was hovering in front of them, tiny arms crossed. "We're leaving.
This time, the swirling colors didn't spin him around in circles, or drop him through the air for him to apparently land on a car. This time, he ended up right there in the lab, with Clint beside him and Bruce a few steps away. The other scientist raced over to make sure that Tony was okay. Natasha stayed at the controls, shutting the machine down when Bruce told her to.
"Getting stuck to you doesn't sound that bad," Steve chuckled, pressing a kiss to the top of his head. Quietly, with a gentle fondness that Tony had gotten so used to hearing over the years that he'd been with Steve, "We're gonna get through this, Tony, just as we always do. I promise—have I ever lied to you before?"
It wasn't until the invisible light started swirling, looking more like a large colorful doorway, when Tony knew that his team was here for him.
pretty wonderful," Steve murmured, leaning down to steal a quick kiss from Tony. "Though I have to say, it's been
“Stark,” Barnes called in greeting, and he looked like he was already laughing just at the sight of him walking over. Great, Barton or Banner had already told them, and Tony was right to suspect how they might react.
“Steve?” Tony whispered, and he turned his attention to those beautiful brown eyes, watching the little flecks of gold as the medical room light made those flecks glow. “I love you. I know you love me. You don’t have to worry.”
"Sir is in his lab," Jarvis replied.
"I've been laughed at for two days now," Bucky muttered. "I know, I'm a tiny little faerie. I get it."
"You're just jealous," Steve chuckled, wrapping an arm around Tony's waist, pulling the genius a little closer so he could rest his head against Steve's shoulder.
"Call S.H.I.E.L.D.," Tony told Steve, who looked like he wanted to argue. He looked back and forth between Tony and Bucky for a second before he nodded and walked a few steps away to alert S.H.I.E.L.D. to come pick up the weapons. Turning his attention to Bucky, Tony crossed his arms. "A gunshot wound is a gunshot wound, Buck. Both you and Clint are getting locked in medical for a while. Now quit covering it—let me see how bad it is."
looking for you to actually get you back to the tower. I don't think that's fair, not with how many times I've managed to track you down."
"No," Tony sighed, wishing that Steve would just fall asleep again.
As if to prove a point, Steve leaned over and gave Tony a quick kiss, a warm, knowing smile on his face. He wanted Clint and Bucky to be happy too. Everyone did.
It wasn't until the fuse blew and the portal shut down when Clint was able to stand up and hobble over into the main room to figure out what had just happened.
last night?
close to them, making sure not to actually hurt anyone. “Outta my way. If you even
Because of this, that kept the three superheroes confined to just being in the plane, seeing as Iron Man's flight was nearly completely knocked out. When the hole had been blasted in the side of the plane, that's when Steve knew they'd lost control of the situation.
“That’s not how this works,” Skull tried speaking up, but Steve cut him off.
"I'll just need to finish hooking up the power," Tony said, handing Clint a bottle that he must've picked up at some point in time. The archer looked around when he heard a noise, and it took him a few moments to figure out that someone was knocking on the door. He walked over, looking back and forth between the glass in his left hand and the bottle in his right hand before he managed to open the door.
"He told me about the elderly people that you were saving," Iron Man said. Just having the other man there made him feel calm. It felt like he knew Iron Man more than he really did, which always made Steve relax after a particularly rough battle. He really liked the friendship he'd built with the man. "He seemed happy to me—did
you.”
Tony was barely able to murmur his thanks when Bucky stood up and started grabbing some mugs.
“It’s nothing,” he murmured, smiling at her. “They’ve just been a bit more frequent lately, that’s all. “Ever since I… I took the plane down.”
Bucky replied. Tony smirked a little at how grumpy he sounded, though he could imagine the look on his face. He always got this
"Tony, you need to get out of here too," Steve insisted, trying to usher him towards the door. He shook his head, and went to try to help some people who were having trouble getting out without being trampled or hurt.
Tony barely even glanced over at Bruce when he walked into the room. After doing his routine check of the machines, he wandered over and knelt down beside Tony.
," Tony growled, shooting a few warning blasts of energy at the men, who seemed to realize that, being a sorcerer, Tony would be able to take them all down pretty quickly. One of them tried charging at Tony, but he blasted the man right off his horse. The rest of them seemed to get the picture and ran off pretty quickly.
The biggest issue was when everyone was busy. Everything just… stopped for a second. There were green numbers—ones and zeroes—that were all over

the laser gunshot weapons that Hydra used, the ones that could cause burning and sometimes deadly wounds. No, those were just normal guns being fired. Glancing over at the commotion, he saw a group of the townspeople shooting at both Hydra and the two super-soldiers, who looked a bit shocked that they were being attacked, too.
He didn't like the thought of that.
“How about this—I’ll bring some food up here for you, okay? Then you don’t have to leave just yet. But once you’re done eating, you
Clint added, and Bucky sighed.
you? Why did he...?" Tony whispered, and Steve could tell by his breathing alone that the man was full-on panicking.
“Clint, I need you to tell Tony something that only the two of you know, okay? Whatever you can think of, but make sure that no one else knows about it,” Steve said, keeping a hand on Tony’s shoulder. “Okay? The aliens were using our faces to hurt him.”
"I'm sure they appreciated it in their own way, just not... to our faces," Tony laughed. He hated to admit the fact that he definitely wasn't walking as fast as normal, and they weren't going to be talking as far as they may have before, but it was true. Despite still being a super-soldier, Tony had noticed that Steve had slowed down, too—whether it was because he was tired or because he noticed that Tony was slowing down, he couldn't be sure.
“Back off,” Steve growled, pointing the sword at the man as he slowly backed up towards Tony. “Come on, we’re getting out of here. This is
"I don't understand what you mean by that," Steve said after a moment. "I love you, Tony. Can't I have both of you in my life? Isn't that why we've been searching for him?"
"I know, Stevie," Bucky murmured, and Steve's heart swelled. Bucky used to call him 'Stevie' back in the forties.

In that moment, Steve really thought that he was going to die.
"I'm not leaving," Steve whispered, kissing him again. "Why would you think that?"
“Of course I do,” Peggy replied. “Sometimes I just worry about you… after all, what if… what if something bad happens?”
"If something happens, I want you to lock me up right away," Bucky said. He hadn't once looked over at Tony yet, and he wondered if he was ever going to. The man had barely looked at

feeling must’ve come from the thought of having to leave his family.
“What aren’t you ready for?” Bruce asked, tilting his head to the side. “We’ve double-checked everything with the event planners, everything is exactly the way that you ordered it. Everything’s running on time for once, which is enough of a surprise. We’ve got S.H.I.E.L.D. as backup both here on guard and out there in case anything goes wrong—they’ll handle everything unless the world is about to end and we

"Of course," Bruce said right away, sounding surprised, like the thought of
“Hello?” he tried calling out, but not even his voice echoed back to him.

him, they found out very quickly that ‘forcing him’ to do anything wasn’t going to happen. “I’m too busy with the family to go to war right now. You guys need me more than they do.”
It wasn't until Steve got back from the mission he'd been on that day and collapsed down onto their bed when Tony began to worry. Steve held him close, telling him what had happened while he broke down. He let his boyfriend talk about his past, and the man he once thought to be dead, before he finally passed out. Tony rubbed his back and stayed snuggled up in his boyfriend's arms, barely able to sleep that night.
"I like fixing things," Tony said, trying to concentrate on the busted arm and not on Bucky's face. "Your arm is broken, I want to fix it. What's so difficult to understand?"
"Hawkeye... Clint," Steve said, surprised when he was met with a blank stare. "Black Widow, Natasha. Thor. None of them?"
"I know that Tony has a bit of a history with being a playboy, but... I don't see him as someone who would cheat on me, or anyone," Steve said, noticing that the rest of the team was leaving Fury's office. He and Iron Man had talked with him earlier, and they were just waiting for the 'all clear' to go home. "He's so loyal, and brave and caring, even if he tries to deny it. He's such a brilliant man, and I just... I really care about him, more than I'd been expecting. I'm really glad he gave me a chance."
Tony groaned as he got to work on wrapping up his wounds. At least these aliens weren’t complete savages. After every beating session where they tortured him for information, they made sure to leave him some bandage wraps and a needle with medical stitching so that he could fix himself up.

“I know I probably shouldn’t have been talking with Cheryl anymore about that kid who’s looking for a foster family and hopefully a forever one, too, but… I couldn’t help it, Steve,” Tony whispered, gently squeezing his hand. His fingers had been twitching earlier, and he wasn’t quite sure if that was a good sign or a bad sign.
“I’m sorry,” Tony whispered, but he couldn’t even bring himself to hold Steve’s hand anymore. It didn’t
And Bruce! Bruce was nearly always the Hulk in this world. This Hulk could actually speak in complete sentences, and he was pretty intelligent. The Hulk of Tony's world was smart, he knew that, but he was basically just a rage monster.
hated the way that he looked, why didn't Steve? Plus, if he'd asked for a separate room, then he would've seen the hurt look on his husband's face that would've meant that Steve was blaming himself for that.
"Tony, you skipped the debrief," Bruce said calmly, though there was an angry tone in his voice. Oh yeah, they'd be talking later. "You know you're not supposed to just leave."
He knew that he was supposed to be 'worrying less' and all, but Tony wasn't able to stop worrying until the battle was over and all four Avengers were heading back to the tower, no worse for wear. In fact, because it hadn't been
Clint was. He knew that they were friends, and the archer was the greatest drinking buddy that he ever had, but he never really thought that Clint cared much more than that. "Where's Steve?"
"Ready," he murmured, catching's the suit's arm long enough for Steve to press a kiss to the forehead of his helmet. "Don't get hurt. You're not allowed to play matchmaker and then go off and get hurt, because I plan on taking you out once we get back to the tower."
"Cap," Iron Man managed, and Steve turned his attention back to the battle, ricocheting his shield off the wall to knock an agent off of Iron Man. He knew that the armored Avenger was struggling when it came to close combat, since he was so used to being able to do aerial strikes and maneuvers. Inside the plane was causing him to struggle some.
Steve had mentioned that he hadn’t told anyone yet, so it would definitely be a surprise.
Two nights ago he thought his team had showed up to save him. Two days ago, they’d broken him out of his jail cell, and he’d been so happy. His family was there to save him.

hurt, but we’ll… we’ll fix them. I promise.”
"I thought you already knew this, I'm a genius," Tony said, chuckling. "You just needed a bit of a rewiring—sure, the outside of it still looks like shit, but it shouldn't be hurting anymore, right?"
of them? Who's on your team?"
The genius just stared at him blankly. That was the look that he got when he was trying to process something that he didn’t quite understand, and Steve knew to be patient with him. Instead of saying anything, Tony chose to just hug him tightly again.
He grinned and stepped forward, waiting to see if it would stabilize or fail and suck them all into another dimension. After a few seconds, it seemed to stabilize, as a shape appeared.
Still, Steve found his feet moving before he was able to rationalize that he

“What do you know?” Tony muttered, pressing his face further into the chair. “It’s not like you have a better solution.”
much but really couldn't stand at the moment.
But then one of the Hydra agents shot at him.
The entire time that Tony was searching, all he could feel was guilt.
Before Natasha was able to reach for the space stone, Steve stopped her. “I need to take that one back, and the reality one too since I’ve also got to drop off the hammer.” He smiled at her, so glad to see her alive when they were all so sure they’d never get to see her again. “You already helped me return the soul stone, Tasha, just take that one if you’re going to take any of them. Just…” He looked them both in the eye, wanting them to know he was serious. “Just be careful, I want to see you guys when I get back. Okay? Can you promise me that?”
in love with him! How was he supposed to get him to fall in love with him again if he wasn’t even in love with him now? Tony was so in love with his super-soldiers that he was
“Nothing,” he said quickly. He went back to gently rocking his daughter, whispering about how much he loved her. But when he gently carded his fingers through her hair… for a second, it looked like her hair fell right through his fingers—
"I've known since before the Avengers," Natasha said. "I've known you for a long time now, Tony. That wasn't going to get past me. I'm surprised it took Steve so long, with all of the time he spends with you. If anyone would've noticed earlier—"
Steve, like nothing else mattered and they were the only two people in the world. "Now, Clint dragged Bucky out of here for a very specific reason. Jarvis, lock the lab down! We need some privacy here." As Jarvis started shutting down the lab and blacking out the windows, Tony pulled away from Steve long enough to add, "And make a note, J—Mommy and Daddy are taking the kids out to dinner tonight, can't forget about that!"
Tony whined and nuzzled against him again.
. The feathers started about at his hips, completely coating his legs, There were a couple of long feathers that looked to be almost like a tail. Clint's arms were covered in feathers too, and looked kind of like wings. Tony shook his head, trying to clear his vision.
"Aww," Clint said, leaning forward to

"I've been getting everything ready in the medical wing in case anyone needs help, and yet you guys don't even tell me when you get back to the tower," Bruce said, dropping the huge first-aid kit onto the couch.
"Thanks for pulling me out of the ocean," Steve said, leading his teammates over to the portal.
It was so dark outside—the sun had sunk below the trees by now—and Steve just assumed that the werewolf had some sort of night vision as he didn’t trip at all. A couple of times he started snarling, and Steve wondered if it was at him or if there were other beasts in the forest that he was warning.

Work seemed to go by in a blur. He couldn’t really concentrate all that much, and he didn’t remember most of what those generals and government agents were talking to him about. The only good thing about the day up until he left was the fact that there was a taste of blueberries on his lips, and… why did he like blueberries so much? It was familiar.
," Bucky murmured, not letting go of Tony.
"You never got to tell me what the latest thing you were working on was," Steve said, leading him over towards the elevator to the lab. How in the world did he get lucky enough to have such an incredible husband?
," stupid drugs, making him too honest, "I'm real glad you did... 'cause I really like you, Steve, and I still can't believe you like me, too."
“You weren’t complaining last night,” Steve said as Tony crawled into bed beside him. Wrapping his arms around the shorter man, Steve curled around him like a safety blanket. Just having him there made Tony feel so much better. His fiancé’s warmth just made all of his lingering doubts melt away.
"Well, there's that too," Bruce said, tugging Tony closer to hug him. "Never think you're not good enough for this team, Tony, because we'd be nothing without you."
"And she hasn't treated you differently," Steve pointed out.
"I wanted to hear if Bucky's going to finally admit how much of a crush he's got on you or not," Tony said, making sure that Clint was completely steady so that he wouldn't be having to catch him if he fell from the tree.
Tony laughed as he flew over towards where he was going to meet up with Steve and Bucky. He listened as Bucky tried to explain that he was only saying that 'cause he was worried, not because he didn't think Clint was able to handle himself. He could hear Clint laughing away at Bucky's distress.
Bucky snorted. "You may be old right now, but you're not out of shape, Tony. I actually
“The team called S.H.I.E.L.D. and sent them to that town,” Tony said quickly. “That’s what Bruce said. They’re going to… stop that from happening again.” Tony grinned. “I never got to say thank you—if you weren’t there, they would’ve killed me. I didn’t even realize what they were doing until that guy almost stabbed me!”
the orange, red and yellow stones said, filling Steve’s vision with such brilliant colors, brighter than any star he’d ever seen. The warmth of the colors was like heat under his skin, starting at his fingertips and running up his left arm.
"Good," Steve murmured, handing the both of them some towels so they weren't eating grease and oil. "I was a bit worried... that you two wouldn't be able to be in the same room together."
"See you soon," Steve murmured, stepping close to Tony. The genius had installed a bit on the boots of his suit for when they did their hug-and-fly routine. It was such an easy way to be able to fly, freeing up Tony's hands while Steve held tightly to the suit, giving him a good footing so that he didn't slip. He shut off his earpiece, hoping that Tony would do the same so they could talk.

"He's going to be fine," Bruce assured him, and Steve nodded.
Tony’s grin was large, but it was faker than the ones he used for the media. Maybe he’d convince Steve to move over to Malibu for a while, so they could enjoy some time as fiancés for a while and wait to see if Steve would regret proposing.
"But?" Steve prompted, giving him that look of

It was
The children were screaming just as loud as she was, grabbing at him and trying to pull him back, to put him back under their spell, as the numbers started covering everything and slowly rotting it all away. He couldn’t close his eyes, he couldn’t get away from the horror that he had to witness as the entire world fell to nothing but an endless sea of black.
"I grew up with stories about you... the great Captain America," Tony continued, his smile never wavering. "You were my hero growing up. I tried so hard to hate you when Howard used to remind me about how I'd never be as great as you, about how much of a failure I was... but I still couldn't hate you, because
Tony turned to look at him, a dopey grin on his face as he giggled, "He's so amazing, Clint, I'm the luckiest man in the entire world. I just... I just love him so much."
Everyone startled at the voice coming from the far side of the jacuzzi. Iron Man hovered into view and the faceplate flipped up, so Tony stared back at them in open curiosity. He eyed the nearly empty box of donuts on the hot tub rim, the pitcher of sangria tucked into an insulated floating drinks holder, and finally at the three Avengers. Steve suddenly became hyper-aware of his splayed posture, but naked except for swimshorts and his favorite neck floatie didn’t exactly lend an air of professionalism.
Tony made a strange noise. “Admire me?”
“This began with me wanting the king’s favor. I no longer care for more things,” Steve kissed Anthony’s arm wound about his neck. “I only want to protect those I love.”
“Actually, even if I were an immortal, I reckon I wouldn’t wait,” he said, then steamrolled on because yeah, fuck superheroes. “Look, it sounds like you’re pretty attached to this...ham, and yeah, you might find another ham at the market tomorrow, but it won’t be the same as this one, will it? I guess what ‘m sayin’ is: life goes on, but you don’t find a good ham everyday. So, best get your act together before someone else takes this one; isn’t Captain America s’posed to be brave and what not?”
It looked more like a doorframe than anything, but Tony had designed it, so of course it was going to work. Clint just wanted to see it in action.
, Tony."
And then the door closed, leaving Tony to ponder what was so wrong with the thought of someone marrying him. Were they pretending when they first congratulated him and Steve about the fact that they were dating, three years ago? Or did they just think that dating was one thing since it wasn’t technically permanent?
"Perfect," Bruce said, and for once he actually looked very proud of what he'd created. Normally when Tony tried to get him to be proud of his creations, he was always a bit hesitant. But right now, with the amount of coffee and the lack of sleep, he actually looked proud that he'd figured it out. Tony knew he could do it.
. Knowing that by him rejecting Bucky was making it harder for him to be a part of the team, it hurt a little.
with him than he did with others. It made him feel like he had a chance.
"Come on. If you're anything like me, 'talking about your feelings' isn't something that you're going to want to do, but even I can tell that you need to talk right now, so..." Stark said, taking his hand before leading him over to the 'living room' area. Rogers stayed at his side, offering him quiet comfort. Just having him there was enough for Tony—he looked
"Clint," Bucky gasped, and before Tony was able to stop him, the tiny faerie shot out of the bushes and into the fray.
it. Nobody wanted him, so I didn't tell anyone."
Before he was able to tell Steve not to turn around, his super-soldier was hugging him tightly and pressing a kiss to the top of his head.
"Hey Jarvis, where's Tony?" he asked. How long had it been since he'd cuddled up with Tony? He'd been gone for two nights now, and... Was he even in their room three nights ago? He couldn't remember...
"Sorry," he whispered, snuggling up against his super-soldier's warm chest. "Just thinking... Bucky needs the team just as much as I needed them... I want to be his friend, Steve."
"I... Yes, there's something that I need to tell you guys," Tony said, standing up a little straighter. He always seemed to do that when he was bracing himself for rejection. "I've kept my identity from you all for a long time... and I think I should probably tell you the truth."
. Now when he did it, it was just because he loved Tony and just loved holding him. He'd always loved holding him, but it had taken until now for him to realize that he needed to back off a little.
“You found me.”
Instead of going down to the lab, Tony started going through the new designs in the room, explaining them to Steve in as much detail as he would if the super-soldier was down in his lab with him.
"What does Steve have to do with broken tech?" Tony asked, turning his attention back to the wires so that he didn't accidently electrocute either of them. "The only connection this arm has to Steve is the fact that it's connected to you, and you're his..."
Steve gently rocked his youngest child, little Susan, back and forth. She’d fallen asleep in his arms. Peggy was reading a storybook to Mary and Michael on the other couch, while Steve was just sitting back to watch. Something had felt wrong since he’d woken up, and it was starting to drive him crazy.
All hope may not be lost for werewolf!Tony. Was the witch lying?
"We're going to be out late again tonight," Tony said as he took his seat beside Steve, leaning against his husband as he sipped his coffee. "Just so you guys don't panic again. Wouldn't want to forget to text again."
"Calm down," Bucky murmured, cutting off Steve's mad ramble. "I get it, you really like the guy. Me being here at the tower isn't going to hurt that, right?"
"He was
“I told them that they couldn’t just kill anyone who was cursed… they just need some time.” He smiled and petted the werewolf like he was an overgrown dog. It was getting harder and harder to concentrate with the drugs that were getting dripped into him via the IV. “We’ll help you with this, Tony, I promise…”
"You know, most people would think that's a

stressed, seeing as it couldn't be good for his health right now.
the team,
"Who are you? Where am I?" Tony asked, flinching when someone else put a hand on his shoulder. He jerked away, looking up with wide eyes at... Steve?
"You already said that," Steve chuckled. He had no clue how the super-soldier was able to stay so optimistic about this, but in a way he was glad because it was strangely calming to see Steve so calm and light-hearted about the situation. "I already talked with the team about what happened, and about how they shouldn't be acting like anything is different. I know this might be a little uncomfortable for a few days, but I can assure you—nothing's going to change, Tony."
, I swear—”
. In fact, he was a little surprised that he didn't feel Steve gripping his hand right now, because unless something was going on, that's where he should be. You know, unless he was out saving the day while Tony was in a drunken stupor or blowing himself up in the lab.
"Hey, I was shocked at the fact that I was suddenly
of it.”
Only... Steve's eyes were wide, and he looked absolutely terrified about the portal that was swirling just a few feet in front of them. Tony could only hear him for a split second as he shouted his name, the instant before the portal started pulling them both towards it with a lot more force than he'd been expecting.
"Are you hurt?" Steve demanded, trying to figure out how to get the suit open. "Tony, where are you hurt? You're pale—I need to get you somewhere fast—"
"We do this
Bucky made Tony stop watching the virtual simulation. In that world, Steve didn’t know that anything was any different. He believed that the world he was in was the real world, because of the way that the simulation was set up. It was like he’d never been frozen, he’d never met the Avengers…
After talking at the park for quite a while, they'd walked around the city and had eventually ended up going out to dinner. Steve had been right—it
at him about how he could walk and it wasn't that bad. "You know that they're wrong, right?"
A strong pulse of energy shot through the lab, knocking a very startled Clint backward. He couldn't quite see what was going on, not from where he was, but the way that the room lit up with swirling lights, something was definitely wrong. Clint grabbed onto a table leg when a strong force pulled towards the portal. He squeezed his eyes shut, not really understanding what was going on.
“Tony, you need to stand still,” Bruce chastised, shooting Clint a thankful look when he gripped Tony’s shoulders to hold him still. The Armored Avenger glared half-heartedly at his friends as he tried to take a couple of deep breaths. He mostly ignored the way that Bruce adjusted his clothes before taking a step back.
He'd been a bit worried that he'd only really connect with the Avengers, and their funder, Mr. Tony Stark, wouldn't want a thing to do with them, other than tote them around like trophies.
“What’s going on?” Steve whispered to one of the people standing near him.
, people.”
"I'll help him stress less," Steve murmured, taking ahold of his husband's hand. The statement confused Tony, but he liked holding Steve's hand, so he didn't complain.
tried to take over the world with his alien army, and Tony fought alongside Thor, another alien of Asgard.
Barely managing to listen to Iron Man's words, the two crashed down against the cold, unforgiving dirt, effectively knocking Steve out for several seconds.

"I know."
“I’m sorry I couldn’t give you the family that she could.” He must’ve said it so quietly that no one else heard it. The only reason Steve
"Maybe we can go somewhere far away, just the two of us, and enjoy some more time where people won't recognize us right away," he suggested, not wanting to hear that sadness in his husband's voice. Tony was finally starting to be comfortable in the body that he was in, and he didn't want him to be
Tony watched Clint's argument crumble before he could even make it, and he sighed dramatically. "
"Is that a no?" Steve asked, his face falling.
"It's not that," Steve insisted quickly. How was he supposed to explain this? "He just... he's a bit insecure. He thought that I was putting so much time into tracking you down because I was in love with you, and that I was just going to leave him... and I can't really blame him for thinking like that, because I haven't been spending much time with him, and I was actually just telling him earlier today that I was going to stop trying to drag you back to the tower because I was basically ignoring him, and—"
“Sorry, I couldn’t help it,” Steve replied, so glad to hear Tony’s teasing again. He would never grow tired of Tony’s teasing. “I know you said that you’ll be back, but I just… I need to make sure. I can’t lose you again.”
“You don’t have a choice,” Steve murmured, smiling when Tony pressed their foreheads together. “Whatever it takes, right?”
“Rest is important,” Bucky gently reminded Tony as he helped him out of the chair. The poor man didn’t look like he wanted to even stand up, let alone leave the room, but it was vital that he did. He needed to keep up with his health—if he sat around and didn’t sleep and drove himself crazy with worry, then he was just going to make himself sick.
"It's okay, darling, we're in bed," Steve murmured, nuzzling his nose against his boyfriend's neck. "Just relax and go back to sleep."
“But Papa,” his son, Michael, spoke up. “You can’t go!”
, he was… Bucky patted Tony’s shoulder before backing up and letting Bruce lead him out of the room. He turned his attention back to his friend, who still hadn’t moved an inch.
“Hey,” Steve shouted the moment that the elevator door opened. He grabbed Tony’s hand, nearly dragging him along to where the team was warming up. As it turned out, all four of them were there, though while Clint and Bucky seemed to be sparring, Natasha and Bruce seemed to be either stretching or doing yoga. But all four were there.
Tony almost didn’t want to tell anyone else. Clint, sure, that kind of made sense with the way that they joked around. Perhaps he was just joking around right now? But that didn’t explain Bruce’s reaction. That didn’t explain why the one person who

Instead, he came face to face with Steve. He tried a smile, because it was
“Tony knew you’d be back,” Clint said quietly. They all seemed to want to be able to touch him, to keep a hand on his back or shoulder, to know that he really was there. Steve was fine with it, too—he needed to know that this was real and his teammates really were here.
"I heard what they said," Tony replied, smirking a little when he watched Clint try to drag Bucky over to the S.H.I.E.L.D. jet. At some point in time Clint's leg must've been acting up, because Bucky lifted him up off the ground bridal style, and Tony didn't even need his earpiece in to hear Clint complaining
“I just had to make a deal with them,” he said, giving Schmidt a smirk that said
"Makes it better, I know. Believe me," Tony said, giving him a thumbs-up as his faceplate flipped back down into place. "Just stay out of trouble, birdbrain."

He turned to look at all of his friends. “Thank you, all of you. I just—I don’t want him to regret this, and I know I’ll never regret it, but I just…”
“If you hadn’t done that, I wouldn’t be here to do this,” Steve pointed out, wincing and groaning as he tried to move his arm.
you can always talk to me. I thought I made that clear
Tony nodded. Great, S.H.I.E.L.D. still had their hands on the only thing that could potentially make him younger again. It wasn't that he didn't trust them—no, that was pretty much it. He didn't trust S.H.I.E.L.D. to save his life, but he did trust his team to do that.
Natasha, too, looked like she hadn’t aged a moment past when Steve had last seen her, when they had originally gone on the time heist. Her hair still was dyed blonde on the ends, though Steve was so glad she’d let that fiery red grow back out. She hadn’t looked so full of hope as she had when they’d gone on the time heist, and just seeing that spark of life in her eyes made Steve want to cry all over again.
Steve decided to wait up, give his team a chance to get the portal open again so that he could get back to his own world. His double stayed up too, and they chatted about similarities and differences between their universes. The Captain also wanted to make sure that Steve wasn't thinking about just dumping his own Tony when he got back, and Steve assured him that he wasn't going to.
"I can talk with Steve about it," Tony said, smiling when Rogers patted his shoulder and followed after them.
"You're not a mistake, Tony. You're a good man—a
When Tony looked up at Steve’s face, he noticed the pained, angry look that had replaced the peaceful calmness of sleep.
“I heard you so many times… I thought I was going crazy, because I was hearing the voice of my husband telling me that he’d always love me, but I thought… I thought Peggy was my

"Point," Stark laughed.
not an
"Whenever you're ready... I can wait as long as it takes," Steve reassured him. After a moment he added, "You don't have to talk today—just tell me to back off and I will."
Tears filled Bucky's eyes, and before Tony knew that he was moving, he was already halfway across the room, holding tightly to the injured brunet as Bucky hugged him.
“It’s crashing, it has to be,” Tony said, gripping Steve’s hand tightly. Clint and Natasha both looked like they were in shock.
They stood in silence for a while before Tony glanced down at the suit. "I should check if the team's still okay—I've got some backup comms. in the suit." Opening a hidden section, Tony handed Steve an earpiece, which he promptly turned on. Tony got himself back into the suit. "Everyone okay?"
“I said that?” Steve asked—he’d
"I think it's more about Steve than you're willing to admit," Bucky said, and Tony couldn't help but look up at him, an eyebrow raised.
, wouldn’t it be very clear once Steve got back from his run?
"I was hoping that you were going to eventually tell us," Clint said. Steve began to wonder when everyone else was noticing and why
Tony wouldn’t attack him… well, the werewolf might, but it wouldn’t be Tony’s fault. He knew that his friend couldn’t control it, and he wouldn’t hold it against him if he did get hurt.
," Clint gasped, rolling his eyes. "I swear, Fury doesn't ever want us to leave." He looked back and forth between the two. "Did we just interrupt something?"
Ignoring him, Tony started disabling some of the more destructive stuff—after all, some of these were big laser canons and Chitauri-inspired tech. Hydra could do some real damage with it.
He quickly shook his head, watching as this world's Avengers started to gather. It wasn't that they made him uncomfortable, because if they were Avengers that meant that they were superheroes, the good guys, but he didn't know any of them, really.
Tony quickly nodded and let Bruce and Steve lead him down a couple more hallways. He had no idea how this ship worked, as every time he’d tried to escape, he just got beaten and tortured again. His teammates knew where they were going, they had to know, because Tony was putting all of his shaky trust in them.
"I'm going to do so much better Tony, you'll see," Steve whispered as Tony fell asleep, safe in the arms of the man that he loved.
“Clint stopped by on his way to get some gym clothes,” Natasha said, nodding. “Everyone’s heard, I’m just surprised that you’re still sharing the same thing. I thought at least you’d try to come up with something new by now.”
to be called in, but I don’t see that happening today.”
that they add a little flare to their suits. Tony’s tie was bright red with golden accent stripes, while Steve’s was a flashy blue with accent red and white stripes.
"You know," Steve murmured, gently tracing his fingers along the back of his neck, "I kind of like the white hair. Obviously it'll be a while before it comes back, but it looks good."
"Great," Steve said, grinning. "Coffee first."
Bucky gave him an apologetic look and handed him the open jar. "Sorry," he mumbled as he wandered over to his seat. When Tony put the jar away and brought his food back over to the table, Steve had a completely neutral look on his face, but judging by the way that Bucky was avoiding eye contact he
“You’re up early,” the other scientist commented, looking surprised as he hit the elevator button.
"Bruce... the Hulk," Steve said. He still felt awkward, because this wasn't his teammate Iron Man, even though he... kind of was. "I don't know anyone else."

Their close bond had started long before they started dating.

“Peggy?” he spoke up before he could stop himself. “W-where’s Bucky? He hasn’t been around since I’ve gotten back, but… he was… a few weeks ago, he was…”
"It... it worked?" Tony said, grinning. "I'm in another dimension? This is amazing!"

was because of his enhanced hearing. The slight, pained inhale from Bucky let him know that he’d heard it, too.
Iron Man's suit had been damaged while he was trying to keep Steve and Bucky safe—the S.H.I.E.L.D. weapons were far more dangerous than they'd been expecting, and if they'd been hit, there was no doubt that they'd have been seriously if not critically injured.
This time, it

, Tony had taken his suit off. He'd wanted to run over to Bucky so badly, but he just didn't want to get between them.
“I had a feeling that he wouldn’t have known,” Tony mumbled, looking back and forth between the two. “I can’t trust
here, but she’s never allowed to come back here. Never again. Understood?” There was a venom in her voice that told Steve that she was serious, that the townspeople held a big grudge against her. “So if you’re looking for her here, you’re looking in the wrong place.”
“Tony is… in the other room,” Bucky said, pausing to look out the door for a second. “He’s here at the tower—you found him, Steve.”
“And when you decide to wake up, I’m sure there will be more children—there’s always more children who need homes. There’s always going to be a family here for you,” Tony murmured, stroking his thumb across his husband’s cheek. “I love you, Steve. I’ll always love you.”
"Tony Stark... isn't the man people think of when they think of Iron Man," Tony said slowly, still looking cautious. He looked like he wanted to run off, so that he wouldn't have to face Steve. "The team... they wouldn't want me—"
“I’m sorry,” Natasha whispered, though she didn’t have to. Everyone was sorry that Steve was stuck in an unconscious state for what may have been the rest of his life, but it wasn’t like they caused it to happen.
“You were too late. It took you too many years to break out of my code, and when you wake up, you’ll find that you won’t ever get to see your precious Avengers again.”
"Bruce thought we should get you first... We're going for him next. I was far enough away that I didn't end up in another world..." Clint said, keeping an arm around Tony's shoulders as he turned to acknowledge the alternate versions of his friends. "Thanks for keeping him safe."
"Still in one piece," Steve groaned, rubbing his head. He was still alive, but that didn't mean that he wasn't in pain.
did that hurt. Squeezing his eyes closed, Steve waited for the inevitable impact that came with crashing into the ground. By now Steve was barely able to breathe, chest aching too much, when something solid crashed into him.
Steve gently squeezed Tony's hand before gesturing to the door. Tony hadn't actually said anything yet, and he knew that they'd need to have a long conversation about that. If Tony didn't want Bucky in the tower, then he wasn't going to stay. But if Tony didn't want him there... Steve wasn't going to leave his boyfriend. He wasn't lying when he said that he loved him, and he wasn't lying when he said that he needed to spend more time with him.
“I’ve got time and mind,” Tony said, grabbing the two stones before Steve was able to fight with either of them.
“Clint was watching him, a-and he was frowning so we turned the monitor on and…” Tony hurried after Bucky down the hallway. “I don’t know if there was something wrong with the screen or something but it looked like there was a-a

"I don't want you to... It happened, it's gone, and I've got to learn how to get past... everything. I can't have Howard like a devil on my shoulder for the rest of my life, telling me that I'm not worth anything..." Tony sighed, leaning back against Steve's chest when the super-soldier pulled his lover into his arms. "I
With Steve hugging tightly to his back, Tony hit the button and shot out into the icy cold winter air. Only, he was insulated with the suit, and Steve wasn't.
“This is bullshit,” Steve murmured, surprising Tony when he lifted his chin to give him a passionate kiss before he grabbed his wrist and started leading him back over to the elevator.
"Well, I'm exhausted," Tony said, moving towards the door. Steve caught his arm before he was able to walk by, gently pulling him down so that he could kiss him.
Steve paused at the door, once more having a strange feeling that there was something wrong. But no, what could be wrong today? Life was so absolutely

Until it came to that, though, he was going to enjoy every moment that he got with his team, and he was going to do anything he could to keep them safe.
"What happened?" was all that he was able to ask as he was surrounded, though it only took a few seconds to him to have space again as Bruce shooed everyone away, saying something about needing to check on him and Steve to make sure that everything's fine.

"I wanna show up late just to spite them," Tony muttered, looking back over to his projects. His fingers itched to work on them, but if he did that then there was no way that his teammates wouldn't drag him out of the lab kicking and screaming. It wouldn't even be that difficult to drag him out right now.
“Hey Tony,” Bucky said quietly, wandering over into the room. “I… I need to talk with you.”
As the super-soldier shrugged, Tony stepped forward and hugged him. “Thank you.”
"It is nice," Tony agreed, though he was still counting down the days until he'd be young again.
"I was surprised you even

before they even made it to the medical room. "Because if there's
"Please tell me that you didn't lie to Bruce about your health," Steve said, his voice grave.
"How come you get to look normal, Tony?" Clint asked.
"Good," Steve murmured, kissing his cheek. "You don't have to worry about me leaving, because I'm going to keep reminding you that I love you until you actually believe what I'm telling you."
Tony nodded. Of course—he’d walk first and wait at the end of the aisle for his to-be-husband to join him. But before Steve, in his white suit, could walk down the aisle, the rest of his team would be there. While they didn’t exactly have ‘bridesmaids’ and ‘groomsmen’ as both were grooms, they had decided who would be standing by who, with four people on each side.
"Bruce will figure it out," Steve said, stopping Tony before he could go down the hallway to the kitchen. "If there's
"What happened?" Tony spoke up once the three of them were in the elevator. Steve made sure to keep himself between his lover and his best friend, just in case anything
And then the briefcase was opened, and Steve could feel their energy. This is why Vormir had been his first destination. The gauntlet seemed to attract the stones like they were made to be placed in it.
"But he's out there somewhere," Tony said. His eyes glanced down at the ground, and Steve realized that whatever was wrong with Tony was directly related with him being off searching all of the time.
He'd never really known that he could love someone so completely, so unconditionally, until he met Steve. Sure, in the past he thought that he'd found 'the one' before—Pepper had been wonderful, she really had been, but they just... they didn't
"I understand. If there are any other weapons you have," he said, and Bucky nodded.

The battle had been going
When Tony got sucked into the portal, Steve didn't even have to think twice before diving in after him. There was no way that he was going to let anything happen to his boyfriend, not if he could help it. The issue was that, upon throwing himself towards the swirling mass of lights, he didn't end up finding Tony. No, instead he found himself falling down, down, down through the air, able to see nothing more than blue as the water of what he guessed was the ocean rushed up to hit him right in the face.
But there was no way that Steve actually just asked him that. He knew that his jaw was hanging open, but he couldn't help it! He'd only had a crush on Steve since...
or something. Just for a couple seconds—uh, green numbers that looked like some sort of code that you and Bruce normally work with—”
"Stand down," Tony said, trying his best to copy Steve's commanding 'Captain America' voice, "or else you might get hurt."
"And maybe tomorrow night, or whenever Steve and I are back to normal, the team can go out to dinner as a group. If you guys go with us now then
The elevator door opened and Bruce stepped in. “You might want to try something different with the rest of the team, it’ll already have been spread to them by now.”
When they eventually did move, and Steve dragged Tony right out of the town and over towards the path that he’d taken to get to the town. It didn’t matter if he’d have to fight off any beasts to get Tony out of there, he was prepared to
“Alright, sap, up you go. I can take space back too, you’ve got enough to deal with, with that screwed up arm of yours,” Tony said, glaring at Steve’s arm like it was slowly killing him or something.
"Tony, it's okay, I've got you," a voice whispered in his ears.
"Maybe sometime," Tony said, rolling his eyes.
“What’s wrong?” he asked, putting his coffee cup down.
"There's something that I've been meaning to talk with you about," Steve murmured, gently massaging Tony's back as the genius nuzzled against him, nearly purring like a cat. "I know it's only been a few days since you told the team... and I really hope that you've seen that everyone still loves you, and we still would whether or not you were Iron Man... but I really wanted to talk with you about
"Might want to let Tasha take it," Bucky said, grabbing Steve's wrist before he could run over to help the archer out. "After last time..."
